      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER I A REVELATION</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A group of boys was assembled in an open field to the west of the public schoolhouse in the town of Crawford. Most of them held hats in their hands, while two, stationed sixty feet distant from each other, were "having catch."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tom Pinkerton, son of Deacon Pinkerton, had just returned from Brooklyn, and while there had witnessed a match game between two professional clubs. On his return he proposed that the boys of Crawford should establish a club, to be known as the Excelsior Club of Crawford, to play among themselves, and on suitable occasions to challenge clubs belonging to other villages. This proposal was received with instant approval.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I move that Tom Pinkerton address the meeting," said one boy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Second the motion," said another.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As there was no chairman, James Briggs was appointed to that position, and put the motion, which was unanimously carried.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tom Pinkerton, in his own estimation a personage of considerable importance, came forward in a consequential manner, and commenced as follows:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mr. Chairman and boys. You all know what has brought us together. We want to start a club for playing baseball, like the big clubs they have in Brooklyn and New York."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How shall we do it?" asked Henry Scott.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We must first appoint a captain of the club, who will have power to assign the members to their different positions. Of course you will want one that understands about these matters."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He means himself," whispered Henry Scott, to his next neighbor; and here he was right.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is that all?" asked Sam Pomeroy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No; as there will be some expenses, there must be a treasurer to receive and take care of the funds, and we shall need a secretary to keep the records of the club, and write and answer challenges."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Boys," said the chairman, "you have heard Tom Pinkerton's remarks. Those who are in favor of organizing a club on this plan will please signify it in the usual way."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">All the boys raised their hands, and it was declared a vote.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You will bring in your votes for captain," said the chairman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tom Pinkerton drew a little apart with a conscious look, as he supposed, of course, that no one but himself would be thought of as leader.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Slips of paper were passed around, and the boys began to prepare their ballots. They were brought to the chairman in a hat, and he forthwith took them out and began to count them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Boys," he announced, amid a universal stillness, "there is one vote for Sam Pomeroy, one for Eugene Morton, and the rest are for Frank Fowler, who is elected."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was a clapping of hands, in which Tom Pinkerton did not join.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank Fowler, who is to be our hero, came forward a little, and spoke modestly as follows:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Boys, I thank you for electing me captain of the club. I am afraid I am not very well qualified for the place, but I will do as well as I can."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The speaker was a boy of fourteen. He was of medium height for his age, strong and sturdy in build, and with a frank prepossessing countenance, and an open, cordial manner, which made him a general favorite. It was not, however, to his popularity that he owed his election, but to the fact that both at bat and in the field he excelled all the boys, and therefore was the best suited to take the lead.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boys now proceeded to make choice of a treasurer and secretary. For the first position Tom Pinkton{sic} received a majority of the votes. Though not popular, it was felt that some office was due him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For secretary, Ike Stanton, who excelled in penmanship, was elected, and thus all the offices were filled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boys now crowded around Frank Fowler, with petitions for such places as they desired.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope you will give me a little time before I decide about positions, boys," Frank said; "I want to consider a little."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right! Take till next week," said one and another, "and let us have a scrub game this afternoon."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boys were in the middle of the sixth inning, when some one called out to Frank Fowler: "Frank, your sister is running across the field. I think she wants you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank dropped his bat and hastened to meet his sister.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's the matter, Gracie?" he asked in alarm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, Frank!" she exclaimed, bursting into tears. "Mother's been bleeding at the lungs, and she looks so white. I'm afraid she's very sick."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Boys," said Frank, turning to his companions, "I must go home at once. You can get some one to take my place, my mother is very sick."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Frank reached the little brown cottage which he called home, he found his mother in an exhausted state reclining on the bed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How do you feel, mother?" asked our hero, anxiously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Quite weak, Frank," she answered in a low voice</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have had a severe attack."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Let me go for the doctor, mother."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't think it will be necessary, Frank. The attack is over, and I need no medicines, only time to bring back my strength."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But three days passed, and Mrs. Fowler's nervous prostration continued. She had attacks previously from which she rallied sooner, and her present weakness induced serious misgivings as to whether she would ever recover. Frank thought that her eyes followed him with more than ordinary anxiety, and after convincing himself that this was the case, he drew near his mother's bedside, and inquired:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mother, isn't there something you want me to do?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nothing, I believe, Frank."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I thought you looked at me as if you wanted to say something."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There is something I must say to you before I die."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Before you die, mother!" echoed Frank, in a startled voice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. Frank, I am beginning to think that this is my last sickness."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But, mother, you have been so before, and got up again."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There must always be a last time, Frank; and my strength is too far reduced to rally again, I fear."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can't bear the thought of losing you, mother," said Frank, deeply moved.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You will miss me, then, Frank?" said Mrs. Fowler.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Shall I not? Grace and I will be alone in the world."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Alone in the world!" repeated the sick woman, sorrowfully, "with little help to hope for from man, for I shall leave you nothing. Poor children!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That isn't what I think of," said Frank, hastily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can support myself."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But Grace? She is a delicate girl," said the mother, anxiously. "She cannot make her way as you can."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She won't need to," said Frank, promptly; "I shall take care of her."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But you are very young even to support yourself. You are only fourteen."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know it, mother, but I am strong, and I am not afraid. There are a hundred ways of making a living."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But do you realize that you will have to start with absolutely nothing? Deacon Pinkerton holds a mortgage on this house for all it will bring in the market, and I owe him arrears of interest besides."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I didn't know that, mother, but it doesn't frighten me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And you will take care of Grace?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I promise it, mother."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Suppose Grace were not your sister?" said the sick woman, anxiously scanning the face of the boy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What makes you suppose such a thing as that, mother? Of course she is my sister."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But suppose she were not," persisted Mrs. Fowler, "you would not recall your promise?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, surely not, for I love her. But why do you talk so, mother?" and a suspicion crossed Frank's mind that his mother's intellect might be wandering.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is time to tell you all, Frank. Sit down by the bedside, and I will gather my strength to tell you what must be told."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Grace is not your sister, Frank!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not my sister, mother?" he exclaimed. "You are not in earnest?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am quite in earnest, Frank."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then whose child is she?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She is my child."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then she must be my sister—are you not my mother?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, Frank, I am not your mother!"</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER II MRS. FOWLER'S STORY</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not my mother!" he exclaimed. "Who, then, is my mother?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I cannot tell you, Frank. I never knew. You will forgive me for concealing this from you for so long."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No matter who was my real mother since I have you. You have been a mother to me, and I shall always think of you as such."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You make me happy, Frank, when you say that. And you will look upon Grace as a sister also, will you not?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Always," said the boy, emphatically. "Mother, will you tell all you know about me? I don't know what to think; now that I am not your son I cannot rest till I learn who I am."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can understand your feelings, Frank, but I must defer the explanation till to-morrow. I have fatigued myself with talking. but to-morrow you shall know all that I can tell you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Forgive me for not thinking of your being tired, mother," and he bent over and pressed his lips upon the cheek of the sick woman. "But don't talk any more. Wait till to-morrow."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the afternoon Frank had a call from Sam Pomeroy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The club is to play to-morrow afternoon against a picked nine, Frank," he said. "Will you be there?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can't, Sam," he answered. "My mother is very sick, and it is my duty to stay at home with her."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We shall miss you—that is, all of us but one. Tom Pinkerton said yesterday that you ought to resign, as you can't attend to your duties. He wouldn't object to filling your place, I fancy."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He is welcome to the place as soon as the club feels like electing him," said Frank. "Tell the boys I am sorry I can't be on hand. They had better get you to fill my place."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll mention it, but I don't think they'll see it in that light. They're all jealous of my superior playing," said Sam, humorously. "Well, good-bye, Frank. I hope your mother'll be better soon."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, Sam," answered Frank, soberly. "I hope so, too, but she is very sick."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The next day Mrs. Fowler again called Frank to the bedside.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Grace is gone out on an errand," she said, "and I can find no better time for telling you what I know about you and the circumstances which led to my assuming the charge of you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you strong enough, mother?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, Frank. Thirteen years ago my husband and myself occupied a small tenement in that part of Brooklyn know as Gowanus, not far from Greenwood Cemetery. My husband was a carpenter, and though his wages were small he was generally employed. We had been married three years, but had no children of our own. Our expenses were small, and we got on comfortably, and should have continued to do so, but that Mr. Fowler met with an accident which partially disabled him. He fell from a high scaffold and broke his arm. This was set and he was soon able to work again, but he must also have met with some internal injury, for his full strength never returned. Half a day's work tired him more than a whole day's work formerly had done. Of course our income was very much diminished, and we were obliged to economize very closely. This preyed upon my husband's mind and seeing his anxiety, I set about considering how I could help him, and earn my share of the expenses.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"One day in looking over the advertising columns of a New York paper I saw the following advertisement:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `For adoption—A healthy male infant. The parents are able to pay liberally for the child's maintenance, but circumstances compel them to delegate the care to another. Address for interview A. M.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I had no sooner read this advertisement than I felt that it was just what I wanted. A liberal compensation was promised, and under our present circumstances would be welcome, as it was urgently needed. I mentioned the matter to my husband, and he was finally induced to give his consent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Accordingly, I replied to the advertisement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Three days passed in which I heard nothing from it. But as we were sitting at the supper table at six o'clock one afternoon, there came a knock at our front door. I opened it, and saw before me a tall stranger, a man of about thirty-five, of dark complexion, and dark whiskers. He was well dressed, and evidently a gentleman in station.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `Is this Mrs. Fowler?' he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `Yes, sir,' I answered, in some surprise</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `Then may I beg permission to enter your house for a few minutes? I have something to say to you.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Still wondering, I led the way into the sitting-room, where your father—where Mr. Fowler—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Call him my father—I know no other," said Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where your father was seated.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `You have answered an advertisement,' said the stranger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `Yes, sir,' I replied.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `I am A. M.,' was his next announcement. `Of course I have received many letters, but on the whole I was led to consider yours most favorably. I have made inquiries about you in the neighborhood, and the answers have been satisfactory. You have no children of your own?'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `No, sir.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `All the better. You would be able to give more attention to this child.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `Is it yours, sir?' I asked</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `Ye-es,' he answered, with hesitation. `Circumstances,' he continued, `circumstances which I need not state, compel me to separate from it. Five hundred dollars a year will be paid for its maintenance.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Five hundred dollars! I heard this with joy, for it was considerably more than my husband was able to earn since his accident. It would make us comfortable at once, and your father might work when he pleased, without feeling any anxiety about our coming to want.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `Will that sum be satisfactory?' asked the stranger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `It is very liberal,' I answered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `I intended it to be so,' he said. `Since there is no difficulty on this score, I am inclined to trust you with the care of the child. But I must make two conditions.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `What are they, sir?'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `In the first place, you must not try to find out the friends of the child. They do not desire to be known. Another thing, you must move from Brooklyn.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `Move from Brooklyn?' I repeated.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `Yes,' he answered, firmly. `I do not think it necessary to give you a reason for this condition. Enough that it is imperative. If you decline, our negotiations are at an end.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I looked at my husband. He seemed as much surprised as I was.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `Perhaps you will wish to consult together,' suggested our visitor. `If so, I can give you twenty minutes. I will remain in this room while you go out and talk it over.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We acted on this hint, and went into the kitchen. We decided that though we should prefer to live in Brooklyn, it would be worth our while to make the sacrifice for the sake of the addition to our income. We came in at the end of ten minutes, and announced our decision. Our visitor seemed to be very much pleased.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `Where would you wish us to move?' asked your father.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `I do not care to designate any particular place. I should prefer some small country town, from fifty to a hundred miles distant. I suppose you will be able to move soon?'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `Yes, sir; we will make it a point to do so. How soon will the child be placed in our hands? Shall we send for it?'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `No, no,' he said, hastily. `I cannot tell you exactly when, but it will be brought here probably in the course of a day or two. I myself shall bring it, and if at that time you wish to say anything additional you can do so.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He went away, leaving us surprised and somewhat excited at the change that was to take place in our lives. The next evening the sound of wheels was heard, and a hack stopped at our gate. The same gentleman descended hurriedly with a child in his arms—you were the child, Frank—and entered the house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `This is the child,' he said, placing it in my arms, `and here is the first quarterly installment of your pay. Three months hence you will receive the same sum from my agent in New York. Here is his address,' and he placed a card in my hands. `Have you anything to ask?'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `Suppose I wish to communicate with you respecting the child? Suppose he is sick?'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `Then write to A. M., care of Giles Warner, No. — Nassau Street. By the way, it will be necessary for you to send him your postoffice address after your removal in order that he may send you your quarterly dues.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"With this he left us, entered the hack, and drove off. I have never seen him since."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER III LEFT ALONE</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank listened to this revelation with wonder. For the first time in his life he asked himself, "Who am I?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How came I by my name, mother?" he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I must tell you. After the sudden departure of the gentleman who brought you, we happened to think that we had not asked your name. We accordingly wrote to the address which had been given us, making the inquiry. In return we received a slip of paper containing these words: `The name is immaterial; give him any name you please. A. M.' "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You gave me the name of Frank."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It was Mr. Fowler's name. We should have given it to you had you been our own boy; as the choice was left to us, we selected that."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It suits me as well as any other. How soon did you leave Brooklyn, mother?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"In a week we had made all arrangements, and removed to this place. It is a small place, but it furnished as much work as my husband felt able to do. With the help of the allowance for your support, we not only got on comfortably, but saved up a hundred and fifty dollars annually, which we deposited in a savings bank. But after five years the money stopped coming. It was the year 1857, the year of the great panic, and among others who failed was Giles Warner's agent, from whom we received our payments. Mr. Fowler went to New York to inquire about it, but only learned that Mr. Warner, weighed down by his troubles, had committed suicide, leaving no clew to the name of the man who left you with us."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How long ago was that, mother?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Seven years ago nearly eight."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And you continued to keep me, though the payments stopped."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Certainly; you were as dear to us as our own child—for we now had a child of our own—Grace. We should as soon have thought of casting off her as you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But you must have been poor, mother."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We were economical, and we got along till your father died three years ago. Since then it has been hard work."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You have had a hard time, mother."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No harder on your account. You have been a great comfort to me, Frank. I am only anxious for the future. I fear you and Grace will suffer after I am gone."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't fear, mother, I am young and strong; I am not afraid to face the world with God's help."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What are you thinking of, Frank?" asked Mrs. Fowler, noticing the boy's fixed look.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mother," he said, earnestly, "I mean to seek for that man you have told me of. I want to find out who I am. Do you think he was my father?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He said he was, but I do not believe it. He spoke with hesitation, and said this to deceive us, probably."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am glad you think so, I would not like to think him my father. From what you have told me of him I am sure I would not like him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He must be nearly fifty now—dark complexion, with dark hair and whiskers. I am afraid that description will not help you any. There are many men who look like that. I should know him by his expression, but I cannot describe that to you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here Mrs. Fowler was seized with a very severe fit of coughing, and Frank begged her to say no more.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Two days later, and Mrs. Fowler was no better. She was rapidly failing, and no hope was entertained that she would rally. She herself felt that death was near at hand and told Frank so, but he found it hard to believe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the second of the two days, as he was returning from the village store with an orange for his mother, he was overtaken by Sam Pomeroy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is your mother very sick, Frank?" he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, Sam, I'm afraid she won't live."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is it so bad as that? I do believe," he added, with a sudden change of tone, "Tom Pinkerton is the meanest boy I ever knew. He is trying to get your place as captain of the baseball club. He says that if your mother doesn't live, you will have to go to the poorhouse, for you won't have any money, and that it will be a disgrace for the club to have a captain from the poorhouse."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did he say that?" asked Frank, indignantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"When he tells you that, you may say that I shall never go to the poorhouse."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He says his father is going to put you and your sister there."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All the Deacon Pinkertons in the world can never make me go to the poorhouse!" said Frank, resolutely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Bully for you, Frank! I knew you had spunk."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank hurried home. As he entered the little house a neighbor's wife, who had been watching with his mother, came to meet him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Frank," she said, gravely, "you must prepare yourself for sad news. While you were out your mother had another hemorrhage, and—and—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is she dead?" asked the boy, his face very pale.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She is dead!"</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER IV THE TOWN AUTOCRAT</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The Widder Fowler is dead," remarked Deacon Pinkerton, at the supper table. "She died this afternoon."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose she won't leave anything," said Mrs. Pinkerton.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No. I hold a mortgage on her furniture, and that is all she has."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What will become of the children?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"As I observed, day before yesterday, they will be constrained to find a refuge in the poorhouse."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What do you think Sam Pomeroy told me, father?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am not able to conjecture what Samuel would be likely to observe, my son."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He observed that Frank Fowler said he wouldn't go to the poorhouse."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ahem!" coughed the deacon. "The boy will not be consulted."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's what I say, father," said Tom, who desired to obtain his father's co-operation. "You'll make him go to the poorhouse, won't you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shall undoubtedly exercise my authority, if it should be necessary, my son."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He told Sam Pomeroy that all the Deacon Pinkertons in the world couldn't make him go to the poorhouse."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will constrain him," said the deacon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I would if I were you, father," said Tom, elated at the effect of his words. "Just teach him a lesson."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Really, deacon, you mustn't be too hard upon the poor boy," said his better-hearted wife. "He's got trouble enough on him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will only constrain him for his good, Jane. In the poorhouse he will be well provided for."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Meanwhile another conversation respecting our hero and his fortunes was held at Sam Pomeroy's home. It was not as handsome as the deacon's, for Mr. Pomeroy was a poor man, but it was a happy one, nevertheless, and Mr. Pomeroy, limited as were his means, was far more liberal than the deacon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I pity Frank Fowler," said Sam, who was warm-hearted and sympathetic, and a strong friend of Frank. "I don't know what he will do."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose his mother left nothing."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I understood," said Mr. Pomeroy, "that Deacon Pinkerton holds a mortgage on her furniture."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The deacon wants to send Frank and his sister to the poorhouse."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That would be a pity."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I should think so; but Frank positively says he won't go."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am afraid there isn't anything else for him. To be sure, he may get a chance to work in a shop or on a farm, but Grace can't support herself."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Father, I want to ask you a favor."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What is it, Sam?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Won't you invite Frank and his sister to come and stay here a week?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Just as your mother says."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I say yes. The poor children will be quite welcome. If we were rich enough they might stay with us all the time."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"When Frank comes here I will talk over his affairs with him," said Mr. Pomeroy. "Perhaps we can think of some plan for him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish you could, father."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"In the meantime, you can invite him and Grace to come and stay with us a week, or a fortnight. Shall we say a fortnight, wife?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"With all my heart."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right, father. Thank you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sam delivered the invitation in a way that showed how strongly his own feelings were enlisted in favor of its acceptance. Frank grasped his hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, Sam, you are a true friend," he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hadn't begun to think of what we were to do, Grace and I."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'll come, won't you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are sure that it won't trouble your mother, Sam?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She is anxious to have you come."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then I'll come. I haven't formed any plans yet, but I must as soon—as soon as mother is buried. I think I can earn my living somehow. One thing I am determined about—I won't go to the poorhouse."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The funeral was over. Frank and Grace walked back to the little house, now their home no longer. They were to pack up a little bundle of clothes and go over to Mr. Pomeroy's in time for supper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Frank had made up his bundle, urged by some impulse, he opened a drawer in his mother's bureau. His mind was full of the story she had told him, and he thought it just possible that he might find something to throw additional light upon his past history. While exploring the contents of the drawer he came to a letter directed to him in his mother's well-known handwriting. He opened it hastily, and with a feeling of solemnity, read as follows:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My Dear Frank: In the lower drawer, wrapped in a piece of brown paper, you will find two gold eagles, worth twenty dollars. You will need them when I am gone. Use them for Grace and yourself. I saved these for my children. Take them, Frank, for I have nothing else to give you. The furniture will pay the debt I owe Deacon Pinkerton. There ought to be something over, but I think he will take all. I wish I had more to leave you, dear Frank, but the God of the Fatherless will watch over you— to Him I commit you and Grace. Your affectionate mother, RUTH FOWLER."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank, following the instructions of the letter, found the gold pieces and put them carefully into his pocketbook. He did not mention the letter to Grace at present, for he knew not but Deacon Pinkerton might lay claim to the money to satisfy his debt if he knew it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am ready, Frank," said Grace, entering the room. "Shall we go?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, Grace. There is no use in stopping here any longer."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As he spoke he heard the outer door open, and a minute later Deacon Pinkerton entered the room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">None of the deacon's pompousness was abated as he entered the house and the room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Will you take a seat?" said our hero, with the air of master of the house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I intended to," said the deacon, not acknowledging his claim. "So your poor mother is gone?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir," said Frank, briefly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We must all die," said the deacon, feeling that it was incumbent on him to say something religious. "Ahem! your mother died poor? She left no property?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It was not her fault."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course not. Did she mention that I had advanced her money on the furniture?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My mother told me all about it, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ahem! You are in a sad condition. But you will be taken care of. You ought to be thankful that there is a home provided for those who have no means."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What home do you refer to, Deacon Pinkerton?" asked Frank, looking steadily in the face of his visitor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I mean the poorhouse, which the town generously provides for those who cannot support themselves."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This was the first intimation Grace had received of the possibility that they would be sent to such a home, and it frightened her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, Frank!" she exclaimed, "must we go to the poorhouse?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, Grace; don't be frightened," said Frank, soothingly. "We will not go."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Frank Fowler," said the deacon, sternly, "cease to mislead your sister."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am not misleading her, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did you not tell her that she would not be obliged to go to the poorhouse?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then what do you mean by resisting my authority?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You have no authority over us. We are not paupers," and Frank lifted his head proudly, and looked steadily in the face of the deacon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are paupers, whether you admit it or not."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We are not," said the boy, indignantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where is your money? Where is your property?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here, sir," said our hero, holding out his hands.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have two strong hands, and they will help me make a living for my sister and myself."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"May I ask whether you expect to live here and use my furniture?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I do not intend to, sir. I shall ask no favors of you, neither for Grace nor myself. I am going to leave the house. I only came back to get a few clothes. Mr. Pomeroy has invited Grace and me to stay at his house for a few days. I haven't decided what I shall do afterward."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You will have to go to the poorhouse, then. I have no objection to your making this visit first. It will be a saving to the town."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then, sir, we will bid you good-day. Grace, let us go."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER V A LITTLE MISUNDERSTANDING</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you carried Frank Fowler to the poorhouse?" asked Tom Pinkerton, eagerly, on his father's return.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, said the deacon, "he is going to make a visit at Mr. Pomeroy's first."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shouldn't think you would have let him make a visit," said Tom, discontentedly. "I should think you would have taken him to the poorhouse right off."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I feel it my duty to save the town unnecessary expense," said Deacon Pinkerton.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So Tom was compelled to rest satisfied with his father's assurance that the removal was only deferred.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Meanwhile Frank and Grace received a cordial welcome at the house of Mr. Pomeroy. Sam and Frank were intimate friends, and our hero had been in the habit of calling frequently, and it seemed homelike.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish you could stay with us all the time, Frank —you and Grace," said Sam one evening.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We should all like it," said Mr. Pomeroy, "but we cannot always have what we want. If I had it in my power to offer Frank any employment which it would be worth his while to follow, it might do. But he has got his way to make in the world. Have you formed any plans yet, Frank?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That is what I want to consult you about, Mr. Pomeroy."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will give you the best advice I can, Frank. I suppose you do not mean to stay in the village."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, sir. There is nothing for me to do here. I must go somewhere where I can make a living for Grace and myself."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You've got a hard row to hoe, Frank," said Mr. Pomeroy, thoughtfully. "Have you decided where to go?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir. I shall go to New York."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What! To the city?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir. I'll get something to do, no matter what it is."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But how are you going to live in the meantime?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've got a little money."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That won't last long."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know it, but I shall soon get work, if it is only to black boots in the streets."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"With that spirit, Frank, you will stand a fair chance to succeed. What do you mean to do with Grace?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will take her with me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can think of a better plan. Leave her here till you have found something to do. Then send for her."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But if I leave her here Deacon Pinkerton will want to put her in the poorhouse. I can't bear to have Grace go there."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She need not. She can stay here with me for three months."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Will you let me pay her board?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can afford to give her board for three months."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are very kind, Mr. Pomeroy, but it wouldn't be right for me to accept your kindness. It is my duty to take care of Grace."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I honor your independence, Frank. It shall be as you say. When you are able-mind, not till then —you may pay me at the rate of two dollars a week for Grace's board."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then," said Frank, "if you are willing to board Grace for a while, I think I had better go to the city at once."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will look over your clothes to-morrow, Frank," said Mrs. Pomeroy, "and see if they need mending."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then I will start Thursday morning—the day after."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">About four o'clock the next afternoon he was walking up the main street, when just in front of Deacon Pinkerton's house he saw Tom leaning against a tree.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How are you Tom?" he said, and was about to pass on.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where are you going?" Tom asked abruptly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"To Mr. Pomeroy's."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How soon are you going to the poorhouse to live?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Who told you I was going?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My father."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then your father's mistaken."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ain't you a pauper?" said Tom, insolently. "You haven't got any money."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have got hands to earn money, and I am going to try."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Anyway, I advise you to resign as captain of the baseball club."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Because if you don't you'll be kicked out. Do you think the fellows will be willing to have a pauper for their captain?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's the second time you have called me a pauper. Don't call me so again."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are a pauper and you know it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank was not a quarrelsome boy, but this repeated insult was too much for him. He seized Tom by the collar, and tripping him up left him on the ground howling with rage. As valor was not his strong point, he resolved to be revenged upon Frank vicariously. He was unable to report the case to his father till the next morning, as the deacon did not return from a neighboring village, whither he had gone on business, till late, but the result of his communication was a call at Mr. Pomeroy's from the deacon at nine o'clock the next morning. Had he found Frank, it was his intention, at Tom's request, to take him at once to the poorhouse. But he was too late. Our hero was already on his way to New York.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER VI FRANK GETS A PLACE</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So this is New York," said Frank to himself, as he emerged from the railway station and looked about him with interest and curiosity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Black yer boots? Shine?" asked a bootblack, seeing our hero standing still.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank looked at his shoes. They were dirty, without doubt, but he would not have felt disposed to be so extravagant, considering his limited resources, had he not felt it necessary to obtain some information about the city.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," he said, "you may black them."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boy was on his knees instantly and at work.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How much do you make in a day?" asked Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"When it's a good day I make a dollar."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's pretty good," said Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Can you show me the way to Broadway?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Go straight ahead."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Our hero paid for his shine and started in the direction indicated.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank's plans, so far as he had any, were to get into a store. He knew that Broadway was the principal business street in the city, and this was about all he did know about it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He reached the great thoroughfare in a few minutes, and was fortunate enough to find on the window of the corner store the sign:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A Boy Wanted."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He entered at once, and going up to the counter, addressed a young man, who was putting up goods.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you want a boy?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I believe the boss wants one; I don't. Go out to that desk."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank found the desk, and propounded the same question to a sandy-whiskered man, who looked up from his writing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're prompt," he said. "That notice was only put out two minutes ago."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I only saw it one minute ago."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So you want the place, do you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I should like it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you know your way about the city?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, sir, but I could soon find out."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That won't do. I shall have plenty of applications from boys who live in the city and are familiar with the streets."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank left the store rather discomfited.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He soon came to another store where there was a similar notice of "A Boy Wanted." It was a dry goods store.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you live with your parents?" was asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My parents are dead," said Frank, sadly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very sorry, but we can't take you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why not, sir?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"In case you took anything we should make your parents responsible."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shouldn't take anything," said Frank, indignantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You might; I can't take you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Our hero left this store a little disheartened by his second rebuff.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He made several more fruitless applications, but did not lose courage wholly. He was gaining an appetite, however. It is not surprising therefore, that his attention was drawn to the bills of a restaurant on the opposite side of the street. He crossed over, and standing outside, began to examine them to see what was the scale of prices. While in this position he was suddenly aroused by a slap on the back.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Turning he met the gaze of a young man of about thirty, who was smiling quite cordially.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, Frank, my boy, how are you?" he said, offering his hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pretty well, thank you," said our hero bewildered, for he had no recollection of the man who had called him by name.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The other smiled a little more broadly, and thought:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It was a lucky guess; his name is Frank."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am delighted to hear it," he continued. "When did you reach the city?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This morning," said the unsuspecting Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, it's queer I happened to meet you so soon, isn't it? Going to stay long?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shall, if I can get a place."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps I can help you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose I ought to remember you," ventured our hero, "but I can't think of your name."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Jasper Wheelock. You don't mean to say you don't remember me? Perhaps it isn't strange, as we only met once or twice in your country home. But that doesn't matter. I'm just as ready to help you. By the way, have you dined?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No more have I. Come in and dine with me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What'll you take?" asked Jasper Wheelock, passing the bill of fare to Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think I should like to have some roast beef," said Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That will suit me. Here, waiter, two plates of roast beef, and two cups of coffee."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How are they all at home?" asked Jasper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My mother has just died."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You don't say so," said Jasper, sympathetically.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My sister is well."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I forgot your sister's name."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Grace."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course—Grace. I find it hard to remember names. The fact is, I have been trying to recall your last name, but it's gone from me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Fowler."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"To be sure Frank Fowler. How could I be so forgetful."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The conversation was interrupted by the arrival of the coffee and roast beet, which both he and his new friend attacked with vigor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What kind of pudding will you have?" asked the stranger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Apple dumpling," said Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That suits me. Apple dumpling for two."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In due time the apple dumpling was disposed of, and two checks were brought, amounting to seventy cents.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll pay for both," said Jasper. "No thanks. We are old acquaintances, you know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He put his hand into his pocket, and quickly withdrew it with an exclamation of surprise:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, if that isn't a good joke," he said. "I've left my money at home. I remember now, I left it in the pocket of my other coat. I shall have to borrow the money of you. You may as well hand me a dollar!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank was not disposed to be suspicious, but the request for money made him uneasy. Still there seemed no way of refusing, and he reluctantly drew out the money.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His companion settled the bill and then led the way into the street.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jasper Wheelock was not very scrupulous; he was quite capable of borrowing money, without intending to return it; but he had his good side.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Frank," said he, as they found themselves in the street, "you have done me a favor, and I am going to help you in return. Have you got very much money?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No. I had twenty dollars when I left home, but I had to pay my fare in the cars and the dinner, I have seventeen dollars and a half left."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then it is necessary for you to get a place as soon as possible."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes; I have a sister to support; Grace, you know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I don't know. The fact is, Frank, I have been imposing upon you. I never saw you before in the whole course of my life."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What made you say you knew me?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wanted to get a dinner out of you. Don't be troubled, though; I'll pay back the money. I've been out of a place for three or four weeks, but I enter upon one the first of next week. For the rest of the week I've got nothing to do, and I will try to get you a place.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The first thing is to get a room somewhere. I'll tell you what, you may have part of my room."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is it expensive?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No; I pay a dollar and a half a week. I think the old lady won't charge more than fifty cents extra for you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then my share would be a dollar."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You may pay only fifty cents. I'll keep on paying what I do now. My room is on Sixth Avenue." They had some distance to walk. Finally Jasper halted before a baker's shop.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's over this," he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He drew out a latch-key and entered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This is my den," he said. It isn't large you can't get any better for the money."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shall have to be satisfied," said Frank. "I want to get along as cheap as I can."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've got to economize myself for a short time. After this week I shall earn fifteen dollars a week."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What business are you in, Mr. Wheelock?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am a journeyman printer. It is a very good business, and I generally have steady work. I expect to have after I get started again. Now, shall I give you some advice?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish you would."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You don't know your way around New York. I believe I have a map somewhere. I'll just show you on it the position of the principal streets, and that will give you a clearer idea of where we go."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The map was found and Jasper explained to Frank the leading topographical features of the Island City.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One thing only was wanting now to make him contented, and this was employment. But it was too late to make any further inquiries.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've been thinking, Frank," said Jasper, the next morning, "that you might get the position as a cash-boy."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What does a cash-boy do?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"In large retail establishments every salesman keeps a book in which his sales are entered. He does not himself make change, for it would not do to have so many having access to the money-drawer. The money is carried to the cashier's desk by boys employed for the purpose, who return with the change."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you think I can get a situation as cash-boy?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will try at Gilbert &amp; Mack's. I know one of the principal salesmen. If there is a vacancy he will get it for you to oblige me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They entered a large retail store on Broadway. It was broad and spacious. Twenty salesmen stood behind the counter, and boys were running this way and that with small books in their hands.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How are you, Duncan?" said Jasper</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The person addressed was about Jasper Wheelock's age. He had a keen, energetic look and manner, and would be readily singled out as one of the leading clerks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right, Wheelock. How are you?" he responded. "Do you want anything in our line?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No goods; I want a place for this youngster. He's a friend of mine. I'll answer for his good character."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That will be satisfactory. But what sort of a place does he want?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He is ready to begin as cash-boy."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then we can oblige you, as one of our boys has fallen sick, and we have not supplied his place. I'll speak to Mr. Gilbert."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He went up to Mr. Gilbert, a portly man in the back part of the store. Mr. Gilbert seemed to be asking two or three questions. Frank waited the result in suspense, dreading another disappointment, but this time he was fortunate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The boy can stay," reported Duncan. "His wages are three dollars a week."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was not much, but Frank was well pleased to feel that at last he had a place in the city.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He wrote a letter to Grace in the evening, announcing his success, and expressing the hope that he would soon be able to send for her.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER VII THE CASH BOY HAS AN ADVENTURE</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Four weeks passed. The duties of a cash-boy are simple enough, and Frank had no difficulty in discharging them satisfactorily. At first he found it tiresome, being on his feet all day, for the cash-boys were not allowed to sit down, but he got used to this, being young and strong.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">All this was very satisfactory, but one thing gave Frank uneasiness. His income was very inadequate to his wants.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What makes you so glum, Frank?" asked Jasper Wheelock one evening.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do I look glum?" said Frank. "I was only thinking how I could earn more money. You know how little I get. I can hardly take care of myself, much less take care of Grace."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can lend you some money, Frank. Thanks to your good advice, I have got some laid up."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, Jasper, but that wouldn't help matters. I should owe you the money, and I don't know how I could pay you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"About increasing your income, I really don't know," said Jasper. "I am afraid Gilbert &amp; Mack wouldn't raise your wages."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't expect it. All the rest of the cash-boys would ask the same thing."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"True; still I know they are very well pleased with you. Duncan told me you did more work than any of the rest of the boys."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I try to do all I can."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He said you would make a good salesman, he thought. Of course you are too young for that yet."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose I am."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Frank, I am earning fifteen dollars a week, you know, and I can get along on ten, but of the five I save let me give you two. I shall never feel it, and by and by when you are promoted it won't be necessary."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Jasper, you are a true friend," said Frank, warmly; "but it wouldn't be right for me to accept your kind offer, though I shan't forget it. You have been a good friend to me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And you to me, Frank. I'll look out for you. Perhaps I may hear of something for you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Small as Frank's income was, he had managed to live within it. It will be remembered that he had paid but fifty cents a week for a room. By great economy he had made his meals cost but two dollars a week, so that out of his three dollars he saved fifty cents. But this saving would not be sufficient to pay for his clothes. However, he had had no occasion to buy any as yet, and his little fund altogether amounted to twenty dollars. Of this sum he inclosed{sic} eight dollars to Mr. Pomeroy to pay for four weeks' board for Grace.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope I shall be able to keep it up," he said to himself, thoughtfully. "At any rate, I've got enough to pay for six weeks more. Before that time something may turn up."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Several days passed without showing Frank any way by which he could increase his income. Jasper again offered to give him two dollars a week out of his own wages, but this our hero steadily refused.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One Friday evening, just as the store was about to close, the head salesman called Frank to him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where do you live?" he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"In Sixth avenue, near Twenty-fifth street."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There's a bundle to go to Forty-sixth street. I'll pay your fare upon the stage if you'll carry it. I promised to send it to-night, and I don't like to disappoint the lady."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can carry it just as well as not."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank took the bundle, and got on board a passing omnibus. There was just one seat vacant beside an old gentleman of seventy, who appeared to be quite feeble.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At Forty-fifth street he pulled the strap and prepared to descend, leaning heavily on his cane as he did so. By some mischance the horses started a little too soon and the old man, losing his footing, fell in the street. Frank observed the accident and sprang out instantly to his help.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope you are not much hurt, sir?" he said, hastily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have hurt my knee," said the old gentleman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Let me assist you, sir," said Frank, helping him up.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, my boy. I live at number forty-five, close by. If you will lead me to the door and into the house I shall be much indebted to you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Certainly, sir. It is no trouble to me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With slow step, supported by our hero, the old gentleman walked to his own door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was opened by a maid servant, who looked with some surprise at Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I fell, Mary," explained her master, "and this young gentleman has kindly helped me home."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did you hurt yourself much, sir?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not seriously."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Can I do anything more for you, sir?" asked Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come in a moment."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Our hero followed his new acquaintance into a handsomely furnished parlor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now, my young friend tell me if you have been taken out of your way by your attention to me?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, no, sir; I intended to get out at the next street."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My dinner is just ready. Won't you stop and dine with me?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, sir," he said, hesitatingly, "but I promised to carry this bundle. I believe it is wanted at once."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So you shall. You say the house is in the next street. You can go and return in five minutes. You have done me a service, and I may have it in my power to do something for you in return."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps," thought Frank, "he can help me to some employment for my evenings." Then, aloud:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, sir; I will come."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Five minutes later Frank was ushered into a handsome dining-room. The dinner was already on the table, but chairs were only set for three. The one at the head of the table was of course occupied by the old gentleman, the one opposite by Mrs. Bradley, his housekeeper, and one at the side was placed for Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mrs. Bradley," said the old gentleman, "this is a young gentleman who was kind enough to help me home after the accident of which I just spoke to you. I would mention his name, but I must leave that to him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Frank Fowler, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And my name is Wharton. Now that we are all introduced, we can talk more freely."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Will you have some soup, Mr. Fowler?" asked the housekeeper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She was a tall thin woman, with a reserved manner that was somewhat repellant. She had only nodded slightly at the introduction, fixing her eyes coldly and searchingly on the face of our hero. It was evident that whatever impression the service rendered might have made upon the mind of Mr. Wharton, it was not calculated to warm the housekeeper to cordiality.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you," he answered, but he could not help feeling at the same time that Mrs. Bradley was not a very agreeable woman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You ought to have a good appetite," said Mr. Wharton. "You have to work hard during the day. Our young friend is a cash-boy at Gilbert &amp; Mack's, Mrs. Bradley.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, indeed!" said Mrs. Bradley, arching her brows as much as to say: "You have invited strange company to dinner."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do your parents live in the city, Frank—I believe your name is Frank?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, sir; they are dead. My mother died only a few weeks since."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And have you no brothers and sisters?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have one sister—Grace."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose she is in the city here with you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, sir. I left her in the country. I am here alone."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will ask you more about yourself after dinner. If you have no engagement, I should like to have you stay with me a part of the evening."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank accepted the invitation, though he knew Jasper would wonder what had become of him. He saw that the old gentleman was kindly disposed toward him, and in his present circumstances he needed such a friend.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But in proportion as Mr. Wharton became more cordial, Mrs. Bradley became more frosty, until at last the old gentleman noticed her manner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't you feel well this evening, Mrs Bradley?" he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have a little headache," said the housekeeper, coldly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You had better do something for it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It will pass away of itself, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They arose from the dinner table, and Mr. Wharton, followed by Frank, ascended the staircase to the front room on the second floor, which was handsomely fitted up as a library,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What makes him take such notice of a mere cash-boy?" said Mrs. Bradley to herself. "That boy reminds me of somebody. Who is it?"</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER VIII AN UNEXPECTED ENGAGEMENT</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Take a seat, Frank," said Mr. Wharton, pointing to a luxurious armchair on one side of the cheerful grate fire; "I will take the other, and you shall tell me all about yourself."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, sir," said our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His confidence was won by Mr. Wharton's kind tone, and he briefly recounted his story.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the conclusion, Mr. Wharton said:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How old are you, Frank ?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Fourteen, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are a brave boy, and a good boy, and you deserve success."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But I am bound to say that you have a hard task before you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know it, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why not let your sister go to the poorhouse for a few years, till you are older, and better able to provide for her?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I should be ashamed to do it, sir," he said. "I promised my mother to take care of Grace, and I will."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How much do you earn as a cash-boy?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Three dollars a week."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Only three dollars a week! Why, that won't pay your own expenses!" said the old gentleman in surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir, it does. I pay fifty cents a week for my room, and my meals don't cost me much."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But you will want clothes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have enough for the present, and I am laying up fifty cents a week to buy more when I need them."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You can't buy many for twenty-six dollars a year. But that doesn't allow anything for your sister's expenses."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That is what puzzles me, sir," said Frank, fixing a troubled glance upon the fire. "I shall have to work in the evenings for Grace."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What can you do?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I could copy, but I suppose there isn't much chance of getting copying to do."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then you have a good handwriting?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pretty fair, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Let me see a specimen. There are pen and ink on the table, and here is a sheet of paper."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank seated himself at the table, and wrote his name on the paper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very good," said his host, approvingly. "Your hand is good enough for a copyist, but you are correct in supposing that work of that kind is hard to get. Are you a good reader?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you mean in reading aloud, sir?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will try, if you wish."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Take a book from the table—any book—and let me hear you read."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank opened the first book that came to hand— one of Irving's and read in a clear, unembarrassed voice about half a page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very good indeed!" said Mr. Wharton. "You have been well taught. Where did you attend school?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Only in the town school, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You have, at any rate, made good use of your advantages."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But will it do me any good, sir?" asked Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"People are not paid for reading, are they?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not in general, but we will suppose the case of a person whose eyes are weak, and likely to be badly affected by evening use. Then suppose such a person could secure the services of a good, clear, distinct reader, don't you think he would be willing to pay something?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose so. Do you know of any such person?" asked Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am describing myself, Frank. A year since I strained my eyes very severely, and have never dared to use them much since by gaslight. Mrs. Bradley, my housekeeper, has read to me some, but she has other duties, and I don't think she enjoys it very much. Now, why shouldn't I get you to read to me in the evening when you are not otherwise employed?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish you would, Mr. Wharton," said Frank, eagerly. "I would do my best."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have no doubt of that, but there is another question—perhaps you might ask a higher salary than I could afford to pay."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Would a dollar a week be too much?" asked Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't think I could complain of that," said Mr. Wharton, gravely. "Very well, I will engage you as my reader."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But about the pay; I have made up my mind to pay you five dollars a week."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Five dollars a week!" Frank repeated. "It is much more than my services will be worth sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Let me judge of that, Frank."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know how to thank you, sir," said Frank, gratefully. "I never expected to be so rich. I shall have no trouble in paying for Grace's board and clothes now. When do you want me to begin reading to you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You may as well begin to-night—that is, unless you have some other engagement."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, no, sir, I have nothing else to do."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Take the Evening Post, then, and read me the leading editorial. Afterward, I will tell you what to read."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank had been reading about half an hour, when a knock was heard at the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come in," said Mr. Wharton.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs Bradley entered, with a soft, quiet step.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I thought, sir," she began, "you might like me to read to you, as usual."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, Mrs. Bradley, but I am going to relieve you of that portion of your labors. My young friend here is to come every evening and read to me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Indeed!" ejaculated the housekeeper in a tone of chilly displeasure, and a sharp glance at Frank, which indicated no great amount of cordiality. "Then, as I am intruding, I will take my leave."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was something in her tone that made Frank feel uncomfortable.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER IX THE HOUSEKEEPER'S NEPHEW</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"By no means," said Mr. Wharton, as the housekeeper was about to withdraw; "don't imagine you are intruding. Come in and sit down."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, sir," said Mrs. Bradley, in a measured tone. "You are very considerate, I am sure, but if you'll excuse me, I won't come in this evening."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mrs. Bradley has been with me a good many years," explained Mr. Wharton, "and I dare say she feels a little disturbed at seeing another occupy her place, even in a duty like this."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am afraid she will be offended with me, sir," said Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, no; I will explain matters to her. Go on with your reading, Frank."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At half-past nine, Mr. Wharton took out his watch.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is getting late," he said. "I have no doubt you are tired and need rest."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am not tired, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I believe in going to bed early. I shall seldom keep you later than this. Do you think you can find your way out?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir. When shall I come to-morrow evening?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A little before eight."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will be punctual."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jasper was waiting for him, not wholly without anxiety, for it was very unusual for Frank to be late.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, Frank!" he exclaimed; "this is a pretty time for you to come home. I began to think you had got into trouble. I was just going around to the nearest station house in search of you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I was in quite a different place, Jasper."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank told his story, including an account of his engagement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So it seems I am to lose your company in the evening. I am sorry for that, but I am glad you are so lucky."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It was better than I expected," said Frank, with satisfaction.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What sort of a man is this Mr. Wharton?" said Jasper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He is very kind and generous. I am lucky to have so good a friend. There's only one thing that is likely to be disagreeable."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's that?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The housekeeper—her name is Mrs. Bradley— for some reason or other she doesn't want me there."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What makes you think so?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Her manner, and the way she speaks. She came in to read to Mr. Wharton last evening, and didn't seem to like it because I had been taken in her place."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She is evidently jealous. You must take care not to offend her. She might endeavor to have you dismissed."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shall always treat her politely, but I don't think I can ever like her."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Meanwhile, the housekeeper, on leaving the library, had gone to her own room in dudgeon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mr. Wharton's a fool!" she muttered to herself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What possessed him to take this cash-boy from the streets, invite him to dinner, and treat him as an honored guest, and finally to engage him as a reader? I never heard of anything so ridiculous! Is this little vagabond to take my place in the old man's good graces? I've been slaving and slaving for twenty years, and what have I got by it? I've laid up two thousand dollars; and what is that to provide for my old age? If the old man would die, and remember me handsomely in his will, it would be worth while; but this new favorite may stand in my way. If he does I'll be revenged on him as sure as my name is Ulrica Bradley."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here the area bell rang, and in a moment one of the housemaid's entered Mrs. Bradley's room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There's your nephew outside, ma'am, and wanting to see you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Tell him to come m," and the housekeeper's cold face became softer and pleasanter in aspect as a young man of twenty entered and greeted her carelessly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How are you, aunt?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pretty well, Thomas," she answered. "You haven't been here for some time."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No. I've had a lot of work to do. Nothing but work, work, all the time," he grumbled. "I wish I was rich."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You get through at six o'clock, don't you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope you spend your evenings profitably, Thomas?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I ain't likely to go on any sprees, aunt, if that's what you mean. I only get twelve dollars a week."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I should think you might live on it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Starve, you mean. What's twelve dollars to a young fellow like me when he's got his board to pay, and has to dress like a gentleman?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are not in debt, I hope, Thomas?" said Mrs. Bradley, uneasily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I owe for the suit I have on, and I don't know where I'm going to get the money to pay for it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He was dressed in a flashy style, not unlike what is popularly denominated a swell. His coarse features were disfigured with unhealthy blotches, and his outward appearance was hardly such as to recommend him. But to him alone the cold heart of the housekeeper was warm. He was her sister's son and her nearest relative. Her savings were destined for him, and in her attachment she was not conscious of his disagreeable characteristics. She had occasionally given him a five-dollar bill to eke out what he termed his miserable pay, and now whenever he called he didn't spare hints that he was out of pocket, and that a further gift would be acceptable. Indeed, the only tie that bound him to his aunt was a mercenary one.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But the housekeeper, sharp-sighted as she ordinarily was, did not detect the secret motive of such attention she received from her nephew. She flattered herself that he really loved her, not suspecting that he was too selfish to love anybody but himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thomas," she said, with a sudden thought, "I may be able to help you to an increase of your income. Mr. Wharton needs somebody to read to him evenings. On my recommendation he might take you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, aunt, but I don't see it. I don't want to be worked to death."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But, think, Thomas," said his aunt, earnestly. "He is very rich. He might take a fancy to you and remember you in his will."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish somebody would remember me in his will. Do you really think there's any chance of the old boy's doing something handsome for me?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That depends on yourself. You must try to please him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I must do something. What'll he give?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know yet. In fact, there's another reading to him just now."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then there's no chance for me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Listen to me. It's a boy he's picked up in the streets, quite unsuited for the place. He's a cash-boy at Gilbert &amp; Mack's. Why, that's where you are," she added, with sudden recollection.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A cash-boy from my own place? What's his name?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Fowler, I believe."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know him—he's lately come. How did he get in with the old man?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mr. Wharton fell in the street, and he happened to be near, and helped him home."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'll have to manage it, aunt."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll see what I can do to-morrow. He ought to prefer my nephew to a strange boy, seeing I have been twenty years in his service. I'll let you know as soon as I have accomplished anything."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't half like the idea of giving up my evenings. I don't believe I can stand it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is only for a little while, to get him interested in you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Maybe I might try it a week, and then tell him my health was failing, and get him to do something else for me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"At any rate, the first thing must be to become acquainted."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thomas now withdrew, for he did not enjoy spending an evening with his aunt, the richer by five dollars, half of which was spent before the evening closed at a neighboring billiard saloon.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER X THE HOUSEKEEPER SCHEMING</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If Mrs. Bradley had been wiser, she would have felt less confident of her nephew's producing a favorable impression upon Mr. Wharton. She resolved to open the subject at the breakfast table</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I didn't know, Mr. Wharton," she commenced, "that you intended to engage a reader."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nor did I propose to do so until last evening."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think—you'll excuse me for saying so—that you will find that boy too young to suit you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't think so. He reads very clearly and distinctly."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If I had known you thought of engaging a reader, I would have asked you to engage my nephew."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Indeed, I was not aware that you had a nephew in the city. Is he a boy?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No; he is a young man. He was twenty years old last June."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is he unfavorably situated?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He has a place as salesman."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"With what firm?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Gilbert &amp; Mack."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, that is the same firm that employs my young friend. It is a good firm."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps it is, but my poor nephew receives a very small salary. He finds it very hard to get along."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Your nephew is young. He will be promoted if he serves his employers well."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thomas would have been glad to read to you in the evening, sir," said Mrs. Bradley, commencing the attack.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But for my present engagement, I might have taken him," said Mr. Wharton, politely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you engaged that boy for any length of time?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No; but it is understood that he will stay while I need him, and he continues to suit me. I have a favorable opinion of him. Besides, he needs the pay. He receives but three dollars a week as a cash-boy, and has a sister to support as well as himself."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am sorry," she said in an injured tone. "I hope you'll excuse my mentioning it, but I took the liberty, having been for twenty years in your employ."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"To be sure! You were quite right," said her employer, kindly. "Perhaps I may be able to do something for your nephew, though not that. Tell him to come and see me some time."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, sir," said the housekeeper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was one question she wanted to determine, and that was the amount of compensation received by Frank. She did not like to inquire directly from Mr. Wharton, but resolved to gain the information from our hero. Some evenings later she had the opportunity. Mr. Wharton had an engagement, and asked her to tell Frank, when he arrived that he was released from duty. Instead of this she received him in the library herself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Probably Mr. Wharton will not be at home this evening," she said. "If he does not return in half an hour, you need not wait."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She took up her work, seated in Mr. Wharton's usual place, and Frank remained ready for duty.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mr. Wharton tells me you have a sister," she said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, ma'am."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You must find it hard work to provide for her as well as yourself."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I do, or rather I did till I came here."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How much does Mr. Wharton pay you?" she asked, in an indifferent tone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Five dollars a week," answered Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are lucky that you have such a chance," she said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, ma'am; it is more than I earn, I know, but it is a great help to me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And how much do you get as cash-boy?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Three dollars a week."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So you actually receive nearly twice as much for a couple of hours in the evening as for the whole day."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, ma'am."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What a pity Thomas can't have this chance," she thought.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When it was nine o'clock, she said:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You need not wait any longer. Mr. Wharton will not be home in time to hear you read."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good-evening, Mrs. Bradley," said Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good-evening!" she responded, coldly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That boy is in the way," she said to herself, when she was left alone. "He is in my way, and Tom's way. I can see that he is artfully intriguing for Mr. Wharton's favor, but I must checkmate him. It's odd," she resumed, after a pause, "but there is something in his face and voice that seems familiar to me. What is it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">*</field>
      <field name="fulltext">*</field>
      <field name="fulltext">*</field>
      <field name="fulltext">*</field>
      <field name="fulltext">*</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The following evening the housekeeper received another visit from her nephew.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How do, aunt?" said Thomas Bradley, carelessly, as he entered the housekeeper's room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very well, thank you, Thomas. I am glad you are here. I have been wanting to see you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The old man isn't going to do anything for me, is he?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How can you expect it so soon? He doesn't know you yet. How much do you think he pays the cash-boy that reads to him in the evening?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Five dollars a week."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wouldn't give up my evenings for that," he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It isn't so much the pay, Thomas, though that would be a help. He might take a fancy to you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That might pay better. When are you going to introduce me?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This evening; that is, I will ask Mr. Wharton if he will see you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Bradley entered the library, where Frank was engaged in reading aloud.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Excuse my interruption," she said; "but my nephew has just called, and I should like to introduce him to you, if you will kindly receive him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Certainly, Mrs. Bradley," said Mr. Wharton. "Bring him in."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The housekeeper left the room, but speedily reappeared, followed by her nephew, who seemed a little abashed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My nephew, Thomas Bradley, Mr. Wharton," said his aunt, by way of introduction. "You have often heard me speak of Mr. Wharton, Thomas."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How do you do, sir?" said Thomas awkwardly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pray take a seat, Mr. Bradley. Your aunt has been long a member of my family. I am glad to see a nephew of hers. I believe you are a salesman at Gilbert &amp; Mack's?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then you must know my young friend here?" pointing to Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How are you, Cash?" said Thomas, laughing, under the impression that he had said something smart.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very well, Mr. Bradley," answered Frank, quietly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You see, that's all the name we call 'em in the store," said Thomas.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Wharton could not help thinking:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How poorly this young man compares with my young friend. Still, as he is Mrs. Bradley's nephew, I must be polite to him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are there many cash-boys in your establishment, Mr. Bradley?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"About a dozen. Ain't there, Fowler?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I believe so, Mr. Bradley."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Gilbert &amp; Mack do a good business, I should judge."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, they do; but that doesn't do us poor salesmen much good. We get just enough to keep soul and body together."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am sorry to hear it," said Mr. Wharton.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, sir," said Thomas, gaining confidence, "all they pay me is twelve dollars a week. How can they expect a fellow to live on that?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I began my career about your age," said Mr. Wharton, "or perhaps a little younger, and had to live on but six dollars a week."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Didn't you come near starving?" he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"On the contrary, I saved a little every week."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can't," said Thomas, a little discomfited. "Why, it takes half that to dress decently."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Wharton glanced quietly at the rather loud and flashy dress worn by his visitor, but only said:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A small salary, of course, makes economy necessary."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But when a fellow knows he earns a good deal more than he gets, he doesn't feel like starving himself just that his employers may grow rich."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course, if he can better himself they cannot object."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's just what I want to do," said Thomas; "but I expect I need influence to help me to something better. That's a good hint," thought he.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I was telling Thomas," said the housekeeper, "that you had kindly expressed a desire to be of service to him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am not now in active business," said Mr. Wharton, "and of course have not the opportunities I formerly had for helping young men, but I will bear your case in mind, Mr. Bradley."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, sir," said Thomas. "I am sure I earn a thousand dollars a year."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think, Thomas," said Mrs. Bradley, "we won't intrude on Mr. Wharton longer this evening. When he finds something for you he will tell me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right, aunt. Good-night, Mr. Wharton. Good-night, Cash," said Thomas, chuckling anew at the old joke.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, aunt," said he, when they were once more in the housekeeper's room, "do you think the old gentleman will do anything for me?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope so; but I am not sure, Thomas, whether you were not too familiar. You spoke of money too quick."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's my way to come to business."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish you were his reader, instead of that boy."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I don't. I wouldn't want to he mewed up in that room with the old man every night. I should get tired to death of it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You would have a chance to get him interested in you. That boy is artful; he is doing all he can to win Mr. Wharton's favor. He is the one you have most reason to dread."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you think he will do me any harm?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think he will injure your chances."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Egad! if I thought that, I'd wring the young rascal's neck."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There's a better way, Thomas."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's that?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Can't you get him dismissed from Gilbert &amp; Mack's?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I haven't enough influence with the firm."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Suppose they thought him dishonest?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They'd give him the sack, of course."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Can't you make them think so, Thomas?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then make it your business to find out."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose you know what good it's going to do, aunt, but I don't. He's got his place here with the old man."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If Mr. Wharton hears that he is discharged, and has lost his situation, he will probably discharge him, too."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps so; I suppose you know best."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do as I tell you, and I will manage the rest."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right. I need your help enough. To-night, for instance, I'm regularly cleaned out. Haven't got but twenty-five cents to my name."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It seems to me, Thomas," said his aunt, with a troubled look, "you are always out of money. I'll give you five dollars, Thomas, but you must remember that I am not made of money. My wages are small."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You ought to have a good nest-egg laid aside, aunt."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've got something, Thomas, and when I die, it'll be yours."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope I shan't have to wait too long," thought Thomas, but he did not give utterance to the thought."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come again, Thomas, and don't forget what I have said," said Mrs. Bradley.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XI JOHN WADE</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A tall man, with a sallow complexion, and heavily-bearded face, stood on the deck of a Cunard steamer, only a few miles distant from New York harbor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's three years since I have seen America," he said to himself, thoughtfully. "I suppose I ought to feel a patriotic fervor about setting foot once more on my native shore, but I don't believe in nonsense. I would be content to live in Europe all my life, if my uncle's fortune were once in my possession. I am his sole heir, but he persists in holding on to his money bags, and limits me to a paltry three thousand a year. I must see if I can't induce him to give me a good, round sum on account—fifty thousand, at least—and then I can wait a little more patiently till he drops off."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"When shall we reach port, captain?" he asked, as he passed that officer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"In four hours, I think, Mr. Wade."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So this is my birthday," he said to himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thirty five years old to-day. Half my life gone, and I am still a dependent on my uncle's bounty. Suppose he should throw me off—leave me out in the cold—where should I be? If he should find the boy—but no, there is no chance of that. I have taken good care of that. By the way, I must look him up soon—cautiously, of course—and see what has become of him. He will grow up a laborer or mechanic and die without a knowledge of his birth, while I fill his place and enjoy his inheritance."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At six o'clock the vessel reached the Quarantine. Most of the passengers decided to remain on board one night more, but John Wade was impatient, and, leaving his trunks, obtained a small boat, and soon touched the shore.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was nearly eight when John Wade landed in the city. It was half-past eight when he stood on the steps of his uncle's residence and rang the bell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is my uncle is Mr. Wharton—at home?" he asked of the servant who answered the bell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am his nephew, just arrived from Europe. Let him know that I am here, and would like to see him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The servant, who had never before seen him, having only been six months in the house, regarded him with a great deal of curiosity, and then went to do his biddng.{sic}</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My nephew arrived!" exclaimed Mr. Wharton, in surprise. "Why, he never let me know he was coming."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Will you see him, sir?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"To be sure! Bring him in at once."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My dear uncle!" exclaimed John Wade, with effusion, for he was a polite man, and could act when it suited his interests to do so, "I am glad to see you. "How is your health?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am getting older every day, John."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You don't look a day older, sir," said John, who did not believe what he said, for he could plainly see that his uncle had grown older since he last saw him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You think so, John, but I feel it. Your coming is a surprise. You did not write that you intended sailing."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I formed the determination very suddenly, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Were you tired of Europe?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No; but I wanted to see you, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, John," said his uncle, pressing his nephew's hand. "I am glad you think so much of me. Did you have a pleasant voyage?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Rather rough, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You have had no supper, of course? If you will ring the bell, the housekeeper will see that some is got ready for you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is Mrs. Bradley still in your employ, uncle?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, John. I am so used to her that I shouldn't know how to get along without her."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hitherto John Wade had been so occupied with his uncle that he had not observed Frank. But at this moment our hero coughed, involuntarily, and John Wade looked at him. He seemed to be singularly affected. He started perceptibly, and his sallow face blanched, as his eager eyes were fixed on the boy's face.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good heavens!" he muttered to himself. "Who is that boy? How comes he here?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank noticed his intent gaze, and wondered at it, but Mr. Wharton's eyesight was defective, and he did not perceive his nephew's excitement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I see you have a young visitor, uncle," said John Wade.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, yes," said Mr. Wharton, with a kindly smile. "He spends all his evenings with me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What do you mean, sir?" demanded John Wade, with sudden suspicion and fear. "He seems very young company for—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"For a man of my years," said Mr. Wharton, finishing the sentence. "You are right, John. But, you see, my eyes are weak, and I cannot use them for reading in the evening, so it occurred to me to engage a reader."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very true," said his nephew. He wished to inquire the name of the boy whose appearance had so powerfully impressed him but he determined not to do so at present. What information he sought he preferred to obtain from the housekeeper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He seemed surprised, as if he had seen me somewhere before, and recognized me," thought Frank, "but I don't remember him. If I had seen his face before, I think I should remember it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't come out, uncle." said John Wade, when summoned to tea by the housekeeper. "Mrs. Bradley and I are going to have a chat by ourselves, and I will soon return."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are looking thin, Mr. John," said Mrs Bradley.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Am I thinner than usual? I never was very corpulent, you know. How is my uncle's health? He says he is well."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He is pretty well, but he isn't as young as he was."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think he looks older," said John. "But that is not surprising—at his age. He is seventy, isn't he?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not quite. He is sixty-nine."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"His father died at seventy-one."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But that is no reason why my uncle should not live till eighty. I hope he will."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We all hope so," said the housekeeper; but she knew, while she spoke, that if, as she supposed, Mr. Wharton's will contained a generous legacy for her, his death would not afflict her much. She suspected also that John Wade was waiting impatiently for his uncle's death, that he might enter upon his inheritance. Still, their little social fictions must be kept up, and so both expressed a desire for his continued life, though neither was deceived as to the other's real feeling on the subject.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"By the way, Mrs. Bradley," said John Wade, "how came my uncle to engage that boy to read to him?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He was led into it, sir," said the housekeeper, with a great deal of indignation, "by the boy himself. He's an artful and designing fellow, you may rely upon it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's his name?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Frank Fowler."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Fowler! Is his name Fowler?" he repeated, with a startled expression.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir," answered the housekeeper, rather surprised at his manner. "You don't know anything about him, do you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, no," said John Wade, recovering his composure. "He is a perfect stranger to me; but I once knew a man of that name, and a precious rascal he was. When you mentioned his name, I thought he might be a son of this man. Does he say his father is alive?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No; he is dead, and his mother, too, so the boy says."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You haven't told me how my uncle fell in with him?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It was an accident. Your uncle fell in getting out of a Broadway stage, and this boy happened to be near, and seeing Mr. Wharton was a rich gentleman, he helped him home, and was invited in. Then he told some story about his poverty, and so worked upon your uncle's feelings that he hired him to read to him at five dollars a week."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is this all the boy does?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No; he is cash-boy in a large store on Broadway. He is employed there all day, and he is here only in the evenings."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Does my uncle seem attached to him?" asked John.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He's getting fond of him, I should say. The other day he asked me if I didn't think it would be a good thing to take him into the house and give him a room. I suppose the boy put it into his head."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No doubt. What did you say?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I opposed it. I told him that a boy would be a great deal of trouble in the family."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You did right, Mrs. Bradley. What did my uncle say?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He hinted about taking him from the store and letting him go to school. The next thing would be his adopting him. The fact is, Mr. John, the boy is so artful that he knows just how to manage your uncle. No doubt he put the idea into Mr. Wharton's head, and he may do it yet."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Does my uncle give any reason for the fancy he has taken to the boy?" demanded John</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said the housekeeper. "He has taken it into his head that the boy resembles your cousin, George, who died abroad. You were with him, I believe?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I was with him. Is the resemblance strong? I took very little notice of him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You can look for yourself when you go back," answered the housekeeper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What else did my uncle say? Tell me all."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He said: `What would I give, Mrs. Bradley, if I had such a grandson? If George's boy had lived, he would have been about Frank's age. And," continued the housekeeper, "I might as well speak plainly. You're my master's heir, or ought to be; but if this artful boy stays here long, there's no knowing what your uncle may be influenced to do. If he gets into his dotage, he may come to adopt him, and leave the property away from you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I believe you are quite right. The danger exists, and we must guard against it. I see you don't like the boy," said John Wade.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I don't. He's separated your uncle and me. Before he came, I used to spend my evenings in the library, and read to your uncle. Besides, when I found your uncle wanted a reader, I asked him to take my nephew, who is a salesman in the very same store where that boy is a cash-boy, but although I've been twenty years in this house I could not get him to grant the favor, which he granted to that boy, whom he never met till a few weeks ago."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mrs. Bradley, I sympathize with you," said her companion. "The boy is evidently working against us both. You have been twenty years in my uncle's service. He ought to remember you handsomely in his will. If I inherit the property, as is my right, your services shall be remembered," said John Wade.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, Mr. John," said the gratified housekeeper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That secures her help," thought John, in his turn.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She will now work hard for me. When the time comes, I can do as much or as little for her as I please."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course, we must work together against this interloper, who appears to have gained a dangerous influence over my uncle."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You can depend upon me, Mr. John," said Mrs. Bradley.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will think it over, and tell you my plan," said John Wade. "But my uncle will wonder at my appetite. I must go back to the library. We will speak of this subject again."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XII A FALSE FRIEND</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When John Wade re-entered the library, Frank was reading, but Mr. Wharton stopped him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That will do, Frank," he said. "As I have not seen my nephew for a long time, I shall not require you to read any longer. You can go, if you like."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank bowed, and bidding the two good-evening, left the room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That is an excellent boy, John." said the old gentleman, as the door closed upon our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How did you fall in with him?" asked John. Mr. Wharton told the story with which the reader is already familiar.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You don't know anything of his antecedents, I suppose?" said John, carelessly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Only what he told me. His father and mother are dead, and he is obliged to support himself and his sister. Did you notice anything familiar in Frank's expression?" asked Mr. Wharton.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know. I didn't observe him very closely."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Whenever I look at Frank, I think of George. I suppose that is why I have felt more closely drawn to the boy. I proposed to Mrs. Bradley that the boy should have a room here, but she did not favor it. I think she is prejudiced against him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Probably she is afraid he would be some trouble," replied John.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If George's boy had lived he would be about Frank's age. It would have been a great comfort to me to superintend his education, and watch him grow up. I could not have wished him to be more gentlemanly or promising than my young reader."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Decidedly, that boy is in my way," said John Wade to himself. "I must manage to get rid of him, and that speedily, or my infatuated uncle will be adopting him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of what disease did George's boy die, John?" asked Mr. Wharton.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A sudden fever."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish I could have seen him before he died. But I returned only to find both son and grandson gone. I had only the sad satisfaction of seeing his grave."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, he was buried in the family lot at Greenwood, five days before you reached home."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"When I see men of my own age, surrounded by children and grandchildren, it makes me almost envious," said Mr. Wharton, sadly. "I declare to you, John, since that boy has been with me, I have felt happier and more cheerful than for years."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That boy again!" muttered John to himself. "I begin to hate the young cub, but I mustn't show it. My first work will be to separate him from my uncle. That will require consideration. I wonder whether the boy knows that he is not Fowler's son? I must find out. If he does, and should happen to mention it in my uncle's presence, it might awaken suspicions in his mind. I must interview the boy, and find out what I can. To enlist his confidence, I must assume a friendly manner."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In furtherance of this determination, John Wade greeted our hero very cordially the next evening, when they met, a little to Frank's surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When the reading terminated, John Wade said, carelessly:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I believe, uncle, I will go out for a walk. I think I shall be better for it. ln what direction are you going, Frank?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Down Sixth Avenue, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very good; I will walk along with you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank and his companion walked toward Sixth Avenue.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My uncle tells me you have a sister to support," said Wade, opening the conversation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Does your sister resemble you?" asked John Wade.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, sir! but that is not surprising, for—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why is it not surprising?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank hesitated.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You were about to assign some reason."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is a secret," said our hero, slowly; "that is, has been a secret, but I don't know why I should conceal it. Grace is not my sister. She is Mrs. Fowler's daughter, but I am not her son. I will tell you the story."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">That story Frank told as briefly as possible. John Wade listened to it with secret alarm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is a strange story," he said. "Do you not feel a strong desire to learn your true parentage?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir. I don't know, but I feel as if I should some day meet the man who gave me into Mrs. Fowler's charge."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You have met him, but it is lucky you don't suspect it," thought John Wade.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am glad you told me this story," said he, aloud.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is quite romantic. I may be able to help you in your search. But let me advise you to tell no one else at present. No doubt there are parties interested in keeping the secret of your birth from you. You must move cautiously, and your chance of solving the mystery will be improved."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, sir. I will follow your advice."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I was mstaken{sic} in him," thought Frank. "I disliked him at first, but he seems inclined to be my friend."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Frank reached his lodging he found Jasper waiting up for him. He looked thoughtful, so much so that Frank noticed it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You look as if you had something on your mind," Jasper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You have guessed right. I have Read that letter."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He drew from his pocket a letter, which Frank took from his hands.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is from an uncle of mine in Ohio, who is proprietor of a weekly newspaper. He is getting old, and finds the work too much for him. He offers me a thousand dollars a year if I will come out and relieve him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's a good offer, Jasper. I suppose you will accept it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is for my interest to do so. Probably my uncle will, after a while, surrender the whole establishment to me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shall be sorry to part with you, Jasper. It will seem very lonely, but I think you ought to go. It is a good chance, and if you refuse it you may not get such another."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My uncle wants me to come on at once. I think I will start Monday."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jasper saw no reason to change his determination, and on Monday morning he started on his journey to Ohio.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thus, at a critical moment in his fortunes, when two persons were planning to injure him, he lost the presence and help of a valued friend.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XIII THE SPIDER AND THE FLY</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Uncle," said John Wade, "you spoke of inviting k Fowler to occupy a room in the house. Why don't you do it? It would be more convenient to you and a very good chance for him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I should like it," said Mr. Wharton, "but Mrs. Bradley did not seem to regard it favorably when I suggested it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, Mrs. Bradley is unused to boys, and she is afraid he would give her trouble. I'll undertake to bring her around."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish you would, John. I don't think Frank would give any trouble, and it would enliven the house to have a boy here. Besides, he reminds me of George, as I told you the other day."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I agree with you, uncle," he said. "He does remind me a little of George."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, Mrs. Bradley, what do you think I have done?" asked John, entering the housekeeper's room directly after his interview with his uncle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know, Mr. John," she answered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have asked him to give that boy a room in the house."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you carried away with him as well as your uncle?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not quite. The fact is, I have a motive in what I am doing. I'll tell you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He bent over and whispered in her ear.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I never should have thought of that."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You see, our purpose is to convince my uncle that he is unworthy of his favor. At present that would be rather difficult, but once get him into the house and we shall have no trouble."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I understand."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In due time John Wade announced to his uncle that the housekeeper had withdrawn her objections to his plan.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then I'll tell him to-night," said Mr. Wharton, brightening up.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Shortly after Frank entered the library that evening Mr. Wharton made the proposal.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are very kind, Mr. Wharton," he said. "I never thought of such a thing."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then it is settled that you are to come. You can choose your own time for coming."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will come to-morrow, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very well," said Mr. Wharton, with satisfaction.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The next day, by special favor, Frank got off from the store two hours earlier than usual. He bought at a Sixth Avenue basement store, a small, second hand trunk for two dollars. He packed his scanty wardrobe into the trunk, which, small as it was he was unable to fill, and had it carried to Mr. Wharton's house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He asked to see Mrs. Bradley, and she came to the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am glad to see you," she said graciously. "You may leave your trunk in the hall and I will have it carried up by the servants."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you," said Frank, and he followed the housekeeper up the handsome staircase.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This is to be your room," said the housekeeper, opening the door of a small chamber on the third floor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It looks very nice and comfortable," said Frank, looking about him with satisfaction.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She left the room, and five minutes later our hero's modest trunk was brought up and deposited in the room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">That evening Frank read to Mr. Wharton as usual.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When nine o'clock came he said:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You need not read aloud any more, but if you see any books in my library which you would like to read to yourself you may do so. In fact, Frank, you must consider yourself one of the family, and act as freely as if you were at home."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How kind you are to me, Mr. Wharton," said Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The next morning after Frank had left the house for his daily task, John Wade entered the housekeeper's room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The boy is out of the way now, Mrs. Bradley," he said. "You had better see if you have a key that will unlock his trunk."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The two conspirators went upstairs, and together entered Frank's room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Bradley brought out a large bunch of keys, and successively tried them, but one after another failed to open it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's awkward," said John Wade. "I have a few keys in my pocket. One may possibly answer."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The housekeeper kneeled down, and made a trial of John Wade's keys. The last one was successful. The cover was lifted, and the contents were disclosed. However, neither John nor Mrs. Bradley seemed particularly interested in the articles for after turning them over they locked the trunk once more.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So far so good," said John Wade. "We have found the means of opening the trunk when we please."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"When do you expect to carry out your plan, Mr. John?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Two weeks from this time my uncle is obliged to go to Washington for a few days on business. While he is gone we will spring the trap, and when he comes back he will find the boy gone in disgrace. We'll make short work of him."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XIV SPRINGING THE TRAP</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am going to give you a few days' vacation, Frank," said Mr. Wharton, a fortnight later. "I am called to Washington on business. However, you have got to feel at home here now."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, yes, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And Mrs. Bradley will see that you are comfortable."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am sure of that, sir," said Frank, politely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Frank returned at night, Mr. Wharton was already gone. John Wade and the housekeeper seated themselves in the library after dinner, and by their invitation our hero joined them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"By the way, Frank," said John Wade, "did I ever show you this Russia leather pocketbook?" producing one from his pocket.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, sir, I believe not."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I bought it at Vienna, which is noted for its articles of Russia leather."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is very handsome, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So I think. By the way, you may like to look at my sleeve-buttons. They are of Venetian mosaic. I got them myself in Venice last year."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They are very elegant. You must have enjoyed visiting so many famous cities."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes; it is very interesting."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">John Wade took up the evening paper, and Frank occupied himself with a book from his patron's library. After a while John threw down the paper yawning, and said that he had an engagement. Nothing else occurred that evening which merits record.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Two days later Frank returned home in his usual spirits. But at the table he was struck by a singular change in the manner of Mrs. Bradley and John Wade. They spoke to him only on what it was absolutely necessary, and answered his questions in monosyllables.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Will you step into the library a moment?" said John Wade, as they arose from the table.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank followed John into the library, and Mrs. Bradley entered also.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Frank Fowler," the enemy began, "do you remember my showing you two evenings since a pocketbook, also some sleeve-buttons of Venetian mosaic, expensively mounted in gold?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Certainly, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That pocketbook contained a considerable sum of money," pursued his questioner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know anything about that."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You probably supposed so."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Will you tell me what you mean, Mr. Wade?" demanded Frank, impatiently. "I have answered your questions, but I can't understand why you ask them."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps you may suspect," said Wade, sarcastically.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It looks as if you had lost them and suspected me of taking them."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So it appears."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are entirely mistaken, Mr. Wade. I am not a thief. I never stole anything in my life."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is very easy to say that," sneered John Wade. "You and Mrs. Bradley were the only persons present when I showed the articles, and I suppose you won't pretend that she stole them?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, sir; though she appears to agree with you that I am a thief. I never thought of accusing her," replied Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mr. Wade," said the housekeeper, "I feel that it is my duty to insist upon search being made in my room."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you make the same offer?" asked John Wade, turning to Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir," answered our hero, proudly. "I wish you to satisfy yourself that I am not a thief. If you will come to my room at once, Mr. Wade, you and Mrs. Bradley, I will hand you the key of my trunk."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The two followed him upstairs, exulting wickedly in his discomfiture, which they had reason to forsee.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He handed his key to his artful enemy, and the latter bending over, opened the trunk, which contained all our hero's small possessions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He raised the pile of clothes, and, to Frank's dismay, disclosed the missing pocketbook and sleeve-buttons in the bottom of the trunk.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What have you got to say for yourself now, you young villain?" demanded John Wade, in a loud voice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't understand it," Frank said, in a troubled tone. "I don't know how the things came there. I didn't put them there."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Probably they crept in themselves," sneered John.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Someone put them there," said Frank, pale, but resolute; "some wicked person, who wanted to get me into trouble."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What do you mean by that, you young vagabond?" demanded John Wade, suspiciously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I mean what I say," he asserted. "I am away all day, and nothing is easier than to open my trunk and put articles in, in order to throw suspicion on me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Look here, you rascal!" said John Wade, roughly. "I shall treat you better than you deserve. I won't give you over to the police out of regard for my uncle, but you must leave this house and never set foot in it again. It will be the worse for you if you do."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">John Wade and the housekeeper left the room, and our hero was left to realize the misfortune which had overwhelmed him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank arose at an early hour the next morning and left the house. It was necessary for him to find a new home at once in order to be at the store in time. He bought a copy of the Sun and turned to the advertising columns. He saw a cheap room advertised near the one he had formerly occupied. Finding his way there he rang the bell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The door was opened by a slatternly-looking woman, who looked as if she had just got up.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I see by the Sun you have a room to let," said Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes; do you want to see it now?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I should like to."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come upstairs and I will show you the room."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The room proved to be small, and by no means neat in appearance, but the rent was only a dollar and a quarter a week, and Frank felt that he could not afford to be particular, so he quick closed the bargain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The next day, about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, he was surprised at seeing Mrs. Bradley enter the store and thread her way to that part of the counter where her nephew was stationed. She darted one quick look at him, but gave him no sign of recognition. His heart sank within him, for he had a presentiment that her visit boded fresh evil for him.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XV FROM BAD TO WORSE</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank's misgivings were not without good cause. The housekeeper's call at the store was connected with him. How, will be understood from a conversation which took place that morning between her and John Wade.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's a relief to get that boy out of the house, Mrs. Bradley," he said at the breakfast table.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That it is, Mr. John," she replied. "But he'll be trying to get back, take my word for it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He won't dare to," said John Wade, incredulously. "I told him if he came near the house I would give him up to the police."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am afraid he will write to your uncle. He's bold enough for anything."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I didn't think of that," said John, thoughtfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you know his handwriting, Mrs. Bradley?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think I should know it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then if any letters come which you know to be from him, keep them back from my uncle."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What shall I do with them?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Give them to me. I don't want my uncle worried by his appeals."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Your uncle seems to be very attached to him. He may go to the store to see him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That is true. I should not like that. How shall we prevent it, that's the question."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If Gilbert &amp; Mack knew that he was not honest they would discharge him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Exactly," said John Wade; "and as probably he would be unable to get another situation, he would be compelled to leave the city, and we should get rid of him. I commend your shrewdness, Mrs. Bradley. Your plan is most excellent."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">John Wade had more reasons than the housekeeper knew of for desiring the removal of our young hero from the city—reasons which the reader has probably guessed. There was a dark secret in his life connected with a wrong done in years past, from which he hoped some day to reap personal benefit. Unconsciously Frank Fowler stood in his way, and must be removed. Such was his determination.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am going out this morning," said the housekeeper. "I will make it in my way to call at Gilbert &amp; Mack's. My nephew is a salesman there, as I have told you. I will drop a word in his ear, and that will be enough to settle that boy's hash."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Your language is professional, Mrs. Bradley," said John Wade, laughing, "but you shouldn't allude to hash in an aristocratic household. I shall be glad to have you carry out your plan."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope you'll speak to your uncle about my nephew, Mr. John. He gets very poor pay where he is."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I won't forget him," said John, carelessly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In his heart he thought Thomas Bradley a very low, obtrusive fellow, whom he felt by no means inclined to assist, but it was cheap to make promises.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The reader understands now why Mrs. Bradley made a morning call at Gilbert &amp; Mack's store.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She knew at what part of the counter her nephew was stationed, and made her way thither at once. He did not at first recognize her, until she said:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good-morning, Thomas."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good-morning, aunt. What brings you here this morning? Any good news for me? Has the old gentleman come around and concluded to do something handsome?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mr. Wharton is not in the city. He has gone to Washington. But that isn't what I came about this morning. You remember that boy who has been reading to Mr. Wharton?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"One of our cash-boys. Yes; there he is, just gone by."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, he has stolen Mr. John's pocketbook and some jewelry belonging to him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What have you done about it? What does Mr. Wharton say?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He's away from home. He doesn't know yet. Mr. John gave him a lecture, and ordered him to leave the house."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Does he admit that he took the things?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No; he denied it as bold as brass, but it didn't do him any good. There were the things in his trunk. He couldn't get over that."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thomas fastened a shrewd glance on his aunt's face, for he suspected the truth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So you've got rid of him?" he said. "What do you propose to do next?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mr. John thinks your employer ought to know that he is a thief."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you going to tell them?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I want you to do it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You must tell them yourself, aunt. I shan't."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then introduce me to Mr. Gilbert, Thomas, and I'll do it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Follow me, aunt."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He led his aunt to the rear of the store, where Mr. Gilbert was standing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mr. Gilbert," he said, "allow me to introduce my aunt, Mrs. Bradley."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The housekeeper was courteously received, and invited to be seated. She soon opened her business, and blackened poor Frank's character as she had intended.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Really, Mrs. Bradley, I am sorry to hear this," said Mr. Gilbert. "You think there is no doubt of the boy's guilt?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am sorry to say that I have no doubt at all," said the housekeeper, hypocritically.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mr. Mack and myself have had a very good opinion of him. He is faithful and prompt."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course, sir, you will retain him in your employ if you are willing to take the risk, but I thought it my duty to put you on your guard."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am obliged to you, Mrs. Bradley; though, as I said, I regret to find that my confidence in the boy has been misplaced."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Late in the afternoon, Frank was called to the cashier's desk.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am directed by Mr. Gilbert to say that your services will not be required after to-day," he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here are the week's wages."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why am I discharged? What have I done?" demanded Frank, while his heart sank within him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know. You must ask Mr. Gilbert," answered the cashier.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will speak to him, at any rate," and Frank walked up to the senior partner, and addressed to him the same question.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Can you not guess?" asked Mr. Gilbert, sternly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can guess that a false accusation has been brought against me," said Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A respectable lady has informed me that you are not honest. I regret it, for I have been pleased with your diligence. Of course, I cannot retain you in my employ."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mr. Gilbert," said Frank, earnestly, "the charge is false. Mrs. Bradley is my enemy, and wishes me harm. I don't understand how the things came into my trunk, but I didn't put them there."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope you are innocent, but I must discharge you. Business is dull now, and I had decided to part with four of my cash-boys. I won't pass judgment upon you, but you must go."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank bowed in silence, for he saw that further entreaty would be vain, and left the store more dispirited than at any moment since he had been in the city.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ten days Frank spent in fruitless efforts to obtain a place.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">All this time his money steadily diminished. He perceived that he would soon be penniless. Evidently, something must be done. He formed two determinations. The first was to write to Mr. Wharton, who, he thought, must now have returned from Washington, asserting his innocence and appealing to him to see Gilbert &amp; Mack, and re-establish him in their confidence. The second was, since he could not obtain a regular place, to frequent the wharves and seek chances to carry bundles. In this way he might earn enough, with great economy, to pay for his board and lodging.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One morning the housekeeper entered the library where John Wade sat reading the daily papers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mr. John," she said, holding out a letter, "here is a letter from that boy. I expected he would write to your uncle."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">John Wade deliberately opened the letter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sit down, Mrs. Bradley, and I will read the letter aloud."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It will be only necessary to quote the concluding sentences:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `I hope, Mr. Wharton, you will not be influenced against me by what Mrs. Bradley and your nephew say. I don't know why it is, but they are my enemies, though I have always treated them with respect. I am afraid they have a desire to injure me in your estimation. If they had not been, they would have been content with driving me from your house, without also slandering me to my employers, and inducing them to discharge me. Since I was discharged, I have tried very hard to get another place, but as I cannot bring a recommendation from Gilbert &amp; Mack, I have everywhere been refused. I ask you, Mr. Wharton to consider my situation. Already my small supply of money is nearly gone, and I do not know how I am to pay my expenses. If it was any fault of mine that had brought me into this situation, I would not complain, but it seems hard to suffer when I am innocent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `I do not ask to return to your house, Mr. Wharton, for it would not be pleasant, since your nephew and Mrs. Bradley dislike me, but I have a right to ask that the truth may be told to my employers, so that if they do not wish me to return to their service, they may, at least, be willing to give me a recommendation that will give me a place elsewhere."'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I must prevent the boy communicating with my uncle, if it is a possible thing. `Strike while the iron is hot,' I say."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think that is very judicious, Mr. John. I have no doubt you will know how to manage matters."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">John Wade dressed himself for a walk, and drawing out a cigar, descended the steps of his uncle's house into the street.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He reached Fifth Avenue, and walked slowly downtown. He was about opposite Twenty-eighth Street, when he came face to face with the subject of his thoughts.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where are you going?" John Wade demanded sternly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know that I am bound to answer your question," answered Frank, quietly, "but I have no objection. I am going to Thirty-ninth Street with this bundle."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hark you, boy! I have something to say to you," continued John Wade, harshly. "You have had the impudence to write to my uncle."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What did he say?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nothing that you would like to hear. He looks upon you as a thief."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You have slandered me to him, Mr. Wade," he said, angrily. "You might be in better business than accusingly a poor boy falsely."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hark you, young man! I have had enough of your impudence. I will give you a bit of advice, which you will do well to follow. Leave this city for a place where you are not known, or I may feel disposed to shut you up on a charge of theft."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shall not leave the city, Mr. Wade," returned Frank, firmly. "I shall stay here in spite of you," and without waiting for an answer, he walked on.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XVI AN ACCOMPLICE FOUND</field>
      <field name="fulltext">No sooner had John Wade parted from our hero than he saw approaching him a dark, sinister-looking man, whom he had known years before.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good-morning, Mr. Wade," said the newcomer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good-morning, Mr. Graves. Are you busy just now?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, sir; I am out of employment. I have been unfortunate."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then I will give you a job. Do you see that boy?" said John Wade, rapidly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I see him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I want you to follow him. Find out where he lives, and let me know this evening. Do you understand?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I understand. You may rely upon me, sir," answered Nathan Graves; and quickening his pace, he soon came within a hundred feet of our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After fulfilling his errand, Frank walked downtown again, but did not succeed in obtaining any further employment. Wherever he went, he was followed by Graves. Unconsciously, he exhausted the patience of that gentleman, who got heartily tired of his tramp about the streets. But the longest day will come to an end, and at last he had the satisfaction of tracking Frank to his humble lodging. Then, and not till then, he felt justified in leaving him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nathan Graves sought the residence of John Wade. He rang the bell as the clock struck eight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, what success?" asked Wade, when they met.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have tracked the boy. What more can I do for you?" asked Graves.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I want to get him away from the city. The fact is—I may as well tell you—my uncle has taken a great fancy to the boy, and might be induced to adopt him, and cut me off from my rightful inheritance. The boy is an artful young rascal, and has been doing all he could to get into the good graces of my uncle, who is old and weak-minded."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was nine o'clock when Nathan Graves left the house, John Wade himself accompanying him to the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How soon do you think you can carry out my instructions?" asked Wade.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"To-morrow, if possible."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The sooner the better."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is lucky I fell in with him," said Nathan Graves to himself, with satisfaction, as he slowly walked down Fifth Avenue. "It's a queer business, but that's none of my business. The main thing for me to consider is that it brings money to my purse, and of that I have need enough."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Graves left the house richer by a hundred dollars than he entered it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was eleven o'clock on the forenoon of the next day when Frank walked up Canal Street toward Broadway. He had been down to the wharves since early in the morning, seeking for employment. He had offered his services to many, but as yet had been unable to secure a job.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As he was walking along a man addressed him:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Will you be kind enough to direct me to Broadway?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was Nathan Graves, with whom Frank was destined to have some unpleasant experiences.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Straight ahead," answered Frank. "I am going there, and will show you, if you like."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, I wish you would. I live only fifteen or twenty miles distant," said Graves, "but I don't often come to the city, and am not much acquainted. I keep a dry-goods store, but my partner generally comes here to buy goods. By the way, perhaps you can help me about the errand that calls me here today."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will, sir, if I can," said Frank, politely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My youngest clerk has just left me, and I want to find a successor—a boy about your age, say. Do you know any one who would like such a position?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am out of employment myself just now. Do you think I will suit?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think you will," said Mr. Graves.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You won't object to go into the country?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will give you five dollars a week and your board for the present. If you suit me, your pay will be raised at the end of six months. Will that be satisfactory?" asked his companion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Quite so, sir. When do you wish me to come?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Can you go out with me this afternoon?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir. I only want to go home and pack up my trunk."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"To save time, I will go with you, and we will start as soon as possible."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nathan Graves accompanied Frank to his room, where his scanty wardrobe was soon packed. A hack was called, and they were speedily on their way to the Cortland Street ferry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They crossed the ferry, and Mr. Graves purchased two tickets to Elizabeth. He bought a paper, and occupied himself in reading. Frank felt that fortune had begun to shine upon him once more. By and by, he could send for Grace, and get her boarded near him. As soon as his wages were raised, he determined to do this. While engaged in these pleasant speculations, they reached the station.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We get out here," said Mr. Graves.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is your store in this place?" asked Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No; it is in the next town."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nathan Graves looked about him for a conveyance. He finally drove a bargain with a man driving a shabby-looking vehicle, and the two took their seats.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They were driven about six miles through a flat, unpicturesque country, when they reached a branch road leading away from the main one.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was a narrow road, and apparently not much frequented. Frank could see no houses on either side</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is your store on this road?" he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, no; but I am not going to the store yet. We will go to my house, and leave your trunk."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At length the wagon stopped, by Graves' orders, in front of a gate hanging loosely by one hinge.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We'll get out here," said Graves.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank looked with some curiosity, and some disappointment, at his future home. It was a square, unpainted house, discolored by time, and looked far from attractive. There were no outward signs of occupation, and everything about it appeared to have fallen into decay. Not far off was a barn, looking even more dilapidated than the house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the front door, instead of knocking—there was no bell—Graves drew a rusty key from his pocket and inserted it in the lock. They found themselves in a small entry, uncarpeted and dingy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We'll go upstairs," said Graves.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Arrived on the landing, he threw open a door, and ushered in our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This will be your room," he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank looked around in dismay.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was a large, square room, uncarpeted, and containing only a bed, two chairs and a washstand, all of the cheapest and rudest manufacture.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope you will soon feel at home here," said Graves. "I'll go down and see if I can find something to eat."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He went out, locking the door behind him</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What does this mean?" thought Frank, with a strange sensation.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XVII FRANK AND HIS JAILER</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was twenty minutes before Frank, waiting impatiently, heard the steps of his late companion ascending the stairs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But the door was not unlocked. Instead, a slide was revealed, about eight inches square, through which his late traveling companion pushed a plate of cold meat and bread.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here's something to eat," he said; "take it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why do you lock me in?" demanded our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You can get along without knowing, I suppose," said the other, with a sneer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't mean to," said Frank, firmly. "I demand an explanation. How long do you intend to keep me here?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am sorry I can't gratify your curiosity, but I don't know myself."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps you think that I am rich, but I am not. I have no money. You can't get anything out of me," said Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That may be so, but I shall keep you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose that was all a lie about your keeping store?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It was a pretty little story, told for your amusement, my dear boy," said Graves. "I was afraid you wouldn't come without it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are a villain!" said Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Look here, boy," said Graves, in a different tone, his face darkening, "you had better not talk in that way. I advise you to eat your dinner and be quiet. Some supper will be brought to you before night."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So saying, he abruptly closed the slide, and descended the stairs, leaving Frank to his reflections, which it may be supposed, were not of the pleasantest character.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank did not allow his unpleasant situation to take away his appetite, and though he was fully determined to make the earliest possible attempt to escape, he was sensible enough first to eat the food which his jailer had brought him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His lunch dispatched, he began at once to revolve plans of escape.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There were three windows in the room, two on the front of the house, the other at the side.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He tried one after another, but the result was the same. All were so fastened that it was quite impossible to raise them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Feeling that he could probably escape through one of the windows when he pleased, though at the cost of considerable trouble, Frank did not trouble himself much, or allow himself to feel unhappy. He decided to continue his explorations.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the corner of the room was a door, probably admitting to a closet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose it is locked," thought Frank, but on trying it, he found that such was not the case. He looked curiously about him, but found little to repay him. His attention was drawn, however to several dark-colored masks lying upon a shelf.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He also discovered a small hole in the wall of the size of a marble. Actuated by curiosity, he applied his eye to the opening, and peeped into what was probably the adjoining room. It was furnished in very much the same way as the one in which he was confined, but at present it was untenanted. Having seen what little there was to be seen, Frank withdrew from his post of observation and returned to his room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was several hours later when he again heard steps ascending the stairs, and the slide in the door was moved.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He looked toward it, but the face that he saw was not that of Nathan Graves.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was the face of a woman.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPER XVIII "OVER THE HILL TO THE POORHOUSE"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We are compelled for a time to leave our hero in the hands of his enemies, and return to the town of Crawford, where an event has occurred which influences seriously the happiness and position of his sister, Grace.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ever since Frank left the town, Grace had been a welcome member of Mr. Pomeroy's family, receiving the kindest treatment from all, so that she had come to feel very much at home.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So they lived happily together, till one disastrous night a fire broke out, which consumed the house, and they were forced to snatch their clothes and escape, saving nothing else.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Pomeroy's house was insured for two-thirds of its value, and he proposed to rebuild immediately, but it would be three months at least before the new house would be completed. In the interim, he succeeded in hiring a couple of rooms for his family, but their narrow accommodations would oblige them to dispense with their boarder. Sorry as Mr. and Mrs. Pomeroy were to part with her, it was obvious that Grace must find another home.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We must let Frank know," said Mr. Pomeroy, and having occasion to go up to the city at once to see about insurance, he went to the store of Gilbert &amp; Mack, and inquired for Prank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Fowler? What was he?" was asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A cash-boy."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, he is no longer here. Mr. Gilbert discharged him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you know why he was discharged?" asked Mr. Pomeroy, pained and startled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No; but there stands Mr. Gilbert. He can tell you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Pomeroy introduced himself to the head of the firm and repeated his inquiry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you are a friend of the lad," said Mr. Gilbert, "you will be sorry to learn that he was charged with dishonesty. It was a very respectable lady who made the charge. It is only fair to say that the boy denied it, and that, personally, we found him faithful and trusty. But as the dullness of trade compelled us to discharge some of our cash-boys, we naturally discharged him among the number, without, however, judging his case."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then, sir, you have treated the boy very unfairly. On the strength of a charge not proved, you have dismissed him, though personally you had noticed nothing out of the way in him, and rendered it impossible for him to obtain another place."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There is something in what you say, I admit. Perhaps I was too hasty. If you will send the boy to me, I will take him back on probation."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, sir," said Mr. Pomeroy, gratefully "I will send him here."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But this Mr. Pomeroy was unable to do. He did not know of Frank's new address, and though he was still in the city, he failed to find him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He returned to Crawford and communicated the unsatisfactory intelligence. He tried to obtain a new boarding place for Grace, but no one was willing to take her at two dollars a week, especially when Mr. Pomeroy was compelled to admit that Frank was now out of employment, and it was doubtful if he would be able to keep up the payment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tom Pinkerton managed to learn that Grace was now without a home, and mentioned it to his father.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Won't she have to go to the poorhouse now, father?" he asked eagerly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said Deacon Pinkerton. "There is no other place for her that I can see."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ah, I'm glad," said Tom, maliciously. "Won't that upstart's pride be taken down? He was too proud to go to the poorhouse, where he belonged, but he can't help his sister's going there. If he isn't a pauper himself, he'll be the brother of a pauper, and that's the next thing to it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That is true," said the deacon. "He was very impudent in return for my kindness. Still, I am sorry for him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I am afraid the deacon's sorrow was not very deep, for he certainly looked unusually cheerful when he harnessed up his horse and drove around to the temporary home of the Pomeroys.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good-morning, Mr. Pomeroy," he said, seeing the latter in the yard. "You've met with a severe loss."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, deacon; it is a severe loss to a poor man like me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"To be sure. Well, I've called around to relieve you of a part of your cares. I am going to take Grace Fowler to the poorhouse."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Couldn't you get her a place with a private family to help about the house in return for her board, while she goes to school?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There's nobody wants a young girl like her," said the deacon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Her brother would pay part of her board—that is, when he has a place."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hasn't he got a place?" asked the deacon, pricking up his ears. "I heard he was in a store in New York."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He lost his place," said Mr. Pomeroy, reluctantly, "partly because of the dullness of general trade."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then he can't maintain his sister. She will have to go to the poorhouse. Will you ask her to get ready, and I'll take her right over to the poorhouse."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was no alternative. Mr. Pomeroy went into the house, and broke the sad news to his wife and Grace.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Never mind," she said, with attempted cheerfulness, though her lips quivered, "I shan't have to stay there long. Frank will be sure to send for me very shortly."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's too bad, Grace," said Sam, looking red about the eyes; "it's too bad that you should have to go to the poorhouse."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come and see me, Sam," said Grace.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I will, Grace. I'll come often, too. You shan't stay there long."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good-by," said Grace, faltering. "You have all been very kind to me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good-by, my dear child," said Mrs. Pomeroy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Who knows but you can return to us when the new house is done?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So poor Grace went out from her pleasant home to find the deacon, grim-faced and stern, waiting for her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Jump in, little girl," he said. "You've kept me waiting for you a long time, and my time is valuable."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The distance to the poorhouse was about a mile and a half. For the first half mile Deacon Pinkerton kept silence. Then he began to speak, in a tone of cold condescension, as if it were a favor for such a superior being to address an insignificant child, about to become a pauper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Little girl, have you heard from your brother lately?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not very lately, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What is he doing?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He is in a store."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I apprehend you are mistaken. He has lost his place. He has been turned away," said the deacon, with satisfaction."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Frank turned away! Oh, sir, you must be mistaken."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mr. Pomeroy told me. He found out yesterday when he went to the city."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Poor Grace! she could not longer doubt now, and her brother's misfortune saddened her even more than her own.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Probably you will soon see your brother."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, do you think so, sir?" asked Grace, joyfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," answered the deacon, grimly. "He will find himself in danger of starvation in the city, and he'll creep back, only too glad to obtain a nice, comfortable home in the poorhouse."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But Grace knew her brother better than that. She knew his courage, his self-reliance and his independent spirit, and she was sure the deacon was mistaken.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The home for which Grace was expected to be so grateful was now in sight. It was a dark, neglected looking house, situated in the midst of barren fields, and had a lonely and desolate aspect. It was superintended by Mr. and Mrs. Chase, distant relations of Deacon Pinkerton.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Chase was an inoffensive man, but Mrs. Chase had a violent temper. She was at work in the kitchen when Deacon Pinkerton drove up. Hearing the sound of wheels, she came to the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mrs. Chase," said the deacon, "I've brought you a little girl, to be placed under your care."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's her name?" inquired the lady.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Grace Fowler."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Grace, humph! Why didn't she have a decent name?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You can call her anything you like," said the deacon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Little girl, you must behave well," said Deacon Pinkerton, by way of parting admonition. "The town expects it. I expect it. You must never cease to be grateful for the good home which it provides you free of expense."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Grace did not reply. Looking in the face of her future task-mistress was scarcely calculated to awaken a very deep feeling of gratitude.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now," said Mrs. Chase, addressing her new boarder, "just take off your things, Betsy, and make yourself useful."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My name isn't Betsy, ma'am."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It isn't, isn't it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No; it is Grace."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You don't say so! I'll tell you one thing, I shan't allow anybody to contradict me here, and your name's got to be Betsy while you're in this house. Now take off your things and hang them up on that peg. I'm going to set you right to work."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, ma'am," said Grace, alarmed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There's some dishes I want washed, Betsy, and I won't have you loitering over your work, neither."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very well, ma'am."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Such was the new home for which poor Grace was expected to be grateful.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XIX WHAT FRANK HEARD THROUGH THE CREVICE</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank looked with some surprise at the woman who was looking through the slide of his door. He had expected to see Nathan Graves. She also regarded him with interest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have brought you some supper," she said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank reached out and drew in a small waiter, containing a cup of tea and a plate of toast.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you," he said. "Where is the man who brought me here?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He has gone out."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you know why he keeps me here in confinement?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," said the woman, hastily. "I know nothing. I see much, but I know nothing."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are many prisoners brought here as I have been?" asked our hero, in spite of the woman's refusal to speak.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can't understand what object they can have in detaining me. If I were rich, I might guess, but I am poor. I am compelled to work for my daily bread, and have been out of a place for two weeks."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't understand," she said, in a low voice, rather to herself than to him. "But I cannot wait. I must not stand here. I will come up in fifteen minutes, and if you wish another cup of tea, or some toast, I will bring them."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His confinement did not affect his appetite, for he enjoyed his tea and toast; and when, as she had promised, the woman came up, he told her he would like another cup of tea, and some more toast.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Will you answer one question?" asked our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know," answered the woman in a flurried tone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You look like a good woman. Why do you stay in such a house as this?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will tell you, though I should do better to be silent. But you won't betray me?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"On no account."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I was poor, starving, when I had an application to come here. The man who engaged me told me that it was to be a housekeeper, and I had no suspicion of the character of the house—that it was a den of—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She stopped short, but Frank understood what she would have said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"When I discovered the character of the house, I would have left but for two reasons. First, I had no other home; next, I had become acquainted with the secrets of the house, and they would have feared that I would reveal them. I should incur great risk. So I stayed."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here there was a sound below. The woman started.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Some one has come," she said. "I must go down I will come up as soon as I can with the rest of your supper."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you. You need not hurry."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Our hero was left to ponder over what he had heard. There was evidently a mystery connected with this lonely house a mystery which he very much desired to solve. But there was one chance. Through the aperture in the closet he might both see and hear something, provided any should meet there that evening.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The remainder of his supper was brought him by the same woman, but she was in haste, and he obtained no opportunity of exchanging another word with her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank did not learn who it was that had arrived. Listening intently, he thought he heard some sounds in the next room. Opening the closet door, and applying his eye to the aperture, he saw two men seated in the room, one of whom was the man who had brought him there.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He applied his ear to the opening, and heard the following conversation:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hear you've brought a boy here, Nathan," said the other, who was a stout, low-browed man, with an evil look.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said Graves, with a smile; "I am going to board him here a while."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's it all about? What are you going to gain by it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll tell you all I know. I've known something of the family for a long time. John Wade employed me long ago. The old millionaire had a son who went abroad and died there. His cousin, John Wade, brought home his son—a mere baby—the old man's grandson, of course, and sole heir, or likely to be, to the old man's wealth, if he had lived. In that case, John Wade would have been left out in the cold, or put off with a small bequest."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. Did the boy live?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No; he died, very conveniently for John Wade, and thus removed the only obstacle from his path."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very convenient. Do you think there was any foul play?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There may have been."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But I should think the old man would have suspected."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He was away at the time. When he returned to the city, he heard from his nephew that the boy was dead. It was a great blow to him, of course. Now, I'll tell you what," said Graves, sinking his voice so that Frank found it difficult to hear, "I'll tell you what I've thought at times."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think the grandson may have been spirited off somewhere. Nothing more easy, you know. Murder is a risky operation, and John Wade is respectable, and wouldn't want to run the risk of a halter."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You may be right. You don't connect this story of yours with the boy you've brought here, do you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I do," answered Graves, emphatically. "I shouldn't be surprised if this was the very boy!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What makes you think so?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"First, because there's some resemblance between the boy and the old man's son, as I remember him. Next, it would explain John Wade's anxiety to get rid of him. It's my belief that John Wade has recognized in this boy the baby he got rid of fourteen years ago, and is afraid his uncle will make the same discovery."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank left the crevice through which he had received so much information in a whirl of new and bewildering thoughts.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Was it possible," he asked himself, "that he could be the grandson of Mr. Wharton, his kind benefactor?"</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XX THE ESCAPE</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was eight o'clock the next morning before Frank's breakfast was brought to him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am sorry you have had to wait," the housekeeper said, as she appeared at the door with a cup of coffee and a plate of beefsteak and toast, "I couldn't come up before."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have the men gone away?" said Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then I have something to tell you. I learned something about myself last night. I was in the closet, and heard the man who brought me here talking to another person. May I tell you the story?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you think it will do any good," said the housekeeper, but I can't help you if that is what you want."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He told the whole story. As he proceeded, the housekeeper betrayed increased, almost eager interest, and from time to time asked him questions in particular as to the personal appearance of John Wade. When Frank had described him as well as he could, she said, in an excited manner:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, it is—it must be the same man."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The same man!" repeated our hero, in surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you know anything about him?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know that he is a wicked man. I am afraid that I have helped him carry out his wicked plan, but I did not know it at the time, or I never would have given my consent."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't understand you," said our hero, puzzled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Will you tell me what you mean?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Fourteen years ago I was very poor—poor and sick besides. My husband had died, leaving me nothing but the care of a young infant, whom it was necessary for me to support besides myself. Enfeebled by sickness, I was able to earn but little, but we lived in a wretched room in a crowded tenement house. My infant boy was taken sick and died. As I sat sorrowfully beside the bed on which he lay dead, I heard a knock at the door. I opened it, and admitted a man whom I afterward learned to be John Wade. He very soon explained his errand. He agreed to take my poor boy, and pay all the expenses of his burial in Greenwood Cemetery, provided I would not object to any of his arrangements. He was willing besides to pay me two hundred dollars for the relief of my necessities. Though I was almost beside myself with grief for my child's loss, and though this was a very favorable proposal, I hesitated. I could not understand why a stranger should make me such an offer. I asked him the reason."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `You ask too much,' he answered, appearing annoyed. `I have made you a fair offer. Will you accept it, or will you leave your child to have a pauper's funeral?'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That consideration decided me. For my child's sake I agreed to his proposal, and forebore to question him further. He provided a handsome rosewood casket for my dear child, but upon the silver plate was inscribed a name that was strange to me —the name of Francis Wharton."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Francis Wharton!" exclaimed Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I was too weak and sorrowful to make opposition, and my baby was buried as Francis Wharton. Not only this, but a monument is erected over him at Greenwood, which bears this name."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She proceeded after a pause:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I did not then understand his object. Your story makes it clear. I think that you are that Francis Wharton, under whose name my boy was buried."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How strange!" said Frank, thoughtfully. "I cannot realize it. But how did you know the name of the man who called upon you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A card slipped from his pocket, which I secured without his knowledge."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How fortunate that I met you," said Frank. "I mean to let Mr. Wharton know all that I have learned, and then he shall decide whether he will recognize me or not as his grandson."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have been the means of helping to deprive you of your just rights, though unconsciously. Now that I know the wicked conspiracy in which I assisted, I will help undo the work."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you," said Frank. "The first thing is to get out of this place."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I cannot open the door of your room. They do not trust me with the key."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The windows are not very high from the ground. I can get down from the outside."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will bring you a clothesline and a hatchet."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank received them with exultation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Before I attempt to escape," he said, "tell me where I can meet you in New York. I want you to go with me to Mr. Wharton's. I shall need you to confirm my story."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will meet you to-morrow at No. 15 B—Street."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then we shall meet to-morrow. What shall I call your name?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mrs. Parker."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you. I will get away as quickly as possible, and when we are in the city we will talk over our future plans."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With the help of the hatchet, Frank soon demolished the lower part of the window. Fastening the rope to the bedstead, he got out of the window and safely descended to the ground.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A long and fatiguing walk lay before him. But at last he reached the cars, and half an hour later the ferry at Jersey City.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank thought himself out of danger for the time being, but he was mistaken.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Standing on the deck of the ferryboat, and looking back to the pier from which he had just started, he met the glance of a man who had intended to take the same boat, but had reached the pier just too late. His heart beat quicker when he recognized in the belated passenger his late jailer, Nathan Graves.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carried away by his rage and disappointment, Nathan Graves clenched his fist and shook it at his receding victim.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Our hero walked into the cabin. He wanted a chance to deliberate. He knew that Nathan Graves would follow him by the next boat, and it was important that he should not find him. Where was he to go?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fifteen minutes after Frank set foot on the pier, his enemy also landed. But now the difficult part of the pursuit began. He had absolutely no clew as to the direction which Frank had taken.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For an hour and a half he walked the streets in the immediate neighborhood of the square, but his labor was without reward. Not a glimpse could he catch of his late prisoner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose I must go to see Mr. Wade," he at last reluctantly decided. "He may be angry, but he can't blame me. I did my best. I couldn't stand guard over the young rascal all day."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The address which the housekeeper had given Frank was that of a policeman's family in which she was at one time a boarder. On giving his reference, he was hospitably received, and succeeded in making arrangements for a temporary residence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">About seven o'clock Mrs. Parker made her appearance. She wag fatigued by her journey and glad to rest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I was afraid you might be prevented from coming," said Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I feared it also. I was about to start at twelve o'clock, when, to my dismay, one of the men came home. He said he had the headache. I was obliged to make him some tea and toast. He remained about till four o'clock, when, to my relief, he went upstairs to lie down. I was afraid some inquiry might be made about you, and your absence discovered, especially as the rope was still hanging out of the window, and I was unable to do anything more than cut off the lower end of it. When the sick man retired to his bed I instantly left the house, fearing that the return of some other of the band might prevent my escaping altogether."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Suppose you had met one of them, Mrs. Parker?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I did. It was about half a mile from the house."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did he recognize you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. He asked in some surprise where I was going. I was obliged to make up a story about our being out of sugar. He accepted it without suspicion, and I kept on. I hope I shall be forgiven for the lie. I was forced to it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You met no further trouble?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I must tell you of my adventure," said Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I came across the very man whom I most dreaded— the man who made me a prisoner."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Since he knows that you have escaped, he is probably on your track," said Mrs. Parker. "It will be hardly safe for you to go to Mr. Wharton's."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He will probably think you likely to go there, and be lying in wait somewhere about."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But I must go to Mr. Wharton," said Frank. "I must tell him this story."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It will be safer to write."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The housekeeper, Mrs. Bradley, or John Wade, will get hold of the letter and suppress it. I don't want to put them on their guard."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are right. It is necessary to be cautious."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You see I am obliged to call on my grandfather, that is, on Mr. Wharton."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can think of a better plan."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What is it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Go to a respectable lawyer. Tell him your story, and place your case in his hands. He will write to your grandfather, inviting him to call at his office on business of importance, without letting him know what is the nature of it. You and I can be there to meet him, and tell our story. In this way John Wade will know nothing, and learn nothing, of your movements."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That is good advice, Mrs. Parker, but there is one thing you have not thought of," said our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What is that?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Lawyers charge a great deal for their services, and I have no money."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You have what is as good a recommendation—a good case. The lawyer will see at once that if not at present rich, you stand a good chance of obtaining a position which will make you so. Besides, your grandfather will be willing, if he admits your claim, to recompense the lawyer handsomely."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I did not think of that. I will do as you advise to-morrow."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXI JOHN WADE'S DISAPPOINTMENT</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Wharton sat at dinner with his nephew and the housekeeper. He had been at home for some time, and of course on his arrival had been greeted with the news of our hero's perfidy. But, to the indignation of Mrs. Bradley and John, he was obstinately incredulous.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There is some mistake, I am sure," he said. "Such a boy as Frank is incapable of stealing. You may be mistaken after all, John. Why did you not let him stay till I got back? I should like to have examined him myself."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I was so angry with him for repaying your kindness in such a way that I instantly ordered him out of the house."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I blame you, John, for your haste," said his uncle. "It was not just to the boy."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I acted for the best, sir," he forced himself to say in a subdued tone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Young people are apt to be impetuous, and I excuse you; but you should have waited for my return. I will call at Gilbert &amp; Mack's, and inquire of Frank himself what explanation he has to give."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course, sir, you will do what you think proper," said his nephew.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This ended the conversation, and Mr. Wharton, according to his declared intention, went to Gilbert &amp; Mack's. He returned disappointed with the information that our hero was no longer in the store.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I now return to Mr. Wharton at dinner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here is a letter for you, sir," said the housekeeper. "It was brought by the postman this afternoon."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Wharton adjusted his spectacles and read as follows:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No. — Wall Street.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Dear Sir: Will you have the kindness to call at my office to-morrow morning at eleven o'clock, if it suits your convenience? I have an important communication to make to you, which will, I think be of an agreeable character. Should the time named not suit you, will you have the kindness to name your own time?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yours respectfully, "MORRIS HALL."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Read that, John," said his uncle, passing him the letter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Morris Hall is a lawyer, I believe, sir," said John.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you any idea of the nature of the communication he desires to make?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No idea at all."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If it would relieve you, sir, I will go in your place," said John, whose curiosity was aroused.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, John, but this is evidently a personal matter. I shall go down there to-morrow at the appointed time."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">John was far from suspecting that the communication related to Frank, though he had heard the day previous from Nathan Graves of the boy's escape. He had been very much annoyed, and had given his agent a severe scolding, with imperative orders to recapture the boy, if possible.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was not without a feeling of curiosity that Mr. Wharton entered the law office of Mr. Hall. He announced himself and was cordially welcomed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You have a communication to make to me," said Mr. Wharton.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Tell me all without delay."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will, sir. This is the communication I desire to make."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The story of John Wade's treachery was told, and the means by which he had imposed upon his uncle, but the lawyer carefully abstained from identifying the lost grandson with Frank Fowler.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When the story was concluded, Mr. Wharton said:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where is my grandson—my poor George's boy? Find him for me, and name your own reward."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will show him to you at once, sir. Frank!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the word, Frank, who was in an inner office. entered. Mr. Wharton started in amazement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Frank!" he exclaimed. "My dear boy, is it you who are my grandson?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Grandfather!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Wharton held out his arms, and our hero, already attached to him for his kindness, was folded in close embrace.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then you believe I am your grandson?" said Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I believe it without further proof."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Still, Mr. Wharton," said the lawyer, "I want to submit my whole proof. Mrs. Parker!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Parker entered and detailed her part in the plot, which for fourteen years had separated Frank from his family.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Enough!" said Mr. Wharton. "I am convinced— I did not believe my nephew capable of such baseness. Mrs. Parker, you shall not regret your confession. I will give you a pension which will relieve you from all fear of want. Call next week on Mr. Hall, and you shall learn what provision I have made for you. You, Frank, will return with me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What will Mr. John say?" asked Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He shall no longer sleep under my roof," said Mr. Wharton, sternly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank was taken to a tailor and fitted out with a handsome new suit, ready-made for immediate use, while three more were ordered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Mr. Wharton reached home, he entered the library and rang the bell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the servant who answered he said:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is Mr. John at home?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir; he came in ten minutes ago."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Tell him I wish to see him at once in the library. Summon the housekeeper, also."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Surprised at the summons, John Wade answered it directly. He and Mrs. Bradley met at the door and entered together. Their surprise and dismay may be conjectured when they saw our hero seated beside Mr. Wharton, dressed like a young gentleman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"John Wade," said his uncle, sternly, "the boy whom you malign, the boy you have so deeply wronged, has found a permanent home in this house."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What, sir! you take him back?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I do. There is no more fitting place for him than the house of his grandfather."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"His grandfather!" exclaimed his nephew and the housekeeper, in chorus.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have abundant proof of the relationship. This morning I have listened to the story of your treachery. I have seen the woman whose son, represented to me as my grandson, lies in Greenwood Cemetery. I have learned your wicked plans to defraud him of his inheritance, and I tell you that you have failed."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shall make my will to-morrow, bequeathing all my property to my grandson, excepting only an annual income of two thousand dollars to yourself. And now I must trouble you to find a boarding place. After what has passed I do not desire to have you in the family."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I do not believe he is your grandson," said John Wade, too angry to heed prudential considerations.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Your opinion is of little consequence."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then, sir, I have only to wish you good-morning. I will send for my trunks during the day."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good-morning," said Mr. Wharton, gravely, and John Wade left the room, baffled and humiliated.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope, sir," said the housekeeper, alarmed for her position; "I hope you don't think I knew Mr. Frank was your grandson. I never was so astonished and flustrated in my life. I hope you won't discharge me, sir—me that have served you so faithfully for many years."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You shall remain on probation. But if Frank ever has any fault to find with you, you must go."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope you will forgive me, Mr. Frank."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I forgive you freely," said our hero, who was at a generous disposition.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXII CONCLUSION</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Meanwhile poor Grace had fared badly at the poorhouse in Crawford. It was a sad contrast to the gentle and kindly circle at Mr. Pomeroy's. What made it worse for Grace was, that she could hear nothing of Frank. She feared he was sick, or had met with some great misfortune, which prevented his writing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One day a handsome carriage drove up to the door. From it descended our hero, elegantly attired. He knocked at the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Chase, who was impressed by wealth, came to the door in a flutter of respect, induced by the handsome carriage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What do you wish, sir?" she asked, not recognizing Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Miss Grace Fowler!" repeated Mrs. Chase, almost paralyzed at Grace being called for by such stylish acquaintances</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, my sister Grace."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What! are you Frank Fowler?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. I have come to take Grace away."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know as I have the right to let her go," said Mrs. Chase, cautiously, regretting that Grace was likely to escape her clutches.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here is an order from Deacon Pinkerton, chairman of the overseers of the poor."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That is sufficient. She can go. You look as if you had prospered in the city," she added, with curiosity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. I have found my grandfather, who is very wealthy."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You don't say!" ejaculated Mrs. Chase. "I'll tell Grace at once."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Grace at work in the kitchen had not heard of the arrival. What was her surprise when Mrs. Chase, entering the room, said, graciously:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Go up at once, Grace, and change your clothes. Your brother has come for you. He is going to take you away."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Grace almost gasped for breath.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is it true?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is indeed. Your brother looks remarkably well. He is rich. He has found a rich grandfather, and has come for you in a carriage."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In amazed bewilderment Grace went upstairs and put on her best dress, poor enough in comparison with her brother's clothes, and was soon happy in his embrace.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am glad to see you, my dear child," said Mr. Wharton, who had accompanied Frank. "Will you come to the city and live with me and your brother?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, sir, I shall be glad to be wherever Frank is."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good-bye, my dear child," sand Mrs. Chase, whose feelings were very much changed, now that Grace was a rich young lady. "Come and see me some time."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, Mrs. Chase. Good-bye!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The carriage rolled on. * * * * * * *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A few words only remain. Our hero was placed at a classical school, and in due time entered college, where he acquitted himself with distinction. He is now making a tour of Europe. Grace was also placed at an excellent school, and has developed into a handsome and accomplished young lady. It is thought she will marry Sam Pomeroy, who obtained a place in a counting-room through Mr. Wharton's influence, and is now head clerk, with a prospect of partnership. His father received a gift of five thousand dollars from Mr. Wharton as an acknowledgment of his kindness to Frank. Tom Pinkerton holds a subordinate clerkship in the same house, and is obliged to look up to Sam as his superior. It chafes his pride, but his father has become a poor man, and Tom is too prudent to run the risk of losing his situation. John Wade draws his income regularly, but he is never seen at his uncle's house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Wharton is very happy in his grandson, and made happier by the intelligence just received from Europe of Frank's engagement to a brilliant young New York lady whom he met in his travels. He bids fair, though advanced in age, to live some years yet, to witness the happiness of his dear grandson, once a humble cash-boy.</field>
