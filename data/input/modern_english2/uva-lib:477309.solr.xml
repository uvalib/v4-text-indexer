      <field name="fulltext">Watercolor of the Flopsy bunnies being "soporific" and sleepy sitting under a head of lettuce after eating it. Text page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IT is said that the effect of eating too much lettuce is "soporific.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I have never felt sleepy after eating lettuces; but then I am not a rabbit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They certainly had a very soporific effect upon the Flopsy Bunnies! Text page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">WHEN Benjamin Bunny grew up, he married his Cousin Flopsy. They had a large family, and they were very improvident and cheerful.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I do not remember the separate names of their children; they were generally called the "Flopsy Bunnies.''

      <field name="fulltext">AS there was not always quite enough to eat,— Benjamin used to borrow cabbages from Flopsy's brother, Peter Rabbit, who kept a nursery garden. Text page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SOMETIMES Peter Rabbit had no cabbages to spare. Watercolor illustration; Mr. and Mrs. Rabbit in their garden with no cabbages to spare the Flopsy Bunnies Blank Page. Blank Page. Watercolor of Flopsy Bunnies going to Mr. McGregor's rubbish heap Text page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">WHEN this happened, the Flopsy Bunnies went across the field to a rubbish heap, in the ditch outside Mr. McGregor's garden. Text page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MR. McGREGOR'S rubbish heap was a mixture. There were jam pots and paper bags, and mountains of chopped grass from the mowing machine (which always tasted oily), and some rotten vegetable marrows and an old boot or two. One day—oh joy!—there were a quantity of overgrown lettuces, which had "shot'' into flower. Watercolor of Flopsy Bunnies gnawing on overgrown lettuce Blank Page. Blank Page. Watercolor of Flopsy Bunnies overcome by lettuce-gluttony and falling into slothful slumber. Text page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE Flopsy Bunnies simply stuffed lettuces. By degrees, one after another, they were overcome with slumber, and lay down in the mown grass.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Benjamin was not so much overcome as his children. Before going to sleep he was sufficiently wide awake to put a paper bag over his head to keep off the flies. Text page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE little Flopsy Bunnies slept delightfully in the warm sun. From the lawn beyond the garden came the distant clacketty sound of the mowing machine. The blue- bottles buzzed about the wall, and a little old mouse picked over the rubbish among the jam pots.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">(I can tell you her name, she was called Thomasina Tittlemouse, a woodmouse with a long tail.)

      <field name="fulltext">SHE rustled across the paper bag, and awakened Benjamin Bunny.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The mouse apologized profusely, and said that she knew Peter Rabbit. Text page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">WHILE she and Benjamin were talking, close under the wall, they heard a heavy tread above their heads; and suddenly Mr. McGregor emptied out a sackful of lawn mowings right upon the top of the sleeping Flopsy Bunnies! Benjamin shrank down under his paper bag. The mouse hid in a jam pot. Mr. McGregor's boots and rubbish dumped on top of the mouse and Benjamin Bunny Blank Page. Blank Page. Mr. McGregor's boots and rubbish dumped on top of the mouse and Benjamin Bunny Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE little rabbits smiled sweetly in their sleep under the shower of grass; they did not awake because the lettuces had been so soporific.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They dreamt that their mother Flopsy was tucking them up in a hay bed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. McGregor looked down after emptying his sack. He saw some funny little brown tips of ears sticking up through the lawn mowings. He stared at them for some time. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PRESENTLY a fly settled on one of them and it moved.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. McGregor climbed down on to the rubbish heap—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"One, two, three, four! five! six leetle rabbits!'' said he as he dropped them into his sack. The Flopsy Bunnies dreamt that their mother was turning them over in bed. They stirred a little in their sleep, but still they did not wake up. Mr. McGregor's hands placing the slumbering bunnies into a burlap bag. Blank Page. Blank Page.

      <field name="fulltext">MR. McGREGOR tied up the sack and left it on the wall.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He went to put away the mowing machine. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">WHILE he was gone, Mrs. Flopsy Bunny (who had remained at home) came across the field.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She looked suspiciously at the sack and wondered where everybody was?

      <field name="fulltext">THEN the mouse came out of her jam pot, and Benjamin took the paper bag off his head, and they told the doleful tale.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Benjamin and Flopsy were in despair, they could not undo the string.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But Mrs. Tittlemouse was a resourceful person. She nibbled a hole in the bottom corner of the sack. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE little rabbits were pulled out and pinched to wake them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Their parents stuffed the empty sack with three rotten vegetable marrows, an old blacking-brush and two decayed turnips.

      <field name="fulltext">THEN they all hid under a bush and watched for Mr. McGregor. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MR. McGREGOR came back and picked up the sack, and carried it off.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He carried it hanging down, as if it were rather heavy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Flopsy Bunnies followed at a safe distance. Flopsy Bunnies following Mr. McGregor at a safe distance through his garden. Blank Page. Blank Page. The Flopsy Bunnies, on the path through the McGregor garden, watch Mr. McGregor go into his house. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THEY watched him go into his house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And then they crept up to the window to listen. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MR. McGREGOR threw down the sack on the stone floor in a way that would have been extremely painful to the Flopsy Bunnies, if they had happened to have been inside it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They could hear him drag his chair on the flags, and chuckle—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"One, two, three, four, five, six leetle rabbits!'' said Mr. McGregor. Watercolor of Flopsy Bunnies outside Mr. McGregor's farmhouse waiting. Blank Page. Blank Page. Watercolor of the Flopsy Bunnies peering through the window. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"EH? What's that? What have they been spoiling now?'' enquired Mrs. McGregor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"One, two, three, four, five, six leetle fat rabbits!'' repeated Mr. McGregor, counting on his fingers—"one, two, three—''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't you be silly; what do you mean, you silly old man?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"In the sack! one, two, three, four, five, six!'' replied Mr. McGregor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">(The youngest Flopsy Bunny got upon the window-sill.) Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MRS. McGREGOR took hold of the sack and felt it. She said she could feel six, but they must be old rabbits, because they were so hard and all different shapes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not fit to eat; but the skins will do fine to line my old cloak.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Line your old cloak?'' shouted Mr. McGregor—"I shall sell them and buy myself baccy!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Rabbit tobacco! I shall skin them and cut off their heads.'' Watercolor of Flopsy Bunnies in the window behind a red geranium flowering plants Blank Page. Blank Page. Watercolor rear-view of the Flopsy Bunnies looking in through the window at the McGregor's dismay Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MRS. McGREGOR untied the sack and put her hand inside.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When she felt the vegetables she became very very angry. She said that Mr. McGregor had "done it a purpose.'' Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">AND Mr. McGregor was very angry too. One of the rotten marrows came flying through the kitchen window, and hit the youngest Flopsy Bunny.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was rather hurt. Watercolor of the youngest Flopsy Bunny getting hit by a rotten vegetable marrow thrown in a fit of McGregor rage. Blank Page. Blank Page. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THEN Benjamin and Flopsy thought that it was time to go home. Watercolor of the Flopsy Bunnies running home through the McGregor garden. Blank Page. Blank Page. Watercolor of Thomasina Tittlemouse wearing a rabbit-wool coat. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SO Mr. McGregor did not get his tobacco, and Mrs. McGregor did not get her rabbit skins.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But next Christmas Thomasina Tittlemouse got a present of enough rabbit-wool to make herself a cloak and a hood, and a handsome muff and a pair of warm mittens.</field>
