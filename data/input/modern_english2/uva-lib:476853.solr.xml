      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER I. THE COLONY BILLS. THE PROVINCE BILLS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We are so thoroughly accustomed to the use of paper money that it is difficult to realize that a little over two centuries ago, when the Assembly of the Colony of the Massachusetts Bay first authorized the emission of bills of public credit, they were securing for themselves the right to claim that they were practically the pioneers in a great economic experiment. Writers upon the subject of money tell us that at that time China had already undergone a prolonged experience of the use of a representative paper currency, but in the condition of travel in the latter part of the seventeenth century no experiment in the Orient could have made any impression upon the financiers of Europe, still less was it possible that it could have had any effect in New England. Instances are alleged of the temporary use of paper money in Leyden in the sixteenth century, and in Cyprus at a still earlier date. Concerning these little is known now, perhaps nothing was known in England in 1700. In measuring the value of precedents which may have influenced our ancestors in their belief that they could sustain a paper currency based upon public credit, we ought only to consider such as could have been brought to their knowledge, and in estimating the value of any precedent, its publicity must be considered. The situation in 1690 was practically as follows: The banks upon the continent, whose experience furnished the men of that day with such knowledge of banking as they had at their command, were banks of deposit. The merchant who left with them the degraded coin then in circulation received in return therefor an equivalent "bank credit" expressed in terms of the standard coinage adopted by the bank. He adjusted his settlements with his creditors by means of transfers of account, and these transfers were supposed to be made at the bank. The theoretical advantage of the bank credit to the merchant was to be found in the establishment of a value for his available funds in terms of standard coins, and in the avoidance of the expenses attendant upon the transportation of specie. Towards the end of the seventeenth century the claim was advanced that these bank deposits were also advantageous to the community because the use of money was thereby multiplied. This argument was based upon the beneficial results which were to be traced to the continental banks, the Bank of Amsterdam being the example most familiar to English writers. In the light of later developments we know that the theory that the deposits of that bank were kept intact was not well founded. The managers of the bank, relying upon the permanence of their custody, made use of the deposits, and it was through this use that the power of the deposited coin was increased. Contemporary writers on the subject of banking do not, as a rule, seem to have appreciated this fact. They looked for an increase of the power of money through its accumulation in the vaults of a bank, without seeking to explain why this should be. One author in the latter part of the seventeenth century plainly saw the weakness of this position, and in his argument in favor of a bank of deposit in London he pointed out that under proper guarantees the deposits thus gathered into the custody of a bank might be utilized by the managers of the institution. [1]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The proposition to establish a bank of deposit did not carry with it any idea of making it a bank of issue nor of utilizing the deposits in any way. It is clear, however, that at an early date the custom of transferring "accounts in bank" by means of bills of exchange, money orders or checks, thus obviating the necessity of personal attendance at the counter of the bank, must have found its way into practice. This would of itself have furnished a form for the circulation of the bank credit in a limited way among merchants, which would have tended to familiarize them with the use of paper as a representative of money. The growth of practices of this sort is hinted at in the propositions for banks submitted in England during the seventeenth century and in the customs of the goldsmiths in London, where these tradesmen acted as the "cashkeepers" for the public. The fact that the London goldsmiths then furnished their customers with their individual notes, and that these notes had a certain field in which they were current, seems to be well established. It may be doubted, however, whether the founders of the Bank of England, in 1694, had before them any other well defined precedents upon which to base an opinion as to the probable success of paper-money, than were to be found in the ordinary mercantile bills of exchange, the goldsmiths' notes, and the bills of public credit of the Colony of the Massachusetts Bay. It is true that in addition to the cases already stated in which paper-money is said to have been used prior to this time, the claim has been advanced that an experiment in that line was made in Sweden in the middle of the seventeenth century; that at some period of its existence the Bank of Venice emitted bills, and that the Bank of Genoa had also done the same thing. So far as we can judge concerning the alleged paper-money of the Italian banks, it would seem as if the references to the supposed emissions of these banks must have been intended to apply to the paper of their customers, based upon their bank credits. If, however, it should prove that either of these claims is authentic, and if any knowledge thereof could be brought home to the founders of the Bank of England, the fact would still remain that the event made so little impression upon the history of the times that it would have to be classed among unsuccessful experiments which were ephemeral in their nature. The one positive success in furnishing a people with paper money in the way of a circulating medium, knowledge of which was plainly accessible to English financiers, was to be found in the experience of the colony of the Massachusetts Bay. It is of interest, therefore, to trace the sources of knowledge or experience upon which the legislators of that colony could have founded an experiment so novel in its character.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The social and economic conditions under which it was made were widely different from those existing at that time in England. There were many in the colony still living, who remembered when all trade was conducted by barter, when corn was used for money, and when compulsory resort was had to wampum for a medium for trade and to bullets as a substitute for copper coin. An unsuccessful military expedition which had been undertaken in the fullest confidence that the enemy would furnish the means to meet its expenses, left the colony saddled with debts of great magnitude, to meet which there was but an empty treasury. The government then in existence was provisional and of doubtful legality. If it had been permanent in form and of recognized legality, it is possible that the difficulty might have been overcome by a temporary loan from the people, although the amount required was so disproportionate in size to the circulating medium of the colony as to render that solution doubtful as a possibility. If we seek for the basis upon which the legislators built their hopes that the experimental use of the public credit as a circulating medium might succeed, we shall find that there was a certain knowledge of the use of individual credit for such purposes and that there had been more or less discussion of its application as a remedy for a supposed scarcity of the circulating medium, the proposed supply to be furnished by banks of issue. In an address to the crown, the statement is made officially that one of the reasons for establishing a mint in 1652 was because "for some years paper bills passed for payment of debts, wch were very subject to be lost, rent or counterfeited &amp; other inconveniences." [2] It does not appear from the foregoing whether these "paper bills" were emitted by the colony or were based upon the credit of individuals, but as there is no record of any action having been taken by the General Court of the colony under which such bills were authorized it may be assumed that they were not public bills. We know that at a later date private bills were, for several years made use of to some extent in Portsmouth and also in what the writer upon whom we rely for the information terms the "Western English Plantations." [3] From various sources we know that the thoughts of the colonists were turned during this period towards the establishment of a bank which should furnish a currency based upon mortgages of land and pledges of merchandize, and one writer goes so far as to say that, in 1681 this plan was tested experimentally and bills were actually emitted. The pamphlet issued by this author [4] was published in 1682 and contains a proposal for a "fund of land" "in the nature of a money bank or merchandize lumber [5] to pass credit upon, by book entries; or bills of exchange, for great payments and change-bills for running cash." It is also set forth therein that "credit pass'd in the Fund, by book, and Bills, (as afore) will fully supply the defect of money." The author states that his attention had been called to the subject in 1649, [6] and he gives an account of the several attempts which were made to test the plan, winding up with a statement that an actual experiment was made to pass forth bills for some months, for he says "in 6 moneths a considerable number espoused the designe." Notwithstanding the positive assertion that bills were actually emitted in 1681 and that considerable numbers "espoused the designe" it must be inferred from the pamphlet itself that the experiment was but indifferently successful, for in submitting his plan for a bank to the public he states that it had never been tried. [7]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In 1686, an attempt was made to establish a bank in Boston which should issue, for circulation, bills the security for which was to be based upon pledges of personal property and mortgages of real estate. [8] The president of the council favored the project and several members of the council were interested in it. A printing press was bought, paper was purchased, plates were prepared and bills were actually struck off, but for some reason the experiment was at this stage abandoned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Brief as was the career of this attempt to establish a bank of issue it must have attracted attention in local financial circles. The scheme was based upon a plan which we know to have been published two years at least before the colony emitted its currency, and, if we may accept contemporary testimony, the publication was in print two years before the projected bank of 1686 was organized. [9]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It may be inferred that the possibility of furnishing a representative paper substitute for the foreign coins which constituted the circulating medium in New England was a question which attracted much attention at this period. It is however evident that when, in 1690, the assembly of the colony of the Massachusetts Bay proceeded to pay their debts with certificates which were emitted in such form that they could serve as a currency for the colony, they had but little knowledge upon which they could build an opinion as to whether paper money could be made to pass current among the people of the colony. By 1694, when the Bank of England was established, the success of the experiment was practically assured, and it may be that the example of the colony of the Massachusetts Bay had its influence upon the founders of the Bank of England.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The emission of the colony bills of public credit was inaugurated under the provisional government which held the reins after the downfall of Andros. The occasion for this step was the collapse of the expedition which set forth in the fall of 1690 under Sir William Phips with the expectation of capturing Quebec. Hutchinson says: "The government was utterly unprepared for the return of the forces. They seem to have presumed, not only upon success, but upon the enemy's treasure to bear the charge of the expedition. The soldiers were upon the point of mutiny for want of their wages. It was utterly impracticable to raise, in a few days such a sum of money as would be necessary." [10] Sewall says the bills of credit then issued were "not made for want of money, but for want of money in the treasury." [11]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I have already said that under other conditions a loan might have been effected and the crisis thus tided over. It was indeed the opinion of the General Court in November, 1690, before the members were brought to a realizing sense of the full measure of their responsibilities, that a temporary loan adequate for the emergency, could be effected by a pledge of a part of the taxes for the year, combined with the customs dues, and a promise that the expected plunder from Quebec should be applied for the redemption of the loan. A committee was actually appointed to carry out this scheme, but the confidence in the success of the expedition, which led the General Court to pledge the anticipated plunder was apparently not shared by the capitalists of Boston, and the loan, so far as appears, was not negotiated. The time within which this could have been accomplished was but brief, for on the 18th of November Phips arrived at Boston, bearing the intelligence of his disastrous failure. The language used in the vote of the court defining the duties of this committee is not without value in its disclosure of the temper of the community at the time of its passage. It was as follows:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Major Elisha Hutchinson, Captain Samuel Sewall, Mr Peter Sergeant, Captain Penn Townshend, Captain Samuel Hayman, Mr James Taylor, Mr Nathanael Oliver, Captain Andrew Belcher, Captain Samuel Legg, and Mr John Clarke are desired forthwith to use their endeavours to procure the sume of three or Four thousand pounds in money upon Loan for the present paying off the Seamen and Souldiers at their Return from Canada, and for other Emergencies, upon the publique Credit; and this Court do hereby Engage half the publique Rates now agreed to be made &amp; Levyed, and the Countrys part of all such Plunder as they shall recover from the Enemy at Canada &amp;ra and bring home with them; And all money s ariseing upon Impost, as Security to such Gentlemen who shall advance money on that Accompt until they be fully repaid. And the above named Gentlemen are appointed a Committee to receive the Country s part of plunder into their hands and make sale thereof to the most advantage, Rendring an Accompt of the produce of the same to the Gen ll Court. Novemb r 7th 1690 past in y e affirmative p r y e Deputies&gt; John Clark Cler. Consent d to by the Gov r and Assistants Is a Addington Secry [12]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The loan having become impossible through lack of plunder to pledge, and payment of the debts being even more urgent in consequence of the situation of affairs, some other method of meeting the depletion of the treasury referred to by Sewall had to be devised. The emission of bills in the form of certificates of indebtedness to the possessor on the part of the government was the solution of the question which was adopted. These bills were by their terms receivable at the treasury in payment of government dues. They were originally put forth in anticipation of taxes, and provision in the tax levy was made each year for calling them in promptly. A part only of these notes was destroyed on their return to the treasury. Those remaining in the treasurer's hands were made use of at a later date by the province as a currency, the connection of the provincial government with their emission being indicated by the endorsement of the treasurer of the province. The currency emitted in 1690 was generally spoken of as Colony or Old Charter bills.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The order of the General Court authorizing the original issue sets forth the motives which prompted the legislators to take this step. It was passed at a court sitting in Boston "By adjournment, December 10th, 1690," and is in the following language:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Whereas (for the maintaining and defending of their Majesties interests against the hostile invasions of their French and Indian enemies who have begun and are combined in the prosecution of a Bloody war upon the English of their Majesties Colonys and plantations of New England) this Colony hath necessarily contracted sundry considerable debts, which this Court taking into consideration and being desirous to approve themselves Just and honest in the discharge of the same and that every person who hath credit with the country for the use of any of his estate, disbursements, or service done for the Public, may in convenient time receive due and equal satisfaction; withal considering the present poverty and calamities of the country And (through scarcity of money) the want of an adequate measure of Commerce, whereby they are disadvantaged in making present payment as desired; Yet being willing to settle and adjust the accompts of the said debts, and to make payment thereof, with what speed they can It is ordered by this Court that Major Elisha Hutchinson, Major John Phillips, Captain Penn Townsend, Mr Adam Winthrop and Mr Timothy Thornton or any three of them, be and are hereby appointed and impowered a Committee for the granting forth of Printed Bills in such forms as is agreed upon by this Court (none under five shillings nor exceeding five pounds in one bill) unto all such persons who shall desire the same, to whom the Colony is indebted, for such sum or sums of money as they shall have debentures from the Committee, or Committees that are or shall be appointed to give out the same, Every of which Bills according to the sums therein expressed shall be of equal Value with money, and the Treasurer and all the Receivers subordinate to him shall accept, and receive the same accordingly in all Publick Payments; No more of Said Bills to be Printed or granted forth than for the Sum of Seven thousand Pounds; And the Colony is hereby engaged to Satisfy the Value of Said Bills as the Treasury shall be enabled. And any person having of Said Bills in his Hands, may Accordingly return the same to the Treasurer, and shall receive the full Sum thereof in Money, or other Public Stock at the Money Price as Stated for that time And if any of said Bills be worn in any Persons hands, so as they desire to renew them, returning them to the Committee, they shall have new ones of the same numbers and sums given out. The forme of the Bill agreed upon N o   20 s   Indentment.  &gt; N o (       ) 20 s This Indented Bill of Twenty shillings due from the Massachusetts Colony to the Possessor shall be in Value equal to Money and shall be Accordingly Accepted by the Treasurer, and Receivers subordinate to him in all Publick Payments, and for any stock at any time in the Treasury Boston in New England Decem r 10th 1690. By Order of the General Court { Locus Sigilli} Committee" [13]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The seven thousand pounds limit was removed in February, 1690-91. The cause for the removal is set forth in the following order which was passed at that time:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Whereas the Committee appointed for the granting out of Bills of Credit (in the form agreed upon by this Court at their session in December last past) for the Publick debts, necessarily contracted by this Colony in the maintenance and defence of their Majesties Interests, against the Hostile Invasions of their French and Indian Enemies, were Limited to a Certain Sume, which is found to be far short of what is absolutely necessary. It's therefore Ordered that the said Committee do in like manner Proceed to the Printing and giving forth of said Bills to all Persons desiring the same who shall Produce and deliver unto them, a debenture or debentures from the Committee or Committees that are or shall be thereunto appointed, or shall Produce an Order of this Court, or of the Governour and Councill for the full sume expressed in such debenture, or Order, every of wch Bills of the sume of Twenty Shillings shall be accepted in all Publick Payments by the Treasurer and all Constables or other receivers subordinate to the Treasurer in Lieu of Money, at Twenty-one shillings and so proportionately for all Bills of greater or Lesser Sums (no one Bill to be for a Less sum than two shillings, nor exceeding the sum of ten pounds) And the Select Men of each Town may send the Debentures Of the several Persons in their Towns to the said Committee by some meet Person who shall receive bills for the same to be delivered to the said Selectmen, and by them given out to the Persons to whom they are due. And the Colony hereby stands engaged to satisfy the Value of the said Bills as the Treasury shall be enabled; And any Person having of Said Bills in his Hands returning the same to the Treasurer shall accordingly receive the Just Sum exprest in said Bills in money or other Public Stock at the Money Price as Stated at that time." [14]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the 21st of May, 1691, an order was passed setting a limit of £40,000 to the emission. It was in the following language: "Ordered That the Bills of Publick Credit already given, and to be given out for Adjusting Country debts shall not exceed the Sum of Forty thousand Pounds which is supposed will amount to the full of what the Country is indebted and will probably be Called in again by the rates already granted, And that Mr John Foster, Capt Joseph Lynde and Capt Samuel Ruggles be, and are hereby appointed a Committee to call in and take into safe custody the Plates which the Bills were printed off with And to examine what Bills are still resting in the Committees hands not given forth, Also to examine what Sum in the Said Bills are already drawn into the Treasury and to direct that the Country have credit in the Treasurers Books for that Sum and so to dispose of, and secure those Bills as there may be no Danger of their Coming forth again into any private hands." [15]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The following is a contemporary description of the government bills, of the basis upon which they circulated, and of the manner in which they were retired: "What is the use of Coyned Silver? but to furnish a man with Credit, that he may obtain from his Neighbours those Commodities, which he hath occasion for? The Country in General Court, have Recognized or Acknowledged, a Debt of so many thousand pounds unto them that have been the servants of the Publick. The Credit conveyed by the Bills now Circulates from one hand to another as mens dealings are, until the Publick Taxes call for it. It is then brought in to the Treasurers hands, from which it goes not out again. Now the Conveniences which the servants of the Publick, have had by them, have honestly paid the Countries Debts; and what could coyned Silver have done more?" [16] The statement that "the note goes not out again" was perhaps true in 1691, but it could not have been applied after 1692, except with the qualifying phrase, unless by authority of the General Court. The question whether the province, as a matter of economy used the same colony notes over and over again was of no consequence, provided the use thus made was in accordance with the authorization of the General Court.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If we assume that the entire £40,000 authorized May 21, 1691, were issued, [17] there were put forth of these Old Charter bills, in the various issues and re-issues of the colony and province, £82,000, independent of bills borrowed by the government, [18] which probably had the same effect as emissions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Provision was made in each case for a tax which should furnish the means for the prompt retirement of the bills emitted. When the government first offered these bills to creditors in place of coin, they were received with distrust. It was while this distrust prevailed that the authors of the pamphlet from which I have quoted appealed to the public to maintain them, pointing out, as has already been seen, that they were better than notes based upon individual credits which had been current in sections of the country, and asking wherein was the superiority of silver coin in the performance of the various functions assigned to the notes. Cotton Mather sets forth the deleterious effects of this distrust and shows how valuable the bills might have been to the government if cordially received. He then asserts that their circulating value was at first impaired from twenty to thirty per cent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Had the government been so settled, that there had not been any doubt of any obstruction, or diversion to be given to the prosecution of the tax-act, by a total change of affairs, then depending at White-Hall, 'tis very certain that the bills of credit had been better than so much ready silver; yea, the invention had been of more use to the New Englanders, than if all their copper mines had been opened, or the mountains of Peru had been removed into these parts of America. The Massachusetts bills of credit had been like bank bills of Venice, where, though there were not, perhaps, a ducat of money in the bank, yet the bills were esteemed more than twenty per cent. better than money among the body of the people, in all their dealings. But many people being afraid that the government would in half a year be so overturned as to convert their bills of credit altogether into waste paper, the credit of them was thereby very much impaired; and they who first received them could make them yield little more than fourteen or sixteen shillings in the pound; . . ." [19] An officer who accompanied the expedition wrote in reference to these bills as follows: " But they will not pass in trade between man and man, nor can these poor soldiers and seamen get anything for them to above half their value, they being only used to pay rates with." [20]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Another writer intimates that many of those who received the bills hastened to get rid of them at such a disadvantage that their value was reduced to twelve or thirteen shillings on the pound. "What a great loss it was," he says, "to those poor men who ventured their lives in the expedition! They were forced to buy such goods as its likely they had hardly any need of, to get rid of their new coyn'd money. And what they bought was so to their disadvantage that they put off their bills at twelve or thirteen shillings on the pound." [21] If it be true that the market value of the bills was affected by Plate 2 Two altered 5 s. bills, Province Currency, 1702 Plates the causes at which the writer seems to hint, it will be seen that this was only temporary, as the bills soon became current at par.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was, however, an element of uncertainty as to the approval of the acts of the provisional government by their successors which must, as Cotton Mather says, at first have affected their credit, and it may also be doubted whether any weak government could have floated £40,000 in bills of credit, and precipitated them on the community in the manner in which the first of these notes were issued, without raising some doubts as to their value in the minds of those who were compelled to receive them. It may be assumed that the hesitation on the part of the public to accept the bills as a substitute for coin influenced the General Court in its decision to attach to the act of emission of February 3, 1690-91, the clause pledging the government to receive them in payment of dues at a premium of five per cent., a precedent which fastened itself as a custom upon the annual legislation in this regard, from the consequences of which the court was unable to take steps to free itself until 1720. Mather is authority for the statement that the Boston merchants also came to the rescue, offering to take the bills in payment for goods at reasonable rates, and that Gen. Phips "cheerfully laid down a considerable quantity of ready money for an equivalent parcel of them." [22]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After the organization of the province under the charter, one of the first steps taken was to pass an act to the effect that the bills of the late colony should "pass current within this province in all payments equivalent to money". In public payments they were to be received with an advance of five per cent., following in this regard the precedent set by the act of February 3, 1690-91, heretofore quoted. Possessors of bills who would loan them to the government were to be secured by public taxes and were to be reimbursed out of the taxes within twelve months. This act is divided into two sections. The first makes all bills current, while the second confers this function only upon such of the bills as should be loaned to the government and imposes restraints upon the currency of all others. In December of the same year (1692), the disability imposed upon a part of the bills by the limitation in the second section of the act was removed. [23]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This trifling with the credit of the bills would seem to have justified the distrust which led to their depreciation. When, however, the complete recognition of the bills was effected by the new government and it was realized that no effort was being made to circulate more of them than was required to meet the immediate necessities of the situation, and further, that no attempt was made to postpone the period when they should be called in, they were accepted with confidence by the entire community. Public sentiment, also, came to the relief of the bills at this time. The town of Boston voted, May 12, 1702, that the province bills of credit should be accepted in payment of the town rates. At the town meeting held in Boston, January 18, 1702-3, the question was submitted "whether the new bills of credit, now to be used in public payments of the Province, shall be taken and accepted by the town treasurer in payments of the town rate at the advance and after the rate of five per cent. more than the value therein expressed, and the same to pass out in payments get their expressed value without the said advance, according to the practice of the province treasury," and it passed in the affirmative. [24] Thus Boston actually assumed the five per cent. offered by the province as an inducement for the currency of the bills.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It may be inferred that the five per cent. premium at which the government received the notes greatly aided in producing this result. Whether this was so or not, so long as the government was conservative in the amounts which were issued and complied with the provisions which were made at the time of the several issues for the prompt retirement of the bills through taxation, they continued to circulate at par.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Meantime the emission of government bills, which originally contemplated only the furnishing of a temporary expedient had gone on from year to year, the amount annually issued being controlled by the necessities of the government. From motives of economy or policy, probably the latter, the province continued to use the colony bills and did not adopt a form of its own until 1702. It was apparently thought at one time that use might be made of the plates prepared for the colony bills to furnish a new emission, and an order was actually carried through the house of representatives for printing a new supply of bills, certain individuals being designated to sign them in behalf of the colony. The evident impropriety of such action led to the rejection of this order by the council, [25] and naturally led to the preparation of new plates, in which such changes of phraseology only were made as were required by the new form of government. [26] Each bill was a certificate of indebtedness from the province and contained a provision that it should be accepted as so much money in public payments. Current expenses were met by the emission of bills and for the retirement of these bills future taxes were pledged; but as the emergencies of the government enlarged and the issues needed to meet them increased, the designated tax levies through which they could be returned to the treasury were postponed from year to year. By 1714, the income of the province from taxation was pledged, either wholly or in part, each year for six years, so that the issue then made was not to be called in by taxation until 1720. Inasmuch as some of the bills could not be received by the province for several years to come, it was natural that all should feel the effects of this discredit. This fact alone would have caused them to depreciate, even if the amount then in circulation had been properly proportioned to the needs of the community. The province bills and the bills of the neighboring governments in circulation in the province had by that time driven all the gold and silver out of circulation and much of it out of the province. Silver and sterling exchange had consequently risen twenty and one half per cent. The depreciation and distrust of the bills were sufficient to impair their efficacy, and to cause a clamor for relief. The withdrawal of the silver from circulation made the country dependent upon the bills of public credit for a medium of trade, a large part of which was subject to be called in each year. The retirement of a large proportion of the circulating medium through annual taxation, regularly produced a stringency from which the legislature sought relief through postponement of the retirements. If the bills were not called in according to the terms of the acts of issue, public faith in them would lessen, if called in there would be a disturbance of the currency. On these points there was a permanent disagreement between the governor and the representatives, discussions concerning which reveal themselves in 1715 and traces of which are frequently found after that date. "About this time", says a pamphleteer, writing about 1720, but referring to 1714, "the silver being pretty well drained from the country the bills outstanding on the former fund, continually going in to the treasury, in order to be sunk, it was contrived to alter the fund, and put off the payment for a longer time by lessening the tax about one half. This being not a sufficient stop it was brought to about a quarter part—and I think continues therabouts to this day." [27] Another remedy was supposed to be more paper money, and pressure was brought to bear upon the General Court to secure the incorporation of a bank of issue, the circulation of whose bills would, it was thought, contribute relief to the situation. The promoters reprinted a London pamphlet which, according to the date given upon the title-page of the reprint, was originally printed in 1688, in which a scheme for a bank of issue was set forth in great detail. [28] The preface of the reprint describes its contents as a scheme for a bank of credit founded upon land security. The enemies of the scheme succeeded in defeating it by emitting province bills to be loaned upon real security, [29] but the contest then provoked produced much ill will in the province. [30] A study of the pamphlet then issued discloses the fact that the scheme is similar to one submitted to the council in 1686 by John Blackwell. [31] This latter project was favorably received by the council and was carried forward even to the preparation of the bills for issue, but was not allowed to go beyond that point.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The projectors of the private bank in 1714, not only reprinted this pamphlet bearing date 1688, but they prepared a separate scheme of their own which they termed a projection for a bank of credit founded on land security. [32] The presentation of the petition of the projectors for incorporation produced considerable discussion, in which the public to some extent participated, through the various pamphlets then published by the disputants.

      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER II. THE MASSACHUSETTS COINAGE, PROCLAMATION MONEY AND LAWFUL MONEY [34]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At some stage in this discussion it is essential that the fact should be stated that the pounds, shillings and pence with which we are dealing do not have the same value as those which are called sterling. It is also important that something should be said concerning "proclamation money", a term to be met with in contemporary publications, and "lawful money," a phrase which is to be found in the supply bills, tax acts and in all legislation of a similar character in Massachusetts during this period. We have already reached a point where the understanding of these terms is imperative if one would comprehend contemporary literature, and in order that the subject may be completely covered it is perhaps desirable also to review the legislation in connection with the Massachusetts coinage. In seeking for the sterling value of these coins we naturally turn to the act establishing a mint but at the outset we meet with difficulties since the clauses of the act in which the values are defined are held to be irreconcilable. [35] According to the terms of that act the new coins were to be of the just alloy of new, sterling, English money; and for value to be two pence in a shilling of lesser value than the corresponding English Coins. The shilling was to weigh three pennyweights Troy weight. The new coins were declared to be the current money of the colony, and no other money was admitted to this privilege except English. The effect of this limitation was to a certain extent compromised by the addition of the clause "except the receivers consent thereunto." [36] The actual value of the shilling was stated by Randolph in 1676 to be 9 d 1 f ., 22.5 per cent. below the English shilling. [37] This value was adopted by the officers of the London mint in a report in January, 1684-85 [38] and further appears to be acceptable to Prof. W. G. Sumner [39] who has made a study of this subject, and who states that the value of this shilling was 77.5 per cent. of the English shilling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In circulation it appears to have been valued almost at once at ninepence, for in 1654 we find a statement which seems to mean that it was exported at that rate, and of course it would not have been withdrawn for that purpose at a loss. [40] In the statement of a Board of Commissioners in 1655, [41] and also among the complaints against Massachusetts in 1661, we find a recognition of the same value. [42] In the fall of 1686 there was a discussion in England about the re-establishment of the mint in Boston. In the reasons for the mint which were submitted, the shilling was stated to be worth "nine pence farthing", while in the answer to these reasons the value is given "at 9 d for a shilling (w ch is about 25 per cent less than the money of England)". [43]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Douglass, who was fairly conversant with the history of the coinage, tells the story in the following words: "At the first settling of the New England colonies their medium was sterling coin at sterling value and barter. When they got into trade a heavy piece of eight passed at 5 s . A. 1652 they proceeded to coin silver shillings, sixpences and threepences at the rate of 6 s to a heavy piece of eight." [44] Elsewhere Douglass gives the sterling value of the piece of eight at 4 s d , [45] thus enabling us to deduce the value of the shilling, from his quotations, at ninepence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In a note to the Diaries of John Hull [46] Rev. Edward E. Hale endeavors to explain the discrepancies in the valuation of the shilling by the allowance for seigniorage. Professor Sumner seems to attribute the trouble to an erroneous estimate of the London value of silver. "The English mint price for silver," he says, [47] "after 1601 was 5 s. 2d per ounce, but it seems to have been believed in Massachusets that it was still five shillings," and again [48] "The intention was to put the New England standard 25 per cent. below the English, supposing that the latter was 96 grains for a shilling. [49] In fact it was 92.9 grains, [50] so that a shilling of 72 grains was 77.5 per cent. of it." He also points out, however, that the mint charges were such that no person could have afforded to take silver to the mint for coinage unless the effective shilling in the market had been tenpence. [51]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The opinion prevailed at that time that by rating silver coins above their value they would be retained within the limits of the jurisdiction where this enhanced value was recognized. It was probably because of sympathy with this notion that the General Court enacted, June 14, 1642, that the piece of eight should circulate at the value of 4 s . 8 d ., [52] and again on the 29th of September of the same year increased the nominal rate to 5s. [53] Douglass says that this coin not only passed within the limits of the colony at five shillings in early days, but was actually remitted to Great Britain on that basis. [54]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The mint was established in the hope of retaining a uniform metallic currency in the colony. It was soon evident however that it was only partially successful in the performance of the expected work, and in May 1654, in the abortive act, the preamble of which has been alluded to, [55] it was proposed by the magistrates to order and enact " that whatever person or persons be they stranngers or Inhabitants that shall directly or Indirectly export out of this Jurisdiccon any of the coine of this countrie after the publication hereof shall forfeite his or their whole estate one halfe to the countrie and the other halfe to such pson or psons as shall sue for the same." It was also provided in the proposed act that there should be a "Water Bayly or searcher" appointed "in every port-towne" who was to be empowered to "search any suspitious persons or vessells, chests, truncks or any other things." If he should discover any money and the county court should determine that it was about to be transported then it was to be forfeited one half to the officer and one half to the country. Similar powers of search were granted, in the case of persons traveling by land, to constables. For some reason the deputies rejected this act, but in August of the same year a law was passed against the exportation of New England coin, and searchers were appointed to examine outgoing baggage, [56] and if they should find any money they were ordered to seize the same. In May, 1669, a larger force of searchers was appointed and they were endowed with extraordinary powers. It was their duty to examine outgoing vessels which had weighed anchor with the intention of leaving our waters, and they were instructed to search the "pocket, cloake, bag, portmantle or any other thing belonging" to such persons as were on their journey out of the jurisdiction on horseback. They were to seize all money "of the coin of this jurisdiction" which they should find, and were invested with power to break open packages and examine personal effects. [57] Notwithstanding these arbitrary proceedings, there was a scarcity of silver in the country, and in October, 1672, the General Court prefaced an act legalizing the currency of pieces of eight, with a preamble in which it was stated that these coins were of more value to carry out of the country than they would yield at the mint, and, what was of more consequence, that they were actually being carried out of the country instead of being taken to the mint. To prevent this, it was ordered that pieces of eight, of full weight and good silver, Mexico, Seville, and Pillar, should pass current at six shillings, after they had been duly stamped at the mint with the letters N. E. to indicate that they had been inspected. Light weight pieces of eight were to be stamped with their actual weight, and to pass for a proportionate value. [58]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The act of October, 1672, is the first point at which we obtain a legal rating of the piece of eight in New England money. It seems probable that this legislation was the result of two circumstances: first, that the piece of eight having a recognized rate in shillings at which it would pass, people could and did avail themselves of it as a medium of trade without paying seigniorage at the mint for its conversion into New England money; and second that the General Court was desirous of protecting the public against the light weight pieces if possible. So far as this latter reason may have had influence in promoting this legislation, it is evident that it produced little result, for in May, 1682, [59] the General Court authorized the currency of light weight pieces of eight according to their weight, and in October of the same year added by way of explanation that they were to be received at six shillings eight pence per ounce Troy weight. [60] Under the Province, it was enacted in 1692 that pieces of eight, Seville, Pillar, and Mexico, should pass current, if of full seventeen penny-weight, at six shillings. This act was disallowed on account of the penalty attached to its infringement, but the substance of the law was reenacted in 1697 in such form that it was permitted to stand. [61] The expression "full seventeen penny weight" is probably the equivalent of "not less than seventeen penny weight." The rate of coined silver per ounce to be deduced therefrom, assuming, as was apparently the custom at that time in the province, that it was of sterling alloy, is a little over seven shillings. The same year the legislation against the export of bullion or money was renewed [62] and shipmasters on clearing were required to take oath that they did not have on board their vessels over five pounds in bullion or current silver money.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As has already been intimated the confusion in the currency caused by the closure of the mint led to proceedings in England towards the re-establishment of that institution. Reasons were submitted to the Lords of the Committee for Trade and Plantations why this should be done, September 23, 1686, [63] and a reply to this document on the part of the officials of the mint was filed on the 23d of October. [64] In this latter paper the statement is made that pieces of eight "are but a commodity" in New England and it is recommended that the people there be left to barter the one against the other as their interest guides them. In the interim between the date of the application or petition and the reply on the 13th of October, a committee had already reported to the Privy Council against re-establishing the mint and had recommended that power be given Sir Edmund Andros to regulate, by proclamation, the passage of pieces of eight and other foreign coins imported into New England. [65] On the 27th of the same month, the Privy Council concluded that the mint should not be re-established and passed an order to the effect that "Sir Edmund Andros, be and is hereby authorized and empowered by proclamation to regulate pieces of eight and other foreign coins within the said Territory of New England, to such current value as he shall judge most requisite for his Majesty's Service and the trade of Plate 3 Impression from the Middle Plate, 1702. Showing the red scroll which it was throught would serve as a protection against counterfeits. his subjects there." On the 31st of October, Sunderland officially communicated this decision of his Majesty in Privy Council to Sir Edmund in a letter in which instructions were given that "by Proclamation under our Seal for our said dominion in New England, you regulate the price of pieces of eight and other foreign coins imported thither, in such manner and to such a current value as you, with the advice of our Council shall find most requisite for our service and the trade of our subjects there." [66]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This letter was communicated to the New England Council by Sir Edmund on the 22d of January, 1686-87 [67] and at the same time the answer of the officers of the mint to the paper entitled "Reasons for a Mint in New England" was also read. On the 28th the matter was brought up again in council and in this connection there was some discussion as to whether it was in the power of the council to prevent the shipping of coin to England and also as to what prejudice to the country such shipments actually occasioned. [68] On the 23d of February, the letter relative to pieces of eight was again submitted to the council and at the same time a paper was presented by Mr. Wharton [69] for an accommodation of the country and supply of money to carry on trade, as the record reads. [70] There is a paper in the Massachusetts Archives (vol. 100, no. 162) bearing no date but classified chronologically under 1671, which is endorsed "Mr. Wharton's paper about raising of money." [71] It contains among many others the following propositions: All outstanding debts to be discharged in specie at 6 s . 8 d . per ounce; after a given date New England coins to pass as follows: 1 s . @ 14 d ., 6 d . @ 7 d ., 3 d . @ 4 d . and 2 d. @ 3 d.; All Mexico, Pillar, Seville, and other pieces of eight, bullion and plate of sterling alloy to pass current at 7 s. 6 d. per ounce. The paper contained many other suggestions, and bears evidence of some care in its preparation, but has some amendments in a different hand writing from that of the main part of the text. It was obviously introduced as a basis for discussion. This point was gained and Randolph's record has preserved the substance of what was said. It was contended that unless the New England coins and pieces of eight were raised, all money would leave the country. Sir Edmund was not influenced by this argument but declared that he was opposed to setting any value upon the New England money other than its intrinsic value accounted as bullion. Two goldsmiths were called in as experts. They came to the council chamber and Mr. Wharton's paper was read to them. They asked for time for the preparation of their opinion which was granted them and the discussion was renewed with vigor, many of the council being of opinion that raising the value of money would make it plentiful in the country and quicken trade. To this it was replied that such a course of action would tend to destroy commerce with the West Indies. Instead of sugar, molasses and rum, nothing but light pieces of eight would be shipped thence to New England. It was argued that raising the coinage would only help the merchants, as the country people could not raise prices on their goods, and this would result in positive injury to the country.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the 25th of February, the goldsmiths again attended the meeting of the council and submitted their report upon Mr. Wharton's paper. They were of opinion that raising the value of pieces of eight would bring them into the country plentifully, but they thought it would at the same time occasion the shipment out of the country of the New England money. It is obvious from this that they conceived that the opposition of Sir Edmund Andros was fatal to that part of Wharton's project which involved the raising of the New England money. The specific question was put to them what advantage would there be in raising pieces of eight to 7 s. 6 d. ? and they answered that unless the New England money was correspondingly advanced it would all leave the country. This day's conference was closed by the submission of a proposition that "all whole pieces of eight (Peru excepted) 15 pennyweight and upwards should pass currant at 6s., all other bullion and plate of sterling alloy should pass currant at six and eight pence pr. ounce. All Peru pieces 15 penny weight at 6s. [72] "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the 10th of March some of the chief merchants of Boston and Salem were summoned before the council in order that they might be consulted on the money question. They were present at the meeting of the board and recommended that there be no change in the valuation of the New England money. They further recommended that Mexico, Seville and Pillar pieces of eight should pass by weight at 6 s . 10 d . per ounce Troy, and the fractional parts of the same, the quarters and reals, on the basis of a valuation of the piece of eight at 5 s . 4 d. Outstanding liabilities, they thought, ought to be adjusted in current New England money or in Mexico, Seville or Pillar pieces of eight at 6 s . 10 d. per oz. Troy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They were asked by Sir Edmund what was the standard weight of a good piece of eight? They replied seventeen and a half pennyweights. This ended the conference. The merchants wanted the New England money to stand unchanged, and to remain the standard money of the country, and they desired that the Spanish money should pass by weight. This did not accord with the views expressed by Sir Edmund, who evidently wished to establish a value at which the standard piece of eight should circulate and did not wish in direct terms to recognize the New England coins. Randolph undertook to record the impression made upon Andros by this discussion but his haste prevented him from being intelligible. His words are "his Ex ce found out the designs of the Merchants to [make ?] mony [73] a commodity and not to make it currant mony at a price." An order was then passed "That all pieces of eight, Civill, Pillar and Mexico at due weight [74] shall pass in payment at six shillings per piece, that half pieces of Eight, Quarter pieces and Realls do pass pro rata," and on the 12th of March proclamation to that effect was given near the Town House by beat of drum and sound of trumpet. Whether the proclamation followed the language of the order, as recorded in the transcript sent to London and now to be found in the council record, or adopted the language of the Andros records and specified the weight of the piece of eight which should pass at six shillings, does not appear; but it would seem as if the attempt to enforce the order must have been of little use unless the latter was the case.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">May 21, 1687, Randolph wrote with reference to this order as follows: "it does not answer the end, money grows very scarce and no trade to bring it in." [75] The condition of affairs a few months later would seem to have revived the discussion as to the rates at which pieces of eight should pass, for on January 24, 1687-88, Randolph again wrote " We cannot yet agree upon the prizes of money: Some would have all pieces of 8, tho' of 15 pennyweight, go at 6s. New England, others at 17; but they stand at 17½. Our money goes all away and shall have little or none to supply ordinary occasions." [76] The statement that the standard weight, 17½ pennyweight, was maintained at that date, shows what was meant by "due weight" in the official records of the council, copies of which were forwarded to London. It is of importance, however to note that the certified copy of the order passed in council regulating the value at which pieces of eight should pass which was sent to London, did not specify the weight otherwise than in this vague form. [77]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The proclamation which gave its name in some of the colonies to the basic measure of value during this period was issued by Queen Anne in 1704 and fixed the rates at which certain foreign coins should pass current in her Majesty's dominions in America. [78] The weight and intrinsic values of these coins were given, and also the corresponding rates at which they should pass in the plantations, the latter being fixed in terms of New England money, or at least in shillings which were so near those in which the province had already rated the piece of eight that it was supposed they would readily be accepted as an equivalent. It may be inferred from this proclamation and from the parliamentary statute passed in 1707 for enforcing it, [79] as well as from the colonial legislation of this period, with regard to the value at which pieces of eight should pass, that the New England coinage had been absolutely supplanted by the Spanish and Mexican dollars and fractional parts thereof. The mint had been closed for twenty years when the proclamation was issued, and thenceforth when the term "proclamation money" is used it refers to the shilling defined in the proclamation. On the other hand, the favorite equivalent phrase in Massachusetts, "lawful money," refers apparently to the shilling based upon the provincial act. [80] The shillings thus denominated were to have the same value as those rated in the proclamation or act as the case might be in terms of the piece of eight. [81]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By this proclamation, the Seville piece of eight, old plate, and the Mexican piece of eight were each valued at 4 s . 6 d . sterling, and the weight of each was given at 17 cwt. 12 grs. The Pillar piece of eight was given a slightly higher value in this table. The rate at which these coins were to circulate in the plantation was fixed at 6s. the same value as that assigned by provincial legislation, "if of full seventeen penny weight." The rate of conversion was exactly 133, the 4s. 6d. sterling being equal to 6 s. New England money. The price of silver in London was then 5 s . 2 d. per ounce. In proclamation money, where 17½ dwt. was equal to 6s., the nominal value of the ounce of silver was 6 s. 10 2/7 d . Lawful money or 17 dwt. for 6 s., gave 7 s. 3 as the value of an ounce of silver. [82]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In 1706 the Lords of Trade informed Governor Dudley that the provincial act of 1697 furnished the basis for the rates fixed in the proclamation. [83] "You are further to represent to the Assembly," they said, " that there lies a particular obligation on them to enforce a due obedience to her Majesty's commands herein, for that the regulation of the rates at which foreign coins are to pass was calculated from a law of their own." The establishment of the value at which foreign coins should pass in the plantations, by the standard fixed for the value of the New England shilling in an act passed by the General Court of Massachusetts instead of reversing the process and taking sterling money as the basis, at first glance seems peculiar. It appears that the Board of Trade adopted this course with reluctance, their action being taken in consequence of an opinion of the attorney general, May 31, 1703, to the effect that the provincial act of 1697, having been approved by the Privy Council had the force of an Act of Parliament. [84] The probable influence of this opinion was anticipated by those in London who were in touch with current events, and William Penn, writing in December of the same year, prophesied that New England's standard would be that of the continent. To this he added, that if a law of theirs [the act of 1697] had not been unwarily confirmed by King William, which law could not be repealed except with their consent, the English standard would have been the measure of America at large. Again in July, 1704, he wrote, " the Queen by proclamation now sent thee has settled the coin at £25 per ct. according to New England standard, and would have done it to English sterling but for the late king's confirming their rates for money, which extends all over America." [85]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notwithstanding the fact that the action of the Privy Council in thus adopting what they evidently regarded as practically the New England standard for all the plantations in America rested upon the opinion of their legal adviser to the effect that they were bound by the confirmation of the provincial act of 1697, it may well be doubted whether the Privy Council would not have found some way to avoid this dilemma if they had seriously objected to it. The act of 1697 fixed a rate for the piece of eight "if of seventeen penny weight." The proclamation demanded that this weight should be seventeen and one-half penny weights in order that this coin should circulate at the rate of six shillings. Professor Sumner in his paper on "The coin shilling of Massachusetts Bay" [86] says of this proceeding, "In fact the English authorities did violate the law of 1697." Through the exercise of the same power by which this change was accomplished the sterling standard could have been adopted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If we turn to the then existing condition of the currencies in New England and at home, we shall see that the circumstances were such that it was easy for the Privy Council to reconcile themselves to the step thus forced upon them by the opinion of the attorney general.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The province was then dependent upon foreign silver for its currency. New England money was but a nominal measure of value, the local coinage having disappeared after the closure of the mint, and the province having been compelled to resort to legislation against the export of silver, in the hope of retaining within its borders the miscellaneous coins then in circulation. [87] Moreover, the condition of the silver coinage in Great Britain at that time may serve to some extent to explain this readiness to accept a measure of value set by the province itself in terms of a foreign coin. The table of values for foreign coins contained in the proclamation was prepared by Sir Isaac Newton, who had been called to the mint for the purpose of superintending the recoinage of the silver of the realm. Prior to this process, and during its continuance, the relations of the values of English gold and silver coins were greatly disturbed. After the recoinage, confidence was re-established in London, but it was still fresh in the minds of men that the upward career of the guinea, when measured in the clipped and sweated silver in circulation prior to this measure, had been decreed by parliamentary enactment to stop at 30 s ., and that by successive laws its measure in silver had been ordered to be reduced to 22 s ., while as a matter of fact, it had, at the time the table was made, actually fallen to 21 s. 6 d . Thus it will be seen that the recent instability of the English silver coinage may have influenced the politic course taken in accepting as binding the opinion of the attorney general heretofore alluded to and adopting a measure of value which purported to be the same as that established, in terms of a foreign coin, by the colonists themselves. The rate having thus been fixed between a nominal measure of values and an actual coinage, there was nothing to disturb it so long as the standards of the mints were preserved. It is known that these standards were not constant, but in practice these changes were not noticed in the colonies, and the rate was passed on to our day, six New England shillings being equal to the dollar, Mexican or Spanish, and to their successor our dollar; 133 s. lawful money being in the days of the province equal to 100 s . sterling. Until dollars came into use, all transactions in Massachusetts were stated in New England money. All accounts given in terms of "lawful money" must therefore be reduced twenty five per cent if we could obtain the corresponding amount in sterling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It has been said that the standards of the foreign coins which were in use in the colony were subjected to changes during this period. The fluctuations in value consequent thereto have been fully described by Professor William G. Sumner. [88] Although the value of "proclamation money" and of "lawful money" remained constant so long as there were no changes of weight and alloy at the mints, still in practice the standard of weight for the piece of eight in circulation which passed for six shillings was steadily reduced until silver was driven out of circulation. The different values of the coin shilling to be derived from legislation and from the degradation of the piece of eight at different times, 1652 to 1705, have also been worked out by Professor Sumner. [89]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Although we have reached technical definitions of proclamation and lawful moneys, we have not conquered all the difficulties which are to be encountered in the attempt to analyze the significance of these terms. It was the Opinion of Attorney General Northey that the tender in the colonies of the foreign coins mentioned in the proclamation at the rates therein expressed was a legal tender. [90] Whether this was sound law or not, in practice the proclamation was not recognized. Douglass, speaking of the act of Parliament passed for enforcing the proclamation says "This Act continues to be observed in none of our colonies, excepting in Barbadoes and Bermudas." [91]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If the values assigned by the proclamation had been accepted in the colonies, a measure of values would have been furnished which would only have been affected by the changes in weight and alloy made by the foreign mints, we might indeed say by the Spanish mint. Northey's opinion would have been made the law of the land through local legislation and "lawful money" and "proclamation money" would have been synonymous. Such was not the case, however, for when Dudley sought to secure observance of the proclamation through penal legislation he was met with such vigorous resistance by the assembly, that he wrote to the Lords of Trade, July 25, 1705, that they would not even refer the proposed legislation to a committee until he had dropped the word "penalty" out. [92] He then went on to say that the assembly sought to rate silver at eight shillings an ounce, scarce fifteen penny weight for six shillings. This he had peremptorily refused to approve and had finally, after a contest of five weeks, prevailed and secured the levy at seventeen penny weight. In other words the utmost concession that he had secured from the assembly was the adoption of the rate which had already been recognized by provincial legislation, that is to say the act of 1697. The rate of silver which the assembly attempted to fix in the tax levy was the then current rate in the province and it carried with it the corollary that the piece of eight then in circulation weighed, as Dudley expressed it, "scarce fifteen penny weight." This had been accomplished through the process of selection for remittance, from the clipped coins in use in trade, of all those whose weight made them more valuable for this purpose than for local use, and the bills of public credit had been kept at a nominal par with silver through the degradation of the coins in use. During the time that this process was going on there must have been an unusual difficulty in determining what was "lawful money." Legally perhaps this was determined by the act of 1697, which still stood unrepealed and was practically recognized, through the persistency of Dudley, in the tax levy of 1705. Moreover, so far as the government was concerned, Dudley intimated in the same letter that he should insist upon payments being made to the treasury on that basis, but in the adjustment of ordinary debts, it is probable that pieces of eight at their current value or bills of public credit on the same basis were accepted without question. Dudley evidently refers to such a practice when he says "thereby the country will be emboldened to use their late way of payment at fifteen penny." When however silver disappeared, some other measure than the uncertain paper money had to be resorted to and recourse was apparently had to the shilling defined in the provincial act of 1697. [93]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In a paper published by the writer in February, 1898, [94] the discrepancies in the value to be assigned to silver through these definitions and the difficulty of determining what it actually was at any given time were pointed out. The assumption was made in that paper that the shilling to be derived from the proclamation and that which can be deduced from the provincial statute were accepted as substantially the same. This opinion was based upon the disregard of precise definitions which then prevailed and the total neglect of other elements than weight in assigning values to the Spanish coinage then in circulation. It will be seen, however, from some of the references which have been given that certain of the writers recognized the distinction in value between the "proclamation" and the "lawful" money, and it must be borne in mind that the latter was the fundamental measure of value in Massachusetts.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Any person who cares to pursue the technical investigation of this subject will derive much aid from two papers which have been published by Professor William G. Sumner. [95]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The complicated facts related thereto are arranged and analyzed in these papers with masterly skill. The value of the coin shilling at various periods is stated in terms of scientific accuracy and the conclusion is reached that the silver shilling derived from the piece of eight in the middle of the century was 62.9 grains of fine silver, coinciding with a shilling which among the various fluctuating values had been twice met with before. It is not possible to reproduce here the various definitions of the coin shilling arrived at by Prof. Sumner, nor would it be profitable to do so in an attempt to show what the community regarded as the shilling in commercial use. It is not so much tile scientific definition of value that we seek, as the opinion of the colonists as to values measured in sterling. This we can to a certain extent accomplish, but the practical disregard by the colonists of any other question in connection with the coins in use than that of weight makes conclusions based upon these opinions of doubtful accuracy. In the long run value undoubtedly asserted itself, but quotations must at times have been at variance with it. Furthermore, the irreconcilable nature of some of the statutes, from which more than one value can be determined, unsettles conclusions based upon them and compels the exercise of independent judgment. In any event whether the reader be competent to test the recorded facts with the skill of an expert numismatist or can simply apply the tests open to an ordinary business man, the recapitulation and study of the same events will be necessary.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER III. THE CURRENCY CONFLICT UNDER DUDLEY AND SHUTE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The relations of the house of representatives to the royal governors under the provincial charter were from the beginning replete with perils of conflict. If under the administration of Phips the actual encounter was postponed, it was partly, no doubt, because the colonists had not yet learned how far they were to be shorn of the privilege of self government which they had enjoyed in the days of the colony. The province charter was heralded to them as a blessing by the boastful Mather and he claimed that his countrymen owed him a debt of gratitude for his services in procuring its issue. Until the Privy Council entered upon the critical supervision and wholesale rejection of the laws passed during the first three years under this charter, the representatives could not have known how far the home government meant to exercise the reserved rights of disapproval of provincial legislation. The passionate and ill-balanced governor nominally at the head of affairs was no longer in the province when the news arrived of the action taken at the meeting of the Privy Council held August 22, 1695, at which amongst so many others, the act in which the exclusive right of taxation was reserved to the General Court met with disapproval. Through knowledge of this action the province was brought face to face with the fact that the Privy Council proposed to exercise actual surveillance over legislation and also did not intend that the possible claim on the part of parliament of a right to tax the colonists should be baldly surrendered. [96] Under these circumstances the probable action of the friends of the old charter became a question of importance. It was well, perhaps, that the fiery Phips, who had already collided with some of the leaders of that party, was not then at the actual head of the government. His representative, Lieutenant-Governor Stoughton was not aggressive enough to please Edward Randolph, the royal collector of customs, who sums up his estimate of the man in the words "he was a good scholar but not bred to military discipline." [97] Stoughton, through his politic affiliations and by his prudent avoidance of self-assertion, warded off collision at that time and maintained a peaceful attitude during his entire administration of affairs, both before and after the brief presence of the Earl of Bellomont.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is quite probable that the enthusiasm with which Bellomont was received and the trust which his genial deportment aroused would have given place to other sentiments if his stay here had been prolonged, but, as it happened, he retained the confidence and good will of the people so long as he remained in the province.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His successor in the gubernatorial chair was a man of widely different surroundings and his advent aroused none of that enthusiasm with which the coming of the Earl of Bellomont was hailed. Joseph Dudley, although a native of Massachusetts, was known to be a courtier and was distrusted by his countrymen. He had already suffered imprisonment, after the overthrow of the Andros government, at the hands of some of the very men who were now prominent in provincial politics. Under the most favorable circumstances a collision between him and the local government might have been expected. As the representative of an autocratic government, himself fully imbued with the notion that the colonies were to be treated as mere dependencies of the crown, he could not have co-operated with a body of men who were seeking to save from the wreck of the old charter some of the planks of self-government which had so long served them in their navigation of the political seas during the days of the colony. It forms no part of my purpose to trace in detail the history of the conflict between the provincial governors and the assembly. Conspicuous as was its function in the formation of the political opinions which made the revolution a possibility, it is mainly important to us because it affected questions connected with the currency.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After the wild plunge was made in the emission of bills for loans, and the recklessness of the province legislature was thoroughly appreciated, the influence of the Board of Trade, which was organized to relieve the Privy Council of the supervision of colonial affairs, that of the royal governors and also, as a rule, that of the province council, was exerted, on the side of conservatism and sound money. The royal instructions, often impolitic and sometimes impracticable, were after that time uniformly couched in restraint of excessive emissions, and the respective royal governors, although at times they connived at evasions of the instructions, generally exerted themselves to secure obedience thereto. The council held a position midway between the governors and the representatives, and their relations to the subject were somewhat in accordance to this position. Although elected by the assembly, still the tradition which attached to them as a sort of upper house, having special powers confided to their execution by the charter, influenced the selection of prominent men as members, who were generally possessed of more than average wealth. Their relations with the governor were closer than their connection with the house, and they were to be relied upon to support him unless some recognized question of principle was involved in the matter under conflict. So that, as we run through the various points of controversy which arose between the governor and the assembly, we find the council sometimes opposed to the house, sometimes acting the role of peacemaker, but occasionally joining hands with the representatives in asserting some principle of self-government. The house, throughout the contest, was persistent in the maintenance of all rights granted to that body by the charter, but on questions of finance it was often unreasonable and intemperate, readily following the lead of any persuasive advocate who might propose a financial heresy and resisting to the utmost all attempts to impose restraint upon its action. In the effort to take into its own hands not only the origination of all appropriations, but also the control of all disbursements, which soon became the settled policy of the representatives, the relations between the house and the governor and council finally assumed such a character of hostility, that reasoning upon that point was thrown away and in the discussions which ensued arguments were wasted. Even as early as 1702, the house locked horns with the board under circumstances so utterly indefensible that it was compelled to abandon its position. The representatives had refused to comply with the request of the governor that they should make an appropriation for the fort at Pemaquid, a work which he had been specially instructed to forward. The board requested a conference on the subject, which conference the house peremptorily declined to grant. Whereupon the board declared that this refusal of a conference upon a matter relating to the government was an infringement of their rights and privileges, and in the end, the house yielded the point.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There were two questions which Dudley under his instructions was compelled to press upon the attention of the assembly, both of which were sure to meet with resistance, and unless the discussions which would inevitably ensue should be conducted with great judgment, feelings would be engendered which would greatly diminish his influence over that body. One of these was the construction of the fort at Pemaquid, the other was the fixing of a salary for the governor of the province. On both of these points the representatives were unwilling to follow the instructions, nor was there any way in which Dudley or any of his successors could overcome their objections and secure obedience. The council, notwithstanding the recent conflict with the house, supported the position assumed by that body with regard to the salary. In his communications with the representatives, Dudley was often abrupt, almost to discourtesy, and in this instance he had curtly called upon them to carry out the instructions. They informed him that the stating of perpetual salaries was not to her Majesty's interest and when he sent down for the house journal in order to inspect it, they told him he might see it in their chamber but declined to send it up to him. The strained relations thus early established through the governor's attempt to enforce his instructions were made more pronounced at a later date by the exercise on his part of the power lodged by the charter in the governor, of negativing councillors not grateful to him, and the attempt on his part to exercise the same power with regard to the speaker whom they had chosen. Thus it came to pass, almost at the beginning of his career as governor, that Dudley established with the body which controlled the making and shaping of the supply bill, relations of such a nature that the representatives would not patiently listen to any advice that he might give them. Nevertheless he felt it incumbent upon him to say something from time to time upon the subject of the currency and it would have been well if they had hearkened to his warnings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The particular business you have before you," he said in 1703, "is the making good the votes of the two last Assemblies in raising the tax for the bills already issued." May 27, 1708, the governor sought to secure legislation which should prevent the bills of credit from declining. "We are all," he said, "sensible of the great service and benefit we have by the bills of credit. It behooves us to be very jealous of their disparagement, and as we always deposited a just fund for their support, so I think now it may be proper to make some Act of the Assembly to prevent their being undersold, and thereby defamed, with penalties thereupon." During the summer of 1711, £50,000 in bills of credit were loaned temporarily to Boston merchants, to enable them to furnish supplies to the Hill and Walker expedition, payment for which supplies was made to the merchants by sterling drafts on London. May 29, 1712, while these bills were still out, the governor said, "I think it necessary also to move you to consider the state of the bills of credit, in which the province has honored themselves by keeping up their just value hitherto." The public bills loaned to the Boston merchants, although the amount was undoubtedly large enough to have had a perceptible influence upon the rate at which the bills were current, could not have been included among those towards which the governor directed his remarks. No obligation rested upon the government to provide by legislation for their retirement. The loans were for a specific period and at maturity the return of the bills to the treasury could be enforced. The apprehensions which Dudley felt for the credit of the bills were, therefore, aroused in behalf simply of the bills which had been issued to meet the charges of the government, but so great was his solicitude that in December, 1712, he recurred to the subject, saying: "Gentlemen, the province has had the benefit of these bills of credit through the course of their long and heavy war and now since her Majesty's wise and steady counsels have brought us into view of peace, we must take care to honor them by passing through the payment of them in such course and method as we have projected in the several acts of the Assembly made and provided for that purpose."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In June 1715, the representatives asserted that the trade of the province was greatly obstructed by the exportation of coin; that the only medium of exchange then passing was bills of credit; that so few of these were in circulation that it would occasion trouble to call in the bills which by the terms of the resolves under which they were issued should by right be called in that year; as a remedy for the trouble they proposed that a part only of these bills should be called in. No damage would accrue from this proceeding, they said, either to the public or to private persons, but on the contrary, it would be for the advantage of all. On the 20th of July, the governor protested against this doctrine and informed them that the bills would be sure to decline if upon any pretext whatsoever they should fail to redeem their promises in calling them in. The representatives showed the value in which the governor's advice was held by them, by voting, the same day, to postpone the retirement of a part of the bills.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The accession of George I, August 1, 1714, produced a lull in the conflict between the governor and the representatives. By an act of Parliament the commission of the governor remained in force for six months after the decease of Queen Anne. It was known that, with her death, Dudley's power at court was greatly diminished, and pending the appointment of a successor, he evidently wished to avoid collision as far as possible. At the expiration of the six months, the governor having no longer a semblance of authority, the council assumed control of the government, to be superseded in turn by Dudley, whose powers were temporarily extended by royal proclamation. March 17, 1715, Elizeus Burgess received the appointment of governor of the province. Burgess was a colonel in the army and had seen service. His appointment was made at a time when the feelings still ran high between the advocates of a currency secured upon real estate, to be issued by a private bank, and their opponents who, in order to defeat the incorporation of the private bank, favored the emission of bills of credit by the province to be loaned for a term of years to citizens. The public bank, as this scheme was denominated, was triumphant. The private bank was frowned upon by the authorities and in November, 1714, £50,000 public bills were issued and loaned to the inhabitants of the province on real security for five years at five per cent. interest, the interest and one-fifth part of the principal to be paid annually. [98] In all this the hand of Joseph Dudley had been felt, and for that reason those who favored the private bank actively opposed his reappointment and were anxious that his successor should take charge of the government. It became known that Col. Burgess did not intend to assume office for some time but proposed to prolong his stay in England and the unusual step was resorted to of procuring and forwarding to Boston exemplified copies of his commission and of the new commission of the Lieutenant-Governor, Colonel William Tailer, who had secured a re-appointment. Both of these were published on the 9th of November. Tailer thereupon assumed the administration of the affairs of the government. He was a native of New England, and a connection of Stoughton's by marriage. He was known to be in favor of the private bank, a fact which secured him the support of a faction in the house of representatives and which was, perhaps, the secret of his brief administration of affairs at this time, but which also served as an obstacle for his retaining the office of lieutenant-governor after Burgess determined not to come to Massachusetts. His views on the subject of banking cost him the support of those who, as it chanced, were able to influence the appointment of a successor to Burgess, and simultaneously the appointment of a new lieutenant-governor. Sir William Ashurst alleged in a letter that the true reason of Tailer's popularity was "his being at the head of the private bank", and this, he added, "I take to be a new and strong reason for putting him out of his employment; and in this I do not rely upon my own judgment, but upon the judgment of many principal gentlemen in the Bank of England, who condemn it [the private bank] as mischievous to the country and calculated to serve private sinister views." The importance of Sir William Ashurst's friendship at this juncture will be apparent if we turn to the pages of Hutchinson for an account of what was then being done in this connection in London. It is there recorded that "Mr. Belcher, afterwards governor, who was very opposite to the bank party, was then in London; he joined with Mr. Dummer, the agent, and they engaged Sir William Ashurst with them, and prevailed upon Burgess for a thousand pounds sterling, which Belcher and Dummer advanced equally between them, to resign his Commission that Colonel Shute might be appointed in his stead." [99]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Colonel Shute whose commission was secured through this advance by Boston capitalists, belonged to a family of dissenters. He had served in the field under King William and had been wounded in one of Marlborough's engagements in Flanders. He stood well at court, was thought to be a "friend of liberty", as the phrase then went and had the reputation, according to Hutchinson, of being humane, frank and generous. Chalmers, whose contempt for him seemed boundless, says: "He was one of those well meaning men, who in private life gain some respect because they are harmless, but he possessed not even the minute intelligence which enables official men of little parts to transact great affairs." [100]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">William Dummer, a native of New England, and a son-in-law of Governor Dudley was at the same time appointed lieutenant-governor. He was a discreet and politic man, who when in charge of the administration yielded upon occasion, even when the prerogatives of his office were undoubtedly invaded, rather than jeopardize the true interests of the province.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It may well be doubted whether the Boston capitalists, who advanced money to secure the appointment of Shute in place of Burgess, gained much by the change. One thing it will, however, be well to note in connection with this extraordinary transaction. Those gentlemen would never have resorted to a method the obvious tendency of which was to bring into disrepute the royal governors of the province, if it had been thought possible at that time to secure the influence and direct the power of the Board of Trade against the private bank. At a later date this was not only accomplished but Parliament itself intervened. It is evident, however, that at this time the opponents of the private bank could find nothing in the English statutes which made the proposed scheme for a bank unlawful and hoped for no aid from the Board of Trade through which they could defeat the supporters of the private bank. It is incredible, otherwise, that they should have resorted to such discreditable methods.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the 22nd of June, 1716, a committee for promoting the produce and trade of the province reported a bill for emitting £100,000 in bills of public credit. The bill failed to pass at that time, but was again brought before the attention of the General Court and on the 1st of August the lieutenant-governor recommended its passage, saying, "I hope if agreed to [it] will greatly tend to the support of the government and the encouragement of trade, therefore I cheerfully recommend it to you." The passage of the bill was not, however, secured at that time, but was still in abeyance when the new governor assumed the administration of affairs. Shute's commission was dated June 15, 1716, and he arrived in Boston on the 4th of October following. He at once put himself into the hands of the opponents of the private bank and in his first speech to the assembly he said, "It is my lot to enter upon this government at a time when your commerce (a very important article of the people's happenings) is under a very great discouragement by an universal want of money, which is the medium of trade. I must, therefore, recommend to you as a matter worthy of your greatest application to find out some effectual measures to supply this want and thereby restore trade to a flourishing condition in which you shall have my best endeavors and hearty concurrence."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The temporary loan of £50,000 to Boston merchants was at that time nearly all paid up, but the £50,000 loaned, at interest, in 1714 was still afloat. Profiting by the experience gained by these emissions, which avoided the necessity of laying taxes for calling in the bills and which through interest on the loans could be made to contribute towards the support of the government, the legislature acted on this advice and December 4, 1716 passed an act for emitting £100,000 to be distributed proportionately to the counties and to be loaned to the inhabitants of the province at five cent. interest, on real security for ten years, alleging in the preamble that "the bills of credit on the Province, being yearly called in, are now grown very scarce, and few of them passing in proportion to the great demand for the same." [101] The marked effect of this loan on silver and exchange seems to have opened Shute's eyes to the situation, for in April, 1717 he spoke of the "intolerable discount" on the bills, concerning which he said in May of the same year that he could not forbear alluding to it again as a matter of great importance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was a clause in the £100,000 loan act which authorized the commissioners to lend again any sums which should be paid in before the expiration of the ten years for which the sums were to be loaned. The obvious purpose of this was to keep the entire sum afloat during the period of the loan, in the hopes that it would relieve the pressing demand for currency. As early as February, 1718, Shute became convinced that this would work badly and on the sixth of that month he urged the repeal of this clause. He placed himself squarely among the advocates of a metallic currency the same month, saying: "We shall never be upon a firm and lasting foundation, 'til we recover and return to silver and gold, the only true species of money."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In May he urged the assembly to find some means to advance the sinking credit of the public bills, saying that the ill consequences of not giving the matter due attention were daily increasing and would inevitably end in the ruin of the province if not timely prevented. Delays, he said, were highly dangerous. The miserable record of their neighbors at Carolina, he thought, might awaken them. If nothing were done at this session he was persuaded that it would prove thereafter to be too late. A committee, appointed by the governor and council on the second of June, 1718, to consider of some fit expedient for raising the value of the bills of credit of this province, and recovering the trade out of its present decay, could suggest no better remedies than are to be found in the following propositions:—1. That credit be limited; 2. That the governor's recommendation as to the repeal of the clause in the £100,000 emission, which has been already alluded to, be carried out; 3. That the exportation of silver and gold be prohibited. [102]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">May 28, 1719, Shute called attention to the fact that his Majesty was always inculcating from the throne the danger of postponing the payment of parliamentary securities and the necessity of constantly supporting the credit of Great Britain. He felt it to be his duty to give the same advice to the assembly. Again, on the 13th of July 1790, he urged the General Court not to postpone the bills as they had too often done, to the detriment of the government and the lessening of the value of the bills. On the 19th the representatives satirically expressed their great pleasure and satisfaction at the successive reminders they had received from the governor upon the necessity of maintaining the bills, but included in their message a recommendation that produce, as well as bills, should be received in the treasury in payment of taxes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In 1721, on the 15th of March, the governor in a speech told the representatives that he had consulted with some of the principal gentlemen and merchants of Boston as to some scheme to redress the grievances under which they were laboring for want of a medium of trade. He then added, "The redress seems to be very much within the compass of every man's capacity, I mean to be frugal and industrious, without which the mines of Peru and Mexico would not make you a happy and prosperous commerce." The representatives replied that they agreed with the governor in his opinion that further issues would depreciate the bills, and they had as a remedy passed a bill restraining traffic in money except at the rates fixed by the act of Parliament.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notwithstanding the governor's opinion that silver and gold were the only true money, he approved another loan bill in March, 1721, at which time £50,000 were distributed among towns, to be loaned on real or personal security, the interest on the loans being intended to be for the benefit of the towns. The rate was not specified. The loans were to be called in, £10,000 a year, 1726-1730 inclusive. [103]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By the summer of 1721, the various points at issue between the governor and the representatives had reached so great a magnitude and the conflict had assumed such an acute form that the usefulness of Shute at the head of the administration was much impaired. The import duty laid upon English merchandise in 1718 and the tonnage duty imposed upon English built ships at the same date had brought down upon the assembly the rebuke of the Lords Justices who in the absence of the King were administering the affairs of the kingdom. [104] A new instruction was sent to Shute by the Board of Trade in 1721. This was known as the 14th instruction and by its terms he was required to submit to the crown for approval all acts authorizing the issue of bills of credit unless the same were issued to meet necessary charges. The acts thus to be submitted were required to contain a clause suspending their execution until approved by the crown. Hutchinson makes the statement that this instruction was not occasioned by the bad effect of the bills upon the currency but by a complaint from some merchants of New York relative to a specific act passed by the New York assembly; whereupon to prevent similar acts in the future this instruction was issued. [105]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the tenth of June the house inquired of the governor how this instruction was to be applied. On the 13th he requested the representatives to state what the difficulty was which they had encountered. They replied that the exception in the instructions was the cause of their trouble. Under this exception, bills could be issued for raising and settling a public revenue for defraying the necessary expenses of the government according to the instructions already given. Can the governor, said they, give his assent to an act or order for raising and settling a revenue, that is, by fixing a settled salary on himself and other officers in the government, without inserting the clause, that the act shall not take effect until approved by the crown, or must any act making such an allowance contain the clause referred to? This point was what the representatives Plate 5 Three 1 s. bills, 1713 Plates. wished to have cleared up and they felt themselves inadequate for the task since this instruction referred to other instructions which had not been communicated to them. Shute fell into the trap and submitted the question to the council, who unanimously decided that appropriations of this sort did not require the approval of the crown before they should become operative. A precedent was thus established which became of great value to the representatives in their discussions upon this point at a later day. [106]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This triumph of the representatives over the governor, and it may also be said over the Privy Council was to all intents and purposes the end of the conflict between the governor and the house on matters connected with finance, so far as the prerogatives of the office or the instructions under which the governor acted were concerned. During the remainder of the time that Shute was in the province the representatives occupied what time they devoted to this subject in a heated contest with the council, over the control of the disbursements under the supply bill. In 1721, the house inserted in the supply bill a clause limiting the application to the purposes expressed in the resolve in these words: "and for no other ends or uses whatsoever." To the use of this phrase the council demurred and for a time no appropriation was possible, each party to the contest asserting that the responsibility for the situation rested with the other.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In March, 1722, a resolve was passed authorizing the issue of bills to meet the expenses of the government, in which the obnoxious phrase was not inserted, but the purposes of the house were accomplished through a clause at the end of each appropriation to the effect that the aforesaid amount was "to be drawn out of the Treasury for the ends and uses above appropriated only."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The sudden and unexpected departure of Shute from the province in 1723, produced consternation in the minds of the representatives. They assumed that he had gone to England and that his purpose was to lay his grievances before the crown. [107]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The overthrow of the projectors of the land bank, in 1714, temporarily checked the discussion of projects of that nature. It did not, however, entirely check the publication of pamphlets treating of matters connected with the currency. A writer in 1716 discussed the projects for banks which had been submitted by their friends. [108] He was a believer in paper money and thought the province might furnish it through loans to towns or better yet the business men of the province might organize a private bank and emit an adequate supply.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In 1719, another writer took up the subject and published two pamphlets in which he attacked the whole system under which the bills had been issued and demonstrated with clearness and vigor the many fallacies which existed concerning them. [109]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In 1720 and for a time thereafter the advocates of a private bank were quite active and there were numerous publications during this controversy. The first among these was a pamphlet entitled "The Distressed State of the Town of Boston," which was written by John Colman, whose subsequent connection with the Land Bank of 1740 made him notorious. [110] Undue importance was attached to this publication and the author was arrested in a criminal suit for libel. This resulted in the appearance of a number of controversial pamphlets most of them being of little importance. [111]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Among the pamphlets brought forth at this time was one which contained a suggestion for a bank which should emit long term notes on security, the same to be paid in commodities. [112] Another advocated a resumption of specie payments upon a plan similar to the subscription loan which was attempted a few years later. Merchants were to borrow from the province public bills of credit and repay the province in silver. [113]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The form of the bill which the writer proposed to emit is rather interesting since it states the value in proclamation money or rather in the standard established by the proclamation. [114]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A writer who believed that the prosperity of the country rested upon trade and that the amount of exports should exceed the imports in order that this should be advantageous, advocated the restoring and upholding of the public credit as a good way to end these controversies.

      <field name="fulltext">An advocate of paper currency set forth his opinions in 1720 in a letter to an eminent clergyman, [116] and another holding similar views demonstrated in 1721 that the evils of the situation were to be traced to the extravagance of the people. [117]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Reverend John Wise of Chebacco came to the rescue of the friends of a private bank in a long pamphlet in 1721. [118] This year was also signalized by the publication of an extremely valuable tract which contains a great deal of information difficult to find elsewhere in print. The author, who is opposed to paper money, devoted himself to an historical investigation of the origin of the bills and to a discussion of their effects upon the prosperity of the province. [119] After this the activity of the pamphleteers temporarily ceased.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER IV. THE CONTEST UNDER DUMMER AND BURNET.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Shute did not return to the province after his sudden departure in 1723. The representatives were correct in their conjecture that it was his intention to carry his complaints before the crown. It is not probable that he had any desire to renew the conflict on this side of the Atlantic. The responsibilities of the situation which he left behind him devolved upon the shoulders of Lieutenant-Governor Dummer, a man who thoroughly appreciated the difficulties with which he had to deal and who, while anxious to avoid conflict, was nevertheless desirous to carry out the royal instructions, under which the government was to be conducted. In the administration of affairs he found no relief either through the modification of these instructions or through any change of temper in the house. The representatives continued hotly to press their claims to control the disbursements made under the appropriations and were unwilling to pass any supply bill unless the same was so phrased that they could have a hand in auditing the accounts. In these contests they were accustomed to collate the various alleged misapplications of funds which they discovered in overhauling the accounts and publish them in the form of a series of what they termed "grievances."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In June of the year 1723, a resolve for the emission of twenty thousand pounds, so phrased as to cover the point above alluded to, was sent up to the council. The board passed the same but so amended as to restore the power of supervising disbursements to the governor and council. These amendments the house rejected unanimously, whereupon the council voted to adhere to them. The representatives then passed an order that the whole question should be postponed to the next session, to the end that they might have an opportunity to submit the whole matter together with their list of grievances to the people whom they represented. To this the board replied that the postponement of the consideration of the supply of the treasury at a time when they were actually at war could not fail to be prejudicial to the interests of the province. They expressed surprise at the action of the representatives, the tendency of which was to keep up the misunderstanding between the board and the house, to misrepresent the action of the board to the people of the province and to subvert the very foundations of the government. They thought some amicable method could be devised to settle the difficulty and suggested a conference.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The representatives in reply expressed a willingness to furnish the treasury with a supply of money and claimed that the proposed restrictions and limitations were founded in reason; that the grievances which they had submitted were occasioned by violations of the authority conferred in previous appropriations; that the restrictions which they had imposed were in conformity with the powers granted to the General Court by the charter; and that it would have been a violation of trust not to have imposed them. They resented the language used by the board, asserted that they were ever ready to cultivate harmony between the two houses and concluded the discussion by sending up a new resolve for supplying the treasury. This resolve being still obnoxious in form was amended by the council, and again the representatives unanimously rejected the amendments. In concluding the message announcing this disagreement, they stated that as they had done all that they could in consonance with security to the rights, privileges and estates of his Majesty's good subjects to procure an agreement on these points, and as there was no probability of its being accomplished, they were extremely desirous to have the court rise that day.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The board suggested that the house might at least make provision for what had already been spent under authority of that court, which could be done without leaving the disposition entirely under control of the governor and council and upon this basis, the representatives having carried their point, a resolve for the supply of the treasury was carried. In thus submitting, the lieutenant-governor and the council undoubtedly yielded what they regarded as prerogatives under the charter, rather than accept the perils which the representatives stood ready to incur in order to carry their point.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In 1727, the loans made under the £100,000 issue in 1716 matured. On the 1st of June, the lieutenant governor called attention to the fact that he was instructed to take care that these loans should be retired and that the bills should be destroyed by May, 1728. He was also instructed, he said, not to approve any act for creating a paper currency without his Majesty's express leave for that purpose. On the 16th of June he showed his solicitude with regard to the £100,000 issue for loans, by requesting the assembly to make provision for the destruction of the bills which had already been paid in to the commissioners under the provisions of the act. On the 28th he approved a resolve authorizing the emission of £16,000 already in the hands of the treasurer, to be applied for current expenses.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Meantime, a committee on the bills of public credit had been appointed and had reported on the 22nd of June. In consideration of the distressed condition of the inhabitants of the province and in consequence of the scarcity of the bills, they recommended an emission of £50,000. These were to be acquired by calling in the bills in the hands of the commissioners which Dummer had just urged them to cause to be destroyed, and what was wanting to make up the £50,000 was to be furnished by the treasurer. The amount thus obtained was to be distributed to the towns, to be loaned to the inhabitants, and the interest on the loans was to be applied in support of the government. After six years the principal was to be paid in five annual payments of one fifth each. Provision was also to be made for the payment of so much of the £100,000 issue for loans as still remained outstanding, in ten annual payments of one tenth each. This committee was requested to prepare proper resolves to carry out the recommendations of the report. Dummer's request that they should cause the bills in the hands of the commissioners to be destroyed was thus met by an attempt to put them in circulation. His statement that he was instructed to see that the loans were retired was in turn met by a proposition to extend the time for their payment. He, therefore, sent in a message on the 5th of July stating that he would sign such a bill if a clause were inserted that it should not take effect until approved by his Majesty. This was accepted by the house for just what it meant and their reply to it was a postponement on the next day of the consideration of the tax bill to the next session. This was followed by a discussion between the house and the lieutenant governor on the question of the instructions which was concluded by the passage on the part of the representatives of a resolve which they knew would be ineffectual, authorizing the commissioners of the £100,000 issue for loans to let out any part of it which was in their hands. The lieutenant governor was, perhaps, equally conscious that he was wasting his words when on the 18th of August he urged action towards bringing in these loans.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the 25th of August, 1727, a contention began between the board and the house concerning the neglect of the house to make provision for calling in the issues of 1723-24. The board insisted that the promises then made should be redeemed and that it was the duty of the house to effect at once the legislation necessary for the purpose. Whereupon the representatives sent a message to the lieutenant governor that having no business to transact they were ready to adjourn. To this, the lieutenant governor replied next day that they had not passed a tax bill and that it was not for the honor of the province that they should adjourn. On the 28th the house replied to the message. They denied any knowledge of or responsibility for the engagements of a previous house. If all such were made under the supposition that they were for the benefit of the province and this house found that it would be detrimental to carry them out it was their duty to break such engagements. They then went on to say: "And whereas it seems to be the opinion of your Honours that the drawing in the bills at the time proposed is the only foundation of their credit, we cannot but be surprised thereat, since not one person of a thousand that takes one of them knows when it will be called in, and yet very eagerly grasps all he can of them because he knows they will answer on all his private business and commerce, and also in all public payments as the Bill itself assures him, and that we take to be the reason of their credit and currency and not the promise of the Government when they are to be called in."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the 30th of August the board took up the question of the necessity for legislation to redeem the promises made in 1723-24 when the issues of that date were made. They referred to the gross mistakes and misapprehensions of the house. They asserted that the board had justly and properly declared the engagements then made to be the "solemn promises of the General Court" and then said, "'tis, nevertheless, most true and will admit of no dispute that such as understand themselves and their interests in respect to these bills, do and must always value them in proportion to the punctuality that is observed by the government in calling them in at the times prefixed." The house made no answer to this, but sent a message to the lieutenant-governor that having no business they desired to rise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the 15th of December the opinion of the house was taken as to what it was their duty to do in the premises. Bills of credit had grown scarce and silver was sent to Great Britain, so that the funds for supplying the treasury in former emissions of bills of credit could not be answered and discharged by a public tax. Considering this condition of affairs, was it not the indispensable duty of the court to pass acts in conformity with the charter for the emission of enough bills to pay public dues without oppression to the tax payers ? Would not the emission of a greater amount than was necessary to discharge the debts of the government greatly tend to the public good? If this were not done would not the inhabitants be reduced almost to ruin ? To all of these questions the house voted an affirmative reply.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the 16th the board requested the house not to print the foregoing in their journal. They (the council) would take the matter up in a few days when they hoped there would be a fuller attendance of the members which seemed desirable for the proper consideration of the subject. This reply of the council was on the 18th referred to a committee by the house. On the 19th, the board non-concurred in the vote of the house on the foregoing questions, but stated that they were ready to join the house in issues of bills of credit which should be made in accordance with the charter and so framed that their value might be ascertained and properly secured. Before this proposition reached the house, the speaker in behalf of the committee to whom the request of the council that the house should not permit their action on the 15th to be incorporated in the published journal of their proceedings, had already reported. The house, this committee said, wanted to know whether the legislature would make more emissions. If the board should say no, then consideration of the matter was fruitless. As to the publication of what they had done, the house had no better way of showing the people whom they represented that they had been faithful in the performance of their duties. The message from the council was received by the house before this report was acted on but did not affect the result. The house being of opinion that the action proposed by the board was not of such a character as to alter their conclusions, adopted the report and sent it up to the council.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the 10th of January, 1727, 28, the lieutenant governor urged the representatives to take action on the appropriations. They replied that they had already passed resolves for the supply of bills of credit which had not been concurred in. There was no probability of an agreement being obtained so far as they could see and they, therefore, asked the lieutenant-governor to adjourn the court.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In order to secure relief from the supposed stringency of public bills and to reduce the complaints of the scarcity of money, a scheme was devised for fortifying a number of coast towns. The bills requisite for the purpose were to be issued and lent to the towns where the fortifications were to be constructed. Hutchinson calls attention to the fact that even Truro on the Cape was included in the list. [120] After repeated disagreements between the board and the house the bill, authorizing emissions for this purpose, was finally passed on the 26th of January, 1727, 28. On the 26th the lieutenant governor asked the council whether it was consistent with his instructions that he should sign the bill without a clause requiring its submission to his Majesty. The answer was in the negative.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As a part of the proceedings through which the passage of the fortification bill in the council had been secured, a resolve for the enforcement of the terms of the mortgages given to the commissioners of the £100,000 for loans was simultaneously passed. If the mortgage loans were not paid in installments covering a three years extension of the loan they were to be foreclosed. This concession had been made by the representatives in the belief that it would secure the assent of the governor to the fortification bill. The refusal of the council to advise him that he could consistently sign it prevented this consummation from being attained. On the other hand they did advise him that he could consistently with his instructions assent to the method of bringing to an end the £100,000 loan. This produced great feeling in the house. Meantime the lieutenant governor as well as several of the council were dependent upon their salaries, and as no provision had as yet been made in this direction, he on the 28th of January called for the passage of the salary act. He had approved every act, he said, except the fortification bill. The question of bills of credit was involved in that, he would have signed it but the council were of opinion that this was not consistent with his instructions. On the 29th the house expressed "an Universal Surprizing Concern" that the bill for whose birth the lieutenant-governor was himself responsible should have met with non-acceptance at his hands. They claimed that the instructions did not stand in the way of the passage of the bill and referred to the precedent in Governor Shute's time. "We cannot," they said, "but please ourselves, had a more general and proper question been put" to the council, that "they had given their advice to Your Honor to sign the bill." In consequence of this act of the lieutenant-governor's they felt obliged to refer other matters of consideration to the next session when, perhaps, something might be accomplished to relieve the people. If they should act now they would not be true to the trust reposed in them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the 30th the lieutenant-governor replied that he did not wish to protract the session and that they had done him injustice in suppressing in their published journal his answer wherein he had told them that he would adjourn the court whenever they should provide for the support of the government.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A temporary recess was then taken and on the 14th of February when the court was again convened, a committee was appointed to prepare a bill for the issue of a suitable sum of bills of credit. On the 15th an act was introduced for the emission of £60,000. This was so phrased as to avoid the obstacle placed by the instructions in the way of its approval. The house then made a formal reply to the lieutenant-governor's message of the 30th ult. They rehearsed the various resolves which they had passed to supply the government with funds and the resolve with reference to the fortifications to which they had agreed, all of which had proved ineffectual. They made an historical review of the various emissions of bills which had taken place and argued that under the charter the power was given them to pass such acts. They claimed that if the lieutenant-governor had taken into due consideration the language of the charter and the powers given him in his commission, in connection with the instructions, he might have signed the bill. They reviewed what had taken place and claimed that they were not open to censure.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The bill for the emission of £60,000 was then put through, but the lieutenant-governor on the 20th of February announced that he regretted that he could not sign it. He had asked the advice of the council but they had not thought proper to give him any more advice. He had the satisfaction of knowing that he had done his duty to his Majesty, at the same time that he had a sincere desire to have answered the earnest expectation of the house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The house at once replied that the council which now refused to advise the lieutenant governor had on the 26th of January been free with their advice and they now requested the board to reconsider their action. This had the desired effect. A reconsideration was had by the council and a qualified approval of the bill given, sufficiently strong to serve as a defence for the lieutenant governor in case he should be called to account for signing the bill. Dummer signed the bill February 21, 1727-28, and reported fully to the Lords of Trade what had taken place, saying that he conceived himself to be in a difficult and dangerous place. [121] The £60,000 emitted by this act were distributed among the towns in the same way as were the £50,000 emitted in 1721. The rate of interest on the loan was fixed at six per cent. which was to be paid to trustees. Two-thirds of the interest collected by the trustees was to be remitted to the province treasury—the balance was for the benefit of the towns. The bills were to be called in by taxes to be laid in the years 1734-38 inclusive.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the spring of 1728, Governor Burnet arrived in the province. He was a son of Bishop Burnet and had been governor of New York and New Jersey. He was an alert, quick-witted man, prompt to decide and quick to act. He was armed with the usual instructions as to salary, and was keen enough to convert the pompous demonstrations on his arrival into an argument that the province could afford to settle a suitable compensation upon the governor. There was much to hope for in the welcome with which he was received and had he been a man of different temperament it is quite possible that he might for a time at least have had a peaceful administration. His views as to the powers of the crown and the dependency of the colonies were, however, Plate 6 18 d. , 2 s. and 5 s. bills, 1713 Plates. inconsistent with any such result and the arrogant manner in which he bore himself served to intensify the conflict and to widen the breach between the assembly and the royal governors.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">During his entire administration, he was engaged in a controversy with the house and among the topics on which they differed the currency was one. On the 20th of August, 1728, he communicated to them the fifteenth instruction which had been given him. It was that "you do not give assent to or pass any Act in our Province of the Massachusetts Bay under your government whereby bills of credit may be struck or issued in lieu of money unless a clause be inserted in said Act directing that the same shall not take effect until the said Act shall have been approved and confirmed by us." September 17th in a message he accused the house of having used their power of withholding supplies "to compel the Lieutenant Governor unto a compliance." The fall of the bills of credit he attributed to the lack of a sufficient check on the part of the other branches of the government. To this the house replied on the 19th that the true reason of the decline of the bills was that they "were not made a tender in all payments whatsoever." As to the coercion of the lieutenant-governor they thought the council had upon deliberation changed their minds. On the 24th Burnet told the house that to extend the legal tender attribute of the bills would make them fall lower. "Liberty is the life of credit," said he, "and force its greatest enemy."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Burnet had from the outset been anxious to enforce that part of his instructions in which he was urged to secure for the governor a fixed salary instead of an annual appropriation for services. He had recommended to the Board of Trade that the £60,000 loan be permitted to stand, provided the interest should be appropriated for the salary of the governor, and on the first of October he announced to the house that there was reason to apprehend that the bill would be disallowed. This was one of the last moves taken by the governor in the animated discussion concerning the fixing of his salary. He had already without effect advised them to take care that their proceedings did not bring the charter into danger. In this instance, the house had but little to fear from a disapproval. The bills had already been issued and there was no practical method in which a disallowance of the bill on the part of the crown could be enforced. On the 23rd of October the house declined to carry out his suggestion and on the 24th he adjourned the court to meet at Salem on the 31st where, as he said, "prejudice"—referring to the stand upon the salary question taken by the Boston Town Meeting— "had not taken root and where, of consequence, his Majesty's service would be better answered." [122]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He had expressed the opinion that the house had undertaken "to compel" Lieutenant-Governor Dummer "unto a compliance," and he soon found himself in a position where he could exercise powers of the same sort. No appropriation could become effective until he should sign it; the representatives therefore could not get their own pay except by his consent. April 18, 1729, when the court was dissolved, he said to the house, "You may be desirous to know why I have not yet signed an order upon the treasury for your pay, but if you consider that near a third part of the time of the sitting of the general assembly since my arrival has been rendered useless by your refusing to do the business of the province, it may justly appear doubtful whether the towns ought to bear an expense, the sole end of which was defeated for so long a time by that refusal, though I confess this does not relate to those members who were of another opinion."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the next session of the court, a resolve was passed on the 4th of July, 1729, appropriating £20,000, the form used being the same as had been customary. This the governor disallowed, saying that he did not think it proper to consent to any form for the supply of the treasury but what was practiced before 1721, thus reviving the old contest of the days of Shute. The house replied that this question had been the source of many disputes between the two houses which had been prejudicial to the welfare of the province; that the form had been determined upon after many solemn debates and had been consented to by the commander-in-chief; and further they believed it to be conformable to the practice of parliament. At the next session an unsuccessful attempt was made by the house to put through a similar resolve in the same form but this time the council took up the battle and amended it, which resulted in its failure.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Burnet's death in September put a stop to the quarrel. Notwithstanding his persistent efforts to carry out his instructions to the letter and the uninterrupted hostility of his relations with the house of representatives, he was honored and respected by them and the ceremonies of his burial were as pompous as those of his reception by the province.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After his death Dummer again assumed control of the government. The contest over the questions which Burnet had raised were still possessed of much vitality but Dummer was more compliant in his nature and the conflict between the lieutenant-governor and the General Court was not so violent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">During the period which we are now considering the hard-money men began a struggle for the resumption of specie payments which shows itself in the records of tile legislative proceedings of the province from 1728 to 1739 inclusive. The culmination of the struggle in 1738 and 1739 was characterized by defeat under circumstances which must have made it particularly hard for them to bear, because it is evident that they were hopeful of success. The details connected with the attempt at this later date will be considered in their chronological order in the narrative. Mention of the affair is made here simply because in the vague and shadowy outline which we obtain of certain events which took place in 1728 and 1729 we can trace the beginning of a movement which at a later date can be followed to the minutest detail of performance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In February, 1727-1728, a committee was appointed to receive and consider, in the recess of the court, any scheme for retrieving the value of the bills of credit or for making a suitable provision for a medium of trade, and this committee was authorized to take subscriptions of any persons for the fulfillment of such scheme or schemes, and make report thereon. [123]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">December 20, 1729, a bill which had been introduced some days before, entitled "An Act for retrieving and ascertaining the value of the Bills of Credit on this Province" was read a second time, and it was ordered that the bill should be printed with the amendments then made, and that the further consideration thereof be referred to the next session of the court and that in the meantime a committee should take subscriptions of such gentlemen as were willing to subscribe as undertakers in that affair and report to the court thereon. The pages of the house journal do not indicate the nature of these subscriptions, but in 1736 a pamphlet was published in which a scheme was propounded for the emission of bills, the value of which should be expressed in a fixed rate of silver, which bills were to be loaned to merchants, the borrowers to repay their loans in silver. [124]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In this pamphlet the author states that the scheme which is therein advocated had already been submitted several times to the consideration of the assembly. As if to help us in determining the actual character of these two attempts to secure subscriptions for the purpose of retrieving the value of the bills of credit, we find the name of Thomas Hutchinson, the father of the governor, on each of the committees appointed to receive subscriptions. It is not perhaps assuming too much to say that the schemes advocated by Thomas Hutchinson, senior, which were submitted in 1738 and the spring of 1739, for securing a return to specie payments, through loans to merchants, of bills valued at a fixed rate in silver, which loans were to be repaid in coin, probably represents what was attempted in 1728 and 1729. [125]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The discussion after 1741 was mainly devoted to questions relating to the currency. In 1743, there was a notable contribution to it in the form of an inquiry into the state of the bills of credit, which was written by some person thoroughly familiar with the subject. [126] The pamphlet contains much valuable information not otherwise accessible.&gt;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The inclusion of Massachusetts and Connecticut in the denunciations against Rhode Island led a writer to enter upon the discussion in 1744 for the purpose of protesting against it. [127] His pamphlet has but little value. These publications did not entirely cease even after the adoption of the plan for resuming specie payments. [128]</field>

      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER V. THE CURRENCY, 1702-1730: DEPRECIATION AND REMEDIAL LEGISLATION.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The revival of the bank controversy which again attracted public attention in the third decade of the century seems to have been due to the conditions under which the province bills were put forth after 1730. For a better appreciation of what the changes were which then took place, and for a clear understanding of the causes which led to them, a review of the history of the currency issues is essential. The depreciation had by this time called forth a volume of remedial legislation and propositions for laws, so great that their consideration at this point is also forced upon us. In a general way, a statement might be made in a few words which would comprehend the events during the period and fix the responsibility for the results with reasonable judgment. The task of analyzing the details of these events is full of difficulty and the prospect of reward through the discovery of new material which shall throw light upon the subject is slight indeed. Nevertheless it would be an evasion of an obvious duty in the treatment of the subject to accept, without further effort, the conclusions of such writers as Hutchinson and Douglass, and it may, perhaps, be a satisfaction if we shall discover at every turn precisely the results that might have been predicted from surrounding conditions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Up to 1702, the annual issues and re-issues of the colony currency were accompanied by a statement in the several acts authorizing them, that "the present tax," that is, the tax of that year, was a fund for the retirement of the bills. In 1702, the practice was begun of postponing the time for levying the tax through which the bills should be called in. At first it was for one year. In 1704, the retirement of a part of the issues was carried forward to two years. In 1707, the time was lengthened to three years. In 1709, a part of the issues were not to be provided for until five years had elapsed. In 1711, the limit reached six years, and in 1714, another year was added. In this manner the dates for levying the taxes which were to retire the bills were from time to time postponed until 1722, when £6000 were issued not to be called in for thirteen years. Then an effort was made to cure this evil, and for a brief time short periods were assigned for retirements. These, however, were again lengthened, until, in 1730, £13,000 were issued which were not to be called in until 1741. In addition to this, the representatives in 1715, refused to make provision for calling in all the bills which by the terms of the funds established when they were issued, then matured, and after a prolonged struggle carried their point and postponed the retirement of a part of the issue seven years longer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The effect of the redundancy of the currency; of the postponement of the dates at which provision was to be made for calling it in; and of the failure to abide by the terms of the acts of issues, is shown by the course of sterling exchange and by the movement of the price of silver. It is important, however, to bear in mind that quotations are invariably given in terms of "lawful money."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The rates of silver covering this period are to be found in the draft of an "act for the regulating, ascertaining and fixing the value of the bills of publick credit and for rendering the payment of debts more equitable and thereby to prevent any oppression or injury to debtors or creditors." [129] This act was introduced and read twice in the council, but failed to pass. It is however equally available for our purpose.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">During the period of the decline of the notes the influence of the governors and of the council, especially after the decline became sufficiently pronounced for them to recognize the causes, was as a rule on the side of conservatism. They had no remedy to propose, but the governors in their speeches repeatedly pointed out the evils which would arise from failure on the part of the assembly to call in the notes at the appointed time, and the council many times refused to concur in bills which postponed these retirements. The effect upon those who were depending upon fixed incomes payable in current funds very soon manifested itself, and in a similar way the post office department was affected. Its charges were fixed and no compensation was possible for the loss occasioned by the decline of the currency. In 1713, the department complained to the Board of Trade that it could not get its dues for this reason. [130]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The governors not infrequently pointed out that the allowances made them for their services ought to be increased proportionately to the diminution in the purchasing power of the bills, and the members of the board and of the house took care that their own per diem pay was suitably adjusted. "I own some part of this community can fence against this evil," said Governor Shute in 1716, "and ward it off from themselves by advancing their commodities, but the other part must unavoidably suffer. All rents must fall of consequence, and what will your ministers do, who are highly worthy of their salaries, how heavily it will fall upon them and their families, when what they are paid in grows low in value and their necessaries in life are daily advancing."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hutchinson writing concerning affairs in 1720, says: "The depreciation was grievous to all creditors, but particularly distressing to the clergy and other salary men, to widows and orphans whose estates consisted of money at interest, perhaps just enough to support them, and being reduced to one half the former value, they found themselves on a sudden in a state of poverty and want. Executors and administrators, and all who were possessed of the effects of others in trust, had a strong temptation to retain them. The influence a bad currency has upon the morals of the people is greater than is generally imagined." [131]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The clergymen of the province felt keenly the effects of the depreciation and an occasional reference in a published sermon shows that they introduced the subject in the pulpit. The following quotation will illustrate their method of treatment. [132]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is not the depreciating the bills of publick credit matter of provocation?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Answer. It must needs be, for great wrong is done to many persons who have received them according to their denominations; and have been forced to put them off as if they were of less value. Some men are able to help themselves, by getting greater wages for their work, and advancing the price of what they bring to the market; but others have been great sufferers by this practice: and if ever the bills are called in; such as are in debt, either to the publick, or to particular persons, will be great loosers. It may be some of them will be undone thereby. The temptation to the merchants was to get the money into their own hands, that thereby they might make returns to England. They would give thirty shillings in bills for twenty in silver." [133]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In a discourse preached on fast day, January 1747-48, the Rev. Nathaniel Appleton referred to the effect of the depreciation of the currency upon incomes and salaries. He pointed out how it affected officers and soldiers, widows, fatherless children, school masters, priests, the Lord's ministers and many others who live upon stated salaries. What he said about widows has been often quoted but will bear repeating : "Is there not the cry of many widows , who have taken up with a certain sum, or income, in paper bills, instead of their dower ; that the value thereof is sunk in such a manner, and will purchase so much less of the necessities of life than at first, that they are brought into great difficulties for a living; and can get no redress." This sermon was published [134] and in a note the author pursued the subject as follows:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am credibly informed of an ancient widow, whose husband died more than forty years ago, who had three pounds a year settled upon her, instead of dower; which three pounds would at that day, and at the place where she lives, procure toward her support, the following articles; viz: Two cords of wood, four bushels of Indian corn, one bushel of rye, one bushel of malt, fifty pound of pork and sixty pound of beef; which would go a considerable way towards the support of a single woman. Now she can at most demand but seventeen shillings and three pence , new tenor; which is but about an eight part of her original three pounds; and be sure won't purchase more than half a quarter of the above necessaries of life ; and this she must take up with, because there is no remedy in the land for her. And this is, in measure, the deplorable case of many widows in the land."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the 14th of January, 1725-26, Warham Mather enclosed in a letter to Judge Sewall an argument against the emission of more paper money. [135] The author of this document classifies the sufferers from the inflated currency under seven headings: 1, ecclesiastical men; 2, orphans; 3, demandants on bills and bonds; 4, merchants having book debts; 5, lessors on long leases; 6, public officers; 7, the whole country.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">During this period a practice was established of paying laborers in orders upon shops. This was nominally based upon the stringency of the currency and while it was in its infancy did not attract much attention. At a later date these orders, although the volume of them never could have been large enough to have seriously affected the currency, were still sufficiently in evidence to be christened "shop notes," under which title they are frequently alluded to. The writer of a pamphlet in 1720 refers to "men who turn poor laborers and tradesmen off with one half or two thirds goods," showing that the process was then sufficiently pronounced to attract attention. [136]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The town of Boston in a petition to the governor [137] December 29, 1735, complains that the abundance of European goods imported "exposed the inhabitants to appear in extravagant garbs, who would gladly avoid the same were they to receive money in lieu of their labor, manufactures and trade." The petition goes on to state that "they can not be paid but by notes on shops, which can not be avoided though allowed to be very pernicious."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Douglass, writing in 1739 concerning wages, says that they are reduced by obliging the laborer "to take one half in shop goods at 25 per cent. or more advance above the money price." [138] Another writer refers in 1740, to a pernicious practice and cheating method of substituting drafts on shops in the place of a medium to pay artificers and poor laborers. [139] The caulkers in 1741 alleged that they had for "many years labored amid great inconvenience and had suffered much damage, wrong and injury, in receiving pay for their work by notes on shops for money or goods." [140]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One incident that occurred in the summer of 1711, is of interest in connection with the phase of the subject which we are now discussing, not only because we can obtain through its examination the details concerning a temporary loan of public bills effected at that time, but also because it furnishes us with one of the official statements of the rate of exchange, which we are enabled to pick up from time to time General Hill and Admiral Walker were about to undertake a joint expedition against Quebec. The combined forces of the army and navy were compelled to lay in supplies in Boston. The amount required was so great that all New England could not furnish it and prices rose in response to the demand. The first effort of the government was to check this by legislation and an order was passed "that no provisions, liquors or other things necessarily demanded for the service be any ways enhanced in the price thereof by reason of that occasion, but be had and taken at the ordinary market prices they stood at, at the time of the arrival of his Majesty's ships, the eighth current, with certain intelligence of the said designed expedition." It was proposed to pay for what supplies could be procured with bills of exchange on the Victualling Board, but the pay masters were unable to come to terms with the merchants of Boston. The governor and council were consulted and Sewall in his diary gives a quaint account of the meeting at which this consultation took place, entering into details as to the position at the table of the governor, the general, the admiral, the paymaster and the secretary, which bring the scene vividly before the reader. At this meeting the "Admiral had sharp discourse about the merchants offering but twenty per cent, for exchange," and "threatened to be gone somewhere else with the forces." On the representation of the paymaster general the council voted to loan two thousand pounds, but Sewall was not content with this action. He thought the motion should come from the general, which was conceded, and on the motion of the secretary the transaction was reduced to writing. This account of the meeting winds up with a statement that the "vote called for was in the presence of the above mentioned gentlemen," from which it may be inferred that the council were perhaps influenced by their presence which may have operated as a pressure to produce favorable action. [141]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is difficult to conceive how the council could have loaned the two thousand pounds referred to by Sewall. Perhaps the vote was merely initiative and subject to confirmation by the representatives. At any rate this amount was certainly inadequate for the needs of the expedition and it appears from documents in the archives that the government was practically unable to do anything until the General Assembly should be in session. When the Court met the matter was arranged by a loan of bills of credit for two years to a number of Boston merchants who furnished the supplies, taking their pay in sterling bills of exchange, the rate of which was fixed at an advance of 40 per cent. The loan effected upon this occasion was in two instalments. The names of the subscribers to the first instalment of £40,000 are Plate 7 £2 bill, 1713 Plates; Parchment Tokens, 1722 enrolled upon the court records and on the twentieth of July the members of the committee who obtained the subscriptions were publicly thanked. On the twenty-first a resolution was passed authorizing a loan of £10,000 more, on the same terms, and it is in this second instalment that the rate of exchange is fixed at an advance of 40 per cent. [142]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This transaction not only furnishes us with a rate of exchange, but gives us the details of a subscription loan. The recording the names of the subscribers on the court records indicates that patriotic motives influenced them. The £50,000 loaned at this time should have been returned to the treasury in 1713. The ability of the merchants who had borrowed the bills, to meet the obligation thereby incurred, rested upon the manner in which the exchange drawn by them upon the home government should be met. Payment of the exchange thus drawn was not fully made for several years and the issue of 1711 was in consequence kept out for some time beyond the period when by their terms the loans matured.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notwithstanding the fact that this unusual quantity of bills was in circulation in 1714, there was an apparent stringency of the circulating medium which led to a controversy as to the best way of relieving it. Certain persons wished to organize a bank of issue which should lend its notes at interest upon real security, others wished the province to perform this function and receive the benefit of the interest on the loans. The details of this controversy between what were then termed the private and the public bank are voluminous and would require for their narration more space than can be given here. [143] It is enough for our purpose to say, that the policy prevailed of effecting relief for the supposed want of a circulating medium through the issue of £50,000 in public bills which were loaned to the inhabitants of the province on real security. It was stated in the preamble to the act through which this was accomplished, that the public bills of credit had long and happily supported the government in the long and expensive wars with the French and Indians; that they had served as a medium of commerce in the business of of the province and had greatly facilitated the payment for goods imported from Great Britain and other places, but they had now grown scarce and few of them were passing in proportion to the demand for the same, whereby payments of all sorts were hindered and business obstructed. It was to afford relief for these difficulties as well as to prevent the inconveniences that might arise through any private projections for providing some other medium of exchange, that the issue was to be made.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The superintendence of the lending of these bills was lodged in the hands of trustees who were to attempt a geographical distribution of the loans proportioned to the amounts contributed by the several towns to the public tax.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Some idea may be gained with regard to the effects produced by the steady depreciation of the bills through an examination of the remedial legislation proposed or actually passed during this period. As early as 1697, it was noticed that the precious metals were leaving the country and an act was passed to prevent the exportation of money or bullion. Another feature was the exodus of the copper money, to remedy which individuals intervened and stamped and emitted pieces of brass and tin at the rate of one penny each. This was forbidden by the General Court. [144] By 1706, the decline had become sufficiently pronounced to call for the appointment of a committee by the council to consider ways and means for supporting the credit of the public bills and methods for the payment of soldiers and others without the further use of certificates. The labors of this committee came to naught, the house not being willing to accept its conclusions, but the radical difference between the views of the two bodies on one of the recommendations is worth noting as a sign of the times. One of the troubles recognized by the council was the circulation of the debentures or certificates issued to soldiers and seamen, and this they wished to stop. The house not only refused to join them in this, but passed an order that a bill be brought in to make them pass as formerly. In 1718 an act for prohibiting the exportation of money and bullion was carried through to the point of engrossment, and in 1720, a bill was introduced for "prohibiting the selling and buying money at greater rates than they were set at and ascertained by an act of parliament." No conclusion was then reached but the bill was again brought up in 1721 when it failed of passage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The dependence of the community, upon the bills of credit as a medium for the settlement of debts had become so great by 1712 that it became necessary to clothe them with a quasi legal tender function. It was then enacted that a tender of payment in bills of credit should prevent the issue of an execution. It was evidently thought when the act was passed through which this was accomplished, that the situation was one for which there would be reliefin the near future, for this law was only temporary in its operation. When by its terms it expired, it was succeeded by another temporary enactment of the same nature, and this by another, and so by successive acts this quality was maintained until October, 1741. The cause for this act is directly attributed by one writer to the £50,000 loan of 1711. The effects of so large an issue were, he says, "that silver began to be hoarded by some, and exported by others in large quantities, and the bills became the only measure and instrument by which all private trade and dealings were regulated and managed." [145]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In 1720, the evil of the redundant circulation was recognized as one for which no one government was exclusively responsible and for which no remedy would be available which was not participated in by all the governments of the New England colonies. A committee was appointed which was composed of individuals from each of the New England governments, to whom the subject was referred for recommendations. They reported that there ought not to be any more loans; that no more bills ought to be issued each year than were sufficient to meet the charges of the governments and that these should be invariably called in according to the terms of the acts under which they were issued. These recommendations, as far as they went, were beneficial in their nature and if they had been squarely adopted would have greatly ameliorated the situation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The decline of the currency was, of course, in favor of the debtor class. In the first thirty years of the century the discount had reached about forty per cent. Traders were accustomed at that time to give long credits, and a variety of questions must have arisen between creditors and debtors as to the rate at which payments were to be applied when the latter were sluggish in meeting their obligations. Notwithstanding the attempt in 1712 to confer upon the bills the qualified legal tender function, it is obvious that the tradesmen resisted payments of old accounts in currency which was of less value when the payment was made than when the debt was contracted. In 1716, a proposition was made to the house which was doubtless intended to have some influence upon this question. A clause was attached to a report on one of the proposed bills for emitting currency, to the effect that a bill be drawn that all debts contracted after the publication of this act, should carry interest after one year from the time that they were contracted. The attempts of the tradesmen to protect themselves against loss on their long standing accounts through the continuous course of depreciation on the part of the bills raised a protest in 1718, against what was termed double payment and an attempt was then made on the part of the General Court to reduce the probability of controversies on this point by the passage of an "act for the regulation and limiting credit in trade and for preventing double payment of debts." For the space of five years from the passage of this act, the statute of limitations in so far as it applied to ordinary debts and book accounts was curtailed to two years. We may infer that this remedy was not favored by either debtors or creditors. The man who required credit was not likely to approve of any legislation the tendency of which was to restrain his capacity to run in debt. The tradesman who had been in the habit of carrying a load of open accounts with men who were slow in making payments must have found the curtailment of the life of debts and book accounts a serious interference with his business. It is not surprising, therefore, to find that at the expiration of the limit of the act, in 1723, the Boston merchants petitioned the court not to renew it. A new act was then passed which gave creditors three years more in which to collect their debts. When this act expired, matters reverted to the former custom under the statute of limitations. An attempt was made in 1727 to remedy the evil in another way. An act was then introduced "for the regulating, ascertaining and fixing the value of the bills of publick credit and for rendering the payment of debts more equitable and thereby to prevent any oppression or injury to debtors." Although this did not become a law, the measures therein proposed indicate that the community was still urgent for relief, through legislation, from the evils which the act of 1718 had failed to cure. In the preamble of the proposed law, it was stated that the bills of public credit were the only medium of exchange; that they ought to be of certain and unalterable value but experience had shown that since 1710 they had varied in value from time to time and that in a like manner similar changes might be expected in the future. In consequence of this, creditors had been and might be "prejudiced in their just dues", and debtors might be oppressed. As a remedy for these evils it was proposed to determine the rates at which silver had been valued, from year to year, beginning with the year 1710 and ending with Debts were to be made payable in bills of public credit and were to be estimated by means of the values fixed in this table, the date of the estimate being taken at the time of the maturity of the debt. [146]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While following to this point the various attempts at legislation for the adjustment of the differences between debtors and creditors which arose from the decline of the currency, we have necessarily passed the dates at which certain events should have been narrated, if it had been deemed important that they should be dealt with in exact chronological sequence. One of these, mention of which has already been made, was the introduction in the house, March 16, 1721, of a bill "for prohibiting the selling and buying of silver money at greater rates than they were set at and ascertained by an act of parliament." The parliamentary statute here referred to was the one which was passed for enforcing the proclamation by Queen Anne fixing the rates at which foreign coins should pass in the plantations. On the 15th of March, the governor had called the attention of the General Court to the depreciation of the bills of public credit and had urged some remedial action. The house replied to this part of the governor's speech on the 21st. They agreed with him that further emissions would depreciate the bills and they had, therefore, passed a bill prohibiting the buying, selling, bartering or exchanging silver at higher rates than those set in the act of parliament. "In our humble opinion," they added, "had such an act been made by the government at the first issuing out of the paper bills, they had to this day been in equal value and credit to silver." The bills were at a discount of over fifty per cent. when this statement was made and the futility of legislation of this character was so apparent to the council that when the bill came before them the next day, they unanimously non-concurred in its passage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">June 17, 1724, a joint committee was appointed to consider of some proper method for retrieving the value of the bills of credit. The report of this committee, which was submitted November 17, is entitled to special consideration. They recognized the true cause of their troubles and were willing to adopt measures which would certainly have helped the situation. The lessening of the number of the bills was, they said, the best way to increase their value. One way to accomplish this was to offer borrowers under the £100,000 emission ten per cent. premium for all payments that they would make on the portions of this loan then outstanding. This £100,000 had been distributed in 1716, to the counties to be loaned to citizens on mortgage security for the term of ten years. Some of the loans then made became permanent investments and as early as 1720, the probability that this was so was discovered. November 28 of that year, a resolution was introduced, in the preamble of which the following assertion is made "divers persons have mortgaged their estates and taken bills tinder the £100,000 loan and have neglected to pay interest and allowed their mortgages to be sued out and some have offered to resign their titles showing that the lands mortgaged were not worth double the value of the loans." Such was the state of affairs which the committee wished to remedy by offering this premium, the operation of which would not only have tended to wipe out some of these doubtful debts but would simultaneously have reduced the volume of the currency. They also insisted that the General Court should raise by taxation each year an amount equal at least to the charge of the preceding year. As a means of preventing the increase of the currency, they recommended that instead of issuing twenty thousand pounds in bills of credit, the like amount should be borrowed from those in circulation for which they proposed that the province should pay eight per cent. per annum. Notwithstanding the apparent absurdity of the province borrowing its own promises to pay, it is evident that heroic measures of this sort would have produced a beneficial effect. This very step had, indeed, been taken in 1692 and was thought by some to have had influence in maintaining the bills of that time at par. The committee concluded their report with a recommendation in which they seem to have lost their balance. It was to this effect "That some speedy care be taken to prevent the English half pence passing at two pence a piece as they now frequently do." This report was not adopted, but the last clause brings before us the "great inconvenience" alluded to by the council in June, 1722, which arose, they said, from the want of small money for change, the copper half pence having been sent out of the province. Ill-minded persons, they added, had presumed to split and tear the new small bills of the province to the great dishonor of the government.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The amounts of the annual issues were largely influenced by the military situation. Immediately after the peace of Ryswick and for a time after the peace of Utrecht, there was no cause for apprehension of French attacks on Boston and no opportunity to organize expeditions against Port Royal or Quebec. Quiet, however, did not always prevail in the colonies when the relations of Great Britain with France and Spain were of a peaceful character. The eastern Indians were restless and were easily incited to outrage. The necessity of occasional aggressive movements against them and the constant need of watchfulness involved the annual expenditure of large sums in excess of the ordinary needs of the government upon a peace footing. In the year 1723, twenty-three thousand pounds were issued; in 1724, fifty-five thousand pounds; in 1725, seventy thousand pounds; in 1726, twenty-five thousand pounds; in 1727, sixteen thousand pounds, and in 1728, in addition to the sixty thousand pounds which were then loaned to towns, forty-eight thousand pounds were issued to cover the various expenses to which the government had been put.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The extraordinary expenses which swelled the annual expenditures at this time were variously defined in the resolves as muster rolls of the eastern forces, expresses dispatched for the government, the charge of Castle William and other forts and garrisons, the expenses of transports, and the muster rolls of soldiers and sailors. The war with the French of which the expedition of Sir William Phips against Quebec was an incident, was terminated by the peace of Ryswick in 1697, which was followed by the submission of the eastern Indians in 1699. Hostilities were resumed with the eastern Indians in 1703. There were expeditions against Port Royal in 1708 and in 1710 and against Quebec in 1711. From 1719 to 1726 there was constant necessity for vigilance or active measures against the eastern Indians.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Beside the temporary loan of fifty thousand pounds incurred at the time of the Quebec expedition in 1711, loans amounting to two hundred and sixty thousand pounds [147] had been made, the most recent of which was the loan of sixty thousand pounds to towns in 1728. None of these loans was promptly settled. Some of them were made upon inadequate security and were never collected. It was feared, even before it was due, that the £100,000 loaned in 1716, would not be called in at maturity, and Shute called the attention of the Lords of Trade to the apprehensions that he had that proper steps would not be taken in May, 1727, for calling in the loans. An order was thereupon issued to Lieutenant-Governor Dummer to the effect that their Lordships expected that he would take care that these bills were called in and destroyed in May, 1727. Yet Douglass says that in 1739 some of these loans had not been sued out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It will be noticed that in the table which has been quoted from the abortive act of 1727, in which the rate of silver is given for a series of years, the person who drafted the proposed act dates the beginning of the decline of silver so far as it seriously affected the adjustments between debtors and creditors in 1710. The selection of this year may have been influenced by the great increase of the currency in 1711, caused by the loan in aid of the Quebec expedition. [148] Other causes may also have contributed. About that time the General Court failed to make provision for some of the recent issues in accordance with the promises made at the time of the emissions. The confidence in the bills based upon the belief that they would be called in according to the language of the resolves under which they were issued received a blow, which, undoubtedly, affected the circulating value of the currency.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In 1720, the practice began of inserting in the resolves in which new issues were authorized a clause permitting tax-payers to settle the taxes which were to be laid at future dates for calling in the bills, in various kinds of produce. Many resolves were passed which did not contain this clause, but for several years, the majority of them contained a list of twenty-three articles which could be used in payment of taxes. It by no means followed that when the corresponding taxes were levied this clause would be incorporated in the tax act, but in October, 1727, this was done. This practice was temporarily discontinued, but afterwards revived, although the articles of produce receivable in payment of taxes were then limited to hemp and flax. Subsequently other articles were also included in the list to which this privilege was attached. The alleged object of these proceedings was because "through the scarcity of bills of credit it may be more easy for some persons to pay their taxes in produce of the province than in bills of credit."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notwithstanding the obvious truth that a portion of the community were during the period of the decline of the public bills brought face to face with the fact that the purchasing power of their incomes was steadily diminishing, there are indications that there was in Boston at that time greater extravagance in the ways of life of many people and more display in the houses then constructed, than had theretofore been the custom. Note was taken of these facts by the controversialists of the period and arguments were deduced therefrom whose character differed according to the position assumed in the discussion. June 26, 1719, a bill was introduced in the council and carried through to engrossment, for the purpose of preventing and discouraging the growing extravagance of the province. In 1721, an act was passed to retrench the extraordinary expense at funerals. At a time when the circumstances of the province so loudly called for all sorts of frugality, it was stated that the charge or expense of funerals had become so extravagant, especially in the giving of scarves, that it worked a great detriment to the province and tended to impoverish many families. For three years to give away a scarf at a funeral was made the subject of a penalty. In 1724, the act was continued in force for five years longer. [149]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was the custom of the treasurers of the province to make a return of the bills outstanding at the end of May, in each year. Some of these returns have been preserved and from them we can ascertain the circulation of the bills at certain periods. Except for these returns we can only obtain approximate results. We can from the resolves authorizing the issues and the tax levies through which the funds were laid for calling in the bills, estimate the amount that should have been outstanding at any given date, but it is seldom that these estimates can be made to agree with such returns as we have at the hands of the treasurers. These were made by footing up the amounts which had passed out of the treasury, deducting therefrom the bills which had been destroyed as unfit for circulation, and adding thereto the five per cent. allowance and also all bills then in the hands of the treasurer. Apparently they do not include the loans, and it may also be noted that in some instances the treasurer makes a deduction for bills on hand. Throwing out of consideration shillings and pence we have returns showing £69,688 in circulation in 1709; £108,603 in 1711; £145,450 in 1712; £133,250 in 1713; £109,416 in 1717; £81,016 in 1718. From a report of the committee of the assembly we learn that in November, 1724, there were in actual circulation £191,530; this again would seem to require correction by adding the amount then outstanding,loaned to the inhabitants of the province. It is difficult to reconcile some of the above statements with the current legislation concerning emissions and retirements, although there are some points in which an estimate of the amount in circulation, based upon the legislation, does not vary much from the reports. The amount outstanding in 1730 was said to have been £164,755, 5s, 5d. [150]</field>

      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER VI. ENFORCEMENT OF THE ROYAL INSTRUCTIONS DURING BELCHER'S ADMINISTRATION.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We have followed the discussions concerning the currency which had arisen between the governors and representatives through the administrations of Shute and Burnet, and have noted the perplexing situation in which Lieutenant-Governor Dummer, the temporary successor of each of these governors, found himself when the responsibilities of the government were thrown upon his shoulders. The stormy and impetuous career of Burnet had resulted in blocking the wheels of public affairs and change of any sort was welcomed. While agreement was impossible, pending the arrival of a new governor, conspicuous collision was avoided, both under Dummer and under Tailer, the newly appointed lieutenant-governor, who assumed charge of affairs prior to the arrival of the successor of Burnet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The condition of affairs in Massachusetts was such that the gubernatorial commission was not at this period an object of much contest. Jonathan Belcher, a native of New England and a graduate of Harvard college easily succeeded in obtaining it, notwithstanding his previous record. He was trained in the ways of the court and could adapt himself to the passing political breeze. A man of wealth [151] and prominent among the conservatives, he had, while in London, astonished his friends by acting as agent of the house notwithstanding its state of chronic warfare against the governors. As an applicant for the gubernatorial office he claimed that his citizenship would be an advantage and that his familiarity with the ways of the General Court would aid him in protecting the interests of the crown. While agent, he had, with his associate, Wilkes, signed a letter in which the following language was used: "Of what value is the Charter if an instruction shall at pleasure take away every valuable part of it? If we must be compelled to fix a salary, doubtless, it must be better that it be done by the Supream Legislature than to do it ourselves ; if our liberties must be lost, much better that they be taken away, than we be in any manner accessory to our own Ruin." [152] Such language should naturally have brought him into disfavor, yet if it was known at court, it was overlooked and he was recognized as one who would sustain the royal prerogatives and who could be relied upon to enforce the royal instructions. His interest in local politics was shown by the fact that fourteen years before, he had contributed £500 to secure Shute's appointment as governor, which amount, according to Hutchinson was never repaid him. [153] Under the pretence that this expenditure had been made by him for the public good he had the audacity to petition the General Court for reimbursement, but met with a deserved refusal. [154]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Belcher arrived in the province in August, 1730, and found himself confronted with trouble from recent instructions. One of the last things that Burnet had Plate 8 6 s. 8 d. bill, New Tenor, February, 1736, 37. done had been to write August, 27, 1729, that the effect of the instructions was being evaded by issuing bills of credit, not, as he said, by a law which would require approval, "but only by a resolve, that so his Majesty might not have occasion to disallow it according to the express words of the charter." In October of the same year, Dummer wrote that he had signed a resolve authorizing the issue of bills of credit, which, following the custom since the time of Shute, contained a clause submitting the disbursements to the whole Court. He explained that the necessities of the treasury compelled this and added that he thought the charter needed some explanation on this point. [155] These communications apparently aroused the Privy Council and the Board of Trade to a comprehension of what was going on, and instructions were thereupon issued that "no money be raised or bills of credit issued in that our province of the Massachusetts Bay, but by act or acts of assembly in which act or acts one or more clauses of appropriation may be inserted." The approval of the accounts and the issuing of the money or bills of credit were to be left to the governor and council, subject to the future inquiry of the assembly, as to the application of the money. [156] These instructions were communicated to the assembly by Dummer, May 28, 1730.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the 9th of September, Belcher called attention to the fact that "exchange betwixt Great Britain and this province had risen in a few years from sixty to more than two hundred per cent", and on the 16th of December, he pronounced the bills of credit "a common delusion to mankind" and said they "must have an end according to the periods set by your laws, as you will see by his Majesty's 16th and 18th instructions to me." [157] The time was fast approaching when the last of the loans made to towns in 1721 must be paid. A committee of the representatives answering this message on the 1st of January, 1730-31, said in reply to the suggestion as to the retirement of the bills, that they were dependent upon these bills together with others then extant to serve as a medium in trade, and they added, "The committee can't but look upon it as the bounden duty of this court to revive that act."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Including loans and bills of credit which matured that year, there were then outstanding upwards of £270,000 according to the terms of the resolves and acts under which they had been issued, all of which, therefore, would have to be provided for in the successive years thereafter up to and including 1741, the latest year in which any of these bills were to be called in. Meantime, the government was permitted to issue annually for current expenses £30,000, the idea evidently being that such issues were to be called in by the tax levy of the next year. It was apparently thought, that after the outstanding issues had been called in £30,000 would serve as a circulating medium for the province, as it was further provided that after the retirement had been effected no more than £30,000 should be current at any one time. In his speech to the General Court, April 2, 1731, Belcher intimated that this instruction must be complied with. By the end of 1741, he said, all the bills of credit now outstanding must be paid into the public treasury. The £30,000 "in such paper bills" was totally inadequate for a circulating medium for the province and it is difficult to conceive how it could have been thought that in the absence of any silver or gold, business could be carried on with the value which this amount represented, even if it be supposed that it was rated at par. The representatives stated that they deemed it next to impossible that the necessary charges for the government should be defrayed with £30,000.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Important as this question was, it was overshadowed in the estimation of the representatives by the issue raised by Belcher's 30th instruction, which he communicated to them March 10, 1731. This was practically the same as the instruction which had been laid before the assembly by Dummer, May 28, 1730. Its presentation by a new governor meant that the disputed point of the control of the house over disbursements was to be decided through the agency of this instruction in behalf of the governor and council. The house did not yield without a struggle, but the governor told them that he proposed to carry out the instruction. "To give you the plainest understanding," be said, "I will inform you that for the future all accounts of service done for this province are to be brought directly to the governor and council, and to them only, for passing and paying." Appeals by the assembly in 1731 and again in 1732 were made to his Majesty in Privy Council for relief from this instruction. They were not decided until more than three years thereafter, when an order was passed in the Privy Council declaring "he king's displeasure at these repeated applications upon points which had been already maturely considered and determined by his Majesty in Council." [158] It was further ordered by the Privy Council that no alteration should be made in the 16th and 30th instructions. A memorial to the House of Commons had been forwarded at the same time as the address to his Majesty for presentation to the house in case the address should fail. It met with a rebuff from the Commons even more pronounced than that administered by the Privy Council. They asserted that the complaint was frivolous and groundless, that it was an high insult to his Majesty, tending to shake off the dependence of the said colony unto this kingdom, to which by law and right they are and ought to be subject.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For three years after Belcher's arrival there were but two issues of bills of credit for the general expenses of the government, one of £13,000 just after he assumed charge of affairs and one of £6,000 the next year. £13,900 were, however, issued from time to time during the same period to the governor as an allowance for his services and to the assembly for salaries.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is needless to go into detail as to the discussions which took place during the period when the government was left almost entirely without means for current expenses. A few examples will suffice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The governor having urged the representatives to make some provision for the government, pending a reply to their address to the crown, they replied that his Majesty was accustomed to take his own time in making such replies and that it was their duty not to commit themselves. Meantime they called upon the selectmen of the towns for instructions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The governor at one time informed the representatives that he was surprised that they should bring in a supply bill which did not conform to his instructions and added that they might rest assured he would not consent to that bill nor to any other of a similar nature. At another time he said to them: "I assure you I will not so much as enter into any argument with you whether I shall break his Majesty's royal orders in giving my assent to any other supply of the treasury than what his Majesty has directed to and such as is agreeable to the charter."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The representatives in their replies thought that the 30th instruction could be cured by legislation. If, however, the governor thought otherwise they conceived that there was no way to relieve the empty treasury except for his Majesty graciously to withdraw the instruction. Again, they voted that supplying the treasury according to this instruction necessarily tended to destroy the powers and privileges granted to the General Court by the royal charter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Various supply bills were proposed and discussions of this sort were carried on between the governor and the representatives, as to his power of approval, he taking refuge behind his instructions and they asserting what they claimed to be their rights under the charter. One alone among these supply bills requires special attention. It fell to the ground in the conflict then raging, but it contains in the fixed rate for silver therein suggested the germ of the new tenor bill. March 15, 1730-31, Jacob Wendell and others, merchants of Boston, petitioned the General Court, asking them to issue fifty thousand pounds in bills of a new form to be loaned to merchants and others, on real security at fifty per cent, of the valuation, to be repaid to the province treasury, one-fifth part each year for five years, at the rate of seventeen shillings per ounce of silver. If successful, more bills might then he issued. If not deemed advisable for the province to enter into the scheme, then the petitioners prayed for an incorporation so that they might carry on the affair in their private capacity. [159]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This petition was referred to a committee of both houses, of which Thomas Hutchinson, the father of the governor, was chairman, and on the 1st of June he submitted a report in behalf of this committee to the council. [160] The committee thought that the scheme would be of public benefit and, therefore, recommended the issue.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They fixed the rate of the bills proposed to be issued at sixteen shillings per ounce for silver and the bills themselves were to be redeemable at the end of five years in silver and gold. A bill was ordered to be prepared to this effect on the 10th of June and it is probably the one which was passed to be enacted in July, but to which the governor refused his assent July 20. [161] On receipt of information of this action on the governor's part, the representatives informed him that they had yielded all that they could without manifest prejudice to the rights of the people whom they represented and they, therefore, asked for a recess. The governor then consulted with the council as to whether he could, conformably with his instructions, assent to such a bill and also whether it was consistent with the safety of the province to permit the General Court to rise without some provision having been made for the support of the government. To both of these questions the council replied in the negative.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In submitting to the governor this and other supply bills, which by their terms infringed upon his instructions, it may be assumed that the assembly hoped that the governor would, as had happened before, find some loop-hole in the instructions which would permit him to approve the bills. Such is evidently the interpretation to be put upon their reply August 21, 1731, to a message, in which they say that "whatsoever mischiefs and inconveniences may happen to the province by the treasury's remaining empty may be attributed to the instructions as now understood and improved by his excellency" and by a vote of the council in February, 1731-32, wherein they earnestly desired the governor "to take such measures that he may be enabled to give his consent to the said bill as soon as may be." [162] Yet, even after it was evident that he did not intend to yield, the representatives refused to accede to the instructions, and in April, 1733, they said that by so doing they "would basely betray their trusts, recede from the sentiments given by their principals, act against their conscience and the light of reason," and in so doing "would give a wound incurable to our constitution." They also called the attention of the governor to the fact that when, as agent of the house, he represented them in England, he had not regarded their acts as disloyal and disrespectful. In June, 1733, the situation seemed hopeless, the governor rejected a supply bill with the assurance to the assembly that he should not give his assent to any bill projected in the manner of the one that he had under consideration and the house replied that they would not pass any bill which was framed upon any other method than that of the bill he had rejected.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The tone and character of this discussion has been adequately set forth in the foregoing and although in the end the house was obliged to yield, the gain was not entirely on the side of the crown, for in the meantime another contest had been waged in which the representatives prevailed. Belcher, by his instructions, was prevented from receiving compensation for his services in any other form than that of a fixed salary and this the representatives flatly refused to allow him. On this point, the crown was compelled to back down and give consent to his taking the annual appropriations, in the manner in which the assembly had been accustomed to make them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On receipt, in 1733, of the order of the Privy Council dismissing the appeals of the assembly, the situation was accepted and an act was passed in November in accordance with the methods prescribed by the instructions in which provision was made for the issue of £76,500 in bills of credit, for discharging public debts. In this act allowance was made for wages some of which dated back to the fall of 1730.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the same time that this act was passed the representatives entered a protest, asserting that they judged it more convenient to pass the present bill of supply and so suspend the exercise of their rights than further to insist upon them at the present time. They added that they left the exercise ofthese rights to be reassumed by any future assembly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notwithstanding the fact that the prolonged contest between the governor and the representatives had prevented the province from receiving the benefit of the annual issue of £30,000 and that the debts of the government had in the meantime been allowed to accumulate, the assent of Governor Belcher to this act was the occasion of a renewed instruction on the subject issued three years thereafter in which he was enjoined, "under pain of our highest displeasure and of being immediately recalled from that our government" to see that the original instruction was carried out in the future. His defence was that the emission upon the whole, considering the period that it covered did not exceed the instructions. [163]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Taxes had been laid from 1730 to 1733 which, taken in connection with the impost and excise and other sources of revenue, had been estimated to provide for the calling in of £90,500 bills of credit in accordance with the resolves under which they were emitted. All the revenues had been used for this purpose and the government during this period had been destitute of means for meeting the greater part of the current expenses. Much suffering had been the result.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While this condition of affairs existed in Massachusetts, a number of the citizens of New London, Connecticut, organized a company called the New London Society, united for trade and commerce. Their first attempt in this direction was made in 1729, when they petitioned the Connecticut assembly for a charter. It is evident that their desire was to organize a bank of issue, similar to those which had been projected in Massachusetts in 1686 and 1714. Their petition, which set forth their purpose to emit bills of credit, was denied, but they applied again for incorporation in 1732, this time alleging that the purposes of the proposed company were for promoting trade and commerce. A charter was granted and the company immediately proceeded to emit bills to subscribers to the scheme, taking mortgages on real estate as security. Governor Talcott soon heard of their proceedings and in February 1732-33, summoned a special session of the assembly at which the charter of the company was annulled and provision was made for winding up its affairs. [164]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">October 17, 1733, a joint committee of the assembly of Massachusetts Bay was appointed to consider what means could be taken to maintain the value of the public bills in view of the fact that a number of Boston merchants were about to emit £110,000 of their notes, and the neighboring colony of Rhode Island was also engaged in making large emissions of bills. On the 23rd the council instructed the secretary to write to the governor of Rhode Island for information as to these emissions. The joint committee reported November 6th, recommending that the governor should discourage the circulation of the Rhode Island bills and urging that some security should be furnished for the merchants' notes. They recommended that a bill be prepared to prohibit the circulation of the Rhode Island bills and to this the council agreed but the house thought it would be wiser to discourage their use. The governor declined to interfere. He thought a proclamation against the Rhode Island bills would encourage the merchants' notes, concerning the issue of which no scheme had been submitted to the General Court. Moreover, it was impossible for him to encourage their emission on account of the £30,000 limit set by his instructions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This resolution of combined disapproval and sympathy requires some explanation. The restraint set upon the issue of bills of public credit by the royal instructions did not apply to Rhode Island. This colony saw a chance to supply the wants of the Massachusetts people in the way of a medium for trade, and simultaneously to derive from issues of public bills made for this purpose an income which would pay the running expenses of her government. In 1731, £60,000 Rhode Island currency had been loaned, and in July 1733, an emission was made of £104,000, £100,000 of which was loaned at interest for a term of years. [165] As an offset to this last emission a number of Boston merchants entered into an agreement not to receive the Rhode Island bills in trade, and following the suggestion made in the petition of Jacob Wendell and others heretofore referred to, they organized a company and issued £110,000 of their own promissory notes based upon silver at 19s. per ounce, the notes being so phrased that while they bore upon their face a value stated in coin, the promise was to pay a corresponding weight of coined silver, sterling alloy, or the value in coined standard gold. Payment was to be made in three installments covering ten years. The notes rested for their security solely upon the solvency of the individuals whose names were attached thereto. These notes were known as merchants' notes and found a ready acceptance in trade but owing to the fixed rate of silver in which they were payable, they did not long remain in circulation. [166]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In 1734, an organization of merchants was effected in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, the purpose of which was to furnish the public with notes as a medium of trade. [167] The notes thus put forth were not like those of the Boston merchants, payable in silver at a fixed rate, but were to be redeemed in silver or gold at the rate which might prevail in 1746, when they would become due. They bore interest at one per cent. per annum. [168]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Although this experiment turned out to be a pronounced failure, yet in its inception it greatly alarmed the Boston merchants, who, under the lead of Andrew Faneuil and James Bowdoin, petitioned the General Court on the 15th of April, 1735, to give caution that the New Hampshire notes were a cheat and a delusion and they prayed that their circulation might be prevented. In prompt response to this a bill was passed April 18th, making it an offense to utter or offer to pay or put off or to receive or to take any of these notes, and the assembly requested the governor to issue a proclamation cautioning his Majesty's subjects against taking any of them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The attempt to prevent the invasion of the Rhode Island notes proved a failure. "Some of the Boston merchants, tempted by an opportunity of selling their English goods," says Hutchinson, "having broke through their engagements and received the Rhode Island bills, all the rest soon followed." [169] These various issues were followed by a sudden rise in silver.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The determination of the controversy as to the manner in which time bills of credit of the province should be issued did not prevent conflicts concerning the currency between the representatives and the governor. "There are several bills lying before me," said Belcher, July 5, 1736, "that have passed his Majesty's council and your house, for a supply of bills of credit to the public treasury, which exceed the sum limited in his Majesty's sixteenth royal instruction to me for which reason I cannot sign them, and I think proper to acquaint you therewith that you may conform the whole supply for the year to the said instruction."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Up to this time propositions which looked toward a resumption of a specie basis for time currency had received but scant consideration from the representatives, but it would seem that the career of the merchants' notes kindled hopes in the minds of the authorities of the government that the insertion of a clause in the public bills, making them in a similar way receivable at a fixed rate of silver, would have the effect of removing the discount. November 25, 1736, the governor recommended the emission of fifteen thousand pounds in bills that should "carry the value of money." This, he thought, would answer all the demands of the province. They would be worth more than fifty thousand pounds in the bills then in circulation, and might be emitted consistently with the restrictive orders given to him by his Majesty. This was certainly a strong argument in favor of the proposed scheme. If the public would accept these bills on a par with silver, the £30,000 limit would at once be expanded to the equivalent of over £100,000 in the public bills of the form then in use.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In January, 1736-37, the council approached the subject in very serious mood amid voted that "whereas his Majesty's good subjects have for many years been great sufferers by the uncertain and sinking state of the bills of public credit, which difficulty doubtless more particularly moved this Court in a very solemn manner to implore the divine guidance and blessing in the present session; wherefore to comply with this obligation and profession, it seems necessary that this Court shall do all that is possible to remedy this threatening mischief." As a result of this earnest appeal a joint committee was appointed, of which Thomas Hutchinson of the council was chairman, and this committee reported an act which was passed in February, 1736-37, which provided for the emission of eighteen thousand pounds in bills of credit of the present form [170] and tenor and nine thousand pounds in bills of credit of a new form.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was provided that the taxes to be assessed for calling in the bills of the new tenor could be paid either in bills of that tenor, or in bills of the old tenor in the proportion of three to one. If any of the bills should be outstanding in 1742, the treasurer was authorized to redeem them in coin at their expressed value. [171]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The passage of this act furnished opportunity for the opponents of the governor to attack him before the Board of Trade, of which he heard and in the following November he put in a vigorous defence. He claimed that the instructions did not indicate what sort of bills of credit were to be issued nor of what value they must be. There was no gold and no silver in the province and it was impossible for the government to get along without bills of credit. Bills of the form which had been in use had declined so much that £30,000 in them was hardly worth £20,000. He might, indeed, have said £10,000. The province was growing and the annual charges were increasing and if he should tell the people the government must be supported without letting them have wherewith to do it, he could really expect no other answer from the assembly but that he was an Egyptian task master asking them to make bricks without straw. The new bills, he said, had already lowered exchange with London 50 or 60 per cent. and he expected this advantage to increase till the time the bills should be paid off. [172]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The new tenor bills were received with great disfavor by a part of the community. The town of Boston, on the 10th of May, 1738, appointed a committee to draw up instructions for the representatives on certain points among which were the trade of the province and the paper currency. On the 17th the instructions drawn up by the committee were submitted. They call attention to the "neighboring governments, especially Rhode Island, who are daily rivalling us of our trade and medium in paper currency" and ask if their hands are to be tied, while Rhode Island can make what paper bills they please, which their necessities oblige the people of Boston to receive. They strongly enjoin the representatives not to consent to any supply for the treasury unless the funds for discharging the same be put on suitable years after 1741. They likewise enjoin them to use their power and influence to obtain an act for striking off as many bills of the old tenor as will re-exchange all the bills of the new tenor already exchanged for the old, and they submit a table showing the operation of calling in the bills by 1744 to show its impractibility. May 18th, 1739 these instructions were renewed. [173] In the winters of 1737-38 and 1738-39 attempts were made to resume specie payments by means of loans of public bills the value of which was to be stated in a fixed rate of silver, which bills were to be loaned to merchants, who should agree to pay their loans in silver. It was evidently in connection with the second of these attempts that in January, 1738-39, the council again appealed to the governor to consent to the emission of £60,000 in bills which they described as redeemable in silver and gold and which they said were on a different foundation from those which occasioned his Majesty's prohibition. The governor had on the previous day, the twelfth, announced that he could not consistently with his Majesty's instructions give his assent to the bill. In consequence of this the council craved leave to point out the great and distressing difficulties of his Majesty's good subjects of this province if the aforesaid bill or one of that nature should not take effect. The people relied upon public bills to pay their taxes and to Plate 9 Page from contemporary Acts and Laws. meet their engagements in trade and commerce. By the end of 1741, all outstanding bills must be retired. The amount now in circulation was computed at £250,000 0. T. and it would bring great distress, if not an entire stagnation of trade, if they should be entirely removed and nothing substituted in their place. Moreover the court had at that session found it necessary to discountenance the bills of the neighboring governments. [174] The governor, in his reply, said he would use his best endeavors to secure the royal approval of the £60,000 bill.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The term of Belcher's service was now rapidly drawing to a close. He had made enemies and among them were some who were unscrupulous and who intrigued against him in Great Britain. They were successful in securing his downfall, but when the means by which it was accomplished were understood, he was soon restored to royal favor and received compensation by appointment to another government. During the latter part of the time that he remained in this province he was engaged in a contest with the promoters of the land bank. The story of that experiment is of very great interest and has not received adequate treatment from historians. Its incorporation, however, in detail, at this point would swell the narrative to proportions utterly inconsistent with the limits which control a discussion of the currency. We must, at present, therefore, practically confine ourselves to a consideration of the influence which this remarkable experiment had upon the currency of the province, leaving the detailed account of the rise and fall of the company for treatment in that portion of the work devoted to the subject of banking.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The year 1740 was propitious for an experiment of this sort in Massachusetts. The withdrawal of all the currency emitted by the province was impending and no provision had been made for a medium of trade, other than the £30,000 permitted by the royal instructions for the annual expenses of the province. In this dilemma the representatives turned to the public, and in 1739 appointed a committee which was authorized to receive in the recess of the court any scheme or proposals from any persons, whomsoever, for the furnishing a further medium of trade in such way and manner as that the value thereof might be maintained. This furnished an opportunity for John Colman, who in 1720 had published a pamphlet in which he had brought out a proposition for a bank which should emit bills on real security. [175] He at once set to work and by December of that year had secured nearly four hundred subscribers to a scheme for emitting bills secured by real estate which was on the fifth of that month submitted to the General Court. The petitioners desired incorporation and the subject remained under consideration for some time, the representatives favoring the petitioners and the governor and council being opposed to them. The ultimate result was that the company began business in the fall without incorporation. The note which was then emitted by the company was signed by certain of the directors and was in the form of a promise in behalf of the signers and their partners to receive the same in all payments at the expressed value "lawful money six shillings and eight pence per ounce" and after twenty years to pay the same in the produce or manufactures enumerated in their scheme. The articles thus referred to in which the notes were to be paid were nearly all of them productions of the province. A limit of £150,000 was set to the amount of notes which could thus be emitted. The scheme found favor in the rural districts of the province. Many towns voted to take the notes, and subscribers to the number of about one thousand joined in the enterprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Certain Boston merchants who were opposed to the scheme organized an opposition company which was known as the silver bank or silver scheme, the purposes of which were: first, to emit bills which like the merchants' notes of 1733 should have the value expressed in silver at a given rate per ounce; second, to secure the mutual agreement of the subscribers to refuse to receive the bills of other governments not redeemable in gold or silver, except at a discount to be fixed by the company; and, third, not to receive the land bank notes on any terms. The notes emitted by this company were in the form of promissory notes, and were payable in 1755. While they bore upon the face a denominational value, the promise was to pay a specified weight of coined silver, sterling alloy, the denominational value being ascertained on the basis of twenty shillings for an ounce of silver. The company afterwards amended their scheme by agreeing to anticipate payment of these notes in the following manner:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In 1741, on the basis of silver at the rate of 28 s. 4 d. per oz. 1742 " " " 27 s. 9 d. " 1743 " " " 27 s. 2 d. "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">and so on with an annual reduction of seven pence in the rate of silver until it reached twenty shillings in 1755, when the notes were redeemable according to the terms expressed on the face. The proposed emission of this bank was £120,000 in their own notes. The silver rate at which it was agreed that these notes should be redeemed in 1741 was 28s. 4d. The annual change in rate in the scale of redemption was 7d. per ounce and this would make the rate at which the notes were probably emitted, 28s. 11d. per oz. On this basis the £150,000 emitted by the land bank was equivalent as a circulating medium to more than five times the £120,000 emitted by the silver bank, provided it were possible that the land bank bills should actually have found currency on the basis of 6s. 8d. per oz. for silver, according to the terms of the notes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The silver bank like the land bank had applied for incorporation and like the land bank had been obliged in order to accomplish its purposes to proceed in the emission of its notes as a private concern. The governor came to its aid as far as he could, and brought to bear unsuccessfully all the power of his official patronage with which to impede the progress of the land bank, but in the fall of 1740, both schemes were launched and both emitted their notes. The apparent success of the land bank gave birth in the spring of 1741 to a number of local imitators in different parts of the province, one of which located in Ipswich, actually proceeded to emit bills. The career of all of these, together with that of the land bank and the silver bank, was suppressed in the summer of 1741 by means of parliamentary intervention, brutal in its disregard of the rights of the colonists who were engaged in these unfortunate enterprises, and full of consequences in the hostility which it provoked, but effective through the support which it received from the governor and from the assembly, not ready as yet to contest the supremacy of parliament. [176]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So long as Belcher remained at the head of the government, his relations with these affairs continued unchanged, and his persistent activity in opposition to the land bank did not tend to diminish the feeling of hostility against him, which had been aroused in the minds of the members of the popular branch of the government by the prolonged contests about the currency.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It resulted, therefore, that the representatives preserved their aggressiveness in all their discussions with the governor, and as late as April 5, 1741, alluding especially to the insertion of a suspending clause in acts of the assembly, they said, if "the representatives should not struggle in every way to maintain and preserve their liberty they would act more like vassals of an arbitrary prince than like subjects of King George, their most gracious sovereign." [177]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Belcher was relieved of his official connection with the government in August, 1741. If his successor had assumed office a few weeks earlier, the name of Belcher would have been conspicuous in the list of governors who ruled during the days of the emission of bills of public credit, for its freedom from association with any of the great avalanches of bills which from time to time were forced into the circulation. He had faithfully adhered to his instructions, but in the summer of 1741, came orders to promote enlistments for an expedition under Admiral Vernon against the King of Spain's settlements in the West Indies. Bounties could not be offered; supplies could not be purchased; transports could not be secured, and garrisons for forts could not be maintained, except through the issue of a large quantity of bills of credit. In making the emission necessary for these purposes and for discharging certain debts of the province, the old form of bill was reverted to, and £80,000 old tenor were in July launched upon the market. The approval of the legislation through which this was accomplished was one of the last important acts in Belcher's official career.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[151] Belcher is described as follows in an elegiac poem called forth by the death of his wife: "To you, o Fav'rite Man, the Pow'r supream Gives wealth, and titles, and extent of fame Joys from beneath, and blessings from above; Thy Monarch's plaudit ; and thy people's love."

      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER VII. THE STRUGGLES DURING BELCHER'S TIME TO CHECK THE DEPRECIATION.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It has been already stated that the extraordinary increase in the circulating medium in the summer of 1733, caused by the simultaneous emission of the merchants' notes and the large amounts of public bills put forth by Rhode Island and this province, produced an immediate effect upon the rate of silver, which was so noticeable as to attract general attention. "Silver rose," says Hutchinson, "from 19s. to 27s. the oz., and exchange with all other countries rose also, and every creditor was defrauded of about one-third of his just dues. As soon as silver rose to 27s., the notes issued by the mer chants, payable at 19s., were hoarded up and no longer answered the purposes of money. Although the currency was lessened by taking away the notes, yet what remained never increased in value, silver continuing several years about the same rate, until it took another jump." [178]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The decline in the bills naturally compelled consideration. In May, 1734, the governor called attention to the low ebb to which the bills had fallen. They carry on their face these words, he said, "in value equal to money, and yet sixteen shillings in these bills will not at this day purchase four shillings lawful money." He exhorted the members of the assembly to adhere to the obligations which had been imposed upon them, and told them that "a sacred observance of the terms of the several acts by which the bills have been issued must have a natural tendency to support their credit."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The house apparently attributed the decline to the merchants' notes, and on the 4th of July, 1734, the representatives asserted that these notes had greatly affected the bills of public credit. They wished the assembly to take the matter under consideration, but the council prevented this by declining to co-operate with them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This experience of the sudden decline of public bills taught the sufferers a lesson in economics, which was announced by the governor in his speech on the 22nd of November, 1734. He said it was apparent to a mere observer, that every emission of bills had the effect of depreciating those in circulation in proportion to the amount emitted, and he called attention to the fact that the combined issues the previous year, of the government bills, private bills and bills of the neighboring colonies, had diminished the value of the bills of public credit at least twenty per cent. The effect of this, he said, reached the most careful and industrious, and widows, orphans, ministers of religion and public servants were affected by it. He referred to the merchants' notes as contributory to this result.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There are certain circumstances connected with the sudden rise of silver, coincident with the large emissions of bills of various sorts heretofore alluded to, which are peculiar and require some consideration. The issues of the province from the summer of 1730 to 1733, including the large issue of £76,500 then made, amounted to £113,200, but the retirements during the same period had reached the sum of £90,500, so that the circulating medium had only been increased by £22,700 in the bills of public credit of this province.

      <field name="fulltext">There can be no doubt that the merchants' notes were hoarded the instant that silver began to rise above the price at which they were rated. A very slight rise in the price of the metal, measured in public bills, would necessarily have operated to send them out of the market. When this rise had actually taken place and the bills had disappeared from circulation, the circulating medium had only been increased since 1730 by the £22,700 which had been added to the amount of the bills of this province during that period and whatever contributions to the currency had been made during the same time by the neighboring governments. Among these latter, however, was an emission of £60,000 for loans by Rhode Island, in 1731. The silent hoarding of the merchants' notes was not appreciated, and even after their withdrawal from circulation the discount of the public bills continued, and the notes were made the scape-goats of the situation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the May session in 1735, the governor said that he hoped the assembly would not rise till they had passed a law, in the most effectual manner to save this people from the oppression daily springing from "what are called merchants' notes." June third the representatives voted to insist upon a clause in a bill then pending, that in contracts where payment was provided for in merchants' notes, a tender of province bills, bills of the neighboring governments, or gold or silver, at the rates therein mentioned, should discharge the debt. On the fifth, they said that the emission of the merchants' notes was not justifiable and had been the means of raising the price of silver, and their further circulation would be oppressive to the inhabitants of the province. If bills of credit of this or of the neighboring governments were tendered in suits where payment was claimed in merchants' notes, they were of the opinion that such tender ought to stay execution. The society, they said, alluding by this term to the organization which had issued the notes, ought to be compelled to exchange note for note, beginning the first of November next, and until December first, after which the notes ought not to pass. The society would probably have been glad to retire its notes by December first on the terms suggested, as they were then at a premium of about thirty-three per cent. As special legislation was the order of the day, at that time, for the cure of every evil, no matter how temporary its nature might be, the assembly continued for a time to wrestle with this subject, but found that there were difficulties in the way of their accomplishing anything in that line. A bill was brought in, but after several amendments, failed of passage. The subject was under debate again in December, and again in January, 1735-36, and was finally shelved March 24, 1735-36. By this time it had probably become apparent that the notes were no longer in circulation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The report of the committee, June, 1731, [180] recommending the emission of bills which should be redeemable in five years in silver at 16s. an ounce, was followed, in 1732, by a movement which, if the people had been ready to apply heroic methods, might have resulted in placing the province on a specie basis with much less trouble than was actually experienced when this was finally accomplished. A proposition was submitted to the house in January of that year for a loan of £300,000 in bills of credit, borrowers to pay the same in twenty annual payments in silver at 8s. an ounce, so that the treasurer might, at the end of twenty years, be prepared to redeem outstanding bills in coin. The proposition was crude, the amount of bills being disproportionately large if the redemption was not to take place till the end of the twenty years, and the locking up of so great an amount of silver for so long a period would have been absolutely impracticable. It may be doubted, however, if these were the reasons which led the house abruptly to decline all consideration of the project.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In November, 1734, an act for retrieving and ascertaining the value of the currency was introduced, which provided for the emission of £60,000 in bills of a new form and tenor, payable in silver at the rate of 6s. 8d. per ounce. They were to be let out for ten years, and £110 was to be paid annually during this period by the borrower for each £1,000 borrowed. Twenty shillings of the present tenor were to be worth 6s. 8d. of the new, and the new bills were to be redeemable at the end of five years, one-half in coin, one-half in notes. [181] This act was defeated by the house. [182] It is of interest, not only because it contains the evidence of an effort in the direction of specie resumption, but also because of the name associated with its introduction.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We find in the records that in November, 1734, Thomas Hutchinson of the council, the father of Governor Hutchinson, as chairman of a committee of both houses, reported a bill for the emission of £60,000, which was defeated on the 26th of that month in the house. The details of the bill are not given in connection with Hutchinson's name, but it was doubtless the one which has just been described. In 1737, the same Thomas Hutchinson reported the act which contained the form of the bills of new tenor, which act was then promptly passed. Silver was then quoted at 27s. an ounce. The new bills were said to he equal to silver at 6s. 8d. per ounce, but were measured in old tenor at the rate of one to three. It is evident that one to four would have been a more just proportion, if it had been intended by the nominal rating of silver in the act to furnish an exact measure for the value at which the new bills should pass. Nevertheless the new form had a certain sort of success, which evidently stimulated the belief that through some such means as those suggested in 1734, a specie basis might be reached.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In pursuance of this idea, another scheme was submitted in January, 1737-38, for the emission of £60,000. This was a decided improvement upon the proposed act which was rejected by the house in 1734, but the similarity of the two acts will he apparent upon comparison of their general construction. The bills of the proposed emission were to he let out for ten years to such subscribers as would agree to pay to the treasury annually during that period, for each £1,000 furnished them in bills, £105 in silver or gold coin, silver being rated at 6s. 8d. per ounce. No bills were to be emitted unless £30,000 were subscribed. [183]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The proposed act was printed and distributed and subscriptions were solicited. At first glance this scheme seems preposterous. Silver was then rated at 27s., and it would not appear, when we consider this rate, to have been possible to float the new bills at par in silver. On this, of course, depended the success of the experiment. We must bear in mind, however, that the rating of silver was in old tenor, and that alongside these bills another form of bill circulated which was receivable in payment of government dues, one for three. If we convert the silver rate into new tenor, the undertaking has less of a herculean aspect. At all events, it is evident that there were hopes that the scheme might be put through. By June 6, 1738, £19,000 had been subscribed by merchants of good standing in Boston, [184] but that seemed to be the limit which could then be reached, and the subscription fell through. In January, 1738-39, the attempt was renewed, but on the 24th of April only £13,000 had been secured in subscriptions. [185] It is quite probable that the distrust occasioned by the further decline of the currency, was the cause of the falling off in the subscriptions when the attempt was renewed. This decline is to be traced to an emission by Rhode Island of £100,000 in 1738.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If we needed any evidence to connect the senior Thomas Hutchinson with these attempts to return to a specie basis, it is to be found in the fact that both his own and his son's names are among those of the subscribers on the above lists. [186] It was he who submitted the report of time committee appointed to secure subscriptions. Again, December 28, 1738, in behalf of a committee to whom the consideration of the difficulties attending the public credit in the province had been referred, he submitted another report, from which his opinions may be deduced. In addition to passing the bill then under consideration, which was practically the same as that which had failed in the spring, he thought that provision should be made at the same time for calling in all bills of credit, for which no tax had already been laid, according to the terms agreed upon in the respective acts under which they were issued. The circulation of any bills issued by the neighboring colonies since the first day of May, 1738, should be absolutely prohibited, unless such bills were redeemable in silver or gold, and founded upon adequate security.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This last suggestion made by Hutchinson was at once incorporated in a law in a modified form. The currency of any bills of neighboring governments already emitted after May 1st, 1738, or thereafter to be emitted, was prohibited unless it appeared upon the face of such bills that they "were made redeemable in lawful money upon good security," "within ten years after their first emission." The great quantity of bills issued without certain provision for their redemption, had, the assembly said in the preamble to this act, stripped them of all their money and brought the government into contempt. This province had fixed their value, but this the neighboring governments had failed to do, therefore they prohibited the circulation of their bills, except as before stated. [187]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">An attempt was then made to pass a bill providing that in the hands of inhabitants of Massachusetts, bills of the neighboring colonies should be a legal tender to residents of the respective colonies, for all debts or special contracts payable in Massachusetts bills. In January, 1738-39, this idea was formulated in the shape of an act which was duly passed, but it was shorn of some of its enormities before it got through. [188] The non-resident creditor was permitted to make affidavit if the consideration of the debt was either wholly or in part in Massachusetts bills and to the extent that he was able to prove that the debtor had received the bills of this province he was entitled to have his debt satisfied in them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notwithstanding the failure of the attempt to bring the currency to a specie basis through the proposed subscription loans heretofore described, the incident is full of interest and we may well believe that, had it not been for the Rhode Island issues, the patriotic spirit which led to such large subscriptions to the loans might have been stimulated to the point of success. The government had been both a borrower and a lender, and as far back as 1728 a subscription loan had been proposed. A brief review of these transactions will reveal the fact that while some of the loans were mere attempts to furnish a more permanent circulating medium than could be derived from public bills which were constantly drawn in by taxation, others of them, and especially the proposed subscription loans, rested their appeals for support upon the benefit that the province would derive from the action of the subscribers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The first instance that we find in this review is the action of the Boston capitalists in 1692, in advancing bills of public credit for the use of the government. In 1703, the province was a borrower, and again it borrowed its own notes from the people. In 1711, the province loaned its bills to the Boston merchants who agreed to stand in the gap and furnish supplies to the Hill and Walker expedition, taking pay for the same in sterling exchange drawn on the home government. This could only have been accomplished through an appeal to the patriotism of those who rallied to the support of the government. The loans of 1714, 1716, 1721 and 1728 were all of them evidently made for the purpose of avoiding what was deemed to be an impending stringency of the circulating medium, and of furnishing a currency which should not be subject to the annual withdrawals required for the funds. Concerning the Plate 10 Three specimens Fractional Currency; 6 d. Land Bank bill proposed subscription loans of 1728 and 1729, we have no such knowledge as will enable us to speak positively as to their import, but we can add to the suggestions previously made an analysis of certain events selected from the records which will, perhaps, aid us in solving their general character.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">October 13, 1727, a petition of certain Boston merchants was presented to the General Court in which they complained that trade was languishing; that trading by truck or barter was attended with great and insuperable difficulties and that the people called for a supply of money in order to purchase their daily bread. A committee was appointed to consider the matter and report at the next session. In February, 172728, a committee was appointed to receive and consider in the recess of the Court, any scheme or projection for retrieving the value of the bills of credit or for making suitable provision for a medium of trade and this committee was authorized to take subscriptions of any persons for the fulfilment of such scheme or schemes and make report thereon. [189] A bill was reported December 20, 1729, for the retrieving and ascertaining the value of the bills of credit of the province and a committee was appointed to take subscriptions from such gentlemen as were willing to subscribe as undertakers in the affair. It is probable that this was the progenitor of the plan already described in 1734, and which was attempted in 1738 and again in 1739.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In December, 1739, John Read of Boston submitted a plan for the gradual recovery of silver in trade. He proposed that a number of merchants and gentlemen should deposit in bank a fund of silver and should emit their bills for four times the amount of the silver deposit. The silver and the bills were then to be loaned at five per cent. per annum to borrowers who would agree to pay their interest in silver. The silver was to be valued at the then current rate and the bills were to be emitted on that basis. A portion of the bills were to be sunk each year, to cover the gradual conversion into silver. To provide for this, the bills furnished by the undertakers were to run for one, two, three and four years. Then so much of the fund as still remained in bills was to be renewed in a similar way for three years, then for two years, then for one year. Meantime the entire expenses of the affair were to be borne by the undertakers. The original fund of silver was twenty per cent, of the total amount of the silver and bills of the bank. If loans to the same amount at five per cent, were kept alive during ten years, and no charges of any sort against the bank, this twenty per cent. of silver would at the end of ten years have become seventy per cent. "At time end of ten years," says Read, "7/10ths. of this bank will be turned into money, and so money may be certainly and very gradually recovered and brought back into all our trade again," but the assembly did not see fit to bestow much thought on his plan. [190]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In March, 1739, Thomas Hutchinson, who afterwards became governor, submitted a plan for importing silver from England. He represented that bills for about £210,000 were then outstanding, £40,000 of which were on loan and £170,000 to be called in by 1742. If these bills were called in there would be nothing left for circulation. He, therefore, proposed that the government should borrow of some company or from private merchants in England 220,000 ounces of silver or the equivalent in gold, for the term of ten years, at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum for interest. [191] A fund should be established for the payment of this loan by a duty or excise on such commodities as was thought best. He submitted a calculation showing the charge to which the province would be put by such a scheme, and further proposed that a bill should be brought in to fix the rates at which silver and gold should be received in payment of past debts. He thought that the whole thing could be adjusted in ten years without disturbance to trade and that then justice which had been banished would be restored. "But this proposal," says Hutchinson, in his History, [192] "was rejected. "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We have seen elsewhere that in January 1738-39, the governor signified his willingness to secure if possible the approval of the Lords of Trade to an emission of £60,000. The proposed bill was submitted to certain London merchants for their criticisms, after which a report was made, a copy of which was forwarded to the province by Wilks, the agent, and was submitted to the assembly by Belcher, in October, 1739.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The bill which was described in the report as a proposed emission of £60,000 at the rate of 6s. 8d. in silver, redeemable one-half in five years, the remainder in ten years, will be recognized as the subscription loan, which was then attempted. The Lords of Trade reviewed the objections which had been made against it, included among which was one that the coin for the redemptions would be locked up for too long a time. They found the act unacceptable in the form in which it was submitted, still they would assent to a similar bill, provided none of the new bills of credit should be current until all those emitted prior to 1727, thus including the several loans, should be sunk. They further required that no more should be issued each year than in proportion to what should be paid off and sunk, of the old bills. They also said that all the redemptions provided for up to 1741 must be strictly complied with. The new bills could neither be paid nor received at a higher rate than 6s. 8d. per ounce of silver. They were to be redeemed at three periods, three, six and ten years, instead of five and ten years, and special contracts were not to be affected by them. By the time that the conclusions of the Board of Trade reached the house, this bill had been forgotten and the whole matter was ancient history. The house curtly disposed of the affair by saying that they could do nothing concerning the bill.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We get an official quotation of exchange in connection with the events of Belcher's administration. The rate on the bills drawn for the payment of the troops which accompanied the expedition against the King of Spain's dominion in the West Indies was fixed at 400 per cent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was in 1722 that the first issue of fractional currency was made. [193] Copper had followed the silver and gold and great inconveniences and difficulties had arisen through the want of small money for change. To remedy this five hundred pounds in pennies, two pences and three pences were issued. As it was expected that they would remain in circulation indefinitely, parchment was selected as the material upon which they should be printed. The pennies were round, the two-pence pieces square and the three-pences "sexaugular" They simply bore the distinguishing denomination, the title of the province and the date, no promise of redemption being printed upon the face of the token.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the course of time these must have disappeared and we find it alleged in the preamble of an act in 1737 that people were in the habit of tearing the bills of public credit into halves and quarters and passing them thus torn and defaced. [194] Of course, this was done in order to make change, but apparently advantage was taken by counterfeiters of this rough treatment of the currency and the act in question was passed to prevent such practices. A better remedy for the grievance than penal legislation was found in July of the same year, in the issue of fractional currency, in bills ranging from one penny to sixpence. [195]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This period continued to be characterized by an unusual amount of extravagance in the habits of the people, and this was commented upon by some of the writers of the day. While this phase of life may be accepted as a natural concomitant of an inflated currency, some contemporary writers thought that it was traceable to the use of shop notes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The activity of the pamphleteers was coincident with their opportunities. The situation in 1733 revived the hopes of those who wished to organize banks and a pamphlet was published that year in which the Rhode Island emissions were attacked and a project for a bank of issue was submitted. [196] Two pamphlets were published in 1736, one in which the merchants' notes were attacked [197] and one in which a proposition was advocated, somewhat similar to that suggested by the author of "A project for the emission of one hundred thousand pounds of province bills, etc.," in 1720, for a resumption of specie payments. [198] These were followed by a proposal for a land bank in 1737. [199] The scheme for emitting £60,000 to be loaned to subscribers, payments for the loans to be made in coin, which was under consideration in 1738, was attacked in a pamphlet published that year. [200] This publication induced Dr. Douglas to take a hand in the controversy and he published in reply to this attack, his "Essay concerning silver and paper currencies," [201] etc., etc. The year 1740 was characterized by great activity on the part of the controversialists, and was made conspicuous by the publication, in Boston, under that date, of Douglass's "Discourse concerning the currencies," the most valuable of the many publications in connection with the currency discussion. [202] We have under this date also the first of the many pamphlets devoted to sounding the praises of the land bank of 1740. [203] During the year 1741, the discussion was mainly confined to the land bank and incidentally its opponent the silver bank. [204] The closure of the land bank removed it from consideration by the controversialists, but one more pamphlet, this time political in its nature, was devoted to a narrative history of its rise, progress and consequences. This was published in 1744. [205]</field>

      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER VIII. THE INFLATION UNDER SHIRLEY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">William Shirley, who was appointed to succeed Belcher in the administration of the affairs of the province, assumed office on the 17th of August, 1741. He was a native of England and a member of the English bar. He was ambitious and his impatience at the probable tedium of his professional advancement at home, combined with his hopes of political preferment in the province, caused him to emigrate to Massachusetts. Cultivated, tactful and adroit, he made the best of the advantages which his education and his opportunities offered and during the ten years which he was in the colony prior to his appointment as governor, he conquered for himself a position of prominence in affairs. Whether his acquaintance with the subtleties of special pleading was of much worth to him in practice before a bench whose numbers were recruited from the community at large without regard to their knowledge of law, may perhaps be doubted, but it is reasonably certain that he had built up a good business in the province, and with its growth had gained considerable reputation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The perplexities of the situation to which he succeeded were inherent and chronic. There was absolutely no solution which suggested itself to the problem of where should the province turn for a circulating medium when the outstanding currency should be called in. The period was close at hand when by the terms of the royal instructions [206] this vexed question must be answered, and the only visible medium for the trade of the province would then be the bills of public credit which could be issued for annual expenses, the maximum amount of which to be in circulation at any one time after the outstanding bills should be retired, was to be £30,000. If the spirit of the law passed in January, 173839 restraining the circulation of bills of the neighboring governments should be adhered. to, no reliance could be placed upon those bills for a future currency. Of gold and silver, there was, according to a writer who visited New England about that time, [207] "a great deal" in the hands of the merchants, but, he adds, "they use it only as merchandise and buy and sell it only by weight, to send to England in return for goods."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was no reason to hope for relief through the use of notes of individuals, or of private banks. Special legislation had been carried through parliament to prevent the land and silver banks from carrying out their projects and knowledge in the province of this action on the part of parliament, cut off the possibility of new enterprises of this sort. It is true that .as yet the leaders of the land and silver schemes had not signified their willingness to accept the situation, but the day of grace, beyond which the extreme penalties of the act of parliament could not be restrained, was close at hand. One of Shirley's first efforts was to secure a peaceful compliance with the law. It is quite probable that in this respect he accomplished through his personal exertions what would have been impossible for Belcher. He was soon able to report that the directors of the land bank had "agreed to put an entire end to their scheme." As the silver bank had been organized solely as a check upon the land bank and as there was no disposition on the part of its managers to have any collision with the government, the submission of the directors of the land bank practically removed both of these schemes from further consideration as contributors to the inflated currency.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Two forms of public bills were then in circulation. Market values were measured in the currency which had been in use since 1702, known at that time as old tenor. In adopting the new tenor, Belcher had been prompted solely by the desire to get a greater purchasing value for the number of pounds named in the supply bill then under consideration. At no time during his administration was any effort made to bring all the currency upon the basis of the new tenor bills. Indeed many of the acts authorizing the emission of bills of the new form, also provided for the re-issue of old tenor bills. The first issue of the new bills was in February, 173637. It was provided that the tax to be levied for the purpose of calling them in should be laid in terms of the bills themselves, but could be paid in other designated ways, among which was, in bills of the old tenor in the proportion of three for one. No thought was then given to the question whether the two distinct forms of public bills, having the same denominations, but receivable by the government at different values would be treated in trade with the same discrimination as those imposed upon receivers of government dues. In July, £20,000 new tenor were emitted and in the act authorizing this issue an attempt was made to provide a remedy for this omission in the law. It was enacted that all public and private debts which could be paid and discharged in and by province bills of the old tenor, might and should be discharged by the province bills of the new tenor in proportion as one for three. [208] This provision did not in any way interfere with the operations of the "Act for the relief of and to prevent the oppression of debtors," [209] which was still in force, under the provisions of which any debtor who should tender satisfaction and payment of his debt in good and lawful bills of credit of this province was exempted from liability to his person or estate under execution. The natural effect of this was that old tenor bills remained practically a legal tender for an ordinary debt. To secure payment of any debt in new tenor currency, there must, therefore, have been a special contract.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Three things in connection with the currency, which were of especial importance, confronted Shirley when he assumed office: I. There was uncollected of the taxes laid for the redemption of the bills an amount which he sets at £322,407; [210] 2. There were outstanding bills for the calling in of which no taxes had been laid amounting to £105,525; 3. The "act for the relief of, and to prevent the oppression of debtors," would by its terms expire October 31, 1741. He distinctly charges the first delinquency upon his predecessors and especially mentions Belcher. "They neglected," he says, "to cause the treasurer to issue out executions, according to the law of the province, against the constables or other collectors of the taxes in the several towns, to compel `em to bring the taxes inwhich sort of postponing has been practised ever since the first emission of bills after the new charter in 1702, insomuch that a very great arrear of bills, outstanding for want of having executions issued out to bring `em in, has been successively handed down from one governor to another, to the time of my entering upon the government." This neglect he immediately took steps to remedy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With the large amount of taxes outstanding for which the officers in whose hands they had been placed had made no returns, and with no provision made for calling in so many of the bills in circulation, the province was clearly in no situation to profit by the qualified permission given in the royal instructions to issue £30,000 for annual expenses. Nevertheless the assembly proceded to mature a bill for furnishing the government with funds in the usual manner, namely, by a new emission. Inasmuch as this act did not meet with Shirley's approval it would not be entitled to notice in this connection, were it not for the fact that an attempt was made therein to introduce an entirely new form of currency. It was proposed to issue a bill which should be equal to sterling money. [211] This is apparently the only instance in which any effort was made to get rid of the New England currency. Five shillings and two pence in the new bills were to be equal to an ounce of silver. The bills were to be drawn in during the years 1744, 45, 46, through taxes payable in public bills, in silver or gold or in commodities. Should any of the bills remain outstanding after the last of these taxes were paid they were to be redeemed in commodities. In this last provision we can perhaps trace the influence of the land bank. The bill was passed October 7th, and met with Shirley's disapproval on the 14th, not, however, on the ground that it transgressed the royal instructions, but because of various objections that he had to certain features of the bill. [212]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After the rejection of this bill the assembly passed another supply bill in which they provided for the emission of £30,000 and this met with Shirley's approval. [213] In this act a provision was incorporated for calling in the outstanding £105,525 through taxes to be laid in 1742-43. The exigencies of the situation were such, that notwithstanding Shirley's failure to observe the royal instructions as to the time when these bills should be called in, the Privy Council gave a reluctant consent to the bill. [214] Simultaneously with the passage of the supply bill, Shirley secured the passage of an act which was described in its title as "an act to ascertain the value of money; and of the bills of public credit of this province granted this year for the supply of the treasury; and for securing the credit of said bills." [215] The discussion of this bill and an analysis of its effects will take place at a later period. For the present it is enough to refer for descriptive purposes to the title of the bill and to the following extract from a report made by Shirley to the Board of Trade, December 23, 1743: "I prevailed upon the assembly," he said, "to pass an act for securing to creditors the full value of their outstanding debts for the future, by making an allowance for the depreciation of the bills between the time of contracting the debt and the time of payment." [216]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">These two laws were in the opinion of Shirley, "of more service to the country than all the acts of assembly that had been made since the first emission of bills in the province." On the day of their enactment, January 15, 1741-42, he delivered a speech to the assembly in which he announced with an air of great satisfaction that his Majesty had been graciously pleased in the royal instructions for the conduct of the government to omit that portion whereby Governor Belcher had been restrained from giving assent to any act authorizing the emission of public bills of credit, without inserting a suspending clause to prevent its taking effect until his Majesty's pleasure concerning it should be known. [217] Successful in securing the legislation which he desired in the province, and in obtaining from the crown a modification of the royal instructions, he felt for a time that his star was in the ascendant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By the first of the acts of which Shirley had spoken with such complacency, thirty thousand pounds in bills of a new form were ordered to be emitted. [218]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bills of this form were thenceforth called new tenor, while those of the form adopted in 1737 were generally known thereafter as middle tenor bills but were sometimes spoken of as first new tenor bills. [219] To understand clearly the change in the form of the bill of public credit, it is necessary to recall the fact that under the act of 1737, while the declared value of the bills was the same as that which was set forth in those of the new form, their acceptance was compulsory only in certain payments to the treasurer, among which duties of impost, of tunnage and shipping, and income of the light house were not included. Bills of time new form, were, however, to be accepted in all payments and in the treasury. The act for the relief of debtors had by this time expired. The new bills had, therefore, a complete legal tender function.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Any debt of four shillings contracted prior to the passage of this act, specialties and express contracts in writing excepted, could be discharged by one shilling of the bills then emitted. The taxes to be laid for the purpose of calling in the bills were to be distributed over several years in the future, and notwithstanding Shirley's expressed aversion to the use of commodities for this purpose, it was enacted, that the inhabitants of the province could have the liberty to pay the sums to be assessed for this purpose in certain of the produce and manufactures of the province at prices to be fixed in a specified way, they to run the risk and pay the charges of transportation to the treasury.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The new bills of credit or coined silver at 6s. 8d. per ounce, or coined gold proportionately, could also be used to meet these taxes, but in this connection old tenor bills are not mentioned. This is, perhaps, to be accounted for by the fact already alluded to, that in this act provision was made for the levying of taxes equal in amount to the bills of that form, which were then outstanding without previous legislation looking towards their retirement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One other feature in this act deserves especial mention. An attempt was made to provide against the wilful negligence of future assemblies, by directing the treasurer to issue his warrants requiring the assessments to be made at the times provided by the act for the retirement of the bills. This form was followed in subsequent acts of emission.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notwithstanding the fact that the expressed values of the bills of the middle tenor and of those of the new form were the same in silver, 6s. 8d. in each being equal to an ounce of silver, they were rated at different values in old tenor bills in the acts under which they were emitted. The former were by the terms of these acts receivable for government dues at the rate of one to three of old tenor, while the latter were to be accepted in the proportion of one to four. That is to say, they were pronounced to be of equal value when measured in a medium of trade which had no circulation in the province, but when their value was estimated in the prevailing currency of the province the one was only worth three fourths of the other. This discrimination on the part of the government gave an effective value to the new bills thirty-three per cent. above the middle tenor bills. One pound in bills of the last issue was practically equal to one pound, six shillings and eight pence of the other. The incongruity of the situation seems to have caused some perplexity, to relieve which a resolution Plate 11 3 s. bill, 1742. or order was passed by the assembly, April 16, 1742, instructing government officers to receive the bills on the above basis. [220] While the legal tender quality of the new bill doubtless added something to its value still, if any reliance was to be placed upon the promises of the province, the middle tenor bill ought to have been the more valuable of the two. In every act authorizing the emission of these bills a provision was inserted to the effect that at any time after December 31, 1742, any person who should have any of them in his possession might bring them to the treasurer and receive in exchange for every six shillings and eight pence in bills one ounce of silver. The province therefore, was pledged to redeem these bills in silver within less than nine months from the date of this resolve. Nor could the assembly plead ignorance or forgetfulness on this point, for Shirley had called their attention to the fact in a message delivered on the 15th of January, 1741-42, only three months before the passage of the order. [221] Rhode Island bills, he said, emitted in 1740 and redeemable only at a distant period in the future passed current at the rate of one for four of old tenor, while the new tenor bill (he thus denominated the bill that just after that date became known as the middle tenor bill) was received only on the basis of one to three. The new tenor bill was redeemable in silver, he said, in less than one year and making due allowance for the future period of its redemption it was worth then at least 6s. 5d. in silver. If the distant period of time fixed for the retirement of the Rhode Island bill were taken into consideration its value then according to the custom of merchants in estimating such things was not more than 3s. 5d. Yet the Rhode Island bills circulated, he said, at the rate of 25 per cent. more than the new tenor bill. [222] Shirley's calculations were based upon the theory that the promises to redeem on the part of the governments meant something. The action of the assembly in April would seem to indicate that so far as the province of the Massachusetts Bay was concerned they did not agree with him. £46,000 in these bills had been printed. They had been issued and re-issued and many of them were still outstanding. Though some mistake made in the treasury there was some difficulty in identifying the specific bills entitled to redemption after December 31, but it was, nevertheless, clear that unless something should be done by the assembly, the province was in imminent peril of being obliged to discredit its own obligations. Notwithstanding this fact, no effort was made to get these bills out of the way, but on the contrary, their discredit was maintained by the government and no effort was put forth to prevent it until December 23, 1742. [223] On that date the council sent a message to the house, calling attention to the situation. They said, "it appears to this board that there is as yet no sufficient provision made for the treasurer's paying off the said new tenor bills which are outstanding, and may be in the hands of private persons, who will have a just and legal right to demand of the treasurer silver or gold for said bills." They thought it would "reflect much upon the justice of this government, if any demands of this nature should be made on the treasurer when he is not furnished to answer them." They, therefore, earnestly recommended the House to make a speedy and effectual provision for sinking and paying off the said bills. The house on the next day passed an order that bills of the first new tenor [224] otherwise called middle tenor should be received on an equality with bills of the last emission, but this did not satisfy the council and they non-concurred in the order. On the 24th of December, an order passed both houses authorizing the treasurer to exchange the bills at par. [225] On the passage of this last resolution Shirley sent a message to the house in which he said, "I am glad to have the opportunity of giving my consent to your late vote for setting the bills called first new tenor bills, at par with the bills of the late emission in the receipt of the province treasury." [226]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Shirley's interest in this matter was very great and at a later date in a report to the Board of Trade he said, "had I not watched to perfect the vote of the assembly passed for that purpose by instantly giving my assent to it, the assembly would have reconsidered and retracted it in less than twenty-four hours afterward." [227] The remedy was not perfect, but it was better than nothing. It was the only instance in which any allowance of the kind was made to holders of public bills.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The work of repairing the fortifications and generally preparing for defence from invasion in which the province had now for some time been engaged, involved the expenditure of considerable sums of money. It was absolutely impossible to carry out this work if the restraint imposed upon the province by the royal instruction as to the emission of currency, was to be maintained in its integrity. Shirley made representations to the Board of Trade on this point which resulted in a temporary removal of the restraining clause, or rather an expansion of the limit. On the 9th of September he announced this fact to the assembly, saying that seven or eight thousand pounds additional could be emitted for finishing the works and fortifications. [228]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the spring of 1744, war broke out between France and England. Formal declaration of war was made from the balcony of the state house in Boston on the 2nd of June. [229] Three weeks before this event hostilities had been inaugurated on this continent by the French at Canso. The existing Spanish war had been warning enough of impending danger to cause Shirley to make the efforts already put forth to place the province in a better posture for defence. However burdensome and dangerous to the welfare of the province were the emissions of currency which had been made for this purpose, the results caused by them were insignificant when compared with the effect of the flood of bills now about to be put forth for the equipment and support of the province troops in the contest in which they were about to engage with the French in Cape Breton and Canada. Up to this time, the restraint of the £30,000 limit imposed by the royal instructions had not been modified, with the exception of the permission for £8,000 additional, announced by Shirley in September. It was evident, however, that if the province was to be expected to wage war upon this continent in behalf of England, extraordinary expenditures must necessarily be made. Under the pressure of these circumstances the restrictions upon the issue of the currency were withdrawn and Shirley was allowed in cases of emergency to give his consent to such acts as might be necessary for the supply of the treasury with bills of credit during the continuance of the present war. [230]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In June, 1744, an act was passed in furtherance of the policy already inaugurated for supplying the treasury with funds for putting the province in a better posture of defence. [231] In this act a new form of bill was adopted which was familiarly known thereafter as the last tenor bill. [232]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The last previous form of bill had been declared to be equal to silver of sterling alloy, at 6s. 8d per ounce, Troy weight, so that a twenty shilling bill was to pass at the same rate as three ounces of silver. The bills of the present form were to be equal to silver at 7s. 6d. per ounce, so that the equivalent weight of silver for a twenty shilling bill was two ounces, thirteen pennyweight and eight grains. The function of the new bills was limited to payments in the treasury.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was provided that the payments could be made for the taxes which were to be laid for calling in these bills either in bills of credit of the form and tenor by this act emitted, or in bills of the last emission, or in bills of the middle tenor according to their several denominations, or in silver or gold. Old tenor bills were to be received on the basis of four to one of either of the above forms. Commodities were to be received for the same purpose at prices to be fixed by the assembly, the risk and charge of transportation to be borne by the taxpayer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The adoption of the new rate for silver does not mean that there had been a change in the market value of the metal. It is obviously a mere recognition of an existing depreciation of the bills of public credit, its purpose being probably to furnish a new starting point from which the courts could measure the same.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notwithstanding the clause in the bills of this issue to the effect that they were to be accepted in the treasury, their function in this regard was limited in the tax levy of that year to one fifth part of the province tax, liberty being given to each inhabitant of the province to pay his assessment, "one fifth part thereof, and no more, in bills of the last emission." About one fifth of the bills of this issue were to be retired in 1744, the remainder in the years 1745 and 1746. The purpose of the assembly may be assumed to have been to keep the four-fifths out. Whatever the motive which induced the assembly to place this restraint upon collectors of taxes with regard to the bills of this emission, they were soon overcome by the difficulties inherent in the attempt to carry out this limitation, and on the 19th of December, 1744, a resolution was passed authorizing collectors to receive them for taxes in common with other new tenor bills in 1746. [233]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">January 9, 1744-45, the treasurer was authorized to issue £10,000 of these bills. [234] The bills were to pass in all public payments equal to other new tenor bills emitted since 1740. They were to be called in by taxes of future dates, and payments of these taxes could be made in bills of credit of the form and tenor by this act emitted, or in other new tenor bills, or in bills of the middle tenor according to their several denominations, or in bills of old tenor, accounting four for one; in silver at 7s., 6d. per ounce; in gold proportionately; or in certain commodities. All subsequent emissions were made in bills of this form and on these terms.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the tax acts the nominal rate at which silver would be received was maintained at 6s. 8d. until 1747, when the new rate was for the first time incorporated in these acts. This was to be attributed to the fact that by that time the first of the bills issued at that rate were due for retirement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Acts authorizing emissions of public bills for the purpose of putting the province in a better posture for defence were passed June, 1744, and January, 1744-45. On the 9th of February, 1744-45, came the first of the various issues made to meet the expenses of the Louisburg expedition. From June, 1744, to March, 1746, inclusive, a little over £346,000 of public bills of the last form were issued, or if converted into old tenor, over £1,384,000. Then came the Canada expedition.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The ambition of Shirley had embarked the province upon a military career. Success had crowned an expedition undertaken under circumstances which seemed to preclude the possibility of such a result. Louisburg had fallen, and now the French must be driven off the continent. The mad career of the province in the reckless issues of public bills will be better appreciated if submitted to inspection in tabular form:</field>

      <field name="fulltext">These issues were all of them in bills of the last form. They represented in old tenor £2,793,750, and after allowing for all retirements provided for by law there were outstanding in the spring of 1749, about £2,l00,000 old tenor. Under authority conferred by the act for drawing in the bills of credit, passed in January, 174849, the treasurer of the province issued his warrants, in the summer of that year, to the tax collectors for £75,000 in bills of the last form, or £300,000 old tenor, thus reducing the amount which ought to have been outstanding to about £1,800,000 old tenor. With silver rated by statute at 7s. 6d. an ounce in bills of the last form and old tenor four to one, these being the ratings given in the act of emission passed in 1744, when the last form of bill was for the first time issued, we have the. price of 30s., old tenor, an ounce for silver, acknowledged in 1744. From this point the rate rose rapidly with the repeated issues of public bills until 60s. an ounce was reached. No variation, however, was made in the form of the bill. 7s. 6d. in bills were still said to be equal to one ounce of silver, and four shillings old tenor were still to be received for one shilling of the last form. Practically old tenor currency was the medium through which values were measured during this period. As the discrepancy increased between the rate at which bills of the last form were nominally issued and their actual value in the market, there was no other way to state the value of exchange or silver than in terms of old tenor currency. So violent were the fluctuations of sterling exchange, or, perhaps it would be more accurate to say so eccentric were the various rates of speed at which it rose, that Hutchinson, who states that the lowest point of depreciation reached was eleven for one, adds in the same paragraph, that perhaps "the difference was really twelve to one." The variation of a fraction of one per cent. will to-day determine the direction of the movement of gold across the Atlantic, but whether the limit that exchange then reached was 1200 or 1100 Hutchinson, a careful contemporaneous observer, could not say. In London, exchange was vaguely spoken of at that time as having risen to more than one thousand per cent. [235] It is obvious that under such conditions it was impossible to speak definitely upon this point, and it is difficult to conceive how the market rate could have been ascertained</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This condition of affairs had been brought about through the military ambition of Shirley. The emission of a few public bills of credit was as Hutchinson said, "an easy way of paying public charges." This lesson the council of war at Louisbnrg had learned and they proceeded to apply it in providing means of their own devising to meet their emergent expenses.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the 15th of July, 1745, at a meeting of the council held at the citadel in the city of Louisburg, at which the Honorable William Pepperell, President, and the Honorable Commodore Warren were present, the following vote was passed:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Advized, that notes or bills under the hands and seals of Gen l Pepperrell and Com re Warren be made to the value of ten thousand pounds, New England currency of the old tenor, to pay off the workmen employed on the repairs till money can be had here to exchange them.

[236]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Concerning the emission of these bills we know nothing, except what is contained in the foregoing order. Their influence upon the situation was not felt in the province. The fact that such bills were emitted is a curious commentary on the times, but is otherwise of little consequence.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER IX. ATTEMPTS AT ADJUSTMENT OF DEBTS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Before resuming the chronological narrative of the currency question, it is important that we should devote a short time to the consideration of the adjustment of debts, a subject which had been full of perplexities from the beginning of the issue of paper money, but which during the inflation under Shirley became practically incapable of any just solution.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We have seen that in 1742, Shirley took great pride in the passage of two laws, in the shaping of both of which he believed that his influence had been paramount. The first of these, the supply bill, has already been considered. The second, the act for ascertaining the value of money, belongs to a class of legislation, which requires for its clear comprehension, that it should be examined independently from the question of emissions. The various struggles that took place in Shirley's time in connection with the interpretation and enforcement of this act, are so confusing in their details, and yet at the same time so important in their bearing upon events, that even if the general subject were not entitled to separate consideration, the narration of the facts associated with this attempt to protect creditors would compel independent investigation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For nearly thirty years the act for the relief of, and to prevent the oppression of debtors, originally passed in 1712, had by various extensions been maintained as the law of the land. Practically, as has already been said, it made old tenor bills a legal tender. Shirley was thoroughly opposed to the principle embodied in this law, which by the terms of the last extension was, when he assumed office, about to expire. He charged that through the instrumentality of this act injustice had been done to creditors in the past, particularly to British merchants, who had through the depreciation of the bills continually suffered large discounts in the adjustment of their accounts. He included also among the sufferers, widows and orphans residing in the province, whose estates were injured in a similar way. He gave figures showing the advance, during certain periods, in the rate of exchange between bills of credit and sterling money, and pointed out the injustice of compelling creditors to accept the depreciated bills in settlement of their debts. With a certain amount of confusion in his attempts to express the discount, he asserted that it "was the same thing as if the government had passed a law in each of those years that creditors in trade should be obliged to accept twenty, a hundred and ten, and a hundred and sixty per cent. less than the real value of their debts." [237]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So long as Shirley entertained these views it was impossible to secure by legislation any further extension of this act. There were, however, several abortive efforts made, in one direction and another, to secure a settlement of the question underlying the act, before a final agreement was reached between the house, the council, and the governor. Two days after Shirley delivered his inaugural address, and probably before his views were thoroughly appreciated, a committee was appointed by the assembly to consider what should be done in view of the fact that the act for the relief of debtors was about to expire, and in the same month an act for ascertaining the value of paper currency within this province and fixing a medium to supply the place of it, was matured in the council, but unanimously rejected by the house. In a supply bill which was enacted by the assembly but rejected by the governor in October, 1741, a complicated scheme was incorporated for the adjustment of outstanding debts. They were to be classified in three divisions: I. Those contracted prior to October 31, 1729; II. Those contracted between that date and October 31, 1735 ; III. Those contracted subsequent to the last date. The act contained a provision for the emission of a new note on a sterling basis, and in the scale for the adjustment of debts this note was recognized, but taking old tenor bills as the measure, debts of the first class were to be settled in these bills, on the theory that silver was then worth 20 s . an ounce. For the second class, the bills were rated in a similar way as equal to silver at 24 s . an ounce, and for the third the rate was fixed at 28 s . 6 d . an ounce.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We are indebted to this act for a lengthy message of disapproval from Shirley, in which, after mentioning his objection to the bills proposed to be issued, both on account of their form and that they were made a legal tender for debts, he argued that the payment of taxes in commodities laid the province open to prejudicial combinations on the part of those who could control their prices, and then went on to review the situation in detail, and point out the progress of the depreciation of the bills of public credit. He disapproved of the scale proposed for the adjustment of debts, and stated that between 1712 and 1730, exchange had risen from 50 per cent. premium to 250 per cent., and now it was 450 per cent. He also disapproved of the combination of the equitable part of the bill with a supply bill. It will be seen that the basis for the adjustment of debts contracted after 1735, in the proposed bill, corresponded closely with what Shirley says the premium was. The message was an able document and doubtless had weight with the assembly, [238] for they did not in this case, as they had frequently done with other governors, grimly assert that they had done the best that they knew how to furnish a supply to the government, and put forth the claim that it was not their fault if there were no funds, but in due course of time, they matured a bill in consonance with Shirley's views. They also detached the subject of the adjustment of debts from the supply bill and enacted in January, 1741-42, the second of those bills which Shirley thought of so much value to the province.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The act for ascertaining the value of money, etc., provided that all coined silver of sterling alloy should pass at the rate of 6 s . 8 d . per ounce, Troy weight. All private trade and dealings where no other lawful money or thing was expressly contracted for, were to be considered as intended to be in and for the money aforesaid. That is to say, silver coin at 6 s . 8 d . per ounce was to be the basis of private contracts unless something else was specified.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The effect of the foregoing was, however, modified by subsequent sections which provided that the province bills emitted for the supply of the treasury that year should be taken on the basis of the above rate of silver. For five years from the last day of March, 1742, all debts where no special method of payment was provided, were to be deemed to be upon a silver basis. A debt of six shillings and eight pence could be paid with an ounce of silver, or with six shillings and eight pence in the bills emitted that year, or in so much of the province bills thereafter to be emitted as would purchase an ounce of silver. Special provision was made for the depreciation of the bills. In case they should pass at a lower rate than that set by the act, an allowance was to be made to the creditor, and the depreciation was to be estimated once in six months by the General Assembly or if they should fail to do so, then by a committee composed of the eldest councillors from the several counties, and if they also should fail in their duty, then the superior court of judicature was to appoint a jury for the purpose. The price of silver and the cost of bills of exchange were to be the means of determining the depreciation. Grants made by the assembly payable in sterling money, which were to be settled out of the money which should be raised under the supply act of this year, were to be paid at the rate of 5 s . 2 d . sterling for 6 s . 8 d . of the bills emitted. It will be seen that if the normal rate of exchange was 133, this conversion was based upon silver at 6 s . 10 d . per ounce.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hutchinson [239] thus describes this act "This was a scheme to establish an ideal measure in all trade and dealings, let the instrument be what it would. The act which passed the court declared that all contracts should be understood payable in silver at 6 s . 8 d . the ounce, or gold in proportion. Bills of a new form were issued, 20 s . of which expressed in the face of the bill three ounces of silver, and they were to be received accordingly in all public and private payments, with this saving, that, if they should depreciate in their value, an addition should be made to all debts as much as the depreciation Plate 12 3 d. bill, 1744; 2 d. bill, 1744 from the time of the contract to the time of payment. How to ascertain the depreciation from time to time was the great difficulty in framing the act. To leave it to a common jury would never do. There was some doubt whether a house of representatives would be wholly unbiased. At length it was agreed that the eldest counsellor in each county should meet once a year and ascertain the depreciation." Later, speaking of the operation of the law, he says, [240] that "the counsellors appointed to estimate the depreciation never had firmness enough in any instance to make the full allowance, but when silver had rose 20 per cent, or more, an addition was made of four or five only. The popular cry wasagainst it, andone year when Nathaniel Hubbard, Esquire, the eldest counsellor for the county of Bristol, a gentleman of amiable character, and who filled the several posts he sustained with applause, endeavored to approach nearer to a just allowance than had been made in former years, he felt the resentment of the house, who left him out of the council next election. In short, the act neither prevented the depreciation of the bills, nor afforded relief in case of it, and was of no other service than to serve as a warning, when an act was passed for establishing a fixed currency a few years after, to leave nothing to be done by any person or bodies of men, or even future legislatures, to give the act its designed effect, but in the act itself to make full provision for its execution in every part."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The act for the relief of debtors had expired October 31, 1741. The section in the new act defining the method in which the new bills might be used in the adjustment of debts did not go into effect until April 1st, 1742. In the supply bill passed July 1, 1742, this gap was covered by a provision that debts contracted prior to October 31, 1741, payable in old tenor, and also any debt contracted in. the interval between that time and April 1, 1742, where the parties had not expressly agreed otherwise, could be discharged by the new bills in the proportion of one to four, old tenor. This provision as to the reception of the bills in payment of debts was reenacted in the supply bills of January, 1742-43, and November, 1743. [241]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The act for ascertaining the value of money seems to have made the debtor class of the community restless, and their efforts for relief began to crop out in various schemes for legislative interference. In December, 1742, an "act to enable debtors to discharge all specialties and express contracts in writing, with province bills according to equity and good conscience", was put through the preliminary stages, but finally failed of passage. [242] In April, 1743, an "act for the equitable payment of bonds and debts contracted before the last day of October, 1741", was bandied about between the board and the house, [243] it being evident from the record that there was a wide difference of opinion between the two bodies as to the character of legislation required in this direction. On the 19th of April, the bill being then in possession of the council at the stage of engrossment, the house sent up to the board asking that it be sent down to them. On the receipt of the bill, they passed a resolve, in the preamble of which they called attention to the fact that under the direction of the superior court of judicature, a committee had established the value of an ounce of silver in bills of the last form at 7 s . 2 d . It did not appear it was said that there had been any such depreciation of the bills of public credit. [244] It was, therefore, unanimously resolved by the house that all debts contracted between March 31, 1742 and March 31, 1743, specialties and contracts excepted, should be deemed and adjudged equal to the real value only that such bills passed at when such debts were or should be contracted. If the bills should depreciate then an allowance should be made. This was sent up to the Board, but met with a unanimous non-concurrence. The council then voted that a committee should be ordered to prepare the draft of a bill for explaining such clauses of any of the acts of this province then in force as related to the payment of debts contracted prior to October 31, 1741, in bills of this province. In this action the house concurred, and as a result of the discussions which then took place an act in explanation of sundry acts of this province relating to the payment of private debts contracted before the 31st day of October, 1741, was agreed upon, and on its final passage on the 21st of April, just before the close of the session, this bill appears from language used by Shirley to have received the unanimous approval of the assembly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notwithstanding this fact, Shirley stated that the matter was too important for him to give his approval without making some investigation of the subject. He would announce the result of his examination at the next session. This he did on the 27th of May, immediately after the opening of the General Court at the May session. He had in the meantime made a thorough research into the practice of the courts in entering up judgments, and the message, in which he set forth the results of his investigation, though perhaps unnecessarily verbose and more in the nature of an attorney's brief than a state document, was, nevertheless, a paper of considerable merit, containing much information of value. He intimated that it was impossible to explain away the obvious meaning of a statute by a palpable misconstruction, and while he felt constrained to withhold his consent from the act as passed, he pointed out certain features which met his approval. [245]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the 8th of June, a resolution was passed by the assembly and approved by the governor, which seems to have been based upon the facts set forth in the governor's speech, in which it was asserted that from 1712 to 1742, it had been the uninterrupted practice of the courts in chancering penalties upon all bonds and mortgages, the conditions of which were the payment of bills of credit or lawful money, [246] to make up judgments for the nominal sum expressed in the conditions of such bonds with the addition of interest due thereon ; and the executions awarded on said judgments had been levied by the sheriffs for the value of the nominal sum, in bills of credit of the old tenor. After the passage of the supply bills of July, 1742, and January, 1742-43, some of the judges, in making up judgments on bonds and mortgages, made allowances for depreciation from the time the debts were contracted. It was, therefore, resolved by the General Court that this course if pursued would be attended with manifest injustice and oppression. The courts were consequently empowered to reconsider such judgments and were recommended to return in the future to their former practice in such cases. [247]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the 27th of May, 1743, Shirley said to the assembly, "I think the General Court in 1736 gave the creditors an expectation that the outstanding bills of the old tenor should be exchanged at the treasury in 1742 for silver at the rate of one ounce for every twenty shillings in bills." In discussing the question of who was entitled to relief, he drew a distinction between hoarders of bills and ordinary creditors. Again, on the 10th of June, 1743, he adverted to this subject in a general review of the currency question and of the effect of the depreciation upon debtors and creditors. He approved of the action taken in chancering bonds and mortgages, but thought the province should make good the loss to creditors. He called attention to the various clauses in the acts authorizing the emission of bills, under which liability on the part of the province to maintain the bills at certain standards might be implied. The acts of 1736-37-38 he said made twenty shillings old tenor equal to one ounce of silver, but in 1741, the assembly had reduced this value one-quarter. [248] He thought creditors entitled to some protection against such legislation. He admitted that at the very time that some of these acts fixed the value of silver in old tenor bills at 20 s . an ounce it was actually worth 27 s ., but he thought by some means an equitable adjustment could and ought to be made. [249]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the quotation from Hutchinson, relative to the operation of the act for ascertaining the value of money, we have seen that he attributed to the committee of councillors, unwillingness to recognize the actual extent of the depreciation when they were called upon to determine the rate, and that there was doubt whether the house of representatives would have been unbiased. The resolution already referred to, passed by the assembly, April 19th, was embodied in an act in June of that year. [250] An examination of this act will forcibly recall this suggestion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the preamble, the facts set forth in the house resolution were repeated. It was asserted that the judges of the superior court, in pursuance of the law, had made inquiry as to the depreciation, by a committee appointed for the purpose, that this committee had lodged a certificate in the secretary's office to the effect that seven shillings and two pence of bills of the last form and tenor were equal to one ounce of silver, whereby an addition of six pence was made upon every debt of six shillings and eight pence. No such depreciation, it was said, had taken place. The bills were of as much value for the purchase of exchange when the certificate was filed as they ever had been. The trouble lay with the debtor who had not strictly followed the law. Every debt of six shillings and eight pence was declared by the law to be equal to one ounce of silver, and the debtor ought to have regarded his debt as payable in lawful money. Public bills, being as a matter of fact, the only medium of common trade, there would be continual danger of the computation of debts according to the depreciated value of the bills, whilst the real measure was deemed by law to be lawful money.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was, therefore, enacted that debts contracted since March 31st, 1742, or that should be contracted after the date of the act, were to be deemed equal to the value at which the bills passed when the debts were contracted. Depreciation which took place between the time of contract and time of payment was to be allowed by the courts, so that the payment should be equal in value to the debt when contracted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Perhaps this abstract of the act and its preamble may not seem clear, but the preamble can be interpreted in such a way as to render the law intelligible. It will be observed that the discount of the bills is not denied. The assertion is that it did not take place within the period covered by the certificate. If the statement had been made that the rate of silver March 31, 1742, was 7 s . 2 d . per ounce in these bills, then it would have been clear that under the clause in the law covering the question of depreciation debtors ought not to pay sixpence additional on each 6 s . 8 d . of their debts. In effect, the assembly says in this preamble, that there has been no discount, because the bills are available for just as much in the purchase of exchange as they ever were, and they then go on to say, the debtor must remember that an ordinary debt is measured by the silver which the bills would have purchased when the debt was contracted, and it must be settled by the payment of enough bills to procure the same amount, no matter what the depreciation may be.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It will be remembered that the act of emission fixed the value of the bill by saying that 6 s ., 8 d . in the bills were equal to an ounce of silver, and this must have determined the courts in fixing the amount of depreciation, whereas, if what the assembly allege in this preamble is true, then the bills must have fallen to the lower rate at once. For proof that this conjecture is true we may refer to a message of Shirley's to the house on the 30th of May, 1743. He was discussing the values set upon the bills by a committee of the superior court of judicature at the February term in Suffolk county; £137, l0s. in bills was said to have been equal on the 28th of February to £100 sterling, and 7 s ., 2 d . was then equal to an ounce of silver. [251] He added that the bills were of no greater value than this at the time of the passage of the act, notwithstanding the fact that they were rated therein at 6 s ., 8 d . They were, therefore, rated in the act at 7 1/2 per cent, above their current market value. It was the intention, he said, that the depreciation should be estimated from the current value of the bill and not from the rate stated in the act. [252]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Under the act which we are now considering the duty was thrown upon the courts of making the allowance for depreciation. The method of doing this was not necessarily changed. The act was in addition to and explanation of the former act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From what has already been said it will be apparent that an agreement between the two houses as to how the depreciation should be determined had not been reached without a struggle. The journals of the two bodies furnish us with still further details of this contest, an examination of which may, perhaps, be worthy of our attention. On the 16th of February, 1743-44, the house resolved that whereas it was near six months since the value of public bills in silver or bills of exchange had been fixed under the provisions of the act for ascertaining the value of money, a committee ought to be appointed to consider the rate at which province bills then commonly passed, in proportion to bills of exchange or silver and lay before the court the evidence which governed their conclusion. Under the law as it then stood, the performance of this duty rested primarily with the assembly. This action of the house was, therefore, a mere announcement of adetermination to perform a duty imposed upon the representatives which, however, was probably dictated by a desire to secure a better rating of the bills than had been accomplished by the methods of estimating the depreciation which had actually been employed. In this action the board concurred on the 17th. [253] On the 21st of February the house instructed the secretary to inform the justices of the superior court that such a committee had been appointed, and on the 25th of February a report was presented which proved to be acceptable to the council, but was rejected by the house. Still another report of a committee appointed to ascertain the value of money was presented March 3, 1743-44. In this latter report the value of the ounce of silver was fixed at 7 s ., 6 d . in the new province bills. £142, l0 s . of these bills were said to be equal to £100 sterling. [254] Again the council agreed with the report and adopted an order that this should be the rule by which judgments should be made up in the courts, and again the house non-concurred, and this time they voted that however much the bills of the neighboring provinces had depreciated, bills of this province, in consequence of the fact that the time for their redemption was drawing near had not lessened in value and they resolved that the actual rate of silver in these bills was 7 s ., 2 d . an ounce and £137, l0s. in bills equal to £100 sterling. [255] With this the council unanimously non-concurred and on the 8th a conference was appointed to be held on the 9th. This, however, apparently failed to accomplish anything in the way of bringing the two bodies to an agreement as the council on the 10th, after the conference voted to adhere to their position. The house thereupon voted to refer to a joint committee the question of the rate at which province bills then commonly passed in the province in proportion to gold and silver and bills of exchange on London. On the 13th such a committee was appointed and on the 14th a report was submitted in which it was stated that the rate set by the former committee was just and this the council unanimously approved. [256] The house, however, continued recalcitrant and after having rejected the report of the committee they passed an order asserting in the preamble that the bills of credit of this province had in no degree depreciated since March 31, 1742. The house had determined a rule for the courts in which the board had non-concurred and there was no probability of agreement, they therefore voted that the eldest councillor of each county do forthwith meet as a committee and determine the rates of said bills of credit as the law directs, and that a certificate under their hands, or the hands of the major part of them, be lodged in the secretary's office accordingly. Whatever the intention of the house may have been in making this proposition, the council would not agree to it, but voted that the affair be left to the determination of the eldest councillors in each county, according to the directions of the law in that case made and provided, and that they be desired to meet forthwith in the said affair. To this the house in turn would not assent, but on the 16th the two bodies agreed upon a resolution in which after the language of the act which set forth the manner of proceeding was recited in the preamble, a vote followed that the said councillors do forthwith proceed to determine the affair as the law directs, and that a certificate under their hands or the hands of the major part of them be lodged in the secretary's office accordingly. It is hardly worth our while to waste any time in searching for all the points concealed beneath the language of the several orders above given and hereinafter recited. The temporary solution of the point seemed to consist in referring the determination of the matter as the law should direct to the councillors themselves, but it is obvious that the hint given by Hutchinson, which has already been referred to, was involved therein, and it is probable that a knowledge of the opinions of the individual councillors who were eligible to serve on this committee would help us to interpret the action of the two bodies.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A committee was appointed December 21, 1744, to inquire into the present value of the bills. They reported that in the bills issued since 1741, an ounce of silver was rated at 7 s . 6 d . and £100 sterling was equal to £142, 10 s . in said bills. This was adopted by the council and accepted by the house. [257]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">January 11, 1745-46 the house renewed this contest by sending up a vote that the eldest councillor in each of their counties where any of his Majesty's council inhabit be directed to ascertain the present value of the bills of credit of the province agreeably to the law in this case provided. Apparently nothing came of this for on the 25th of June a committee was appointed to ascertain the value of the bills. On the 28th of the same month the house in consequence of the failure of this committee to report, renewed its vote appointing the eldest councillors to perform that duty. On the 23rd of July they sent up to the council to ascertain if they had acted in the matter and learned that no action had as yet been taken. The next day the board voted that, whereas the six months since the last stating of the value of the bills of credit had expired on the 23rd, and some of the councillors appointed by law to state the value of the bills in case of failure of the General Court to do the same were then absent, it should be the duty of John Osborne, Esq., the eldest councillor then in Boston, to forthwith convene the other eldest councillors of the respective counties at Boston and appoint a day as soon as conveniently might be for their meeting in the said affair, that so a rule might be by them determined for the procedure of the courts in making up their judgments according to law.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was something in this vote that the house did not like and they sent up a messenger to the council with instructions to state to the board the provisions of the law bearing on the question and to add thereto a statement that the house desired that the eldest councillors then in town should notify the other councillors to convene as soon as might be to perform this duty. The record of this conflict between the two houses ends here, but it is probable that in some manner a rate was fixed for the rule of the courts in making up judgments.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the 2d of February, 1746-47, a committee was appointed to ascertain the value of the bills and this committee, Feb. 13, fixed the rate the same as the last which had been determined, but a question was raised on the next day as to the validity of the action of the council because some of the committee were then absent. The matter came up again March 26, 1747, and a vote of the council then passed was sent down to the house. In the preamble to this vote the council asserted that at the time of the last establishment of the value of the bills, February 18, all the councillors entitled to act were not present. For this reason the action then taken was perhaps not legal. Moreover they went on to say, the agents of the province at the court of Great Britain were then soliciting the reimbursement of the great expenses to which the province had been put in the reduction of Cape Breton. The result of this application would soon be known and in case it was favorable, it might reasonably be expected that the bills of public credit would greatly advance in value. For these reasons, justices were ordered in making up judgments at any time before August 1st, not to allow for depreciation otherwise than they had been wont in conformity with the several settlements of the value of bills preceding that of February 18th. The house would not agree to this in the form in which it came to them but on the 31st, the council having in the meantime solicited them to reconsider their action, they voted: That whereas the determination of value on the 18th of February was of doubtful legality, they would remove the doubt by voting that it was void and of no effect, and as the success of the solicitation of the province agents for a reimbursement of the charges of the late expedition might very much affect the value of bills, and the event of such solicitation was daily expected, they would therefore order the justices in making up judgments before August 1st next, to allow for depreciation, in like manner and not otherwise than they had been wont to allow in conformity to the settlement of said bills last preceding the before mentioned of the 18th of February.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">June 18, it was voted that the judges should proceed in making up judgments on the same basis until the 18th of February next, but on the 27th of June, 1747, Shirley refused his assent to this vote. No further action was taken until August 13th, when a committee was appointed to see what they thought necessary to do under the case after August 18th. On the 15th this committee was ordered to report forthwith and on the 18th their report was received and accepted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the 19th the house voted that they had taken the laws for the more equal payments of private debts into consideration. The rates of silver and bills of exchange were governed by the extravagant prices paid for bills of exchange to make remittances. The price of produce bore no proportion to them. If no special agreement had been made the judgment upon a debt should be for the sum appearing to be due, but for as much as such as had debts contracted before the last day of March 1747, on which they might expect an allowance for depreciation because of the laws in their favor and the difference in value between bills then and now, it was therefore ordered that on debts contracted before March 31, 1742, on which not more than six per cent. interest had been received, for every £100, £10 should be allowed for depreciation. In a similar way for those contracted after that date and before March 31, 1745, £7, l0s. should be allowed on every £100. On debts contracted after this last date and before March 31, 1747, £5 should be allowed on every £100. This was finally adopted August 25, with an amendment, the details of which are not given.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the 28th of August, Shirley again interposed and refused his assent to this determination of values. He assigned certain technical reasons, each of which would have been fatal to the legislation if insisted upon, but none of which would in any probability have been mentioned except for the fact that in his judgment the protection afforded to the creditor by existing laws was by this action arbitrarily set aside. He then alluded to the neglect of the committees appointed by law to ascertain the value of the bills, to make a just allowance for their depreciation from time to time during the past four years or thereabouts as it was their duty to have done.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the 8th of September the subject was again committed and a report was received on the 19th of October which was adopted in the House on the 20th. The governor gave his consent to the scheme on the 27th.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On debts contracted prior to March 31, 1742, 15% was allowed for depreciation. On debts contracted between that date and March 31, 1744, 12 1/2% was allowed for depreciation. On debts contracted between that date and March 31, 1746, 7 1/2%, was allowed for depreciation. On debts contracted between that date and March 31, 1747, 5% was allowed for depreciation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">No allowance to be made for depreciation where more than 6 per cent. interest was charged.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A report was adopted March 3, 1747-48 bearing on this subject, but we have no details. These are to be found, however, in a report dated November, 9, 1748. [258] It did not meet with Shirley's approval, being so unjust in its operations in his opinion, that it would be better to leave the matter in the hands of the courts. It will, however, serve to show the opinion of the assembly as to the depreciation. The allowances were as follows:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On debts contracted before March 31, 1742, 20%. On debts contracted after March 31, 1742, and before March 31, 1744, 16 1/2%. On debts contracted after March 31, 1744, and before March 31, 1746, 10%. On debts contracted after March 31, 1746, and before March 31, 1747, 6 1/2%.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">No allowance to be made if more than 6 per cent. interest charged.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A committee was appointed February 24, 1747-48, to determine the value of the public bills, but we have no report of its action. [259]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A review of the rates which had been fixed from time to time by the committees will enable us to judge of the consistency of the Assembly. These will be found in tabular form on the opposite page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The pressure in behalf of the debtors found expression in January 1744-45, in the passage of an act in addition to the act for ascertaining the value of money and of the bills of public credit of the province. The Plate 13 4 d. bill, 1744; 6 d. bill, 1744. fact that certain creditors exacted more than six per cent, from their debtors was attributed to an effort on the part of such creditors to provide in this indirect way for the depreciation of the bills. Other covert methods of accomplishing the same result were enumerated, and in cases where the fact could be established that the creditor had received from the debtor compensation of this character, it was ordered in the first section of the act that no further allowance was to be made to such creditor.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">On the other hand, it was asserted that some legislation was necessary to protect creditors from loss caused by the depreciation of bills since March 31, 1742. To cure this defect in the law special provision was made in the second section of the act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The third section was devoted to the benefit of the debtor class. It was asserted that there was a prevailing apprehension that bills of credit of the new tenor were to be esteemed as lawful money. Consequently, many persons had given bonds to pay lawful money where nothing but public bills had been received, and in such cases, nothing but bills had been expected by creditors in payment of the debt. Notwithstanding these facts some of the courts of the province had made up judgments on such debts for lawful money only, and had construed the same not to be payable in public bills, whereby the debtor had been capable of discharging the execution only with silver. The extreme scarcity of silver practically put the debtor in the creditor's hands in such cases. This oppression the government ought to prevent. It was, therefore, enacted that for the space of five years from the date of the first emission of the new tenor bills in 1741-42 judgment should be given only for bills in cases where silver was not given or received. [260]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If when Shirley assumed the reins of government, creditors needed protection against the depreciation of the currency, they certainly needed it all the more when the rise in silver was stimulated beyond all control under the reckless issues made in behalf of the military ventures of the province after 1744. The sympathies of the assembly were, however, with the debtor class, and in 1747, all efforts on the part of the province to protect creditors against depreciation were withdrawn.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The clause in the act for ascertaining the value of money, in which it was in substance provided that ordinary debts were to be adjudged as equal in amount to the silver which could be purchased with the bills in which the debt was nominally estimated, expired by the terms of the act on the last day of March, 1747. In September, 1747, an act was passed in addition to and explanatory of this act, and the other legislation to which it had given rise. [261] In the preamble it was asserted that provision in the former act had been made for determining the depreciation of the bills only through silver and bills of exchange which were made the standard. This rule, it had been found by experience, did not work well. The value of the bills could not properly be estimated by the value of any one or two particular "commodities or merchandizes", such as bills of exchange and silver then were, within this and the other colonies. It had been found that the prices of these two "commodities" were liable to be very suddenly and immoderately increased by a few persons for the sake of serving their own interests, whereby bills of credit had often been much depreciated with respect to bills of exchange or silver, though, at the same time, they had preserved their value with respect to all other "commodities and merchandizes" in the province. To prevent this inconvenience in the future, it was provided that in any valuation of the bills of public credit thereafter made for the above purposes [262] consideration must not only be had of silver and bills of exchange, but also of the prices of provisions and other necessaries of life. Regard was also to be had to fluctuations caused by the plenty or scarcity of the articles considered. More specific regulations were made with reference to the committee of councillors who were to determine the depreciation, and inasmuch as dilatory creditors might postpone making demands upon their debtors and thus compel the maintenance of this committee for an indefinite period, a limit was set to the time when the depreciation was to be allowed on judgments on debts incurred within the period covered by the original act. The rule respecting the allowance to be made for the depreciation of bills of public credit was restrained to debts contracted within the period mentioned in the act and was not to extend to any other whatsoever.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In other words, the act was not only not extended, but limitations were put upon its future operations and the method of estimating the depreciation was altered by the inclusion of provisions and other necessaries of life with silver and exchange as standards.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The enormous changes in the values of the bills of credit produced by their rapid depreciation during the years 1746 and 1747, rendered the equitable adjustment of the relation of debtors and creditors more and more perplexing. An act which was passed for this purpose January 27, 1748-49, was disallowed by Shirley and in his speech to the assembly April 8, 1749, he recommended that the matter be left to the courts of judicature. Again at the close of the session, on the 22nd of April, 1749, the assembly made another attempt to legislate upon the subject. Shirley at that tune. informed them that the bill had come before him too late for him to sign it. On the 24th of June, 1749, the governor referred the assembly to his former speeches and messages on the subject. He said with regard to debts contracted since October 31, 1747, that the price of good private bills of exchange payable in London was at that time at the rate of £1,100 in bills of credit of the old tenor for £100 sterling. He was satisfied that there had been no depreciation of the currency since that date notwithstanding the recent exorbitant rise in provisions. [263] He thought debtors could be protected by passing a bill to prevent the courts from making any allowance for the bills of credit on debts contracted since October 31, 1747, specialties and express contracts excepted. He did not approve of any action looking towards the future. This was what he had in view in his speech of the 26th of October, 1748, and he was ready to join in passing an act which would give more ample relief to the debtors within that period than what was provided in that bill. This allowance he said was 10 per cent, on debts contracted between the last day of October, 1747, and the last day of March in the same year. During this period he claimed that there had in reality been no depreciation at all. It would seem as if by "March in the same year" in the above connection Shirley must have meant March, 1748. [264]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The assembly went forward with the consideration of a bill on this subject and apparently did not pay proper attention to his advice, for on the 29th of June, 1749, he refused his consent to a bill for ascertaining the allowance to be made by courts of judicature in rendering judgments on suits for debts payable in bills of credit. The money for the reimbursement of the expenses of the Cape Breton expedition had by this tune been paid over, and was on its way to the province.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Between 1730 and 1745, the price of silver was influenced more by the circulation in this province of the bills of the neighboring governments, than by the local issues of the province itself. The restraints imposed upon Massachusetts Bay and New Hampshire, kept the amount of the emissions of these provinces within some sort of bounds, and had it not been for the contributions to the currency from the other governments, the price of silver during this period would have been more nearly proportioned to the amount in circulation of the bills issued by Massachusetts Bay. As it was, silver was disproportionately high during all this period. The fact has already been stated that in January, 1738-39, an attempt was made by legislation to prevent the circulation in this province of the bills of the neighboring governments. [265] "This law," Shirley said, "was particularly calculated to prevent the currency of the Rhode Island bills here but it had not the least effect before my coming to the administration." [266] In January, 1742-43, [267] an attempt was made to secure legislation on the subject, and on the 22d of June, 1743, the assembly appointed a committee to confer with representatives from the neighboring governments with a view of preventing the depreciation of the bills. [268]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the 9th of February, 1743-44, Shirley communicated to the assembly an estimate of the losses incurred by the community through the circulation of these outside bills and said that up to that time no answer had been received to the proposition for a conference which had been submitted on the 22d of June. He had stated to them on the 9th of September, 1743, that there were according to the estimate of competent persons £400,000 in bills of the other governments in circulation in this province, and he proceeded at this time to say that of these, £350,000 were contributed by Rhode Island and £50,000 by Connecticut. He estimated the emissions of Rhode Island at that time at £440,000, while £70,000 he thought would have been abundant for that colony.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">March 17, 1743-44, a second attempt was made to prevent by legislation the evil of a currency from outside and uncontrollable sources. [269] It was asserted in the preamble of the act then passed that bills of the neighboring governments were then and had been the principal medium of trade and commerce in the province that some of those governments, more especially that of Rhode Island, had frequently made extravagant emissions of their bills, which by depreciating all bills current had worked great injustice to the inhabitants of the province. The circulation of Rhode Island bills issued since 1742, and of the bills of other governments hereafter to be issued, was prohibited in this province under severe penalties. The act was to continue in force for two years. In September, 1746, its operation was extended for three years longer. [270]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the 10th of January, 1745-46, a memorial of sundry merchants of Boston was presented to the house, in which the danger from the currency of Rhode Island bills, notwithstanding the law then in force, was fully set forth. The petition of the merchants for relief was refused on the 15th of that month. In June, however, the house took the matter up again and on the 5th, the question being submitted whether a committee should be directed to prepare a bill for the revival of the act to prevent the great injury arising to the inhabitants of this province by the frequent and very large emissions of bills of public credit of the neighboring governments, it was voted in the affirmative so far as the Rhode Island bills were concerned, but in the negative as to the bills of Connecticut and New Hampshire. Some sort of a bill must have got through the house at that time, for August 14th, they sent up to the board to see if action had been had upon it. The reply was that there had not.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To a certain extent the law makers themselves of this province were responsible for the circulation within its borders of the bills which it was now sought to eliminate from the currency. These bills had repeatedly been recognized as a part of the circulating medium in the various acts which had been passed against counterfeiting, altering and mutilating public bills. The first of these acts, passed in August, 1704, was limited in its operation to the protection of bills of credit of this province. [271] The penalty for making or uttering was that the culprit should be branded in the right cheek with the letter F and should pay double damages or suffer imprisonment. For altering bills it was the same as that for the offence of forgery, [272] to which was added triple damages to the person upon whom altered bills had been passed. In June, 1711, the same penalty was imposed for counterfeiting or altering the bills of the neighboring governments, [273] and in the preamble of the act it was asserted that this action was taken because these bills had obtained currency here, therefore the falsifying or counterfeiting them would prove of pernicious consequence, would hurt and obstruct her Majesty's service, would interrupt mutual andreciprocal trade and commerce and would cause loss and damage to private persons. In December, 1715, a reward was offered to informers who should secure the conviction of counterfeiters of bills of this province. [274] In November, 1720, the penalty for counterfeiting the bills of this and the neighboring provinces was changed to death. [275]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In January 1735-36, signs of the reaction against the bills of the foreign governments appear in a new law against counterfeiting public bills from which the bills of the neighboring governments are excluded. The penalty is death without benefit of the clergy. [276]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There is nothing in the preamble of this act to explain why the bills of the neighboring governments were not included, but there must have been some reason for this action and it would be natural to conclude that it was because the assembly was no longer desirous of protecting this outside currency. In the bill passed in February, 1736-37, to prevent the sub-division of public bills for purposes of making change, bills of the neighboring governments were included with bills of this province in the prohibition. [277] To a certain extent this militates against the conclusion drawn above, but it does not alter the fact that the explanation there suggested is not only plausible but under the circumstances, natural.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The action taken by the assembly in February, 1736-37, in the attempt to protect the bills of neighboring governments from mutilation was the last effort of that body which could be interpreted as in any way favoring the circulation of bills of the neighboring governments, although the subject was before the house June 4, 1743, and a committee was appointed to prepare a bill to prevent the counterfeiting of bills of this and the neighboring governments. Nothing came of this, however, and the next steps were those already referred to, in which the attempt was made absolutely to prohibit the circulation of all the recent issues of the neighboring governments.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER X. THE LORDS OF THE TREASURY FAVOR REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE LOUISBURG EXPEDITION AND PARLIAMENT PASSES THE GRANT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The events which took place in London in connection with the passage of the act for the reimbursement of the colonies for their expenditures in the Cape Breton expedition form an important part of this narrative and require consideration at this point.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The period during which the Lords of the Treasury and parliament had this question under discussion includes the date of the destruction by fire of the Boston town house in 1747. Through the aid of duplicate papers and reports sent to England, we are enabled to supply many of the deficiencies caused by the loss of papers at that fire. In one respect, the treasurer's annual statements, which he was accustomed to forward to England, we are unable to do so. For some reason the forwarding of these reports was stopped in 1744, and this omission was not noticed for some years thereafter. When it was discovered in London that the information to be obtained from these reports was not on file there, and duplicates were called for, it was stated that the gap could not be filled owing to the destruction of the books of account in the fire. [278]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For some time prior to the year 1744, the assembly had availed themselves of the services of Christopher Kilby, who was then in London, as their representative in matters which they wished brought to the consideration of the authorities there. In February, 1743-44 [279] he was duly appointed agent of the province, [280] and on the 27th of that month the house took under consideration the question of his instructions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At that time an effort was being made to induce parliament to take steps towards a reformation of the currency in the colonies. It was greatly feared that the fact that restraints had been imposed upon the emissions of the province of the Massachusetts Bay, while some of the neighboring governments had been left entirely free to issue what they pleased, might not be recognized and it was asserted that representations and proposals had been sent home which had "treated this government and people in a manner injurious, endeavoring to subvert that freedom of assembly which by charter they enjoy." The house, therefore, voted to instruct the secretary to write to Kilby that he was expected to give careful attendance to any application whereby the charter liberties or quiet of the province might be affected, and he was to use his utmost endeavor to prevent any proceeding thereon, until particularly instructed by the General Court. The form in which this vote was phrased did not meet with the approval of the council, and after several attenipts at amendments the matter was finally concluded on the 29th by instructions from the assembly, to the effect that he was especially to give careful attendance to any representations that might have been sent home by any private person or persons, whereby the charter privileges and interests of this people might be affected, and to use his utmost endeavors to prevent any proceedings thereon, until he should have received instructions. Again, on the first of March, 1743-44, it was ordered that the agent be instructed, in case there should be any parliamentary inquiry into the state of the currencies to do all in his power to prevent any injury. This last vote may have been taken in response to a suggestion made by the governor who on that day stated to the assembly that he estimated the losses sustained by the people of the province from the circulation of the bills of the neighboring governments at £100,000, and he expressed the hope that some steps might be taken to distinguish between the bills of the province of the Massachusetts Bay, and those of the neighboring governments. On the 16th of October, 1744, the contents of the bill about the currencies which was then being discussed by parliament was communicated to the house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There is in the archives a copy of an act entitled, "a bill to regulate and restrain paper bills of credit and for ascertaining the currency thereof in his Majesty's colonies or plantations of Rhode Island and Providence plantations, Connecticutt, the Massachusetts Bay and New Hampshire in America, and to prevent the same being legal tender in payment for money", which is, perhaps, the same as the proposed bill communicated at that time to the house. There were to be no more paper bills and no postponements of redemptions. The penalty for Rhode Island and Connecticut was to be the forfeiture of their charters. Short term bills for current expenses might be allowed, and emergent expenses might be provided for by special emissions under royal approval. The measure of values was to be the piece of eight of seventeen pennyweight, which was to pass at six shillings. [281]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the 24th of February, 1743-44, the council being of opinion that the currency question, either then was under discussion in parliament or soon would be, and that justice would not be done this province unless steps were taken to show the difference between the emissions of this government and those of its neighbors, voted [282] that his excellency be requested to make a full representation of the whole matter to his Majesty's ministers of state, and to use his kind offices therein. The house, being not only jealous of its prerogatives, but having always displayed a fondness for addresses and arguments, promptly non-concurred in this vote, thus showing that they had no desire to make use of the kind offices of the governor. Indeed, it may be assumed that his employment as their mouth-piece was one of the last functions in which they would willingly have availed themselves of his services.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">July 27th, 1745, the house voted to prepare a petition to his Majesty for relief under the heavy burthen occasioned by the Cape Breton expedition. On the 30th the petition in this behalf was accepted, and on the 31st of July, William Bollan, who was then about to embark for Great Britain, and who was said to be thoroughly familiar with the matter, was authorized to act in concert with Kilby, the agent of the province, in preparing and pursuing the petition of the two houses for relief under the insupportable charges of the Cape Breton expedition.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The presentation of the petition, perhaps influenced by the appointment of Bollan, created hopes that the depreciation of the bills might be checked, and thus render their redemption through the reimbursement feasible. We have evidence of this feeling in a proposition submitted to the assembly in June, 1746, the method suggested in which was doubtless an outcome of the loan made at the time of the Hill and Walker expedition against Quebec. At that time the province loaned its bills to the Boston merchants in order to enable them to purchase supplies for the expedition, the merchants taking their pay from the troops and the fleet, in bills of exchange on London, which would not be paid for some time thereafter. In the present case, the merchants had the bills in hand, and believed that the exchange would be promptly met, and therefore, on the 6th of June, 1746, they made the following proposition: They said that to prevent the evils arising from the great floods of paper money which had been and were being issued in the province, they would offer to the General Court such sums of province bills as might be needed for the proposed expedition against Canada then under consideration, upon condition of being paid at a reasonable exchange by bills on Great Britain. In case the expenses of the expedition should not be paid by Great Britain, they would be content to take their pay in province bills without interest, when it should become known that the charges would not be reimbursed, provided this period did not exceed twelve months. By this last clause it was probably intended merely to limit the time that they should allow the use of the bills without charge for interest. [283]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If this proposition had been adopted it is evident that it would have had a tendency to check the depreciation of the bills, but it was received with such disfavor in the house that the representatives not only declined to consider it then, but actually voted that they would not entertain its consideration at any future time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Evidence of the favorable disposition of the Lords of the Treasury and of parliament towards the claim of the New England governments for reimbursement of the expenses incurred in the prosecution of the Louisburg expedition soon led the agents of the province to believe that but little difficulty would be experienced in securing payment for the same. On the 14th of November, 1746, however, Bollan met with a set-back which seriously disconcerted him and made him realize that the path which led to success in this affair was not free from obstructions and perils. While the matter was still fresh in his mind he wrote that the Lords Commissioners had on the fourteenth come to the conclusion that some satisfaction, and he underscored the word "some," should be made the province. The fact that a favorable conclusion was reached had been previously communicated to him and the introduction at this time of the word "some" he regarded as of sinister import. It might produce fatal consequences and his astonishment was so great that he could not tell what to say to it. He still had hopes, but they were very slender, that he could get this dangerous word wiped out. [284]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the 15th of January, 1746-47, a favorable report was made on the petition of the province [285] for the reimbursement, and the matter was referred to a committee to adjust and liquidate the accounts on which it was based. Bollan submitted to this committee copies of acts showing emissions of public bills in aid of theLouisburg expedition amounting to £258,800, and also a transfer of £20,000 more, originally issued for another purpose. This was accompanied by vouchers showing expenditures amounting to £261,700, 0s. 3d. Certificates were also submitted showing that silver was rated at that time at 7s. 6d. by committees appointed to ascertain the value of bills, and that £142, 10s. in bills were then equal to £100 sterling. [286]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As time went on, and the conviction ripened that the application for reimbursement was likely to prove successful, thoughtful men began to appreciate the fact that the reception in the province of so large an amount of coin would furnish an opportunity for the resumption of specie payments. There was a division of opinion among the hard money men as to how it was best to do this. Dr. Douglass, who had been a consistent opponent of the heresies of the land bank, and an earnest advocate of a specie basis for the circulating medium, was a firm believer in the necessity of approaching the matter cautiously, and was violent in his opposition to a radical and sudden attempt at the conversion of the paper money then circulating into coin at current rates. He believed that it could best be accomplished by making the redemptions by degrees, and that any other method would work destruction upon the trade of the province. On the other hand, Hutchinson thought that the true method was to grapple with the whole question at once, and redeem the bills on the basis of their then depreciation. The advocates of paper money, in their turn, were appalled at the shrinkage in the amount of the currency which any such proceeding involved, and were heartily opposed to any plan which had in view an abrupt attempt to make such enormous reductions of nominal values. The evidences that these questions were occupying the attention of the public are to be found in various directions. They showed themselves from time to time in the various votes which were taken in connection with the action of time committees for ascertaining the value of money, some of which have been already given.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The pamphleteers also took a hand in the discussion. In 1748, a writer who was opposed to the plan for resuming specie payments, which was ultimately adopted, submitted for public consideration a proposition of his own. [287] He referred to an article which had been printed in the "Independent Advertiser," No. 13, March 28, advocating the use of the Louisburg reimbursement for resumption, and then proposed "to keep all the silver money bounty granted, for ever in the Bank of England, as the government's fund and bottom, and to have the interest thereof only drawn for yearly by the government, which interest will amount to about eighty thousand pounds (as our money now stands) yearly, and so every year sink and burn eighty thousand pounds of our paper bills."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The expectations of the assembly may be gathered from a report of a committee which had been appointed to consider some method for preventing the depreciation of the currency. They were of opinion on the 5th of June, 1747, that considering the expectation of the speedy reimbursement of the charges of the Cape Breton expedition, it would be most convenient to defer the determination of this question to some future time. The messages and speeches of the governor also contain hints of a belief that the days of paper money were drawing to an end.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the 29th of October, 1747, Shirley called upon the assembly to furnish money to pay the troops raised for the late intended expedition against Canada. This message was communicated to the representatives November 5th, and they answered that they would, were it in their power, advance with the utmost cheerfulness the money for the payment of the troops, but they had no other way to do this than by more emissions of public bills. They had already issued exorbitant sums, and beside these, the bills of the other governments circulated promiscuously in the province. Should such a sum be issued it would be followed by a great "impair", if not utter loss of the public credit. The truth of each of the propositions laid down by the house was obvious. Notwithstanding this, Shirley, on the 3d of February, 1747-48, said to the assembly, "I must earnestly recommend you to find some other way for the supply of the treasury than by making new emissions of public bills." It might, perhaps, have been expected of the governor, in view of the fact that the representatives had already announced that they knew of no other way to raise money than by the emission of public bills, that he should himself suggest some new method of supplying the treasury. Although no way of escape from the difficulties of the situation presented itself at that time, it is worthy of note that for the first time since the province began to rely upon this method of supplying its treasury, the governor and the house were of one opinion as to the effect of emitting more bills.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Meantime news from Great Britain had been received from the agents of the province, sometimes full of encouragement, often of a despondent nature, according to the turn that events had taken and the feelings of the writer. On the 3rd of October, 1747, Kilby wrote in a hopeful strain concerning the progress made with the petition for reimbursement. [288] Bollan, on the 5th of November, said that he had the day before attended a meeting of a sub-committee having in charge the accounts of the province submitted in connection with the petition. A proposition had then been made to pay only such sum as was equal to the present value of the bills of credit. He was greatly surprised at this, because at the outset of the discussion with the Lords of the Treasury, it had been agreed that the questions to determine were, what sum in currency is due? and, what was sterling exchange at the time of the expenditures? He had said that he would not submit to such a proposition. It would be no payment at all. He thought his arguments had produced a good result and had convinced the committee. [289]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After having prematurely announced December 10, 1747, that parliament had provided for payment of the province by passing a grant, Bollan wrote January 1, 1747-48, that he had encouragement that the affair would be dispatched when their lordships met again. [290]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Instead of the grant having been made by parliament, as Bollan thought in December, the fact was that the Lords of the Treasury still retained their clutch upon the petition, and their delay in action caused much perturbation. February 29, 1747-48, Bollan wrote expressing his surprise and concern that the Lords insisted so much at this time onthe fall of bills. He had attended a meeting on the 15th of the month, at which Pelham, First Lord Commissioner, had proposed that the province should be paid a sum equal only to the value of the bills at that time and had asked Bollan what he had to say. The latter was apparently prepared for the occasion, for he wrote that "several things were said not pleasant to hear." The result of the interview was that the question was to be referred to parliament.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the same letter, Bollan complained that while he was striving to gain for the province the value of their expenses on account of the expedition, there were several others who were very busy in framing their schemes for disposing of the money. Some of them, he was told, had applied to the treasury to prevent payment being made to the province until their proposed regulations could be enforced. The only use made of these applications, so far as he knew, was to draw arguments thence for the payment of the lesser sum. These persons were weak and officious and ought to have known that the only result of their interposition would be to reduce the amount to be paid or to delay the payment. He wished express power to receive the money, to be forwarded to him at an early date. [291]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In a letter to Pelham dated the 25th of February, Bollan gave his reasons why the province should receive the full value of the bills at the time of the expedition. They were in substance that the debts then contracted still retained their original values; that if the lesser sum should be paid, the province would be a loser by one-half the sum expended; that the sinking of the bills, in itself a hardship, had been caused by the delay in the payment of the reimbursement; and to pay on the basis of the value of the bills at that time would be grafting a new hardship on an old one; that if it was reasonable to do this, then by waiting longer there would be still less to pay and if payment should be delayed until the province was ruined, there would be nothing to pay;that according to calculations which had been made, the payment of the lesser sum would be entirely exhausted in providing for the expenses incurred by the province in holding Louisburg and would not provide a farthing towards its capture. Further, he believed the payment of the lesser sum to be incompatible with the tenor of the bills. [292]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the province, Hutchinson took advantage of the evident growth of the desire for a return to specie payments and on the 16th of February, 1747-48, a memorial of his, offering proposals for regulating the medium of trade of this province was submitted to the house and was referred to a joint committee. The details of Hutchinson's proposition are not given in the records but a copy of a memorial said to have been presented by him February 3rd, 1747-48, is in the archives and through references in the correspondence of Bollan, it may be identified as the plan then submitted. [293]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hutchinson thought the reimbursement of the expense for the Louisburg expedition probable and proposed that this money should be used for sinking the variable paper medium then in circulation and substituting a fixed and unalterable money. There was then extant, he thought, near £1,900,000 old tenor. The charge of the expedition he estimated at £170,000 sterling. He proposed that enough should be borrowed to redeem all the outstanding paper. £50,000 he considered adequate for this purpose and this could easily be repaid in twelve annual payments. This sum should be imported in bullion, or Spanish milled dollars and Portuguese gold. He would pay a debt of 44 shillings old tenor with one dollar in silver. The concurrence of the neighboring governments should be sought and a bill prepared for submission to them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bearing in mind that the silver dollar was valued at six shillings, it will be seen that Hutchinson's proposition was to settle debts contracted in old tenor at the rate of seven and one-third for one in silver. The £220,000 to be derived from the estimated reimbursement and the loan, throwing aside fractional parts of pounds would have amounted to £293,333 New England money. [294] If converted into old tenor at the above rate it would have been equivalent to £2,151,108. This would have left on hand a little over £34,000 New England money if Hutchinson's estimate of £1,900,000 old tenor outstanding was correct. It is possible that he feared an under-estimate of the currency and wished to be sure on that point.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The committee appointed to take the memorial under their charge reported to the house on the 24th. They were unanimously of opinion that the proposals in the memorial might prove very salutary to the province, and they offered for consideration a bill entitled "An act for calling in and exchanging the bills of credit, of the several denominations which have at any time been issued by this government, and are still outstanding, and for ascertaining the rate of coined silver in this province for the future." They recommended that a copy of this bill should be sent to the governments of Connecticut, New Hampshire and Rhode Island, and that it should be proposed to each of these governments to appoint commissioners to meet in this province the 12th of April, or as soon thereafter as might be, to treat with such commissioners as should be appointed by this government in order to the bringing to a period the bills of all these several governments in the like manner as was proposed for the bills of this, and also to settle the rates and values of money in the several governments for the future. The report was accepted by both houses and the governor affixed his consent to the same. [295] On the 27th, a committee was appointed to meet and confer with such gentlemen as should be appointed by the other governments pursuant to the vote of acceptance by the court of the report of the committee of both houses on the memorial of Thomas Hutchinson. A letter to the neighboring governments was prepared, and on the 5th of March was accepted by both houses and was regularly approved by the governor. [296] This letter announced that in view of the probable reimbursement by parliament, the assembly of this province had projected a bill for improving the opportunity to put an end to the paper currency of the province, a copy of which would be enclosed. This bill had received two readings at that time. It was thought to be desirable, in view of the general currency of the bills of the several governments, that a conference should be held, so that if possible, one general method should be adopted by all. The vote of this province appointing commissioners was also to be enclosed, and the danger of not arriving at an agreement was pointed out. [297] This attempt to secure cooperation resulted in a complete failure. Hopes, however, of accomplishing this result were kept up even under the most discouraging circumstances, and on November 2, 1748, a vote was passed to send messengers to each of these governments to see if a conference could not be brought about. [298] The relations of the other governments to the question of reimbursement were widely different from those of this province. Rhode Island, for instance, had an enormous circulation of bills of public credit, while her expectations in the way of reimbursement were very small. What constituted an eligible opportunity for the people of this province was practically of no value whatever to the people of Rhode Island. For this cause there was but little reason to expect cooperation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The opinion had now become strong that the time was near at hand when payment might be expected from Great Britain, and it was realized even before Bollan reminded the assembly of the necessity for this action, that some person or persons would have to receive the money in behalf of the province, for which purpose special authority would be required. It was, therefore, voted on the 5th of March, 1747-48, that Bollan be authorized to receive for the use of the province all such sums of money as were or should be granted by parliament to or for the province for payment of the expenses of the Cape Breton expedition.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The fact that Shirley's former suggestions as to the necessity for raising money in some other way than by bills of credit had failed, did not deter him from renewing his assaults. On the 26th of May, 1748, he said to the assembly, "You must be convinced that if you had not made any new bills of credit for the last two years a moderate interest for the money borrowed would have been more than repaid by the loss and damage it would have saved to the public." . . . "Upon these considerations I hope you will take some other expedient than making bills of credit for the supply of the treasury." It will be noted that Shirley intimated in the foregoing that the province could have borrowed money. This is the only suggestion put forward by him for any method of meeting the extraordinary expenses of the province and this it will be observed is indirect. The answer of the assembly was an emission of £100,000 bills of the last tenor in June of that year.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the 2d of April, 1748, Bollan wrote that the House of Commons had the day before resolved that the reimbursement was reasonable. The time of the payment had not been determined but after securing an agreement to pay the larger sum he had insisted upon prompt payment, so that the bills of credit might be retired. The matter had been referred to the treasury. Its progress had been attended with numberless difficulties and it would be for the honor of the province that the money should be carried over and exchanged for bills of credit. This was made necessary by what was said in parliament. [299]</field>

      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XI. THE DELIVERY OF THE MONEY IS DELAYED AND OBSTRUCTED.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Two stages in the progress of the petition had now been accomplished: The favorable consideration by the Lords of the Treasury and the grant by parliament of the specific sum of money which had been recommended.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It might, perhaps, have been inferred that the payment, without further discussion, was to be the next step in the transaction. Such, however, did not prove to be the case. There was temporizing on the part of the Lords of the Treasury, obstruction on the part of merchants, and discussions as to the amount and the manner of payment. Bollan's firm defence of the rights of the province and his active opposition to the obstructionists, alone saved the grant in its integrity for the use of the province. On the 15th of June, 1748, he filed a petition with the Lords of the Treasury in which he set forth that the province was reduced to poverty, weakness and distress, by the prosecution of the expedition for the reduction of Louisburg. [300] He recapitulated the existing state of affairs in detail and asserted that the province was absolutely compelled to alter its currency, yet was unable to do so until these expenses should be reimbursed. The longer the delay the greater the opportunity for capitalists to absorb the bills. He prayed for payment as soon as conveniently might be.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The impression made by Bollan left Kilby so far behind in popular esteem that the latter felt impelled to set matters right as far as he could. He, therefore, wrote, June 30, 1748, that from the outset it had been evident that parliament would grant the petition. The evident purpose of the letter was to convey the impression that, after all, the agents of the province had not influenced matters to any appreciable extent. [301]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the 7th of September, 1748, Bollan wrote that the method of payment was still unsettled. He was surprised at this, as he had supposed that all those details were agreed upon before the money was granted by parliament. The ministry had proposed that the payment be made by instalments, the last in 1754. He had urged immediate payment, but, although no vote was taken upon the question, it was the general sense of parliament that the determination of this point should be left to the treasury. He claimed that the grant having been duly made, the exchequer had no other control over the money than to pay it over when the condition of the treasury would permit, and he insisted upon the right of the province to have this done without conditions as to the application of the money.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Divers persons, he said, had thronged about the treasury with plans and proposals as to the payment of the money. At the time when he claimed that the province was entitled to the reimbursement of all the expenses of the expedition he stood single, without the aid of any man living. He was indignant at those people, who under pretence of serving the province, obstructed the payment of the money. He had insisted upon the rights of the province in its corporate capacity to the money, but Kilby had interposed and declared that their Lordships ought to stand between the province and the merchants or possessors of bills. The Lords Commissioners had told him, August 10th, that he must be accountable to the exchequer for the money when received. He claimed that he could only be accountable to the province itself after payment was made, but if necessary in order to get the money, he would submit. He was glad to receive orders to oppose the fixing of a rate at which the bills should be exchanged. To avoid confusion he had not laid before the board the plan of Mr. Hutchinson. [302]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Lords of the Treasury, at a meeting held at the treasury chambers, Whitehall, September 14, 1748, advanced an entirely new proposition in regard to the payment of the grant. They said that in the first place they should require adequate security from the person appointed to receive the money. When that was provided to their satisfaction, they would pay over one third of the money. The method of payment would then be reported to the governor, and if satisfactory, he could signify his approval of the same. Upon receipt of this approval the remainder would be paid. [303]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This suggestion met with Bollan's violent opposition. He was opposed to giving security upon principle, but apart from that, if this was done, it would involve the payment at the remembrancer's office of 6 s . 8 d . on every £100. "The charges of getting into this court," he said, "are certain, but no man can tell what it will cost to get out." [304]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In reply to this proposition, Bollan filed a memorial with the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury. He could not agree, he said, to give security, and to receive the money in the manner proposed. Firstly, because the province as a body politic had an absolute right to the money which had been granted by parliament, and from the date of the passage of the grant stood in the position of a creditor of the kingdom. Secondly, the money being due, the person duly authorized to receive it had a right to claim delivery, and it did not lie in the power of the exchequer to interpose objections. Thirdly, the court of exchequer was a court of record and as such could settle a debt but could not create any new obligations. The substitute for the province could only be chargeable to the province. Fourthly, as no obligation on the part of the substitute could be created, no security should be required. Fifthly, the statute provided that the money should be paid over without limitations or conditions. Lastly, the payment of one third would be of no service whatever for the purposes to which it was intended to apply the money. He then pointed out, how, through a deposit in the Bank of England, he had always intended to throw around the money the necessary protection for its security. [305]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was at this time, while the Lords of the Treasury were seeking to avoid the payment, at one time, of the entire grant, and were calling upon Bollan to furnish satisfactory security before they would agree to deliver the money, a task which he might have found very difficult of performance, that a number of merchants and others trading to and interested in New England, added the weight of their influence to the opposition with which Bollan was contending. On the 21st of September, 1748, they presented a memorial to the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, setting forth the general facts as to the decline of the currency and especially pointing out that since the account of the province was stated, exchange had risen from 540 to more than 1000 per cent. Large quantities of bills had been collected by individuals in the expectation that possessors would realize this difference. They proposed that the remittance of the money should be held back until parliament should fix a rule for its application and that then it should be made in coin suited to the country. They asserted that many persons in the administration of the government of the province had become possessors of bills and expected to receive nearly double what they had paid. [306]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The insinuation that the members of the province government were speculating in the bills of credit was officially denied in a letter of instructions sent November 22, 1748, to Bollan. [307] This is not, perhaps, of much importance, for however influential the signers of this memorial, the blow which they then struck produced far less results than might have been expected. It is to the credit of the Lords of the Treasury that notwithstanding the support which they received in their temporizing policy from a body of men closely allied to the province and deeply interested in its welfare, they allowed themselves to be convinced by the arguments in opposition thereto, submitted by Bollan, and did not take advantage of this memorial further to postpone payment. On the same day that it was presented they acknowledged that the money was due and ready for payment. They were not, however, satisfied with Bollan's power which was said to have been given before the vote of parliament. For this reason, they thought he ought to give security, but would refer the point to their counsel. [308] In due course of time the matter was referred to the Attorney General and Solicitor General and on the 23rd of November, 1748, they reported that Bollan's power, not being under the seal of the province, was not satisfactory. They thought that this defect could not be cured by security being given. [309] In order to provide against future contentions of this sort, Bollan wrote November 29, that he proposed to have a form of a power of attorney approved by the Attorney General, which he would then forward to the province for execution. [310]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The resolve of the House of Commons allowing the province £183,649, 2 s . 7 1/2 d . sterling, as a reimbursement for the expenses of the Cape Breton expedition was communicated to the house of representatives on the 13th of June, 1748. This was followed later by information that the method of payment had been referred to his Majesty's ministers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the 27th of October, Shirley in his speech to the assembly, distinctly asserted that a bill for sinking the currency by means of the late reimbursement had been passed and had been transmitted to England. This bill, he said, "which passed both houses of the last assembly", he had reason to believe had induced his Majesty's ministers, to whom consideration of the manner of paying the money voted for the benefit of the colonies had been referred, to determine that it should be paid in such a manner as would put an end to the paper currency in New England.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In referring to the bill passed by both houses of the last assembly, Shirley could only have meant the act for calling in and exchanging the bills of credit, which was reported by the committee appointed to consider Hutchinson's scheme. While the report of the committee had been accepted, and an attempt had been made to establish an agreement upon the subject with the other governments of New England, there is no record of any other action in the assembly than the reading of this bill. Under ordinary circumstances one would hardly look beyond the official utterances of the governor to the law-making body itself, for proof that legislation had taken place. Yet it must be inferred from the absence of any record of further action in the assembly, and from language subsequently used by Bollan, that this statement was made solely for the effect that it might produce.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the 18th of November, the assembly petitioned the Lords Commissioners for prompt payment of the money, stating that they hoped by means of it to remove the paper currency then in circulation and substitute silver therefor. [311]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Shirley's positive statement concerning the passage of the bill for sinking the currency made to the assembly as above stated, attracted the attention of the Board of Trade, and on the 23rd of January, 1748-49, they summoned Bollan to appear before them on the 24th, at eleven o'clock in the morning. Bollan accordingly presented himself next day, and was interrogated as to his reasons for concealing the action of the assembly on so important a point as the passage of this bill. The board thought proper to require of him some information with respect to said bill and to acquaint him with the mischiefs and difficulties which might arise from the government not being informed of the sense of the province upon an affair the determination of which was then under consideration. Bollan was in a quandary as to what he could say. He had received a copy of the proposed bill with authority to use it if he saw fit, but he knew that it was not a law, and he believed that it would be impracticable to borrow the £50,000. He, therefore, rehearsed what had taken place and stated frankly, that as the bill was not complete, and as he doubted the power of the province to borrow the money, he had used the discretionary power lodged in him and had not submitted the bill to the consideration of the board. As to what Mr. Shirley had said in his speech, the governor was mistaken, and Bollan believed he never did receive such information as he mentioned, but might have been induced to go so far as he did in order to strengthen and give credit to the proposals and thereby engage persons (disinclined) to come into them. Bollan then offered to submit the details of the matter to any member of the board or to any other of his Majesty's ministers who had the direction of these matters, but on the ground of policy declined to furnish them to the public, in view of the property interests concerned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the same speech in which Shirley, in order to strengthen and give credit to the proposals, was induced to make the statement which Bollan euphemistically termed a mistake, he also referred to other schemes proposed in England, many of which he said had a manifest tendency to lessen the benefits to the province of the proposed reimbursement. The accounts of these projects were to be found in the letters of one of the agents. The projects themselves had been opposed by the other agent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In January, 1747-48, Kilby had written: "'Tis notorious that the exchange between New England and London has arisen so much since the value of the province bills in sterling money was certified (in order to ascertain the province account of expense), that two-thirds, or nearer one-half sterling money that would have been necessary would now purchase all the bills at current exchange. . . . If this government should pay off the whole demands of the province according to the exchange as fixed by the account upon no other condition than that the bills shall be paid off immediately at that rate, it would be giving the last possessors a most unreasonable advantage in obtaining payment for bills under £600 per cent, which were undoubtedly taken into hand at or about £1,000 per cent., and with this inconvenience to debtors that they will have to pay two-fifths more than the preceding year. . . . All the advantage gained by their means will centre in those who have had address enough to obtain possession of the bills in virtue of some secret scheme calculated for such purposes, and many people here believe in such a scheme." [312]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The inference seems to be a fair one that Kilby so far back as that date favored the views expressed by the merchants of London in their petition in September, and it hardly needed Bollan's direct assertion to that effect made in his letter of September 7th, already quoted, to convince us that this was so. It is evident that whatever justice there might be in his views, a postponement of the payment and a re-submission of the matter to parliament, would have been full of danger. Action had already been taken in a liberal spirit, and it was plainly the duty of the agents of the province to press for payment. Hutchinson says: "Some of the ministry thought it sufficient to grant such sum as would redeem the bills issued for the expedition, etc., at their depreciated value, and Mr. Kilby, the other agent, seemed to despair of obtaining more, but Mr. Bollan, who had an intimate knowledge of our public affairs, set the injustice of this proposal in a clear light and made it evident that the depreciation of the bills was as effectually a charge borne by the people as if the same proportion of bills had been drawn inby taxes, andrefused all proposals of accommodation, insisting upon the full value of the bills when issued. He certainly had great merit for this and for other services." [313]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This was no time for the province to be represented by a faint hearted agent. Such an one was more of a hindrance than a help. Still less was it desirable that the affairs should be pressed by two agents who entertained different views. Harmony and co-operation were essential for success. The assembly recognized this, and as the complications of the situation were made plain through the correspondence of the agents, they dismissed Kilby on the 17th of November, 1748, [314] and placed the management of the affair solely in the hands of Bollan. On the 22nd a second vote was passed by the house authorizing Bollan to act in receiving the money. [315] He was empowered to give a full and ample discharge to the Lords Commissioners for the sum granted by parliament upon the deposit of the money in the Bank of England to the credit of the province.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Simultaneously a petition of the governor, council and house of representatives was sent to the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury in which it was asserted that by vote of March 5, Bollan had been authorized to receive the money, but in consequence of this action having been taken before the grant was made by parliament doubts had arisen as to the legality of his authority. In order to remove these doubts it was proposed that the money should be deposited in the Bank of England, subject to the order of the province, and that being done Bollan was to give a discharge for the money so lodged. To induce their lordships to act promptly it was stated that the money so obtained was to be applied to the sinking and redemption of the bills of public credit. [316]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the 23rd of November, 1748, it was voted to postpone the consideration of what was further necessary to be done for redeeming and exchanging the bills of credit, and bringing to a period the paper currency of the province and for applying to those purposes in the best manner the grant made by parliament, until the next sitting of the court, at the opening of which all the members of the court were required to give their attendance. [317]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the 22nd of December, Shirley informed the assembly that the session which was then opened was for the purpose of considering the currency. The proposals, he said, which were made to the neighboring governments, to join with the province in consulting upon this important affair, and the appointment of a meeting of commissioners for that end, had made this short delay necessary, but there being now no prospect of any assistance from them, no time should be lost. If an act for retiring the currency should be passed, all obstacles to receiving the money would be removed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For the next few days, the time of the assembly was largely taken up with the consideration of the act for drawing in the bills of credit of the several denominations, etc., etc. On the 6th of January, 1748-49, the representatives rejected the bill then under consideration and in the afternoon of the same day voted that "the house will at this sitting come unto some method to apply the sum granted by parliament towards the redemption of the paper currency and to substitute a silver medium in lieu thereof" In pursuance of this purpose a joint committee was ordered on the subject. On the 10th an act for drawing in the bills of credit was reported and on the 17th it was ordered to be engrossed. On the 20th the house passed an order that this act should be forthwith printed and a copy delivered to each member of this court. A copy was also to be sent to the selectmen of each town of the province, who were to be required to lay the same before their respective towns at the anniversary meeting in March for their opinions thereon, if they should see cause. They were to give notice thereof in their warrants for such meetings, and to make return to this court at their sitting next thereafter. While the council could neither force the house to immediate action nor prevent them from temporizing if they saw fit to adopt that line of action, they could refuse to approve of this absurd proposition to submit the scheme for the application of the funds to be derived from the reimbursement, to the discussion of all the town meetings in the province, and could not be compelled to admit to the subsequent consideration of the court the various opinions that might be reached upon the subject. The board, therefore, declined to concur in the order to print the act for this purpose. The house then considered the question whether they could proceed in this matter alone. They voted first that they could not with propriety come into a resolution to print the bill without the concurrence of the board. Having determined that it would be improper for them to print the bill independently from the board, they then voted not to do it at all; after which the question was submitted whether the bill should be printed and a copy delivered to each member of the court and one to every town in the province. In view of the vote previously passed the conclusion of the house to print the bill would have required the approval of the council. Inasmuch, however, as the final determination was not to do it, this point is not of consequence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the 25th of January, 1748-49, the question was put whether the house would reconsider the vote of the day before respecting the enactment of the engrossed bill and then proceed to consider the bill. This was resolved in the affirmative and the bill was then passed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This review of the proceedings in the house at this critical time, when so much depended upon their action, shows, that up to the last moment, the paper money men were in the ascendancy. They were in favor of a gradual reduction of the bills, and if in the schemes of the temporizers, due consideration had been made for the protection of the debtor class, the perilous position would have been accepted of dallying with the situation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hutchinson, who introduced the bill which was passed at this time, thus describes the events connected with its passage and the fortunate turn which affairs took, bringing success within his reach : "Some of the directors and principal promoters of the land bank scheme, [318] being at this time members of the General Court, unexpectedly joined with the party who were for finishing paper money, but the opposition was so great that after many weeks spent in debating and settling the several parts of the bill, and a whole day's debate at last in a committee of the whole house upon the expediency of passing the bill, as thus settled, it was rejected, and the report of the committee accepted. . . . However, the next morning two of the members of the house, [319] zealous adherents of this party (the country party, which was in favor of paper), and who had been strong opposers of the bill, came early to the house to wait the coming of the speaker [Hutchinson], and in the lobby let him know that, although they were not satisfied with several parts of the bill, yet they were alarmed with the danger to the province from the schemes of those persons who were for a gradual reduction of the bills, and by that means for raising the value of the currency without any provision for the relief of debtors, and, therefore, they had changed their minds, and if the bill could be brought forward again they would give their voice for it, and others who opposed it would do the same. . . . As soon as the house met, upon a motion by one of these members, seconded by the other, the bill was again brought under consideration, and passed the house as it afterwards did the council, and had the governor's consent."

      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XII. THE MONEY PAID AND SPECIE PAYMENTS RESUMED.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While the "act for drawing in the bills of credit of the several denominations which have at any time been issued by this government and are still outstanding, and for ascertaining the rate of coined silver in this province for the future" was under consideration, a number of influential Boston merchants [321] submitted a petition to the assembly in which they set forth that the subject was one in which every individual was most nearly interested. Although not insensible to the wisdom and integrity of the General Assembly, yet they prayed that any bill relating to this important affair might be submitted to the public, before it should be enacted. Such was the custom of the parliament of Great Britain they apprehended in cases of like moment. The presentation of this petition aroused the friends of the bill who filed a counter petition, on the 23rd of January, 1748-49. [322] They had heard with satisfaction of the progress of the bill, and with concern that suggestions had been made by a body of merchants of Boston, that it might prove pernicious. Notwithstanding the fact that the rate of redemption which was proposed would prove less advantageous to the merchants of Boston than to any other part of the community, yet as they apprehended, the said rate would be greatly for the ease of the major part of the people. They agreed to use their endeavors that the good design of the bill might be answered. The act was actually passed three days after this, and before it was known what course was to be taken as to the payment of the money to the province, one motive for its passage being indeed, to facilitate the same by committing the province to a course of action which would meet with the approval of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury. It was. therefore, conditional in character and future in its action. Sir Peter Warren, William Bollan, and Eliakim Palmer of London, were appointed to receive the money and to give a full discharge for the same. They were also authorized to petition his Majesty to transmit the sum in foreign coined silver, in a government ship, to the province. On arrival the treasurer was empowered to receive the same. For one year after March 31, 1750, the treasurer was to redeem outstanding bills in silver at the following rates for every forty-five shillings in old tenor bills, one piece of eight; for every eleven shillings and three pence in middle tenor and new tenor bills, one piece of eight, and so proportionably for larger or smaller sums. All rights of redemption were to cease after March 31, 1751. All contracts after March 31, 1750 were to be understood to be payable in coined silver, and executions on judgments upon existing debts contracted in public bills could be satisfied in coin upon the same terms as those prescribed for the redemptions. [323]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The sum granted by parliament £183,649, 2s. 7 1/2d. sterling was equal to about £244,866 "lawful money" of Massachusetts. The current rate of silver was about 60s. and it had been proposed to effect the redemptions at the rate of 55s. per ounce. It was found desirable, however, to adopt a compromise rate of 50s. or seven and one-half in bills for one in silver. [324] At this rate the £244,866 to be derived from the reimbursement would provide for £1,836,495 of the public bills reduced to old tenor rates, no thought being had of the possible cost of laying the money down in Boston. It was estimated that after this amount had been applied for redemptions there would still remain in circulation about £300,000 more rated in old tenor. A tax was, therefore, laid in this act, in terms of new and middle tenor bills for £75,000. [325] In case the General Court should fail to apportion this tax the treasurer was directed to issue his warrants to the selectmen or assessors, basing the same upon the next preceding assessment. These proceedings, if they should take effect, would render unnecessary the provisions which had been made in the several acts of emission for the future redemption of the bills and these provisions were, therefore, made void.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The act then went on to declare that after March 31, 1750, all contracts and debts were to be paid in silver at six shillings and eight pence an ounce, and after that date all persons were forbidden under severe penalties to account, receive take or pay any bill or bills of credit of either of the neighboring governments, a proviso being added that if these governments should take steps to sink their bills, then the clauses of the act forbidding their circulation should become void. If the sum granted by parliament should not reach the province before March 31, 1750, then the legislation formerly passed for drawing in the bills was to be revived and the special provisions of this act for their redemption were to become void.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For four years after March 31, 1750, no person elected to office could enter upon the performance of his official duties until he had made oath that he had not since March 31, 1750, wittingly and willingly, directly or indirectly, either by himself or by any for or under him, been concerned in receiving or paying within this government, any of the bills of the neighboring governments. [326] On the passage of this bill a letter to the neighboring governments was prepared, and the same was adopted on the 28th of January, 1748-49. [327]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A copy of the bill accompanied the letter when it was forwarded, and the respective governments were notified that since the effort to secure co-operation had failed, this province had determined not to let slip so favorable an opportunity for drawing in its own bills. In doing this it was impossible to avoid prohibiting the circulation in this province of the bills of credit of other governments, past experience having shown that it was impracticable to keep a silver currency while paper money was in circulation. Hopes were expressed that the other governments might still see their way to taking steps toward the adoption of a silver currency, in which case this province stood ready to do everything reasonable to cultivate a good agreement with its neighbors in pursuing a general design of so great importance. In speaking of the prohibition of the circulation of the bills of the neighboring governments, reluctance was expressed at the necessity for this step, especially with reference to those of Connecticut. An address to his Majesty was adopted at the same time expressing thanks for the reimbursement and petitioning for the free transportation of the money in a government ship. [328] A new attempt was made January 20, 1748-49, to secure the submission of the act to the towns which resulted in a failure, [329] but an order that the act should be separately printed and a copy be furnished to each member of the assembly and to each town was duly passed February 1st, 1748-49. [330]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the 31st of January, 1748-49, Shirley had certified a copy of the act which the assembly had passed for drawing in the bills of credit and this was forwarded to Bollan and by him was delivered to the clerk of the Privy Council. On the 16th of March it was referred to the Board of Trade and by that body was submitted on the 18th of April to Matthew Lamb for his opinion. Lamb made no objection to the act in point of law and on the 11th of May, 1749, the Board of Trade reported to the council that they thought it advisable that the act should be laid before his Majesty for confirmation. The confirmation was finally accomplished on the 28th of June, 1749. [331]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the 15th of June, 1749, Bollan announced that he had received an order for the money, and on the 30th he added that the same had been paid over on the 16th of June, with a reduction of the fees to 1d. in the pound. [332] Three persons had been appointed to receive the reimbursement on behalf of the province, Sir Peter Warren. William Bollan and Eliakim Palmer, and, to meet the objections raised by the attorney general, this appointment had been duly authorized by the assembly under a law of the province. [333] In case of the death or disability of either Warren or Palmer, Bollan and the other were authorized to act. Bollan, if alive, was to be one of the two who should act, in any event. The contingency which this clause was meant to cover actually arose. Palmer died before the money was delivered and Warren and Bollan received it. The transfer to them was made by a draft upon the Bank of England. The agents purchased with it Spanish silver and English copper coin. Including the expense of marine insurance and sacking and boxing the coin, their purchases came to £179,260, 3 s . 2 d . [334] The remainder of the amount allowed for the reimbursement was absorbed by fees and commissions. The fee at the exchequer took £765, 18 s . 1 d . The owners of the "Molyneaux", a vessel chartered for some purpose by the agents, were allowed £802, 19 s . 9 d , and this was reserved by the agents and paid to them. [335] On shipments of this character on government vessels, it was customary to allow the captain a liberal gratuity. They thought it would be unwise to oppose a well established custom in this respect and, therefore, had not pressed the government for an absolutely free passage for the shipment. Besides, the Lords of the Treasury were well aware that the silver rate in this adjustment was favorable for the province, and the opening of this question might have had its dangers. Mr. Bollan, with Sir Peter's approval, agreed to give Captain Montague, of the government ship "Mermaid," a present of £1500, which they said was short of one per cent., in consideration of freight as expressed in his bills of lading. [336]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A commission of £2,710, 16 s . 10 d . was charged by Warren and Bollan. The object of this was to furnish Bollan with funds. He had incurred many expenses, and had proposed to Sir Peter Warren to withhold a portion of the money on that account. To this Sir Peter would not assent, but he suggested that they could with propriety charge a commission. Personally he did not wish any remuneration for his services, and after making certain payments out of his share of the commission amounting to £455, 8 s . 4 d . by way of gratuities to persons he had made use of, he held the balance, £900, subject to the draft of the province. [337] Bollan stated that he held the whole of his commission subject to the disposal of the province, leaving the question of remuneration to be settled by the assembly. [338] He had taken the money, as it was the only method to which Sir Peter Warren would agree for reserving any of it, and he had need of money to meet liabilities already incurred and for province expenses. There remained in Bollan's hands a balance not used amounting to £109, 4 s . 9 1/2 d ., with which he personally stood charged.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Bank of England at first demanded 5 s . 6 d . for silver, and afterward reduced the price to 5s. 5d. At that time the Bank was paying 5 s . 3 1/2 d . for silver. The fact that the province was known to be in the market as purchaser of so large an amount of coin affected the price of silver, but Warren and Bollan thought it was best to go ahead and secure the total amount. The market as a general thing was about a farthing an ounce above the purchasing rate made by the bank. They secured 110,000 ounces, a promiscuous lot of milled and pillared coins at 5 s . 3 3/4 d ., and later they purchased at 5 s . 4 d . a shipment from Spain of 300,000 milled pieces 8 / 8 which came in one remittance. The bank then lowered its rate and let them have £65,000 sterling in milled silver at 5 s . 4 d . A few more purchases made up the 650,000 ounces. There were some exchanges of hammered for milled money for which allowances had to be made. [339]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The silver was first sacked and then boxed. Copper coin was procured from the mint and boxed. The whole was then transferred to Portsmouth under the escort of the horse guards and then shipped on the "Molyneaux." [340] The exact form of the shipment was as follows:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">    Ounces 1-206 Chests, each 3,000 oz. milled pcs of 8/8 in bags, . . . . 618,000 207-214 Chests, each 3,000 oz. pillared pcs. of 8/8 in bags, . . . 24,000 215 halves, ditto 3,000 216 1000 oz. halves, 876 3/4 " mixed, 281 1/4 " milled, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 423 1/2 " " half, 418 1/2 " " small, 3,000 217 containing milled 2,000     —     650,000</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This was purchased at prices ranging from 5 s . 3 1/4 d . to 5 s . 4 d ., and the whole cost amounted to £173,129, 5 s . 11 3/4 d . The copper coin was purchased by the ton, and was packed in 100 cases.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">The net cost of the money was therefore £175,240 10 s . 7 3/4 d . They effected marine insurance for £175,000, at 2 per cent. to pay 98 in case of loss, the expense of which was included in their former statement of total cost. The expenses of the shipment in addition to marine insurance, sacking and boxing were, therefore, £4,019 12 s . 6 1/4 d ., and the net amount received in coin in the province, £175,240 and a fraction, sterling, was equivalent to £233,634 New England money. The expenditure may be tabulated as follows: [341]</field>

      <field name="fulltext">At the rate of conversion into old tenor which was fixed in Hutchinson's bill, the coin imported would redeem only £1,752,405 in bills of public credit. The original act had been based upon the theory that the whole grant could thus be applied and it was conceived that the impossibility of thus applying the entire sum in consequence of the reductions made for fees and expenses might render the act void and of no effect. Legislation was, therefore, secured at a later date to cure this supposed defect. [342]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Under the act for drawing in the bills of credit it was made the duty of the treasurer of the province, in case the General Court failed to pass an act apportioning the tax for £75,000 in bills of the middle and last tenor before the 20 th of June, 1749, to send his warrants to the tax collectors of the several towns, basing his apportionment on the last preceding tax. when this date arrived, the money had been in Bollan's hands only four days, and of course, the assembly had no knowledge of this payment. They, therefore, took no action in the premises. The law was, however, imperative, so far as the treasurer was concerned, and he proceeded to carry it out as best he could. It happened that he made a mistake in his apportionment, which he afterwards discovered. He, therefore, sent a corrected apportionment to the collectors, and the assembly on the 14 th of December ratified this correction of the assessment. [343]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In September, 1749, the people of Boston, to quote from Palfrey, "little used to the sight of money, saw seventeen trucks dragged up King Street to the treasury offices, laden with two hundred and seventeen chests full of Spanish dollars, and ten trucks bearing a hundred casks of coined copper." In November, Lieutenant-Governor Phips said to the assembly, "I congratulate you, gentlemen, upon the favor of Divine Providence in the safe arrival of the money allowed by the parliament of Great Britain, for our expense in reducing Cape Breton, whereby we are enabled in great measure to pay off the great debt contracted by the charge of the late war and now lying upon this province." [344] Bollan, who had come over with the money, was summoned before the court to tell his story, and, on the 15th of December, it was "unanimously resolved that it appears to this court that the said William Bollan has discharged the trusts reposed in him with great zeal and faithfulness."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Six months intervened between the time of the arrival of the money and the date set for the redemption of the bills of public credit. As the time approached there was evident doubt as to whether the coined silver, and especially the small change, would remain in circulation. In any event, it was thought that there was not enough small currency, and the assembly appointed a committee to prepare a bill for restraining the currency of half pence, farthings and coined silver at a higher rate than in the proportion of the milled dollar to 6 s . This committee recommended that small bills of the following denominations should be printed: One-quarter of a dollar, equal to eighteen pence lawful money of Massachusetts Bay; one-eighth of a dollar or nine pence; one-twelfth of a dollar or six pence; one-sixteenth of a dollar or four pence half penny; one-twenty-fourth of a dollar or three pence; and one-seventy-second of a dollar or one penny. The total amount to be struck off was not to exceed three thousand pounds lawful money, and the treasurer was to hold as a fund for the redemption of this fractional currency three thousand milled dollars. [345] On the 27th of January, 1749-50, persons were designated to sign this fractional currency. [346] Those of us who remember the Spanish coinage which circulated so freely in this country before the rebellion, will recognize the titles of the nine pence and four pence ha'pennies which the eighths and sixteenths of a dollar retained down to that time throughout this part of the country. The entire amount of this fractional currency was prepared for emission, but Hutchinson says that "a small part only was issued," "scarcely any person would receive them in payment, choosing rather a base coin imported from Spain called pistorines, at 20 per cent. more than the intrinsic value." [347]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Apprehension was felt that silver might still be held at a premium, [348] even after the province was furnished with a metallic currency, and efforts were made to prevent by legislation what was termed in the preamble of the act passed for that purpose, a great inconvenience, but what would really have been a great menace to the prosperity of the province. It was provided in this act that it should not be lawful after March 31, 1750, to receive or pass any of the following coins at higher rates than those fixed by the act, namely : a guinea, at 28 s . an English crown at 6 s . 8 d .; a half crown at 3 s . 4 d&gt; . ; an English shilling at 1 s . 4 d .; an English sixpence at 8 d . a double Johannes, or gold coin of Portugal of the value of three pounds twelve shillings, sterling, at £4 16 s . ; a single Johannes of the value of thirty-six shillings, sterling, at 48 s .; a moidore at 36 s . ; a pistole of full weight at 22 s . ; three English farthings for one penny, and English half pence in the same proportion. Penalties were provided for violation of the act. [349]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"In order to dispense the silver" as the council phrased it, they voted on the 31st of March, 1750, that on the 2nd and 3rd of April, not more than fifty dollars in value should be paid to any one person and in every payment there should be included a certain proportion of copper money and of hammered dollars. [350] The house would not agree to this, the limitation of the amount of payment being evidently the basis of their objections, since the instructions as to forcing out the copper and the hammered money were accepted by them in another resolve. A scheme was also proposed for the purpose of preventing inhabitants of the neighboring governments from presenting bills for redemption either in person or by proxy. Inhabitants of this province were permitted to deposit bills of the neighboring governments, then in their possession, with the treasurer. In presenting bills of this province for redemption the inhabitants of this province were to make oath that the bills were their own property. If it was discovered that any were presented for redemption which actually belonged to inhabitants of the neighboring governments, they were to be redeemed in bills of the respective governments, lodged as above for this purpose by the inhabitants of this province, -credit being duly given to those who had thus lodged bills of these governments. [351]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the same day a committee of six was appointed to sit daily until further orders for the purpose of receiving the bills presented for exchange for silver and for receiving bills of the neighboring governments presented by inhabitants of this province, to be held for exchange for bills of this government, in case any should be sequestered as the property of inhabitants of the neighboring governments and held for exchange as above. Every precaution was taken to prevent the silver from passing into the hands of residents of Rhode Island, Connecticut and New Hampshire. The suggestions as to requiring each person to take a proportionate share of copper and hammered money were incorporated in the definition of the duties of this committee, and they were also to be at liberty to pay unto any person (that might desire the same) three pence in every twenty shillings that might be exchanged, in the bills that were proposed to be emitted for small change. Large powers were conferred upon the committee to examine depositaries under oath as to the ownership of the bills, in order that the benefit of the act might be secured exclusively to residents of the province. [352] The time within which possessors of bills could present them for redemption under the original act for drawing in the bills of credit expired March 31, 1751, but apparently the committee appointed under this resolve was still in session on the 26th of April, 1751, for it was then ordered to close its labors on the third day of June of that year. [353] An examination of the situation of affairs will show that it was impossible for the province to have enforced the clause limiting the period of redemptions to one year.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Attention has already been called to the fact that the original scheme for the redemption of the bills was based upon the theory that the total amount of the grant of parliament would he received by the province. The amount absorbed by the expenses attendant upon collecting and remitting the money created a deficit in the means appropriated for the redemptions for which legislation had not as yet made provision. The province was unable to redeem its promises and the assembly frankly recognized the situation. They said that there was not silver in the treasury sufficient to redeem the bills and possessors would be injured unless relieved by the government. It was admitted that the paper currency of the province could not "be brought to a period" by the time proposed. In view of the fact that the designated time, at any rate as fixed by the original act of redemption, was already in the past, this admission was, perhaps, unnecessary. In order to meet the emergency which had arisen it was provided that possessors of bills who should bring them in by the third of June, 1751, were to be paid one-eighth in coin and seven-eighths in a certificate, which was to have added to it a premium of one per cent, and to carry interest at six per cent, from March 31, 1751. Apparently this method had been devised by the committee having in charge the redemption of the bills, for it was ordered that not only the certificates issued under this act but also those issued by the committee prior to March 31, 1751, should be redeemed in silver by December 31, 1751. The committee was to act as an intermediary between the possessors of bills and the treasury. Upon surrender of bills they were to issue orders on the treasurer for the eighth in coin and the seven-eighths in the form of a certificate. Special provisions were made as to the reception of these certificates by collectors of taxes and also as to their redemption. [354]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This act went through a process of evolution before reaching the shape in which it now stands upon the statute books, [355] and the records show that, except for the rigid adherence of certain individuals to principle, the assembly would even at this stage of the game have practically resumed the old practice of issuing a legal tender paper currency.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There is on file a protest of Andrew Oliver and Thomas Hutchinson against the proposed legislation of April 4, 1751, which sets forth the following objections to the act: 1st, because it fixes another means of discharging debts, a legal tender of uncertain value; 2nd, if the certificates are as good as money, it will be unnecessary to compel people to take them. If they are not as good it is unjust to do so; 3rd, a presumption on the part of the government that the value of the certificate is not equal to silver will tend to drive that metal out of circulation; 4th, no currency ought to bear interest. The established medium or instrument of trade ought to be certainly known, fixed and invariable. [356]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The bill as it originally passed the house was defeated in the council. On the second effort it got through both houses, and it was at this stage that Oliver and Hutchinson protested. The lieutenant-governor refused his consent to this bill, influenced, perhaps, by this very petition, giving as reasons therefor that the certificates were made a tender in law in discharge of all private debts and contracts whatsoever, thus repealing or enervating the act to, which this was called an addition, in one of its most material parts, and that he was further of the opinion that it would prove fatal to the country. In the modified form above described in which it afterwards passed, the act met with his approval. [357]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This was the last legislation on the statute books connected with the redemption of the bills. The province had already established a credit upon which it could secure loans. In June, 1750, the treasurer had been authorized to borrow five thousand pounds in Spanish milled dollars, on his notes payable with six per cent. interest in June, 1752. [358] Hutchinson says, "Few people were at first inclined to lend to the province though they were assured of payment in a short time with interest. The treasurer, therefore, was ordered to make payment to the creditors of the government in promissory notes, payable to bearer in silver in two or three years, with lawful interest. This was really better than any private security; but the people, who had seen so much of the bad effects of their former paper money, from its depreciation, could not consider this as without danger, and the notes were sold for silver at discount, which continued until it was found that the promise made by government was punctually performed." [359]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It will be noticed that Hutchinson dwells upon the fact that the notes issued by the treasurer were payable in silver. His statement was based upon the custom which prevailed during the period which he was discussing, but it happens that in the first attempt made by the province to provide itself with funds through loans, this precaution was omitted. There is nothing in the form of note to be issued by the treasurer which required its payment in silver. Doubtless, the custom of inserting this clause arose from the difficulties then experienced in negotiating the notes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Although the change from paper money to a metallic currency was welcomed by the mass of the people, the advocates of the former, especially in the country, where the land bank had been strong, were still inclined to battle for their supposed rights and were even disposed to use force if necessary to maintain them. [360] Hutchinson says, "the prejudice in the town of Boston was so much abated, that when a large number of people from Abington, and other towns near it, came to Boston expecting to be joined by the like people there, they were hooted at and insulted by the boys and servants, and obliged to return home disappointed." [361] These demonstrations were, however, of sufficient importance for the assembly to pass a special act for preventing and suppressing of riots, routs and unlawful assemblies. [362]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We have the authority of Hutchinson for the statement that the shock to trade which was apprehended from the resumption of specie payments was not felt. A good currency was insensibly substituted for a bad one, and every branch of business was carried on to a better advantage than before. On the other hand, the depressing influence of the paper currency continued to exert a disastrous result upon the business of the colonies which had not resumed specie payments from which at the time when Hutchinson wrote they had not recovered. [363]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the 25th of June, 1751, his Majesty gave his royal assent to an act to regulate and restrain paper bills of credit in his Majesty's colonies or plantations of Rhode Island, and Providence plantations, Connecticut, The Massachusetts Bay and New Hampshire in America; and to prevent the same being legal tenders in payments of money. [364]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By this act it was not lawful after September 29, 1751, for the governor of any of these colonies or plantations to assent to any new emissions, or to reissues of those then in circulation, or to the postponement of the time for calling in the bills then in circulation; nor to give his assent to any act whereby the bills should in any manner be depreciated. All bills in circulation were to be called in according to the terms of the existing laws providing for their retirement. An exception to the restraining clause as to emissions provided that bills might be issued for current expenses, but must be retired within two years from the date of emission. Reasonable sums might be emitted in time of war for emergent expenses. There was specific legislation through which an attempt was made to cover delinquencies on the part of borrowers of these bills, and to prevent such delinquencies from affecting the question of the retirement of the bills. It was provided that after September 29, 1751, there should be no legal tenders. A penalty was prescribed for disobedience on the part of any of the governors. [365]</field>

Bearing in mind Shirley's reports of the absolute inefficiency of all previous legislation against the circulation within the province of these bills, they concluded that they would not disapprove of the act, on account of their objections to this section. At a later date, when the time came for the enforcement of this law, it practically prevented the organization of a board of selectmen in any of the border towns, especially along the Rhode Island line, where many of the towns depended for a living upon trade with their neighbors over the border.

      <field name="fulltext">[360] In 1750, one of the humorists of the day published a ballad with the following title A mournful lamentation for the sad and deplorable death of Mr. Old Tenor, a native of New England, who after a long confinement by a deep and mortal wound which he received above twelve months before, expired on the 31st day of March, 1750. Two verses from the ballad will give an idea of its general character. Then, good Old Tenor, fare thee well, Since thou art dead and gone; We mourn thy fate, e'en while we tell The good things thou hast done. Since the bright beams of yonder sun Did on New England shine, In all the land, there ne'er was known A death so mourned as thine. Of every rank are many seen, Thy downfall to deplore; For 'tis well known that thou hast been A friend to rich and poor. We'll o'er thee raise a silver tomb, Long may that tomb remain To bless our eyes for years to come, But wishes, ah! are vain. Proceedings Mass. Hist. Soc., vol. 20, pp. 30-32.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XIII. PARLIAMENT AND BILLS OF PUBLIC CREDIT IN THE COLONIES.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There are certain circumstances connected with the passage of the act to regulate and restrain paper bills of credit, etc., which would compel its consideration in any event, and its mention at the close of the previous chapter affords an opportunity for an examination of the attitude of parliament towards the bills of credit during the time that they were being issued in the colonies. For some reason or other, the House of Commons took the matter up in 1739, and on the 13th of June, petitioned his Majesty to cause to be prepared for the next session, a statement of the rates per ounce at which gold and silver coin were bought and sold in the colonies and plantations in America in the years 1700, 1710, 1720, 1730, and the current rates of these metals at the time of the petition or address. They called for an account of the paper bills, or bills of credit, which by virtue of any act or acts of assembly subsisted or passed in payment in any of the British colonies or plantations in the year 1700, together with a statement of those which had been issued since that time, their value in British money at the date of issue and at the time of the address. They also called for the provisions which had been made for the bills being sunk or discharged, and an account of those which had already been sunk or discharged. [366]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the 28th of March, 1740, returns were made covering these points as to New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, the counties of Newcastle, Kent and Sussex on Delaware; Maryland, and a number of the island colonies. The return from Massachusetts consisted of an account of the bills of credit made and issued by the province for the support of the government from the year 1700 to the year 1738, and of the provision made on their emission for sinking and discharging such bills, by taxes upon polls and estates, and the duties of impost and excise. Also an account of the province bills, made by order of the General Court, and delivered to the treasurer of the province, for which he also gave credit in the several years set against the sums; together with an account of what bills had been burnt, with the times when, and the price of silver and exchange. [367]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the 10th of April, the Commons called for the instructions which had been issued concerning the observance of the act for ascertaining the value of foreign coin in America, also for the instructions which had been issued to governors not to give their assent to acts of assembly for the striking and issuing paper bills of credit in lieu of money, and likewise those instructions relating to the passing of bills, whereby the trade or navigation of the kingdom might be any ways affected. [368]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the 15th of April, in addition to the returns already received relative to the bills of public credit of the colonies, "An account of the rise and progress of the paper bills of credit of South Carolina" was presented. [369] Copies of the instructions called for were also reported and in addition to the general instructions, sent to all the governors, particular instructions and additional instructions to the governors of Massachusetts and New Hampshire were sent in. To these were added particular instructions to the governor of South Carolina in 1730, and particular instructions to the then governor of that colony. [370]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the 25th of the same month, Francis Wilks and Christopher Kilby, agents for the province of Massachusetts Bay, becoming alarmed at the investigations which parliament was making, petitioned for a hearing. They stated that when Belcher assumed the government of the province he found the revenue charged with the redemption of public bills, each year from 1730 to 1741, to the extent of between £16,000 and £17,000. These bills had been issued to meet the exigencies of the government caused by the long and distressing war with the Indians. The redemption of all bills issued since Belcher's accession had been laid on the years preceding 1742, so that there was to be drawn in, each year, in 1739, in 1740, and in 1741, £68,000. Beside this there was outstanding £45,000 in loans to be drawn in speedily with interest. They conceived it to be their duty to call attention to the present distressed condition of the province for want of a new emission of paper currency. Great confusion would ensue unless this were permitted. [371]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This petition having been read, the request for a hearing was granted and Kilby was called in. The committee in whose charge this matter had been placed had announced on the day previous that they were prepared to report and that they had certain motions to offer. [372] These motions they now submitted. They were, 1 st , that it was the opinion of the house that the act of Queen Anne regulating the value of foreign coins in the colonies had not been observed; and 2d, that the operation of the act had been frustrated by the legal tender function of the bills of public credit, After these motions were submitted, Kilby was heard, and he then withdrew. The House of Commons then adopted the first resolution, without a dissenting voice, and with equal unanimity, they voted to request his Majesty to require the observance of the act of Queen Anne, and to issue his proclamation fixing the values at which foreign coins should circulate in the colonies.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The second resolution, after a slight verbal amendment was then unanimously adopted, and it was then resolved to address his Majesty requesting him to require the governors to observe the instructions which had been issued to them not to give assent to or pass any act whereby bills of credit should be issued in lieu of money, without a clause should be inserted in such act, declaring that the same would not take effect until it should have been approved by his Majesty. It was also voted to request his Majesty to cause the Commissioners of Trade and Plantations, to have prepared an account of the bills of credit then outstanding in the several colonies, with their then value and their value at the times when they were issued, in money of Great Britain, together with an opinion of what would be the most easy and effectual manner of sinking and discharging all such bills of credit with the least prejudice to the inhabitants of the said colonies and plantations and interruption to the commerce of the kingdom. [373]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A motion calling for memorials and papers presented by merchants and traders of London, Bristol, and Liverpool, or any other persons, relating to any act of assembly for the creating or issuing of paper money in any of the colonies since June 29, 1716, was defeated.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the 28th of April, his Majesty signified his willingness to furnish the papers called for. [374] At that point matters slumbered until the spring of 1744. On the 18th of April of that year, a petition was presented by several traders in behalf of themselves and others concerned in the provinces of America. The petitioners stated that upon representations being made to the last parliament, setting forth the evil consequences of raising the nominal value of silver and gold, the House of Commons came to several resolutions condemning the mischievous practice of altering the rates of silver and gold by issuing bills of credit. The house had likewise by addresses to his Majesty desired him to command the colonies to obey the instructions which had been issued upon that point. From time to time orders had been given by his Majesty to the governors to obey existing laws on this subject and to refrain from giving their assent to any act for further emissions of bills of public credit. The provinces had not, however, all observed these laws. Large emissions of bills of public credit had been made, whereby estates had depreciated, and the petitioners had been injured. Some legislation on the subject was necessary.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After the reading of the petition, the journals of the House of Commons in which the action was recorded which was referred to by the petitioners were also read, and it was then ordered that leave be given to bring in a bill to prevent the issuing of bills of credit in the British plantations in America to be legal tenders in payments for money. [375] There can be but little doubt that this bill would have been passed promptly, but for the warlike spirit which was stirred up about this time in New England by Shirley, which, as matters then stood, could not have accomplished any results except through the emission of bills of public credit. The matter was then dropped, probably for this reason, and remained quiescent until attention was attracted to it by the various discussions in connection with the reimbursements for the Cape Breton expedition. That this was an opportune moment for legislation of this sort, if it was ever to be put in force, was plain. It is not strange then to find the subject again before parliament in the beginning of the year 1749. It was ordered in the House of Commons, on the 16th of February, 1748-49, that leave be given to bring in a bill to regulate and restrain paper bills of credit in the British colonies and plantations in America, and to prevent the same being legal tender in payments for money, and for the better enforcing his Majesty's orders and instructions throughout the said colonies and plantations. On the third of March this bill was read twice and ordered printed. A comparison of its title with that of the bill for which permission was given to be reported in 1744 will disclose the fact that, in addition to what was comprehended in the bill then introduced, parliament proposed to legalize the royal instructions and enforce them in the colonies.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The perils of the situation aroused the representatives of the colonies then in London and one after another they petitioned parliament to be heard. These petitions were all of them granted and seven of the governments in America were at different times heard by counsel at this stage of the bill in the House of Commons. The petitions themselves are printed at length in the journals of the house. They are of widely different merit, but those filed by the agents of Connecticut and Massachusetts Bay are especially worthy of careful perusal.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Eliakim Palmer, one of those to whom power was given to receive the reimbursement in behalf of the province of the Massachusetts Bay, was the agent of the colony of Connecticut. His petition which was presented March 15th opens with a careful review of the charter and of the rights conferred thereby and then goes on to say, "That as this charter has invested the governor and company of Connecticut with the full powers of government, and as they have never yet abused any of the privileges granted by their charter, and as the most valuable of them, should this bill pass into a law, will be irretrievably torn from them, in violation of the security and sanction of the charter"; therefore he prays to be heard. On the same day Richard Partridge petitioned to be heard both as agent of Pennsylvania and as agent of Rhode Island. In the latter petition, after reviewing the history of the charter, he gave as a reason why he should be heard because "the passing the before mentioned bill may be attended with such fatal consequences to the inhabitants of the said colony, in interfering with their charter privileges which they have hitherto enjoyed." On the 22d of March, the merchants and traders in London who were concerned in Pennsylvania put in their petition to be heard in the matter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The petition of Bollan, the agent of the province of the Massachusetts Bay, was read on the 6th of April. This document contains an elaborate and strong presentation of the case of the colonies. Taken in connection with his bold and persistent efforts to secure for the province the total amount claimed for the reimbursement of the expenses of the Cape Breton expedition, it stamps him as one of the ablest, perhaps the ablest, among the patriots of the day, who were warring against the autocratic doctrine of governing the colonies through royal instructions. Bollan narrated the history of the charters of the colony and province in extenso and then proceeded to analyze the commission issued to Phips, taking that as the model on which all the others were framed. He said the governor of the province was required to execute all things in due manner that should belong to that trust, according to the several powers and authorities mentioned in the charter and in the commission, or such further powers, instructions and authorities, as he should then receive, or which should at any time thereafter be granted or appointed him under the royal sign manual and signet by order of the Privy Council in pursuance of the charter. A colony, he said, being the progeny of the state has an undoubted right to the liberties of the mother country. He showed that parliament had, in the days of Charles II, in an act for the encouragement of trade, declared that the colonies were peopled by his Majesty's subjects. Being subjects, they had, and their successors, the inhabitants of the province at the time when Bollan wrote, then had, a clear title to the benefits of common law and the liberties of Englishmen. The laws were then and ever ought to be the sole measure of their subjection and the rule of the King's government over them. This bill by the matter therein contained providing for the enforcement throughout the colonies of royal orders and instructions would practically approve all future orders of future princes, no matter how repugnant they might be to the present constitution of Great Britain, and all such orders, if the bill should become a law, would receive the sanction of parliament. Royal orders, no matter how illegal except for this bill, would through its agency, when ratified and enforced by it, themselves become laws and necessarily bind the people. The special powers and privileges which the inhabitants of the Massachusetts Bay then enjoyed through the charter, would be taken from them by the natural operation of the act if it should come to be law and they would likewise be deprived of all the liberties they then held in common with British subjects. The bill he thought to be disproportionate in parts, insufficient to cure the evils against which it was directed and liable to a construction prejudicial to the inhabitants of the province which he represented. [376]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">April seventh, South Carolina and New York petitioned to be heard by counsel in remonstrance against the passage of the act: All of these petitions were afterwards taken up, counsel for the several colonies were duly heard and evidence admitted tending to show the injurious character of the proposed bill. In further pursuance of the matter, the House of Commons on the second of May addressed his Majesty, calling for a certain petition which had been presented to the Privy Council by sundry merchants and principal inhabitants of Boston. The Commons wished this paper laid before them. On the thirtieth of the same month they again addressed his Majesty, asking him to cause to be prepared, and laid before the house at the next session of parliament, an account of the tenor and amount of the bills of public credit which had been created and issued in the British colonies and plantations in America, and which were then outstanding, distinguishing the same in each colony and plantation, and giving the respective times when such bills so outstanding were issued. They also wished the value of these bills to be stated in the money of Great Britain, both at the time when they were issued and at the time of preparing the account. The times for calling in and discharging such bills and the funds appropriated for that purpose were also to be included.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The combined efforts of the colonies made such an impression upon the House of Commons that the clauses in the bill for enforcing the royal instructions were dropped. [377] It can hardly be doubted that the convincing manner in which Bollan presented the argument that by the passage of the bill in its original shape, parliament would commit itself to the approval in advance of any instructions that might be sent, thereby giving them the force of laws, must have opened the eyes of the house to the enormity of the proposed legislation. The power of parliament to pass the law was not at the time questioned in the discussion, but the right thus to discriminate against a portion of the subjects of the realm was disputed. The spirit in which the House of Commons resigned that power and admitted the force of the bold and unflinching presentation of the case of the colonies cannot fail to attract our attention.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">About three months after Bollan's petition was read before parliament, he was on his way across the Atlantic with the money received for the reimbursement which had been shipped to Boston on the "Mermaid," by Sir Peter Warren and himself. [378] He left London fully satisfied that the clauses against which he had directed the main force of his argument were dead, but the very fact that he was about to put the Province of the Massachusetts Bay in position to resume specie payments was in itself an argument why the bill should be taken up again and enforced as to the other colonies. The mention of the name of the province in the act would count for nothing, except in case of future emergencies.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">That which was inevitable happened in 1751. On the 26th of February, 1750-51, a petition of the merchants of London trading to his Majesty's colony of Rhode Island was presented to the House of Commons. [379]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The petitioners represented that the currency of Rhode Island had depreciated in value over one-half within seven years. They said that there were then outstanding bills of the nominal value of £525,535. Notwithstanding this condition of affairs several petitions for a new bank or another emission of paper bills of public credit had been lately presented to the general assembly. [380] The most considerable inhabitants of the province had petitioned the assembly not to take this step, but in August last a vote had been passed to emit £50,000 In bills of a new tenor, to be let out as loans. These would be equal in value to £400,000 in bills of their present currency, old tenor. They were, it was said, made a legal tender in all payments whatsoever, let the stipulation of the contract be what it might. On the 12th of March, 1750-51, Bollan who had returned to London, testified that in 1742, silver was worth in Boston, in bills of credit of the old tenor, 27s. 6d. to 28s. 6d. In 1749, it was worth 60s. or thereabouts. Rhode Island bills varied but little from these rates. Barlow Trecothick testified that in 1742, exchange was £500 to £550 in Rhode Island bills of credit for £100 sterling. Alexander Grant said that the rate at the time of the hearing was £1,050 to £1,100 for £100 sterling, and that no general tax had been levied for paying off or sinking the bills of the treasury for upwards of twenty years, except one in 1744, for £10,000 currency, which was less than £1,000 sterling in 1751.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The committee resolved: first, that the rates of exchange were as shown in the testimony above given; second, that the bills had circulated promiscuously in the New England colonies, and that experience had shown that it was impracticable to prevent this except through legislation by parliament; third, that the rise in silver had defrauded creditors and had discouraged trade; fourth, that notwithstanding repeated notices from parliament, Rhode Island had in August voted to prepare a bill for the emission of £50,000 new tenor; and fifth, that to remedy this, the bills should be regulated and restrained. This report was agreed to by the House of Commons. The title which was adopted for the bill presented as a result of this has already been given.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">March 15, 1750-51, statements of the condition of the currency in New Jersey, Rhode Island, North Carolina, South Carolina, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay and New York were submitted to the house. The hearing was postponed from time to time, and other papers were produced. Bollan presented a petition for hearing on the 20th of April, 1751. He claimed that the province required credit in case of war, and that the curtailment of their power in this direction was contrary to and inconsistent with the charter rights and liberties of the province, and the well-being of the inhabitants thereof. Connecticut was heard in opposition to the bill, and New York also appeared among the remonstrants, but this time they made little impression on the House of Commons. Their arguments lacked force, and there was but little that the agents of the colonies could say, in view of the experiences which the several governments in America had undergone in connection with the issues of bills of public credit, that could command the sympathies of intelligent men, when pleas were advanced for the continuance of the rights of the colonies in this regard. The bill was passed on the 10th of June, and received the royal assent on the 25th of that month. [381]</field>

That where bills are issued on loans, care be taken that these loans shall be called in when due, and that ineffectual funds be made good.
