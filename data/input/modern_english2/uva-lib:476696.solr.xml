      <field name="fulltext">"We are proud of Kansas, the beautiful queen, And proud are we of her fields of corn; But a nobler pride than these I ween, Is our pride in her children, Kansas born!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">—Ellen P. Allerton—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">—Or adopted. In this galaxy of bright women, the State has a noble pride for every name, be its owner Kansas born or adopted, is a mightier force for good than its "walls of corn.''</field>
      <field name="heading_text">EFFIE GRAHAM.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EFFIE GRAHAM Topeka. A portrait of Effie Graham</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The last place one would expect to find romance is in arithmetic and yet—Miss Effie Graham, the head of the Department of Mathematics in the Topeka High School, has found it there and better still, in her lecture "Living Arithmetic'' she has shown others the way to find it there. Miss Graham is one of the most talented women of the state. Ex-Gov. Hoch has called her "one of the most gifted women in the state noted for its brilliant women. Her heart and life are as pure as her mind is bright.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She was born and reared in Ohio, the daughter of a family of Ohio pioneers, a descendant of a Revolutionary soldier and also, of a warrior of 1812. As a student of the Ohio Northern University and later as a post-graduate worker at the University of California, Chicago University, and Harvard Summer School, she has as she says, "graduated sometimes and has a degree but never `finished' her education.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Desiring to get the school out into the world as well as the world back to the school, she has spoken and written on "Moving Into The King Row,'' "Other Peoples' Children,'' "Spirit of the Younger Generation,'' "Vine Versus Oak,'' and "The Larger Service.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pictures Eight Hundred Children Selected,'' "Speaking of Automobiles,'' "The Unusual Thing,'' "The High Cost of Learning,'' and "Wanted—A Funeral of Algebraic Phraseology;'' also, some verse, "The Twentieth Regiment Knight'' and "Back to God's Country'' are magazine work that never came back. School Science &amp; Mathematics, a magazine to which she contributes and of which she is an associate editor, gives hers as the only woman's name on its staff of fifty editors.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her book, "The Passin' On Party,'' raises the author to the rank of a classic. To quote a critic: it is "a little like `Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch,' a little like `Uncle Tom's Cabin,' but not just like either of them. She reaches right down into human breasts and grips the heart strings.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is the busy people who find time to do things and the mother-heart of Miss Graham finds expression in her household in West Lawn, a suburb of Topeka. Among the members of her family are a niece and nephew whose High School and College education she directs.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">ESTHER M. CLARK.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ESTHER M. CLARK. Chanute. A portrait of Esther M. Clark</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Every Kansan, homesick in a foreign land, knows the call of Kansas and every Kansan book lover knows Esther Clark's "Call of Kansas.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sweeter to me than the salt sea spray, the fragrance of summer rains: Nearer my heart than these mighty hills are the wind-swept Kansas plains: Dearer the sight of a shy, wild rose by the roadside's dusty way Than all the splendor of poppy-fields ablaze in the sun of May.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Gay as the bold poinsetta is, and the burden of pepper trees, The sunflower, tawny and gold and brown, is richer, to me, than these. And rising ever above the song of the hoarse, insistent sea, The voice of the prairie, calling, calling me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Clark was born in Neosho Co., Kansas, about twelve miles southeast of Chanute, on a farm. At seven years of age, the family moved to Chanute and her school days were spent at the old Pioneer Building, where her mother went to school before her. In 1894, she graduated here, later entering the University of Kansas for work in English.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In 1906, "Verses by a Commonplace Person'' was published. "The Call of Kansas and Other Verse'' came out in 1909. This volume contained "My Dear'' and "Good Night'' which were set to music, and "Rose O' My Heart.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Rose o' my heart, to-day I send A rose or two, You love roses, Rose o' my heart, I love you.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Rose o' my heart, a rose is sweet And fresh as dew. Some have thorns, but, Rose o' my heart, None have you.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Rose o' my heart, this day wear My roses, do! For next to my heart, Rose o' my heart, I wear you.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My Dear'' was written for her baby brother, during an absence from home, and is Miss Clark's favorite.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She is in the office of the Extension Department at the University of Kansas, and has exclusive charge of club programs and does some work in package libraries.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Just now she is contributing prose to some of the newspapers and doing some splendid feature work.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">MARY VANCE HUMPHREY</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MARY VANCE HUMPHREY Junction City. A portrait of Mary Vance Humphrey</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary Vance Humphrey of Junction City, Kansas, has written a series of short stories on the property rights of women in Kansas, a subject that was and is, still, of vital importance to the women of the state. "The Legal Status of Mrs. O'Rourke'' and "King Lear in Kansas'' are two of the series.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When young in heart and experience, Mrs. Humphrey wrote a number of poems. Her work in later years has been only prose. Her novel, "The Squatter Sovereign'' is an historical romance of pioneer days, the settlement of Kansas in the fifties.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Humphrey is one of the founders of the Kansas State Social Science Club and the Woman's Kansas Day Club and the founder of the Reading Club of Junction City. She has served as President of the State Federation and as Director of the General Federation of Women's Clubs and President of the Woman's Kansas Day Club. Her work as member of the Board of Education has done much for Junction City and her interest in libraries has done equally as much for the State of Kansas.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Of her record as an official, Margaret Hill McCarter has written: "Her whole soul is in her work. She is the genuine metal, shirking nothing, cheapening nothing, and withal happy in the enjoyment of her obligation. She stands for patriotism, progress and peace. Something of the message of the shepherds heard out beyond Bethlehem that Christmas morning long ago sounds in the chords she strikes.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As the wife of the late Judge James Humphrey, she proved herself the able companion of such a worthy man.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">KATE A. APLINGTON.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">KATE A. APLINGTON Formerly of Council Grove. A portrait of Kate A. Aplington</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Kansas State Traveling Art Gallery owes its birth and much of its success to Kate A. Aplington, the author of that typical western story, "Pilgrims of the Plains.'' Since Feb., 1907, the Art Gallery has been a recognized state institution, and as its Vice-President and Superintendent and as the writer of the art lectures that accompany the work, Mrs. Aplington's broad-minded, artistic temperament and student's persistency have made the gallery truly a work of art.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At present, the Aplingtons are living at Miami, Florida, but for a quarter of a century, Council Grove, the most famous spot on the Santa Fe Trail, was their home. Special investigations and researches on the subject of the old Santa Fe Trail days and lecturers on educational and literary topics resulted from years spent in that historic place.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pilgrims of the Plains,'' which came out in Feb., 1913, is worthy of a place in the front rank of western stories. In July of this year, Grossett and Dunlap will bring it out in their "Popular Edition'' of novels.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Aplington is now working on a book on "Art-Museums of America'' and judging from the comments of prominent Museum Directors, this will be as great a success as her novel. "Florida of the Reclamation,'' a character story with scenes laid in and around Miami, Florida, is also in preparation.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">EMMA UPTON VAUGHN.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EMMA UPTON VAUGHN Kansas City. A portrait of Emma Upton Vaughn</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The author of that versatile little book of short stories, "The Lower Bureau Drawer'' is Emma Upton Vaughn, a Kansas City, Kansas teacher. These heart stories, showing keen insight of human nature—especially woman nature—deal with every day life, each one a fascinating revelation, of character and soul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Vaughn was born in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Her early life was spent in Kansas. She is a graduate of the Kansas University, and has taught in the public schools of the state. She wrote the "Bible and the Flag in the Public Schools'' and has contributed both prose and verse to the leading magazines and newspapers. Feature articles and many good essays appear over her signature. Her "Passing From Under The Partial Eclipse'' did much to give Kansas City, Kansas her recognized place commercially on the map. A novel, "The Cresap Pension,'' exposing a great pension fraud, is ready for the press.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">JESSIE WRIGHT WHITECOMB.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jessie Wright Whitcomb, a Topeka writer of juvenile books is a lawyer in active practice with her husband, Judge George H. Whitcomb and a mother of a remarkable family of five boys and one girl. The oldest son gained his A. B. in 1910 at the age of eighteen; in 1911 was appointed Rhodes scholar for Kansas; and is now a student at Oxford. His father and mother are in England at present visiting him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Whitcomb is a contributor to the magazines and in addition, has written "Odd Little Lass,'' "Freshman and Senior,'' "Majorbanks,'' "His Best Friend,'' "Pen's Venture,'' "Queer As She Could Be,'' and "Curly Head.'' She is a graduate of the University of Vermont and the Boston University Law School and was the first woman to lecture before a man's law school.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">MYRA WILLIAMS JARRELL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MYRA WILLIAMS JARRELL Topeka. A portrait of Myra Williams Jarrell</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Myra Williams Jarrell, the daughter of the late Archie L. Williams, for thirty years, the attorney for the Union Pacific Railway in Kansas, and the grand-daughter of Judge Archibald Williams, the first United States Circuit Judge of Kansas, appointed by Lincoln, comes of a literary family. All of the men and some of the women on the father's side of the family and also, on the mother's to a great extent, had literary talent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As a child, she cherished an ambition to write and when occasionally one of her letters to St. Nicholas saw publication, she felt she had crossed the Alps of her desire. Her first real story, however, was written as she rocked the cradle of her first born. The day, when she first saw her "stuff'' in print, stands out in her memory second only to the hallowed days of her personal history, her wedding day and the days upon which her children were born.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Since then, Mrs. Jarrell has contributed to almost all the high class magazines and has furnished special feature articles to newspapers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Some years ago, a small book, "Meg, of Valencia,'' was written and now, a novel, "The Hand of The Potter'' is ready for publication.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In 1894, Myra Williams and J. F. Jarrell were married. This union was blest with four children, three sons and one daughter. Mr. Jarrell is Publicity Agent of the Santa Fe. A number of years ago, he bought the Holton Signal and in trying to help her husband put some individuality into the paper, Mrs. Jarrell began a department headed "Ramblings.'' Later this was syndicated and finally issued in book form.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Last winter, a play, "The Plain Clothes Man,'' was produced by the North Brothers Stock Co., at the Majestic Theatre, Topeka. This well written play, with its novel and original characterization and its effective comedy lines, is now in the hands of two New York play brokers. Before many months, Mrs. Jarrell will be enjoying a royalty.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In preparation, are two plays, as yet nameless; also, a play in collaboration with Mr. North of the North Stock Co. With her brother, Burus L. Williams, of Kansas City, Mo., Mrs. Jarrell has written an opera, "The Mix Up in the Kingdom of Something-Like,'' which awaits only the lyrics Mr. Williams is writing and the music. An opera, "The Kingdom of Never Come True,'' also, in collaboration with Mr. Williams, is being set to music by Arthur Pryor, the bandmaster.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A serial story, "John Bishop, Farmer,'' a collaboration with Albert T. Reed, the artist, is to be published soon in the Kansas Farmer. Later, this will appear in book form. A novel, which Mrs. Jarrell believes will be her best work, is in construction and is clamoring to be written.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">ELLEN PALMER ALLERTON</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ELLEN PALMER ALLERTON Hamlin A portrait of Ellen Palmer Allerton</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ellen Palmer Allerton, the sweet and gentle poetess, beloved of Kansas, lived at Padonia, in Brown County, when she wrote her famous poem, "Wall of Corn.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She was past her prime when she came to Kansas from the Wisconsin home, the subject of many of her noble gems. As she grew older, she grew stronger in poetic strength.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Three volumes of poems have been published, "Walls of Corn and Other Poems,'' "Annabel and Other Poems,'' and "Poems of the Prairie.'' Her "Walls of Corn,'' written in 1884, famous from the first, as used as railroad immigration advertising, was translated in several languages and distributed all over Europe. This and her "Trail of Forty-nine'' are her best, although the classic beauty of "Beautiful Things'' is unsurpassed by any other American writer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Beautiful twilight, at set of sun, Beautiful goal, with race well run, Beautiful rest, with work well done.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">is a fitting close to the beautiful. useful life of the author.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Allerton was born in Centerville. New York, in 1835 and began writing verse at the age of seventeen. Much as she has written, yet writing was only a pastime. She never let it interfere with her housework. Thoroughly practical, she did all her own work, just because she loved to do it. Her flowers of which she had many, in doors and out, resulted in many noble, inspiring lines. In 1862, she was married to A. B. Allerton of Wisconsin, coming to Kansas in 1865. She was best appreciated for her social qualities and her interest in charity—that broader charity that praises the beauty and ignores the blemishes. Her last poem, "When Days Grow Dark'' is a beautiful pen picture of her sweetness and resignation in her growing blindness and her love and trust in him who had been her companion down the years.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You take the book and pour into my ear In accent sweet, the words I cannot see; I listen charmed, forget my haunting fear, And think with you as with your eyes I see. In the world's thought, so your dear voice be left, I still have part, I am not all bereft.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And if this darkness deepens, when for me The new moon bends no more her silver rim, When stars go out, and over land and sea Black midnight falls, where now is twilight dim, O, then may I be patient, sweet and mild, While your hands lead me like a little child!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She died in 1893, at Padonia, and was buried in a bed of her favorite white flowers, donated by loving friends. In the little graveyard at Hamlin, one reads "Beautiful Things'' on a modest stone at the head of her little bed.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">EMMA TANNER WOOD.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EMMA TANNER WOOD Topeka A portrait of Emma Tanner Wood</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Emma Tanner Wood (Caroline Cunningham), a Topeka woman, began newspaper work in 1872. The result of those early years' work was "Spring Showers,'' a volume of prose. After thirty years of study and experience among the defectives, she wrote "Too Fit For The Unfit,'' advocating surgery for the feeble-minded. The story of Mrs. Benton, one of the characters, led Mrs. Wood to introduce a law preventing children being sent to the poor house. This was the first law purely in the interest of children ever passed in Kansas. Later, a law preventing traveling hypnotists from using school children as subjects in public exhibitions was drawn up by Mrs. Wood and passed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Several years ago, a book on hypnotism, far in advance of the public thought, was written and is to be published this year.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Wood is seventy years young and as she says: "finds age the very sweetest part of life. It is no small satisfaction to laugh at the follies of others and know that you are past committing them. It is equally delightful to be responsible only to one's self and order one's life as one chooses. Every day is a holy day to me now and the sweetness of common things, grass, flowers, neighborly love, grand-children, and home comforts fill me with satis- faction. To think kindly of all things under the sun (but sin); to speak kindly to all; to do little kindly acts is a greater good to the world at large than we think while we are in the heat of battle.''</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CORNELIA M. STOCKTON</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A cheerful little room in the East wing of St. Margaret's Hospital, Kansas City, Kansas; an invalid chair wheeled up to a window over looking the street; and the eager, expectant face and the warm hand clasp of the occupant, Mrs. Cornelia M. Stockton, assures the visitor of a hearty welcome.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Greatly enfeebled by long illness and with impaired sight, this bright, little woman's keen interest in current events and the latest "best seller'' puts to shame the half-hearted zeal of the average woman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For four years, Mrs. Stockton has lived at St. Margaret's, depending upon the visits of friends and the memory of an eventful life to pass the days. Prominence in club work in her earlier years has brought reward. The History Club of Kansas City, Kansas, of which she was once a member, each week sends a member to read to her and these are red letter days to this brave, patient, little woman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Stockton began writing very young. When a little girl, back in the village of Walden, New York, she stole up to the pulpit of the church and wrote in her pastor's Bible:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have not seen the minister's eyes, And cannot describe his glance divine, For when he prays he shuts them up And when he preaches he shuts mine.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She was born in 1833 in Shawangunk, New York, and came to Kansas City in 1859, living in Missouri some years but most of the time in Kansas City, Kansas.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In 1892, she published a limited edition of poems, "The Shanar Dancing Girl and Other Poems.'' dedicated to Mrs. Bertha M. Honore Palmer, her ideal of the perfect type of gracious and lovely womanhood. "The Shanar Dancing Girl'' was first written for the Friends in Council, a literary club of Kansas City, Mo. It has received the encomiums of Thomas Bailey Aldrich, John J. Ingalls and others for its beauty of expression and dramatic qualities. "Invocation,'' an April idyl; "The Sea-shell;'' and "Mountain Born'' sing of the love of nature. "In the Conservatory;'' "My Summer Heart;'' and "Tired of the Storm'' hint of sorrow and unrest and longing. Then in 1886, "Compensation'' was written. "Irma's Love For The King'' is a favorite; also, " `Sold'—A Picture,'' written for her daughter, "yes, but she never came.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The Sorrowful Stone'' Mrs. Stockton considers her best.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The story without a suspicion of rhyme, And dim with the mists of the morning of Time, Is told of a goddess, who, wandering alone, Did go and sit down on the Sorrowful Stone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We find our Gethsemane somewhere, though late; The Angel of Shadows throws open the gate. We creep with our burden of pain, to atone, For all of life's ills, to the Sorrowful Stone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Above is the vault of the pitiless stars; The trees stretch their arms all blackened with scars; The gales of lost Paradise are faintly blown To where we sit down on the Sorrowful Stone.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"From a Poem `Vagaries' '' warns of * * * —the product of the age and clime, We do too much! grow old before our time,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yet—would we stray to Morning Hills again? Unlearn sad prophecies, and dream as then!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ah, no! with sense of peace the shadows creep, There droppeth on tired eyes the spell of sleep—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We left the dawn long leagues behind, and stand, Waiting and wistful in the Evening Land!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The patient Nurse of Destiny, at best, Leads us like children to the needed rest!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A ghostly wind puts out our little light, And we have bid the busy world "Good Night!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Stockton was married twice. Her first husband was the father of her two sons, one of whom, Dr. Henry M. Downs, in his practice, came often to St. Margaret's. The second marriage, as the wife of the late Judge John S. Stockton, was a very happy one. Last year, a brother the only surviving member of her family, died, leaving Mrs. Stockton the last of a family of five children. The two sons have also passed into the Great Beyond.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In her younger days, she contributed many poems and some prose to newspapers and magazines over the name of Cora M. Downs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ex-Gov. St. John appointed her one of the regents of the University of Kansas.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her beautiful poem: "In Memoriam'' to Sarah Walter Chandler Coates was her last.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `We seem like children,' she was wont to say, `Talking of what we cannot understand,' And in the dark or daylight, all the way, Holding so trustfully a Father's hand. And this was her religion, not to dwell On tenets, creeds, or doctrines, but to live On a pure faith, and striving to do well The simple duties that each hour should give.''</field>
      <field name="heading_text">MARGARET HILL McCARTER.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The most successful Kansas woman writer financially and the most prolific is Margaret Hill McCarter of Topeka. From the advent of her little book in 1901, "A Bunch of Things, Tied Up With Strings'' to the hearty reception of her latest novel every step of the way spells success.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Margaret Hill was born in Indiana and came to Kansas in 1888 to teach English in the Topeka High School. Two years later, she became the wife of Dr. William McCarter. Of this union there are two daughters, students at Baker University and the Topeka High School and a young son, his mother's literary critic.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A wife and a mother first, a Kansas woman second, and an author third is the way Mrs. McCarter rates herself. She is capable of and does do all her housework.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her love for literature she owes to her mother, who believed in higher education and taught Margaret to prize the few books that came her way.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After leaving the school room, the teacher instinct still strong within her, she argued if she could teach out of books written by others, why not out of books of her own? Then followed poems, short stories, biography, textbooks, the editing of Crane Classics, "One Hundred Kansas Women'' and miscellanies.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In 1902, "Cuddy and Other Folks'' was written and in 1903, "The Cottonwood's Story.'' This same year, "The Overflowing Waters,'' the story of the 1903 flood, and one of her best bits of heart writing paid for the school books of almost a thousand unfortunate children. "Cuddy's Baby'' appeared in 1908, followed the next year with "In Old Quivera,'' a thread of Coronado history. "The Price of The Prairies,'' three weeks after publication in the fall of 1910, became Kansas' best seller. "The Peace of The Solomon Valley'' came out in 1911 and proved a popular gift book. "The Wall of Men,'' Mrs. McCarter's 1912 offering should be one of the required books in Kansas schools. It is authentic history and the close of the story leaves every Kansan with a greater respect and love for the state and the heroic pioneers who stood as a living wall between Kansas and the slave question. 1913 gave us the "Master's Degree,'' considered by many her best work. This year we have "Winning The Wilderness.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. McCarter founded the Club Member and organized the Sorosis, serving as president seven years and two terms as president of the Topeka Federation of Women's Clubs. Baker University, at Baldwin, Kansas, gave her an honorary Master's Degree in 1909, its semi-centennial anniversary.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Bessie May Bellman and June Bellman Henthorne, her daughter, hail from Winfield. They write both prose and verse and Mrs. Henthorne was a reporter for years. Mrs. Bellman, when a girl, lived five years on a cattle ranch and to those five lonely years she credits her habit of introspection, meditation and writing. Much of her poetry and short stories are used in platform work.</field>
