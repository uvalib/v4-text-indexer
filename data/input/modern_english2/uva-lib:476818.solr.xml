      <field name="fulltext">"WHILOMVILLE STORIES BY STEPHEN CRANE" A street lined with trees by Edward B. Edwards</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IT was the fault of a small nickel-plated revolver, a most incompetent weapon, which, wherever one aimed, would fling the bullet as the devil willed, and no man, when about to use it, could tell exactly what was in store for the surrounding country. This treasure had been acquired by Jimmie Trescott after arduous bargaining with another small boy. Jimmie wended homeward, patting his hip pocket at every three paces.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Peter Washington, working in the carriage-house, looked out upon him with a shrewd eye. "Oh, Jim," he called, "wut you got in yer hind pocket?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nothin'," said Jimmie, feeling carefully under his jacket to make sure that the revolver wouldn't fall out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Peter chuckled. "S'more foolishness, I raikon. You gwine be hung one day, Jim, you keep up all dish yer nonsense."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jimmie made no reply, but went into the back garden, where he hid the revolver in a box under a lilac-bush. Then he returned to the vicinity of Peter, and began to cruise to and fro in the offing, showing all the signals of one wishing to open treaty. "Pete," he said, "how much does a box of cartridges cost?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Peter raised himself violently, holding in one hand a piece of harness, and in the other an old rag. "Ca'tridgers! Ca'tridgers! Lan'sake! wut the kid want with ca'tridgers? Knew it! Knew it! Come home er-holdin' on to his hind pocket like he got money in it. An' now he want ca'tridgers."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jimmie, after viewing with dismay the excitement caused by his question, began to move warily out of the reach of a possible hostile movement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ca'tridgers!" continued Peter, in scorn and horror. "Kid like you! No bigger'n er minute! Look yah, Jim, you done been swappin' round, an' you done got hol' of er pistol!" The charge was dramatic.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The wind was almost knocked out of Jimmie by this display of Peter's terrible miraculous power, and as he backed away his feeble denials were more convincing than a confession.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll tell yer pop!" cried Peter, in virtuous grandeur. "I'll tell yer pop!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the distance Jimmie stood appalled. He knew not what to do. The dread adult wisdom of Peter Washington had laid bare the sin, and disgrace stared at Jimmie.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was a whirl of wheels, and a high, lean trotting-mare spun Doctor Trescott's buggy toward Peter, who ran forward busily. As the doctor climbed out, Peter, holding the mare's head, began his denunciation:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Docteh, I gwine tell on Jim. He come home er-holdin' on to his hind pocket, an' proud like he won a tuhkey-raffle; an' I sure know what he been up to, an' I done challenge him, an' he nev' say he didn't."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, what do you mean?" said the doctor. "What's this, Jimmie?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boy came forward, glaring wrathfully at Peter. In fact, he suddenly was so filled with rage at Peter that he forgot all precautions. "It's about a pistol," he said, bluntly. "I've got a pistol. I swapped for it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I done tol' 'im his pop wouldn' stand no fiah-awms, an' him a kid like he is. I done tol' 'im. Lan'sake! he strut like he was a soldier! Come in yere proud, an' er-holdin' on to his hind pocket. He think he was Jesse James, I raikon. But I done tol' 'im his pop stan' no sech foolishness. First thing — blam — he shoot his haid off. No, seh, he too tinety t' come in yere er-struttin' like he jest bought Main Street. I tol' 'im. I done tol' 'im — shawp. I don' wanter be loafin' round dis yer stable if Jim he gwine go shootin' round an' shootin' round — blim — blam — blim — blam! No, seh. I retiahs. I retiahs. It's all right if er grown man got er gun, but ain't no kids come foolishin' round me with fiah-awms. No, seh. I retiahs."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, be quiet, Peter!" said the doctor. "Where is this thing, Jimmie?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boy went sulkily to the box under the lilac-bush and returned with the revolver. "Here 'tis," he said, with a glare over his shoulder at Peter. The doctor looked at the silly weapon in critical contempt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's not much of a thing, Jimmie, but I don't think you are quite old enough for it yet. I'll keep it for you in one of the drawers of my desk."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Peter Washington burst out proudly: "I done tol' 'im th' docteh wouldn' stan' no traffickin' round yere with fiah-awms. I done tol' 'im."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jimmie and his father went together into the house, and as Peter unharnessed the mare he continued his comments on the boy and the revolver. He was not cast down by the absence of hearers. In fact, he usually talked better when there was no one to listen save the horses. But now his observations bore small resemblance to his earlier and public statements. Admiration and the keen family pride of a Southern negro who has been long in one place were now in his tone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That boy! He's er devil! When he get to be er man — wow! He'll jes take an' make things whirl round yere. Raikon we'll all take er back seat when he come erlong er-raisin' Cain."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He had unharnessed the mare, and with his back bent was pushing the buggy into the carriage-house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Er pistol! An' him no bigger than er minute!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A small stone whizzed past Peter's head and clattered on the stable. He hastily dropped all occupation and struck a curious attitude. His right knee was almost up to his chin, and his arms were wreathed protectingly about his head. He had not looked in the direction from which the stone had come, but he had begun immediately to yell:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You Jim! Quit! Quit, I tell yer, Jim! Watch out! You gwine break somethin', Jim!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yah!" taunted the boy, as with the speed and ease of a light-cavalryman he manoeuvred in the distance. "Yah!" Told on me, did you! Told on me, hey! There! How do you like that?" The missiles resounded against the stable.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Watch out, Jim! You gwine break something, Jim, I tell yer! Quit yer foolishness, Jim! Ow! Watch out, boy! I — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was a crash. With diabolic ingenuity, one of Jimmie's pebbles had entered the carriage-house and had landed among a row of carriage-lamps on a shelf, creating havoc which was apparently beyond all reason of physical law. It seemed to Jimmie that the racket of falling glass could have been heard in an adjacent county.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Peter was a prophet who after persecution was suffered to recall everything to the mind of the persecutor. "There! Knew it! Knew it! Now I raikon you'll quit. Hi! jes look ut dese yer lamps! Fer lan' sake! Oh, now yer pop jes break ev'ry bone in yer body!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the doorway of the kitchen the cook appeared with a startled face. Jimmie's father and mother came suddenly out on the front veranda. "What was that noise?" called the doctor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Peter went forward to explain. "Jim he was er-heavin' rocks at me, docteh, an' erlong come one rock an' go blam inter all th' lamps an' jes skitter 'em t' bits. I declayah — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jimmie, half blinded with emotion, was nevertheless aware of a lightning glance from his father, a glance which cowed and frightened him to the ends of his toes. He heard the steady but deadly tones of his father in a fury: "Go into the house and wait until I come."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bowed in anguish, the boy moved across the lawn and up the steps. His mother was standing on the veranda still gazing toward the stable. He loitered in the faint hope that she might take some small pity on his state. But she could have heeded him no less if he had been invisible. He entered the house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When the doctor returned from his investigation of the harm done by Jimmie's hand, Mrs. Trescott looked at him anxiously, for she knew that he was concealing some volcanic impulses. "Well?" she asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It isn't the lamps," he said at first. He seated himself on the rail. "I don't know what we are going to do with that boy. It isn't so much the lamps as it is the other thing. He was throwing stones at Peter because Peter told me about the revolver. What are we going to do with him?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm sure I don't know," replied the mother. "We've tried almost everything. Of course much of it is pure animal spirits. Jimmie is not naturally vicious — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I know," interrupted the doctor, impatiently. "Do you suppose when the stones were singing about Peter's ears, he cared whether they were flung by a boy who was naturally vicious or a boy who was not? The question might interest him afterward, but at the time he was mainly occupied in dodging these effects of pure animal spirits."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't be too hard on the boy, Ned. There's lots of time yet. He's so young yet, and — I believe he gets most of his naughtiness from that wretched Dalzel boy. That Dalzel boy — well, he's simply awful!" Then, with true motherly instinct to shift blame from her own boy's shoulders, she proceeded to sketch the character of the Dalzel boy in lines that would have made that talented young vagabond stare. It was not admittedly her feeling that the doctor's attention should be diverted from the main issue and his indignation divided among the camps, but presently the doctor felt himself burn with a wrath for the Dalzel boy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why don't you keep Jimmie away from him?" he demanded. "Jimmie has no business consorting with abandoned little predestined jail-birds like him. If I catch him on the place I'll box his ears."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is simply impossible, unless we kept Jimmie shut up all the time," said Mrs. Trescott. "I can't watch him every minute of the day, and the moment my back is turned, he's off."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I should think those Dalzel people would hire somebody to bring up their child for them," said the doctor. "They don't seem to know how to do it themselves."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Presently you would have thought from the talk that one Willie Dalzel had been throwing stones at Peter Washington because Peter Washington had told Doctor Trescott that Willie Dalzel had come into possession of a revolver.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the mean time Jimmie had gone into the house to await the coming of his father. He was in rebellious mood. He had not intended to destroy the carriage-lamps. He had been merely hurling stones at a creature whose perfidy deserved such action, and the hitting of the lamps had been merely another move of the great conspirator Fate to force one Jimmie Trescott into dark and troublous ways. The boy was beginning to find the world a bitter place. He couldn't win appreciation for a single virtue; he could only achieve quick, rigorous punishment for his misdemeanors. Everything was an enemy. Now there were those silly old lamps — what were they doing up on that shelf, anyhow? It would have been just as easy for them at the time to have been in some other place. But no; there they had been, like the crowd that is passing under the wall when the mason for the first time in twenty years lets fall a brick. Furthermore, the flight of that stone had been perfectly unreasonable. It had been a sort of freak in physical law. Jimmie understood that he might have thrown stones from the same fatal spot for an hour without hurting a single lamp. He was a victim — that was it. Fate had conspired with the detail of his environment to simply hound him into a grave or into a cell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But who would understand? Who would understand? And here the boy turned his mental glance in every direction, and found nothing but what was to him the black of cruel ignorance. Very well; some day they would —</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From somewhere out in the street he heard a peculiar whistle of two notes. It was the common signal of the boys of the neighborhood, and judging from the direction of the sound, it was apparently intended to summon him. He moved immediately to one of the windows of the sitting-room. It opened upon a part of the grounds remote from the stables and cut off from the veranda by a wing. He perceived Willie Dalzel loitering in the street. Jimmie whistled the signal after having pushed up the window-sash some inches. He saw the Dalzel boy turn and "YOU JIM! QUIT! QUIT, I TELL YER!" An African-American male, caricatured, dodging unseen stones. Illustration by Peter Newell regard him, and then call several other boys. They stood in a group and gestured. These gestures plainly said: "Come out. We've got something on hand." Jimmie sadly shook his head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But they did not go away. They held a long consultation. Presently Jimmie saw the intrepid Dalzel boy climb the fence and begin to creep amongst the shrubbery, in elaborate imitation of an Indian scout. In time he arrived under Jimmie's window, and raised his face to whisper: "Come on out! We're going on a bear hunt."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A bear hunt! Of course Jimmie knew that it would not be a real bear hunt, but would be a sort of carouse of pretension and big talking and preposterous lying and valor, wherein each boy would strive to have himself called Kit Carson by the others. He was profoundly affected. However, the parental word was upon him, and he could not move. "No," he answered, "I can't! I've got to stay in."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you a prisoner?" demanded the Dalzel boy, eagerly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No-o — yes — I s'pose I am."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The other had become much excited, but he did not lose his wariness. "Don't you want to be rescued?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why — no — I dun'no'," replied Jimmie, dubiously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Willie Dalzel was indignant. "Why, of course you want to be rescued! We'll rescue you. I'll go and get my men." And thinking this a good sentence, he repeated, pompously, "I'll go and get my men." He began to crawl away, but when he was distant some ten paces he turned to say: "Keep up a stout heart. Remember that you have friends who will be faithful unto death. The time is not now far off when you will again view the blessed sunlight."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The poetry of these remarks filled Jimmie with ecstasy, and he watched eagerly for the coming of the friends who would be faithful unto death. They delayed some time, for the reason that Willie Dalzel was making a speech.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now, men," he said, "our comrade is a prisoner in yon — in yond — in that there fortress. We must to the rescue. Who volunteers to go with me?" He fixed them with a stern eye.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was a silence and then one of the smaller boys remarked,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If Doc Trescott ketches us trackin' over his lawn — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Willie Dalzel pounced upon the speaker and took him by the throat. The two presented a sort of a burlesque of the wood-cut on the cover of a dime novel which Willie had just been reading — The Red Captain: A Tale of the Pirates of the Spanish Main .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are a coward!" said Willie, through his clinched teeth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I ain't, Willie," piped the other, as best he could.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I say you are," cried the great chieftain, indignantly. "Don't tell me I'm a liar." He relinquished his hold upon the coward and resumed his speech. "You know me, men. Many of you have been my followers for long years. You saw "HE TURNED TO SAY: `KEEP UP A STOUT HEART.'" A young boy on hands and knees in the bushes calling up to someone above him. Illustration by Peter Newell me slay Six-handed Dick with my own hand. You know I never falter. Our comrade is a prisoner in the cruel hands of our enemies. Aw, Pete Washington? He dassent. My pa says if Pete ever troubles me he'll brain 'im. Come on! To the rescue! Who will go with me to the rescue? Aw, come on! What are you afraid of?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was another instance of the power of eloquence upon the human mind. There was only one boy who was not thrilled by this oration, and he was a boy whose favorite reading had been of the road-agents and gun-fighters of the great West, and he thought the whole thing should be conducted in the Deadwood Dick manner. This talk of a "comrade" was silly; "pard" was the proper word. He resolved that he would make a show of being a pirate, and keep secret the fact that he really was Hold-up Harry, the Terror of the Sierras.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But the others were knit close in piratical bonds. One by one they climbed the fence at a point hidden from the house by tall shrubs. With many a low-breathed caution they went upon their perilous adventure.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jimmie was grown tired of waiting for his friends who would be faithful unto death. Finally he decided that he would rescue himself. It would be a gross breach of rule, but he couldn't sit there all the rest of the day waiting for his faithful-unto-death friends. The window was only five feet from the ground. He softly raised the sash and threw one leg over the sill. But at the same time he perceived his friends snaking among the bushes. He withdrew his leg and waited, seeing that he was now to be rescued in an orthodox way. The brave pirates came nearer and nearer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jimmie heard a noise of a closing door, and turning, he saw his father in the room looking at him and the open window in angry surprise. Boys never faint, but Jimmie probably came as near to it as may the average boy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's all this?" asked the doctor, staring. Involuntarily Jimmie glanced over his shoulder through the window. His father saw the creeping figures. "What are those boys doing?" he said, sharply, and he knit his brows.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nothin'."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nothing! Don't tell me that. Are they coming here to the window?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Y-e-s, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What for?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"To — to see me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What about?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"About — about nothin'."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What about?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jimmie knew that he could conceal nothing. He said, "They're comin' to — to — to rescue me." He began to whimper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The doctor sat down heavily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What? To rescue you?" he gasped.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Y-yes, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The doctor's eyes began to twinkle. "Very well," he said presently. "I will sit here and observe this rescue. And on no account do you warn them that I am here. Understand?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Of course Jimmie understood. He had been mad to warn his friends, but his father's mere presence had frightened him from doing it. He stood trembling at the window, while the doctor stretched in an easy-chair near at hand. They waited. The doctor could tell by his son's increasing agitation that the great moment was near. Suddenly he heard Willie Dalzel's voice hiss out a word: "S-s-silence!" Then the same voice addressed Jimmie at the window. "Good cheer, my comrade. The time is now at hand. I have come. Never did the Red Captain turn his back on a friend. One minute more and you will be free. Once aboard my gallant craft and you can bid defiance to your haughty enemies. Why don't you hurry up? What are you standin' there lookin' like a cow for?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I — er — now — you — " stammered Jimmie.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here Hold-up Harry, the Terror of the Sierras, evidently concluded that Willie Dalzel had had enough of the premier part, so he said:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Brace up, pard. Don't ye turn white-livered now, fer ye know that Hold-up Harry, the Terrar of the Sarahs, ain't the man ter — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, stop it!" said Willie Dalzel. "He won't understand that, you know. He's a pirate. Now, Jimmie, come on. Be of light heart, my comrade. Soon you — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I 'low arter all this here long time in jail ye thought ye had no friends mebbe, but I tell ye Hold-up Harry, the Terrar of the Sarahs — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A boat is waitin' — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have ready a trusty horse — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Willie Dalzel could endure his rival no longer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Look here, Henry, you're spoilin' the whole thing. We're all pirates, don't you see, and you're a pirate too."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I ain't a pirate. I'm Hold-up Harry, the Terrar of the Sarahs."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You ain't, I say," said Willie, in despair. "You're spoilin' everything, you are. All right, now. You wait. I'll fix you for this, see if I don't! Oh, come on, Jimmie. A boat awaits us at the foot of the rocks. In one short hour you'll be free forever from your ex — exewable enemies, and their vile plots. Hasten, for the dawn approaches."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The suffering Jimmie looked at his father, and was surprised at what he saw. The doctor was doubled up like a man with the colic. He was breathing heavily. The boy turned again to his friends.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"THE BOY TURNED AGAIN TO HIS FRIENDS." A boy at a window with his father doubled over in a chair behind him. Illustration by Peter Newell</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I — now — look — here," he began, stumbling among the words. "You — I — I don't think I'll be rescued to-day."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The pirates were scandalized. "What?" they whispered, angrily. "Ain't you goin' to be rescued? Well, all right for you, Jimmie Trescott. That's a nice way to act, that is!" Their upturned eyes glowered at Jimmie.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Suddenly Doctor Trescott appeared at the window with Jimmie. "Oh, go home, boys!" he gasped, but they did not hear him. Upon the instant they had whirled and scampered away like deer. The first lad to reach the fence was the Red Captain, but Hold-up Harry, the Terror of the Sierras was so close that there was little to choose between them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"THEY WHIRLED AND SCAMPERED AWAY LIKE DEER." Four boys running fearfully toward a fence. Illustration by Peter Newell</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Doctor Trescott lowered the window, and then spoke to his son in his usual quiet way. "Jimmie, I wish you would go and tell Peter to have the buggy ready at seven o'clock."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir," said Jimmie, and he swaggered out to the stables. "Pete, father wants the buggy ready at seven o'clock."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Peter paid no heed to this order, but with the tender sympathy of a true friend he inquired, "Hu't?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hurt? Did what hurt?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yer trouncin'."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Trouncin'!" said Jimmie, contemptuously. "I didn't get no trouncin'."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No?" said Peter. He gave Jimmie a quick shrewd glance, and saw that he was telling the truth. He began to mutter and mumble over his work. "Ump! Ump! Dese yer white folks act like they think er boy's made er glass. No trouncin'! Ump!" He was consumed with curiosity to learn why Jimmie had not felt a heavy parental hand, but he did not care to lower his dignity by asking questions about it. At last, however, he reached the limits of his endurance, and in a voice pretentiously careless he asked, "Didn' yer pop take on like mad erbout dese yer cay'ge lamps?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Carriage lamps?" inquired Jimmie.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ump."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, he didn't say anything about carriage lamps — not that I remember. Maybe he did, though. Lemme see . . . . No, he never mentioned 'em."</field>
