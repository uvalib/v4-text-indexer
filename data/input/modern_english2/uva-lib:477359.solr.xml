      <field name="fulltext">"John Luke Flyinghorse, Sr. - Marine Boot Camp Photo" Photo of John Luke Flyinghorse, Sr. from Marine boot camp. The following is a collection of narratives written or spoken by Native American veterans about the Vietnam War. Currently, no such collection is available, a surprising absence in that Native Americans were perhaps the most widely represented group in the armed services during the time of the Vietnam War. According to the 1980 U.S. Census, 82,000 American Indians served in the military during the Vietnam era. Many, undoubtedly, found themselves in Vietnam. Yet, no major study to date has identified Native American veterans as a distinct socioeconomic group in that war. In fact, only recently has any significant attention been given to the social, economic, and cultural needs of Native Americans in general. It is time that Vietnam War era American Indian vets and their families be provided a forum for expressing their views and reflections on America's longest war. Hence, the purpose of this collection is to present in their own voices the experience of Native Americans during the Vietnam War era.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Flaws in the Official Histories:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As we turn again and again to assess the meaning of Vietnam and its role in recent history, we find that the official view of the war, the one that could provide the big picture, is a strikingly limited one. It is limited because the experience in the field was not consistent with the accounts put together at the headquarters planning level. It is now commonly accepted that our quantitative accounts of the war body counts, weapons captured, villages stabilized, and refugees resettled can be highly misleading. Often the figures were outright misstatements. Often, our leaders were telling us what they hoped was the case, what should have been, or what could have been. In short, the war that we were told was happening was often not the real war at all.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Potential of Unofficial Histories:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">No wonder, then, that in the pursuit of the meaning of Vietnam, some researchers have gone the opposite direction from the official view. We now know that what individual soldiers saw, felt, and later reported has great value, despite the obvious limitations. As participants in any activity, we are radically limited in what we observe, and our later report is certain to be a kind of distortion. But this kind of individualized distortion could hardly be more distorted than the official view. And we now accept the premise that a collection of individualized views when taken together could correct a distortion, could clarify a picture.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What has become a standard in the field of Vietnam research are the unofficial histories, often in the form of collections of narratives volumes such as Bloods , Grunts , A Piece of My Heart , Nam , and In the Combat Zone . In these collections, several groups have now had the opportunity to present their experiences in Vietnam: Blacks, nurses, pilots, Special Forces, and so on. Our knowledge of the Vietnam War is richer, wiser, more complete, and more accurate because of these accounts. With them we are closer to understanding the events.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the effort of chronicle the record of the man, or woman, in the field, one group has been totally overlookedâ€”the Native American.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Native Americans and the Vietnam War:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Among the annals and fables of the Vietnam War are many references to Indian Country, a term given by American troops to describe the territory held by their enemy, the Viet Cong. As a term, Indian Country conjures images of the unfamiliar terrain inhabited by blood thirsty, heathen savages of American western folklore. Reminiscent are the war-whooping raiders of the Great Plains tribes, circling the covered wagons and the charge of the U.S. Cavalry. Ironically, however, in Vietnam there were no Indian war parties, no attacks on covered wagons, and when the U.S. Cavalry charged into battle, it had the enlisted support of Native Americans whose ancestors were the targets of former U.S. policies in another series of conflicts known as the Indian Wars. Gone were the old myths about the revival of a Pre-Columbia Native America. Gone, too, were the old myths about vanquished Indians being left to vanish on Federal Indian Reservations. A new portrait of Native Americans began to emerge during the Vietnam era. This new American Indian was more independent, autonomous and possessed a greater awareness of his place in American history and modem society. And, for many, the Vietnam War presented this emergent Native American with new opportunities.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After years of bearing the yoke of dependency, created in part by the misguided policies of a seemingly indifferent government, Native Americans began to arise as a more visible and active minority of the American population. It was during this time, when Native Americans were facing the problems of adjusting to contemporary life, that the Vietnam War was increasing its momentum. For many Native Americans, the Vietnam War presented a way out of the cycle of poverty experienced on government reservations. For others, it was a way of demonstrating patriotic pride, and following the warrior's path through active military service. Regardless of the reasons, approximately 82,000 Native Americans served in the military during the Vietnam War era.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The voices of these Native Americans have scarcely been heard. At a time when the chronicles of the Vietnam War have captured the reflections, thoughts and sentiments of many other groups and individuals, the voices Native Americans have remained relatively silent. If they remain silent, if their stories go untold, we risk once again having an incomplete and distorted history. We would be settling for a history with similar distortions to the previous histories that failed to account for the voices of other Native Americans who were instrumental in the cultural, political, and social development of the land we call America.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Steve Gano (Salish/Kootenai)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Steve Gano had just received his AA degree in junior college when he enlisted for three years of service in the United States military, expressing an interest in piloting helicopters. After aircraft maintenance school in Fort Eustace, Virginia, Gano became first-sergeant of his unit in Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He fought in the Tet Offensive of 1968 before he had spent more than two weeks in service in Vietnam. Upon his return to the United States, he visited his parents before finishing his thirteen months of service as an instructor in Fort Steward, Virginia. He served in the Army Air Corps, 134th Assault Helicopter Unit (1967-1971) and later in the Montana National Guard (1980-1990). He established his own business in Big Ark, Montana, but was diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder soon after he signed on with the National Guard in aviation. Gano spent a great deal of time in intensive therapy for his condition and currently works, through his church programs and other organizations, with Vietnam veterans suffering from PTSD.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Vietnam Narrative By Steve Gano I had no idea what we were heading for. I was fresh out of high school in 1964, and the Vietnam war hadn't really progressed very far at that time. I was young, energetic, and anxious to get on with my life, so college at that time seemed to be the place to go. I spent two years in junior college, studying to be a commercial artist, with no idea what might be ahead for me. Unfortunately, Uncle Sam had other ideas, and they began to come into effect for me. A lot of my buddies were being drafted. That draft at that time was on the honor roll system. Get on the honor roll at college and keep your grades up, and you were pretty much exempt. I didn't have anything to worry about at that period. My grades were up, and I was doing well in college. As I finished my last year of junior college and received my AA degree, I got to thinking more and more about serving my country because I was at that time young and patriotic. The Vietnam War was starting to build, and my main thought was to get into the war as fast as I could and get into the action so that I could save the U.S. from the communists. So I went down to my draft board and enlisted for a three-year hitch in the military, knowing that if I enlisted I would have my choice on what I wanted to do in the Vietnam War. My choice at that period was to fly helicopters. Helicopters seemed to be a good way to get in the war and to see the country and do things that I wanted to do. I was off and on my way. My first duty station of course was basic training, at Fort Lewis, Washington. I was in the accelerated training program because they were trying to get us through the program and on our way to Vietnam. On weekends, my drill sergeant would take me out to the airfield to go through the helicopters, since he knew that's what I was interested in, but I didn't have a chance to ride in one at that time. After a six-week basic training course that should have lasted eight weeks I was sent to Fort Eustace, Virginia, where I went through aircraft maintenance school. I also learned how to fly, which crew chiefs in Vietnam were asked to do. From there I was sent to Fort Bragg, NC, where we built our unit. Being the very first one to arrive, I was first-sergeant of the unit. As the men started to come in we started to put our unit together. When there were fifteen crew chiefs in the unit, we went up to Fort Hood, Texas, where we picked up brand-spanking-new Huey helicopters and flew them back down to Fort Bragg, where we trained with them. At this point in time, our training period was accelerated, and we put things together to go to Vietnamâ€”weaponry, tents, anything we might need to build a camp over there. I distinctly remember scouring the countryside for refrigerators, ice-boxes, things we thought we might need over there to make us comfortable. You've got to remember at this point we were still young and naive and extremely excited and gung-ho. After our time at Fort Bragg, the crew chiefs were sent up to Oakland, California, where we were put on a merchant marine aircraft carrier with all of our aircraft. It was a 21-day ride to Vietnam by way of this carrier. (The rest of the unit went to Vietnam by troop ship.) On the way over we listened to music and pretty much had free run of the entire ship, doing everything a teenager of that time could do. The excitement, the thrilling feeling of going to Vietnam was overwhelming. We just couldn't wait to get into the battle. On the way over we rigged our aircraft with gun mounts. We built them up and basically got them ready for combat. We completely gutted the aircraft inside and out, took off the doors, did anything we could to lighten the load of the aircraft until we had just the basic flying machine with lots of weaponry. We made them into what Huey helicopters were supposed to be, the workhorse of Vietnam. At this point in time we were getting closer to our destination, which was Cam Ranh Bay in South Vietnam, where a lot of your troop ships brought U.S. soldiers into the country. I can remember coming into Cam Ranh Bay. It was at night and we could see rockets and mortar flares off into the distance. The whole sky was lit up. Suddenly, our excitement turned to apprehension. We were anxious to get on the shore, but now didn't really know quite what to expect. We had no previous training or preparation for going to Vietnam. We were on our own. The next morning we put all the blades on the helicopters and got them ready, then that afternoon we flew them to shore. Next, we got them ready to fly up to our camp on a piece of land called Phu Hep, half way up the provinces of South Vietnam. At this point in time, our commanding officer (who came in by troop ship) came over to the unit pad where I was stationed. He told me to take the aircraft and crew to a little outpost up in the northern province called Ban Me Thuot. Well, it was getting close to Christmas time about then, and this was my first mission, mind you. I had no idea what to expect, because we weren't going to be with our main unit at all. We were on our own, attached to a ground unit up there. Before leaving we got the lettering put on the helicopterâ€”at this time we were called the 134th Assault Helicopter Unit. We flew up to Ban Me Thuot, which took several hours from Cam Ranh Bay. It was just a little outpost dug into the hillside there. There were a few guys around to welcome us, and they were saying, Hey, we have a helicopter now. This is great, you know. We can do our flying and see what we are supposed to see. Our main purpose at this little outpost was to fly the commanding officer around the surrounding area so he could look for enemy movement. Well, on the second day after we'd flown up there, we did pick up the commanding officer, and we proceeded to fly around the area looking for enemy movement that afternoon. Nothing out of the extraordinary seemed to be happening at that time, so we came back and landed. Well, it being Christmas Eve, some kids from the little town right next to Ban Me Thuot there came in and put on a Christmas play for us, which I thought was pretty impressive. Hey, this was great, being fresh out of school and fresh into Vietnam. The smell of the palm trees, the beautiful countryside, and the people; it was exhilarating. I loved it. Of course, I hadn't seen any action, and I didn't know what to expect yet. So after the play was over, we proceeded to bed down, and I can remember dozing off and thinking, this isn't bad. Here I am in a strange country, the Republic of Vietnam, and I'm supposed to be in combat. It's relaxing. I don't know what to expect, but I'm at peace at this time. All of a sudden I was awakened by the most hellish sound I'd ever heard in my life. It was mortar fire, cannon fire, and rockets. We were basically being overrun. It was the Tet Offensive of 1968, and the bunkmate who was sleeping below reached up and grabbed me and threw me down on the floor. He told me to grab a weapon, look out after him, hold off fire, and follow him. So I grabbed a weapon and took out after him and ran to the far edge of the compound and jumped into a bunker. There were people running all over the place, and screaming, and dead bodies lying all over the ground. The dead bodies, I realized, were Americans. They were not the enemy. I got into this bunker with this guy, and he started firing out into the dark. I looked out, and I couldn't see anything, but he said, Just start shooting. Just start shooting. I had the M-60 that I took off the aircraft with my door-gunner. He was in the bunker next to me over on the other side and was basically doing the same thing I was. We were bewildered and didn't know what to do. Well, finally the flares started, and we saw bodies running back and forth out there, and we started firing out into the dark. I could see them dropping, but whether I was shooting them or somebody else I had no idea. I do remember my pucker power was being very well used at that point, and if I didn't get hemorrhoids out of that event, I guess I never will. But anyway, we kept firing into the dark until things finally started to quiet down. Now I'm sitting there in the bunker with this bunk mate and my door-gunner came over, and there are two other guys sitting in there with me. We hear a noise. It's real still and quiet at this time, and we hear a noise over on the other side of these sandbags. I look over, and here's a Viet Cong dressed in his black pajamas and carrying a carbine, crawling through the barbed wire, just taking his own sweet time about it, lifting the barbed wire up, placing it behind him, and so forth. Hey, there's a Viet Cong crawling through the barbed wire there, I told one of the guys there. He said, Kill him. I said, Man, I haven't shot anybody. He said, You're going to learn. You're not going to be one of the team until you kill him. So I had bought a sawed-off shotgun on the black market. I lifted it upâ€”I remember pointing it over the top of the bunkerâ€”and literally blew the VC's head off. I looked at him for a minute, not believing what I'd done. I was kind of numb with the experience, but I couldn't explain the feeling at that time. They started patting me on the back and congratulating me, and saying, You're one of us now, you're one of the guys. The first thing they did was put a gold stud in my belt. The air crew were all carrying snub nose .38s with a shoulder holster. (We had bought them on the black market down in Cam Ranh Bay.) They said, Now for every confirmed kill you have you put a stud in that belt. That's going to the mark of your success over here in the Republic of Vietnam. That was the first person I killed in Vietnam. The next morning we flew right into a combat mission and started hauling bodies out off this hillside as fast as they were falling. A lot of them were Americans; a lot of them were the enemy. I couldn't tell, when they were putting them on board, whether they were alive or dead. They were stacking them in there like cord wood. I was just completely overwhelmed at the amount of death, and I didn't understand how I was supposed to be reacting. I basically went into state of shock. There were so many bodies on board we could hardly take the aircraft up, but once we got the aircraft airborne, I was able to get into where the bodies were and start sorting through them. I tried to sort out the ones that were dead and ones that were still alive and do what I could medically to save the ones that were alive. I remember this one Americanâ€”he wasn't very old, he was a young guyâ€”had a pretty large hole in his back, which I suspect came from a mine or something. I was able to put my fist in the middle of a poncho and shove it into the hole in his back and twist it . That was the only thing that stopped him from bleeding to death. I then realized that my main purpose for being in Vietnam was going to be to save lives, not to kill Viet Cong or NVA. At that point in time, things started to change. By the time we got to the field hospital there was so much blood in the helicopter I couldn't tell if it was my ownâ€”if I was wounded or what. The only way I was able to tell was by taking off my clothes. The wash from the rotor blades would pick the blood up off the bodies and sling it back on me. I had it in my mouth, on my hands, and my flight gloves were so sticky with blood that they would actually stick to the gun mounts. That was about my second week in country. I got a real rude and fast awakening to Vietnam. I then was sent on another mission out of Ban Me Thuot farther up north on the other side of a little area called Anh Ke. The First Air Cavalry was stationed there and we flew support for them. The door-gunner was a guy I had trained stateside with. I remember him very well. His name was Gary Lamb. We became extremely close friends, closer than brothers could possibly be. He was married and had a little baby, and he and his wife would invite me over to the house for dinner. The last thing his wife told me before we left Fort Bragg was to take care of Gary and make sure he came back safely. Me being single at that time, I assured her very much that I would. When we were on this flight at Anh Ke we were flying low-level support for convoys. We'd fly level along the road in front of the convoys trying to look for any kind of enemy movement on the side of the road. We were flying this one morning especially early and happened to spot some gooks running up the hillside off to the right of us. We swung the aircraft around and made another loop back to come over the top of them and got caught in a crossfire. One of the pilots was shot, my door-gunner was shot, and we nose-dived into the ground. We didn't do that much damage on the aircraft because we were low and going at a fairly slow rate of speed, but it was enough to shake us up. Hey, this was the first time we'd been shot down. What a rude awakening, you know? Anyway, we hit the ground, and the first thing I did was to grab a machine gun off the mounts and set up a perimeter around the aircraft. I ran around the other side of the aircraft to get Gary and found him dead, shot through the neck. I was stunned, but we were also under attack. I knew if I didn't do something, we'd be overrun at that point and either killed or taken hostage. The pilots were okay. One had a bullet wound in his arm, and I was able to wrap a bandage around that. They set up a perimeter in the front of the aircraft, and we managed to hold the enemy back long enough for the convoy to get up to where we were. Fortunately, that drove the enemy off. I was able to repair it on-siteâ€”it was mostly wiring and one fuel line that was shot outâ€”and we flew it out. I would have loved to see the expression on the enemy's face. Being the section leader over in Vietnam and in charge of all my crew chiefs, it was my duty to write Gary's wife. It was probably one of the hardest things I ever had to do. I literally prayed to God at that time, asking, you know, why, why is this happening? I don't understand this, you know. He was my best friend. I just can't understand it. The pain never did go away. We flew back in that night. The fuel crews came out and patched up the holes and so forth. The next day, I flew the exact same mission with a new door-gunner. My door-gunners I picked from infantry, who had a waiting list of guys wanting the job. The infantry I would give my life for. They were super, excellent people, and if it wasn't for them, the other two times I was shot down I wouldn't be able to talk about this here and now. So I respect them completely and wholly. We had another mission the next morning and flew over into a valley called Pleiku, which was under rocket attack at that time. I can remember seeing a lot of bodies on the ground and as we set down, there was an aircraft flying beside us in the tall elephant grass. As it was setting down, it blew up, so we pulled out immediately. We didn't know what had happened, if it was a rocket, or a mortar, or just what. But we pulled up and landed in a field to one side. The troops there started running over and throwing the wounded on board while we were still under fire. We went in because we knew it was our duty to save them, and we just didn't think twice about it. There were so many of them that it was just overwhelming. And I can remember the wounded they were hauling up to the aircraft, some of them minus legs and arms and some of them dying and screaming. I was holding them in my hands, and they were dying and begging me to help them. There was so little I could do, since I also had to man my machine guns and keep the enemy away from the aircraft. When the pilot got shot in the wrist, I had to take over one of the controls. It was all so overwhelming that I dropped down beside the aircraft on my hands and knees and put my head down in the dust and said, Lord, I can't take this, I don't understand it, please stop it. And it was worse than it ever was. I remember that day was the day I stopped praying. I just said, If I'm to die in Vietnam, I will die in Vietnam. If it's my time, it's my timeâ€”that thought gave me a different attitude about the war. You might say I came to enjoy it, to look forward to it. I became the gung-ho John Wayne type, just like everybody else over there. There was so much death, so much killing on an everyday basis that you just had to accept what was going to happenâ€”it you get it, you get it. That made it a little bit easier to get through the war. I think the sky pilots must have had a terrible time in Vietnam trying to counsel peopleâ€”sky pilot was the slang name that we gave to a chaplain in Vietnam. They weren't able to hold church services, so they really couldn't do the duties that they were sent to Vietnam to do. I think a lot of them came up with the same kind of attitudes that we did. I basically rejected God at that point, so I was able to slide right though the war with no problem at all. Then it got to a point where we got things turned around, and we were actually looking forward to the killing. Not for the joy of it, but because it was exhilarating to be able to get out there and start firing away and taking out aggressions against people. We were losing a lot of our own people, some of them my close friends, friends I trained with in the states. I became so numb to it I couldn't cry for them anymore. I just couldn't do it. I had one gentleman in my unit who we called Mother. During our training back in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, he was always the first one up in the morning who would bang on the garbage can lids and wake all of us up and make sure we got dressed. He was just a super likable fellow. We were flying a mission up out of Dak To, which is up in a northern province in Vietnam, where we'd pick up Montagnard villagers. We'd pick up the chief and fly him around the area and he'd tell an infantry officer and us where the enemy would be walking through the area that day. We would fly him around for two or three hours, then land and shut down the aircraft. I remember one occasion I was walking around the village and meeting the villagers and, you know, smoking the peace pipe with themâ€”the things you do with the villagers over there. Drinking their liquor just about knocked you on the butt. I was kind of walking around the village just checking things out and trading C-rations for pipes made out of copper and roots and so forth, and spent the rest of the afternoon there and got back in the aircraft and left. The next morning I assigned another crew to go out and fly the same mission, but that night they didn't come back. We couldn't go back in the village that evening, so we waited until daylight, and I remember looking down and seeing that the aircraft was sitting on the ground burned to a crisp. There were three bodies lying beside it on the ground, face down. We called the infantry, who set up a perimeter around the village and went in and checked out the huts. Then we were able to land. The doorgunner was in the burned helicopter. He evidently tried to run back to the aircraft when an enemy patrol surprised them in the village. He managed to get in behind the machine gun before they shot and killed him, then set fire to the aircraft. They evidently were going to take the two pilots and the crew chief, Mother, prisoner because their hands were tied behind their backs. They were lying on the ground face down, each with a bullet hole in the back of the head. The guilt I felt at that point just about tore me up. I loved the doggoned guy like my own brother, yet I was the one who sent him on the mission. It also scared me because I was in there the day before. We put a stop to that type of mission fairly fast. But time continued to go on in Vietnam, and we would fly various other missions. We flew a lot of river patrols, where we'd fly low along the river after 6 pmâ€”the curfew on the river in Vietnam. Normally, any boats on the river after 6 pm were free fire because it was normally the enemy, hauling weapons down to South Vietnam. So we used to really try for those missions, so we could get out there and do a little bit of killing. At that point, we were looking forward to it. You know, to be able to shoot somebody was just, oh, the ultimateâ€”the exhilarating part of the war. I spent a lot of time after that in various camps, flying support for different groups. We did a lot of body runs. We took a lot of teams out, sometimes under fire. We took more risks than I can believe. The war was so accelerated, and in such a small piece of land that we were in combat action daily. There was never a day, seven days a week, twenty-four hours a day, the entire year I was there (that I can recall) that we weren't in some kind of combat. It just became normal practice. It was just something you looked forward to, something we knew was going to happen. We got so complacent that we went from wearing O.D. green t-shirts to white t-shirts. We quit the breast armorâ€”became the gung-ho John Wayne types. I became close friends with a new door-gunner I gotâ€”Peewee, a little shrimp of a guy. He was excellent on the M-60's, and I became fairly close to him when we were flying a mission called Cyclops. We would fly level up and down these canyons firing door guns out to the side of the aircraft. A Vietnamese fixed-wing aircraft would fly behind with loudspeakers telling the enemy to give up, telling them they didn't have to be hunted down this way, didn't have to be shot at, and so forth. Give up and come back to us, they said. I remember flying down this one long, deep canyon when I was flying copilot. One of the pilots was back on the guns. We happened to fly out into an opening, right into an enemy patrol of NVA. Unfortunately, we were still in the canyon, and by the time we were able to pull out they put enough fire into the aircraft to sink us. We had one first sergeant on board from one of the First Cav units who got his leg taken off right at the kneecap, and he fell over on the floor of the aircraft. Since we didn't have seats on the aircraft, he had been sitting on his helmet so he wouldn't be shot in the butt. Peewee got shot in the chest and was killed instantly. The pilot who was flying in the crew chief slot took a round that went inside his helmet, around his helmet, then out the back-side into the firewall behind him, where it lodged against the transmission. We went down too far from where the enemy patrol was, but to our luck there was also an eight-man LRRP team out there. LRRPs or Lurps were the long-range reconnaissance patrols that would go out to just scout and see what they could stir up, what kind of trouble they could find, and so forth. So these lurps were out there, and they just happened to see us come down and were able to get to us almost by the time we hit the ground, though the enemy was right behind us. We were able to set the aircraft down in the lower part of the brush without much damage. They got up behind the aircraft and were about, oh, I'd say a hundred yards away from us, and starting to fire. But the lurp patrol had enough fire weaponry to keep them pinned down, and we were able to call in Puff, which was a C-130 that was fitted with machine guns and mini guns. It could fly over and literally cover every square foot of an area the size of a football field with firepower. Puff happened to be flying around our vicinity and was able to devastate the enemy right at that point. There was so much excitement I didn't have a chance to see what was going on outside the aircraft. I got out and was shaking so bad I couldn't stand up. I walked around to see what Peewee was doing, but Peewee was dead. I came unglued, but I couldn't cry. The sad feelings were there, but I couldn't get the emotions out. After we took the aircraft outâ€”it was swung out with a craneâ€”we took it back to a little base not far from Pleiku. It was an area called Happy Valley, just like out of Anh Ke. We did the repairs on it that we needed and took a mission the very next day. We were flying to a hospital in Nha Trang and areas up and down the coastline, hauling a lot of American bodies. Things that went on in Vietnam seem unbelievable, even to this day. I went through more uniforms messed up with the blood of my buddies and never once was wounded myself. I was in a door-gunner position one day when we were just flying over the jungles, and I was leaning over the aircraft looking out. My back got sore from leaning over, so I sat up and saw just kind of a flash before my eyes, and could feel little flakes of metal on my cheek. I brushed then with my flight glove and saw it was metal, little flakes of metal, and I looked up and there was a bullet hole in the ceiling. If I hadn't sat up when I did the bullet would have gone right through my neck. I just kind of lay back and said, My God, I just about bought the farm. And that was the end of it. We used to take a lot of chances over there, some unbelievable chances, but I could say they were all for a purpose. Like, the infantry was great. I worshipped the ground they walked on. We were their lifeline and vice-versa. I thought nothing of going into a town like Nha Trang and stocking up on ten, twelve cases of Coke or pop and magazines then flying them back out into the field on a supply run the next morning. You know, you just didn't think about it. It was a pretty hellish war. It went on like that, you know, day after day after day, and I just became absolute crazy with the feelings that were going on over there. At that time I was trying so hard to keep my sanity by saying, I'm over here; I'm fighting for my country, the United States of America; I'm fighting against Communism. When Jane Fonda was up in North Vietnam protesting, calling us jerks and baby killers and everything for being there in the first place, she was fighting us, I felt. It was hard for us to understand what was going on up there. Many a time we'd uncover underground hospitals that the enemy had built, and there would be cases and cases of blood plasma and medicine donated to North Vietnam by Berkeley College [sic] in the United States, donations right direct to the enemy. Berkeley College was protesting war in Vietnam at that time, and seeing stuff like that mixed in our emotions. Yet we knew we were there, and we were there to stay and were serving a purpose. We had some fun times in Vietnam also. I can recall times when we went water skiing behind the aircraft and other crazy things, you know, like flying low-level across a compound, trying to pick up a tent peg with the skids of an aircraft. Things like thatâ€”anything to keep some sanity. It was really a different kind of situation to be in, and coming fresh out of school and going right into an environment like that was the absolute ultimate. I reached a point where I couldn't wear enough weaponry. I had pistols strapped on; I had machineguns, and I had ammo strapped over my back. Believe it or not, I would actually use a majority of it up in a mission. I was fortunate enough never to have to go into hand-to-hand combat with the gooks on the ground. We were fighting two different factions in Vietnam. We were fighting the NVA, which was your North Vietnamese Army, trained Communist soldiers out of North Vietnam. They were bigger, and had better weapons, and were better prepared than the Viet Cong, who were your Southern enemy. They were your storekeepers and your shop clerks by day, and then at night they'd turn around and try to kill you. So basically, we were fighting two different factions of people over there, which were both pretty unruly fighters. If we weren't fighting during the day, we were being mortared during the night, which was a devastating, scary soundâ€”to be sound asleep and all of a sudden hear mortars exploding all around. You're wide-awake and numb at the same time, but you know what to do. Boy, you dive for the floor; you dive for the bunkers; you get out of there, you get out of there, you get out of there fast, you low-crawl in the sand. Well, anyway, the Vietnam war went on like that, devastation day after day and so forth. Finally, I had about a month to go. I was one of the so-called short-timers and I still couldn't see the end at that point. I knew I was headed back, but I still couldn't see the end. Things went along fine until the last week came. Then I got scared. Boy, I was a short-timer, and it was my time to get out of Vietnam. I wanted out bad; I wanted out desperately; I couldn't get out fast enough. It came time for me to leave the following morning; we took my aircraft. We were flying to a mission down south to Cam Ranh Bay where I was going to board the aircraft. Mind you, by now we'd lost over half our unit in Vietnam, so at this point we were made up of a lot of scattered aircraft and a lot of scattered people. As we were flying down to Cam Ranh Bay, we were flying along an area just out of Nha Trang called Miami Beach. It was kind of a nickname given to a stretch of beach that was used as a play area for the Koreans who were fighting for us. As we were flying along the beach, we happened to see a firefight going on. Being the only aircraft in the area, we set her down and got what Koreans we could on board. We took a few rounds in the aircraft and at the same time we were being mortared and hit with every kind of firepower you can think of. It was pretty frightening and spooky just at that point. We managed to pull out of there and take a few rounds in the aircraft, plus some smoke damage. And there was blood. I remember one Korean's leg was completely shot off, and I was trying to hold the tourniquet on and fire the machinegun with the other hand. The tourniquet would slip off and blood would squirt all over my fatigues, but at that point you just don't care about it. But anyway, we landed at a hospital just before we got to Cam Ranh Bay, and took the Koreans to their hospital, then flew on to Cam Ranh. I grabbed my bags and jumped off the aircraft and said goodbye to the crew, and the pilot and I ran to the terminal where we were to board the big silver bird back to the United States. Well, we sat there in the terminal. I remember my face was covered with smoke, and my hands had blood on them. We didn't have time to change clothes, so we boarded the plane in our fatigues, still smelling of phosphorous and every other kind of combat smell you can think of. I still had bloodstains on my fatigues. Twenty-four hours later, I was home in the United States of America, and another twenty-four hours later, (right fresh out of combat) there were my folks, thrilled to see me back. The war had stopped; the war had ended for me right at that point. I walked into the house at home, and mom broke down and threw her arms around me. Dad gave me a big hug. Mom said Thank God you're home. The war's over. I don't want to hear a word about it. Dad was the same way. I was to shut the war out at that point. I sat there eating dinner in fatigues that I came out of Vietnam with forty-eight hours ago with blood on them and the smell of phosphorous and smoke. It was a hard adjustment to make, but at that point I started pushing the war behind me. Nobody wanted to talk about it. I still had thirteen months to serve when I got out of Vietnam, so I was sent back to Fort Stewart, Georgia, where I was an instructor for thirteen months, which was devastating, because nobody would listen to me. I was trying to train them the way it was done in Vietnam and prepare them for it, and they'd just laugh at me. It was really a frustrating period in my life. I couldn't wait to get out of the service, and I wasn't about to be sent back to Vietnam again. The war at that time was supposed to be behind me. I was supposed to forget the war completely. I went on to college and finished, but the protesting was still going on, even as the war was starting to wind down in '70 and '71. I didn't really dare pipe up and say, Hey, I fought over there, and all this and that. The protesting was pretty violent, and there were a lot of radicals. Anyway, I finished college, and I got married. I was still on a super-fantastic adrenalin high, so high that it was like being on drugs. It was unbelievable, and I couldn't come down off it. I became a workaholic. I had two, three jobs that I would be doing at one time, and everything I did was a type A behavior pattern where I couldn't do it fast enough or long enough. This went on for quite a few years, and I worked for corporations that would transfer me a lot. About every four years they'd send me in a different territory where I would build up a whole new area. I was good at it and I was fast, because I had a tremendous amount of energy. I was a natural for it. As time went on over the years, I started missing the war. My last transfer was up to the state of Montana, where I resided in Big Ark. That's been about eight years now, from the date I'm giving this account [1991]. I started a new business in Big Ark, and since I was super full of energy it became a big success. It was my own business; I was my own boss, and I worked the business and the territory myself, but it wasn't enough, so I started another business, and I started another one. I had three businesses going and all were doing fantastic. But I was still missing something in my life. The war was trying to creep back in, and I was trying to push it back and bury it. So I finally wound up joining the National Guard. Well, I went into supply at the Kalispell unit and worked as a supply sergeant for a couple of years. I still wasn't getting what I wanted to get out of it, so I transferred over to aviation in Helena, Montana, and became a crew chief, and soon after that, a section leader. I was doing the same exact duties that I did in Vietnam. I was flying. I was in charge over the section and the men; we were flying Hueys, and we were doing assault missions training. I was with the unit a couple of years over there, and realized that something was happening, but I couldn't understand what it was for sure. I can remember between Saturday and Sunday drills I would be laying there in my bunk after a night flight, thinking about the flights the next day and who I'd schedule on them. I'd say, Well, I'll send Andy over on the Billings run tomorrow. Then I'd say, No, no, maybe I'd better not. He's married and has got a family and they got to go across the mountains and stuff like that. What was really happening was that the war was coming back, I was bringing it back, and I was bringing it back fast, but I didn't realize it then. Well, this went on for about two years, and I noticed after each drill I was more and more uncomfortable. I would have stomach pains and stuff like that, which I attributed to typical military food and so forth. Well, one drill, here about two years ago, we were flying a night flight, and it was up in the Montana mountains between Missoula and Helena. It was at night; it was freezing cold out, and it was cold and dark inside the aircraft. I was doing the map work with the map light, trying to lay out our plot and stuff like that, when all of a sudden I started sweatingâ€”I mean sweat was just pouring off me. I started shaking, just really violently shaking, and my stomach knotted up in a tremendous pain. I told the pilot to get me down on the ground right now, right here, that I was sick and didn't know what was happening. I didn't know if I had food poisoning or what. So we landed, right up there in the middle of nowhere. I got out of the aircraft and walked around a while, and felt a little bit better and got back in and felt kind of rotten the next day, which was Sunday, and finished out the drill weekend and went home. I didn't think anymore about it. The following week I had to put in an extra drill, so I was starting back over to Helena, and I was in my vehicle driving into Helena and just passing Fort Harrison, and all of a sudden I started sweating again, and started shaking, just tremendously and violently shaking. So I went right out to the VA hospital. I walked into the hospital, and I was white as a ghost, and one of the doctors there in the hospital took a look at me and said, What in the world are you scared of; what are you afraid of? And I said, I'm not afraid of anything. And he said, You are. You're petrified of something. And we sat down and got to talking, and went back over my flying and Vietnam and everything, and he told me I had posttraumatic delayed stress syndrome, had every symptom of it. I said, Nah, I heard about it, but I got no mental problem of that type. I got a physical problem. He told me to forget drill at this point and just go home and relax and see how I felt. So I went out to the field and told them what was happening and that I wasn't feeling too hot and that I wanted to go home. As I was driving back home, the pain in my stomach started knotting up. At home I started getting very nervous and anxious. All of a sudden I couldn't eat, and I couldn't sleep, and I started having nightmares and flashbacks. I was having them before, ever since I came out of Vietnam. Some were violentâ€”sometimes I would jump up on the bed and dive head first on the floor, thinking I was in mortar attack. Several times I've wound up with my arm in a sling from diving under furniture. They were continuous, but they weren't real bad. Now all of a sudden I was having tremendous flashbacks. I mean they were severe. And it wasn't just happening at night; it was happening during the day, and on a daily basis, too. I went down to my family doctor and told him there was something physically wrong with me, that my stomach ached, that I couldn't sleep, that I couldn't eat, and that I was miserable. So he took me in the hospital, checked me in, and ran every conceivable test he could think of. He told me he was sorry, but he couldn't find anything physically wrong with me, other than the symptoms. The nervousness and the not being able to eat, he could solve with drugs. He gave me a pill that gave me back my appetite, so we went the pill route, but meanwhile I was getting tremendously worse. I had a fear anxiety all of a sudden, and I couldn't be left alone. I couldn't work, and my businesses were going down the tubes. I couldn't leave the house; I was afraid to go anywhere, and I was afraid to have my wife leave to go to work. I would hang on to her and ask her to please not leave. I really, seriously, thought I was going nuts. It was bad. My boys were afraid, and so forth. Finally, my medical doctor told me he could help me. He understood what I was going through, the posttraumatic delayed stress syndrome, but he wasn't an expert in that field, so he suggested that I contact the VA hospital. I did talk to the VA hospital, and they set me up with a doctor down in Missoula. When I talked to him, he told me the program we were going to go on, and how we were going to treat the problem, and so forth. I had posttraumatic delayed stress syndrome, plain and simple. For some veterans, it shows up later down the road. I had gotten it early in the game because I forced the issue with my flyingâ€”I actually brought it back myself. It was best explained to me that when you first go into combat so young, it's a shock to the system. And the war is so severe and so violent, compared to what we are normally used to, that we are kind of numb and in shock and stay that way. Then we come out of the war. It's forgotten; we come out of a wartime environment and twenty-four, forty-eight hours later we're home, back in the safe world and we've forgotten the war and we've buried it. But as we get older and mature, it starts to surface; we start to understand what really happened to us over there. It starts coming back to us; we start reliving the whole thing. The emotions and feelings we buried are trying to get back out, and it's a very serious problem. The doctor down in Missoula flat told me that a lot of vets were committing suicide over this thing, and that doctors really don't know what to do to help them. A lot of doctors were going the drug route, using drugs to calm patients down and so forth. But that doctor didn't know that that was the sure way to do it. It was still a kind of pioneering field. So he had me go into the hospital at St. Pat's down there for a couple of weeks of evaluation and counseling. It was unfortunate because it was over the holidays, the 4 th of July, and all the doctors went on vacation. I sat there for a week and watched TV. I felt great. I relaxed and calmed down. But when they took me out of the hospital, I was miserable again, absolutely miserable. I got back home, and I became even worse. I got to the point where I just couldn't eat, and I went way down in weight. I was seriously, honestly looking towards death. I wasn't suicidal, but I could see myself dying because I was so far out of it. I just didn't know how to handle what was happening to me, or anything else. I could see my business going down the tubes, my life and my family. My wife, of course, was upset. She didn't know how to handle it, or what it was all about. My kids were the same way. So I finally called the VA hospital over in Seattle and asked what they could do about it. They said they bring these cases in for sixty days, drug them, calm them down, and then let them out again. I told them that that wasn't good enough. So I got word of a hospital, a brand-spanking new one, up in Kalispell, called Glacier View. They were a California-based operation, and were primarily there for alcoholics, to cure alcoholism. I called the hospital up there and told them what my situation was. The doctor told me they were starting to take, on a short-term basis, patients who are having emotional problems. He told me he wanted to talk to me, so I went up to Kalispell to see him. He was from California and had handled cases of my type down there. He said he'd take me in for the three weeks to see what they could do. So I checked into the hospital. Mind you, in the meantime, I was in pretty miserable shape; in fact, I thought dead was the way I was going to end up, just starving myself, or whatever. He checked me in, and the first thing he did was take away every pill I had. I had sedatives, pills to calm my stomach before I ate so I could eat, pills for the diarrhea that came with anxiety, and pills for appetite. He threw every one of them away. I told him he was going to kill meâ€”that I had to have those pills. He told me we were going to do it his wayâ€”that I was going to do it without pills. He got two of the therapists up there, two young ladies, who were excellent in their field. We started grief therapy. For two hours a day, every day, they would take me into a room and set me down, and we would just start in. They had me relive the war completely, every detail, everything I could pull out of it. We would go until I would literally break down and just bawl. I called it emotional vomiting. My emotions were starting to come back. The pain in my stomach started to relieve, and I could get to where I could start eating again. As the first couple of weeks went along, I started feeling good. The third week I started looking forward to the sessions. They had me low crawling in the hallways and everything. The nightmares started to disappear and the flashbacks were slowly starting to go away. I was really starting to feel good. By the third week we figured we were pretty much through this part of it, and the rest of it could be done on an outpatient basis with a local psychiatrist. So I checked out of the hospital. First thing I knew, I was miserable. I had an anxiety that was overwhelming. I had a hundred and some-odd emotions that all of a sudden surfaced. I didn't know what to do with them, how to place them or how to deal with them. So they checked me back in for another week and used the whole time on anxiety control. It was fantastic, the techniques I learned. I started checking out books on stress and stress control, and diet, and anxiety, and it got to where I was really proficient with it. When I got out of the hospital again, I immediately went back to my job, going around to see my customers. I never at any time tried to hide the fact that I was going through this posttraumatic delayed stress syndrome. In fact, my customers, a lot of them, came up to the hospital to see me. They'd heard about the problem, but never seen anybody who had experienced it. A lot of them said they had been in Vietnam, too. So really I had a tremendous amount of support from my customers. All this time I was in the hospital and out of work. My main corporation in Boise kept paychecks coming, so I was never without a paycheck. So that was kind of a load off my mind, too. I was really starting to gain a lot of headway with the anxiety control and got back to work and back to my customers and was able to talk to them. I was progressively getting better, and as time goes on I'm getting a lot better. The traumatic stress syndrome is very, very deadly. It can really destroy families. My wife and my children took the counseling with me. They understood what was going on. My wife explained to me what hell it had been to live with me for the seventeen years. I never realized she had felt that way; I thought that I was perfect, that there wasn't a thing wrong with me. Now we've become much closer. I've been able to get my feelings out and express them to her. I went to the pastor of my church, who was a new pastor and had just taken over. When all this was happening with me, I was all torn up and couldn't find any inner peace. I was still overwhelmed and figured the only inner peace I could get would have to come from within God and myself. So I went to my pastor, and asked him how to pray and to receive God again. He didn't know what to tell me. He had no idea, not because he lacked knowledge, but because he didn't understand what I was going through. So I kind of threw him. Well, I in turn picked up the Bible and started reading Psalms, and I'd read them over and over again, about the pain and the suffering. And I read Job. I was able to identify with Job one hundred percent. That worked out perfectly, because Job was basically acting the same way I was. I started finding inner peace. I now am more involved in my church, working with vets. Having gone through this, and gone through it so violently, I can work with them and understand what they're going through. Hopefully, I can be a great help to them. It's probably going to be another year or two before I'm completely out of the woods on this, but at least I'm learning to live with it and understand it. I'm hoping the public will become more aware of it. We figure that five percent of the United States' population of Vietnam vets resides here in the state of Montana. The figures for 1988 by the vet organizations figure that 60,000 vets will probably commit suicide this year. So it is a very serious problem and needs to be confronted head-on. So I'm praying and I'm hoping that more and more vets will come forth and seek the help that they need, and that with everybody's help and understanding we can come to help these people out.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">VIETNAM: A Narrative By John Luke Flyinghorse, Sr. There was nothing to talk or think about. It was a given that all males in our family would join the armed services when their time cameâ€¦so my dad, uncles and my grandfather's started preparing us for war when we were very youngâ€¦all of us. A lot of our activities started taking place late at night, especially when it was storming out and the moon was hidden. This included riding horses in electrical storms, when their ears would spark blue, and you could see the blue light dance between their ears. We were also taught to ride horses across swollen rivers, when the ice breaks up and the river is flowing bank to bank when the big icebergs flow past you real fastâ€¦we were taught not to show fear or panic because that would spook the horse and we would both drown. As I think back, I am thankful that we had these kinds of teachersâ€¦because holding our emotions in check is a leadership traitâ€¦ My friends were also my cousins. We had already buried some of my uncles in the family cemetery, and we honored them yearly because they were veterans, so it wasn't like we would just go and die and that would be the end. We knew if something did happen, we would be taken care ofâ€¦forever. My grandfathers told us that the white man has a myth about usâ€”that we can see in the dark, hear movement miles away simply by putting our ears to the ground, and with our acute sense of smell, we can actually smell out the enemy. Of course, most of these myths are just thatâ€¦but we prepared anyway. We did go hunting cottontails in the darkâ€¦and we were taken high up into the hills while someone was down below making sounds and noises, and we would identify them; our stealth was constantly being tested. In my hometown of McIntosh, SD, all the Indians went to war; not very many of the white boys went, only the very poorest of the poor; but we all stood together as one in honoring all those leaving and returning. One of my cousins had just returned from Vietnam, and he told us younger boys about it. In the telling he didn't show any emotion or elaborate, he just told what he did and what he saw, so when my cousin George and I were old enough, we quit school and enlisted in the United States Marine Corps, for four years each. Since our returning cousin was a Marine, we already knew what would happen to us; it was the brutality of boot camp that was challenging. When our cousin was telling us of his boot camp experience, we all thought he was making up these wild stories, but he wasn't. My dad's and my grandfather's generations were all US Army; my generation was all U.S. Marines. My father took this especially hard because he always wanted us to join the 101 st [U.S. Army Airborne Division] like he did. One of my grandfathers told me that since he knew I was going into combat, he knew I would be safe with the Marines; he just told us to do what we were told and taught, and we would be home safe before we knew it. As for the community, a few days before we were to leave, we were invited to the city bar where even the sheriff bought us beer, even though we weren't old enough to drink legally. This surprised us, but I think my uncles and other relatives had a lot to do with this. Daily, the drill instructors separated all of us by race, so we weren't the only ones segregatedâ€¦I think this instilled in us the fact that even though we all came from different backgrounds, we were all there for a common cause. Of course, at first we didn't see this, but as time went on we could see how this was working for the benefit of the Corps; we learned to depend on one another without thinking about it. Through hard work I became a squad leader, and upon graduation I was promoted to PFC, a privilege provided to only eight out of a platoon of 180 men. Upon learning that I was going to Vietnam, there was a big sigh of reliefâ€”a final knowing. This only left the question of when. Vietnam is possibly the most beautiful country in the worldâ€¦and I was here and I couldn't believe itâ€¦like a huge manicured garden. Before I had left for Vietnam, one of my relatives sent me a letter they tore out of the local newspaper. It was a letter written by Kenny Jamerson, who was critically wounded in Vietnam, and he died because of his wounds. But before he died, he had a nurse write this letter home to his parents; they had it printed. I cried when I read that letter, because he wrote of the beauty and the people living here, and that he wasn't afraid to die, nor did he blame them for taking his life. I was with Golf Company 2/7, 1 st Marine Division. We were a bush company working out in I Corps, which included that area from LZ Baldy up to the DMZ. This area also included the Thu Bon Mountains and the Ashau Valley, what we commonly called Death Valley because of all the losses our forces suffered here. I was sent out on more ambush and listening posts than most of the others, and I was eventually made the Company Commander's radio operator. I served in a grunt unit. My only concern was for the safety of my men. When not on patrol or cleaning gear, I was playing guitar and singing songs; it was our way of coping. My experience in Vietnam guaranteed [others] the right to spit in my face and throw bags of human excrement at me later on the 14 th street bridge in Washington DC.. Now I wear my colors with pride; it's my way of letting everyone know that I did serve and I am still proud to have served. I would do it again. American Indians always looked each other upâ€¦no matter what tribe we were from. That was the only mystiqueâ€¦why? I have no idea, but we had a bond. Its like this: I wouldn't rather put my life in anyone's else's hands than another American Indian, let alone someone else's life; so who better? No matter where we came from, we always walked point, or carried the radio, or were the Company Commander's operatorâ€¦always. I feel both honored and humbled at having that opportunity to go to Vietnam; so many vets have said that they wished they could have gone. You won't know why unless you've been there, and I know you have, so you know what I mean. I speak out against sending more American Indians to the Armed Services to go to any war the US is now engaged in, because the reasons have all been changed now. America has lost sight of what made her strong and united. I landed at LZ Baldy, I Corps, RVN on December 7 th , 1969 at 7:00 p.m. My first service was with Communications Platoon, H &amp; S Company, 7 th Marine Regiment, 1 st Marine Division as a radio operator. I had arrived a Lance Corporal; we were operators for the hill, and later on we were sent out on Listening Posts (LP's) and daylight patrols around the hill. Christmas in Vietnam: I was out in the bush when Christmas rolled around, and I had gotten a package from my grandmother. It was papaâ€”a form of jerky made from mule deer meat, cut into thin slices and dried from drying racks and seasoned lightly. This I shared with my men; we shared everything from home. Usually it was just a taste of home, but it meant the world to us, especially to those who didn't get any mail or gifts from their families. I do remember the peas and mashed potatoes washed out of my mess kit because of the falling rainâ€¦ My first encounter with death: one night I had the third shift on radio watch. I would physically go from post to post along the perimeter, checking on our radio operators and others, making sure they were all right and their gear was working. I preferred this rather than the meaningless radio calls that others usually did to do their checking on their watch. But we called the LP's and other patrols we sent out at night. When one of my LP's didn't answer, I waited until daylight; then four of us went out to check on the LP, which was only out about 200 meters from the perimeter, between us and the village. When we reached their position, we found four stripped bodies; they had cut everyone's throat and taken everything they carried. There was no sign of a struggle, and one guy even had a smile. I knew they had been smoking dope, and they had probably all been asleep as well, and I was angry. I also knew that only two or three people had done this, but three would be enough people to carry away all their gear. We called for a medivac and our Lt. came out with the chopper; he was carrying an AK rifle. When he saw the bodies he cursed then he cried, then he said, Stitch them up chief; they aren't going home like this. Field dutyâ€”working from the hill, we were rotated out on operations with the different bush companies of 2/7; I served with two bush companies, and after having gone out with them, I requested duty with Golf Company as one of their radio operators. One of my father's younger brother's was a squad leader with Hotel 2/7, and I didn't want to endanger him, so I had requested duty with Golf Company. No sooner had I arrived then I was made the Captain's radio operator, filling a Sergeant's billet, and I was put in charge of the radio operators who were with the company; the man I had replaced had rotated back to the world. When I was with the Captain, I set up the command post, and I carried a PRC-77 and a PRC-25 attached to each other through a connecting cable; the 77 was a cipher unit. But when I was on patrol, I carried the 25. We were severely undermanned, and our Captain was really a 2 nd Lt., just like I was really a L/Cpl., but I was called Sergeant, or just plain Chief; I didn't mind this because I was the Communications Chief. Unlike all the movies, I was the only one who could call in artillery support or air support, besides the Captain, and I helped him write letters back to families of those we lost in combat. We went to Laos and Cambodia and walked around a lot in the I Corps area; dates, times and places have no meaning to me, unlike my brothers and my two cousins who were also there at that time, and could keep track of all the places they had been and all the places they had seen action. I don't have that recallâ€¦and I don't know why, nor do I care. Some things I do recall vividlyâ€¦but they are perhaps best forgotten as well. Like the time we were on water patrol, we had all the men's canteens and we were searching for water. I was the second man back from point with my radio; I kept the point man in view, and when we had entered a slight clearing in the heavy jungle, this man in black pajamas jumped up from the trail we were on and started running away, tugging at his pajama bottoms. He didn't carry any arms with him as he made his escape. The point man stitched him up the back, and I saw this man go tumbling, then I heard him open up again; this time it was a woman who was lying in the trail with her pajama bottoms still down. It was apparent they had been having sex and we had surprised them, but we had our orders. Anyone wearing black pajamas or anyone who ran from us, carrying arms or not, we had orders to engage. New Year's Day 1970â€¦New Year's eve we were atop a mountain overlooking LZ Rider. There was an artillery battery up there already with a support grunt unit; I had just come back from setting up a relay station and had settled in for the night, when a frightening thought occurred to me. I called my Captain and we discussed this, and he in turn called the CO on LZ Rider, down below us, about three clicks away (3,000 meters), and he assured me that everything would be fine, so I left a wakeup call to wake me just before midnight; then I went to sleep. At exactly midnight, down below on LZ Rider, everyone who carried a weapon opened up, firing into the night sky. Pop-up flares and fireworks were set off celebrating the New Year, but within seconds of everyone expending their rounds, we could see the green and red tracers being traded down below, and huge explosions erupting with sporadic white tracers feebly coming back in defeated response from the defenders. The radios went wild, calls for fire-danger close and danger-close went out for artillery and air supportâ€¦and all we could do was watch from above, and curse them, cry. The next morning we came into the base campâ€¦ It was a slaughter. Sappers had gotten into the compound and had hidden under the hooches, waiting for this moment. Knowing the American psyche better then our own leaders did, they knew what we would do before it was done. While the men on LZ Rider were celebrating, the sappers under the hooches started blowing up the CP, the ammo dump and the fuel dump. And when our men came out of their hooches, they were shot as they came out. They killed 78 Marines that night; many more died from their wounds later on, and it took a huge effort to stabilize LZ Rider. The final body count was over 128 American lives we lost that night. But we didn't read about it in the Stars and Stripes , or hear about it on KFVNâ€¦but we were now a very angry bunch of Marines. In June, I contracted Malaria and I was sent to Cam Ranh Bay Army Hospital for seventeen days; then I was sent back to Battalion to recuperate another 10 daysâ€¦ July 4 th , 1970, somewhere in I Corps, atop another mountain: While Golf Company was at LZ Baldy for a three day rehab, I had been dispatched to give support to an artillery battery on top of some nameless mountain with only a number to identify where we were. One morning at dawn, we had sent out a platoon-size patrol into the village down below, because we had seen a lot of activity there during the night. A Republic of Korea Marine patrol and an Australian Marine patrol was also in the same area, so they set up defensive positions on three sides of the village, forming a triangle with the village at its center, and we waited for night. We did not have direct communications with either of our comrade units; we had to call Battalion to relay any communications to them, which complicated everything. At midnight on July 4 th , again the American Marines opened fire with their weapons and other pyrotechnics into the night sky; this gave away their position and they immediately drew gunfire from the village. When the people in the village opened fire on our Marines, the Australians and the ROK's [Republic of Korea troops] also opened fire on the village; then all gunfire stopped abruptly. What happened next was textbook war strategy, and we watched as we were manipulated into firing on each other. Our Marine units used white tracer rounds to identify ourselves, and it was known that the enemy used red or green tracers and sometimes captured white tracer rounds, which they used to their advantage. When everything seemed to settle down we thought it was over, but it had only just begun. During this lull, some men from the village had gone out and positioned themselves between our three groups of Marines, and at a given signal they opened fire on all three Marine patrols at the same time. This caused an immediate response from all three Marines units, and they each opened fire in two directionsâ€”in effect, our Marines were firing on each other. This continued for most of the night. The next morning we medivaced about twenty men from the Marine units engaged that night, and we found no blood or blood trails, or tracks of the enemy. There were many patrols and engagements of fire that I participated in, and one thing is certain. Neither I nor any of my Marines have ever shown any fear while engaged, only a very deep anger and sometimes a visible and verbal hatred for the enemy; sometimes this hatred has shown through even to our friendliesâ€¦lots of times. Personallyâ€¦I respect these people, very much. I did not feel this anger or hatred until the day my uncle was killed in a gunfight months later, in a place where even air strikes and artillery couldn't help us. A place where we fought on their terms, and we lost. But this anger and hatred left me almost as quickly as I felt it in my soul, and this feeling scared me, so I had to cry out. From the time of my Vietnam experience, I've had many nightmares I've had to live through. Most of them were of my men being under attack; sometimes I was with them, and other times I couldn't help them. But in each, we were desperately out of ammunition, and the enemy kept on coming. I've lost track of time, and in some cases I cannot recall what happened during these lapses in timeâ€”two months once, three days another time, hours and moments in other times; sometimes I would meet and visit with someone, and not remember it. I feel guilty that I did survive and my uncle didn't; my tribute to him is trying to make a life for myself and my family that he would be proud of. I've learned as much about my disability as possible, and I know the triggers that send me into these time lapses and guilt trips, and I try to avoid them as much as possible. I don't hunt, or fish, and I hate the 4 th of July. Thank you for having me write this down. I voluntarily do this from time to time to keep my perspective and my sanity; then, I tear it up. I've found that if we can write about this experience honestly and sincerely, we can heal sooner, and we can become better human beings towards others.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Gregory G. Gardner, of Choctaw descent paternally, enlisted in the United States Army in 1969, at the age of seventeen. His father, Billy G. Gardner, is a retired U.S. Army Sergeant-Major and served a tour of duty in Vietnam between 1967 and 1968. For some time, Gregory Gardner was involved with a local forum concerning MIA and POW issues. He was assigned to the 23 rd Infantry Division as a rifleman in 1971, and became a squad leader during his tour of duty. Gardner expresses his wish to reconnect with his paternal American Indian heritage, and was, at the age of forty, just beginning to explore certain aspects of his experiences in Vietnam and how they have affected his life.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Gardner's Letter 30 March 1992 To Whom It May Concern: I have been somewhat hesitant in responding to the notice in the Bishnick Paper from several months ago regarding Choctaws, with stories, who had served in Vietnam. I am still not certain that I could enhance any of your research or aid your project in any way. However, I did wish to convey some thoughts or feelings of mine and hope that they may be of some value to you. I am of Choctaw descent on my father's side of the family. My father is a retired Army Sergeant-Major. So, much of my youth was spent traveling and relocating through this wonderful country of ours. My father, Billy G. Gardner, was sent to Vietnam in 1967-68, as I recall. That was possibly the worst year of my life, even harder on me than the year that I spent in Vietnam. It seemed a constant worry for me, my father being where he was, and it seemed I had a burning desire to be there in his place. For me to go to Vietnam, I feel, was part of my destiny. My thoughts have changed some on the Vietnam era since I have grown older. As I recall, I went to Vietnam in 1971, at the age of nineteen. I remember when I came home I still could not buy alcohol in Texas. That used to be a major concern then, being able to buy alcohol. I was young and looked on Vietnam from the viewpoint of America fighting Communist aggression. In a way I still have that minority opinion. I think I keep that feeling because I do not want to believe all those lives were destroyed for greed and power. I felt it was a fight to free people and let them rule their country, just as America was able to be free. If I can hold on to that belief, I think I can live with the memories and the tragedies and joys of Vietnam. My thoughts now are that it was a war that was not meant to be won. We continue to leave too many stones unturned. My thoughts tear me up when I think of the MIA and POW issues. I was involved in a local forum for a period of time regarding the MIA/POWs. This was perhaps therapy for myself. I still believe there are many unanswered questions on this subject. But I am not able to find the answers. That is probably as much of my philosophy as you want to hear, so I will try to provide a brief synopsis of my Vietnam experience. I graduated from high school at seventeen years of age and went immediately into the United States Army. I thought I would be a career soldier like my father, but it was not to be. My mom and dad had to sign for me to go in the Army, and my dad would only sign if I chose a field that would be of some value in later years. So I went in the Signal Corps, which was not where I wanted to be. A little more than a year later, I was to get my chance to re-enlist for the infantry and for a tour in Vietnam. I had a lot of pride and felt that I could be somebody in the rice paddies and jungles of Vietnam. In 1971, I went to Vietnam, and was assigned to the 23 rd Infantry Division, America l. This was the division that Lt. Calley was assigned to. As history would tell us, the My Lai massacre was the responsibility of Lt. Calley. Having met and talked to Lt. Calley for a brief evening out at Ft. Benning, Georgia and having been stationed with a member of his platoon from My Lai, I believe that there remain several unanswered questions there also. Anyway, Ft. Benning is a story in and of itself. So in 1971, I went to Vietnam and was assigned to 23 rd Infantry Division. We were in the Chi Lai and Da Nang areas of operation. I started out as a rifleman, but you learn and experience many different positions in an Infantry Squad because you never know when you will have to do that person's job. During my tour, I became a Squad Leader. I was pretty efficient with explosives, and for a time I was doing some Advisory work in the Hue and Phu Bai areas. This was when the 101 st Airborne Division was standing downâ€”coming homeâ€”and part of what was left of our Division went up North to occupy their area. Vietnam for me was part of my youth, part of growing up; it had good and bad times. Some of our best times were coming in from the field, jungle, and going to the clubs in what was referred to as the rear. With rockets and sapper attacks, this was not always the best place to be, either. But we found some good times there. I suppose one of my most outstanding experiences, though, was when I was fired on by three of my own men while on ambush. We were on a mountain range in an area out from Da Nang called Charlie Ridge. This was like an NVA base camp built into the mountain. We set up. I put out the mechanical ambushes, claymore mines that were booby-trapped and daisy-chained together. I seemed to be good at this, and was pretty effective. My machine gunner was with me; in case I got killed he would know where they were and how to avoid them. We got back to the ambush site and lay there several hours, into the still of the night. This was a pretty active area not only for Charlie, but also for the NVA, since it was their base camp, or so we had been told. Well, three of my men were returned to me that day in the field. They had been detained in the rear because I caught them buying cocaine from the Vietnamese. We inventoried their belongings and found they had been taking to the fieldâ€”the bush. Well, I figured they had an extra few days rest in the rear, so I made them go on ambush that night with me, my machine gunner and my RTO [radiotelephone operator]. Time passed on; we waited and watched and listened. All of the sudden, the silence was broken when all three of these guys opened fire on my position. I had my M-16 ready to blast back, but realized if I did then my other two positions would probably open fire on me. One round tore across my foot, and it felt like I was hit. Well, it wasn't bad, as we found out later. They had stopped after each emptied his magazine at me. My RTO wanted to get a dust off in for me, but we were in too thick, and I didn't want to attract any more attention. They would have had a time trying to pull in those mechanical ambushes at night, so we held on. One of the guys I can remember so vividly because he had been assigned to us from the 101 st Airborne Division. The report I had even before this night was that they disbanded his squad from the unit he was assigned to because they had killed their squad leader on ambush one night. We got back to the CP, Command Post, the next morning and I got checked out and the CO, Company Commander, debriefed me. I was told it would be hard to prosecute these three, because all they needed to say was that it was dark, and they were disoriented. Well, they got shipped out somewhere else, and no one was seriously hurt. I hold on to this memory because it showed me a lot about people. I am probably not as trusting toward other people these days as I once was. I do recall my machine gunner coming to me and saying, Give us the word, Duke; we'll kill 'em. And the one guy I remember so well crawled to my position and said Sorry, Sarge, I didn't mean to do it. Duke was my nickname in those days. I have looked back on that particular night many times and thought, what if I would have said yes ? But then I realize I wouldn't have lived up to my nickname, and probably wouldn't be what I am todayâ€”still believing in truth, justice and the American way. I finally got out of the Army (throwing away eight years), got a degree and became a policeman. I have been reluctant to try to write anything about that era of my life. A lot of it did not turn out so good. But this experience, as hard as it is for me to accept what happened or why it happened, if I had given into temptation and had taken those three lives, I really think my life would be so much different. I can accept my actions for any lives that were taken in combat. That was, to me, unavoidable. There were a lot of good times there also. I hope nobody forgets them. Some of them, of course, are better left untold. I have a habit of rambling, when I talk and when I write. I must apologize for that. I hope that this little story is worthwhile for you. I was not certain what you would like or what type of format you preferred, so I just sat down and started this letter. I am, at the age of forty, just now becoming more in tune with my proud heritage. I am not able to spend much time learning of my ancestors nor can I afford much at this time, but I hope there will come a day when I can devote more to these proud, wonderful people. My dad mentioned writing, I hope he does. His name is Billy G. Gardner and he was in Vietnam, as I recall, in 1967-68. He is from Bennington, Oklahoma. Thank you for this opportunity to share with you one of life's most interesting moments for me and how one moment or one decision can change our destiny. Thank you. God bless you. Sincerely, Greg Gardner</field>

Nothing Holy shit, in a few years I'll be pushing fifty And I'm actually living in The World The land of the free and the home of the brave What's the matter with you? I stared at the menu printed on a sign fixed to the wall I'll tell you what's the matter with me. I just stepped through a door that has been closed Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â tight for twenty five years. That's what's the matter with me. What's the matter Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â with you? Smell the air, sweetheart Do you have any idea of what a banyan swamp smells like How it permeates the very fibers of your soul I loved it. I was where I was destined to be There, filled with adrenaline, out of my freaking fucking mind I cut the throat of a sixteen year old boy I painted his face green and I cut off his ears I wore his ears in a necklace around my throat That's what's the matter with me. My girl, the kid, my sweet treasure and morning sunlight Plays on her junior high school soccer team Tonight we took her and her compatriots as a victory treat To your fast food hot pizza palace For pepperoni and mushrooms, no anchovies please because they're yuckie, Italian pie Triumphant celebration over their wily arch enemy Our conquering junior amazons won over Friends Academy 4 to 2 Smiles all around, slaps on the back, tender hugs, grateful tears But for me I walked into a brick wall I saw, standing behind the counter taking my order with a feverish intensity, an Asian Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â child, a boy, appearing to be in the range of sixteen years My breath stood still in my lungs Oh God, do the dead come back to life to haunt us?

      <field name="fulltext">Red Eagle's Narrative I went in late, compared to most people, because I spent a couple of years in collegeâ€”University of Alaska and Shelby Jackson Junior College in Sitka, Alaska. I hung around for a while, drinking and making friends, and finally I turned twenty-two in boot camp. I went in 1967, so I was twenty-two years old. The funny thing about it is that a lot of the guys that I went down with were older guys joining the Navy. I think I initially went to avoid being drafted into the Army, 'cause my mother was always saying, Don't go in the Army; don't go in the Army. I think I had a couple of years of college; that had something to do with it, you know, looking at it from a rational point of view. Then I had the other part where my mother and my father were very loyal to the United States in that way. They believed in America. That's one of the things that bugged me for a long time when coming back home. Until now I didn't have that movie, Born on the Fourth of July ; I never thought about it until then. But once I thought about it, the thought kind of dawned on me that my parents were really, really American, besides the fact that they were both full-blood. And there's a Native American tradition to serve. All my uncles and everybody (the ones I knew), served in World War II and Korea. So all the stories were about Korea and Europe and the invasion of Italy and the Battle of the Bulge, you know. We had people in all of those places, 'cause we had a high participation rate in all of America's wars. So, here's the funny thing; last year, my dad was eighty-one, and they're always saying, When are you going to get a good job and retire? Get a good retirement pension? I don't need that. It doesn't mean anything to me, because I'm doing other things. I just don't want to be a go out and work my life away person. I've already done what my dad was talking about. Finally I just said, Ya know, what are you proud of, ya know, in your sons? He's proudest of the fact that both Keith and I did Vietnam. Despite the fact that I have a book out, I publish a magazine, and I have several college degrees, that's the thing that stuck in his mind. And that was just last year. It kinda blew me away. Because I've been working just to try to be a person, not going the Indian way. The drunks and the alcoholics died young. And there it [the war] was. In one way it's the greatest thing I've ever done in terms of its impact on my life. It may not have been so great in terms of epic storytelling. Everybody, all those war stories: Ulysses, Trojan War, Odyssey, and the Iliadâ€” all of these things are kinda warrior-oriented. Even in European history. Or maybe especially in European history, because warrior is not an Indian word; it's an English word. So, we got too many of them. In retrospect, it's been the ruin of our people, I believe. Right now I'm trying to talk like a college guy. But ya know, I never had that advantage when I was in Vietnam, because this college stuff didn't matter. If somebody, an officer found out you had college, you wound up doing the paperwork. And you didn't want to do the paperwork because something in your guts told you that you had to go do the other stuff. Only the nerds and the geeks do the paperwork. But it kept a friend of mine from getting killed. He's a medicine man now, up in Washington. He was in Vietnam. He was in a combat unit. I was in a non-combat unit; that wasn't our job. But that doesn't mean you don't get shot at; things go haywire. He had been, like, to one or two years of college before he went, too. But he wound up (he's Cocomish Indian) in Vietnam in a military combat unit, U.S. Army. They found out he could type, so he became the company clerk. His responsibility was to straighten out the paperwork. Because of the Tet offensive, everything was a mess. A lot of army units, military units got destroyed during that time. Also, a lot of records were destroyed. So they had to go to each man in the unit and do an interview with them and redo their record. Right now, they have this little dog-tag that carries your record on it. And whenever you go from one area to another they stick your dog-tag into the computer and the military has the only computer that can read it, because it's encoded [encrypted]. So if somebody tried to take your dog-tag and get information out of it, supposedly, they couldn't. But back then everything was pen and ink, or typewritten, and that was his job. So after six months in the field, he came in and spent the rest of his tour straightening out. He was an Indian guy, and in those days the enlistment form, paperwork, didn't have a place for Native American on it. When they said race on it: Other. Some people would mark in Caucasian because it wasn't on there. So he'd made sure that the Indian guys were marked Indian, other. And he wrote it out for them. So, he was taking care of the Indian guys. So I went to boot camp, and went to A-camp in '67, went out to Waukegan, Illinois. There's a naval station there. They call it the Great Lakes Naval Station. There's a boot camp there, and a training facility and a hospital. I went with an Irish girl who was a WAC at the hospital there for a while. I did A-school. Got taken before the board once, because I was too wild a character. And they knew I was in college, and they knew I was smart, 'cause I scored really high on the basic batteries and everything. They were all pissed off at me because I wasn't showing it. You know how that is; part rebel. Course, you don't realize at that time that because you were brought up Native American, you have a lot of problems. A lot of the roots of the PTSD problem with Native Americans now is not rooted in their military experience; it's rooted in their Native American experience in America. That's what we know now. Inherited PTSD. They got it from their uncles and aunts who did WWII and Korea. All of the destroyed families. It's all there. Actually, the whole United States is in a state of PTSD recovery. That's where all of the drugs, alcohol and violence come from. That's why it's so prominent in this culture. So, I remember in boot camp there were some confrontations with some of the white racists in the company, and I had to beat up a few guys. So I kind of established my authority. We had a recruit company commander. But I was the fuckin' new commander. That guy got to hold all the positions and the authority. But I held the tomahawk. (It's kinda gonna ramble anyway, so it doesn't matterâ€¦) And, uh, that kinda continued on throughout my Navy career. Always combat with the racists. Even to the day I got out they were doing the final evaluation in 1976; I got out in April. And this one white southern chief just really raked me over the coals. And the reason he didn't [like me] was because I was sober; I had gone to the Navy rehab in '75â€”February through March of '75. And he was still drinking. And he didn't like me at all. And the officer who called me into his office said, Look at this. The commander there knew I was smart, and I had done paperwork, told him I straightened out the paperwork at the facility in San Diego. So he called me in and said, Look at this, what's this? I said I don't know, this guy doesn't like me; we don't get along. He said, Yea, I figured that looking at this. What do you wanna do with this? I said, It doesn't matter to me because I'm gone; I'm out. So it stayed in the record, but I felt so bad about the military at that time that it didn't matter; it was just a bad part of my life. (See, I'm jumping around just like my book.) You know, that relationship continued. I had always stood my ground. I would not let people push me around. That was because I was Native American; I knew who I was, and I knew what I was in for, and I just tried to make the effort to stand my ground. That's why I was the company leader. They had it in title; I had it in reality, in boot camp. Very interesting. I went to B-school and had that kind of relationship there. Barely got out, because I was chasing Waves all the timeâ€”going down to Chicago and having a good time. Then I went to my first command, which is pre-commissioning command in San Diego. We're pre-commissioning for the summer. We spent a couple of months there, and November 10th we went up to San Francisco where the ship actually was. So we spent from November 10th to February 10th pre-commissioning. They can actually ship the ship out and do trials with it. U.S.S. Somers DVD34. My first command. I went on board as a shipmate third class, and went overseas, and we went down from San Francisco to Hunters Point Naval Station, which doesn't exist anymore like most of the stations, two Long Beach Naval Stations. Two San Diego stations don't exist anymore. Well, they really wiped out any traces of Vietnam. Because last week I was looking at the news and they blew up the old barracks at the Long Beach Naval Station. That's the first I'd known they had shut down the base. What they did is they distributed the fleet. We have one naval station in Everett, Washington. What they did is they split up the fleet into task forces. Rather than having two or three ports, they have a dozen or so spread out with each task force, in different task forces. A task force consists of an aircraft carrier and four cruisers and six destroyers, on Class Ships, plus gunboats and submarines. They attach submarines to a task force unit for submarine protection because they built a lot of submarines for a fast attack. That's the first time I went over there; it was in late '69-'70. We did gunfire activity and interdiction. A ship of that class has a lot of duties, and we did all of them. Search and rescue, north and south, launch support, recovery support for aircraft carriers, Yankee/Dixie station, going at night, and fire all night long. So it was like a ship with a twenty-four hour operation. You do that for six or seven weeks and you go in and do a stand downâ€”get whatever was breaking down fixed back up and go back and do it again. And I re- enlisted over there, and I re-enlisted for orders. Because by that time, I had become kind of brainwashed and I wanted to go in-country and do in-country duty. That was a six-year enlistment. I was stationed in Bombay, between Bungtao, on the coast of Saigon. The Nabai River comes from several sources. They kind of come together around Benwah. The river actually goes around Saigon. One of the sources of the Nabai is the Sai Gon (two words) River. I don't even know what it means. (Right now it means Ho Chi Min city). I went in-country, and my first night in-country, I caught the plane. I went to some special training in San Francisco and then I went to the air force base thereâ€”Travis Air Force Base. It was a civilian contract to take the guys over. And I was by myself. I came in as a replacement because the unit was already there. But the Navy did not have that policy that the Army had. We were attached to a unit and that was our unit. That's all we could do. DOR (date of rotation)â€”it's a date, something, rotation, out stateside, or something. What's the other one, CONUS? There are a lot of little things like that. And then, after in-country, dress blues came in too. They had no idea I was coming; nobody was there to reach me. It was so hot, it was so blazing hot, that I had to go to the restroom and change into some cotton dungarees. And I got out and said, I'm in the Navy; you guys know where I'm supposed to go? There was a truck out thereâ€”navy guys. They said, Why don't you come with us, and they took me down to the in/out processing station called Inapolis, which is on Plantation road, which is about a mile or two into Saigon. My first night was guard duty, so my first experience was coming down to do guard duty, which I didn't know we had to doâ€¦cause I really was not orientated like the army guys. I was a navy guy trained in the fleet; that was my job. Now, all of a sudden, I come down and he says, You my relief? and I said yeah. There was a black navy chief there. I said, What do I do? He said, You take this, took off his flack jacket and handed me a flack jacket and I put that on. He said, Take this; he gave me a helmet, and I put it on. And he gave me a shotgun and he said, Ya know how to use that? and I said yeah, and he says, If anybody acts funny, blow them up. That was my orders. So, here we are, sitting behind the net, chicken wire and sandbags, which you never noticed when you came in. And in four hours, I just tried to figure out who was acting funny. Who were they gonna blow up? These guys were coming behind me with Coke cans, they didn't have the pull-tabs back then, pop-top cans. So you needed an opener. Surprisingly enough, those Coke cans, what they used to do is carry these cans around disguised hand grenades and pull them out and throw them at you. There were a couple of guys down there flipping these, looking at us. I had the shotgun trained on them. My second night, I became in charge of the watch. So now I was upstairs on the second deck, and I was in charge of the watch from midnight to 3:30 or 3:45 in the morning . I came in, and I said what do I do? There was this first class Jr; You sit here and wait for the guys to come in and check in, and if there was any problems, you handle it. I said okay, I guess I could do that. Well, about a half hour into the watch this young black guy comes in to the desk. The desk is at the top of this flight of stairs and it goes down, which is the main entrance, which is guarded by these four guys with shotguns, hand grenades and flack jackets. I had done that the night before. Now I was in charge of the watch, because I was experienced. And we also had three M-16 machine guns on the roof with two men for each one, plus four guys with M-16s on the roof. It was only, like, a two story building. It had been a motel on Plantation Road prior to our entrance in the war. And I'm sitting there, just playing with my pencil. This young black guy comes walking in and says there's something wrong with my weapon. I said, What's wrong with it? He said, It's jammed. I said, What the hell did you get it jammed for; it's not supposed to be loaded. He said, I know that, but I got nervous. I said, Okay, have you ever fired one of these before? I hadn't, either. I had experience with M-14s and M-1s. But they gave us M-16s at that site. I said, Okay, because I knew enough that I was able to strip it and put it back together and hand it back to him. And I said, Whenever something happens, don't put a round in here until something happens, because I don't want you to kill anybody or blow your head off. I set him up to do that because basically, all weapons operate the same. The M-16 was complex, because an M-14 had seven moving parts and the M-16 had 21 moving parts. But it was a much better weapon for a soldier because of its abilities to do lots of different things that an M-14 couldn't do. One, it weighed two-thirds as much, even fully loaded. Anyway, I handed it back to him and said, Go up there and don't worry; something's going to happen so fast that you're not going to be able to react anyway. Here it was, my second day; I'm already a sergeant. I was an E-5, a petty officer in the fleet, coming in and doing an Army sergeant's job. But I spent a year in the pier before I went into the Navy. So I know about weapons. I was in an FO (Foreign Observer), so I know about [weapons]. I can field strip an M-1, M-14, 45. I know how to call in rounds. So, I already had actually had winter training in Alaska, which is in adverse conditions. That's what the National Guard in Alaska did; they were winter forces. They were the first line of defense against the Russians when they came over through Siberia. So I knew something. Plus, I'd hunted and fished in Alaska. So I wasn't afraid of weapons, or they weren't weapons then. They became my best tools, and when we trained in Alaska with Company B, which is a weapons infantry, we actually went out into the rainforest and did our boot trainingâ€”how to take cover, cleaning your weapons. I hadn't even gone to boot camp, and I had already been out in the field training with this unit, which was supposedly seeing some of the more Korean Vets. So our guys were Korean and WWII guys. I wasn't dumb; I was inexperienced in terms of actual combat experience. Then about an hour after I sent that kid back up, another kid comes down, a young white guy, and he said, Hey, there's a guy up on the roof and he's crazy. He's got an M-16; he's got it loaded, and he's pointing it at everybody and he's saying, "Chuck is coming; Chuck is coming." Well, this is from a guy who had been there; he was in out-processing. I said, Don't worry about it; we can get him down. So we went out, and it was like a (lanai) with a ladder like this. The lanai was only about four or five feet. It was on the second floor, and as I got to the bottom of the ladder, he was up there. And he said, Hey. They're coming. They're coming. I said, Who's coming? The VC are coming. I said, If the VCs were coming, we'd already be engaged. He says, Oh, no no no no. Not really. I said, Yeah. If the VCs were coming, we'd already be engaged. We'd already be firing at these guys, and we'd be firing at them. He said, Ya think so? I says, I'm pretty sure. Why don't you gimme your piece, because they're not coming. If they were coming, we'd be dead already. He said, Man, ya think so? I said, Yeah, I'm pretty sure. (And I wasn't pretty sure.) So hand me down your piece. I came up the ladder about four or five steps and said, Gimme your piece. He handed it to me by the barrel; he had the grip. So I grabbed the barrel with this clown on the other end. I pulled it down. I dropped the magazine out of it and cleared the round that he put in. I put it on safety and put the round back in the magazine and put it back in, and said, Come on down. I knew he was going out of the country, and I said, We're relieving you of your watch, so you can go to bed so that you can get out of here tomorrow. And he said, Yes, sir. And to the guy that came down, I said, Why don't you take him to his ratâ€”I know who his relief isâ€”and bring him up here fifteen minutes early so that we can have somebody else up there. He did and the guy came out and gave him the piece and gave him instructions. The next night I was drunk. I had already been psychologically in it. And I was always looking over my shoulder from that moment on. So I spent another four days there before I was shipped out, which is basically where I worked on boats. So I was on security detail, which is basically where we did the river security, which we moved up around the river at our point. And then we had the village security. We had our craft; some of them were riverboats and some of them weren't. But because of the Vietnamese process, we also had an outer circle of Vietnamese. And one night they fired on us. Guys were blowing the bottoms out of boats all the time. I mean, grenades were going off constantly; that was part of our security protocol. It was just a hairy year and a half of security detail, patrol detail, and village patrol detailâ€”where you're basically a cop. There were gunfights all the time in the villageâ€¦people dying all the time. You got hit a few times. Dead bodies floating down the river all the time. Guys drowning themselves in the river all the time. Shooting barracks up with M-16s. It was like lunacy. Total chaos. It was just a constant alertness. I remember one time I went to Saigon to make a call home; I went in, and I was carrying a .45 and my buddy was carrying a .45. So we decided to stop by the Continental Hotel; we were going to eat. Because we heard they had good food there. We went in there, and we were going to go in, and they said, How many MPs are there? And they came up to us and said, I'm sorry gentlemen, but I've got to take your weapons. I said, I'm not giving up my weapon. And he says, You got to give us your weapon if you're coming in here. And I said, Well, we're not coming in here, then. Even if it was a .45, because there was shootings and bombings all the time in Saigon and you didn't wanna be caught without it. And there were U.S. military vehicles all the time. One guy from Alaska got killed the day before I came in. I didn't know it. I heard about it when I came in. Helicopter crashes, dead bodies all the time. Body parts on the street, around the rivers all the time. Anyway, I told the MP, I'm not going to give up my weapon. He said, Well, you know, you'll be okay if you give us your weapon. You're back in the building, and we're out here and we're armed, and if you need it, you can come up and get it. And we said okay and took it off and went in and ate. And one day I got the duty to drive in some guys that were rotating out. Their enlistment was up, or something. I went into town, and I had an M-16 that time. So I was running around with an M-16. And you hire people to watch your vehicle so it doesn't get booby-trapped. A bunch of kids will run up and say, Want us to watch your car? Watch car? How much? 500 piece. 500 piece. And I says, Who's doing it? The kids say, Oh. And they'd point over to this six or seven South Vietnamese Army guys and I'd look up and they'd say, We've got it. So, somebody was watching your vehicle. And you couldn't trust them, because half of them switch coats at night. But the kids seemed to be fairly honest; you could trust them. But some of them, they used them a lot. They were playing the kids all the time. But I got back to the base and the next day, a guy from Alaska who was on that base too, went in and his window rolled down on the shotgun side, and somebody run up and smashed it, (They won't smash the window, but they'll ram it through so it'll break) and he got burned up. He didn't get a chance to get out. It blew up and burned him to death. And he was from our base. So, it was always on your mind, always on your mind. They were always trying to fuck your brain. I almost killed an officer one night on security detail. There had just been a shootout, so all you could see was flash, and my partner and me had ducked behind water barrels. We ducked behind there when the firing was going on. Because we only had the .45s, the guys with the M16s were up the street a ways. And we waited there 'til it stopped, and they got a hold of these guys and put an end to that. But they when I ducked behind the barrel I had cocked my weapon and chambered a round and let the hammer down. But after that I just left the hammer down and put it back in my holster, so we could kinda continue to patrol. We kinda felt useless because some of the guys that were causing the trouble were better armed than we wereâ€”the Vietnamese guys all the time. See, the Vietnamese guys got to carry these M16s around. M89 is an M16 with an M79 strapped to the bottom of it. An M79 is a 40mm grenade launcher. So these guys were armed all the time, and they were threatening us all the time. They didn't like us, and we didn't trust them and they knew it. Anyway, that guy there looks like my friend George; George was a Marine over there. He's my buddy now. Anyways, I went into this bar that I hung out in, and I had a girlfriend in there. I started talking with her, and I started talking with this other girl. Well, there was this officer sitting there, and he got all bent out of shape because I was in there talking to this girl; said that wasn't my duty. He was drunker than a skunk. He started calling me a dirty Indian, fucking Indian. Before I knew it, I had the .45 cocked back and ready to blow him up, when my partner grabbed my wrist and pulled it down and the young woman ran at me and strapped my arms up. I would have shot, and on the second thought I was gonna just put one between his legs; because in that millisecond when you go from kill to not kill, by that time you know that you'll do it, and there's nothing in the way. You don't have anything to stop you after a year and a half. That's what happened to a lot of guys when they came back; they didn't have anything there. No rational. See, I'm shaking now. And rational is gone. And that fucker said, Go ahead; shoot me. And I almost did. I learned about a year later that, talking to somebody, somebody brought this up who had been in country, and they said that officers only die in combat. So, how would they justify that an officer dies in combat if they had to bring somebody up on charges for killing them. A lot of violence. You get in tune with a lot of violence, and that's what you carry. About two months in, you stop walking behind walls and ducking behind walls and walking next to things. Because by that time you say, if it gets me, it gets me. If I'm the one, I'm the one, and there's nothing you can do about it; so you just kind of unbend your back and start walking straight and upright. How can you tell the difference between the guys who have been in country for awhile and the guys who just come in? The guys who just come in are kind of walking like this. But when you come back home, that's what you start doing again. So it's not your ordinary Vietnam experience. Everybody had a different experience that I talked to. In all the guys that I talked to, there's nothing similar about each experience. Navy guys, Marine guys, Army guys, Chopper guys, Air Force guys, different Navy unitsâ€¦I was with NSA, (Naval Support Activities) MacV but our sister unit and we had guys who went from our unit right into the NAG, Naval Advisory Group. So even though we were technically Naval Advisory capacity/ Naval Support, we were technically advisors during the Vietnamization period, which was the worst time because there were no ethics at that time. You know, there's kind of this code of ethics in the war. Take care of your own, take care of your guys, and take care of the Americans; that all went away. I remember I was out working on the boat at the edge of the river, and at the part of the river I was working on, it's about 200 yards. I was sitting there, and my buddy and me were working on the boat. I was sitting up in the boat, and he was down underneath jiggling. And we had worked on several boats there before. But I was relatively new. He had been there for a while. I said, Geez. Weird bug. I keep on hearing it but I can't see the damn thing. He said, What weird bug is that? I said, I don't know what bug it is but I can hear it. He said, What does it sound like? I said, It goes 'fweee'. What it was was that they were shooting at us from across the river. Because there's so much background noise there, hand grenades and gunfire and stuff going on, you can't tell. All the noise is the same. They were firing at us. The bug was the bullets going by. (Weird bug man, don't try to chase it.) There were three Indians, actually four. I found out last year when I was in Decatur that there was another Indian guy there; he worked that part of the river, but he was not attached to that command. He was an Army guy. And the Army guys had their own boats. So he worked with the Army; they had these MP's that patrolled the river in lieu of the Vietnamization. So, even though most of the 600 or so boats were turned over to the Vietnamese, the Army-held boats and the U.S. Navy-held boats, which weren't quite turned over. And in lieu of the Vietnamization, they had these MP units; plus we were allowed to have our own security. See, we could defend ourselves, but we couldn't aggress. There was this one guy there; he was quick. And his nickname was Frog; he looked just like a frog. And he must have been only about 5'5". He had this really wide face and he had these Muskogee teeth; it's really hard for him. But he was the ugliest Indian I had ever seen. I told him, I said, You're the goddamned ugliest Indian I've ever seen. And he said, Yeah. And the other guy was attached to another command there. One other Indian was attached to my command; he worked on the boats. He did the same work I did; he did security work and he did close security and boat, and he did the river, local river patrol. His name was Glen Tatusas. You know, that movie guy Jack Tatusas; this was his brother, Glen Tatusas. His cousin, Jack Tatutas, is married to my auntie in Fort Packer. He's Creek. So I got to know him only in the last month or so, but he had been there for quite a while we just had not; we had seen each other and nodded at one another, but we never really got to know one another. So I didn't know really who he was until we left and came home. Came back on the same plane and stayed at my sister's house; then he went back up to Canada 'cause he was being discharged. I wish I could think of more. Most of the time it was this kind of this high tension, a few outbreaks, shootouts, firing, and you could see the war coming across. It'll be quiet and all of a sudden a plane would fly overhead at about fifty feet off the ground. You couldn't hear them until they were swooshing by. You couldn't see them; you could see the shadow. All of a sudden going boom, boom, boom, boom. Because they used these flashes to take pictures. They were always taking pictures of the area across the river from us. Then after that, pretty soon the helicopters from the base would start going over there like bugs. They'd look around and check around. Then they'd trace; the green tracer would go up and the red tracer goes down. It was really weird. Then we'd go into two weeks of condition red. I was ruined when I went back to the fleet; I couldn't function any longer except under pressure. I was really good under pressure. Luckily the XO who had been in the country was now on my third shift, and he was on my side; he gave me a lot of breaks. He knew that I had been in country, and he cut me slack. Of course, in my mind I wasn't going to be alive for long. I had gotten too dysfunctional. I couldn't function in a military unit anymore. Actually, I went over again, and the war ended while we were over there, and we went through security for de-mining operations in Hai Phong Harbor, which is the first time I saw North Vietnam offshore. Then I came back, and we didn't do nothing over there except hit quarts. And we came home in September of '73. I remember one day we were working on some equipment and it was a Development and Training Center/Fleet Maintenance and Assistance Group. Well, those had been two organizations, and what they had come to at that time was that they decided that people with six years of sea duty had to go to shore duty. I was saying, Well, is there a fleet place that I can go to? And they said, No, you've got to go to shore duty. I said okay; so I went to shore duty, and I went there for two and a half years and then I got out. I quit drinking in January of '75; I went through a Naval rehab. I remember one day in '74, I blinked in the shop; and when I came back into rational I was beating this piece of equipment with a ball-peen hammer, and I kind of just stopped. I could feel my head going boom, boom, boom, boom. I was in a rage. I had rage. And I looked around, and everybody had moved about twenty feet off and the Chief came up and said Are you okay? I said, Yeah, I'm okay. Then over the years I've had these series of flashbacksâ€¦mostly when I was in limbo. When you go into an organizational limbo, that's when it hits you. It didn't hit me until I left the service, and I was driving up the coast going to Alaska, going home. All of a sudden I turned paranoid, and I couldn't sleep at night. There was this woman riding with me, and I was saying, oh man, I'm gonna have sex riding all the way up the coast. But I was so weird that she wouldn't have anything to do with me. She was kind of trapped with me in my van riding up the coast. There was this weird paranoid guy, you know, couldn't sleep at night, having nightmares. And then I got home and everything was okay. I was home for four months. Worked in a marine shop, in a marina. And then, when I went back down, I felt a little bit better; I wasn't as paranoid, and I could sleep a little bit if I took some sleeping pills. I hit the University of Washington and boom, went away. Then I graduated. Not one day outside of the University of Washington, it started hitting me again. So whenever I went out of structure, I had these. Whenever I had alone time. So as long as I felt secure and content, I was okay. The minute things started to loosen up, I'd start getting paranoid. Funny how that stuff sticks to you like that. I was going to a relationship at that exact time, and I was hobbling around; I couldn't walk because my knees and ankles hurt so bad. It was really weird. I didn't realize what it was; I was so tense and wound up that it was pulling my ligaments. I don't know whether this was lucky or not, but the woman I took up with at the time was into acupuncture and acupressure. So she taught me how to relieve it. Then in '85 she sent me off to the first _____. Didn't take. Two years after that, the relationship was over with because I had gotten weirder and weirder. Matter of fact, I had walked around with a broken arm. I had fallen, and I broke my foot and my arm and didn't know it. I splintered my armâ€¦like a stress fracture. I know it because there's a bump there where it healed. I was so used to being in pain that I didn't even know that I had broken myself. Four years later, I wound up going through my first sweat. But I was in therapy up until that time. There wasn't even a name for it. I remember back in '85 the only word that was coming out was hypervisuals. I was just getting out of that. There's probably a lot of other thingsâ€¦ I think I'm okay; I can sleep all right the last few years. Matter of fact, the other night, I was sleeping well in LA at this cheap hotel a friend had set up for me (because she didn't want me to sleep at her house, because we were only e-mail buddies; she didn't know me). She said that if I ever go to LA, we'd go around and do some things and see some people. So we did that, but we didn't have any sex. Right now, I'm my mother and father's caretaker. I take off two times a year. I do the Canoe Nations project in the summer. Because it's so close to home, every week I have meetings where I do things. But I actually take off for two weeks in July. And then I do this in October, November. These are my two times off. My brother and sister each take responsibility for a week. In 1988, I had this dream; it was an enlightening dream, and that was seventeen years after I came back from over seas, to the day. I found out later that it was the seventeen-year click. A lot of guys after they return over from overseas, seventeen years later they begin to experience the emergence of the process of the PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder). Up and until that time, you're dealing with the PTSS (Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome). And then it goes into disorder after that, where you basically become dysfunctional. I had my enlightening dream that led to subsequent dreams, where I process through the healing.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">A member of the Apache/Mestizo tribe, Ernie Dogwolf was born August 30, 1947, in Lingo, Wyoming. His parents were migrant workers. He served in the military from 1966 to 1971 (in the U.S. Marine Corps in '68 and '69) in Vietnam, where he worked as a 21/31 artillery mechanic; he also served as Sergeant of the Guard.

      <field name="fulltext">Dogwolf Lovato's Vietnam Narrative Being in Vietnam, you spent a lot of time dreaming of coming home. Wishing. Sitting out there and looking at a hill and imagining that it's your mountain that you're watching. And all you want to do is to go back. I have no bitterness about Vietnam, I just have a lot of sadness. I went because I didn't want my children to go. But unfortunately, war is war, and we're going to continue to have war. How do we stop it? I don't know. Unstoppable. It's like stopping rivers. We've tried that too. I think that's the difference between Native people and the White man: we understand that we are part of the Earth. Mother Earth is very generous to us. Extremely. It can feed us. It can warm us. Or it can kill us. And it chose to feed us and warm us. We choose to kill it. That is what our young people are taught. The environment is taught in schools but it's not taught like with the Natives. Anglo kids go to school, and they teach them about the environment. But while that young Anglo boy goes home and tells his parents about what he learned about the environment, the Indian young man gets involved in his kiva and practices it. It is his religionâ€”a one-on-one relationship with Mother Earth. He has an intellectual relationship with the Earth. I related more to the Vietnamese people than to the Americans. The way they lived, the way they ate, and the way they survived with next to nothing. I felt a lot of compassion for the Vietnamese people, and I think a lot of people felt that maybe I was too compassionate. But to me, war is a word that I try not to use in my vocabulary. Our people have been in war since the beginning of time. If you look at the history of all people, and I'm not just talking about native people, if you look at the history of all people, war's not good for anybody. I used that philosophy and tried to turn the worst things into the best possible situation. And I did. I learned a lot from the Vietnamese people and they learned from me. I was with a CAP unit for a little bit, not very long, but it was enough to open up my eyes. When I was stationed at Hai Phong Pass, my job was to protect the hill, and I couldn't do it because we sat in the opium dens learning what the Vietnamese culture was all about. That was an experience that felt new for me because I had never done drugs before I went to Vietnam. I sat in the opium dens and listened to Papasans and Mamasans, and when I started hallucinating the people around me were actually my Indian people. The den was very much like it was with my people because of how similar their ways were to of some of our religions, especially in the Native American Church. You had someone that cared for you and somebody that was going to watch over you, so you really depended on that person. People I knew who were in those dens usually went in there to get high. I've learned I used that den to find my inner self. I would say their medicine people taught their elders the same. I found the children in Vietnam to be really joyful. They were no different than any other children, except for the fact that they were subjected to outside influences, mainly the United States. Their first can of Coke: American food. I think those influences hurt the people more than they helped them. You can't change people through war. I feel that what we were doing in Vietnam was trying to change the people, not the government. The Vietnamese people had been at war with the French, and it was obvious that they were very, very intelligent people. You cannot survive if you're not intelligent enough to get away from B-52 bombers that constantly bomb and bomb and bomb and bomb and bomb. Those kinds of things are still on my mind. Not so much the death and destruction, because I didn't let that bother me, though I didn't really suppress it either. I knew it was fact of war. I think what bothered me the most was the sound of war. The guns constantly going off. The talk of war going on. The talk of people. It bothered me that people didn't want to know anybody. Soon I got callused to that, because I didn't want to reach in somebody's pocket and get their identification just to know who they were, or have to tell somebody that if something happens please let my girlfriend know that I love her. I didn't want to do any of that. Looking back, I feel really fortunate for what I learned there, but I'm also saddened about the reasons I was sent. I didn't understand. Being eighteen years old, coming from sitting in the back of a Chevy, making out with some chick, six months later you're out there training to kill people. It's like a bad dream, a joke. I really didn't take it seriously until that big jet landed in Da Nang and I got off the plane there. It reality hit me because of the stink, the mist, the smell of diesel, the generator sounds. All of this is still in my mind. Not so much the destruction, but those elements that you had to live with everydayâ€¦everyday. The smell of the latrine when you lay in your bunk, and the wind came down that way. The smell of the diesel and the generators that created the electricity for your hooch. Another thing that was unique in Vietnam was the compassion that the Vietnamese people really had for the Americans, when we gave compassion back. If you were an asshole, you were going to be assholed. If you were kind to the people, you got that back. Kindness saved my life, simply because I was trusted by them. As other veterans know, we went in there with every will that they were all VC. Maybe that was true, and maybe it wasn't true, but in my experience, I wanted to treat people how I wanted to be treated, even though it was a zone of war. So called word war. I feel very fortunate that I returned. I also feel guilty that I returned. I think this is one of the reasons for what I do here now, and what I have dedicated my life to after railroading. I worked for the railroad for twenty-one years and looked around me and realized I was this $80,000-a-year-man working on the railroads and not being happy. I saw a lot of these guys from either the caboose or from the engine who were homeless, asking me to throw water out there. People in their fatigues asking and begging for water. What a simple commodity. There are a lot of funny things that happened in Vietnam. I enjoyed being Sergeant of the Guard, because in that job I had the liberty to go around to the different outposts. That was the time that you could really get into the black market with the guys (the black market was a little local-yokel thing). Someone wants whiskey; a bottle of whiskey buys me two cartons of cigarettes. Two cartons of cigarettes buys me something else. And pretty soon you end up with a jeep that somebody stole from the Navy. You bring the jeep back over to the bay, and you paint it green, and you put numbers on it and you sell it to a Lieutenant for something. It was all there, and everybody played the game. I didn't think anything was wrong with it because I saw the stuff they destroyed. They would take the rear ends of jeeps and use a torch to cut them in half simply because the engine was blown. There was nothing to fix in the four-cylinder engine. When I was working on small arms, rifles were thrown away when people came in to exchange barrels. Instead of exchanging the barrels, I would issue new M-16's. When I went to Vietnam I had an M-14 and liked it, until they changed over to the AR-15, and pretty soon they gave us the M-16. I enjoyed messing around with the newbies. You had to try to keep your sense of humor. It was a tradition to break somebody in, and it happened to me too. When you were in a perimeter in a secured area, you still had guards. As Sergeant of the Guard, I would go into one specific area where I would stay that night, and a newbie would come by. I would explain to him that he had the first shift, and he would fall asleep. I would have some wire all tied up with a piece of string so that I could rattle the cans. Same old routine. Scared them to death. Told them not to wake me up because sleep was very important, so don't bother me with any off-the-wall stuff. So I'd close my eyes, wait about ten or fifteen minutes, and I'd start rattling the cans. And he'd put his helmet down and say Sergeant, Sergeant, they're coming, they're coming. Sergeant, they're coming. So he'd wake me up and I'd sit up for a little bit, ten or fifteen minutes. Listenâ€¦listenâ€¦nothing. I'd say, Look man, you're hearing things. Please don't wake me up unless you hear something. So, I'd do the same thing, rattle the cans. And wait a little. I'd rattle the cans and make sure he heard something. He'd say, Sergeant, they're coming, they're coming. So I did this about two or three times and finally about the fourth time I said, Man, if you wake me up, I'm going to be very, very pissed. Don't wake me up unless you're absolutely sure you know what's going on. I lay down and waited and rattled the cans, and he didn't know whether to wake me up, and I got it louder and louder. He said Sergeant, they're coming I know they're coming. So I got up and listened again and I was listening and I'll be goddamned if them cans didn't rattle without me pulling the strings. The next thing you know we sent up the flare and stuff. I wasted a water buffalo. water buffalo on the line. I had that one to explain to the First Sergeant and the First Sergeant's Lieutenant. I just got away with it somehow. It cost the government a little bit of money for that water buffalo. Hell, I tried to go get a piece of steak off it. Those Vietnamese were kind of upset at me though, so I didn't bother with the steak. So, I felt there were some positive aspects of the war. I'm sure that there are other veterans here that view this war as really negative. I view it as positive simply because I'm very fortunate to have a second chance. The Great Spirit gave me an opportunity to work and earn a good living for twenty years with the railroad, but then I knew that I had to do something else, so I began working with the Vietnam Veterans of America. They hired me to do programs, and we've been here nine years, and we're over in funding. We're about a million, little bit over a million and a half. And it's all for helping veterans, non-vets, and their dependents. There's a lot to do in this country for our poor, for our needy. Not only for our Indian people, but for all. Just the humanities of it. If we don't start taking care of ourselves by taking care of Mother Earth, it's not going to matter. There won't be any wars. There won't be humans. There are a lot of things that are happening now that our forefathers predicted, like the warming of the earth, the melting of the waters. That was said long, long ago by our people. That our children would not be listening. But our people are not known philosophers. If you really want to see some of the greatest speeches, look at what Geronimo said when he addressed Congress. Look at what the Nez Pearce said. Sitting Bull. If you look at those, there's nothing that touches that. So maybe they could call us primitive, but I would use the word compassionate. There are a lot of stories of Vietnam Veterans being rejected by their culture. We weren't received that way in our own communities. We were well-received, but with minimal honors. We weren't really received, because we never left. We're just welcomed back. We're honored all the time. We're honored in powwows. But powwows are a strange thing to our people, because they are more of a northern plains thing. The greatest thrill to a young man is to become a warrior and get status within the tribe. That's our ultimate goal. The sad thing about becoming a warrior these days is they're no longer a counting coup. It's got to be a war. So, how do we get our young ones to be warriors without killing them? I don't feel bitter about anybody that didn't go. I'm saddened for those that went to Canada. But I can assure you I don't know of one Native person that went to Canada, except that he lived there anyway. My people are from Canada. I feel strongly that our Indian people have to learn from this war and they have to learn that being a warrior is really not as important as having a son or a daughter, and watching their sons give them children and grandchildren. There are a lot of men out there that will never know their grandchildren. I'm the fortunate one. I've got nine grand babies. An old, old Apache man told me the story of the Spanish coming into his great-grandfather's community. Being Christianized. A culture has its ways of conducting marriage. They said one man couldn't have all these wives. Pick one wife. And he performed what we call missionary relations. So the Apaches, we figure we have been through four or five hundred different changes, this will be fairly easy. We went along with it for a while. We survived without religion for hundreds of years, thousands. Then all of a sudden somebody comes to save us because our ways of saving ourselves are all wrong, though we had done it for several thousands of years before. Now look at what's happening today, all of a sudden everybody wants to study our religion. Well, what do you do in those kivas? What do you do with that peyote? They have the drug mentality instead of the soul mentality. If people were really to take Indian religion to heart, and Indian people would teach their religion to those who are sincere. The Indian religion is simple; it is real basic, like the penitents. The penitents beat themselves. In a sense, so do we. We suffer with our soul, in our sweats, in our ceremonies, in our runnings, in our bare-feet running. It is a form of humbling ourselves to this Mother Earth. This is how weak we really are. How big are we when that little grain of salt has been here longer than we have? My dust will someday cover that little rock, and eventually the wind will blow my dust away, and that little rock will come up for the next generation. Look at the mountains. Can we create mountains? No. All we can do is destroy them. Can we destroy the Earth? Yes, we can. We're doing it through pollution, killing the ozone layer. Our people never did that. Our people respected the Earth, the Sun, the Moon, the four directions, the winds, the ground. We moved when the ground wasn't fertile. We knew when the Mother Earth had to reseed itself. We're all fortunate. If you're breathing, you're fortunate. Just understanding that the key to survival of this earth is compassion. And I don't say that we have to agree with everybody, because we all have minds and we all disagree. I don't have to get violent to disagree. It doesn't mean that my opinion is the only opinion and that it should be accepted by everyone. It is for people that give, both spiritually and physically. On the spiritual side I taught the Vietnamese how close they were to our religion, especially in the opium dens. And when I talk about opium dens, don't think that you sat there and sucked up all the opium, and you got yourself silly. They didn't do that. It was a form of meditation to them. It was like a powwow, or after the sweats when they feed you and you get all that you can eat. I shared that kind of thing with them. Teaching one culture to another culture is a very, very difficult task. Even harder than trying to teach it is really trying to understand the other culture and how they feel because of the language barrier. But the mannerisms, the religions in Vietnam were all very, very basic like Native peoples'. They weren't that far apart. When I worked the yards in Albuquerque, I'd always go talk to these people that were homeless under the bridges. I came to realize that they were cut from the same block I was. They were veterans that couldn't survive back home, simply because of the structure and discipline that the military gave us. When the military released us, there was no structure in release, and you were just thrown back into the environment that you'd left and forgotten. Your loved ones loved you but they still questioned, why did you kill? Why didn't you just come home? Well, that's easy for somebody to say but it was really difficult for an Indian man or any person to say that what they were doing was not right. If my government says it was right, it was right. So I went with it. But having the knowledge that I have now, I know that we were wrong, as a government and as a unit, as people of the United States. And not just as Indian people. I'm talking about people in general. I feel that Vietnam was a political war, even though I denied it at the time. I read McNamara's book, which people who are interested in this subject should read, and it had a lot of influence on me. After reading that book and reminiscing and looking back about what I've said and watching the homeless off the train, now I believe that they were part of the one hundred thousand men who were drafted simply because a lot of them were illiterate. This wasn't just Indian people that it was happening to; they just chose everybody. The highest rate of people that went to Vietnam were Hispanics. I don't speak too fondly of the things that I did to hurt people over there. Even though people say it was war. It's still a feeling inside a person that we're not taught to take lives. In our old ways before the white man came, counting coup was a great, great way of becoming a champion. When the white man came in and presented his firearms to our people, not only did we kill the white men, but we also started killing ourselves. The shame of not being able to take coup is still here to this day. The people that were out to really hurt anybody were just taught to protect, and I feel that's the attitude that I took in Vietnam. I felt that I had to protect myself. I step back and analyze at the age of fifty or fifty-one now; I look back and see how wasted my youth was. They say that it was only two years out of your youth. But the sounds are still there, the smells are still there, the criticisms from other people, negative or positive, are still there. The misunderstanding of the war is still there. Our kids don't even know what a POW/MIA flag is. So I go to schools and speak on that issue, and I'm surprised that I've even had people ask me, Is that a gang or what? Where were we with all this? What was the benefit of all this? Well, I benefit by it because I've learned, and what I've learned I can pass onto my children. I would venture to say that I am proud to be a citizen of the United States; I am proud to serve my president. I am also proud to serve as a Native. But I'm saddened that my government failed to recognize the humanities, not only for us, but for the Vietnamese. I'm saddened by our government and the compassion that it did not have for our people or for the Vietnamese people.</field>
