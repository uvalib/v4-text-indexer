      <field name="heading_text">SANTA FILOMENA.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">WHENE'ER a noble deed is wrought, Whene'er is spoken a noble thought, Our hearts, in glad surprise, To higher levels rise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The tidal wave of deeper souls Into our inmost being rolls, And lifts us unawares Out of all meaner cares.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Honor to those whose words or deeds Thus help us in our daily needs, And by their overflow Raise us from what is low!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thus thought I, as by night I read Of the great army of the dead, The trenches cold and damp, The starved and frozen camp,—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The wounded from the battle-plain, In dreary hospitals of pain, The cheerless corridors, The cold and stony floors.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Lo! in that house of misery A lady with a lamp I see Pass through the glimmering gloom And flit from room to room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And slow, as in a dream of bliss, The speechless sufferer turns to kiss Her shadow, as it falls Upon the darkening walls.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As if a door in heaven should be Opened, and then closed suddenly, The vision came and went, The light shone and was spent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On England's annals, through the long Hereafter of her speech and song, That light its rays shall cast From portals of the past.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A lady with a lamp shall stand In the great history of the land, A noble type of good, Heroic womanhood.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nor even shall be wanting here The palm, the lily, and the spear, The symbols that of yore Saint Filomena bore.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE ROMMANY GIRL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE sun goes down, and with him takes The coarseness of my poor attire; The fair moon mounts, and aye the flame Of gypsy beauty blazes higher.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pale northern girls! you scorn our race; You captives of your air-tight halls, Wear out in-doors your sickly days, But leave us the horizon walls.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And if I take you, dames, to task, And say it frankly without guile, Then you are gypsies in a mask, And I the lady all the while.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If, on the heath, under the moon, I court and play with paler blood, Me false to mine dare whisper none,— One sallow horseman knows me good.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Go, keep your cheek's rose from the rain, For teeth and hair with shopmen deal; My swarthy tint is in the grain, The rocks and forest know it real.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The wild air bloweth in our lungs, The keen stars twinkle in our eyes, The birds gave us our wily tongues, The panther in our dances flies.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You doubt we read the stars on high, Natheless we read your fortunes true; The stars may hide in the upper sky, But without glass we fathom you.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE CHARTIST'S COMPLAINT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DAY! hast thou two faces, Making one place two places? One, by humble farmer seen, Chill and wet, unlighted, mean, Useful only, triste and damp, Serving for a laborer's lamp? Have the same mists another side, To be the appanage of pride, Gracing the rich man's wood and lake, His park where amber mornings break, And treacherously bright to show His planted isle where roses glow? O Day! and is your mightiness A sycophant to smug success? Will the sweet sky and ocean broad Be fine accomplices to fraud? O Sun! I curse thy cruel ray! Back, back to chaos, harlot Day!</field>
      <field name="heading_text">DAYS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DAUGHTERS of Time, the hypocritic Days, Muffled and dumb, like barefoot dervishes, And marching single in an endless file, Bring diadems and fagots in their hands. To each they offer gifts, after his will,— Bread, kingdoms, stars, or sky that holds them all. I, in my pleached garden, watched the pomp, Forgot my morning wishes, hastily Took a few herbs and apples, and the Day Turned and departed silent. I, too late, Under her solemn fillet saw the scorn.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">BRAHMA.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IF the red slayer think he slays, Or if the slain think he is slain, They know not well the subtle ways I keep, and pass, and turn again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Far or forgot to me is near, Shadow and sunlight are the same, The vanished gods to me appear, And one to me are shame and fame.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They reckon ill who leave me out; When me they fly, I am the wings; I am the doubter and the doubt, And I the hymn the Brahmin sings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The strong gods pine for my abode, And pine in vain the sacred Seven; But thou, meek lover of the good! Find me, and turn thy back on heaven.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE GIFT OF TRITEMIUS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TRITEMIUS of Herbipolis one day, While kneeling at the altar's foot to pray, Alone with God, as was his pious choice, Heard from beneath a miserable voice,— A sound that seemed of all sad things to tell, As of a lost soul crying out of hell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thereat the Abbot rose, the chain whereby His thoughts went upward broken by that cry, And, looking from the casement, saw below A wretched woman, with gray hair aflow, And withered hands stretched up to him, who cried For alms as one who might not be denied.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She cried: "For the dear love of Him who gave His life for ours, my child from bondage save, My beautiful, brave first-born, chained with slaves In the Moor's galley, where the sun-smit waves Lap the white walls of Tunis!" "What I can I give," Tritemius said,—"my prayers." "O man Of God!" she cried, for grief had made her bold, "Mock me not so; I ask not prayers, but gold; Words cannot serve me, alms alone suffice; Even while I plead, perchance my first-born dies!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Woman!" Tritemius answered, "from our door None go unfed; hence are we always poor. A single soldo is our only store. Thou hast our prayers; what can we give thee more?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Give me," she said, "the silver candlesticks On either side of the great crucifix; God well may spare them on His errands sped, Or He can give you golden ones instead."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then said Tritemius, "Even as thy word, Woman, so be it; and our gracious Lord, Who loveth mercy more than sacrifice, Pardon me if a human soul I prize Above the gifts upon His altar piled! Take what thou askest, and redeem thy child."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But his hand trembled as the holy alms He laid within the beggar's eager palms; And as she vanished down the linden shade, He bowed his head and for forgiveness prayed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So the day passed; and when the twilight came He rose to find the chapel all a-flame, And, dumb with grateful wonder, to behold Upon the altar candlesticks of gold!</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE ORIGIN OF DIDACTIC POETRY</field>
      <field name="fulltext">WHEN wise Minerva still was young And just the least romantic, Soon after from Jove's head she flung That preternatural antic, 'Tis said to keep from idleness Or flirting,—those twin curses,— She spent her leisure, more or less, In writing po—, no, verses.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">How nice they were! to rhyme with far A kind star did not tarry; The metre, too, was regular As schoolboy's dot and carry; And full they were of pious plums, So extra-super-moral,— For sucking Virtue's tender gums Most tooth-enticing coral.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A clean, fair copy she prepares, Makes sure of moods and tenses, With her own hand,—for prudence spares A man-(or woman) -uensis; Complete, and tied with ribbons proud, She hinted soon how cosy a Treat it would be to read them loud After next day's Ambrosia.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Gods thought not it would amuse So much as Homer's Odyssees, But could not very well refuse The properest of Goddesses; So all sat round in attitudes Of various dejection, As with a hem! the queen of prudes Began her grave prelection.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the first pause Zeus said, "Well sung!— I mean—ask Phoebus,— he knows." Says Phoebus, "Zounds! a wolf's among Admetus's merinos! Fine! very fine! but I must go; They stand in need of me there; Excuse me!" snatched his stick, and so Plunged down the gladdened ether.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With the next gap, Mars said, "For me Don't wait,—naught could be finer; But I'm engaged at half-past three,— A fight in Asia Minor!" Then Venus lisped, "How very thad! It rainth down there in torrinth; But I mutht go, becauthe they've had A thacrifithe in Corinth!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then Bacchus,—"With those slamming doors I lost the last half dist—(hic!) Mos' bu'ful se'ments! what's the Chor's? My voice shall not be missed—(hic!)" His words woke Hermes; "Ah!" he said, "I so love moral theses!" Then winked at Hebe, who turned red, And smoothed her apron's creases.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Just then Zeus snored,—the Eagle drew His head the wing from under; Zeus snored,—o'er startled Greece there flew The many-volumed thunder; Some augurs counted nine,—some, ten,— Some said, 'twas war,—some, famine,— And all, that other-minded men Would get a precious —.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Proud Pallas sighed, "It will not do; Against the Muse I've sinned, oh!" And her torn rhymes sent flying through Olympus's back window. Then, packing up a peplus clean, She took the shortest path thence, And opened, with a mind serene, A Sunday-school in Athens.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The verses? Some, in ocean swilled, Killed every fish that bit to 'em; Some Galen caught, and, when distilled, Found morphine the residuum; But some that rotted on the earth Sprang up again in copies, And gave two strong narcotics birth,— Didactic bards and poppies.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Years after, when a poet asked The Goddess's opinion, As being one whose soul had basked In Art's clear-aired dominion,— "Discriminate," she said, "betimes; The Muse is unforgiving; Put all your beauty in your rhymes, Your morals in your living."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">SONNET.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Maple puts her corals on in May, While loitering frosts about the lowlands cling, To be in tune with what the robins sing, Plastering new log-huts 'mid her branches gray; But when the Autumn southward turns away, Then in her veins burns most the blood of Spring, And every leaf, intensely blossoming, Makes the year's sunset pale the set of day. O Youth unprescient, were it only so With trees you plant, and in whose shade reclined, Thinking their drifting blooms Fate's coldest snow, You carve dear names upon the faithful rind, Nor in that vernal stem the cross foreknow That Age may bear, silent, yet unresigned!</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE WIND AND STREAM.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A BROOK came stealing from the ground; You scarcely saw its silvery gleam Among the herbs that hung around The borders of that winding stream,— A pretty stream, a placid stream, A softly gliding, bashful stream.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A breeze came wandering from the sky, Light as the whispers of a dream; He put the o'erhanging grasses by, And gayly stooped to kiss the stream,— The pretty stream, the flattered stream, The shy, yet unreluctant stream.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The water, as the wind passed o'er, Shot upward many a glancing beam, Dimpled and quivered more and more, And tripped along a livelier stream,— The flattered stream, the simpering stream, The fond, delighted, silly stream.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Away the airy wanderer flew To where the fields with blossoms teem, To sparkling springs and rivers blue; And left alone that little stream,— The flattered stream, the cheated stream, The sad, forsaken, lonely stream.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">That careless wind no more came back; He wanders yet the fields, I deem; But on its melancholy track Complaining went that little stream,— The cheated stream, the hopeless stream, The ever murmuring, moaning stream.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE GOLDEN MILE-STONE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[The Milliarium Aureum , or Golden Mile-Stone, was a gilt marble pillar in the Forum at Rome, from which, as a central point, the great roads of the empire diverged through the several gates of the city, and the distances were measured.]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LEAFLESS are the trees; their purple branches Spread themselves abroad, like reefs of coral Rising silent In the Red Sea of the winter sunset.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From the hundred chimneys of the village, Like the Afreet in the Arabian story, Smoky Columns Tower aloft into the air of amber.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the window winks the flickering fire-light; Here and there the lamps of evening glimmer, Social watch-fires, Answering one another through the darkness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the hearth the lighted logs are glowing, And, like Ariel in the cloven pine-tree, For its freedom Groans and sighs the air imprisoned in them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By the fireside there are old men seated, Seeing ruined cities in the ashes, Asking sadly Of the Past what it can ne'er restore them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By the fireside there are youthful dreamers, Building castles fair with stately stairways, Asking blindly Of the Future what it cannot give them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By the fireside tragedies are acted In whose scenes appear two actors only, Wife and husband, And above them God, the sole spectator.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By the fireside there are peace and comfort, Wives and children, with fair, thoughtful faces, Waiting, watching For a well-known footstep in the passage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Each man's chimney is his Golden Mile-Stone,— Is the central point from which he measures Every distance Through the gateways of the world around him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In his farthest wanderings still he sees it; Hears the talking flame, the answering night-wind, As he heard them When he sat with those who were, but are not.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Happy he whom neither wealth nor fashion, Nor the march of the encroaching city, Drives an exile From the hearth of his ancestral homestead!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We may build more splendid habitations, Fill our rooms with paintings and with sculptures, But we cannot Buy with gold the old associations.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">SKIPPER IRESON'S RIDE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">OF all the rides since the birth of time, Told in story or sung in rhyme,— On Apuleius's Golden Ass, Or one-eyed Calendar's horse of brass, Witch astride of a human back, Islam's prophet on Al-Borak,— The strangest ride that ever was sped Was Ireson's out from Marblehead! Old Floyd Ireson, for his hard heart, Tarred and feathered and carried in a cart By the women of Marblehead!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Body of turkey, head of owl, Wings a-droop like a rained-on fowl, Feathered and ruffled in every part, Captain Ireson stood in the cart. Scores of women, old and young, Strong of muscle, and glib of tongue, Pushed and pulled up the rocky lane, Shouting and singing the shrill refrain: "Here's Flud Oirson, fur his horrd horrt, Torr'd an' futherr'd an corr'd in a corrt By the women o' Morble'ead!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Girls in bloom of cheek and lips, Wrinkled scolds with hands on hips, Wild-eyed, free-limbed, such as chase Bacchus round some antique vase, Brief of skirt, with ankles bare, Loose of kerchief and loose of hair, With conch-shells blowing and fish-horns' twang, Over and over the Maenads sang: "Here's Flud Oirson, fur his horrd horrt, Torr'd an' futherr'd an' corr'd in a corrt By the women o' Morble'ead!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Small pity for him!—He sailed away From a leaking ship in Chaleur Bay,— Sailed away from a sinking wreck, With his own town's-people on her deck! "Lay by! lay by!" they called to him. Back he answered, "Sink or swim! Brag of your catch of fish again!" And off he sailed through the fog and rain! Old Floyd Ireson, for his hard heart, Tarred and feathered and carried in a cart By the women of Marblehead!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Image of the first page of the poem, showing indentation of lines</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fathoms deep in dark Chaleur That wreck shall lie forevermore. Mother and sister, wife and maid, Looked from the rocks of Marblehead Over the moaning and rainy sea, Looked for the coming that might not be! What did the winds and the sea-birds say Of the cruel captain who sailed away?— Old Floyd Ireson, for his hard heart, Tarred and feathered and carried in a cart By the women of Marblehead!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Through the street, on either side, Up flew windows, doors swung wide; Sharp-tongued spinsters, old wives gray, Treble lent the fish-horn's bray. Sea-worn grandsires, cripple-bound, Hulks of old sailors run aground, Shook head, and fist, and hat, and cane, And cracked with curses the hoarse refrain: "Here's Flud Oirson, fur his horrd horrt, Torr'd an' futherr'd an corr'd in a corrt By the women o' Morble'ead!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sweetly along the Salem road Bloom of orchard and lilac showed. Little the wicked skipper knew Of the fields so green and the sky so blue. Riding there in his sorry trim, Like an Indian idol glum and grim, Scarcely he seemed the sound to hear Of voices shouting far and near: "Here's Flud Oirson, fur his horrd horrt, Torr'd an' futherr'd an' corr'd in a corrt By the women o' Morble'ead!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hear me, neighbors!" at last he cried,— "What to me is this noisy ride? What is the shame that clothes the skin, To the nameless horror that lives within? Waking or sleeping, I see a wreck And hear a cry from a reeling deck! Hate me and curse me,—I only dread The hand of God and the face of the dead!" Said old Floyd Ireson, for his hard heart, Tarred and feathered and carried in a cart By the women of Marblehead!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then the wife of the skipper lost at sea Said, "God has touched him!—why should we?" Said an old wife mourning her only son, "Cut the rogue's tether and let him run!" So with soft relentings and rude excuse, Half scorn, half pity, they cut him loose, And gave him cloak to hide him in, And left him alone with his shame and sin. Poor Floyd Ireson, for his hard heart, Tarred and feathered and carried in a cart By the women of Marblehead!</field>
      <field name="heading_text">MY PORTRAIT GALLERY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">OFT round my hall of portraiture I gaze, By Memory reared, the artist wise and holy, From stainless quarries of deep-buried days. There, as I muse in soothing melancholy, Your faces glow in more than mortal youth, Companions of my prime, now vanished wholly,— The loud, impetuous boy, the low-voiced maiden. Ah, never master that drew mortal breath Can match thy portraits, just and generous Death, Whose brush with sweet regretful tints is laden! Thou paintest that which struggled here below Half understood, or understood for woe, And, with a sweet forewarning, Mak'st round the sacred front an aureole glow Woven of that light that rose on Easter morning.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CATAWBA WINE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THIS song of mine Is a Song of the Vine, To be sung by the glowing embers Of wayside inns, When the rain begins To darken the drear Novembers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is not a song Of the Scuppernong, From warm Carolinian valleys,— Nor the Isabel And the Muscadel That bask in our garden alleys,—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nor the red Mustang, Whose clusters hang O'er the waves of the Colorado, And the fiery flood Of whose purple blood Has a dash of Spanish bravado.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For richest and best Is the wine of the West, That grows by the Beautiful River; Whose sweet perfume Fills all the room With a benison on the giver.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And as hollow trees Are the haunts of bees Forever going and coming, So this crystal hive Is all alive With a swarming and buzzing and humming.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Very good in their way Are the Verzenay, And the Sillery soft and creamy; But Catawba wine Has a taste more divine, More dulcet, delicious, and dreamy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There grows no vine By the haunted Rhine, By Danube or Guadalquivir, Nor on island or cape, That bears such a grape As grows by the Beautiful River.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Drugged is their juice For foreign use, When shipped o'er the reeling Atlantic, To rack our brains With the fever pains That have driven the Old World frantic.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the sewers and sinks With all such drinks, And after them tumble the mixer! For a poison malign Is such Borgia wine, Or at best but a Devil's Elixir.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While pure as a spring Is the wine I sing, And to praise it, one needs but name it; For Catawba wine Has need of no sign, No tavern-bush to proclaim it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And this Song of the Vine, This greeting of mine, The winds and the birds shall deliver To the Queen of the West, In her garlands dressed, On the banks of the Beautiful River.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">TWO RIVERS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THY summer voice, Musketaquit, Repeats the music of the rain; But sweeter rivers pulsing flit Through thee, as thou through Concord Plain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thou in thy narrow banks art pent: The stream I love unbounded goes Through flood and sea and firmament; Through light, through life, it forward flows.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I see the inundation sweet, I hear the spending of the stream Through years, through men, through nature fleet, Through passion, thought, through power and dream.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Musketaquit, a goblin strong, Of shard and flint makes jewels gay; They lose their grief who hear his song, And where he winds is the day of day.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So forth and brighter fares my stream,— Who drink it shall not thirst again; No darkness stains its equal gleam, And ages drop in it like rain.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">TACKING SHIP OFF SHORE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I. THE weather leech of the topsail shivers, The bowlines strain and the lee shrouds slacken, The braces are taut, the lithe boom quivers, And the waves with the coming squall-cloud blacken.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II. Open one point on the weather bow Is the light-house tall on Fire Island head; There's a shade of doubt on the captain's brow, And the pilot watches the heaving lead.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III. I stand at the wheel and with eager eye To sea and to sky and to shore I gaze, Till the muttered order of "FULL AND BY!" Is suddenly changed to "FULL FOR STAYS!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV. The ship bends lower before the breeze, As her broadside fair to the blast she lays; And she swifter springs to the rising seas, As the pilot calls, "STAND BY FOR STAYS!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">V. It is silence all, as each in his place, With the gathered coils in his hardened hands, By tack and bowline, by sheet and brace, Waiting the watchword impatient stands.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VI. And the light on Fire Island head draws near, As, trumpet-winged, the pilot's shout From his post on the bowsprit's heel I hear, With the welcome call of "READY! ABOUT!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VII. No time to spare! It is touch and go, And the captain growls, "DOWN HELM! HARD DOWN!" As my weight on the whirling spokes I throw, While heaven grows black with the storm-cloud's frown.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VIII. High o'er the knight-heads flies the spray, As we meet the shock of the plunging sea; And my shoulder stiff to the wheel I lay, As I answer, "AYE, AYE, SIR! HA-A-R-D A-LEE!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IX. With the swerving leap of a startled steed The ship flies fast in the eye of the wind, The dangerous shoals on the lee recede, And the headland white we have left behind.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">X. The topsails flutter, the jibs collapse And belly and tug at the groaning cleats, The spanker slats, and the mainsail flaps, And thunders the order, "TACKS AND SHEETS!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XI. 'Mid the rattle of blocks and the tramp of the crew, Hisses the rain of the rushing squall; The sails are aback from clew to clew, And now is the moment for "MAINSAIL, HAUL!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XII. And the heavy yards like a baby's toy By fifty strong arms are swiftly swung; She holds her way, and I look with joy For the first white spray o'er the bulwarks flung.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XIII. "LET GO AND HAUL!" 'Tis the last command, And the head-sails fill to the blast once more; Astern and to leeward lies the land, With its breakers white on the shingly shore.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XIV. What matters the reef, or the rain, or the squall? I steady the helm for the open sea; The first mate clamors, "BELAY THERE, ALL!" And the captain's breath once more comes free.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XV. And so off shore let the good ship fly; Little care I how the gusts may blow, In my fo'castle-bunk in a jacket dry,— Eight bells have struck, and my watch is below.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE SCULPTOR'S FUNERAL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">AMID the aisle, apart, there stood A mourner like the rest; And while the solemn rites were said, He fashioned into verse his mood, That would not be repressed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Why did they bring him home, Bright jewel set in lead? Oh, bear the sculptor back to Rome, And lay him with the mighty dead,— With Adonais, and the rest Of all the young and good and fair, That drew the milk of English breast, And their last sigh in Latian air!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Lay him with Raphael, unto whom Was granted Rome's most lasting tomb; For many a lustre, many an aeon, He might sleep well in the Pantheon, Deep in the sacred city's womb, The smoke and splendor and the stir of Rome.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Lay him 'neath Diocletian's dome, Blessed Saint Mary of the Angels, Near to that house in which he dwelt,— House that to many seemed a home, So much with him they loved and felt. We were his guests a hundred times; We loved him for his genial ways; He gave me credit for my rhymes, And made me blush with praise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ah! there be many histories That no historian writes, And friendship hath its mysteries And consecrated nights; Amid the busy days of pain, Wear of hand, and tear of brain, Weary midnight, weary morn, Years of struggle paid with scorn;— Yet oft amid all this despair, Long rambles in the Autumn days O'er Appian or Flaminian Ways, Bright moments snatched from care, When loose as buffaloes on the wild Campagna We roved and dined on crust and curds, Olives, thin wine, and thinner birds, And woke the echoes of divine Romagna; And then returning late, After long knocking at the Lateran gate, Suppers and nights of gods; and then Mornings that made us new-born men; Rare nights at the Minerva tavern, With Orvieto from the Cardinal's cavern; Free nights, but fearless and without reproof,— For Bayard's word ruled Beppo's roof.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">O Rome! what memories awake, When Crawford's name is said, Of days and friends for whose dear sake That path of Hades unto me Will have no more of dread Than his own Orpheus felt, seeking Eurydice! O Crawford! husband, father, brother Are in that name, that little word! Let me no more my sorrow smother; Grief stirs me, and I must be stirred.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">O Death, thou teacher true and rough! Full oft I fear that we have erred, And have not loved enough; But oh, ye friends, this side of Acheron, Who cling to me to-day, I shall not know my love till ye are gone And I am gray! Fair women with your loving eyes, Old men that once my footsteps led, Sweet children,—much as all I prize, Until the sacred dust of death be shed Upon each dear and venerable head, I cannot love you as I love the dead!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But now, the natural man being sown, We can more lucidly behold The spiritual one; For we, till time shall end, Full visibly shall see our friend In all his hand did mould,— That worn and patient hand that lies so cold!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When on some blessed studious day To my loved Library I wend my way, Amid the forms that give the Gallery grace His thought in that pale poet I shall trace,— Keen Orpheus with his eyes Fixed deep in ruddy hell, Seeking amid those lurid skies The wife he loved so well,— And feel that still therein I see All that was in my Master's thought, And, in that constant hand wherewith he wrought, The eternal type of constancy. Thou marble husband! might there be More of flesh and blood like thee!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Or if, in Music's festive hall, I come to cheat me of my care, Amid the swell, the dying fall, His genius greets me there. O man of bronze! thy solemn air— Best soother of a troubled brain— Floods me with memories, and again As thou stand'st visibly to men, Beloved musician! so once more Crawford comes back that did thy form restore.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">* * * * * *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Well,— requiescat! let him pass! Good mourners, go your several ways! He needs no further rite, nor mass, Nor eulogy, who best could praise Himself in marble and in brass; Yet his best monument did raise, Not in those perishable things That men eternal deem,— The pride of palaces and kings,— But in such works as must avail him there, With Him who, from the extreme Love that was in his breast, Said, "Come, all ye that heavy burdens bear, And I will give you rest!"</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE WEDDING VEIL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DEAR ANNA, when I brought her veil, Her white veil, on her wedding-night, Threw o'er my thin brown hair its folds, And, laughing, turned me to the light.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"See, Bessie, see! you wear for once The bridal veil, forsworn for years!" She saw my face,—her laugh was hushed, Her happy eyes were filled with tears.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With kindly haste and trembling hand She drew away the gauzy mist; "Forgive, dear heart!"—her sweet voice said; Her loving lips my forehead kissed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We passed from out the searching light; The summer night was calm and fair: I did not see her pitying eyes, I felt her soft hand smooth my hair.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her tender love unlocked my heart; 'Mid falling tears, at last I said, "Forsworn indeed to me that veil, Because I only love the dead!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She stood one moment statue-still, And, musing, spake in under-tone, "The living love may colder grow; The dead is safe with God alone!"</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE BUSTS OF GOETHE AND SCHILLER.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THIS is GOETHE, with a forehead Like the fabled front of Jove; In its massive lines the tokens More of majesty than love.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This is SCHILLER, in whose features, With their passionate calm regard, We behold the true ideal Of the high heroic Bard,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Whom the inward world of feeling And the outward world of sense To the endless labor summon, And the endless recompense.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">These are they, sublime and silent, From whose living lips have rung Words to be remembered ever In the noble German tongue;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thoughts whose inspiration, kindling Into loftiest speech or song, Still through all the listening ages Pours its torrent swift and strong.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As to-day in sculptured marble Side by side the Poets stand, So they stood in life's great struggle, Side by side and hand to hand,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the ancient German city, Dowered with many a deathless name, Where they dwelt and toiled together, Sharing each the other's fame:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One till evening's lengthening shadows Gently stilled his faltering lips, But the other's sun at noonday Shrouded in a swift eclipse.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There their names are household treasures, And the simplest child you meet Guides you where the house of Goethe Fronts upon the quiet street;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And, hard by, the modest mansion Where full many a heart has felt Memories uncounted clustering Round the words, "Here Schiller dwelt."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the churchyard both are buried, Straight beyond the narrow gate, In the mausoleum sleeping With Duke Charles in sculptured state.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For the Monarch loved the Poets, Called them to him from afar, Wooed them near his court to linger, And the planets sought the star.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He, his larger gifts of fortune With their larger fame to blend, Living, counted it an honor That they named him as their friend;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dreading to be all-forgotten, Still their greatness to divide, Dying, prayed to have his Poets Buried one on either side.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But this suited not the gold-laced Ushers of the royal tomb, Where the princely House of Weimar Slumbered in majestic gloom.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So they ranged the coffins justly, Each with fitting rank and stamp, And with shows of court precedence Mocked the grave's sepulchral damp.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fitly now the clownish sexton Narrow courtier-rules rebukes; First he shows the grave of Goethe, Schiller's next, and last—the Duke's.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Vainly 'midst these truthful shadows Pride would flaunt her painted wing; Here the Monarch waits in silence, And the Poet is the King!</field>
      <field name="heading_text">DAYLIGHT AND MOONLIGHT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IN broad daylight, and at noon, Yesterday I saw the moon Sailing high, but faint and white, As a school-boy's paper kite.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In broad daylight, yesterday, I read a poet's mystic lay; And it seemed to me at most As a phantom, or a ghost.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But at length the feverish day Like a passion died away, And the night, serene and still, Fell on village, vale, and hill.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then the moon, in all her pride, Like a spirit glorified, Filled and overflowed the night With revelations of her light.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And the poet's song again Passed like music through my brain; Night interpreted to me All its grace and mystery.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">DAYBREAK.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A WIND came up out of the sea, And said, "O mists, make room for me!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It hailed the ships, and cried, "Sail on, Ye mariners! the night is gone!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And hurried landward far away, Crying, "Awake! it is the day!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It said unto the forest, "Shout! Hang all your leafy banners out!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It touched the wood-bird's folded wing, And said, "O bird, awake and sing!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And o'er the farms, "O chanticleer, Your clarion blow! the day is near!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It whispered to the fields of corn, "Bow down, and hail the coming morn!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It shouted through the belfry-tower, "Awake, O bell! proclaim the hour!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It crossed the churchyard with a sigh, And said, "Not yet! in quiet lie!"</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE OLD BURYING-GROUND.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">OUR vales are sweet with fern and rose, Our hills are maple-crowned; But not from them our fathers chose The village burying-ground.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The dreariest spot in all the land To Death they set apart; With scanty grace from Nature's hand, And none from that of Art.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A winding wall of mossy stone, Frost-flung and broken, lines A lonesome acre thinly grown With grass and wandering vines.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Without the wall a birch-tree shows Its drooped and tasselled head; Within, a stag-horned sumach grows, Fern-leafed with spikes of red.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There, sheep that graze the neighboring plain Like white ghosts come and go, The farm-horse drags his fetlock chain, The cow-bell tinkles slow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Low moans the river from its bed, The distant pines reply; Like mourners shrinking from the dead, They stand apart and sigh.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Unshaded smites the summer sun, Unchecked the winter blast; The school-girl learns the place to shun, With glances backward cast.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For thus our fathers testified— That he might read who ran— The emptiness of human pride, The nothingness of man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They dared not plant the grave with flowers, Nor dress the funeral sod, Where, with a love as deep as ours, They left their dead with God.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The hard and thorny path they kept, From beauty turned aside; Nor missed they over those who slept The grace to life denied.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yet still the wilding flowers would blow, The golden leaves would fall, The seasons come, the seasons go, And God be good to all.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Above the graves the blackberry hung In bloom and green its wreath, And harebells swung as if they rung The chimes of peace beneath.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The beauty Nature loves to share, The gifts she hath for all, The common light, the common air, O'ercrept the graveyard's wall.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It knew the glow of eventide, The sunrise and the noon, And glorified and sanctified It slept beneath the moon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With flowers or snow-flakes for its sod, Around the seasons ran, And evermore the love of God Rebuked the fear of man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We dwell with fears on either hand, Within a daily strife, And spectral problems waiting stand Before the gates of life.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The doubts we vainly seek to solve, The truths we know, are one; The known and nameless stars revolve Around the Central Sun.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And if we reap as we have sown, And take the dole we deal, The law of pain is love alone, The wounding is to heal.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Unharmed from change to change we glide, We fall as in our dreams; The far-off terror, at our side, A smiling angel seems.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Secure on God's all-tender heart Alike rest great and small; Why fear to lose our little part, When He is pledged for all?</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE RELIEF OF LUCKNOW.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">OH, that last day in Lucknow fort! We knew that it was the last, That the enemy's lines crept surely on, And the end was coming fast.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To yield to that foe was worse than death, And the men and we all worked on; It was one day more of smoke and roar, And then it would all be done.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was one of us, a corporal's wife, A fair, young, gentle thing, Wasted with fever in the siege, And her mind was wandering.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She lay on the ground, in her Scottish plaid, And I took her head on my knee: "When my father comes hame frae the pleugh," she said, "Oh! then please wauken me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She slept like a child on her father's floor In the flecking of woodbine-shade, When the house-dog sprawls by the open door, And the mother's wheel is staid.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was smoke and roar and powder-stench, And hopeless waiting for death; And the soldier's wife, like a full-tired child, Seemed scarce to draw her breath.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I sank to sleep; and I had my dream Of an English village-lane, And wall and garden;—but one wild scream Brought me back to the roar again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There Jessie Brown stood listening Till a sudden gladness broke All over her face, and she caught my hand And drew me near, as she spoke:—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The Hielanders! Oh! dinna ye hear The slogan far awa? The McGregor's? Oh! I ken it weel; It's the grandest o' them a'!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"God bless thae bonny Hielanders! We're saved! we're saved!" she cried; And fell on her knees; and thanks to God Flowed forth like a full flood-tide.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Along the battery-line her cry Had fallen among the men, And they started back;—they were there to die; But was life so near them, then?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They listened for life; the rattling fire Far off, and the far-off roar, Were all; and the colonel shook his head, And they turned to their guns once more.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But Jessie said, "The slogan's done; But winna ye hear it noo, The Campbells are comin' ? It's no a dream; Our succors hae broken through!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We heard the roar and the rattle afar, But the pipes we could not hear; So the men plied their work of hopeless war, And knew that the end was near.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was not long ere it made its way,— A shrilling, ceaseless sound: It was no noise from the strife afar, Or the sappers under ground.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was the pipes of the Highlanders! And now they played Auld Lang Syne ; It came to our men like the voice of God, And they shouted along the line.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And they wept and shook one another's hands, And the women sobbed in a crowd; And every one knelt down where he stood, And we all thanked God aloud.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">That happy time, when we welcomed them, Our men put Jessie first; And the general gave her his hand, and cheers Like a storm from the soldiers burst.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And the pipers' ribbons and tartans streamed, Marching round and round our line; And our joyful cheers were broken with tears As the pipes played Auld Lang Syne .</field>
      <field name="heading_text">SONNET.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE brave old Poets sing of nobler themes Than the weak griefs which haunt men's coward souls. The torrent of their lusty music rolls Not through dark valleys of distempered dreams, But murmurous pastures lit by sunny streams; Or, rushing from some mountain height of Thought, Swells to strange music, that our minds have sought Vainly to gather from the doubtful gleams Of our more gross perceptions. Oh, their strains Nerve and ennoble Manhood!—no shrill cry, Set to a treble, tells of querulous woe; Yet numbers deep-voiced as the mighty Main's Merge in the ringdove's plaining, or the sigh Of lovers whispering where sweet streamlets flow.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE NEST.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MAY. WHEN oaken woods with buds are pink, And new-come birds each morning sing,— When fickle May on Summer's brink Pauses, and knows not which to fling, Whether fresh bud and bloom again, Or hoar-frost silvering hill and plain,— Then from the honeysuckle gray The oriole with experienced quest Twitches the fibrous bark away, The cordage of his hammock-nest,— Cheering his labor with a note Rich as the orange of his throat. High o'er the loud and dusty road The soft gray cup in safety swings, To brim ere August with its load Of downy breasts and throbbing wings, O'er which the friendly elm-tree heaves An emerald roof with sculptured eaves. Below, the noisy World drags by In the old way, because it must,— The bride with trouble in her eye, The mourner following hated dust: Thy duty, winged flame of Spring, Is but to love and fly and sing. Oh, happy life, to soar and sway Above the life by mortals led, Singing the merry months away, Master, not slave of daily bread, And, when the Autumn comes, to flee Wherever sunshine beckons thee!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PALINODE—DECEMBER. LIKE some lorn abbey now, the wood Stands roofless in the bitter air; In ruins on its floor is strewed The carven foliage quaint and rare, And homeless winds complain along The columned choir once thrilled with song. And thou, dear nest, whence joy and praise The thankful oriole use to pour, Swing'st empty while the north winds chase Their snowy swarms from Labrador: But, loyal to the happy past, I love thee still for what thou wast. Ah, when the Summer graces flee From other nests more dear than thou, And, where June crowded once, I see Only bare trunk and disleaved bough, When springs of life that gleamed and gushed Run chilled, and slower, and are hushed,— I'll think, that, like the birds of Spring, Our good goes not without repair, But only flies to soar and sing Far off in some diviner air, Where we shall find it in the calms Of that fair garden 'neath the palms.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CORNUCOPIA.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THERE'S a lodger lives on the first floor, (My lodgings are up in the garret,) At night and at morn he taketh a horn And calleth his neighbors to share it,— A horn so long, and a horn so strong, I wonder how they can bear it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I don't mean to say that he drinks, For that were a joke or a scandal; But, every one knows it, he night and day blows it;— I wish he'd blow out like a candle! His horn is so long, and he blows it so strong, He would make Handel fly off the handle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By taking a horn I don't hint That he swigs either rum, gin, or whiskey; It's we who drink in his din worse than gin, His strains that attempt to be frisky, But are grievously sad.—A donkey, I add, Is as musical, braying in his key.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It's a puzzle to know what he's at; I could pity him, if it were madness: I never yet knew him to play a tune through, And it gives me more anger than sadness To hear his horn stutter and stammer to utter Its various abortions of badness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At his wide open window he stands, Overlooking his bit of a garden; One can see the great ass at one end of his brass Blaring out, never asking your pardon: This terrible blurting he thinks is not hurting, As long as his own ear-drums harden.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He thinks, I've no doubt, it is sweet, While thus Time and Tune he is flaying; The little house-sparrows feel all through their marrows The jar and the fuss of his playing,— The windows all shaking, the babies all waking, The very dogs howling and baying.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One note out of twenty he hits, And, cheered, blows pianos like fortes . His time is his own. He goes sounding alone, (A sort of Columbus or Cortes,) On a perilous ocean, without any notion Whereabouts in the dim deep his port is.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Like a man late from club, he has lost His key, and around stumbles moping, Touching this, trying that, now a sharp, now a flat, Till he strikes on the note he is hoping, And a terrible blare at the end of the air Shows he's got through at last with his groping.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There,—he's finished,—at least, for a while; He is tired, or come to his senses; And out of his horn shakes the drops that were borne By the winds of his musical frenzies. There's a rest, thank our stars, of ninety-nine bars, Ere the tempest of sound recommences.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When all the bad players are sent Where all their false notes are protested, I am sure that Old Nick will play him a trick, When his bad trump and he are arrested, And down in the regions of Discord's own legions His head with two French horns be crested.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THY PSYCHE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LIKE a strain of wondrous music rising up in cloister dim, Through my life's unwritten measures thou dost steal, a glorious hymn! All the joys of earth and heaven in the singing meet, and flow Richer, sweeter, for the wailing of an undertone of woe. How I linger, how I listen for each mellow note that falls, Clear as chime of angels floating downward o'er the jasper walls!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Every night, when winds are moaning round my chamber by the sea, Thine's the face that through the darkness latest looks with love at me; And I dream, ere thou departest, thou dost press thy lips to mine;— Then I sleep as slept the Immortals after draughts of Hebe's wine! And I clasp thee, out of slumber when the rosy day is born, As the soul, with rapture waking, clasps the resurrection morn.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">'Twas thy soul-wife, 'twas thy Psyche, one uplifted, radiant day, Thou didst call me;—how divinely on thy brow Love's glory lay! Thou my Cupid,—not the boy-god whom the Thespians did adore, But the man, so large, so noble, truer god than Venus bore. I thy Psyche;—yet what blackness in this thread of gold is wove! Thou canst never, never lead me, proud, before the throne of Jove! All the gods might toil to help thee through the longest summer day;— Still would watch the fatal Sisters, spinning in the twilight gray; And their calm and silent faces, changeless looking through the gloom, From eternity, would answer, "Thou canst ne'er escape thy doom!" Couldst thou clasp me, couldst thou claim me, 'neath the soft Elysian skies, Then what music and what odor through their azure depths would rise! Roses all the Hours would scatter, every god would bring us joy, So, in perfect loving blended, bliss would never know alloy!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">O my heart! the vision changes; fades the soft celestial blue; Dies away the rapturous music, thrilling all my pulses through! Lone I sit within my chamber; storms are beating 'gainst the pane, And my tears are falling faster than the chill December rain;— Yet, though I am doomed to linger, joyless, on this earthly shore, Thou art Cupid!—I am Psyche!—we are wedded evermore!</field>
      <field name="heading_text">BEAUTY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FOND lover of the Ideal Fair, My soul, eluded everywhere, Is lapsed into a sweet despair.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Perpetual pilgrim, seeking ever, Baffled, enamored, finding never; Each morn the cheerful chase renewing, Misled, bewildered, still pursuing; Not all my lavished years have bought One steadfast smile from her I sought, But sidelong glances, glimpsing light, A something far too fine for sight, Veiled voices, far off thridding strains, And precious agonies and pains: Not love, but only love's dear wound And exquisite unrest I found.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At early morn I saw her pass The lone lake's blurred and quivering glass; Her trailing veil of amber mist The unbending beaded clover kissed; And straight I hasted to waylay Her coming by the willowy way;— But, swift companion of the Dawn, She left her footprints on the lawn, And, in arriving, she was gone. Alert I ranged the winding shore; Her luminous presence flashed before; The wild-rose and the daisies wet From her light touch were trembling yet; Faint smiled the conscious violet; Each bush and brier and rock betrayed Some tender sign her parting made; And when far on her flight I tracked To where the thunderous cataract O'er walls of foamy ledges broke, She vanished in the vapory smoke.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To-night I pace this pallid floor, The sparkling waves curl up the shore, The August moon is flushed and full; The soft, low winds, the liquid lull, The whited, silent, misty realm, The wan-blue heaven, each ghostly elm, All these, her ministers, conspire To fill my bosom with the fire And sweet delirium of desire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Enchantress! leave thy sheeny height, Descend, be all mine own this night, Transfuse, enfold, entrance me quite! Or break thy spell, my heart restore, And disenchant me evermore!</field>
      <field name="heading_text">BY THE DEAD.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PRIDE that sat on the beautiful brow, Scorn that lay in the arching lips, Will of the oak-grain, where are ye now? I may dare to touch her finger-tips! Deep, flaming eyes, ye are shallow enough; The steadiest fire burns out at last. Throw back the shutters,—the sky is rough, And the winds are high,—but the night is past.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mother, I speak with the voice of a man; Death is between us,—I stoop no more; And yet so dim is each new-born plan, I am feebler than ever I was before,— Feebler than when the western hill Faded away with its sunset gold. Mother, your voice seemed dark and chill, And your words made my young heart very cold.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You talked of fame,—but my thoughts would stray To the brook that laughed across the lane; And of hopes for me,—but your hand's light play On my brow was ice to my shrinking brain; And you called me your son, your only son,— But I felt your eye on my tortured heart To and fro, like a spider, run, On a quivering web;—'twas a cruel art!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But crueller, crueller far, the art Of the low, quick laugh that Memory hears! Mother, I lay my head on your heart; Has it throbbed even once these fifty years? Throbbed even once, by some strange heat thawed? It would then have warmed to her, poor thing, Who echoed your laugh with a cry!—O God, When in my soul will it cease to ring?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Starlike her eyes were,—but yours were blind; Sweet her red lips,—but yours were curled; Pure her young heart,—but yours,—ah, you find This, mother, is not the only world! She came,—bright gleam of the dawning day; She went,—pale dream of the winding-sheet. Mother, they come to me and say Your headstone will almost touch her feet!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You are walking now in a strange, dim land: Tell me, has pride gone with you there? Does a frail white form before you stand, And tremble to earth, beneath your stare? No, no!—she is strong in her pureness now, And Love to Power no more defers. I fear the roses will never grow On your lonely grave as they do on hers!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But now from those lips one last, sad touch,— Kiss it is not, and has never been; In my boyhood's sleep I dreamed of such, And shuddered,—they were so cold and thin! There,—now cover the cold, white face, Whiter and colder than statue stone! Mother, you have a resting-place; But I am weary, and all alone!</field>
      <field name="heading_text">HAPPINESS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">WING-FOOTED! thou abid'st with him That asks it not: but he who hath Watched o'er the waves thy fading path Will never more on ocean's rim, At morn or eve, behold returning Thy high-heaped canvas shoreward yearning: Thou only teachest us the core And inmost meaning of No More, Thou, who first showest us thy face Turned o'er the shoulder's parting grace, And whose sad footprints we can trace Away from every mortal door!</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE STORY OF KARIN. A DANISH LEGEND.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">KARIN the fair, Karin the gay, She came on the morn of her bridal day,—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She came to the mill-pond clear and bright, And viewed hersel' in the morning light.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And oh," she cried, "that my bonny brow May ever be white and smooth as now!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And oh, my hair, that I love to braid, Be yellow in sunshine, and brown in shade!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And oh, my waist, sae slender and fine, May it never need girdle longer than mine!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She lingered and laughed o'er the waters clear, When sudden she starts, and shricks in fear:—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, what is this face, sea laidly old, That looks at my side in the waters cold?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She turns around to view the bank, And the osier willows dark and dank;—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And from the fern she sees arise An aged crone wi' awsome eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ha! ha!" she laughed, "ye're a bonny bride! See how ye'll fare gin the New Year tide!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ye'll wear a robe sae blithely gran', An ell-long girdle canna span.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"When twal-months three shall pass away, Your berry-brown hair shall be streaked wi' gray.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And gin ye be mither of bairnies nine, Your brow shall be wrinkled and dark as mine."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Karin she sprang to her feet wi' speed, And clapped her hands abune her head:—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I pray to the saints and spirits all That never a child may me mither call!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The crone drew near, and the crone she spake:— "Nine times flesh and banes shall ache.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Laidly and awsome ye shall wane Wi' toil, and care, and travail-pain."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Better," said Karin, "lay me low, And sink for aye in the water's flow!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The crone raised her withered hand on high, And showed her a tree that stood hard by.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And take of the bonny fruit," she said, "And eat till the seeds are dark and red.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Count them less, or count them more, Nine times you shall number o'er;—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And when each number you shall speak, Cast seed by seed into the lake."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Karin she ate of the fruit sae fine; 'Twas mellow as sand, and sweet as brine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Seed by seed she let them fall; The waters rippled over all.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But ilka seed as Karin threw, Uprose a bubble to her view,—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Uprose a sigh from out the lake, As though a baby's heart did break.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">* * * * *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Twice nine years are come and gone; Karin the fair she walks her lone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She sees around, on ilka side, Maiden and mither, wife and bride.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wan and pale her bonny brow, Sunken and sad her eyelids now.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Slow her step, and heavy her breast, And never an arm whereon to rest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The old kirk-porch when Karin spied, The postern-door was open wide.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wae's me!" she said, "I'll enter in And shrive me from my every sin."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">'Twas silence all within the kirk; The aisle was empty, chill, and mirk.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The chancel-rails were black and bare; Nae priest, nae penitent was there.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Karin knelt, and her prayer she said; But her heart within her was heavy and dead.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her prayer fell back on the cold gray stone; It would not rise to heaven alone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Darker grew the darksome aisle, Colder felt her heart the while.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wae's me!" she cried, "what is my sin? Never I wronged kith nor kin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But why do I start and quake wi' fear Lest I a dreadful doom should hear?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And what is this light that seems to fall On the sixth command upon the wall?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And who are these I see arise And look on me wi' stony eyes?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A shadowy troop, they flock sae fast The kirk-yard may not hold the last.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Young and old of ilk degree, Bairns, and bairnies' bairns, I see.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All I look on either way, 'Mother, mother!' seem to say.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"'We are souls that might have been, But for your vanity and sin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"'We, in numbers multiplied, Might have lived, and loved, and died,—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"'Might have served the Lord in this,— Might have met thy soul in bliss.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"'Mourn for us, then, while you pray, Who might have been, but never may!'"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thus the voices died away,— "Might have been, but never may!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Karin she left the kirk no more; Never she passed the postern-door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They found her dead at the vesper toll;— May Heaven in mercy rest her soul!</field>
      <field name="heading_text">TELLING THE BEES. *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HERE is the place; right over the hill Runs the path I took; You can see the gap in the old wall still, And the stepping-stones in the shallow brook.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There is the house, with the gate red-barred, And the poplars tall; And the barn's brown length, and the cattle-yard, And the white horns tossing above the wall.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There are the bee-hives ranged in the sun; And down by the brink Of the brook are her poor flowers, weed-o'errun, Pansy and daffodil, rose and pink.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A year has gone, as the tortoise goes, Heavy and slow; And the same rose blows, and the same sun glows, And the same brook sings of a year ago.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There's the same sweet clover-smell in the breeze; And the June sun warm Tangles his wings of fire in the trees, Setting, as then, over Fernside farm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I mind me how with a lover's care From my Sunday coat I brushed off the burrs, and smoothed my hair, And cooled at the brook-side my brow and throat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Since we parted, a month had passed,— To love, a year; Down through the beeches, I looked at last On the little red gate and the well-sweep near.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I can see it all now,—the slantwise rain Of light through the leaves, The sundown's blaze on her window-pane, The bloom of her roses under the eaves.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Just the same as a month before,— The house and the trees, The barn's brown gable, the vine by the door,— Nothing changed but the hives of bees.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Before them, under the garden wall, Forward and back, Went, drearily singing, the chore-girl small, Draping each hive with a shred of black.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Trembling, I listened: the summer sun Had the chill of snow; For I knew she was telling the bees of one Gone on the journey we all must go!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then I said to myself, "My Mary weeps For the dead to-day: Haply her blind old grandsire sleeps The fret and the pain of his age away."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But her dog whined low; on the doorway sill, With his cane to his chin, The old man sat; and the chore-girl still Sung to the bees stealing out and in.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And the song she was singing ever since In my ear sounds on:— "Stay at home, pretty bees, fly not hence! Mistress Mary is dead and gone!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">* A remarkable custom, brought from the Old Country, formerly prevailed in the rural districts of New England. On the death of a member of the family, the bees were at once informed of the event, and their hives dressed in mourning. This ceremonial was supposed to be necessary to prevent the swarms from leaving their hives and seeking a new home.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">SANDALPHON.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HAVE you read in the Talmud of old, In the legends the Rabbins have told Of the limitless realms of the air, Have you read it,—the marvellous story Of Sandalphon, the Angel of Glory, Sandalphon, the Angel of Prayer?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">How, erect, at the outermost gates Of the City Celestial he waits, With his feet on the ladder of light, That, crowded with angels unnumbered, By Jacob was seen, as he slumbered Alone in the desert at night?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Angels of Wind and of Fire Chant only one hymn, and expire With the song's irresistible stress,— Expire in their rapture and wonder, As harp-strings are broken asunder By the music they throb to express.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But serene in the rapturous throng, Unmoved by the rush of the song, With eyes unimpassioned and slow, Among the dead angels, the deathless Sandalphon stands listening, breathless, To sounds that ascend from below,—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From the spirits on earth that adore, From the souls that entreat and implore In the frenzy and passion of prayer,— From the hearts that are broken with losses, And weary with dragging the crosses Too heavy for mortals to bear.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And he gathers the prayers as he stands, And they change into flowers in his hands, Into garlands of purple and red; And beneath the great arch of the portal, Through the streets of the City Immortal, Is wafted the fragrance they shed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is but a legend, I know,— A fable, a phantom, a show Of the ancient Rabbinical lore; Yet the old mediaeval tradition, The beautiful, strange superstition, But haunts me and holds me the more.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When I look from my window at night, And the welkin above is all white, All throbbing and panting with stars, Among them majestic is standing Sandalphon the angel, expanding His pinions in nebulous bars.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And the legend, I feel, is a part Of the hunger and thirst of the heart, The frenzy and fire of the brain, That grasps at the fruitage forbidden, The golden pomegranates of Eden, To quiet its fever and pain.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHARLEY'S DEATH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE wind got up moaning, and blew to a breeze; I sat with my face closely pressed on the pane; In a minute or two it began to rain, And put out the sunset-fire in the trees.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the clouds' black faces broke out dismay That ran of a sudden up half the sky, And the team, cutting ruts in the grass, went by, Heavy and dripping with sweet wet hay.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Clutching the straws out and knitting his brow, Walked Arthur beside it, unsteady of limb; I stood up in wonder, for, following him, Charley was used to be;—where was he now?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"'Tis like him," I said, "to be working thus late!"— I said it, but did not believe it was so; He could not have staid in the meadow to mow, With rain coming down at so dismal a rate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He's bringing the cows home."—I choked at that lie: They were huddled close by in a tumult and fret,— Some pawing the dry dust up out of the wet, Some looking afield with their heads lifted high.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">O'er the run, o'er the hilltop, and on through the gloom My vision ran quick as the lightning could dart; All at once the blood shocked and stood still in my heart;— He was coming as never till then he had come!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Borne 'twixt our four work-hands, I saw through the fall Of the rain, and the shadows so thick and so dim, They had taken their coats off and spread them on him, And that he was lying out straight,—that was all!</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CAMILLE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I BORE my mystic chalice unto Earth With vintage which no lips of hers might name; Only, in token of its alien birth, Love crowned it with his soft, immortal flame, And, 'mid the world's wide sound, Sacred reserves and silences breathed round,— A spell to keep it pure from low acclaim.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With joy that dulled me to the touch of scorn, I served;—not knowing that of all life's deeds Service was first; nor that high powers are born In humble uses. Fragrance-folding seeds Must so through flowers expand, Then die. God witness that I blessed the Hand Which laid upon my heart such golden needs!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Image of the first page of the poem, showing indentation of lines</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And yet I felt, through all the blind, sweet ways Of life, for some clear shape its dreams to blend,— Some thread of holy art, to knit the days Each unto each, and all to some fair end, Which, through unmarked removes, Should draw me upward, even as it behooves One whose deep spring-tides from His heart descend.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To swell some vast refrain beyond the sun, The very weed breathed music from its sod; And night and day in ceaseless antiphon Rolled off through windless arches in the broad Abyss.—Thou saw'st I, too, Would in my place have blent accord as true, And justified this great enshrining, God!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dreams!—Stain it on the bending amethyst, That one who came with visions of the Prime For guide somehow her radiant pathway missed, And wandered in the darkest gulf of Time. No deed divine thenceforth Stood royal in its far-related worth; No god, in truth, might heal the wounded chime</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oh, how? I darkly ask;—and if I dare To take up a thought from this tumultuous street To the forgotten Silence soaring there Above the hiving roofs, its calm depths meet My glance with no reply. Might I go back and spell this mystery In the new stillness at my mother's feet,—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I would recall with importunings long That so sad soul, once pierced as with a knife, And cry, Forgive! Oh, think Youth's tide was strong, And the full torrent, shut from brain and life, Plunged through the heart, until It rocked to madness, and the o'erstrained will Grew wild, then weak, in the despairing strife!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And ever I think, What warning voice should call, Or show me bane from food, with tedious art, When love—the perfect instinct, flower of all Divinest potencies of choice, whose part Was set 'mid stars and flame To keep the inner place of God—became A blind and ravening fever of the heart?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I laugh with scorn that men should think them praised In women's love,—chance-flung in weary hours, By sickly fire to bloated worship raised!— O long-lost dream, so sweet of vernal flowers! Wherein I stood, it seemed, And gave a gift of queenly mark!—I dreamed Of Passion's joy aglow in rounded powers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I dreamed!—The roar, the tramp, the burdened air Pour round their sharp and subtle mockery. Here go the eager-footed men; and there The costly beggars of the world float by;— Lilies, that toil nor spin, How should they know so well the weft of sin, And hide me from them with such sudden eye?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But all the roaming crowd begins to make A whirl of humming shade;—for, since the day Is done, and there's no lower step to take, Life drops me here. Some rough, kind hand, I pray, Thrust the sad wreck aside, And shut the door on it!—a little pride, That I may not offend who pass this way.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And this is all!—Oh, thou wilt yet give heed! No soul but trusts some late redeeming care,— But walks the narrow plank with bitter speed, And, straining through the sweeping mist of air, In the great tempest-call, And greater silence deepening through it all, Refuses still, refuses to despair!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Some further end, whence thou refitt'st with aim Bewildered souls, perhaps?—Some breath in me, By thee, the purest, found devoid of blame, Fit for large teaching?—Look!—I cannot see,— I can but feel!—Far off, Life seethes and frets,—and from its shame and scoff I take my broken crystal up to thee.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">EPIGRAM ON J. M.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SAID Fortune to a common spit, "Your rust and grease I'll rid ye on, And make ye in a twinkling fit For Ireland's Sword of Gideon!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In vain! what Nature meant for base All chance for good refuses; M. gave one gleam, then turned apace To dirtiest kitchen uses.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">A WORD TO THE WISE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LOVE hailed a little maid, Romping through the meadow: Heedless in the sun she played, Scornful of the shadow. "Come with me," whispered he; "Listen, sweet, to love and reason." "By and by," she mocked reply; "Love's not in season."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Years went, years came; Light mixed with shadow. Love met the maid again, Dreaming through the meadow. "Not so coy," urged the boy; "List in time to love and reason." "By and by," she mused reply; "Love's still in season."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Years went, years came; Light changed to shadow. Love saw the maid again, Waiting in the meadow. "Pass no more; my dream is o'er; I can listen now to reason." "Keep thee coy," mocked the boy; "Love's out of season."</field>

      <field name="heading_text">MERCEDES.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Under a sultry, yellow sky, On the yellow sand I lie; The crinkled vapors smite my brain, I smoulder in a fiery pain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Above the crags the condor flies; He knows where the red gold lies, He knows where the diamonds shine;— If I knew, would she be mine?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mercedes in her hammock swings; In her court a palm-tree flings Its slender shadow on the ground, The fountain falls with silver sound.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her lips are like this cactus cup; With my hand I crush it up; I tear its flaming leaves apart;— Would that I could tear her heart!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Last night a man was at her gate; In the hedge I lay in wait; I saw Mercedes meet him there, By the fire-flies in her hair.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I waited till the break of day, Then I rose and stole away; I drove my dagger through the gate;— Now she knows her lover's fate!</field>
