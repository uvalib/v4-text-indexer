      <field name="heading_text">Far in a Western Brookland</field>
      <field name="heading_text">1887</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From Clee to heaven the beacon burns, The shires have seen it plain, From north and south the sign returns And beacons burn again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Look left, look right, the hills are bright, The dales are light between, Because 'tis fifty years to-night That God has saved the Queen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now, when the flame they watch not towers About the soil they trod, Lads, we'll remember friends of ours Who shared the work with God.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To skies that knit their heartstrings right, To fields that bred them brave, The saviours come not home to-night: Themselves they could not save.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It dawns in Asia, tombstones show And Shropshire names are read; And the Nile spills his overflow Beside the Severn's dead.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We pledge in peace by farm and town The Queen they served in war, And fire the beacons up and down The land they perished for.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"God save the Queen" we living sing, From height to height 'tis heard; And with the rest your voices ring, Lads of the Fifty-third.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oh, God will save her, fear you not: Be you the men you've been, Get you the sons your fathers got, And God will save the Queen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Loveliest of trees, the cherry now Is hung with bloom along the bough, And stands about the woodland ride Wearing white for Eastertide.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now, of my threescore years and ten, Twenty will not come again, And take from seventy springs a score, It only leaves me fifty more.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And since to look at things in bloom Fifty springs are little room, About the woodlands I will go To see the cherry hung with snow.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE RECRUIT</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leave your home behind, lad, And reach your friends your hand, And go, and luck go with you While Ludlow tower shall stand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oh, come you home of Sunday When Ludlow streets are still And Ludlow bells are calling To farm and lane and mill,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Or come you home of Monday When Ludlow market hums And Ludlow chimes are playing "The conquering hero comes,"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ludlow from the North-west Watercolor illustration by William Hyde of river in foreground, cows grazing along the bank, rolling green pastures and trees rise to two turreted castles in the background.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Come you home a hero, Or come not home at all, The lads you leave will mind you Till Ludlow tower shall fall.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And you will list the bugle That blows in lands of morn, And make the foes of England Be sorry you were born.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And you till trump of doomsday On lands of morn may lie, And make the hearts of comrades Be heavy where you die.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leave your home behind you, Your friends by field and town: Oh, town and field will mind you Till Ludlow tower is down.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">REVEILLE</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wake: the silver dusk returning Up the beach of darkness brims, And the ship of sunrise burning Strands upon the eastern rims.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wake: the vaulted shadow shatters, Trampled to the floor it spanned, And the tent of night in tatters Straws the sky-pavilioned land.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Up, lad, up, 'tis late for lying: Hear the drums of morning play; Hark, the empty highways crying "Who'll beyond the hills away?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Towns and countries woo together, Forelands beacon, belfries call; Never lad that trod on leather Lived to feast his heart with all.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Up, lad: thews that lie and cumber Sunlit pallets never thrive; Morns abed and daylight slumber Were not meant for man alive.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Clay lies still, but blood's a rover; Breath's a ware that will not keep. Up, lad: when the journey's over There'll be time enough to sleep.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oh see how thick the goldcup flowers Are lying in field and lane, With dandelions to tell the hours That never are told again. Oh may I squire you round the meads And pick you posies gay? —'Twill do no harm to take my arm. "You may, young man, you may."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ah, spring was sent for lass and lad, 'Tis now the blood runs gold, And man and maid had best be glad Before the world is old. What flowers to-day may flower to-morrow, But never as good as new. —Suppose I wound my arm right round— "'Tis true, young man, 'tis true."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Some lads there are, 'tis shame to say, That only court to thieve, And once they bear the bloom away 'Tis little enough they leave. Then keep your heart for men like me And safe from trustless chaps. My love is true and all for you. "Perhaps, young man, perhaps."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oh, look in my eyes then, can you doubt? —Why, 'tis a mile from town. How green the grass is all about! We might as well sit down. —Ah, life, what is it but a flower? Why must true lovers sigh? Be kind, have pity, my own, my pretty,— "Good-bye, young man, good-bye."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When the lad for longing sighs, Mute and dull of cheer and pale, If at death's own door he lies, Maiden, you can heal his ail.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Lovers' ills are all to buy: The wan look, the hollow tone, The hung head, the sunken eye, You can have them for your own.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Buy them, buy them: eve and morn Lovers' ills are all to sell. Then you can lie down forlorn; But the lover will be well.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When smoke stood up from Ludlow, And mist blew off from Teme, And blithe afield to ploughing Against the morning beam I strode beside my team,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The blackbird in the coppice Looked out to see me stride, And hearkened as I whistled The trampling team beside, And fluted and replied:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Lie down, lie down, young yeoman; What use to rise and rise? Rise man a thousand mornings Yet down at last he lies, And then the man is wise."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I heard the tune he sang me, And spied his yellow bill; I picked a stone and aimed it And threw it with a will: Then the bird was still.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then my soul within me Took up the blackbird's strain, And still beside the horses Along the dewy lane It sang the song again:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Lie down, lie down, young yeoman; The sun moves always west; The road one treads to labour Will lead one home to rest, And that will be the best."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Farewell to barn and stack and tree, Farewell to Severn shore. Terence, look your last at me, For I come home no more.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The sun burns on the half-mown hill, By now the blood is dried; And Maurice amongst the hay lies still And my knife is in his side.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My mother thinks us long away; 'Tis time the field were mown. She had two sons at rising day, To-night she'll be alone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And here's a bloody hand to shake, And oh, man, here's good-bye; We'll sweat no more on scythe and rake, My bloody hands and I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish you strength to bring you pride, And a love to keep you clean, And I wish you luck, come Lammastide, At racing on the green.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Long for me the rick will wait, And long will wait the fold, And long will stand the empty plate, And dinner will be cold."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On moonlit heath and lonesome bank The sheep beside me graze; And yon the gallows used to clank Fast by the four cross ways.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A careless shepherd once would keep The flocks by moonlight there, * And high amongst the glimmering sheep The dead man stood on air.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They hang us now in Shrewsbury jail: The whistles blow forlorn, And trains all night groan on the rail To men that die at morn.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There sleeps in Shrewsbury jail to-night, Or wakes, as may betide, A better lad, if things went right, Than most that sleep outside.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And naked to the hangman's noose The morning clocks will ring A neck God made for other use Than strangling in a string.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And sharp the link of life will snap, And dead on air will stand Heels that held up as straight a chap As treads upon the land.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So here I'll watch the night and wait To see the morning shine, When he will hear the stroke of eight And not the stroke of nine;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And wish my friend as sound a sleep As lads' I did not know, That shepherded the moonlit sheep A hundred years ago.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Note: Hanging in chains was called keeping sheep by moonlight.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">MARCH</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Sun at noon to higher air, Unharnessing the silver Pair That late before his chariot swam, Rides on the gold wool of the Ram.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So braver notes the storm-cock sings To start the rusted wheel of things, And brutes in field and brutes in pen Leap that the world goes round again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boys are up the woods with day To fetch the daffodils away, And home at noonday from the hills They bring no dearth of daffodils.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Afield for palms the girls repair, And sure enough the palms are there, And each will find by hedge or pond Her waving silver-tufted wand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In farm and field through all the shire The eye beholds the heart's desire; Ah, let not only mine be vain, For lovers should be loved again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On your midnight pallet lying, Listen, and undo the door: Lads that waste the light in sighing In the dark should sigh no more; Night should ease a lover's sorrow; Therefore, since I go to-morrow, Pity me before.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the land to which I travel, The far dwelling, let me say— Once, if here the couch is gravel, In a kinder bed I lay, And the breast the darnel smothers Rested once upon another's When it was not clay.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When I watch the living meet, And the moving pageant file Warm and breathing through the street Where I lodge a little while,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If the heats of hate and lust In the house of flesh are strong, Let me mind the house of dust Where my sojourn shall be long.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the nation that is not Nothing stands that stood before; There revenges are forgot, And the hater hates no more;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Lovers lying two and two Ask not whom they sleep beside, And the bridegroom all night through Never turns him to the bride.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When I was one-and-twenty I heard a wise man say, "Give crowns and pounds and guineas But not your heart away; Give pearls away and rubies But keep your fancy free." But I was one-and-twenty, No use to talk to me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When I was one-and-twenty I heard him say again, "The heart out of the bosom Was never given in vain; 'Tis paid with sighs a plenty And sold for endless rue." And I am two-and-twenty And oh, 'tis true, 'tis true.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There pass the careless people That call their souls their own: Here by the road I loiter, How idle and alone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ah, past the plunge of plummet, In seas I cannot sound, My heart and soul and senses, World without end, are drowned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His folly has not fellow Beneath the blue of day That gives to man or woman His heart and soul away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There flowers no balm to sain him From east of earth to west That's lost for everlasting The heart out of his breast.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here by the labouring highway With empty hands I stroll: Sea-deep, till doomsday morning, Lie lost my heart and soul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Look not in my eyes, for fear They mirror true the sight I see, And there you find your face too clear And love it and be lost like me. One the long nights through must lie Spent in star-defeated sighs, But why should you as well as I Perish? gaze not in my eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A Grecian lad, as I hear tell, One that many loved in vain, Looked into a forest well And never looked away again. There, when the turf in springtime flowers, With downward eye and gazes sad, Stands amid the glancing showers A jonquil, not a Grecian lad.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It nods and curtseys and recovers When the wind blows above, The nettle on the graves of lovers That hanged themselves for love.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The nettle nods, the wind blows over, The man, he does not move, The lover of the grave, the lover That hanged himself for love.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Twice a week the winter thorough Here stood I to keep the goal: Football then was fighting sorrow For the young man's soul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now in Maytime to the wicket Out I march with bat and pad: See the son of grief at cricket Trying to be glad.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Try I will; no harm in trying: Wonder 'tis how little mirth Keeps the bones of man from lying On the bed of earth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oh, when I was in love with you Then I was clean and brave, And miles around the wonder grew How well did I behave.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And now the fancy passes by And nothing will remain, And miles around they'll say that I Am quite myself again.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">TO AN ATHLETE DYING YOUNG</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The time you won your town the race We chaired you through the market-place; Man and boy stood cheering by, And home we brought you shoulder-high.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To-day, the road all runners come, Shoulder-high we bring you home, And set you at your threshold down, Townsman of a stiller town.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Smart lad, to slip betimes away From fields where glory does not stay, And early though the laurel grows It withers quicker than the rose.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Eyes the shady night has shut Cannot see the record cut, And silence sounds no worse than cheers After earth has stopped the ears:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now you will not swell the rout Of lads that wore their honors out, Runners whom reknown outran And the name died before the man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So set, before the echoes fade, The fleet foot on the sill of shade, And hold to the low lintel up The still-defended challenge-cup.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And round that early-laurelled head Will flock to gaze the strengthless dead, And find unwithered on its curls The garland briefer than a girl's.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oh fair enough are sky and plain, But I know fairer far: Those are as beautiful again That in the water are;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The pools and rivers wash so clean The trees and clouds and air, The like on earth has never seen, And oh that I were there.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">These are the thoughts I often think As I stand gazing down In act upon the cressy brink To strip and dive and drown;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But in the golden-sanded brooks And azure meres I spy A silly lad that longs and looks And wishes he were I.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">BREDON HILL *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In summertime on Bredon The bells they sound so clear; Round both the shires they ring them In steeples far and near, A happy noise to hear.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here of a Sunday morning My love and I would lie, And see the coloured counties, And hear the larks so high About us in the sky.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The bells would ring to call her In valleys miles away: "Come all to church, good people; Good people, come and pray." But here my love would stay.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And I would turn and answer Among the springing thyme, "Oh, peal upon our wedding, And we will hear the chime, And come to church in time."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But when the snows at Christmas On Bredon top were strown, My love rose up so early And stole out unbeknown And went to church alone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They tolled the one bell only, Groom there was none to see, The mourners followed after, And so to church went she, And would not wait for me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The bells they sound on Bredon And still the steeples hum. "Come all to church, good people,"— Oh, noisy bells, be dumb; I hear you, I will come.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Note: Pronounced Breedon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The street sounds to the soldiers' tread, And out we troop to see: A single redcoat turns his head, He turns and looks at me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My man, from sky to sky's so far, We never crossed before; Such leagues apart the world's ends are, We're like to meet no more;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What thoughts at heart have you and I We cannot stop to tell; But dead or living, drunk or dry, Soldier, I wish you well.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The lads in their hundreds to Ludlow come in for the fair, There's men from the barn and the forge and the mill and the fold, The lads for the girls and the lads for the liquor are there, And there with the rest are the lads that will never be old.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There's chaps from the town and the field and the till and the cart, And many to count are the stalwart, and many the brave, And many the handsome of face and the handsome of heart, And few that will carry their looks or their truth to the grave.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I wish one could know them, I wish there were tokens to tell The fortunate fellows that now you can never discern; And then one could talk with them friendly and wish them farewell And watch them depart on the way that they will not return.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But now you may stare as you like and there's nothing to scan; And brushing your elbow unguessed-at and not to be told They carry back bright to the coiner the mintage of man, The lads that will die in their glory and never be old.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Say, lad, have you things to do? Quick then, while your day's at prime. Quick, and if 'tis work for two, Here am I man: now's your time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Send me now, and I shall go; Call me, I shall hear you call; Use me ere they lay me low Where a man's no use at all;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ere the wholesome flesh decay And the willing nerve be numb, And the lips lack breath to say, "No, my lad, I cannot come."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This time of year a twelvemonth past, When Fred and I would meet, We needs must jangle, till at last We fought and I was beat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So then the summer fields about, Till rainy days began, Rose Harland on her Sundays out Walked with the better man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The better man she walks with still, Though now 'tis not with Fred: A lad that lives and has his will Is worth a dozen dead.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fred keeps the house all kinds of weather, And clay's the house he keeps; When Rose and I walk out together Stock-still lies Fred and sleeps.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Along the field as we came by A year ago, my love and I, The aspen over stile and stone Was talking to itself alone. "Oh who are these that hiss and pass? A country lover and his lass; Two lovers looking to be wed; And time shall put them both to bed, But she shall lie with earth above, And he beside another love."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And sure enough beneath the tree There walks another love with me, And overhead the aspen heaves Its rainy-sounding silver leaves; And I spell nothing in their stir, But now perhaps they speak to her, And plain for her to understand They talk about a time at hand When I shall sleep with clover clad, And she beside another lad.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is my team ploughing, That I was used to drive And hear the harness jingle When I was man alive?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ay, the horses trample, The harness jingles now; No change though you lie under The land you used to plough.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is football playing Along the river shore, With lads to chase the leather, Now I stand up no more?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ay, the ball is flying, The lads play heart and soul; The goal stands up, the keeper Stands up to keep the goal.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is my girl happy, That I thought hard to leave, And has she tired of weeping As she lies down at eve?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ay, she lies down lightly, She lies not down to weep, Your girl is well contented. Be still, my lad, and sleep.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is my friend hearty, Now I am thin and pine, And has he found to sleep in A better bed than mine?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yes, lad, I lie easy, I lie as lads would choose; I cheer a dead man's sweetheart, Never ask me whose.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE WELSH MARCHES</field>
      <field name="fulltext">High the vanes of Shrewsbury gleam Islanded in Severn stream; The bridges from the steepled crest Cross the water east and west.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The flag of morn in conqueror's state Enters at the English gate: The vanquished eve, as night prevails, Bleeds upon the road to Wales.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ages since the vanquished bled Round my mother's marriage-bed; There the ravens feasted far About the open house of war:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Shrewsbury: the English Bridge Watercolor illustration by William Hyde of the English Bridge at Shrewsbury. River in the foreground, brick buildings and steeples on the far bank. Ominous clouds loom overhead.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Severn down to Buildwas ran Coloured with the death of man, Couched upon her brother's grave That Saxon got me on the slave.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The sound of fight is silent long That began the ancient wrong; Long the voice of tears is still That wept of old the endless ill.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In my heart it has not died, The war that sleeps on Severn side; They cease not fighting, east and west, On the marches of my breat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here the truceless armies yet Trample, rolled in blood and sweat; They kill and kill and never die; And I think that each is I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">None will part us, none undo The knot that makes one flesh of two, Sick with hatred, sick with pain, Strangling— When shall we be slain?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When shall I be dead and rid Of the wrong my father did? How long, how long, till spade and hearse Puts to sleep my mother's curse?</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE LENT LILY</field>
      <field name="fulltext">'Tis spring; come out to ramble The hilly brakes around, For under thorn and bramble About the hollow ground The primroses are found.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And there's the windflower chilly With all the winds at play, And there's the Lenten lily That has not long to stay And dies on Easter day.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And since till girls go maying You find the primrose still, And find the windflower playing With every wind at will, But not the daffodil,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bring baskets now, and sally Upon the spring's array, And bear from hill and valley The daffodil away That dies on Easter day.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Others, I am not the first, Have willed more mischief than they durst: If in the breathless night I too Shiver now, 'tis nothing new.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">More than I, if truth were told, Have stood and sweated hot and cold, And through their reins in ice and fire Fear contended with desire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Agued once like me were they, But I like them shall win my way Lastly to the bed of mould Where there's neither heat nor cold.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But from my grave across my brow Plays no wind of healing now, And fire and ice within me fight Beneath the suffocating night.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wenlock Edge Watercolor illustration by William Hyde of Wenlock Edge. A hill covered with autumnal trees rises to a ridge which overlooks a narrow path. Dark hills and cloudy sky in the background.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On Wenlock Edge the wood's in trouble; His forest fleece the Wrekin heaves; The gale, it plies the saplings double, And thick on Severn snow the leaves.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">'Twould blow like this through holt and hanger When Uricon the city stood: 'Tis the old wind in the old anger, But then it threshed another wood.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then, 'twas before my time, the Roman At yonder heaving hill would stare: The blood that warms an English yeoman, The thoughts that hurt him, they were there.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There, like the wind through woods in riot, Through him the gale of life blew high; The tree of man was never quiet: Then 'twas the Roman, now 'tis I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The gale, it plies the saplings double, It blows so hard, 'twill soon be gone: To-day the Roman and his trouble Are ashes under Uricon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From far, from eve and morning And yon twelve-winded sky, The stuff of life to knit me Blew hither: here am I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now— for a breath I tarry Nor yet disperse apart— Take my hand quick and tell me, What have you in your heart.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Speak now, and I will answer; How shall I help you, say; Ere to the wind's twelve quarters I take my endless way.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If truth in hearts that perish Could move the powers on high, I think the love I bear you Should make you not to die.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sure, sure, if stedfast meaning, If single thought could save, The world might end to-morrow, You should not see the grave.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This long and sure-set liking, This boundless will to please, —Oh, you should live for ever, If there were help in these.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But now, since all is idle, To this lost heart be kind, Ere to a town you journey Where friends are ill to find.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE NEW MISTRESS</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"'Oh, sick I am to see you, will you never let me be? You may be good for something, but you are not good for me. Oh, go where you are wanted, for you are not wanted here.' And that was all the farewell when I parted from my dear.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will go where I am wanted, to a lady born and bred Who will dress me free for nothing in a uniform of red; She will not be sick to see me if I only keep it clean: I will go where I am wanted for a soldier of the Queen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will go where I am wanted, for the sergeant does not mind; He may be sick to see me but he treats me very kind: He gives me beer and breakfast and a ribbon for my cap, And I never knew a sweetheart spend her money on a chap.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will go where I am wanted, where there's room for one or two, And the men are none too many for the work there is to do; Where the standing line wears thinner and the dropping dead lie thick; And the enemies of England they shall see me and be sick."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the idle hill of summer, Sleepy with the flow of streams, Far I hear the steady drummer Drumming like a noise in dreams.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Far and near and low and louder On the roads of earth go by, Dear to friends and food for powder, Soldiers marching, all to die.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">East and west on fields forgotten Bleach the bones of comrades slain, Lovely lads and dead and rotten; None that go return again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Far the calling bugles hollo, High the screaming fife replies, Gay the files of scarlet follow: Woman bore me, I will rise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">White in the moon the long road lies, The moon stands blank above; White in the moon the long road lies That leads me from my love.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Still hangs the hedge without a gust, Still, still the shadows stay: My feet upon the moonlit dust Pursue the ceaseless way.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The world is round, so travellers tell, And straight though reach the track, Trudge on, trudge on, 'twill all be well, The way will guide one back.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But ere the circle homeward hies Far, far must it remove: White in the moon the long road lies That leads me from my love.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As through the wild green hills of Wyre The train ran, changing sky and shire, And far behind, a fading crest, Low in the forsaken west Sank the high-reared head of Clee, My hand lay empty on my knee. Aching on my knee it lay: That morning half a shire away So many an honest fellow's fist Had well-nigh wrung it from the wrist. Hand, said I, since now we part From fields and men we know by heart, For strangers' faces, strangers' lands,— Hand, you have held true fellows' hands. Be clean then; rot before you do A thing they'll not believe of you.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Clee Hill Watercolor illustration by William Hyde of Clee Hill.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You and I must keep from shame In London streets the Shropshire name; On banks of Thames they must not say Severn breeds worse men than they; And friends abroad must bear in mind Friends at home they leave behind. Oh, I shall be stiff and cold When I forget you, hearts of gold; The land where I shall mind you not Is the land where all's forgot. And if my foot returns no more To Teme nor Corve nor Severn shore, Luck, my lads, be with you still By falling stream and standing hill, By chiming tower and whispering tree, Men that made a man of me. About your work in town and farm Still you'll keep my head from harm, Still you'll help me, hands that gave A grasp to friend me to the grave.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The winds out of the west land blow, My friends have breathed them there; Warm with the blood of lads I know Comes east the sighing air.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It fanned their temples, filled their lungs, Scattered their forelocks free; My friends made words of it with tongues That talk no more to me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Their voices, dying as they fly, Thick on the wind are sown; The names of men blow soundless by, My fellows' and my own.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oh lads, at home I heard you plain, But here your speech is still, And down the sighing wind in vain You hollo from the hill.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The wind and I, we both were there, But neither long abode; Now through the friendless world we fare And sigh upon the road.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">'Tis time, I think, by Wenlock town The golden broom should blow; The hawthorn sprinkled up and down Should charge the land with snow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Spring will not wait the loiterer's time Who keeps so long away; So others wear the broom and climb The hedgerows heaped with may.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oh tarnish late on Wenlock Edge, Gold that I never see; Lie long, high snowdrifts in the hedge That will not shower on me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Into my heart an air that kills From yon far country blows: What are those blue remembered hills, What spires, what farms are those?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">That is the land of lost content, I see it shining plain, The happy highways where I went And cannot come again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In my own shire, if I was sad, Homely comforters I had: The earth, because my heart was sore, Sorrowed for the son she bore; And standing hills, long to remain, Shared their short-lived comrade's pain. And bound for the same bourn as I, On every road I wandered by, Trod beside me, close and dear, The beautiful and death-struck year: Whether in the woodland brown I heard the beechnut rustle down, And saw the purple crocus pale Flower about the autumn dale; Or littering far the fields of May Lady-smocks a-bleaching lay, And like a skylit water stood The bluebells in the azured wood.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Wrekin from near Much Wenlock Watercolor illustration by William Hyde of the Wrekin from near Much Wenlock. Rolling green hills, in foreground, small cabin, woman feeding ducks. Cloudy sky and mountain in background.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yonder, lightening other loads, The seasons range the country roads, But here in London streets I ken No such helpmates, only men; And these are not in plight to bear, If they would, another's care. They have enough as 'tis: I see In many an eye that measures me The mortal sickness of a mind Too unhappy to be kind. Undone with misery, all they can Is to hate their fellow man; And till they drop they needs must still Look at you and wish you ill.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE MERRY GUIDE</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Once in the wind of morning I ranged the thymy wold; The world-wide air was azure And all the brooks ran gold.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There through the dews beside me Behold a youth that trod, With feathered cap on forehead, And poised a golden rod.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With mien to match the morning And gay delightful guise And friendly brows and laughter He looked me in the eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oh whence, I asked, and whither? He smiled and would not say. And looked at me and beckoned, And laughed and led the way.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And with kind looks and laughter And nought to say beside, We two went on together, I and my happy guide.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Across the glittering pastures And empty upland still And solitude of shepherds High in the folded hill,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By hanging woods and hamlets That gaze through orchards down On many a windmill turning And far-discovered town,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With gay regards of promise And sure unslackened stride And smiles and nothing spoken Led on my merry guide.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By blowing realms of woodland With sunstruck vanes afield And cloud-led shadows sailing About the windy weald,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By valley-guarded granges And silver waters wide, Content at heart I followed With my delightful guide.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And like the cloudy shadows Across the country blown We two fare on for ever, But not we two alone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With the great gale we journey That breathes from gardens thinned, Borne in the drift of blossoms Whose petals throng the wind;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Buoyed on the heaven-ward whisper Of dancing leaflets whirled From all the woods that autumn Bereaves in all the world.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And midst the fluttering legion Of all that ever died I follow, and before us Goes the delightful guide,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With lips that brim with laughter But never once respond, And feet that fly on feathers, And serpent-circled wand.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE IMMORTAL PART</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When I meet the morning beam, Or lay me down at night to dream, I hear my bones within me say, "Another night, another day.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"When shall this slough of sense be cast, This dust of thoughts be laid at last, The man of flesh and soul be slain And the man of bone remain?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This tongue that talks, these lungs that shout, These thews that hustle us about, This brain that fills the skull with schemes, And its humming hive of dreams,—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"These to-day are proud in power And lord it in their little hour: The immortal bones obey control Of dying flesh and dying soul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"'Tis long till eve and morn are gone: Slow the endless night comes on, And late to fulness grows the birth That shall last as long as earth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wanderers eastward, wanderers west, Know you why you cannot rest? 'Tis that every mother's son Travails with a skeleton.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Lie down in the bed of dust; Bear the fruit that bear you must; Bring the eternal seed to light, And morn is all the same as night.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Rest you so from trouble sore, Fear the heat o' the sun no more, Nor the snowing winter wild, Now you labour not with child.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Empty vessel, garment cast, We that wore you long shall last. —Another night, another day." So my bones within me say.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Therefore they shall do my will To-day while I am master still, And flesh and soul, now both are strong, Shall hale the sullen slaves along,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Before this fire of sense decay, This smoke of thought blow clean away, And leave with ancient night alone The stedfast and enduring bone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Shot? so quick, so clean an ending? Oh that was right, lad, that was brave: Yours was not an ill for mending, 'Twas best to take it to the grave.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oh you had forethought, you could reason, And saw your road and where it led, And early wise and brave in season Put the pistol to your head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oh soon, and better so than later After long disgrace and scorn, You shot dead the household traitor, The soul that should not have been born.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Right you guessed the rising morrow And scorned to tread the mire you must: Dust's your wages, son of sorrow, But men may come to worse than dust.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Souls undone, undoing others,— Long time since the tale began. You would not live to wrong your brothers: Oh lad, you died as fits a man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now to your grave shall friend and stranger With ruth and some with envy come: Undishonoured, clear of danger, Clean of guilt, pass hence and home.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Turn safe to rest, no dreams, no waking; And here, man, here's the wreath I've made: 'Tis not a gift that's worth the taking, But wear it and it will not fade.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If by chance your eye offend you, Pluck it out, lad, and be sound: 'Twill hurt, but here are salves to friend you, And many a balsam grows on ground.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And if your hand or foot offend you, Cut it off, lad, and be whole; But play the man, stand up and end you, When your sickness is your soul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bring, in this timeless grave to throw, No cypress, sombre on the snow; Snap not from the bitter yew His leaves that live December through; Break no rosemary, bright with rime And sparkling to the cruel clime; Nor plod the winter land to look For willows in the icy brook To cast them leafless round him: bring No spray that ever buds in spring.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But if the Christmas field has kept Awns the last gleaner overstept, Or shrivelled flax, whose flower is blue A single season, never two; Or if one haulm whose year is o'er Shivers on the upland frore, —Oh, bring from hill and stream and plain Whatever will not flower again, To give him comfort: he and those Shall bide eternal bedfellows Where low upon the couch he lies Whence he never shall arise.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE CARPENTER'S SON</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here the hangman stops his cart: Now the best of friends must part. Fare you well, for ill fare I: Live, lads, and I will die.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, at home had I but stayed 'Prenticed to my father's trade, Had I stuck to plane and adze, I had not been lost, my lads.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then I might have built perhaps Gallows-trees for other chaps, Never dangled on my own, Had I left but ill alone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now, you see, they hang me high, And the people passing by Stop to shake their fists and curse; So 'tis come from ill to worse.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here hang I, and right and left Two poor fellows hang for theft: All the same's the luck we prove, Though the midmost hangs for love.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Comrades all, that stand and gaze, Walk henceforth in other ways; See my neck and save your own: Comrades all, leave ill alone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Make some day a decent end, Shrewder fellows than your friend. Fare you well, for ill fare I: Live lads, and I will die."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Be still, my soul, be still; the arms you bear are brittle, Earth and high heaven are fixt of old and founded strong. Think rather,— call to thought, if now you grieve a little, The days when we had rest, O soul, for they were long.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Men loved unkindness then, but lightless in the quarry I slept and saw not; tears fell down, I did not mourn; Sweat ran and blood sprang out and I was never sorry: Then it was well with me, in days ere I was born.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now, and I muse for why and never find the reason, I pace the earth, and drink the air, and feel the sun. Be still, be still, my soul; it is but for a season: Let us endure an hour and see injustice done.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ay, look: high heaven and earth ail from the prime foundation; All thoughts to rive the heart are here, and all are vain: Horror and scorn and hate and fear and indignation— Oh why did I awake? when shall I sleep again?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Think no more, lad; laugh, be jolly: Why should men make haste to die? Empty heads and tongues a-talking Make the rough road easy walking, And the feather pate of folly Bears the falling sky.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oh, 'tis jesting, dancing, drinking Spins the heavy world around. If young hearts were not so clever, Oh, they would be young for ever: Think no more; 'tis only thinking Lays lads underground.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the Teme Watercolor illustration by William Hyde of the view on the Teme. Sliver moon hangs low above a golden horizon, the river winds around level banks, trees and mountains.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Clunton and Clunbury, Clungunford and Clun, Are the quietest places Under the sun.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In valleys of springs and rivers, By Ony and Teme and Clun, The country for easy livers, The quietest under the sun,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We still had sorrows to lighten, One could not be always glad, And lads knew trouble at Knighton When I was a Knighton lad.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By bridges that Thames runs under, In London, the town built ill, 'Tis sure small matter for wonder If sorrow is with one still.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And if as a lad grows older The troubles he bears are more, He carries his griefs on a shoulder That handselled them long before.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Where shall one halt to deliver This luggage I'd lief set down? Not Thames, not Teme is the river, Nor London nor Knighton the town:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">'Tis a long way further than Knighton, A quieter place than Clun, Where doomsday may thunder and lighten And little 'twill matter to one.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Loitering with a vacant eye Along the Grecian gallery, And brooding on my heavy ill, I met a statue standing still. Still in marble stone stood he, And stedfastly he looked at me. "Well met," I thought the look would say, "We both were fashioned far away; We neither knew, when we were young, These Londoners we live among."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Still he stood and eyed me hard, An earnest and a grave regard: "What, lad, drooping with your lot? I too would be where I am not. I too survey that endless line Of men whose thoughts are not as mine. Years, ere you stood up from rest, On my neck the collar prest; Years, when you lay down your ill, I shall stand and bear it still. Courage, lad, 'tis not for long: Stand, quit you like stone, be strong." So I thought his look would say; And light on me my trouble lay, And I stept out in flesh and bone Manful like the man of stone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Far in a western brookland That bred me long ago The poplars stand and tremble By pools I used to know.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There, in the windless night-time, The wanderer, marvelling why, Halts on the bridge to hearken How soft the poplars sigh.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He hears: no more remembered In fields where I was known, Here I lie down in London And turn to rest alone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There, by the starlit fences, The wanderer halts and hears My soul that lingers sighing About the glimmering weirs.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE TRUE LOVER</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The lad came to the door at night, When lovers crown their vows, And whistled soft and out of sight In shadow of the boughs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shall not vex you with my face Henceforth, my love, for aye; So take me in your arms a space Before the cast is grey.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"When I from hence away am past I shall not find a bride, And you shall be the first and last I ever lay beside."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She heard and went and knew not why; Her heart to his she laid; Light was the air beneath the sky But dark under the shade.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh do you breathe, lad, that your breast Seems not to rise and fall, And here upon my bosom prest There beats no heart at all?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh loud, my girl, it once would knock, You should have felt it then; But since for you I stopped the clock It never goes again."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh lad, what is it, lad, that drips Wet from your neck on mine? What is it falling on my lips, My lad, that tastes of brine?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh like enough 'tis blood, my dear, For when the knife was slit, The throat across from ear to ear 'Twill bleed because of it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Under the stars the air was light But dark below the boughs, The still air of the speechless night, When lovers crown their vows.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With rue my heart is laden For golden friends I had, For many a rose-lipt maiden And many a lightfoot lad.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By brooks too broad for leaping The lightfoot boys are laid; The rose-lipt girls are sleeping In fields where roses fade.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Westward on the high-hilled plains Where for me the world began, Still, I think, in newer veins Frets the changeless blood of man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now that other lads than I Strip to bathe on Severn shore, They, no help, for all they try, Tread the mill I trod before.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There, when hueless is the west And the darkness hushes wide, Where the lad lies down to rest Stands the troubled dream beside.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There, on thoughts that once were mine, Day looks down the eastern steep, And the youth at morning shine Makes the vow he will not keep.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE DAY OF BATTLE</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Far I hear the bugle blow To call me where I would not go, And the guns begin the song, 'Soldier, fly or stay for long.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Comrade, if to turn and fly Made a soldier never die, Fly I would, for who would not? 'Tis sure no pleasure to be shot.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But since the man that runs away Lives to die another day, And cowards' funerals, when they come, Are not wept so well at home,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Therefore, though the best is bad, Stand and do the best, my lad; Stand and fight and see your slain, And take the bullet in your brain."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You smile upon your friend to-day, To-day his ills are over; You hearken to the lover's say, And happy is the lover.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">'Tis late to hearken, late to smile, But better late than never; I shall have lived a little while Before I die for ever.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When I came last to Ludlow Amidst the moonlight pale, Two friends kept step beside me, Two honest friends and hale.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now Dick lies long in the churchyard, And Ned lies long in jail, And I come home to Ludlow Amidst the moonlight pale.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE ISLE OF PORTLAND</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The star-filled seas are smooth to-night From France to England strown; Black towers above the Portland light The felon-quarried stone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On yonder island, not to rise, Never to stir forth free, Far from his folk a dead lad lies That once was friends with me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Lie you easy, dream you light, And sleep you fast for aye; And luckier may you find the night Than ever you found the day.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now hollow fires burn out to black, And lights are guttering low: Square your shoulders, lift your pack, And leave your friends and go.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oh never fear, man, nought's to dread, Look not to left nor right: In all the endless road you tread There's nothing but the night.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">HUGHLEY STEEPLE</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The vane on Hughley steeple Veers bright, a far-known sign, And there lie Hughley people And there lie friends of mine. Tall in their midst the tower Divides the shade and sun, And the clock strikes the hour And tells the time to none.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To south the headstones cluster, The sunny mounds lie thick; The dead are more in muster At Hughley than the quick. North, for a soon-told number, Chill graves the sexton delves, And steeple-shadowed slumber The slayers of themselves.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To north, to south, lie parted, With Hughley tower above, The kind, the single-hearted, The lads I used to love. And, south or north, 'tis only A choice of friends one knows, And I shall ne'er be lonely Asleep with these or those.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Terence, this is stupid stuff: You eat your victuals fast enough; There can't be much amiss, 'tis clear, To see the rate you drink your beer. But oh, good Lord, the verse you make, It gives a chap the belly-ache. The cow, the old cow, she is dead; It sleeps well, the horned head: We poor lads, 'tis our turn now To hear such tunes as killed the cow. Pretty friendship 'tis to rhyme Your friends to death before their time Moping melancholy mad: Come, pipe a tune to dance to, lad."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Why, if 'tis dancing you would be, There's brisker pipes than poetry. Say, for what were hop-yards meant, Or why was Burton built on Trent? Oh many a peer of England brews Livelier liquor than the Muse, And malt does more than Milton can To justify God's ways to man. Ale, man, ale's the stuff to drink For fellows whom it hurts to think: Look into the pewter pot To see the world as the world's not. And faith, 'tis pleasant till 'tis past: The mischief is that 'twill not last. Oh I have been to Ludlow fair And left my necktie God knows where, And carried half way home, or near, Pints and quarts of Ludlow beer: Then the world seemed none so bad, And I myself a sterling lad; And down in lovely muck I've lain, Happy till I woke again. Then I saw the morning sky: Heigho, the tale was all a lie; The world, it was the old world yet, I was I, my things were wet, And nothing now remained to do But begin the game anew.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Therefore, since the world has still Much good, but much less good than ill, And while the sun and moon endure Luck's a chance, but trouble's sure, I'd face it as a wise man would, And train for ill and not for good. 'Tis true, the stuff I bring for sale Is not so brisk a brew as ale: Out of a stem that scored the hand I wrung it in a weary land. But take it: if the smack is sour The better for the embittered hour; It will do good to heart and head When your soul is in my soul's stead; And I will friend you, if I may, In the dark and cloudy day.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was a king reigned in the East: There, when kings will sit to feast, They get their fill before they think With poisoned meat and poisoned drink. He gathered all that sprang to birth From the many-venomed earth; First a little, thence to more, He sampled all her killing store; And easy, smiling, seasoned sound, Sate the king when healths went round. They put arsenic in his meat And stared aghast to watch him eat; They poured strychnine in his cup And shook to see him drink it up: They shook, they stared as white's their shirt: Them it was their poison hurt. —I tell the tale that I heard told. Mithridates, he died old.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I hoed and trenched and weeded, And took the flowers to fair: I brought them home unheeded; The hue was not the wear.</field>
