      <field name="heading_text">Notes from James history of England Bremo. Friday Decr 24th. 1819. [1]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The history of all ancient nations is much involved in obscurity, uncertainty, and contradiction. But as these adventures of barbarous nations even if they were correctly recorded could afford no entertainment to men born in a more cultivated age this uncertainty is not to be regretted. All Ancient writers agreed in representing the first inhabitants of Britain as a tribe of Gauls or Belta who setteled that island from the neighboring continent. The south-east parts of Britain had allready, before the age of Reason made the requisite step towards a civil settlement by the introduction of tillage &amp; agriculture. The other inhabitants of the island still maintained themselves by pasture. They were cloathed with the skins of beasts. The religion of the Britons was one of the most considerable parts of their government. The Druids who were their priests held great authority among them. They were the most superstitious nation in the world at that time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Caesar having overrun all Gaul by his victories first cast his eye on Britain determining to destroy it. A.D. 55 In the reign of Suetonius Paulinus was invested with the command of an army &amp; carried his victorious arms northwards defeated numberless barbarians and burnt London to ashes. and finding that the island of Mona non Anglesey was the chief seat of the Druids he resolved to attack it. The Britons endeavored to prevent them from approaching by running about with flaming torches in the hands howling &amp; setting every thing on fire they came near but the Romans drove them from the field and put the Druids to death. After this the Britons often had entertene broils and whenever they wanted assistence they called on the Romans to help them and thus it was when they were called upon by the Britons that instead of defeating them they fought them and nearly overran them. The Britons had already began to grow quite effeminate and the Romans having assisted them so frequently that they were unable any longer to afford them any relief sent them word that they must take up arms &amp; fight in their own defense But as the[y] had been entirely unaccustomed to fighting they came off badly. The Picts of Scots who dwelt in the northern parts beyon the Wall of Antonious taking advantage of the absence of the Romans began to make incursions upon their peasible and effeminate neighbours who accustomed to have recourse to the emperors again made supplications to Rome for their assistance and one Legion was sent over for their protection. This force repelled their invasion routed their army &amp; having driven them to their former limits went back to the assistance of the southern provinces of the empire. This was the last time that the Britons got any help from the Romans. They rebuilt the wall of Serverus which was built entirely of stone and having completed this last good office to the inhabitants, they bid a final adieu to Briton in the year 448.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Heptarchy was established in Briton after a violent contest of more than a hundred years. It consisted of 7 Saxon kingdoms namely, Kent, Northumberland, East Anglia, Mercia, Essex, Sussex Wessex. In the reign of Ethelbert the Christian religion was introduced into Kent &amp; some other kingdoms of the heptarchy and although the king Ethelbert was not convicted he permitted the missionaries to remain in peace saying that as they had undertaken the journey solely for the benefit of his subjects he would allow them to remain &amp; deliver their doctrines to the people.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Gregory and Augustine were the two Romans sent to introduce the Christian religion in Britain and they nearly effected their design. After many intreaties they brought over Ethelbert to their wishes and he was baptized. His example had great influence with his subjects but he employed no force to bring them over to his new doctrine. Ethelbert governed the kingdom of Kent 50 years and dying in the year 616 left the crown to his son Eadbald. This prince deserted for some time the Christian faith and his whole people immediately returned with him to idolatry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But Eadbald returned again to the profession of Christianity and all his people returned with him. He died in 640 having reigned 24 years. he left two sons Erminford and Ercombert, who inherited the right of succession. Ercombert though the younger son found means to mount the throne. He reigned 24 years and left the crown to Egbert his son who reigned 9 years. he murdered the two sons of his uncle Erminford. Edrie son of Egbert &amp; Lothaire his uncle reigned jointly and at their death Widred brother of the latter obtained possession of the crown. Eadbert, Ethelbert and Alric his descendants successively mounted the throne. After the death of the last mentioned the royal family of Kent was extinguished and Egbert king of Wessen, who dissolved the Saxon Heptarchy and united the several kingdoms under his dominion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The kings of all the other kingdoms of the heptarchy ascended to the throne in a legal manner untill it was finally destined by all it's kingdoms being united in one great state. It's territories were nearly of the same extent with what is now properly termed England and a favourable opportunity presented itself to the Anglo-Saxons, of establishing a civilized monarchy. This great event took place about the year 827.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The kingdoms of the Heptarchy though united by so recent a conquest appeared to be firmly cemented into one state under the government of Egbert, and as their language, laws, and religion of the different peoples resembled very much a union also in government opened to them the pleasant prospect of future tranquillity. But these flattering views were soon overcast for the Danes committed the most savage inroads upon them and at last reduced them to grievous servitude. this was in the year 827 and about 5 years after the[y] invaded it a second time. At that time Egbert had established his monarchy over England. The Danes landed on the island of Shepay and having pillaged it escaped without any opposition. When they entered Dorcetshire in their next expedition they were encountered by Egbert at Charmouth. They fought and the battle was bloody. The Danes maintained their post which they had taken and made good their retreat to their ships. Two years after they entered into an alliance with the Britons of Cornwall &amp; made an inroad with them into the county of Devon but were met at Hengesdown and entirely defeated. In this deplorable state of Britain Egbert unfortunately died and left the government to his son Ethelnolf. This prince was nothing like his father in talents or vigour. He began his reign with dividing his dominions and delivering up to his son Wthelstan the conquered provinces of Kent, Essex and Sussex. The Danes continued to make frequent incursions upon the Briton but they did not do much injury to the country nor the inhabitants. Ethelnolf dying left the government to Ethelbald &amp; Ethelbert his two sons between whom England was equally shared. Ethelbald was a profligate prince . His reign was short and Ethelbert, his brother succeding to the government, behaved himself during a reign of 5 years in a manner more worthy of his rank. Their kingdom was often infested by the danes but they were allmost always defeated.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ethered succeeded his brother Ethelbert. He defended himself with as much bravery as his predecessor but enjoyed no tranquility during the whole of his reign from the repeted invasions of the Danes. Alfred the younger brother of this prince accompanied him in all his enterprises. The first landing of the Danes in the reign of Ethered was among the East Angles who were more anxious for their own present safety than for the common entered into a separate treaty with them &amp; furnished them with horses by which means the[y] went by land into the Kingdom of Northumberland where they seized the city of York and defended against two princes of that kingdom who died in the assault. They ventured as far as Mercia &amp; took up winter quarters at Nottingham. The Mercians applying to Ethered he set out with Alfred conducting a large army to Nottingham and went into Northumberland; Thence they broke into East-Anglia defeated and took prisoner Edmund their king and afterwards murdered him. The Danes went next to Reading from whence they committed great ravages upon the neighbouring county. The Mercians anxious of shaking off their dependence on Ethered would not join their forces to his, and that prince accompanied by Alfred was forced to march against the enemy, with the West-Saxons alone. The Danes having been defeated in a union shut themselves up in their garrisons but very soon quitted them routed the West-Saxons &amp; obliged them to raise the siege. An action followed at Aston in Berkshire, where the English were very near being entirely defeated in the forepart of the day but they afterwards obtained the victory. Another battle was fought at Bassing where the Danes were more successful and having a reinforcement from their own country they became very terrible to the English. In these confusions Ethered died of a wound &amp; left the government to Alfred. This prince showed early marks of great virtue &amp; shining talents he acquired an extensive knowledge of the Latin tongue, he learnt to read the Saxon poems. His whole mind being absorbed in these elegant pursuits, he looked upon his succession to the throne as more of an object of regret than of triumph, but being called to the throne in preference to his brothers children &amp; as it was by his fathers will he shook off his propensities to literature and exerted himself in the defence of his people. Immediately after the death of his brother he was forced to take up arms in opposition to the Danes who had seized Wilton and were laying waste the county around it. He had a small army which contained those whom he assembled in a sudden gave them battle and was near gaining the advantage but by pursuing the victory too far he lost it. The loss of the Danes was so great that fearing Alfred would receive daily reinforcement from his subjects the[y] were very willing to stipulate for a false retreat to leave the kingdom. They were for that purpose carried to London where they were to take up winter quarters but they made so much havoc in there that they were removed to Lincolnshire a county which they had before reduced to desolation. They suddenly turned back upon Mercia and laid the whole county desolate by fire &amp; sword. The next year a numerous army of the Danes again entered England under 3 princes, Guthram, Oscital, and Amund. Part of these under the command of Haldene marched into Northumberland &amp; took up quarters another part took quarters at Cambridge and then seized Wereham in Dorset the very centre of Alfreds dominions, they routed his army and marching westward got possession of Exeter, whilst the exasperated Britons were engaged in defence of this place they learned that another Army of the Danes had landed at Chippenham and were ravaging the whole county around. They were so disheartened at this that some left the county and went into Wales or fled beyond the sea. After the Danes had ravaged the county until it became very desolate Alfred finding it a thing almost impossible to drive them out of the county entirely and knowing that the kingdom of the East Angles and Northumberland were totally desolate by their frequent inroads he proposed to go there and settle with Guthram their leader provided that they would become Christians. To this they all readily consented &amp; they were all baptized. Alfred gave Guthram the name of Athelstan &amp; took him as his adopted Son.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The few remaining Danes Alfred settled in the five counties of Derby, Leicestor, Stanford, Lincoln, and Nottingham. He was not molested by these barbarian savages for 5 years after and he employed this interval of peace in restoring order to his kingdom.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The king rebuilt all the cities which were destroyed particularly London. he built a considerable road fare the first that ever was in England. At length Hastings the famous Danish chief landed in Kent with 330 sail—he entered the Thames and fortifying Milton spread his forces over the county and committed great depredations. Alfred flew to the defense of his people with a select band of soldiers and gathering his armed militia from all parts appeared in the field with a larger army than the enemy. He routed them in almost every axion. The Danes left after attempting in vain to destroy it &amp; went to Banflete where another army of the English met them did great execution and carried off the wife &amp; two sons of Hastings but Alfred generally gave them back to him provided they would leave the kingdom. Thus did Alfred restore full tranquility to England &amp; provide for the future security of the government. The East-Anglians and the Northumbrian Danes paid humble submission to him whenever he appeared. The Welsh also acknowledged his authority. He died in the vigour of his age in the year 901 after a reign of 29 years and a half in which he deservedly attained the appellation of Alfred the Great and the title of Founder of the English monarchy. Edward the Elder ascended the throne at the death of his father and although he equalled him in military talents he was his inferior in erudition. He found immediately on his accession that Ethalwald his cousin german who insisted on a preferable title was among his partisans and marching to Wenboarne he took it and determined to defend himself to the last extremity. But Edward went to the town with a great army and Ethalwald finding he would be routed with all his men made his escape and went first into Normandy then into Northumberland. There he got a great number of them to join him and march against the king, the East Anglian Danes joined his party they made an incursion into the counties of Glocester Oxford and Welts and having ravaged these places the[y] appeared with their booty before the king who had comman[d]ed a large army he routed them entirely killed Ethalwald and having freed himself from the fear of so dangerous a competitor made peace on advantageous terms and went to work to restore England to a state of tranquillity. In order to do this nothing was wanting but to subject the Northumbrians, who assisted by the Danes who were settled over the kingdom of Mercia and often produced troubles in the centere of England. Edward to divert the force of these enemies sent a fleet to attack them at sea. he fell upon them at Kent hall in the county of Stafford put them to rout, got a great deal of booty, and pursued them with great slaughter to their own country. All the rest of Edwards reign was a series of continued and successful action against the Northumbrians, the East-Angles and the foreign Danes. He subdued the East Angles &amp; the Northumbrians. Several tribes of the Britons were subdued by him and even the Picts &amp; Scotts were obliged to show him marks of submission. He died in 925. His kingdom devolved to Athelstan his natural son. He reigned about 16 years during which time nothing of any importance occurred. The Danes did not produce any disturbances amoung the Britons whilst he sat upon the throne and he occupied his reign very advantageously in endeavoring to give security to his kingdom &amp; government. He was succeeded by Edward his brother, who immediately on his accession met with disturbances from the restless Northumbrians. But he marched suddenly with an army into their country &amp; almost entirely overcame them. In order to assure him of their obedience they offered to embrace Christianity. He conquered Cumberland.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This prince was murdered whilst he was solemnizing a festival in Glocester by Leolf a robber. He reigned 5 years. His children being to young to govern a kingdom his brother Edred was promoted to the throne. His reign like those of all most all of his ancestors was disturbed by the invasions of the Northumbrian Danes who though often quelled, had never been entirely conquered. He attacked them &amp; having put them to flight wasted their country with fire &amp; sword; he then returned with his forces. He fought frequent battles against them afterwards and dying after a reign of 9 years, his nephew Edway was placed upon the throne as his children were infants. This prince came to the throne in the seven-teenth year of his age. During his short reign he was not molested by wars and tumults and was killed to give peaceable possession of the government to Edgar his younger brother. He mounted the throne very young and notwithstanding, Soon discovered an excellent understanding in the management of his public affairs and his whole reign was employed in supporting and improving the internal government of his kingdom. He built &amp; maintained a considerable Navy. and he was always so well prepared for the inroads of the Danes that they darst not approach the country. It was in the reign of Edgar that England was cleared of wolves which did nearly as much mischief as any enemy. He took great pains in hunting these animals and finding that they had all fled and had taken shelter in the mountains of Wales he altered the tribute of money and imposed on their Princes an annual tribute of three hundred wolves. and in this way they were as nearly exterpated that one has never been seen on the island since. Edgar died after a reign of 16 years and in the 33 year of his age. He was succeeded by Edward his son.—This prince was only 15 years old at the time he was promoted to the throne. he reigned four years and there passed nothing memorable during that time. His death alone was memorable and tragical. He was hunting one day in Dorsetshire and being led by the chase near Corfe-castle where Elfrida his step mother resided (who was opposed to his accession under pretence that her son who was not the lawful heir should be made king) he went to see her being very fond of her and as he was not accompanied by any of his retinue he presented her with a favourable opportunity of doing what she had long had a desire to accomplish. He asked for something to drink and whilst he was drinking, a servant of Elfrida came up behind him as he was sitting on his horse and have him a stab. Finding he was wounded he put spurs to his horse; but becoming faint by loss of blood he fell from the saddle, his foot remained in the stirrup, and he was dragged along by his unruly horse untill he expired. He was privately interred by his servants and they gave him the name of Edward the martyr. Ethelred was his successor. This prince died after an unhappy and inglorius reign of 35 years. He left two sons by his first marriage, Edmond who succeeded him, and Ednoy, who was afterwards killed by Canate. His two sons by his second marriage, Edward &amp; Alfred, were immediately, upon Ethelred's death carried into Normandy by queen Emma. Edmond who received the name of Ironside on account of his hardy valour possessed courage &amp; abilities capable of keeping his country from sinking under the calamities to wh. it was exposed when he came to the throne And found no better expedient for stopping the miseries into which it was falling but to lead his army immediately to the field and fight against the common enemy. After meeting with some good luck he made ready for deciding in one general battle, the fate of his crown. Fortune in the beginning of the day declared for him but Edrice cut off the head of one Osmer &amp; stuck on a pole &amp; carried it through the ranks in triumph and it being very much like Edmond cried aloud to the English, saying "Tis time to fly, for behold! the head of their king.["] And although Edmond took off his helmet &amp; showed himself to them the utmost he could do was to leave the victory undecided. He fought another battle but the English were put to much slaughter &amp; many of the nobility killed. He was ready to fight again when the Danish &amp; English nobility equally tired of war made him come to a promise to divide the kingdom between them. It was accordingly done. And he being afterwards killed they made way for the succession of Canute the Dane to the English crown.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Before he took the dominions of the English princes he summoned a general assembly of the states, in order to fix the succession of the kingdom. He sent the two sons of his predecessor to Swedon under pretence of finishing their educations but sent word to the king of that country to kill them immediately on their arrival for as they were the lawful heirs to the throne he feared they might put some obstacles in his way to the crown. The Swedish monarch was to generous to perform a request so barbarous but as he was afraid that Canute might get into a quarrel with him for protecting the young princes, he sent them to Soloman king of Hungary to be educated in his court. Edwin the eldest was afterwards married to the sister of that King and Edward was married to Agatha daughter of the Emperor Henry II and he had three children. Edgar Atheling, Margaret, who afterwards was queen of Scotland, and Christina, who went into a convent. Although Canute had reached the height of his ambition, in getting the English throne yet he was forced at first to make great sacrifices to it by bestowing on the principal of the nobility the most extensive governments. but afterwards he put a number of them to death. He was obliged to load the people with very heavy taxes in the commencement of his reign to make presents to his Danish followers. He made no difference between Danes and English in any point of justice and sent back to Denmark as many of his followers as he could with safety dispense with. But they were afterwards gradually incorporated with his new subjects and were as one nation. Canute having settled his authority in England beyon all danger of a revolution went into Denmark in order to resist the attacks of the king of Sweden and succeeded in the attempt. He then went into Norway &amp; expelling the king Plaas kept possession of the kingdom untill his death. He afterwards built churches in different parts of his kingdom. And undertook a pilgrimage to Rome and staid there some time. Canute was now become the greatest &amp; most powerful monarch being sovereign of Denmark, Norway, and England. Also the greater part of Scotland was subject to his authority. He was almost idolized by his subjects. One of them in admiration of his grandeur, said to him one day that nothing was impossible for him. He then set his chair on the sea side as the tide rose. when the sea still advanced towards him &amp; began to wash him with its bellows he turned to the people &amp; observed that every creature in the world was feeble when compared to that Being alone, in whose hands were all the elements of nature, "who" said he "can say to the ocean, thus far shalt thou go, &amp; no further, and who can level with his rod the most towering piles of human pride and ambition."—This prince died at Shaftsburg; he left 3 sons, Sweyn, Harold, &amp; Hardicanute. Sweyn was put in possession of Norway, Hardicanute was crowned in Denmark and Harrold was made king of England. Nothing of any importance passed during his reign which continued 4 years; he gave a bad specimen of his character. his bodily accomplishments, alone are known by his appellation of Harefoot because he could run &amp; walk so fast. He died in 1039; little regretted by his subjects and left the succession to his brother Hardicanute, whose whole reign was spent in undoing everything his predecessors had done. He plundered a number of cities &amp; inhumanely massacred all their inhabitants. He was so enraged at Harold for depriving of his part of the kingdom that he had his body to be dug up and to be thrown into the Thames. it was found by some fishermen and buried in London. he had it thrown in a second time but it was found again and secretly interred. The violent government of Hardicanute was of short duration. He died in a state of intoxication at a large party.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Edward being at his brothers court at the time of his decease he was made king. The reign of this prince was peaceable and fortunate. The most commendable circumstance of Edwards government, was his attention to justice. he died sudenly on the 5th of January 1066, in the 65th year of his age and twenty fifth of his reign. Harold succeeded him in his government. He had so well prepared all things before the death of Edward that he immediately stepped into the vacant throne with little opposition. It was in the reign of this prince that the decisive battle of Hastings was fought and gained by William, duke of Normandy. he being the rightful heir to the throne he made war against Harrold and having gotten entire possession of the kingdom was proclaimed king. Harrold was killed in the battle of Hastings and his body being brought to William after the battle he generously restored it to his mother, to be disposed of as she wished. The consternation &amp; grief of the English on recovery the intelligence of this unfortunate battle in which their king was killed and most of their nobility slain was excessive. They immediately elected Edgar Atheling for their king. William marched into the kingdom &amp; and every city, every little town, and in short the whole country almost, made submissions to him and without opposition was crowned king. Afterwards there were many insurrections of the people but they were generally soon defeated by the king who was always prepared to overthrow them. He died in [the] sixty third year of his age &amp; twenty first of his reign. He died of a wound which he received from his horse. William the Conqueror bequeathed his kingdom to William Rafas his son. Immediately after the death of his father he hastened to make preparations for securing his government. Conspiraces were forced against the new king which seemed to be about to produce a sudden revolution. He however succeeded so well in subduing the abject Britons that he soon found himself secure enough at home to march an army against his brother Henry who was then prince of Normandy he succeeded in the attempt of getting possession of that country and returning home remained in tolerably quiet possession of his throne for some years when an accident put an end to his life &amp; to all his ambitious projects he was killed in hunting which was the sole amusement of all the kings in those days. He was killed by an arrow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Prince Henry was hunting in the new forest with Rafas when intelligence of the death of that king was brought him and being aware of the advantages of his presence hastened to Winchester to secure the royal treasure. He met with much opposition from the keeper of the treasure but as he drew his sword &amp; threatened him with immediate death if he oppoed his designs he forced his to acquiece in this violence. He then went to London with the money where by gaining the addresses of the number of nobility he was suddenly saluted king. all this was done in less then 5 days after his brother's death. Robert another brother of the king went to Normandy &amp; took possession of that country. Henry hearing heard this sent an army there and conquered it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This prince was one of the most decomplished that has filled the English throne. He paid a visit to his daughter Matilda whose husband was possesor of Normandy and staid some time. whilst he was there the Welsh made an invasion into England and whilst he was preparing to return to his throne he died very suddenly in the 67 year of his age 35 of his reign leaving by will his daughter Matilda heir of all his dominions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Stephen notwithstanding the will of his uncle with regard to his daughter Matilda hastened to England &amp; was proclaimed king. There was however an insurrection in favour of Matilda and she was crowned. Stephen was sent to prison but as he was released in some short time he was again restored to his crown. The greater part of his reign was spent in civil wars. His advancement to the throne was not the means of procuring him either tranquillity nor happiness. Henry made an invasion on England &amp; soon subduing it was proclaimed king. In the midst of these calamities Stephen seized with a violent illness and died.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">No sooner had Henry II his successor seated himself on the throne than he began the establishment of justice and tranquillity, to which the kingdom had so long been a stranger &amp; which was very successful in restoring. In the beginning of his reign there was nothing very interesting but about the middle of it he went to Ireland &amp; took possession of the whole country. William king of Scotland was defeated with a good deal of his kingdom &amp; he was taken prisoner. It was said that Henry died of Grief from the undutiful behavior of his sons all of which but one (Geoffrey) treated him very cruely &amp; caused him much pain. The day after his death his son Richard who went to visit his dead body although his conduct towards him had been so criminal he was struck with horror at the sight &amp; cried out that he was the murderer of his father.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thus died in the 58[th] year of his age &amp; 31 of his reign the greatest prince of his time for wisdom, virtue, &amp; abilitites, and the most powerful in extent of dominions of any that had ever filled the English throne.</field>

The English were not very successful at the siege of Orleans but by the injustice &amp; inhumanity of the duke of Bedford the maid of Orleans was put to death. He pretended that she was taken within the bounds of his diocese. The University of Paris was mean enough to join in the request of having her tried by the court for sorcery , impiety, idolatry, and magic. After being condemned to death her sentence was mitigated and she was to be perpetually imprisoned and to be fed during life on bread and water. She was made to consent to wear female clothes and took an oath never to wear any others. Her enemies wishing to get her into some scrape placed a suit of men's apparel in her appartment and concealing themselves they saw her put them on and whilst she was thus equiped they rushed upon her. No pardon could be granted her, she was sentenced to be burnt in the market place of Raüen and it was accordingly executed.</field>
