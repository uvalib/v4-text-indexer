      <field name="heading_text">FOUR POEMS BY CARL SANDBURG</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HATS Hats, where do you belong? what is under you? On the rim of a skyscraper's forehead I looked down and saw: hats: fifty thousand hats: Swarming with a noise of bees and sheep, cattle and waterfalls, Stopping with a silence of sea grass, a silence of prairie corn. Hats : tell me your high hopes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PENNSYLVANIA I have been in Pennsylvania, In the Monongahela and the Hocking Valleys. In the blue Susquehanna On a Saturday morning I saw the mounted constabulary go by, I saw boys playing marbles. Spring and the hills laughed. And in places Along the Appalachian chain, I saw steel arms handling coal and iron, And I saw the white-cauliflower faces Of miners' wives waiting for the men to come home from the day's work. I made colour studies in crimson and violet Over the dust and domes of culm at sunset.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BROKEN-FACE GARGOYLES All I can give you is broken-face gargoyles. It is too early to sing and dance at funerals, Though I can whisper to you I am looking for an undertaker hum- ming a lullaby and throwing his feet in a swift and mystic buck- and-wing , now you see it and now you don't. Fish to swim a pool in your garden flashing a speckled silver, A basket of wine-saps filling your room with flame-dark for your eyes and the tang of valley orchards for your nose, Such a beautiful pail of fish, such a beautiful peck of apples, I cannot bring you now. It is too early and I am not footloose yet. I shall come in the night when I come with a hammer and saw. I shall come near your window, where you look out when your eyes open in the morning, And there I shall slam together bird-houses and bird-baths for wing- loose wrens and hummers to live in, birds with yellow wing tips to blur and buzz soft all summer, So I shall make little fool homes with doors, always open doors for all and each to run away when they want to. I shall come just like that even though now it is early and I am not yet footloose, Even though I am still looking for an undertaker with a raw, wind- bitten face and a dance in his feet. I make a date with you (put it down) for six o'clock in the evening a thousand years from now. All I can give you now is broken-face gargoyles. All I can give you now is a double gorilla head with two fish mouths and four eagle eyes hooked on a street wall, spouting water and looking two ways to the ends of the street for the new people, the young strangers, coming, coming, always coming. It is early. I shall yet be footloose.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JAZZ FANTASIA Image of page 294 Drum on your drums, batter on your banjoes, sob on the long cool winding saxophones. Go to it, O jazzmen. Sling your knuckles on the bottoms of the happy tin pans, let your trombones ooze, and go husha- husha-hush with the slippery sand-paper. Moan like an autumn wind high in the lonesome treetops, moan soft like you wanted somebody terrible, cry like a racing car slipping away from a motorcycle cop, bang-bang! you jazzmen, bang altogether drums, traps, banjoes, horns, tin cansâ€”make two people fight on the top of a stairway and scratch each other's eyes in a clinch tumbling down the stairs. Can the rough stuff . . . now a Mississippi steamboat pushes up the night river with a hoo-hoo-hoo-oo . . . and the green lanterns calling to the high soft stars . . . a red moon rides on the humps of the low river hills . . . go to it, O jazzmen.</field>
