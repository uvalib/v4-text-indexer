      <field name="fulltext">1: 'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house 2: Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse; 3: The stockings were hung by the chimney with care, 4: In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there; 5: The children were nestled all snug in their beds, 6: While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads; 7: And Mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap, 8: Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap; Engraving by T. C. Boyd 9: When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter, 10: I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter. 11: Away to the window I flew like a flash, 12: Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash. 13: The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow, 14: Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below, 15: When, what to my wondering eyes should appear, 16: But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny rein-deer, 17: With a little old driver, so lively and quick, 18: I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick. 19: More rapid than eagles his coursers they came, 20: And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name; Engraving by T. C. Boyd 21: "Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and Vixen! 22: On, Comet ! on, Cupid! on, Donder and Blitzen! 23: To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall! 24: Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!" 25: As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly, 26: When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky; 27: So up to the house-top the coursers they flew, 28: With the sleigh full of Toys, and St. Nicholas too. 29: And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof, 30: The prancing and pawing of each little hoof — Engraving by T. C. Boyd 31: As I drew in my head, and was turning around, 32: Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound. 33: He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot, 34: And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot; 35: A bundle of Toys he had flung on his back, 36: And he look'd like a pedlar just opening his pack. 37: His eyes — how they twinkled! his dimples how merry! 38: His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry! 39: His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow, 40: And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow; Engraving by T. C. Boyd 41: The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth, 42: And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath; 43: He had a broad face and a little round belly, 44: That shook when he laughed, like a bowlfull of jelly. 45: He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf, 46: And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself; 47: A wink of his eye and a twist of his head, 48: Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread; 49: He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work, 50: And fill'd all the stockings; then turned with a jerk, 51: And laying his finger aside of his nose, 52: And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose; 53: He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle, 54: And away they all flew like the down of a thistle. 55: But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight, 56: "Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night."</field>
