      <field name="fulltext">Ribby the cat dressed in a nice dress seated at a table writing a letter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ONCE upon a time there was a Pussy- cat called Ribby, who invited a little dog called Duchess to tea.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come in good time, my dear Duchess'' (said Ribby's letter), "and we will have something so very nice. I am baking it in a pie-dish—a pie-dish with a pink rim. You never tasted anything so good! And you shall eat it all! I will eat muffins, my dear Duchess!'' wrote Ribby.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Illustration of Text.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Duchess read the letter and wrote an answer:—"I will come with much pleasure at a quarter past four. But it is very strange. I was just going to invite you to come here, to supper, my dear Ribby, to eat something most delicious .''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will come very punctually, my dear Ribby,'' wrote Duchess; and then at the end she added—"I hope it isn't mouse?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And then she thought that did not look quite polite; so she scratched out "isn't mouse'' and changed it to "I hope it will be fine,'' and she gave her letter to the postman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But she thought a great deal about Ribby's pie, and she read Ribby's letter over and over again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am dreadfully afraid it will be mouse!'' said Duchess to herself—"I really couldn't, could n't eat mouse-pie. And I shall have to eat it, because it is a party. And my pie</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Duchess went into her larder, and took the pie off a shelf and looked at it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is all ready to put into the oven. Such lovely pie-crust; and I put in a little tin patty-pan to hold up the crust; and I Text page and Duchess, the dog, holding a pie. made a hole in the middle with a fork to let out the steam—Oh I do wish I could eat my own pie, instead of a pie made of mouse!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Duchess considered and considered and read Ribby' s letter again—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A pink and white pie-dish-and you shall eat it all . `You' means me—then Ribby is not going to even taste the pie herself? A pink and white pie-dish! Ribby is sure to go out to buy the muffins. . . . . Oh what a good idea! Why shouldn't I rush along and put my pie into Ribby's oven when Ribby isn't there?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Duchess was quite delighted with her own cleverness! Blank Page THE PIE MADE OF MOUSE. Watercolor image of Ribby cooking the mouse pie Text page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ribby in the meantime had received Duchess's answer, and as soon as she was sure that the little dog could come—she popped her pie into the oven. There were two ovens, one above the other; some other knobs and handles were only ornamental and not intended to open. Ribby put the pie into the lower oven; the door was very stiff.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The top oven bakes too quickly,'' said Ribby to herself. "It is a pie of the most delicate and tender mouse minced up with bacon. And I have taken out all the bones; because Duchess did nearly choke herself with a fish-bone last time I gave a party. She eats a little fast—rather big mouthfuls. But a most genteel and elegant little dog; infinitely superior company to Cousin Tabitha Twitchit.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ribby put on some coal and swept up the hearth. Then she went out with a pail to the well, for water to fill up the kettle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Text page with black and white drawing of Ribby, the cat, taking mats outside to be shaken.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then she began to set the room in order, for it was the sitting-room as well as the kitchen. She shook the mats out at the front-door and put them straight; the hearth-rug was a rabbit-skin. She dusted the clock and the ornaments on the mantel- piece, and she polished and rubbed the tables and chairs.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Then she spread a very clean white table- cloth, and set out her best china tea-set, which she took out of a wall-cupboard near the fire-place. The tea-cups were white with a pattern of pink roses; and the dinner-plates were white and blue.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Ribby had laid the table she took a jug and a blue and white dish, and went out down the field to the farm, to fetch milk and butter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When she came back, she peeped into the bottom oven; the pie looked very comfortable.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ribby put on her shawl and bonnet and went out again with a basket, to the village shop to buy a packet of tea, a pound of lump sugar, and a pot of marmalade.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And just at the same time, Duchess came out of her house, at the other end of the village.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Ribby met Duchess half-way down the street, also carrying a basket, covered with a cloth. They only bowed to one another; they did not speak, because they were going to have a party.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As soon as Duchess had got round the corner out of sight—she simply ran! Straight away to Ribby's house!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ribby went into the shop and bought Black and white drawing of Ribby holding her basket outside of Tabitha Twitchit's store. Two kittens are playing. Text image. what she required, and came out, after a pleasant gossip with Cousin Tabitha Twitchit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Cousin Tabitha was disdainful after- wards in conversation—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A little dog indeed! Just as if there were no CATS in Sawrey! And a pie for afternoon tea! The very idea!'' said Cousin Tabitha Twitchit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ribby went on to Timothy Baker's and bought the muffins. Then she went home.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There seemed to be a sort of scuffling noise in the back passage, as she was coming in at the front door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I trust that is not that Pie: the spoons are locked up, however,'' said Ribby.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But there was nobody there. Ribby opened the bottom oven door with some difficulty, and turned the pie. There began to be a pleasing smell of baked mouse!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Duchess in the meantime, had slipped out at the back door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is a very odd thing that Ribby's pie was not in the oven when I put mine in! And I can't find it anywhere; I have looked all over the house. I put my pie into a nice hot oven at the top . I could not turn any of the other handles; I think that they are all shams,'' said Duchess, "but I wish I could have removed the pie made of WHERE IS THE PIE MADE OF MOUSE?

I cannot think what she has done with it? I heard Ribby coming and I had to run out by the back door!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Duchess went home and brushed her beautiful black coat; and then she picked a bunch of flowers in her garden as a present for Ribby; and passed the time until the clock struck four.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Text page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ribby—having assured herself by careful search that there was really no one hiding in the cupboard or in the larder—went upstairs to change her dress.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She put on a lilac silk gown, for the party, and an embroidered muslin apron and tippet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is very strange,'' said Ribby, "I did not think I left that drawer pulled out; has somebody been trying on my mittens?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She came downstairs again, and made the tea, and put the teapot on the hob. She peeped again into the bottom oven, the pie had become a lovely brown, and it was steaming hot.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She sat down before the fire to wait for the little dog. "I am glad I used the bottom oven,'' said Ribby, "the top one would certainly have been very much too hot. I wonder why that cupboard door was open? Can there really have been some one in the house?''</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Very punctually at four o'clock, Duchess started to go to the party. She ran so fast through the village that she was too early, and she had to wait a little while in the lane that leads down to Ribby's house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wonder if Ribby has taken my pie out of the oven yet?'' said Duchess, "and whatever can have become of the other pie made of mouse?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At a quarter past four to the minute, there came a most genteel little tap-tappity. "Is Mrs. Ribston at home?'' inquired Duchess in the porch.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come in! and how do you do, my dear Duchess?'' cried Ribby. "I hope I see you well?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Quite well, I thank you, and how do you do, my dear Ribby?'' said Duchess. "I've brought you some flowers; what a delicious smell of pie!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, what lovely flowers! Yes, it is mouse and bacon!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do not talk about food, my dear Ribby,'' said Duchess; "what a lovely white tea- cloth! . . . . Is it done to a turn? Is it still in the oven?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think it wants another five minutes,'' said Ribby. "Just a shade longer; I will pour out the tea, while we wait. Do you take sugar, my dear Duchess?''</field>

      <field name="fulltext">"With pleasure, my dear Duchess; how beautifully you beg! Oh, how sweetly pretty!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Duchess sat up with the sugar on her nose and sniffed—</field>

      <field name="fulltext">She dropped the sugar in confusion, and had to go hunting under the tea-table, so she did not see which oven Ribby opened in order to get out the pie.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ribby set the pie upon the table; there was a very savoury smell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Duchess came out from under the table- cloth munching sugar, and sat up on a chair.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Text page with black and white drawing of Ribby, the cat, and Duchess, the dog, seated at the table for dinner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will first cut the pie for you; I am going to have muffin and marmalade,'' said Ribby.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you really prefer muffin? Mind the patty-pan!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" I beg your pardon?'' said Ribby.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"May I pass you the marmalade?'' said Duchess hurriedly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The pie proved extremely toothsome, and the muffins light and hot. They disappeared rapidly, especially the pie!</field>

      <field name="fulltext">"I think''—(thought the Duchess to herself)— "I think it would be wiser if I helped myself to pie; though Ribby did not seem to notice anything when she was cutting it. What very small fine pieces it has cooked into! I did not remember that I had minced it up so fine; I suppose this is a quicker oven than my own.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How fast Duchess is eating!'' thought Ribby to herself, as she a buttered her fifth muffin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The pie-dish was emptying rapidly! Duchess had had four servings already, and was fumbling with the spoon.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">"The patty-pan? my dear Duchess?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The patty-pan that held up the pie-crust,'' said Duchess, blushing under her black coat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I didn't put one in, my dear Duchess,'' said Ribby; "I don't think that it is necessary in pies made of mouse.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Duchess fumbled with the spoon—"I can't find it!'' she said anxiously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There isn't a patty-pan,'' said Ribby, looking perplexed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, indeed, my dear Ribby; where can it have gone to?'' said Duchess.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There most certainly is not one, my dear Duchess. I disapprove of tin articles in puddings and pies. It is most undesirable— (especially when people swallow in lumps!)'' she added in a lower voice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Text page with black and white drawing of Ribby, the cat, stirring her tea at table.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Duchess looked very much alarmed, and continued to scoop the inside of the pie-dish.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Duchess looked aghast, and tilted up the pie-dish.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have only four patty-pans, and they are all in the cupboard.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Duchess set up a howl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shall die! I shall die! I have swallowed a patty-pan! Oh, my dear Ribby, I do feel so ill!''</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Duchess moaned and whined and rocked herself about.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh I feel so dreadful. I have swallowed a patty-pan!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There was nothing in the pie,'' said Ribby severely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes there was , my dear Ribby, I am sure I have swallowed it!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Let me prop you up with a pillow, my dear Duchess; where do you think you feel it?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh I do feel so ill all over me, my dear Ribby; I have swallowed a large tin patty- pan with a sharp scalloped edge!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Shall I run for the doctor? I will just lock up the spoons!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh yes, yes! fetch Dr. Maggotty, my dear Ribby: he is a pie himself, he will certainly understand.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Text page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ribby settled Duchess in an armchair before the fire, and went out and hurried to the village to look for the doctor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She found him at the smithy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He was occupied in putting rusty nails into a bottle of ink, which he had obtained at the post office.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Gammon? ha! HA!'' said he, with his head on one side.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ribby explained that her guest had swallowed a patty-pan.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Spinach? ha! HA!'' said he, and accompanied her with alacrity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He hopped so fast that Ribby had to run. It was most conspicuous. All the village could see that Ribby was fetching the doctor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I knew they would over-eat themselves!'' said Cousin Tabitha Twitchit.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">"How could I have swallowed it! such a large thing as a patty-pan!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She got up and went to the table, and felt inside the pie-dish again with a spoon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No; there is no patty-pan, and I put one in; and nobody has eaten pie except me, so I must have swallowed it!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Text page with black and white drawing of Duchess, the dog, seated in a chair.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She sat down again, and stared mournfully at the grate. The fire crackled and danced, and something sizz-z-zled!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Duchess started! She opened the door of the top oven;— out came a rich steamy flavour of veal and ham, and there stood a fine brown pie,— and through a hole in the top of the pie- crust there was a glimpse of a little tin patty-pan!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Duchess drew a long breath—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then I must have been eating MOUSE! . . . NO wonder I feel ill. . . . But perhaps I should feel worse if I had really swallowed a patty-pan!'' Duchess reflected—"What a very awkward thing to have to explain to Ribby! I think I will put my pie in the Text page with black and white drawing of Duchess, the dog, walking out the door with her pie back-yard and say nothing about it. When I go home, I will run round and take it away.'' She put it outside the back-door, and sat down again by the fire, and shut her eyes; when Ribby arrived with the doctor, she seemed fast asleep.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Gammon, ha, HA?'' said the doctor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am feeling very much better,'' said Duchess, waking up with a jump.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">"I think I should feel quite well if he only felt my pulse,'' said Duchess, backing away from the magpie, who sidled up with something in his beak.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">"Gammon? Gammon?'' said the doctor, while Duchess coughed and choked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't say that again!'' said Ribby, losing her temper—"Here, take this bread and jam, and get out into the yard!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Gammon and Spinach! ha ha HA!'' shouted Dr. Maggotty triumphantly out- side the back door. . . . . .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am feeling very much better, my dear Ribby,'' said Duchess. "Do you not think that I had better go home before it gets dark?''</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Ribby and Duchess said good-bye affectionately, and Duchess started home. Half-way up the lane she stopped and looked back; Ribby had gone in and shut her door. Duchess slipped through the fence, and ran round to the back of Ribby's house, and peeped into the yard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Upon the roof of the pig-stye sat Dr. Maggotty and three jackdaws. The jackdaws were eating pie-crust, and the magpie was drinking gravy out of a patty-pan.</field>
