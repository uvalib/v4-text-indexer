      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Theodore Dreiser shows admirable craftsmanship in "The Financier" (Harpers). This is the story of the career of Frank Cowperwood, who from small beginnings grows to be a commanding figure in the financial world. His sensational success, which comes after a failure and some months in prison, comes from his shrewdness in appreciating the significance of the failure of Jay Cooke and Company, which caused the panic of 1873, and speculating accordingly. As a picture of a certain type of strong-willed, able, brilliant, unscrupulous men of business, as a study of financial conditions during an interesting period and as a stirring narrative, "The Financier" deserves high praise. But Arnold Bennett has mentioned Mr. Dreiser as a writer, "whose work truly reflects current literary tendencies." And this comment is unfortunately true. This book shows the effect of deliberately reflecting "current literary tendencies," in its studied sordidness and highly artificial eroticism. There is a definite and unsuccessful attempt at realism in the description of Cowperwood's love-affairs, an attempt which in some places makes almost ridiculous what might have been an admirable piece of work.</field>
