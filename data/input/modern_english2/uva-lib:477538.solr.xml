      <field name="fulltext">I. 1: Still was the night, serene and bright, 2: when all Men sleeping lay; 3: Calm was the season, and carnal reason 4: thought so 'twould last for aye. 5: "Soul take thine ease, let sorrow cease, 6: much good thou hast in store; 7: This was their song their cups among 8: the evening before.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II. 9: Wallowing in all kind of Sin, 10: vile Wretches lay secure; 11: The best of men had scarcely then 12: their Lamps kept in good ure. 13: Virgins unwise, who through disguise 14: amongst the best were number'd, 15: Had clos'd their eyes; yea, and the Wise 16: through sloth and frailty slumber'd.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III. 17: Like as of old, when men grew bold 18: God's threat'nings to contemn, 19: Who stopt their ear, and would not hear 20: when Mercy warnéd them? 21: But took their course, without remorse, 22: till God began to pour 23: Destructi-on the world upon, 24: in a tempestuous show'r</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV. 25: Who put away the evil day 26: and drown'd their cares and fears, 27: Till drown'd were they, and swept away 28: by vengeance unawares; 29: So at the last, whilst men sleep fast 30: in their security, 31: Surpris'd they are in such a snare 32: As cometh suddenly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">V. 33: For at midnight breaks forth a light, 34: which turns the night to day; 35: And speedily an hideous cry 36: doth all the World dismay. 37: Sinners awake, their hearts do ache, 38: trembling their loins surpriseth; 39: Amaz'd with fear, by what they hear, 40: each one of them ariseth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VI. 41: They rush from beds with giddy heads, 42: and to their windows run, 43: Viewing this light, which shines more bright 44: than doth the noon-day Sun. 45: Straightway appears (they see't with tears) 46: the Son of God most dread, 47: Who with his Train comes on amain 48: to judge both Quick and Dead.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VII. 49: Before his face the Heav'ns give place, 50: and Skies are rent asunder, 51: With mighty voice and hideous noise, 52: more terrible than Thunder. 53: His Brightness damps Heav'n's glorious Lamps, 54: and makes them hide their heads; 55: As if afraid, and quite dismay'd, 56: they quit their wonted steads.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VIII. 57: Ye sons of men that durst contemn 58: the Threat'nings of God's Word, 59: How cheer you now? Your hearts, I trow, 60: are thrill'd as with a sword. 61: Now Atheist blind, whose brutish mind 62: a God could never see, 63: Dost thou perceive, dost now believe 64: that Christ thy Judge shall be?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IX. 65: Stout Courages, (whose hardiness 66: could Death and Hell outface) 67: Are you as bold, now you behold 68: your Judge draw near apace? 69: They cry, "No, no: Alas! and woe! 70: our courage all is gone: 71: Our hardiness, (fool hardiness) 72: hath us undone, undone!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">X. 73: No heart so bold, but now grows cold, 74: and almost dead with fear; 75: No eye so dry but now can cry, 76: and pour out many a tear. 77: Earth's Potentates and pow'rful States, 78: Captains and Men of Might 79: Are quite abasht, their courage dasht. 80: At this most dreadful sight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XI. 81: Mean men lament, great men do rent 82: their Robes, and tear their hair; 83: They do not spare their flesh to tear 84: through horrible despair. 85: All kindreds wail; all hearts do fail; 86: Horror the World doth fill 87: With weeping eyes and loud out-cries, 88: yet knows not how to kill.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XII. 89: Some hide themselves in Caves and Delves, 90: in places under ground: 91: Some rashly leap into the Deep, 92: to 'scape by being drown'd: 93: Some to the Rocks, (O sensless blocks!) 94: and woody Mountains run, 95: That there they might this fearful sight 96: and dreaded Presence shun.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XIII. 97: In vain do they to Mountains say, 98: "Fall on us, and us hide 99: From Judges ire, more hot then Fire, 100: For who may it abide?" 101: No hiding place can from his Face 102: sinners at all conceal, 103: Whose flaming Eye hid things doth spy, 104: and darkest things reveal.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XIV. 105: The Judge draws nigh, exalted high 106: upon a lofty Throne, 107: Amidst the throng of Angels strong, 108: lo, Israel's Holy One! 109: The excellence of whose Presence, 110: and awful Majesty, 111: Amazeth Nature, and every Creature 112: doth more than terrify.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XV. 113: The Mountains smoke, the Hills are shook, 114: the Earth is rent and torn, 115: As if she should be clean dissolv'd, 116: or from her center born. 117: The Sea doth roar, forsakes the shore, 118: and shrinks away for fear; 119: The wild beasts flee into the sea 120: so soon as he draws near,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XVI. 121: Whose Glory bright, whose wond'rous Might, 122: whose Power Imperial, 123: So far surpass whatever was 124: in Realms Terrestrial; 125: That tongues of men (nor Angel's pen) 126: Cannot the same express; 127: And therefore I must pass it by, 128: lest speaking should transgress.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XVII. 129: Before his Throne a Trump is blown, 130: proclaiming th'Day of Doom; 131: Forthwith he cries, "Ye dead arise 132: and unto Judgement come." 133: No sooner said, but 'tis obey'd; 134: Sepulchers open'd are; 135: Dead bodies all rise at his call, 136: and's mighty Power declare.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XVIII. 137: Both Sea and Land at his command, 138: their Dead at once surrender; 139: The Fire and Air constrainéd are 140: also their dead to tender. 141: The mighty Word of this great Lord 142: links Body and Soul together, 143: Both of the Just and the unjust, 144: to part no more for ever.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XIX. 145: The same translates from Mortal states 146: to Immortality, 147: All that survive and be alive, 148: in th' twinkling of an eye; 149: That so they may abide for aye 150: to endless weal or woe: 151: Both the Renate and Reprobate 152: are made to die no moe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XX. 153: His wingéd Hosts fly through all coasts, 154: together gathering 155: Both good and bad, both Quick and Dead, 156: and all to Judgement bring. 157: Out of their holes those creeping Moles, 158: that hid themselves for fear, 159: By force they take, and quickly make 160: before the Judge appear.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXI. 161: Thus every one before the Throne 162: of Christ the Judge is brought, 163: Both rightéous and impious, 164: that good or ill hath wrought. 165: A separation and diff'ring station 166: by Christ appointed is 167: (To sinners sad) 'twixt good and bad, 168: 'twixt Heirs of woe and bliss.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXII. 169: At Christ's right hand the Sheep do stand, 170: his holy Martyrs, who 171: For his dear Name suffering shame, 172: calamity and woe, 173: Like Champions stood, and with their Blood 174: their Testimony séaled; 175: Whose innocence without offence 176: to Christ their Judge appealéd.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXIII. 177: Next unto whom there find a room, 178: all Christ's afflicted ones, 179: Who being chastis'd, neither despis'd, 180: nor sank amidsts their groans; 181: Who by the Rod were turn'd to God, 182: and loved him the more, 183: Not murmuring nor quarrelling 184: when they were chast'ned sore.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXIV. 185: Moreover, such as lovéd much, 186: that had not such a trial, 187: As might constrain to so great pain, 188: and such deep self-denial, 189: Yet ready were the Cross to bear, 190: when Christ them call'd thereto, 191: And did rejoice to hear his voice, 192: they're counted Sheep also.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXV. 193: Christ's flock of Lambs there also stands, 194: whose Faith was weak, yet true, 195: All sound Believers (Gospel receivers) 196: whose Grace was small, but grew. 197: And them among an Infant throng 198: of Babes, for whom Christ died; 199: Whom for his own, by ways unknown 200: to Men, he sanctified.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXVI. 201: All stand before their Savi-or, 202: in long white Robes yclad, 203: Their countenance full of pleasance, 204: appearing wond'rous glad. 205: O glorious sight! Behold how bright 206: dust-heaps are made to shine, 207: Conforméd so their Lord unto, 208: whose Glory is Divine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXVII. 209: At Christ's left hand the Goats do stand, 210: all whining Hypocrites 211: Who for self-ends did seem Christ's friends, 212: but foster'd guileful sprites; 213: Who Sheep resembled, but they dissembled 214: (their hearts were not sincere) 215: Who once did throng Christ's Lambs among; 216: but now must not come near.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXVIII. 217: Apostates base and run-aways, 218: such as have Christ forsaken, 219: Of whom the the Devil, with seven more evil, 220: hath fresh possession taken; 221: Sinners ingrain, reserv'd to pain 222: and torments most severe 223: Because 'gainst light they sinn'd with spite, 224: are also placéd there.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXIX. 225: There also stand a num'rous band, 226: that no profession made 227: Of Godliness, nor to redress 228: their ways at all essay'd; 229: Who better knew, but (sinful Crew) 230: Gospel and Law despiséd, 231: Who all Christ's knocks withstood like blocks, 232: and would not be adviséd.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXX. 233: Moreover, there with them appear 234: a number, numberless, 235: Of great and small, vile wretches all, 236: that did God's Law transgress; 237: Idolaters, false worshippers, 238: Profaners of God's Name, 239: Who not at all thereon did call, 240: or took in vain the same.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXXI. 241: Blasphemers lewd, and Swearers shrewd, 242: scoffers at Purity, 243: That hated God, contemn'd his Rod, 244: and lov'd Security; 245: Sabbath-polluters, Saints-persecuters, 246: presumptuous men, and proud, 247: Who never lov'd those that reprov'd; 248: all stand amongst this crowd.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXXII. 249: Adulterers and Whoremongers 250: were there, with all unchast; 251: There Covetous and Ravenous, 252: that Riches got too fast: 253: Who us'd vile ways themselves to raise 254: t'Estates and worldly wealth, 255: Oppression by or knavery, 256: by force, or fraud, or stealth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXXIII. 257: Moreover, there together were 258: Children flagiti-ous, 259: And Parents who did them undo 260: by nature vici-ous. 261: False-witness-bearers and self-forswearers, 262: Murd'rers and Men of Blood, 263: Witches, Enchanters, and Ale-house haunters, 264: beyond account there stood.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">XXXVII. 289: With dismal chains and strong reins, 290: like Prisoners of Hell, 291: They're held in place before Christ's face, 292: till He their Doom shall tell. 293: These void of tears, but fill'd with fears, 294: and dreadful expectation 295: Of endless pains and scalding flames, 296: stand waiting for Damnation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXXVIII. 297: All silence kept, both Goats and Sheep, 298: before the Judge's Throne; 299: With mild aspect to his Elect 300: then speaks the Holy One; 301: "My Sheep draw near, your Sentence hear, 302: which is to you no dread, 303: Who clearly now discern and know 304: your sins are pardonéd.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXXIX. 305: "'Twas meet that ye should judgéd be, 306: that so the world may spy 307: No cause of grudge, when as I judge 308: and deal impartially. 309: Know therefore all both great and small, 310: the ground and reason why 311: These Men do stand at my right hand, 312: and look so cheerfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XL. 313: "These men be those my Father chose 314: before the World's foundation, 315: And to me gave, that I should save 316: from Death and Condemnation; 317: For whose dear sake I flesh did take, 318: was of a Woman born, 319: And did inure myself t'endure 320: unjust reproach and scorn.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XLI. 321: "For them it was that I did pass 322: through sorrows many a one; 323: That I drank up that bitter Cup 324: which made me sigh and groan. 325: The Cross's pain I did sustain; 326: yea more, my Father;s ire 327: I underwent, my Blood I spent 328: to save them from Hell-fire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XLII. 329: "Thus I esteeméd, thus I redeeméd 330: all these from every Nation, 331: That they might be (as now you see) 332: a chosen Generation. 333: What if ere while they were as vile 334: and bad as any be, 335: And yet from all their guilt and thrall 336: at once I set them free?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XLIII. 337: "My grace to one is wrong to none; 338: none can Election claim; 339: Amongst all those their souls that lose, 340: none can Rejection blame. 341: He that may choose, or else refuse, 342: all men to save or spill, 343: May this Man choose, and that refuse, 344: redeeming whom he will.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XLIV. 345: "But as for those whom I have chose 346: Salvation's heirs to be, 347: I underwent their punishment, 348: and therefore set them free. 349: I bore their grief, and their relief 350: by suffering procur'd, 351: That they of bliss and happiness 352: might firmly be assur'd.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XLV. 353: "And this my grace they did embrace, 354: believing on my Name; 355: Which Faith was true, the fruits do shew 356: proceeding from the same;— 357: Their Penitence, their Pati-ence, 358: their Love and Self-denial; 359: In suff'ring losses and bearing Crosses, 360: when put upon the trial;—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XLVI. 361: "Their sin forsaking, their cheerful taking 362: my Yoke, their Charity 363: Unto the Saints in all their wants, 364: and in them unto me;— 365: These things do clear, and make appear 3:3. 366: their Faith to be unfeignéd, 367: And that a part in my desert 368: and purchase they have gainéd.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XLVII. 369: "Their debts are paid, their peace is made, 370: their sins remitted are; 371: Therefore at once I do pronounce, 372: and openly declare, 373: That Heav'n is theirs, that they be Heirs 374: of Life and of Salvation; 375: Nor ever shall they come at all 376: to Death or to Damnation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XLVIII. 377: "Come blessed Ones and sit on Thrones, 378: judging the World with me; 379: Come and possess your happiness, 380: and bought felicity; 381: Henceforth no fears, no care, no tears, 382: no sin shall you annoy, 383: Nor any thing that grief doth bring: 384: Eternal Rest enjoy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XLIX. 385: "You bore the Cross, you suffer'd loss 386: of all for my Name's sake; 387: Receive the Crown that's now your own; 388: come, and a Kingdom take." 389: Thus spake the Judge: the wicked grudge, 390: and grind their teeth in vain; 391: They see with groans these plac'd on Thrones 392: which addeth to their pain:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">L. 393: That those whom they did wrong and slay, 394: must now their Judgement see! 395: Such whom they slighted and once despited, 396: must now their Judges be! 397: Thus 'tis decreed, such is their meed, 398: and guerdon glorious; 399: With Christ they sit, judging it fit 400: to plague the Impious.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LI. 401: The wicked are brought to the Bar. 402: like guilty Malefactors, 403: That oftentimes of bloody Crimes 404: and Treasons have been Actors. 405: Of wicked Men, none are so mean 406: as there to be neglected; 407: Nor none so high in dignity 408: as there to be respected.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LII. 409: The glorious Judge will privilege 410: nor Emperor nor King; 411: But every one that hath misdone 412: doth into judgement bring. 413: And every one that hath misdone, 414: the Judge impartially 415: Condemneth to eternal woe, 416: and endless misery.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LIII. 417: Thus one and all, thus great and small, 418: the Rich as well as Poor, 419: And those of place, as the most base, 420: do stand the Judge before. 421: They are arraign'd, and there detain'd 422: before Christ's Judgement seat 423: With trembling fear their Doom to hear, 424: and feel his Anger's heat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LIV. 425: There Christ demands at all their hands 426: a strict and straight account 427: Of all things done under the Sun; 428: whose number far surmount 429: Man's wit and thought: yet all are brought 430: unto this solemn Trial; 431: And each offence with evidence, 432: so that there's no denial.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LV. 433: There's no excuse for their abuse, 434: since their own Consciences 435: More proof give in of each Man's sin; 436: than thousand Witnesses. 437: Though formerly this faculty 438: had grossly been abuséd, 439: (Men could it stifle, or with it trifle, 440: when as it them accuséd.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LVI. 441: Now it comes in, and every sin 442: unto Men's charge doth lay; 443: It judgeth them and doth condemn, 444: though all the World say nay. 445: It so stingeth and tortureth, 446: it worketh such distress, 447: That each Man's self against himself, 448: is forcéd to confess.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LVII. 449: It's vain, moreover, for Men to cover 450: the least Iniquity; 451: The Judge hath seen and privy been 452: to all their villany. 453: He unto light and open sight 454: the work of darkness brings; 455: He doth unfold both new old, 456: both known and hidden things.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LVIII. 457: All filthy facts and secret acts, 458: however closely done, 459: And long conceal'd, are there reveal'd 460: before the mid-day Sun. 461: Deeds of the night, shunning the light, 462: which darkest corners sought, 463: To fearful blame, and endless shame, 464: are there most justly brought.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LIX. 465: And as all facts, and grosser acts, 466: so every word and thought, 467: Erroneous notion and lustful motion, 468: are into Judgement brought. 469: No Sin so small and trivial, 470: but hither it must come; 471: Nor so long past but now at last 472: it must receive a doom.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LX. 473: At this sad season, Christ asks a Reason      and 474: (with just austerity) 475: Of Grace refus'd, of light abus'd 476: so oft, so wilfully; 477: Of Talents lent, by them misspent, 478: and on their Lust bestown; 479: Which if improv'd as it behoov'd, 480: Heav'n might have been their own;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LXI. 481: Of times neglected, of means rejected, 482: of God's long-suffering 483: And Pati-ence, to Penitence 484: that sought hard hearts to bring; 485: Why chords of love did nothing move, 486: to shame or to remorse? 487: Why warnings grave, and counsels have 488: nought chang'd their sinful course?</field>
