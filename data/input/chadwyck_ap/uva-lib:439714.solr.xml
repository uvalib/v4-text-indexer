      <field name="fulltext">I DRAMATIC VERSES My dear Bay: This is for Bessie and you, if you will find room for it among better things. Paris, 1902. KALYPSO Then sang Kalypso yet another song. And it was waxen late. Beyond her isle, Beyond the sea and world hung drearily A full moon. Quiet was, except the wind Lifting the water's murmur as a girl May lift the fold of some sad Eastern silk. One cloud, a presage, loitered. All the air Was marvellous and sorrowful, as of Jasmine sea-touched and roses pale with spray, Of fading oleander, clematis Grown weary on the garden wall. Anon The cold salt wind did rise and scatter all Odours: a little chill, then quietude. So here did mix the land's breath and the sea's. And still she paused. Her solemn lips, possessed By that shy thought that comes before a song, Were silent. And he raised his languid arm. Clasping it all she turnèd on him then The earnest heaven of her desirous eyes; Drew him about her feet, against her knees, Closer; and rested in his hair one hand. The other alone, moving so musical That her low notes were not more song than it, Described the region of the sinking moon, While soft and even a most unhappy strain, The modulation of an endless grief, Flowed from her lips. And tiredly she sang: “She says: ‘Follow my steps and take my hand To where the shoreward sea falls colourless And light is growing less, grows ever less Yet quencheth never; where the seas expand And shrink, where nothing altereth. I stand Upon that melancholy marge of sand. “‘The Earth was made; yet then was I alone, Walking this skyey meadow's nodding gold. I've seen her freshest garden turnèd old And men grow mortal in her beds of stone. But I am still alone, and near the sun Sometimes I think my heart is waxen cold For having been so very long alone.’” Her voice was richer with the widening song. Light came and went, colour reposed and fled About her face. There in the swarty night She shone like opal, flickering weird flame And crossed with splendour. On his neck her hand Quivered; he felt her blood throb; languidly Thro' closing eyelids of the soul he saw The world dissolve in rosiness. She sang: “‘Come! so long have I looked on thee, so long That my gold lids are heavy with desire; My arms for waiting here in heaven tire; My throat is tuneless with unceasèd song. Where nothing is and day and night prolong Each other in the sober twilight fire, Give me thy soul for having looked so long. “‘I go below. Follow thou in my trace And taste my solitude. There all the air Becomes a lover feeling love so rare. The chilly wave walks nearer yet to share The rhythm and ecstasy of our embrace, And evening jealous of our flushèd face Goes out in sad retire and pale despair. “‘And while upon that solitary sand The ripples burn away their fringe of light And after me drawn down the heavenly night Unnumbered stars fall throbbing to the land, Let all the glamour of my courses waned Possess thy soul in lingering delight,— Let me in darkness feel thy failing hand.’” Over his head she stooped. Her odorous hair Fell thickly o'er his face. She kissèd him With all the sleepy honeys of her soul. Her arms did slip along his neck, his breast; She kissed him lazily upon the lids And languorously on the brow, she kissed him Trembling and fiery on the opened mouth. And slowly— Wind rose. Rustles crept to 's ear. Thro' meshes of her hair he saw gray-blown The thick tumultuous cloud blotted and streaked With witchery of dead moon. The midnight whirred. Sparsely the windy stars and feebly hung. A little withered leaf blew by; it scratched Him with its frittered edge. For it was autumn. Autumn it was. Then did he know. No more That year would he return, that year no more; Rather, locked by the vastly circular Walls o' the sea, the quashing roof of heaven, Still suffocated in the changeless air, Still vexed by incessant memory and recall, Would stand in pain desirous of that dear Fireside and her more dear and beautiful— O curse to exile! Horrid ire shook him. He started from her embrace, muttered, struggled,— Then sudden came into dominion Of his great self. He stood and said to her, “Thou art more masterful than death. The life That spurred me thro' the waters of the world Was spent indeed,—and claimed again, O love, Upon thy soul's warm shore.” And amorously, she thought, He neared her, lifted her. They drew toward Her dwelling. To herself she seemèd queen Over his love, and on the forward heaven Of her retreating hope she lit the stars Of happy hours, of happy days,—the crown Of long desire; and drank of his embrace A dear oblivion of sad doubt: the while He plotted to beguile this woman here, Gaoler of Fate, to drug her love asleep, That ere his death tho' waxen old he'd see Were't but the smoke of tree-clad Ithaca. [1896] ONCE That day her eyes were deep as night. She had the motion of the rose, The bird that veers across the light, The waterfall that leaps and throws Its irised spindrift to the sun. She seemed a wind of music passing on. Alone I saw her that one day Stand in the window of my life. Her sudden hand melted away Under my lips, and without strife I held her in my arms awhile And drew into my lips her living smile,— Now many a day ago and year! Since when I dream and lie awake In summer nights to feel her near, And from the heavy darkness break Glitters, till all my spirit swims And her hand hovers on my shaking limbs. If once again before I die I drank the laughter of her mouth And quenched my fever utterly, I say, and should it cost my youth, 'T were well! for I no more should wait Hammering midnight on the doors of fate. [1902] IN THE PAST There lies a somnolent lake Under a noiseless sky, Where never the mornings break Nor the evenings die. Mad flakes of colour Whirl on its even face Iridescent and streaked with pallour; And, warding the silent place, The rocks rise sheer and gray From the sedgeless brink to the sky Dull-lit with the light of pale half-day Thro' a void space and dry. And the hours lag dead in the air With a sense of coming eternity To the heart of the lonely boatman there: That boatman am I, I, in my lonely boat, A waif on the somnolent lake, Watching the colours creep and float With the sinuous track of a snake. Now I lean o'er the side And lazy shades in the water see, Lapped in the sweep of a sluggish tide Crawled in from the living sea; And next I fix mine eyes, So long that the heart declines, On the changeless face of the open skies Where no star shines; And now to the rocks I turn, To the rocks, around That lie like walls of a circling urn Wherein lie bound The waters that feel my powerless strength And meet my homeless oar Labouring over their ashen length Never to find a shore. But the gleam still skims At times on the somnolent lake, And a light there is that swims With the whirl of a snake; And tho' dead be the hours i' the air, And dayless the sky, The heart is alive of the boatman there: That boatman am I. ONEIROPOLOS Come, Sakhi. Here within this edge of shade We'll stand against the house-wall shadow-cooled. There's no one left at noon in the Agora To quib their fortune of my dozen birds. The town—the world, these poor Athenians think— Goes home and half asleep. Their prattling stops. And burned by sunlight thro' the stifling hours, Temple and house, statue and wall and road Glow as hot copper. But here shadow dwells; And here by the sun-stricken afternoon I stand leaning my head, and close my eyes. A red light swims my brain awhile, then goes; And unto memory I surrender me Of all my master Brihadashua said, My blessèd master pure and charitable Who dwelt in Kashi by the holy stream. Happy indeed was I, happy to count A wizard in my kindred such as he, Whose lips were wholly dedicate to truth, Whose hand dispensed serene and wonderful Peace to the spirit as a tree his shade. To him, as one who rushes head aflame, Kindled and dry with fever, toward shore, I went; and most divinely pitiful He taught me wisdom. To his voice I turned As turns a lotus to the rosy dawn, Filling with light, gathering treasure thence To keep within its heart all the day long. Sometime he spake, and all were blest; sometime Silent we sat within the pale and help Of all his thought. Continually did fall The pleasant dew of patience from his eye, Which looking ever beyond world and star Was large as upper heaven. They were the days When I had laid the world to rest within me And, tho' with childish lips, did after him Say as in dream the holy syllables. He died,—rather, I heard him never more. His final earthly errand, whilst his mind, Quitting our vain and pitiable scene, Dissolved, he gave me in trust. I quit the shore Of holy Ganga's healing water-wave, Long travelled, breathed of many airs, reviewed Forests of sandal, where the Spring wind blew, And tender-petalled lily-beds, whereo'er The gray crane spanned his gracious, level flight. Westward I followed, following every day In quest of that he bade me. At the last I beheld Sindhus, and my errand 's done. Hear, Sakhi, yet awhile my destiny. The burning season shone. I stayed—too late. The people's rumour told of a great host, Yavanas named, from the utter unknown lands, Generalled by a god and more innumerable Than drops in rainy season; giants all, That tramped about the edges of the world And rose like a live night of crying birds Across and thro' high heaven, then fell to earth— What needs the many words? The Greeks were on. One midday hour the world did leap apart, And thence a thirsty multitude in riot, With women, gold, flocks, armour, camels, coins; Maddened with hunger for another world; Each vagabond upon his empty heart An empire's jewel scattering the light. They sacked the land, then weary sat them down, And with a million mouths and voices cried They'd walk the wide and feeble earth no more. So spake the children and the world obeyed. Oceanward, between patient Sindhus' shores, The locusts moved, leaving a piteous land, With goods and gold and men, whereof was I. Over a milky ocean torn with flame And faced with greenish current, 'long a shore Crusted with yellow sand, beneath a sky Of endless sun, they lived and sailed and died. Then for a little year the millions tramped Thro' deserts flat as sea and gray as cloud, Till they saw finally a shore. And ships Bore them 'twixt isle and isle, after the sun, Into the port yonder, Peiraios called, To rest. 'T was home, they said; and all men wept. I found their painted fanes and naked gods And all these children babbling in the sun. First did I hunger, knowing no trick or trade, Knowing nothing that sold brings money in. I talked not, nor could understand at all This Grecian race of laughter, pleasure, song. Pity, nor giving alms, nor anything That makes the spirit pure, is here. They live, And suffer the forgetfulness of life. This is my tale: One night I walked abroad Ere dawn a dreary hour, the market-place More dark than any jungle. Cold it was. I walked, when five cold fingers touched my arm,— Beside, a Phrygian slave. Often I'd seen Him and his fortune-table's dozen birds,— “Oneiropolos” called, “seller of dreams.” He looked me in the eyes and took my arm And led me here; awhile rehearsed his tricks: Teased with his forefinger a bird's soft throat,— Which leapt on't, pecked and picked one single card. So did the Phrygian seven times, and went. Over Akropolis was golden dawn. Their naked gods all bloomed with light. The dark In violet veils dissolved down the steep heaven, And I stood here, selling to Athens dreams. A dying town filled of a feeble race, Small gossips of their all-expressing tongue, Dancers and frolickers, philosophers Drunken and sense-tied to the trembling world. Hither from fifty climes men come and come, Women and children come to see—'t is strange!— This city of the old and marble things. 'T was miracle, say they, what sights were seen Here, Sakhi, one great hundred years agone— For they count Time upon their nervous hand. Galleys and chariots, beauty, victory, gold, And gods they had, whose fair procession walked With maidens, cattle, priests and horse; whereof Up in the shadows of the fane, yonder, Is marble picture by a studied hand. So at their pretty game the children played Building and singing on.—But all is gone. 'T is vision, tale of poets, memory, nothing; Now there is void shadow, blown by wind, And the unstoried year is rolled away. Here in the dying town I sell them dreams, Here where the Phrygian stood. At evening I knock at yonder gate in the High Wall, And enter. Courteously a gentle man Leads me within, to shade. Upon his lips Their chattering Greek is low and lovelier. I sit me down. My supper bowl of rice He gives, saying, “My friend, rejoice in peace.” Down thro' his olive orchard, shadowy And still and secret as the things of Ind, The lily-like soft evening gathers dark. Blest is his pious deed; for many hear The spoken solace of his quietude. To him what little coin I gather here, Not in exchange or manner of the West, I bring. For Epicurus aids the poor. Peace! My words are many. Now peace to thee! For yonder comes as ever at this time Phryne, the rose and glory of their world. Her veil is wove of sunrise, and her face The white moon set between two clouds of black. Her eye 's a firefly and her voice a viol. She walks as when a bird follows the sea. Here daily falls her piece of gold,—she 's rich And timid as the shining meteor, And hovers mothlike round her destiny; For all her wings and beauty are for sale. [1897] LUCRETIUS Sperata Voluptas Suavis Amicitiae Slow Spring that, slipping thro' the silver light, Like some young wanderer now returnest home After strange years, How like to me! to mine thy timorous plight! Who quietly near my friendship's altar come Where yet no God appears. By many a deed I sought to win his love, Made him a wreath of all my songs and hours,— Most vain, most fair! Now falls about the shroud my years have wove; My evening drops her large, slow purple flowers Thro' gardens of gold air. To him this verse, to him this crown of leaves, My supreme piety shall I commend: This is my last, Wreathed of what Youth endows and Age bereaves, Bound by the fingers of a lover and friend, Green with the vital past. We sunder, he my Truth, I the desire. I spread my wooing fingers, I would earn His least address: But parcels of the heaven-dispersèd fire, Sky-severed exiles, we divinely learn To suffer loneliness. My life was little in joy, little in pain; Mine were the wise denials, with none I coped To win the sky; And when I surely saw my love was vain— The joy of his sweet friendship I had hoped— I stilled. Now let me die,— Now that the endless wind is growing warm, Richer the star, and flowers on many a slope Undo their sheath; O let us yield to life's divinest charm That lured us thro' the blasted field of hope, Let us return to death. [1895] AGE IN YOUTH From far she's come, and very old, And very soiled with wandering. The dust of seasons she has brought Unbidden to this field of Spring. She's halted at the log-barred gate. The May-day waits, a tangled spill Of light that weaves and moves along The daisied margin of the hill, Where Nature bares her bridal heart, And on her snowy soul the sun Languors desirously and dull, An amorous pale vermilion. She 's halted, propped her rigid arms, With dead big eyes she drinks the west; The brown rags hang like clotted dust About her, save her withered breast. A very soilure of a dream Runs in the furrows of her brow, And with a crazy voice she croons An ugly catch of long ago. Its broken rhythm is hard and hoarse, Its sunken soul of music toils In precious ashes, dust of youth And lovely faces sorrow soils. But look! Along the molten sky There runs strange havoc of the sun. “What a strange sight this is,” she says, “I'll cross the field, I'll follow on.” The bars are falling from the gate. The meshes of the meadow yield; And trudging sunsetward she draws A journey thro' the daisy field. The daisies shudder at her hem. Her dry face laughs with flowery light; An aureole lifts her soiled gray hair: “I'll on,” she says, “to see this sight.” In the rude math her torn shoe mows Juices of trod grass and crushed stalk Mix with a soiled and earthy dew, With smear of petals gray as chalk. The Spring grows sour along her track; The winy airs of amethyst Turn acid. “Just beyond the ledge,” She says, “I'll see the sun at rest.” And to the tremor of her croon, Her old, old catch of long ago, The newest daisies of the grass She shreds and passes on below. ... The sun is gone where nothing is And the black-bladed shadows war. She came and passed, she passed along That wet, black curve of scimitar. In vain the flower-lifting morn With golden fingers to uprear The weak Spring here shall pause awhile: This is a scar upon the year. [1895] IN SUMMER It's growing evening in my soul, It darkens in. At the gray window now and then I hear them toll The hour-and-day-long chimes of St. Etienne. Indeed I'd not have lived elsewhere Nor otherwise, Nor as the dreary saying is Been happier, To wear the love of life within my eyes. My heart's desolate meadow ways, All wet and green, Opened for her to wander in A little space. I'd have it even so as it has been. I've lived the days that fly away, I have a tale To tell when age has made me pale And hair of gray Excuse the fancy shaking out her sail. No one shall know what I intend. Even as I feel The aching voices make appeal And swell and blend, It seems to me I might stoop down to kneel In memory of that day in June When, all the land Lying out in lazy summer fanned Now and anon By dying breezes from the Channel strand, With nothing in our lives behind, Nothing before, In sunlight rich as melting ore And wide as wind We clomb the donjon tower of old Gisors Thro' the portcullis botched in wood And up, in fear, A laddered darkness of a stair, Up to the good Sun-stricken prospect and the dazzling air.— Even now I shade my breaking eyes.— And by her side Surely she saw my heart divide Like paradise For her to walk abroad in at noon-tide. It swims about my memory. I feel around The country steeped in summer swound; I feel the sigh That all these years within her breast was bound. Her fingers in my hand are laid. I seem to gaze Into the colours of her face, And there is made A quiver in my knees like meadow-grass'. That time I lived the life I have: A certain flower Blooms in a hundred years one hour, And what it gave Is richer, no, nor more, but all its power. The chimes have ended for to-day. After midnight Solitude blows her candle out; Dreams go away, And memory falls from the mast of thought. IN AMPEZZO Only once more and not again—the larches Shake to the wind their echo, “Not again,”— We see, below the sky that over-arches Heavy and blue, the plain Between Tofana lying and Cristallo In meadowy earths above the ringing stream: Whence interchangeably desire may follow, Hesitant as in dream, At sunset, south, by lilac promontories Under green skies to Italy, or forth By calms of morning beyond Lavinores Tyrolward and to north: As now, this last of latter days, when over The brownish field by peasants are undone Some widths of grass, some plots of mountain clover Under the autumn sun, With honey-warm perfume that risen lingers In mazes of low heat, or takes the air, Passing delicious as a woman's fingers Passing amid the hair; When scythes are swishing and the mower's muscle Spans a repeated crescent to and fro, Or in dry stalks of corn the sickles rustle, Tangle, detach and go, Far thro' the wide blue day and greening meadow Whose blots of amber beaded are with sheaves, Whereover pallidly a cloud-shadow Deadens the earth and leaves: Whilst high around and near, their heads of iron Sunken in sky whose azure overlights Ravine and edges, stand the gray and maron Desolate Dolomites,— And older than decay from the small summit Unfolds a stream of pebbly wreckage down Under the suns of midday, like some comet Struck into gravel stone. Faintly across this gold and amethystine September, images of summer fade; And gentle dreams now freshen on the pristine Viols, awhile unplayed, Of many a place where lovingly we wander, More dearly held that quickly we forsake,— A pine by sullen coasts, an oleander Reddening on the lake. And there, each year with more familiar motion, From many a bird and windy forestries, Or along shaking fringes of the ocean, Vapours of music rise. From many easts the morning gives her splendour; The shadows fill with colours we forget; Remembered tints at evening grow tender, Tarnished with violet. Let us away! soon sheets of winter metal On this discoloured mountain-land will close, While elsewhere Spring-time weaves a crimson petal, Builds and perfumes a rose. Away! for here the mountain sinks in gravel. Let us forget the unhappy site with change, And go, if only happiness be travel After the new and strange:— Unless 't were better to be very single, To follow some diviner monotone, And in all beauties, where ourselves commingle, Love but a love, but one, Across this shadowy minute of our living, What time our hearts so magically sing, To meditate our fever, simply giving All in a little thing? Just as here, past yon dumb and melancholy Sameness of ruin, while the mountains ail, Summer and sunset-coloured autumn slowly Dissipate down the vale; And all these lines along the sky that measure Sorapis and the rocks of Mezzodì Crumble by foamy miles into the azure Mediterranean sea: Whereas to-day at sunrise, under brambles, A league above the moss and dying pines I picked this little—in my hand that trembles— Parcel of columbines. [1898] MNEMOSYNE It's autumn in the country I remember. How warm a wind blew here about the ways! And shadows on the hillside lay to slumber During the long sun-sweetened summer-days. It's cold abroad the country I remember. The swallows veering skimmed the golden grain At midday with a wing aslant and limber; And yellow cattle browsed upon the plain. It's empty down the country I remember. I had a sister lovely in my sight: Her hair was dark, her eyes were very sombre; We sang together in the woods at night. It's lonely in the country I remember. The babble of our children fills my ears, And on our hearth I stare the perished ember To flames that show all starry thro' my tears. It's dark about the country I remember. There are the mountains where I lived. The path Is slushed with cattle-tracks and fallen timber, The stumps are twisted by the tempests' wrath. But that I knew these places are my own, I'd ask how came such wretchedness to cumber The earth, and I to people it alone. It rains across the country I remember. LODOVICO MARTELLI O Gaddi, ope the casement, open wide And prop my pillow. But the window square Of light, of sky! tho' skies of Sicily Are not Firenze's. Ah, Firenze mine! Darkly I feel how's wasting all my life And dulls my brain; Death 's guessing at my name. But utter strange it is to die. The word “Life” to my ear rings mournful-rich and stings The sleepy nerve of longing. This is pain— To stifle far from home, the heart suppressed By a handful of such years as other men Make nought of. Mercy of God, what mother e'er Fashioned a heart so brittle, a head and brain Whereof the tissues crack with fever? Why Live? to have tasted life?—and die of 't! aye, 'T was little more. The silly, silly tears. But Gaddi, look, my head, my arm! Indeed Think you that I revive? Meseemeth now The Spring should soften Fiesole to flower And Colli meadows show to every wind New petals of anemony. How often By the divine immemorable days, By sober afterlight when marvel is And all Firenze turns a smouldering gold— How oft upon the hillside have we heard The melancholy ritornello! Ah What Springs were they! Tell me if ever, since, The night was moonful, or a woman's eye Tearfully asked a softer question? How waved the paling heaven's embroidery, What wonder woke the odoured bloom of earth, What music had the tongue of Tuscany, What rhymes! How large a burial is the Past! And thence away to Rome, to sovran Rome. What were the sickly earth without its Rome, Its gorgeous city where the revels are, Dice and cards and the old ecstatic wine That glints dark ruby, and superbly eyed The rich and unimpassioned courtesans, And Leo, Pope— Yes, listen. One great once I saw the heavenly Householder, but far From 's home. Come nearer, Gaddi, hist! Ye know The Morosina who has Italia's hair, Whose eye is somewhat strangely more than blue, Who laughs like beech-leaves ringing in the light; Her kisses indolent as a warm rain. ... I dream. The Pope said I? 'T was winter night. The wind fell edged and pointed down the lane Beneath the casement many have looked to, where Stood I, whistling a feverish tune. And straight 'T was oped. I entered. All about mine ear I heard “My Lodovico,”—such a sound Became the long and melancholy name! I drew my mask, and darkly there I saw— Nothing, but felt and breathèd veriest Heaven. About our kiss did move her tender hair. Her breast to mine, her living arms, her brow— The memory aches me that it is so dead. She led me with a touch like melody That being fore'er more forward in the air Still guides. The cold and archèd corridor We traversed, I a dreamer sunsetwards And she the moving beauty of the day. We climbed the stair, a sick moon-gazer I Beneath her white and spirit-wingèd moon: Till in her chamber with our eyes we lit The owlish gloom about her tapestry. Upon his horse the hunter moved asleep And every falcon turnèd owl. Alone The cresset flickered on the fragrant oil, Shedding an old small light. And she and I We sung the night with kisses low adream. She said the wonder things in olden words; She made a music languorous as Time And rich as Summer, whilst her endless hair Seemed Aphrodite's o'er the shallow wave Thin-spread at midday. Odour never rose Sweet as her breasts', and musically she Did often turn her golden head away That gazing I might weave and weave my soul Into a necklace stringed of sleepy pearl Without a clasp.— But then befell the thing. Methought I heard, I heard indeed a door Noising—and near. I threw'r aside. “By Christ, A snare! now bless me—where 's my sword? my mask?” “I love thy soul,” she sang. “Is 't Bembo?” “No.” “The whorish trade!” Her shaking hand she put In mine. The step grew living near. I drew. Then most superbly on the threshold poised An all-black cavalier, save in the mask Two fires. “By Venus,” quoth, “a lady 's here That loves too widely to love well. Good sir, Suppose—” “A sword 's enough for courtesy.” He drew a wonder of Toledo blade That rang like music. Masterly we fenced And plied our gallant art Italian, Till on a sudden her most delirious form Rushed with a cry betwixt us. But she fell Half-sensed. We moved. Then with an elfish pass I pierced his hand. The weapon fell to ground,— And he was flying,—but next about his waist Her tender arms imploring pardon clung. He struggled, stumbled, fell; the mask removed; By Jesu God in Heaven, verily I Then saw great Leo's face, the Pope's of Rome. I shuddered as a reed, my brain rocked, all Withered together crumbling in my soul: I fled, yet with a backward look to see The mistress of the gods make of her hair, Her golden hair, a Pontiff's chasuble.— Dost thou believe I'm dying of darkish things, Of poison—? Ah, my heart 's a crust of ash. And glowing chains are piled about my head. Raving? Not I. Give me no drugs. The world I charioted have left in dust behind. For I was Poet.—They said, they said “A soft Poet, who stole Petrarca's melodies And spoiled his robbery.” Soft in verse I was, A master had I like, forsooth, the rest. ... But nothing timeless said! Full well I know't, The shaft is on my heart's bow, poised, unloosed! While Raphael delves a ceiling into skies Peopling his coloured thought, and Agnolo Makes the fresh-quarried adamant to sweat Ferocious agony, or in peace reclined To look long looks abroad the shifting world. I? why, I'd sing for them, I Lodovico Martelli. I would send my songs full-sailed Over the waves and waters of the years. Let them be painter, sculptor: poet, I. For your unquiet thoughts, the horrid strong, I have them,—writ? not yet! but here 's my heart, Feel it! so tramped the innumerable host When Rome was burned. And very vast a tale Were half its history. Often have I stood On hills high up, by sorry coasts, alone Passing my vision angrily. I thought To have plucked the yellow comets by their hair, To have braided meteors, and from 'hind the moon Robbed her society of chanting tides. I'd stand, my back to the seaward cliffs, at bay And fight the wave. Completed earth 's a leaf Turning in space along with the other dust That blinds the eye of God. Away, away! Canst see the waters from the window? Help, Help, sir. I've clomb Vesuvius of old, Tasting its breath—'t was half so steep. Behold, Yon rolls in wide and worldly rhythm the sea, Greatest and eldest poet. Yonder chants The epic wave in rich monotony. Mine eye seems big as heaven. And far abroad From Even's distaff floats the purple wool. Wet-eyed she sits; the light for love of her Becomes a moon but to behold her die— The moon—Firenze! Is Firenze near? Methinks 't were half a journey. Ah, but were we there! How fresh her lip is graven on my heart. I see her, palely. But—tell me, who knows— Is she not waxen, like me, somewhat old? For something long has happened. All 's ago. I was ages ago, and in the world We were together young. Say, am I dead That I'm so far? Perhaps shall I return. Bid Laura wait for April; I return, I that so endless loved her, love her. Say: “Within the colour-cupped anemonies Lieth his heart, and all the leaves are he. The gentle ecstasy of earth, the wind That lifts so happily thy hair is he, And he the Spring that holds thee all about.” O Gaddi, I shall not return. My mood Is his who sits upon a farther shore, Waiting and sick. It's night and strangely cold. To bed! 't is bitter cold. My very breast Quivers. Hold me, good Gaddi,—or I shake To death. My body 's dry. Christ, what a world! Water, good soul, water! Hold thou the cup. [1898] DOLOROSA Thou hadst thy will. How weary sounds the rain! The firelight wanders in the window-pane. Thou art still. Let me a space, Now that the daylight dies, Lie back against thee and with upward eyes Love thy face. Forgive my fear, But—darling—hold me fast! A little while the heartache will be past. Patience, dear. Give me thy hands And bending closely o'er Lay thy two lips to mine for evermore. Death commands. PITY An old light smoulders in her eye. There! she looks up. They grow and glow Like mad laughs of a rhapsody That flickers out in woe. An old charm slips into her sighs, An old grace sings about her hand. She bends: it 's musically wise. I cannot understand. Her voice is strident; but a spell Of fluted whisper silkens in— The lost heart in a moss-grown bell, Faded—but sweet—but thin. She bows like waves—waves near the shore. Her hair is in a vulgar knot— Lovely, dark hair, whose curves deplore Something she 's well forgot. She must have known the sun, the moon, On heaven's warm throat star-jewels strung— It 's late. The gas-lights flicker on. Young, only in years, but young! One might remind her, say the street Is dark and vile now day is done. But would she care, she fear to meet— But there she goes—is gone. SONG A bud has burst on the upper bough (The linnet sang in my heart to-day); I know where the pale green grasses show By a tiny runnel, off the way, And the earth is wet. (A cuckoo said in my brain: “Not yet.”) I nabbed the fly in a briar rose (The linnet to-day in my heart did sing); Last night, my head tucked under my wing, I dreamed of a green moon-moth that glows Thro' ferns of June. (A cuckoo said in my brain: “So soon?”) Good-bye, for the pretty leaves are down (The linnet sang in my heart to-day); The last gold bit of upland 's mown, And most of summer has blown away Thro' the garden gate. (A cuckoo said in my brain: “Too late.”) RALSTON To thee, that all this wretchedness be ended And I become in my disaster free, I bring my broken life to be amended. Take me, O sea, O sea of California, thou Pacific, For which the multitude of mortals bound Go trembling headlong down and with terrific Outcry are drowned. Take me out of the earth that I remain not To tell to gossips in a hovel tales Of what I was. I who have squandered cannot Play with the scales. I who with power and riches stood surrounded And gave as princes, and without a throne Was King the greater that for name I sounded Only my own: I must have gone away, not die nor wither But vanish like a rolling sound of brass, A comet burst which—without whence or whither Or wherefore—was. For men born out of yesterday are yestern, For men to-day are of to-day. And we, We need only ourselves, we men of Western Democracy. By my own sinews and own brain, unweakened By lineage and generations, I Did what I did, and with the wide world reckoned To live and die. I gave and had no memory of measure. Others can tell who rollicked at my feast; And in my palace there was greater pleasure Than in the East. I did enjoy and drank the beaker frothing; I have kindled the splendours every one. Tho' my magnificence to-day be nothing, I say, I won,— I won. And fortune cast me her dismissal! Of traps and treasures whereof I could say 'T is mine! there 's not so much as rubbish. This all Was yesterday. Squalid and sad where I before did conquer, Doubtless again I could have victory, Again lie in the golden gates at anchor— Receive me, sea! There sinks the sun in dusts of sulphur glowing Gibbous and red; and flaking toward the shore Like hosts of scarlet willow-leaves bestrewing The sapphire floor. And from the country evening scarce arisen Out of the flowering oranges the breeze,— The breeze will carry me to the horizon, To silences Of sky and wave, the dark, the swirling eddy, The sinking down out of the vital air, And down out of myself, down from the giddy Glories that were. DRIFTWOOD I Heaven is lovelier than the stars, The sea is fairer than the shore; I've seen beyond the sunset bars A colour more. A thought is floating round my mind, And there are words that will not come. Do you believe, as I, the wind Somewhere goes home? II In grassy paths my spirit walks. The earth I travel speaks me fair And still thro' many voices talks Of that deep oneness which we are. I love to see the rolling sod Mixing and changing ever grow To other forms,—and this is God And all of God and all we know. I love to feel the dead dust whirled About my face, to touch the dust; And this large muteness of the world Gives me vitality of trust. Here on the earth I lie a space, The quiet earth that knows no strife. I mix with her and take my place In the dark matter that is life. [1895] III I saw the moon and heard her sing, I saw her sing and heard the moon. For light and song went wing and wing. So many a ship and many a star Abroad the sky and sea are two. We know it not for being far. So two fair flowers make a whole In corner meadows of the spring. It takes two hearts to make a soul; And down the cloudy days they fare Married in Beauty, as of old The lovers thro' the infernal air. IV Between the sun and moon A voice now vague now clear— Do you hear?— Says “Wander on.” And on the hearthstone black The embers poignantly— Do you see?— Spell “Come back.” REQUIESCAM Come to the window! You're the painter used To shadow-in pools of light far out to sea, Or fix it where the solitary wave Rears with a shimmering scoop before the shore,— A glorious wave! But now look out awhile And love my view, from our suburban height The squalid champaign zigzagged by the Seine. I'm old, most of my labour done. My chisel One of these days among the pellets of dry clay Will lie and rust. I have immensely worked, And hitherto seen nothing but the Form Staring upon my eyeballs. Years and years, Whether alone along the shining streets O' the city or in companionship, I've looked So long and seen away so fixedly That space scrolled up, I seeing none the less: Except some shape, some woman lightning-blenched, Pinned to the ground, lay dreadful in my road. O Labour, everlasting vanity, That fills her cracking pitcher and falls down Face to the earth, the water in her hair! Into a bole of clay all my life long I've stared my visions in, and, thumbing, seen Materialize obscurely to a line The long desire of Nature turning home. So strains itself out of the sea a shape With loads of weedy tide up to the land, Straining to touch and taste, to lose and die, Straining fore'er miserably unsatisfied. Between the toad and lyre-bird, 'twixt the snail And greyhound all is struggle: the which is vain. For by our bases we 're firm sunken-down In the element: and whenever a little while Yearning Illusion flutters up the sky, She presently swings to the gasping pitch, To fall bolt-like. I say, all my life long close to I've stared Into the clay, have with my chisel rasped The marble off and stroked the lovely limbs, The breasts of women and the lips of boys In stone. Again, into the mould I've poured The wretched desolation of my dreams And bruisèd here and there the bronze. All this I have done my life long, and not so much As lifted up my eyes. But now at last I pleasurably look to either side. For I would paint some landscapes ere I die, One or two landscapes of the view you see, The squalid plain meandered by the Seine. There, when there 's moon, thro' fumes of gray and black The silver river curls away; beyond It's night and vapid darkness infinite. And sitting at this window, I suppose A pallet on my thumb, and brushes and The colours gently mixing with their oil:— Leaving my marbles in imagination For final solace in a softer art. You, painter, have enjoyed with all your self; You 've little looked into the dark. But I Forged in the night. It's resting-time, I'm old. Landscape will ease me somewhat toward the end. [1900] ERIDE Dull words that swim upon the page Thro' filmy tears of joy and pain! Poor silly words, my only gage! Mere words, recurrent as refrain! Ye prove me language less than nought And all the loss of utterance. Ye give me scraps of withered thought And sounds that meet as by a chance. If I should find ye once again, If you should come again to me, Dull words about my joy and pain, Mere words, what would ye signify? I Love, I marvel what you are! Heaven in a pearl of dew, Lilies hearted with a star— All are you. Spring along your forehead shines And the summer blooms your breast. Graces of autumnal vines Round you rest. Birds about a limpid rose Making song and light of wing While the warm wind sunny blows,— So you sing. Darling, if the little dust, That I know is merely I, Have availed to win your trust, Let me die. Brown eyes I say, yet say I blue. I think her mouth is a melody, Her bosom a petal sunned and new; Her hand is a passing sigh. Blue eyes I say, yet somehow brown. Her mouth is the verge of all repose; Her breast a smoothed-out viol tone; Her hand is an early rose. Be her eyes of blue or brown indeed, Be colour or music what she is, I nothing know. But my life's own need Is the fancy of her kiss. Clouds thro' the heaven flit Aprilward. There 's the bud of a violet On the sward. Branch and breeze sympathize Ere they play,— I know that it 's Spring to-day By your eyes. How shall I hold you fast Now you are here? A tremor, and you have passed. And this year Only of all is ours Only is mine!— I see in your blue eyes shine All the year's flowers. Hereafter I'll call you Spring, Little girl! And christen each clustering Delicate curl Some lovely meadow's name In the South, Where they say that music and youth Stay the same. I held these tulips first, before Bringing you them. I passed the love I bear you o'er Flower and stem. And I would leave them at your door,— If at your heart's door they might stand! Keeping awhile The world behind their petals and Crimson smile,— Like seas hid by a meadow-land. A trill of leaves is in the wold; I feel the wings of summer pass, And sunlight in big drops of gold Falls on the seedy feathered grass. Some tiny cuckoo never seen Blows his own echo mild as mist. A deer there, stirring in the green! A squirrel, where the branches kissed. Far through, a sweep of aspen-boughs And birches whitening tow'rd the crest Reclines, like river-grass, and flows Along the summer to the West, Farther away, till last of all In milky hazes lying furled Is—nothing more. 'T is we recall Infinity back to the world. In the bow-window that looks out Over the sunset-coloured bay We sat one evening, wondering and in doubt. The water plashing on the quay Roused the warm air, and half-awake One hill we knew was changing golden-gray. We strained our sight upon the lake; We dared not anything to say, For fear your heart and mine might haply break. Our tired eyes soon filled with tears, And we said nothing. But your hand Was like a heart that understands and hears. [1896] We missed the sunset, love, to-night— The sunset on the sea that sings, Folding about its heart of light The large and melancholy wings. A snowy gull may've moved along The rose and gray and violet bands, Serene as thought and pure as song, Beyond our line of open sands; A moonbeam on the fisher net, A sail that lay upon the sea, A rim of pebbles darkly wet: It all was not for you and me. A sunset lost, a life foregone! Beauty that asked our heart and died! What said we? did we match the Sun With aught of Heart, my love?—My bride, One look you gave was twice a sky. I kissed your hand, you said a word That greater is for melody Than all the tides a coast-land heard. One sunset lost, one look the more!— The night is quieting the foam. Hear you? “Come,” says the endless shore, And all the waves in murmur, “Come.” He rests upon her knee his tired head; His eye, long worried, sleeps; And she, whose perfect love has nothing said, Her hand upon his forehead keeps. Thro' darkening windows blows the ancient spring; A planet trembles, kind. Her large wet eyes are vastly wondering, Her happy love resembles wind. The breeze about her finger stirs his hair, And her breath rises, falls. So their unfolding presence thro' the air In soft and low surprises calls. He touches her in dream and follows her, For nearness of her fails. And the spring night of green and gossamer Around beloved and lover pales. II I hear you singing in my breast, I hear you chanting in my mind. Is it the wind? I feel your form upon my eyes, I feel your fingers press my sight. Is it the night? I hear the little noise of feet And footsteps come and come again. Is it the rain? And all alone with memory My brain grows anxious for the day. You 're long away. “Will you look down once more, just once? Down to the ground and keep your veil Drawn o'er your half-guessed countenance And smile—so frail? “Thank you! For I have had a friend Whose image came most vividly Upon my soul, when with that bend You looked from me. “Gone? Yes! you cannot think how far, Beyond the uttermost of thought. She 's grown, as far things do, a star In heaven's hand caught. “But stars, you know, are very cold And always white. They never bless Just you, and in the night's great fold Grow vague and less. “And so it's sweet to feel sometimes A colour, gesture, sound—a turn That makes the heart grow dull with rhymes And the soul's lips burn. “Yes! sometimes fast about my heart Something troubles me that I knew; I find a stranger made me start, As now did you. “So pray don't think me rude. That face— For the mere memory I would die. You 've warmed my life with your—her grace. Good-night, good-bye.” [1896] If you should lightly, as I 've known you, come And find me of an evening crying here At open windows of a changing home, While beyond garden, houses, tree, and dome Fades out the day and year; If you should gently touch my shoulder, and Turning I'd see as with a sweet surprise You there, above me and about me, stand, While the warm sunset passed a lucid hand Over your face and eyes; If then you softly, as I 've heard you, said That all was well, I know not what or why, But just for words' sake told me; while your head Moved round, you passed away; and in your stead An autumn night came by: Still would the happiness of having stood With one so nearly you tho' gone so soon, Bring to my solitude a little good,— As one who 's gladdened in a midnight wood For having seen the moon. Sometimes you seem so far away, The very noise of thinking lulls, And, on my vision, colour dulls To vapour with sick wings of gray. I wander out of Time and Mind. The sense of my own life is lost. One thought goes touching like a ghost That found yet knows not where to find. And all I know is just the jar Of chime that trembles in my ear; And all I ask is if the year Is never tired as others are. You charm a window in the South, Your brow seen by the golden star; And through warm dreams the gentle war Of thought lures laughter to your mouth. The wind lulls in the olive grove And all becomes a vaporous sigh— Low preludes to your ecstasy Who love too much to think of love.— October is in midnight swound With just a vague gray blot for moon, And like a scum the rotting brown Of dead leaves drifts along the ground; While I sit waiting for a time I know not how, and marvel forth Upon the vastness of the North, Till marvel mellows into rhyme. I heard a dead leaf run. It crossed My way. For dark I could not see. It rattled crisp and thin with frost Out to the lea. My steps I hast'ned, I was lost For all the grief that came to me. For now and ever thro' the host Of sounds that blow from shrub and tree,— A little echo sharply tossed,— The footsteps chills me of her ghost; And knowing naught I weep most drearily. III There 's just a bit of twilight yet, A glossy gray that floats the sea From yonder, where the daylight set, To me. All else is violet growing dark. Southward, a sorrow breaks the sky. The tide in languor of its mark Is high. And old night thickens on the strand. There is no motion but the wave's, Along the leagues of listening sand That raves. And nothing now. The lighthouse lit. If ships there be, they 're far from coast. All 's safe. But something infinite Is lost. One spot where every day declines In a last red ray From the circle poised on a hill of pines; One knoll, where an elm's twist-branches play With the air, elate; And below, our bench of a battered gray: In summer, 't was bright—when the sun sets late, Too late for regret! And the winds lie down somewhere to wait While daylight goes and gray streaks fret The heaven's blues And round the mid-sky night's arms are met. But we went to-day and the long sinews Of our elm were lame With wind that ran in the day's lost clues. Early the sun set, vague and tame. Thro' gathering mists The rain fell chiding us why we came. A drizzle fills the autumn day. The sun will never here come back, And weeds and foliage in decay Lie draggled in the cart-wheel's track. From blackened woods along the plain A vapour passes out, a sound Of boughs grown weak thro' nights of rain, That sink and shatter on the ground. The meadow turf is all a swamp, There 's nothing left of summer. Come. The air turns dark and deadly damp. Come, for it 's very far to home. The year for you and me Is nearly done. The leaves there, two or three, Are brown. Not a bird sings. It is time to think of other things. Your secret was my hope, Your deeper name; And you perhaps did ope The same.— Only the word For being spoke yet was not heard. And as a leaf that knows It cannot meet Another leaf that grows So sweet, Hearing it call, Springs in the autumn wind, to fall: So did I hoping doubt, Till thro' the dark Falling away, went out The spark,— Ever to be A star gone down below the sea. Not that, if you had known at all, You would have done what now you do. God knows, no blame shall ever fall Of mine on you. I only marvel that it all be true. They say that love 's a mustard seed Upon the acres of the heart; It spreads from one part like a weed To another part. Yet Spring is single and the days depart. I know not why, but so it is! That pain is such a simple thing. Here to your hand I bring my kiss, And yet nothing Can tell you nearly what it is I bring. And why?—It 's hard to cipher Fates And Distances, as yours from me. Not science even separates So fixedly;— And then we tantalize our destiny! Yes, marvel how the chances cross And weave these spider-webs of wire. Men live who say there's gain in loss! And yet Desire Revives like ferns on a November fire. It comes to only a memory. We have too many memories, And somehow I believe we die Of things like these, Loving what was not, might not be, nor is. [1896] Like a pearl dropped in red dark wine, Your pale face sank within my heart, Not to be mine, yet always mine. Your eyes, like flowers from apart Their frail and shaded gates of dream, Looked all a meadow's light astart With sunrise, and your smile did seem As when below a letting rain The water-drops with sunset gleam. I thought my vision was not vain; I felt my cramped heart stir and move Which now is pressed with little pain. I dreamed the dream one wonders of,— Your face of pearl, so pale and wise. I saw, and murmured “Life is Love.” The dust of folly filled my eyes. I sang, and opened in your name Crocuses yellow with moonrise. I played with shadows at their game; The meadow thought my song was wind. I called the sunrise up: it came. Sweet sun-warmed grasses did I bind In fancies of your hair. My song Was you, and you were all my mind.— The charm, the splendour, and the wrong Will drive you thro' the earth, to try Of you and pleasure which is strong,— While I remember. Cry on cry My autumn 's gone. A horrid blast Blows out my sunset from the sky. Nothing is left and all is past; Rain settles like a quiet air. And as a pearl in red wine cast Glows like a drop of moonlight there, Your face possesses my despair. Receive my love; I ask no more. Receive, I have no more to give. The heart and spirit of me bore All of this little gift. Receive! I fancied as in dream I passed My arms afraid with care and strove About you, to have gleaned at last Some late and stilly wished-for love,— No more the wild wide flames that leap Out of a moment down our years, To smoulder in endangering sleep, To glitter under tender tears,— But something dear and gradual Within your slowly opening soul: Your nearly love, your nearly all Which comes with years to be the very whole. You would give otherwise and more, Give much more and forget you gave,— As over-seas in summer pour The wide blue swinging breadths of wave. Yes, and your vision of desire Is richer than the sunrise and Profounder than the sea and higher Than the last light these heavens command. You suffer thirst, and waiting brood Impatiently one day to strain From out this life of mood and food The stuffs of ecstasy and pain:— Till squandering in royal waste The passion of your youth upon Some pitiable heart, you taste The wines and fever of oblivion! I know.—Your dream is mine, that was. And quickly far within your eyes All of my life began to pass And wander out in seas and skies. But you, whom all my life adored, While I go following in your way, Can not so much as speak the word;— For there be lies no tongue can say. How strange it is, the point we lack Just to possess the spirit's own, And failing this, to tremble back Among unfinished things alone! Pass by, dear heart,—and take from me This charm for which a diver dove Of old down the unruined sea,— And taking mine, give to another thy love. IV No, no, 't is very much too late. I thought it mockery that you said You loved me; but a certain fate Lowers your voice and bows your head. I tell you, you desire to wake the dead. 'T is pitiful so to drag out The sorry quarrel in our souls, Till even the blood suspends in doubt And each full impulse backward rolls. Meantime the hour regardless passing tolls. Yes! think how year on year is gone. You went your way and hummed your dreams Of passion and oblivion In lands where terrible sunbeams Shiver upon the leaping arch of streams. Your heart was violent and you stretched Tiptoe after the stars your hand!— 'T was but a willow-bough you fetched. The argosies of your command Returned, saying beyond there was no land. You cursed the woman's life for lame. To do! you cried, and labouring Like men bring in the distant aim!— What was this aim you needs must bring, Your one, your altogether desired thing? You knew not, doubting day by day. Like yours how many lives are lived! How seldom all is given away, How little of every gift received! How the heart most of all is least believed! When at your going my grief was new And the long future all to waste, I said farewell to more than you: I wandered up into the Past And wandering have imagined peace at last. Still, perhaps, under leaves that lie You'd feel the roots of sorrow end Here in my bosom dyingly: Mere threads they are, too frail to tend! I've done with my own living, O my friend! For what were gained if I were yours? Fever and frenzy of the blood, The pleasure which no surfeit cures, Endless desire, hunger, feud— And, at the end of passion, solitude.— You know how, born by a small hearth, While out in the sad dark it snows And 't is for months an unseen earth, The soul as by remembrance goes After the warm vineyard and burning rose, To live long years by stream and hill Within the southern light, with men Who speak delicious language:—till The pain of being alien Urges one elsewhere yet not home again. So are our lives. I love you more. But other hearts by destiny Must needs possess what they adore And have it, to live with and to die, To strangle or soothe with kisses. Not so I. By silences within a dream And bird-songs of a spring sunrise, To the onward measure of a stream Nearer the sea where quiet is, I love you more, much more, but otherwise. If I have wronged you in the days Bygone but unforgotten now, I make no pleading for your grace. My tongue is bitter. Leave me, go. You have no pity, none. You live Impatient and unreconciled. Nay, were you a mother, I believe You never could well love your child. You 've cracked the sense of life and death With passions in you that despise The thing you love and choke its breath, Till unrecriminate it dies,— It dies to you; and nothing then, Nor art nor hope nor force nor spell Can worry back the lost again,— Lost, lost, and irrecoverable. And then, God knows, some things there be Where never pardon yet was known: What words have leapt from you to me! Enough, henceforward I'm my own. Yes, men are selfish—Tell me, you Who pluck my thoughts for flying fast, Ask all the years to be, and rue The unalterably separate past, What is this that is generous? Can just a word we used to know In childhood, commonly, to us Have grown a vulgar riddle so? Sometimes I think we never met, Such immense walls of iron and ice Between us infinitely set Spring blind into the spirit's skies. Sometimes I think we never met,— 'T had surely better been, to spare This nervous wringing of regret, This hope that tightens to despair. We have not understood, for all We deeply lived and clearly said. And without knowledge love must fall,— Like this of ours, that lying dead Clamours for burial. It is time, It was time in much earlier days, Before we soiled our lips with crime, That you and I went our two ways. V Now in the palace gardens warm with age, On lawn and flower-bed this afternoon The thin November-coloured foliage Just as last year unfastens lilting down, And round the terrace in gray attitude The very statues are becoming sere With long presentiment of solitude. Most of the life that I have lived is here, Here by the path and autumn's earthy grass And chestnuts standing down the breadths of sky: Indeed I know not how it came to pass, The life I lived here so unhappily. Yet blessing over all! I do not care What wormwood I have ate to cups of gall; I care not what despairs are buried there Under the ground, no, I care not at all. Nay, if the heart have beaten, let it break! I have not loved and lived but only this Betwixt my birth and grave. Dear Spirit, take The gratitude that pains, so deep it is. When Spring shall be again, and at your door You stand to feel the mellower evening wind, Remember if you will my heart is pure, Perfectly pure and altogether kind; That not an aftercry of all our strife Troubles the love I give you and the faith: Say to yourself that at the ends of life My arms are open to you, life and death.— How much it aches to linger in these things! I thought the perfect end of love was peace Over the long-forgiven sufferings. But something else, I know not what it is, The words that came so nearly and then not, The vanity, the error of the whole, The strong cross-purpose, oh, I know not what Cries dreadfully in the distracted soul. The evening fills the garden, hardly red; And autumn goes away, like one alone. Would I were with the leaves that thread by thread Soften to soil, I would that I were one. SONNETS [You say, Columbus with his argosies] You say, Columbus with his argosies Who rash and greedy took the screaming main And vanished out before the hurricane Into the sunset after merchandise, Then under western palms with simple eyes Trafficked and robbed and triumphed home again: You say this is the glory of the brain And human life no other use than this? I then do answering say to you: The line Of wizards and of saviours, keeping trust In that which made them pensive and divine, Passes before us like a cloud of dust. What were they? Actors, ill and mad with wine, And all their language babble and disgust. [They say that Cleopatra who of yore] They say that Cleopatra who of yore Received the moon on her dishevelled hair, Looking into his eyes, and breathed the fair Low wind along Mediterranean's shore When Summer swelled the stars,—Now at her door The wanderer sees her like a jewel flare, And drawn by passion thro' the beating air To her, he falls, her dagger at the core. Through rifts of scudding shadow, while his trance Blackens in death, he feels about him lean Her olive breasts and arms, and in her glance Great wings of fire and midnight closing in: His wasting arms do make a vain advance. So I unto the life I would have been. [1898] [They lived enamoured of the lovely moon] They lived enamoured of the lovely moon, The dawn and twilight on their gentle lake. Then Passion marvellously born did shake Their breasts and drave them into the mid-noon. Their lives did shrink to one desire, and soon They rose fire-eyed to follow in the wake Of one eternal thought,—when sudden brake Their hearts. They died, in miserable swoon. Of all their agony not a sound was heard. The glory of the Earth is more than they. She asks her lovely image of the day: A flower grows, a million boughs are green, And over moving ocean-waves the bird Chases his shadow and is no more seen [1898] ON RODIN'S “L'ILLUSION, SŒUR D'ICARE” She started up from where the lizard lies Among the grasses' dewy hair, and flew Thro' leagues of lower air until the blue Was thin and pale and fair as Echo is. Crying she made her upward flight. Her cries Were naught, and naught made answer to her view. The air lay in the light and slowly grew A marvel of white void in her eyes. She cried: her throat was dead. Deliriously She looked, and lo! the Sun in master mirth Glowed sharp, huge, cruel. Then brake her noble eye. She fell, her white wings rocking down the abyss, A ghost of ecstasy, backward to earth, And shattered all her beauty in a kiss. [1898] [I My friend, who in this March unkind, uncouth] My friend, who in this March unkind, uncouth, Biding the full-blown Summer and the skies That change not, stayest unmoved and true and wise That in thy love thou lovest not me but Truth, What should we fear that Age corrode with ruth Our loves, who love the thing that never dies, Building us archways unto Paradise Of all that greets the soul's all-flowering youth? So is it, that often parted, rarely met, And never blessed with gifts of genial Time Wherein might grow the seed we have but sown, Our hearts remember tho' our minds forget How on from year to year and clime to clime Stretches the love that makes of all but one. [1894] [II Your image walks not in my common way] Your image walks not in my common way. Rarely I conjure up your face, recall Your language, think to hear your footstep fall In my lost home or see your eyes' sweet play. Rather you share the life that sees not day, Immured within the spirit's deep control, Where thro' the tideless quiets of the soul Your kingdom stretches far and far away. For these our joys and griefs are less than we. The deeper truths ask not our daily thought— Their strength is peace, they know that we believe. And whatsoever of sublime there be Reaches and deepens and at last is wrought Into that life we are but do not live. [1894] [III Were you called home and I were left to grief] Were you called home and I were left to grief, I'd not go down disconsolate to the shore And brooding mix my language in the roar Of waves in spasm upon the tortured reef; Nor climb the lonely mountain where the leaf Sings its wide whisper and the ravens soar From shadows of unholy ellebore Loved by the owlets, blind and dull and deaf. I should not loudly mourn and vex the earth With strewings of my ashes; none would find My reft soul's sorrow in the gushing eye. But my dull world would be a world of dearth, Cheerless the sunrise, the sweet sky unkind And life grayer, my heart not asking why. [1894] IN A CHURCHYARD How strange, beneath the blue and happy sky And the reviving greenery of the trees So pale their shadow blows along the breeze, To read on polished graves the little cry Of this delirious immortality! Well was it said for all, for each of these “The poor in heart,” who still in death displease The flowers and wind and youth that passes by. How but for them the children of the earth Here, where the grass is fresh and glittering, Would share with herb and beast the common birth! And when they 'd played away this day of Spring How sweetly would they fold at evening Their petals, hands, and wings at nature's hearth. [When I hereafter shall recover thee] When I hereafter shall recover thee And, on the further margin fugitive Silently bringing up, if aught survive The raging wind and old disastrous sea, I disembark, O darling, verily To hold thee to my heart, to feel alive The tremor of thy lips, thy bosom,—it will drive The dark in shreds out of eternity. Sometimes I ask me why the morning sun Returns, or later, when the day is done, I let the dreams about my pillow strain; But then it sounds across my dying brain Like torrents in the moonlight foaming on Between enormous mountains to the plain. [Tho' inland far with mountains prisoned round] Tho' inland far with mountains prisoned round, Oppressed beneath a space of heavy skies, Yet hear I oft the far-off water-cries And vague vast voices which the winds confound. While as a harp I sing, touched with the sound Most secret to its soul, the visions rise In stately dream, and lifting up my eyes I see the naked mountains beacon-crowned. Far in the heaven the golden moon illumes, The crowded stars toil in the webs of night And the sharp meteors seam the higher glooms. Then shifts my dream: the mellow evening falls; Alone upon the shore in the wet light I stand, and hear the infinite sea that calls. [1894] ON SOME SHELLS FOUND INLAND These are my murmur-laden shells that keep A fresh voice tho' the years be very gray. The wave that washed their lips and tuned their lay Is gone, gone with the faded ocean sweep, The royal tide, gray ebb and sunken neap And purple midday,—gone! To this hot clay Must sing my shells, where yet the primal day, Its roar and rhythm and splendour will not sleep. What hand shall join them to their proper sea If all be gone? Shall they forever feel Glories undone and worlds that cannot be?— 'T were mercy to stamp out this agèd wrong, Dash them to earth and crunch them with the heel And make a dust of their seraphic song. [1895] [Tho' lack of laurels and of wreaths not one] Tho' lack of laurels and of wreaths not one Prove you our lives abortive, shall we yet Vaunt us our single aim, our hearts full set To win the guerdon which is never won. Witness, a purpose never is undone. And tho' fate drain our seas of violet To gather round our lives her wide-hung net, Memories of hopes that are not shall atone. Not wholly starless is the ill-starred life, Not all is night in failure, and the shield Sometimes well grasped, tho' shattered in the strife. And here while all the lowering heaven is ringed With our loud death-shouts echoed, on the field Stands forth our Nikè, proud, tho' broken-winged. [1895] [Live blindly and upon the hour. The Lord] Live blindly and upon the hour. The Lord, Who was the Future, died full long ago. Knowledge which is the Past is folly. Go, Poor child, and be not to thyself abhorred. Around thine earth sun-wingèd winds do blow And planets roll; a meteor draws his sword; The rainbow breaks his seven-coloured chord And the long strips of river-silver flow: Awake! Give thyself to the lovely hours. Drinking their lips, catch thou the dream in flight About their fragile hairs' aërial gold. Thou art divine, thou livest,—as of old Apollo springing naked to the light, And all his island shivered into flowers. [1898] [Be still. The Hanging Gardens were a dream] Be still. The Hanging Gardens were a dream That over Persian roses flew to kiss The curlèd lashes of Semiramis. Troy never was, nor green Skamander stream. Provence and Troubadour are merest lies The glorious hair of Venice was a beam Made within Titian's eye. The sunsets seem, The world is very old and nothing is. Be still. Thou foolish thing, thou canst not wake, Nor thy tears wedge thy soldered lids apart, But patter in the darkness of thy heart. Thy brain is plagued. Thou art a frighted owl Blind with the light of life thou 'ldst not forsake, And Error loves and nourishes thy soul. [1898] ON THE CONCERT When first this canvas felt Giorgione's hand, From out his soul's intensity he drew In lines most acrid yet superbly few A man,—a soul, whose water at command Of pain had stiffened to ice, whom grief had banned, Till music even and harmony's rich dew Fell fruitless. Poised, defiant and calm he threw To the earth that wronged him his life's reprimand. Yet, as he drew, a wind mellow with dole Of past life as of sea-coast pine did rise And warm the rigour of the painter's soul. For his tear-moistened fingers warmed the frore Hard colours of the cheek, and in the eyes Set the large stare of Sorrow's Nevermore. [1895] [The melancholy year is dead with rain] The melancholy year is dead with rain. Drop after drop on every branch pursues. From far away beyond the drizzled flues A twilight saddens to the window pane. And dimly thro' the chambers of the brain, From place to place and gently touching, moves My one and irrecoverable love's Dear and lost shape one other time again. So in the last of autumn for a day Summer or summer's memory returns. So in a mountain desolation burns Some rich belated flower, and with the gray Sick weather, in the world of rotting ferns From out the dreadful stones it dies away. [As a sad man, when evenings grayer grow] As a sad man, when evenings grayer grow, Desires his violin, and call to call Tunes with unhappy heart the interval; Then after prelude, suffering his bow, Along the crying strings his fingers fall To some persuasion born of long ago, While mixed in higher melodies the low Dull song of his life 's heard no more at all: So with thy picture I alone devise, Passing on thy uncoloured face the tone Of memory's autumnal paradise; And all myself for yearning weary lies Fallen to but thy shadow, near upon The void motion of eternities. [1898] [He said: “If in his image I was made] He said: “If in his image I was made, I am his equal and across the land We two should make our journey hand in hand Like brothers dignified and unafraid.” And God that day was walking in the shade. To whom he said: “The world is idly planned, We cross each other, let us understand Thou who thou art, I who I am,” he said. Darkness came down. And all that night was heard Tremendous clamour and the broken roar Of things in turmoil driven down before. Then silence. Morning broke, and sang a bird. He lay upon the earth, his bosom stirred; But God was seen no longer any more. LAKEWARD 'T will soon be sunrise. Down the valley waiting Far over slope and mountain-height the firs Undulate dull and furry under the beating Heaven of autumn stars. To westward yet the summits hang in slumber Like frozen smoke; there, growing wheel on wheel, As 't were an upward wind of rose and amber Goes up the sky of steel; And indistinguishable thro' the valley An endless murmur freshens as of bees,— The stream that gathering torrents frantically Churns away thro' the trees.— Mountains, farewell! Into your crystal winter To linger on unworlded and alone And feel the glaciers of your bosom enter One and another my own, And on the snow that falling edges nearer To lose my very shade,—'t were well, 't were done Had I not in me the soul of a wayfarer! No, let me wander down The road that, as the boulders higher and higher Go narrower each to each and hold the gloom, Follows like me the waters' loud desire Of a sun-sweetened home. And as I pass, methinks once more the Titan From in the bosom of the humid rocks, Where yet his aged eyes grow vague and whiten Weary and wet his locks, Gazes away upon this brightened weather As asking it in reason and in rhyme How long shall mountain iron and ice together Hold against summer-time. Long, surely! long, perhaps! but not for ever. Now here across the buried road and field, Torn from the dizzy flanks up there that quiver, Down to the plain and spilled In sand and wreckage lies the avalanche's Dead mass under the sun, and not a sound!— The morning grows and from the rich pine-branches Shadows make blue the ground. To wander south! Already here the grasses Feather and glint across the sunny air. It's warmer. Up the road a peasant passes Brown-skinned and dark of hair. Some of an autumn glamour on the highway Softens the dust, and yonder I have seen Catching the sunlight something in the byway Else than an evergreen, And weeds along the ditch are parching.—Sudden Once more from either side the ranges draw Near each to each; beneath struggle and madden Down in the foamy flaw The waters, and, a span across, the boulders Stand to the burning heaven upright and cold. Then drawing lengthily along their shoulders Vapours of white and gold Blow from the lowland upward; all the gloaming Quivers with violet; here in the wedge The tunnelled road goes narrow and outcoming Stealthily on the edge Lies free. The outlines have a gentle meaning. Willows and clematis, foliage and grain! And the last mountain falls in terraces to the greening Infinite autumn plain. O further southward, down the brooks and valley, on And past the lazy farms and orchards, on! It smells of hay, and thro' the long Italian Flowerful afternoon. Sodden with sunlight, green and gold, the country Suspends her fruit and stretches ripe and still Between the clumsy fig and silver plane-tree Circled, from hill to hill And down the vale along the running river: The vale, the river and the hills, that take The perfect south and here at last for ever Merge into thee, O Lake!— Sunset-enamoured in the autumnal hours! When large and westering his heavy rays Fall from the vineyards and the garden-flowers Hazily o'er thy face, And colouring thy bosom with a lover's Warm and quick lips and hesitating hand, He murmurs to thee while the twilight hovers Lilac about the strand, Thou, mid the grape-hung terraces low-levelled, Lookest into the green and crimson sky With swimming eyes and auburn hair dishevelled, Radiant in ecstasy.— 'T is evening. In the open blueness stretches A feathery lawn of light from moon to shore, And a boat-load of labourers homeward plashes, Singing “Amor, Amor.” [1900] PROMETHEUS PYRPHOROS [1900] TO E. F. DRAMATIS PERSONÆ PANDORA PROMETHEUS DEUKALION PYRRHA EPIMETHEUS THE VOICES OF ZEUS Scene. The plain of Haimonia. In the centre, a rude stone dwelling, in the door of which stands PROMETHEUS. The voice of PANDORA always as from within. Total obscurity, nothing on the scene being distinguishable. DEUKALION [crawling in]. How dark it is, how dark and miserable! PYRRHA. Is't thou, Deukalion? DEU. Ah, thy voice! It's I. My moment's journey seems a dreadful year. I see nothing—Where? where? is home here? PYR. Yes. Thou soundest surely nearer. How— DEU. At last. O woman, what is this that makes us be, Threading like worms the cavern where before— PYR. Shows there as yet no daylight? DEU. No, nowhere. This dark can never lift, this heavy night Which lies and stagnates infinitely. No, It cannot lift, I know not when it fell; Scarce I remember how seemed the white sunlight, So debile is my memory and the brain Clean hollowed out. PYR. All round me and within It is like pools of cold. But firewood—say, Bring'st thou any? DEU. Aye, but prithee to what end? I crawled abroad the fields there picking up Some herbs to eat, and fuel; but this I know, The tinder holds no longer any spark And fire is vanished irrecoverably. PYR. Nay, try once more. DEU. Try once again forsooth! I care not, for the trial 's vain. Once more! I'll rub the sticks again together. No, They breed no heat. PYR. I'll pile the firestuff—wait— Lest the one spark be lost. DEU. The spark is dead, I say, the light has ended, and henceforth Misery and blackness unendurable Stand in the eyes that saw, the hearth that burned.— I draw no fire. PYR. Where art thou? Flints, here—strike again. DEU. So did I a thousand times and nothing leapt. Alas! PYR. Ah me, how dark it is and cold. PROMETHEUS [aside]. It bursts the heart to see them suffer thus. DEU. Strange, strange how since the fatal evening all This mound of darkness fell. Father Prometheus Then cheated God and offered him in guile Wind-eggs and unsubstantial things: wherefor We people pay the wrath that never ends, Life in the dark and obscure loneliness,— Knowing nor when to sleep nor when to wake, Eating what herbs we gather here, abroad The plain grazed by the kine we cannot find. I hear them in the dark: they toss their heads, Having slept much too long, and wander on And trample, or halting with outstretchèd neck Low stubborn none knows where, far thro' the night. [The cattle low.] Hear them! PANDORA [singing]. As a poplar feels the sun's enfolding kiss, And softly alone on the quiet plain Yields to him all her silver trellises, A ghost of green in the golden rain, And trembles lightly thro' the shining air Nearly unseen and melting in sky Save for a shadow on the grasses there: So over the earth and world am I. The lips of Gods and mortals in a dream Have lain on my lips of a summer night: They fade like images down-stream, But I have remained behind the light. I give the giver more than that he sought, And more than I give am I, much more: As words are to an everlasting thought, So less than the mother the child she bore. PYR. What says she? DEU. A time ago, the God of Gods Zeus came to adore her, and the immortal arms Closing about her gave her travailing. PYR. Did he so? DEU. Aye, like a master so he did. PYR. She knows perchance then something, knows perhaps If we 're thus brutishly to suffer always and Forever gaze upon this frozen void.— Know'st thou our fate, Pandora? Tell me, mother!— She has not heard. DEU. Or sorrow blocks her ears. For ever since God approached her, on the ground, Her silence threaded by dull murmurs, lone She sits up stonelike 'gainst the rude house-wall. On hand and knee some while ago I crawled Up to her, and, saying our heavy troubles, passed Over her cool immobile face my hand; I kissed her eyes, I touched and held her chin: But all that while she said nothing to me, Remaining passive, silent, pitiless, Albeit her eyes were very wide awake. PYR. The pensive cannot sleep. DEU. O misery, Would that I were asleep a long long time, Beyond to-morrow and the summer's end! Nay, sometimes down my dark bewildered brain Stumble fantastic hopes that—like the birds I've found afield dismembered and undone, Like beasts that shut their swimming eyes, and leaves That eddy dizzily down the nervous wind— So we may fail and fall, be swept away From what we are. PYR. I too, Deukalion. Labour at last is shame within the soul. Have I not faithfully day after day Uptorn the crusty earth and smashed the clots, Scattering with thee the everlasting seeds? Have I not homeward carried every day Upon my head pitchers of spring-water And packs of straw for bedding; and arranged This place we live in cleanly and cheeringly? Yes, here have I within thy warm embrace Season on season, long with agony, My brain sunstricken and my body sick With travelling the dreadful acres, borne Daughters and sons and sons and daughters; whom At midnight then, against their crying, alone I rocked in my exhausted arms, I suckled And bending watched, till, as between my brows It hammered thuds of slumber, very late A little thin gray morning thro' the chinks Told the disaster of another day. And I have reared them and pitifully taught them, My hand upon their hair, my broken truths,— So laboured in their welfare! and in pain So scourged their weakness! Woe is me, alas! They never gave me thanks, no, nor so much As looked a little in my hungry eyes. Rather, against the time of strength, rebellious They fret their freedom out, and last of all Abandoning me for another world Go down the sunset, being seen no more. DEU. Yes, over fields we sowed they went away, Trampling our harvest down. And here we lie All hedgèd in with hoar and darkness, old For staring on the sodden vacancy. I would I knew what thing is in my heart To stamp away so hardly! but for it, I'm that much tired and aching-desolate I'd pass away in earth. PRO. [aside]. How horrible Is now become their life! PYR. It wearies me To think of further being, against the time Not yet bygone. For then it needs must be My breasts will shrivel up, my faded flesh Starve on the joints, and all the bloom I was, The rose and perfume of their pleasure, shrink Into a thing of shame. DEU. Beyond recall The labour of our lives now desiccates. Our sweat was poured for nothing; we have bled Wounded with ignorance in such a task As irks one in the very memory of 't. PRO. [coming forward]. Then let us now remember nothing more, But blindly hope in spite of all. And I Who once defied the Gods, again to-day Stand and demand our dignities of them. We will not suffer thus, we will not go Darkly and despicably tumbling down The road of life. For we be something more; Nor quite in vain infinite earth obeys The plough we fashioned. All indeed is ours! We are the crown of nature and her lord. DEU. O hold thy peace, desperate man! The Gods, Thy littleness to show, have now been pleased To take, for matter of their anger, us Who serviceably did our common task. Thou pil'st our suffering up. What is thy heart To bring curse after curse upon thy children, all For idle show in the face of destiny? PRO. 'T is time we stood up as before, and looked, Brushing the meshes from our forehead, forth Upon the sunshine and the rolling corn. DEU. To bring upon this woman and me, upon All generations, vanity and a life Fatal and stupid as the stones. PRO. Enough, Thou art mine enemy! For a little pain Thou givest justice to the dogs. Aside! Hinder my thoughts no more. Alone to-day I shall restore the light. PYR. O father mine, I nothing say who love thee evermore. Give us the light and life, give us the hope, That we may never question but abide Unthinkingly by what is set before. Lay thy two hands upon my brow, and smile Tho' the night hide thy sweetness. Say the word, Give us the promise. We believe thy strength. For see, we suffer and so scarcely endure That nothingness were better far, and ev'n The being unborn a wholly happy thing. PRO. Yes, woman, word and promise hold: I swear't By me and thee who bearest in the world The sweeter burden and the sharper pain. This night is not fore'er nor long, and soon Between the cliffs of darkness issuing shall The day its thousand arrows pour abroad Here where we lived—and shall in other years Live and increase, our children's children, on To generations jealous as the Gods. This will I do, and if they stood in rank, Yet will I storm them, winning back the fire And scattering the hope that cannot die. DEU. What misery will be ours! PYR. Speak to the end. 'T is sweet to dream on what not yet has been. PRO. 'T were sure a shame to grovel at the doors And ask a pittance, when the Lord is I. DEU. Necessity! PRO. We change and pass away, But so in changing have some mastery, we Revolving make progression, we endure In virtue of desire and hope dissatisfied, And, thro' disaster struggling, at the last Fetch in salvation and the human end. This for now! nay, only a little space Of twilight is before, a dubious interval After the night, this side of day, as tho' We stood upon the threshold momently Where morning meets with evening passing by. Therefore in tears no longer dreaming, now Turn, tho' your hearts be broken, turn your eyes Dayward, and quelling all lament with hope Wait for my coming homeward. I declare I will go bring the sunlight in my hands Back from God's citadel and home to us. [He goes away.] PAN. [singing]. Before my eyes they come and go; The shadows on my dreaming face Move to and fro, Yet I look further over larger ways. For pity is not of that nor this, And kindness stretches out her arm On all that is, To keep the grass-blade and the star from harm. She kisses every dying wave Into the sweetness of her trust, And stoops to save The bird that sank from heaven into dust.— The battle hurtles long and loud Between the mountains and the sea; The yellow cloud Crashes the woods in sunder tree by tree, And struggling over land and main The generations masterful With greed and pain Scatter upon the turf a brother's skull: I walk the places where they drove And sing my song where all is cursed. Then, for my love, The child will play again, the flower burst. DEU. What a strange mournful voice is hers! PYR. No, no! I feel a happiness bringing leaves Upon the branches, and the night is less Between now and to-morrow! Oh, to-morrow— DEU. Thine, woman, is a silly heart, and trust Is in thy being like a malady. Father Prometheus, greatest of us all, Avails not with his majestic arrogance To wrench from God the blessing he denies. And we be cursed! I know not wherefore, no, I cannot say what mischief, thine or mine, Merited punishment: but we be cursed Beyond our father's valour to revoke,— And I believe, to pay his awful deed, He will hang out in anguish crucified Upon the giddy ramparts of the world While we mysteriously damned shall hide Here at night's bottom to the last of time. EPIMETHEUS. Deukalion! DEU. Here, father, this way home. EPI. Deukalion! DEU. Here, here! Thou seekest us? What is 't? EPI. I've journeyed hopeless and too long, Nothing before but darkness and behind This endless shadow of my memory. PYR. Poor heart! thou lovest overmuch the past. But happiness is toward, the night will end. DEU. Heed her not, Epimetheus! Thy brother Has spoiled her brain with promises and words. EPI. Where is he? DEU. Come to fetch the fire again, To kindle back the world to what it was. EPI. The fool! He struggles forward evermore, Like one who stumbles; but the sadder thought Never constrains him, that futurity Is dead with phantoms of the things bygone,— DEU. Aye, and alive with sufferings that are. He 's wild and rolls like whirlwind up a steep, Leaving but ruin. EPI. When I consider time, Remembering all my pastimes and the haunts Where clustered flowers erewhile that one by one Shone either side the path of what I was, My bosom fills more than to hold with pain, And yearning, like a swallow in the void, Strains aching, dropping down, down endlessly. PYR. Come nearer that I rest thee in my arms. PAN. [singing]. Many who have only dreamed of me Have grown unhappy and lost their years. They gather the daisies thoughtfully, Then throw them away and burst in tears. Their eyes are filled—for they looked so long— With the sunset-light of my aureole; Their lips will quiver to utter song, And the spring lies swelling under their soul. For their hand in a woman's hand is laid And between a woman's breasts their brow. For a while they feel no longer afraid With the sky above and the earth below: But never the whole and the fulness come. Their eyes are blind with another light. They walk through echoes and have no home, Like shadows waving upon the night. EPI. Pandora's voice. PYR. Obscure and pitiful. DEU. What sawest thou on thy travel? EPI. No daylight. Nor anything on before; but at my back Remembrance made a weary song, chanting The mellow seasons that have gone away. DEU. And bringest nothing? EPI. No. DEU. How profitless, Thou and thy brother, elders tho' ye be, Worry the time out and defeat yourselves. One storms gigantic up the heavens; thou Triest to die with thine own memory. PYR. Leave him, Deukalion, for he is so sad. DEU. Aye, 't is we suffer their temerities, And back and forth, to ends we know not of, Madden between to-morrow and yesterday. PYR. Father, be comforted! And if it please thee, According to thy fancy, nothing forced, Sing us meanwhile a rune here in the night. For song is very like a summer fern Sweeter for dark; and we sad winter birds Will dream a little while more pleasantly. EPI. [chanting]. The noise in the eternal heart abates. The valley of the world is blotted out, And either end the boulders on the gates Are pushed across and shut. The mountains in the dark are growing small. No wind is any more upon the lea. The stone has frittered from the waterfall Down rivers to the sea. The uttermost is swelling out in void, In total night, more cold and emptier Around the ghost of that which is destroyed, The breath of things that were. [A long silence.] PYR. Hush, for I hear him. DEU. Say! PYR. Prometheus Is coming. All thro' my blood the pulses knock, I see the flames—they crackle. DEU. Her brain is wild. EPI. I feel like echoes of the lost daylight— PYR. He comes, he comes. Nay, look how fast the light Rolls gaining on the dark and urges back Like windy boulders of obscurity. His step! I hear him, I see him—Prometheus! PRO. [shouting from far]. This torch will light our lives. Rejoice! up, up! I say we have the sunlight back again. DEU. How sharp a dazzle races the empty air! I see nothing. EPI. It reddens in my two eyes, My brain is needled thro' with pain. PRO. [rushing in with a torch, lights the pyre]. Rejoice, The lost is won! Our dignities once more Resume their proper thrones, and we are men. PYR. Thy forehead shines like morning! on thy neck I lay my arms—but the light kills— PRO. No, come And gladden! Logs here and pitch and all that burns, That kindles, flames. Bring, pile it high as heaven, Along like rivers and across like fields! 'T has dawned at last, such dawn as ne'er before Tore the wide sky. From out bottomless chasms Fountains jet glittering up into the sky And hailstone sparks descend, tumbling like sand Over the mountains swollen in conflagration. DEU. Stay, father, hear me! PRO. I have it from the Gods. Aye, from the hearthstone of the Gods I caught This fire and hope and knowledge won to us— My torch be brandished in the face of Zeus! EPI. Brother, be softer in triumph or we die. PRO. Still was it night, thick night, when I at the base Of their enormous mountain stood, around me A blacker gloom, foliage and bearded firs, All of a forest's heaviness: thro' which Down from the summit wanderingly quired Amazing echoes of a festival, Of instruments and choral song. Below Sounded, like vast itinerant herds afield Under the night, the torrents rumbling on. There I began. Sheer up the night, alone And without fear, catching ahold of pines To swing me higher or stay me from recoil, I climbed. Beneath my trample brushwood crashed In the spongy soil, and snapped the twigs short-off. Behind, dislodged, stone after stone bounded Down thumping to the depths. But straightaway I groped thro' snarls of ragged boughs that scratched My visage blind, and tore the weedy shrubs Which like fine cordage knotted my feet back: So floundered up the dumb dead humid night. Soon thinned the forestry. From tree to tree Espaced, the ground lay tamer,—moss and herbs, A softness underfoot. Then, not a pine, But blind and weary slopes of shale that passed Upward in the deserted gloom. I gasped— 'T was icy still and thin, and very sweet With unseen flowers, the last of earthly things Carelessly blooming in immensity, Where still I mounted like an arrow shot Up with revenge and scorn to the midnight clouds. Sudden the windier air froze and my feet Crunched snow which even in such a dark as was Shone bluely with a smothered light away To the summit. At my throat I felt the void; It stung my sweated face. I stamped the crust, And step by step ascending wilfully Laddered the cold up skyward to the end. Just then that music, which half heard before And undistinguished down the steeps unfurled, Struck quicker rhythm; and looking up I saw Mid draperies of darkness hanging vague A halo shining downwards, in the ice Mirrored like vapour mazed with meteors. In a last hurry I climbed. The freezing dark Was all a tremor of song, and finally A dim design of snowy mansion grew Ghostly and lucid, carved of summer cloud, A white flame tapering at the core of space. And then methought the appalling night and gloom Drew like an ocean's ebb sinkingly down, I swimming out. The floor lay luminous, As when by pale gray weather and no wind A glossy lake at morning falls asleep: Whence grading to the citadel for steps An hundred plinths of crystal led. They cut The mild light slant along their silver edge, Describing circles and diminishing Toward certain columns roundly poised atop. Up to that place of supreme glory, I Man of the niggard earth and god at heart Mounted out of disaster to my place. It seemèd daylight growing and diffused, Splendid, melodious, and of such perfume As warms upon a meadow at afternoon Of cloudless summer; and another light, Neither of sun nor moon, awaked the air To radiance wreathing on the point of all. This was his palace, vastly and circular, Builded of lucent marble, with a film Hung in its height, erratic, shadowing-in Unlikely plants and wondrous ocean-flowers. And placed about stood pillars very firm, Where top to bottom slender flutings ran; And around every pillar drew a belt Mid-high, that brake the rods of light in twain; And there, clamped in a sconce of gold each one And cinct with silver snakes, the torches burned Upholding flames of the everlasting fire, The sacred fire that having once been ours He stole again who names his own self God. EPI. Alas! thy scorn will drag his vengeance down. PRO. Peace, man! He wronged me, and the day is mine. One of those torches is this in my hand. It flamed to right where the entrance is, two bright Iron-swung sheets of brass, firm-barred across And bolted 'gainst the fearful universe: While inside cried aloud perennial choirs To a single note so puissant and superb It seemed an ocean singing to the sun. I heard, and seized the torch. In challenge too Wrenching the clasp, I hurled it formless down Before their gates and turned my feet away. [It thunders.] PYR. Father, be calm. DEU. O desolation and despair! Thou, wretched man, shalt be our ruin. PYR. Hush! The winds are up— EPI. It had to be— PYR. Like streams Swirling before they burst. DEU. A thunder-cloud Unravels down out of the burning sky. PRO. I say, whate'er's achieved, once and for all Stands in defiance, and we at Nature's heart Register signs of our nobility. This is the symbol I have had my will, Which down the crystal stairs into the depth I bore, a little flame thro' darkness, won From summits which henceforth are counted ours. With it I 've lit the world.—Look forth, my children! All the unfolded earth, mountain and vale Holding their fruits aloft, the knotty crags Scattering colour, and the prairies green With tuft and billow of infinite grass: Of all their life your life is nourishèd. Follow the rivers further to the sea And launch your enterprise! The wilful soul Goes forward to possess, and vindicates From strength to strength the majesty of life. EPI. Alas! Nothing will teach thee infelicity. The sunrise is not all: who shall forget For stubbornness or greed the yesterdays Which rivet us to the soil we come of? See, The woman weeps. PYR. [to PROMETHEUS]. I'll follow on—heed not him— Despite exhaustion for the hope— EPI. The hope? What says she? PRO. More of truth than e'er thou knew'st. DEU. Oh, this it is that whets the rusty scythe! And notwithstanding certainly we believe It nothing profits so throughout the year To strain, yet strain all the year thro' we must, And for a hope! Thou mad'st it so! The worm Which bores the parchèd glebe is happier, The goaded oxen plodding for a bread Not theirs, more calm—thou mad'st it so! A curse Upon thee! May thy tortures pay our own, Our stupid agonies that in the daylight now Begin afresh!—I will not struggle more. PRO. He whines. A pity 't is the world consists Of such: who using nature and themselves, Suffer their task and clog with lamentation The rush and furtherance of human things. For hope, being had, suffices; in so much We prosper, and the Gods are idle dreams Strung in the void of our uncertain thoughts. [It thunders.] EPI. Another day has been. DEU. Thunder again! The eternal reason will be justified, And truth descends against the haughty brain. PYR. How 't darkens! PRO. [soliloquising]. She too loses heart. At last, Whatever be done of large and generous, Howe'er one's life be given, and freely all Delight, affection, quiet sacrificed For something bolder to the good of man,— Yet at the last he will prefer disgrace And hug his slavery, leaving him that strove To fight damnation and despair alone. PYR. Ah me, the daylight vanishes in death. [A cloud gradually falls through the scene, and all fades in gray obscurity.] PAN. [singing]. As an immortal nightingale I sing behind the summer sky Thro' leaves of starlight gold and pale That shiver with my melody, Along the wake of the full-moon Far on to oceans, and beyond Where the horizons vanish down In darkness clear as diamond. EPI. On wings of memory the night returns. The great bird gires before he drop again.— Sunlight and country that I knew! O sky! Ye furl yourselves and wander shadowily Into the endless backward of the heart. PYR. It blows and darkens in. Where is he? [It thunders.] THE VOICES OF ZEUS. Man, come with us, come with us, come away! PRO. [aside]. His voice! THE VOICES. Come to receive thy certain pain. PRO. Justice of God, malignant destiny, Delirious curse! how it confounds the brain To see thee blast our strength, and day by day With all thy crooked fingers here rip up The patient fabric of our energy. Over the endless harvest, o'er the home We builded with great pain, for pastime thou Spill'st putrefaction, and upon thy palm The world shakes like an egg, to shut and crush. THE VOICES. Be ready, for the time is Now! We 've come To lead thee to the edge of wilderness. PRO. We'll die in battle. Come near. THE VOICES. Thou canst not die. 'T is thine to struggle everlastingly. Look o'er the world, unhappy wretch, and come! PAN. [singing]. My dew is everywhere Where things are; I fall and flutter and fare, Leaving a star By the roads of earth, in the far Paths of the air. Mine is the milk to charm In a mother's breast, Sweet with her pain and warm With her rest, The life that asks for a nest In her arm; And mine is the violet That so lies In the evening of her wet Sorrowful eyes. For another thing may rise, But her youth has set. Nothing is less with me, Nothing is lost. For I smile on the earth and sea, On the infinite host Of the dead and the living, and most On the yet-to-be. PRO. Pandora, how thou singest o'er my pain Yet of my humiliation nothing! Ah, Farewell, and let thy voice for evermore Sweeten the dreary acres of mankind. THE VOICES. The day is at an end. PRO. But not my deed! The light is theirs and I the giver thereof, Long as blood beats within the human heart.— Unhand me! Ah! THE VOICES. Wear now thy chains. PYR. Who is 't that chains? Where is he now? PRO. Alone, Beyond thy arms, in other hands than thine. THE VOICES. Drag him on! for he balks the will of God. PRO. Yet does my work outstrip the penalty. Nothing may die or live infructuous, And I'm immortal: for I join with Being, And nothing in the universal sphere But is. 'T was with me for a while as with the sun Upon the ocean: writing out in gold The moving characters of highest day, Which to dull creatures of the depth appeared Fantastic and divine and possible. THE VOICES. Drag him away! The stubborn mind has burst. PRO. Many times I have died and yet shall die. For Nature rolls on, while across the chasms From hill to hill and round from east to west Voices pass on the echo to the stars. So forms are laid aside, and if I lived, I was the cresting of the tide wherein An endless motion rose exemplified. THE VOICES. Bear him away, for evening falleth in. [The cloud lifts, PROMETHEUS has disappeared. A great sunset fills the scene.] PAN. [singing]. My soul of sunset every human day In long sad colours on the evening dwells And gives her solemn violet away Over the quiet endlessness of hills. Mild and gold burns from cloud to cloud, above The obscurer fields, my pity for an hour; And then life goes to sleep within my love, The world is drawn together as a flower. Labour at last within the soul is peace, And faithful pain after a certain while Like other things will strengthen and increase And colour at the last into a smile.— Rest in my bosom till thy day be due, Until my day be finished at sunrise, And I behold thee glittering thro' the blue And playing in the sunset of my eyes. EPI. The sunset comes to die now as of yore,— The sad recurrence of remembered things. PYR. He 's gone to suffer, gone whither? Alas! Would I knew where his bleeding head will lie To give my breast for pillow and avert The dreadful vengeance feeding on his soul!— How crimsonly the day declines! Come sleep, Deukalion, for to-morrow brings again The sun he gave us, and the hope—the life. II FRAGMENTS OF A DRAMA ON THE LIFE OF THE EMPEROR JULIAN DRAMATIS PERSONÆ CONSTANCE: THE KING EUSEBIA: THE QUEEN HELENA: HIS SISTER JULIAN: HIS COUSIN EUSEBIUS: LORD CHAMBERLAIN ARBETIO REMIGIUS MERCURIUS APODEMIUS Scene: Milan, Como, Milan. ACT I The Privy Council hall in the Palace at Milan EUSEBIUS REMIGIUS ARBETIO MERCURIUS EUSEBIUS. Have you the news of't? ARBETIO. Rumours, nothing more. EUS. And yet by this the Fury should be dead. They had him. MERCURIUS. Oh, had him! perhaps! but well we know, While yet th' imperial prisoner, hither bound, At Adrianople tarried, now and again A soldier, privy officer, detached From garrisons then wintered thereabouts, Down the palatial corridors or plain At the high gate with pleas of business still Admittance to the Cæsar asked. They say None saw him, but— ARB. None. I have 't too certainly That we should vex our comfort and belief With your amused suspicions. MER. Often, Sir, You 're well informed, and oft again too well. EUS. I judge Arbetio right. A costly risk To slip a criminal so superb! Let be, For newer things press for attention. This monster dead, as out of doubt I say He will be or is, one, only one remains Of the imperial race, this man's half-brother And cousin to King Constance, Julian. I make no question (as having darkly, yet In words sufficient, touched upon this theme Amongst us all and certain other few You know of) hereupon the agreement stands: That he we speak of, newly here arrived By order, Julian— MER. Tush! Some one comes. [Enter SERVANT.] SERVANT. One Apodemius in the Courtyard waits His Majesty's good pleasure. EUS. Looks he glad? SER. Dead with his haste and journey, yet withal A bearer of good news, your Lordship. EUS. Let Apodemius appear—or no! You'll wait an order. [Exit SERVANT.] Cæsar's dead. If then Occasion come to push our scheme, the road In general direction cleared, it needs No further counsel to begin, excepting What special case the future bring to note. We have our cues. [Preceded by guards, the KING and QUEEN enter and take their seats.] KING. We give you all good morrow. Has news arrived from Pola? EUS. Please you, one Waits your good order, Apodemius. KING. Waits? How is this? EUS. This minute just announced. KING. Order him 'fore us. Quick! [EUSEBIUS calls in SERVANT, who goes to fetch APODEMIUS.] You counsellors, In such a matter, when the Roman realm Shudders in earthquake, play a peevish rôle. Where is this man? It seems we wait! It seems— [APODEMIUS enters. The guards meanwhile are dismissed.] Tell him, Eusebius, he may speak to us. APODEMIUS. His Majesty 's obeyed, the tyrant dead: Yet in the extreme of haste so to outstrip All speed of rumour and uncertain noise, That first the fact this Royal Highness first Might fully hold, I not an instant hung With pen or style my duties to detail, But straight on the issue, seen participant, Springing to horse and spurring, here I am Without a brief and only fit to speak. Will 't please his Majesty— KING. He has our ear. APO. I pass how, to our order prompt, we rode, Barbatio and I, hence from Milan The long and wintry way hot-speed across Venetia's windy plane-land by Trieste And, rounding Caraganca, east and north. On the ninth day, sunset, we did dismount At the inn appointed at Petovio And straight were ushered 'fore his Majesty's High cousin Gallus, Cæsar of th' Orient. Whom first we reassured, then hand to hand— He tame but twitching, and with sloven eyes But soft, suspicious, timid, dangerous— We stripped his regal robes and changing clapped A soldier's shirt and cloak upon him. “Quick up!” Barbatio said to the man, and in his eyes Two sparks grew big and died. Then all of us With Leontius, Lucillian, Scudilo (The last at the whip), in public waggon drove. 'T was bitter dark. That night and all the day, Served by relays and weather, rattling past Celeja and Emona, late we made Nauportus; and a carcass to the floor Could have no dull-or-deader slumped than I. I slept the matter of a night-watch, then Sat upright, cold awake, a crazy scream Fresh in my ear. I crept to Cæsar's door: Which drawn ajar, I heard about his chamber The man astir and shuffling, short of breath, Who in delirium poorly blurted out Pieces of names and words, Awful entreaties to a swarm of ghosts That steeply wading up the dark, said he, Uncoiled their arms at him. A moment then Cut by a gasp—their fingers had his throat— And suddenly over down he fell to ground. From embers twinkling on the foreroom hearth I lit a lamp— KING. O finish, Sir! be quick. He was a—Briefer much! I say, be much, Much briefer. Ho, proceed. APO. The morrow come— KING [stamping on the ground]. Proceed, I said. You hear me. Eusebius, Tell this impossible man to say his tale. MER. [aside]. He 's very troubled. APO. Crossed the chamber where Snoring upon their straw my fellows lay, The door then pushing aside which forward sucked My wretched flame, I entered. On the floor He sprawled and opened up to mine Unspeakable bad eyes, his flaxen beard Red with a gash in falling, and his breath From hollow nostrils hanging white and full In the black cold. He staggered on my arm Back fainting to the truckle-bed. Next day Close on sunrise we rounded by Trieste For Pola, slackening to the common pace, For he was sick. There on the second morn Arraigned before ourselves 't was asked of him, In th' Emperor's name and ceremonious, why All thro' the Roman East and Antioch, why With such a thrifty hand he countersigned That world of deaths. Whereat his visage grew Gray-white and glazen; dizzy to a chair He sank and, near distorted with dry sobs, Blubbered the name of Constantina, his wife, Who 'd pricked him on. Barbatio then pronounced Death on him. That moment in our council-hall Especially despatched Serenian came To urge the royal haste. We seized the caitiff, Strapping his hands behind him; flung him down Dead-faint with terror, an unfeeling mass Lying outstretched, and 'headed him.—I saw, And mounting spurred away: in proof whereof Down at the kingly feet I cast his shoes Of which the purple heels a thousand lives Ground into anguish. KING [after a pause and slowly]. Dead! Gallus is dead; Our subjects and our kingdom and ourselves Are rid—[eyeing APODEMIUS and aside] he 's surely speaking truth—are rid Of one we nurtured, loved, and lifted up Beside us: but th' imperial mind and blood In him grew cancerous, and inch by inch, Even as I feared of him, of others, of— [A pause.] [To APODEMIUS.] We thank our servants well; a recompense Remigius from our private fund will pay, An hundred aurei. [APODEMIUS and REMIGIUS exeunt.] ARB. [aside]. H'm! Conscience-money! MER. [to ARBETIO]. You say? ARB. [to MERCURIUS carefully]. It might, I say, Sir, have been less. EUS. If one so private as a servant speak, This riddance falls a miracle, done to all By your own Majesty's most reverent self. More shrewdly planned, more wise in every point No measure e'er was took, and managed so Direct from the Imperial Throne, amid What trouble, care, anxiety! MER. Indeed A friend in office, who like none other knows That Syrian region where this hydra raged, Writes how the gladness lighting every face Blazons you forth in hymns. EUS. And nearly now Your sacred throne in undisturbed repose— [A pause.] KING. Ah, nearly! EUS. Nearly! Would the truth were quite. QUEEN. Your drift, your meaning, my Lord Chamberlain? EUS. Not without counsel 'fore your Majesties I broach a thing yourselves and (God knows) we Distressed consider. Nothing now were said And my mistaken thought forgot and gone, But that a question haply put, a word Here dropped and there, a gesture, showed, Alas! not only I, but others, nay Many the same in secret had revolved. I mean the dead man's brother, Julian. KING. And—what of him? EUS. What say you, Arbetio? ARB. A studious man. MER. If only studious! For study then he left Macellum? KING. Left? EUS. This I'd not heard. MER. Your Majesties remember By their good pleasure certain years ago These cousins, then but youths, both were removed To Cappadocia. There with retinue, Tutors and priests and whatsoever goes For princely education, they abode In the imperial palace at Macellum, Free surely, but too young, no doubt too young To roam at pleasure and—enough!— QUEEN. My Lord, Think you in private here this matter needs A language so obscure? MER. Believe me, I mean— [To the KING.] Well, in religion did your Majesty's Blest father Constantine, and, following him, Did not your sacred self edict and write Yourselves and all the imperial realm of Rome Christians, followers of the crucified? In the which spirit these cousins of your blood With care were tutored. Certain still it is Incognito this very Julian, Seen in Nicomedeia, heard and loved The pagan Greeks; nor only churches there, But elsewhere temples oft he visited With friends, with many friends. EUS. A virtue this That nature richly gave him. A mere boy, He wore misfortune prettily, as tho' Knowing the popular heart; and walked abroad With modest ways. But mine is harder news. When the man Gallus, treasonable and A prisoner by the common judgment damned, Still unsuspecting here from Syria Journeyed upon these summons, and awhile Within Constantinople played the King, This brother of his there met, conferred with him— KING. Where had you this? EUS. Your Majesty— KING. Where had you this? Around my throne I feel a sea of snakes Rocking their heads, and struck I each new day A score of them, the tide still hisses in Snapping its poisoned whips. To keep alive And steer this kingdom forward into time, It needs a thousand eyes, and in the skull Brains like an ant-hill. So then Julian Talked with this madman and, you say, conspired— EUS. Conferred— KING. And Gallus came—he surely knew 't— To answer justice. EUS. Oh, very like, altho' It appears he knew not. KING. I know a thousand things: Rancorous memories, present ills and fears, And wicked calculations yet to be, They talked of, whispering, this tricky pair. MER. They 're now no more a pair, your Majesty. QUEEN [to EUSEBIUS]. 'T was in Constantinople—how long ago Say you, my Lord, this happened? EUS. Of the day, Tho' my report in nothing specifies, 'T were easy reckoning—if't be true or false. QUEEN. I 'd somehow thought the prince about those days Half way to Milan here. ARB. Indeed. QUEEN. My Liege, Rather than hang in this uneasy thought And catch suspicion, say, we heard the man Here now himself— KING. Not now. QUEEN. For ne'er as yet Yourself have seen him; scarcely at court have we Noticed his figure, consecrate it seems To dusty books and dead philosophies. From his apartments, neighbour tho' he be, He goes abroad affrighted, gloomy, shy, And blinking in the royal light. A word Might lure him to us, or at least disclose His deeper thought. KING. Not now, not here. QUEEN. Methinks It ill befits our Selves and ministers To make gossip of justice; and yourself Are in this thing distinguished that you dealt Only the large inevitable Fate. KING. As far as in us lies. QUEEN. In whom lies all, Whom all regards, of whom does all depend. KING. And so, alas, we were eternity. QUEEN. Now worthily yourself—as one who sees The heart of things—a moment here admit This man before you. Maybe he 's a thing Unfit your use: well, then away with him. Your purpose lies across the world too swift For mean distinction: so, away with him. But if he 've stuff to serve, obey you and Receive your orders, here a moment lost Is wisdom, justice, prudence and yourself. KING. Arbetio, here, approach us. EUS. [to MERCURIUS aside]. The—the Queen About this thing behaves a shade—what say you? MER. 'T is said she pities him; and then, and then A woman, childless, young—but not in youth. EUS. You knew her fancy? MER. I? And you? KING [to ARBETIO]. And say We ask our cousin here before us, on A matter of high concern. [Exit ARBETIO.] EUS. Your Majesty No doubt in this is well-advised; we pray That somehow rumour wrongs him, and somehow He will assure us, being a different man Than was his fearful brother. QUEEN. Step-brothers Are oft alike in name, nay, brothers even! Yet in our cousin 't is not himself, the man, Concerns us, but the manner of his use. For were he, as 't appears, a student merely, To us he goes for nothing; and therefor We see him, to choose amongst his qualities. MER. Your Highnesses alone Can judge their servants, or if any such They wish. Nay, for the matter of his faith He might indeed be pagan, might as 't were Repudiate th' imperial creed— KING. Is this So certain? MER. Your Majesty mistakes; I say: He might so be, yet none the less subserve The public interest. Further, if't be true As 't is reported, he in private held With the dead criminal his brother, why, It matters less, much less it matters than [Enter ARBETIO and JULIAN.] When Gallus was alive. JULIAN [aside]. Was—said he was? To sting me. Four, five vultures! Many behind Fly croaking up. Beware! It 's full of eyes. [To the KING.] Your Majesty has been pleased—your— [As he bows at the throne he sees the Cæsar's shoes.] Pardon me— Is—is he dead? [Looks at ARBETIO, who gives a sign of assent; guards are just visible at the door.] KING. My cousin Julian, We have summoned you to learn— JUL. [aside]. My hour is come! KING. First how the Cæsar Gallus, time ago Complained of and accused day after day In Syria, Palestine, in Egypt; cursed Here at my throne so oft, so bitterly, By soldier and civilian, multitudes, It seemed it rained his crimes; and finally Howled out of Asia by the hungry mobs He had harried into frenzy: him, say I, Our court sitting in judgment heard, and damned By his own sentence. JUL. [aside]. They 're in ambush here To choke me with his blood. QUEEN. My cousin, come! You 're dizzy, sit you down. The dreadful news Has left you sick. JUL. [aside]. A woman to sweeten it! QUEEN. Recover, recollect: your better mind, Your truer mind will be, like us, severe. It is the parent's pain, it is the ruler's That mercy fails and in the larger end Justice alone is good. Bethink you now, This man your brother and our cousin, raised To sit beside us on the Roman throne: How can your love in him obliterate The thing he was, or rescue even his grave From all those visitors— JUL. [starting up]. Yes, Madam, yes! Out of the dark a wiry pair of hands Upon their victim fastened either side Shake the breath out of him, and hoisting high His pitiable skeleton in the wind Drop it away on some black shore where Ocean Shouts a damnation on 't for evermore. KING [muttering]. Take him away, he is a spy of Night, Take him away. EUS. Your Majesty desires? [Motions to the guards.] JUL. [aside.] Their grips contract. O God, tear out my soul! QUEEN. My Liege, we lose our purpose. Had we not Some questions here to clear? JUL. [aside]. Questions, oho! KING. 'T was in Constantinople you last beheld This man of wrath? JUL. Even as you say. [The KING starts. EUSEBIUS smiles. JULIAN continues aside.] He smiles. They've trapped me—a deadly point—what was 't I said? KING. Often alone you saw him? Around him you had Friends or a party? What! Th' appointed guard Approved your intercourse? Answer me, Sir, Your money oiled the locks, and you with Gallus Compared your secrecies? JUL. Money—and guards? Foolish or mad—I nothing understand. 'T was in Constantinople—so much I know— Three years ago, as many a man may tell— [The KING is satisfied.] Arbetio, you were there. ARB. My Lord, I was. EUS. In days more recent nor so long ago As three years since, no doubt your Lordship knows Cæsar lay in the city? JUL. Perhaps. I know It seems a thousandfold more years than three Since last I saw his face. EUS. Not, then, two months? JUL. Gods of Heaven! The patience of the sea and wind Would crack like glass and starting up the air Draw blood from heaven. Can I go diving down The muddy fathoms of your thought? What is 't? My eyes are here: why, then, look into them.— I'm lost: The sun there sputters on the verge and goes Whirled off in ashes; the earth swells after it; It 's night, and cruel things, talons and beaks, Dash criss-cross in the dark. EUS. He 's wandering. QUEEN. Open the window. Spring and morning soon Will charm the frightened brain. It 's o'er.—My cousin, We wish you nothing ill. A rumour told You and the Cæsar in Constantinople, Where marked for punishment he there abode, Two months ago conferred. JUL. Then rumour lies, And for all petty mention and regard Of time and place and thought and day and hour I speak the rough, short truth: I was not there. No one but knows, or might if know they would, The places of my dwelling,—the better know, That not my fancy chooses, but the will Of mine imperial cousin and master: whom Never at all in aught I disobeyed. KING. So we believe, approve, and do expect As from a Christian subject. JUL. [aside]. Christian! MER. [to EUSEBIUS]. He sticks at Christian. KING. It had on us devolved, Child that you were, to rear you and to instruct; And at Macellum where those your boyish years In good seclusion passed, well you remember We appointed to you prelates and divines Of that True Faith whereof blest Constantine, My august father, champion first arose. For he, we after him, and with us you, Abjure the foolish gods: our throne adores Christ Jesus: Rome and Christendom. MER. [to EUSEBIUS]. He frowns. EUS. [to MERCURIUS]. This man we called a bookworm hides I' the scabbard of his mind a fearful thought. I'll not believe it stands for him in earnest With baubles of religion. MER. [to EUSEBIUS]. So say I. EUS. [aside]. 'T is passing strange. KING. You 're silent, answer us. JUL. Of me was nothing asked. KING. You 're trifling, Sir. Of old it seems you knew Nicomedeia And from Macellum wandered oft, a boy, In her downfalling temples. JUL. [aside]. Desperation! The Christians on the scent: I stand at bay. KING. Is 't true? JUL. Macellum ne'er I left at all But by your order. It grates me to repeat I speak the truth; and, good or bad, my witness I cannot better, not I. Am I a skulk, A beast that steals at evening slyly abroad? All they can see who will, [aside] and many watch. KING. You visit oft and travel far to see The ruined shrines. JUL. [quickly, then dreaming]. In this was no restriction Upon me made. My study long has lain In things forgot, or nearly; and of them The shadows lengthening at later day And spiritual out of the sun's great heart In violet, in crimson, and in gold Walk the forlorn campanias, to the sound Of Homer's hymns in order filing on Between Ionian columns—[MERCURIUS smiles.] Mercurius, Did ever you see an ape? MER. My Lord, I did. JUL. They grin, they chuckle: think you they understand? MER. No doubt your Lordship speaks Of the philosophers and pagan priests That in the gardens of Nicomedeia— Edesius, Chrysanthius, Maximus— JUL. Poor courtier, you blaspheme. KING. What are these men? JUL. They 're—woe to them!—this gentleman has said it: Merely philosophers and pagan priests, Who in the brain's high nonsense are embarked On seas of error, wastes of speculation, After the quest and mirage of the truth. Pity for them, my Lords! Had they been able, They 'd vowed their vulgar lives to better ends, To court and office, manners, money, and The brilliant business of ambition; Also, they 'd long abandoned the ancient creed, Abandoned long ago beliefs that—they 'd Been converts to the new, but that their souls, Saturate and all kneaded up in one With dull ideals of an extinguished world, Live in them and go like drunken mariners Bows-on for folly and th' enormous night. Nevertheless in them I keep some interest— Pardon me, all!—I stand not much ashamed Of talking idly, now a little and then, With these poor people. Alas, your Majesty! Let me go back! I beg: let me go back! I nothing ask of life, nothing at all But what in the divine disposal lies Obscurely measured to the simple man. I do not look to climb the dizzy rungs Of power and victory; suspicion Loses her time about my lonely life; I have no skill with men; the worldly art Crazes and irritates me, and the sight Of all this complication and design Rubs an acid into my brain that makes me— A pantomime. KING. We'll further talk of this Another time. The charges laid against you— As kindly we foresaw—are things to warn Your farther life. You leave us. [Exit JULIAN slowly.] EUS. [to MERCURIUS]. Of two things This man is one: a viper that belief Gasps to conceive of, or else a simpleton Fast going mad. MER. [to EUSEBIUS]. He may be what he seems. KING. Your presences we later shall require. From our infinite realm at various points Bad news of war and insurrection crowds So thick I doubt myself. A single man, Whoe'er he be and at his own self's best, Recoils, and weakening pitiably cries He 's but a man. EUS. This cannot here be said, And Fortune bows to Genius on a throne. KING. You'll find our counsellors assembled: they With you await our pleasure. [Exeunt EUSEBIUS, MERCURIUS, and ARBETIO.] Eusebius Alone deserves our sum of royal trust. QUEEN. As for this Julian— KING. Of him— QUEEN. His brain With study and solitude is all o'erwrought. He 's a mad child; only a little rest And looking leisurely in human eyes Would quite restore him. The stuff and fibre is there That you should use, and in your thoughts alone Of all the cunning men 't was plain to see You guessed him out. KING. I did, no doubt I did. QUEEN. The Spring 's far gone and Summer comes apace: We leave for Como. What say you, my Liege? Your sister Helena and myself can take This madcap with us; we'll have Mercurius To advise our action. Near us he'll betray His way of life, his nature and his hope. We'll make him ours or—What character had his father? KING. I knew him little; speak not of him. QUEEN. Or else What is to 'come of him? KING. Accursed thought. QUEEN. Then trust us with him. KING. Take him away, But hold, but—understand me—day and night Held fast. I think he should not ever escape. ACT II FRAGMENTS I JULIAN. ... there singing mends His tackles on the shore— REMIGIUS. I'll bid him stop To trouble you with his noise. QUEEN. ... but that it's youth, We all had youth, but not all sang it thro'. II QUEEN The rarer gift Is in the uses of imagination. Many a poet or philosopher Above his private ecstasy has seen Venus and Truth, but from the sacred mount With inward glory silently descended Too selfish or too poor to speak a word. Some very few have spoken, and by them Humanity reminded to herself More truly lives. But fewer, oh, how much fewer Are they who crowning inspiration gave The proof and grace of a majestic life, And in the sordid world, the press of men, Greed, pleasure, crime, abandon, passion, death, Still armoured in their visionary gold Did human deeds. Rather in this they fail; and by how much The flame rolls whiter thro' their mortal heart, Their brain more terrible, their open eyes Quicker and more fantastic, and their souls Strung for a brighter flight among the stars, So their relapse outdoes disaster—as if Genius were a debt of Man to Nature Paid alive on itself. JUL. You know not what it is to be alone; You know it not. EUS. Oh, God forgive you this. III LATER LYRICS [I Listen! As though from other times and days] Listen! As though from other times and days, Continuous and one and hard to know, An hymn of human angels very low Drifts o'er the ground and by the seashore stays Ebbed in the lonely ripple. Hush, it strays More near the time and being that are now, And, as together with them soon to go, Sings itself further on and on always. And it will come to pass we also then, In some more crimson twilight of our lives, Suddenly in the choir nor knowing why, Will have a voice within us: all we men Between the time that gives and that deprives Take up the theme and pass it, as we die. [II I saw how that a painter, given o'er] I saw how that a painter, given o'er To love's persuasion, heeded less and less The voice that crying in the wilderness Had made him strong and lonely and obscure; Then as he wandered in the world once more, Upon his canvas coloured a distress Of dreams and fancy dirtied in the press, And gray descended where was light before. Wherefore my soul in suffering addressed Her question, asking if these lovers e'er Had laid the burden of themselves to rest. I know that either, smothering despair, Had turned away and shed a dreadful tear,— And notwithstanding sought each other's breast. [III With long black wings an angel standing by] With long black wings an angel standing by Opened his arms, as had he a lover been. His lips were very cold and lingered thin Along my lips half-broken with a cry. From all his body I most dreadfully Did draw the cruel cold and slowly win Heart-ache on heart-ache; yet I gathered in The great black wings that stiffened as to fly. In that embrace it seemed that years of pain Passed very slow, and yet my body tight I held to his till darkness took my brain. Somehow I woke, and up the dying night I saw him spread great glittering wings of white. I knew your brow was cooled, you well again. [IV You are to me the full vermilion rose] You are to me the full vermilion rose That Love with trembling arms uplifted crowned, Yet moist from April's irised diamond, Queen of the summer over all that grows. And while the rings of petal still disclose, My spirit likewise tenderly unbound Falls out in webs of shadow, and around The mercy of your beauty finds repose. And often when the airs of midnight fail, I dream I lift you skyward all for me Into the moonlight of futurity, A darkling star, a quiet nightingale That wakens in my arms beyond the pale Of what I was or am or thought to be. [V The trees and shrubbery glimmer] The trees and shrubbery glimmer. Lilacs are over. A little more sun, and summer Will glow in the clover. Darling, why tarry so? Come to your lover! I have played alone in the Spring, Laughed at the flowers And the birds that nibbling their wing Perched on the old gray towers. But, darling, the leaves cannot stay on the bowers. I've tripped it away with your shadow Over the grasses, And stayed where a breath of meadow Happily passes Into the city and under the chestnut masses. [VI A glad little rift, so shy] A glad little rift, so shy Back of the boughs' black net, Shows in the hurrying sky Blue as a violet, There!—but it 's all blown by. O what a wind to-day Playing at hide and seek After the pale sun-ray That slips from the cloud,—and quick It 's raining over the way. But I know the winter is done, No one but me! I know. Listen, Lovely, my own, Where under the melted snow Softly we lie alone. Open the darling eyes, Breathe of the early air! My heart, if the weather surprise, Will shelter thy bud from care. Trust me, darling, arise. [VII I love thee longer and I love thee most] I love thee longer and I love thee most— Altho' I love thee always to the end— To-day among the blossoms lightly tossed That with the sunshine blend, Below the bright new leaves and wandering Within the warm and lilac-laden breeze, I love thee most this only day of spring Under the open trees. This thick curled hyacinth is all for thee. The tulips yonder wave to get a smile. Make them as happy, love! Ah happy me! Love them a little while. I am so happy, happy, being thine! There draws throughout my breast from backward far A lonely highroad up to the sky line, To thee, my sunset-star. And tip-toe on the height my soul looked up With asking eyes, and softly flew away. I love thee in the ways of Paradise, I love thee most to-day. The sun is westering in thy dark red hair; Let me throw down my armful here of bloom, And leaned on this acacia let us share The daylight going home. And suffer once that from thy lips I drink The livelong happiness of our to-day, Till at thy feet in songs and prayer I sink That thou shouldst call me thine. [VIII Dear and rich as a dawn of summer] Dear and rich as a dawn of summer Over the sea and the irised foam, Out of the past a bright newcomer Into my arms thou wingest home. Here on the shore with wild lips parted I lift my hands in quivering prayer. Sunlight is thou, and thou sunhearted Draw'st bright-eyed thro' the golden air. All the days that have tarried sterile Burst into flower and lift their crown. Walk, my sweet, from the past and peril Into my heart and lay thee down. For nothing of life or the days I wander, Myself, hereafter, before or now, Or the hour I save or the year I squander Is anything any more but thou. I've pressed thee a perfume of all my spirit And jewelled the twilight of my soul: O my darling, anoint thee! wear it! The days blow by and the seasons roll. Come! 'bove us here in the russet heather Hold thou away to the westering sun This bunch of grapes, till they grow together And glow and globe like a harvest moon! Then we'll ravish them for a greeting, And look so near in each other's eyes I'll feel thy blood thro' my bosom beating And sigh for my all of life thy sighs. Nay, and here are my lips that kiss thee, Here my cheek on thy bosom rests; And filled with light, in my eyes grown misty, The lilies in evening of thy breasts; Here is the cup of my life's full measure: Put thy lips to it, Heaven of mine! Thine so long as it be thy pleasure,— Were 't so no longer, yet always thine. [IX And, the last day being come, Man stood alone] And, the last day being come, Man stood alone Ere sunrise on the world's dismantled verge, Awaiting how from everywhere should urge The Coming of the Lord. And, behold, none Did come,—but indistinct from every realm Of earth and air and water, growing more And louder, shriller, heavier, a roar Up the dun atmosphere did overwhelm His ears; and as he looked affrighted round Every manner of beast innumerable All thro' the shadows crying grew, until The wailing was like grass upon the ground. Asudden then within his human side Their anguish, since the goad he wielded first, And, since he gave them not to drink, their thirst, Darted compressed and vital.—As he died, Low in the East now lighting gorgeously He saw the last sea-serpent iris-mailed Which, with a spear transfixèd, yet availed To pluck the sun down into the dead sea. X DEDICATION Soft be your journey as a bird's Who, feeling winter whet the air, Gyres and from the zenith there Slants infinitely down southwards On outspread wings And sings. Within my bosom blew this rose That on the moonlit autumn wind I toss to you—and may you find Upon your pillow of repose The flower of My love. XI A FLOWER As kneeling at a water's edge Into my heart when I look down, Thy face uprising from the sedge Lies on the surface water-blown; And while the current pushes rings About thy cheek, thy chin and brow, I muse and ponder many things: For who am I? am I not thou? 'T is therefore all these idle hours I spend alone and none knows why: I see thee in the water-flowers Upon the current doubtfully. XII A STONE With burning hands and eyes all dull I bring to you this drop of fire, This topaz where the summerful Of August afternoons expire. The stone you gave me long ago: A meteor from your life, it sought My lonely bosom and below Lay glowing in the gloom of thought. From thence I took it pure and whole To comfort me to-day, and found That from the waters of my soul These bands of gold have drawn around, This little setting's nervous art, Slow-formed but mighty, made to hold The sunshine visiting the dark— You, darling, that my arms enfold. XIII PARDON I dreamed that I was blind and you were mine; And for that I had spoiled your better part, Did iron shame and frenzy pace my heart Like wolves. Yet sweeter ne'er the sun did shine, The swaying flowers, the colours vespertine And the strange quietude of human art. In my dead eyes I felt the water start And falling down I prayed: “If I am thine, That here within thy shadow I am well And live so in the nearness of thy soul, Forgive me that I linger in thy sight! Forgive that up the cliffs of heaven I stole And at the brink seized thee and with thee fell Backward and down the oceans of the night.” XIV SERVICE Chide me not, darling, that I sing Familiar thoughts and metres old: Nay, do not scold My spirit's childish uttering. I know not why 't is that or this I murmur to you thus or so: Only I know It throbs across my silences, It blows over my heart,—a long Infinite wind, again, again! Again! and then My life kneels down into a song. XV CHESTNUTS IN NOVEMBER I Not all the trees are done, the branches mean, The trunks begrimed and sodden, no, not all. How fresh and, tho' a few, how prodigal On yonder chestnut here and there are seen White wisps, and, frilled about them, bits of green! They colour on the deadness of the Fall, They spring and with the 'lated swallows call Happy next year into the year that 's been. O call not Nature spendthrift, and of these Say not they bloom in error for the frost! The sweetness of all things are promises That sing our souls a little further on Toward that which may be found in what is lost, Which may come back again of what is gone. II I also, where I stand within thy soul A plant of thine and growing in thy year, Must, if the season turneth to the sere, If so it please thee, lose my aureole. Yet tho' my leaves to the last one should roll Away down on the wind and disappear, And I should nothing question but the drear Great darkness should impenetrate me whole, The midnight in my eyes would ne'ertheless Not firmly hang, but sway, and breaking shine With thoughts of gold and stars of happiness, That at the end thou mightest repossess, Mightest possess again and further bless My sad and human acres, that are thine. XVI FIDELITY Not lost or won but above all endeavour Thy life like heaven circles around mine; Thy eyes it seems upon my eyes did shine Since forever. For aught he summon up his earliest hour No man remembers the surprise of day, For where he saw with virgin wonder play The first flower. And o'er the imagination's last horizon No brain has leaning descried nothing more: Still there are stars and in the night before More have arisen. Not won or lost is unto thee my being; Our eyes were always so together met. If mine should close, if ever thine forget, Time is dying. [XVII With thy two eyes look on me once again] With thy two eyes look on me once again. Since certain days, I know not how it is, I feel the swell of tidal darknesses Climb in my soul and overwhelm my brain. To-day is Spring, I know that it is Spring. The new-mown hay about the lilac bush Sweetens the morning wind, and there a flush Of roses leads the garden's offering. From leafy heights of chestnut hang and play Long webs of sun and shadow, and the bloom Is leaning up its head above the gloom— White in the happy blue and yellow May. And all the air sparkles with minstrelsy— Fresh, early love-songs twittered wing to wing Over the dew. O loved one, it is Spring! With thy two eyes look on me ere I die. It must be thus, I knew it thus would be; And it embalms my soul now to behold The eternal year disclose its heart of gold And whirl in petalled clouds about the sky. I do beseech thee here, as falling down Before thy feet I render thee my love, Look on me now, look on me from above As tho' in heavenly truth thou wert my own. [XVIII When bye and bye relenting you regret] When bye and bye relenting you regret All of these possible and vanished hours, And, rolling up, the certain tempest scours Your sky where not another star will set; When all before your eyes, no longer wet, By life's memorial paths and fading bowers Shrivels the remnant of a thousand flowers, Do not forget, I say, do not forget The long and lonely hours I burned away, The lonely days; in pity do recall What miles of solitude I suffered o'er. It need not so have been, but you did say It should be so, and I replied, It shall, And lo, it is, it is for evermore XIX LONELINESS These autumn gardens, russet, gray and brown, The sward with shrivelled foliage strown, The shrubs and trees By weary wings of sunshine overflown And timid silences,— Since first you, darling, called my spirit yours, Seem happy, and the gladness pours From day to day, And yester-year across this year endures Unto next year away. Now in these places where I used to rove And give the dropping leaves my love And weep to them, They seem to fall divinely from above, Like to a diadem Closing in one with the disheartened flowers. High up the migrant birds in showers Shine in the sky, And all the movement of the natural hours Turns into melody. [XX As pilgrims, when the ways of winter ope] As pilgrims, when the ways of winter ope, Would fain behold the places where they prayed Alive with violets and new with shade, And, where they knelt, a golden buttercup: So strains within my soul a wandering hope To see how brightly now are rearrayed The stations where I saw her, and, afraid, My kneeling life was lost and carried up— A thing that in the praise of vanishing Did like an incense for a moment's space, Burning itself away from what it was, Outsoar the elevation and outsing The choirs of glory, while with fragrant wing It veiling passed before Madonna's face. [XXI Quiet after the rain of morning] Quiet after the rain of morning Midday covers the dampened trees; Sweet and fresh in the languid breeze Still returning Birds are twittering at ease. And to me in the far and foreign Land as further I go and come, Sweetly over the wearisome Endless barren Flutter whisperings of home. There between the two hillocks lightens Straight and little a bluish bar: I feel the strain of the mariner Grows and tightens After home and after her. [XXII If tho' alone I scarce do sigh] If tho' alone I scarce do sigh Because thy spirit stayeth by, Think what it were if thou wert near, If thou wert here. Within the sweet-aired mountain town So far, so strange, so all our own,— Why makest thou so long delay So far away? The waters tumbling make a sound Of all our joys that fall to ground; The stars shine to the uttermost Of what we lost. If some one only happy be For this our narrowed destiny! If some one draw a gladder breath Out of our death. [XXIII Grudge not that I so long for thee] Grudge not that I so long for thee, These foreign hours within the land Where every day brings song for thee And 'fore my sight In every light Thou dost stand. I ask thee not to follow me And leave the treasure of thy soul, Nor e'er again to hallow me With the surprise Of thy sweet eyes Opened whole. My dream shall not lie heavy on The tender region of thy hope,— The sunrise of oblivion Across the sky's Nocturnities Flutters up! But when across the greenery Of forest tree and meadow grass And o'er the summer scenery Sunlit and kind The twilight wind Comes to pass, The tears arise so fortunate, The heart's delight so fair and free— Alas that I'm importunate, If yet I grieve Not then to give Half to thee. [XXIV Spirits that might have been] Spirits that might have been, Ye birds and butterflies Under the showers! Why will ye ever lean Your weft of music and of irises On my plain flowers? Come here, I pray, no more, Or for a little while Let me alone. More honey 's at the core Of the blue thyme and little camomile There further on. The sky is still and blue, But changing in your flight Flushes and sings. Then do I crimson too And humming gladly, suffer all the night Your absent wings. XXV SEPARATION Good-night, my sweetheart. Spring has come again And the May moonlight strokes the rainy trees. The sky is fresh and happy; fireflies Rise in its azure edge and wane. Alone I go and lay me down alone, Yet on my lips the sweetness of thy breast,— Yet on thy bosom lay my cheek to rest And fold my soul forever in thy own. XXVI AT SAINTE-MARGUERITE The gray tide flows and flounders in the rocks Along the crannies up the swollen sand. Far out the reefs lie naked—dunes and blocks Low in the watery wind. A shaft of land Going to sea thins out the western strand. It rains, and all along and always gulls Career sea-screaming in and weather-glossed. It blows here, pushing round the cliff; in lulls Within the humid stone a motion lost Ekes out the flurried heart-beat of the coast. It blows and rains a pale and whirling mist This summer morning. I that hither came— Was it to pluck this savage from the schist, This crazy yellowish bloom without a name, With leathern blade and tortured wiry frame? Why here alone, away, the forehead pricked With dripping salt and fingers damp with brine, Before the offal and the derelict And where the hungry sea-wolves howl and whine Live human hours? now that the columbine Stands somewhere shaded near the fields that fall Great starry sheaves of the delighted year, And globing rosy on the garden wall The peach and apricot and soon the pear Drip in the teasing hand their sugared tear. Inland a little way the summer lies. Inland a little and but yesterday I saw the weary teams, I heard the cries Of sicklemen across the fallen hay, And buried in the sunburned stacks I lay Tasting the straws and tossing, laughing soft Into the sky's great eyes of gold and blue And nodding to the breezy leaves aloft Over the harvest's mellow residue. But sudden then—then strangely dark it grew. How good it is, before the dreary flow Of cloud and water, here to lie alone And in this desolation to let go Down the ravine one with another, down Across the surf to linger or to drown The loves that none can give and none receive, The fearful asking and the small retort, The life to dream of and the dream to live! Very much more is nothing than a part, Nothing at all and darkness in the heart. I would my manhood now were like the sea.— Thou at high-tide, when compassing the land Thou find'st the issue short, questioningly A moment poised, thy floods then down the strand Sink without rancour, sink without command, Sink of themselves in peace without despair, And turn as still the calm horizon turns, Till they repose little by little nowhere And the long light unfathomable burns Clear from the zenith stars to the sea-ferns. Thou art thy Priest, thy Victim and thy God. Thy life is bulwarked with a thread of foam, And of the sky, the mountains and the sod Thou askest nothing, evermore at home In thy own self's perennial masterdom. [1902?] [XXVII I dreamed. Aye, it was very dark] I dreamed. Aye, it was very dark And yet the cliffs were red. I sat me down hard by a watershed And watched as in the current sped Spark after spark Down the dark. The pine-trees with their branches hummed A warm, mid-summer air. That night none of the nightingales were there. A cricket, in the grasses rare, Close by, benumbed, Sometimes thrummed. I leaned over the water's flight, And where the foam threads whirred, Out of the cataract I freshly heard The voice of an alighting bird; “Come down the night To the light.” [1903] [XXVIII Leave him now quiet by the way] Leave him now quiet by the way To rest apart. I know what draws him to the dust alway And churns him in the builder's lime: He has the fright of time. I heard it knocking in his breast A minute since; His human eyes did wince, He stubborned like the massive slaughter beast And as a thing o'erwhelmed with sound Stood bolted to the ground. Leave him, for rest alone can cure— If cure there be— This waif upon the sea. He is of those who slanted the great door And listened—wretched little lad— To what they said. [1903] XXIX AN ATHENIAN GARDEN The burned and dusty garden said: “My leaves are echoes, and thy earth Is packed with footsteps of the dead. “The strength of spring-time brought to birth Some needles on the crooked fir,— A rose, a laurel—little worth. “Come here, ye dreaming souls that err Among the immortals of the grave: My summer is your sepulchre. “On earth what darker voices rave Than now this sea-breeze, driving dust And whirling radiance wave on wave, “With lulls so fearful thro' the gust That on the shapeless flower-bed Like timber splits the yellow crust. “O thirsty, thirsty are the dead, Still thirsty, ever unallayed. Where is no water, bring no bread.” I then had almost answer made, When round the path in pleasure drew Three golden children to the shade. They stirred the dust with pail and hoe. Then did the littlest from his fears Come up and with his eyes of blue Give me some berries seriously. And as he turned to his brother, I Looked after him thro' happy tears. [1903] XXX SONNETS FROM GREECE [1903] SUNIUM These are the strings of the Ægean lyre Across the sky and sea in glory hung: Columns of white thro' which the wind has flung The clouds and stars, and drawn the rain and fire. Their flutings now to fill the notes' desire Are strained and dubious, yet in music young They cast their full-blown answer far along To where in sea the island hills expire. How bravely from the quarry's earthen gloom In snow they rose amid the blue to stand Melodious and alone on Sunium! They shall not wither back into the land. The sun that harps them with his golden hand Doth slowly with his hand of gold consume. MT. LYKAION Alone on Lykaion since man hath been Stand on the height two columns, where at rest Two eagles hewn of gold sit looking East Forever; and the sun goes up between. Far down around the mountain's oval green An order keeps the falling stones abreast. Below within the chaos last and least A river like a curl of light is seen. Beyond the river lies the even sea, Beyond the sea another ghost of sky,— O God, support the sickness of my eye Lest the far space and long antiquity Suck out my heart, and on this awful ground The great wind kill my little shell with sound. NEAR HELIKON By such an all-embalming summer day As sweetens now among the mountain pines Down to the cornland yonder and the vines, To where the sky and sea are mixed in gray, How do all things together take their way Harmonious to the harvest, bringing wines And bread and light and whatsoe'er combines In the large wreath to make it round and gay. To me my troubled life doth now appear Like scarce distinguishable summits hung Around the blue horizon: places where Not even a traveller purposeth to steer,— Whereof a migrant bird in passing sung, And the girl closed her window not to hear. ELEUSIS Here for a thousand years processional Winding around the Eleusinian bay, The world with drooping eyes has made her way By stair and portal to the sombre Hall. As then the litanies antiphonal Obscurely through the pillars sang away, It dawned, and in the shaft of sudden day Demeter smiling gave her bread to all. They drew as waves out of a twilight main, Long genuflecting multitudes, to feed With God upon the sacramental grain. And lo, the temple veil was rent in twain; But thro' the rift their choirs in silver train Still passing out rehearsed the human creed. MT. IDA I I long desired to see, I now have seen. Yonder the heavenly everlasting bride Draws the white shadows to her virgin side, Ida, whom long ago God made his Queen. The daylight weakens to a fearful sheen; The mountains slumber seaward sanctified, And cloudy shafts of bluish vapour hide The places where a sky and world have been. O Ida, snowy bride that God espoused Unto that day that never wholly is, Whiten thou the horizon of my eyes, That when the momentary sea aroused Flows up in earthquake, still thou mayest rise Sacred above the quivering Cyclades. II Art thou still veiled, and ne'er before my sight At sunset, as I yearn to see thee most, Wilt thou appear in crimson robes and lost, Aloft the crystal vapours of the night? Is it the rule of all things infinite To trail across remoteness and in clouds The glory of their sacerdotal shrouds, And shade with evening their eternal light? O travellers abroad the mortal plain On weary beasts of burden overta'en By the unspeakable hours, I say: Press on. For tho' a little part be hardly seen, Hope spangles out the rest, and while ye strain Another cloud already, look, is gone. III As now my ship at midday passes out Into the lonely circles of the sea, Thou o'er thy southern island loftily Vague in the light appearest like a thought. Over the blazing waves my vessel caught Continues more into infinity: And, as adoring I look after thee, My eyes see white and in thy place is nought. In the decline and speed of human things When time drags on the dreamer by the hand Like an unwilling child and reprobate, It is enough if on the parting sings The certain voice he could not understand— It is enough, it is not yet too late. XXXI SIX O'CLOCK Now burst above the city's cold twilight The piercing whistles and the tower-clocks: For day is done. Along the frozen docks The workmen set their ragged shirts aright. Thro' factory doors a stream of dingy light Follows the scrimmage as it quickly flocks To hut and home among the snow's gray blocks.— I love you, human labourers. Good-night! Good-night to all the blackened arms that ache! Good-night to every sick and sweated brow, To the poor girl that strength and love forsake, To the poor boy who can no more! I vow The victim soon shall shudder at the stake And fall in blood: we bring him even now. [1903] XXXII IN A CITY GARDEN How strange that here is nothing as it was! The sward is young and new, The sod there shapes a different mass, The random trees stand other than I knew. No, here the Past has left no residue, No aftermath! By a new path The workmen homeward in the city twilight pass. Yet was this willow here. It hung as now its olive skeins aloft Into the sky, then blue and clear,— And yonder pair of poplar trees Rose also, soft And sibilant in the glory of the breeze. It's early dark. One scarce distinguishes Their sullen feathering in the autumn sky. 'T is warm and still. Dull o'er the town the vapours lie. Innumerable And dodging the uncertain stare, The small, shrewd lampions dot the air. Many like me Loiter perhaps as I in after years, As looking here to see Some vestige of the living that was theirs, Some trace of yesterday, Some hint or remnant, echo, clue—some thing, Some very little thing of what was they. Sure such are near! Else were it not so still This evening, So human-still and warm and kind. 'T is as of many moved In unison of will and mind to sing Low litanies to that which they had wholly loved. How sweet it is Under the perishable trees To hear the wings of the one human soul Fluttering up In Time's dark branches to the lucid stars. More than Despair is Hope, And more than Hope is the Hope that despairs, And more than all Is Love that disbelieves the real years. Here in this place One August morning—when the earlier crowd, Showmen or populace, From many a region and of curious face, Abroad the holiday Quaint in the sun with garb and gesture glowed, And, speaking grave or gay The various accent of their lonely race, Between the shadowy gold bazars idled away— She, as a cloud All sunrise-coloured and alone, Thro' the blue summer trembling came to me. I dried her tears and here we sat us down. Little by little, as tripping oversea On flame-tipped waves the daylight's long surprise Sweeps world and heaven in one, So love across our eyes Broke with the sun. Happy we walked away. The fairy sight Untangling shook a thousand chequered fires. Low under scarlet awnings rung on rung, Copper and bronze and azurite, Ranged on the sagging wires The trifles clinked in the red light. From beam and niche vendors in strange attires, Slipping dark hands along, Unhooked the quiet wool, the gaudy chintz, Or, precious where it hung, Long fluid jewels of auroral silk: And dryly to the sense Their attars old and dusty powders clung. Still passed the weavers and the dyers Many a jar, a bowl Turned as of water or of milk— Glazen and jade and porcelain— Far down the shadows colouring stole. As one had shook a jungle after rain And basketing the drops at random spilled Their red and green, their topaz and sapphires, All were here piled.— And wandering out we smiled To see across the glowing noon so high, So high and far, The incandescent minarets and domes and spires Lifting the fusion of their coloured choirs To the sky Softly—save only where A flag or pennant fallen slack Shotted the dazzling air. I came to-day to find her, I came back Humble with sweet desires Across this dun September atmosphere To her. I came, I knew she was not here: Now let me go. I came, I come because I love her so. Not in the acres of the Soul Does Nature drive the ploughshare of her change. It is not strange That here in part and whole The faithful eye sees all things as before. For past the newer flowers, Above the recent trees and clouds come o'er, Love finds the other hours Once more. [1904] IV A DRAMATIC SCENE [1904] Scene: The living room of the Cellini house in Via C?, Florence. A crackling fire of oak-sticks in the hearth. GIOVANNI CELLINI seated, and his daughter COSA spinning; later his son BENVENUTO. GIOVANNI. Has he come? COSA. Not yet. GIOV. The Campanile Told seven awhile ago. COSA. He'll soon return. No doubt Marchone is hurried, works him hard, Or a late client rich and particular Puts them to trouble. GIOV. No, Cosa, 't is not that, Or if maybe to-day, not every day; For every day he lingers and retards. He shuns our fireside, he no more clings to Our tedious home that loves him all too well,— Headstrong and hard and haughty! Why even me, Me that begot him, poor old father, me He hates. COSA. Father! GIOV. Deny't! COSA. I do, I do. GIOV. Why then can't he at evening, since he knows— I taught him—so deliciously to run The flute's heart-breaking scale, so tenderly To use the grief of yonder clarinet— Why does he grudge me? Oft in after time These rough refusals and discourtesy Cry down the winds of thought, and one by one In sobs before our parents' grave, we rue Our sordid sweetness. COSA. No, sir, no! forgive him. He 's rough, is Benvenuto, and in nothing Would pain you. GIOV. Why then refuse me so to play? I'm old and cannot—“agèd and unfit,” So reads the act. O Cosa, 't was a stroke When first I read it—I carry 't always—here, Here 't is! we'll read it over again once more: “Whereas “Giovanni of the Cellini, one “O' the tibiccus or fifes to said republic, “Is agèd and unfit for playing, and “On his age's account can hardly come “And every day appear to play and do “Service to said republic as required, “Therefore “They have deliberated”— Here, Cosa, read! The words become too long for my old eyes. COSA. Sir, you forget: I cannot read. GIOV. Well then! “Deliberated and in deliberation “Have carried and have all in all removed “The aforesaid Giovanni of the Cellini”— Why do they say, I wonder, all in all? “From his said office of tibiccu or fife “To said most high and honourable Lords. “And because said Giovanni is poor and old, “And has in their said palace service done “Years six and thirty well and faithfully, “Wishing therefor him somewhat to repay “And tend his age and some support provide, “Therefore have they decreed to same Giovanni “The pension alms 't is usual to give “Players of their said palace: pounds, to wit, “Eight, of the little florins, every month “During the said Giovanni's life.” I'm old, And like mine unrequired melody, My part is over. COSA. A step—he's coming—now— It dies away. GIOV. Yet he detests the flute! Old as I am and poor, 't were a good life, Tho' hard the wages, if at ending day Good music by the candle sat—and his Outsings by far Italy's loveliest. I taught him: down upon the stops myself I held his baby fingers. I'd divined The perfect flutist in him, the lip and hands, And stars of music in his big blue eyes. This drawing he potters o'er at weary night, Of groups and visionary postures framed In scroll-work, while his feverish brain upreared Hammer and tongs descends upon the ore; This love of metals and design of forms— You think him sculptor? COSA. Why, father, they say— GIOV. They say and push his obstination. It happens oft our children misconceive Their proper genius, and how much soe'er We pull their error back to the good road, They clench the bit and bolt. He 's a musician. COSA. Yet in his fever—scarce he 's now recovered— Whene'er you spoke of music, how the pulse Grew flurried! You remember! spare him. GIOV. Sure I urge him to himself. He's a musician, And proved it well, when in the Palace Hall, We fifemen playing before the Signoria, My little man was hoisted to the book, And straddle upon the velvet shoulders of The page-at-arms, his treble played away. COSA. He was eleven. GIOV. Ten, Cosa, ten—or nine, But ten I swear to. COSA. All Florence rang of him. GIOV. O what a day when the organ pipes I made— So full of angels that in recompense Placed at Magnificent Lorenzo's word On rushing wings they came tremendous down Santa Maria Novella—how there they sang On Benvenuto's baptism like a choir! COSA. Sir, played they at mine? GIOV. Come, daughter, in my arms. In you they play forever. I love to hear An organ's fluttering base, a languid lute; To hear the watered silver of a harp Pass off in shower throughout the melody; To hear a viol weeping—Cosa, I brought Some old sticks homeward yesterday from work: Go fetch them, from my closet, bundled in My blouse. [Exit COSA.] The master-mason said to-day I was too old, clumsy my work. Alas, And Benvenuto of the goldsmith earns Half what he might at music. [Enter COSA.] COSA. I cannot find them, And in the closet is nothing, Sir, but clothes. GIOV. Lost then perhaps—but no! Still gainst my side I feel them pinch; for weary 't is, the way Thro' fallow fields from San Domenico. I got them home! among them a certain piece Of grain and fibre, and, by my knuckle rapped, so true! Lost, no! impossible, for I hid them safe— Good Jesus, by the chimney, Cosa, there— [He gets up from his chair and they both kneel down, sorting the rubbish.] Some of them in the firewood! Where 's my piece? COSA. Let me do 't, father. GIOV. Ai, my old back and knees! Where is my piece? the candle! O Virgin Mary, It 's lost. COSA. Here 's more of them. GIOV. Yet not the one. COSA. Another. GIOV. Show me. COSA. Look, Sir. GIOV. Love, 't is found, It is my piece, for sure, it is my piece. Your mother, Cosa, is thrifty and virtuous, Good housewife, clean and good, so very good,— But for the arts her talent and regard Were ever small.—Up, help me, daughter! up! [He gets back to his chair and sits whittling and singing snatches, while COSA resumes her spinning.] My chair, and from the table drawer find me My jackknife. Look, betimes this wretched board In growing modulations will become Half a viola, and well Luigi said That such are music's silkworms. COSA [aside]. Benvenuto 's Uncommon late. He'll not come back to-night. GIOV. She lingered by the river-bed, Dropped on a knee to levy The swimming pitcher to her head. Oh it was heavy! The eyes of love are soon to fill And quick is the breast to quiver. A star hung over the olive-hill. She said to me: “Never.” In Campo Santo lives a grave I and the moon together— I and the moon together— I and the— 'T is always so: the memory of a song First weakens at the end and the poor singer Rushing the climax like a stormy bird Feels for his voice and hears it die away. As, Cosa, you were saying— COSA. I? Nothing, Sir. GIOV. Purple anemone, Why should the sunrise April morn Gild and bedew thy petal torn? My voice has much gone off, and by degrees The mellow sureness of its register Is shaken nearly all. I'll sing no more; And then the viol throughout my merry life I used and cannot play—the absent viol Quite leaves the singer homesick and destroys The foliage by the river of his theme. I waited— [To himself.] This timber lost—'t was pity pitiful. I waited for her near her farm Close up beside a cypress tree. The road lay white as linen by, And moonlight made the meadow warm. She came, and as she came the air Against her laid her veil and dress. I held my brow for giddiness, My hands for fever. She was there. She put her finger to her mouth And down thro' olives led the way. I followed while the bird of May Sang down the branches on her youth. Along the glade of dewy dark I breathed her, she had gone before. I ran, I heard a shutting door; And soon the farm-dogs ceased to bark.— Go, silly heart, and let me be. The wind will show you round the hill; Far down, the river turns a mill, They say beyond it is all sea. Go where you will, go where you please. What should I care? My heart is burned.— Ah, God, if only she returned! I 'd cry for pardon on my knees. [A noise is heard on the stair.] COSA. It 's he.— [Enter BENVENUTO.] God, brother, how you 're ruffled, torn! Across your forehead— BENVENUTO. Hush! give me a dish— Beans, mush—What have you? I'm hungry. GIOV. But, my son, Your forehead's— BEN. Scratched, Sir: nothing. Let me be. GIOV. Cosa, give him a soup. You 're bleeding, boy. Cosa, a sponge. What was 't? BEN. I said, Sir, nothing. GIOV. A scuffle? BEN. No. GIOV. Come tell me. BEN. What? GIOV. You fought— BEN. Why, yes, I fought. What of 't? GIOV. With whom, I say? BEN. With Piero Torregiani. GIOV. Him? What for? BEN. For nothing. GIOV. Come— BEN. Why— GIOV. Come, you quarrelled: why? BEN. He scoffed— GIOV. At you. BEN. No, not at me. GIOV. Not you? Who then? BEN. He jeered at Michael Angelo. GIOV. God help us! fight for Michael Angelo! He 's mad. BEN. Give me my soup. GIOV. How happened it? A son who in the lanes of Florence walks With boiling fist for Angelo, who, gorged With Papal florins, grandly lives in Rome! What was 't that Piero said? What was 't? BEN. He said— No, no, enough, I'm sick of 't. Let me be. I'm mad, you say, Sir: let me grind alone And turn my knuckles in the granite. Yes, He scoffed at Michael Angelo, and I Nailed him a crash between his yellow eyes. GIOV. But why? why, Benvenuto? COSA. Brother, here 's Your pot of soup; and now the water 's warm I'll sponge your bloody forehead. Sit you down— Come quietly, now come and tell us. BEN. Well, We walked, Piero and I—I hate the man And smell him like a pestilence—I walked Down Via Larga, where from the Palace I With certain drawings came.—No, I've enough. COSA. And then— BEN. And there the splendid man, Tall, beautiful, and under shaggy brows A flash he clips with blinking—you 'd have said A soldier, not a sculptor, but he carves For them in England, and is now returned To catch some poor Italian prentices For export—me he baited, for a time, But he'll return without, if he return. GIOV. He 's dead? BEN. I wish so—only a little more— COSA. On Via Larga—come— BEN. He met me, and “That scroll there,” asked the glory of his voice, “Are drawings?” “So,” said I; and he, “What of?” I pulled him to the Duomo steps.—You know 'T was given out a fresco be designed For the Palazzo Vecchio, picturing How Pisa was besieged by Florentines. And master Leonardo worked to purpose: Before the walls and puffing sky of cloud A skirmish thrills the plain—hot work and high; The horses rear, the riders shining up To lunge with sword or battleaxe; one down, Another falling, all constrained and each Alive,—with certain seizure and defence Of gonfalons afloat on tufted plumes As ravishes the sight. GIOV. I saw the thing, I was a draughtsman once. It is an art— COSA. Was there another? BEN. Michael Angelo's. A human hand can cast no further. It is a summer's day, and Arno lies Languid throughout the picture. In it bathe A pack of footsoldiers which on the instant Hear an alarm: the swimming strain for shore, Some with uneasy arms are wading, others fall Or splashing catch pieces of jutting turf, While clear upon the bank the nimble ones Run swift and naked to repairs of armour And weapons stacked in file over the plain. Such grouped and quick variety! So full, Muscular and harmonious! Such relief Of flesh and surface! It enlarged my eyes With wonder and my brain with ecstasy.— Bread, Cosa, and another flask of wine. GIOV. Was this your brawl with Piero? BEN. Good father, I'd copied this design of Buonarroti's, And to Piero unrolled my drawing. He With puckered nose said, looking: “Michael was “My schoolmate: we together learned to draw “Of Fra Filippo in the Carmine. “He has a nose remembers me! He used “To hawk and whistle at our scrawls, to say: “‘Your hero 'd best keep seated or his thighs “‘Would, one jostle his heart, the other pull “‘His hip-bone to the knee;’ or ‘Cupid there “‘High up weighs fifty tons: if he should fall “‘O woe unto the dwellers of the plain!’ “‘One day I stomached him no more. He peered “Over me at my board: ‘That spider-web’— “I'd drawn a woman running. At the word, “Sprung up I shot my knuckles at his nose. “Consult it for my aim.” He snickered, but Inside my brain it swam like fumes of hell. I leaned into his face and shouted: “Cur, “You broke it?” “Little boy,” he said. We fought. 'T was ugly doing. I caught him full, tho', when He fumbled for his knife; but from the crowd That screamed and thickened round us, certain friends O'erpowering shouldered him delirious home. He fought me well. COSA. You're wounded, brother? BEN. No. The scurvy fool! the braggart! I'd as lief See adders rear out of my folded arms As that man's face again. GIOV. This for my son! BEN. But I was hungry! There, I've eat enough! Cosa, give me my board and pencils. 'T should be late And father's bed-time. [COSA gets him his drawing tools. BENVENUTO then works at the table while GIOVANNI goes on whittling and humming.] GIOV. At the jeweller Marchoni's, any work in prospect? BEN. Much. And of myself a buckle in good gold Is ordered. I've a posture in my eyes Of Sirens interlaced with golden scales Roughing a silver ground. Leave me alone. This candle gutters. GIOV. Son, do you remember The ending of the song—for I forget: In Campo Santo is a grave I and the moon together— I hear the rest, but like an echo, gone— Or going from the gateways of my voice. BEN. [sings]. In Campo Santo is a grave Where I and the moon together Go linger oft and cannot leave Tho' dawn be in the weather. Oh, let me hold her in my arms. Cold tho' she be, there let her languish. Only her kiss of death can warm The snow-fields of my anguish. GIOV. [aside]. That voice and singing! BEN. How supple is the strength That coils the rondure of a Siren's tail! It lies within the fine imagination Of them of old to shape their legend so That monsters have position in the realm Of strict anatomy and reasoned things.— The frame is square. GIOV. [looks at him for a while in silence and then says:] O my beloved son! I was a hand at draughting, I have worked At stone and trowel all these many years— Hard work, to give my little children bread. Then, in repayment of my weariness, To freshen the fatigue, that day by day Added at last now makes me an old man— For see, my tenor quavers and my hand Can't steer the knife to purpose on this wood— The master-mason said to-day my work Was bad and he 'd employ my age no more— I laboured most for you: then promise me You'll not forget and still practise sometimes The flute I played at evening for repose And taught you with my love in weariness. I loved you, taught you, gave you all myself. Music and singing were my joy, and you Were to be my musician; but you turned To another art—rightly, I say not no, But yet remember music—let me hear The crying of thy mellow flute once more, Or sing to me as always thou hast sung Since when I showed thee how upon my knee. COSA [to BENVENUTO]. Love, humour him. BEN. I will not. GIOV. Benvenuto, It is not much to give thy father back A fluteful of his breath, to tender him Across the early morning of thy voice A song's worth of delicious gaiety. You know not—you cannot know— You know not what it is to hear aloud Within the walls of age and poverty Your singing child, alive, alert, and full Of small perfections in the art you love. We artisans are jealous, and to give The secret of our art is to give all. I gave you all my music—play to me As only you can play—a little now, For you and music are my evening-stars. COSA. Brother! BEN. Take off your arms. GIOV. Then let it be. COSA. He 's crying. BEN. Let him. COSA. Madonna, pardon him! GIOV. Well then, to bed. Good-night. BEN. [to COSA]. Give me my flute, Give me the cursed thing; you know the words. COSA [aside]. He might have asked some other song of me! When first my eyes there, in the shadow of the meadow, saw my God, Like the lightning, thin and narrow, ran the arrow thro' my blood. Tho' I struggled, yet I could not, yet I would not look away, Asked his mercy to accept me or reject me, as he say. I gave him nothing, tho' what could I of my duty give him more? Gave him little tho' I suffered all I offered at his door; I gave him nothing freely, fully, for 't was all I was or had, Gave him every thought and breath and life and death and wine and bread. O Virgin Mary, in the awaking of the breaking Day of pain, If he's tired, let him rest and me be questioned for us twain. O let me save him, earn his blessing, me redress him in the sod. Love can smother hell and hover with her lover up to God. BEN. There! GIOV. O bless you, dear musician! That 's my son. What sound—you noticed, Cosa—tempered with Sweet doubts and sweeter hurries. As I fall From agèd weariness away to sleep, Your smooth and sad cadenzas, Benvenuto, Will star my dreams. BEN. Good-night, Sir; Cosa, good-night. [Exeunt GIOVANNI and COSA.] This fluid music clouds me with a slag. I cannot see. My fluttering head and hand No more are with the metals, and the lines Go one into the other like threads of wool. Among the many arts the lowest much Is music: which with pitiable means Is scraped and blown and twanged and—no one knows How or what for. O curse on 't. To work. I can't—must—will. GIOV. [looks in at the door in his nightgown]. That song, another time, Not quite so fast, and your beginning notes Less sudden and attacked with subtler breath. [Exit GIOVANNI.] BEN. If e'er I play again! He pushes me So every evening to the rack. Great God, The very rhythm of my design is snapped At the root short-off, just at the noble moment When dream and comprehension fuse in one. I'll wreck my greatness here, only to please My father's whim. It stings patience. I—yes— And here over my ruined vision, I Writhe like a scorpion in a ring of fire. Florence is not for me. I will abroad And slake my rankling thirst for the great world, For liberty, myself and what I am: Enough! At dawn to-morrow off for Rome. V JUVENILIA I ART IN MAN I heard a strange philosophy, which taught The Art is Man, the Artist is his Art; That Poetry lives fleshly in the heart Of poets, and mechanic in their thought. And then, as oft before some ruined shrine I have seen the pious man stand awed and pale, So I, to see my heart's ideal trail In dust and grey in ashes, once divine. Yet came the Spring, and o'er the fleetness ran A breath of song, a subtle fire, a life, A voice: Say not the sum of things is man; For like the wave-rolled spiral shell is he, Wherein a vaster voice rings rich and rife— A shadowy murmur of the parent sea. [1892] II MUSIC The air breaks into flutters low and sweet, Smooth as the liquid passage of the bird; And as the ocean-murmur, faintly heard Before the storm, its rippling echoes beat The ear. But then with swifter, bolder feet The message comes; the music stirs the heart To wild pulsations, until every part Is glowing, fervid with a throbbing heat. Slowly the memories of the past then rise In pallid glory; richer streams of sound, Wild with mysterious truth, all cloudlike, roll About the heart and flood with tears the eyes: But then a silence, stern, abrupt, profound: A vaster echo trembles in the soul! [1892] III NIGHT Great night! no soothing friend to pain thou art, Whereto a stricken soul may pour its grief. To thee these human sorrows be too brief To wake the pulse of thine eternal heart. Thy powers are dead; and sterner peace impart The silences of thy vast eloquence. Our reason fails; our minds succumb, too tense To act; ourselves grow fragile, part by part. So when thy pale infinitudes unfold Their vastness, and th' eternal harmonies, Threading their labyrinthine paths of gold, Break on the vision with a sudden sting, The soul is loosed, and in the boundless skies A dazzling light uprises on her wing. [1892] IV EVENING A STUDY IN METRE Summer is sweet, In the air of the tepid night, In the drowsy breeze, In the blossoming trees;— Summer is sweet With its scented heat And the lazy hours that ease Every heart From the toil of the day's hot light And ceaseless throes, With their pale repose. Every heart Sips of its part Of the love that summer bestows. Laggard and sweet, The evening glides on its way; And the glistening star From the eastern bar, Laggard and sweet, With golden feet, Climbs stilly the skies from afar. Liquid and light, A tremulous harmony sings O'er the sleepy guitar Its reverberate bar, Liquid and light, To the moon-paled night, And the love of the glistening star. Heavy perfumes From the vine that grows, clambering still, Wondrous and fair On the trellis' tall stair,— Heavy perfumes, Through the moonlit glooms, Drift away from her purple hair. Night rustles late Through the trees with a measured tread; And the late, late word Have the gold stars heard; Night rustles late To the eastern gate, By the goad of the east-light spurred. Swift are the hours Now sped on their dusk-feathered wing To the land of the west, To the land of their rest; Swift are the hours O'er the dew-sprent flowers Away, by the grey dawn pressed! Slower and slower Dies the song of the low-voiced guitar; Like the bend of a stream, The whole to a dream, Slower and slow, With a silvery flow Ebbs away. ... Away, while slow To the fields of the poppies of sleep I wander, I tread In the maze of their bed Away, while slow And deep and low In their peace I lay my head. [1892] V AGE AND YOUTH Spare whitened hair, a withered cheek, A trembling voice, a fireless eye,— Do these show Age's victory? I deem it truer that the man, Whose frame is now more fragile grown, Is younger than the child new-born. For he who enters life's long road Is old with duties yet to be And white with long expectancy; Yet as the years roll slowly by, As dross that leaves the vessel bright, His duties fall away. The light Of freer manhood makes him young And younger, till, those duties past, He stands in perfect youth at last. Thus grow we younger toward the grave, That finds us in our fulness free, And on the brink of which we see Close 'round us some such light as shone On Man and Nature's virgin dawn, Grey years ago, ere Sin was born. [1892] [VI This is the nursling of an hundred years] This is the nursling of an hundred years. Save this the horny cactus cannot bloom, That heeds not if the violets shed perfume, The roses blow, the August swell the ears Of corn, or the dull wintry silence nears. But ah! how shorn is all the garden-room Of beauty! Flowers and shrubbery dropped in gloom, The fountain lost in everlasting tears. Thou, stranger, art too late—too late for home, Tho' Time and Hope conspired to give thee life. And shalt thou live, where thro' the sultry air Death reigns and all malignant harms are rife? Or shall thy trust not rather be a snare To lure thy tardy beauty to its doom? [1893] [VII Tho', moored along the quiet quay on some] Tho', moored along the quiet quay on some Errand of commerce bent, she rides at rest, Her title, half-obliterate at the crest, Speaks the soft language of a distant home. Her time shall be, and she invite the foam About her prow, the winds to blow the West Open,—and all her hopes move forward, blest And favoured 'neath the Heaven's unclouded dome So whilst this life of duties we discharge, Chained to the moorings of a mortal thought, The inspiring evening calls us from the marge. Hail, star and wind and current! Sunset, hail! Away, for firmly here the helm is caught, And the new moon hangs in the homeward sail. [1893] VIII THE DEATH OF AISCHYLOS (A HEADLAND NEAR SYRACUSE. WILD STORM) The wind walks wildly in the trees to-night. I feel mine age. Like this Sikelian day From gold faded to Erebos, so I; My triumphs like clouds I gather round me, and Sink now. The travail of the storm-scourged sea, The windy rack, the thunder's vivid leap Where the slit-lightnings ope their ghastly lips,— It merges all, and from ten thousand worlds, Sucked in the caves by slimy shores, I hear Only the windy sough of Acheron! There 's storm in heaven, the wroth gods threaten war, And Zeus in agony hurls on the impotent world His foamy spleen. Our 'lated end has come, Tho' the Earth start up Promethean to rebel; She shudders, and her bowels, gouged and rent By the fell tempest's horns, shall lie like dust Distracted thro' the oblivious universe. The Erinys range abroad: of old they worked On men—thieves, liars, adulterers, parricides, The horde of crime; on nations—Lydian wealth And Persia's loud-mouthed greed; to-day, the world! For there are world's Erinys even as men's, And on her bloody track they follow. Now the worlds, Hellas and all that is not Hellas, pay. ... Hellas—Athenai! By the immortal gods, Athenai, thou shalt die. Like some light girl She shook her tresses to the Ægean wind, Where on the listless shore playing she dipped Her pink foot in the foam-hemmed sea and smiled. Wet were her asking eyes; and fresh her arms, Rhythmic with dull repose; her naked side Quivered, touched by the feathery wind,—O Zeus! Lustful and fickle! From the unvenged dead Helen is come, and fronting Salamis Takes up her fatal dwelling! Thou 'dst not hear My sober voice. The rigid days are gone. Virtue, austere and pale, is gone. Thou list'st The wanton poet; thou lov'st the unmanly plays, The gilded talkers; lapp'st thy youth in vice, Musics lascivious, vile philosophies; Hugg'st in thy warm embrace the ignobly born, Slaves, and slaves' children come from barbarous loins; Fooled by a trinket, lazy, irreverent Of all the gods; and scorn'st with ribald lips The eternal prophesies. Athenai! aye, Heinous indeed is thine unending crime, And in thy fresh girl's side the serpent sword Churns thy red life blood into black, stark death! Zeus, bear me hence! Forefend my scanty hair, Blessed with the endless kisses of the Muse, Should clot with dust of earth. Forefend my lips, Withered with singing too sublime a song, Should eat vileness; these eyes, now pale with age, Scorched with long searching of thy Heavens and shot That on the irradiate spasms of morning light Round thine Olympos fixed, should from their holes, Where stretched I lie, downward my livid face, Stare stark into the worm-begrovelled earth! Oh, bear me hence! Great Zeus, I cannot die, I cannot live. Oh, rend the impassioned storm, Pierce my huge breast with lightnings, strew my corpse Like ashes on the world-encircling stream! Shred me like fleeces, and dismembered lay Upon thine altar that is all the world. [A pause.] Athenai! How thou shamed'st me! me, ye gods! Who sweat and bled for liberty, threw my life Before thy feet and went to Marathon, By lordly Salamis' acanthine dawn Ploughed up the sea and in the furrows sowed Persians, a sterile crop! And if in song I picked His leavings, yet the Nine vouchsafed Some glory, by the gods, that yet shall wind Its clarion down the building aisles of time. Yet oh! the shame when to belittled singers Thou gav'st thy prize! Within mine ear yet crawls His voice, puny and weak, who grimed our Muse With the pale passions of the common day; Who danced by Victory's torchlight, glistening-limbed. His body wet with music, the ivies black Plaited in honey-hair, and his lithe skin Laughing with subtle fires of blood—a shame! And he rose up from the uninspirèd throng To win, to snatch thy prize, Melpomene. I had sung with all the voices of the world; Thunders I knew; the primal gods revealed Their forces, secrets; and I made them rise Out of the chaos of legend, stand and speak, Moving their shadow past our little life. Yet him, who figments of the ignoble day Made over into rhythms, him they preferred And crowned, the beardless Sophokles! And I Slunk homeward, soiled my brow, my better art Defaced.—O Zeus! too many, many days I have lived, beyond my setting striven to hold The sky, outlived myself. Fulfil thy vow! Remember! when I stood white-robed, black-locked, Beneath thine oaks, thy wind ran on the leaves And like a hurricane's song, thou swor'st: “Thy death Comes by my tortoise from my dog.” Then come! No fitter storm shall yelling hound this earth. Strike my thin breast—I bare it, supplicate A rending of my being; lo! here my head! Rack my dry skull and let me, let me die! [A long pause. He descries an eagle.] Ride, child of storm, ride master on thy gale. Feathers unshrivelled by the lightning, skim The wrathful breaker on Sikelia's shore. Like a black dream, thy frown slips thro' the night! Thy sprayed wings fan the windy black. He seeks The march. For prey? What miserable torn life Shall his clawed beak pierce?—Gone! Folded tonight! Fly on to Zeus, black bird, fly on, remote, And house thee in the abode of hurricanes— Stay, gods! great gods! Hither and hither still He flies. His stinging eye flames thro' the dusk. Away! His hooked mouth holds—away! How grim His stiff, iron feathers near me! Lightnings, blast His flight! ye gods, avert! How close he skims! O, shrivelling terror of the cloudy god, Be gone, black— [The tortoise falls on his head. He sinks to the ground.] Death. Alas! Alas! Alas! My prayer was heard! My brow clotted with wet— How comes it? Shattered by a fall of stone— Or—agonies! wild pain! horrible night! Mother, what wretchedness thy youth brought forth, My lot of crazèd suffering, exile, death! Stupours enshroud—gray morning, wilt thou ne'er Shudder into the East; gray dawn, of gray, Here is thy wonted throne Athenai, here; Quit thy bed, tangled in the Cyclades,— Gray dawn—dream—dulness—gray, gray, gray, how gray. Alas, what sick, slow pain—my brain! my brain! [He dies.] [1894] [IX My note is highest of them all] My note is highest of them all, And uppermost along the choir With tremors of my treble I call The mist of stars to point their fire, While nevermore my echoes fall Tho' silence hath an interval For love of order on the lyre. I am the Lady of the Scale; For all that moveth music is... The reasons of my note prevail Thro' pause and change of melodies; And singing down the endless gale I do command the fiery trail. Howe'er, my song is not of me. The sphere and circuit of each star Flashes that ... their degree, And storm their light with swell of war. The dragons of the auroral sea Taking their pleasure to be free Are yet divine and regular. [1894?] [X When you've averaged emotion, found where Nature goes to school] When you've averaged emotion, found where Nature goes to school, “After many years discovered” who God be and how he rule; Reckoned that Castalia's fountain ran a gallon to the hour,— Doubtless it and you shall dry. Another race will claim a dower. Lightly you have sold your meadow and the freedom of the lea, Sunlight-ripple and sea-burst, the winy air, the spumy sea, And the wreaths of land whose edge it lifting kisses; and the soul Of the stars in violet air that wrapt gold circles round the pole: Lightly sold your heart; forgotten passion, courage, pang and throe, Love the love and hate the hatred, keenly feel and largely do,— You that daub with gorgeous colours, hum the strenuous key that pearled With a nightingale's and Shakespeare's song the æon-withered world. Life is his that lives. By living, not by learning, may we learn. And a hand that grasps not life, is gathering ashes for its urn.— But a breathless race comes flooding from the portals of the sun. Richer dawns and larger days and wider evenings are begun. [1895] XI ODE Hills, mountains, lakes, farewell! Summits and snows; And thou, thou sunful air of Engadin; Gentian and daisy and bell, Where the wind blows; Yea, all thou Nature that mine eyes have seen: Farewell! Never again Shall we behold your archèd skies, Save when estranged by pain, With pale and old and other eyes. Here, to these sights, Enlaced about with human thought We came. A terror spelled us at the windy lights; Our breath grew lame And on this world our vision fell distraught. Too stinging near the sun! The space too utter large! the air Acrid so fine it was! Our beaten spirit, impotent to share, Became as glass Brittle and dead before the vision: We could our face but hide, Our arms about us for a pall; “Heaven has shattered us,” we cried and cried. Our ear dissolved; our voice quavered; and we were small. Yet the rich passage of the natural days Dragging their carmine webs and violet hems Over the flowered world; And all about unfurled The languid nets of evening dripping gems Thro' the low rays; With aftertrain of stars, Sober divinities and simple diadems! Where on your cars You move in circle to the tracks of day! Ye enfolded us and we did lose The little habit of the hour and way. We have seen— Above the fluid air, The effacèd languor of ravine And this long valley peopled as a lair With smoky forms— The morn's gray-lidded star Alone; We 've felt the storm's Approach, the rocks with echo jar; We 've heard as war Of world on world the moving glacier moan: Till to the brain The healing knowledge of eternal things, The sufferance of limit and the lore O' the world's serene adjustment quiet gave; Till we felt sorrow for the obedient star, Pity and patience for the taxèd moon And all this broil of universe that serves Its taskmaster; O, till it seemèd then Time was a noisy bellman, tiredly That rung in stellar deserts his dull bell Calling the planets home. A finished day! The orbèd meadow-land of solar gold Was waxen sterile and embrowned; a spell Had soon distilled the system to a drop, And of the whole destroyed One fiery globule wavered in the endless void.— So runs the dream about your height! So man may stand with open eye, A dying acolyte Amid your ceremonies that do not die; And hear, In sober and subduèd soul, Without fear The roll And tidal motion of the sacramental air. Farewell! again farewell! From where ye dwell We shall descend within the gentle plain,— There life is speakable: The while your train, In light of days that set not but still fare Upon the spirit's skies, More sober, more serene Shall rise, From all the things that were Apart, To that high backward of the heart Whereto the thought that travels ne'er hath wholly been. [1895] [XII 'T was yet an hour to dawn. Revengeful storm] 'T was yet an hour to dawn. Revengeful storm Tortured the Ægean air. The sea was high, And things of mist and water without form Rose, ran, were lost. The darkness swelled with cry. Then greatly heard, 'mid all that night's alarms Most hideous, was a sound of cities torn, Of glory strangled in an ocean's arms, Of death. The tempest sped;—and it was morn. From high Oliaros looking forth alone, The sculptor saw a sea with isles impearled,— But not yon island of the golden stone: Paros was sunk. A calm lay on the world. His frighted lip grew calm. He looked around. Never shone day more marvellous.—But he Swore to his heart an oath that had no sound, Darkly, and cast his chisel to the sea. [1895] XIII COLOGNE CATHEDRAL O earth, this is not earthly, nor of stone; Nor did thy bowels yield the stuff that made The pale gray roof whereunder light and shade Move undiurnal to the greater sun. Prayer carved the sable flowers; a choral spun Rose-windows in the aisle; and music stayed So silken-long by arch and colonnade That the lines trembled out and followed on. 'T is here philosopher and peasant sings In pauses of the mind, when thought and faith, The I and Thou, are bubbles of the breath;— From on the citadel of human things Sheer to God's sky, in life rather than death, The serfs with quiet eyes watch with the kings. [1895] [XIV When by you lies my broken heart, and I] When by you lies my broken heart, and I, Up on the hill where of this world is heard At most the love note of a vernal bird And breaking leaves that flutter in the sky; When nothing more of all this agony And strange disease that in our body stirred, Is left, and with mine ashes are interred My hope and name and all that I might be; If then one said it differed not, to live Or not to live, since living all is death, And seeing then, beyond the yews and grove, The fading fragments that our years did give, Should say 't were better never to feel breath, I answer, No. For life is less than love. [1895–96] [XV Now the lovely moon is wilted] Now the lovely moon is wilted, Lost her petals down the sky. Sorrily the wind goes by; Rosebuds where the branches tilted Yield their flowers with a sigh. June, the wonderment of blossom, With her necklace' thirsty pearls, With her tearful eyes and girl's Changing, ever changing bosom, With the hot sun in her curls— This is last of all the June-nights.— Let us softly speak of living, Thou whose life was but forgiving I that in the passèd moonlight's Shadow, moved thee with my grieving. Memory saddens our caresses. Feel, thy tired heart is cold, All the rich and devious gold Warm with shadow-waves, thy tresses, Surfeits with my kisses old. Long ago our love was broken. Habit poisons the embrace.— Yet, O changeless in thy grace, Speak the word thou oft hast spoken And the moon was on thy face. Kisses, loved one! All is ashen Thro' the life that lies before; Drink my glowing wine that o'er Hearts grown cold with vanished passion Kindles what was wild of yore. [1895–96] [XVI I know where all the singers hide] I know where all the singers hide And music wanders far along,— Down the steep rock and country side A mile of song; And sighs that the hazel sighed Mix and grow strong. There tired winds come home to say Their tale of acres bowed in flight, And streamless hollows where they lay. There shade and light All the delicious day Linger and light. Down sudden slips in turns and turns Aglitter, sings the rivulet; White bubbles float the little burns, And round are set Fringes of lucid ferns Fragile and wet. [1895–96] [XVII Hold still, my brain! My temples burst! Shall e'er] Hold still, my brain! My temples burst! Shall e'er This marble burgeon with her? I can see An Aphrodite, poised; a falling fold About her loins,—and nothing more but sky, Sky, sun, light, air, and rolling spheres, and men. Where is my chisel?—Paros is an isle Does make earth more magnificent than aught Of conquest. I believe it 's the old heart Of world and universe; were the quarry-slave Ambitious, he should find below, far, far Below, motion, life—and a regency So splendid as would shrivel him to ash. The splinters shine like gold! Away! Away,— Somewhere within here she,—Apollo, help! That I may bid her rise, and mix with stone My Phryne with the never-opened eye, The holy oval face, the rich long neck And serious body and—Oh the arms! the arms! My lips grow dull with kissing of her arms, Dull, yes! and sad! She shall be here eternally while I Make her eternal. I shall bid her come, Sit near, and say things in her golden Greek, And singing freshen some old mythos with Warm melody. I'll call her.—No! not yet! Not yet! Despair's enough without herself To make my heart at such comparison Break. Memory first shall guide my hand,— Memory made fresher by herself. Some eve We'll mix our water and wine; we'll chaplets Of ivy, sail for Athens, and in spring Hear the great plays and drink at festivals And run to some wild cry, some terrible Sharp song, away, away; the spotted skin Slips thro' the starlight; thyrsus at her throat Lengthened, and head thrown wildly back to see More rich the winy heaven dissolve and run! Where is she? Phryne! Phryne! Look, my love, Upon me and my marble. A snow more white Ne'er fell; with the influence and love of years We'll build an outline, thou and I, or thou Rather, that verily my lips and breast Will shudder but believe. Ah come away! We'll go and hear the music of the sea And pity the old singer; watch the moon, Sad harmonist on the unresponsive earth; Feel the far stars,—yet hear and watch and feel Nothing but thee, thou jewel of my soul! [1895–96] XVIII NIMIUM PASSUS If I could find three words to say My fill of hatred, I believe The affrighted earth would roll away And leave me here alone to live. They had some little gift to give, Some rank or ribbon to bestow. God knows, I asked not to receive,— They teased me, held me up for show. But, as I think, it 's blow for blow Before the throne of righteous Time. I have them yet, tho' right be slow And wrath needs age to grow sublime. Then, when the testament of earth Names one or other of us heir, I shall grow hideous with mirth, Curse them, and pluck them by the hair. [1896] [XIX Spring is come. From the wind lightly dissipate feathers of mist that an upland exhales] Spring is come. From the wind lightly dissipate feathers of mist that an upland exhales Whence in a glitter the soluble snows' tightened gray is in silver dissolved to the vales. Juices of sun-sweetened clay, that the broken seed cupped, press higher; and now shall unfold Milk-white curls whose secret of crimson the sun shall divide with his arrow of gold. Far over tremulous shrubbery glistens an ointment morning and April and sky, Bluer 's the gloom of the cypress, silverer the olives, and sweeter the poplar's cry. Till from a thousand hills that surround her, marvellous murmurs gathering sing As from round foam-chapleted oceans in circles of song growing single: Spring. [1897] XX IN AMPEZZO In days of summer let me go Up over fields, at afternoon, And, lying low against my stone On slopes the scythe has pain to mow, Look southward a long hour alone. For evening there is lovelier Than vision or enchanted tale: When wefts of yellow vapour pale, And green goes down to lavender On rosy cliffs, shutting the vale Whose smoke of violet forest seeks The steep and rock, where crimson crawls, And drenched with carmine fire their walls Go thinly smouldering to the peaks, High, while the sun now somewhere falls; Except a cloud-caught ochre spark In one last summit,—and away On lazy wings of mauve and gray, Away and near, like memory, dark Is bluish with the filmy day, What time the swallows flying few Over uncoloured fields become Small music thro' the shining dome; And sleepy leaves are feeling dew Above the crickets' under-hum, In bye-tone to a savage sound Of waters that with discord smite The frigid wind and lurking light, And swarm behind the gloom, and Down sleepy valleys to the night: And thoughts delicious of the whole, Gathering over all degrees, Yet sad for something more than these Across low meadow-lands of soul Grow large, like north-lights no one I care not if the painter wrought The tinted dream his spirit hid, When rich with sight he saw, amid A jarring world, one tone, and caught The colour passing to his lid. Be still, musician and thy choir! Where trumpets blare and the bow stings In symphony a thousand strings To cry of wood-wind and desire Of one impassioned voice that sings. Nay, silence have the poet's mode And southern vowels all! let die, So ghostly-vague, the northern cry!— This world is better than an ode And evening more than elegy.— Yet what shall singing do for me? How shall a verse be crimsoned o'er? I ever dream one art the more; I who did never paint would see The colour painters languish for, And wisely use the instruments That earlier harmony affords; I dream a poesy of chords Embroidered very rich in tints: 'T is not enough, this work of words. A wilder thing inflames our hearts. We do refuse to sift and share. For we would musically bear The burden of the gathered arts Together which divided were, And, passing Knowledge, highly rear Upon her iron architrave These airy images we rave,— Lest wholly vain and fallen sheer Our vision dress us for the grave. [1898] [XXI If, in the night and madness of thy mind] If, in the night and madness of thy mind, The tearing storm appear to thee a thing Lit sharply with thy hate and suffering,— A cause, a God, above the screaming wind; Or, when the sunlight infinitely kind Moves the meadow and mountain land to sing, Thou seem to see the glister of a wing— Know it is nothing, and thy eyeballs blind. Remember all this little humour of despair Wrongs the rich summer-time when summer is, And even so thy subtle ecstasies The winter hurricane and awful air. Fall down upon thy knees and lift thy eyes, That all things are forever as they were. [1899?] [XXII Henceforward I no longer shall be known] Henceforward I no longer shall be known Among you all, with whom I strove to dwell. For all our loves were wholly pitiable: I was a stranger, you were not my own. And over all I was I ring a knell, As a broad blasted landscape at sundown. I would not have the flames break from my frown Against you. I will go away,—Farewell!— Not as the Spaniard and his argosies Who ran greedily thro' the screaming sea Into the sunset after enterprise, But with dispassionate and quiet eyes Watching my destiny depart from me Like flushes in lotus after sunrise. [1900] XXIII A LETTER Your own sweet flowers are here to see: Crisp leaves, a sudden warm perfume And crumbling little blossoms, from Italy.— Pallanza in the bay I know, And Intra, and the point between. They scent the lilac, golden, green Afterglow I' the garden lying half-asleep, Where curious aloes feel the star Thro' webs of Indian deodar Tremble and weep. And so even now, tho' autumn 's wet And leaves about me falling fast, With you some plants and this at last Flower yet! They 've come to sadden here by me. Already every leaf is numb. 'T was yesterday they reached me from Italy! We 're like your flowers, you and I. Tho' years since I was—alien there, I feel I in this northern air Nearly die. Yet would you venture that the home, The peace that heals, the love that cures, Is mine in old Val d'Arno, yours, Say, in Rome? I ask. My novel has it so: I treat a travelling patriot In a sharp style. But—I'd forgot— You don't know! I was a singer then of scenes Where roses played a rôle. Enough! To-day I trade in prose and stuff Magazines. Sometimes I muster, to be sure, A rhyme, a manner, a technique; But all of me is, so to speak, Literature. ... For your sweet flowers—alas how vain! You see they made the echoes rise! “Only a moment” Age replies. Thanks again. [1901] [XXIV My life shall count by the smile and tear] My life shall count by the smile and tear, By the flash of blue in an eye I know. It's a world of time since June last year And a timeless world I am living now. One year ago! That we should have walked The very path we are walking now! And—tell me, do you remember?—talked Likewise one little year ago? Dear love, what a trick Time plays on us!— As tho' the hour and day could give A rule for passage! or all this fuss Of the sun be measure how long we live! Life is older than all the æons; And younger than any moment, youth. For aught that the earth go gathering seasons The fact o' the Spring is the world's best truth. XXV You'll say when here again after it all You'll say when here again after it all I recollect these things, that I devise, Like a poor devot in confessional, By saying aloud to make them otherwise, And with the thrust of that terrific guilt Grown soft and coward, to talk away the stain.— Not so—The wrong is done, the blood is spilt, I know it—if sense at all be in my brain. 'T is sorry homage, yes, and pitiful, After so long to bring before your eyes The frayed and dusty flowers of my soul With such belated show of sacrifice. XXVI This is the violin. If you remember— This is the violin. If you remember— One afternoon late, in the early days, One of those inconsolable December Twilights of city haze, You came to teach me how the hardened fingers Must drop and nail the music down, and how The sound then drags and nettled cries, then lingers After the dying bow.— For so all that could never be is given And flutters off these piteously thin Strings, till the night of a midsummer heaven Quivers ... a violin. I struggled, and alongside of a duty, A nagging everyday-long commonplace! I loved this hopeless exercise of beauty Like an allotted grace,— The changing scales and broken chords, the trying From sombre notes below to catch the mark, I have it all thro' my heart, I tell you, crying Childishly in the dark. VI FRAGMENTS [I The Autumn's done; they have the golden corn in] The Autumn's done; they have the golden corn in Clover and fern from either slope are gone, The peaks high up in the crystalline morning Glister of gray and roan. These pitiless two hours of midday hotter Than from the ? of a furnace, flare [Fourth word illegible.] The very shadows like a sunken water, Leaving but sunlight there, Till eve: and in the valley that expires A quick chill wind seizes the duskiness, While, on the summits lighting, sunset fires Kindle in Sorapis. One of these days I know, just as they sadden Spangling awhile the rose and yellow sky, You'll go away and watch the country gladden Softly to Italy. There, take this ring of gold—and when your fancy Glides by to songs under the autumn moon Where like unfurling silks of necromancy Lies out the white lagoon, Throw it away, that it be mine no longer. Italian, give it back to Italy, I will not have thy Past about me stronger Than what is yet to be. Nay, hurry home to sleep. The ferns are rigid With hoar, and dark and denser hangs the mist; It freezes and the stars quaver in frigid Heaven of amethyst. Down thro' San Vito and the land Cadore, To which—when closed the pestered city gate— The dying Titian strained, homeward from glory, Home from eternal fate; Down where the outlines have a softer meaning— Willow and clematis, the fruit and grain; And the last mountain height sinks greening Into the golden plain,— To Venice. There the October days purpureal Fall down to earth from Heaven wearily,— And wounded at the last, insatiate Uriel Dies on the flaming sea.— One of these days you'll leave me in the mountains, For I go Northward, not to see this year Gold Italy and her wind-silvered plantains, But there the sad and sere— I go elsewhere. ... [II She sat under the naked bough] She sat under the naked bough In an autumn moon's sharp shade, Her two hands clasped about her knee, And not a move she made. On crisp, dead leaves I walked to her And said, “Thou art the Morrow's Norn, And “Verily” she answered me, Lifting her eyes forlorn. Then with a slow and solemn sign I said “Be mine.” She shook her head, but her rimey hair Spread not upon the wind. And it froze me so to see her there, Till my own chilled heart grew kind; I touched her shoulder hard as stone, I pressed my hot lips to her eye, And wrapt my cloak about her, soft With a heart-warm sigh, Saying again with many a sign “Be ever mine.” She looked as when the spark goes out In ashes that all are dead. I left her, over the crisp dead leaves And quicklier too I sped, For I heard as out of a fold of wind While the white moon stood above the line 'Mid shadows moved like creeping coils Of a poisoned ivy vine, I heard ... [1895–96] III FRAGMENT OF AN ODE FOR GREEK LIBERTY Your enemy like startled fowl flies forth. Not by nice reckoning Of chance and odd, Nor martyrdom of meek repose Is reft from God The Laurel and the Rose. Nor matters it to bring Trophies home and a victor rod With blare of trumpets and caparison: It needs not to have won To be great. But the exulting soul Which strides alone against the sun, By his own passion hurled And slave to his desire's supreme control Is master of the world. Go out! To horse! Once more As ye were first— For they have sold All, bartered all, better and best, And to their richest guest, When the bargain 's o'er And they the counted utmost hold, They let out Liberty like any whore.— Brahma or Assur, Allah, Christ or Zeus, Or what strange name beside, Who is this God our sacrifice pursues? A shadow unrevealed Behind the circled sun he stands, Muffled in everlasting pride,— While with uplifted hands, Tho' harvests, hills and strands Frittered with use, The endless earth in ecstasy has kneeled. Who is this God our prayer pursues? Down the big night of time, On wings of ancient wind The gray smoke from a thousand altars rolls, And anthems cried by choired souls Immeasurably combined Crowd in the sky sublime.— Who is he? where? and may he be divined? And shall this ænigmatic Justice wake Upon their dreary end, Reckoning retribution for their pangs? Shall he beat heaven till it bend, And in this nation's fangs His barbed spear of yellow lightning break?— Or must their piteous wrong Of slaughtered men, women befouled And nurslings trampled in the mire, Hurl its terrific song, The crying measure of a last desire?— And get no more than when the dying lion growled Aye, should he rise, The master shrouded in our prayer, Girding his sacred loins About the vengeance that this world denies, He would change our air To golden sulphur solid as the sun, And rend the planet's groins With his curse, Till down the universe Made vagabond, Shattered and fragmentary and undone, The frail flame-wingèd embers should rehearse Our cataclysm to the great stars beyond. He shall not rise. Let hope in veils of pall This widely crimson morning close; The supreme warriors fall Where virtue first arose. Let no one weep the happy to repose [1897] [IV My Ludovico, it is sad] My Ludovico, it is sad! You 've caused your artist's soul to die. You 've starved the very heart. And why? It was no common heart you had. I don't say you were born above A world of worlds; to sit and scan In majesty Shakespearian The man of generations move. I don't say you were genius. No! But from your tender lips would fall Delicious things, and I recall One song that set my cheeks aglow. Why starve it?—What, pray, have you won? You, quick and subtle analyst, Would take the dearest flower and twist Its stem, and watch the juices run. I know we all are such, of course. It took some thousand thousand years To make a race that liked its tears And whetted the edges of remorse. But you, with such a soul to sing, A large and blue and quiet eye! I love you very little—I Who thought you prophet, priest and king. I wonder. Will the old world wake? Are we the people of the end? And shall the coming poets tend [V The weakened eyes regain their sight] The weakened eyes regain their sight, The fevered pulse grows slow and sure, Oh night, on thy sweet breast secure, My head is laid, is laid, oh night! [VI And I stood ringed about with marble dreams] And I stood ringed about with marble dreams, Motionless, white, but fashioned of thin shift, Silvery and lovely. Many a man was there, In feature perfect, and in posture calm, And all touched by the wand of harmony, Speaking from still lips memorable things. The light was dusk spun by the wizard hand Of evening from her distaff; and the air attuned With notes that lute-string never bare, nor viol Rendered to ease its heart. And thro' the land Swept the slow measure of a solemn wind, Laden with infinite murmurs, where the sea In voice distant and rhythmic told of powers Coiled in eternal slumber; far away Mounted and fell beneath the stooping heaven The hills, cadenced, subdued or sweetly plane, Yet most majestic, tempered with the soul Of age, nature, infinitude and sleep. And set alone in azure, like a tear Fallen in the veil of evening, silver pure, One star! [VII 'T is said that hearts are won, at length] 'T is said that hearts are won, at length! The glory is when hearts are lost. One loves once with a single strength, Or idly, cunningly almost. [VIII We learn by suffering and we teach by pity] We learn by suffering and we teach by pity. [IX I hear a river thro' the valley wander] I hear a river thro' the valley wander Whose water runs, the song alone remaining. A rainbow stands and summer passes under. [X Nay, take it all in all, the human sort] Nay, take it all in all, the human sort As well were sleeping as awake; they use Their small facility of common things, Assume the habit of their errors, and Believe their eyes and ears, like animals. [XI The passions that we fought with and subdued] The passions that we fought with and subdued Never quite die. In some maimed serpent's coil They lurk, ready to spring and vindicate That power was once our torture and our lord. [XII As one who loving beyond words will bring] As one who loving beyond words will bring The hue and perfumes of a common rose And trust a meadow's language to disclose The true simplicity of offering; Then, as he mutely gives his little, spring Obscure slow tears that she who studies knows Till in some deeper knowledge both repose And the old flower is now a useless thing. So ... [XIII Teased by the burden of this little sky] Teased by the burden of this little sky, Struggled and breaking thro' the azure dome Emerged, and looked upon the world of God. [XIV If with my life I lifted from thy head] If with my life I lifted from thy head Ever so little a while thy crown of thorn, And thou not sadly in thy hair hast worn These daisies of my trembling spirit bred; If, while I huddled back thy dreadful dead, Thou 'st happier listened to the birds at morn, I render sacred thanks to have been born, O my Madonna, dear and hallowèd. 'T is in my soul like midnight and high tide ... [XV The immortal mixes with mortality] The immortal mixes with mortality. The stars are drossed with sod, and yonder moon Which loved too long the dead Endymion, As any tiger-lily's petal, now Drops away, down the purple airs of night.— I do remember greater worlds than these, An earth less arrogant, and higher hills. Then rattled thunders from a thousand points; Night, suns, morning and wind; the criss-cross Of eagles in delirious passage cast Small shadows on the tempest-hunted cloud. And there were noises from untravelled shores. Now nature fills with waning. One by one Monster and centaur die, and weakening The lungs of Typhon lift a feeble smoke From horny-mantled craters by the sea. Alas! and we! indeed we somehow pass Within a fatal evening of ourselves. I feel a time-like tremor in my limbs. I know my beauty, and I understand Pleasure, to-morrow, yesterday, and love.— O had I one like him to gladden me. Yet would I be alone, for in my breasts I do believe the milk is not again. XVI FRAGMENT OF A DRAMA CALLED “THE CARDINAL PLAY” ANGELO. You're paler than your wont, my Lord. I pray Your sorrows for the church— CARDINAL. I 've other thoughts To-day, my son. You'll listen. Are we heard? ANG. Alone. CARD. The jeweller Veri had in 's care— Pray listen, for I'm tired—a pretty girl, Clean of our dirty age and marvellous In beauty, body, soul and maidenhood. To-day 's a week, he quit his workshop, came To bring me an ordered figure silver-carved I'd need of. 'T was some hour, I'd say two hours After the sunset. And, waiting to hear My approval of the long-belaboured work, He stayed awhile. But wandering home he found A window burst, and apprehending some Great loss of metals and I know not what, He rushed within—all safe—except—except Calling Lucia—that 's the girl's name—she Made not a sound of answer. Breaking in He finds her—gone—robbed—O my son—I say She 'd flown—and lay the bitter question—where? ANG. I fear, my Lord— CARD. I've more to say. He Two long days passed, to acquaint me. Me he came, For being professed protector of his work And knowing the noblemen who play such tricks Upon the—on peasant women—or I'd say On those below them. You, my son, are young And pass your youth among them. Here's my [illeg.] You'll find what villain—casually you'll search And ask, as speaking of indifferent things— You'll find me out this man, avenge me— ANG. Venge you, my Lord? CARD. Me, yes, as shielding Veri. ANG. My wits are dull, your pardon. Truth to say I had not thought to pay a jeweller's bills, And hold all Roman maidenheads in trust. Upon my word. CARD. My son, it suits you ill To refuse me. ANG. Your Grace be kind! Howe'er You'll grant it 's odd for Roman gentlemen To fight a tradesman's duels. CARD. I've said my wish Be pleased, consider all your life is mine, Your state and rank, your fortune— ANG. Sir, enough! The story 's this: one happy day you found A woman—noble, fair, we'll say, who liked I speak with reverence—you and all you were So things begin. The season comes, the day, Your youth is happy and she divinely dower'd With all one loves one great rich single time. I'm brief: the lady was my mother, you My father, and God's obscured will was done. We grow, we beings of your happiness, Goaded to life, and clothed and dressed and wrapped In the disease of long mortality. We breathe and grow: the cruel frequency Of year and hour is on us, and we learn Our birth was precious—but, well, casual. Yet we live on, and on necessity's Stern heart lay our ununderstanding heads. And we live on. Then comes a day, you 've thought At such time such a thing should so be done,— If not, you hound us out. Now, hear me God, It 's passing strange. A slave is fairly bought And cudgelled if the bargain 's bad,—so far So good. But I, not bought, but wholly made Out of your pleasure, fact and monument Of your caprice, a thing you hazarded On the big gaming table of the world, And now,—why after all, say you, it 's mine, And let it work to please me.—My respect, Your Eminence, dies poisoned by the truth. For this, despoil me as you will, my sword Is mine, my honour's mine, and mine my life. I'll fight no jeweller's fight, that 's flat, nor earn A busy quarrel-monger's name. I've said. CARD. You press me hard, for one who long was kind, And made your livelihood as best Fortune and fame would warrant—yet of that Enough. [Coldly.] I came to order and I sue: Your sword is my defence. Hear me again, My son, for I had interest in— ANG. Interest? CARD. I say, the girl— ANG. You loved the girl? CARD. She was my— ANG. What? CARD. My—ward. ANG. Ward, loved your ward! Christ and the Saints, how hideous! [He laughs fiercely and long and sinks into a chair.] I had thought A scarlet Cardinal with silver hair Had made his peace with lust— CARD. Villain, be still Or I'll tear out thy tongue. She was—Ah God— She was my daughter. [A long pause. ANGELO passes his hand over his forehead and seems stupefied and shakes his head.] ANG. Wait—no—I cannot—what you said— You spoke— CARD. Well, sir,— ANG. [frantic]. No, no, I'll not believe't. No, God Almighty's curse, no, no. I swear it 's false. I say, no. It's to spur me finely on, To move my stubborn temper. But the lie 's Too thick, too simple. CARD. [calling]. Luigi! ANG. Why, it's plain The thing could never be,—the beasts abhor— Oh, loathsome ghost, away! [LUIGI and FRASCATI enter. ANGELO still mumbles away.] CARD. [trembling with suppressed anger.] The tender fool Will not believe she is my daughter— [FRASCATI shudders.] LUIGI. Good sir, be calm; as I am old and sad She is your sister. ANG. [cries wildly]. Ah! Ah! Aches of the damned, Flames of the ugly place, tremendous pain And everlasting anguish, take my soul. Old man, thou art a fool—she is my heart, My life. I robbed her, kissed her, loved her, I— And planned eternal peace upon her breast, And wove her garments of mine ecstasies And made her girdle of mine arms. I say We drank one only cup, and eat together,— We made a world—and—and—Ah, both you lie, And came to cheat my single happiness, [LUCIA comes in.] My only years in all this dreary light— Where youth was not youth, life not life—till now When like a broken bird within her hand I lay, she giving me back melody, And turning nightingale she too with me Rose thro' the violet night singing, singing, Over the moon-beloved and perfumed fields. [He turns to LUIGI, with a broken voice You are too old to stab me with a lie— [With terrible anxiety.] Tell me, kind old Luigi– tell me, now; You see, I'm wretched as a worm half crushed— Be true—For God's sake, speak the truth ... [LUIGI turns away in tears] Well then, it is! Angel of Destiny, I felt thy feathers pass Upon my brow and heard thy clapping wing Longer ago than memory or life. Take me away. [He stabs himself] Lucia, where art thou? [He dies] [1897] SHORTER FRAGMENTS FROM “THE CARDINAL PLAY” I ANGELO I would I had thee like a drop of dew That falls from heaven without history. II FRASCATI Oh, mine Angelo, These things creep out by every finger tip; A footprint tells the tale. And women's love Is noisy with perpetual echo; for they cry In upper chambers whence the filtering sound Grows tell-tale to the world; and next they write Love-letters that go most directly wrong. III ANGELO We spend a playful youth to find at last A woman saviour of ourselves. I 've found. And in my iron arms the surge can beat Importunate and long. I shall not yield. I loved her as in play: I love her now With the great steady need of all a soul. IVLUCIA [Singing at her window] Ask me my all with a look of thine eyes. A blush replies, Yes. Heart and whatever soever be mine, Not less Is thine. Thou art sunflooded and infinite sky And I A little star lost far away Down the day. [Singing as she descends] Thou art the branches unwindily stirred, I, a bird Who tire from seas of the west To thy breast. V LUCIA A parting, now! To part! why, yes. But what 's in parting? In such small separation as we plan To fit our chances? what 's in leaving? Time. And Time is long, and longer Time is Pain, And Pain is death. O let us wholly die Who lived too wildly— ANGELO So said I, Lucia, Were 't not that one may roundly crawl about The moving camps of Destiny, and build Behind her passage fortresses of peace To harbour life in. XVII “DRAMATIC FRAGMENTS [1904] I I used to think The mind essential in the body, even As stood the body essential in the mind: Two inseparable things, by nature equal And similar, and in creation's song Halving the total scale: it is not so. Unlike and cross like driftwood sticks they come Churned in the giddy trough: a chunk of pine A slab of rosewood: mangled each on each With knocks and friction, or in deadly pain Sheathing each other's splinters: till at last Without all stuff or shape they 're jetted up Where in the bluish moisture rot whate'er Was vomited in horror from the sea. II BLINDNESS AND DEAFNESS [Enter X, who learns the dispute and says] You waste good time. More philosophic much it were to ask By speculation or experiment What midget skims the void of that man Who being all these together: deaf, dumb, blind, Yet must within himself, as, sepulchred 'Mid rings of brazen crenellation down Under tremendous towers, the heart of Cain, Be alive. III THE SOUL OF TIME Time's a circumference Whereof the segment of our station seems A long straight line from nothing into naught. Therefore we say “progress,” “infinity”— Dull words whose object Hangs in the air of error and delights Our boyish minds ahunt for butterflies. For aspiration studies not the sky But looks for stars; the victories of faith Are soldiered none the less with certainties, And all the multitudinous armies decked With banners blown ahead and flute before March not to the desert or th' Elysian fields, But in the track of some discovery, The grip and cognizance of something true, Which won resolves a better distribution Between the dreaming mind and real truth. I cannot understand you. 'T is because You lean over my meaning's edge and feel A dizziness of the things I have not said. IV Be patient, very patient; for the skies Within my human soul now sunset-flushed Break desperate magic on the world I knew, And in the crimson evening flying down Bell-sounds and birds of ancient ecstasy Most wonderfully carol one time more. V Sir, say no more. Within me 't is as if The green and climbing eyesight of a cat Crawled near my mind's poor birds.</field>
