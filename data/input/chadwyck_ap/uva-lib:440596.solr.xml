      <field name="fulltext">No. I. ââMuch yet remains Unsung, and many cares are yet behind, And more laborious.ââ ââSedulous, I seek to improve, At least neglect not, nor leave unemploy'd, The mind.ââ Cowper. NYMPH OF THE VALLEY. By Heaven united, not by accident Of transient fancy, like as thousands are, But by such secret workings of events As sages call inscrutable. Well met, Soul wedding soul, to each each perfect seem'd. Manuscript. Along a bushy slope, amongst the cliffs, Near, where its head a rugged upland lifts, A living fountain sends a crystal rill, Meand'ring, ruffling, gurgling down the hill; Then o'er its pebbly bed midst thickets winds, And through the tangled sedge its passage finds. Then smooth along through verdant meads it strays, And opes its bosom to the golden blaze; At length grown deep and swell'd by confluent streams, It spreads a lake that like an ocean seems. On either side, hills, crown'd with forests, rise, Whose lofty tops associate with the skies; Oft courting heavy-laden clouds to bow, And drop a blessing on the vales below. O! how in youth, at morn or eventide, I lov'd to saunter the smooth lake beside, And haply with some mate, of sport in search, Hook from his wonted haunt the red-finn'd perch! The tyrant pike, too, and the spotted trout, Rotund and large, with transports we drew out. Or, as we went to hunt the hare, To set the trap, or fix the snare; Where 'mongst the woods the wild-bees humm'd, And, heard remote, the partridge drumm'd; What joyful sports and seasons goneâ Youth passes never to return! Or when the cool airs lift their caves, Refresh'd the day, and woke the waves, On board some barge, the fair to please, With what delight we caught the favouring breeze! Fann'd by zephyr, young and sprightly, With a graceful motion, lightly, Wav'd the forest, far and wide, Nodding with majestic pride; While the leaves, with rustling noise, Added to our social joys; And, all around, a grateful clime, Where cultur'd fields, and rude, combin'd, And prospects fair, and scenes sublime, With useful thoughts supply'd the thinking mind. Beside the lake a cottage stands; An ample range its front commands; And Cora, loveliest nymph of all the glades, Adorn'd its haunts, and charm'd the rural shades. O, she was fair! her modest aspect shone Expressive of a mind of heavenly tone; No pencil of the nicest tint could trace Her eye's divinity, her features' grace; No words describe with what a nameless ease Her peerless manners never fail'd to please; Where'er she mov'd, she seem'd a beam so bright, One might have thought an angel were in sight. I cannot tell one half:âin her combin'd What chastest fancy paints, to please the mind; And, though of beauty's magic power possess'd, Not a vain thought she harbour'd in her breast; And, (strange to tell!) endow'd with so much grace, She deem'd herself th' unworthiest of her race. Oft roaming near, in quest of woodland game, A village youth, the fam'd Rhinaldo, came; With fearful noise he made the woods resound, And oft the damsel started at the sound. From close behind him, as he fir'd his gun, His yelping dog in eager transport run; And, full of triumph if he caught the prey, Convey'd it to his host without delay. Trampling up a rugged steep, In haste retire th' affrighted sheep, Halt and turn to see what harm Causes such a dread alarm. If attack'd, the madded ram, With brazen front, defends his dam, Stamps the foot, and buts the knock, Champion of the trembling flock; While by frequent starts the bell Gingles o'er the sounding dell. But oft the youth, in voice of sweetest turns, Woke mountain echo from the rocks and urns; Or, by the magic of his vocal flute, In mute suspense detain'd the gazing brute. Such dulcet melody he breath'd along, The birds hopp'd round, forgetful of their song; Hush'd was the wind, the rill forebore its noise, And list'ning silence stood entranc'd with joys. Smooth was the flood; declining to his bed, O'er western skies the sun carnation spread; Irradiate crimson on the lake repos'd, Charming its bosom ere eve's curtain clos'd; Down came the shadows from the mountain's height; Soft dusky vapours sooth'd the beams of light; The weary songster to his roost retir'd; From the dark grove the whippoorwill respir'd. Sunk had the sun; and lo! the full-orb'd moon Was wandering up to her nocturnal noon; What time the virgin sought the adjacent wood, Her wonted haunt, to indulge her heavenly mood. Thus she began: Hail! ancient, hallow'd groves! Your venerable gloom my heart approves! Gladly I come to pass a musing hour In the cool shades of your inviting bower! Seraphs of light! who hover on the wing, Guardians of virtue, your kind influence bring! Holiest of Beings! (then her lips begun,) Imbue me with the spirit of thy Son! Beneath thy banner me from harm protect, Forgive my sins, and all my steps direct! She then revolv'd on what the world calls bliss, Which from experience she had prov'd amiss; That common friendship has, like riches, wings, And fashionable life a thousand stings; That, in the scales of scandal and esteem, 'Tis self-deceit to expect a level beam; The first (it is so gross) the last outweighs, And lightens every deed that merits praise. She spoke; meanwhile from heaven the stars so bright, And from her cloud the silver queen of night, Look'd through the trees, and saw the damsel there, And smil'd upon âthe fairest of the fair.â The thicket, interspers'd with light and shade, A checker'd scene and motley group display'dâ 'Twas autumnâthousand insects all among, In oft repeated swells the welkin rung. While musing there, soft slumber weigh'd Her weary senses to repose, Till a small voice awoke the maidâ âHe who shall save thy life shall be thy spouse.â The vision gone, the words return, Distinct to her reflection's view, With heavenly flame her feelings burn; When, ranging thus the clause, She fains another meaning, true, âMy soul is life, my Saviour is my spouse.â But, still, without apparent cause, The Oracle was heard again In softest syllables to move; Repeating o'er the former strain, âHe who shall save thy life shall be thy spouse.â So, oft reflecting, often musing, Thinking what the presage meant; Without the least apparent chusing, Or a seemingly intent; She, by involuntary laws, Frequent pronounc'd the vision'd clause.â It seem'd like answer; as when round Echo returns the noise of sound. At length, bound homeward from his sport, Rhinaldo now, to make the distance short, An unfrequented path pursu'd, That pierc'd this ancient, solitary wood. When from some bush a noise he heard, As 'twere the rustling of a bird. Instant he stopp'd, and gazing spy'd, Half hid the leafy boughs between, A female form of blooming mein, Fair as a fabled sylvan queen; A lovelier never shone a bride. As when the moon through clouds appears, So she; all beautiful in fears. At first a sweet surprise she show'd, Her blushes in his favour glow'd. In silent gaze her eye to meet, He feels the force her charms impart; No sight e'er seem'd to sense so sweet; A thousand hopes and fears assail his heart. Still half her beauty, as in shrouds, Obstructing foliages conceal'd; Through pendent locks her eyes, reveal'd, Shone like two stars that peep through clouds. His prying fancy, spelling out new charms, Brought to his mind a thousand hid alarms; So what her modesty would fain deny, Seem'd twice as fair to thought's intrusive eye. Advancing now in smiling look, Thus from his lips his accents broke: Say, whence art thou, my gentle maid? Thou beam amidst the moonlight shade! If I am no intruder here, Nymph of the forest, O declare! In city born, the Maid reply'd, I now in yonder cot reside; My early life in affluence flow'd, Where fortune, kind, her gifts bestow'd; Until the radiant morning beam, That deck'd my youth's smooth flowing stream, Darken'd by clouds, departed like a dream. Thus left in bloom of life to mourn A father gone, (and never to return!) I pass'd the day in boding fears, And drown'd the night in sorrow's tears. No kindred soul, save one, was there, My breast to sooth, my woes to share; No sister to dispel my care;â And many a look that once seem'd warm With fondly friendship's seraph charm, Sudden grew cold. A mother cheers My sadly thoughts, and mingles tears with tears. At length our small resources fail; Our mansion sold, we left the town, Avoiding scowling friendship's frown, And bought yon Cottage of the Vale. There on a mound, a rural seat, A pleasant view, a sweet retreat, Live we in peace, and food obtain By such employments as our needles gain. Nothing contents on earth I find, Like a sweet solace of the mind. She spoke; then he: But fear'st thou not, sweet lass, In these dark melancholy cells, Where oft the boding corm'rant yells, Away from home thy lonely hours to pass? Home I admire, the maid replied; Dear to my heart my parent seems; Yet oft, at fall of eventide, I love in these lone haunts to hide, Nor dread the boding night-bird's screams. But when resound the lark's shrill peals; When o'er the world the dayspring steals, I love to ramble o'er the flowery fields. She said; when thus the youth return'd, While rapture in his bosom burn'd: The worthiest of thy sex thou art! Nay, something more than human dwells Within the foldings of thy heart, Or fear would keep thee from these awful cells! Though I with frequent footsteps roam O'er the wild woods, or fields in bloom; I most at home should take my share, If loveliness like thine were there. And 'twere my heart's devoted pride, Could I but call theeâdurst I sayâmy bride? A conscious blush, with passion fraught, Suffus'd her visage as he gaz'd; For she had heard his virtues prais'd; And he had her acquaintance sought. Silent they stood; till, full of charm, Such as might saints of light admire; Or such as might a stoic warm With a celestial fire; Cora replied: O, could I right from wrong discern, And, of myself, decide, I could not but as Heaven allows! Take for an answer this return: âHe who shall save my life shall be my spouse.â Think me not rude, the youth rejoin'd; Vain flattering words which courtiers choose, I from my soul abhor to use; As soon might grow the tyger kind. In truth thee greatly I revere; And when in future thou shalt hear, Reft of his mate, the turtle dove, O think, so sacred is my love! Wert thou in peril, I would rush to thee, Though wrathful vengeance should prohibit me! Nay, pass the front of horror with disdain, Thee to arrest from harm, or save from pain! A dovelike sympathy now took control, And o'er her visage glow'd the feeling soul. Not with diviner beams Aurora shows Joy in her rosy features, wet with dews: Not with more charm seems verdant spring in bloom, When fragrant nature breathes divine perfume. Now side by side, along they rove, Silent, so fill'd with magic power of love; Till at the cottage door they standâ He begg'd a draught of cooling drink; When, turning with an aspect bland, She tript it to a living spring, Spouting beneath the mountain's brink; And had the bliss the cup to bring, And he to take from her enchanting hand. Trembling he drank; he thank'd the Maid, While him a courteous look she paid, Bowing submiss at what he said, Taking the cup in both her hands; But, as Rhinaldo turn'd his steps away, He so reluctant seem'd to part; She wish'd, withheld by silken bands, He had prolong'd his stay, And thought she saw a tear-drop start. May horror seize the wretch, one day, Who seeks, with base perfidious views, To win attachment to abuse, To violate, to triumph, to betray! The man, so infamous, so low, To 'self himself shall prove a foe. For while, when round thick darkness broods, He hears the hawk's yell 'mongst the woods; Or, in his sleep, the mastiff's growl, Or, loud, the mountain mad-wolf's howl; Nay, while dire whims reflection brews, The creeking hinge, the white cat's mews; Will not his fancy conjure up a ghost Of horrid aspect, or a host Of ghastly goblins, grinning spite, To vex his haggard soul by night? Guilt, as a passion, ever associates itself with portentous fears. Under its influence imagination misconstrues the least strange noise, or trivial circumstance, into some vindictive visitation. So at variance with each other are virtue and vice, in the very constitution of things, and so diverse is their tendency; while happiness is the certain result of the one, ruin and misery are the inevitable consequence of the other. There is no alliance between them, either in principle, or practice, or final destination. Indeed, there would be great impropriety in supposing, that they both lead to the same bourne, or that they ought, in justice, to be treated indiscriminately alike. And should, when keen convictions start, He blunt each pang upon his heart; Should he the sense of guilt dispel, When forc'd upon himself to dwell; Say, can his stout heart think to brave, Impenitent, the horrors of the grave? And when the burning, dire disease, Anon, shall on his vitals seize, Producing horrible distress, Think ye that man will go to happiness? But, with the youth that decks my strain, It was not so:âhe liv'd a swain, Such as a sire to virtue prone, Might as a son delight to own, Belov'd wherever he was known, And whose esteem the virtuous sought to gain. Now fly, ye lingering hours, away! Hasten, O time! and bring th' expected day! At length, beneath the solar ray, Upon the lake a barge is seen, Where, face to face, in smiling mien, The mutual sexes shine in vestments gay. The waves are blue, the fields are green, The breeze expands the whiten'd sails, While social intercourse prevails, And bears them gently far away. As when a swan, in buoyant pride, Launches his bosom on the tide; And, moving on with viewless force, Wheels with a swelling curve his course; Well manag'd thus, the barge with ease, Rides gracefully before the breeze. Lo! now direct, they glide with speed, Along the shore where spreads the mead, Where, from the crystal water's bed, Pebbles reflect the twinkling beam, Or where the finny species seem Fond of much sport, and void of dread. Athwart, about, they gently swim, While just beneath the surface lies The greedy tyrant of the stream, And, darting, takes them by surprise. Now looking round her, Harriot cries, O see! how alter'd now, how strange, The back-ground seems in unaccustom'd range! The cot, half hid behind the wood, Is all at once remov'd from where it stood; The mountain swims, the shores recede, The boat stands still; along her side, With rapid force the waters glide, And giddiness has seiz'd my head. She said and ceas'd; when, in command, Rhinaldo steer'd direct to land; They quit the barge with lively speed, And ramble o'er the verdant mead, Pick various plums, select fair flowers, And laugh away the social hours:â While all the time, with special care, (For in his breast soft passion burn'd,) Rhinaldo sought to please the fair, Till evening came, and they return'd. The time pass'd pleasant like a song, Rhinaldo courted, waited, long, And oft, with delicate applause, He nam'd his suit, and urg'd his cause: Till the fair Maid, at length, reply'd: But when she would say yes, deny'd: For destiny had plann'd it so, 'Twas Cora's duty to say no! But spoke it in such softly way, It did not seem to mean like nay. She said she wish'd his friendship still: And, under that disguise, Rhinaldo hoped to win the prize, Nor press'd the Maid against her will. And, if a cautious dame should say, Or hint a fear, he might betray; He, with a brow serene, (As sometimes answers man his wife,) Shook, as he laugh'd, the thought away; For honour was as dear to him as life. At length beside the lake one day, Where oft the nymphs were wont to stray, As Cora walk'd with Harriot, (sad to tell!) The bank gave way, and Cora fell. Harriot, distracted, knew not what to do, But scream'd aloud, and tow'rds the cottage flew. See how she flies! and, like a frighted fawn, Leaps o'er a fence, and darts across the lawn! Propitious Heaven! all frantic with despair, Inly she cries, O save! O hear my prayer! Onward she hied, but hied in vain; For, ere she could return again, Rhinaldo, sent by Heaven to save, Had hasten'd to the spot in time; Had plung'd into the lake, sublime, And borne the drowning virgin from the wave. Twice had she sunk; he seiz'd her hair, Then rais'd her gasping person from despair. With lively transport in his eyes, Joy glads my soul, Rhinaldo cries; The terms perform'd, I claim the prize. MINOR POEMS. THE ROBIN. Hark! the native warbler sings! To charm his mate upon her nest, The guardian of her rest, He tells the most melodious thingsâ How all nature smiles about, How fast the mulb'ries grow, How her gentle breast will glow, When her tender young are out. His dulcet strains salute the morning glows, And sooth retiring daylight to repose. ECHO. Lo! beyond the distant bog, As the peasant chops a logâ Hark! the sound, in long suspense, Cheats the stroke, and balks the sense; But, expanding o'er the vale, Or along some dingling dale, Where, the hills and woods among, Jovial rings the team-boy's song, Echo, softlier than a bell, Fills with noise her airy shell; And, according to her laws, Protracts the sound at every pause. PLEASANT VIEW. Upon the plains of Jersey wide extended, Where landscapes late my pleas'd attention drew, Cooper's plantation with enchantments blended, Lives in my mind, and forms a pleasant view. On one side spreads an ancient wood majestic, On one side rolls the Delaware sublime; The mansion is a tranquil scene domestic, And all around it a luxuriant clime. Far, wav'd the harvest like a golden ocean, High towering, nodded a fine field of corn; With num'rous flocks the pastures were in motion, And joyous Plenty fill'd with fruit her horn. Enrob'd in elegance, with smiling faces, By Art embellish'd, by Delight inspir'd, Around the pleasure garden danc'd the Graces, Approv'd of Fancy, and by Taste admir'd. When on a verdant bank I took my station, And, lingering, ponder'd on the river's pride; The gorgeous west diffus'd a rich carnation, And chang'd a silver to a golden tide. Meanwhile the red-breast pour'd his raptur'd vesper, Winding his notes to a melodious close; He seem'd to serenade triumphant Hesper, And lull creation to divine repose. Along the margin of a meadow walking, I met three wood-nymphs rambling o'er the scene; Well-pleas'd, in sportive humour they were talking, And nature brighten'd into sprightlier green. The transient seraph of my soul was present; Upon her charms with ravish'd look I hung; Enjoy'd a fervour of emotion pleasant, And caught the magic of her witching tongue. 'Twas not a passion of romantic story; 'Twas not a flame that beam'd a settled ray; Like Zephyr, fondling o'er the sweets of Flora, I stole a stock of bliss, and hied away. Hast thou not paid to loveliness, devotion, And caught enchantment from affection's smile? Hast thou not felt in sympathy a motion, That with a soothing power could griefs beguile? Hast thou not mark'd the fervid, fond confession, The strong desire with vivid hope combin'd, And felt an ecstasy beyond expression, A kindred mood, a paradise of mind? Doubtless; and often so have I, transported, While full of consciousness my being rose; O! to the lass I love I'll be devoted, With all the tenderness my bosom knows. THE MONTH OF MARCH. How pleasant is this place! E'en in this month Of winds I love my home. The sky is cold And clear. Behind the house the north wind raves; In front, the sun emits his slanting beams. Without a trough the melted snows to guide, The roof lets fall a thousand pattering drops. Passing we dodge. At yester-noon fell thick A flaky shower, and mantled o'er the face Of Nature that had smil'd. Earth, like a bride, Frigid as chastity, flaunts in white robes; But, having the dissolving touch of spring Felt, she will soon his mild embrace enjoy. Beneath her snowy vestments, ruthless frost No longer binds the life-sustaining glebe, Intent to burst its vegetative powers. To guard the fruit trees from the nibbling flocks, The heedful husbandman his fence repairs, And timely prunes his thrifty orchard. Earth, Of quick-dissolving snows, now drinks her fill. Man's ardent bosom, now elate with hopes Of seed-time, gathers sympathetic life And vigour. Vegetation works unseen. The sun grows vertical; less fierce the winds. Aries holds light and darkness equipois'd. In yonder mead, along the hillock's base, From northern blasts defended, or beside Some tepid spring e'en now my fancy paints The vivid green grass. From the dripping bogs Fleecy white vapours rise; and, freed from ice, The limpid rill, rejoicing in its course, Meand'ring, sweetly gurgles as it falls. The fascinating verdure of the fields, The gentle rustling of the trees, new-leav'd, The jocund warblings of the birds are near. Invigorated by that mystic power, Which, from the seed and root propels the blade, And ear, and grain, all nature soon will smile. So by that wonder-working power inspir'd, Man shall arise again, and live renew'd. KATE, CRAZED. âThere often wanders one whom better days Saw better clad, in cloak and satin trimm'd With lace, and hat with splendid ribbon bound.â COWPER. At the first glow of morn, When jocund spring was born, Aurelius caught, by mountain-side, The blooming Kate, the hamlet's pride. Awaken'd by virtue's alarms, She flung from his armsâ He sought her hand, but she deny'd. You know, she said, at yester-eve, When I had you refus'd, You rudely me abus'd, And stole a kiss without my leave. Aurelius now her pardon sought; He told her 'twas a wayward thought; And laid the charge to beauty's power, While play beguil'd the social hour. Such plausive words the virgin woo'd; She straight forgave the deed so rude; And said, the like beneath the sun, None but Aurelius should have done. The hint the joyous victor took, He caught again his coyish guest, And, in a look Of rapt endearment, clasp'd her to his breast. 'Tis wrong, she cry'd; why do you so? Indeed, 'tis wrong; now let me go. The while, she turn'd her face aside, Her rising passion to conceal, Nor for the world would she reveal Her secret wish to be a bride. In vain she turn'd; with power to move, A glance escap'd that told her love. Beneath an oak-tree's wide spread boughs, They talk'd of Nature's charming beam, (Nor thoughtless of a fonder theme,) And pledg'd at last their mutual vows. Along the glen a river roll'd; Contiguous, far, a cottage stood; The fields th' approach of summer told; While noisy echo on the hill, Responded to the roaring flood, And frequent tic-tac of the mill. Suspended at her side, And in a silk-net bound, A harp, of golden sound, The maid unty'd; And as her fingers mov'd, To tune the lively air she lov'd, She added melting vocal tone, And with such ravishment she sung, It might affect a heart of stone, While hills around in concert rung. As time stole away, They wish'd it to stay; Exchang'd adieus with heart-felt pain; But oft as fit occasion came, They met and parted all the same, Nor cause had either to complain. O! never was the youth so pleasant, As when enchanting Kate was present! He was of an ardent turn, His love was true, his heart would burn; And oft, with sympathy of soul, Almost beyond his own control, He drew the cherub to his breast, While the world was gone to rest. Noble he was, of manly face; One might his temper in his features trace; And virtue, bounteous to her votive son, Had given his spirit an ethereal tone. I knew him well; my generous friend was heâ Alas, Aurelius! thou wast dear to me! Mourn, ye fair virgins! him, ye swains, deplore! First render'd wretched; now on earth no more! Weep over him, ye flowers! ye gentle gales, Sigh to the streams; ye streams, return the wails! Wand'ring one day the groves among, His fancy on Kate's image hung; When to himself: Enchanting maid! And shall I ever call thee mine? he said: Approach, O Day! that kind event to show; Fly, Time! nor drag along thy wheels so slow. He spoke; and often he would stray alone, To muse upon her lovely mind; And oft her name repeat, in rapt'rous toneâ Ah cruel fate! O how unkind! The conquest sure, the maid grew vain, And, acting the coquette, She sought to give Aurelius pain, Slighted her vows, and scorn'd regret. Touch'd with indignant pride, (For love that is sincere, Is loath to suffer wrong,) He left his perjur'd bride, (It was decreed above!) And to the woods he hied along, And dwelt a hermit there, Hating the morning which beguil'd his love. The yelling squalls arose, And, frantic with despair, Kate on her couch took no repose, But flung her arms, and tore her hair. The north wind flapp'd her windows rude; Her door upon its hinges creak'd; And elf behind her curtain speak'd, And twice and once a white cat mew'd. Disturb'd all night, she try'd in vain, To drive the frightful omen from her brain. At length, a vague report was spread, That young Aurelius, sad, demure, To some enchanted grot had fled, From social haunts away, and liv'd obscure. In deepest solitudes confin'd, 'Mongst horrid cliffs where scorpions dwell, Within a ghosted dell, Around which corm'rants yell, He found a mansion suited to his mind. Conflicting passions had his bosom torn, Too much he suffer'd to be borne; His parents had grown inhumane; And Kate herself had us'd her art, To agonize his heart. Ah! foolish maid, he cry'd; to test my flame With such expedients to thy shame! Treatment such, he could not brook; Conqu'ring himself he took Indifference along, And sought seclusion from a world of wrong. Within the Zembla of his mind, A rueful apathy, unkind, Usurp'd the vacant throne, Whence tender sensibility had flown. At length through the wood a fair maid Had heedlessly stroll'd from her way; For after the heat of the day, While the west is with crimson bespread, There's romantic delight in the shade. But see! on a sudden surprise, She lifts, as in wonder, her hands, And remains with astonish'd fix'd eyes. Amidst umbrageous gloom, A monumental ruin stands, A dismal, solitary tomb. Hark! the raven moans! Hark! a fancy'd goblin grows! Lo! beside a murky cave, A pensive hermit sat, While sportively the bat With flitting wing a whizzing gave. Solemn, awful dread Seiz'd the falt'ring maid. Her spirits flag, Her footsteps lag; Cold thrills her blood, And, like a post, Aghast she stood, And, wild in reason, seem'd a ghost. Now coming to herself again, She thinks she sees her long-lost swain,â 'Tis he! 'tis he! she cries: the same! She call'd aloud upon his name. Th' enchanted caves, the woods among, Fill'd with the sound, reverberating rung. Struck with surprise, The man of the wood Started and stood, And star'd about. Trembling with fear and doubt, 'Twas Kate herself, he knewâ Ah see, he faints! upon the ground he lies. Like the tempest she flew, And the words that she spoke, Rent the sky with a peal. The hermit scarce had power to feel. Kate scarce his visage knew;â But, as he op'd his eyes, She anxiously cries, Aurelius! is it you? To whom, unchang'd, he quick reply'd: (Thus did the fates decide:) Coquette! begone! Kate and Aurelius never can be one. Oh! unexpected, fatal stroke! Detested day! Distracted, amaz'd, Turn'd she awayâ Her heart was broke. She straight went craz'd. REFLECTION ON LIFE. When we peruse the hist'ry of mankind, And learn what crimes have been! Oh! how it wounds The soul, to think that, of all beings here, Man, made erect, oft creeps the lowest wretch! For in the moral taste the standard lies, And none but humble pilgrims walk upright. Of all the myriads of the human race, How few, if any, with a moral eye On Heaven, support that godlike attitude Eternity demands! Eternity! Amazing word! and shall the mental spark, Once conscious of existence, happy live, Or wretched be, forever? What a thought! And true: 'tis Heaven's immutable decree! And the soul's exit from sublunar climes, Fixes its everlasting destiny. Were it not well for all who value life, And calculate on happiness to come; Though rich or poor, or wise or ignorant, That each his pilgrimage may well perform, Oft, on their way, to ponder on themselvesâ How they may best their journey's end pursue, And how be best receiv'd by those in wait Upon the confines of th' eternal world, To greet them with delight, or shun with scorn, As their peculiar states deserve. For then, Each aspect will express the character. Without disguise the soul will all appear; Vice will show hate, and virtue show her charm. Whether 'twere proper, since the axe is laid At the tree's root, to dally out our lives In pastimes, sloth, and fashionable crime, Despis'd or honour'd, as the case may be, Or by one great exertion, set at once Aside, the sin that doth so easily Beset us, and, at once, repent and mend, Is the grand point that we should solve direct; And, as there's no alternative, beside Virtue and bliss, and vice and punishment, Either all hopes of happiness resign, Or bring ourselves to instant discipline. For to resolve to mend at future date, Were only to postpone; and to postpone, Were loss of chance which never might return; But, haply, if it should, to meet it then With new postponement by a new resolve, Were all deception; fooling with one's self In face of counsel; and deception, fix'd, Perpetuates delay, and keeps the soul In hazard unaware. It lulls and blinds Conscience, when she should keep her strictest watch, And weaves the name of virtue, guilefully, Upon the cobweb of a self-wrought cheat. Making a merit of th' intent to mend, Some balance oft the long arrear of life By thoughts of reformation never put to proof; And when the King of Terrors comes along, And finds their opportunities abus'd, And straight his vengeful sentence executes, Alas! alas! Oh! what will be their doom? ON THE BIBLE. O sacred Book of knowledge, all divine, The Bible! richer than the golden mine! The sun of moral systems, it unfolds The path of glory to immortal souls. Nay, 'tis the standard of true taste, the pride Of letter'd learning, and the critic's guide. With boldest figures its descriptions glow; Its gentle tales in softest pathos flow; The true sublime in diction apt and terse, Or beauty's image radiates its verse; Thoughts, there, in loftiest or in simplest dress, Strike and affect the soul with matchless stress; Words, there, like glowing coals, a warmth impart, And strokes from nature shame the strokes of art. Such charms its little hist'ry pieces wear, They melt the reader o'er the story there; Such thoughts its splendid imagery inspires, Conception kindles into hallow'd fires. Like vernal beams which vegetate the earth, While plenteous showers give vigour to her birth; So the blest Word, receiv'd by faith, imbues, With life, the dead; with joyful hope endues; Supplies the soul with ever-during food, On earth the foretaste of immortal good. Announce its fame, ye Angels! far and near, Till the whole race the gladsome sound shall hear! ARK OF FAITH. Hail, sacred Ark of ever sure reliance, Ne'er known to meet perdition on a shoal; Thou, buoyant, bid'st life's dashing sea defiance, And turn'st aside its mountains as they roll! Along the coast of Man, in triumph sailing, A thousand barks intend one port to make; When, lo! Opinion's wildering fogs prevailing, They separate, and various courses take. Near Folly's quicksands, in a dread position, Without a rudder, on Destruction's wave; The schooner Chance is hurried to perdition, And Doubt her pilot to Confusion's grave. But the staunch Ark of Faith, with steady motion, Hope at mast head, Experience at her stern, Mid storms, o'er billows, grandly rides the ocean, Certain to make the port of her concern. For He who regulates the vast of Nature, Whose potent word the winds and waves obey, Will by his promise, as the Mediator, Bring all his Chosen Ones to immortal day. TO HOPE. O come, thou cherub of enchanting vision, Man's beck'ning angel through the scenes of care; In adverse fortune make the best provision, And save me from the horror of despair! Since I've embark'd on life's precarious ocean, Should the waves roar, impell'd by furious gales; My bark at random, should the dire commotion, Splinter her masts, and shiver all her sails; While overhead, thick clouds and billows blending, The skies on fire reflect a dismal glare; O, strengthen me, amidst the scene contending, And snatch me from the grapple of despair! But should my ship, grown leaky all around her, Fill with the flood beyond the power to save; Should she amidst the mighty uproar, founder, And leave me to the fury of the wave; Quit me not then, upon a fragment riding, At random hove upon the boist'rous deep; But give me prospects of the winds subsiding, And from despair my flagging spirits keep! And O! at death, although distress attend me, Depriv'd of earthly prospect of support; Be near, thou Angel! kind assistance lend me, And waft my spirit to its native port! TO CHARITY. Oh! why should man, of such exalted feature, With soul constructed on the moral plan, Indulge his passions as the fiercest creature, The bloodiest monster since the world began. How shocking! what a thirst he has for killing! Outrageous, fell, revengeful he appears, His blade still warm, not surfeited with spilling The blood of thousands for six thousand years! Spirit of Love! O come; best joys revealing, That heaven bestows upon the human mind, And, by thy quick'ning power, elicit feeling, And renovate the temper of mankind! Teach us the love of kindness to each other, To aid the suff'rer, though we aid the foe; And, looking on each neighbour as a brother, Lessen the quantity of human wo. Fair as the morn at her divine oblation, When in her comeliest aspect she appears; O! spread thy sacred reign o'er every nation, And bring the triumph of the golden years! ON GARRICK. When on the stage fam'd Garrick trod, And shook the benches by a nod, His author's genius all his own, O, how he shone! As from his lips the words expir'd, With animation fir'd, A twofold language from conception broke; He personated what he spoke, And gazing auditors admir'd. His looks were at his own command; Through vaulted roofs his words expand; While from their seats spectators lean With greedy ears to hear; Their passions, at his will, are seen, Revenge, or hate, or love, or fear. Now o'er his visage pity creeps; Feign'd grief seems real as he weeps; Now mov'd by love, he charms, he charms; His ardour every bosom warms; Hard hearts he melts to passion's tide, And wakes desires which Nature had deny'd. But, stung by angry passions now, He shakes live scorpions from his brow. Madness was in his lookâ Vengeance, and scorn, and hate, Brew'd, in his frown, the downfall of the state. The vaulted mansion shook; In wild despair, Fear seiz'd the monarch's hair;â He started from his seat:â With gaping mouths, as op'd by fate, Like statues of dumb wood, Spectators stood With fury in their ire, With horror in their stare; For Garrick's was a soul of fire, And the grim spectre of the play was there. ON WOMAN. Ah, why is woman thus by man ador'd, The comeliest object in creation's hoard? Ah why, where Nature's plastic hand neglects, Has he an eye to beautify defects? To hold her perfect in his partial sight, His fancy's idol, and his heart's delight? Is it because her form is fair, Though destitute of ardour there? Is it because more perfect made, Of finer mould, or nobler grade? No; 'tis because, with strong control, Her gentle aspect softens on his soul. Yes; 'tis because his eye can trace A sympathy serene, A fascinating grace, Depicted in her mein. And, O! her mannersâall her own; Her voiceâof an etherial tone; Her magic smileâoffspring of mind, By thought improv'd, by taste refin'd:â These, above all, can deck the face, And make a blemish seem a real grace. ON THE SEXES. Lo! when the sexes we comprise, And mark the divers traits that rise, How much more delicate we find, Woman than man, in frame and mind! Appropriate signs, and features fair, In manners, looks, and voice, declare, Throughout the kindred species we behold, The male and female of a different mould. Each one exists but half the kind, By Nature, fashion'd to be join'd; Yet, though dissimilar in frame, Their senses, passions, wishes are the same. Each leans to each by sympathy's control, And mutual kindness mingles soul with soul. Desire to please, on either side, To character exists a moral guide; So thus, preserving decency and grace, Excites, improves, and dignifies our race. But there's a charm in Woman's ways, Deserving of peculiar praise. When man is in distress, She has the blissful power to bless; Her look alone can give relief; Her seraph smile can solace grief; Nay, she can rule him as she will, Though he remain the master still; But governs (if she govern right) By gentle means, but not by might. So each controls, while each obeys, But, most of all, her kindness sways. He, by her softness, milder grows; She, radiate by his manlier brows, New dignity displays; Thus each on each elicits rays; While the sweet spirit that refines, Assimilates their manners and their minds. O! what a happy state abides, Where sympathies agree, and reason guides! Where converse shows the moral sense refin'd, And looks bespeak a loveliness of mind! And, thanks to Heaven! the magnet in the breast, That draws together sexes to be blest, Attracting, is attracted to the tone, Suited and most congenial to its own! SOLEMN MUSING IN A STORM. Mercy! what light'ning! and an afterclap So soon, excites an awful dread!âthe thought Of a hereafter!âan eternal world! Again! how instant, forky, terrible! It pierces to the very soul's recess With an electric shock. Dark glooms the sky; The rain loud patters on the roof; winds rush; And louder still a heavier deluge pours. As there exists a God who rules the storm; And as in him for mercy I confide; Why not as safe beneath the thunder's bolt, As guarded, as beneath the sun's mild beam? But what if he should take me hence at once? (As I am in his power, and at his will;) 'Twere but to speed the dart prepar'd for me; And, should it come to-day, it would but meet The present; ten years hence it would no more. A few successive objects in the mind, A few more pleasures, and a few more pains, Will make the future, with its products, then, As real as the present, now. Alas! And is there no exemption from the grave? With what a dread I yield to the decree! O! in the uttermost extremity, May he, the Just One, fill my soul with peace! His gift, of conscious solace to the soul, Supplants those fears which render man a slave; And come to him who has it, terror's king, Sooner or later, when, or where, or how, 'Twere ne'er amiss, as by the will divine. With all thy gifts and honors, what, O life! Is thy amount? 'Tis but a fragile hold Of a precarious tenure of abode, A transient durance of delight and pain. The former makes existence to be priz'd;â But doom'd, as some are, to perpetual wo, Within this bourne of care, and house of tearsâ Who, without hope of change, would wish to live? Ah! without hope of change, indeed who would? For in this irksome wilderness of time, Chok'd up and stinted in a barren soil, What plant can gain perfection? But with eye Fix'd on the future good, we overlook, Or views as trivial in comparison, The transient evils of the present life; While, for the pangs of mind which we endure, There is a cure at option. What is that?â A will resign'd, a trust in the Supreme; The sole substantial relish in the cup Of bitter sorrows. 'Tis a mental balm; A moral medicine; a peace in wo. Nought else can turn affliction into joy. Is there a man, a prey to deep distress, Void of that trust? What precept, what advice, Shall be administer'd? Forgetfulness? Alas! Philosophy? As well might one Talk to the reckless winds, as argue him Out of his grief for a lost child. Indeed, So inconsolable is he, it seems As if to temp'ral fondnesses he hung, As his salvation's hope. But there are souls, So merg'd within the will of the Supreme, So panoply'd against the shafts of time, They seem quite enter'd into rest this side The grave. With passions wean'd from earth, and thoughts Above the events of life, they have a source, A never-failing source, of joy divine. 'Tis Hope that thus attaches us to life, By promises more sweet than fancy's dreams Of bounteous bliss from fortune's casual turns. Advis'd by Prudence, on the plausive ground Of waiting for a prospect opportune, That Expectation may success ensure, We take a draft on Time. When due, the knave Declares it forgery. We make protest, Return the bill; when Hope, in smiling mien, Redeems her pledge, as is her usual wayâ In coin? Oh no! by bills new drawn on Time. We trust her still, and still to be deceiv'd. Thus, in pursuit of promises ne'er met,â Th' expense of protest, int'rest, postages, Augment the balance to a debt of chance, Till Expectation becomes bankrupted; Unless, as sometimes 'tis the case, kind Faith, In pity to the pensioners of time, Steps in between, and cancels the demand, By an exchange, at sight, upon the House Of Heaven. No longer a deceiver, Hope Becomes the comforter of pilgrims. On Her wings, she bears them o'er each miry place, To pleasant paths; and, at their journey's end, Wafts them as lightly as the mist of morn, O'er the dark vale and awful gulf of death.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ETHIC STRAINS, ON SUBJECTS SUBLIME AND BEAUTIFUL, IN THREE PARTS; AND MINOR POEMS. âPoetry is the nurse of elevated sentiment;âthe life and the soul of language:âits delineations are powerfully responded to by our sensibilities;âwe are naturally delighted with an art, which appeals to our dearest sensations;âand its triumph is the greatest, when it touches the master-chord of the heart, and leads the mind up to the great Source of all that is beautiful and sublime, attractive and majestic, in nature and in intellect.â London Investigator. ETHIC STRAINS. Part I. SECTION I. Love of Solitude. NOW begone, ye noisy powers! Quit my solitary hours; Leave my thoughts at my control, 'Tis the season of my soul! âHe who inclines to write, (says a celebrated German,) should enjoy undisturbed quietude. A person disposed to cultivate philosophy, or to court the muse, should be free from all embarrassment;âshould be at liberty to follow the impulses of his own mind, to change his situation when and where he pleases, and to obey the dictates of his taste and genius without restraint:âand he should watch for those propitious moments, when the mind pours forth its ideas, and the heart warms with the subject. Revived by cheerful prospects, and animated by noble sentiments, the soul, urged by contempt of difficulties, makes a powerful effort, and fine thoughts, in suitable expressions, flow spontaneously from the pen.â Hallow'd contemplations riseâ Man was made for brighter skies. When I nature's works explore, When beyond the stars I soar, When I seek the Source of Good, Wrapt in a seraphic mood; O! I love to be alone In a sacred haunt unknown! Oft has some enchanting power There beguil'd an anxious hour; Been my soul's congenial friend, When the world no aid could lend; Weaning me from love of pelf, Kindly whispering, âKnow thyself.â Like as if some spirit, nigh, Bade me seek a world on high. So I caught a heaven-ward musing, Inspiration that was soothing; Caught Devotion's hallow'd flame, Full of peace, devoid of shame: And many a blissful mood To thee I owe, sweet Solitude! But when duty calls from home, And the busy world I roam, O! I love, with great delight, Men to meet with hearts upright! But when dispos'd the spacious fields to range; Where rise rich prospects in continuous change! Where, stretch'd abroad in scenery ever new, Beauty and grandeur hail the raptur'd view; My heart dilates, enchanting thoughts control, It is a passion common to our species, to be delighted with every thing Sublime and Beautiful in Nature; as is thus observed by the amiable Cowper: ââThe love of Nature's works Is an ingredient in the compound man, Infus'd at the creation of the kind.â And of himself he says: ââThe country wins me still: I never fram'd a wish, or form'd a plan, That flatter'd me with hopes of earthly bliss, But there I laid the scene.ââ Again: âDelightful scenes, (says Mr. Addison,) whether in Nature, Painting, or Poetry, have a kindly influence over the body, and not only serve to clear and brighten the imagination, but are able to disperse grief and melancholy, and to set the animal spirits in agreeable emotions.â And wisdom holds communion with my soul. SECTION II. Invocation to Reason and RevelationâGod in the CloudâDivine Agency in NatureâThe Rainbow, a Benevolent Token. Come Reason, RevelationâO declare! Who form'd the plan, and fram'd the world so fair? Who garnish'd heaven's stupendous arch sublime, Spangled the night, and roll'd the wheels of time? Impress'd with wisdom nature's ample page, Or moves with winds the boundless ocean's rage? Whose skilful hand within its socket laid The visual orb, to see his works display'd? Or who inspir'd the human breast with soul, To feel his passing wonders as they roll? The Self Existent! Reason's voice replies: Th' Eternal Just One! Revelation cries. Grand from the deep he leads the glorious day; Summer and winter his decrees obey; The sky his pathway, showers about him blend, Seed-time and harvest on his steps attend. Unseen, he guides the countless worlds combin'd, Unfelt, illumes the vision of the mind; Excites the genius, wakes the social mood, And forms the moral taste to relish good. And who, like him (let guilty mortals dread!) Brings justice down upon the culprit's head? Convolv'd in awful gloom, he dwells alone And speeds the dart, accountable to none. Look nature through! his operations, there, His boundless power and wond'rous love declare! Now passing through the lowering skies, To execute his judgments just, How instant his red lightning flies! The rocks are rent, the mountains burst! Midst the brewing storms, Hark! his chariot comes! âAt this my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place. Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth out of his mouth. He directeth under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth.â The guilt-struck son of Adam quakes; Loud screams the hern along the shores; The beast in silence to his den betakes; In holy dread the heaven-born soul adores. Rumbling abrupt and loud, Through the dark mansions of yon sullen cloud, Tremendously it rolls, In broken peals, O'er brazen pavements onward to the poles. Earth a dreadful shuddering feels; Heaven's repeated flashes blaze; Thick'ning darkness broods about; Trembling the nations gaze; The skies come down, the winds come out. Hark! o'er hills and valleys round, Bursts a deep portentous sound! Ocean kindred horror hails, Boundless uproar now prevails! At length, on clouds of darkness roll'd along, A flash of glory seen by spells among, Awful to mortals! moves the Godhead by, And opens splendour in the western sky; Recalls the promise which of old he vow'd, And leaves his brilliant sign upon the cloud. Skirted with gold, thick vapours hang around; Earth smiles again, and jocund songs resound. The pond'rous clouds now having spent their power, And drench'd creation with a bounteous shower, How fresh, how cooling is the vital air! What an enchanting aspect all things wear! Was ever any spectacle so fine, As is that bow? so pleasingly divine? No wonder! there the smile of love we traceâ 'Tis a memorial of the God of Grace; A special manifest, that he will save Earth from a second deluge of the wave; And oft as that resplendent arch we see, It indicates the present Deity. What a condescending and benignant expression is the following communication to rebellious, unworthy man!ââAnd God said, this is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you, for perpetual generations. I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth. And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud; and I will remember my covenant, and the waters shall no more become a flood, to destroy all the earth.â How beautiful around the sky it bends! So, far and wide, the promis'd truth extends! What vivid colouring! can a mortal's art Paint like the sunbeam? speak so to the heart? Upon a vapour cast such magic grades, Or give his canvass such effect, such shades? Can any less than Heaven himself design A theme so rich, a moral so divine? Now his presence soothes our cares, Breathing softly cooling airs. Oft he sends enliv'ning beams, Scatters genial rains and dews, Scents the flower, and paints its hues, So that nature lovely seems. Thus, he quickens seed and root, Soft unfolds the blade and ear, Loads the branch with grateful fruit, Crowns with stores the rolling year. Rise, O man! in rapture, rise; Laud the Mighty, Holy, Wise All the wonders he has done, Loud proclaim him, Perfect One. SECTION III. Natural and Moral Evils, marvellousâNotice of some of their EffectsâInstability of Human Affairs, but Nature immutable in her PurposeâA Glance at the Condition of ManâFrom the Discovery of Deity in the Wisdom of Nature, Moral Truth suggested, and Reason assisted to form harmonious Conclusions. Yet, in the compass of this goodly frame, Much transient evil seems to sanction blame. What bright intelligence, ere sin began, Had thought of its existence in the plan? What peer in heaven, first told of such a scheme, Had deem'd it but the phantom of a dream? To think that God, who orders all things well, Should e'er permit his creature to rebel; When, if restrain'd, he might have stood sublime, And holy eyes ne'er seen the course of crime! Yet what distress, what complicated woes, Deaths in a thousand shapes, the bosom knows! Yet what disasters, in terrific forms, Invade the earth, and ride upon the storms! Lo! in the vegetive creation round, What noxious vermin give the mortal wound! The floweret wilts beneath the scorching ray; Nipt by the frost, the tender herbs decay; While plodding clouds hold council in the sky, To bid the winds in horrid uproar flyâ The winds obey, and, through the bladed grain, Impel with violence the torrent rain. So, human hopes, in every age and clime, Fortune oft baffles by the turns of time. In wiles she comes, with fascinating airs, Depicts the future, void of anxious cares, When, lo! her steps she turns, and, gone in haste, Frustrates vain hope, her visions all laid waste. But Nature, howe'er mutable she seems, Howe'er unfix'd, or partial in her schemes, One constant end pursues, throughout her plan, Her Author's glory in the view of man; And that which dark to purblind Reason seems, In Faith's bright vision glows with golden gleams. Through that fair medium all things glorious shineâ Good out of evil proves the scheme divine. Good out of evil! yes, and greater good, Than had the father of our species stood. Thence, most astonishing displays unfold, And Truth Divine illumes the moral world. Degen'rate man! exalted mortal proud! 'Midst ruins, great! for thee the Heavens have bow'd! Behold, the God on Calvary appears, The wonder of all worlds, the God in tears! Mercy display'd for criminals aloneâ None ever guilty, mercy never known! Wide now I see heaven's golden portals flung, From death to admit thee to th' immortal throng! And though on earth, till thy departure hence, Thy noble soul is held in bonds of sense; Yet, while the sun his tireless course pursues, And starry Night her natal song renews, Thy contemplation finds divine employ, Perception fills thy conscious soul with joy; Thy character unfolds, thy powers expand, By beauty charm'd, exalted by the grand; Around, above, astonishment impress'd, In earth and skies, the Deity confess'd. In contemplating this varied and wondrous creation, how many objects of interest and delight open to the view! Grandeur looks abroad from his lofty habitations, dwelling alone; while Beauty, walking with the Graces, smiles upon us from her lonely mansions. These fertile sources of pleasure, which so elevate the mind, or tranquillize the heart, are eminent emanations from the Invisible; and it is this glowing exhibition of the character of Divinity, which gives fire to admiration, rapture to devotion, and argument to theological science. Surrounded by such luminous displays of benign Wisdom, it seems as if the imposing idea of infinite perfection, were ready to burst from the spectator, as it were to gain relief only by figurative exclamation. Conscience, here, gains her first proud triumph; Reason, here, is first led, in accordance with internal dictate, to become a votary to ethic studies; and the human heart is here, like Felix, almost persuaded to believe. A single spark, from the divine altar, might perfect the illumination. If there be any thing which is almost religion, without its reality; what is it but an admiration of the Supreme, in the symbols of sublime beauty and ineffable harmony, exhibited on the face of the visible creation? Hence, Reason learns her moral truths to join, To trace relations to their Source Divine; From seeming discord and agreement fair, To draw conclusions all harmonious there; While from the scenes in varied prospect thrown, Emotion catches an immortal tone. SECTION IV. Influence of External Nature on the MindâInvitation to associate with Sublime and Beautiful ObjectsâImages of Fancy, by SimilitudeâPower of Imagination to retain, and to retrace her Perceptions. Lo! through her magazines, from grade to grade, From rolling systems, to the waving blade, Nature has power, conferr'd by Heaven above, The thoughts to captivate, and heart to move! With instantaneous force arrests the sense, And opens to perception scope immense; With vastness, danger, terror, unconfin'd, Absorbs the thought, and overwhelms the mind! Or, where her sprightly face shines deck'd in charms, She with a gentle flame the bosom warms; Detains the mental passes in control, Darts light and transport to the conscious soul; Adapts the taste, and, as her drift inspires, Forms genius to the relish of her fires. Lift, then, thy view, O man! thy fancy send, Rapt through the tracks of distance without end! Beyond where eye through optic glass can scan, Far, far beyond where orient light began, As rapid as the dart of thunder flies, Myriads of years, go see new worlds arise; Ponder the stretch'd-out realms of Nature's throne, Height, depth, expanseâan infinite unknown! With all thy powers the universe explore, And, in the boundless, lost, humbly adore! Make thyself smaller, as thy thoughts diverge, And in thy conscious nothingness grow large! The less thou seem'st in viewing infinite, The greater, in admiring what is great. But most within the bounds of sense, O man! Far as the view extends, creation scan; Associate with the vast of objects bold, Nor slight the scenes which wear a gentler mould. From splendid imagery o'er every clime, From beauty's impulse, to the touch sublime, Collect the stores, which fancy may command, To fire the genius, and the soul expand. All, all appears, by bounteous Heaven design'd, A magazine of glory for the mind; To furnish thought, the moral world adorn, To bring to birth capacities unborn; While conscious mem'ry's tablature retains What sense admits, and rumination gains. It seems to be the decided opinion of the moderns who have searched into the labyrinths of the human mind, that all our primary notions are derived through the avenues of the senses; there being no other inlet of communication, except by Inspiration. In which latter case, we perceive no image, but after the manner of some elementary similitude. We feel certain powerful impressions of a moral nature, which appertain to happiness or misery, in view of certain external qualities, though they never present any figure to the mind: such as wisdom, benevolence, design; or properties of moral turpitude; and, as we can have no idea of any thing which has never been exhibited to the sensitive faculties, the antiquated theory of innate knowledge, or intuitive perception, is of course unphilosophical. Thence in the scope of fancy's thoughtful sight, Rise images in visions of delight. So, in the lake's enchanting sky-lights glare, To sense appears a ground of emblems fair, The fleeting clouds, the moon, the stars that glow, Rocks, trees, and landscapesâa reflected show! What though thick darkness all creation fill! Imagination holds the world at will; Recals to mental day the scenes anew, Which, erst, have been depicted on the view; And wakes to exercise those nobler powers, Which caught vibration in departed hours. Stor'd in the mind, the blank ideas lay, Till brought to use, and cloth'd in bright array; Ideas are said to be images reflected on the mind, as on the back ground of a camera-obscura; but they have this additional advantage: Having once been impressed, they are retained in the magazines of memory, at the call of every associate emergency. And it is wonderful to think, what a countless variety of ideas the mind is capable of receiving, without obliterating or confusing previous impressions! If amidst the bustle and tumults of life, they get jostled and derang'd; yet, as in the glassy lake when its fluctuations have subsided, they return upon the view in vivid perspective. Hence, Genius, ruminating over his accumulated materials, appropriates to his use, as conception shall suggest, imagination select, and ingenuity adapt and adorn; and a work which should contain new, and useful, and beautiful ideas and combinations, though it exhibit no other knowledge than that which is already within the precincts of human discovery, were worthy of immortality. Recurring oft, they raise sublime desires, And wake in Virtue's cause the poet's fires. Rapt, at his bosom's altar, Genius sings, While Fancy strikes by spells the trembling strings. SECTION V. Survey of Sublime Prospects, with Reflections. Blest was my youth! in love of nature round, How I admir'd, o'er rocks, through bosky ground, To clamber up yon hill, that strikes the skies, And see abroad unbounded prospect rise! From east to west, afar, from pole to pole, Or where, around the sun, the planets roll, To send my raptur'd view, or thought sublime, And catch magnificence from every clime! âOf all the tracks of conveyance, which God has been pleased to open between the mind of man, and the theatre by which he is surrounded; there is none by which he so multiplies his acquaintance with the rich and varied creation, on every side, as by the organ of the eye. It is this which gives him his loftiest command over the scenery of nature. It is this which enables him, by the act of a simple moment, to send an exploring look over the surface of an ample territory, to crowd his mind with the whole assemblage of its objects, and to fill his vision with those countless hues which adorn creation.â Chalmers. Or when the sun had plung'd the western zone, And thousand splendours through the concave shone; What! (said my soul,) are all these globes that stray, Circling the solar orb with feeble ray; And all those suns, remote, of starry light, Which govern systems, out of human sight; Made, only made, at man by spells to peep, And wink his eye-lids to nocturnal sleep; Then, when earth's monarch shows his morning face, Retire in paleness, conscious of disgrace? Or seems it to imagination's eye, That they were made for candles to the sky, To light the messengers of heaven, (as elves,) Who by their own blest beams can light themselves? Oh, no! for wiser, nobler ends design'd, Methinks for glory of th' Eternal Mind, Analogous to fact, th' expanse unfolds, Fit mansions for probationary souls. But here I pause, and, with a deep-felt sense Of scanty knowledge, sink in ignorance: For, in the proudest march of human mind, Void of the light, must Science still be blind, And to the wand'rings of conjecture leave What she has no sent message to receive; Yet that exist, above this gorgeous roof, Mansions for mortals, there is ample proof; And while I hold the Bible in my hand, As on a rock, I on that fact will stand, And lift in faith my eye to Nature's throne, Though in that faith midst all the world alone. SECTION VI. A Glance at Ocean, a high Cliff, Torrent, Cataract, Alps in Switzerland, Mont BlancâAlexander of Russia, illuminated, and his Fame, by Comparison. Friends of the grand! ye who, in genius bold, Aspire to roam where lofty sights unfold; Go to yon vasty shore, and there see, driven, Old Ocean's breath along the skirt of heaven! See where, in tumult of tremendous waves, Unbounded uproar every region laves! See Heaven-taught Commerce, with her flag unfurl'd, In mighty triumph, sail around the world! Go see the huge, rough cliff's projecting head, Or, from stupendous heights, the river's bed! Go view the rain-swoln torrent spreading wide, With whelming fury its resistless tide! And, where the pond'rous cataract headlong pours, Stand all astonish'd, as it foams and roars! Lost in amaze, so stricken with the sight, Imbued with such a sense of grand delight; How would your souls, as 'twere almost divine, Stretch and expand for some august design; Some noble purpose, some achievement great, Resolv'd to rise above a paltry state! O! had you view'd the grandest scenes on earth, Or had you gain'd in Switzerland your birth; Enormous mountains, of prodigious height, Had rose sublime on your astonish'd sight! There, piles on piles, disdaining all below, Dwelling in mansions of eternal snow, With towering peaks, embolden'd as they rise, Touch heaven's high arch, and hail surrounding skies! Upon a like subject, Pope has given us an admirably fine description, in the following elegant and picturesque language:â âSo Zembla's rocks, the beauteous work of frost, Rise white in air, and glitter o'er the coast; Pale suns unfelt at distance roll away, And on th' impassive ice the lightnings play: Eternal snows the growing mass supply, Till the bright mountains prop th' incumbent sky; As Atlas fix'd, the hoary pile appears, The gather'd winter of a thousand years.â Some, ranging far, where mildly regions blend, Wrapt in dark woods, or, shagg'd with rocks, ascend; Gaps yawn abrupt, and gulfs, of awful depths, Surprise the trembling pilgrim as he steps. Meanwhile the vent'rous goat, ('tis wond'rous bow!) With instinct tread, walks safe on danger's brew. O'er frightful precipices torrents pour; The mountains deafen with eternal roar; Huge cliffs, contiguous, cragg'd with fragments vast, The sport of thunderbolts for ages past, Seize the dread view, and mock the fearful eye, As if inevitable death were nigh. All round, th' amazing vastness of the clime Strikes to the soul a terrible sublime. Midst awful silence, save, perchance, the noise Of some disruption falling from its poiseâ Who could behold, and not devoutly stand, Speechless, in contemplation of the grand? Who, while the heavens about his vision roll, That would not feel a glory of the soul? âCrown'd with eternal ice,â and distant far, Aloft and glittering like the morning star, Mont Blanc appears, adorn'd with earlier ray, His foot immers'd in night, his head in day; As if induc'd, for some momentous cause, He alter'd time, averse from general laws. Nay, while the sun in seas his visage laves, By men unseen, so plung'd beneath the waves; As if, intent upon a glorious name, He day forestall'd, to gain eternal fame. For while the lagging rear of sable night, Broods o'er surrounding Alps, and bars the light, Mont Blanc, It is said this mountain is so high, that it catches the beams of the morning, twenty minutes earlier, and retains them twenty minutes later, than the surrounding Alps. âCrowned with eternal ice,â it may be seen, purpled with eastern light, and crimsoned with western glory, from an immense distance; while mist and obscurity rest on the mountains below.â uplifting his stupendous brows, Beholds the morning and reflects her glows. Sublimely thus, above his peers around, The Monarch of the north, with glory crown'd, While o'er his empire mental darkness reigns, Raises to heaven his eye, and light obtains; Looks down in smiles upon his fellow race, Of humbler rank, but not too low for grace; Extends abroad his elevated views, And opes a moral dayspring on the Jews. On him the nations gaze with wond'ring eyes, And spread his fame, exalted to the skies. He turns to all, preserves the general peace; The desert blossoms, villages increase; Beneath his fostering care his empire grows; Fair Science blooms, benignant Arts disclose; And, by the sanction of his glorious name, The sacred Scriptures gain extended fame. Such is the man! who shines where Peter shone; By noblest virtues he adorns the throne, Befriends the Conscience, frees the Christian slave, And sends glad tidings o'er the distant wave! Joy bless his days! the best which Heaven bestows; Immortal honours crown his royal brows! Prosper'd of Heaven, must Gospel Truth unfold, Till moral beauty renovate the world. SECTION VII. Diffusion of Divine TruthâBlessed be the Missionaries! Lo! since th' immortal Bard, from Israel sprung, Sublime of Chaos and Creation sung; Down through the stream of years glides smooth along, From age to age, the soul-inspiring song; Far distant nations, still unknown to fame, And sons unborn, shall catch the glowing flame! So shall the Gospel, through the bourne of time, Her voice resound with sacred charm sublime; From soul to soul her forceful precepts run, Convict the conscience, melt the heart of stone; Salvation spread through vasty realms afar, To darkling worlds, each messenger a star; The clouds disperse before the morning gold, In gladly light the moral day unfold; Till every soul be taught alike to move To the sweet impulse of celestial love. Then shall the beauty of the mind, like morn, Brighten to smiles, and every look adorn; No more the springs of hateful passions start, But angel-kindness thrill from heart to heart; Through every clime new streams of bliss take rise, Till earth be all a perfect Paradise. O bless'd be they! whose charitable souls Unite to send glad tidings to the poles! O highly bless'd, the Missioners inspir'd, By truth illumin'd, by benev'lence fir'd, Who traverse sea and land, with scroll unfurl'd, To sound the glorious Gospel through the world; To sow the field, a pleasing, arduous toil, The Word the seed, the human soul the soil! Zion! exalt thy head, with joyful ray, And see the dawn of the millenial day! Source of all love! O call the Chosen home, And let the Kingdom of the Saviour come! Part II. SECTION I. MornâApostrophe to NatureâImagined Efforts under other Circumstances. The dayspring now in yon glad east appears, And vernal songs congratulate our ears; Soft gleamings through the firmament expand, And scenes obscure grow luminous o'er land. Hail, Nature! marvellous, sublime, and fair! Thy magic charm what poet can declare? What genius represent thee as thou art? So move the mind, so captivate the heart? I cannot; yet, inspir'd my voice to raise, Fain would I, wrapt in wonder, chant thy praise. O! had I talents, leisure, books, and friends, Or inspiration that to Heaven ascends; I would attempt, with utmost grace and art, To please the fancy, and improve the heart! From critic laws absolved of frigid men, Elicit beams, like lightning, from the pen! In effervescence of the mind, With apt expression's force inspir'd, Exhibit nature, well-defin'd, And press her moral on the soul! As when some Painter, fir'd, Seizes the pencil, nigh, Portrays his vision to the eye, And bids sublime emotion roll! So, with superb description fraught, The pen should give conception form, The figure of the thought, The words should glow, the sentiment should warm. Alas! with such a sterile genius born, Should I perchance a transient thought adorn; I boast notâcovet not vain-glorious fame, For who can find a substance in a name? Vapid! illusive as the viewless air! 'Tis nought, unless intrinsic worth be there! Some, virtue place in deeds conform'd to rule; 'Twere better, first, to fix it in the soul; For, though an act overt produce no ill, It may be void of goodness in the will. Nay, though a thousand acts benev'lent seem, The heart may not with worthy motive teem. Man, as a complex being, is animal, rational, and moral. Understanding, conscience, and will, constitute him a free, responsible agent. Merely as an animal, he possesses many affable affectionsâhandmaids at the door, though they are frequently taken as tenants, of the moral department. In the fashionable world, they pass under the character, and receive the appellation, of moral virtues; and, as messengers of the outer court, they are truly amiable; though they can never be communicants at the divine altar above, but under the conduct of a guest, who has something to recommend her above the common sympathies of nature: I mean Religion; whose every aspect and action are tinctured with a glow of benevolence. SECTION II. Effects of Pleasant ProspectsâGood HumourâRural WalkâDescriptions in which several Beautiful Objects are noticedâA perched Bird, singing; Ascending Vapour; An Eagle circling the Skies. But, though I wander here and there too long, Indulgent Reader! still attend my song! In all the richness of the noon of year, When o'er the landscape countless hues appear, What graceful scenes in sightly contrast rise! New charms, unfolding, strike one with surprise; And what surprises has its due controlâ It leaves its force upon the thinking soul. What sweet sensation, what delight refin'd, A pleasant prospect spreads about the mind? Lo! where the scene in native beauty dwells, Or where the landscape, deck'd by art, excels; The gentle breast admires its like to own, And e'en the dull imbibes a cheerful tone! A placid radiance brightens in the face; So evening glides a darkling cloud with grace. But, lo! in fancy's brilliant eye I see, Yonder, a woodland nymph of liberty! All-hale she seems, the ruddy child of morn, Mid sportive airs and smiling prospect born;â Her eye all soul, her look all charm, Methinks she might a stoic warm; For sprightly thoughts and frankness fam'd, I know the nymphâGood Humour nam'd! The spring-tide rapture taught her breast to thrill, She learn'd her converse from the vocal rill, Stole from the waving woods her manners dear, And caught her pity from the willow's tear. Pleas'd, through the scented lawn and shadowy grove, Cheer'd by the songs of birds, she loves to rove; And what is beautiful in every scene, 'Livens her mind, and luminates her mien. Come, then, fair Virgin! let the smiling dawn Invite our footsteps o'er the dewy lawn, Where we may hear the wild-trill'd music roll, And welcome nature's charm upon the soul. The great Milton thus beautifully observes, âIn those vernal seasons of the year, when the air is soft and pleasant, it were an injury and sullenness against Nature, not to go out and see her riches, and partake of her rejoicings with heaven and earth.â See the rapt warbler! perch'd upon an elm, With dulcet strains he greets the neighb'ring realm! How he exalts his head! his throat he fillsâ Sight's charm'd with beauty, earls charm'd with trills! Come let us trace the gentle stream along, And list the little cherub's wildering song! Then, from yon airy height upon the green, Explore with transport the surrounding scene! Delighted sit beneath o'erhanging shade, As 'twere with souls for mutual converse made, Till ebb'd emotion swell into a tide, As we behold the prospect, far and wide! Here, through the flowery vale, a streamlet flows; Fair as the morn, its glassy bosom glows; There, rolls a river through luxuriant lands, Still further on, a silver lake expands; Around, all-beauteous nature opes to sight The softest, sweetest, aspects of delight; Greens level spread, or rise in graceful slopes; Trees stand alone, or gather into groups; The corn-blade triumphs o'er the fertile plain; Far waves the glory of the golden grain; While scatt'ring kine, enliv'ning all the scene, The pastures range, or graze along the green; And here and there, with a neat cottage crown'd, The smoothly waving hills rejoice around; While, half-embosom'd in yon circling bowers, White with fair streams, and deck'd with fruits and flowers, A lovely village, glistening to the rays, Lifts its bright spire to Heaven in grateful praise. But, lo! beneath yon hillock's verdant brink, Where, bending, stoops the thirsty steed to drink, How beautiful yon rising vapour seems, Its bosom glowing to the lucid beams! Slow-upward on the viewless air serene Its spiral folds in fleecy swells are seen; It moves upon the balmy-breathing air, Like Mercy, wing'd from Heaven to sooth despair. So, in a clear and tranquil winter-morn, When air is dense, and snows the ground adorn, Emerging smoke from chimney's top ascends, And, in a lengthen'd foam, convolving blends: Perhaps first rising through some green-crown'd wood, Not far from where our native cottage stoodâ Beauteous its towers! a volume white as frost, Till in the vast expanse of ether lost. Thus a smooth streamlet's fair pellucid tide Steals soft along with sweetly-winding glide, Its bosom burnish'd by the sapphire sky, A soothing surface to the gazing eye! Reflected from its crystal glare serene, Surrounding objects in reverse are seen; Except where ruffling down its rocky bed, Straight it descends into a level spread; Wide, and more wide, a broader course it laves, Till mix'd with ocean's all-o'erwhelming waves. Now, 'mongst the rustling groves, the zephyrs play; Inconstant, as in fits, they rest or stray; Oft they suspend their hasty course to hear The falling rivulet that babbles near; Then, starting instant, make a murm'ring noise; The mountain nods, the vale is full of joys; In all her virgin-prime, and blooming wreathes, With vernal sweetness Nature perfume breathes; At length, grown grave, she drops her gaudy suit, Ripens her seed, and fills her branch with fruit; Refresh'd meanwhile, by genial suns and rains, Till, rich with gold, she crowns the joyous plains. Lo! how the cluster'd grapes, in purple pride, Hang in festoons upon the mountain-side! Or on the slender tendrils of the vine, That loves the hedge to hug, or bush to twine! I turn my view, and, every where around, See loaded August bending to the ground! As from his fields the farmer homeward goes, With grateful thoughts his ardent bosom glows. The charm still reigns:âOn yonder hill-side green, What various kine, what numerous flocks are seen! With greedy mouths some crop the tender blade; Reposing, some enjoy the cooling shade; Some pensive loiter; some, in sportive mood, Race o'er the ground, pursuing and pursued;â While, just emerg'd from desert woods alone, Whither she, wand'ring from the plain, had gone, Upon a distant height a heifer lows; With head uplift, a handsome form she shows; Along the winding basement of the hill, A dark-grey courser stoops to drink his fill; A thousand bleating sheep are scatter'd round, The welkin rings, the solitudes resound. The landscape, all alive upon the slope, Presents to view a most enchanting scope. So seem the forms, by mimic Art portray'd, Beauteous illusions, mingling glare and shade! Lo! perch'd upon a pointed rock on high, A royal eagle darts around his eye! Mute he remains, or screams aloud by spells, And frightens Silence in her lonely cells. O! 'tis a spectacle surpassing fair, When, wing'd aloft, he swims the liquid air! As late I view'd him in his soaring flight, The boundaries of nature in his sight, Lo! he kept lessening to my gazing eyes, Till he had form'd a spire that reach'd the skies! I mark'd my object as he smaller grew, Till gone and lost from admiration's view. Had man such buoyant wings, I said, he soon, Perch'd on her hills, would hail the social moon; Thence, in his rapt aspirings, waft his flight To stars remote, or to the verge of light. Thus vagrant were my live imaginings, Till Reason woke, and Fancy dropt her wings. SECTION III. Evening. There is a time in nature's round, When earth appears enchanted ground;â A seasonâO divinely fair! A time to heavenly musing due, When objects soften on the view, And Meditation loves to wander there;â 'Tis when the day's departing close Looks from the west in golden gleams, And gilds the lake with gorgeous glows, While nature round like Eden seems;â 'Tis in that stealing, soothing pause, When gentle birds, the fields along, Have ceas'd to trill the vesper-song, While evening mild her curtain draws, Shadowy, serene, and cool, And Labour drops the tool;â 'Tis when the harmonies of light and shade Meet on the hill, and overspread the glade;â 'Tis then that scen'ry in its softness lies, And, 'mongst the clouds, aerial visions rise. âThere are occasionally, in summer and autumn, such magical effects, such a universal tone of brilliant colouring, that the very air seems tinged, and an aspect of such harmonious splendour is thrown over every object, that the attention of the most indifferent is awakened, and the lovers of the beautiful in nature enjoy the most lively delight. These are the kind tints which the matchless pencil of Claude vainly endeavoured to imitate. They occur a few times in every year, a little before sunset, and under a particular state and position of the clouds.â See Let. on East. States. Faint, and more faint, suffus'd with dusky grey, Their dubious aspects slowly die away, Till darkness, ever faithful to fulfil Nature's great law, comes brooding o'er the hill. Wide spreads the sable curtain of repose, And grants the world oblivion to her woes. Part III. SECTION I. MornâAn Ocean-SceneâSublime TempestâIts deliberate Preparations, and dread Pause, previous to its Onset.âTerrible Appendages, and woful Catastrophes.âThe Tempest Moralized. NOW over hill-tops, first in streaks of grey, Then ting'd with gold, appears the morning ray. On the dark rolling of yon dreadful tides, Glad of the dawn, a labouring vessel rides; Her men on deck in observation stand, And, long depriv'd, rejoice to see the land. Each tender thought, which absence more refines, Each home-bred fondness, rises in their minds. At length a scud, like geese before a storm, Flits swift athwart the sky its dragon-form. The conscious mariner, with warning call, As if alarm'd, cries out, A squall! a squall! Lo! from the deep abyss, with awful brows, His head above the hills the tempest shows! Vast, solemn, slow, in threat'ning aspect dress'd, Black clouds, advancing, darken all the west! Like mountains, pile on pile, they lowering rise, And grumble through the chambers of the skies! In warlike forms, they rank and file display, And forward move in âterrible array.â Brewing their thunder, they convolving foam, And roll into themselves in angry gloom. To give new strength and impulse to her laws, Nature withholds her winds in solemn pause. The scales are pois'd; the skies collect their force, Deliberate in scowls, and change their course. At length, on wings of saffron hue outspread, They cast o'er earth a lurid-yellow shade. Lo! what an awful stillness reigns around! From yon dark woods comes a portentous sound. On hold of mortals dire forebodings take, Heaven nods, earth trembles, despots, nations quake. As when uncommon roaring of the waves, Reverberates o'er rocks, and woods, and caves; So comes the blast, with hollow-murm'ring noise, Houses upsets, and nature's face destroys. It comes, it comes! in whirls the gust appears, And strikes old Ocean with tumultuous fears! In flames it comes! impetuous, wild, and strong, And, mix'd with sulphur, bears the hills along! The concave, thick'ning, glooms upon the vale, âAnd heaven descendsâ in cataracts of hail. Still rush the winds, and, with tremendous force, Spread awful devastation in their course; The forest groans; upturn'd, it prostrate lies, Or, seiz'd by whirls, in wild confusion flies. Cities demolish'd, sacred temples, torn, Aloft upon the reckless blasts are borne;â Madly the tempest raves; still rough and strong, Bursts o'er the strand, and, howling, drives along; Rash in its onset, furious in its sweep, And spends its vengeance on the boundless deep. The mountain-billows flee before the gust, While down from heaven o'erwhelming torrents burst. Toss'd here and there, the ship unmasted rolls, First strikes the skies, and next the fatal shoals. Upon the roaring flood and howling air, Resound wild exclamations of despair; While mariners, long us'd the sea to brave, Contend in vain, ingulf'd beneath the wave. Great Nature's works, by Nature's self repuls'd; Air, water, land, by heat and cold convuls'd; Dread omens rise; wide-belching Etna boils, And earthquakes rumble o'er a thousand worlds. Down mountains fall; vast empires are no more; Realms sink to seas, the seas extend their shore; Earth yawning wide, pale ghosts their graves forsake, Spectators scream, and Nature's mansions shake! So in the mind, since moral ill began, Passion produces dire effects on Man. By mad ambition mov'd, or vengeful ire, His wrath elicits, like the lightning, fire; Scorns rankle in his breast, to broils a prey; No reason he will hear, no law obey; Rage fires his brain;âfurious, he headlong goes, To wreak unhallow'd vengeance on his foes. Fierce anger anger meets, death's darts are hurl'd, And ruthless war depopulates the world. SECTION II. Other Objects Moralized. But other objects picturesque the mind;â Where'er we turn our eyes, some scene we find, Some striking scope, or movement of control, Adapted to the structure of the soul. The social flames, those bland endearments warm, Are but reflected Nature's soothing charm; And great exploits, to which mankind attain, Are nature's grandeur acted o'er again. On this subject, a much celebrated Rhetorician has remarked: âThere are two great classes of moral qualities; one the high and great virtues, which require extraordinary efforts, and is founded on dangers and sufferings; as heroism, magnanimity, a scorn of pleasures, and the contempt of death. These produce, in the spectator, an idea of sublimity and grandeur. The other class is chiefly of the social virtues, and such as are of a softer and gentler kind; as compassion, mildness, and generosity. These excite in the beholder a sensation of pleasure so nearly allied to that by beautiful objects, that, though of a more exalted nature, it may, without impropriety, be classed under the same head.â That godlike courage that admires to brave Perils and death, is seen in Ocean's wave; And in the gloom amidst the lightning's glareâ Look! see'st thou not a grisly anger there? Revenge is like the whirlwind; wizard spleen In the bleak-whining, sullen blast is seen; And like the moon, in chambers of the cloud, Mopes, in her cell, the maid of dismal mood. All scenes have sway, peculiar to their kind,â Great Nature is the prototype of Mind! But there's a haunt of which the Poets tell, Where, lorn, the pensive hermit loves to dwell; âIt is an instinct common to all persons of sensibility, under a pressure of calamity, to seek shelter in places the wildest and most deserted; as if rocks were bulwarks against misfortune; or as if the calmness of nature could compose the troubles of the soul.â Paul and Virginia. Where, all devote, a reverential flame Absorbs the soul,âa heaven-aspiring frame! 'Tis in thick woods and solitary shades, Where silence reigns, and antient gloom pervades; Where every object, of an awful kind, To hallow'd contemplation wakes the mind. Hark! frequent there, to echo's lonely cells, His woes the bird of blood-spot bosom tells! The tones of the turtle Dove, while evolving his varied melody, are exquisitely mournful and pathetic; and, with the idea of this blood-red spot upon his breast, there, associates a sentiment that is mystically affecting. During the spring months, the male bird exhibits such a spot, nearest his heart, which regularly disappears on the approach of summer, and does not return again, but with the months of love. See St. Pierre's Stud. Nat. Hark! frequent, when the mournful bird is dumb, The distant partridge rolls his breezy drum; At frequent intervals, the raven moans, And, sounding from afar, the desert groans: Some moulder'd trunk perhaps, that, like a tower, Falls from its thousand years, to rise no more; As if impressing one with dismal dread, A shock had rent the mansions of the dead; Combustion-like, that, fir'd by Nature's laws And loud exploding, leaves an awful pause. In such drear cells, such desolate domains, O'er pensive souls a sacred horror reigns. To such abodes immortal seers have turn'd, And, frequent there, devotion's flame has burn'd;â Sublime, like Night, the melancholy mood There soars to heaven on wings of solitude. SECTION III. Effects of the Sublime, other than of Fear. Struck and astonish'd as I lingering pause On scenes sublime, arrested by their laws; That is grand and sublime, (says Longinus,) which the more we consider, the greater ideas we conceive of it: whose force we cannot possibly withstand; which immediately sinks deep, and makes such impressions on the mind, as cannot be easily worn out or effaced. (Though, says my soul, there's something awful here,) Dost think there's no sensation but of fear? Rapt at the view, with vast conception fraught, Dilated with amazement at the thought; Of self forgetful, eager to embrace Expansion, boundless as the realms of space; Feels not the mind a something still more dear, Than selfish, grovelling, soul-debasing fear? Is there no flame, as lofty Fancy soars, That seems devout?âa passion that adores? When the young peasant, from some towery height, Bends o'er the brink, and trembles at the sight; Or looks aloft to some huge rock's grey brow, That hangs with horror o'er the vales below; Starts he not back, at the first view afraid, Chill'd at the sight, and at the thought dismay'd? And when to consciousness his reason wakes, Mov'd by suggestions which reflection makes, Trusting in this, that God is everywhere, Does not a sense of his preserving care, Drive dread away, and, with a soothing wile, Soften the brow of terror to a smile? For nought inspires with pleasing awe the soul, Like a firm, tranquil trust in Heaven's control. SECTION IV. Instances of the Moral Sublime in a Mariner, and in the Poet. Once, on the boundless ocean's rocky shore, Where mountain-billows burst, and foam, and roar; I scaled a cliff that frown'd with awful pride, Hundreds of feet above the dashing tide. A ship appear'd:âat helm the Captain, brave, With front undaunted, plough'd the heaving wave. Fearless, midst threat'ning deaths, on either hand, He boldly steer'd betwixt the rocks and sand. Alas! 'twas where a noble ship was toss'd, And every soul, except the mate was lost. There, where the bluff and pond'rous surges broke, I, since, have heard the groanings of the rock; And many frightful voices seem'd to rise, From midst the surf, resembling human cries; Mixt with some hideous bird's lorn scream of wo, Which rent, at intervals, the blustering blow; As if some person, plung'd in black despair, Call'd out for help, when no relief was there; And seeing round him horrid perils press, Utter'd by spells his agoniz'd distress; Till, sudden dash'd against a ledge, aghast, He breath'd his life out to the howling blast. As, late, I drew my boat upon that shore, Close to that fatal reef and awful roarâ 'Twas dustâI heard the spirit of the storm, And thought I saw, 'mongst mists, his shapeless form. Like the red moon, obscur'd, his visage seem'd; From where his hand should be, a meteor gleam'dâ Darkness came down, clouds lower'd with aspect dire, And, rous'd to fury, Ocean foam'd with fire. Phantoms beset me round:âas conscience knows, Chill tremours, dreadful apprehensions rose. Sudden, a huge, tall shape, to my surprize, Black as old Chaos, came before my eyes; Stood, mov'd, or seem'd, direct athwart my path, And frown'd upon me with terrific wrath. Fear seiz'd my hair; my creeping blood ran cold; Aghast I stood, till horror made me bold. Fear is one of the most powerful passions of our species. Originating from an apprehension of imminent danger, there is no other which so paralyzes effort, so disconcerts the sober exercise of the rational faculties. It produces effects upon the whole system; such as paleness, trembling, smiting of the knees, erection of the hairs of the head. Some of these symptoms are thus awfully described in the Book of Job: âIn thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men, fear came upon me and trembling, which made all my bones to shake. Then a spirit passed before my face. The hair of my flesh stood up.ââThere appears to have been a great excitement here, and a consternation, such as we might expect every degenerate son of Adam would feel, on a like occasion. But, if the mind be agitated by extreme fear, and conceive herself in great peril, without a possibility of escape; then, indeed, driven to utter desperation, she will assume a most terrible courage. At such a juncture, every pusillanimous feeling rises into a fortitude, that despises danger, and banishes even the dread of death. Forth I advanc'd, regardless of my doom, When flash'd his livid eye-balls through the gloom. Then on a cloud he, hovering round me, came, And thousand horrors thrill'd through all my frame. Instant a heaven-sent impulse seiz'd my hand; I grasp'd a monstrous club upon the strandâ A foe thou art, I said;âthy looks are grim, Is not a friendly spirit thin, pale, dim? But thou art hateful as despair, Thou goblin of ill feature! Ugliest creature, In water, earth, or air! Who art thou, then, Of ghastly mein? âGuardian of Night!â (a sullen voice reply'd:) But why obstruct my path? (I cry'd:) Did ever I disturb Night's course? âAvoid my frown!â (he answer'd hoarse.) I fear thee not, (I said,) Thou gloomy shade! Thou think'st the brave to fright, And art thyself afraid of light. Wrapt in thy sombrous robe, Thou roam'st each dreary waste A vagabond forlorn, A haunted ghost about the globe, Scared at th' approach of morn, Forever running, and forever chased. So keep thy course, (I cry'd,) nor tempt my stroke;â Heaven wields my arm, and durst thou Heaven provoke? Raising my weapon, I advanc'd a pace,â When, lo! the spectre mov'd before my face! Stopp'd, as I stood, with seeming fury fir'd, But, as he saw me resolute, retir'd. Slowly he rose, and, gathering into poise, Departed on a whirlwind with a noise. SECTION V. Moral Sublime in David. Fain would I bring to admiration's view, A youth as brave, as ever mortal knewâ The stripling David:âdauntless and alone, With what a godlike dignity he shone! Behold Goliah proudly stalks abroad; The mountains tremble at his haughty nod; With scoffing threats, in his gigantic might, He keeps the ranks of Israel in affright;â No practis'd warrior durst engage the foe; Rich gifts are proffer'dânone has heart to go. At length the lad, scorning the Giant's boasts, Steps bravely forth midst all the trembling hosts, So when the king of beasts, with onset bold, Enter'd, and took a lambkin from the fold; The gallant youth in generous anger rose, And sought his royal majesty with blows. As from the stroke the monster felt the wound, He fell; earth shook; it thunder'd from the ground. The victor then caught hold upon the beast, And from his mouth the trembling lamb releas'd The beast still rose; the youth advanc'd, prepar'd, And seiz'd his awful presence by the beard. Smote him anew, inflicting mortal pain, And laid him smoking on the gory plain. So by that Boy, the proud Philistine fell; He ceas'd to scoff,âhe ceas'd with pride to swell:â The youth, advancing, drew the Giant's blade, And sever'd from the trunk his horrid head. In raptur'd shouts the joy of hosts arose, And Israel's sons pursu'd their scattering foes. SECTION VI. Washington crossing the DelawareâHis parting SceneâNews of his deathâHis Character, a Prototype to future years. Nor let me pass our Country's Boast unsung, When through the flood he led his valiant throng. Above where Trenton roll'd his swollen tide, Advancing forth upon the river-side, He stood:âCold, dark, eventful, was the night, Deep, wide, and rapid, roll'd the current's mightâ He saw the perilous scene, the flood survey'd, Scann'd its dimensions, circumstances weigh'd; Still held his purpose to surprise the foe, To cross the stream, and strike the fatal blow. General Washington crossed the Delaware on the night of the twenty-fifth of December, 1776, and, at day-break, marched down to Trenton. He completely surprised the enemy, who finding themselves surrounded, and, seeing that they must inevitably perish by further resistance, laid down their arms. Twenty-three officers, and eight hundred and eighty-six men, after thirty or forty Hessians had been killed, submitted. Captain Washington and five or six other Americans were wounded. The night on which they crossed the Delaware was remarkable for the severity of the cold, and a violent storm of hail. See H. Adam's History. Then, with commanding words and noble soul, He orders gave to stem the torrent's roll. Impossible! his comrades, as they gaz'd, Beheld a thousand deaths, and stood amaz'd. The chief, undaunted, soon dispels their fears, Impossible then possible appears. Now having brav'd the flood, and gain'd the land, Though small their numbers, yet a vet'ran band; They under covert of the night mov'd down, Surpris'd the camp, and soon possess'd the town. So through the war, intent upon success, He danger scorn'd, he rose above distress; Firm as a rock amidst th' assaults of time, Or, like Mont Blanc midst thunders, stood sublime. Great was the soul of him the Poet sings; He lives in rhyme above the rank of kings. Now when the joyful news of peace had come, And the glad sons of arms look back on home. His object gain'd, he left the battle-ground, And gather'd his brave band of brothers round. Affecting scene! a tender, manly grief, Deep-labouring in his breast, o'erpower'd the chief. âI cannot go (he said) to each of you, But come to me;âI bid you all adieu.â Knox grasp'd his hand, and melted into tears: So each in turn, and each o'erwhelm'd appears. Thus they, all speechlessâsome to meet no more, Until arriv'd upon th' eternal shore. The favourite now of the free people's choice, Elected twice with no dissenting voice, He who, in war, was greatest of the great, But kept the peace and dignity of state. Without a kingdom, and without a crown, Clad in his own bright splendour, how he shone! At length, o'erwhelm'd, the nation is in tears:â No more on earth great Washington appears! When the sad tidings came, each patriot cry'd, Alas! my country!âsilent stoodâand sigh'd! âAll cover'd o'er with glory,â lo! he sleeps, Where, yearning o'er the spot, rest freedom weeps! As ye draw near the hallow'd ground, ye brave! Speak softly, and âtread lightly o'er his grave!â Ho! all ye Fathers, who respect the great, Instruct your sons his name to venerate! Shall not renown, that so deserv'd appears, Become a prototype to distant years? As when an object vast attracts the sight, And lifts our admiration to its height; While pondering on its wondrous force, impress'd, We feel a moral grandeur in the breast; Shall not the free-born Sons of future time, Catch his great soul, and grow, like him, sublime? SECTION VII. Character of Alphonzo. But there's a character in fancy's eye, With whom each generous breast may wish to vie. Exulting o'er the prospects of the clime, Enrich'd, expanded, with the flight of time, O'er nature round, in transports of surprize, Alphonzo casts his piercing, gazing eyes. Struck at first view, he kindles with her fires, Glows as she glows, and feels as she inspires; In mem'ry's haunts depicted scenes remain; What sense admits is intellectual gain; To visual scope, the charms of landscape glow, Or, absent, wake to fond reflection's view; Taste grows accomplish'd, sentiment refin'd; The noblest passions blossom in the mind. Reason attends, and Genius, grac'd by Art, And Truth divine, the favourite of his heart; They deck his brows with marks of noble birthâ There's scarce a lovelier character on earth. On him propitious Heaven had laid her claim; Glad to his soul ethereal beauty came;â He chang'd his views, his partial schemes gave o'er, Surpris'd, that in Religion there was power. He knew the joys which heavenly gifts impart, Best proof he had, he felt them in his heart. Now virtuous prov'd, and train'd in Wisdom's school, His will is subject to the golden rule; With humble confidence and godly fear, The vital precept he delights to hear; To hang with ecstacy on Mercy's voice, Walk in her light, and in her smile rejoice; While in his breast the Christian graces move, And the whole Human Species share his love. Nay, when insulted, (for 'tis oft the case, That Virtue's self is malic'd by our race,) With open aspect, calm and self-possess'dâ (No servile fear arising in his breastâ) O! how he shines! too noble and serene, To let a vengeful thought disturb his mien! Scorns from his soul to render blow for blow, But wakes the stifled conscience of the foe. It is awell founded remark, that he who surrenders himself to the dominion of disorderly passion, is so much the less possessed of rationality. Every evil bias and every erroneous conception is then enlsted against the evidence of truth, and all the sober faculties of the soul are absorbed in one overwhelming feelingâthat of selfishness, rendering its possessor contemptible. âWe call him a forgiving character, (says the amiable Melmoth,) who passes over with impunity an affront or injury in social life; but to resist giving blow for blow, when the temptation to recriminate lies fairly open, is thought to be the sublimest effort of human excellence.â To this fine observation, I may be permitted to add, that he who retains a perfect command of himself on such an occasion, and improves the opportunity of soothing the irritation of his antagonist, and of restoring him to the influence of reason and conscience, puts that excellence to the sublimest use. Although vile Slander, with a noxious breath, Like midnight Eurus, blow the blast of death; Though Envy charge him with egregious faults, He stands sublime amidst the world's assaults. Like Ocean's rock that lifts its dauntless form, He casts aside the terrors of the storm. Faultsâhe has fewâwhat son of earth has none? His only are as spots upon the sun; Lost midst the beams his character displays, But, through a darkling medium, seen with ease. âOne views all objects (says a perspicacious Author) through a prism: many contemplate virtue through a diminishing, and vice through a magnifying medium.â In accordance with this just and elegant remark, how very common it is, for the sentiments and opinions of men, to be warped aside from truth and fairness by the influence of prejudice and passion! Scandal for instance, rooted in the soil of malice, has grown rank and exuberant in the human breast, ever since the deplorable lapse of our progenitors. Some trivial failing, from which no one is exempt, is often grossly exaggerated, while the merit and splendour of virtue are, in like manner, extenuated and obscured. Such tokens evince a depraved spirit, or the influence of a detestable habit. And since, as Human is not all divine, Defects, in contrast, make perfection shine; Fauls which a generous eye would scarce perceive, Are crimes an evious soul can ne'er forgive. Nay, him indeed, whose walk is least in blame, The sland'rous tongue tries mostly to defame; But, having learn'd his passions to disarm, Virtue alone can shield his breast from harm: And 'tis the happiest art he ever knew, To make his life bespeak reproach untrue. In views upright, no ever-haunting elf, No keen upbraiding rankles in himself;â Establish'd in his soul's essential cause, Him, nature's God, and his own conscience, awes. By fortune cast on life's tumultuous wave, In hope or fear, he poises, justly brave; His heart his compass, and the truth his pole, His eye on Heaven, he stems the boisterous roll; Avoids the fatal coast where Sirens hail, Where strong the gulf-stream sets, he crowds all sail; His mind at helm, with one grand end in view, Though winds with clouds, and clouds with tempests, brew. THE END.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">No. II. ââMuch yet remains Unsung, and many cares are yet behind, And more laborious.ââ ââSedulous I seek to improve, At least neglect not, nor leave unemploy'd, The mind.ââ Cowper. MORAL EVIL NO ACCIDENT. A POEM. IN TWO PARTS. I write for those, who are willing to endure the irksomeness of metrical composition for the sake of sentiment, as well as for the true lovers of poetry. Among the latter, there seems to be a diversity of opinion, as to rhyme and blank verse; but no admirer of poetic diction, can have any reasonable objection to either, when animated with the fire of genius, and confined to its proper subject. In the present instance, blank verse is undoubtedly the most appropriate; and that I might render my sentences facile and perspicuous, I have paid particular attention to their construction and modulation. Aware, however, that the leading sentiments may be unsavoury to the palates of some, I am satisfied they will be quite agreeable to the tastes of others. But, if I have failed in justice to my subjects, (and I acknowledge my deficiency,) the Poem may, at least, be considered as an outline of a system, the several parts of which the association of ideas will suggest in the perusal. Part I. Happy the man, who sees a God employ'd In all the good and ill that chequer life! Resolving all events, with their effects And manifold results, into the will, And arbitration wise of the Supreme! Cowper. I. Ope, Light of Life! and, with a ray divine, Illume the soul of thy devoted Bard, While he, with reverential awe profound, Attempts to show, (if 'tis no crime to show,) Wherefore to human lot such woes befel; And where lies all the guilt, and all the blame! O! Thou who knowest! why was man so doom'd? Or why permitted was that subtle fiend To tempt mankind? Oh! how could God have seen, Uncheck'd, such ruin of his glorious works? Was it against his predetermin'd will, And not within his potence to prevent? Or was it that, unconscious of mishap, His ever-waking eye, omniscient, slept, His purpose disappointed? Oh, not so! His counsel stands, his honour still endures. II. Man was made free, and fell as Heaven ordain'd; Not by constraint, for then 'twere not his fault; Nor was he left to self-directing chance; For that had render'd his delinquent state Uncertain, which, 'tis granted, was foreknown, But could foreknowledge of th' event exist, Before th' Eternal had the means decreed, By which th' event should surely come to pass? Impossible! as soon might earth a crop Produce, devoid of seed; or sightless eyes Delight in visual prospect. Lift thy view, O man! survey the realms of Nature vast! Does observation find a movement there, Moral or physical, without a cause? Or will the voice of common sense aver, That creatures their existence can prolong, Or e'en a thought possess, or act perform, Void of th' all-moving energy divine? Truly, they might as well themselves have made, Before they had existence; or, of life Possess'd, annihilate the living soul. III. Adapted to his transient station here, (Nor can he fail of answ'ring the design, For which Eternal Wisdom him ordain'd,) Man, acting in the view of motive, acts Divinely mov'd, dependent and yet free; Conscious, spontaneous, and responsible. Will any hence assert, that God himself Is author, so to incur the guilt of sin? Or so to exonerate mankind from blame? Presumptuous; most irreverent, indeed, Were such suggestions! Why should erring man Take on himself to use blasphemous words, Though one allege, that he who fashion'd man, Made him for grand designs and useful ends, And, to secure those ends, ordain'd his deeds? Void of intention what do deeds imply? If to speak thus be shocking to good-will, Grant he ordain'd the means which terminate The choice, but left it to mankind to choose, Th' internal motive all their own. What then? Is not the moral evil, too, their own? So it appears to me; if otherwise, How can the Righteous One adjudge the world? Wherefore, O man! charge not on Deity The blame of thy transgression, nor revile His fix'd decrees respecting human deeds, But with devout and humble soul submit Will to his will, and conduct to his law. IV. As to man's fall, it might become to say, That, at the time of trial, him to prove Of self-wrought worth deficient, God withheld From him his all-restraining agency, So man might know the weakness of himself, Nor fall as angels fell, past hope, by pride Of self-sufficient merit, nor conceit That, as his acts of goodness were his own, Those acts were self-originate; and hence Lose sight of glory due alone to Him, Who of all goodness is himself the source; So by man's fall his error might appear; Then, if restor'd, his gratitude enhanc'd, And virtue fix'd inalienably firm. Hence, God's exclusive title to all praise, For goodness in himself and good bestow'd, Might ever to all finite creatures shine, Conspicuous, as the most important end, Or first and final cause of all his works. V. Thus, ever obvious should it seem, that He, Who never but in vast perfection dwells, Immutably benign in holiness, Could ne'er have been of moral ill the cause, In manner to impeach his character; But man, to voluntary freedom left, Lost his first relish, and became corrupt. Indulging his imagination vain, By which the sway of animal desire Th' ascendance gain'd o'er Reason's godlike power, He sensual things to holy joys preferred, And transient pleasure to eternal good. VI. Nor can we further sin's existence trace, Than to the culprit who performs the deed. 'Tis there the conscience fixes the soul stain. Discerning good from ill, and right from wrong, Man feels the moral bond upon his heart, Convicted of the fitness of that law, Which claims all-duteous love to the Supreme, From every creature gifted with the power, Falsehood from truth, and right from wrong to know. And, hence, a breach of that eternal code Divine, so fit, so just in its demands, Excites an awful consciousness of blame Obnoxious, fearful of impending wrath. VII. Two points are obviousâtruths of prime regard: That man a free and moral agent is, Yet as dependent. At first glance of thought, That may appear a paradox to some, Though demonstration, like the potent breeze, Which from the sun dispels the darkling mist, From seeming error shows the truth in beams. VIII. Grant first, that man a moral agent is, Of which the soul has proof within herself, And Reason's voice, by common science taught, Aside from Revelation's sacred light, Can thence demonstrate his dependent state. Indeed, all moral exercise itself implies, Perceptive motive, and spontaneous act; A will all free, or not in duty bound; A heart oblig'd, or not inclin'd to obey. And since the conscience teaches right and wrong, Inculcates good, and disapproves of ill, The chain of truth, by Reason's eye discern'd, Us to a self-existent Power conducts, Great Author of all substance, motion, mind; All, all dependent, and dependent too, Not for constituent attributes alone, As his efficient, ceaseless agency, Direct or indirect, in every thing Mov'd or that moves, is indispensable; E'en to the use of properties bestow'd. IX. Cause and effect, occasion and attempt, Comprise the physical and moral worlds. Through Nature vast, and through the works of Art, No discord reigns, nor harmony prevails, Unless by means of some disposing power. So in the moral: not a transient thought Arises, no internal act exists, But from some motive or exterior view. Through inlets of the senses, objects strike Perception's eye, and various thoughts impart, Whence principles we form, and systems raise. Through such a process, thus by Heaven ordain'd, Materials we derive, with which is rear'd The superstructure of th' immortal mind. At first the notions, then the feelings rise. Objective motive in the mental view, Essential to the soul's activity, Pleases the mind, and terminates the will, Which, by its acts, our fate decides, and takes, In time, its impress for eternity. X. Nor in decisions thus mechanical, (If moral exercise may be so called,) Is man's responsibility impair'd, Or freedom of his mind infring'd. Devoid Of bias, no one can in fact be free, Void of dependence, none accountable. Without a motive, the machine would sleep, Of moral movement, all in voidy gloom Involv'd; as when ideal Chaos sat, Pond'ring for ages on nonentity. Yet, notwithstanding such necessity, In correspondence with eternal things, The soul, quite conscious of her free estate, Conscious of ill desert and virtue's praise, Knows that the great Original above, Who ordinates in wisdom infinite, Has, for a breach of his command, a right To punish, and for good desert reward. XI. But still, to illucidate this argument, As is the pleasantness of mental view, Or seeming fitness of its object, to confer Desir'd enjoyment, so th' assent of will, Virtuous or vicious. Thus the soul, perverse, Acts but within the precincts of the fall, And only evil in her evil state. Nor can she possibly to love of good Her moral taste dispose, howe'er inclin'd The life to regulate by outward rule. Indeed, 'twere gross absurdity to think, That she can self-originate a power, To act against her nature; but since laws Restrain, and custom frowns on vice; 'tis true, Man's sphere of liberty so far extends, As that he puts the garb of virtue on, But for the credit of good character; Since who would wear the hag habiliments Of vice, in sight of a contemptuous world, Unless he love to sin with appetite Below all shame? Nay, man may exercise The tender sympathies of social life, And all those virtues of humanity, Which link the kindred to the kindred kind, And wake a hope which heaven-born bosoms love, Fond of the thought, that what seems fair is good, And still be void of holy principle. For, in th' eternal code that governs hosts Angelic, and which ought to govern men, There is a statute irreversible, That selfish motive leads to wrongful ends, Against the general good.âA principle Discordant, it not only does not prompt Disinterested deeds; but stands oppos'd To every effort for another's weal, Which comes in competition with its own. Inflate with pride, and by ambition led, Had it the power to erect a monarchy Of its own choosing, self would be supreme, And general good be turned to general ill. Thanks to propitious Heaven, it is not thus! So man, in his confin'd and alien state, Can only act from a corrupted source, Act how he will; as ever will he act, (Oft most perverse,) until, by Heaven's decree, His heart be chang'd into a holy frame. XII. To test the fact, observe the stupid sot! His cup his idol, sin his soul's delightâ Lo, he prefers his present sense to please, E'en at the certain risk of endless bliss! Nor does the fascination, though it hold Resistless sway, infringe upon his choice; Nor, till some stronger motive him deter, Will he reverse his detrimental course. Although so fix'd in his depravity, (Or, if one please, propensity of will,) That 'twere as hard for him to change his mind, As 'twere for Nature's pillars to give way At his command,âwould that excuse from blame? And he may say, by way of boasting slur, That he as honest lives, as those who seem More righteous;âand 'tis truly pitiful, That human nature is so deeply marr'd, That the most pure are liable to err, And none from deeds of scandal are exempt. Yet, though the truly pious sometimes fail, Their sins belong not to their character; Seeing they hate them from their inmost soul. And though their failings should be magnify'd By slanderous tongues, officious; though a brute, In form, and strut, and gesture of a man, After much wall'wing in the mire of sin, Approach along, âto whiten by their side;â That circumstance itself would show, that e'en The faults of virtue are respectable In the comparison. But Charity, Sweet nurse of goodness! ever keeps in store Some cordial nice, some fit restorative, For transient lapses of infirmity, Seeing there's no perfection here on earth. XIII. Still, as the moral standard is the soul, And outward actions alter not the heart; How can man judge with certainty of man, By the bare rectitude of outward life? He cannot; from th' exterior, who can tell The secret motive of the viewless soul? No mortal; save where selfishness is gross, And flagrant vice is habit; for misdeeds, Presumptuous, speak right out. But otherwise, The judgment is precarious; as in man, The creature of conjecture, much is wrong. Yet, if the character appear upright, And judge one must, 'twere fitter far, to judge In charity; well-knowing that himself Like favour needs; as, every day he lives, Did not some gracious drops of pity, shed From weeping skies, absolve some evil thought, Or some remaining pravity away, He might have doubts about his own blest hope. XIV. Again: Observe the miser's eager hand! With bribes familiar, stratagems, and frauds, Will it e'er turn to wash itself from guilt, Unless from Heaven a miracle descend, And renovate the temper of his soul? Or mark the principle on either side! Say, can an honest man his neighbour's goods Purloin, and do the thing his soul abhors? Or knowingly commit a downright fraud? Or can Benevolence, as firmly fix'd As rooted principle in evil man, Deny her nature, and her relish lose For deeds which meet th' approving smile of Heaven? No; to do good is her congenial wish; The view that terminates her choice lies there. XV. Nor seems it from the want of light most clear, But on account of prejudice perhaps, That erring man a self determ'ning power Should urge, as requisite to moral deed; Since the control of objects, e'er so strong, Does not imply infringement on the will; But is, as 'twere, the pivot of the choice. Besides, 'tis not the freedom of the mind, (Although its acts are ne'er of freedom void,) But 'tis the nature of the moral zest, Of which we rightly predicate desert:â A man may ponder murder in his heart, And not commit the crime; or should he wreak His utmost vengeance, still, in either case, His blame would lie in malice. Need we ask How his perverse intention was produc'd, Whether he self-determin'd his design, Or whether it resulted from some harm Conceiv'd, before we can pronounce his guilt? Let common sense and conscious truth decide. We loathe the man who harbours vengeful thoughts; His ill designs we justly criminate, Though frustrate; and, in judging of mankind, Soon as we find th' intention to be bad, (As nought can justify such ill desert,) We seek no further, (or we need not seek Further, if sin itself be truly sin,) How that malign intention was produc'd. XVI. But if, against all conscious evidence, And all the light which Nature can impart, Vain wisdom and perverted reason plead, Either the mind must independent be, And self-determine its spontaneous acts, Or else be clear from all desert of blameâ A strange conclusion! in that case would man Become as God, accountable to none. XVII. Hail, finite independence elevate! Arise, O mortal! now respect thyself! No more by rudely elements inthrall'd, Go deck thy form in ever-blooming youth, And in defiance of the wrecks of time, Make thyself younger with increase of year! Originating thy volition's bent, Go renovate thy nature, and henceforth, Firm fix'd in virtue uncorruptible, Display on earth thy godlike dignity! Why under power of motive, captive led, Spontaneous, subject to external laws? XVIII. Hark! Revelation speaks; and Reason gives Grateful assent, that there is one, but one, Omniscient, independent, and self-mov'd. Enthron'd upon the vasty universe, He reigns alone, adorable Supreme; Whate'er is wonderful, sublime, or fair, Came by his word; and all things he ordain'd, Moral and physical, for wisest ends; Exhibiting, in manifold respects, As acted out in creatures rational, Vice her own punishment, deserving ill; Virtue her own reward, as in herself Most lovely; so that all may understand Th' eternal diff'rence betwixt right and wrong, And know Heaven's throne is built on rectitude. XIX. If that be true, (and fools alone may doubt,) Where at his exit goes yon infidel? For if that one be good, (as sure he is,) Then just he must condemn, or gracious save, Without respect to persons, as desert In life shall character the souls of men. And since Unerring Wisdom laid the plan, Nor fails of power to execute his will, He must control, and order for the best, With ceaseless care, the universe at large, Nor human conduct leave to random chance. XX. But how he operatesâO who can tell? Who comprehend a viewlessâan unknown? Who trace the secrets of his agency? Silence becomes all human wisdom here. Still we believe, that 'tis in such a way, As constitutes our freedom, not destroys; Produces obligation, not impairs; While man himself is authorâman alone Is subject to the penalty of sin. Yet, that a certainty, infallible, Waits the Most High, respecting human deeds, According to the destin'd course of things, Is quite demonstrable from attributes Essential to Perfection Infinite. How else could God accomplish his designs, Momentous, which on human deeds depend? Or where the faithful word of prophesy, Were its fulfilment at the risk of means Fortuitous, and agents uncontrol'd? XXI. The man who reasons with consistent views, Will to the great, primeval Cause ascend, And to that cause ascribe mere accidents. Had lifeless matter power to move itself, Or could contingencies themselves produce, Chimeras might substantial form assume, Crowd from their poise the balanc'd elements, The harmony of system be derang'd, Fear come, and worse than anarchy prevail. XXII. Hence, when we look through fields immense of space, And mark the globes that all their rounds perform, And bring each circle to a moment's point; When we behold, amongst accordance there, Such strange phenomena; the comet that, Through infinite extent, conveys the news; Or, dimly seen, the spots upon the sun; Or the red star that shoots the pestilence; Convicted of design, we turn and say, There is, there must be, an Essential Cause, E'en for those casual haps which we call chance; For they are in their place as requisite, To the just order of events on earth, As things of magnitude; and, in the hand Of secret-working purpose, turn, oft turn, The scale of nations, and determine fate. What if, misplacing his incautious foot, One meet his exit?âwould he go uncall'd? No, thou wilt answer, 'twere his destin'd lot. So says the voice of wisdom; so the soul, Convinc'd that there's a ruling power above. XXIII. In sober Reason's eye, that looks abroad, And sees on minor causes final ends Dependent, seems it that the Hand which form'd, And furnish'd with such splendid garniture, The heavens stupendous, should, with partial views, Leave them devoid of conduct and design? Seems it not fitter, that the least affairs Should meet his notice, and, combin'd at large, Have their determin'd order and result? XXIV. Amidst the rapid series of events, Multudinous, from time's all teeming birth, Stunn'd by the roar of elements, the broils Of passion's rage, and war's confus'd, strange noise; Seems it that Chance, th' ideal goddess Chance, Could hear the voice prophetic, and fulfil, By adventitious means, events foretold? Seems it not rather, to the view of Faith, That, o'er th' immense expanse of rolling worlds, An eminent Intelligence presides; Who, while he comprehends the vast machines, Regards as requisite each trivial part, Bound by his own perfection infinite, To exclude whate'er might deleterious prove? If so, from moral evil greater good Than otherwise must come; and though the fall, View'd in itself, is loss; in its effects, Distressful; there is glory in advance. XXV. Hence, notwithstanding man's disastrous lapse, 'Tis rightly argu'd, that the scheme divine Was disconcerted never, nor can hosts Of hostile powers e'er frustrate its intent. Although th' apostasy a thousand woes Occasion'd, what a scope of grand display, What int'rest to the moral world it gives, Vast and increasing with the roll of years! 'Tis the great hinge on which the drama turns, Of the whole human species;âearth the stage; All ages the duration of the play; Performers, real characters in life; Angels spectators; scen'ry Nature's self; Earth's Master-Builder, manager; all modes Of human being, doing, suff'ring, wrought Into the general plot; the purpose great, And great the crisis, man's eternal doom; And, at the close or grand catastrophe, The risen dead arraign'd before the Judge; Virtue triumphant, Vice dismay'd:âthe whole Resulting in the wondrous Author's praise;â Who, above every other dramatist, Not only form'd the structure of the play, But made its actors, and awards their fate. END OF PART FIRST. PART II. I. Thus, in the dispensation that exists, There is a prospect in the future world, As each one's meritâHold! it is not so! Beneath the throne eternal duty lies, Reward by promise only, not of right. What merit can a creature claim? or who, At best, can raise a balance on his side? Imagine one that never sinn'd, and what Can he demand? Nought;âduty still comes short; Heaven's holiest seraph can perform no more.â In creatures, no inherent merit lies; The utmost of their best performances, Pays but the int'rest of the debt they owe, Whose principal they never can discharge. II. Hence, as the law abatement grants to none, Nor for the least offence excuse accepts; And as no culprit can his soul redeem, Nor sinless angel expiation make; Soon as the great transgression had occurr'd, There was a pause in heaven for half an hour. Divinity itself was mov'd, and thousand hosts, Like statues on a gaze, with pond'ring eyes Tow'rds earth, stood leaning, horror-struck and griev'd. Beyond the power of finite arm to save, And to created minds no way reveal'd, By which a fit atonement could be made; All, all as 'twere, seem'd lost, and Wisdom's self In her great purpose put upon defeat. III. At length, upon the battlements of heaven, From the thick crowds of gazing hosts retir'd, Ithuriel, elevate with thoughts sublime, Softly to Radiel thus his soul address'd: Mysterious change! Impervious to the view, Clouds and thick darkness hang about the throne! Oh! who can scan the ways of Providence? So recent, such a falling-off from heaven, Amongst th' angelic hosts, and now, on earth, The noble creature man, whom we had thought Doom'd to make good the breachâhe also gone! And tempted too by Heaven's eternal foe! How diff'rent were the nature of events, Left to the management of finite powers! We should, no doubt, have render'd man secure, Beyond a liability to fall. Would any less than Deity himself Have thought to have permitted moral ill, To enter his new empire, when his nod, Or his red thunderbolt projected, might, With ease, have frustrated the tempter's aim, And stiffen'd him at once with dire dismay? IV. To whom thus Radiel, fond of argument: That which was best to be permitted, best It was it should have taken place; of course, Those means were best, which should its certainty Secure. But man may plead, that moral ill Was not intended in the scheme divine; It therefore must have crept in unawares; Or, if predestin'd, must excuse from blame; And so Eternal Justice were impeach'd In dooming him to death; and thence infer, That to be just, were not to be divine; Or, to inflict a punishment deserv'd, Were inconsistent with benev'lent views. V. With sapient words, Ithuriel thus rejoin'd: Man, implicated in the guilt himself, May thus on grounds of selfishness pretend, And strive against conviction to believe; But conscience, ever intent upon reproof, Will from such gross conceptions grant no peace. As to man's views of moral right and wrong, 'Twere proper to suppose him prone to err; Especially while partial reason, dim, Takes its own twilight as the test of truth. But he who dwells in light invisible, In whom is all perfection, ever reigns Benevolent as wise; and he as well Might be unlovely, as unjust. Indeed, So bright, so glorious is his character, And so dispos'd is he, and able too, To manage for the best his vast concerns, Evil is made subservient to best ends; And from the fall a greater good may come, Than had man still remain'd in innocence. VI. But how predestination can subsist, Without abatement of the moral bond, And sentence on the guilty be enforc'd, Consistently with rectitude divine, Requires no great exertion to conceive, Still leaving man accountable and free. But how strict justice can with punishment Of sin dispense, and keep a level beam The while, is more than thought can comprehend. Nor can invention figure to itself The bulk of merit, which should poise the scale. It therefore seems impossible, that man Should be restor'd; unless in Deity Some undiscover'd attribute exist, Henceforth to be disclos'd; as when, sublime His justice was display'd in casting down, Headlong, th' apostate host that sinn'd in heaven. But what that attribute can be, it were As difficult for reason to suggest, As 'twere for one, not having ears, to hear; Or, void of eyes, to picture to his ken, The genial hue of nature. Question'd, he Might speak of its similitude, and say, 'Tis like the soft smooth down, or like the smell Of savoury odours. But the light divine Must pour upon our darkling view its ray, Before we can explain, or e'en conceive, Of what that attribute consists; for though Fancy, from known materials, may construct New combinations, 'tis beyond her power To figure to herself a thing distinct, Of which no likeness nature has display'd. VII. He ceas'd; when Radiel his assent express'd, But 'twere most glorious in his view, he said, Were Justice so appeas'd, that man at last, Should she triumphant o'er the powers malign, And occupy th' abodes from whence they fell; Now a drear waste of solitary realms. Prophetic of divine good news to earth, And looking tow'rds the glory, lo! he cry'd, I seem to see th' unfolding Deity! VIII. He spoke. In robes of glorious excellence, Sweet Mercy from the secret place advanc'd, And Justice took her hand. In shouts sublime, Rapt joy resounded through the spacious hall, And distant regions rung with festive sound. Silence ensu'd; when, not in thunder's roar, But in a still small voice, Jehovah spake. IX. To all ye seraphim and loyal hosts, Who stand adoring round the throne supreme, Be it well known: That in the secret place Of love divine, a sacred fount is op'd, Of living waters, in behalf of man, In view of which, justice forbears to frown. But still there is a threat i' the covenant:â The soul that does not drink assur'dly dies. Th' archangel Gabriel, be it known to all, Is my commission'd messenger to earth, To offer terms of peace, acceptible, That whosoe'er repents, and turns to God, Shall taste of these ethereal streams, and live. Against the wilful, penal law remains, Its rigour unabatedâendless wo, Inexorableâexpiation made, Not for the least offence, (as God is just,) Nor pardon possible, but on such terms. Angels! ye all are min'string spirits nowâ Man is entitled to benev'lent love. Go render service to the future heirs Of bliss immortal. Thus Jehovah spake. X. Instant a song divine, too exquisite For human ears, (had human ears been there,) Serenely spread along the expanse of heaven; While, on the cloud around the holy place, In tok'n of peace, a radiant bow appear'd, The joy of angels, glorious to the throne! XI. In looks benign, with smiles ineffable, Mercy, descending, now commenc'd her work Of love on earth. Nor could the character, Divine, have been to finite view display'd, Save from the circumstance of moral ill. Nor could soft Pity, bending o'er distress, Have e'er enjoy'd her sympathising spell, Or into sorrow's wound her balsam pour'd. So long as man had free from guilt remain'd, He never had rejoic'd in Mercy's smile. Mercy descends on none but criminals; And, but for sin and penalty incurr'd, Important attributes, develop'd now In character, were dormant and unknown. The human soul, in its primeval state, Like a young bud sequester'd from the sun, Shone not, in all its lovely innocence, As shines the glory of the soul redeem'd. XII. But why, secreted in th' Eternal Mind, The riches of redeeming grace so long, While angels who had trespass'd were, devoid Of hope, cast off? However that may seem To those who stood; to us, of feebler views, 'Tis most mysterious. It may be, that man, A species, a whole order in the chain Of being, were less proper to be lost, And hence (though not of title or desert) An object of more fit regard. Besides, The woman's Seed to bruise the serpent's head, Was, in the view of Justice infinite, An indispensable in point of law, To make amends. Aught else could not avail. 'Twas the sole mean by which salvation were In nature possible. In vision saw The patriarchs this, enraptur'd with desire. Th' expected triumph of Messiah's reign, By types prefigur'd, and by seers presag'd, Cheer'd the glad nations to the midst of years; When, lo! the scatter'd rays of prophesy, Converging to the compass of a star, Stood resting o'er the Babe of Bethlehem! God was made manifest that man might live. XIII. O! 'twas a gladly voice, by Heaven inspir'd, Which angels with triumphant rapture swell'd, Chanting the birth of that auspicious Child, Who, growing into years, eternal truth Unfolded, and the boding gloom dispell'd, Which had for ages held the world in doubt Of a hereafter of the human soul; When man, elated with a hope sublime, Expanded into consequence, and joy'd In his existence! Lo! a star salutes The wilder'd traveller! Behold the sun, After a long dull train of low'ring days, Comes in the glory of unclouded morn! So beam'd the Gospel light upon the world; And Nature's self in fairer splendour shone, The more seem'd Wisdom to disclose her plan For man's redemption. Everlasting life, Rais'd from the slumb'ring relics of the tomb, Was an event, in Faith's illumin'd eye, Replete with views ineffably divine. XIV. Time, all eventful time, that, like a blast Upon the wilderness, delights in waste, And, in the track of his o'erwhelming wheels, Leaves pompous cities, empires, governments, In ruins, open'd on the searching view Of new-born sages, new accomplishments In that eternal plan, which has o'erturn'd The nations, and was still to overturn, Till the last trumpet should have spent its blast. Yet, in those years, was wisdom set at nought, Faith in the God contemptuously refus'd, And down through ages bold blasphemers scoff'd. XV. But in an era, when proud learning vaunts, And philosophic Reason condescends The laws to mend of Wisdom infinite, And, like a fallen angel rob'd in light, Deprives of its divinity the Cross, And blots out half the pen of truth has taught, What bard can please who sings the plan divine? XVI. Alas! conjecture on conjecture void Of wisdom! What about a future state Can man, aside from Revelation, know? Reason, not lumin'd by a ray from Heaven, Is like a moon that never saw the sun. Dark, it no borrow'd light reflects, to cheer The soul of the benighted traveller. XVII. He, self-bewilder'd mortal! who his view Turns from meridian splendour, and, misled By the pale meteor of the night through bogs And upland mazes, meets some fatal brink, Grasps at a phantom to prevent his fall: But down, inevitably down he goes. Through vain philosophy and boasted light, A broader passage, and an easier way, Than that which Inspiration has reveal'd, He feigns to have discover'd, and, in pride Of self-importance, his own reason makes The test and standard of eternal right. XVIII. Presumptuous! let him pass the confines first, His theory with facts compareâand what? Confounded and undone. Deluded man! So vast thy stretch of reason, thou o'erlook'st Reason's first hint; that a defect in God, Or in the system of his government, Or in the sacred page by Truth inspir'd, Is quite impossible. Behold, the word Of holy Prophets and Apostles, casts Blindness on human wisdom black as night; And human Reason, heedless of that word, Groping in darkness, stumbles on to death! XIX. Still in each breast a monitor presides, To warn, reprove, although she toil in vain; For so perverse and blinded is the will, She makes but here and there a proselyte. Her counsels, 'tis confess'd, are just, wise, good; Her arguments conclusive; yet, alas! There's something so beset, so prone in wrong, She to free-thinkers preaches as to stones, Their hearts so cas'd in prejudice. But some Her admonitions and reproofs esteem, Above all estimate; as seeming done In kindness, mixing in the cup of life Peace, void of which there's doubt in what may come. XX. But, in relation to our thoughts of men, âThis I hold firm:â That hearts sincere and pure Deserve our charity, though error them mislead; For goodness not in knowledge liesâthe wise Themselves do err. But, 'gainst the contrite soul, No writ of error lies in Heaven's high court, Howe'er the head may have decided wrong As to the minor precepts of the law. Here, then, I make up judgment. But, one day, Should it appear like bigotry in me, To place the test of virtue in the heart; And should I, now grown grey in error, find, That in the form of goodness lies the power; I must confess it an essential point, And freely will I change my sentiments. But that can never while my reason lasts. No! never shall that prostituted day Lower o'er my head, when I shall have believ'd That true religion lies in form alone, However fair; or lure me to embrace That latitudinarian charity, Which gives to infidels the dexter hand Of fellowship, however bland they seem As social friends, howe'er correct their lives! A bare morality of deed overt, (As to the current usage of the phrase,) Is goodness in the negative at best; A cloak for the transgression of the soul; A plaster to disguise, not heal, the wound. True, it is fair in sight of human view, Whether to gain respect, or shun the law; But faulted in the chancery of Heaven. As to the nature of the thing itself, Some call it habit, education, love Of order,âany thing conformable To the mere fashion of good character. But one should put his soul into his deeds; Nor badly neither, but in love to man. High Heaven takes cognizance of secret thoughts; Heart-acts alone determine good or ill; Heart-acts alone are premium'd in the skies; And they decide the future destiny. XXI. But to return: From what internal sense Makes obvious, as in this assay discuss'd, Join'd with what lumin'd reason dictates, one May verily conceive, how human deeds Are render'd so subservient to events, As not to violate the rights of will, Nor in the least excuse from praise or blame. If in the heart all moral evil liesâ Suppose man's acts inevitably fix'd;â What then? From the bare manner of the deed, What is inferr'd? or what does it decide? Does it e'er change the nature of the will, Which, in whatever manner it might act, Were still the same in essence, good or bad? That should to common sense appear absurd. Therefore, to cast upon the sacred truth Of holy Inspiration, as to the decrees Eternal, such opprobrious epithets, As some have utter'd in excuse for guiltâ Does it not savour of much ignorance? Or of a heart replete with partial views? XXII. Man a probationer is put to proof; And, like a tree that takes deep root and soars Amidst the buffeting of elements and shifts Of seasons, best his loftier powers displays, When most beset by perils all around; And gains, by Heaven-refreshing beams betimes, A growth far nobler than if innocent, With half his talents never brought to use. The knowledge of both good and evil gives By contrast good a richer zest, as pain Serves, when abated, to enhance delight. Suffering itself to virtuous ends inures, And short privation makes enjoyment sweet. Health after sickness, pleasure after pain, Hope from despair, and holy joys for gifts Receiv'd, attended with exalted views Of the divine perfections, how could man Have known, but from the fall which gave them birth? Or how the soul her destiny attain, While here inthrall'd within this house of clay? But, having gain'd her freedom through the grave, Rising from ruins she ascends renew'd. Yes! all enraptur'd, lo, she bears away, The moral world laid open to her view! XXIII. Thus, only, man through imperfection gains Perfection, try'd in dreadful scenes. To bring Good out of ill is God's prerogative; To manifest himself the final cause, Wherefore to human lot such woes befell. THE END. MINOR POEMS. ON THE MOON. LO! half emerg'd from realms of eastern waves, The moon her face in ocean-azure laves: She lifts her head, and casts, in cheerful light, Refulgent glory on the brow of Night! At length, in clouds, the darkling vapours glow; Their foamy skirts are like the drifted snow; The stars dim-twinkling through their forms appear, As through the ghosts of Ossian, half in fear; While planets round their brilliant beams dispense, And earth expands in bright magnificence. The gazing nations all the scene behold, And tales repeat, which other years have told; All hearts are fill'd with wonderful delight, When Cynthia comes to radiate the Night. So, through her courtly hall, majestic moves An empire's queen, whom every heart approves; Upon her steps a host of peers attend; A train of courtiers in her presence bend; With pleas'd discourse the lingering hours beguile, Praise all her charms, rejoice in every smile; Yet not so fair by thousand times she seems, As Cynthia, empress of the silver beams! A GLANCE AT WINTER, WITH AN APPEAL TO THE BENEVOLENT, APPROPRIATE TO THE SEASON: .... THENCE REFLECTIONS ON FRIENDSHIP, SYMPATHY, RELIGION, AND SOME OF THEIR EFFECTS. 'Tis winter! frost has blasted all the plains, And desolation bleak o'er nature reigns! Convolv'd in darkling clouds upon the poles, The God of grandeur there his empire holds; And sends from northern realms, in dreadful force, The messengers of storm with howling voice; Throughout the world a deadly venom flies, Streams turn to glass, and vegetation dies. O'er hill and plain the sunbeam coldly shines, The trees are bare, the mountain-spirit whines. Indignant ocean, heedful lest the host, That comes with powder'd locks upon the coast, Should grasp, with frigid hand, his subject-wave, And, if uncheck'd, his whole domain enslave; Mad on the foe, tremendous mountains pours, And breaks his icy chains upon the shores. Earth, too, though bound and shut from solar joys Oft bursts her bands with an alarming noise. No more fair verdure smiles, nor blossom glows, Reft, ravag'd, buried in unbounded snows. No more the songs of woodland warblers glide, To greet the morn, or solace eventide; Cold, blustering winds embroil the drifted lawn, And summer charms, like passing friends, are gone. Ye bounteous souls! remember now the poor, Nor frown the suffering pilgrim from your door! Scorn to the wretch! of callous heart so hard, That to pale Want should show no more regard! Scorn to the wretch! who ne'er, with streaming eye, Felt Pity's pang, nor gave for grief a sigh! The suppliant soul, that looks to Heaven resign'd, The famish'd mein,that woos you to be kindâ If nature's plea has power the breast to move, Turn not your eye from such, ye sons of Love! Joyful it is, when plung'd in deep distress, To catch a look of earnest wish to bless! Joyful it is, with taste of Heaven imbued, An open heart to see, so kind, so good, That its warm flame the winter cannot chill, That its live spirit still delights to thrill! O say, thou rich one! who, in fortune's smile, Liv'st with a haughty soul, in splendid style; Perhaps with breast of snow and heart of steel, With no solicitude for other's weal; May not dire haps, or unforeseen mistakes, Scatter each vision thy proud fancy makes; Thyself cast out in alien climes to roam, The ground thy resting-place, the world thy home? Or, if among thy jovial friends distress'd, Where, while in splendour, thou wast much caress'd; Where courteous tongues pass'd compliments along, And fair professions made, like idle song; Where, like the noisy streamlet o'er the ground, Smooth words flow'd useless, but for pleasant sound:â Dost think, from such connexions form'd midst cares, Which interest prompts, or which amusement shares, To gather vestments, which shall keep thee warm, Or gain a shelter from the wintry storm? Dost think, when poverty's cold hand has seiz'd Thy wither'd frame, by thirst and hunger teas'd, That thou canst step, as wont, the rich man's doors, And, as a welcome guest, enjoy his stores? Ah, no! on sudden, when, with aspect dire, Misfortune frowns, lo! plighted friends retire! Now passing, mark the cold, averted look Of one that pleas'd, but now by him forsook! O! virtue's friend! shouldst thou too meet neglect, Since wealth is deem'd the standard of respect, Be patient ever! thou one day shalt riseâ If not in earthly climesâin brighter skies! And shouldst thou find, amongst the plausive train, Thousands of bland professions false and vain; Induc'd to think no passion void of pelf, No charity that loses sight of selfâ O, wake! arouse from thy delusive dreams, Nor take the world in all things as it seems! No! there's a flame of sympathy refin'd, An ever-during incense of the mind! And there's a friend, whose bosom honour knows, Glads in our joys, and grieves in all our woes; Attach'd the more, while others take their flightâ Does he not seem, as 'twere, a saint of light? O! is there aught (but 'twere in vain to scan) So lovely as benevolence in man? Depriv'd of whichâsay what, beneath the moon, Would make the world a real hell so soon? As in my morn of life it was my lot, Lone seated at the window of some cot, By chance to view the seraph doves that coo'd, Hovering around, as of celestial mood; So have I seen, in Friendship's blissful height, Grateful endearments cherish'd with delight; A mutual confidence of souls, perceiv'd; Kind hints at faults, without offence conceiv'd; Freedom of thought, averse from vain display; A faithfulness too noble to betray; Good sense enrich'd with sentiment benign, Which mov'd the soul as 'twere by power divine; A fervid zeal to serve, with looks which show'd The testimonies, that the spirit glow'd; An intercourse, where heart with heart grew warm, And gave to Friendship a peculiar charm. Hast thou not met, perchance, misfortune stern, And felt commiseration's power in turn? Perchance, hast thou not, in thy youthful prime, Been left in some inhospitable clime, Worn by disease, but worn by trouble more, Thy thought long pondering on th' eternal shore? And when physicians no receipt could find, To suit the wound, that rankled in the mind; Hast thou not, as perchance a friend came there, Rose to new life, as rescued from despair? When o'er thy fate with mingling grief he hung, And urg'd the cause whence thy affliction sprung; Did not the power of Sympathy alone, Charm every wound, and silence every groan? For mental pains, when drugs have no control, Yield to the soothings of a kindred soul. Yet when severe afflictions prey, Seeming to wear the life away; Should not man in Heaven confide, And mount above the whelming tide? 'Tis not best, in gloomy mood, Ever on life's ills to brood; As if we should enjoy, no more, Peace this side th' eternal shore; As if each darling hope were gone, Never, never to return:â From a winter of the heart, Oft a joyful spring will start; When, in triumph of the mind, As we cast a look behind On distresses which are past, Peace may bless our days at last. But since on earth dire ills assail, And hopes, and fears, and cares prevail, Need we to be taught to know There's no perfect bliss below? That, oft, the sorrows which we feel, Not Friendship's power itself can heal, So deep they pierce, so strong they reign? Yet can Religion's balm alone, Solace the wounded spirit's tone, However horrible the pain.</field>
