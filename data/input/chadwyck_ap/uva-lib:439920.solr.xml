      <field name="fulltext">SEASONS OF PRAYER. December, 1826. To prayer, to prayer;—for the morning breaks, And Earth in her Maker's smile awakes. His light is on all below and above,— The light of gladness, and life, and love. O, then, on the breath of this early air, Send upward the incense of grateful prayer. To prayer;—for the glorious sun is gone, And the gathering darkness of night comes on; Like a curtain from God's kind hand it flows To shade the couch where his children repose. Then kneel, while the watching stars are bright, And give your last thoughts to the Guardian of night. To prayer;—for the day that God has blest Comes tranquilly on with its welcome rest. It speaks of creation's early bloom; It speaks of the Prince who burst the tomb. Then summon the spirit's exalted powers, And devote to Heaven the hallowed hours. There are smiles and tears in the mother's eyes, For her new-born infant beside her lies. O hour of bliss! when the heart o'erflows With rapture a mother only knows. Let it gush forth in words of fervent prayer; Let it swell up to Heaven for her precious care. There are smiles and tears in that gathering band, Where the heart is pledged with the trembling hand. What trying thoughts in her bosom swell, As the bride bids parent and home farewell! Kneel down by the side of the tearful fair, And strengthen the perilous hour with prayer. Kneel down by the sinner's dying side, And pray for his soul through Him who died. Large drops of anguish are thick on his brow; O, what are earth and its pleasures now? And what shall assuage his dark despair, But the penitent cry of humble prayer? Kneel down at the couch of departing faith, And hear the last words the believer saith. He has bidden adieu to his earthly friends; There is peace in his eye that upward bends; There is peace in his calm, confiding air; For his last thoughts are God's, his last words prayer. The voice of prayer at the sable bier! A voice to sustain, to soothe, and to cheer. It commends the spirit to God who gave; It lifts the thoughts from the cold, dark grave; It points to the glory where He shall reign, Who whispered, “Thy brother shall rise again.” The voice of prayer in the world of bliss! But gladder, purer, than rose from this. The ransomed shout to their glorious King, Where no sorrow shades the soul as they sing; But a sinless and joyous song they raise, And their voice of prayer is eternal praise. Awake, awake! and gird up thy strength To join that holy band at length! To Him who unceasing love displays, Whom the powers of nature unceasingly praise,— To Him thy heart and thy hours be given; For a life of prayer is the life of heaven. GREENOUGH'S STATUES OF THE CHERUB AND CHILD. “QUÆ NUNC ABIBIS IN LOCA?” Child. Whither now, sweet spirit, say? Whither tends our lengthening way? Sun on sun, and star on star, We have left behind us far, Till my awed and raptured mind Longs a resting-place to find. Shall these wonders never end? Whither do we yet ascend? Cherub. Gentle brother, onward yet; Higher wonders must be met. All these blazing worlds are dim To the light that mantles Him,— Him, who calls thee—with his own— To the bliss before his throne. There are all the pure in heart; There the loving never part. Thither pain nor sorrow come; Happy brother, welcome home! TO MARY. October 2, 1833. The forms they love, let others deck In robes of rich resplendent fold; Fling chains of pearl around the neck, And tip the graceful ear with gold; And bid the costly bawbles tell How strong the heart's affections swell. But she, whose presence cheers my life, Whose moral beauty makes my pride, Far lovelier as the trusted wife Than when the lovely trusting bride,— Jewels are no interpreter Of what the husband feels for her. I see her, on this joyful day, The idol of her happy home, Whose grateful inmates kneel and pray That Heaven would bless for years to come,— Long years of bright rejoicing life,— This honored mother, friend, and wife. Wealth has no gifts for such a day; Words try their feeble strength in vain;— Yet some slight token may convey The feelings it cannot explain. Mother,—this simple token take, A little work on Domestic Education. And prize it for a father's sake. TO THE URSA MAJOR. 1825. With what a stately and majestic step That glorious constellation of the north Treads its eternal circle! going forth Its princely way amongst the stars in slow And silent brightness. Mighty one, all hail! I joy to see thee on thy glowing path Walk, like some stout and girded giant—stern, Unwearied, resolute,—whose toiling foot Disdains to loiter on its destined way. The other tribes forsake their midnight track, And rest their weary orbs beneath the wave; But thou dost never close thy burning eye, Nor stay thy steadfast step; but on, still on, While systems change, and suns retire, and worlds Slumber and wake, thy ceaseless march proceeds. The near horizon tempts to rest in vain. Thou, faithful sentinel, dost never quit Thy long-appointed watch; but, sleepless still, Dost guard the fixed light of the universe, And bid the North forever know its place. Ages have witnessed thy devoted trust, Unchanged, unchanging. When the sons of God Sent forth that shout of joy which rang through heaven, And echoed from the outer spheres that bound The illimitable universe, thy voice Joined the high chorus; from thy radiant orbs The glad cry sounded, swelling to His praise Who thus had cast another sparkling gem, Little, but beautiful, amid the crowd Of splendors that enrich his firmament. As thou art now, so wast thou then the same. Ages have rolled their course, and Time grown gray; The earth has gathered to her womb again, And yet again, the myriads that were born Of her—uncounted, unremembered tribes. The seas have changed their beds; the eternal hills Have stooped with age; the solid continents Have left their banks; and man's imperial works,— The toil, pride, strength of kingdoms, which had flung Their haughty honors in the face of heaven, As if immortal,—have been swept away, Shattered and mouldering, buried and forgot. But time has shed no dimness on thy front, Nor touched the firmness of thy tread; youth, strength, And beauty still are thine—as clear, as bright, As when the Almighty Former sent thee forth, Beautiful offspring of his curious skill, To watch earth's northern beacon, and proclaim The eternal chorus of eternal Love. I wonder as I gaze. That stream of light, Undimmed, unquenched,—just as I see it now,— Has issued from those dazzling points, through years That go back far into eternity. Exhaustless flood! forever spent, renewed Forever! Yea, and those refulgent drops, Which now descend upon my lifted eye, Left their far fountain twice three years ago. While those winged particles, whose speed outstrips The flight of thought, were on their way, the earth Compassed its tedious circuit round and round, And, in the extremes of annual change, beheld Six autumns fade, six springs renew their bloom. So far from earth those mighty orbs revolve! So vast the void through which their beams descend! Yea, glorious lamps of God! He may have quenched Your ancient flames, and bid eternal night Rest on your spheres; and yet no tidings reach This distant planet. Messengers still come Laden with your far fire, and we may seem To see your lights still burning; while their blaze But hides the black wreck of extinguished realms, Where anarchy and darkness long have reigned. Yet what is this, which to th' astonished mind Seems measureless, and which the baffled thought Confounds? A span, a point, in those domains Which the keen eye can traverse. Seven stars Dwell in that brilliant cluster, and the sight Embraces all at once; yet each from each Recedes, as far as each of them from earth. And every star from every other burns No less remote. From the profound of heaven, Untravelled even in thought, keen, piercing rays Dart through the void, revealing to the sense Systems and worlds unnumbered. Take the glass, And search the skies. The opening skies pour down Upon your gaze thick showers of sparkling fire— Stars, crowded, thronged, in regions so remote That their swift beams—the swiftest things that be— Have travelled centuries on their flight to earth. Earth, sun, and nearer constellations! what Are ye, amid this infinite extent And multitude of God's most infinite works! And these are suns!—vast, central, living fires,— Lords of dependent systems, kings of worlds That wait as satellites upon their power, And flourish in their smile. Awake, my soul, And meditate the wonder! Countless suns Blaze round thee, leading forth their countless worlds! Worlds—in whose bosoms living things rejoice, And drink the bliss of being from the fount Of all-pervading Love. What mind can know, What tongue can utter, all their multitudes! Thus numberless in numberless abodes! Known but to thee, blest Father! Thine they are, Thy children, and thy care—and none o'erlooked Of thee!—no, not the humblest soul, that dwells Upon the humblest globe, which wheels its course Amid the giant glories of the sky, Like the mean mote that dances in the beam Amongst the thousand mirrored lamps, which fling Their wasteful splendor from the palace wall. None, none escape the kindness of thy care; All compassed underneath thy spacious wing, Each fed and guided by thy powerful hand. Tell me, ye splendid orbs! as from your thrones Ye mark the rolling provinces that own Your sway—what beings fill those bright abodes? How formed, how gifted? what their powers, their state, Their happiness, their wisdom? Do they bear The stamp of human nature? Or has God Peopled those purer realms with lovelier forms And more celestial minds? Does Innocence Still wear her native and untainted bloom? Or has Sin breathed his deadly blight abroad, And sowed corruption in those fairy bowers? Has War trod o'er them with his foot of fire? And Slavery forged his chains, and Wrath, and Hate, And sordid Selfishness, and cruel Lust, Leagued their base bands to tread out light and truth, And scatter wo where Heaven had planted joy? Or are they yet all Paradise, unfallen And uncorrupt? existence one long joy, Without disease upon the frame, or sin Upon the heart, or weariness of life— Hope never quenched, and age unknown, And death unfeared; while fresh and fadeless youth Glows in the light from God's near throne of Love? Open your lips, ye wonderful and fair! Speak, speak! the mysteries of those living worlds Unfold!—No language? Everlasting light, And everlasting silence?—Yet the eye May read and understand. The hand of God Has written legibly what man may know— The glory of the Maker. There it shines Ineffable, unchangeable; and man, Bound to the surface of this pigmy globe, May know and ask no more. In other days, When death shall give th' encumbered spirit wings, Its range shall be extended; it shall roam, Perchance, amongst those vast, mysterious spheres; Shall pass from orb to orb, and dwell in each, Familiar with its children—learn their laws, And share their state, and study and adore The infinite varieties of bliss And beauty, by the hand of Power divine Lavished on all its works. Eternity Shall thus roll on with ever-fresh delight; No pause of pleasure or improvement; world On world still opening to th' instructed mind An unexhausted universe, and time But adding to its glories; while the soul, Advancing ever to the Source of light And all perfection, lives, adores, and reigns In cloudless knowledge, purity, and bliss. SONNET ON THE COMPLETION OF NOYES S TRANSLATION OF THE PROPHETS. November, 1837. In rural life, by Jordan's fertile bed, The holy prophets learned of yore to sing; The sacred ointment bathed a ploughman's head, The shepherd boy became the minstrel king. And he who to our later ears would bring The deep, rich fervors of their ancient lays, Should dwell apart from man's too public ways, And quaff pure thoughts from Nature's quiet spring. Thus hath he chose his lot, whom city pride And college hall might well desire to claim; With sainted seers communing side by side, And freshly honoring their illustrious name. He hears them in the field at eventide, And what their spirit speaks his lucid words proclaim. THE DWELLING-PLACE OF GOD. August 17, 1813. God dwells in heaven: he rules above, In everlasting might, Beyond where stars their courses move, In uncreated light. God dwells in hell: his vengeance there Gleams through the black abode; The realms of anguish and despair Confess the present God. God dwells on earth; and all around We view his wondrous power; His terrors in the thunder sound, His mercies in the shower. When man erects a house of prayer, There God resides within, To witness every feeling there, And pardon every sin. But most of all the Lord resides Within an humble mind; The worth that modest merit hides His grace is sure to find. By pious men he may be found, And every where adored; Where'er they tread is holy ground, A temple to the Lord. O, let me find thee every where— Around me, and within! Be every day a day of prayer, And pure from every sin. HYMN, ON REVELATION IV. 2, 3; XV. 3. 1823. Around the throne of God The host angelic throngs; They spread their palms abroad, And shout perpetual songs. Him first they own, Him last and best; God ever blest, And God alone. Their golden crowns they fling Before his throne of light, And strike the rapturous string, Unceasing, day and night: “Earth, heaven, and sea, Thy praise declare; For thine they are, And thine shall be. “O holy, holy Lord, Creation's sovereign King! Thy majesty adored Let all creation sing; Who wast, and art, And art to be; Nor time shall see Thy sway depart. “Great are thy works of praise, O God of boundless might! All just and true thy ways, Thou King of saints, in light! Let all above, And all below, Conspire to show Thy power and love. “Who shall not fear thee, Lord, And magnify thy name? Thy judgments, sent abroad, Thy holiness proclaim. Nations shall throng From every shore, And all adore In one loud song.” While thus the powers on high Their swelling chorus raise, Let earth and man reply, And echo back the praise; His glory own, First, last, and best, God ever blest, And God alone. SONG. CLASS MEETING, AUGUST 25, 1813. Tune, Sandy and Jenny. Come, classmates and friends, as ye mingle once more, Renew all the feelings so oft felt before; Return from your wanderings on life's weary main, And join the glad circle of friendship again. The world we have seen is cold, wayward, and strange; It asks all our time, and gives little exchange: Then gladly we cast all its troubles away, And welcome the meeting of friendship to-day. Smooth down the rough wrinkles of care on your brow; From your eye dash the tear-drop of bitterness now; Every cloud from the spirits be banished away, And joy gild the moment of meeting to-day. Has your lot, since we parted, been sad and distressed? Has your eye lost its lustre, your bosom its rest? You here shall rekindle its happiest ray, And pillow your bosom on friendship to-day. But if Fortune has clothed in her brightness your head, And sunshine and flowers decked the path that you tread, Then bring your bright garlands, your treasures display, To gladden the meeting of friendship to-day. How oft have we crowded this table around, And pledged the high cup in festivity crowned! To-day the same board shall its treasures display, The same cup of feeling be mingled to-day. And the taste of the wine, from this goblet of love, Shall cling to our lips, and shall never remove; Our cheeks the warm glow shall forever retain, And bring back the thought of this meeting again. Then pledge Alma-Mater—our joy, and our pride! We have drunk at her bosom, we've walked at her side: Our warmest affections we ever will pay, And live to her honor:—we pledge it to-day. HYMN FOR EASTER. 1817. There is a very animated air and chorus, which I have heard sung with great delight, adapted to a triumphant song on the overthrow of the Egyptians— “Sound the loud timbrel o'er Egypt's dark sea! Jehovah hath triumphed! his people are free!” The following lines, to the same tune, are more suitable to Christian worship. They are particularly adapted to Easter Day. Lift your loud voices in triumph on high, For Jesus hath risen, and man cannot die! Vain were the terrors that gathered around him, And short the dominion of death and the grave; He burst from the fetters of darkness that bound him, Resplendent in glory, to live and to save. Loud was the chorus of angels on high— “The Savior hath risen, and man shall not die!” Glory to God, in full anthems of joy! The being he gave us death cannot destroy! Sad were the life we must part with to-morrow, If tears were our birthright, and death were our end; But Jesus hath cheered the dark valley of sorrow, And bade us, immortal, to heaven ascend. Lift, then, your voices in triumph on high, For Jesus hath risen, and man shall not die! A POEM, PRONOUNCED AT CAMBRIDGE, FEBRUARY 23, 1815, AT THE CELEBRATION OF PEACE BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND GREAT BRITAIN. Once more we meet in peace; the storm has passed, And cheerful suns ascend our skies at last; The heavy cloud has rolled its gloom away, And all the prospect brightens into day. How glad the promise to our country given! Lo, Peace descends, in angel form, from heaven, And the dark train of misery and despair Vanish, like misty forms of morning air. Where late anxiety and gloom were seen To cloud the brow, and agitate the mien,— Where our sad fates, as slowly they unrolled, Appalled alike the timid and the bold,— Returning hope has marked the scene with joy, And mirth and gladness every heart employ; Joy on the tongue, and rapture in the eye, The eager shout mounts upward to the sky! Hark! the glad bell, the deep-mouthed cannon, sounds; The city shakes, and every hill resounds. Yes, we may well rejoice, and well repair, With praise, to Him who heard our anxious prayer. Let the loud anthem fill, with joyful strain, These walls, that heard our burdened souls complain. Glory to God be given!—the God of peace, Who bids our fears subside, our troubles cease. He sent confusion—and the nation mourned; He smiled—the star of happiness returned. The cloud that veiled us was our Father's hand; The beams that cheer us shine at his command. Then, as the fabled harp its warblings woke, When on its strings the ray of morning broke, So let our hearts respond the touch of Heaven; So let our earliest hours to praise be given. Yes, we have cause of joy! O, need I say How great the boon we celebrate to-day? Need I the sufferings of the past recall? Need I—O would I could!—recount them all? Look first abroad—scan Europe's history o'er; There the wild flood has wasted every shore. For twice ten years the threatening tumult spread, While Nature languished, and her beauty fled. War drove his iron car from land to land, And scattered rage and ruin from his hand; Pale Europe trembled with the cannon's roar, And helpless anguish wailed on every shore. Destroying armies, here, triumphant passed; There, houseless wanderers shuddered in the blast; Here, wasted fields were burdened with the slain; There, prostrate cities smoked upon the plain. “When, when,” we cried, “will ruin's work be done? When shall the world behold a quiet sun? O, when shall winds untainted move the tree, And bloodless rivers mingle with the sea? When shall the glutted vulture quit the plain, And the dove wave her peaceful wings again?” But long in vain we wished, in vain we sought; Still thousands mourned—for still th' ambitious fought. “Enough,” we cried, “have tears and treasures flowed; Enough have earth and ocean drunk of blood.” But still the breeze confusion's accents bore, And every wave came crimsoned to the shore; Now the loud shouts of victory rent the air, And now were heard the moanings of despair. But Heaven at length, to save a sinking world, The restless conqueror from his chariot hurled; Doomed, as he trod the northern plain, to know “A horrid climate,” and a horrid foe. How short the reign! how sudden was the fall! Europe once scarce sufficed—Elba is now his all! Th' astonished nations, roused from long dismay, Gazed with dread wonder as he passed away; With doubting eyes surveyed the scene a while, And smiled—and wondered they were free to smile; And now look back as on a meteor's flight, The transient terror of a troubled night. The tyrant fell: his baleful influence o'er, The morn of quiet dawned on Europe's shore; Contending nations rested from their arms, And wives and mothers hushed their wild alarms. No more their cities trembled to the gun; No more the battle-cloud eclipsed the sun; The voice of mirth succeeds the harsh dispute, And yields the warrior-trumpet to the lute. No more by virgin hands are garlands twined To shade the hero's brow, his temples bind; But softest flowers are gathered for the fair, To wreathe in bands of joy the flowing hair;— Garlands, to crown the happy—not the brave; To grace the dance—not wither on the grave. See, the glad ray across the ocean streams! Our hills are brightened by the joyous beams. Arise, my country—join the general voice— Wake the deep echoes—bid thy sons rejoice! The clouds have passed, the tempest-thunders cease, And hope's gay rainbow gilds the sky of peace. Lo, on all sides the kindling raptures spread, Beam on the brow, and lift the buoyant tread. Hark! on the wind what joyful accents rise! See, novel splendors light the evening skies! The flag streams proudly to the favoring gale, And Commerce wide unfurls her swelling sail. Our eagle, quenched the lightning of his eye, Floats with unmoving wing along the sky; Far from his grasp the bloody arrows thrown, His talons wield the olive-branch alone. O, happy rescue from the ills that wait On war's tumultuous and uncertain state! O, happy rescue from the fearful train, That thickened round, of wretchedness and pain! Look back, and see the evils that were near— The dangers, sufferings, poverty, and fear. Drained was the public purse,—the credit gone,— And private want urged public ruin on. Who then the deep despondency could chase, The settled sadness of the patriot's face? Who could dispel the darkness of the breast, And lay its chill and torturing fears to rest, When the sick heart beheld its prospects droop, And courage fainted on the tomb of hope? The past—how sad the marks of woe it bore! How blank the dreary waste that stretched before! But yet some gleams of glory rushed between, And threw a dazzling brightness on the scene. Whose heart was still, that heard the deeds of might— Th' unequalled grandeur of our ocean fight? Who felt not proud, when each returning wave Rolled home a glorious tribute to the brave? Who felt not proud, th' ennobling tale to tell— “Our fathers' spirits in their children dwell”? Who but the ardor of the contest knows, From the high opening to the signal close— From Hull's first flash, that woke th' astonished main, To the last peal, that echoed on Champlain? Ye gallant few, that trod the mighty deep, Enough is done; now let your terrors sleep; Sleep—like your native ocean—still, yet dread. Its spirit slumbers—but it is not dead; Be the calm moved, again its fury roars, Raves to the blast, and dashes to the shores. But now enough; retire, your country's pride; Fame shouts your honors loud, and spreads them wide; Enjoy the sounds upon a tranquil main, Nor ask the triumph of the fight again. Hushed be the war-storm on the sea and lake; Long hushed the passions that its rage would wake. And hail the flag that waves upon our shore; Proud let it wave—and wave forevermore. True, in the northern war it bowed its head, Its stars were clouded, and their lustre fled. Our capital beheld its deep disgrace; Hide, ye that saw it, hide your blushing face. Americans! and see your city fired! O, who were they that saw it—and retired? But stay—for those that bade the eagle roam May well be found a feeble guard at home. But plant the standard where are men to fight, Ne'er shall it droop in war, or trail in flight. It must not flutter in a foreign air— A freeman's arm is weak and nerveless there; And freedom's star alike its beam denies To him who fights for conquest, and who flies. But range our soldiers on their native soil, They fear no danger, and they shun no toil; They wait th' assault in thick and firm array, Lift the high hand, and scatter wide dismay. Such there have been, who met the fierce attack, Rushed on opposing troops, and drove them trembling back. And such, had rash invasion touched our coast, Such would have been our hardy yeomen's boast; They, like our sires, had bid the invaders know Columbia bears no laurel for a foe. But, ah! how poor the boast, to say we dared! How small the glory, to the woe compared! What boots it that the banners of our foe Hang in our halls, a proud, imposing show, If blood and tears the gaudy trophies steep, To tell how many bled, how many weep! Or that the laurel shades us, since it grows In chief luxuriance where the brave repose? Say, will its leaves assuaging balm impart To ease the anguish of the wounded heart? Say, will the honors, that on fame attend, Console the widow, or restore the friend? In victory's day, the shout is all we hear; The sob of sorrow reaches not the ear. The dazzling pomp is all that meets the light; The toil, the suffering, is concealed from sight. But could we tell how vast th' amount of woe— Behold the wounded, and their tortures know— Go to the chamber where the widow sighs, And see the orphans' tears, and hear their cries— Mark all the frantic transports of despair, The piercing shriek, the mingled curse and prayer— O, we should bleed at heart, when Victory's voice Rang through the crowd, and bade the land rejoice; Should shrink with shuddering from war's iron sound, And tread its proudest trophies to the ground. Then hail, sweet Peace, man's high, yet injured friend! No gloomy terrors on thy steps attend; No forms of woe, no demons armed with wrath, But quiet, hope, and plenty wait thy path. War wastes around him with consuming breath; Our comforts fade, our friendships sink in death. He treads along a track of living fire, And science, arts, and happiness expire. Demon, be gone! we hate thy savage mien;— But Peace, sweet nymph, be thou our lovely queen. Come, soothe our sorrows with thy cheerful song; Bring all thy blessings, and continue long. Lo, Plenty springs beneath thy verdant tread, And Art, reviving, lifts to heaven her head. White o'er the billows moves th' adventurous sail, And riches pour to land with every gale. The city sees its splendid domes increase, With all the grandeur and the fame of Greece; The country smiles in richer verdure crowned, While cheerful toil and rustic mirth resound; And Science sees her favorite mansions rise, Till Harvard's turrets tremble in the skies; Till other Miltons stretch a loftier flight, And other Newtons tread new fields of light. Hail, hail, the distant beauty of our land, That Hope has pictured with a glowing hand! Roll on, ye happy years, in rapture roll; Pour all your promise on th' impatient soul— The brilliant promise of a lovelier day, Of purer light, and clear, unclouded ray. Fathers, your sons shall then in virtues shine, That raise the human nearer the divine. Mothers, your daughters, more accomplished then, Shall smile with sweeter smiles on worthier men. Then public good, on private virtue built, Shall stand unmoved by vice, unstained by guilt. Then, guided by the wisdom from above, We all shall harmonize in perfect love; Shall cast the trophies of our wars away, And nobler honors to the world display. LINES FOR MUSIC. IMITATED FROM THE GERMAN WORDS TO A CANON FOR THREE VOICES, BY J. H. C. BOMHARDT. November, 1837. The day of life is not all desolate; Paternal Love o'er all presideth; And though the doubting heart May mourn when hopes depart, Serenely Faith amid the storm abideth. The darkest clouds of Fate Are bright when Love confideth. TO E. A. W., ON HER MARRIAGE. Concord, N. H., August 22, 1831. Absent! We are not absent, dear. Of all the happy throng you see, Not one in spirit is more near, Or breathes a heartier wish, than we. So take our kiss, and with it share A brother's sister's love and prayer. May He who blessed your early lot With all that makes a happy home, O'erwatch, with equal love, the spot That waits your life in years to come. Trust Him,—let weal or woe betide;— Trust;—and what can you ask beside? HYMN, FOR THE DEDICATION OF A CHURCH. April, 1839. Tune, Lyons. We rear not a temple, like Judah's of old, Whose portals were marble, whose vaultings were gold; No incense is lighted, no victims are slain, No monarch kneels praying to hallow the fane. More simple and lowly the walls that we raise, And humbler the pomp of procession and praise, Where the heart is the altar whence incense shall roll, And Messiah the King who shall pray for the soul. O Father, come in! but not in the cloud Which filled the bright courts where thy chosen ones bowed; But come in that spirit of glory and grace, Which beams on the soul and illumines the race. O, come in the power of thy life-giving Word, And reveal to each heart its Redeemer and Lord; Till Faith bring the peace to the penitent given, And Love fill the air with the fragrance of heaven. The pomp of Moriah has long passed away, And soon shall our frailer erection decay; But the souls that are builded in worship and love Shall be temples to God, everlasting above. THANKSGIVING SONG. November, 1840. Tune, Sandy and Jenny. Come, uncles and cousins; come, nieces and aunts; Come, nephews and brothers,—no wonts and no cants: Put business, and shopping, and school-books away; The year has rolled round;—it is Thanksgiving-day. Come home from the college, ye ringlet-haired youth, Come home from your factories, Ann, Kate, and Ruth; From the anvil, the counter, the farm come away; Home, home, with you, home;—it is Thanksgiving-day. The table is spread, and the dinner is dressed; The cooks and the mothers have all done their best: No caliph of Bagdad e'er saw such display, Or dreamed of a treat like our Thanksgiving-day. Pies, puddings, and custards, pigs, oysters, and nuts,— Come forward and seize them, without ifs or buts; Bring none of your slim, little appetites here;— Thanksgiving-day comes only once in a year. Thrice welcome the day in its annual round! What treasures of love in its bosom are found! New England's high holiday, ancient and dear! 'Twould be twice as welcome, if twice in a year. Now children revisit the darling old place, And brother and sister, long parted, embrace; The family ring is united once more, And the same voices shout at the old cottage door. The grandfather smiles on the innocent mirth, And blesses the Power that has guarded his hearth; He remembers no trouble, he feels no decay, But thinks his whole life has been Thanksgiving-day. Then praise for the past and the present we sing, And trustful await what the future may bring: Let doubt and repining be banished away, And the whole of our lives be a Thanksgiving-day. HYMN. FOR THE CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION AT HARVARD COLLEGE, September 7, 1836. Give praise to the God of our fathers! give praise! At the shrine where they worshiped devoutly adore; Kneel down, as they knelt in their perilous days, His goodness to bless, and his favor implore. For “Christ and the Church” they resisted and fled, His cross for their banner, his word for their guide; On a new world the broad light of Freedom they shed, And poured through the wilderness Truth's living tide. Then rose the high temple, the home of the soul, And the proud hall of Science, the strength of the state, That Religion and Letters might join to control The hearts of the young, and the toils of the great. We praise thee, O God, for the days that are gone; We surrender the future in faith to thy hand; O, cloud not the hope of our new-risen dawn, O, pour the full sunlight of day on our land! ODE, ON OCCASION OF THE CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION OF HARVARD COLLEGE, September 7, 1836. Fling wide the temple door! The altar and the choir prepare! Let the high chant and solemn prayer Their holy raptures pour. For, lo, in festal pomp arrayed, Forth issuing from their classic shade, The sons of Science crowd the sacred floor. O, meetly to the house of praise The fair and ancient mother goes, And on Religion's altar lays The offering due to Him who all bestows. Grateful Memory brings her treasures, Gathered through the centuries gone; Hope, in sweet, prophetic measures, Hastens brighter ages on. The solemn rites let Heaven with favor crown; The praise receive, nor on the vision frown. Barbarian darkness dwelt In hopeless night upon the land; Till England's Pilgrims touched the strand, And in the forest knelt. Then light broke in; the kindling dawn Blushed on mountain, grove, and lawn; They planted round their growing home The classic lights of Greece and Rome; On every hill-top bade to shine The blesséd cross of Palestine,— Blended beams of heaven and earth! Like morning on the mountains spread, A bright and genial day they shed, And called the glories of New England forth. Exalt their honored name! Heroic founders of the state! Inscribe their titles with the great, Who live in deathless fame! Nor last upon th' immortal scroll Young Harvard's modest worth enroll; Let his own halls resound with loud acclaim! Through languid years of pain and gloom, He faded slow, and early died; Passed from the altar to the tomb, And wrought in death the work that life denied. Stranger in the infant nation Where he lingered but to die, Visions of its exaltation Dawned on his believing eye. Cheered by the view, serenely smiled the youth, And gave his little all to Christ and Truth. O, from that little rill What soul-enlivening waters flowed, What peace and hope to man's abode, What joy to Zion's hill! As when along the desert land, Smitten by the prophet's hand, The rock its gushing torrent sent To bless the tribes where'er they went. The years are passed, the fathers gone; But still the fertile flood rolls on: Free and glorious be its flow,— A boundless wave of life and youth,— Till knowledge, liberty, and truth, Restore lost Eden to our world below. HYMN IN SICKNESS. March, 1836. Father, thy gentle chastisement Falls kindly on my burdened soul; I see its merciful intent, To warn me back to thy control; And pray, that, while I kiss the rod, I may find perfect peace with God. The errors of my heart I know; I feel my deep infirmities; For, often, virtuous feelings glow, And holy purposes arise, But, like the morning clouds decay, As empty, though as fair, as they. Forgive the weakness I deplore; And let thy peace abound in me, That I may trust my heart no more, But wholly cast myself on thee. O, let my Father's strength be mine, And my devoted life be thine. ANTI-SLAVERY SONG. February, 1843. Tune, Wild Hunt of Lutzow. The Pilgrims are launched on the wild winter main, Their bark on the foam madly tossing: The tempest is high; but its threats they disdain; They are fleeing from Tyranny's sceptre and chain; It is Liberty's sea they are crossing. Loud rings their cry o'er the stormy wave— “Freedom! Death or freedom! Freedom, or ocean our grave!” Borne high on the breath of the soft summer gale, The slave-ship is proudly careering; What sights of despair and what voices of wail, What anguish and madness beneath that fair sail, To hopeless captivity steering! Hark! hark! from the black-hold the stifled cry— “Freedom! Death or freedom!” Hear how it pierces the sky! In the darkness and rain of the chill autumn night, The slave from the cane-field is striding; Through hunger and hardship he urges his flight; Nor perils dismay him, nor blood-hounds affright, By the north star his weary feet guiding. Help, help for him—answer his eager cry— “Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!” Tell him that rescue is nigh. Up, up with your banners to honor the brave! O'er your forefathers' tombs be they flying! And hail to the hero, though black and a slave, Who shrinks from oppression, but fears not the grave, And throws off his fetters by dying. Join—join in the shout that he flings on high, “Freedom! Death or freedom!” Join—'twas your forefathers' cry! FOR MR. EMERSON'S ORDINATION. March, 1829. “PREACHING PEACE BY JESUS CHRIST” How beautiful the feet of those Who publish peace from Heaven! How glad the tidings they disclose From Him to save us given! Glory to God! Good will to men, And peace on earth, attend his reign. The world was dark with woe and strife; Pain, sin, and death, bore sway; And souls, ordained to nobler life, In guilt and bondage lay. His word went forth—earth's evils cease, And ransomed spirits rest in peace. That peace which earth can never give, And never take away, Shall conquer time and death, and live Through heaven's eternal day. Praise to the Lord, whose boundless grace Redeems and saves our sinful race. THE CHURCH AT EAST LEXINGTON. May, 1842. The Follen Church—how beautiful it stands, Graceful and calm in that sequestered nook! How doth a blessing from its placid look Flow o'er the hamlet and its fertile lands! Fit monument to him who placed it there; Whose soul—all truth, benignity, and grace— Beamed forth in benedictions, from a face Where might and sweetness met in union rare. O light of love, too early quenched in death!— Yet, as that fane, though crumbled to the ground, Would still survive, in sacred influence round, So flows, and shall, from him a quickening breath: Death to the good man is but life's extension; Earth mourns his loss; Heaven joys in his ascension. FOR FAST-DAY. 1813. Great King of all, our nation's God, O, hear thy people's suppliant cry; We bow beneath thy angry rod, We raise to thee the tearful eye. Dark tempests brood upon our land, And sorrow sits on every face; O, may we own thy chastening hand! O, may we seek and find thy grace! Thy favor, Lord, had raised us high— High as our loftiest hopes could soar; But humbled now in dust we lie, And peace and glory are no more. For we abused the gifts of Heaven, Consumed thy bounties on our lust, Despised the word thy grace had given, And trod thy promise in the dust. Lord, we with penitence confess; We own thy grace, our sins we own; Deign yet to turn, receive, and bless, Nor drive thy children from thy throne. THE INCOMPREHENSIBILITY OF DEITY. LINES SUGGESTED BY THE FOLLOWING WORDS: “O MON FILS, ADOREZ DIEU ET NE CHERCHEZ PAS À LE CONNAÎTRE.”........ANACHARSIS. 1811. God is a spirit, great and just; We his dependent creatures are: His pleasure called us from the dust; His goodness keeps us, and his care. He dwells enthroned in light on high; He lives throughout the boundless whole; Invisible to mortal eye, Unsearchable by human soul. To feeble man 'twas never given The great mysterious One to know, To scan the Majesty of heaven, Or make his essence known below. Enough for us, his sovereign word Reveals him as the God of love, The just, the ever-gracious Lord, Who can but righteousness approve;— Unfolds his blissful heaven above, And glory for his children there; While those who slight his offered love Shall sink to darkness and despair. There, also, is enough revealed, To guide us in the way we go; And what his wisdom has concealed Might be but misery to know. O, then adore th' eternal Mind With wonder, gratitude, and fear; Nor seek, what man may never find, The knowledge of his essence here. ON OPENING OUR ORGAN, November 9, 1822. Tune, Great Milton. All nature's works His praise declare, To whom they all belong; There is a voice in every star, In every breeze a song. Sweet music fills the world abroad With strains of love and power; The stormy sea sings praise to God, The thunder and the shower. To God the tribes of ocean cry, And birds upon the wing; To God the powers that dwell on high Their tuneful tribute bring. Like them let man the throne surround, With them loud chorus raise, While instruments of loftier sound Assist his feeble praise. Great God, to thee we consecrate Our voices and our skill; We bid the pealing organ wait To speak alone thy will. O, teach its rich and swelling notes To lift our souls on high; And while the music round us floats, Let earth-born passion die. OUR SOCIETY'S AUTHORS. READ TO THE ?. ?. ?. AFTER THE ANNUAL DINNER, August 29, 1839. I speak you no speech, and I sing you no song, And I hope not to keep you a minute too long; I but rise to propose that you drink, as a toast, “Our Society's Authors;”—not one,—but a host. I premise, that perhaps you're not fully aware— Though I am—how many and noted they are. Of those, in whose honors our land is so happy, How many belong to the Phi Beta Kappa! To recite all their names I by no means insist; 'Twere a little too long for a post-dinner list. I leave out each annual poet and orator: That catalogue doubtless we all have memoriter. I leave out the Philistine phalanx of editors, Accounting them rather our debtors than creditors. And I silently pass, to save patience and time, All mere pamphleteers, both in prose and in rhyme. I propose but the bonos, meliores, et pessimos, Who appear in octavos and large duodecimos. (And thus I escape all allusion to self; For no big book of mine burdens any one's shelf.) First, gravely we fill, with our waters or wines. To the names of the gravest—our brother Divines. And, beginning at home, I produce on the scene Our brother the Editor,—no more the Dean,— Whose two ample octaves, erelong to be five, Are enough to make any man's memory thrive;— Then Norton, the critic, sagacious, profound, The fervent cloud-hater, who builds on firm ground; And Harris, whose learned work, prized at a high rate, Has twice been purloined by a base British pirate; Our modest translator of prophecy, Noyes, And the other translators, whose versions rejoice The students that plod through the tomes of Mosheim, Or seek the Eclectic, or love German rhyme; Then Burnap and Furness—each one with a volume; And Jenks, too,—with quarto, close printed and solemn; And Dewey, whose travels and sermons are fame; And Channing, the shout of whose eloquent name, As a dear benediction or proud acclamation, Rings loud from the echoes of every known nation. Fill, next, to the Lawyers, whose regal delight Is in extra-sized octaves, bound neatly in white. And here,—as before,—to begin with a resident, We drink to the Author, the Judge, and our President; Felix prole Librum—and each one a star, Cœlicolæ omnes—all lights of the bar. And around him arranged, lo! an eminent band, Of Sullivan, Pickering, Phillips, and Rand, And others demanding our hearty applause, Who honor their country by serving her laws. In order of merit and honor next follow The diploma'd disciples of healing Apollo:— Men as scanty in books as they're various in humors;— From Warren, who prints about heart-pains and tumors, To Oliver's treatise of learned Physiology, And Bigelow's Botany, Flora, Technology. Now, leaving the learned professions, our glass Let us fill to the more MISCELLANEOUS CLASS. First, honor, and laud, as are due, let us render To the Governor's volume of eloquent splendor. From one of the name pass we on the other, And quaff to the author of “Europe,” his brother; And since all are brothers alike at this board, I venture to mention “Palmyra” restored. Then defer not the notice to one moment later, Of those in the precincts of fair Alma Mater;— Her Hedge, Farrar, Webster, and Cleaveland, and Peirce, Whose labors can hardly be hitched into verse,— Philosophical titles, euphonious in science, But setting the Muse and her rhymes at defiance;— And him who once lectured in old Harvard Hall, But doffed the Professor at Madison's call,— That true “old man eloquent,”—Adams,—in age Filling up the strong lines of the Lecturer's page. Then those who have TRAVELLED o'er mountain and main; In Italy Lyman, and Cushing in Spain, And Bigelow, roving from Scotland to Parthia, And Devens, six weeks at the Vineyard of Martha. Of Poets—our own—who have printed their tomes, We all have known Mellen, and all laughed with Holmes. We boast that the nervous and fanciful powers Of Dana, the Idle Man, also, are ours; And Bryant—the world never rings to his fame, But our bosoms beat high to a brother's fair name. Of Historians next, lo! the lengthening procession: First, Bradford, Old Colony's honest expression; Then Allen, whose ardor no industry dims, With his five hundred Lives, and his six hundred Hymns; Then the many fair writers in Sparks's Biography, First trying their hands in small historiography; As Upham, the eloquent champion of Vane; And Peabody, guessing the matter out plain; And Francis, portraying, as true pen should paint, The career of the Indians' apostle and saint. Next Quincy, who wrote his great father's career, And has added his mother's within the last year; Then Irving, who brings to his volumes of truth The grace that adorned the light tales of his youth; And Sparks, with his chapters transparent as day, Inflexibly true, like the man they display; And Bancroft, laborious, brilliant, and terse, Enrobing grave truth in the diction of verse. And Prescott, so favored beyond poet's dream, To find, and then equal, that great epic theme. When the nation's historical fame they discuss, We will claim that that “thunder” belongs all to us. Thus far of the living. But let me pass on To utter the eminent names that are gone. They speak, though they live not; their tones and their looks Come back with their souls, when we turn to their books. Thus Tudor, Pierce, Frisbie, and Thacher, still live; Dehon, Haven, Stearns, and the Abbotts survive; Amidst us do Parker and Bancroft still stand, And Bowditch and Buckminster hallow our band. Then pledge we in love, without fear or misgiving, To the fame of the dead, and the hopes of the living. We are proud of their works, we are proud of their number; Their honor is ours, and our love shall not slumber. Let Fame sound her trumpet, and tell to the breeze, And the breeze to the nations o'er mountains and seas, That our ancient fraternity, headed by Story, Quaffs to its authors the wine-cup of glory. HYMN, FOR THE CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION IN HINGHAM, September 28, 1835. Tune, St. Martin's. We praise the Lord, who o'er the sea Our exiled fathers led, And on them in the wilderness His light and glory shed. In want and fear, for many a year, They spread their scanty board; Yet loud and strong their grateful song The Giver's hand adored. Two hundred years have passed away; The desert frowns no more; And glory, such as Judah knew, Crowns hill-side, vale, and shore. Then louder still, o'er plain and hill, Send forth the shout of praise, And bid it run from sire to son, Through all succeeding days. HYMN, FOR THE GRADUATING CLASS OF THE DIVINITY SCHOOL, July, 1842. Tune, Portuguese Hymn Farewell, dear scenes of study and devotion, Shades of the soul, in saintly musing trod; Where, far from earth, and rude life's vain commotion, We walked in truth's bright beam, And drank of faith's pure stream, And sought a true alliance with the Son of God. Those precious days of preparation ended, Trembling our steps forsake the cherished sod; Like Him, on whom the anointing dove descended, We stand at life's broad gate, And, looking upward, wait The unction that shall seal us for the church of God. Sin, sloth, and self, abjured before the altar, With fresh resolve our pilgrim path we plod; Help, Lord, from heaven, that ne'er our feet may falter; But gird our steadfast youth With boldness, love, and truth, And fill our trusting bosoms with the peace of God. We fear no conflicts with Christ's banner o'er us; We dread no ill beneath our Shepherd's rod; His strength and peace, his cross and heaven, before us, Shall arm our feeble faith, And quell the darts of death, And win immortal succor through the grace of God. Glory and honor be to Him forever, Who aids and cheers us with auspicious nod; To him be consecrate all high endeavor; For him all toils be done, For him all trophies won, Till grace shall crown our souls before the throne of God. TO MARY, ON HER BIRTHDAY. Fairfield, Conn., October 2, 1828. “The dawn is overcast; the morning lowers, And heavily in clouds brings on the day;” The roads are miry with continued showers, And rain and mud deter me from my way; And yet to me it all looks fair and bright, For on this day my Mary saw the light. Many returns to you of this sweet day! And each return more happy than the last! Peace to your heart, as thoughtful you survey The various fortunes of the checkered past; And bright and glorious be the visions given That clothe your coming years in hues of heaven. SONG, FOR THE ABBOT FESTIVAL, Exeter, N. H., August 23, 1838. Tune, Sandy and Jenny. From the highways and byways of manhood we come, And gather like children about an old home; We return from life's weariness, tumult, and pain, Rejoiced in our hearts to be schoolboys again. The senator comes from the hall of debate, The governor steps from the high chair of state, The judge leaves the bench to “the law's wise delay,” Rejoiced to be schoolboys again for a day. The parson his pulpit has left unsupplied, The doctor has put his old sulky aside, The lawyer his client has turned from the door, And all are of Exeter,—schoolboys once more. O, glad to our eyes are these dear scenes displayed, The halls where we studied, the fields where we strayed; There is change, there is change; but we will not deplore; Enough that we feel ourselves schoolboys once more. Enough that once more our old master we meet, The same as of yore when we sat at his feet; Let us place on his brow every laurel we've won, And show that each pupil is also a son. And when to the harsh scenes of life we return, Our hearts with the glow of this meeting shall burn; Its calm light shall cheer till earth's school time is o'er, And prepare us in heaven for one meeting more. HYMN. FAMILY MEETING. August 20, 1835. In this glad hour, when children meet, And home with them their children bring, Our hearts with one affection beat, One song of praise our voices sing. For all the faithful, loved and dear, Whom thou so kindly, Lord, hast given; For those who still are with us here, And those who wait for us in heaven;— For every past and present joy, For honor, competence, and health, For hopes which time may not destroy, Our soul's imperishable wealth;— For all, accept our humble praise; Still bless us, Father, by thy love; And when are closed our mortal days, Unite us in one home above. HYMN, AT THE ORDINATION OF MESSRS. BARNARD AND GRAY. November 2, 1834. Tune, Hotham. “Feed my sheep,” the Saviour said To the chosen of his love; “Feed them with the living bread; Guide them to the fold above. Feed my lambs,” the Shepherd cried, “Ere their tender hearts are cold, Chilled with worldliness and pride, Bring them safely to my fold. “Preach my gospel to the poor, Sunk in earthly want and woe; Give them treasures that endure, Peace and heaven-born hope bestow. At the hedges and highways, Where in dust and sin they roam, Loud the gospel summons raise, Call the hapless wanderers home.” On the sacred errand bent, Two and two they sallied forth; Darkness vanished where they went; Peace immortal dawned on earth. In their holy steps to tread, Other two we now ordain: On their path thy glory shed; Lord, their steadfast feet sustain. Heralds to the young and low, Give them words to touch and win; Words to calm the sobs of woe, Words to wake the sleep of sin. Heralds of eternal truth, Arm them with immortal love; Spread thy shield around their youth, Take their honored age above. A CURE FOR SEA-SICKNESS: LINES ON A NEW NOTION; COMPOSED AT SEA, Monday Night, April 6, 1829. I sing the story of the ancient ark,— That oarless, rudderless, and sailless bark, Which through the deluge bore the holy clerk, And saved the creatures in its chambers dark. The clouds collect; the various tribes embark; The fountains of the deep break up,—and hark! Above the matins of the early lark The thunders toll. Beyond th' appointed mark Of ocean's ancient shores, this great nearch Rides o'er the ruins of earth's fertile park. How sad the wide-spread ravage to remark! Quenched of all earth-born life the moving spark! And wrecks, and beasts, and human corses stark, Throng round the life-boat of the patriarch. The mouths roll on. He sends the dove to mark Th' abating floods. And now they disembark: Men kneel; the creatures leap, fly, scream, and bark; And o'er them circles Mercy's radiant arc. THE VISION OF LIBERTY, AN ODE, RECITED BEFORE THE PHI BETA KAPPA SOCIETY OF HARVARD UNIVERSITY, August 26, 1824. The matter of the following lines is not a poetical invention, but the simple versification of what was actually dreamed about thirty years ago. The dreams were repeated to the writer by one who heard them at the time, and to whose recollection they were brought by the exhilarating events of the last week. An English lady residing in Hingham, about 1794, imagined that there stood before her a vast and venerable building, which, as she was looking at it, began to wax hot and red, and at length, as if with the violence of the heat, flew to pieces and disappeared; when on the spot where it had stood, appeared a beautiful female figure, whom she knew to be the goddess of Liberty. About the same time, a gentleman in Massachusetts saw in his dream a temple of wonderful magnificence and beauty. As he was approaching to enter it, a bell sounded from the dome with an uncommonly musical tone. He cast his eye up, and was surprised to see written upon it, in golden letters, the name of Fayette. The irregular stanza was chosen simply because it seemed to offer fewest embarassments to a person writing in haste. Is there some genial spirit of the night, That rules the sleeping mind, And pours within a more effectual light, When the closed eye of sense is blind? Is it some spirit, that, in vision, The secrets of futurity betrays, Unveiling those bright scenes Elysian, That wait for man in better days? Or it it but that Fancy strays In bolder and prophetic ways, When slumbering Reason drops her stern control; And, from her ploding interference freed, Resumes some native power to read The unscaled records of Time's lengthening scroll? The evening heavens were calm and bright; No dimness rested on the glittering light That sparkled from that wilderness of worlds on high. Those distant suns burned on with quiet ray; The placid planets held their modest way; And silence reigned profound o'er earth, and sea, and sky. O, what an hour for lofty thought! My! spirit burned within; I caught A holy inspiration from the hour. Around me man and nature slept; Alone my solemn watch I kept, Till morning dawned and Sleep resumed her power. A vision passed upon my soul. I still was gazing up to heaven, As in the early hours of even; I still beheld the planets roll, And all those countless sons of light Flame from the broad blue arch, and guide the moonless night;— When, lo! upon the plain, Just where it skirts the swelling main, A massive castle, far and high, In towering grandeur broke upon my eye. Proud in its strength and years, the ponderous pile Flung up its time-defying towers; Its lofty gates seemed scornfully to smile At vain assault of human powers, And threats and arms deride. Its gorgeous carvings of heraldic pride In giant masses graced the walls above, And dungeons yawned below. Yet ivy there and moss their garlands wove, Grave, silent chronicles of Time's protracted flow. Bursting on my steadfast gaze, See, within, a sudden blaze! So small at first, the zephyr's lightest swell, That scarcely stirs the pine-tree top, Nor makes the withered leaf to drop, The feeble fluttering of that flame would quell. But soon it spread— Waving, rushing, fierce, and red— From wall to wall, from tower to tower, Raging with resistless power, Till every fervent pillar glowed, And every stone seemed burning coal, Instinct with living heat, that flowed Like streaming radiance from the kindled pole. Beautiful, fearful, grand, Silent as death, I saw the fabric stand. At length a crackling sound began; From side to side throughout the pile it ran; And louder yet, and louder grew, Till now in rattling thunder peals it slew. Huge shivered fragments from the pillars broke, Like fiery sparkles from the anvil's stroke. The shattered walls were rent and riven, And piecemeal driven Like blazing comets through the troubled sky. 'Tis done! What centuries had reared In quick explosion disappeared, Nor even its ruins met my wondering eye. But in their place,— Bright with more than human grace, Robed in more than mortal seeming, Radiant glory in her face, And eyes with heaven's own brightness beaming— Rose a fair, majestic form, As the mild rainbow from the storm. I marked her smile, I knew her eye; And when, with gesture of command, She waved aloft the cap-crowned wand, My slumbers fled 'mid shouts of “Liberty!” Read ye the dream? and know ye not How truly it unlocked the word of fate? Went not the flame from this illustrious spot, And spreads it not, and burns, in every state? And when their old and cumbrous walls, Filled with this spirit, glow intense, Vainly they rear their impotent defence:— The fabric falls! That fervent energy must spread, Till Despotism's towers be overthrown, And, in their stead, Liberty stand alone! Hasten the day, just Heaven; Accomplish thy design; And let the blessings thou hast freely given Freely on all men shine; Till equal rights be equally enjoyed, And human power for human good employed; Till law, not man, the sovereign rule sustain, And Peace and Virtue undisputed reign. Again I slept; and where that maid had been, Another temple rose upon the scene. And O, what human words can render Fitting tribute to the grace, And the more than earthly splendor, Of that bright and matchless place! From thousand columns sprung the ample dome, Of heaven's own form and heaven's own billiancy; It seemed some glorious spirit's favorite home, Breathing of love and pure tranquillity. No proud defiance, frowning there, Looked threat and insult on the gloomy air, But quiet dignity in conscious strength reposed. No arms, no guards, no dungeons deep and closed; But open, free—like God's free day, That shines and smiles on all with heaven-descended ray. Delighted and entranced, I eagerly advanced To enter and explore the glories there confined. But suddenly, with tuneful stroke, From the lofty dome a loud peal broke, Flinging soft, silver tones upon the wind. With strong, melodious swell, Rung forth a magic chime, that fell Like midnight music on the sleeper's ear, Making it paradise to sleep and hear. That strange, mysterious sound, Soft as the mellow horn'st most gentle note, Seemed lightly on the buoyant winds to float, And spread through all the world around. O'er the mountain and the plain, Beyond the desert and the main, Wherever man is found, Went forth that winning sound, And breathed its summons in his raptured ear. The tone went home to every heart; It bade the thrilling tears of Freedom start, And ransomed nations in her halls appear. My eager eyes I upward threw, The wondrous instrument to view, In which such piercing power and ravishing sweetness met; And on its splendid form, behold, Inscribed in living light and gold, That all mankind might read—thy honored name, Fayette! O for a tongue of fire, to tell How gloriously the vision was fulfilled! How, at the touch of Liberty's sweet bell, The hearts of countless myriads have thrilled, And Destiny her brightest page unfurled, Roused by the spirit that had waked the world! Even Europe loves the sweet and stirring note; Southern Columbia rises at the call, With kindling eye and tyrant-scorning tread; And Greece calls back the spirits of her dead, And bids her ancient banners float Where Freedom's martyrs fell, and proudly still shall fall. O Greece, reviving Greece! thy name Kindless the scholar's and the patriot's flame. On thee our anxious eyes we bend. For thee our earnest prayers ascend, That never may thy lifted banner fall. For thee, thine own strong eloquence Pleads in Columbia's legislative hall. And is there none to arm in thy defence? No ardent, generous, devoted youth, To pledge his fortunes and his truth, And, nobly exiled, cross the wave, To join th' oppressed and aid the brave? Go forth, if such there be, go forth; Stand by that nation in her second birth. Coupled with her high cause, thy name, Like his whose welcome presence draws A nation's rapturous applause, Shall ring through earth from sea to sea, The favorite watchword of the free, The purest shout of fame. And when Time's slow and favoring hand Restore the glories of that lovely land, Thither, perchance, thy pilgrimage thou'lt take; And while earth's older empires shake, Receive the welcome of the new; Which round thy steps in grateful shouts shall break, Than those which follow kings—how heartier and more true! TO MRS. M. R. C. E., ON HER MARRIAGE, December 6, 1832. To guard the marriage ring, Another ring I send: Protector of that sacred thing, About your finger let it cling, And with its magic circle blend, The image of your absent friend. To guard the marriage vow, Another vow must bind— To Him whose care and grace allow The cheerful hopes that gladden now, And in whose love the trusting mind Its only deathless home can find. That heavenly love shall be The strength to this of earth; Shall guard its truth and purity, From change, decay, and sorrow free, And pour upon your humble hearth A light of pure, celestial birth. CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION OF THE BOSTON THURSDAY LECTURE, October 17, 1833. Like Israel's hosts to exile driven, Across the flood the Pilgrims fled; Their hands bore up the ark of Heaven, And Heaven their trusting footsteps led, Till on these savage shores they trod, And won the wilderness for God. There, where their weary ark found rest, Another Zion proudly grew, In more than Judah's glory dressed, With light that Israel never knew. From sea to sea her empire spread, Her temple heaven, and Christ her head. Then let the grateful church, to-day, Its ancient rite with gladness keep; Our father's God! their children pray Thy blessing, though the fathers sleep. O bless! as thou hast blessed the past, While earth, and time, and heaven shall last. FOR AN ORDINATION. March, 1829. Tune, Old Hundred O Thou, who on thy chosen Son Didst send thy Spirit like a dove, To mark the long-expected One, And seal the Messenger of love,— And, when the heralds of his name Went forth his glorious truth to spread, Didst send it down in tongues of flame, To hallow each devoted head,— So, Lord, thy servant now inspire With holy unction from above; Give him the tongue of living fire, Give him the temper of the dove. Lord, hear thy suppliant church to-day! Accept our work, our souls possess. 'Tis ours to labor, watch, and pray; Be thine to cheer, sustain, and bless. DEDICATION AT LECHMERE POINT, December 25, 1827. Tune, Tolland. O Thou, who for thyself didst raise Creation's wondrous frame, To be a temple to thy praise, An altar to thy name,— And yet art pleased to dwell below, And there thy name record, Where'er assembling mortals go, To own their common Lord,— O, write thy name in favor here; And, while we bend in prayer, Lord, bid thy glorious cloud appear, Thy presence to declare. As in thy gracious courts above, So in these courts below, Reveal to every soul thy love, And heavenly peace bestow. Here may thy holy will be learned, And here thy will be done; Till all to truth and Heaven be turned Through thy beloved Son,— Till all who kneel in worship here, Be faithfully prepared In higher temples to appear, Crowned with thy great reward. FOR THANKSGIVING. 1825. Tune, Melton Mowbray. Father of earth and heaven, Whose arm upholds creation, To thee we raise the voice of praise, And bend in adoration. We praise the Power that made us; We praise the Love that blesses; While every day that rolls away Thy gracious care confesses. Life is from thee, blest Father; From thee our breathing spirits; And thou dost give to all that live The bliss that each inherits. Day, night, and rolling seasons, And all that live embraces, With bliss are crowned, with joy abound, And claim our thankful praises. Though trial and affliction May cast their dark shade o'er us, Thy love doth throw a heavenly glow Of light on all before us. That Love has smiled from heaven To cheer our path of sadness, And lead the way, through earth's dull day, To realms of endless gladness. That light of love and glory Has shone through Christ the Savior, The holy Guide who lived and died That we might live forever. And since thy great compassion Thus brings thy children near thee, May we to praise devote our days, And love as well as fear thee. And when death's final summons From earth's dear scenes shall move us,— From friends, from foes, from joys, from woes, From all that know and love us,— O, then, let hope attend us; Thy peace to us be given; That we may rise above the skies, And sing thy praise in heaven. ON LAYING THE CORNER STONE OF THE THEOLOGICAL COLLEGE IN CAMBRIDGE, July 6, 1825. Tune, Old Hundred. O Thou, in whom alone is found The strength by which our toil is blest, Upon this consecrated ground Now bid thy cloud of glory rest. In thy great name we place this stone; To thy great truth these walls we rear: Long may they make thy glory known, And long our Savior triumph here. And while thy sons, from earth apart, Here seek the truth from heaven that sprung, Fill with thy spirit every heart, With living fire touch every tongue. Lord, feed thy church with peace and love; Let sin and error pass away; Till truth's full influence from above Rejoice the earth with cloudless day. AT THE DEDICATION OF DIVINITY HALL. 1826. With praise and prayer our gift we bring, And consecrate to Power divine. Great God, accept the offering, And make it wholly, only thine. O that we may not look in vain To see thy glory here displayed! As when, within thine ancient fane, Thy royal servant knelt and prayed,— We kneel—we pray—with earnest voice; Our fervent supplications swell; Speak, Lord, and bid our souls rejoice To know that here thy grace shall dwell. O, let thy presence ne'er depart; Far hence be earth and error driven; Raise, warm, and sanctify each heart, And teach pure lips to plead for heaven. Here let the love of God engage The spirit's purest, first desires; While Truth unfolds her ample page, And Zeal enkindles all her fires. Thus honoring, and like their Lord, May gifted bands of teachers rise, To bear his glorious name abroad, And train immortals for the skies. THANKSGIVING SONG. November, 1841. I remember, I remember, when I was a little boy, How the last week in November always filled my heart with joy; For then Thanksgiving always came with every kind of pie, And I for once could eat my fill, though father did sit by. I remember, I remember, how on Monday they began With rolling paste, and chopping meat, and buttering patty-pan; And proud was I to pound the crackers, or to stone the plums, Or crack the shagbarks with flat-irons that often cracked my thumbs. I remember, I remember, how the two next busy days Kept the kitchen in an uproar, and the oven in a blaze; Till all was done and cleared away by Wednesday's evening skies, And the proud tea-table smoked with four premonitory pies. I remember, I remember, when the morning came at last, How joyfully at breakfast I perceived it was not Fast; But loaded plates and smoking bowls assailed our winking sight, With “Johnny cakes” and chocolate hot, to whet the appetite. I remember, I remember, when the dinner came at last, How, like the kings of Banquo's race, the dishes came and passed: The exhaustless line seemed threatening to run on till crack of doom, While still a voice from every stomach cried, “There yet is room.” I remember, I remember, how those lessons in gastronomy Were sometimes mixed with questions upon Latin and astronomy, And in geography how John did once, in accent murky, Reply that Canaan was in Ham, and Paradise in Turkey. I remember, I remember, then, how tight my jacket grew, As if 'twould burst a button off with every breath I drew; And so, to settle all, we boys kicked foot-ball down in town, Or went to see the marksmen try to shoot the tied hens down. I remember, I remember—not—what happened after tea, For we had then no grandfather whom we could go and see; I only know we went to bed when nine o'clock was rung, —And you had better do the same now that my song is sung. THE FEAST OF TABERNACLES. A POEM FOR MUSIC. In Two Parts. “Blest pair of sirens, pledges of heaven's joy, Sphere-born, harmonious sisters, Voice and Verse, Wed your divine sounds, and mixed powers employ With saintly shout and solemn jubilee.”...... Milton. To SAMUEL A. ELIOT, Esq. PRESIDENT OF THE BOSTON ACADEMY OF MUSIC, THIS ATTEMPT TO DO SOMETHING FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE IMPORTANT OBJECT, TO WHICH HE HAS SO SUCCESSFULLY DEVOTED HIMSELF, IS RESPECTFULLY INSCRIBED, BY HIS OBLIGED FRIEND, H. WARE, Jr. AUTHOR'S ADVERTISEMENT. The Feast of Tabernacles was one of the three great festivals of the Jewish people. In many respects it was the most remarkable of the three, being celebrated with a pomp of ceremony which is said to have attracted to it the attention of heathen nations, beyond any other solemnity of their law. It took place in the autumn, at the gathering in of the corn harvest and the vintage, and continued for seven days; during which time the people dwelt in booths, formed of branches of trees, to commemorate their ancestors' dwelling in tents in the wilderness. Each day had its appropriate solemnity; but the last was “the great day.” It was the day of annual Thanksgiving for the abundance of the earth, and was termed “the feast of in-gathering.” It was a season of great exhilaration and rejoicing. It was attended, as the preceding days had been, by the singular and striking ceremony of bringing water from the fountain of Siloam, and pouring it out at the altar with songs of hosanna and dances; and was closed by an illumination of the courts and porches of the Temple. See Leviticus xxiii. 34–43. Numbers xxix. 12–40. Deuteronomy xvi. 13–15. Exodus xxiii. 16; xxxiv. 22. Nehemiah viii. 13–18. An attempt has been made, in the following pages, to produce a representation of the imposing scenes in the Temple on this day, which might be adapted to musical recitation and accompaniment. The work was undertaken and written with that view. The author has aimed to be generally faithful to the facts, as far as they are known, and has taken no liberties with the subject, excepting that he has not scrupulously adhered to what may be called its costume. He has freely drawn from those passages of the Old Testament which refer to this festival, but has not sought to confine himself to modes of thought and speech exclusively Jewish. Music adapted to the work has been composed by Mr. Charles Zeuner, who has devoted to it his eminent genius and science, in a manner that cannot fail to gratify those who love the original and beautiful in his high art. Of this the public will soon have an opportunity to judge, as the piece is in preparation for public performance at the Odeon, by the choir of the Boston Academy of Music, and under the direction of the accomplished professors of that institution. It may be proper to remark, that the copy here given differs in many passages from that to be performed in the oratorio. It was convenient to the purposes of the composer to make variations and additions for the sake of the musical effect. As the author, however, presumes to hope that the poem may interest his friends, and find favor with some readers, independently of the music, he has desired to exhibit it in its original form, and for that reason has made this separate publication.

Watchman. The morning dawns. Its first faint beams betray Th' approaching sun, and bid the sleeping earth Awake. O'er Olivet The Mount of Olives was on the east side of the city, directly over against the Temple. Hebron lay to the south, at the distance of about twenty-five miles. One of the priests, here called a watchman for the sake of the scene, was appointed to watch for the first dawning of the day. On its approach he cried, “It is day.” “But is the heaven bright all up to Hebron?” was asked in reply.— See Lightfoot's “Temple Service.” the light streams up, Tinging the thin clouds with a thousand hues. It glances on the Temple's golden tiles And Zion's palace roofs. The mists of night Rise from the hills, like clouds of early incense, And heaven's sweet warblers tune their morning hymn. 'Tis time for man to wake, and join the praise. 'Tis light toward Hebron! The Mount of Olives was on the east side of the city, directly over against the Temple. Hebron lay to the south, at the distance of about twenty-five miles. One of the priests, here called a watchman for the sake of the scene, was appointed to watch for the first dawning of the day. On its approach he cried, “It is day.” “But is the heaven bright all up to Hebron?” was asked in reply.— See Lightfoot's “Temple Service.” Send the cry abroad, And call the servants of the altar forth. 'Tis light toward Hebron! Send the cry abroad. Watchmen, (one after another.) 'Tis light toward Hebron! Watchman. How beautiful the morning light Breaks on the city as it sleeps! Fair as His love, who, day and night, His watch o'er favored Israel keeps. Chorus of Watchmen. Wake, Zion, wake! and bless the Power That guards thee in the midnight hour. Wake, Israel, wake! and homage pay To Him whose love outshines the day. Watchman. See, from their sacred chambers issue forth The priests. In flowing robes arrayed, they come To wait around the altars, and renew The Temple's daily pomp. Jehovah clothe His servants with salvation! that his saints May fill these holy courts with shouts of joy. Psalm cxxxii. 16. “I will also clothe her priests with salvation; and her saints shall shout aloud for joy.” Priest. Seven days the people, in their countless tents,— Spread on the mountain-side and in the vale, Stretched on the joyous house-tops, street by street, And in Moriah's sacred courts,—have kept The holy season. Nehemiah viii. 16. “So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the street of the water gate, and in the street of the gate of Ephraim.” Solemn rite, by day, And lofty pomp and choral song, have filled The circling hours; by night, the cloistered halls, Bright with ten thousand lamps, have echoed back The shouts and anthems of th' assembled tribes. The final day has come, the day of chief And holiest concourse. Let the trumpet sound,— The consecrated trumpet,—to proclaim The last, the great day of the festival. Chorus of Priests and Watchmen. Welcome the dawning light! Welcome the joyous day! Let Jacob's tribes again unite To celebrate their ancient rite, And grateful homage pay. Wave the willow and the palm! Bow the knee, and chant the psalm! Throng the holy altar round! Bid the lofty courts resound! Priest. When, from Egyptian bondage driven, Our fathers sought their promised home, For many a year offended Heaven Condemned them in the wild to roam. No house received their weary forms, No city knew their way-worn feet; In tents they braved the winter's storms, In tents endured the summer's heat. And now, in Judah's prosperous days, Oft as the harvest month comes round, Our humble tents and booths we raise, And houseless, like our sires, are found. We bring to mind their sins and woes; Their path o'er Jordan's wave we trace, Till on these fruitful hills arose Their heritage and resting-place. Chorus. Praise for that fruitful heritage! Praise for that glorious resting-place! The home and pride, through every age, Of Zion's God and Israel's race. High Priest. Now let the morning sacrifice begin! Fire the rich censer! Let the incense rise In rolling clouds of fragrance, till it fill The Holy Place, and with the clouds of heaven Mingle its perfume. Bring the victims forth! Bid the high altar blaze! And while its fires Flash upward, brightening all the morning sky, Ye white-robed Levites, The music of the Temple was performed by a choir of Levites appointed for that purpose. In the reign of David, that monarch arranged this part of the service with great care, under the direction of three chiefs, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun. Their number at that time was two hundred and eighty-eight, and the accompanying instruments very various. The music began with the morning sacrifice, and continued during the whole time that the burnt-offering was consuming. 1 Chron. xv. 16–22; xxv. 1–7; 2 Chron. v. 11, 12; xxix. 25–28. at your sacred post Exalt his name for whom these honors rise. Strike all your strings! Breathe forth your loudest voice! Wake, timbrel, harp, and lute! wake, psaltery, pipe, And sackbut! cymbal, drum, and trumpet, wake! Let Zion hear, and Israel's utmost shore; Let farthest Gentile catch the sound, and know That Jacob's God is God of earth and heaven. Levites. Glory to God! Bid the glad tribes rejoice! Let earth and heaven reëcho to their voice! Down with the idols that usurp his throne! Exalt Jehovah, King and God alone! Sing, O ye heavens! ye unknown worlds, adore! Praise Him who was, and is, and shall be evermore! Voice from among the multitude, (as in soliloquy). How gloriously to heaven that odorous cloud Rolls from the altar, brightening in the sun! How like celestial harmony, that hymn, Chanted by holy voices, peals along Th' echoing porches! With the flame and song Send up thy heart, O Israel, and be blest. High Priest. Children of Abraham! to the altar throng, And add your voices to the Levite choir. Fresh from the vintage and the harvest field, Present your annual offering. Bow your souls, Adoring; while your wives and children The law required it only of the males to be present at the festivals; but there is no doubt that they were largely attended by women and children. It is enough to refer to the instances of Hannah, the mother of Samuel, and of Mary, the mother of Jesus. kneel, Uplifting heart and voice in holy joy. People. We hear, and we obey. From all the borders of the land, Assembled at the call we stand, And hail the festal day. Before the altar humbly bowed, We lift our thousand voices loud, And grateful homage pay. Let our anthem reach the skies! Let our thanks accepted rise! Voice. From Carmel's fruitful mountain, From Hebron's ancient towers, From Jordan's rushing fountain, From Sharon's vale of flowers,— People. We come, we come, the harvest o'er, To meet in Zion and adore. Voice. Lo! Ashur brings his treasures, Drawn from the heaving main; And Issachar his measures Of life-sustaining grain. People. The varied gifts of Heaven we bring, And pay our thanks to Israel's King. Voice. Lo! the vineyard's ripe donation! Lo! the honey from the rock! Lo! the olive's pure oblation! Lo! the fleeces of the flock! People. Blessing, honor, glory, be, Lord of life and love, to thee! Voice. Like a full, o'erflowing river, Blessings from on high descend; Glory to the bounteous Giver! Glory, till the world shall end! People. Let our anthem reach the skies! Let our thanks accepted rise! Woman. And hark, the sweet voices of Jacob's fair daughters There is reason to suppose that women, as well as men, were engaged in performing the musical portion of the daily worship. 1 Chron. xxv. 5, 6. Ezra ii. 65. Psalm lxviii. 25. Calmet gives additional reasons in confirmation. Join the high chorus of gladness and love; From the hill-sides of Judah, from Galilee's waters, They crowd to the courts of their Sovereign above. Chorus of Women. From our homes by the hill-side, our rest by the waters, We crowd to the courts of our Sovereign above; We bring the full hearts of wives, sisters, and daughters; We join the high chorus of gladness and love. All. Join, every voice, in the rapturous chorus; Swell the loud anthem of gladness and love; For the blessings of Heaven spread around us and o'er us, Shout to the praise of our Sovereign above. High Priest. Not unto us, O Lord, is glory due. Psalm cxv. This is one of the psalms appointed to be sung at this feast. We are but dust and sin. The gifts, the grace, The glory, all are thine. Be thine the praise! All other gods are idols; human hands Have made them, human folly serves. Our God, Jehovah, lives. Earth, heaven, all things, he made; He rules o'er all supreme. Praise him alone! People. Praise him alone! Beyond the splendors of the sun, He reigns eternal, glorious, one, On no divided throne. Round that throne what wonders meet! Clouds, the dust beneath his feet; Nahum i. 3. “The Lord hath his way in the whirlwind and the storm; and the clouds are the dust of his feet.” Thunder, but his voice; and fire, Angel of his love, or ire. Raise the universal song! Sound it, Zion, first and long! Hosts of heaven, angelic choirs, Strike it on your living lyres! Sea, and earth, and skies, unite, Sun, and moon, and stars of light! Praise him, praise, with one accord! Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! PART II. THE EVENING SACRIFICE. High Priest. Again lift up the voice! Wake, trump and harp! Repeat the chorus of your sounding praise! Let Asaph's tuneful choir the strain resume, And Israel, with his thousand voices, sing Praise to the Lord, whose mercy never fails! Choir of Asaph. Praise to the Lord, whose mercy never fails! Psalm cxviii. 2, 3, 4. “Let Israel now say, that his mercy endureth forever. Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy endureth forever. Let them now that fear the Lord say, that his mercy endureth forever.” High Priest. Let Aaron, with his sons, repeat the song. Choir of Priests and Levites. Praise to the Lord, whose mercy never fails! High Priest. Let all who fear the Lord repeat the song. People. Praise to the Lord, whose mercy never fails! All. Praise! hallelujah! praise! Adore his wondrous ways! Ye tribes, prolong the grateful song, And utter all his praise! Priest. Our fathers trusted in his name, And leaned upon his hand; He led them by his cloud and flame To this the promised land. All. Praise, hallelujah, praise! Priest. When, pressed by fears and foes, they dwelt In darkness and dismay, He made his powerful presence felt, And turned their night to day. All. Praise, hallelujah, praise! Priest. And when, in mad and stubborn pride, They rose against his word, His mercy turned their sins aside, His pitying grace restored. All. Praise, hallelujah, praise! Adore his wondrous ways! Ye tribes, prolong the grateful song, And utter all his praise! Power, grace, and majesty are his alone! Send up the anthem to his heavenly throne! High Priest. 'Tis done. The praise is said. Another rite “This pouring out of water was used every day of the feast; and their rejoicing upon it was so great, that in all this feast, nay, in all their feasts throughout all the year, they had not the like. One of the priests, with a golden tankard, went to the fountain or pool of Siloam, and filled it there with water. He returned back again into the court through that which was called the water gate, and when he came there the trumpets sounded. He goeth up the side of the altar, where stood two basins, one with wine in it, and into the other he put the water, and he pours either the wine into the water or the water into the wine, and then pours them out by way of libation.”— Lightfoot. Succeeds. Bring forth the sacred golden bowl; And let th' appointed priest convey it down To Siloa's hallowed fountain. Let him draw The sparkling waters: and with cautious step, In glad procession, bring them up the mount, And bear them to the altar of the Lord. Attend him, ye that will; and ye that will, Abide, till, with loud trump, and echoing shout, And waving palms, the absent throng return. Women. They go; they pass the gates; the sacred courts They leave; their distant tread dies on the ear. Wait not in silence for their slow return; But wake the echoes of the Holy Place With song, and warble forth the coming rite. Song, (Woman.) Flow on, flow on, thou bright, clear stream! Flow on, thou fair, perpetual fount! Transparent as the sun's warm beam, Bathe the stern foot of Judah's mount. The sun above, thy waves below, Unsullied shines, unsullied flow; Thou as the crystal heavens art pure, And like the heavens thou shalt endure. The Temple crowns Moriah's height, Thy waters murmur at its base; That seems Jehovah's throne of light, Thou his exhaustless fount of grace. And when the emblems we would join Of holy Love and Power divine, We draw thy waters from their bed, And pour them on the mountain's head. (Trumpet.) Priest. They come, they come; their signal notes resound; Their steps approach; their gladdening songs draw near. People, (returning.) Hosanna! hosanna! we bring the libation, The waters that flow from the fount of salvation. The people, during this ceremony, repeated Isaiah xii. 3: “With joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.” It is supposed to have been at this period in the solemnity, that our Lord, on the last day, the great day of the feast, stood and cried, saying, “If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink,” &amp;c. John vii. 37, 38. High Priest. Now let the sacred element be borne To the high altar's top; there, with the wine Already hallowed for the sacrifice, Let it be mingled. With a reverent hand With a reverent hand. It is said that, at the moment of pouring out the water, the people cried out to the priest, “Hold up your hand;” the reason of which was, that on a certain time there was one who poured it upon his feet; upon which the people pelted him with the pomecitrons which they carried in their hands during this festival, and in the disturbance a horn of the altar was broken. Then pour the mixture out; while, flinging high Their verdant palms, with solemn shout and song, The people dance around their glorious shrine. People. Hosanna! hosanna! pour out the libation! Glory and beauty, O altar, to thee! “Beauty be to thee, O altar! beauty be to thee, O altar!” was the exclamation of the people, as they retired through the gates nearest to the altar. With gladness we draw from the wells of salvation Waters of life, ever flowing and free. Joy to thee, joy to thee, life-giving river! Glory and beauty, O altar, to thee! The streams of salvation roll onward forever,— Life to the universe, boundless and free. High Priest. Now tell your children what this rite intends; What mean these glowing forms, these words of joy. Priest. The prophet gave the blow; Exodus xvii. 6. It is said, by some, that the unusual rejoicings which attended this festival were connected with the expectation of the Messiah's coming. “The Jews acknowledge,” says Lightfoot, “that their latter Redeemer is to procure water for them, as their former redeemer, Moses, had done.” Beausobre says, “The days of the Messiah were styled by the Jews the Feast of Tabernacles.” Forth gushed the cool, refreshing wave, The parched and perishing to save, Far as its waters flow. Recalled to life, the dying band Pressed eager to the destined land. So, in some latter day, When Israel lies in woe and fear, Her great Anointed shall appear, To chase her dark dismay. From Him a holier stream shall flow, To save the world from darker woe. O, haste the glorious hour! Haste, David's Son, illustrious King! Come to thy waiting saints, and bring Thy glory, peace, and power. Hosanna! let the people cry; Hosanna! earth and heaven reply. High Priest. The day declines. The slow-descending sun Casts lengthening shadows o'er the darkened vales. Light up the temple! Through the pillared walks Hang out the lamps, “Dancing, music, and feasting were the accompaniments of this festival, together with such brilliant illuminations as lighted the whole city of Jerusalem.”—Horne.—It was a proverb among the Jews, “He that never saw the rejoicing of the pouring out of water, never saw rejoicing in his life.” It has not seemed necessary, however, to adhere strictly to the accounts we have received of the manner in which the festival was closed. Those who would make the comparison may be pleased to see the following passage from Lightfoot, the latter portion of which is translated from a rabbinical author. “Towards night, they began the rejoicing for the pouring out or drawing of the water, which mirth they continued far in the night, every night of the feast. . . . . . “The manner was thus:— “They went into the court of the women, and there the women placed themselves upon balconies round about the court, and the men stood upon the ground. There were four candlesticks (or beacons, rather, I might call them) of an exceeding great bigness, and mounted on an exceeding great height, overtopping and overlooking the walls of the court and of the mountain of the house, at a great elevation; by every candlestick were four ladders set, by which four of the younger priests went up, having bottles in their hands, that contained a hundred and twenty logs, which they emptied into every cup. Of the rags of the garments and girdles of the priests they made wicks to light those lamps; and there was not a street throughout all Jerusalem that did not shine with that light. “The religious and devout danced before them, having lighted torches in their hands, and sang songs and doxologies. The Levites, with harps, psalteries, cymbals, and other instruments of music without number, and stood upon those fifteen steps, by which they went down from the court of the women, according to the fifteen psalms of degrees, and sang. Two priests also stood in the upper gate, which goes down from the Court of Israel to the Court of the Women, with two trumpets in their hands. [Hebrew] When the cock crew, [or the president gave his signal,] the trumpets sounded; when they came to the tenth step, they sounded again; when they came to the court, they sounded; when they came to the pavement, they sounded; and so went on sounding the trumpets, till they came to the east gate of the court. When they came thither, they turned their faces from the east to west, and said, Our fathers in this place, turning their backs upon the Temple, and their faces toward the east, worshipped the sun; but we turn our faces to God,” &amp;c. “The rabbins have a tradition. Some of them, while they were dancing, said, Blessed be our youth, for that they have not made our old men ashamed. [Hebrew] These were the religious, and men of good works. And some said, Blessed be our old men, that have made atonement for our youth. And both one and the other said, Blessed be he who hath not sinned; and he who hath, let it be forgiven him.”— Lightfoot's Works, IX. 105; XII. 300. and from the crowded courts Keep off the gathering night. Then, while the blaze Is flashing from the altars, gates, and roofs, Till evening shines with more than noonday fires, Let one loud choral anthem close the day. People. Jehovah dwells in light! Bright on his glorious courts below Ten thousand lamps their splendor throw; To build his throne of heavenly light, Ten thousand suns their flames unite. There dwells the pure, immortal ray! Serene, resplendent, infinite, alone, It robes the essence of the Holy One In everlasting day. From this dim, shadowy sphere, We seek that central day on high. Hail, holy Light, all hail! we cry; Send down the full effulgence here, Till earth's long darkness disappear. Author of light and being, hail! The soul, the stars, the universe are thine; Bid light o'er all, thy light immortal, shine, Till truth and love prevail. High Priest. The anthem ends; the festival is o'er. To-morrow sees you scattered on your way, Hastening o'er hills and valleys to your homes. Israel, depart in peace! Jehovah send His angel by your side! Nor sun by day, Psalm cxxi. 5–8. “The Lord is thy keeper; the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand. The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night. The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil; he shall preserve thy soul. The Lord shall preserve thy going out, and thy coming in, from this time forth, and even forevermore.” Nor moon by night, nor pestilence, nor foe, Annoy your march, and peace await you home! Now humbly let your inmost souls receive The solemn benediction of the Law. Numbers vi. 23–26. “Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel, saying unto them, The Lord bless thee, and keep thee. The Lord make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee. The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.” Jehovah bless and keep you! bless and keep! People. Amen! High Priest. Jehovah cause his face to beam in love Upon you, and his favor be your life! People. Amen! Amen! High Priest. Jehovah lift his countenance of light Upon you, and shed down his boundless peace! People. Amen! Amen! Amen! STANZAS, ADDITIONAL TO MRS. HEMANS'S “BIRD'S RELEASE.” February, 1827. And thou art happier now In the free, wide fields of the boundless air, With thy wing on the wind, and thy thought without care, And thy home on the forest bough. Even so with the lost and dear; She is soaring in regions of light above; She's at home with the blessed in their bowers of love; And who would recall her here? LINES TO W. R. G. BATES. William Rufus Gray Bates, son of Joshua Bates, Esq., of the house of Baring, Brothers, &amp; Co., London, was born in Boston, July 2, 1815. When three years old, he accompanied his mother to France, where his father was then residing. This poem was written on the occasion of his embarking. Lo! how impatiently upon the tide The proud ship tosses, eager to be free! Her flag streams wildly, and her fluttering sails Pant to be on their flight. A few hours more, And she will move in stately grandeur on, Cleaving her path majestic through the flood, As if she were a goddess of the deep. O, 'tis a thought sublime, that man can force A path upon the waste, can find a way Where all is trackless, and compel the winds— Those freest agents of almighty power— To lend their untamed wings, and bear him on To distant climes.—Thou, William, still art young, And dost not see the wonder. Thou wilt tread The buoyant deck, and look upon the flood, Unconscious of the high sublimity, As 'twere a common thing—thy soul unawed, Thy childish sports unchecked; while thinking man Shrinks back into himself,—himself so mean 'Mid things so vast,—and, rapt in deepest awe, Bends to the might of that mysterious Power, Who holds the waters in his hand, and guides Th' ungovernable winds. 'Tis not in man To look unmoved upon that heaving waste, Which, from horizon to horizon spread, Meets the o'erarching heavens on every side, Blending their hues in distant faintness there. 'Tis wonderful!—and yet, my boy, just such Is life. Life is a sea as fathomless, As wide, as terrible, and yet sometimes As calm and beautiful. The light of heaven Smiles on it, and 'tis decked with every hue Of glory and of joy. Anon dark clouds Arise, contending winds of fate go forth, And Hope sits weeping o'er a general wreck. And thou must sail upon this sea, a long, Eventful voyage. The wise may suffer wreck, The foolish must. O, then, be early wise; Learn from the mariner his skilful art To ride upon the waves, and catch the breeze, And dare the threatening storm, and trace a path, 'Mid countless dangers, to the destined port, Unerringly secure. O, learn from him To station quick-eyed Prudence at the helm, To guard thyself from Passion's sudden blasts, And make Religion thy magnetic guide, Which, though it trembles as it lowly lies, Points to the light that changes not, in heaven. Farewell! Heaven smile propitious on thy course, And favoring breezes waft thee to the arms Of love paternal. Yes, and more than this— Blest be thy passage o'er the changing sea Of life; the clouds be few that intercept The light of joy; the waves roll gently on Beneath thy bark of hope, and bear thee safe To meet in peace thine other Father—God. The young person to whom these lines were addressed was accidentally killed by the discharge of his fowling-piece, at Elton, in the county of Huntingdon, (England,) in 1834, at the age of nineteen years. His improvement and virtues had secured the love and esteem of his friends, and filled the hearts of his parents with fond hopes of his future success and honor. TO MARY. Salisbury and Vergennes, September 4 and 5, 1828. Dear Mary, 'tis the fourteenth day Since I was parted from your side; And still upon my lengthening way In solitude I ride; But not a word has come to tell If those I left at home are well. I am not of an anxious mind, Nor prone to cherish useless fear; Yet oft, methinks, the very wind Is whispering in my ear, That many an evil may take place Within a fortnight's narrow space. 'Tis true, indeed, disease and pain May all this while have been your lot; And when I reach my home again, Death may have marked the spot. I need but dwell on thoughts like these, To be as wretched as I please. But no,—a happier thought is mine; The absent like the present scene Is guided by a Friend divine, Who bids us wait serene The issues of that gracious will Which mingles good with every ill. And who should feel this tranquil trust In that benignant One above,— Who ne'er forgets that we are dust, And rules with pitying love,— Like us, who both have just been led Back from the confines of the dead?— Like us, who, 'mid the various hours That mark life's changeful wilderness, Have always found its suns and showers Alike designed to bless? Led on and taught as we have been, Distrust would be indeed a sin. Darkness, 'tis true, and death, must come; But they should bring us no dismay; They are but guides to lead us home, And then to pass away. O, who will keep a troubled mind, That knows this glory is designed? Then, dearest, present or apart, An equal calmness let us wear; Let steadfast Faith control the heart, And still its throbs of care. We may not lean on things of dust; But Heaven is worthy all our trust. SONG. 1815. O, say not that love is the light of an hour, Which fades when youth's wildness is o'er; It glows with its purest and liveliest power When beauty and mirth are no more. I covet the love that will waken and stay, Like the progress of light from the dawn, Which opens in blushes, and spreads into day More bright as the minutes move on. The face I could love must reflect the fair beam Of a soul that is lighted from heaven; Its smile, like the sunshine that glows on a stream, Forever unruffled and even. Then sorrow might come, but it would not be dark; That love on the shadows would shine; And the near hope of heaven, with its rapturous spark, Would lighten and warm our decline. FOR THE ORDINATION OF MR. SPARKS. 1819. Tune, Old Hundred. Great God, the followers of thy Son, We bow before thy mercy-seat, To worship thee, the holy One, And pour our wishes at thy feet. O, grant thy blessing here to-day! O, give thy people joy and peace! The tokens of thy love display, And favor that shall never cease. We seek the truth that Jesus brought; His path of light we long to tread; Here be his holy doctrines taught, And here their purest influence shed. May faith, and hope, and love abound; Our sins and errors be forgiven; And we, in thy great day, be found Children of God and heirs of heaven! LINES Written March 29, 1836. It is not what my hands have done, That weighs my spirit down, That casts a shadow o'er the sun, And over earth a frown; It is not any heinous guilt, Or vice by men abhorred; For fair the fame that I have built, A fair life's just reward; And men would wonder if they knew How sad I feel with sins so few. Alas! they only see in part, When thus they judge the whole; They cannot look upon the heart, They cannot read the soul; But I survey myself within, And mournfully I feel How deep the principle of sin Its root may there conceal, And spread its poison through the frame Without a deed that men can blame. They judge by actions which they see Brought out before the sun; But conscience brings reproach to me For what I've left undone,— For opportunities of good In folly thrown away, For hours misspent in solitude, Forgetfulness to pray,— And thousand more omitted things, Whose memory fills my breast with stings. And therefore is my heart oppressed With thoughtfulness and gloom; Nor can I hope for perfect rest, Till I escape this doom. Help me, thou Merciful and Just, This fearful doom to fly; Thou art my strength, my hope, my trust;— O, help me, lest I die! And let my full obedience prove The perfect power of faith and love. TWO SONNETS OF TASK-WORK. I. Hail our approach to venerable Rome We arrived at Bolsena, between Florence and Rome, on a cool evening, December 11, 1829; and to help cheer the dismal hours in a huge, comfortless apartment, it was proposed to have a sonnet on our approach to the Eternal City. I called on the company for rhymes, à la mode improvisatrice; and having obtained them, I wrote the following:— Hail our approach to venerable Rome! We go to kneel and wonder at her shrine, To watch where still her parting glories shine, And bear the memory of her greatness home. There the late marvel of her sacred Dome Doth with her hoary monuments combine, Like ruined elm o'ertop'd by towering vine, To stir the souls of those that thither roam. There, 'mid her crumbling relics, we will stray To tread her Forum in the noonday bright; Her Colosseum under midnight skies, And there, in grief, with silent gaze survey, The world's chief glory fading from its height, Till in the dust it sinks, and all ignobly dies. II. Hark to the summons of departing Time This was written at St. Agata, on the way to Naples, in the same manner, December 31, 1829. Hark to the summons of departing Time! Its echoes die upon the fading year; Build up its requiem in some solemn rhyme, And bring the final end of all things near. The tide of being, rushing from afar, Bears on the fortunes of the deathless soul; Bright o'er its waters beams a holy star, And heaven's blest island crowns the glorious whole. Review the past of this all-varying scene; Recount with gratitude its every joy; How few the days unclouded and serene! How mixed the happiest moments with alloy! Yet from this mingled mass the soul may reap The harvest gathered after death's long sleep. A SUNDAY MORNING ECLOGUE. WRITTEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE DEATH OF REV. GEORGE WHITNEY, OF JAMAICA PLAIN, ROXBURY, AND REV. DR. HARRIS, OF DORCHESTER. Scene.—A rustic Cottage on a Hill-side; a Lake beneath; a Village in the distance beyond.—A Child is sitting on the bank near the cottage door, at which his Father appears. Child. Is it not time, dear father, for the bell? I'm weary listening for it. Here I've sat Since breakfast, waiting, waiting; but I hear No sound. I'm tired of waiting! Father. How the child Delights to catch the music of that bell! And so do I, in truth. I love its peal, As it comes swelling o'er the placid lake, And stirs the silence of our far hill-side. The undulating tones float calmly on, As if from heaven's broad depths they wafted down Sweet messages of peace, such as befit A Sunday's sacred calm.—Come hither, boy; Sit on the door-stone by your father's side, And I will listen with you for the bell. Child. How beautiful it is! Father. What's beautiful? Child. Why, every thing;—the trees, and flowers, and clouds, And pond, and houses;—all are beautiful. What makes them always look most beautiful On Sunday morning? Father. Do they so? Child. Why, yes; And mother says so too; and then she asks, If heaven will be more fair than this bright earth. Father. Well, child, and will it? Child. O, I asked her that; She answered, “Surely yes;” and said the hymn, “If God hath made this world so fair, Where sin and death abound, How beautiful, beyond compare, Must Paradise be found!” But why on Sunday should it seem most fair? Father. Because the mind is then in tune; its thoughts Of holy truth have roused it to perceive The harmony of all with things divine: The heart, attuned to heavenly melody, Beats in accord with nature's melodies, Which always are of Heaven. You understand? Child. O, yes; for mother always says, you know, If I am sweet and pleasant, every thing Will pleasant be to me and sweet; and so All things will be most heavenly to the eye Beneath a Sabbath sun, because ourselves Are then most heavenly. Father. Ay, but might we not Find all as full of heaven another day? Child. Surely,—as all would pleasant be to me If I were always in a pleasant mood. Father. But children fret, and then all joys are soured; And men disturb their minds with foolish cares, Till nature's peace and God's great presence fade; Till noxious mists have darkened all their world, And rarely yield a moment's glimpse of heaven. Bless me, this day, my God, with one such glimpse! Lift off the darkness from my soul! Remove The dimness of my eye, that I may see, The dulness of my ear, that I may hear, The melodies and beauties of thy realms. Child. Hark! hark! Methought I heard it.—Have they bells In heaven, father? Father. They have music, dear, And worship—love and angels.—Hark!—'Tis strange! 'Tis very strange! The shadows have grown short, The sun rides high, and yet no call to church! The air is still—we could not fail to hear. But what should cause that iron tongue to lie Speechless to-day, which for two hundred years Ne'er failed before to ring its summons forth, Proclaiming, to the forests and the hills, That toil had pause, and earth was bowed in praise? What can it mean? Child. List, father! Up the steep, Straight from the village, comes the sound of wheels. Father. And now I see the wagon, as it winds Round yonder turn. I will approach and know The reason of this mystery.—Neighbor, hail! A Sabbath's salutation to you, friend! But why this more than Sabbath's silence? Why No customary bell? Neighbor. Have you not heard? Father. I have heard nothing. Neighbor. Not the heavy news That fills the vale with sadness, and makes dim The eyes of all its dwellers? Father. Not a word. Neighbor. Then hear and weep with them. Our pastor's dead! Father. Dead? Dead? Impossible; so young, so strong— Impossible! I saw him three days since. Neighbor. A sudden illness, with its stern assault, Leaped on his sturdy frame, and bore him down. But yesterday he sat as he was wont, Scarce conscious of an ill beyond the dull And languid apathy which often keeps The student from his books. This morning's sun Beheld his spirit mounting from its clay, And stricken children weeping o'er his corse, Appalled and comfortless. Father. God comfort them, And us, and all! What mystery is this, That puts this fearful pause to so much life And useful cares, so needed and so loved,— While withered forms, that scarce can drag their limbs, And spent their stores of blessings long ago, Still bear the burden of infirmest age, Helpless and hopeless! Who can note unawed God's deep-sealed secret? Why was he not left To run his tranquil course of seventy years, And then, all duty done, reposing wait,— As in the twilight of a summer's day The rustic lingers at his cottage door,— And to the pressure of Time's heavy hand Yield gently, sinking to the grave as men Withdrawing to their chambers seek their rest, In Sleep's protecting bosom? Neighbor. So, last night, In ripe old age, and ever gentle faith, That old man passed away; life's twilight calm Still beautiful around him; no more toil For him on earth, and every hope in heaven. Father. What old man speak you of, whose sun has set In timely beauty thus, while yonder orb Is stricken headlong from its noonday height? Neighbor. You know old Father Simon; long withdrawn From charge of holy things, but loving still The hallowed office which so long he held, An humble priest. A messenger was sent To tell the venerable man that death Had robbed our altar of its youthful priest, And lead the elder to the vacant rite. Guess what a thrill of consternation struck The village heart when he, returning, told That Father Simon, too, had died last night! Therefore it is that every sound is mute; the church Is closed; the scattered flock, that should have thronged The house of prayer, amazed, and pale, retreat, And mournful silence broods o'er all the scene. I, too, would fain retire. I have no heart For human intercourse to-day. Farewell! Father. Farewell!—His work was done. From early morn, Through all the heat and burden of the noon, Unresting,—always at the task he loved,— He labored on, till round him gathering eve Began to cast its shades. The wearied man Now sat him down to rest; about him cast A placid look on his accomplished task, And smiled that all was done. What had he more To live for? Pleasures, hopes, and useful toils, For him there none remained, except in heaven. There they awaited him; and there his trust Serenely fixed, the gentle summons came, And called him home—“Go to thy rest, old man! Peace waits thee in the Father's house, on earth Unknown. Go, we have known and loved thee long; We can but weep to miss thee; but our tears Are tears of hope as well as fond regret— Of joy yet more than grief; of sympathy With thy rejoicing in thy new-found bliss.” But other feelings wake at W??????'s death. Gone, in his prime—not two score years yet told— The vigor of brave manhood in his limbs; And youth's frank hopefulness upon his brow;— As suddenly as if from this green bank, Just where I sit and gaze upon the flowers That lift their smiling beauty 'mong the grass, And deck the verdant hills with countless hues, Now, as I look, some hidden fount of fire Should spout, like Etna's flaming torrent, forth, And in an instant desolate the scene. Gone, in his prime! In him how many homes Their light have lost! how many poor their stay! The young a counsellor—the old a staff— The flock of Christ a shepherd kind and true. Yes, we have lost a friend; but heaven has gained One more inhabitant; and Sabbath choirs to-day, With loud rejoicing, shout him welcome home. A WINTER SCENE. AN EXTRACT FROM A FAMILIAR EPISTLE. January 13, 1829. O, would you could see, since the last week's rain, What splendor adorns our grove and plain! For it froze as it fell, and the drizzling sleet Cast thick o'er the earth an icy sheet; The crusted trees in their glory appear, Each like a crystal chandelier, On whose brilliant jewels the sunbeams glance, As their limbs in the light breeze twinkle and dance; And every twig and spire of grass Is a splendid prism of solid glass, Sparkling and flashing in day's broad glare, With all the hues of the rainbow there. O, 'tis a gorgeous sight to behold The fields all strewed with rubies and gold, And emeralds, bright with their rich green rays, And diamonds, that fiercely burn and blaze, And sapphires and pearls profusely strown, Till a more magnificent view is shown, Than the garden of gems in the Eastern tale Which Aladdin found in the secret vale. THE WATERFALL AT CATSKILL. WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM IN THE HOTEL, July 2, 1826. Bold, bold, and beautiful, the headlong wave Leaps from the dizzy height—in floods of foam Broken and glittering—flinging up its clouds Of playful mist, that meet the wanton sun, And take all hues, and deck the shattered stream In floating rainbows, that, like fairy forms Before the dreamer's eye, flit here and there, Now bright, now faded. Thus it plunges on, Roaring and restless, till the gulf profound Spreads wide its peaceful bosom, and the vexed, Impetuous torrent slumbers in the shade. Such be my quiet, when life's troubled tide Shall reach the vale serene of tranquil age! So it has been for ages—so shall be For ages yet to come. Years roll on years, And find that sound and motion still unchanged. Things that have life decay; but thou, fair rill,— So like a living thing, that yet art none,— Thou changest not. The forests round thee die; The beasts that roam them perish in their shade; The solid rock, thy bed, is worn away; Empires are moved. And man, the prince of all, Lives but to die. And thou dost see this change Pass upon all, and in perpetual youth Dost sing and frolic 'mid a world of graves. HYMN TO THE GOD OF BATTLES. FROM AN UNFINISHED POEM ON THE BATTLE OF LEXINGTON. God of our fathers! who didst bear Their pilgrim footsteps o'er the wave, O, listen to their offspring's prayer! Rise, as for Israel, rise and save! God of our children! spare for them The heritage our fathers gained; Let Freedom's glorious diadem And Truth's pure light abide unstained. Great God of battles! to the field Lead forth our armed and conquering host; Be thou their strength, their guide, their shield, And drive th' invader from our coast. Hear, Lord! Without thy aid we die: Hear us! To thee our cause we trust: O, hear! and, from thy throne on high, Rescue the offspring of the just. ANTI-SLAVERY SONG. March 15, 1843. Oppression shall not always reign: There comes a brighter day, When Freedom, bursting every chain, Shall have triumphant way. Then Right shall over Might prevail; And Truth, like hero armed in mail, The hosts of tyrant wrong assail, And hold eternal sway. E'en now that glorious day draws near; Its coming is not far; In heaven and earth its signs appear; We see its morning star; Its dawn has flushed the eastern sky; The western hills reflect it high; The southern clouds before it fly.— Hurra! Hurra! Hurra! It flashes on the Indian isles.—Hurra! It gilds their plains with gladdening smiles.—Hurra! Eight hundred thousand, newly free, Pour out their songs of jubilee, That shake the globe from sea to sea.— Hurra! Hurra! Hurra! That shout which every bosom thrills—Hurra! In thunder rings from all our hills.—Hurra! The waves reply on every shore, Old Faneuil echoes to the roar, And rocks as ne'er it rocked before— Hurra! Hurra! Hurra! What arm shall check its onward way?—Hurra! What voice arrest the growing day?—Hurra! What dastard soul, though stout and strong, Shall dare bring back the ancient wrong, Or Slavery's night of guilt prolong?— Hurra! Hurra! Hurra! Then shout, ye lovers of your race!—Hurra! The glorious hour comes on apace!—Hurra! Ring, Liberty, thy glorious bell! Thy flag unfurl, thy trumpet swell! From land to land the triumph tell!— Hurra! Hurra! Hurra! The day has come, the hour draws nigh!—Hurra! Send forth the tidings far and high!—Hurra! From every hill, by every sea, In shouts proclaim the great decree,— “All chains are broke! all men are free!”— Hurra! Hurra! Hurra! Then shout! The hour comes on apace!—Hurra! The hour of glory for the race!—Hurra! Ring, Liberty, thy glorious bell, Bid high thy sacred banner swell, And trump on trump the triumph tell.— Hurra! Hurra! Hurra! MOUNT WASHINGTON. This piece and the two following are extracts from Poetical Notes of a Pedestrian Tour. Franconia, August 8, 1835. Up! The worst Is past; the bold rock stands unveiled; and now One effort more. 'Tis done. Breathless and pale, We stand upon the peak above the clouds. Vast and immeasurable! How the eye Searches the great expanse for rest in vain! Magnificent obscurity! sublime! Dim! fathomless! Above, is only heaven Spread forth o'er all, in deep, pure, lustrous light! Below, earth—only earth—yet so displayed As fills the gazing soul with trembling awe. O, what a place for thought! Give me my cloak, And leave me here alone. I'll wrap it round To keep me from the keen, imperious wind, And hold a moment's musing by myself. And not a human foot within the land It planted high as mine! Great heaven except, On all else I look down. That glorious dome, Unchanged, appears—in beauty, grandeur, pomp, As unapproached, as unapproachable, As when I upward gazed from common earth. I have ascended, yet have not drawn near; But things of earth, how changed! Man and his works Are scarce discerned. Yon hills, whose vastness seemed Immeasurable, lie, beneath my look, Dwindled to vulgar eminences. Lo! How they onward roll, like waves at sea, Less and still less, till in the horizon far They mingle with the clouds and disappear. And yonder speck is ocean! infinite, sublime, Resistless ocean! pride and dread of man! Now but a glittering thread of twinkling light, Like a faint lamp reflected from the pool, So dim, so faint, we doubt if it be there. What, then, am I—when all earth's mightiness Thus disappears? Instruct me, awful Teacher, While from this stand of truth I measure earth And heaven! instruct me of myself. O, teach, Teach me to feel that by approach toward Heaven All things are seen in their own magnitude. “God seems more grand—man crumbles into dust.” The pomp of wealth and power, the state, the luxury, The strife which mad ambition seeks, and earth Is torn with hot convulsions to attain, Here show for what they are—hollow and vain— Even as those clouds, that, floating in mid air, Send out a glory to the eye below, But drop their shroud upon the summit rock, And hide with empty vapor earth and heaven. Yet in these clouds as truly God resides, As in the dark pavilion which arrayed Old Sinai's top—as truly gives a law To his attendant servant. Lend thine ear, And hear it—ope thine heart, and honor it— Bend reverently to its message all thy soul; And let the lesson thou has gathered here, In solitary thought and intercourse With truth and nature, cause thy unveiled soul, Like Moses' face, to glow with obvious light— Be a commandment to thy devious step, And keep thee on thy high, immortal march.— The body climbs toward heaven in vain—the soul, If it will climb, may reach and enter in. THE WILLEY HOUSE. Here pause upon this ruin. What a tale Of grandeur and of woe is written here! He, whom we think not of, because his power Leads all things gently with the cords of love, Doth sometimes teach us with a startling blow, That wakes our senses to his majesty. He touched the trembling mountain and it fell,— Fell, with its burden of rent rocks and trees Of giant growth, a fearful avalanche,— Fell, amid storm and tempest, while the clouds Dropped down in floods, and angry lightnings flashed, And thunders echoing rolled. It seemed as God Descended in his terrors, as of old On Sinai, wrapped in darkness, clouds, and storm. The mountain felt him near, And trembled from its base; the swelling streams, Each with its own commission, carried forth The message of destruction, bidding man Tremble, adore, and think upon his God. Behold this house. Thus near the horror came, A few short feet, and stayed, and left it safe. O, had its panic-stricken tenants staid, They had been safe; but in their fear they fled,— Fled from their shelter to the very death They feared. The morning saw them in their tranquil home, A family of love; the mother smiled Upon her five young mountaineers, and joyed To aid them in their sports, and lead them on To better things than sport. The drizzly rains Confined the father, too, within; and much They talked, perchance, and marvelled at the storm, That, seemingly exhausted, still poured on Floods inexhaustible, and gathering Blackness and fury tenfold, as the day Passed on. Yet what felt they of fear, or why? Were they not sheltered in a quiet home? And what but pleasure, from their nook secure, To look abroad on this sublime display Of nature's glorious and unusual pomp? So came the eve, and with the eve came fear. The tumult thickens, fiercer winds arise, More copious torrents fall, the mountain groans, Signs of unwonted dread are heard abroad. But what do they portend?—the danger, what? The safety, where? in quiet or in flight? O, horrible suspense! and, at some sound Of ominous import, forth at once Wife, husband, children, in distraction rush. Again the sound terrific, like the crash Of earth's last wreck, burst on their frightened ear, And the descending ruin bears them down. They sleep in peace; and, humble as they were, Few of earth's honored sons have monument Magnificent as this. To form it, this perpetual hill did bow, These hoary rocks forsook their ancient base, And here, while time shall last, the funeral pile Shall tell where they repose. The crowds that come To worship at this mountain, countless tribes, With numbers yearly growing, shall be found Seeking their sepulchre, to learn their names, To hear the story of their fate, and speak One word of pity at the awful tale. Sleep, then, in peace; unwonted death was yours; Yours an unwonted monument; and yours Funereal pomp that kings have never known. Here, in the embosomed depth Of these your native mountains, sleep in peace, Till the last tempest rend the mount again, And call you from its bosom into light. RED HILL. Then reverently we bared our heads, and stood; And from that holy bard, whose sightless eye Beheld the wonders of the Invisible, We raised the hymn so worthy Paradise, In its pure early worship. With the words I trust our hearts rose up; the morning wind Bore them, like incense, upward, and there seemed A soul of deep devotion breathed abroad On all the things we saw: they heard the call, The eloquent call, of Milton and of God, And uttered praise. The sun and clouds in heaven Heard, as they rose above us, and replied; The lake responded with her thousand isles; The mountains, that encompassed us around, Near and more distant, seemed to bow assent; The birds joined harmony; the lowing kine, The waving trees, the lowly herb beneath Our feet, with burden of rich fruit, and last The scattered hamlets, whose ascending smokes Showed human life awaking to the day,— All seemed to hear and join the act of praise. So to our hearts it seemed, so full, so warm. So loud, the burst of holy praise rung forth In words that reach and rouse the inmost soul Of nature, as of man,—the general soul That fills and vivifies whate'er exists. 'Tis well to worship where the pomp of man Intrudes not. So infirm are we, so bound In chains of sense, that crowded chapels, throngs Of dressed adorers, bursts of choral song, The formal, eloquent routine of praise, Sometimes excite, sometimes distract, confound, Or dissipate the soul. 'Tis well to know that piety Draws its best nutriment from solitude, Withdrawn from man, in secret intercourse With man's Creator; on the mountain-top, Beside the waterfall, within the dark And silent forest, on the midnight bed, Within the chambers of the secret mind, Where no eye pierces, no ear listens, save That of the indwelling spirit, which pervades, And moves, and blesses all. Then worship grows A holy, heavenly thing; th' unfettered soul, Emancipate from earth, no more disturbed With others' thoughts, nor bound to tread The path by others signified, springs free, Exalted, spiritualized, and carries back To earth and life a fragrance and a strength That earth gives not, and that prepares for heaven. Such Sabbath is not lost; and, from the mount When we descended, with the little flock That gathers in an humble, upper room, Like that, perchance, wherein Paul preached, we, too, Were found. A touching sight, thus far from home, Amid the wild hills, to behold a few, Summoned at call of Him who rules the earth As King, and numbers millions for his own, In every age and nation, bending down In prayer, and listening to the word of life;— A fragment of the universal church; Pondering upon the thoughts which make the joy Of spirits in heaven, and urged to find, like them, Their happiness in glorifying God. How truly came from Heaven a messenger Like this,—how surely leads to Heaven. MY DREAM OF LIFE. HIS BIRTHPLACE. There is the spot! My memory has a spell Which clothes it with ten thousand charms, unseen By other eyes, by other hearts unfelt. The low, white house, whose far-retreating roof Turned two front stories into one behind; The green-capped picket-fence; the gay front yard, Skirted with rose and lilach; here the plat Of grass, divided by the gravelled walk, And shaded by the spreading apple-tree; There, the neat garden, more for use than show, Bordered with box, with gaudy holly-hocks gay, And crowded with th' unsightly forms of things The palate loves, the tasteful eye disdains. Beyond, the orchard flung its fruitful arms, And stretched its thirsty roots along the bank Of that fair pond, which lies 'mid gentle slopes And fertile meadows, like a lovely babe Upon its mother's bosom,—now at rest In tranquil beauty; now all smiles and charms, Now, in capricious passion, wild and fierce. Lake of my youth! I love thy flowery shores— Thy buoyant waters more—for they have tossed My wayward skiff through many a playful hour, When dancing ripples sparkled to the sun— And murmured round my moonlight bark, that seemed A floating paradise of youth and love— And lent their marble surface to my flight, When my steeled foot would emulate the winds, Or when, descending from the headlong steep, Breathless I dashed through drifting snow, that flew Like dust about my path, and furious plunged Across the solid flood. O, those were days Whose memory warms the blood, and makes instinct With life and soul the whole surrounding scene. Nought meets the eye but wakens in my heart Old thoughts that make it throb. The very earth Possesses conscious life, and every tree Tells its own tale, and asks a smile or tear. There stands the ancient elm, whose giant growth My boyish eyes admired, and on whose boughs, Adventurous, I would rock myself, and swing Above the carriage path, and shout to catch Th' applauding eye of passengers below. It shadows with its venerable arms The simple dwelling where I had my birth. How dear is every room beneath that roof! There we assembled at the cheerful meal, And asked Heaven's blessing on a band of love. There the gay circle, on a winter's eve, Gathered about the lavish blaze, and pressed Within the chimney's ample range, to catch The tales of wonder childhood loves to hear, And age delights to tell. There stood my bed; There I lay waiting for a mother's kiss, And soft good night; then, breathless, sought to catch Her last faint footstep as she slow retired; Then drew the blanket o'er my face, and slept. Time, in its lengthened flight, has wrought such change, That hardly could I recognize those walls; But that sweet evening kiss, I feel it now; I hear that soft good-night, that parting step Still faintly fall upon my waiting ear. The past comes thick around me—faded shapes, But beautiful, of all that once have been, And are no more. I sit beside the hearth, And weep at scenes that once were only joy. O, what is tender like a mother's love? And what can pay its loss? To her I looked To cheer and guide me in the fearful way That leads through toil and peril into life; And trusted then, when strength and wealth were mine, To rock the cradle of her fading age, As she had soothed the infancy of mine. But Heaven refused the boon. There is a grief Severe with double anguish; when the heart Sinks burdened with a present woe, and waits For darker evils hastening in its train. Such grief was ours. . . . . . What darkness followed then! It settled down upon the present scene In thick dismay, and on the future cast An ominous shade, involving earth, and life, And hope. The sacred light of home was dimmed. The tender smile, the voice of patient love, The anxious counsel, the directing eye, Cheered the sad pathway of my youth no more. The shadow settled on my heart. The world Had other lights, but none to fill that void; And friends, but none that wore a mother's heart. IMPRESSIONS ON ENTERING COLLEGE. PORTRAIT OF HIS EARLY FRIEND, JOHN E. ABBOT. Thus months rolled on, and academic halls Received me to their venerable shade. What awe befell me, when beneath my foot Echoed those walks and chambers, consecrate To mind, and hallowed by the memory Of older times, and memorable men! There roamed the bashful rustic, friendless, lone, Unnoticed. Every form that crossed his path Was new, and each to his enthusiast eye His far superior. These were sons of light, Favorites of Science, votaries of the Muse, For whom the laurel puts its honors forth, And Fame prepares her pedestal, and Earth Waits with her myriads through all future years To take instruction from their reverend lips. He shrunk aside,—for what, alas! was he, Amid the throng of Learning's hopeful sons? His spirit sickened, and the thought of home, Where he was cherished, and could feel himself To that recluse and unambitious walk Not all inadequate, weighed on his frame. He panted to return—longed to resign His hope of lettered honors—and repose, Not all alone, upon the hearth he loved. Then—like an angel who can read the soul, Appointed to come down and cheer the weak— The generous, the devoted Reginald, My elder, my superior, but through love And lowly self-abandonment my friend, Beheld me droop, interpreted my thought, Read the deep trouble of my wandering eye, And knew the language of my hectic cheek. He spoke to me—he drew my arm in his— With cheerful tones encouraged me—revived My palsied energy—breathed hope, life, strength, And emulation; with a brother's arm, And love like that a gentle sister feels, He led me onward, now no more alone. How blest the passage of those halcyon days, When mind with mind communed, and heart with heart, As, freed from care, in learning's shady walks, We culled the idle fancies of the hour; Or, in our higher moments, talked of truth, Of science, virtue, and philosophy— The powers of nature and the soul—the world's Strange history—man's illustrious works And wayward fate! Then all the ages past Came in review to help us prophesy Of those to come, and judge of that which is. These were rich hours. We had them not alone. The sages of all time were summoned up To talk with us, and thoughts grew large, And manhood swelled within us as we drank Their glorious accents in. And thence we turned To watch the dawn of an Augustan age Opening around us, destined to outshine The Roman glory. Quick our bosoms throbbed, And with keen eyes we traced the rising light, And ardently foretold the coming day. Earth heaved with the commotion—nations groaned; Mind sprang to life and exercise—the bounds Of ancient knowledge every where gave way— New truths, new lights, new wonders grew and spread; And from the very horrors of the field, Which teemed with blood and crime, leaped forth to life The science that adorns, the arts that bless. Genius awoke in every land; a voice, Loud as the cry which from the cloisters rang, And armed all Europe for the sacred war, Spoke to the earnest heart of generous youth, And bade them join this new crusade for man. We heard the voice—our bosoms gave response. We spoke strong words of gratulation deep, That we were born to witness and partake The high excitement of the teeming age. We longed to know the issue of events, And what this toiling energy of mind, With Heaven co-working, should bring forth to bless The waiting earth. How glowed our prophet words! How eagerly we sketched our plans! How pure, How large, benevolent, and resolute, The track of useful glory he portrayed! And with enthusiast eye, and thrilling voice, That trembled with the emotion of the soul, He breathed his hopes aloud, and none could doubt, Who heard him pour his burning spirit forth, That he had will to make his visions truth, And only death could rob him of the power. I had not thought him mortal. For he seemed So fitted for some chosen work on earth, That, in my rash fatuity, I thought, God cannot spare him from this suffering sphere; Life shall be long to him, and crowned at length, In the calm evening of a gray old age, With heaven's bright chaplet of successful toil, And earth's of reverend honor. So I dreamed; And all my future projects, plans, and hopes Twined with his presence. . . . . . . Tell me, you that can, The colored language that shall paint his soul. Give me the words, that I may draw him true, And lovely as he was to those he loved. Gentleness sat upon his even brow, And from his eye beamed meek benignity; While its peculiar, almost tearful gaze, Went to the soul of all it fell upon. If we might think some spirit, purified From evil stains, robed once again in flesh, And sent on messages of love to men, Such we might deem my friend; so pure; so calm; So unregardful of the petty cares And small impertinences that annoy All other men; so thoughtless of himself; So bent on others' good; so seemingly Unconscious of the tempting things of earth, And musing ever on some purer scenes. How quietly, yet forcibly, he stood! Humble, yet bold; not eloquent, indeed, But something better; winning, clear, and sweet; Where his fond flock looked up to hear and learn. No thunder from his voice, and from his eye No lightning; but the gentle breath of spring Recalling flowers to life,—the summer shower Softly refreshing the luxuriant herb,— The placid sun, whose penetrating beams, Steadfast and gradual, lead the season on,— The quiet dew, that nourishes unseen,— These are the holy images that tell The style and efficacy of his work; While from the sacred rostrum he came down To cheer the humble, and reclaim the bad, And as a friend, from house to house to spread Improvement, consolation, joy, reproof, And turn his parish walks to walks of heaven. What was my joy to sit beneath his voice, To witness the intense, devoted love Which bound his people to him, hear their words, And see their tears of gratitude and praise, And watch the growth of goodness from his toil! O Heaven! that I should see it all, and live To see its end, its mournful end so soon! A few short months in manhood's early prime, He labored, faltered;—and my broken heart Felt that yon grave had buried in its womb The strongest tie that bound me to the world. So pass the friendships of this earth away; So shades and sorrows fall upon the path That beamed the brightest. But the shades of grief Rest not forever on the darkened soul; Time gently scatters them; and deathless hope Throws back the curtain of the fearful tomb, And shows its tenants robed in radiant day. The heart no more is troubled; anchored fast On this strong hope, it sits in peace, Serenely waiting—wisdom harshly learned, Perchance, but needful, known in words to all, But husbanded and real to the few, Who, willingly submissive, at the feet Of stern affliction sit. And blessed are they Who bear that sweet serenity of mind Taught by the consciousness that every good Of earth is fleeting, save the one high worth, Which, being kindred to the worth of heaven, Partakes its immortality, and glows Brighter and better when all else decays. These ne'er shall know with hopeless pang to mourn A true friend's loss. Hope triumphs; dust and death Sever them not; for earth, to them, and heaven Are one; and in communion of the soul, In all that truly makes th' immortal mind, In thoughts, affections, wishes, they are joined Inseparably; till hoary Time, at length, The great restorer, lifts his awful veil, And ushers them to glory, face to face. A SISTER'S LOVE. A sister's love! I dwell upon the theme— The only love on earth to which the earth Has given no taint of self-regardful care. In even the mother's breast, a selfish fear Throbs with the pulse of pure maternal joy, And her own image mingles with the scene Which Hope makes radiant with her boy's renown. But in a sister's breast affection lives, All pure, unselfish, looking but to him. Angel for angel glows with such regard, Thus whole, deep, self-forgetting. Bowers of heaven Witness it in the cherubs' changeless loves; Earth sees it in a sister's heart alone. Devoted, passionless, unwearied—strong To bear, exhaustless in its sympathy— True in all change—unchilled by coldness. Scorn, Neglect, and rudeness such as man's poor pride Sometimes returns for all the gentle cares And sacrifice of sisterly regard,— These never move her. Patient to the last, She watches through an unrewarded life, And smooths the pillow of ungrateful death. But when the brother knows and owns her worth, Tell me, what fellowship on earth like theirs? See what a radiance glows upon their path! Such as thy hand has drawn, illustrious bard, In Jane de Montfort—image unapproached Of noble tenderness—or such as stood In tears and woe at Korner's early tomb; Or sat, through days of waywardness and love, By Elia's side, to cheer a languid hope, And soothe th' unequal pilgrimage of pain. And always thus—beneath a thousand roofs, It toils, waits, watches, and imparts a hue Of holiest heaven to low humanity. THE OLD ELM. Graceful and vigorous to the last, thine arms Still stretching forth their broad, protecting shade, With wooing invitation, and thy leaves Smiling and whispering peace,—so dost thou wait With patient gentleness the slow decay That bears thee to the dust. I bless thee, friend, Companion, teacher. Many are the joys And much the wisdom I have drawn from thee At noon and evetide musing in thy shade, In childhood's sport and manhood's thoughtfulness; And now, upon thy venerable form, Which years have shattered, my enfeebled eyes, Which years have dimmed, I rest,—and gather in Lessons of strength and peace to cheer life's slow decline. There the bright oriole built his airy home, Pendent from slender bough, beyond the hope Of truant boy. In safety there his brood, Rocked by the varying winds, enjoyed repose. Gay, brilliant creature; hidden 'mid the leaves, Silent, or shouting forth his rich, free note; And now from bough to bough flitting along, Just seen by glimpses, like a bright-red flash Stealthily gleaming from the ragged clouds:— Or redbreast, at the twilight close of day, Pouring out happiness in cheerful tones Of clear, strong melody. Or watch the swallows—while on busy wing, Now mounting high in frolic play, and now Skimming with level sweep the grassy plain, Or pool's smooth surface; chattering now In congregated crowds upon the roof, Or darting in and out the ancient barn, With notes of glee and motions of delight, That made me long to join their gladsome sport, On buoyant wings like theirs;—and now retired Apart from crowd and song, and gliding soft On silent pinions poised, as if to muse In meditative wisdom, and restore The sober balance of a thoughtful mind. AMBITION. Like the fierce war-horse on the battle's verge, That sees the tumult and the fire, and pants To be a sharer in the crimson strife,— Youth stands upon the threshold of the world: It sees the stir and struggle; courts a share, Impatient, in the manly enterprise, And burns to wreck its buoyancy of mind And body in some province of the field Where action would be glory. Health and hope Fill every vein with fire, and urge the charge. It cannot bear to be the thing it is, Nor suffer other men to be so—thinks All might be better, and resolves they shall. Then, in the deep recesses of its breast, Muses, and plans, and builds its vast designs, Like the prophetic architect, who sees The purposed fabric ere its columns rise, And feeds in prospect on its future fame. Or moved, it may be, with less generous aim, The young adventurer for greatness pants; And, cheated by that most perverted word, Plots mischief, rides on ruin's wing, extends The empire of his name, and lives on blood, The vampyre of his age.—'Tis from these dreams Of passionate youth the germ has sprung to life That ripened into Cæsars. Praise to God, Who baffles human madness as he will, That schemes of such ambitious wickedness So often fall, like bad, untimely fruit, Blasted in early budding! But, alas! A countless progeny of good resolves Dies also in the flower,—whose ripened fruit Exulting earth would hail, and heaven reward. The pathway of my youth is strewed with wrecks Of noble plans o'erthrown; and as I stray Among the ruins, melancholy fills My sad, regretful spirit. Not in Rome, Nor glorious Athens, nor the older world Entombed beside the Nile, the wanderer finds More fruitful themes for curious, pensive thought And meditative wisdom, than are given By the strewed remnants of those brilliant schemes, Those wasted day-dreams of magnificence, Which built their splendid structures in my brain, And rose and fell like visions of the night;— Some proud and selfish, like that prodigal Extent of stone and gold which Rome's bad lord Reared on the Palatine—the wonder, shame, And folly of the age—the monument of lust Which preyed on others, and of pride which scoffed At man, and virtue, justice, truth, and Heaven;— Some pure and generous, like those huge-arched piles Which stretch their haggard lines across the bleak Campagna, formed, in better days, to bear Refreshing streams of purity and health To Rome's hot crowd; some consecrate to Heaven, Like that rich house, the wonder of the world, Which on the sacred mount received the cloud Of God's symbolic presence, and the steps Of his benignant Son. But all alike— Fane, palace, conduit, fabric of the brain— Have perished,—perished never to revive,— The good and ill together. LOVE. Then came the June-like season, when fond youth, Like solitary man in Paradise, Finds there is yet a good he has not gained.— Maternal Nature whispers in his heart That there is somewhere one to make him blest, And guides him, by her mystic sympathy, To find the stranger out. The new pursuit How full of wild delight! Through what strange walks Of timorous eagerness, doubt, fear, and hope, He shuns, approaches, trembles, joys, despairs! In twilight walks, in moonlight reveries, In midnight watchings, she is with him still. The wave reflects her form; the balmy air Breathes on him with her breath; the rustling bough Repeats the name that murmurs at his heart. One object fills and satisfies his soul. Others are there by sufferance—joys and tasks Alike are hurried through with absent thought, And nought finds welcome but the one, one loved And ever-present image. This, enshrined, Like some select divinity, within, Fills with its conscious presence all the place; Sheds its own hue and character around; And lulls the spirit in delicious trance, Like the half-waking sleeper of the morn, Who knows he dreams, yet loves his dream the more. O, days to be remembered! days of balm! Spring-tide of life! when flowers strew all the path, And odorous blossoms burden every bough! Is there a path about my native home, Is there a hidden beauty of the fields, A more obscure retirement in the woods, A fairer bank upon the rippling lake, Or lovelier arbor in her grottoed isle, That was not witness, is not monument, Of those delicious days? The earth still speaks, The groves and waters, of the musing mood In which I roamed, and thought of her I loved. Lately I returned, Threaded the woods again, and climbed the stile, And launched upon the pond,—and spite the change Which time had made, a voice rose up from all, The voice of early hope, and told again, In the same tones, the tales it told of yore. But other voices mingled in the breeze, And sung, methought, a requiem for the dead— So wild, so soothing, that my fancy deemed The sainted spirit, once the life and breath Of all these scenes, was present yet again, Hovering on wings celestial and unseen, And pouring blessings on the heart she loved. Why should we deem it fable that the good Lean, sometimes, from their paradise on high, To soothe and pity those they loved below? It was not beauty which had won my heart, But something more enchanting. Beauty lies Ofttimes in forms, in features, hue, or grace, To which the soul has lent no eloquence. But angels called her good, and smiled, well pleased, When she was numbered of their happy choir. If purity of heart, serene and clear As the bright depths of liquid Horicon,— If energy and strength of resolute will, To do and suffer, though all earth oppose,— Like faithful Abdiel,—kindness never tired In toil for others, quiet self-respect Which awes th' unworthy from too near approach, With unassuming diffidence of self, Which scarce dares hear, and never asks for praise, And deep, confiding trust in Him whose work And minister it was her joy to be,— If these be traits that mark th' angelic host, Then was she one of that illustrious choir. To one upon the threshold of the world, Whose opening way to life is thronged with forms That lie in wait to threaten and seduce, There is a worth untold in virtuous love. 'Tis as a talisman of power: unhurt It bears him on, through snares of crafty vice, And long array of pleasure's subtle host, Baffling with potent charm their wily arts, That lose their power to touch him. Thoughts impure, Low aims, and selfish passions, shrink away. It keeps him chaste—makes all his purposes Companions of a virtuous hope—beats down The harmful empire of the present hour, Pointing his thought to some sweet future home, Henceforth his central purpose, which imparts Fresh vigor to his enterprise—to hand And mind gives nerve, to pleasure turns all toil, Makes honor doubly dear—all that is bad In young ambition purifies, and lifts High above selfishness the darling plan Which forms his ruling passion. For he toils No more alone, nor only for himself. The honor, peace, yea, life—and, more than all, The good opinion of a purer mind— A second, better conscience,—whose reproof Stings deeper, whose approval gives more joy Than his own breast—are all at stake in him; And for her sake, in whom are hoarded up The dearest treasures of his life on earth, He keeps an uncontaminated heart, And scorns the base seductiveness of sin. O holy power of pure, devoted love! And O, thou holy, sacred name of home! Prime bliss of earth! Behind us and before Our guiding star, our refuge! When we plunge, Loose from the safeguard of a father's roof, On life's uncertain flood, exposed and driven, 'Tis the mild memory of thy sacred days That keeps the young man pure. A father's eye, A mother's smile, a sister's gentle love, The table, and the altar, and the hearth, In reverend image, keep their early hold Upon his heart, and crowd out guilt and shame. Then, too, the hope, that in some after day These consecrated ties shall be renewed In him, the founder of another house; And wife and children—earth's so precious names— Be gathered round the hearth, where he himself Shall be the father—O, this glowing hope, With memory co-working, lightens toil, And renders impotent the plots of earth To warp him from his innocence and faith. MANHOOD. Wild solitude of precipice and flood, Romantic Trenton! let me sing thy praise. The hills were cleft to give thy waters way; The rocks were riven to form their chasmed bed. On either hand the steep, dark walls ascend, Like ruined towers o'erhung with tangled vines, And plants that love the rock, and tall, thick trees That twine their boughs above, and fling a hue Of solemn darkness on the flood below. Rushing impetuous through this charmed ravine, Thy roaring torrent pours—now swift and smooth; Now shattered by intruding crags; now hurled Headlong down sudden gulfs, where dizzying whirls Point to the fearful depth that yawns below; Now crowding fiercely through the straitened pass; Now in th' outspreading basin finding rest In cool and sombrous shades—a lucid lake Of clear, black waters, motionless as glass— Thence, issuing swift, they leap the precipice, And, foaming down from ledge to ledge, keep on Their reckless way; till, from the hills set free, Through level plains they calmly glide along, Refresh the quiet meadows as they pass, And seek their mother sea. Upon thy bank, Fair creek of Canada, the wanderer's foot Ne'er wearies. Kindled by the varying scene, From crag he springs to crag, from pass to pass— Now, treading on the low, broad marge, his foot Touches the wave; now, clambering the ascent, He creeps with cautious step along the shelf Hewn midway in the dizzy precipice— Nor stays his course, till in the open heaven, Freed from its troubled channel, he beholds The wearied flood roll languid o'er the plain. O Life! so often likened to a stream,— Thus by thy youth's wild banks and rushing tide My memory fondly lingers—thus I trace Its bright, impetuous, fickle, playful course, Wild, changeful, beautiful. But now the flood Emerges into manhood's sober day: With useful wave it irrigates the mead, And crowds and duties press its fruitful shores. But “the Nine” haunt it not. Romance forsakes Its tamer borders. Vulgar toil, with plough And wagon, treads its busy banks, And soulless drudges scornfully survey The beauties of the stream that yields them gain. AGE. Youth's fires are quenched, and manhood's toils are o'er; The days of early hope, the older years Of disappointment, all have run their course, And hope and disappointment here below Are mine no more. From morn to noon, my life Has rolled its brightening and its cloudy way, And noon begins to wane. The Spring has seen Her garlands blush and wither on my brow;— The Summer wheeled her burning suns abroad, And I have toiled beneath their ripening blaze. Now, welcome to my faint and weary limbs Autumn's cool breath, and sober bowers of rest. I long to sit in their refreshing shade, And bare my whitening tresses to the wind, And pluck th' o'erhanging fruit, and yield my mind To pensive musing. Come, advancing age— I bid thee welcome with thy reverend brow, And mien of bland composure. Come, and lay Thy hand benignant on my aching head; Pour thy tranquillity upon my heart; And let thy soothing calm, thy thoughtful peace, Thy wise and venerable cheerfulness, Hush down the stormy elements of strife, And rock my harassed being to repose. There are who paint thee hideous—eyes of rheum, And ears that catch no sound—bones full of pain— The day a burden—night one weary watch— The temper soured—the heart's sweet fountains dried— Mind dull and prejudiced—this curious frame, This matchless instrument of sense and soul, Turned to a rack of torture—and this life, Once of itself enjoyment, made a curse. O, come not in this fearful guise to me! This garb of living death—nor lengthen out The useless hours of this poor tortured clay To pine in stupid dotage—to annoy, With its encumbering helplessness, the path Of those who love me, and to be a mark For gaze and insult to th' unfeeling crowd, That mock at human weakness. More than all, Spare, spare the mind! from touch of fell decay O keep the spirit free! nor let a frost Fall on the heart's affections, to congeal Its generous blood. 'Tis sad, 'tis horrible, When the frail, tottering, shrivelled form of age Shakes with its petty passions, and degrades Its sacred hairs, And dull fatuity, with garrulous tongue, Prates from the lips which should be wisdom's throne. 'Tis horrible to see the great mind bowed, The spark ethereal quenched, thought, feeling, heart, And all that makes man honored, loved, revered, Sunk in the baby idiocy of years Without revival. Then, if length of days Must bring such degradation, be their flight In mercy stayed, is still my earnest prayer. I would not see the day when I might wish My friend or father dead—when friend or child Might wish me so. O, when in good ripe age A sharp disease would summon us away, Let not too fond affection interpose, Compelling us to stay. Better depart While we can go lamented, ere the hands Of those that love are weary of their charge, And o'er our tomb no voice exclaims, “O, friend Too early lost!” I saw an old man once Laid on a couch from which there seemed no hope That he should rise. He had been one of those Whom all men honor, and whom friends revere. Years had not dimmed his mind, and his warm heart Glowed with youth's generous fires and faithful loves. Disease had changed him not. The placid brow, Furrowed by time, yet speaking cheerful things, The mild, sweet smile, the serious, playful eye, Adorned his bed, as they had decked his health; While quiet words of love to friends below, And trust in Him above, flowed forth from lips Accustomed to their utterance. Ripe he seemed For Heaven's immortal garner; and if then He had been gathered by God's reaper in, Admiring, weeping crowds had led him home, And made his tomb a shrine of pilgrimage. But wife, friends, children, day and night, with tears And cries that would not be refused, desired That he might live. They knew not what they asked, Blind through excess of love. The answer came, Fraught with rebuke and wisdom. He was spared. His flesh came to him like a child's; his frame Once more grew strong; but back to infancy His doting mind returned—he lived a babe— Sense, memory, knowledge, all deserted him, And left him but a blank, an idiot blank, To be watched, tended, chidden, like a child; Till those who had refused to set him free, Because they loved him fondly, lived to mourn His wearily-protracted days, and wish That Death would strike and rid them of their charge. But thou, most ancient and majestic elm, Whose ample arms my childish sports o'erspread, Whose long familiar shades, with grateful gloom, Are still so welcome to my fevered brow, Thou—in thy vigorous and brawny form— Hoary, yet cheerful—gently touched by time, Not broken—tellest of a kindlier age— With what a stately grace thy massive trunk Bears up its burden of a hundred years! With just enough decay upon its boughs To lend a graceful sadness to its strength. In form like this, I woo the slow advance Of long-protracted life—protracted not Too long.—Such be its deep tranquillity, Its cheerful vigor, dignity, and grace, And calm, religious peace, as Bryant sketched,— Whose tints are beauty, and whose pencil truth,— Or like the reverend portrait Tully drew. For I have faith that in that distant day— That bright, enduring day, for which man's soul Is destined—I shall roam, from light to light, Through all your orbs, and tread your spotless courts, Read the long records of your ancient day, And share your toils and pleasures. Glorious hope! To spring from this dim planet, wafted on To brightness after brightness—visitant And witness of the infinite abodes Of perfect truth and love—to trace with joy In all the One Almighty, and to join The harmonious choirs of heaven, whose glorious song Rings through the eternal arches evermore— To sit in converse blessed, not with the saints Alone on earth illustrious, but with those The sage and holy of remoter spheres— The ransomed from all planets—sons of grace And purity from all the stars—whose eyes Have never looked, perchance, on sin; whose ears Have heard, whose hearts conceived no crime; Whose stainless hands have wrought no task but love's; Whose voice has uttered only wisdom;—bards Inspired from founts of highest heaven; Philosophers, to whom earth's science lies, When loftiest, infinitely low; whose mind, Not creeping step by step, like man's, but quick And piercing, like the light, flashes on truth And knowledge; and whose love of excellence, Unsullied by the low desires and tastes Of earth, is ever active, vigilant, and free. This is my present dream—my last, best dream. A dream? No—not of that false progeny, Engendered when the mind has shut its eye To all things real, and in darkness dwells With unsubstantial phantoms—not a dream— A faithful vision, based on promises Which reason knows substantial, wrought in light On nature's broadest page, and spoke in words By the strong utterance of a prophet's voice, From the tomb ringing. It is Faith that pours Its radiant flood of glory on my soul, And lights the future with a steadfast ray That cannot lead aside. Have I not seen The very flowers beneath my foot decay And live? the worm upon the summer bough Entombed and raised? the forest fade? the field Lie dead, and Nature in her cold, white shroud— Yet summoned back to life? and tell me why, Except as teachers to immortal man. Have I not heard the marvels of thy name, Great Prince of Judah? seen the powers of Heaven Poured lavish on thy head? and by the word Felt the creation of another life Burst in upon my mind? and from the cave Hast thou not risen victorious over death, To tell misdoubting man that he shall live? I slept,—but now I wake; my opened eyes Have dropped their earthly scales, and see how all This sublunary scene is but a dream. The sun of Faith reveals realities— Truth sheds her light—Delusion reigns no more. Not in the city—though the solemn tower Of ancient and most reverend minster cast Its holy shadow on the sleeper's bed, And, with the anthems of its daily choir And deep-toned worship of its holy bells, Utter perpetual requiem—works of man, Though consecrate to Heaven, are human still— And I would rest my dust with God. No tower Of mystic grandeur, anthem-peal, or chime Of sacred bell, can hallow what the foot Of vulgar crowds, on boisterous toil intent, Or wealthy pleasure rolling constant by, Shaking the very tombs, must desecrate. Even sacred night is sacred there no more; And weeping love in vain desires the hour To see the spot where buried friendship lies, And nourish heavenward thought upon its grave. Not in the city's churchyard lay me down— Whose trodden paths lead to no quiet spot For holy contemplation, and the hour Of solitary thought, that soothes the soul, Purges from earth, exalts, and fits for heaven— But bear me far away from man's domain, And lay me down in nature's; where, alike By day or night, the tearful friend may sit Unnoticed by, and quite forget the world.</field>
