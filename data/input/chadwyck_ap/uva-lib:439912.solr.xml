      <field name="fulltext">POEMS. âIt cannot be unbound, my autumn sheaf:â Then let it stand, a relic of the past, Its mystery all its own, and it will last.â A STILL DAY IN AUTUMN. I love to wander through the woodlands hoary, In the soft gloom of an autumnal day, When Summer gathers up her robes of glory, And, like a dream of beauty, glides away. How through each loved, familiar path she lingers, Serenely smiling through the golden mist, Tinting the wild grape with her dewy fingers, Till the cool emerald turns to amethyst; Kindling the faint stars of the hazel, shining To light the gloom of Autumn's mouldering halls; With hoary plumes the clematis entwining, Where, o'er the rock, her withered garland falls. Warm lights are on the sleepy uplands waning Beneath dark clouds along the horizon rolled, Till the slant sunbeams, through their fringes raining, Bathe all the hills in melancholy gold. The moist winds breathe of crispÃ¨d leaves and flowers, In the damp hollows of the woodland sown, Mingling the freshness of autumnal showers With spicy airs from cedarn alleys blown. Beside the brook and on the umbered meadow, Where yellow fern-tufts fleck the faded ground, With folded lids beneath their palmy shadow, The gentian nods, in dewy slumbers bound. Upon those soft, fringed lids the bee sits brooding, Like a fond lover loath to say farewell; Or, with shut wings, through silken folds intruding, Creeps near her heart his drowsy tale to tell. The little birds upon the hill-side lonely Flit noiselessly along from spray to spray, Silent as a sweet, wandering thought, that only Shows its bright wings and softly glides away. The scentless flowers, in the warm sunlight dreaming, Forget to breathe their fullness of delight; And through the trancÃ¨d woods soft airs are streaming, Still as the dew-fall of the summer night. So, in my heart, a sweet, unwonted feeling Stirs, like the wind in ocean's hollow shell, Through all its secret chambers sadly stealing, Yet finds no words its mystic charm to tell. 1848. THE TRAILING ARBUTUS. There's a flower that grows by the greenwood tree, In its desolate beauty more dear to me Than all that bask in the noontide beam Through the long, bright summer by fount and stream. Like a pure hope nursed beneath sorrow's wing, Its timid buds from the cold moss spring; Their delicate hues like the pink sea-shell, Or the shaded blush of the hyacinth's bell; Their breath more sweet than the faint perfume That breathes from the bridal orange-bloom. It is not found by the garden wall, It wreathes no brow in the festal hall; But it dwells in the depths of the shadowy wood, And shines, like a star, in the solitude. Never did numbers its name prolong, Ne'er hath it floated on wings of song; Bard and minstrel have passed it by, And left it, in silence and shade, to die. But with joy to its cradle the wild bees come, And praise its beauty with drony hum; And children love, in the season of spring, To watch for its earliest blossoming. In the dewy morn of an April day, When the traveler lingers along the way; When the sod is sprinkled with tender green Where rivulets water the earth, unseen; When the floating fringe on the maple's crest Rivals the tulip's crimson vest, And the budding leaves of the birch-trees throw A trembling shade on the turf below; When my flower awakes from its dreamy rest, And yields its lips to the sweet southwest, Then, in those beautiful days of spring, With hearts as light as the wild bird's wing, Flinging their tasks and their toys aside, Gay little groups through the wood-paths glide, Peeping and peering among the trees As they scent its breath on the passing breeze, Hunting about, among lichens gray And the tangled mosses beside the way, Till they catch the glance of its quiet eye, Like light that breaks through a cloudy sky. For me, sweet blossom, thy tendrils cling Round my heart of hearts as in childhood's spring; And thy breath, as it floats on the wandering air, Wakes all the music of memory there. Thou recallest the time when, a fearless child, I roved all day through the wood-walks wild, Seeking thy blossoms by bank and brae, Wherever the snow-drifts had melted away. Now as I linger, mid crowds alone, Haunted by echoes of music flown; When the shadows deepen around my way, And the light of reason but leads astray; When affections, nurtured with fondest care In the trusting heart, become traitors there; When, weary of all that the world bestows, I turn to nature for calm repose, How fain my spirit, in some far glen, Would fold her wings mid thy flowers again! MOONRISE IN MAY. Long lights gleam o'er the western wold, Kindling the brown moss into gold; The bright day fades into the blue Of the far hollows, dim with dew; The breeze comes laden with perfume From many an orchard white with bloom, And all the mellow air is fraught With beauty beyond Fancy's thought. Outspread beneath me, breathing balm Into the evening's golden calm, Lie trellised gardens, thickly sown With nodding lilacs, newly blown; Borders with hyacinthus plumed, And beds with purple pansies gloomed; Cold snow-drops, jonquils pale and prim, And flamy tulips, burning dim In the cool twilight, till they fold In sleep their oriflammes of gold. With many a glimmering interchange Of moss and flowers and terraced range, The pleasant garden slopes away Into the gloom of shadows gray, Where, darkly green, the church-yard lies, With all its silent memories: There the first violets love to blow About the head-stones, leaning low; There, from the golden willows, swing The first green garlands of the spring; And the first bluebird builds her nest By the old belfry's umbered crest. Beyond, where groups of stately trees, Waiting their vernal draperies, Stand outlined on the evening sky, The golden lakes of sunset lie; With many-colored isles of light, Purple and pearl and chrysolite, And realms of cloud-land, floating far Beyond the horizon's dusky bar,â Now fading from the lurid bloom Of twilight to a silver gloom, As the fair moon's ascending beam Melts all things to a holy dream. So fade the cloud-wreaths from my soul Beneath thy solemn, soft control, Enchantress of the stormy seas, Priestess of Night's high mysteries! Thy ray can pale the north light's plume, And, where the throbbing stars illume With their far-palpitating light The holy cloisters of the night, Thy presence can entrance their beams, And lull them to diviner dreams. To thee belong the silent spheres Of memory,âthe enchanted years Of the dead Past,âthe shrouded woes That sleep in sculptural repose. Thy solemn light doth interfuse The magic world wherein I muse With something too divinely fair For earthly hope to harbor there; A faith that reconciles the will Life's mystic sorrow to fulfill; A benison of love that falls From the serene and silent halls Of night, till through the lonely room A heavenly odor seems to bloom, And lilies of eternal peace Glow through the moonlight's golden fleece. THE MORNING-GLORY. When the peach ripens to a rosy bloom, When purple grapes glow through the leafy gloom Of trellised vines, bright wonder, thou dost come, Cool as a star dropt from night's azure dome, To light the early morning, that doth break More softly beautiful for thy sweet sake. Thy fleeting glory to my fancy seems Like the strange flowers we gather in our dreams; Hovering so lightly o'er the slender stem, Wearing so meekly the proud diadem Of penciled rays, that gave the name you bear Unblamed amid the flowers, from year to year. The tawny lily, flecked with jetty studs, Pard-like, and dropping through long, pendent buds, Her purple anthers; nor the poppy, bowed In languid sleep, enfolding in a cloud Of drowsy odors her too fervid heart, Pierced by the day-god's barbed and burning dart; Nor the swart sunflower, her dark brows enrolled With their broad carcanets of living gold,â A captive princess, following the car Of her proud conqueror; nor that sweet star, The evening primrose, pallid with strange dreams Born of the wan moon's melancholy beams; Nor any flower that doth its tendrils twine Around my memory, hath a charm like thine. Child of the morning, passionless and fair As some ethereal creature of the air, Waiting not for the bright lord of the hours To weary of thy bloom in sultry bowers; Nor like the summer rose, that one by one, Yields her fair, fragrant petals to the sun, Faint with the envenomed sweetness of his smile, That doth to lingering death her race beguile; But, as some spirit of the air doth fade Into the light from its own essence rayed, So, Glory of the morning, fair and cold, Soon in thy circling halo dost thou fold Thy virgin bloom, and from our vision hide That form too fair, on earth, unsullied to abide. âThe disk of the Convolvulus, after remaining expanded for a few hours, gathers itself up within the five star-like rays that intersect the corolla until it is entirely concealed from sight.ââ St. Pierre. 1849. WOOD-WALKS IN SPRING. âPleasure sits in the flower cups, and breathes itself out in fragrance.â Rahel. As the fabled stone into music woke When the morning sun o'er the marble broke, So wakes the heart from its stern repose, As, o'er brow and bosom, the spring wind blows; So it stirs and trembles, as each low sigh Of the breezy south comes murmuring by,â Murmuring by, like a voice of love, Wooing us forth amid flowers to rove; Breathing of meadow-paths, thickly sown With pearls, from the blossoming fruit-trees blown, And of banks that slope to the southern sky, Where languid violets love to lie. No foliage droops o'er the wood-path now, No dark vines, swinging from bough to bough; But a trembling shadow of silvery green Falls through the young leaf's tender screen, Like the hue that borders the snow-drop's bell, Or lines the lid of an Indian shell; And a fairy light, like the firefly's glow, Flickers and fades on the grass below. There the pale anemone lifts her eye, To look at the clouds as they wander by; Or lurks in the shade of a palmy fern, To gather fresh dews in her waxen urn. Where the moss lies thick on the brown earth's breast, The shy little may-flower weaves her nest; But the south wind blows o'er the fragrant loam, And betrays the path to her woodland home. Already the green-budding, birchen spray Winnows the balm from the breath of May; And the aspen thrills to a low, sweet tone From the reedy bugle of Faunus blown. In the tangled coppice, the dwarf-oak weaves Her fringe-like blossoms and crimson leaves; The sallows their delicate buds unfold Into downy feathers bedropped with gold; While, thick as stars in the midnight sky, In the dark, wet meadows the cowslips lie. A love-tint flushes the wind-flower's cheek, Rich melodies gush from the violet's beak; On the rifts of the rock the wild columbines grow, Their heavy honey-cups bending low As a heart which vague, sweet thoughts oppress Droops with its burden of happiness. There the waters drip from their moss-rimmed wells, With a sound like the tinkling of silver bells, Or fall, with a mellow and flute-like flow, Through the channeled clefts of the rock below. Soft music gushes in every tone, And perfume in every breeze is blown; The flower in fragrance, the bird in song, The glittering wave as it glides along,â All breathe the incense of boundless bliss, The eloquent music of happiness. Yet sad would the spring-time of Nature seem To the soul that wanders 'mid life's dark dream, Its glory a meteor that sweeps the sky, A blossom that floats on the storm-wind by, If it woke no thought of that starry clime Beyond the desolate seas of Time; If it nurtured no delicate flower, to blow On the hills where the palm and the amaranth grow. ON A STATUE OF DAVID. Suggested by a model executed by Thomas F. Hoppin, of Providence. Ay, this is he! the bold and gentle boyâ That in lone pastures by the mountain's side Guarded his fold, and through the midnight sky Saw on the blast the God of battles ride; Beheld his bannered armies on the height, And heard their clarion sound through all the stormy night. Though his fair locks lie all unshorn, and bare To the bold toying of the mountain wind, A conscious glory haunts the o'ershadowing air, And waits, with glittering coil, his brows to bind, While his proud temples bend superbly down, As if they bore, e'en now, the burden of a crown. Though a stern sorrow slumbers in his eyes, As if his prophet glance foresaw the day When the dark waters o'er his soul should rise, And friends and lovers wander far away, Yet the graced impress of that floral mouth Breathes of love's golden dream and the voluptuous south. Peerless in beauty as the prophet star, That in the dewy trances of the dawn, Floats o'er the solitary hills afar, And brings sweet tidings of the lingering morn; Or, weary at the day-god's loitering wain, Strikes on the harp of light a soft, prelusive strain. So his wild harp, with psaltery and shawm, Awoke the nations in thick darkness furled, While mystic winds from Gilead's groves of balm Wafted its sweet hosannas through the world; So, when the day-spring from on high, he sang, With joy the ancient hills and lonely valleys rang. Ay, this is he!âthe minstrel, prophet, king, Before whose arm princes and warriors sank; Who dwelt beneath Jehovah's mighty wing, And from the âriver of his pleasuresâ drank; Or, through the rent pavilions of the storm, Beheld the cloud of fire that veiled his awful form. And now he stands as when in Elah's vale, Where warriors set the battle in array, He met the Titan in his ponderous mail, Whose haughty challenge many a summer's day Rang through the border hills, while all the host Of faithless Israel heard, and trembled at his boast; Till the slight stripling from the mountain fold Stood, all unarmed, amid their sounding shields, And in his youth's first bloom, devoutly bold, Dared the grim champion of a thousand fields; So stands he now, as in Jehovah's might Glorying, he met the foe and won the immortal fight.â A NIGHT IN AUGUST. âAnd thenceforth all that once was fair Grew fairer.â How softly comes the summer wind At evening o'er the hill, Forever murmuring of thee When busy crowds are still; The way-side flowers seem to guess And whisper of my happiness. The jasmine twines her snowy stars Into a fairer wreath; The lily lifts her proud tiÃ¡rs More royally beneath; The snow-drop with her fairy bells, In silver time, the story tells. Through all the dusk and dewy hours, The banded stars above Are singing, in their airy towers, The melodies of love; And clouds of shadowy silver fly All night, like doves, athwart the sky. Fair Dian lulls the throbbing stars Into Elysian dreams; And, rippling through my lattice bars, Her brooding glory streams Around me, like the golden shower That rained through DanÃ¤e's guarded tower. And when the waning moon doth glide Into the valleys gray; When, like the music of a dream, The night-wind dies away; When all the way-side flowers have furled Their wings, with morning dews impearled, A low, bewildering melody Seems murmuring in my ear,â Tones such as in the twilight wood The aspen thrills to hear, When Faunus slumbers on the hill, And all the entrancÃ¨d boughs are still. August, 1848. To ?. Eva, thy beauty comes to me To solace and to save; A marvel and a mystery, A beacon o'er the wave,â A star above the jasper sea, A hope beyond the grave. Oft, when thy harp-tones wild and sweet The waves of passion move, Methinks pale Sappho's songs I hear Murmuring of Phaon's love,â Pale Sappho's passion songs I hear Lamenting her lost love. But in those tender, thoughtful eyes, That look so far away, A pleading Pysche bids me rise To realms of purer day,â A Psyche soaring to the skies, To realms of perfect day. FLORALIE. All the star-flowers on the hill Nod their sweet heads wearily; Through the sad September day, To my lonely heart they say, Floralie is far away. All the little birds that sang In the copse so cheerily, Fluttering from spray to spray, Seem in mournful notes to say, Floralie is far awayâfar away. All the morning-stars that look Through the dawn so drearily, Turning from the joyless day, By their sadness seem to say, Floralie is far away,â Far awayâfar, far away. STANZAS WITH A BRIDAL RING. The young moon hides her virgin heart Within a ring of gold; So doth this little cycle all My bosom's love enfold, And tell the tale that from my lips Seems ever half untold; Like the rich legend of the East, That weaves and interweaves Its linkÃ¨d sweetness, or the rose That hath a hundred leaves. This little fairy talisman Shall love's serene Elysium span; No hope shall pass its mystic round, And all within be holy ground: And here, as in the elfin ring Where fairies dance by night, The green oases of the heart Shall keep their verdure bright, And hope, within this magic round, Still blossom in delight. THE GOLDEN BALL. A TALE OF FAERIE. âIn olden dayes All was the land fulfilled of Faerieâ The Elf Queen, with her jollie companie, Danced full oft in many a grassy mede. This was the old opinion, as I rede.â I speak of many hundred years agoâ But now can no man see the ElvÃ¨s mo.â Chaucer. In the hushed and silken chamber Of my childhood, Eleanore, When the daylight's dying amber Faded on the dusky floor; When the village bells were ringing At the hour of evening prayer, And the little birds were winging Homeward through the dewy air, Wooing me to twilight slumbers, In that soft and balmy clime, Often have I heard the numbers Of the ancient fairy-rhyme,â Listened to the mythic stories Taught when fancy's charmed sway Filled with visionary glories All my childhood's golden day. In the dull and drear December, Sitting by the hearth-light's gleam, Often do I still remember Tales that haunt me like a dream, Often I recall the story Of the outcast child forlorn, Doomed to roam in forest hoary, From the step-dame's cruel scorn. Long she wandered sad and lonely, Till the daylight's dying bloom Left one silver planet only Trembling through the twilight gloom. Orphaned in this world of sorrow, Chased by savage beasts of prey; Doomed, from frantic fears, to borrow Strength to bear her on her way. Still she wandered, faint and weary, Through the forest wild and wide, Till her thoughts grew dark and dreary, And her heart with terror died. When a gracious fairy, wandering Forth to greet the evening star, Found her near a torrent, pondering How to pass its watery bar. Tenderly the gentle stranger Led her to the foaming fall; There, to guide her feet from danger, Down she flung a Golden Ball. Shrined within its charmed hollow Many a mystic virtue lay; Safely might her footsteps follow Wheresoe'er it led the way. Throbbed her heart with fear and wonder, As the magic globe of gold Onward through the rushing thunder Of the stormy torrent rolled: On where boundless forests, burning, Scorched the air and scathed the sight, From earth's livid features turning Back the solemn pall of night: Still on golden axis rolling, Onward, onward, still it sped,â Still the maid, her fears controlling, Fleetly following as it fled: While the raging waters bore her Safely o'er their hollow way, And the flame-lights flashing o'er her Paled like stars at break of day,â Paled before her virgin honor, Paled before her love and truth; Savage natures, gazing on her, Turned to pity and to ruth. So she passed through flood and forest,â Passed the ogre's yawning gate; And when danger threatened sorest Calmly trod the path of fate. Till the night that seemed so dreary Grew more beautiful than day; And her little feet, so weary, Glided gently on their way,â Glided o'er the grassy meadows Steeped in perfume, starred with dew, Glided 'neath the forest shadows Till the moonlight, slanting through, Gleamed athwart a fountain sleeping Calmly in its hollow cells, Where were little fishes leaping All about the lily-bells. Soon the lilies seemed to shiver, And a tremor shook the airâ Curdled all the sleeping riverâ Woke the thunder in its lair! Lo! a fish from out the water Rising oped its rosy gills; 'T was the gracious fairy's daughter, And the air with music thrills, As a sudden glory, bending O'er the fountain's mystic gleam, Changed her to a form transcending Fantasy's divinest dream. Water blooms, with olive twining, Crowned a brow serenely sweet; Robes, like woven lilies shining, Flowed in folds about her feet. With a look of soft imploring, Thus she spoke, in rippling tones, Sweet as summer waters pouring Over reeds and pebble-stones: âThou hast conquered, little stranger! All thy bitter trials past, Safe, through sorrow and through danger, Thou hast won the goal at last. âLift me from the silent water, Let me on thy bosom lie; For I am a fairy's daughter Thralled by cruel sorcery. âDoomed beneath the wave forever, Like the virgin Truth, to dwell, Till a mortal hand shall sever, Link by link, the charmÃ¨d spell; âTill a faithful heart shall fold me To its home of truth and love,â So the ancient Fates have told me, And the answering stars approve. âLift me, then, from out the river, Now my charmÃ¨d life doth cease; Henceforth I am thine forever; Guard me, for my name is Peace.â Thus, dear child, the mythic story Chimes to truth's unerring strain, As the moon, in softened glory, Sings the day-star's sweet refrain. Thus, though step-dame Nature chide thee, And the snares of passion thrall, Unto heavenly Peace shall guide thee Faith's unerring Golden Ball. ON FANNIE'S CHARM LAMP. Within this little fairy urn No earthly naphthas blaze and burn; But spells of necromantic power Lurk in the little silver flower: It is the very lamp, I ween, The wondrous lamp of Aladeen. And he who did the gift impart To the fair regent of his heart, Through life his folly shall deplore, Slave of the lamp for evermore; Slave to the lady and the queen Who holds the lamp of Aladeen. IN APRIL'S DIM AND SHOWERY NIGHTS. In April's dim and showery nights, When music melts along the air, And Memory wakens at the kiss Of wandering perfumes, faint and rare; Sweet, spring-time perfumes, such as won ProsÃ¨rpina from realms of gloom. To bathe her bright locks in the sun, Or bind them with the pansy's bloom; When light winds rift the fragrant bowers Where orchards shed their floral wreath, Strewing the turf with starry flowers, And dropping pearls at every breath; When, all night long, the boughs are stirred With fitful warblings from the nest, And the heart flutters, like a bird, With its sweet, passionless unrest; Oh! then, beloved, I think on thee, And on that life, so strangely fair, Ere yet one cloud of memory Had gathered in hope's golden air. I think on thee and thy lone grave On the green hill-side, far away; I see the wilding flowers that wave Around thee, as the night winds sway. And still, though only clouds remain On life's horizon, cold and drear, The dream of youth returns again With the sweet promise of the year. April, 1848. ON A MAGDALEN BY CARLO DOLCE. Though every line of that sweet, thoughtful face Seems touched by sorrow to a softer grace; Though o'er thy cheek's young bloom a blight hath passed, And dimmed its pensive beauty,âfrom thine eye, With the soft gloom of gathering tears o'er-cast, Doth love shine forth, o'er all, triumphantly; A light which shame nor sorrow could impair, Unquenched, undimmed, through years of lone despair. O love, immortal love! not all in vain The young heart wastes beneath life's weary chain, Filled with thy bright ideal,âwhose excess Of beauty mocks our utter loneliness. The weary bark, long tossing on the shore, Shall find its haven when the storm is o'er; The wandering bee its hive, the bird its nest, And the lone heart of love in heaven its home of rest. SUMMER'S CALL TO THE LITTLE ORPHAN. âViens j'ai des fruits d'or, j'ai des roses; J'en remplirai tes petits bras.â Victor Hugo. The summer skies are darkly blue, The days are still and bright, And Evening trails her robes of gold Through the dim halls of Night. Then, when the little orphan wakes, A low voice whispers, âCome, And all day wander at thy will Beneath my azure dome. âBeneath my vaulted, azure dome, Through all my flowery lands, No higher than the lowly thatch The royal palace stands. âI'll fill thy little longing arms With fruits and wilding flowers; I'll tell thee tales of fairy-land In the long twilight hours.â The orphan hears that wooing voice; Awhile he softly broods,â Then hastens down the sunny slopes, Into the twilight woods. The waving branches murmur Strange secrets in his ear, But the nodding flowers welcome him, And whisper, âNever fear.â He sees the squirrel peeping From the coverts cool and dim, And the water-lilies sleeping Along the fountain's brim. He hears the wild bee humming In the roses by the rill; He nestles in the hollow tree, He clambers up the hill. He weaves a little basket From the willow as he goes, And he heaps it up with blackberries, And blueberries, and sloes. The brook stays him, at the crossing, In its waters cool and sweet, And the pebbles leap around him, And frolic at his feet. Half fearfully, half joyfully, He treads the forest dim, Till he hears the wood-birds chaunting Their holy, sylvan hymn. Then, in the cool of eventide, The Father's voice he hears, As men heard it in the Eden Of Earth's paradisal years. The redbird furls her shining wing, The squirrel seeks his lair; The flowers, folding up their leaves, Incline their heads in prayer. The orphan feels a brooding calm O'er all his senses creep; And, by the little ground-bird's nest, He lays him down to sleep. The Moon comes gliding through the trees, And softly stoops to spread Her dainty silver kirtle Upon his grassy bed. The drowsy Night-wind murmuring Its quaint old tunes the while; Till Morning wakes him with a song, And greets him with a smile. LINES WRITTEN IN NOVEMBER. Farewell the forest shade, the twilight grove, The turfy path with fern and flowers inwove, Where through long summer days I wandered far, Till warned of Evening by her folding star. No more I linger by the fountain's play, Where arching boughs shut out the sultry ray, Making at noontide hours a dewy gloom O'er the moist marge, where weeds and wild flowers bloom; Till, from the western sun, a glancing flood Of arrowy radiance filled the twilight wood, Glinting athwart each leafy, verdant fold, And flecking all the turf with drops of gold. Sweet sang the wild bird on the waving bough Where cold November winds are wailing now; The chirp of insects on the sunny lea, And the low, drowsy bugle of the bee, Are silent all; closed is their vesper lay, Borne by the breeze of Autumn far away. Yet still the withered heath I love to rove, The bare, brown meadow, and the leafless grove; Still love to tread the bleak hill's rocky side, Where nodding asters wave in purple pride, Or, from its summit, listen to the flow Of the dark waters, booming far below. Still through the tangling, pathless copse I stray, Where sere and rustling leaves obstruct the way, To find the last, pale blossom of the year, That strangely blooms when all is dark and drear; The wild witch-hazel, fraught with mystic power To ban or bless, as sorcery rules the hour. Then, homeward wending, through the dusky vale, Where winding rills their evening damps exhale, Pause by the dark pool, in whose sleeping wave Pale Dian loves her golden locks to lave; As when she stole upon Endymion's rest, And his young dreams with heavenly beauty blest. And thou, âstern ruler of the inverted year,â Cold, cheerless Winter, hath thy wild career No sweet, peculiar pleasures for the heart, That can ideal worth to rudest forms impart? When, through thy long, dark nights, cold sleet and rain Patter and plash against the frosty pane, Warm curtained from the storm, I love to lie, Wakeful, and listening to the lullaby Of fitful winds, that as they rise and fall Send hollow murmurs through the echoing hall. Oft, by the blazing hearth at even-tide, I love to see the fitful shadows glide, In flickering motion, o'er the illumined wall, Till slumber's honey-dew my senses thrall; Then, while in dreamy consciousness, I lie 'Twixt sleep and waking, fairy fantasy Culls, from the golden past, a treasured store, And weaves a dream so sweet, hope could not ask for more. In the cold splendor of a frosty night, When blazing stars burn with intenser light Through the blue vault of heaven; when the keen air Sculptures in bolder lines the uplands bare; When sleeps the shrouded earth, in solemn trance, Beneath the wan moon's melancholy glance; I love to mark earth's sister planets rise, And in pale beauty tread the midnight skies; Where, like lone pilgrims, constant as the night, They fill their dark urns from the fount of light. I love the Borealis flames that fly, Fitful and wild, athwart the northern sky; The storied constellations, like a page Fraught with the wonders of a former age, Where monsters grim, gorgons, and hydras rise, And âgods and heroes blaze along the skies.â Thus Nature's music, various as the hour, Solemn or sweet, hath ever mystic power Still to preserve the unperverted heart Awake to love and beauty; to impart Treasures of thought and feeling, pure and deep, That aid the doubting soul its heavenward course to keep. EVENING ON THE BANKS OF THE MOSHASSUCK. âNow to the sessions of sweet, silent thought, I summon up remembrance of things past.â Shakespeare's Sonnets. Again September's golden day, Serenely still, intensely bright, Fades on the umbered hills away, And melts into the coming night. Again Moshassuck's silver tide Reflects each green herb on its side, Each tasseled wreath and tangling vine, Whose tendrils o'er its margin twine. And standing on its velvet shore, Where yester-night, with thee, I stood, I trace its devious course once more, Far winding on, through vale and wood: Now glimmering through yon golden mist, By the last, glinting sunbeams kissed; Now lost, where lengthening shadows fall From hazel copse and moss-fringed wall. Near where yon rocks the stream inurn, The lonely gentian blossoms still; Still wave the star-flower and the fern O'er the soft outline of the hill; While, far aloft, where pine-trees throw Their shade athwart the sunset glow, Thin vapors cloud the illumined air, And parting daylight lingers there. But ah, no longer thou art near, This varied loveliness to see; And I, though fondly lingering here, To-night, can only think on thee. The flowers thy gentle hand caressed Still lie unwithered on my breast; And still thy footsteps print the shore, Where thou and I may rove no more. Again I hear the murmuring fall Of water from some distant dell; The beetle's hum, the cricket's call, And, far away, that evening bell. Again, again, those sounds I hear; But oh, how desolate and drear They seem to-night! how like a knell The music of that evening bell! Again the new moon in the west, Scarce seen upon yon golden sky, Hangs o'er the mountain's purple crest, With one pale planet trembling nigh; And beautiful her pearly light As when we blessed its beams last night; But thou art on the far blue sea, And I can only think on thee. September, 1839. THE GARDEN SEPULCHRE. WRITTEN FOR THE CONSECRATION OF THE CEMETERY AT SWAN POINT, R. I. In the faith of Him who saw The eternal morning rise, Through the open gates of pearl, On the hills of Paradise,â Looking to the promised land, Saw the verdant palms, that wave In the calm and lustrous air, Through the shadows of the grave; In his name whose deathless love, With a glory all divine, Filled the garden sepulchre Far away in Palestine; We would consecrate a place Where our loved ones may repose, When the storms of life are past, And the weary eyelids close; Fairer than a festal hall Wreath the chambers of their rest, Sacred to the tears that fall O'er the slumbers of the blest,â Sacred to the hopes that rise Heavenward from this vale of tears, Soaring, with unwearied wing, Through the illimitable years. Each sweet nursling of the spring Here shall weep its fresh'ning dews; Here its fragile censer swing, And all its fragrant soul diffuse. The lily, in her white symar, Fondly o'er the turf shall wave; Asphodels and violets star All the greensward of the grave. Here the pale anemone In the April breeze shall nod, And the may-flower weave her blooms Through and through the velvet sod. Bending by the storied urn, Purple eglantine shall blow, Till the pallid marble takes, From her cheek, a tender glow. Where the folding branches close In a verdant coronal, Through their dim and dreaming boughs Faintly shall the sunbeams fall. Memories, mournful, yet how sweet! Here shall weave their mystic spell; Angels tread, with silent feet, Paths where love and sorrow dwell. No rude sound of earth shall break The dim quiet, evermore; But the winds and waves shall chant A requiem on the lonely shore. Flitting through the laurel's gloom, The humming-bird shall wander by, Winnowing the floral bloom From cups of wreathÃ¨d ivory. The bee shall wind his fairy horn, Faintly murmuring on the ear; Sounds that seem of silence born Soothe the soul of sadness here; Many a low and mystic word, From the realm of shadows sent, In the busy throng unheard, Make the silence eloquent: Words of sweetest promise, spoken Only where the dirge is sung; Where the golden bowl is broken, And the silver chord unstrung. Faith shall, with uplifted eye, All the solitude illume; Hope and Memory shall sit, Shining seraphs, by the tomb. A DAY OF THE INDIAN SUMMER. âYet one more smile, departing distant sun, Ere o'er the frozen earth the loud winds run, And snows are sifted o'er the meadows bare.ââ Bryant. A day of golden beauty! Through the night The hoar-frost gathered, o'er each leaf and spray Weaving its filmy net-work; thin and bright, And shimmering like silver in the ray Of the soft, sunny morning; turf and tree Pranct in its delicate embroidery, And every withered stump and mossy stone, With gems incrusted and with seed-pearl sown; While in the hedge the frosted berries glow, The scarlet holly and the purple sloe, And all is gorgeous, fairy-like, and frail As the famed gardens of the Arabian tale. How soft and still the autumnal landscape lies, Calmly outspread beneath the smiling skies; As if the earth, in prodigal array Of gems and broidered robes, kept holiday, Her harvest yielded and her work all done, Basking in beauty 'neath the Autumn sun! Yet once more, through the soft and balmy day, Up the brown hill-side, by the woodland way, Far let us rove, through dreamy solitudes Where âAutumn's smile beams through the yellow woods,â Fondly retracing each sweet summer haunt And sylvan pathway; where the sunbeams slant Through yonder copse, kindling the yellow stars Of the witch-hazel with their golden bars; Or, lingering down this dim and shadowy lane, Where still the damp sod wears an emerald stain, Though ripe brown nuts hang clustering in the hedge, And the rude barberry, o'er yon rocky ledge, Droops with its pendant corals. When the showers Of April clothed this winding path with flowers, Here oft we sought the violet, as it lay Buried in beds of moss and lichens gray; And still the aster greets us, as we pass, With her faint smile,âamong the withered grass Beside the way, lingering as loath of heart, Like me, from these sweet solitudes to part. Now seek we the dank borders of the stream, Where the tall fern-tufts shed a tawny gleam Over the water from their saffron plumes; And, clustering near, the modest gentian blooms Lonely around, hallowed by sweetest song, The last and loveliest of the floral throng. Yet here we may not linger, for behold Where the stream widens, like a sea of gold Outspreading far before us! All around Steep, wooded heights and sloping uplands bound The sheltered scene; along the distant shore, Through colored woods, the glinting sunbeams pour, Touching their foliage with a thousand shades And hues of beauty, as the red light fades Beneath the shadow of a fleecy shroud, Or, through the rifted silver of the cloud, Pours down a brighter gleam. Gray willows lave Their pendant branches in the crystal wave, And slender birch-trees o'er its banks incline, Whose tall, slight stems across the water shine Like shafts of silver; there the tawny elm,â The fairest subject of the sylvan realm,â The tufted pine-tree, and the cedar dark, And the young chestnut, its smooth, polished bark Gleaming like porphyry in the yellow light; The dark brown oak and the rich maple, dight In robes of scarlet,âall are standing there, So still, so calm, in the soft, misty air, That not a leaf is stirring; not a sound Startles the deep repose that broods around, Save when the robin's melancholy song Is heard amid the coppice, and along The sunny side of yonder moss-grown wall That skirts our path the cricket's chirping call, Or the fond murmur of the drowsy bee O'er some lone floweret on the sunny lea, And, heard at intervals, a pattering sound Of ripened acorns rustling to the ground Through the crisp, withered leaves. How lonely all, How calmly beautiful! Long shadows fall More darkly o'er the wave as day declines, Yet from the west a deeper glory shines; While every crested hill and rocky height Each moment varies in the kindling light To some new form of beauty, changing through All shades and colors of the rainbow's hue, The last still loveliest, till the gorgeous day Melts in a flood of golden light away; And all is o'er. Before to-morrow's sun Cold winds may rise, and shrouding shadows dun Obscure the scene; yet shall these fading hues And fleeting forms their loveliness transfuse Into the mind, and memory shall burn The painting in on her enameled urn In undecaying colors. When the blast Hurtles around and snows are gathering fast, When musing sadly by the twilight hearth, Or lonely wandering through life's crowded path, Its quiet beauty, rising through the gloom, Shall soothe the languid spirits and illume The drooping fancy,âwinning back the soul To cheerful thoughts through Nature's sweet control. A NOVEMBER LANDSCAPE. How like a rich and gorgeous picture hung In memory's storied hall seems that fair scene O'er which long years their mellowing tints have flung! The way-side flowers had faded one by one, Hoar were the hills, the meadows drear and dun, When homeward wending, 'neath the dusky screen Of the autumnal woods, at close of day, As o'er a pine-clad height my pathway lay, Lo! at a sudden turn, the vale below Lay far outspread, all flushed with purple light; Gray rocks and umbered woods gave back the glow Of the last day-beams, fading into night; While down a glen where dark Moshassuck flows, With all its kindling lamps the distant city rose. A HOLLOW OF THE HILLS. In the soft gloom of Summer's balmy eve, When from the lingering glances of the Sun The sad Earth turns away her blushing cheek, Mantling its glow in twilight's shadowy veil, Oft 'mid the falling dews I love to stray Onward and onward, through the pleasant fields, Far up the lilied borders of the stream, To this green, silent hollow of the hills, Endeared by thronging memories of the past. Oft have I lingered on this rustic bridge, To view the limpid waters winding on Under dim-vaulted woods, whose woven boughs Of beech and maple and broad sycamore Throw their soft, moving shadows o'er the wave; While blossomed vines, dropped to the water's brim, Hang idly swaying in the summer wind. The birds that wander through the twilight heaven Are mirrored far beneath me; and young leaves That tremble on the birch-tree's silver boughs, In the cool wave reflected, gleam below, Like twinkling stars athwart the verdant gloom. A sound of rippling waters rises sweet Amid the silence; and the western breeze, Sighing through sedges and low meadow-blooms, Comes wafting gentle thoughts from Memory's land, And wakes the long-hushed music of the heart. Oft dewy spring hath brimmed the brook with showers; Oft hath the long, bright summer fringed its banks With breathing blossoms; and the autumn sun Shed mellow hues o'er all its wooded shores, Since first I trod these paths, in youth's sweet prime, With loved ones whom Time's desolating wave Hath wafted now forever from my side. Long years have passed, and on its flowery brink, Bereft and sorrow-taught, alone I stand, Listening the hollow music of the wind. Aloneâalone: the stars are far away, And wild clouds wander o'er the face of heaven; But still the green earth wears her summer crown, And whispers hope through all her breathing flowers. Not all in vain the vision of our youth, The apocalypse of beauty and of love, The stag-like heart of hope. Life's mystic dream The soul shall yet interpret; to our prayer The Isis veil be lifted. Though we pine E'en 'mid the ungathered roses of our youth, Pierced with strange pangs and longings infinite, As if earth's fairest flowers served but to wake Sad, haunting memories of our Eden home; Not all in vain. Meantime, in patient trust, Rest we on Nature's bosom: from her eye, Serene and still, drinking in faith and love; To her calm pulse attempering the heart That throbs too wildly for ideal bliss. Oh gentle Mother, heal me, for I faint Upon life's arid pathway; or apart, On lonely mountain heights, oft hear a voice Tempting my agony with perilous thoughts Of death's calm, dreamless slumber; and my feet On the dark mountains stumble. Near thy heart, Close nestling, let me lie; and let thy breath, Fragrant and cool, fall on my fever'd cheek, As in those unworn ages ere pale thought Forestalled life's patient harvest. Give me strength To follow wheresoe'er o'er the world's waste The cloudy pillar moveth; till at last It guide to pleasant vales and pastures green By the still waters of eternal life. To ? Thine is the hope that knows no fear, The patient heart and true; Whose wrongs but make the right more dear, Whose love no loss may rue. Sometimes a soft and sad surprise,â A pitying angel, passion free,â Looks earthward, from thy tender eyes, Upon our frail humanity. Thy calm brow speaks a nature true, A marble constancy of soul, A heart that can its dreams subdue To wisdom's passionless control. Thine eye hath the serenity By Raphael to the Virgin given, And from its blue benignity Looks out the holy light of heaven. MORNING AFTER A STORM. The wan and melancholy stars Are fading with the fading gloom, And, through the Orient's cloudy bars, I see the rose of morning bloom. All flushed, and fairer for the storm, It opens on our vernal skies, Divinely beautiful and warm, As on the hills of Paradise. And on its breast a shining spark, Like a bright drop of morning dew, Lies glittering on the rosy dark, Then melts and mingles with the blue. Sweet morning-star! thy silver beams, Foretell a fairer life to come; Arouse the sleeper from his dreams And call the wandering spirit home. My soul, ascending like a lark, Would follow on thine airy flight; And like yon little diamond spark, Dissolve into the realms of light. TO E. O. S. âEos, fair Goddess of the Morn! whose eyes Drive back Night's wandering ghosts.ââ Horne's Orion. When issuing from the realms of âShadow Landâ I see thee mid the Orient's kindling bloom, With mystic lilies gleaming in thy hand, Gathered by dream-light in the dusk gloom Of bowers enchantedâI behold again The fabled Goddess of the Morning veiled In fleecy clouds. Thy cheek, so softly paled With memories of the Night's mysterious reign, And something of the star-light, burning still In thy deep, dreamy eyes, do but fulfill The vision more divinely to my thought: While all the cheerful hopes enkindling round theeâ Warm hopes, wherewith thy prescient soul hath crowned theeâ Are with the breath of morning fragrance fraught. SHE BLOOMS NO MORE. âOh primavera, gioventu dell' anno, Bella madre di fiori, Tu torni ben, ma teco Non tornani i sereni E fortunati di delle mi gioge.ââ Guarini. I dread to see the summer sun Come glowing up the sky, And early pansies, one by one, Opening the violet eye. Again the fair azalea bows Beneath her snowy crest; In yonder hedge the hawthorn blows, The robin builds her nest; The tulips lift their proud tiÃ s, The lilac waves her plumes; And, peeping through my lattice-bars, The rose-acacia blooms. But she can bloom on earth no more, Whose early doom I mourn; Nor spring nor summer can restore Our flower, untimely shorn. She was our morning-glory, Our primrose, pure and pale, Our little mountain daisy, Our lily of the vale. Now dim as folded violets, Her eyes of dewy light; And her rosy lips have mournfully Breathed out their last good-night. 'T is therefore that I dread to see The glowing summer sun; And the balmy blossoms on the tree, Unfolding one by one. THE PAST. âSo fern, und doch so nah.ââ Goethe. Thick darkness broodeth o'er the world: The raven pinions of the Night, Close on her silent bosom furled, Reflect no gleam of Orient light. E'en the wild Norland fires that mocked The faint bloom of the eastern sky, Now leave me, in close darkness locked, To-night's weird realm of fantasy. Borne from pale shadow-lands remote, A morphean music, wildly sweet, Seems, on the starless gloom, to float, Like the white-pinioned Paraclete. Softly into my dream it flows, Then faints into the silence drear; While from the hollow dark outgrows The phantom Past, pale gliding near. The visioned Past; so strangely fair! So veiled in shadowy, soft regrets. So steeped in sadness, like the air That lingers when the day-star sets! Ah! could I fold it to my heart, On its cold lip my kisses press, This waste of aching life impart, To win it back from nothingness! I loathe the purple light of day, And shun the morning's golden star, Beside that shadowy form to stray, Forever near, yet oh how far! Thin as a cloud of summer even, All beauty from my gaze it bars; Shuts out the silver cope of heaven, And glooms athwart the dying stars. Cold, sad, and spectral, by my side, It breathes of love's ethereal bloom,â Of bridal memories, long affied To the dread silence of the tomb: Sweet, cloistered memories, that the heart Shuts close within its chalice cold; Faint perfumes, that no more dispart From the bruised lily's floral fold. âMy soul is weary of her life;â My heart sinks with a slow despair; The solemn, star-lit hours are rife With fantasy; the noontide glare, And the cool morning, fancy free, Are false with shadows; for the day Brings no blithe sense of verity, Nor wins from twilight thoughts away. Oh, bathe me in the Lethean stream, And feed me on the lotus flowers; Shut out this false, bewildering dream, This memory of departed hours! Sweet haunting dream! so strangely fairâ So veiled in shadowy, soft regretsâ So steeped in sadness, like the air That lingers when the day-star sets! The Future can no charm confer, My heart's deep solitudes to break; No angel's foot again shall stir The waters of that silent lake. I wander in pale dreams away, And shun the morning's golden star, To follow still that failing ray, Forever near, yet oh how far! Feb. 1846. âTHE RAVEN.â Raven, from the dim dominions On the Night's Plutonian shore, Oft I hear thy dusky pinions Wave and flutter round my doorâ See the shadow of thy pinions Float along the moon-lit floor; Often, from the oak-woods glooming Round some dim ancestral tower, In the lurid distance loomingâ Some high solitary towerâ I can hear thy storm-cry booming Through the lonely midnight hour. When the moon is at the zenith, Thou dost haunt the moated hall, Where the marish flower greeneth O'er the waters, like a pallâ Where the House of Usher leaneth, Darkly nodding to its fall: There I see thee, dimly gliding,â See thy black plumes waving slow,â In its hollow casements hiding, When their shadow yawns below, To the sullen tarn confiding The dark secrets of their woe:â See thee, when the stars are burning In their cressets, silver clear,â When Ligeia's spirit yearning For the earth-life, wanders near,â When Morella's soul returning, Weirdly whispers âI am here.â Once, within a realm enchanted, On a far isle of the seas, By unearthly visions haunted, By unearthly melodies, Where the evening sunlight slanted Golden through the garden trees,â Where the dreamy moonlight dozes, Where the early violets dwell, Listening to the silver closes Of a lyric loved too well, Suddenly, among the roses, Like a cloud, thy shadow fell. Once, where Ulalume lies sleeping, Hard by Auber's haunted mere, With the ghouls a vigil keeping, On that night of all the year, Came thy sounding pinions, sweeping Through the leafless woods of Weir! Oft, with Proserpine I wander On the Night's Plutonian shore, Hoping, fearing, while I ponder On thy loved and lost Lenoreâ On the demon doubts that sunder Soul from soul for evermore; Trusting, though with sorrow laden, That when life's dark dream is o'er, By whatever name the maiden Lives within thy mystic lore, Eiros, in that distant Aidenn, Shall his Charmion meet once more. REMEMBERED MUSIC. Oh, lonely heart! why do thy pulses beat To the hushed music of a voice so dear, That all sweet, mournful cadences repeat Its low, bewildering accents to thine ear. Why dost thou question the pale stars to know If that rich music floats upon the air, In those far realms where, else, their fires would glow Forever beautiful to thy despair? Trust thou in God; for, far within the veil, Where glad hosannas through the empyrean roll, And choral anthems of the angel's hail With hallelujah's sweet the enfranchised soul,â The voice that sang earth's sorrow through earth's night, Shall with glad seraphs sing, in God's great light. OUR ISLAND OF DREAMS. âBy the foam Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn.ââ Keats. Tell him I lingered alone on the shore, Where we parted, in sorrow, to meet never more; The night wind blew cold on my desolate heart, But colder those wild words of doom, âYe must part?â O'er the dark, heaving waters, I sent forth a cry; Save the wail of those waters there came no reply. I longed, like a bird, o'er the billows to flee, From our lone island home and the moan of the sea: Awayâfar awayâfrom the wild ocean shore, Where the waves ever murmur, âNo more, never more;â Where I wake, in the wild noon of midnight, to hear That lone song of the surges, so mournful and drear. When the clouds that now veil from us heaven's fair light, Their soft, silver lining turn forth on the night; When time shall the vapors of falsehood dispel, He shall know if I loved him; but never how well. 1849. THE LAST FLOWERS. âThe undying voice of that dead time, With its interminable chime, Rings on my spirit like a knell.â Dost thou remember that Autumnal day When by the Seekonk's lonely wave we stood, And marked the languor of repose that lay, Softer than sleep, on valley, wave, and wood? A trance of holy sadness seemed to lull The charmÃ¨d earth and circumambient air, And the low murmur of the leaves seemed full Of a resigned and passionless despair. Though the warm breath of summer lingered still In the lone paths where late her footsteps passed, The pallid star-flowers on the purple hill Sighed dreamily, âWe are the last! the last!â I stood beside thee, and a dream of heaven Around me like a golden halo fell! Then the bright veil of fantasy was riven, And my lips murmured, âFare thee well!âfarewell!â I dared not listen to thy words, nor turn To meet the mystic language of thine eyes, I only felt their power, and in the urn Of memory, treasured their sweet rhapsodies. We parted then, forever,âand the hours Of that bright day were gathered to the past,â But, through long wintry nights, I heard the flowers Sigh dreamily, âWe are the last!âthe last!â September, 1849. SONG. I bade thee stay. Too well I know The fault was mine,âmine only: I dared not think upon the past, All desolate and lonely. I feared in memory's silent air Too sadly to regret thee,â Feared in the night of my despair I could not all forget thee. Yet go,âah, go! those pleading eyes, Those low, sweet tones, appealing From heart to heart,âah, dare I trust That passionate revealing? For ah, those dark and pleading eyes Evoke too keen a sorrow,â A pang that will not pass away, With thy wild vows, to-morrow. A love immortal and divine Within my heart is waking: Its dream of anguish and despair It owns not but in breaking. WITHERED FLOWERS. Remembrancers of happiness! to me Ye bring sweet thoughts of the year's purple prime, Wild, mingling melodies of bird and bee, That pour on summer winds their silvery chime Of balmy incense, burdening all the air, From flowers that by the sunny garden wall Bloomed at your side, nursed into beauty there By dews and silent showers: but these to all Ye bring. Oh! sweeter far than these the spell Shrined in those fairy urns for me alone; For me a charm sleeps in each honeyed cell, Whose power can call back hours of rapture flown, To the sad heart sweet memories restore, Tones, looks, and words of love that may return no more. THE PHANTOM VOICE. âIt is a phantom voice: Again!âagain! how solemnly it falls Into my heart of hearts!â Scenes from Politian. Through the solemn hush of midnight, How sadly on my ear Falls the echo of a harp whose tones I never more may hear! A wild, unearthly melody, Whose monotone doth move The saddest, sweetest cadences Of sorrow and of love: Till the burden of remembrance weighs Like lead upon my heart, And the shadow, on my soul that sleeps, Will never more depart. The ghastly moonlight, gliding Like a phantom through the gloom, How it fills with solemn fantasies My solitary room! And the sighing winds of Autumn, Ah! how sadly they repeat That low, bewildering melody, So mystically sweet! I hear it softly murmuring At midnight o'er the hill, Or across the wide savannas, When all beside is still. I hear it in the moaning Of the melancholy main; In the rushing of the night-wind, The rhythm of the rain. E'en the wild-flowers of the forest, Waving sadly to and fro, But whisper to my boding heart The burden of its woe. And the spectral moon, now paling And fading, seems to say, âI leave thee to remembrances That will not pass away.â Ah, through all the solemn midnight, How mournful 't is to hark To the voices of the silence, The whisper of the dark! In vain I turn, some solace From the distant stars to crave: They are shining on thy sepulchre, Are smiling on thy grave. How I weary of their splendor! All night long they seem to say, âWe are lonely,âsad and lonely,â Far away,âfar, far away!â Thus, through all the solemn midnight, That phantom voice I hear, As it echoes through the silence, When no earthly sound is near. And though dawn-light yields to noonlight, And though darkness turns to day, They but leave me to remembrances That will not pass away. November, 1849. ARCTURUS. WRITTEN IN OCTOBER. âOur star looks through the storm.â Star of resplendent front! thy glorious eye Shines on me still from out yon clouded sky,â Shines on me through the horrors of a night More drear than ever fell o'er day so bright,â Shines till the envious Serpent slinks away, And pales and trembles at thy steadfast ray. Hast thou not stooped from heaven, fair star! to be So near me in this hour of agony?â So near,âso bright,âso glorious, that I seem To lie entranced as in some wondrous dream,â All earthly joys forgot,âall earthly fear, Purged in the light of thy resplendent sphere: Kindling within my soul a pure desire To blend with thine its incandescent fire,â To lose my very life in thine, and be Soul of thy soul through all eternity. 1849. RESURGEMUS. I mourn thee not: no words can tell The solemn calm that tranced my breast When first I knew thy soul had past From earth to its eternal rest; For doubt and darkness, o'er thy head, Forever waved their Condor wings; And in their murky shadows bred Forms of unutterable things; And all around thy silent hearth, The glory that once blushed and bloomed Was but a dim-remembered dream Of âthe old time entombed.â Those melancholy eyes that seemed To look beyond all time, or, turned On eyes they loved, so softly beamed,â How few their mystic language learned. How few could read their depths, or know The proud, high heart that dwelt alone In gorgeous palaces of woe, Like Eblis on his burning throne. For ah! no human heart could brook The darkness of thy doom to share, And not a living eye could look Unscathed upon thy dread despair. I mourn thee not: life had no lore Thy soul in morphean dews to steep, Love's lost nepenthe to restore, Or bid the avenging sorrow sleep. Yet, while the night of life shall last, While the slow stars above me roll, In the heart's solitudes I keep A solemn vigil for thy soul. I tread dim cloistral aisles, where all Beneath are solemn-sounding graves; While o'er the oriel, like a pall, A dark, funereal shadow waves. There, kneeling by a lampless shrine, Alone amid a place of tombs, My erring spirit pleads for thine Till light along the Orient blooms. Oh, when thy faults are all forgiven, The vigil of my life outwrought, In some calm altitude of heaven,â The dream of thy prophetic thought,â Forever near thee, soul in soul, Near thee forever, yet how far, May our lives reach love's perfect goal In the high order of thy star! SONNETS. I. TO ?. Vainly my heart had with thy sorceries striven: It had no refuge from thy love,âno Heaven But in thy fatal presence;âfrom afar It owned thy power and trembled like a star O'erfraught with light and splendor. Could I deem How dark a shadow should obscure its beam?â Could I believe that pain could ever dwell Where thy bright presence cast its blissful spell? Thou wert my proud palladium;âcould I fear The avenging Destinies when thou wert near?â Thou wert my Destiny;âthy song, thy fame, The wild enchantments clustering round thy name, Were my soul's heritage, its royal dower; Its glory and its kingdom and its power! [II. When first I looked into thy glorious eyes] When first I looked into thy glorious eyes, And saw, with their unearthly beauty pained, Heaven deepening within heaven, like the skies Of autumn nights without a shadow stained, I stood as one whom some strange dream enthralls; For, far away, in some lost life divine, Some land which every glorious dream recalls, A spirit looked on me with eyes like thine. E'en now, though death has veiled their starry light, And closed their lids in his relentless nightâ As some strange dream, remembered in a dream, Again I see, in sleep, their tender beam; Unfading hopes their cloudless azure fill, Heaven deepening within heaven, serene and still. [III. Oft since thine earthly eyes have closed on mine] Oft since thine earthly eyes have closed on mine, Our souls, dim-wandering in the hall of dreams, Hold mystic converse on the life divine, By the still music of immortal streams; And oft thy spirit tells how souls, affied By sovran destinies, no more can part,â How death and hell are powerless to divide Souls whose deep lives lie folded heart in heart. And if, at times, some lingering shadow lies Heavy upon my path, some haunting dread, Then do I point thee to the harmonies Of those calm heights whereto our souls arise Through suffering,âthe faith that doth approve In death the deathless power and divine life of love. [IV. We met beneath September's gorgeous beams] We met beneath September's gorgeous beams: Long in my house of life thy star had reigned; Its mournful splendor trembled through my dreams, Nor with the night's phantasmal glories waned. We wandered thoughtfully o'er golden meads To a lone woodland, lit by starry flowers, Where a wild, solitary pathway leads Through mouldering sepulchres and cypress bowers. A dreamy sadness filled the autumnal air;â By a low, nameless grave I stood beside thee, My heart according to thy murmured prayer The full, sweet answers that my lips denied thee. O mournful faith, on that dread altar sealedâ Sad dawn of love in realms of death revealed! [V. On our lone pathway bloomed no earthly hopes] On our lone pathway bloomed no earthly hopes;â Sorrow and death were near us, as we stood Where the dim forest, from the upland slopes, Swept darkly to the sea. The enchanted wood Thrilled, as by some foreboding terror stirred; And as the waves broke on the lonely shore, In their low monotone, methought I heard A solemn voice that sighed, âYe meet no more.â There, while the level sunbeams seemed to burn Through the long aisles of red, autumnal gloom,â Where stately, storied cenotaphs inurn Sweet human hopes, too fair on Earth to bloom,â Was the bud reaped, whose petals, pure and cold, Sleep on my heart till Heaven the flower unfold. [VI. If thy sad heart, pining for human love] If thy sad heart, pining for human love, In its earth solitude grew dark with fear, Lest the high Sun of Heaven itself should prove Powerless to save from that phantasmal sphere Wherein thy spirit wanderedâif the flowers That pressed around thy feet, seemed but to bloom In lone Gethsemanes, through starless hours, When all, who loved, had left thee to thy doom:â Oh, yet believe, that, in that hollow vale, Where thy soul lingers, waiting to attain So much of Heaven's sweet grace as shall avail To lift its burden of remorseful pain,â My soul shall meet thee and its Heaven forego Till God's great love, on both, one hope, one Heaven bestow. ARCTURUS. WRITTEN IN APRIL. âNec morti esse locum, sed viva volare Sideris in numerum atque alto succedere cÅlo.â Virgil, Geor., IV. Again, imperial star! thy mystic beams Pour their wild splendors on my waking dreams, Piercing the blue depths of the vernal night With opal shafts and flames of ruby light; Filling the air with melodies, that come Mournful and sweet, from the dark, sapphire dome,â Weird sounds, that make the cheek with wonder pale, As their wild symphonies o'ersweep the gale. For, in that gorgeous world, I fondly deem, Dwells the freed soul of one whose earthly dream Was full of beauty, majesty and wo; One who, in that pure realm of thine, doth grow Into a power serene,âa solemn joy, Undimmed by earthly sorrow or alloy; Sphered far above the dread, phantasmal gloom,â The penal tortures of that living tomb Wherein his earth-life languished;âwho shall tell The drear enchantments of that Dantean hell! âWas it not Fate, whose earthly name in Sorrow,â That bade him, with prophetic soul, to borrow From all the stars that fleck night's purple dome, Thee, bright Arcturus! for his Eden home:â Was it not Fate, whose name in Heaven above, Is Truth and Goodness and unchanging Love,â Was it not Fate, that bade him turn to thee As the bright regent of his destiny?â For when thine orb passed from the lengthening gloom Of autumn nights, a morning-star to bloom Beside Aurora's eastern gates of pearl, He passed from earth, his weary wings to furl In the cool vales of Heaven: thence, through yon sea Of starry isles, to hold his course to thee. Now, when in April's cloudless nights, I turn To where thy pharos mid the stars doth burn,â A glorious cynosure,âI read in thee The rune of Virgil's golden augury; For there is no place of annihilation: but alive they mount up each into his own order of star, and take their high seat in the heavens.â Georgics, Book IV. And deem that o'er thy seas of silver calm Floats the far perfume of the Eden palm. April, 1850. TO THE MORNING-STAR. âFair crescent star, upborne on waves of light,â Bud of the morning, that must fade so soon.â Dalgoni. Sweet Phosphor! star of Love and Hope, Again I see thy silver horn Rise o'er the dark and dewy slope Of yonder hills that hide the morn. All night the glooming shadows lay So thick on valley, wave, and wold, I scarce could deem the buried day Would ever pierce their shrouding fold: Yet, even now, a line of light Comes slowly surging o'er the dark; And lo! thy crescent, floating bright And buoyant as a fairy bark. But ah, the solemn stars of night,â The distant stars that long have set,â How can I, in thy nearer light Of love and hope, their smile forget?â The stars that trembled through my dream, That spoke in accents faint and far, Can I forget their pensive beam, For thine, my radiant morning-star? No dawn-light in my soul can wake One hope to make the world more fair; No noon-tide ray illume the lake Of dark remembrance, brooding there; But Night comes down the paling west, With mystic glories on her brow:â She lays her cold hand on my breast, And bids, for me, the lotus blow: She bears me on her Lethean tides To lands by living waters fed: She lifts the cloudy veil that hides The dim campagnas of the dead. Down the long corridor of dreams, She leads me silently away; Till, through its shadowy portal, streams The dawn of that diviner Day! 1850.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HOURS OF LIFE. MORNING. âTemp' era dal principio del matino E'l sol montava in su con quelle stelle Ch'eran con lui quando l'Amor divino Mosse da prima quelle cose belle; Si cha bene sperir mera cagione L'ora del tempo e la dolce stagione.â Dante. Ere youth with its auroral blooms Dispels the tender twilight glooms Of Infancy, while yet it lies Close to the gates of Paradise, No fears the guileless bosom thrill; The little stranger slumbers still, O'ershadowed by the silent wings Of angels, till the morning brings Music and perfume, and around him flings Her rosy mist-wreaths, drooping warm and low, And prints her fragrant kisses on his brow. Startled from out that dreamless rest, Through mist-wreaths, drooping warm and low, I saw her faint smile in the east, I felt her kisses on my brow. From the high meadows, dewy-sweet, Fair Eos with her silver feet Chased the shadows as they crept Under woodland boughs away, Or down the airy uplands swept Into hollows cool and gray, Till her full refulgence, bright As a perfect chrysolite, Filled the solemn dome of Night! With a sweet, indolent surprise, Undimmed by haunting memories, I saw the gradual glory rise. Divinely calm and fancy-free Were those morning hours to me; I recked not of the bitter root That bears the paradisal fruit; I knew not that the serpent brood Lurked in that Aidenn solitude; For childhood kept inviolate The tenure of its fair estate, Lulled in a murmurous monotone, As when bees in violets drone. Till gently as the spring-time showers Wake the rose-buds into flowers, Nature wrought her spells to lure The child-heart from its clear-obscure, Dazzling the bewildered sense With dÃ¦dalian opulence, ProtÃ©an visions, sweet and strange, And swift and subtle interchange Of light with shadow, too intense For the sweet calm of innocence: Soon like the pure and priceless pearl In Egypt's festal goblet tossed, It vanished in the dizzy whirl Of life's bewildering pleasures lost. Wild hopes came fluttering round my heart And swept its folded leaves apart, As underneath those cloudless skies I wandered with my Destinies, Nor sought to read their silent eyes. Thoughts for pain too dearâtoo deep For pleasureâcaused the heart to weep Tears that, steeped in fragrance, fell Like dew-drops from the lily's bell. Dream followed dream: and still the day Floated on golden wings away. Then, while each little woodland bird One sweet note forever sung, My heart on one bewildering word Its wealth of morning music flung: All the glory and the gloomâ All the passion and the powerâ All the mystic bale and bloom Of its high imperial dower. Like the sole phÅnix in his perfumed nest, Love reigned within my heart a sovran guest,â Reigned in my heart of heartsâthe thronÃ¨d lord Of its young life, unquestioned and adored; Folding its fragrant altar-gifts in flame That made the summer heavens look wan and pale, Forestalling life's fair heritage and claim On earthly hope till hope waxed cold and stale, Bankrupt and blighted with the fond excess Of a too rare and costly happiness, A flame that earth's calm joys too proudly spurned, And left but ashes where its altars burned. Yet, like the fabled Greek, superbly bold, Who on Jove's awful countenance would gaze, Pining immortal beauty to behold, Consumed beneath the lightning of its rays, My conscious heart a willing fate had sought, Undaunted by the pangs its triumphs bought; Content love's mortal penalties to share, And, for a dream so sweet, a dreadless doom to dare. I trod o'er meads of asphodel, I walked the hall of dreams, And gathered sweeter flowers than fell By Enna's fabled streams. Every wind of morning bore Music from some haunted shore, Some fairy island o'er the seas, Insphered in Orient fantasies. Every cloud that floated by Veiled beneath its silver wing Missives from a world more fair Than the Poet's dream of spring. I sought the holy wells of song Love's wild enchantments to prolong, And walked as in a waking trance The wonder-land of old romance. Sometimes to a triumph march Throbbed the life-pulse, warm and high; Sometimes tolled in silver time To a haunting melody, Like a holy matin bell Chiming in a far chapelle: Now trembling to a cadence sweet As the clear and silver beat Of fairy footsteps, or the fall Of fountains in a marble hall; Now as to an echoing horn, Far through moonlit forests borne, Sad and rhythmically slow, Moved to grand adagio. Dream followed dream: the horizon lay A line of silver far away; The trees soared far into the blue, The rose-cups dripped with morning dew, And still the level life-path wound Away, away, o'er flowery ground. NOON. âThe mysterious silence of full noon.â Bailey. Festus. âCombien de fois dans le silence de minuit, et dans cet autre silence de midi, si accablant, si inquiet, si dÃ©vorant, n'ai-je pas senti mon cÅur se prÃ©cipiter vers un but inconnu, vers un onhbeur sans forme et sans nom, qui est au ciel, qui est dans l'air, qui est partout, comme l'amour! C'est l'aspiration sainte de la partie la plus Ã©thÃ©rÃ©e de notre ame vers l'inconnu.â George Sand Dream followed dream; and still the day Floated on golden wings away; But in the hush of the high noon, Touched by a sorrow without name, Consumed by a slow fever-flame, I loathed my life's mysterious boon, Unconscious of its end or aim; Lost in a languor of repose,â A luxury of gloom,â As when the curved, voluptuous rose Droops with its wealth of bloom. Decked as for a festival Seemed the wide and lonely hall Of Nature, but a mute despair Filled the universal air;â A sense of loneliness and void,â A wealth of beauty unenjoyed,â A sadness born mid the excess Of life's unvalued loveliness. Every pulse of being panting With a bliss it fain would share, Still there seemed a presence wanting, Still some lost ideal haunting All the lone and lustrous air. Far off I heard the solemn chimes Of life and Death,â The rhythm of ancestral rhymes Above,âbeneath! âLight in shadow ever fading,â Death on Life's bright realm invading,â Pain with pleasure keeping measure,â Wasting care with golden treasure. So the ancient burden rang, So the choral voices sang. Though beautiful on all the hills The summer noonlight lay, Far in the west a single cloud Lay folded like a fleecy shroud, Ready to veil its ray. And over all a purple pall Seemed waiting for the day. I heard far, phantom voices calling Over all the flowery wold,â O'er the westering meadows falling Into slopes of gleamy gold;â Still I heard them calling,âcalling,â Through the dim, entangled glooms,â Far through sunless valleys falling Downward to a place of tombs. Near me pressed a vassal throng, Slaves to custom, serfs to wrongâ Hollow-hearted, vain and cold, Minions of the earthly mold; Holding in supreme derision Memories of the life Elysian, Reckless of the birthright lost, Heedless of the heavenly host, Traitors to the Holy Ghost! Haunted by a nameless terror,â Thrilled by a foreboding breath, As the aspen wildly trembles When the winds are still as death,â I sought amid the sadness drear Some loved familiar face to cheer The solitude,âsome lingering tone Of love Ã©re love and hope had flown. I heard a low voice breathe my name: Was it the echo of my own,â That weird and melancholy tone,â That voice whose subtle sweetness came Keen as the serpent's tongue of flame? So near, its music seemed to me The music of my heart to be. Still I heard it, nearer, clearer, When all other songs had flown, Floating round me till it bound me In a wild world of its own. Suddenly a chill wind leapt Through its woven harmonies; All its silver chords were snapt As a wind-harp's by the breeze. A shudder through the silence crept And death athwart the noonlight swept. Then came the pall, the dirge, the knell, As, dust to dust, the earth-clods fell, Down crumbling on a coffin lid, Within whose narrow casket hid,â Shut from the cheerful light of day,â Buried, yet quick, my own heart lay. Graves closed round my path of life, The beautiful had fled; Pale shadows wandered by my side, And whispered of the dead. The far off hollow of the sky Seemed like an idle mockery.â The vaulted hollow of the sky, With its blue depths of mystery But rounded Death's vast empery. O'erwearied with life's restless change From ecstacy to agony, Its fleeting pleasures born to die, The mirage of its fantasy, Its worn and melancholy range Of hopes that could no more estrange The married heart of memory, Doomed, while we drain life's perfumed wine, For the dull Lethean wave to pine, And, for each thrill of joy, to know Despair's slow pulse or sorrow's throe,â I sought some central truth to span These wide extremes of good and ill,â I longed with one bold glance to scan Life's perfect sphere, to rend at will The gloom of Erebus,âdread zone, Coiled like a serpent round the throne Of Heaven,âthe realm where Justice veils Her heart and holds her even scales,â Where awful Nemesis awaits The doomed, by Pluto's iron gates. In the long noon-tide of my sorrow, I questioned of the eternal morrow; I gazed in sullen awe Far through the illimitable gloom Down-deepening like the swift maelstrom, The doubting soul to draw Into eternal solitudes, Where unrelenting silence broods Around the throne of Law. I questioned the dim chronicle Of ages gone before,â I listened for the triumph songs That rang from shore to shore, Where the heroes and the conquerors wrought The mighty deeds of yore,â Where the foot-prints of the martyrs Had bathed the earth in gore, And the war-horns of the warriors Where heard from shore to shore. Their blood on desert plains was shed,â Their voices on the wind had fled,â They were the drear and shadowy Dead! Still, through the storied past, I sought An answer to my sleepless thought; In the cloisters old and hoary Of the mediÃ¦val timeâ In the rude ancestral story Of the ancient Runic rhyme. I paused on Grecian plains, to trace Some remnant of a mightier race, Serene in sorrow and in strife, Calm conquerors of Death and Life, Types of the god-like forms that shone Upon the sculptured Parthenon. But still, as when Prometheus bare From heaven the fiery dart, I saw the âvulture passionsâ tear The proud Caucasian heart, Gustav Klemm, in a work entitled Allgemeine Culturgeschichte der Menschheit, divides the human races into the active and passive: the former (embracing only the so-called Caucasian race) marked by restless activity and aspiration, progress and the spirit of doubt and inquiry; the latter (comprising all the remaining races), by an absence or inferiority of these characteristics.â The war of destiny with will Still conquered, yet conflicting still. I heard loud Hallelujahs From Israel's golden lyre, And I sought their great Jehovah In the cloud and in the fire. I lingered by the stream that flowed âFast by the oracle of God,ââ I bowed, its sacred wave to sip;â Its waters fled my thirsting lip. The serpent trail was over all Its borders,âand its palms that threw Aloft their waving coronal, Were blistered by a poison dew. Serener elements I sought, Sublimer altitudes of thought, The truth Saint John and Plato saw, The mystic light, the inward law; The Logos ever found and lost, The aureola of the Ghost. I hailed its faint auroral beam In many a Poet's Delphic dream,â On many a shrine where faith's pure flame Through fable's gorgeous oriel came. Around the altars of the god, In holy passion hushed, I trod, Where once the mighty voice of Jove Rang through Dodona's haunted grove. No more the dove with sable plumes âThe priestesses of Dodona assert that two black pigeons flew from Thebes in Egypt; one of which settled in Lybia, the other among themselves: which latter, resting on a beech-tree, declared with a human voice that here was to be the oracle of Jove.ââ Herodotus, Book II. ch. 55. Swept through the forest's gorgeous glooms; The shrines were desolate and cold, Their pÃ¦ans hushed, their story told, In long, inglorious silence lost, Like fiery tongues of Pentecost. No more did music's golden surge The mortal in immortal merge: High canticles of joy and praise Died with the dream of other days; I only heard the MÃ¦nad's wail,â That shriek that made the orient pale: Evohe!âahâEvohe! The mystic burden of a woe Whose dark enigma none may know; âThe MÃ¦nads, in their wild incantations, carried serpents in their hands, and with frantic gestures cried out Eva! Eva! Epiphanius thinks that this invocation related to the mother of mankind; but I am inclined to believe that it was the word Epha or Opha, rendered by the Greeks, Ophis, a serpent. I take Abaddon to have been the name of the same ophite God whose worship has so long infected the world. The learned Heinsius makes Abaddon the same as the serpent Python.ââ Jacob Brayant's Analysis of Ancient Mythology. âWhile MÃ¦nads cry aloud Evoe, Evoe! That voice that is contagion to the world.â Shelley's Prometheus. The primal curse,âthe primal throe. Evohe!âahâEvohe! Nature shuddered at the cry Of that ancient agony! Still the fabled Python bound me,â Still the serpent coil inwound me,â Still I heard the MÃ¦nad's cry, Evohe!âahâEvohe! Where the Nile pours his sullen wave Through tombs and empires of the grave, I sought, 'mid cenotaphs, to find The earlier miracles of mind: Alas, beside the funeral urn How drearily the death-lights burn; On dim Denderah's sculptured lore How sad the noonlight falls, How mournfully the west wind sighs Through Karnak's moldering halls! No tongue shall tell their wondrous tale, No hand shall lift the Isis veil; The mighty pyramids that rise So drear along the morning skies, Guard well the secrets of the dead, Nor break the sleep of ages fled. Their awful shadow passed, I stood On India's burning solitude; Where, in the misty morning of the world, Life lay as in a dream of beauty furled. I saw the mighty altars of the Sun,â Before whose fires the star-gods, one by one, Paled like thin ghosts,âin lurid splendors rife; I heard the Persian hail him Lord of Life! I saw his altar-flames rise wild and high, Veiling the glory of the noon-day sky, Hiding the holy heavens with their ensanguined dye. I turned, and from the Brahmin's milder law I sought truth's mystic element to draw, Pure as it sparkled in the cup of Heaven,â The bright Amreeta to the immortals given,â To bathe my soul in fontal springs, that lie Veiled from the careless and incurious eye. Half wakened from the brooding sleep Of Nature ere she felt the leap Of sentient life, the Hindoo seemed Sad as the faith his fathers dreamed; Like his own rock-hewn temples, wrought From some obscure and shadowy thought Of ancient days,âsome formless dread, In the gray dawn of ages bred,â Prone on his native earth reclined, To endless reveries resigned, His dull soul lapsing on the Lethean stream, Lost in the dim world of a lotus dream. Still, still the eternal mystery, The shadow of the poison-tree Of Good and Evil haunted me. In Religion's holy name, Furies fed her altar-flame, Sophists gloried in her shame. Still the ancient mythus bound me, Still the serpent coil inwound me, Still I heard the MÃ¦nad's cry, Evohe!âahâEvohe! Wearied with man's discordant creed, I sought on Nature's page to read Life's history, ere yet she shrined Her essence in the incarnate mind; Intent her secret laws to trace In primal solitudes of space, From her first, faint atomic throes, To where her orbÃ¨d splendor glows In the vast, silent spheres that roll Forever towards their unknown goal. I turned from dull alchemic lore With starry Chaldeans to soar, And sought, on fancy's wing, to roam That glorious galaxy of light Where mingling stars, like drifting foam, Melt on the solemn shores of night; But still the surging glory chased The dark through night's chaotic waste; And still, within its deepening voids, Crumbled the burning asteroids. Long gloating on that hollow gloom, Methought that in some vast maelstrom, The stars were hurrying to their doom,â Bubbles upon life's boundless sea, Swift meteors of eternity, Pale sparks of mystic fire, that fall From God's unwaning coronal. Is there, I asked, a living woe In all those burning orbs that glow Through the blue ether?âdo they share Our dim world's anguish and despair? In their vast orbits do they fly From some avenging destiny,â And shall their wild eyes pale beneath The dread anathema of Death?â Our own fair Earth,âshall she too drift, Forever shrouded in a weft Of stormy clouds, that surge and swirl Around her in her dizzy whirl:â Forever shall a shadow fall Backward from her golden wall, Its dark cone stretching, ghast and gray, Into outer glooms away?â From the sad, unsated quest Of knowledge, how I longed to rest On her green and silent breast! I languished for the dews of death My fevered heart to steep,â The heavy, honey-dews of death, The calm and dreamless sleep. I left my fruitless lore apart, And leaned my ear on Nature's heart, To hear, far from life's busy throng, The chime of her sweet undersong. She pressed her balmy lips to mine, She bathed me in her sylvan springs; And still, by many a rural shrine, She taught me sweet and holy things. I felt her breath my temples fan, I learned her temperate laws to scan, My soul, of hers, became a conscious part; Her beauty melted through my inmost heart. Still I languished for the word Her sweet lips had never spoken, Still, from the pale shadow-land, There came nor voice nor token; No accent of the Holy Ghost Whispered of the loved and lost; No bright wanderer came to tell If, in worlds beyond the grave, Life, love, and beauty dwell. EVENING. âAnd, it shall come to pass, that at evening time it shall be light.â Zechariah xiv. 7. âAll the dawn promised shall the day fulfill, The glory and the grandeur of each dream; And every prophecy shall be achieved, And every joy conceded, prove a pledge Of some new joy to come.â Robert Browning. Wilder and lonelier grew the day: The vault of heaven once so high,â Fading to infinity,â Now bowed by its own weight of gloom, Seemed dark and low-browed as a tomb. Cold, sculptured hills, forlorn and gray, Like sun-forsaken Memnons, lay Around my drear and pathless way. The thunder rolled; and loud and shrill The storm-blast shrieked from hill to hill. Beside the lamp within the veil Of the soul's temple burning pale, I sought, in self-renouncing prayer, Truth's guarded secrets to forbear, Till lowly trust the right should earn Life's golden meanings to discern. I sought in ministries of love The purchase of the Cross to prove,â The mysteries of the Holy Rood In sorrow's pale beatitude. Content, through lowering clouds, to greet The glory of the Paraclete; I sought, within the inner shrine, The Father-God of Palestine. A holy light began to stream Athwart the cloud-rifts, like a dream Of Heaven; and lo! a pale, sweet face, Of mournful grandeur and imperial grace,â A face whose mystic sadness seemed to borrow Immortal beauty from that mortal sorrow Looked on me; and a voice of solemn cheer Uttered its sweet evangels on my ear; The open secrets of that eldest lore That seems less to reveal than to restore. âPluck thou the Life-tree's golden fruit, Nor seek to bare its sacred root: Live, and in life's perennial faith Renounce the heresy of death: Believe, and every sweet accord Of being, to thine ear restored, Shall sound articulate and clear; Perfected love shall banish fear, Knowledge and wisdom shall approve The divine synthesis of love.â âRoyally the lilies grow On the grassy leas, Basking in the sun and dew, Swinging in the breeze. Doth the wild-fowl need a chart Through the illimitable air? Heaven lies folded in thy heart; Seek the truth that slumbers there; Thou art Truth's eternal heir.â âLet the shadows come and go; Let the stormy north wind blow: Death's dark valley cannot bind thee In its dread abode; There the Morning Star shall find thee, There the living God. Sin and sorrow cannot hide thee,â Death and hell cannot divide thee From the love of God.â In the mystic agony On the Mount of Calvary, The Saviour with his dying eyes Beheld the groves of Paradise. âThen weep not by the charnel stone, Nor veil thine eyelids from the sun. Upward, through the death-dark glides The spirit on resurgent tides Of light and glory on its way: Wilt thou by the cerements stay?â Thou the risen Christ shalt see In redeemed Humanity. Though mourners at the portal wept, And angels lingered where it slept, The soul but tarried for a night, Then plumed its wings for loftier flight.â âIs thy heart so lonely?âLo, Ready to share thy joy and woe, Poor wanderers tarry at thy gate, The way-worn and the desolate; And angels at thy threshold wait: Wouldst thou love's holiest guerdon win? Arise, and let the stranger in.â âThe friend whom not thy fickle will, But the deep heart within thee, still Yearneth to fold to its embrace, Shall seek thee through the realms of space. Keep the image Nature sealed On thy heart, by love annealed, Keep thy faith serene and pure; Her royal promises are sure, Her sweet betrothals shall endure.â âHope thou all things, and believe; And, in child-like trust, achieve The simplest mandates of the soul, The simplest good, the nearest goal; Move but the waters, and their pulse The broad ocean shall convulse.â âWhen love shall reconcile the will Love's mystic sorrow to fulfill, Its fiery baptism to share,â The burden of its cross to bear,â Earth shall to equilibrium tend, Ellipses shall to circles bend, And life's long agony shall end.â âThen pluck the Life-tree's golden fruit; No blight can reach its sacred root. E'en though every blossom fell Into Hades, one by one, Love is deeper far than Hades,â Shadows cannot quench the sun.â âCan the child-heart promise more Than the Father hath in store?â The blind shall see,âthe dead shall live; Can the man-child forfeit more Than the Father can forgive? The Dragon, from his empire driven, No more shall find his place in Heaven, Till e'en the Serpent power approve The divine potency of love.â âGuard thy faith with holy care,â Mystic virtues slumber there; 'T is the lamp within the soul Holding genii in control: Faith shall walk the stormy water,â In the unequal strife prevail,â Nor, when comes the dread avatar, From its fiery splendors quail. Faith shall triumph o'er the grave, Love shall bless the life it gave.â I heard; and in my heart the incarnate Word Uttered, serene and clear, its sweet accord,â To Him that sitteth on the eternal throne, All power and grace earth's discord to atone,â To the great Soul that foldeth all in one, Father in Heaven, I cried, thy will be done! Then faintly, with my heart's low music blending, I heard a sound of silver wings descending: The Holy Dove of Peace, the promised guest, Folded its fragrant pinions on my breast. Life into lines of beauty flowed Around me, flexuous and free; The passive face of Nature showed A sweet, responsive sympathy; And dimly, through the Human, glowed The lineaments of Deity. I saw the frowning orbs of Fate Into a regent calm dilateâ A sovran and superb disdain Of earth's fast-fleeting joy and pain; While patience budding into peace, And knowledge ripening into power, And thought with its pale alchemy, Made beautiful the passing hour; Till morn and noonlight seemed to fuse Their glory with its fading hues, As the fair outline of my day, From dawn to twilight's golden gray, Rose grandly on the prescient soul, Crowned with the sunset's aureole. Far off, among the Norland hills, The distant thunders rolled; Soft rain-clouds dipped their fringes down Across the evening gold. Heaven's stormy dome was rent, and high Above me shone the summer sky; Ever more serene it grew, Fading off into the blue, Till the boundless hyaline Seemed melting into depths divine, And the angels came and went Through the opening firmament. In all the glooming hollows lay A light more beautiful than day; All the blossom bells waved slowly In the evening's golden calm, And the hum of distant voices Sounded like a vesper psalm. Till dimly seen, through day's departing bloom, The far-off lamps of heaven began to fling Their trembling beams athwart the dewy gloom, As Evening, on the horizon's airy ring, Winnowing the darkness with her silver wing, Descended like an angel, calm and still.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ADDITIONAL POEMS. SONNETS TO ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING. [I. Fair Sibyl, sitting in thy House of Clouds] âO perpetui fiori Dell' eterna letizia!â Il Paradiso. Fair Sibyl, sitting in thy âHouse of Clouds,â Shrined, like some solitary star, above The dull, cold shadow that our earth enshrouds, How oft my spirit looks to thee in love! To thy âLost Bowerâ how oft in dreams returning, I see thee standing in the sylvan room,â See the red sun-light in the rose-cups burning, And the sweet blue-bells nodding through the gloom: Again I hear thy grand and solemn dirges To the dim âGods of Hellas,â like the breeze O'er lone savannas sighing, or the surges That wash the sands of solitary seas; Then, in calm waves of glory, swells the strain, âChrist from the dead hath risen and shall reign!â [II. Sometimes I see thee, pale with scorn and sorrow] âAd una vista D'un gran palazzo Michol ammirava Si come donna dispettosa e trista.â Il Purgatorio. Sometimes I see thee, pale with scorn and sorrow, At a great palace window, looking forth, To-day on plumÃ¨d Florentines,âto-morrow Upon the hireling legions of the North: Sometimes o'er little children bending lowly, To hear their cry, in the dark factories drowned; Ah, then thy pitying brow grows sweet and holy, With a saint's aureole of sorrow crowned! But most I love thee when that mystic gloryâ Kindling at horrors that abhor the dayâ Sheds a wild, stormy splendor o'er the story Of the dark fugitive, who turned away To death's cold threshold, calm in death's disdain, From the âWhite Pilgrim's Rock,â beside the western main. [III. Ay, most I love thee when thy starry song] âOr discendiamo omai a maggior pieta.â L'Inferno. Ay, most I love thee when thy starry song Stoops to the plague-spot that we dare not name, And bares with burning breath the envenomed wrongâ Our country's dark inheritance of shame. When our blaspheming synods look thereon, Stifling God's law and Nature's noble ires With the cold ashes of dead council-fires, That Gorgon terror chills them into stone. Yet while they cringe and palter, thy true heart, Serene in love's own light and woman's ruth, Loyal to God and to God's living truth, Hath uttered words whose fulgent rays shall dart Like sunbeams through our land's Tartarean gloom, Till freedom's holy law its Stygian depths illume. TO PERDITA. What holds thy dreamy eyes in thrall? A sombre picture on the wall; Midnight. By G. H. Boughton. A sombre picture, weird and cold, That dims the daylight's morning gold. A grass-grown rampart, lifting high Its reedy fringe against the sky; Half lost in its o'ershadowing gloom, The semblance of a moldering tomb; Upon the tablet, side by side, In pomp of old heraldic pride, Two sculptured figures lying stark And dumb within the glimmering dark; A raven on the moldering tomb; An owlet flitting through the gloom; A cold, white, wandering moon, that seems The ghost of long-forgotten dreams; In the high rampart an old door, Where night winds enter: nothing more. Why doth it hold thine eyes in thrall, This sombre picture on the wall, That dims the daylight's glad return, And shrineth darkness like an urn? Is there within thy heart a grave O'er which the winds of memory wave, Where, sepulchred in marble pride, Thy dead hopes slumber, side by side, Lost to the future's dawning light, And shrined in immemorial night? Ah! never hope of thine shall sleep Within oblivion's donjon-keep. Thy dreams were born to soar afar Beyond the morning's purple star; Thy loyal heart shall re-create From loss and wrong a loftier fate; Thy own deep heart of love illume Thy life with love's immortal bloom. On thy white brow, absolved from blame, A shining stone, with a new name, Shall flood the dark with living flame; Thy life, a perfume and a prayer, With mystic fragrance fill the air, And all thy buried hopes shall rise Transfigured into destinies. 1859. A PANSY FROM THE GRAVE OF KEATS. âThat's for thoughts!ââ Shakespeare. Three velvet petals darkly spread In sumptuous sorrow for the dead, Superbly sombre as a pall Wrought for an elfin funeral; Two, hued like wings of silver light Unfurled for Psyche's heavenward flight; And every petal, o'er and o'er, All legended with faery lore, A palimpsest of fables old And mythic stories manifold. Endymion in enchanted swoon Tranced by the melancholy moon; And, hovering near, the crescent-crowned Diana, with her sylvan hound;â The virgin huntress, proud and pale, Betrayed to passion's blissful bale, Till all her beautiful disdain Is lost in love's imperial pain. Sad, star-eyed Lamia's serpent spell, And the wild dirge of Isabel. Hyperion in his palace bright, Bastioned with pyramids of light, Kindling the dawn with fiery breath, Battling with Darkness and with Death,â The pregnant fable left half told,â A fading blush of morning gold. The story of St. Agnes' Eve, The tale where legioned fairies weave. Their spells within the moonlight gloom Of Madeline's enchanted room. The casement, triple-arched and high, Enwrought with antique tracery,â The blazoned window's gorgeous panes That blush with old heraldic stains; The broidered kirtle on the floor, The jeweled casket's gleaming store; The chamber, silken, hushed and chill, Where Madeline lies dreaming still, Lost in the lap of legends old, And curtained from the moonlight cold, Till, lowly kneeling at her side, The minstrel-lover woos his bride. I hear afar the wassail roar Surge through the distant corridor, As through the ancient, bannered halls The midnight music swells and falls; The castle lamps are all aglow; The silver-snarling trumpets blow. 'T was ages, ages long ago, The vigil of St. Agnes' Night, The ruse, the revel, and the flight; But, till love's faery lore be past, The charm of Agnes' Eve shall last. The poet sleeps, and pansies bloom Beside his far Italian tomb; The turf is heaped above his bed; The stone is moldering at his head; But each fair creature of his dream, Transferred to daylight's common beam, Lives the charmed life that waneth never, A Beauty and a Joy forever. 1859. APPLE-BLOOMS. TO CARRIE, BY HER COUSIN. You had been robbing apple-trees,â Robbing rosy apple-trees,â Stealing from the honey-bees Stores of sweetness, while I lay, In the twilight's tender gray, Dreaming of orchards far away,â Pale orchard blooms that fell like rain Upon a far-off phantom plain,â Dear days that would not dawn again, And May-moons that would rise no more: When softly through the open door A cloud of perfume seemed to pour, And then I saw two faces loom Through tufts of pearly apple-bloom, Filling with rose-light all the room,â Two fair young faces, smiling through The pink-white blossoms, and I knew The May-queen's messengers in you. I knew the orchard slopes were fair,â I knew the winds that lingered there O'er-swept them with enchanted air! I saw the branches toss and swing, Heard the bee's elfin bugle ring, And owned the presence of the Spring. May, 1860. NIGHT WANES. Night wanes: the nation's travail, throe by throe, Brings on the hour that shall absolve her sin; And the great, solemn bells, now swinging slow, With tales of murder in their iron din, Shall ring the years of peace and freedom in. Be patient, O my heart; look through the gloom Of the sad present, look through all the past, And learn how, out of sin and death and doom, And mournful tragedies, august and vast, The world's great victories are achieved at last. Look far away; count all the triumphs bought By martyred saints, found worthy to atone For others' sin, see life from death outwrought, And know each blast from War's wild bugle blown Shall melt in music round the âGreat White Throne.â 1861. NIGHT AND STORM. I saw the waning August moon Rise o'er the rocky shore, And on a sad and stormy sea Its lurid crimson pour. My window opened to the east, And far and far away, I saw the headlong billows breast The breakers of the bay. The broad red sea seemed like a field Where charging squadrons go: I heard the clang of spear and shield, I heard the clarions blow. Near me the dancers' flying feet, With sounds of harp and horn, And wild waltz-music, madly sweet, Were on the night-winds borne. Rich voices lingered on the ear, And laughter floated by, And many a call of merry cheer, And many a glad reply. I only watched the trampling feet Of waves upon the shore; I only heard their war-drums beat, Their plunging batteries roar. I thought on many a bannered plain, On battles lost and won, On homes bereft and heroes slain, And armies marching on. The wild waltz-music died away, The laughter and the glee, But all night long a stormy song Seemed sounding from the sea: A wail of trumpets in the air, A dead march on the wave, Wild tones of triumph or despair O'er all our martyred brave. I hailed Jehovah's fiery sword In battles lost and won; I hailed the armies of the Lord And heard them marching on. Ocean House, Cape Elizabeth, August, 1863. DON ISLE. Cromwell's siege of the sea-girt castle and fortress of Don Isle, which was heroically defended by a female descendant of Nicholas Le Poer, Baron of Don isle, is, as represented by Sir Bernard Burke in his Romance of Irish History, full of legendary interest. Lonely beneath the silent stars It stands, a gray and moldering pile, Wreck'd in the wild Cromwellian wars, The sea-girt castle of Don Isle. The wild waves beat the castle wall, And bathe the rock with ceaseless showers; Dark heaving billows plunge and fall In whitening foam beneath the towers. High beetling o'er the headland's brow All seam'd and battle-scarr'd it stands, And rents and gaping ruins show The ravage of the spoiler's hands. Two hundred years have rolled away, And still, at twilight's haunted hour, A ghostly lady seems to stray By ruined barbacan and tower. Dauntless within her lone domain She held at bay her father's foe, Till faithless followers fired the train That laid her feudal fortress low. Afar her exiled kinsmen roam; She perished in the smoldering pile, The last of all her house and home, The lonely lady of Don Isle. The gray moss gathers on the wall, And slow beneath the silent stars The crumbling turrets waste and fall Wrecked in the wild Cromwellian wars: And peasants round their evening fire With many a tale the hours beguile, Of warrior ghosts and spectres dire That haunt the castle of Don Isle. 1864. NIGHTFALL ON THE SEACONNET SHORE. To R. D. S. We sat together, you and I, And watched the daylight's dying bloom, And saw the great white ships go by, Like phantoms through the gathering gloom. Like phantom lights the lonely stars Looked through the sea-fog's ghastly veil, Beyond the headland's rocky bars We heard the stormy surges wail. We sat together, hand in hand, Upon the lonely, sea-girt wall, And watched along the glimmering strand, The wild, white breakers plunge and fall. You spoke of pleasures past away, Of hopes that left the heart forlorn, Of life's unrest and love's decay, And lonely sorrows proudly borne. The sea's phantasmal sceneries Commingled with your mournful theme; The splendors of your starry eyes Were drowned in memory's deepening dream. Darker and lonelier grew the night Along the horizon's dreary verge, And lonelier through the lessening light Sang the wild sea-wind's wailing dirge. When, kindling through the gathering gloom, Beyond West-Island's beetling brow, Where breakers dash, and surges boom, We saw Point Judith's fires aglow. Piercing night's solemn mystery, The light-house reared its lonely form, Serene above the weltering sea And guardant through the gathering storm. So, o'er the sea of life's unrest, Through grief's wild storm, and sorrow's gloom, Faith's heavenly pharos in the breast Lights up the dark with deathless bloom. The sea-born sadness of the hour Melted beneath its holy spell; Faith blossomed into perfect flower, And our hearts whispered, âAll is well.â 1864. TO âSHIRLEY:â The good Santa Claus who sent me David Gray's Poems. Dear Santa Claus, your reindeer hoof Fell soft as snow-flakes on the roof That spanned my hall of dreams last night, And when I woke, the morning light Was lovelier, and the wintry day More fair for you and David Gray: His summer moons, his autumn nights, The glamour of his sunset lights, His red dawns and their rosy glow On the white wonder of the snow; The sadness of his poet-soul That looked beyond life's mortal goal, For the great glory that should pour, Through golden death's immortal door. Entranced I lie the livelong day, Dreaming of you and David Gray,â Dreaming I see the daylight fade Across the castled palisade Of sunset clouds; it dies and dies Into diviner harmonies. Sweet, haunting faces light the gloom Of twilight in my lonely room,â Proud poet-faces, sad and stern, To whom earth gave a marble urn That could nor life nor love restore: This, âonly this, and nothing more!â The page grows dim, and solemn night, Drops her rich curtain o'er the light, Till, fold on fold, its dusky fall Shuts out the far horizon wall: The stars begin to glint and spark Across the purple of the dark, And all the happy winter day, Made fair through you and David Gray, Melts in a heavenly dream away! December 25, 1865. PROSERPINE TO PLUTO IN HADES. âNec repetita sequi curet Proserpina matrem.â Virgil, George. I. 39. I think on thee amid these spring-time flowers, On thee, my emperor, my sovran lord, Dwelling alone in dim Tartarean towers Of thy dark realm, by earth and heaven abhorred, Wandering afar by that Avernian river Where dead kings walk and phantoms wail forever. I think on thee in that stern palace regnant, Where no sweet voice of summer charms the air, Where the vast solitude seems ever pregnant With some wild dream of unforetold despair. Thy love, remembered, doth heaven's light eclipse; I feel thy lingering kisses on my lips. I languish for the late autumnal showers, The cool, cool plashing of the autumn rain, The shimmering hoar-frost and fast-fading flowers, That give me back to thy dark realm again: To thee I'll bring Sicilia's starry skies And all the heaven of summer in my eyes. When from earth's noontide beauty borne away To the pale prairies of that under world, A mournful flower upon thy breast I lay Till round thy heart its clinging tendrils curledâ A frighted dove, that tamed its fluttering pinion To the dear magic of thy love's dominion. For thou wert grandly beautiful as night, Stern Orcus, in thy realm of buried kings; And thy sad crown of cypress in my sight Fairer than all the bright and flowery rings Of wreathÃ¨d poppies and of golden corn By Ceres on her stately temples worn. I sat beside thee on Hell's dusky throne, Nor feared the awful shadow of thy fate; Content to share the burden of thy crown, And all the mournful splendors of thy state; Bending my flower-like beauty to thy will, Seeking with light thy lonely dark to fill. Wondering, I think how thy dear love hath bound me In a new life that half forgets the old; All day I haunt the meadows where you found me, Knee-deep in daffodils of dusky gold, Or sit by Cyane's sad fountain, dreaming Of the red lake by thy proud palace gleaming. When, in her car by wingÃ¨d dragons borne, Pale Ceres sought me through the shuddering night, With angry torches and fierce eyes, forlorn, Slaying the dark that screened me from her sight, Like a reft lioness that rends the air Of midnight with her perilous despair, Jove, pitying the great passion of her woe, Gave back thy queen-bride to the mother's griefâ To Ceres gaveâthrough summer's golden glow And all the crescent months, from spear to sheaf: Alas, how sadly in Sicilian bowers I pass this lonely, lingering time of flowers! In the long silence of the languid noons, When all the panting birds are faint with heat, I wander listless by the blue lagoons To hear their light waves rippling at my feet Through the dead calm, and count the lingering time By the slow pulsing of their silver chime. I languish for the late autumnal showers, The cool, cool plashing of the autumn rain, The shimmering hoar-frost and fast-fading flowers, That give me back to thy dark realm again: I have no native land from thee apart, And my high heaven of heavens is in thy heart. THE TYPHON. âTyphon, dread demon from the realms below, The dark, mysterious cause of every woe, The racking ague and the fever throe!â When the green leaves to golden bronze were turning, And earth lay parched beneath the October sun, A sullen fever in my veins was burning, While life and death seemed melting into one. At eventide the cheerful embers glowing Through the cool chamber turned to fires of doom; In the white draperies o'er the windows flowing Lurked sheeted phantoms from the nether gloom. Great, gorgon heads and stony faces only Looked out from all the pictures on the wall; The quaint sequestered room grew vast and lonely As the wide vaulted arch of Vathek's hall; The walls, now fading into endless distance, Now narrowing round me to a low-browed cave, Where in a living death without resistance I lay as in the hollow of a grave. Strange life in death! that left my soul to wander Long ages in a dim sepulchral pile, The legend of forgotten lives to ponder On footworn marbles of the moldering aisle. My vanished years were thereâa long succession Of sultry summers severed by the snows Of endless winters, while some dark obsession Forced me to read the record to its close. Day followed day and night to night succeeded, And still the powers of darkness reigned supreme; A smoldering fire the pulse of life impeded, And all my past seemed one long fever dream. Then the foul Typhon fled. A wondrous glory Flooded the world with health's returning tide, And all the sorrows of life's mystic story Were but as wandering clouds through moonlit heavens that glide. I865. CHRISTMAS EVE. TO MY LITTLE FRIENDS AT NEW ROCHELLE. Let fall the curtains, drop the shades; Behind the hills the twilight fades; The sullen rain-drops, heavily, In the dank, drooping hemlocks lie; The fir-trees in the rounding park Loom statelier through the gathering dark, And reddening in the starless night The tall church windows blaze with light. The north wind whistles down the glades; Let fall the curtains, drop the shades, And, while the fire-light's glowing gloom Casts fitful shadows through the room, Gather around the ruddy blaze To welcome in the holidays. See Haidee's dark brown eyes grow bright As diamonds in the dancing light, To hear the merry bells that ring In the tall steeples,âding dong ding; While Rena's songs sound sweet and rare As music heard in mountain air, And Ethel, with cheeks all abloom, Goes dancing, dancing round the room, Or softly lingers at my knee To watch the wondrous Christmas Tree. Sweet Christmas Eve! The holidays May pass, the firelight's cheerful blaze Die out, the little waltzing feet To other mazy measures beat, And other Christmas Trees may spread Their fragrant branches o'er my head, And fairy fruit for us may fall In many a distant bower and hall, And Santa Claus at Christmas tide May down the roaring chimneys ride, And chapel bells with solemn chime Ring in the Christ-child's holy time, And tell to all the wondering Earth The mystic story of his birth; But memory long shall fondly dwell On this blithe eve at New Rochelle, And fairer deem our Christmas Tree Than all that have been or may be, And keep the birthnight it embalms Sweet as the breath of heavenly palms. December, I866. SANTA CLAUS. A health to good old Santa Claus, And to his reindeer bold, Whose hoofs are shod with eider-down, Whose horns are tipped with gold. He comes from utmost fairy-land Across the wintry snows; He makes the fir-tree and the spruce To blossom like the rose. Over the quaint old gables, Over the windy ridge, By turret wall and chimney tall, He guides his fairy sledge; Along the sleeping house-tops Its silver runners trend, All loaded down with wonder-books And tales without an end. He steals upon the slumbers Of little rose-lipped girls, And lays his waxen dollies down Beside their golden curls. He scatters blessings on his way And sugar-coated plums. He robs the sluggard of his rest, With trumpets, guns, and drums. Small feet, before the dawn of day, Are marching to and fro, Drums beat to arms through all the house, And penny trumpets blow. A health to brave old Santa Claus, And to his reindeer bold, Whose hoofs are shod with eider-down, Whose horns are tipped with gold. He tells us of the yule-log That blazed in Saxon halls, Of the marchpane and the mistletoe, And the minstrels' merry calls; Of Christmas candles burning bright In ages long ago; Those long dark ages when the world Turned round so very slow. He comes from utmost fairy-land Across the wintry snows; He makes the fir-tree and the spruce To blossom like the rose. He lingers till the Christmas bells, With sweet and solemn chime, Come sounding o'er the centuries Through years of war and crime. Ring out, ring out, sweet Christmas bells! Ring loud and silver clear! Ring peace on earth, good will to man, Till all the world shall hear! December, I867. OUR LAST WALK. TO R. B. B. The October day was dying, the dark sea Flushed crimson at the coming of the sun; The ripened year lay drowsing on the lea, Like a tired reaper when his task is done. Slowly we loitered o'er the twilight wold, Through velvet sheep-walks, and where reedy plumes And nodding fern tufts, tipt with tawny gold, Fringe the dank borders where the gentian blooms. The very crickets seemed to drone and dream, As if they felt the sweet mysterious charm Of the hushed evening, and attuned their theme To its low cadences of slumberous calm. With scarlet hips and sprays of purpling leaves The brier-rose in the bosky thickets burned, The maples flamed beneath the forest eaves, And their cold gloom to sudden splendor turned. The level sunbeams glinted through the trees And flecked with arrowy light their verdant mold, And bound red baldricks round their gnarled knees, And fringed the tufted knolls with raveled gold. Our woodland path was dim with tender dreams Of the past summer, and a pensive gloom, Lit by the rosy sunset's dying gleams, Filled the long arches of our sylvan room: Sweet haunting memories of our golden noons, Our twilight wanderings by the lonely shore, Our August mornings, our September noons, Our long, sweet, summer days that are no more. We sat together by the sunset sea, Screened from its solemn splendors by a wall Of beech and oak and many a tangled tree Of the witch-elms that over-roofed our hall. It was your birthnight, and close-clasped in mine I held your hand, and blessed the imperial hour That sheathed your spirit in a mortal shrine, And gave to bloom on earth a thornless flower. OUR HAUNTED ROOM. TO E. N. G. âOh life! infinite life! the beautiful gates unfold! The shadowless light that knows no night Breaks over the city of gold! I rise on invisible pinions. I breathe an ineffable breath! Oh, life! rivers of life! for me there is no more death!â [Last lines of Elizabeth N. Gladding, who died of malarial fever, while teaching the freedmen at St. Helena Island, S. C., July, I867.] Here, where thy presence, like a rare, Sweet perfume, lingers everywhere, Elusive shadows haunt the air. The dimly-pictured walls expand To mountain sceneries, wild and grand, Where war-worn castles proudly stand,â Bastions and barbacans that gleam In the old mirror's crystal stream, Like far-off palaces of dream. A censer, curiously enwrought, That burned in some barbaric court, Drowsed in the Orient's dusky thought, On the long centuries seems to brood, When in Mongolian halls it stood, Breathing of myrrh and sandal wood. From an amphora, quaint and tall, Funereal mosses float and fall, And waver down the chamber wall, Dark southern mosses that have hung The wild sea-island woods among, And o'er their deep morasses swung. The hands that twined with flexile grace Their garlands round my flower-lipped vase, Shrouding the corbel's sculptured face, Fair-folded in a southern clime, Absolved from all the toils of time, Await the eternal morning's prime: Fair-folded by the Atlantic wave, 'Mid the dark race she died to save, Where homeless sea-winds haunt her grave. But when the sunset fires are low, And twilight fancies come and go, And mystic winds of memory blow,â When the heart feels its courage fail, Its visioned hopes without avail, Untouched, unfound its Holy Grail,â Some solemn rapture, like a strain Of music's beautiful disdain, Uplifts beyond all mortal pain: A sudden splendor rifts the gloom,â A light that seems to bud and bloom From out the shadows of the room: A silken stir anear the door, Like rose-leaves rippling o'er the floor, And lo! glad-smiling, as of yore, Close at my side I see thee stand In shining garments, ghostly grand, A palm-branch budding in thy hand, And, sweet as morning's music breath Across the hills of Nazareth, A low voice murmurs, âNo more death!â 1870. MEMORIAL HYMN. WRITTEN FOR THE DEDICATION OF THE RHODE ISLAND SOLDIERS' AND SAILORS' MONUMENT. Raise the proud pillar of granite on high, Graced with all honors that love can impart; Lift its fair sculptures against the blue sky, Blazoned and crowned with the trophies of art,â Crowned with the triumphs of genius and art! Long may its white column soar to the sky, Like a lone lily that perfumes the mart, Lifting its coronal beauty on high. Sons of Rhode Island, your record shall stand Graven on tablets of granite and bronze; Soldiers and sailors, beloved of our land, Darlings and heroes, our brothers and sons,â Gray-bearded heroes and beautiful sons! Soldiers and sailors, the flower of our land, Deep as on tablets of granite and bronze, Graved on our hearts shall your bright record stand. Swell the loud psalm, let the war trumpets sound; Fling the old flag to the wild autumn blast; High in Valhalla our comrades are crowned; There may we meet when life's conflicts are past,â Meet in the great Hall of Heroes at last! High in Valhalla our comrades are crowned. Swell with Hosannas the wild autumn blast! Let the full chorus of voices resound! September 16, 1871. A BUNCH OF GRAPES. PAINTED BY E. C. LEAVITT. âSuch as lurked behind the trees In gardens of Hesperides.â On a sultry night in June, In the trances of the moon, Came a sudden thunder-squall Crashing through the lindens tall; Every grape-vine was blown down, Every rose-tree lost its crown, Jagged lightning, sheeted rain, Dashed athwart the window pane. Then a gust swept through the hall, A sudden splendor rent the pall Of darkness;âby its dazzling glare I saw a stranger standing there, With beaded raindrops in his hair. Over eyes of dusky sheen Vine-wreaths wove a leafy screen, Such as crowns the marble brow Of Bacchus in the busts we know; Such, at least, I seemed to see,â Perchance the lightning blinded me. Then a hand of plastic power, Cool and dripping with the shower, Dropped within my hand a bunch Of grapelets, fit for Juno's lunch; Grapes by Orient sunbeams kissed Into globes of amethyst; Such as haughty Guinevere Flung into the haunted mere; Jewels for some queenly head, In the purple born and bred; Every dark globe veined with fire, Like the brown cheek of a gypsy; Lucent drops of love and ire, Such as made the MÃ¦nads tipsy; Every purple bead a gem For Alraschid's diadem; Each a miracle of art, Fit to charm a poet's heart. Dazed I stood, without a word, And the silence was unstirred Save by storm winds sweeping o'er us, And the thunder's hollow chorus, As he vanished from my sight, In the wild and lonesome night. Was it Bacchus? Who can tell? If not he, 't wasâE. C. L. 1872. THE OLD MIRROR. Oft I see at twilight, In the hollow gloom Of the dim old mirror, Phantasmal faces loom: Noble antique faces, Sad as with the weight Of some ancient sorrow, Some ancestral fate: Little rose-lipped faces, Locks of golden shine, Laughing eyes of childhood Looking into mine: Sweet auroral faces, Like the morning's bloom; Ah, how long and long ago Shrouded for the tomb! In a bridal chamber Once the mirror hung; Draperies of Indian looms Over it were flung. From its gilded sconces, Fretted now with mold, Waxen tapers glimmered On carcanets of gold. Perfumes of the summer night Were through the lattice blown, Scents of brier roses And meadows newly mown. The mirror then looked eastward And caught the morning bloom, And flooded with its rosy gold The dreamlight of the room. To-night 't is looking westward Toward the sunset wall; The wintry day is waning, The dead leaves drift and fall. All about the hearth-stone The whitening ashes blow, The wind is wailing an old song Heard long and long ago. Like the dead leaves drifting Through the wintry air, Like white ashes sifting O'er the hearth-stone bare, Sad ancestral faces, Wan as moon-lit snow, Haunt the dim old mirror That knew them long ago. 1875. THE NIGHT BLOOMING CEREUS. A NOCTURNE, FOR M. A. A July evening, damp and cold; Over the dim horizon wall Low clouds their heavy draperies rolled, Till darkness gathered like a pall Around me, and the shadowy room Grew slumberous with its weight of gloom. Heard I a step?âor had I dreamed? Strange perfume through the chamber streamed, A phantom flower was in my hand From some far off enchanted land. Wondering, I placed it where a low Lamp gleamed, like moonlight over snow. The winds were hushed, the night was still, The very silence seemed to thrill With that strange effluence. Filled with awe, In rapt and wondering mood I saw The mystic lily, pure and cold, Whose beauty never knew the sun, Its vestal garniture unfold, Till slowly, slowly, one by one, Its lucent petals fall apart, Unveiling all its virgin heart! From what far heights of glory came That coronal of silver flame? From what deep fount of wonder welled The holy gold its chalice held? Strange marvel of the summer night, Veiled in an aureole of light, To vanish ere the morning hour! Gazing upon thy magic flower, With such superfluous beauty fraught,â Owning the presence of a power Beyond the reaches of our thought,â Almost the gazer fears to guess The mystery of thy loveliness. 1877. âA PAT OF BUTTER.â TO EMILIA. Yellow as the cups of gold, Peering through the springtime mold, Sweeter than a breath of clover Blowing the June meadows over.â Butter, such as Goethe said Werter saw his Charlotte spread For her sisters and her brothers, And, perhaps, for a few others, Till it turned her lover's head; Such as sweet Red Riding Hood, By that wicked wolf pursued, Through the enchanted forest bore To her grandam's fatal door. 'T is the ashen time of Lent. Well, I know some fairy sent This, for my soul's nourishment: Well I know a fairy churned The creamy lactage till it turned To golden gobbets; that a dame Of gracious presence, known to fame By her sweet baptismal name Of Emilia (Emily), Pressed it into shape for me With her jeweled fingers. Say you: âThis is all a dream?â I pray you, Then, in sober truth to tell me Has your huckster some to sell me? Tell me, tell me, I implore, What's his number? Where 's his store? 1877. EPIGÃA. ââPink with promises of spring.â âI wandered lonely as a cloudâ Along the busy, bustling street, Unmindful of the alien crowd That passed me by with hurrying feet: I knew not 't was an April day, So chill the winds that blew this way. When, at a crossing of the flags A wanderer from the woods I met, With willow wands and alder tags And tufts of pink arbutus, wet With April dews and showers, that fell Around them in some far-off dell, And redolent of the rich loam That fed them in their forest homeâ Strange perfume, in whose effluence broods The wild, sweet spirit of the woodsâ Bringing remembrance of old days, Of spring-time wanderings through a maze Of mossy, winding, woodland ways, Or, o'er some brown hill's hoary side Where the shy May-flower loves to hide. Then, with a glinting of surprise In the cool shadow of his eyes, The woodman touched me with his wand And turned the street to Fairy-land! âWell met,â he cried; âI have a few Tufts of arbutus. These for you.â April, 1876. âSCIENCE.â âThe words âvital force,â âinstinct,â âsoul,â are only expressions of our ignorance.ââ Buchner. While the dull Fates sit nodding at their loom, Benumbed and drowsy with its ceaseless boom, I hear, as in a dream, the monody Of life's tumultuous, ever-ebbing sea; The iron tramp of armies hurrying by Forever and forever but to die; The tragedies of time, the dreary years, The frantic carnival of hopes and fears, The wild waltz-music wailing through the gloom, The slow death-agonies, the yawning tomb, The loved ones lost forever to our sight, In the wide waste of chaos and old night; Earth's long, long dream of martyrdom and pain; No God in heaven to rend the welded chain Of endless evolution! Is this all? And mole-eyed âScience,â gloating over bones, The skulls of monkeys and the Age of Stones, Blinks at the golden lamps that light the hall Of dusty death, and answers: âIt is all.â 1877. TO THE ANGEL OF DEATH. Thou ancient Mystery! thy solemn night,â Pierced by attempered rays from that far realm That lies beyond, dark with excess of light,â No more the shuddering spirit shall o'erwhelm. No more thy charnel glooms the soul appall, Pale Azrael! awful eidolon of Death!â The dawn-light breaks athwart thy glimmering hall, And thy dank vapors own the morning's breath. Too long the terror of the dread unknown Hath the wrung heart with hopeless anguish riven; The blasting splendors of the fiery throne âBurning within the inmost veil of Heavenââ The gloom of that great glory, which of old Haunted the vision of the prophet's dream, When the archangel of the Lord foretold The day of doom, by dark Hiddekel's stream. In vain, through lingering years, I turned the page Rich with these sacred records of the past, Hope languished, and no legend could assuage The rayless gloom thy awful shadow cast. In dread apocalypse, I saw thee borne On the pale steed, triumphant o'er the doomed, Till the rent Heavens like a scroll were torn, And hollow earth her hundred isles entombed. In vain I questioned the cold stars, and kept Lone vigils by the grave of buried love; No angel wing athwart the darkness swept, No voice vouchsafed my sorrow to reprove. Was it the weight of that remorseless woe, The lonely anguish of that long despair,â That made thy marble lips at length forego Their silence at my soul's unceasing prayer? Henceforth, the sorrowing heart its pulse shall still To solemn cadences of sweet repose, Content life's mystic passion to fulfill In the great calm that from thy promise flows. Welcome as the white feet of those who bring Glad tidings of great joy unto the world, Shall fall the shadow of thy silver wing Over the weary couch of woe unfurled. A heavenly halo kindles round thy brow; Beyond the palms of Eden softly wave; Bright messengers athwart the empyrean go, And love to love makes answer o'er the grave. THE PORTRAIT. After long years I raised the folds concealing That face, magnetic as the morning's beam: While slumbering memory thrilled at its revealing, Like Memnon wakening from his marble dream. Again I saw the brow's translucent pallor, The dark hair floating o'er it like a plume; The sweet, imperious mouth, whose haughty valor Defied all portents of impending doom. Eyes planet calm, with something in their vision That seemed not of earth's mortal mixture born; Strange mythic faiths and fantasies Elysian, And far, sweet dreams of âfairy lands forlorn.â Unfathomable eyes that held the sorrow Of vanished ages in their shadowy deeps, Lit by that prescience of a heavenly morrow Which in high hearts the immortal spirit keeps. Oft has that pale, poetic presence haunted My lonely musings at the twilight hour, Transforming the dull earth-life it enchanted, With marvel and with mystery and with power. Oft have I heard the sullen sea-wind moaning Its dirge-like requiems on the lonely shore, Or listening to the Autumn woods intoning The wild, sweet legend of the lost Lenore; Oft in some ashen evening of October, Have stood entranced beside a moldering tomb Hard by that visionary Lake of Auber, Where sleeps the shrouded form of Ulalume; Oft in chill, star-lit nights have heard the chiming Of far-off mellow bells on the keen air, And felt their molten-golden music timing To the heart's pulses, answering unaware. Sweet, mournful eyes, long closed upon earth's sorrow Sleep restfully after life's fevered dream! Sleep, wayward heart! till on some cool, bright morrow, Thy soul, refreshed, shall bathe in morning's beam. Though cloud and sorrow rest upon thy story, And rude hands lift the drapery of thy pall, Time, as a birthright, shall restore the glory, And Heaven rekindle all the stars that fall. 1870. THE VENUS OF MILO. âWhen I entered for the last time that magnificent hall of the Louvre, where stands on her pedestal the ever-blessed goddess of beauty, our beloved Lady of Milo, the diva looked on me with a face of mournful and tender compassion.ââ Heinrich Heine. Goddess of dreams, mother of love and sorrow, Such sorrow as from love's fair promise flows, Such love as from love's martyrdoms doth borrow That conquering calm which only sorrow knows!â Venus, Madonna! so serene and tender, In thy calm after-bloom of life and love, More fair than when of old thy sea-born splendor Surprised the senses of Olympian Jove!â Not these the lips, that kindling into kisses, Poured subtile heats through Adon's languid frame, Rained on his sullen lips their warm caresses, Thrilled to his heart and turned its frost to flame. Thy soul transcending passion's wild illusion, Its fantasy and fever and unrest, Broods tenderly in thought's devout seclusion, O'er some lost love-dream lingering in thy breast. Thy face seems touched with pity for the anguish Of earth's disconsolate and lonely hearts; For all the lorn and loveless lives that languish In solitary homes and sordid marts: With pity for the faithlessness and feigning, The vain repentance and the long regret, The perfumed lamps in lonely chambers waning, The untouched fruits on golden salvers set: With pity for the patient watchers yearning Through glimmering casements over midnight moors, Thrilled by the echo of far feet returning Through the blank darkness of the empty doors: With sorrow for the coy, sweet buds that cherish In virgin pride love's luxury of gloom, And in their fair unfolded beauty perish, Fading like flowers that knew not how to bloom: With sorrow for the over-blown pale roses That yield their fragrance to the wandering air; For all the penalties that life imposes On passion's dream, on love's divine despair. 1868. IN MEMORIAM. How many Aprils have I roamed beside thee O'er the brown hills where now alone I tread? And though far realms of wonder now divide thee From our dim world, I cannot deem thee dead. I held thee in my arms while life was failing,â Close in my arms and watched thy fluttering breath, Till the red sunset in the west was paling And twilight veiled the awful calm of death. In that white calm I saw then and forever The grandeur of thy spirit and its power; E'en as its mortal vestment seemed to sever, I saw the immortal bursting into flower. That soul, so lofty in its isolation; So strong in weakness, resolute in pain; So self-reliant in its reprobation Of servile arts and custom's iron reign; Mid alien crowds alone, with none to know thee, With nothing left behind thee to regret, Save one sad heart that love's sweet debt doth owe thee, One lonely heart that never can forget. April, 1878. MY FLOWERS. Sweet buds and berries gathered, far and wide, In haunted glens or wild sequestered ways; By sun or starlight,âin the purple pride, Of Summer, or in Autumn's golden haze Long have I held ye, clasped within my hands, Wooing your mystic odors to restore The sweet aroma of those flowery lands;â The perfume of the days that are no more: Sad Autumn leaves, touched with the fatal glow Kindling athwart the forest's silent gloom, Farewell! I fling ye on the way-side now, Where heedless feet may trample on your bloom; For, through the silence and the o'ershadowing calm, Floats the far perfume of the Eden palm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CINDERELLA AND THE SLEEPING BEAUTY. CINDERELLA. âPomp and feast and revelry, Masque and antique pageantry.â L'Allegro. PART I. The night was cold, the skies were bleak, The ways were dark and dreary, When Cinderella o'er the fire Sat hovering, worn and weary. Neglected in her childhood's home, She knew no mother's care, Condemned, in youthful loveliness, A menial's lot to share. Her haughty sisters spend their days In splendor and parade; To ball and opera they go, To play and masquerade: And now, bedecked with gems and gold, In festal crowds they shone, While she beside the chimney nook Sat musing and alone. The ruddy hearth-fires gleam and fade Upon the dusky wall, And on the oaken paneling Fantastic shadows fall. No sound is heard in all the house, So lonely now and drear, And e'en the cricket's drowsy song Falls faintly on her ear. There pensive by the hearth she sat And watched the flickering fire, Nor saw that close beside her stood A dame in rich attire. When, lo! upon her startled gaze A matchless splendor broke, As thus, in thrilling words and low, The radiant fairy spoke:â âNo longer shalt thou moping sit, Oppressed with gloom and care, But at the royal banquet shine The fairest of the fair. Go, search, and by the garden wall A pompion thou shalt find, And lo! a chariot shall arise From out its golden rind! âDown in the cellar's darkest nook A rat-trap shalt behold, Whose narrow space doth stable steeds Of more than mortal mold! Behind the moss-grown garden well Six lizards thou shalt see; These, with the pompion and the trap, Go quickly bring to me.â And now she sees with wondering awe Six powdered footmen stand, Six mice transformed to stately steeds Beneath the fairy's wand! At length a glittering car arose From out the pompion's rind, While blazing torches flamed before And footmen swung behind! Lo! Cinderella's tattered garb, With dust and ashes strown, Touched by the fairy's magic wand, With pearls and diamonds shone! All woven woof of mortal loom Her vesture did surpass, And on her little feet were seen Two slippers framed of glass! âNow,â said the fairy, âmount thy car And to the palace speed, But as you prize my fairy gifts, My parting counsel heed: Shouldst thou within the castle gates Outstay the midnight hour, Thy gorgeous robes to tatters turn, My spell hath lost its power.â She said:âthe fiery coursers prance, Their rattling hoofs resound, With tossing heads and flying manes They clear the frozen ground. The Prince (informed some noble dame Arrives in matchless state), With all his royal retinue, Receives her at the gate. With courtly grace the startled child He up the staircase hands, And now within the blazing hall Sweet Cinderella stands. Soon as she stept within the door The music ceased to sound, And on the softly perfumed air A murmur floats around. Before her nobles bent the knee, And courtly dames caressed, While foremost in the glittering throng Her haughty sisters pressed. Amid the glittering throng she stood Like some wild woodland flower, Blushing at her own loveliness, And trembling at its power. The Prince, enamored, claimed her hand And bore her to the dance, And oft amid its mazy rings She sought her sisters' glance. At length upon the castle clock She chanced to turn her eye And starts to see upon its face The hour of midnight nigh! Then, swiftly as a falling star Shoots through the gloom of night, She sprang into her airy car And vanished from their sight. And now of all her splendor reft And all her rich attire, She takes her solitary place Beside the smoldering fire. But soon she hears a thundering knock Resounding through the hall;â The sisters all come rushing in, Enraptured with the ball. All talk at once and all descant Upon the unknown guest, And tell of all the courtesies She showed them at the feast. They say that court and city now Are ringing with her fame. The Prince has offered countless sums To learn the stranger's name. Fair Cinderella, wild with joy, Seems little heed to take, She only yawns and rubs her eyes As if but half awake. At length she said, âAh, sisters dear, Might I but only go, To-morrow night, in pearl and white, With you to see the show?â âIn pearl and white, you little fright! A figure you would cut! How would your pearl and white agree With cinders and with smut?â âThen would my sister Charlotte, dear, But only give me leave To wear the yellow satin dress She wore on Christmas eve?â âLend you my satin dress, indeed! But understand at once That courts and balls are not for such As you, you little dunce!â PART II. Again the palace halls are thronged With many a noble guest, And Cinderella, lovelier still, Is there among the rest. So fast the golden moments fly In rapture and delight, She soon forgets to count the hours Nor heeds their rapid flight. But, hark! at length the castle clock Sounds from its lofty tower; She starts to hear it, stroke by stroke, Toll forth the midnight hour. She fled across the marble floor Fleet as the mountain wind, But, tripping at the door, she left One shining shoe behind. There, gleaming like a diamond spark, The little slipper lies, Dropped like a star-flake in the path Where some swift meteor flies. Breathless she gains the castle court, In terror and dismay, With naught of all her splendor left Nor all her rich array. Her rich array, to tatters turned, Hangs fluttering in the wind; The mice run scampering on before, The pompion rolls behind! The guards that round the portal wait, With startled eyes, behold A vagrant leave the palace gate And cross the moonlit wold. And wondering menials stare to see The little beggar pass, For nought of all her pomp remains Except one shoe of glass. Next day the herald's trump did sound Proclaiming far and wide That whosoe'er could wear the shoe Should be the Prince's bride! From street to street, from house to house, The glittering prize they bear, But ne'er a lady in the land That little shoe could wear. 'T was midnight ere they reached the door Where Cinderella dwelt, Who vainly strove to veil her heart And hide the joy she felt. The sisters rushed into the hall And sought, with vain ado, To press and pinch and crowd their feet Into the fair shoe. Till Cinderella, all the while Demurely standing by, Now on the royal messenger Cast an appealing eye. The mute request with curling lip The tittering sisters see, But soon to wonder and amaze Was turned their scornful glee. With perfect ease she slides her foot Into the fairy shoe, Then, blushing, from her folded vest Its little partner drew. When, lo! soft music filled the air, Resplendent lustre shone; The fairy comes to claim her charge And lead her to a throne. And âNe'er forget, my child,â she said, âIn sorrow's darkest hour That unseen guardians still are nigh To aid thee with their power: âAnd often in yon glittering court Recall my last behest, For pleasure's self pursued too far Shall lose its sweetest zest. Then count the moments as they pass And heed their warning chime, Nor ever in life's mazy dance Forget the flight of time.â 1848. THE SLEEPING BEAUTY. âA tale of forests and enchantments drear.â Il Penseroso. Sister, 't is the noon of night!â Let us, in the web of thought, Weave the threads of ancient song, From the realms of Fairie brought. Thou shalt stain the dusky warp In nightshade wet with twilight dew; I, with streaks of morning gold, Will strike the fabric through and through. PART I. Where a lone castle by the sea Upreared its dark and moldering pile, Far seen, with all its frowning towers, For many and many a weary mile; The wild waves beat the castle walls And bathed the rock with ceaseless showers, The winds roared hoarsely round the pile, And moaned along its moldering towers. Within those wide and echoing halls, To guard her from a fatal spell, A maid, of noble lineage born, Was doomed in solitude to dwell. With portents dark and omens dire, The orphan's natal day began, As warring destinies conspire Her charmÃ¨d life to bless or ban. Four Fairies graced the infant's birth With fame and beauty, wealth and power; A fifth, by one fell stroke, reversed The magic splendors of her dower: If e'er a spindle's shining steel Should pierce the maiden's lily hand, A solemn trance her eyes should seal In sleep's forlorn, enchanted land: A hundred years her soul should stray In far-off shadow-lands of dream, Till, warm beneath love's kindling ray, It opened to the morning's beam. In olden times the tale had birth, By wandering minstrels told of yore, Whose names have perished from the earth,â Whose legends live in fairy lore. The wild waves beat the castle wall, And bathed the rock with ceaseless showers; Dark, heaving billows plunge and fall In whitening foam beneath the towers. There, rocked by winds and lulled by waves, In youthful grace the maiden grew, And from her solitary dreams A sweet and pensive pleasure drew. Yet often, from her lattice high, She gazed athwart the gathering night To mark the sea-gulls wheeling by, And longed to follow in their flight. One winter night, beside the hearth She sat and watched the smoldering fire, While now the tempest seemed to lull, And now the winds rose high and higher, Strange sounds are heard along the wall, Dim faces glimmer through the gloom, And still mysterious voices call, And shadows flit from room to room: Till, bending o'er the dying brands, She chanced a sudden gleam to see; She turned the sparkling embers o er, And lo! she finds a golden key! Lured on, as by an unseen hand, She roamed the castle o'er and o'er,â Through many a darkling chamber sped, And many a dusky corridor: And still, through unknown, winding ways She wandered on for many an hour, For gallery still to gallery leads, And tower succeeds to tower. Oft, wearied with the steep ascent, She lingered on her lonely way, And paused beside the pictured walls, Their countless wonders to survey. At length, upon a narrow stair That wound within a turret high, She saw a little low-browed door, And turned, her golden key to try; Slowly, beneath her trembling hand, The bolts recede, and, backward flung, With harsh recoil and sullen clang, The door upon its hinges swung. There, in a little moonlit room, She sees a weird and withered crone, Who sat and spun amid the gloom, And turned her wheel with drowsy drone. With mute amaze and wondering awe, A passing moment stood the maid, Then, entering at the narrow door, More near the mystic task surveyed. She saw her twine the flaxen fleece, She saw her draw the flaxen thread, She viewed the spindle's shining point, And, pleased, the novel task surveyed. A sudden longing seized her breast To twine the fleece,âto turn the wheel: She stretched her lily hand, and pierced Her finger with the shining steel! Slowly her heavy eyelids close, She feels a drowsy torpor creep From limb to limb, till every sense Is locked in an enchanted sleep. A dreamless slumber, deep as night, In deathly trance her senses locked. At once, through all its massive vaults And gloomy towers, the castle rocked. The beldame roused her from her lair, And raised on high a mournful wail,â A shrilly scream that seemed to float A requiem on the dying gale. âA hundred years shall pass,â she said, âEre those blue eyes behold the morn,â Ere these deserted halls and towers Shall echo to a bugle-horn; âA hundred Norland winters pass, While drenching rains and drifting snows Shall beat against the castle walls, Nor wake thee from thy long repose. âA hundred times the golden grain Shall wave beneath the harvest moon, Twelve hundred moons shall wax and wane Ere yet thine eyes behold the sun!â She ceased; but still the mystic rhyme The long-resounding aisles prolong, And all the castle's echoes chime In answering cadence to her song. She bore the maiden to her bower, An ancient chamber, wide and low, Where golden sconces from the wall A faint and trembling lustre throw; A silent chamber, far apart, Where strange and antique arras hung, That waved along the moldering walls, And in the gusty night-wind swung. She laid her on her ivory bed, And gently smoothed each snowy limb, Then drew the curtain's dusky fold To make the entering daylight dim. PART II. And all around, on every side, Throughout the castle's precincts wide, In every bower and hall, All slept: the warder in the court, The figures on the arras wrought, The steed within his stall. No more the watch-dog bayed the moon, The owlet ceased her boding tune, The raven on his tower, All, hushed in slumber still and deep, Enthralled in an enchanted sleep, Await the appointed hour. A pathless forest, wild and wide, Engirt the castle's inland side, And stretched for many a mile; So thick the deep, impervious screen, Its topmost towers were dimly seen Above the moldering pile. So high the ancient cedars sprung, So far aloft their branches flung, So close the covert grew, No foot its silence could invade, No eye could pierce its depths of shade, Or see the welkin through. Yet oft, as from some distant mound, The traveler cast his eyes around O'er wold and woodland gray, He saw, as by the glimmering light Of moonbeams, on a misty night, A castle far away. All desolate and drear it stood Within the wild and tangled wood, 'Mid gloomy foss and fell; And oft the maiden's form did seem To mingle with a champion's dream, As Gothic legends tell. Long ere the hundred years had passed, Brave knights, with vigil and with fast, Essayed to break the thrall; Till, in the old romantic time Of minstrel and ProvenÃ§al rhyme, And Amadis de Gaul, A paladin from holy land, With helm and hauberk, spear and brand, And high, untarnished crest, By visions of enchantment led, Hath vowed the magic maze to tread, And break her charmÃ¨d rest. As in the Valley of St. John, The bold de Vaux defied alone The mighty elfin powers, And sought to gain the enchanted mound, And break the spell that darkly bound Its battlements and towers,â So, like that knight of Triermain, He came through Saracenic Spain O'er deserts waste and wide; No dangers daunt, no toils can tire; With throbbing heart and soul on fire He seeks his sleeping bride. He gains the old, enchanted wood, Where never mortal footsteps trod, He pierced its tangled gloom; A chillness loads the lurid air, Where baleful swamp-fires gleam and glare His pathway to illume. Well might the warrior's courage fail, Well might his lofty spirit quail, On that enchanted ground; No open foeman meets him there, But, borne upon the murky air, Strange horror broods around! At every turn his footsteps sank 'Mid tangled boughs and mosses dank, For long and weary hours,â Till issuing from the dangerous wood, The castle full before him stood, With all its flanking towers! The moon a paly lustre sheds; Resolved, the grass-grown court he treads; The gloomy portal gained, He crossed the threshold's magic bound, He paced the hall, where all around A deathly silence reigned. No fears his venturous course could stay,â Darkling he groped his dreary way,â Up the wide staircase sprang: It echoed to his mailÃ¨d heel; With clang of arms and clash of steel The silent chambers rang. He sees a glimmering taper gleam Far off, with faint and trembling beam, Athwart the midnight gloom: Then first his soul confessed a fear, As with slow footsteps drawing near, He gained the lighted room. And now the waning moon was low, The perfumed tapers faintly glow, And, by their dying gleam, He raised the curtain's dusky fold, And lo! his charmÃ¨d eyes behold The lady of his dream! As violets peep from wintry snows, Slowly her heavy lids unclose, And gently heaves her breast; But all unconscious was her gaze, Her eye with listless languor strays From brand to plumy crest: A rising blush begins to dawn Like that which steals at early morn Across the eastern sky; And slowly, as the morning broke, The maiden from her trance awoke Beneath his ardent eye! As the first kindling sunbeams threw Their level light athwart the dew, And tipped the hills with flame, The silent forest-boughs were stirred With music, as from bee and bird A mingling murmur came. From out its depths of tangled gloom There came a breath of dewy bloom. And, from the valleys dim, A cloud of fragrant incense stole, As if each violet breathed its soul Into that floral hymn. Loud neighed the steed within his stall, The cock crowed on the castle wall, The warder wound his horn; The linnet sang in leafy bower, The swallows, twittering from the tower, Salute the rosy morn. But fresher than the rosy morn, And blither than the bugle-horn, The maiden's heart doth prove, Who, as her beaming eyes awake, Beholds a double morning break,â The dawn of light and love! 1848.</field>
