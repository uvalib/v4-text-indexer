      <field name="fulltext">THE AMERICAN WAR, A POEM; IN SIX BOOKS. ADVERTISEMENT. In the following Work, I have studiously avoided entering into political disquisitions; arraigning neither the conduct of the ministry, nor the resolutions of the continental leaders, in this unhappy contest with the North American colonies. My design has been to relate authenticated facts, with candid observations on the bravery displayed on either side. It is well known that in civil commotions, the most inveterate resentment takes place, and that too much mischief hath been already done by political investigations, and misrepresentations of facts; which like so many brands thrown into a kindling fire, have raised the flame of civil dissension to such an alarming height, and been the fatal causes of so much outrage, and hostile devastation, as to render the breach almost irreparable: but let us hope the time is not far distant, when the powerful motives of religion, language, consanguinity, commerce, and mutual interest, will once more unite us, against the perfidious Family Compact of the House of Bourbon. BOOK I. THE ARGUMENT. The exordium. The emigration to the continent: Transactions with the Indian nations, and Great Britain: The royal charter granted by King William III: Complaints from the continent; stamp-act repeal'd; fray in Boston; smuggling act made, and the tumults which ensued. Tea destroyed in Boston harbour: General Gage sent with 4000 to shut up the port of Boston. Restriction of the fishery: Falmouth burnt: The men of Boston disarmed: The first general congress, and continental preparation for war: The expedition to Lexington, skirmishes, and retreat to Boston; the Town invested; ingress, and egress, forbid: Skirmishes in different places; expeditions of Colonel Easton Allen, &amp;c. to various parts; the provincials beat the savages, and advance to Canada: The Generals Howe, Burgoyne, and Clinton, arrive with reinforcements: The battle of Bunker's Hill, and its consequences. Of arms I sing, and trans-Atlantic war, Where, oft amidst the desolating jar, Once friendly thousands, meet as mortal foes! And various great accumulating woes Spread discontent; making the breach more wide; Whilst to the field, on each contending side Relations march, and brothers may be found In hostile ranks, disputing for the ground! Political discussions I disclaim; Historic truth is my determin'd aim. Through the whole work I shall not introduce 'Gainst either side, illiberal abuse; Shall no degrading epithets bestow; Unprejudic'd the narrative shall flow: Shall in a manner most impartial tell Th' events of war, without a parallel; Who plann'd, who fought, who bled, and bravely fell. Come Clio, thy strong inspiration bring; Through the grand theme assist me, whilst I sing Civil commotions! terrible alarms! Great Britain 'gainst a continent in arms! A war, in which Great Britain's self must feel Each hurtful ball, and the deep-wounding steel; To suit the subject, may my diction flow, Nervous, sublime, and full of martial glow. Forward to look, an awful scene appears, To trace the tumult through revolving years; The vernal fields deform'd with human gore, And wintry snows with blood empurpled o'er; Where, ruin seems t' advance with equal stride, Towards the conqu'ring and the vanquish'd side Thou great eternal source of light and life; (Sole arbiter of this destructive strife) Look down in mercy on each threaten'd land; Unite us in an amicable band; Send forth thy fiat, speak us into peace, And bid fraternal devastation cease. From first to last, whatever we design, All must submit to Providence divine. If heav'n decrees the natives must be sent From hence, to explore the northern continent, Wisdom will so direct the ways of man, That he shall execute the destin'd plan. When Charles the First o'er Britain's land bore sway, Some thousands sail'd across th' Atlantic sea, And found the shores by savages possest, Who often put their manhood to the test: They persever'd, by Providence sustain'd, Built forts, and towns, and ample footing gain'd; As they increas'd they wider spread around; With great expence of blood maintain'd the ground: With Indian chiefs, and tribes, intent on peace, They oft had talks to make the slaughter cease; Where they agreed to smooth each hostile frown, And lay the hatchet and the musket down: Not long the colonists could peace enjoy, Some sad mischance wou'd all their hopes destroy, And urge them on reluctantly to jar, 'Midst all the horrors of a butch'ring war! Sometimes victorious, sometimes full of woe, And forc'd to flee before the scalping foe! Through near a century they boldly strove, And ev'ry savage nation backward drove; At length kind Providence their efforts blest, And gave the conscientious exiles rest: The colonies throughout the continent, Increas'd in numbers, and grew opulent; But chiefly Massachusets, which at length, For elbow-room began t'exert its strength; Pray'rs for defence, and great complaints were sent 'Gainst their proceedings, from the continent; And now the dreaded day of reck'ning came, When Massachusets suffer'd courtly blame: The Vide the different accounts of the emigration to, and taking possession of the continent of North America; and of that part of it, Massachusets, Connecticut, and New Hampshire in particular. reprimand they with reluctance took, And the restraint annex'd could never brook: Oft Britain threaten'd, and with pow'rful hand, She seiz'd at length the charter of the land: But, when for their deliv'rance Nassau came, (Highly they reverence the monarch's name) On Massachusets Bay the king bestow'd A royal charter, from which charter flow'd A great advantage to th' inhabitants; Including too all future emigrants. Amply t' enumerate each fatal cause, From which this dread wide-wasting tumult rose, Page after page voluminous wou'd rise, And swell the work beyond a common size; From fears and jealousies, on both sides, grew Th' unnat'ral war, which we at present rue! Some acts the British legislature made, Which much restrain'd the freedom of their trade; They struggled, and complain'd; the throne address'd; Got laws made void, still thought themselves oppress'd; And 'gainst the ministry so far prevail'd, The most disgustful stamp-act was repeal'd: In the mean time another dreadful cause, To make the breach more wide, in Boston rose! Ever regretted be that fatal This most unfortunate affair happened on the fifth of March 1770, between a party of the troops, and a body of the townsmen, in which Mr. Gray, at whose rope-walk the quarrel first began, and three other men were killed, and several dangerously wounded. day, The troops and townsmen met in mortal fray! When, in the midst of that lamented strife, Four men of Boston were depriv'd of life! And when they heard an act was lately made, Concerning slaughter in the smuggling trade; Th' offender was permitted to appeal, The culprit, and the witness, both must sail To Britain's distant shore, and wait th' event Of the transactions on the continent; Like as when oil on kindling fire is thrown, By blust'ring winds to dreadful fury blown, So Warren's rhetoric at Fanueil Hall, Inflam'd them loudly for revenge to call: So pow'rful on their minds th' oration wrought, The major part the wild infection caught. Now freighted ships were sent from Britain's shore, With tea, deliver'd from the East India store, The colonists seem'd all resolv'd to be As heretofore, from ev'ry duty free; This innovation they cou'd not endure, Determin'd in that point to be secure: The men of Boston most outragious grew, And This happened on the 16th of December 1773, and was carried into execution by a vast number of people, disguised like Mohawk Indians; who were left at liberty to do as they thought proper, without the least molestation from the âmilitary force on shore, or the naval power in the harbours;â or any interposition of âlegal authority.â They flung overboard, from several vessels, 342 chests of tea, without doing the least damage to the ships, or any other property. Although the other colonies did not follow the example of the Massachusets, yet a disuse of tea, and a general prohibition of it through the continent, was the consequence. overboard th' East Indian produce threw! This most unwarrantable mode they took, The legislature cou'd not overlook; But thus insulted, rouz'd, an act was made, Which put a stop to their lucrative trade; And with four thousand forces Gage was sent, To shut the June the 1st 1774 Boston harbour was blocked up by General Gage, according to an act of the British parliament. port, and check the continent, Which seem'd on gen'ral insurrection bent. Firm they united, and a compact In June 1774 they made a solemn league and covenant; and in November 1774 made a general non-importation agreement. made, In British articles no more to trade; No cargoes wou'd permit of any sort, To sail from thence for any British port. Both Britain, and America, had foes, Which brought on them accumulated woes; Both were deceiv'd, abus'd, and either side, On trans-Atlantic friends too much rely'd. Some fatal cause continu'd to arise, Discord to sow, t' obstruct a compromise; The men of Massachusets scorn'd to hide Their sentiments, and Britain's troops defy'd; The colonists look'd forward, and began A preparation for the destin'd plan; Frequent they met in arms, and exercis'd, And with precaution ev'ry thing devis'd: From first to last, with one great point in view, More strong and fit for insurrection grew; Both sides indignant rouz'd, and Britain seem'd To claim a right to be superior deem'd: The colonists with a contracted brow, Wou'd not superiority allow: As North America so distant lay, Three thousand miles across th' Atlantic sea; Confiding in their numbers, they combin'd, To try Great Britain's utmost strength inclin'd: With diligence, and care, they daily wrought, And military stores to Concord brought; Intending there to lay provisions in, That when their insurrection should begin, They might from thence obtain a large supply For all, who should to their assistance fly: And now they openly avow'd th' intent; Their deputies to gen'ral September 1775, the first general congress was held at Philadelphia. congress sent! T' increase the kindling flame, an act In March 1775, the Restraining Bill passed both houses. was made, T' obstruct their fish'ry, and restrain their trade! By this some thousands daily were maintain'd: But from th' employment totally restrain'd; Which made no difference 'twixt friend, or foe; For livelyhood, uncertain where to go: They ruminated on the sad event; Gloomy! distress'd! and full of discontent! They join'd th' insurgents in the common cause; And added thousands to Britannia's foes!

The colonists dispers'd, and distant fled, Th' advancing regulars to Concord sped; There, they (th' insurgents deep-laid schemes to marr) Destroy'd provisions, and the stores for war: To arms the colonists by thousands ran, And first at Concord Bridge the fray began; Sometimes they distant fought, sometimes a few, With resolution near each other drew: Howard press'd on (as if he knew no fear) And singled out a British grenadier; His threat'ning attitude the Briton ey'd, And with a frown the colonist defy'd; With mortal ire each other they survey'd, Took certain aim, and with an hasty tread, Fierce they advanc'd, and both together fir'd, Both fell, and both the combatants expir'd. On all sides the provincials pour'd around, And in their turn the regulars gave ground; Forc'd to retreat, and in their flight destroy'd, From houses, hedges, ditches, walls annoy'd; In front, and rear, on either flank engag'd, Oft sternly turn'd, and fierce for vengeance rag'd; Again o'erpower'd, and driv'n retrograde, With fire and sword, they dreadful havoc made; And as they fought th' assailants to repel, Men It was reported that Isaac Gardner, Esq; of Brookline, was then returning from a journey, and killed in the retreat., women, children, 'midst the tumult fell; To Lexington their course they briskly bent, Harrass'd, fatigu'd We are told that the Rev'd Mr. Peyson, of Chelsea near Boston, headed a few provincials in the confusion; and attacked, and overpowered a small party with provisions and ammunition., their powder nearly spent: Meanwhile the gallant A report prevailed, that Colonel Gardner, of the New Hampshire militia, with 700 men, made a sudden attack from an ambuscade on Earl Percy's party; by they were soon routed, and dispersed, and his lordship advanced with two field-pieces, to succour Colonel Smith's party; who, by this time, were harrassed on all sides, and began to be alarmed on account of their ammunition being nearly spent. Percy rouz'd to arms, Warn'd by the continental loud alarms; Press'd forward with nine hundred vet'rans brave, To check his foes, his hard-press'd friends to save. Yet unassisted, in a dismal plight, The British troops maintain'd a running fight; Smith, Pitcairne, Bernard, Souter, parsons brave, Expos'd themselves their harrass'd troops to save: Where danger call'd, the British leaders flew, And did whatever mortal men cou'd do: With little hope that action to survive; Firmly determin'd to the last to strive: They chear'd the troops, who fiercely wish'd to close In open field, and grapple with their foes; At length the bellowing engines of the war, Proclaim'd brave Percy coming from afar: They chearful, briskly march'd o'er hostile ground, Well pleas'd, and listen'd to the charming sound; Which more melodious grew, advancing near, Discordant roar'd, and fill'd their foes with fear: They join'd their friends with an exulting shout; Halted, reviv'd, and gloomy fac'd about. Imbody'd now, they boldly stood their ground, And gather'd up their wounded friends around; Again they march'd, and oft their foes came near, Press'd on their flanks, and threaten'd in the rear; As oft they were with slaught'ring loss repell'd, And by the cannon at a distance held; They under covert ran from place to place, And thus continu'd a vexatious chace, Until the British forces reach'd the shore, Defended by Great Britain's naval roar; Hoping a day wou'd ample vengeance yield, When they shou'd grapple in an open field. The colonists for slain relations mourn'd; And for revenge with great impatience burn'd: For insurrection ripe they spread th' alarm, Which operated like a potent charm! As when a shock electrical is giv'n (To ev'ry person quick in contact driv'n) From town to town the fascination flew, And ev'ry colony tumultuous grew: To arms! to arms! was now the gen'ral dry, To arms, and war, th' indignant people fly: Their own importance they perceiv'd at length, Like a young lion rouz'd, they felt their strength: The scholars, tradesmen, merchants, take the field; The burnish'd weapons of destruction wield; Revenge, and freedom, rustic bosoms warms, They launch the tomahawk from nervous arms; The foresters now glow with warlike flame; Their rifled tubes prepare for noble game; Panting for same, they ruminate on war, And strive to strike the destin'd marks from far; High-mettled youths the fiery steeds bestride, Teach them to stand, and scorn to start aside, When drums, fifes, trumpets sound, and shouting foes Range front to front, and in th' encounter close, When fulminating cannons banish day, Terrific roar, and sweep the ranks away: All strove to make themselves completely skill'd, In ev'ry brisk manÅuvre of the field: The litt'rate orators (with war in view) The kindling flames to greater fury blew: Amongst the rest, the rev'rend clergy cease To preach the gospel of eternal peace! They mount the pulpits, help to spread th' alarms, Widen the breach, and loudly call to arms; In arms they rose t' oppose Great Britain's laws, Religion's preachers sanctify'd the cause! From distant parts they came, and ev'ry man, With Indignation straight to Boston ran! Corps after corps, blockading it, sat down, Till sixty thousand They were headed by the Generals Putnam, Pribble, Heath, Thomas, Ward, Prescott, and others of inferior rank. gather'd near the town; For war equip'd, they formidable grew, And round the place a living rampart drew! For an attack appearing much too strong, From Roxbury, to Mystick, stretch'd along; They'd not permit the town to be supply'd, Ingress, and egress, Gen'ral Gage deny'd: Horrid forebodings fill'd th' invested place; Distress, want, famine, star'd them in the face! The troops, and tars, expecting an attack, Tho' few, prepar'd to drive th' assailants back; Detachments came at times from various parts, And ships of war, which chear'd their drooping hearts; But yet sufficient cause for fears remain, Lest sixty thousand shou'd their force disdain, Shou'd over-leap their works, 'midst hostile roar, And like a tempest sweep them from the shore! Doubtless they had a rough irruption plann'd, But Gage held such a precious pledge in hand, More than ten thousand to themselves ally'd; A large, and well-built trading town beside; Tho' rouz'd in arms, they trembled for the lives Of children, parents, friends, and dearer wives. Tho' from the gen'ral storm this held them back, They often dar'd the troops, and tars t' attack; Worsted, and vex'd, and full of sad dismay, They sev'ral times discomfitted gave way! And seldom cou'd in skirmishes According to the public accounts, the British forces, and seamen, were roughly handled in their attempts on Grape Island, Chelsea, Hog Island, and at the Light House, which the provincials had demolished, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. and seemed to be the greatest sufferers, in the loss of killed and wounded. prevail, When the rough colonists wou'd them assail! Their rifle-men at length a terror grew, And oft an officer, or centry slew; Now Clinton, Howe, May 26th 1775, the reinforcement with the Generals Howe, Burgoyne, and Clinton, arrived at Boston. In May 1775, Crown Point and Ticonderoga, Major Skeene, &amp;c. were taken by the provincials; the second general congress was held at Philadelphia; the congress addressed the Canadians; and established paper currency. Burgoyne, and many more, Of Britain's leaders, gain'd the Atlantic shore; Artill'ry, horse, and infantry arriv'd; This reinforcement Gage's hopes reviv'd. Rage, and distraction, ev'ry where prevail'd, And slaughter seem'd upon the land intail'd! Friends, fathers, brothers, in the pangs of death, Bequeath this legacy with dying breath; Ample revenge these bleeding wounds require: Revenge, they cry! and with a frown expire! Mournful survivors swear they soon will have Ample revenge; or follow to the grave! Rough was the service, and the contest wide; Fortune alternate smil'd on either side: The diff'rent scenes of action distant lay, Sometimes on land, and sometimes on the sea: Detachments were to various places sent, And war, and tumult, fill'd the continent! With They marched with a detachment of about 250 men, from Massachusetts, and Connecticut; and took possession of Ticonderoga, and Crown-Point, and being joined by others, advanced to the confines of Canada. When Captain Allen was taken, there were 15 killed, and about 40 made prisoners, and brought to England.

Allen came; He pass'd the frontiers of Canadia's land, And fell a captive into Carleton's hand: Two British forts they seiz'd, and made their own, Before they were by Campbell overthrown. Field, Fleming, Lewis, were to war inclin'd; Began their march, for Canada design'd; But intercepted near Ohio's flood, The pass was purchas'd with provincial blood: Mingoes, and Shawanese, (rough Indian foes), Tawas, and Delaware's, to battle rose; Four hours the savages maintain'd their ground; The following is the provincial account of the killed and wounded, in the above battle: killed, Colonels Charles Lewis, John Field; Captains John Murray, Rene Clenchan, Samuel Wilson, James Ward; Lieutenant Hugh Allen; Ensigns Cantiff, Bracken, and 44 privates: wounded Colonel William Fleming, Captains John Dickenson, Thomas Bluford, John Skidman; Lieutenants Goldman, Robinson, Lard, and Vance; and 79 privates: total killed and wounded 140, and Colonel Fleming, and others, since dead of their wounds. Sad havoc made, almost with vict'ry crown'd! Their resolution now began to slack, Their fire abated, and the tribes fell back: The colonists on all sides forward push'd, And with fresh vigor to the battle rush'd; From post to post compell'd them to retreat; Drove the main corps, and made the rout complete. Meanwhile, the British forces held at bay, Coop'd up in Boston, there inactive lay; But reinforc'd, and scorning dull repose, They rouz'd t' attack their bold surrounding foes. Determin'd now their enemies t' offend, Beyond their former bounds their lines t' exend; The chiefs resolv'd to seize on Bunker's hill, Which amply prov'd their military skill. Ere the detachment to the place was sent, Their foes advanc'd to frustrate their intent; For under covert of the friendly night, Warren had seiz'd, and fortify'd that height: The colonists must be dislodg'd from thence, Whatever was the dreadful consequence; About two thousand were embark'd to go 'Gainst the redoubt, and formidable foe: The Lively's, Falcon's, Fame's, and Glasgow's roar, Cover'd their landing on the destin'd shore; They form'd, and part towards the trenches sped; Th' intrepid Howe those vet'ran forces led. The trenches, and redoubt, were trebly mann'd, Howe wisely made a necessary stand; For reinforcements sent, soon as he view'd The well-arm'd, congregating multitude. We may conclude he thus the troops address'd, (Whose flagging spirits seem'd to be depress'd), March boldly on, your cause is just, and good, Th' insurgents have the parliament withstood, The legislature's acts have set aside, And have Great Britain's martial pow'r defy'd! The British chiefs began to pant for fame, Their souls were full of emulating flame; Prepar'd t' advance to stem the growing tide Of thousands, rushing in on ev'ry side. Well pleas'd, the gen'ral look'd around, and saw The sympathetic manly martial glow: He ceas'd, and fac'd towards the strong redoubt, The troops sent forth a loud approving shout; Not that exulting shout, when they advance 'Gainst Spanish foes, or vet'ran troops of France; But on they march'd, to give the dreadful storm; And do whatever mortals could perform! On Boston's shore, Burgoyne and Clinton stood, And ev'ry movement of the forces view'd, Prepar'd to speed their timely aid to lend, Or from the spot destructive war to send; They learn'd that Charles-town must be wrapp'd in flame, Or Britain's troops retire with tarnish'd fame. Another corps 'gainst Charles-town made a stand, With good provincial troops completely mann'd; Here, the firm animating Pigot fought, His warlike flame the gallant leaders caught; The privates felt its force, from man to man, T' excel in fight an emulation ran. They steadily advanc'd, on conquest bent; A mortal show'r of lead incessant sent; Th' Americans likewise for conquest burn'd, And a like mortal show'r of lead return'd; Maintain'd the town, and resolutely strove To harrass Howe, as up the hill he drove; But vex'd by bursting shells, and show'rs of balls, Or crush'd by falling roofs, or batter'd walls, They felt discomfiture; and now there came A flight of shells, fraught with destructive flame! A scene ensu'd might fill the brave with dread; From house, to house, the conflagration spread: Ear-piercing shrieks; heart-rending growns, and cries; And terrifying shouts of vict'ry rise: Amidst the desolating wild uproar, Forth rush'd th' inhabitants from ev'ry door: To sex, nor age, no place an azyle yields; In crouds they ran, and sought th' adjacent fields: Swifter than they, the rapid bullets flew, And some ill-fated persons overthrew: From hope excluded, in a wild dismay, The town untenable, the troops gave way: To Bunker's hill they fled, and in their rear, In close pursuit, the regulars drew near: The trenches gain'd, they fac'd, and made a stand, And intermix'd with Warren's chosen band; Follow'd by Pigot with a martial frown, Wrapp'd in the vapour of the burning town. For battle warm'd with military skill, Howe led two thousand up the dang'rous hill, Where hostile parties under covert lay, T' impede his march, and strike with cold dismay. Now, Warren frowning rouz'd, (erect he stood), From right to left, his must'ring forces view'd; From man to man, he saw with great delight, Resentment flash'd, with readiness to fight: Prepar'd to speak, the troops attentive hung On the persuasive accents of his tongue. Now, my brave friends, your innate worth display: Great Britain's regulars advance this way: Soldiers, and sailors, seem dispos'd around, To drive us from this advantageous ground: Th' artill'ry's landed on th' adjacent shore, Their naval thunder hath begun to roar: On Boston's shore their batteries they ply; From whence the show'rs of shells incessant fly: Already Charles-town at their mercy lies; The lambent flames, and clouds of smoke arise: That obstacle no longer proves a bar; And this way comes the tumult of the war. Tho' Gage ten thousand well-train'd troops may boast, Join'd by the British fleet t' infest our coast; Tho' 'mongst their chiefs, (vet'rans in war renown'd), Howe, Clinton, Pigot, and Burgoyne, are found; Tho' Pitcairne's, Montcrief's, Abercrombie's name, Tho' gallant Percy's, swells the list of fame; Tho' Sherwin, Addison, Page, Bruce, and Small, Attend on Howe, at honour's glorious call; Tho' Williams, Campbell, Smith, with many more, Skilful in war, now tread th' Atlantic shore; Tho' steady Carleton widely spreads alarms, And Dunmore our Virginian negroes arms; I see no cause for fear my friends, since we Have Putnam, Pribble, Washington, and Lee; Arnold, Montgom'ry, Gates, Macpherson bold, Already in the list of fame inroll'd; Lamb, Wooster, Schuyler, Hendricks, Cheeseman, go With these, in Canada, to fight the foe; We've Woodford 'gainst Dunmore; we've Gardner too, Who stands determin'd now within your view: Ward, Prescott, Thomas, Heath, and more beside, Will stand the test whene'er in battle try'd. I grant, it may prove difficult to bar The dreadful progress of Great Britain's war! Whatever single state provokes her frown, Shrinks from her war; and trembles for the crown: United France, and Spain, have often felt The vengeance, which her troops and tars have dealt: But then, we sent her from our friendly shores, Provisions, timber, ships, and naval stores; And in her quarrel, (on the continent), We risk'd our lives; our blood, and treasure spent: Now, we are torn from her dismember'd side; Twelve rising states in arms, her claims deny'd; And her (European) neighb'ring states around, In private wish we were with conquest crown'd; Will fraudful smile on her, will us befriend; And under covert their assistance lend. Like to th' invaders of our native land, We, station'd here, on the defence to stand; From Wales, Great Britain, and Hibernia sprung; Our nerves for war, with equal vigor strung: Our hearts as firm as theirs, our blood the same, Which swells our veins, and animates each frame: Th' event with perseverance let us wait, Some wish'd-for change, a terrible defeat; Or providential stroke of mighty fate, May all our daring foes intimidate: To Heav'n Pointing to the ensign, flying over head: on one side of which was this motto, in English, âAn appeal to Heaven:â and on the other side, in Latin, âQui transtulit, sustinet.â appealing, we for succour fly, And for success on Providence rely; I doubt not but we shall experience yet, âQui nos transtulit, semper sustinet.â Altho' shou'd be by ruling Heav'n decreed, We shall at present unsuccessful bleed; I forward look compos'd, and firmly trust, When we are mingled with our kindred dust, 'Tis his decree who rules above the skies, We shall in time a mighty It is well known, these sentiments, and expectations, are entertained by the inhabitants in general, in the North American colonies; and as they were looking forward to that period, no doubt they now thought a fair opportunity offered to commence their aggrandizement, and lay the foundation of their expected empire. empire rise. Shou'd Providence ordain that we must fall, Let us with chearfulness obey the call; In death, we shall some consolation have, We sink with honour to the silent grave; They shouted loud, and made this short reply, We will be free, or will with honour die. Meanwhile, the British chiefs the troops inspir'd, Examples rouz'd, and exhortations fir'd: And tho' short time in words they chose to waste, As up the hill they press'd, with martial haste, Whilst they surmounted every hostile bar, Their deeds aloud proclaim'd them form'd for war. The charging regulars still nearer drew 'Gainst front, and flank, and hot the battle grew: Whilst Britain's ships of war maintain'd the fight, Directing all their fire 'gainst Bunker's height. On churches Vide General Burgoyne's letter, on the battle, to his nephew Lord Stanley: dated Boston, June 25th 1775: which will authenticate the relation of many passages, which occurred, on that memorable day. spires, and lofty domes around, On hills adjacent, and each rising ground, Thronging spectators, anxious thousands stood, And lost in grand suspense the battle view'd: A scene of carnage! obstinate the fight! Tremendous, pleasing, horrid, glorious sight! Gigantic terrors at the breast-work frown'd: Solemn, and slow, advancing o'er the ground; The regulars drew near in awful form, Like Jove attended by a thunder-storm: They mov'd majestic in a sulph'rous cloud; Britain's brazen engines bellowing loud; At the redoubt appear'd no sign of fear; They brought their brazen thunder well to bear; On rough defence seem'd resolutely bent; And down the hill a storm of iron sent; Long they continu'd thus, and either side, Howitzers, musquetry, and cannon ply'd. Whilst 'gainst great obstacles the Britons found, They strove t' advance, and gain superior ground; Doubtless, each soldier thought he shou'd contend With an acquaintance, brother, or a friend! At least, 'gainst countrymen shou'd lift his hand, Sprung from Great Britain's, or Hibernia's land! Their resolution stagger'd, when they saw The danger still more formidable grow! And found they must themselves long time expose To the brisk fire of their well-shelter'd foes! From rifled tubes, to strike the chiefs intent, With deadly aim they leaden mischief sent; Whilst in conjunction, their artill'ry made 'Gainst Britain's troops, a mortal cannonade; Who, quite expos'd, without the batt'ring aid, And cover of their cannon were dismay'd: Thus circumstanc'd, the troops had like t' have fled From the dread spot, where Abercrombie led: Nor did they seem to make a firmer stand, Where Howe, th' intrepid Howe, bore chief command! From flank to flank, his anxious looks he cast, From corps to corps, with fearless haste he past; Travers'd the line of hottest hostile fire; And by example, strove to reinspire With resolution, those who seem'd dismay'd, Irresolute, and ready to recede. Small, Sherwin, Page, and Addison, were found, Where duty call'd, and threat'ning danger frown'd; Both exhortations, and examples fail'd, A cooling tremor Britain's troops assail'd! They halted in suspense, at length gave way! Regardless of the honour of the day! When the provincial officers beheld The royal forces stagger'd and repel'd; Elate with hope, almost with vict'ry crown'd; They thus address'd their troops which stood around: They slack their fire! and seem'd to stand at gaze! Like those, whom thunder strikes with vast amaze! Mark how they thin! on ev'ry side they bleed! Their leaders calls, nor glory's impulse heed! Exert yourselves awhile, and on them pour Of lead, and iron mix'd, a pond'rous show'r; No time for recollection let them have, Convince them North Americans are brave. Meanwhile, the British persevering chief, Whose dauntless soul was full of poignant grief: Alone, and in the rear, retrod the ground; Oft fac'd about, and grim defiance frown'd. (So lagg'd firm Ajax in the Grecian rear, And strove to banish base desponding fear.) Howe rais'd his voice in an upbraiding tone, Will Britons flee! and leave their chief alone! Can you outlive disgrace? the brave disdain To purchase life by an ignoble stain! Shall wond'ring nations now, exulting hear The Trans-atlantics fill'd our souls with fear! Rally, return, and brisk your foes assail; You're Britain's regulars, and must prevail. Reluctant, Abercrombie join'd the rout, Halt, halt, oft call'd aloud, and fac'd about: Halt, halt, from chief to chief, flew round: Halt, said each officer, and stood his ground: Oh! shame! they cry'd, that ever shou'd be said, Great Britain's vet'rans from militia fled! And left their officers to make th' attack! Whilst they ran off or from the fight hung back We, to the post of danger first lay claim; We will stand foremost for each lev'ler's aim: We ask no more, than that you'll boldly tread The path of honour, where you see us lead: In British annals emulous to shine, They rang'd in front, a formidable line; Rush'd on, 'midst blood, sweat, dust, and smoke, and flame; And leaders in the truest sense became. Th' undaunted Pitcairne now their hopes reviv'd; With him, the gallant marine corps arriv'd: The fifty-second's grenadiers, with these, Rush'd on, the palm of victory to seize: Tho' first humanity their souls possest, And sentiments fraternal warm'd each breast; Which made them tardily advance to fight, And almost to commence inglorious flight; When they beheld their chiefs and comrades fall, And heard each leader's animating call; Saw the marines, and Pitcairne, passing by, They fac'd, and form'd, another charge to try: Returning ardor, banish'd chilling fear; The chiefs led on; and they brought up the rear: And now recover'd from their former dread, Over the wounded, dying, and the dead, They trod, and stumbled, with indignant speed; And as they saw their groaning comrades bleed; A thirst for vengeance, and desire of fame, Fill'd ev'ry soul with emulating flame. When Warren saw them face about, and form, And onward rush to give another storm; He stood alarm'd; the consequence he fear'd: Conceal'd his thoughts, and thus his forces chear'd: Again recover'd from their cold dismay, The rally'd British vet'rans move this way: At the last gasp their fainting courage lies; The warlike glance forsakes their languid eyes; Their new rekindling courage soon will fail, If you stand firm, when they the lines assail: Each face will like Medusa's front appear! And fill their wav'ring souls again with fear! From either party, as they nearer drew, Destructive show'rs of balls alternate flew: In ev'ry volley, death triumphant rode; And thro' the ranks with wasting terror strode: But for his most delicious morsels sought, Where Pigot, Howe, Warren, and Gardner fought; Where Williams, Pitcairne, Abercrombie, turn'd, He feasted there, and there the battle burn'd. When Pitcairne fell, his son advanc'd in view, Towards the spot with anxious ardor flew; Tho' rage, and love, his steps accelerate, To guard his father's life he came too late; Already, death had launch'd his mortal dart, And lodg'd the barb in the bold vet'ran's heart: Burning for vengeance, and oppress'd with grief, With filial care, he rais'd the wounded chief From blood, and dust, (as decency requir'd) And from the carnage of the field retir'd: So, stain'd with streams of warm paternal gore, Young Scipio from the field his father bore. Another son (in this unnat'ral strife) Was doom'd to see his parent robb'd of life! Whilst rushing on elate, at glory's call, With grief imbitter'd by his father's fall, The gallant Addison suspended stood; The prostrate dusty sanguin'd ruin view'd: Too late, like Pitcairne's, came his filial aid: With looks, where thoughts of vengeance were display'd, Like him (with sad regret, and tender care) He bore the lifeless body to the rear; From mangling feet the cold remains to save, With warlike pomp committed to the grave. Howe, Roden, Pigot, press'd to closest fight: Warren beheld a dread soul-harrowing sight! Observ'd his troops preparing to give way; And mark'd the growing symptoms of dismay! Aloud he call'd, rouze, and shake off your fears: Partners in fame, my friends, and volunteers; Bring no disgrace on the provincial arms; Have children, wives, and liberty no charms! Your children, wives, and friends, around us wait, Wound not their souls by shameful base retreat: Perhaps on us this day, my gallant friends, The fate of North America depends; Wou'd you outlive the fight, and see your lands, And your effects, seiz'd by the victor's hands? Stung to the quick, and full of warlike fire; We'll die they said, before we will retire: They shouted loud, and for the vict'ry burn'd; The charging regulars the shout return'd. Whilst both contending parties (in the strife) Struggled for victory, for fame, and life; Clinton with circumspection ready stood, And a large British reinforcement view'd; Who seem'd embarrass'd; scarce knew where to speed With succour, in the time of dang'rous need: Most nobly rouz'd, impatient of delay; He gain'd the shore, and led the glorious way; Instant toward the foe, their front they turn'd; Each caught the flame, and for the battle burn'd. So when Pelides saw the Grecians stand Irresolutely, on the Phrygian strand, He join'd his friends, with animating glow, Rouz'd, chear'd, and led them 'gainst th' exulting foe. Meanwhile, the first assailants, unsustain'd, 'Midst dreadful carnage, had the summit gain'd: Convinc'd they must a rapid effort make, Their honours, victory, and lives at stake. Examples drew towards the hostile fence, With more than Ciceronian eloquence Come on; come on; the mounting leaders cry'd; We come; we come; the regulars reply'd: O'er all impediments they dauntless bound With Gorgon fronts, and spread dismay around: Confusion, and dispersion, soon ensu'd, Except where Warren, and his party stood: Fierce the provincials fought, and fearless bled, Where the great oratorial Warren led: He fac'd grim danger with an heart elate; At length, a rapid ball came wing'd with fate; And cut th' intrepid rhetorician down, Scorning retreat, and panting for renown: His potent language cou'd the mind controul; Rekindle fainting courage in the soul: Cou'd make the coolest troops with ardor glow; And rush in storms of death upon the foe: With him, the spirit of the battle fled; From right to left, a consternation spread; On ev'ry side the colonists gave ground; The regulars indignant, gather'd round; O'er trenches, fences, and each palisade, A passage like an inundation made; Bore all resistance down, gain'd the redoubt, And put the firm provincial troops to rout. With conquest flush'd, with hard-earn'd vict'ry crown'd, Brave Howe; and Pigot, now possess'd the ground, The rising ground, from whence provincials fled; And up the hill the gallant Clinton led A reinforcement, which was near at hand, In hasty march from Charlestown's hostile strand; Burgoyne observant stood, ready to speed Where any shou'd a timely succour need; And ev'ry soldier long'd at honour's call, To grace with dreadful pomp his comrade's fall: Tho' for success all seemingly combin'd, With sage precaution Howe the chace declin'd; With circumspection mov'd, and wou'd not dare To hazard a defeat in Putnam's snare. From the redoubt the lines to Cambridge ran, Trench lay near trench, and man supported man; Each eminence was fortify'd around, And ambuscades possess'd the lower ground: Here Putnam, Pribble, Ward, and Thomas stay'd To check pursuit, and pour in friendly aid; Prescott and Heath were near, with all their force, T' oppose the victors in their destin'd course. The diff'rent parties seem'd resolv'd t'abide In each well-chosen post, they occupy'd; Altho' their routed friends might help require, They wou'd not pass the line of naval fire, Whilst the provincials from their late defeat, Fil'd off, and strove to make a good retreat: This to effect, they must determin'd push, As if thro' death's expanded jaws to rush! A victor foe This battle was fought on the 17th day of June 1775. By a letter from General Gage, in the London Gazette, of 25th July 1775, we are informed, âThat the troops under the command of Major General Howe, Brigadier General Pigot, Major Pitcairne, &amp;c. sent to attack the redoubt, and Charlestown, formed a body of more than 2000, with a proportion of field-artillery. The loss suffered by the British: 1 colonel, 2 majors, 7 captains, 9 lieutenants, 15 serjeants, 1 drummer, 191 rank and file, killed: and 3 majors, 27 captains, 35 lieutenants, 7 ensigns, 7 volunteers, 40 serjeants, 12 drummers, 706 rank and file, wounded.â The reports are various concerning the number of the provincials in the action, from 1500 to about 5000, and upwards, as it was observed that the defendants of the redoubt were relieved by fresh reinforcements; which appears to be confirmed, by a passage in General Burgoyne's letter to Lord Stanley, âand to the left, the enemy pouring in fresh troops by thousands over the land, &amp;c.â To the same purport, General Gage expresses himself in his letter, copied in the Gazette; viz. âthat they were perceived to be in great force, and strongly posted on the heights: a redoubt thrown up on the 16th at night, with other works full of men, defended with cannon: large columns were seen pouring in to their assistance, and that the British were engaged with above three times their number.â The provincials say, there were no more than 1500 in the redoubt and lines during the time of action. The accounts of their killed and wounded are various; from about 400 to 700, and from about 1000 to 1400: their own public account of the killed, wounded, and missing, is as follows; 105 killed and missing, 250 wounded: total, killed, missing, and wounded, 355. When they retreated, they left five pieces of cannon behind them, near one hundred dead on the field, and thirty wounded. threaten'd their broken rear; Frigates, and floating batteries, lay near, Across their path, in front, and flank, to rake, A dreadful desolating sweep to make; And cut off ev'ry hope of fresh supply, Tho' twenty thousand well arm'd friends were nigh! BOOK II. THE ARGUMENT. The expedition against Canada by Montgomery, Wooster, Arnold, &amp;c. Their march through the woods; the forts Chamblee, and St. John's, with Montreal, taken: Provision vessels intercepted on the river: The provincials march to Quebec, invest, and attack the fort: General Carleton's gallant defence. The garrison stormed, Arnold wounded, and retreating; Gen. Montgomery, Macpherson, &amp;c. killed, and the provincials driven back, with the loss of about 700. The siege, and blockade continued, Lord Dunmore's transactions in Virginia; his attack at the great bridge, near Norfolk, and repulse: The death of Capt. Fordyce: Norfolk attacked, and burnt by the British, and provincials: Lord Dunmore's retreat, with the ships of war, &amp;c. to Gwin's Island; driven from thence by the provincials, suffers in a storm, and sails for New York. Lord Petersham arrives at Quebec with 200 men; a sally made, the provincials retreat: Reinforcements arrive from the congress, and the Generals Burgoyne, Fraser, Reidesel, Philips, &amp;c. from England, with about 7000. The provincials retreat to Sorel's Banks; the Cedar's Fort taken; the battle at Trois Rivieres, General Carleton, &amp;c. continuing the chace; Montreal and Fort Chamblee retaken, St. John's burnt; all Canada evacuated; and the provincials retreat over the Lake Champlain: Generals Carleton, Burgoyne, Captain Douglas, &amp;c. prepare to follow them: The engagement on the lake, and total defeat of the provincial fleet. The progress of the British arms to check, The congress sent an army 'gainst Quebec: Montgom'ry, Wooster, Lamb, and Arnold, sped To distant dang'rous war, and fearless led Thro' vast extent of savage desert land, An indefatigable chosen band: With chearful minds (to hardships much inur'd) They cold, fatigue, and pinching want endur'd! Macpherson, Schuyler, Brown, and thousands more, With Cheeseman, Hendricks, Cooper, next explore The pathless wilds; a rugged space of ground; And hard to pass as Alpine hills are found! They travers'd gloomy unfrequented shades; Thro' dens of death, and savage ambuscades, They forward press'd, and rush'd through ev'ry bar, Against Quebec to bear the destin'd war: By the Canadians join'd, and well supply'd; 'Gainst Fort Chamblee The provincials took at Ticonderoga, Chamblee, &amp;c. 127 prisoners, a large quantity of materials for boat-building, naval stores for three vessels, 110 barrels of flour, 159 barrels of pork, 11 ditto rice, 7 ditto pease, 6 ditto butter, 50 swivels, 5 mortars, about 106 shells, 1 cohorn, 1 howitz, 500 hand grenades, 333 muskets, 6,564 cartridges, 10 tons of musket balls, 3 cart loads of flints, 114 cannons, from 6 to 24 pounders, 30 new carriages, 134 barrels of gun-powder. All these things served to feed, encourage, and supply the provincials with every thing necessary to reduce Fort St. John's, &amp;c. the forces first were try'd; This obstacle, which in their passage lay, They soon surmounted, and march'd on their way: Onward they press'd, their first grand point in view! Tho' dangers and obstructions greater grew!

The implements of death were briskly ply'd: Each other's firmness both the parties try'd: With reinforcement, Carleton strove to land, To join, and make a formidable stand; At least to throw some succours in, and try To introduce a plentiful supply: But the Green Mountaineers their station held, And the detachment from the shore The provincials say, General Carleton lost 50 men in the attempt. repel'd. Almost a certain prey to ruin left, Of ev'ry hope of succour quite bereft; Thus far outnumber'd, press'd on ev'ry side; The fort's defendants on themselves rely'd; Not to submit most resolutely bent, Till powder, ball, and ammunition spent, And pinching famine star'd them in the face, Compelling them t' evacuate The provincials say they took at Fort St. John's, which surrendered 3d Nov. 1775, a great quantity of military cloathing; 17 pieces of excellent brass artillery, 2 of them 24 pounders, and the rest field-pieces; 2 royal howitzers, several mortars, cohorns, a considerable quantity of military stores, and a number of iron cannon; 500 regulars, 100 Canadians, some of them French noblesse; and about 200 besides, at Ticonderoga, Crown Point, and Kenesborough; and speak of their own loss as small in comparison, except in the engagement with the Indians near the Ohio. the place: But ere they from the garrison march'd forth, They made their foes confess their warlike worth: Montgom'ry gen'rously bestow'd applause; Approv'd their firmness in their Sov'reign's cause The colonists advancing, persever'd, And in Montreal the flag of vict'ry rear'd; Whilst Carleton was endeav'ring to secure The royal stores, and make Quebec more sure; But in his grand attempt the Gen'ral fail'd; Again the continental They took the Gaspee armed vessel, with seven sloops and schooners, having on board Brigadier General Prescot, Captain William Dunbar, major of brigade, Captain William Gamble, quarter-master-general; Captains Anstruther, Swan, Crawford, and Harris; Lieutenant Cleveland, Ensigns Gamble, Leslie, and M'Donald: Dr. Beaumont; 150 privates; most of the 26th regiment, and the artillery; 4 cannons, 3 barrels of powder, 2,380 musket cartridges, 8 chests of arms, 200 pairs of shoes, intrenching tools, 760 barrels of flour, 26 barrels of biscuit, 675 barrels of beef, 376 barrels of butter. force prevail'd; Thro' all surrounding dangers Carleton past, And safely reach'd the garrison at last. Montgom'ry briskly march'd his destin'd course, Join'd by a fresh accumulated force, Canadians, restless, and unsatisfy'd, Came pouring in well arm'd, on ev'ry side: Like a large flood he swept, met little check; Still push'd determin'd on against Quebec.

Much better on their guard against surprise, Than watchful Argus with his hundred eyes; No incantations lull'd them to repose; In gloomy expectation of their foes; With utmost care each avenue they barr'd, Their most impetuous charges to retard. The siege commenc'd; but yet Montgom'ry made Against the fort a fruitless cannonade: To vex Quebec his war was chiefly bent, And show'rs of shells, and carcasses, were sent: Oft as the lambent flames, and smoke arose (A welcome spectacle to Carleton's foes) As oft the firm defendants of Quebec, Their pleasure damp'd, and gave the flames a check: The troops, and tars, within their storm defy'd; Their mortars, and their cannons, briskly ply'd: As masses of accumulated snow, Dissolve amidst bright Sol's meridian glow; So the provincial army, day by day, Thinn'd by The Canadians left the provincial camp in large parties. desertion, seem'd to melt away: Tho' some who were not genuine sons of Mars, Fainted amidst fatigues of dang'rous wars.

Revolving time brought on the destin'd night; The colonists About 4000 continued the siege and blockade. made ready for the fight: Before the parties to their station went, Montgom'ry anxious for that night's event; Knowing th' attempt great firmess would require, He strove t' infuse his own heroic fire: To gain that end, the forces he address'd, And to this purport thus himself express'd: Our foes as yet have 'scap'd an overthrow; To strength of walls their present safety owe: Lull'd in security our force deride; Therefore now fittest to be closely try'd: We may expect they'll stagger, and shrink back From such an unexpected rough attack: Can they our charge successfully withstand! Their works so large, the fort so weakly mann'd! Should the reverse of what we hope appear; Surely my friends no threat'ning dangers fear; Who travell'd dreary forests by my side; 'Midst hunger, cold, and hourly dangers try'd! Who left their homes, with warring hear is elate Through distant Canada to penetrate! In freedom's cause, to face grim death ye came, And through his portal rush to endless fame! The border's gain'd, supply'd with proper food, Your hopes reviv'd, your wasted strength renew'd; Like to young eagles, scorning slow delay, Onward ye push'd, to pounce upon your prey: I see you're ready, therefore need not ask, T' attempt one more laborious dang'rous task: Thro' many dangers you've unshaken past; And will not shrink from this, perhaps the last: If we this night the royal force defeat, Our enterprize would then be most complete: All Canada must next our pow'r confess: It shall, they cry'd, if Providence will bless This night's attempt; for o'er yon hostile wall, We'll force our way, or there we'll nobly fall: Around Montgom'ry look'd, well pleas'd to trace Enthusiastic glow in ev'ry face; Advance, he said, and in the list of fame, Let each man boldly strive t' insert his name; Make our foes own, whate'er th' event may be, We fought like men determin'd to be free! Th' alarm was made, and Britain's sons of Mars, In fierce conjunction, with her dauntless tars, Like growling lions, rouz'd from sweet repose, Indignant arm'd to meet their coming foes! The precious moments swiftly fled away; But Carleton stood a stranger to dismay; Serenely view'd his forces drawing near; Saw no reluctant signs of tardy fear; The chiefs advanc'd intrepidly sedate, The troops, the tars, and all appear'd elate! He thought it a good omen of success, Turn'd to the chiefs, and thus began th' address. Our force this night, the storming foes will try; On you, I can with confidence rely: CÃ¦sar wou'd smile to see you sally forth; You know your stations, and I know your worth: He thus proceeded: Britain's gallant tars Will range this night among her sons of Mars: From pole to pole much fear'd, and greatly fam'd, Ye may be aptly Boanerges nam'd: Your country claims your service on the land, Firm as the Grecian phalanx ye can stand! Behold this letter, which Montgom'ry sent; However brave, most rigid his intent! He deigns to write in terms of low disgrace, And stiles this garrison a wretched place!

His words like magic wrought; from man to man Resentment flash'd, and resolution ran: We've heard enough they said, and gave a shout, (Discordant to th' assailing troops without); We wish no more delay; we long to go 'Gainst this successful, this victorious foe, Carleton had now obtain'd his soul's desire, Had rouz'd the troops, and set the tars on fire: He gave the word, to right and left they fil'd, He mark'd their readiness, and grimly smil'd: Brave Hamilton advanc'd with Britain's tars, And bold Maclean, with northern sons of Mars, The gallant Laws, M'Dougal, Caldwell too, With warlike ardor to the battle flew: English, Hibernians, Caledonians frown'd, And emulously took their stations round. Towards the ramparts, Brown and Livingston, To make two feints, led Against St. John's Gate and Cape Diamond. two small parties on: Montgom'ry next, intrepidly drew near, To make a rough attack at Aunce de Mere; The firm Hibernian led New Yorkers on, Macpherson, Campbell, (sons of Caledon) With Cheesman march'd, and resolutely came, Scorning impediments in quest of fame: Meanwhile, amidst a dreadful cannonade, Another rough attack bold Arnold made: Lamb, and th' artill'ry corps, now ceas'd to wield The distant batt'ring thunder of the field; They march'd to succour Arnold in the fight, Amidst the horrors of that fatal night; To reinforce that corps, which first appear'd In Canada, and hostile banners rear'd: Bold, hardy, obstinate, they seem'd to be; An indefatigable enemy! Bold were the troops and tars, who firmly stood, Where those men strove to make their footing good! They pass'd St. Roques, and onward press'd, not far, Before they felt the weight of Britain's war: But, pond'rous as it was, they persever'd; Press'd fighting onward, and each other chear'd! The snow began to wear a purple stain, Ting'd with the blood of Arnold's party slain. Brave Carleton military skill display'd; From right to left, the garrison survey'd; With active vigilance, he travers'd round; Now with the tars, now with the troops, was found: In various parts, the British chiefs were heard, Examples rouz'd, and exhortations chear'd: The combatants in diff'rent places bled, Where Arnold charg'd, and where Montgom'ry led: Quebec, to Etna strong resemblance bore, (Heaving, and lab'ring with convulsive roar): Its sides, and summit, crown'd with heaps of snow, 'Midst peals of thunder, and black sulph'rous glow! Montgom'ry, Campbell, and Macpherson strove To keep their spirits up, as on they drove: Lamb, Oswald, Cheesman, Humphrys, Hendricks too, With Arnold, in the van to the battle flew; And in conjunction fierce, with these were seen, The gallant Ogden, Biclowe, Meigs, and Green: Th' assailants, and th' assail'd, rush'd to the fight, Invelop'd in the gloom of wintry night: Sliding on ice, and trampling in the The provincials advanced under cover of a snow-storm; which being in their rear, drove against the front of the British forces. snow; They felt no cold; an animating glow, With vital warmth the distant parts supply'd; They nipping frost, and chilling blasts defy'd: In leaden show'rs, alternate, in the dark At random sent, death found the destin'd mark: As they advanc'd, the danger greater grew; One barrier pass'd, a second rose to view: Here death, and Carleton's corps, in ambush lay, To charge, obstruct, and seize their destin'd prey: Montgom'ry here, a âne plus ultraâ found; Macpherson too, receiv'd a mortal wound; Cheesman, with these, here drew his latest breath; (Most precious morsels for the jaws of death): Their fall fill'd all around with sudden dread; (Thro' the New Yorkers consternation spread); The fifes began to sound, and the drums beat The welcome notice of a quick retreat: Successive Cooper, Humphrys, Hendricks fall; From rifled tubes no more to send the ball. Tho' three detachments met a foul defeat, And were compell'd at distance to retreat: With twenty-five selected from the rest, Arnold, and Oswald, to the battle prest, Against a two-gun battery, which lay As an impediment, and barr'd their way: Here they charg'd home, on death, or conquest bent; Incessant show'rs of lead before them sent: The fort's defendants firm resistance made: Firm, Arnold's corps sustain'd their cannonade! An hour, each party's fortitude was try'd, Ere victory declar'd on either side. 'Midst death, and wounds, which were at random dealt, Arnold The bone of his leg was splintered by a musket-ball. at length th' unwelcome greeting felt; Soon was the vital stream perceiv'd to flow, And mark his purpled footsteps in the snow: As from the front he mov'd to gain the rear, They shouted, and resolv'd to persevere; Swept o'er the rampart, like a swelling flood, And bought the little battery with blood. With brisk dispatch, on the provincials came, Trampling in snow, and wrapt in sheets of flame, Press'd on the regulars, who thought to gain A second barrier, and that post maintain; But ere they were in proper stations fix'd, The rough provincial vanguard 'mongst them mix'd: Not far from thence the regulars retir'd; Twice thus repuls'd, with indignation fir'd; Like hunted boars they chaf'd, determin'd stood; And with redoubled rage the fight renew'd; To their assistance, gallant Laws drew near 'Gainst Arnold's corps, and closely charg'd their rear: With him, to battle brave M'Dougal rush'd, And briskly backwards the provincials push'd: With emulation fir'd, each party strove Who shou'd come first, as to the spot they drove: Like torrents rushing from a rocky height, Shouting they came, and press'd to closest fight: The colonists receiv'd them with a shout; Fac'd ev'ry way, encompass'd round about: Like wolves, by troops of hunters hemm'd around, Three hours they fought, and firm maintain'd their ground! Oswald, and other gallant leaders, thought To banish gloomy fears, and briskly fought; Lamb, likewise, resolutely persever'd, And by example all around him chear'd. When they to make a brisk retreat design'd, No friendly outlet cou'd those forces find; Wherever they explor'd the fatal place, Death, and destruction, star'd them in the face: Each avenue by hostile troops was barr'd; Th' artill'ry stood their passage to retard; Against their front a mortal storm to throw, And roar their passports to the shades below. In front, the flanks, the rear, at once assail'd, From hope excluded, now their spirits fail'd; They stood upon the margin of the grave; By hard necessity compel'd to crave That life, and mercy, which the brave bestow On foes, submitting 'midst an overthrow; They call'd for quarter, and by gestures shew'd Tacit acknowledgment, they were subdu'd: On all sides quickly ceas'd destructive roar; Confusion, tumult, This battle was fought on the 31st of December 1775. General Carleton, in his letter to General Howe, says, that in this affair, the British forces lost only 1 lieutenant of the navy, doing duty as a captain in the garrison, with 4 rank and file, and 13 ditto wounded, 2 since dead: the enemy lost between six and seven hundred, and between 40 and 50 officers, killed, wounded, and takes prisoners; 5 mortars, and 1 cannon: the provincials say they lost between 60 and 80 killed and wounded, and 300 taken prisoners. slaughter, was no more. The foes repell'd, and each avenue clear, The dead, and wounded, claim'd a decent care: They Cheesman, Hendricks, and Macpherson found, Humphries, and Cooper, breathless on the ground: Montgom'ry lay among the foremost slain; His military virtues now remain Deeply imprinted in each leader's mind; To all his hostile operations blind; Britannia's chiefs his clay-cold carcase eye, Pity the man, and heave a gentle sigh: As death hath laid the bold Hibernian low, Carleton forgets Montgom'ry was a foe: His threat'ning letter they resent no more; Respectfully convey'd 'midst hostile roar, In solemn pomp, attended by the brave, He sunk with warlike honour to the grave; There, all hostilities, and jars must cease; There, likewise, let his ashes rest in peace. Whilst thus in Canada destruction rag'd, And those once friends, as mortal foes engag'd! Dunmore alarm'd, observ'd the gath'ring storm; Seiz'd printing types, and timely strove t' inform The rash insurgents, ere it was too late, They'd meet distress, and rush upon their fate, Shou'd he their num'rous slaves emancipate. Press'd on all sides, he quitted hostile ground, And in the ships of war an azyle found: But reinforc'd by many a gallant tar, He landed oft to prosecute the war; Emancipated slaves he arm'd, and train'd; In frequent skirmishes advantage gain'd; Strove for the honour of Great Britain's arms, And always kept th' insurgents in alarms; Each opportunity he well employ'd, And with assiduous care his foes annoy'd, Seiz'd on their arms, their warlike stores destroy'd. By a deserter over-reach'd at length, And misinform'd of the provincial strength; He sent a small (but good) detachment out, O'er Norfolk's Bridge t' attack a strong redoubt; And in the rear of those bold sons of worth, Three hundred blacks reluctant sally'd forth; But few of those across the bridge were found; They cautious trod on safe and distant ground; Leslie's example, and persuasion too, Cou'd not bring up the tim'rous dastard crew: But Britain's troops and tars, together mix'd, With wonted vigor, and their bay'nets fix'd, A brisk and most intrepid onset made, Amidst a mortal heavy cannonade: And were on all sides charg'd, and briskly ply'd, By thrice their numbers, trench'd, and fortify'd! Yet on they rush'd, burning with warlike flame; And to the breastwork resolutely came! Fordyce led on a few brave sons of Mars, And Squires brought up Britannia's active tars: In his career, arrested by a ball The gallant Fordyce got a mortal fall: Nappier, and Leslie bold, their foes defy'd; And with their blood the bed of honour dy'd: As boldly Batut to the breastwork led Th' advancing party, and as fearless bled The British troops and tars at length gave way; The dead, and wounded, round the ramparts lay: Not one amongst the prisoners was found, But had receiv'd an honourable wound. Woodford, and Spotswood, chief in the command, (Who join'd with Blackburn, there to make a stand) Confess'd how boldly on the Britons came, And rush'd determin'd o'er the field of fame: Of gallant Fordyce, thus they both relate, âHis firmness merited a better fate:â Among the foremost brave, who fell that day, The Caledonian near the breastwork lay; He was no more; th' assailants were retir'd; His intrepidity his foes admir'd! With military pomp, the troops attend His cold remains; had Fordyce been a friend, What cou'd they more their great respect to shew, Than give the warrior ev'ry honour due? Thus, on each side, at honour's glorious call, Brave Englishmen, and Caledonians fall: Hibernians, and provincials, emulate Their warlike deeds, and rush upon their fate: With these, to sanguin'd fields, the sons of worth, From ancient Britain likewise sally forth: They fall esteem'd by the surviving brave; Descend regretted to the silent grave: When hostile heroes are consign'd to death, Resentment dies with their departing breath; Tho' whilst contending for a fatal spot, Fraternal love, and friendship was forgot. The loss was great; This happened on the 9th of December 1775. The colonists in their account of this action, say, they had but 1 man wounded; but that Lord Dunmore lost upwards of 100 killed, wounded, and taken. An officer on board his majesty's ship Otter, gives an account of the action, and burning of Norfolk, &amp;c. He says, we had 60 killed, wounded, and taken. For a further explanation of those transactions, as well as of the skirmish at Moor's Bridge Creek, in North Carolina, the 27th of February 1776; the insurrection, battle, and disarming of the Caledonians, and their party; the letters, and behaviour of the governors of the several colonies; vide the Magazines, Annual Registers, Remembrancers, and the public prints of that date; in which appeared several accounts of the tumultuous insurrections through the continent, tarring and feathering, needless oppression, and wanton barbarities, laid to the charge of both parties (how justly I cannot take upon me to determine); all which occurrences are too long for insertion here, and some of which are much below the dignity of an heroic narrative. 'twas hard to be sustain'd: The troops no longer on the shore remain'd: On march'd the colonists with hearts elate, Seiz'd Norfolk town, and hasten'd on its fate: Within short musket shot they dar'd to stand, And brav'd Dunmore on Norfolk's hostile strand! Soon after this the Liverpool arriv'd, Strengthen'd their force, their drooping hopes reviv'd; Nearer they hove, in thunder made th' attack; And from their wharfs drove the provincials back; Gloomy they turn'd, reluctantly retir'd; And the deserted town was quickly fir'd: Frantic with rage th' insurgents seem'd to be, (Treating a friend, as if an enemy!) Drove all before them from th' adjacent ground; And widely spread a blazing ruin round! Not female shrieks, nor supplicating age, Cou'd stem the torrent of their wasting rage! 'Gainst pity steel'd, and deaf to friendship's call, Stores, farms, and villages, were doom'd to fall! Want, sickness, storms, 'gainst Dunmore jointly strove; And on th' unfriendly coast some vessels drove; He sail'd, to join the forces where they lay, Ready t' attack New York, by land and sea. Tho' the provincials had receiv'd a check, Fresh reinforcements pour'd around Quebec: More than six thousand came at honour's call, Determin'd to revenge Montgom'ry's fall: Each hour, 'midst frost and snow, they well employ'd; With red hot balls, the suburbs they destroy'd: The continental forces persever'd; The glorious end in view, their spirits chear'd; With scaling ladders, they approaches made, And seem'd determin'd on an escalade; Expecting amply to retaliate That slaughter, when Montgom'ry met his fate! The troops, and tars, baffled each bold attack, Incessant strove to drive th' assailants back; More critical their situation grew; With giant strides grim danger nearer drew: The British ministry were much alarm'd, And with dispatch three royal vessels arm'd; They, gallant Douglas, Linzee, Harvey, chose, To counteract their num'rous active foes: Two hundred men, with Petersham, their chief, They bore to give besieg'd Quebec relief: They sail'd from Britain The Isis, Captain Douglas, sailed on the 11th day of March 1776, and about a week after the Surprize, Captain Linzee, and the Martin, Captain Harvey, sailed: they all arrived at Quebec, 6th of May 1776. early in the year, And Douglas first to Newfoundland drew near; Here wintry mountains swam upon the sea! (A land of ice around the vessel lay!) The season seem'd against Quebec to war And nature form'd a most tremendous bar! But what can Britain's fearless tars impede? Shou'd winter lend their adversaries aid; Onward they'd sail with animating glow, And boldly dare his storms of driving snow! Warm for the fight, thro' frigid seas wou'd glide, Dash'd by the floating rocks on either side! Here, for a passage, Douglas briskly strove, And thro' surrounding ice determin'd drove! Near sixty leagues 'midst floating dangers past! And safely reach'd St. Lawrence gulph at last! Near the same course, Linzee, and Harvey sail'd, And over ev'ry obstacle prevail'd; Cover'd with ice, they likewise found the sea; But resolute, impatient of delay; They crouded on, and after Douglas forc'd their way! Time fled away, each hour more precious grew, And Linzee, onward with impatience flew: Soon after him, Douglas, and Harvey came, And launch'd their bolts, wrapp'd up in British flame: From Levi's Point the colonists withdrew, And full of dismal apprehensions grew; On shore two hundred grenadiers were sent, And Carleton, on retaliation bent, Welcom'd the gallant Petersham to land, And straightway for a sally gave command: Forth from two gates, a living torrent pour'd, And on each brow a grim defiance low'r'd: Carleton's approaching war they greatly fear'd; As planet struck the colonists appear'd! With efforts faint, the first attack sustain'd; Their field-artill'ry undischarg'd remain'd! They tents, petards, and scaling ladders left! As if of resolution quite bereft! Their military stores abandon'd lay! Their muskets, and cartouches, mark'd the way They fled; which onward led to Dechambault, There felt returning glow, and made an halt. Now Indians, Various contradictory reports have been propagated, of breach of articles on one side, and savage cruelty on the other. and Canadians, from afar, With Forster join'd, and eager for the war, Came rushing on, to drive th' invaders back, And with the Cedars Fort began the attack; At their approach they felt a cold dismay, Submitted soon, and at discretion lay. To vex his foes, Carleton the time improv'd, With speed embark'd, and up the river mov'd: Douglas, and Harvey, vigorously wrought With naval diligence, and forward brought Transports, with troops, artillery, and stores, And safely landed them on diff'rent shores, With Fraser, Phillips, Nesbit, and Burgoyne, Who flew with ardor Carleton's corps to join. The colonists now strove to shake off fear, And check the victors harrassing their rear; To Trois Rivieres two thousand boldly sped; Thompson, and Irwin, this detachment led: The sixty-second regiment there they found, With Fraser, in possession of the ground; Ready for war the posted Britons stood; A close and smart encounter quick ensu'd: But soon the colonists a flight began, And towards In this retreat, and the different attacks, the provincials lost 22 pieces of cannon left in the woods: 390 men taken prisoners at the Cedars Fort: 120 at Kinchin: 200 in the action near Trois Rivieres; with Major General Thompson, General Irwin, and other officers; the killed and wounded uncertain. For a more complete investigation, vide General Sir Guy Carleton's letters; in which he writes, that not 20 of the king's troops were lost in the skirmishes; and that the provincials destroyed by fire, all the boats, and large craft, they could not drag up the rapids, with a quantity of provisions, stores, &amp;c. See likewise Captain Douglas's letters, and others. Sorel in disorder ran, As Carleton with his forces forward prest, To bring the fugitives to closest test; Too facile for attack this place they deem'd, And Montreal now more eligible seem'd: Not yet from dismal apprehensions freed, From thence, to Fort St. John's they march'd with speed; Determin'd seem'd to stand, and wait th' event, Join'd by the welcome reinforcements sent: Again the colonists affrighted grew, As near the fort Burgoyne's detachment drew; And terror struck, as on his party came, They fled, and left the buildings in a flame! After expelling their invading foes, The colony began t' enjoy repose: Carleton determin'd ev'ry foe to save From pain, distress, want, sickness, and the grave; Offer'd both pardon, food, and health, and ease, To such as shou'd the kind occasion seize: Lest conscious of their crimes, a sad dismay, Shou'd tempt them their surrender to delay; He gave command to search the woods around, That such might in their lurking holes be found; Proclaiming he design'd each man should be To health restor'd, and set at liberty, T' enjoy the former comforts of their lives; 'Mongst children, brothers, fathers, friends, and wives! Meanwhile, the colonists strove hard to gain The distant friendly shore of Lake Champlain; Carleton, Burgoyne, and Douglas, made a stand, Detain'd perforce upon Canadia's land; They wou'd have follow'd the provincial fleet, But ere they cou'd in naval thunder greet, They must some great uncommon efforts make, To match the colonists upon the lake: To work they went, all ranks incessant wrought, And all things necessary forward brought; Up rapid streams the naval war was tow'd! And over land, boats, and gondolas rode! Which, as the pond'rous apparatus mov'd, A most laborious undertaking prov'd: Shipwrights, and seamen, chearfully proceed To reconstruct, rig, and equip with speed The fleet, design'd the naval war to make, And bear Great Britain's thunder o'er the lake: Soon amidst chearful shouts, they left the shore; Away for Crown Point ev'ry vessel bore: Near Valicour, Arnold determin'd lay, To harrass, vex, and hold the fleet in play: And now, the British fleet appear'd in view; The Carleton, and the gun-boats, nearer drew; A brisk attack on Arnold's fleet they made, Against his much superior cannonade; But Dacres fought like a true British tar Still persever'd, and bore th' unequal war! Till order'd at a distance to retire, Beyond the reach of Arnold's naval fire: At night, both parties near each other lay; Pringle, and Dacres, waiting for the day, When all their force arriv'd, and fleet to fleet, Shou'd be drawn up, and in loud thunder greet: But so, not Waterburg, nor Arnold thought; At Valicour, they had experience bought; And timely fled, inspir'd with cautious dread, Whilst thick nocturnal gloom the lake o'erspread: The morn arriv'd, no foes appear'd in sight, So sudden, and so speedy was their flight! With all the sail the British fleet could make, Towards Crown Point they stood across the lake; The second day their foes appear'd in sight, The tars now grew impatient for the fight; Pringle, and Dacres, emulously strove Who shou'd excel, and like a tempest drove Among their foes; who, scorning to retire, Slacken'd their sail, and soon return'd their fire: Both parties strove their courage to display, And neither seem'd inclining to give way; For Waterburg, and Arnold were engag'd, Where the chief fury of the battle rag'd: Longer had both in doubtful fight been try'd, Ere victory declar'd on either side; Had not a strange phÃ¦nomenon arose, Stemming towards the continental foes! Who soon began to feel desponding dread, When with her full-blown cloud of canvas spread, The ship Inflexible, was seen to glide, And fling destruction from each thund'ring side! Then overaw'd by that uncommon sight, Arnold sheer'd off, and soon declin'd the fight, Spread ev'ry useful sail, ply'd ev'ry oar, To shoot ahead, and gain the nearest shore; Tho' there, his fleet in flames consum'd away, He sav'd his forces for another day; With which th' amphibious leader made a stand Against Burgoyne, disputing for the land! Schank well employ'd the great advantage gain'd Against those hostile vessels that remain'd: The Lee, The two battles were fought on Lake Champlain, on the 11th and 13th of October 1776, in which, Captain Pringle says, the killed and wounded of the English do not amount to 40; on the provincial side, uncertain. General Arnold in the Congress galley, with 5 gondolas, ran on shore; they were immediately abandoned, and blown up by the provincials: the Boston, the Royal Savage, the Lee, and another, were destroyed in two engagements: the Washington galley, and the Jersey gondola, were taken, with Brigadier General Waterburg. the Washington, the Jersey, felt The vengeance Pringle, Schank, and Dacres dealt. BOOK III. THE ARGUMENT. General Washington appointed commander in chief of the continental forces; his speech when he arrives with General Lee, to head, and spirit up the troops against Boston. The Nancy, an ordnance vessel, taken. The attack commenced, and the battery return'd; Dorchester Height fortified by the provincials; General Howe's resolution to attack it; but prevented by a storm, evacuates Boston, and with his army lands at Halifax: proceeds from thence in the spring to New York, and lands at Staten Island. Admiral Sir Peter Parker sails with Lord Cornwallis, and a reinforcement, to join General Clinton at Cape Fear; but, dispersed by a storm, are driven to different parts of the world: they arrive in the spring at Cape Fear. Fort Sullivan attacked, and the gallantry displayed in the action: the British fleet and tars quit the unsuccessful enterprize, and sail to join Lord Viscount Howe and General Howe at Staten Island. Commodore Hopkins, in the congress service, sails to Providence, and brings the royal stores, arms, and ammunition, from thence: the Glasgow, Captain Tyringham Howe, falls in with him, engages the fleet, and escapes the threatened destruction. Whilst full of jealousies, and sad alarms, Britons, and Trans-atlantics rouz'd in arms; The fatal spot from whence the mischief rose, Was threaten'd with accumulating woes. Fretting to be from Boston thus repell'd, The town possess'd, the townsmen captives held; The colonists on fell revenge were bent; To their assistance, from the congress sent, The Gen'rals Washington, and Lee, arriv'd, Gave them fresh spirits, and their hopes reviv'd. 'Midst shouts, aloft th' appeal General Washington's standard. to heav'n was rear'd, And to this purport Washington was heard; Their thanks the members of the congress send; To you first arm'd, with Britons to contend. Selected from the guardians of the land, By them appointed chief in the command; Permit me gallant friends, to say thus far, How I wou'd wish to prosecute the war: Attack'd by sea, and land, on ev'ry side, When dang'rous duty shall our force divide, Choose advantageous posts, be watchful found; Never neglect to fortify the ground; If cautious, we, on the defensive stand, Their blood must purchase ev'ry foot of land. When Chatham pleaded freedom's glorious cause, And gain'd exemption from oppressive laws; He said Great Britain's military pow'rs, When brought into comparison with ours, So far surpass'd, that we must fall of course, So very small was our internal force: âShou'd we to war with wonted vigor rush; âWe can America to atoms Vide the speech on the repeal of the stamp-act. crush!â The dreadful time may not be long deferr'd, Amply to prove that able statesman err'd: America for all their force will call; Like a strong man America will fall; Will grapple fierce, will render wound for wound, And drag her rough assailant to the ground; Like Sampson at his death, will havoc make, And to its base the British empire shake. Around enthusiastic transport spread; A shout confirm'd what the brave vet'ran said. They bolder grew, their near advances made, And held the Britons in a strong blockade: Supplies fell short with the declining year, Distress, and famine, ev'ry cause for fear, (Enough to weigh the briskest spirits down) Threaten'd destruction to the troops and town; Houses were oft for common fuel raz'd, (In culinary fires the buildings blaz'd). The chiefs grew anxious, fearing foul disgrace: Among the troops despondency took place: Towards the sea, they often turn'd their eyes, No news from Britain came, no fresh supplies! No welcome reinforcement cou'd arrive; Cloathing, nor food, to keep their hopes alive! All intercourse with Britain seem'd to cease, As if they'd slept amidst profoundest peace! Transports, and packets, ships of war were driv'n To distant shores, such was the will of heav'n: Scarce any to the port in safety got: And Boston seem'd an interdicted spot: Fate seem'd resolv'd Britain's designs to marr, And strengthen North America for War: Retarded by a tedious long delay, The live stock perish'd on the blust'ring sea, And transport ships became provincial prey. Laden with apparatus for the train; Thrice strove the Nancy Boston's port to gain; Oft as she came, the wind unfriendly grew, (A rough opposing storm against her blew:) The Cerberus for her protection sail'd; But in th' attempt the royal frigate fail'd; In darkness wrapp'd, by tempest rudely tost, They parted, and the precious This was a vessel laden with ordnance stores, and said to be worth 50,000 l. which furnished the provincials with cannon, mortars, shells, shot, &amp;c. for the siege; at the same time depriving the Britons of the long-expected supply. prize was lost: This, through the royal army spread a damp; And fill'd with pleasure the provincial camp. Britain appear'd to slumber 'midst the war; Her troops forgot, remov'd from home so far! Apparently deserted, and forlorn, What made their burden better to be born; The colonists around them seem'd to dose, And lull'd their harrass'd spirits to repose! The chiefs wore chearful looks their grief to hide, And stem the growing strong desponding tide: But cou'd not from their troubled minds efface Foreboding expectations of disgrace: The most emphatic words cannot express Their doubts, their hopes, and gen'ral deep distress: Their thoughts were lab'ring like imprison'd air, To bring the purpose of their souls to bear: With Britain's gloomy vet'ran troops, t' oppose (And burst like fate among) surrounding foes: Week after week, they in this manner past; Assur'd some fresh supplies wou'd come at last: Each chief, and private, thought they might depend, Britain wou'd needful reinforcements send; Transport her troops, each hostile scheme to marr, And round the coast wou'd pour her naval war: Vain were their hopes, such was the will of fate! They never came until it was too late! Tho' sickness, want, and famine, fill'd the town, And heav'n on Britain's forces seem'd to frown; Tho' Washington had little cause for fear; Tho' reinforcements, and supplies were near; He circumspectly posted troops around, And fortify'd well-chosen spots of ground: Convinc'd, that when his batt'ries were employ'd, His foes might be effectually annoy'd: He knew t' attack such vet'ran well try'd men, Was like to rouzing lions from their den. The troops conven'd, the day draws near he said, On which our slaughter'd friends in Boston bled! Our own distress, and their lamented fall, Will on that day for vengeance loudly call: Vengeance they cry'd we will most surely have, Or sink with sanguin'd honour to the grave: The chief reply'd my wishes are the same; For ample vengeance to the camp I came: Our burnt and plunder'd towns, and ruin'd trade, Demand retaliation shou'd be made: Instead of making overtures for peace, That discontent, and civil broils might cease; Britain curtails our liberty, and trade! A new restraining bill is lately made! T' enforce submission to that bill requir'd, Levies are made, and foreign troops are hir'd! But we are ready (for a firm defence,) To make them feel the dreadful consequence; When we, in battle, shall upon them pour A batt'ring iron fulminating show'r. From England's and Hibernia's hostile shores, We're cloath'd, and fed, and well supply'd with stores: Kind Providence seems fighting on our side; With arms, and Alluding to the ordnance stores and troops they had taken in several vessels, and the great number of transports which had fallen into their hands, laden with gun-powder, arms, ammunition, cloathing, provisions, stores of every kind: the cannons, mortars, shot, shells, and stores, in the forts and garrisons, which they had seized on the continent. ammunition, well supply'd From British forts, upon the continent, And Britain's ordnance stores in transports sent; With their artill'ry we may now contend, Carcase for carcase, shell for shell can send; May freely use their own disploding grain, Throw their own balls, and grape-shot back again: 'Twill gall them to the quick, when they shall find, Their various mischiefs 'gainst ourselves design'd, By us, are pour'd on each invader's head, A wild confusion through their lines to spread! But, oh! my friends! whilst now my bosom glows, To rout from Boston our invading foes! Horrid reflection harrows up my soul! Say, Shall humanity our rage controul? Shall wives and daughters shrieks, shall mothers tears? Shall our distracted friends, o'erwhelm'd with fears? Shall infants cries our vengeance now retard? Long time they have our warlike progress barr'd: 'Tis they disarm'd our fury day by day, And held our slow-pac'd vengeance at a bay: The cannon muzzled, bid destruction stand; And pluck'd the matches from each ready hand. By want, and famine, pinch'd; they undergo Oppressive insults from a victor foe: To rescue them shall we no efforts make? We prize their lives; our honours are at stake: Shall we inactive rest? sit tamely down? And let the British troops possess the town? No shell nor carcase send? retain each ball? Lest friends 'mongst foes shou'd undistinguish'd fall? Suspended long, 'twixt amity and rage, The troops had stood; but now, resolv'd t' engage; They gave a shout for war; aloud they cry'd We long to be once more in battle try'd: If heav'n determines we shall not succeed, Unless our friends among our foes shall bleed; We bend submiss; the will of heav'n be done; But must declare we wish th' attack begun: The chief reply'd, you shall exulting have An opportunity to glut the grave, If Britain's regulars dare stay on land, Against our formidable war to stand: We'll make their own destructive thunder roar, To drive them headlong from th' Atlantic shore. Prepar'd 'gainst Britain's troops th' attack to make The colonists from slumber seem'd to wake; Putnam's, and Washington's loud serenade, (Discordant at a ball, or masquerade,) A surly summons prov'd t' attend their fate, And rouz'd them from their dull lethargic state, To look around, embarrass'd and surpriz'd, To find the siege of Boston realiz'd! According to the preconcerted plan, From Phipps's Farm the battery began; This serv'd t' amuse the British troops, until They'd fortify'd a near commanding hill; Th' adjacent height of Dorchester they chose, From whence t' annoy, and cannonade their foes; Tho' harrass'd, yet too fierce to be engag'd In close attack; they therefore wisely wag'd A distant war, and now began to pour Of lead, and iron, a tremendous show'r! Like flaming meteors, o'er the subject town, A fulminating storm of shells came down! Fourteen successive days and nights, they made Incessant fierce destructive cannonade! Stern winter form'd a floating icy bar, And distant held Great Britain's naval war; Therefore the colonists securer fought, And sooner to a crisis matters brought. The British troops fac'd ev'ry rough attack, And sent a storm of lead and iron back; Four times their numbers were incamp'd around, And unmolested rang'd on friendly ground; Full sixteen miles their lines were stretch'd along, Their front was render'd formidably strong; Far otherwise the British army's case; Within the limits of a narrow space, They occupy'd so very small a spot, That each disploding shell, each batt'ring shot, Each flaming carcase the provincials sent, Perform'd in part their engineers intent; If they to sally forth shou'd be inclin'd, Ten thousand enemies they left behind; Who wish'd the continental forces might, Sweep them to death, in one vindictive fight: No amicable thousands cou'd come nigh, To chear, assist, or give a fresh supply: Yet, oft the ready chiefs their troops address'd, Surrounded thus, by numbers closely press'd, We must evacuate, or choose to fight Our foes, on yonder strong commanding height: In their defeat our future safety lies: We seem to read in your indignant eyes, A firm determin'd readiness of will, To force a passage up the dang'rous hill, Shall Preston, and Dunmore, attempt to bar The progress of the continental war? Shall Hamilton, and Carleton, at Quebec, Give near approaching foes a mortal check? Shall Percy, Clinton, The Honourable Major Maitland, of the marines, and Major Grant, of the 40th regiment, sailed with Captain Barkley, of the Scarborough, to Savannah, in Georgia, with 200 men; and there against a strong opposition, by the assistance of the seamen, brought off 17 vessels laden with rice, which had been detained by the provincials. The transactions of Captain Hammond, Vandeput, M'Cartney, Bellew, Squires, and other British commanders, on the coast of America, but more especially the expeditions and attempts of Captain Wallace, with the force under his command, have been so repeatedly mentioned in the public papers as to need no recital here. Grant, brave sons of Mars, With Wallace, Squires, and many gallant tars, Seize on their ships, incessant make alarms, And spread the terror of Great Britain's arms? And shall not we brisk efforts make to gain Some fame on op'ning of a new campaign? Shall we alone inactively sit down, And give up all pretensions to the town? Will British veterans make this their choice? No; they reply'd, with animated voice, We wish to fight, we'll readily obey, And march where our commanders lead the way: It was resolv'd to sally forth, and fight, Altho' shou'd prove another Bunker's height. Death, and the grave, in expectation yawn'd, But long before the destin'd morning dawn'd, All nature seem'd tumultuously to jar; The elements commenc'd a blust'ring war: As men cou'd not their slaught'ring rage command, The God of armies took the cause in hand: Kind Providence survey'd the threaten'd town, And either host, with a paternal frown; Seem'd awfully the dreadful scene to close, And drove contending mortals to repose. To Washington the bold design was known; And twenty thousand round the spot were drawn: With such celerity their works increas'd, That when the blust'ring storm of nature ceas'd, In reason's eye so very strong they seem'd, The well-mann'd height impregnable was deem'd: So indefatigably had they wrought, Dislodgment was impracticable thought. Yet day by day, tumult of course ensu'd, Whenever they their batteries renew'd: Sometimes they slack'd, and with less fury fir'd, As if both parties were of slaughter tir'd; But by degrees, both sides less fierce assail'd, And reason's cooling voice at length prevail'd: The gen'rals seem'd to think the storm was sent, As a cÅlestial strong impediment: Willing t' avoid th' unnecessary guilt, Of adding to the blood already spilt; It seem'd as if a compromise they made, To cease bombardment, and the cannonade. No gen'rous man wou'd overwhelm with woes, Ten thousand friends, mix'd with ten thousand foes: But rather wish (if honour wou'd permit) His foes that spot might unmolested quit; Shou'd Washington continue to pour down A batt'ring storm against the friendly town; Each cannon ball which he shou'd thither send, Design'd to strike a foe, might kill a friend: A father, mother, brother, sister, wife, By bursting shells, might be depriv'd of life: The lives of harmless infants lay at stake; Since bombs and balls can no distinction make: A demolition they cou'd not avoid, 'Twas friendly property which they destroy'd: And if the flaming carcases they threw, A gen'ral conflagration might ensue: Shou'd they too far the Britons irritate, Boston might sink 'midst dreadful flaming fate; Whilst to the ships the reg'lars might retire, Their rear defended by the town on fire. Had Howe resolv'd in Boston to remain, Small was th' advantage he cou'd hope to gain; Cou'd not on equal terms maintain the fight, Against that fortify'd commanding height: Storm'd by his foes, and driv'n by adverse fate, The gen'ral wisely chose t' evacuate. Stores of all kinds convey'd on board the fleet, As time and situation would permit; Their wives, their friends, For further information, vide the London Gazette of May 3d 1776; in which it is said, that on the 7th of March 1776, âGeneral Howe having taken a resolution to remove from Boston to Halifax, with the troops under his command, and such of the inhabitants, with their effects, as were desirous to continue under the protection of his majesty's forces; the embarkation was effected on the 17th of that month, with the greatest order and regularity, and without the least interruption.â There never appeared any authentic account of loss government sustained in ammunition and stores at Boston; but various reports make the loss great indeed, in cannon, mortars, coals, wheat, barley, oats, oil, horses, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. and dangerous in its consequences; especially, if we add the Hope, an ordnance store-ship, with 1500 barrels of gun-powder, 1000 carbines, travelling carriages for heavy cannon; a vast variety of tools, and implements, for the army and artillery; with the George and Annabella, transports, taken in Boston Harbour, for want of information of the evacuation, and on board of which was Lieutenant-Colonel Archibald Campbell, with two companies of the 71st regiment of Highlanders, about 350 in all; and another transport, with about 150. effects, and children sent 'Midst the bleak winds, on Neptune's element; The Britons came from ev'ry post around, And unmolested quitted hostile ground: As farther from the shore, the fleet withdrew, Th' exulting colonists appear'd in view; With warlike pomp, and joy in ev'ry face; And shouting, took possession of the place. Meanwhile, the baffled Britons bore away, 'Midst wintry dangers, on a blust'ring sea: The friendly port of Hallifax they gain'd, And long time there, inactively remain'd: With them vexation went, and doubts, and care: Their friends were distant, and their foes were near: Supplies uncertain, held them in suspense: Damage and loss the certain consequence: Baneful th' event; their enemies well pleas'd; On reinforcements, and provisions seiz'd: 'Mongst others doom'd, the sad mishap to meet, (Unshelter'd by the distant British fleet,) The gallant Campbell, sailing unadvis'd, In Boston Harbour, by the foe surpriz'd, Surrounded suddenly, was forc'd to yield, Retain'd reluctant from the glorious field. The spring arriv'd, hot grew the civil jar; Both sides resolv'd to prosecute the war; Great Britain seem'd on ample vengeance bent, And fitted out her naval armament; And with her ships of war, the transport bore, Near fifty thousands, to th' Atlantic shore The colonists determin'd not to yield, And equal numbers brought into the field; Train'd, arm'd, and station'd round, on ev'ry side, To keep the ground completely fortify'd. Whilst yet at Hallifax the Britons lay, Many reflecting on their scanty pay, From England ev'ry The sum subscribed, and paid for this purpose, amounted to upwards of 20,000 l. and letters appeared in the public papers from the Generals Howe, Carleton, Percy, Pigot, Jones, Grant, Leslie, Cleveland, &amp;c. with their thanks to the gentlemen of the marine society; those who met at the London Tavern; the gentlemen of Bristol, and all others, who generously contributed their benefactions for relief of the soldiers, their widows, and orphans. necessary sent, For soldiers warring on the continent. A gen'rous public touch'd by num'rous woes, And sharp distress of our fraternal foes, On whom ill fortune frown'd, who had endur'd Captivity; in prisons long immur'd; Contributed large Several thousands of pounds were generously subscribed by the public, and paid in, under the inspection of a committee of gentlemen, appointed for the purpose of assisting the provincial prisoners in England. sums, to give relief, As some alleviation of their grief; And prov'd that whilst we public vengeance dealt, For captives in distress the Britons felt. The colonists had now agreed to yield A large So general was this resolution, that if any person oppos'd it, possessions, liberty, and life, were in danger. supply, for those who took the field: The softer sex enthusiastic grew, And from their beds their useful blankets drew, To cloath the troops, who in the trenches lay, And publicly renounc'd the use of tea! Now Parker sail'd, and sought th' Atlantic shore; With him, Cornwallis and his vet'rans bore; Work'd up by storms, the sea tempestuous grew; Rough blust'ring adverse winds incessant blew; As if the God of nature had decreed, Ye shall not in your enterprize proceed: All from their destin'd course ran wide astray, And separated on the troubled sea: Spite of their efforts, overpow'r'd at length, They backward steer'd with all their naval strength; Unable to surmount the blust'ring bar, And pass'd their winter distant from the war; Strangers to that distress and discontent, The British troops in Boston underwent; And in the spring (impatient of delay) They strove to cross the more pacific sea; They reach'd Cape Fear, where anxious Clinton staid, In expectation of their friendly aid: A junction form'd, and thence to Charlestown steer'd, And found the flag of bold defiance rear'd. For Lee they sent, who came, and strove t' inspire Each Carolinian's soul with warlike fire: Thousands were ready, to the work they went; Expresses were for reinforcements sent; With quick dispatch they travers'd far and wide, Supplies came pouring in on ev'ry side; Beams, stakes, and sods, from various parts they brought, With unabated resolution wrought; With hearts elate, the Trans-atlantics saw The works each day, stronger and stronger grow; Whilst distant friends to their assistance came, Who seem'd to feel the great heroic flame, Boldly t' attempt to drive the Britons back, Whene'er they shou'd the garrison attack: But why they chose inactive to remain, Time, they suppos'd, the riddle wou'd explain! The day arriv'd which for th' attack they chose; But wind and water rudely interpose; Proving an ominous retarding bar, To the commencement of the destin'd war: The colonists rejoic'd, and thought th' event, An omen of success, which heav'n had sent, Longer t' employ their military art, And march their forces in from ev'ry part. Th' Experiment arriv'd 'midst this delay, T' assist, and share the danger of the day: This welcome reinforcement drawing near, Seem'd to affect the colonists with fear: Moultrie Commander in chief of Fort Sullivan. perceiv'd the symptoms of dismay, And thus he strove to chase their fears away: What tho' their ships the dang'rous bar have past, And we expect a rough attack at last! We've had sufficient time for what we've plann'd; Our ramparts are repair'd, our forts are mann'd! Trench'd, and completely fortify'd around; And very tenable we've made the ground! With spirit fight, you will such havoc make, That Britain's rugged tars themselves shall quake: Provincials, cover'd by their banks and walls, From rifled tubes may send their fatal balls; Our batt'ring cannon we can load secure, Behind a firm constructed embrasure; With the like storm their naval force may meet, And launch destruction 'gainst Britannia's fleet, Like them, from British ancestors we sprung; With equal strength our active limbs are strung; Our powder is as good, our engineers, If not superior, are a match for theirs: Cur'd of their doubts and fears more bold they stood, Whilst they Great Britain's fleet and forces view'd; Who pass'd three weeks in the provincials view, Before they near the fort to action drew! At length a signal for th' attack was made, And 'midst a most destructive cannonade, Careless of life, and prodigal of blood, The British seamen to their quarters stood. Scott, Parker, Morris, firm their stations kept; Altho' the besom of destruction swept Across the quarter deck, and ev'ry man, Seem'd mark'd for slaughter when the fight began. Nugent, Caulfield, Molloy, with equal pace, And equal ardor, ran bright glory's race; T' excell each other emulous aspir'd, And by example each beholder fir'd: Pyke, Campbell, Symonds, felt the warlike flame; Hope, James, and Williams, thirsting after fame; Each officer, and ev'ry volunteer, Behav'd that day, as if they knew no fear: When cover'd o'er with wounds, and almost spent; Reluctant, Morris from his station went: The dressings were apply'd, and from below He re-ascended, full of warlike glow; With one arm lopp'd, he on the deck appear'd, His station took, and ev'ry seaman chear'd; Who from his looks enliv'ning ardor caught; And with redoubled fury briskly fought: Oft from the fort the rough provincials drove, Who resolutely for the vict'ry strove; Corps after corps march'd in, on war intent, And 'gainst the ships their batt'ring mischief sent: Still seem'd as if they more determin'd grew, And from the ramparts red hot bullets threw: The gallant Scott, a stranger seem'd to fear; Of fame and danger claim'd an ample share: A mournful, true, and glorious tale to tell; He wounded, bruis'd, and mutilated fell. Parker, likewise, immortal honour gain'd: A glorious spectacle, alone remain'd Of intrepidity; and firmly view'd The deck, with wounded, dead, and dying strew'd; Tho' ev'ry hour the danger greater grew; And show'rs of balls and splinters round him flew! And flaming The enemy often fired red-hot bullets: and it is said, the Bristol was twice on fire, during the dreadful long continued action! There was likewise gallantry displayed in Fort Moultrie: Serj. M'Donald, shattered by a cannon ball, when expiring, said, he hoped the cause would not expire with him. The flag-staff being shot away, Serjeant Jasper, of the grenadiers, jumped from one of the embrazures upon the beach, took the flag, fixed it on a sponge-staff; and whilst the shot flew round him like a storm of hail, remounted the merlon with the flag, and leisurely fixed it; and was presented with a sword as a reward for the same. ruin threaten'd him at last, Perhaps in one fierce instantaneous blast! Th' Acteon, Syren, Sphynx, all strove in vain, A passage round Fort Sullivan to gain; Aground they stuck, and in a dismal plight, Prov'd of no service through the dreadful fight: Amidst the batt'ring storm, tho' full of pain, Morris maintain'd the fight with looks serene: Th' undaunted Ancient Briton seem'd elate, With duty pleas'd, regardless of his fate: Till from the fort a burning bullet sent, Thro' the bold chief its It is said, that Lieutenant Caulfield, (since Captain Morris's death, appointed captain of the Bristol) in his letter makes honourable mention of Captain Morris's extraordinary gallant behaviour; who was wounded five times before he suffered the amputation of his arm; and was twice more wounded after his return upon deck; but notwithstanding kept his station, with a resolution and coolness not to be equalled in any page in history, until a red-hot ball took him in the belly, and put an end to his existence. hissing passage rent; He fell, expir'd, and from each seaman's eye, Resentment flash'd, and vengeance was the cry: 'Gainst the determin'd foes they fiercely strove, And from the fort the Carolinians drove: More than one hour a solemn silence reign'd; Apparently Fort Sullivan was gain'd. During the fight, the British soldiers stood Inactive, and the hot engagement view'd! Nor cou'd they now afford the least relief Altho' each vex'd and disappointed chief, Seem'd anxious for the fight, and all exprest A readiness, to come to closest test: No boats they had to waft them safely o'er! Nor cou'd they wade towards that hostile shore! At least, they had no cov'ring ships of war; They stuck aground on Carolina's bar! Thus, like the myrmidons of old they stood, And the dread slaughter of the Britons view'd! Lee join'd the colonists as they retir'd; Shame! shame! he cry'd, with indignation fir'd: We cannot stand, they said, the cannonade, The seamen 'gainst Fort Sullivan have made; Tho' the three frigates still aground remain; (From whence perhaps they ne'er will float again;) Altho' like wrecks we can perceive most clear, Th' Experiment and Bristol both appear! Tho' masts and rigging overboard are thrown! And but as one, their batter'd port-holes yawn! Tho' from their scoppers to the briny tide, We see the purple marks of slaughter glide! Altho' we've swept the Bristol's quarter deck! They seem to feel no cool disheart'ning check! But with fresh fury, guns and mortars ply, Which storm to shun, we from our quarters fly! Return, he said, for shame! return again; The British sailors are no more than men; Men, like yourselves; as you no doubt will find, If to retrieve lost honour you're inclin'd: We wou'd return most gloomily they cry'd, Cou'd we with ammunition be supply'd; That nearly spent; what further can we do? With that, we wish for reinforcements too; Lest Britain's troops shou'd this advantage take, Be wafted o'er, and their approaches make; And for the fort, on equal terms dispute, Ourselves exhausted, and our cannons mute: Moultrie reply'd, supplies will soon arrive, If when they come, ye will for vict'ry strive: Our friends advance to our assistance sent; See, reinforcements from the continent: Let us return, he said, with warlike glow, That our triumphant enemies may know, We're not subdu'd, but with a fresh supply, In hottest battle will their courage try: Come, follow me, all such as wish to have Their names inroll'd among the great and brave! They caught his fire; back to the fort return'd, And with fresh courage for the battle burn'd: Their stations took, again renew'd the fight; Defiance roar'd; but at th' approach of night, The The Bristol had 40 killed, and 71 wounded; the Experiment 23 killed, and 56 wounded; and both of them suffered much in their hulls, masts, rigging, and sails. Admiral Parker received several contusions; Captain Morris, of the Bristol, was killed; Lord William Campbell, on the lower deck, received a contusion in his left side; Captain Scott, of the Experiment, lost his arm, and was otherwise so much wounded and bruised, as was feared would prove mortal: the Active had Lieutenant Pike killed, and 6 wounded; the Solebay, 8 wounded. For further explanation of this affair, vide Adm. Sir Peter Parker's and General Sir Henry Clinton's letters, in the London Gazette, 25th Aug. 1776. Bristol and Experiment withdrew; And wou'd not with the morn the fight renew; And lest th' Acteon shou'd become their prey, In flames they left her, to consume away: Resolv'd t' attack Fort Sullivan no more, The British force quitted the fatal shore, Hoping in other parts some fame to gain, And wipe away the Carolinian stain. A continental This fleet, consisting of 2 ships, 2 brigs, and a sloop, mounting 44 nine-pounders, and 52 six-pounders, and carrying 780 men; took in their return a bomb-tender, and several other vessels. The Glasgow, Captain Tyrringham Howe, mounting 20 nine-pounders, 150 men, fell in with them on the 6th of April 1776.

BOOK IV. THE ARGUMENT. Lord Howe, Admiral Sir Peter Parker, and the Commodores Fielding and Hotham, arrive off Staten Island, with transports, &amp;c. The American states declare for independence. A flag of truce sent to General Washington. The descent on Long Island, the battle, and rout of the provincials; their evacuation, and retreat to New York, which is attacked by the British forces, and taken. Great part of the city destroyed by incendiaries. The British troops prepare to drive the provincials farther back; skirmishes, as they retire; the battle at the White Plains. Forts Washington, Independence, and Lee attacked, and taken; the provincials retreat on all sides; and General Lee taken: General Clinton, Earl Percy, &amp;c. take possession of Rhode Island. Both parties retire into winter quarters: General Washington attacks the Hessians at Trenton; Colonel Mawhood, with the 17th regiment, engages a large body of the provincials; the expeditions of Lord Cornwallis, &amp;c. General Tryon's successful expedition against Danbury; Colonel Meigs's and Colonel Barton's success against the British at Sagg Harbour, and Major General Prescot surprized by them, and carried off to the Continent, from Rhode Island. On Staten's Isle, the Britons held at bay, On future action ruminating lay; The long expected succours came at length, And brought them foreign and July 3d 1776, General Howe landed with the troops, from Halifax, on Staten Island: on the 12th of July, Lord Howe arrived with his reinforcements. Admiral Lord Viscount Howe, and General Sir William Howe, were appointed commissioners by his majesty, to settle all differences with the Americans; but in May 1776 the congress had suppressed the authority of the crown, and early in July 1776 declared the thirteen united states of America independent. The event of this treaty, and of that attempted by the five commissioners; viz. the Earl of Carlisle, Lord Viscount Howe, General Sir William Howe, William Eden, Esq; and George Johnstone, Esq; captain in the royal navy, is so well known to the public as to need no recital or comment here. August 12th 1776, two fleets under Commodore Hotham, with guards and Hessians, arrived off Staten Island: Aug. the 14th Admiral Sir Peter Parker, with the Generals Sir Henry Clinton, and Earl Cornwallis, and the troops, arrived: Oct. 18th 1776, a fleet of transports, and ships of war, with 2d division of Hessians, Waldeckers, light horse, &amp;c. arrived at New York, under Commodore Fielding. domestic strength: Ere they launch'd forth as foes upon the flood, T' avoid th' effusion of fraternal blood, A vessel sail'd towards th' unfriendly shore; A waving flag of amity she bore: In her, an herald from the brothers went, On a most amicable errand sent; Requesting all hostilities might cease; Proclaiming pardon, (harbinger of peace,) To all in arms, who wou'd accept the same; In their affronted pard'ning monarch's name. Leave first obtain'd, he set his foot on land, Receiv'd with caution, on the guarded strand: Was thence convey'd where Washington remain'd, Surrounded by provincial chiefs conven'd: Due forms observ'd, the Gen'ral silence broke, And to the herald to this purport spoke; Say, why you come from yonder hostile fleet, With peaceful emblems? and with kindness greet, Those ye so lately met with angry frowns; Attack'd their persons, and destroy'd their towns? Seiz'd on their ships with most rapacious hand! And threaten'd devastation through the land? Do they sincerely wish the war to cease? Beg we'll forgive, and live with them in peace? Will they acknowledge us a sep'rate state? Which seems to be the will of mighty fate. I no such inconsistent message bring, The herald said, but from your gracious king A proclamation; let both great and small, Give due attention to their Sov'reign's call: He begs you'll take sound reason for your guide, And lay all animosity aside, T' exonerate your souls from future guilt, Of adding to the blood already spilt. Will you submissively your arms lay down, He'll sheath the sword, and sooth his angry frown; He'll grant immunities, and make you free, As subjects can with justice wish to be; Will pardon ev'ry rude affront that's past, And in the sea of dark oblivion cast All misdemeanours 'gainst his crown and state, And will your suff'rings strive t' alleviate. Now Washington reply'd, too late you bring These offers, and demands, from Britain's king: A time there was, when ev'ry freeborn son Of British race, wou'd full of ardor run T' assist your state, and strive in ev'ry war, The schemes of all your enemies to marr: With filial satisfaction, liv'd elate, Amid th' indulgence of a parent state: But when we, tho' complaining, often felt Repeated injuries, that parent dealt! Oppressive acts, too num'rous to relate; Design'd the colonies to subjugate! From town to town, it spread the sad alarms! We rouz'd indignant! and we rush'd to arms! As we, on Providence alone rely, Bear to the gallant brothers this reply; The colonists to meet them are prepar'd; We have for independence now declar'd; Which independence we most surely mean, With arms, with lives, and fortunes, to maintain. The herald rose, and made this short reply, Since ye determine Britain's strength to try; War I denounce; and let each stubborn man, Silence his crying conscience if he can: Whilst indignation flash'd from ev'ry eye; The Gen'ral said, we mean in war to try Great Britain's strength, and will not tamely yield, Tho' twice the vet'ran numbers took the field, Which she can send; and round our wide stretch'd coast, Her royal fleets, of which ye proudly boast, Shou'd be sent out, their gallant crews t' employ, T' obstruct our commerce, and our towns destroy: Distress, Any person conversant with the Transatlantic affairs must, I think, be convinced, that the sentiments conveyed to the readers in General Washington's speeches, which, according to poetic licence, I have furnished him with in this interview, and through the whole work, are his real sentiments; and that the expressions attributed to the continental commanders, and troops in general, convey no other ideas than what existed in the minds of the people through the continent of the event of the war, and of (what was commonly called) the glorious cause they were engaged in. and poverty, and ruin threat (Under a most enormous load of debt) Your state convuls'd; too heavy to be borne: By party feuds your constitution torn: Your troops, and tars, reluctant come, when sent On expeditions 'gainst the continent: And can ye think to stretch a conqu'ring hand Over such vast well peopled tracts of land! Th' enthusiastic natives train'd, and arm'd, And in the glorious cause for battle warm'd! He ceas'd, when ev'ry chief his silence broke, And ratify'd the speech the Gen'ral spoke. The herald was conducted to the shore, And this report to Britain's leaders bore, The stubborn colonists too proud to bend, In war will with their gracious king contend! Their forts they've mann'd, and fortify'd their towns, Despis'd his mercy, and defy'd his frowns! Mercy refus'd, their honours lay at stake; Compell'd a slaught'ring rough attack to make, They seem'd to think of dove-ey'd peace no more; But on Long Island's well mann'd hostile shore, They Brigadier General Cleveland of the artillery, with the other officers of the train, took their stations as each corps advanced, with which they were posted. The whole consisted of about 15000 British, with 40 pieces of cannon; besides General Heister, with his Hessians, and field-artillery. disembark'd Great Britain's threaten'd war, To force that boasted formidable bar. From Putnam's lines ten thousand sally'd forth, To prove 'gainst Britain's troops their warlike worth. Now Bunker's Hill, and that more mortal check, Which Carleton gave their forces at Quebec; Their rout through Canada, o'er Lake Champlain, And all the loss they ev'ry where sustain; Warren's, Montgom'ry's, Hendrick's, Cheesman's fall; With many more for vengeance seem'd to call: They seiz'd on hills, defiles, and woods, around, And posted stood on advantageous ground. As near their foes the British leaders drew; Boston's evacuation rose to view: They with impatience burn'd to wipe away Th' unwelcome tarnish of that gloomy day: Of Bunker's Hill, each private soldier thought, And that regretted vict'ry, dearly bought: On Norfolk's fatal bridge they ruminate; Where many gallant vet'rans met their fate! For Concord Bridge, for Lexington they grieve, As they advance lost honour to retrieve: But more than all they had endur'd beside, Boston's evacuation gall'd their pride; Most grimly ruminating on that day, When they sought safety on a wintry sea Driv'n from the shore, by their exulting foes, By hard necessity compell'd to expose Themselves, their baggage, and their mourning wives, To most apparent danger of their lives; Rather than stand the dreadful cannonade, Which Washington almost incessant made! Ready for Action, Clinton led the van, According to the steady gen'ral's plan: Cornwallis, near Flat Bush, with Donop drew; And posted stood, their enemy in view: Next, Heister to that spot his Hessians led, And Clinton onward resolutely sped, To seize a dang'rous pass, This pass was not occupied by the provincials. which might have prov'd A mortal bar, as on the Britons mov'd: Whilst gallant Percy briskly forward came, And led the main corps to the field of fame. And now, a large detachment marching round, Where the provincials occupy'd the ground; They pass'd their flank, and the dragoons drew near, With the light infantry, t' attack their rear; There 'gainst their musquetry and cannon stood, And drove th' insurgents from the shelt'ring wood: The British main corps strove their rear to gain; The colonists no longer cou'd sustain The dreadful shook; th' approaching Britons fear'd; Soon as the thirty-third in front appear'd. Heister advanc'd, and with his Hessians made Against another corps, brisk cannonade: Here, in the skirts of an adjacent wood, The chosen lev'ling rifle reg'ments stood: Unskill'd in war, or by cold tremor shook; They fought as if no certain aim they took! Or else all-ruling Providence decreed, But few assailing troops that day shou'd bleed! For through thick falling show'rs of lead they came, From rifled barrels sent, with frustrate aim! Matthew, and Donop, briskly forward led, And up a rising ground to battle sped, Rush'd on, and made superior numbers yield, And quit their brazen They took three field-pieces. thunder of the field; Join'd by the Hessians, and supported well, They on th' insurgents main corps fiercely fell; Spread wild dismay and slaughter round about, Scatter'd, pursu'd, and put them to the rout. Grant march'd along, wrapp'd in the gloom of night, And with the rising day commenc'd the fight; Near the well-posted foes, they boldly drew; The fourth and sixth brigade to battle flew; With these, the forty-second reg'ment strove, And from their stations the provincials drove: Each corps was overpow'r'd; and 'midst the shock, Udell's, Stirling's, Sullivan's, retir'd, and broke; Full gallop, the dragoons among them rode, O'er heaps of wounded, dead, and dying trod; Amongst their foes the Caledonians mix'd, Hessians, and royal guards, with bay'nets fix'd, A dreadful havoc made, and all around, With slaughter'd carcases bestrew'd the ground! They strove to gain their principal redoubt, Pursu'd, confus'd, amidst a gen'ral rout: To save his forces Putnam vainly strove; With flight precipitate, they onward drove, To the main work they rush'd, each outline past, And scarcely thought themselves secure at last: But, dreadful was the carnage In this battle, which was fought on the 27th of August 1776, the British army lost, total, 1 lieutenant-colonel, 3 captains, 1 lieutenant, 3 serjeants, 53 rank and file, killed: and 1 lieutenant-colonel, 3 captains, 8 lieutenants, 11 serjeants, 3 drummers, 231 rank and file, wounded; and 1 lieutenant, 1 serjeant, 29 rank and file, missing; and by mistaking the enemy for the Hessians, a lieutenant, and 20 marine grenadiers, taken prisoners. The Hessians lost 2 rank and file, killed; and 3 officers, and 23 rank and file, wounded. The provincials lost about 3,300, killed, wounded, prisoners, and drowned. Taken prisoners, 3 generals; Major-general Sullivan, Brigadier-general Lord Stirling, and Brigadier-general Udell; 3 colonels, 4 lieutenant-colonels, 3 majors, 18 captains, 43 lieutenants, 11 ensigns, 1 adjutant, 3 surgeons, 2 volunteers, 1006 privates. Total, 1,097 taken. They lost in this battle, and found in their redoubts, on Long Island, and Governor's Island, which they evacuated; brass ordnance, 1 five and half inch howitzer, 4 six pounders, 1 three pounder; iron ordnance, 6 thirty-two pounders, 1 twenty-four pounder, 4 eighteen, 2 twelve, 2 nine, 8 six, and 3 three pounders; total 32: shot, shells, ammunition, &amp;c. in the chace, Before they reach'd that strong constructed place. Upon their broken rear the Britons hung, Tho' from their lines their friends incessant flung A mortal show'r of balls, to lend them aid, The progress of th' assailing troops t' impede; Who forward rush'd the grand redoubt t' attack, But Howe their ardor Vide the general's own words in the London Extra-gazette, 10th of Oct. 1776: âand the army still moving on to gain the enemy's rear, the grenadiers, and 33d regiment, being in front of the column, soon approached within musket-shot of the enemy's lines at Brooklyn, from whence these battalions, without regarding, the fire of cannon and small arms upon them, pursued numbers that were retiring from the heights, so close to their principal redoubt, and with such eagerness to attack it by storm, that it required repeated orders to prevail on them to desist from their attempt, &amp;c. check'd, and held them back! So much his near approach th' insurgents fear'd, To them the works untenable appear'd: T' avoid th' expected dreaded cannonade, A circumspect and good They retreated to New York unobserved by the British, on the night of the 29th of Aug. 1776. retreat they made; And round New York design'd to make a stand, Imbody'd under Washington's command. The forces all conven'd, the Gen'ral view'd The fugitives (who pensive round him stood, Like culprits at a bar,) and thus began: How much beneath the dignity of man, Have ye behav'd, who boast ye feel the flame Of freedom, spurring on to deeds of fame! Who in her cause have now declin'd the fight; From works of such great strength have taken flight! Beware, he frowning said, another day Ye strive to wipe th' inglorious stain away; Or I shall think ye wedded so to fear, No longer worth my time, or friendly care. Fearing perhaps he might proceed too far, And drive them from the present seat of war; He smooth'd his brow, his rising rage repress'd, And in a milder tone the troops address'd: We may expect amidst their naval roar, Our foes will visit this adjacent shore; Perhaps the day of vengeance is at hand, When they debark upon our hostile strand: Havoc and ruin stretch along our shore! Norfolk, Charlestown, and Falmouth, are no more! Enthusiastic ardor now began To operate, and spread from man to man; A gen'ral shout ensu'd; aloud they cry'd, We wish to be in close engagement try'd: Tho' England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales, agree The colonists no longer shall be free; Tamely their slaves we never will be made; Through seas of blood they shall to conquest wade; If we must fall, their hardy vet'rans brave, We'll drag with us by thousands to the grave. Meanwhile, the Britons not inactive lay; But preparation made both night and day; Montressor's, and Buchannan's Isles, they seiz'd, And against Horen's Hook their batt'ries rais'd, And briskly ply'd them, to facilitate Their destin'd dang'rous In the attempt to pass between the two rocks, an artillery boat was lost, with 3 six pounders, and 4 men, on the 12th of October. passage through Hell Gate; Whilst Washington prepar'd his troops to stand, T' oppose their debarkation on the land. Near Harlem, Bloomingdale, and Horen's Hook, Some ships of war approach'd, and stations took, Threat'ning descent: whilst to Kepp's distant bay, Five PhÅnix, Roebuck, Orpheus, Carysfort, and Rose. were dispatch'd, and there prepared lay, To land the troops upon th' adjacent shore, Cover'd from danger by their friendly roar; The colonists seem'd roughly to prepare, And threaten'd fatal greeting ev'ry where. As they drew near, the British seamen made Incessant well-directed cannonade; 'Gainst which the Trans-atlantics could not stand; But unmolested, on th' unguarded strand The British rang'd; then chac'd them in their flight, And seiz'd on Inclenberg's commanding height: The colonists retir'd from place to place, As if determin'd not their foes to face! Post after post gave In the attack and taking possession of New York, on the 15th of Sept. 1776, and in the skirmish the following day, the British and Hessian forces lost 12 officers and 14 privates, killed; Major-general Vaughan and 78 privates, wounded. The provincials had a brigadier-general, a colonel, a major, and several other officers killed, and about 300 privates killed and wounded, with 20 officers, and 300 privates taken prisoners. Ordnance taken in the attacks; 1 brass six pounder, 1 five inch and half howitzer, on travelling carriages. Iron ordnance; 15 thirty-two pounders, 7 twelve pounders, 9 nine pounders, 1 six pounder, 6 four pounders, 3 three pounders, on garrison carriages; and 26 dismounted. Shot; round loose, from 32 to 12 pounders, 8,903. Double headed, from 32 to 12 pounders, 1,207. Ditto, with sliding bars, 270. Grape quilted, from 32 to 12 pounders, 140.

A large quantity of round shot, from 9 to 3 pounders. Four covered waggons. Thirty-five breast-plates for engineers armour. Fifty-two mantelets. Eighty-one chevaux de frize complete, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. On the 20th of September 1776, about midnight, several places in New York were set on fire with matches, and combustibles, that had been prepared with great art and ingenuity: about one quarter of New York is destroyed; for they took the dreadful opportunity of a very windy night. Vide General Howe's letter concerning the same. up, and march'd away, To take their stations where their main corps lay! Their foes expel'd, the regulars sat down, They thought, in safe possession of the town. The citizens rejoic'd, expecting peace, When they beheld the dreadful tumult cease; Look'd up with hearts replete with gratitude; That 'midst the storm, unhurt the city stood! Their fears were fled, and those unhappy hours, They often pass'd, when two contending pow'rs Strove for the place, and both by day and night, Threaten'd destruction 'midst a gen'ral fight! Altho' humanity so far prevail'd, That neither side, th' assailants, nor the assail'd, Had giv'n a dreadful desolating blow, To grace their entrance, or their overthrow! How soon alas! was fled their short-liv'd joy! With hearts obdur'd, determin'd to destroy, Some persons, with a most malicious will, Made preparation, with destructive skill, To bring the late spar'd city to the ground; And spread a flaming devastation round! Sullen they waited, till a storm shou'd rise, To perpetrate this horrid enterprize! In which they cou'd no more compassion show To their best friends, than an invet'rate foe! Aided by wind, the fire outrageous grew; The troops and tars, a liquid torrent threw, The rapid progress of the flames t' impede, Which had whole streets in smoking ruins laid, Before they could obtain their hearts desire, And check the fury of the spreading fire. Three weeks were in a preparation spent, To carry war upon the continent: Like Jove, 'midst flaming gloom, in awful form, The tars, careering in a thunder storm, Launch'd Britain's troops on the defended strand, Wherever the provincials made a stand: They reach'd Pell's Point, and onward march'd elate, Far as Rochelle design'd to penetrate; But at a narrow pass, they found their foes Posted, prepar'd their destin'd march t' oppose; Who fled repuls'd, and briskly were pursu'd; When, lo, in front a larger body stood; By walls, and woods, on ev'ry side secur'd; Those, a more close and fatal charge endur'd: Light infantry, and chaffeurs, made th' attack, Join'd by th' artillery, to drive them back: But ere they were dislodg'd, the Britons felt The fatal In this action, Lt. Col. Musgrave, and 20 privates were wounded; 1 capt. and 3 men killed. The enemy lost 1 colonel, 1 major, and about 90 killed and wounded. mischief rifle reg'ments dealt: At Mamaroneck many lives were lost, Where Rogers, tho' surpriz'd, maintain'd his post. As near King's Bridge, the British army drew, A gen'ral action was the point in view: Lee, Washington, and Putnam, ne'er design'd Decisive battle; and the fight declin'd: They chose not yet a gen'ral stand to make, Nor rashly throw so rich a prize at stake: Should Providence ordain, that in the end, America to Britain's force must bend; America must fall by slow delay; And not be gain'd in one decisive day: And they wou'd struggle to retard that hour, When she shou'd bend beneath Britannia's pow'r: European nations might some aid bestow Besides, in time, the troops wou'd fitter grow; And if alone compel'd th' event to try, Might on their own internal strength rely: Great Britain might grow weary of the war; Her fleets and troops sent out from home so far; Th' expence might prove too heavy to be borne, Her constitution by rude factions torn: Some neighb'ring states, who envy'd Britain's pow'r, Might take th' advantage in an evil hour, T' insult her flag, fit out an armament, And on her coast might threaten a descent; Obstruct her commerce, on her riches prey, And lop some large dependencies away: They knew the turbulence of Britain's race; And hop'd, if she shou'd suffer foul disgrace, Th' impatient public some rash steps wou'd take; Perhaps a gen'ral insurrection make! Buoy'd by these hopes, such welcome news to hear, Their main corps mov'd as if inspir'd by fear; From ev'ry post around, they chose to flee; Fort Independence, Washington, and Lee, Seem'd the grand objects worthy of their care; To the White Plains, each party else drew near; There halted with their main corps, for the fight, Near to the brunx, on each adjacent height: Behind entrenchments posted, thus they stood, Determin'd seem'd, as Britain's troops they view'd, In two grand columns, marching to the fight; Heister the left, and Clinton led the right: On the light infantry and chaffeurs sped, Before them each advanced party fled Back to their works, well fortify'd around, And station'd on a strong commanding ground: To make a near approach Raille briskly try'd, And mark'd a lofty hill unoccupy'd; There, with his Hessian brigade march'd, well pleas'd, And unoppos'd, on that strong station seiz'd. Now, on both sides, the loud artill'ry roar'd, With deadly shells, and batt'ring mischief stor'd: As to th' attack, Leslie, and Donop mov'd, The winding brunx a strong obstruction prov'd: Two reg'ments pass'd The two regiments which passed the brunx, to attack the enemy, were the 28th and 37th. The next were the 5th and 49th regiments, and the Hessian grenadiers. The loss of the provincials this day, the 28th of October 1776, was, in killed, wounded, and taken prisoners, about 250. this intercepting flood, Form'd as they landed, and in order stood: Then up th' acclivity they slowly rose, Under the fire of their superior foes: With steadiness, the fight they well maintain'd; At length the summit of the mountain gain'd; Then rushing on, with resolution strove, Routed, and from their works th' insurgents drove: Corps after corps, follow'd them up that height; But the provincials still declin'd the fight. Again the brunx a nat'ral barrier prov'd, As near their foes the British main crops mov'd: Next morn, their works, and lines, the gen'ral found Much stronger made, more tenable the ground; And with precaution an attack delay'd, Till Percy came with reinforcing aid: The danger now more formidable grew; And Washington, most prudently withdrew; If possible, the battle might be fought, On a more proper advantageous spot! From thence, the British army marching back, Determin'd on Fort Washington's attack: Strong was the ground th' insurgents occupy'd, Of access difficult on ev'ry side; Cover'd from hostile danger seem'd to be, Tho' threaten'd by the boldest enemy: And with three thousand troops completely mann'd; Possess'd of ev'ry thing the siege to stand. Before the thunder of the war was heard, Near the strong ramparts Patterson appear'd; Attend he said; again I come in peace; Resign the fort, and let destruction cease: M'Gaw, with resolution, answer gave; We know the British troops are greatly brave; Expert in war, matchless beyond compare; But in the cause of liberty, we dare To put them to the test, th' event to try; We'll hold the fort, or will with honour die. Knyphausen on their lest prepar'd for fight; Grant, Matthew, and Cornwallis, on the right; And in batteaux the forty-second went, T' alarm the fort, and make a timely feint; On their right flank the fourth division lay, And Percy led them on the dang'rous way; Th' artill'ry yawn'd, and ready stood to throw A pond'rous iron show'r against the foe, Portending dreadful havoc, 'midst the shock, When o'er Fort Washington the tempest broke! Knyphausen first advanc'd towards a wood, In which his foes posted t' advantage stood; Percy meanwhile his close approaches made, 'Midst fire of infantry, and cannonade; Stirling his Caledonians forward led, Who up the mountain vigorously They soon dispersed the enemy, and took 170 prisoners. sped; The guards, and thirty-third, follow'd their track; As on they rush'd, the colonists fell back: Percy, with his detachment briskly strove, And from an advanc'd post th' insurgents drove; As opposition yet much greater grew; To his assistance gallant Stirling flew; And up a well-defended rugged height, He led the Caledonians to the fight; Upward they forc'd, tho' steadily oppos'd; And hew'd their way oft as the battle clos'd; Meanwhile, the Hessian chief obstructed stood; Intangled in a strong defended wood; Encount'ring difficulties, as they rose; But 'midst th' attack of rough provincial foes, Knyphausen with his Hessians persever'd; Of all impediments the forest clear'd. From post to post the colonists gave way, As Rall press'd forward spreading wild dismay, Near him, Knyphausen's column made a stand; Both for surrender made a rough demand: They begg'd to treat, expressing a desire, With military honours to retire; Short time to treat Knyphausen wou'd afford; Instant surrender, or the slaught'ring sword Shou'd oft be drench'd in blood; the yawning grave, And greedy death shou'd precious morsels have: M'Gaw submitted, and the place became A friendly A return of the loss the British army sustained, in the several actions, from the 17th of September, to the 16th of November 1776, inclusive, on which day Fort Washington was attacked and taken. Killed, 1 field-officer, 3 captains, 2 subalterns, 4 serjeants, 82 rank and file, 5 horses. Wounded, 2 field-officers, 2 captains, 11 subalterns, 25 serjeants, 253 rank and file, and 4 horses. One serjeant, 46 rank and file missing. The Hessians, &amp;c. Killed, 2 captains, 3 subalterns, 1 serjeant, 64 rank and file, and 1 horse. Wounded, 2 field-officers, 2 captains, 8 subalterns, 18 serjeants, 305 rank and file, and 23 missing. Nine killed, and 18 wounded, in the PhÅnix, Roebuck, and Tartar. The provincials lost in the mean time, taken prisoners on New York Island, at the White Plains, Fort Washington, Fort Lee, and on the road leading to Hackinsack, in the Jerseys; 5 colonels, 6 lieutenant-colonels, 8 majors, 51 captains, 117 lieutenants, 32 ensigns, 20 surgeons, adjutants, &amp;c. 3,095 rank and file; 2,607 of which occupied Fort Washington. Their killed and wounded, uncertain. Brass ordnance; 1 thirteen inch mortar, 1 ten inch ditto, 2 five and half inch ditto, howitzers. Iron ordnance; 9 thirty-two pounders, 5 twenty-four pounders, 4 eighteen pounders, 15 twelve pounders, 15 nine pounders, 31 six pounders, 49 four pounders, 16 three pounders, 2 thirteen inch mortars, 1 ten inch ditto, 1 eight inch ditto. Shot, round loose, from 32 pounders to 6 pounders, 2,339, and 900 three pounders; case, from 32 to 6 pounders, 774; 1,159 double-headed shot of sorts; 42 boxes for grape; shells, from 13 inch to 4 inch and two-fifths, 4,577; 15 powder-barrels, 2,800 muskets, near 40,0000 musket-cartridges; 27 tons of bar and rod iron, 500 intrenching tools of sorts; 6 sets of armourers tools, 200 hand-barrows, 1 gyn complete; 2 sling carts, 200 iron fraizes, of 400 lb. weight each, supposed to be intended to stop the navigation of Hudson's River, with a large quantity of other species of stores, &amp;c. not ascertained. fort, and bore Knyphausen's name. Hostile Fort Lee next their attention drew, Where yet aloft provincial banners flew; 'Gainst which, Cornwallis was to battle sent; None strove his near advances to prevent From thence two thousand ran, nor staid to see The colours of th' approaching enemy! Safety seem'd uppermost in ev'ry mind; They left their baggage, tents, and stores behind! Retreating still in haste, and marching on, They pass'd, and broke the bridge of Rariton; Grant, and Cornwallis, follow'd them behind, For Philadelphia, they first design'd; But cou'd not bring their purposes to bear; Safe, the provincials pass'd the Delaware. Here their precaution visibly appear'd; (As they the quick advancing Britons fear'd;) From the north shore they took the boats away, Causing an unsurmountable delay; Effectually retarding a pursuit, To shun if possible, the rough dispute. At Pennington, Cornwallis took his post; Where all his march and labour was not lost; Both forage and provisions were secur'd, Which made amends for hardships they'd endur'd Through fourscore miles, a long continu'd chace Of foes, removing quick from place to place. Harcourt was sent a reconnoitring round, With some light horse, to traverse hostile ground; From Lee, a rustic messenger drew near, Whose words and actions spoke internal fear: His only choice was death, or to betray The place, where Lee, with near two thousand lay: Life was his choice, he trembling backward sped, And to the spot the British party led: (So intercepted Dolon, much dismay'd, The secrets of the Trojan camp betray'd:) But weakly guarded they the gen'ral found, And Harcourt's With 30 dragoons he soon overpowered the guard, took General Lee prisoner, and brought him to New York. wishes with success were crown'd. From the main corps, with a detachment sent, Attended by a naval armament, To Newport, Clinton, Percy, Prescot, came, And seiz'd Rhode Island in their sov'reign's name. Long time success attended Britain's arms, And fill'd contending foes with sad alarms; Flush'd with success, they travers'd far and wide, A large extent of country occupy'd: Thus, pow'rful fate for the provincials wrought, British detachments might be distant caught. To cold intense at length compell'd to yield, Stern winter drove both parties from the field. Tho' Washington repeatedly retir'd From post to post, (and not too rashly fir'd) Had quitted ev'ry advantageous spot To shun his foes; nor ever cou'd be brought To gen'ral action; yet he mov'd not far; But, with intention to prolong the war, Cautious, and vigilant, he hover'd round, Where Britain's forces occupy'd the ground: Near Trenton first he made a slight attack; The Germans drove those first assailants back, This was a prelude to the destin'd blow, The carnage, rout, and Hessian overthrow, And to the brigade prov'd (on duty there) A deep-laid well-concerted fatal snare. Next morning, with a much superior force, Towards the Hessian post, they bent their course; They rouz'd to arms, and Rall, who bore command, First vainly strove to make his reg'ment stand: But Washington at proper distance stood, Calm, and delib'rate, their disorder view'd; Which gave them opportunity to form, And brought the Hessians onward to the storm; Flush'd with success on the preceding day, Rall scorn'd defensive war, and slow delay! The regiments of Rall and Losberg chose, With which t' advance against th' assailing foes: With caution, Washington each movement made; And cover'd his approach with cannonade: Cannon to cannon, sometime stood oppos'd; Next, the light infantry in battle clos'd: A large provincial main corps stood in view; On either flank, their wings to battle flew; A strong reserve advancing, quick drew near, To take their station in the Hessian rear; Knyphausen's regiment advanc'd in vain, Losberg's, and Rall's, thus threaten'd, to sustain; Like fiercest beasts in toils by hunters caught, With lifeless hope the hard-press'd Hessians fought: One hour they vig'rous strove at glory's call; And Scheffer, Brethaur, Haustein, Deckow, Rall, In the wide sanguin'd bed of honour lay, Depriv'd of life on that important day: And now the Hessian resolution fail'd; In front, and rear, and either flank assail'd: The chasseurs, and dragoons, shun'd the dispute, And with two hundred This attack was made on the Hessians on the 26th of December 1776, as the New York account says, by about 12,000. The provincial account says, the attack was made against about 1,500 Hessians, by about 2,500 men with 20 brass field-pieces, under the command of General Washington, Major-general Sullivan, and General Green; and speaks of General Ewing's, and General Cadwallader's divisions, with cannon, being impeded by ice, as they advanced to give the Hessians battle. The above is the best account can be obtained. The Hessians lost 918, which were taken prisoners, with their arms, 6 brass field-pieces, 3 pounders; 3 ammunition-waggons. The number of killed and wounded, on each side, very uncertain, but not great. of the scatter'd foot, Gave the provincials an impetuous shock; And through the fiercest opposition broke; Whilst Losberg's, Rall's, Knyphausen's corps became Prisoners of war, and suff'rers in their fame. A safe retreat was Washington's next view; Across the Delaware with speed he flew; With heart elate, and glorious vict'ry grac'd, His pris'ners, and the cannon, safely plac'd. Towards Prince Town some thousands march'd along, The sev'nteenth reg'ment, not three hundred strong, Advanc'd in view, and rushing to th' attack, O'erpower'd, and drove their advanc'd parties back; When soon the danger formidable grew: With threat'ning front presented to their view, Mercer's main corps appear'd; they slack'd the chace, Fell back, and chose the most convenient place: Posted behind a fence, compact they stood; Their brisk advancing foes most grimly view'd; Who, full of confidence, came on, and made Against their front a furious canonnade: The Britons shouting, of incumbrance eas'd, The lucky moment for an onset seiz'd; A show'r of bullets first before them sent, And in a cloud of smoke, they next present Their petrifying fronts, and fiercely mix'd In close conjunction, with their bay'nets fix'd: As if provincial ardor was expir'd, Which had enthusiastic bosoms fir'd! Had on the sev'nteenth reg'ment been bestow'd, With which both officers, and privates glow'd! So was this rude disorder'd battle fought: Mawhood led on, each individual caught His martial glow, and with a rapid shock, Twice through their main corps most resistless broke! As when Achilles on the Phrygian plain, Drove o'er the wounded, dying, and the slain; His myrmidons the warrior's tract pursu'd, And for themselves wide lanes of carnage hew'd: Again they turn'd to make a third attack; But Mawhood, more consid'rate, held them back; Yet, on the continental broken rear They brought their own artillery to bear; A thund'ring Vide the letter from General Sir William Howe in the London Gazette, Feb. 25th 1777; in which he says, the loss sustained on the 3d of Jan. 1777, by the 17th, 40th, and 55th regiments, is 17 killed; among which is the Hon. Captain Leslie, of the 17th, and nearly 200 wounded, and missing. General Howe says nothing for certain of the number of the killed and wounded of the enemy, but General Mercer from Virginia. Other accounts say they were between 5 and 6000; that the 17th regiment so confused them, that they retired in such disorder as to give them an opportunity to turn their own cannon upon their rear: that the provincials had above 400 killed and wounded; among the slain, 11 officers, and a General Mercer. farewell roar'd, with show'rs of shot, To drive them distant from the fatal spot! Next, in their way two British reg'ments fell, Who dar'd not strive such numbers to repel; But as they made approaches, wheel'd about, To Brunswick march'd, and shun'd their destin'd route: As chasing they march'd on, the gallant Scott, A small detachment led towards the spot; With baggage of the fourth brigade drew near, Intrusted to his courage, skill, and care: Conquest seem'd facile, and they fix'd their eyes With chearful aspect on the precious prize: But, unexpected warm reception found; Scott, and his escort, firmly stood their ground! Courage, he cry'd; the rest his actions spoke; Whilst he through thickest ranks like Mawhood broke! And with his little corps maintain'd the fray, Around the spot, where all the baggage lay! The colonists convinc'd of their mistake, Observing them such dreadful havoc make; Finding the whole so martially inspir'd, In discontent, without their prey retir'd! Cornwallis, in his station, from afar, Heard the loud thunder of the distant war; And hastily advanc'd towards the spot, Where those unequal battles had been fought; Too late the British forces reach'd the place, And distant in the rear commenc'd the chace; Some hours before the colonists were gone, Acting, as when they pass'd the They broke the bridges as they passed, and chose a strong post. Rariton; By sad experience taught, the Britons found They occupy'd too large a space of ground; Time after time, from each interior post, In haste, confus'd, they march'd towards the coast; Expecting Britain's tars wou'd interpose With naval aid, against their gath'ring foes. Sometimes, when parties an excursion made, Advancing near some fatal ambuscade; The privates fell amidst the sudden strife, And oft the leaders were depriv'd of life. The foragers Vide Gazettes, Annual Registers, Remembrancers, &amp;c. in large detachments fought, And shouted for a vict'ry dearly bought! Thus, like two scales, (such was the will of fate,) Both sides alternately preponderate; Sometimes the colonists felt sad dismay; And in their turn, the British troops gave way. Tho' on the land, the colonists might boast, They'd driv'n the Britons from each distant post; Had oft in rough and close encounters stood; An Hessian brigade likewise had subdu'd; Were busily employ'd 'midst snow and frost, And had recover'd half the ground they'd lost: Far otherwise, upon the sea they far'd; The wintry storms the British seamen dar'd: Cruiz'd in the Delaware, along their shores, Took ships of war, and trading ships with stores; In diff'rent parts, some hundreds thus they seiz'd, And baulk'd the sanguine expectations rais'd; On which the Trans-atlantics firm rely'd, They shou'd in winter months be well supply'd, By various ships arriving from afar, With cloathing, and all implements of war; This caus'd distress, and want, and discontent, And great heart-burnings thro' the continent; At an enormous price, all things were sold; By war, by pinching poverty, and cold, And sad uncertainty, at once assail'd, They waver'd, and their resolution fail'd! It might grow worse! yet some faint hopes remain, That when they shou'd begin the next campaign, Success might crown their arms, by land and sea, Relieve their wants, and drive their fears away: This their sheet-anchor prov'd; some great event, In favour of the northern continent, Might in the womb of time be grown mature, And they might money, men, and arms procure, Firm leagu'd with some European potentates; Or else assisted by mercantile states: The congress persever'd in the grand cause, And suffer'd none to violate their laws; In their resolves inflexible remain'd; Provisions, cloathing, arms, and money gain'd: Their levies they wou'd make, men they wou'd have; And only this alternative they gave; All able men shou'd their assistance yield, Shou'd taxes pay, or march into the field. The Britons too, on Neptune's element, Oft had sufficient cause for discontent; Their ships of war, and merchant fleets, were tost In dreadful storms, and on the coast were lost: Provisions, cloathing, arms, and powder, sent, For British soldiers, on the continent, Were by provincial cruisers made a prey, To cloath, feed, arm the troops, in hostile pay: This caus'd an heavy national expence, At which th' indignant public took offence: Th' embarrass'd ministry were driv'n to raise Annual supplies, by some disgustful ways: Losses increas'd; taxes more heavy grew; Which all the nation into ferment threw: Thus was Great Britain, and the continent, Harrass'd, and vex'd, and torn by discontent. Soon as th' inclement season wou'd permit Both sides their winter residence to quit, Bird, March 23d 1777, Colonel Bird, with about 500 men, landed at Peek's Kill, Connecticut, and by them, and the enemy, were burnt and destroyed 7 houses, mills, and stores, containing about 1300 barrels of flour, and 6000 bushels of wheat, 410 hogsheads of rum, 1 pipe of brandy, 150 hogsheads of melasses, 30 barrels of beef, 170 barrels of pork, 150 waggons and carts with harness 150 barrels of biscuit, 50 casks of tallow, 30 chests of candles, 12 casks of coffee, 9 cases of chocolate, 200 iron pots and camp-kettles, 500 canteens, bowls, &amp;c. 400 entrenching tools, 30 casks of nails, a magazine of hay and straw, one loaded ammunition-waggon, and arms: besides several houses, and buildings of lesser note, containing large quantities of pitch, tar, candles, soap, straw, hay, grain for cattle, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. which could not be ascertained; with several sloops and boats, and a twelve-pounder; and brought off several boats laden with some valuable articles. There were but few killed and wounded on either side. On the 13th of April 1777, Lord Cornwallis surprized, and defeated a provincial corps, at Bound Brook; killed 30, and took between 80 and 90 prisoners, and 3 brass field pieces; with only 7 wounded. Vide General Howe's letter in the London Gazette, 5th of June 1777. and Cornwallis, from their quarters mov'd; Successful both their enterprizes prov'd. Now Tryon rouz'd to strike a wasting blow; And make a deep incursion 'gainst the foe; Long way the Britons march'd o'er hostile ground; Large magazines at Danbury they found, Well fill'd with stores of almost ev'ry kind, For military purposes design'd: Prudence suggested they must soon retire; The stores, and village, were destroy'd by fire: Next morn, towards the shore they march'd away, Where Duncan's naval force at anchor lay; Arnold had form'd a breastwork, to retard The British troops; who found their passage barr'd; Across their path th' impediment was rais'd, And Wooster now the fit occasion seiz'd, To vex the flanks, and press upon the rear, To spread confusion, and inspire with fear: Agnew, and Erskine, each attempt oppos'd, And ev'ry corps repel'd whene'er they clos'd; Whilst under cover of a cannonade, 'Gainst Arnold, Tryon quick advances made; His wonted bravery the chief display'd, Undaunted fought, as scorning to recede. Charg'd in their flanks, and rear, and held at bay, The Britons seem'd to feel no cold dismay; But fac'd each way, where any foes were found, Bore down, or drove them to more distant ground: And now, 'gainst Arnold's post they briskly sped, By Tryon, Erskine, Stewart, Agnew led; With Emulation fir'd, all forward push'd, And o'er the breastwork resolutely rush'd; And like a torrent rising o'er a mound, Swept ev'ry foe from the disputed ground: The gen'ral's steed receiv'd a mortal blow, As he retir'd amidst that overthrow; Soon disengag'd, erect he trod the ground, And cautious cast his threat'ning glances round; His pistols drew, when lo, before the rest, To seize his prey, a British soldier prest; Arnold was on a firm resistance bent, With certain aim, a fatal bullet sent; His rough assailant on the spot expir'd, Whilst safely, he 'midst show'rs of balls retir'd. That night, at Ridgefield Tryon's troops remain'd, Well posted on the ground in battle gain'd; Next morn they forward mov'd at early dawn; Meantime, their foes more formidable grown, Well reinforc'd, and with artill'ry too, On all sides round them boldly nearer drew; Their march retarded to the distant coast, Disputing ev'ry advantageous post. 'Mongst those who strove the Britons to impede, Lamb, Henman, Atwater, their worth display'd; Gould, Oswald, Whiting, Huntington, and Cooe, From one post routed, to another flew; Arnold, and Silliman, t' annoy their foes, With cautious vigilance their stations chose. As stalks a lion rouz'd across a plain, Attended by the distant hunting train; Thus, amidst thousands which around them pour'd, The reg'lars march'd, and grim defiance low'r'd. Amidst a cannonade both sides maintain'd, The Britons now the height of campo gain'd; When double numbers of their gath'ring foes, In gen'ral battle seem'd resolv'd to close; Indignant, Stewart mark'd the bold design, And rush'd intrepid thro' th' advancing line, By twelve supported, with their bay'nets fix'd, And with the bravest of th' assailants mix'd: By Stewart's gallantry at first inspir'd, By Tryon, Agnew, Erskine, nobly fir'd; As bursting shells spread death, and wild dismay, Th' expanding main corps scorning slow delay, Sprung forward to the charge on ev'ry side, And with provincial blood their bay'nets dy'd: Thro' thickest ranks of foes they rapid sped, Who fell, or fought confus'd, or trembling fled: Lamb, Henman, Gould, and Atwater in vain Made bold attempts the battle to maintain; Each effort fail'd th' assailants to repel; They scorn'd retreat, and fighting bravery fell! Coo's, Oswald's, Silliman's examples fail'd, To make those stand, whom Britain's troops assail'd; As vainly Arnold call'd to stop their flight, To stand! to rally! and renew the fight! Tho' gallantly expos'd, he strove to bar The further progress of the steely war; All fled; and to the charge return'd no more; Whilst Tryon unmolested Major-general Tryon's detachment consisted of about 2000 men from the 4th, 15th, 23d, 27th, 44th, and 64th regiments, and Brigadier-general Brown's corps, with 12 of the 17th light dragoons, and 6 light field-pieces. They landed on the 25th of April 1777, in the afternoon, about 20 miles from Danbury; which place they reached in the afternoon of the 26th, without much opposition. With the village of Danbury, they burnt and destroyed, at different places, a quantity of ordnance-stores, with iron, &amp;c. 4000 barrels of beef and pork, 1100 barrels of flour, 100 large tierces of biscuit, 89 barrels of rice, 120 puncheons of rum, 100 hogsheads of rum, several large stores of wheat, oats, and Indian corn, in bulk; 30 pipes of wine, 100 hogsheads of sugar, 50 hogsheads of melasses, 20 casks of coffee, 15 large casks filled with medicines, 10 barrels of saltpetre, 1,320 tents, and marquees, several chests of arms, 5000 pairs of shoes and slockings, a number of iron boilers, a large quantity of hospital bedding, &amp;c. engineers, pioneers, and carpenters tools, a printing-press complete, paper cartridges, field forges, tar, tallow, &amp;c. Killed, wounded, and missing of the British. Total killed, 1 drummer, 1 fife, 23 rank and file. Wounded, 3 field-officers, 6 captains, 3 subalterns, 9 serjeants, 92 rank and file; 28 missing. The provincials lost. Killed, General Wooster, Col. Lamb of the artillery. Colonels Gould and Henman; Dr. Atwater; 1 captain, 1 lieutenant, and 100 privates. Wounded, 1 colonel, 1 captain, 1 lieutenant, and 250 privates. Taken prisoners, 50 privates, including several committee men. left the shore. The gallant Meigs, Colonel Meigs (who with General Arnold, was one of the 25 selected to begin the storm of Quebec) conducted this enterprize. The detachment consisted of about 130 men, who crossed the Sound in whale-boats, and landed about four miles from Sagg Harbour, at the east end of Long Island; on the 23d of May 1777, they reached Sagg Harbour, and altho' they met a vigorous resistance from the guard, a company of foot, the crews of 12 small vessels, and an armed schooner, with round and grape shot, they boldly persevered, and finished their enterprize: they burnt 12 brigs and sloops, which lay at the wharf; and entirely destroyed every thing belonging to the forces on shore, and brought off with them about 90 prisoners. griev'd at this overthrow, Endeavour'd to retaliate the blow; Having the destin'd expedition plann'd, His whale-boats with an active party mann'd, Evading Britain's cruisers in the Sound, They boldly landed on forbidden ground, And to Sagg Harbour briskly march'd away, Where large supplies for Britain's forces lay; There, whilst oppos'd by naval cannonade, O'erpow'r'd the guard, and flaming havoc made. Both parties busily themselves employ'd; Alternately each other much annoy'd: Prescot and Barrington, like Lee, were caught, And learn'd too late (by sad experience taught) The vigilance, and brav'ry of their foes, Who roughly rouzing them from sweet repose, With hostile haste (a rescue to prevent) They General Howe mentions Major-general Prescot being surprised in his quarters, with Lieutenant Barrington, on the 10th of July 1777. This enterprize was performed by the Colonels Meigs and Barton; to whom, with their officers and men, the congress voted thanks for their valour, activity, and address, in the enterprize; and an elegant sword was given to each of the colonels. bore them pris'ners to the continent! The colonists their firm resolves display'd; Acting as if they had been undismay'd; Fleet after fleet they lost, yet sent out more; Their merchandize to distant nations bore; With foreigners lucrative bargains made For liberty within their ports to trade.

Fraser and Grant advanc'd towards the foe; Francis retir'd both cautiously and slow; He knew where best their passage to dispute; To face, to stand, and strive to check pursuit. Grant and the grenadiers were first oppos'd, And with the colonists in battle clos'd; Fraser and Hill soon after were engag'd, Where the long-doubtful battle chiefly rag'd; There, strongly posted the provincials stood, 'Midst bushes, trees, and rocks, and logs of wood: At length dislodg'd, no longer cou'd contend; Seeming to Castletown their march to bend; But here, the grenadiers oppos'd their flight; Again they rally'd, and renew'd the fight; Routed again, to Pittford's rising ground They mov'd with speed, but there no passage found, Upon the summit The grenadiers scrambled up what had appeared an inaccessible part of the ascent, and gained the summit before them. stood the grenadiers; And now they seem'd General Burgoyne wrote. This happened on the 7th of July 1777. The provincials had about 2000 chosen men in the action, strongly posted, commanded by Col. Francis, a brave and experienced officer. The British detachment, under Brigadier-general Fraser, Col. Hill, &amp;c. consisted of only 850 fighting men, brought up to battle. The provincials lost Col. Francis, and many other officers, and upwards of 200 privates, above 600 wounded (many of which perished in the woods, attempting to get off); one colonel, 7 captains, 10 subalterns, and 210 privates, taken prisoners.

The provincials acknowledge 4 or 500 missing, and say the British lost 300 killed. oppress'd by growing fears; Dislodg'd, confus'd, on ev'ry side fell back, When Reidesel and Berner made th' attack; Towards Fort Anne they mov'd with quicken'd pace, And the ninth reg'ment foremost in the chace, Was intercepted in the dang'rous course; Six times out-number'd by superior force! Hill entertain'd no thought of falling back; Firm, and determin'd, stood the rough attack! Powell mov'd on the reg'ment to sustain, And Phillips hasten'd with the batt'ring train; But found such obstacles his march t' impede, He came not soon enough to give them aid: Three hours they bore each oft-repeated shock! Held their position firm, and never broke! At length their foes inclin'd to hemm them round; In hottest fight the reg'ment chang'd the ground! So formidable now they seem'd t'appear; That bold manÅuvre fill'd their foes with fear: They slack'd their fire, cooler and cooler grew, And to Fort Edward from the field withdrew. Thus far, the Britons had advantage gain'd; A more laborious dang'rous task remain'd; Batteaux and stores again must leave the lake, And over land General Burgoyne, in his letter in the London Gazette, 1st Nov. 1777, writes, âFrom the 30th of July, to the 15th of Aug. 1777, every possible measure was employed to bring forward the batteaux, provisions, and ammunition, from Fort George to the first navigable part of Hudson's River; a distance of 18 miles: the roads in some parts steep, and in others, wanting great repair, &amp;c. Fifty teams of oxen were found far inadequate to assist, to feed the army, and form a magazine at the same time. Ten or twelve oxen were employed on a single batteau; and after the utmost exertions, for 15 days, there were not above 4 days provisions before-hand, nor above 10 batteaux in the Hudson's River.â a tardy passage make! Must from Fort George to Hudson's River ride, Be dragg'd perforce, not onward gently glide! Nat'ral impediments their passage barr'd On ev'ry side, the Britons to retard; They pass'd swamps, bogs, defiles, 'midst slow delay, And tardily through forests hew'd their way; Or stumbled disarray'd, and hourly toil'd Through roads the cautious colonists had spoil'd; Where trees were transverse fell'd, or lengthways laid, The progress of the British troops t' impede. Baum, This expedition was undertaken about the 15th of Aug. 1777. Col. Baum was dispatched with about 500 Germans, and 2 light field-pieces. Lieutenant-colonel Breymen advanced to sustain them; but came too late, with the Brunswick grenadiers, light infantry, and chasseurs. General Burgoyne says, the British and Germans had about 400 men killed and taken, and 26 officers, mostly prisoners: the enemy's loss, in killed and wounded, he says, is more than ours, as prisoners and deserters say, and the inhabitants, who saw the dead buried. The provincial Brigadier-general Starks, in his account of the action, writes that they took 4 pieces of cannon from the Germans, with all their baggage, a number of horses, carriages, &amp;c. killed upwards of 200 in the field, took about 700 prisoners; the number of the wounded not known. with five hundred, was detach'd away To Bennington, where some provisions lay; As he advanc'd, false friends from many parts, Came pouring in, with mischief in their hearts; Upon whose oaths and friendship he rely'd; But when they came in battle to be try'd, They 'gainst his troops a mortal volley fir'd, And to the foes exultingly retir'd! On all sides round them, Baum's detachment heard Disheart'ning shouts, and suddenly appear'd The num'rous parties of provincial foes, Who, for th' attack this friendly signal chose! Secure in numbers, in a dreadful form, Onward they came, like an impetuous storm; Baum on defence was resolutely bent, And from the cannon mortal greeting sent; Each other corps, with Fraser's marksmen try'd To thin their foes, hard press'd on ev'ry side: Fresh numbers pouring in, the battle gain'd, They fled, and almost total loss sustain'd: To their assistance Breymen came too late, And bravely fought he might not share their fate; With most determin'd resolution strove, And thrice from heights provincial victors drove! Still to the charge the colonists return'd, And for revenge with double fury burn'd! Now Breymen's ammunition spent, no more His cannon bellow'd with destructive roar: Th' assailants rushing on brisk efforts made, Seiz'd the mute guns, and drove him retrograde. Still nearer Albany the Britons drew; A bridge of boats o'er Hudson's River threw: A storm had all their former labour cross'd; A bridge of rafts was swept away, and lost: Unheedful of th' event, they pass'd the same, And marching on, to Saratoga came. Repairing bridges now more frequent grew, As they advanc'd, and nearer Arnold drew; Who, like a couchant lion, ready lay, With Morgan, Lincoln, Gates, to seize their prey A most convenient spot of ground they chose, To stop the progress of advancing foes. Burgoyne resolv'd their utmost strength to prove; He must this living obstacle remove; Or backward push'd retire, (harrass'd and foil'd) Over the ground through which the troops had toil'd: Th' access was difficult, a ravin lay With broken bridges, in th' assailants way: Burgoyne led up the center to the fight, And Fraser made a circuit on the right, To keep the height already they possess'd; Whilst Reidesel and Phillips forward press'd, And labour'd hard the destin'd spot to gain In time, they might the British line sustain. The height of Baumus Arnold occupy'd, His camp well mann'd, the ground well fortify'd; But Morgan's riflemen possess'd the ground, Advanc'd in front; and sev'ral corps around, Their stations took, and first commenc'd th' attack, T' impede, or drive the scouts and flankers back; Who halted, fought, disdaining to retire, Or forward push'd, returning fire for fire: The British vanguard now had pass'd the wood, When Morgan's corps, who station'd ready stood, Began a rough attack, stopp'd their career, Their line disorder'd, and inspir'd with fear: Still pressing near, compell'd them to retire Before the riflemens superior fire: But soon they rally'd, and the ground regain'd, By timely reinforcements well sustain'd: Now Morgan's corps, in turn dishearten'd grew, Amidst a show'r of balls th' artill'ry threw; From Arnold's camp, with visible design A party mov'd, t' outflank the British line; Fraser and Breymen posted there they found; They wheel'd, retir'd, and soon retrod the ground; And countermarching, to the left they drove, And briskly there to make impression strove; Phillips and Reidesel here cross'd their way, Their ardor check'd, and held them at a bay. Burgoyne and Hamilton in concert mov'd; Alternately each other's succour prov'd: Vig'rous and fierce both parties onward prest, And roughly put each other to the test; Oft as Burgoyne's and Arnold's battle clos'd, Riflemen stood to riflemen oppos'd: Here, Fraser's marksmen spread destruction round; There, Morgan's corps strew'd the disputed ground With dead and wounded; whilst in turn they felt The leaden vengeance hostile parties dealt: Fraser and Hamilton their ground maintain'd, Incessant fought, and hard-earn'd honor gain'd: Unequal war the British forces wag'd, Against superior numbers long engag'd: Three hours their firmness Arnold's party try'd, With reinforcements from the camp supply'd: Envelop'd in thick clouds of smoke they came; In peals of thunder, wrapp'd in sulph'rous flame, Th' advancing British veterans drew near; Met them half way, and stopp'd their bold career: The vig'rous, rough, and long attack that day, Chiefly against three The 20th, 21st, and 62d regiments; the most parts of which were engaged near four hours without intermission. Vide General Burgoyne's account of the action. British cohorts lay! Fraser judiciously the fight survey'd, And reinforc'd Burgoyne with timely aid; Who briskly was in front and flanks assail'd; But Hamilton, whose ardor never fail'd, Good succour prov'd, unshaken as a rock, Barr'd Arnold's course, and bore each hostile shock. Th' assailants onward like a torrent drove; And with repeated efforts, briskly strove To gain the flank of Britain's hard-press'd line; Phillips advanc'd to frustrate their design; Up to the spot the twentieth reg'ment brought; Both officers, and em'lous privates caught His warlike flame, and 'gainst their foes prevail'd; Who, from th' assailants, now became th' assail'd: Jones, Williams, and Blomefield, th' artill'ry ply'd, And flung destruction round on ev'ry side: To check the slaughter of their cannonade, A brisk advance a strong detachment made; The British forces grim defiance low'r'd, And round one cannon resolutely pour'd: Both parties seem'd to scorn ignoble flight; And This intelligence came from a provincial officer, in his account of the action. He likewise writes, the British troops lost in killed, wounded, and prisoners, near 1000; of which, 50 are prisoners; that the provincials had 100 killed, 160 wounded, and none taken prisoners. General Burgoyne's account of the British loss, is 13 officers killed; 15 officers wounded; and about 300 rank and file killed, wounded, and missing. thrice each vanquish'd corps renew'd the fight! Jones persever'd, till in the mortal strife, The gallant Ancient Briton lost his life. O'er wounded, groaning, dying, and the dead, Surviving and contending soldiers tread, With hard-knit brows, and fury in their eyes, To seize, drag off, and keep the precious prize: So, for Patroclus slain, old heroes strove; From ev'ry part the troops in tumult drove; To gain the body Greeks and Trojans toil'd; Trojans and Greeks alternately were foil'd. At length the British troops most grimly pleas'd, Firmly determin'd on the cannon seiz'd, Put the provincials to a final rout, And dragg'd it off with a triumphant shout. In other parts the battle was severe, As if both sides had bid adieu to fear: Green, Clark, and Petersham, where danger frown'd, And duty call'd, quick travers'd o'er the ground, That reinforcements might in time oppose, And check the fire of fresh advancing foes, When any hard-press'd party grew dismay'd, And anxious look'd around for friendly aid. Gates, Lincoln, Glover, busily employ'd, Successively their enemies annoy'd; Whilst Arnold oft to make impression try'd, And Morgan's corps their rifled barrels ply'd, To thin the ranks, and break that living bar, Which stood so firm 'gainst Arnold's vig'rous war. To various parts detachments briskly mov'd, Each side by turns, victors and vanquish'd prov'd. Exhausted nature warn'd them to retire; But innate courage, and avenging ire, For slain and wounded friends, and love of fame, Still fann'd, and kept alive the warlike flame: Till night they stood disputing for the ground, Advanc'd, retir'd, and travers'd briskly round: At length the colonists inclin'd to yield, And left the Britons the disputed This battle was fought on the 19th of Sept. 1777, near Stillwater. Gen. Burgoyne, in his letter in the London Gazette, Dec. 15th 1777, says âJust as the light closed, the enemy gave ground on all sides, and left us completely masters of the field of battle; with the loss of about 500 men on their side, and, as supposed, thrice that number wounded. The behaviour of the officers, and men in general, was exemplary. Brigadier-general Fraser took his position in the beginning of the day, with great judgment, and sustained the action with constant presence of mind and vigor. Brigadier-general Hamilton was the whole time engaged, and acquitted himself with great honour, activity, and good conduct. The artillery, in general, was distinguished; and the brigade under Capt. Jones, who was killed in the action, was conspicuously so.â field; Who, mournfully, the dear-bought ground survey'd, Thick strew'd with heaps of dying and the dead. Burgoyne soon learnt, by sad experience taught, Only for honour, Britain's troops had fought: The wary colonists, already foil'd, With indefatigable vigor toil'd, To fortify the camp on ev'ry side, To stand the test when next in battle try'd: So strong already Arnold's right appear'd, It seem'd secure, no threat'ning dangers fear'd: From the like work the Britons never ceas'd, Their labours, doubts, and fears, and foes increas'd: Nor Howe, nor Clinton had assistance sent; Time fled away, provisions almost spent; In front, unnumber'd obstacles remain'd; 'Twas dang'rous to re-tread the ground they'd gain'd: Burgoyne still more embarrass'd grew, and found Superior hostile numbers gath'ring round; And as the threat'ning dangers greater grew, Ticonderoga was the point in view; But Arnold, Lincoln, Gates, with treble force, And nat'ral obstacles, oppos'd his course; Impenetrable bars their parties lay, Through which his troops must force their sanguin'd way; Humanity likewise suggests the thought, The sick and wounded shou'd be forward brought; A sad dilemma! words cannot express The great embarrassment, the deep distress! Must they desert their friends on hostile ground! And add more poignant pangs to ev'ry wound! Johnson Those commanders had met a much greater opposition than was at first expected, and their Indians began to grow discontented. Col. St. Leger in particular; although he had killed 400 of a detachment, who came to the relief of Fort Stanwix, was obliged to raise the siege, and retire towards Canada, and give up all thoughts of forcing a passage down the Mohawk River, to join Gen. Burgoyne, when he heard of the approach of Gen. Lincoln towards him; who advanced with a detachment of several thousands, joined by Col. Brown, who arrived about the 18th of September 1777, took possession of several places, and demanded a surrender of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence: a reinforcement arriving from Crown Point, the colonists quitted the enterprize, after having twice summoned Brigadier-general Powell to no purpose, and having tried, during the course of four days, several attacks; but were repulsed in all; in which Gen. Powell, Capt. Taylor of the 21st regiment, Lt. Beecroft, &amp;c. behaved gallantly. The provincials, in their progress, took 2 captains, 11 subalterns, 280 privates, and retook 100 of their own men: they took likewise 200 batteaux in Lake Champlain, &amp;c. with several large gun-boats, and an armed sloop, ammunition, arms, cannon, &amp;c. by the capture of which Gen. Burgoyne writes they were enabled to attack Diamond Island in two divisions, where Capt. Aubrey was posted with two companies of the 47th regiment: the enemy were repulsed by Capt. Aubrey, with great loss, and pursued by the gun-boats under his command, to the East Shore; where two of their principal vessels were retaken, with all the cannon. They had just time to set fire to the other batteaux, and retreated over the mountains. had not a rapid progress made; St. Leger too was moving retrograde. Scalpers, The savages were much restrained from their usual mode of scalping, butchery, and plunder; and after the murder of the unfortunate Miss M'Crea, (who was coming to the British camp, as was reported, to be married to an officer;) they were held under greater restraint, and watched with a jealous eye; which not agreeing with their ferocious dispositions, they at length withdrew, as did many of the Canadians and volunteers, when the provincials gathered round them, and threatened them with total overthrow. provincials, and Canadians fled From threat'ning danger near, and homeward sped; Thus by desertion thinn'd, both night and day, The British mould'ring army shrunk away. No cause they had to keep their hopes alive, Clinton, or Howe, with succours cou'd arrive: Burgoyne with fifteen hundred vet'rans close T' attempt to pass, or to dislodge their foes; They watch'd Burgoyne, each operation knew; Rapid and sudden 'gainst his left they flew; Nor wou'd they to that spot th' attack confine, They stretch'd themselves across the German line; Ackland and Reidesel, out-number'd far, Sustain'd the shock, and strove their course to bar: From Arnold's camp, another party rush'd Against the right, and onward briskly push'd: Britons, and Germans, yet unbroken fought; Oft anxious turn'd, but none fresh succours brought; No friendly reinforcements cou'd they see, To check the brisk advancing enemy; Who like a thunder-cloud towards them came, With gloomy front, thick wrapt in sulph'rous flame: No respite cou'd the British forces have, By foes out-number'd, vigorous and brave. Th' advantage gain'd, the colonists improv'd; From Arnold's camp another party mov'd Against the stagger'd left, who faintly bore This second shock, and cou'd engage no more; But overpow'r'd, and hopeless to succeed, Gave way, and strove to reach the camp with speed: Meanwhile, the right with cooling fear inspir'd, Before their foes with quick dispatch retir'd: Firm as amidst the billows stands a rock, Fraser sustain'd the formidable shock! True to the trust his sov'reign had repos'd; And where the dreadful battle roughest clos'd, There was he active found, with heart elate, And front erect, oppos'd to threat'ning fate: Striving the brisk assailants to repel, Whilst show'rs of bullets thick around him fell: Hoping the flying troops to reinspire With his own sentiments, and martial fire; T' example blind, to exhortations deaf, Alone they left the Caledonian chief! Stung to the quick, when they commenc'd the rout, Halt, halt, for shame! he cry'd, and face about! Where wou'd ye run to shun this glorious strife? With tarnish'd fame, so much in love with life? And when amidst the loud tumultuous roar, The distant troops cou'd hear his voice no more; Fix'd to the spot, and beck'ning was he seen, As if he had invulnerable been! Whilst hostile parties briskly onward sped, To seize the spot from whence the Britons fled: From rifled tubes, swift wing'd with sulph'rous flame, The messengers of death in vollies came: Where first the British troops possess'd the ground, He bravely fell, with lasting honour crown'd: The colonists exulting drove along: Towards the camp, Britons and Germans throng: They came in haste from ev'ry post around; All had deserted the disputed ground: To check the foes, who in pursuit drew near, Phillips and Reidesel brought up the rear; A show'r of shot and shells incessant sent; But this cou'd not their quick approach prevent; Th' artill'ry corps cou'd not their charge sustain, They fell, or fled, and left the batt'ring train; Which soon were turn'd with grape-shot amply stor'd, And 'gainst the British lines destruction roar'd: Around the spot a dismal sight appear'd; And dying groans, and hostile shouts were heard: Jones, Breymen, Clarke, and Fraser were no more; Lind, Harnage, Ackland, Williams, drench'd in gore; With many gallant chiefs, lay welt'ring round; Or limp'd disabled, o'er th' ensanguin'd ground. Gates, Arnold, Lincoln, with each other vy'd, And like a rapid overwhelming tide, Th' assailing continental force drew near, (Reg'lars, militia, and each volunteer;) To give the storm, no slow-pac'd march they made, But through a most tremendous cannonade, And show'rs of balls, from British muskets sent, On glorious death or hard-earn'd conquest bent, Towards the lines they resolutely sped, Where both the parties most profusely bled! To closest battle Arnold briskly flew, By Lincoln join'd, with glory's goal in view; But a retarding ball each leader met; They limp'd reluctant from the parapet: Gates and the main corps fighting still remain'd, Whose furious charge the Britons well sustain'd; Whilst over head hung vict'ry in suspense, As doubtful where to fix her residence! Phillips, Burgoyne, Belcarras, Reidesel, Most em'lous strove th' assailants to repel; The British chiefs by their examples fir'd, Determin'd fought, and ev'ry corps inspir'd; In ev'ry part Burgoyne all danger brav'd; No hope remain'd unless the camp was sav'd: Belcarras firm sustain'd the grand attack; At length the charging enemies fell back; Not till success in part th' attempt had crown'd, They gain'd This battle was fought on the 7th of Oct. 1777. In an account of which, General Burgoyne mentions what is above recited. He says, âWe lost 6 pieces of cannon; Brigadier-general Fraser, Lieutenant-colonel Breymen, and the German entrenchments; Major Ackland, wounded and taken; with many other gallant officers. The British troops retreated hard press'd, but in good order; and were scarcely entered the camp, when it was stormed with great fury; the enemy, led on by General Arnold, rushing to the lines, under a severe fire of grape shot, and small arms.â the lines, and kept the German ground; By which mishap the British right, and rear, Became expos'd, and gave new cause for fear; A restless night they had, the troops must make A movement, and a new position take: New fears, new dangers now, their minds opprest, And Saratoga seem'd a place of rest; Distressful thought to ev'ry gen'rous mind; The sick and wounded must be left behind! They cou'd not hope they shou'd successful prove, Unless they cou'd thus disencumber'd move: It was decreed, by night away they sped, And Reidesel the British vanguard led; Whilst in the rear the gallant Phillips mov'd; His thund'ring train a guard of safety prov'd: Delay'd, fatigu'd, they Saratoga gain'd; But yet so many obstacles remain'd; Their spirits flagg'd, foreboding total loss, Before they cou'd o'er Hudson's river cross: Their âne plus ultraâ this encampment prov'd; For where the workmen with detachments mov'd, There, a sufficient hostile force they found, To guard the fords, and to dispute the ground: A pensive gloom fill'd ev'ry soldier's face; Approaching enemies with eager pace, From distant parts came pouring in around, And took possession of th' adjacent ground, Where nature help'd to form the strongest bar, And bid defiance to the British war. Burgoyne had now the worst events to fear; Accumulating woes grew more severe: He had sufficient cause to dread th' event; His troops might rouze 'midst sudden discontent! Horrid the thought! they possibly might grow Impatient, rude, and no commanders know! Almost incircled by surrounding foes; Whose skill appear'd in ev'ry post they chose: From whence their cannon, with destruction stor'd, And slaught'ring rifle tubes alternate roar'd: With sage precaution Gates each moment seiz'd; And the provincial forces grimly pleas'd; Rage in their eyes, and vengeance in their hearts; Were stationed near the camp in various parts; Like bears bereav'd of whelps, around they lay, Expecting soon to see the welcome day, When the devoted General Burgoyne's report of the killed, wounded, and prisoners, of the British troops, to the 12th of Oct. 1777. Killed, 1 brigadier-general, 1 major, 2 captains, 15 lieutenants, 4 ensigns, 12 serjeants, 5 drummers, 315 rank and file. Wounded, 2 lieutenant-colonels, 5 majors, 17 captains, 18 lieutenants, 4 ensigns, 1 adjutant, 38 serjeants, 4 drummers, 715 rank and file.

They stood upon the margin of the grave, Which seem'd to yawn for the surviving brave! Convention only can prolong their breath, And save them from th' expanded jaws of death: Burgoyne apply'd, and Gates, inclin'd to peace, Humanely caus'd hostilities to cease: But first declares he will their passage bar, Till they surrender prisoners of war: Th' entrenchments, and the camp must be resign'd, Their grounded arms, and cannon, left behind! We ground our arms in camp, inflam'd with rage, The Britons cry'd; we rather will engage Our num'rous foes; tell Gates, whilst we have breath, We'll fight our way, and rush on certain death! Rather than sink so low, we scorn to live! No mercy will we crave, nor quarter give! Gates heard the same, his rising rage repress'd; The brave, the prudent warrior stood confess'd: He said (whilst he benevolently smil'd,) Let them march forth, and let their arms be pil'd: Let them revisit England, and declare, Crown'd with success, we condescend to spare: Altho' unfortunate, I know them brave, They all the honours of the war shall have: All shall their private property possess, As some alleviation of distress: Arms, ammunition, stores of ev'ry kind, They must give up, all shall be left behind; During the present war shall not be found In arms again, on continental ground; On these conditions, they shall feel no more The rifle balls, nor hear our cannons roar: He wish'd no needless carnage in the field, His point was gain'd, Britons inclin'd to yield; He might repent, when the rough battle clos'd, That he rejected what had been propos'd. Silent as death, some time was ev'ry tongue; Each to the quick, with rage and grief was stung; When, with great perturbation in his mind, Th' embarrass'd Gen'ral the convention sigh'd: The winged moments swiftly pass'd away; And Gates no longer suffer'd slow delay: Sullen, and silently they march'd along; Full of emotions, visible and strong: By hard necessity compell'd to yield; They must resign the honours of the field! Before they pass that formidable bar, Must give up all the glorious pomp of war! As slowly they advanc'd, each British chief Suffer'd the most excruciating grief: The destin'd spot once gain'd, they made a stand, And with reluctance utter'd the command, To Oct. the 17th 1777. Surrendered to General Gates; British: 2,442; Brunswick, and other German troops, 2,198: Canadian volunteers, &amp;c. 1, 190: staff-officers, 12: sick and wounded, left in the British camp, when General Burgoyne began his retreat, 528; besides the above, there were killed, wounded, taken, and deserted, of British, German, and Canadian troops, from the 6th of July to the 16th of Oct. 1777. 2,933: total 9,303. Brass ordnance, &amp;c. delivered up at Saratoga: 2 twenty-four pounders, 4 twelve pounders, 18 six pounders, 4 three pounders, 5 royal howitzers, 5 inches and a half; 2 brass mortars, 8 inches; with 7000 stand of arms complete, besides those taken at Bennington; the military chest; large quantities of ordnance-stores, cloathing for 7000 provincials, tents, &amp;c.

The scene of deep humiliating woe, Now drew compassion from a conqu'ring foe: The most emphatic words cannot express, The poignancy of ev'ry chief's distress. More happy Fraser, he repose had found, With many leaders brave, in war renown'd; With fame unsully'd had reclin'd his head, And slept secure in honour's sanguin'd bed. The British troops, as Gates before agreed, Were march'd to Boston with convenient speed; But great By what follows, it appears the charge was mutual. The Congress, on the 8th of Jan. 1779, came to resolutions to this purport: âThat General Burgoyne had infringed the articles of the convention at Saratoga; and that his charge of their breach of public faith, is considered by the Congress in an alarming point of view; and that they cannot confide in his honour, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.â And notwithstanding General Burgoyne offered to join with all his officers to sign an agreement, as a further pledge of faith, provided the suspension was immediately taken off; they resolved, âThat the embarkation of Lieutenant-general Burgoyne, and the army under his command, be suspended till a distinct and explicit ratification of the convention of Saratoga shall be properly notified by the court of Great Britain to Congress.â Signed Ch. Thompson, Sec. Where the troops now are, or how disposed of, I know not. misunderstandings soon arose, Between the British and provincial foes. Summer advanc'd, and all around from far, Provincial forces march'd, prepar'd for war; The Congress thought ere the campaign shou'd end, They must for Philadelphia contend: The Britons seem'd prepar'd by land to go; But Washington, a cautious skillful foe, Resolv'd t' attempt to change their destin'd course; Collecting quickly the provincial force, Near Quibble Town a strong encampment form'd, Seeming to rest secure from being storm'd; Thinking they cou'd not be dislodg'd from thence For art and nature join'd in their defence. As Britain's troops advanc'd o'er hostile ground, This obstacle across their way they found They halted, and at proper distance stood, And gloomily the lines and trenches view'd: Howe cautiously avoided an attack, And rather chose to march his army back; So tenable he thought the lofty spot, And had not Bunker's dreadful Hill forgot Soon as they mov'd the colonists drew near; Cornwallis backward led the harrass'd rear; A vigorous attack on all sides made, And drove them from their shady ambuscade; Still Stirling, Maxwell, Conway, onward came, And led three thousand candidates for fame; Eight thund'ring cannons their approach declar'd; Cornwallis, Grant, and Matthew were prepar'd To meet their foes; Donop, and Leslie too, Boldly advanc'd, and near their station drew; Each corps was emulous, with fierce delight, Impetuously rushing to the fight, They penetrated the surrounding wood, And face to face, in close engagement stood; The colonists could not sustain the shock, On all sides round gave way, dispers'd, and broke, Matthew and Mingerode still onward push'd, And where the cannon roar'd, intrepid rush'd; And as a proof how well they fought that day, They seiz'd and brought three Gen. Howe wrote, âThat when the British army marched back from Quibble Town, on the 19th of June 1777, and were attacked in the rear by the provincials, the British lost 5 men killed; Capt. Finch died of his wounds, and 30 wounded. The provincials lost 3 brass field-pieces; 3 captains, and 60 men killed; and upwards of 200 officers and men wounded and taken. The British troops engaged in this action were the 1st light infantry; 1st British grenadiers; 1st, 2d, and 3d Hessian grenadiers; 1st battalion of guards; Hessian chaffeurs, and the queen's regiment. One piece of cannon was taken by the guards, and the other two by Col. Mingerode's battalion of Hessian grenadiers.â batt'ring guns away! As Howe declin'd to hazard an attack, And had through Jersey march'd the Britons back; For a sea-passage they must next prepare; Embark'd, they sail'd, Gen. Sir Henry Clinton was left commander in chief at New York, and Brigadier-general Campbell, in a letter to him, dated head-quarters, Staten Island, 23d Aug. 1779, mentions a descent made on the island, the 22d Aug. by a large body of select troops, chosen from Brigadier-general Sullivan's, Small-wood's, and De Bore's brigades, and headed by 3 generals, with Drayton's and Ogden's battalions: they effected almost a total surprize of two battalions of the Jersey provincials, &amp;c. but that he repulsed, and drove them off the island, by the assistance, bravery, and resolution of Brigadier-general Skinner, Colonels Dongan and Buskirk, Lieutenant-colonels Campbell and Allan, Brigade-major Campbell, &amp;c. with their respective corps. They took many of their boats, and 259 prisoners; among whom were 1 lieutenant-colonel, 3 majors, 2 captains, 13 subalterns; killed and wounded a considerable number. But perhaps the loss on the British side, though not specified, was as great, as they surprized the two Jersey battalions. and reach'd the Delaware; And from th' Elk's Head by land to Chad's Ford sped; Cornwallis, and Knyphausen, forward led The two divisions; soon their march was barr'd; A thousand chosen men strove to retard Cornwallis, as he march'd, and in a wood, Most This was on the 3d of Sept. 1777. The British lost 3 men killed; 2 officers, and 19 wounded. The enemy had about 100 killed and wounded. advantageously they posted stood; The British vanguard some resistance found, But soon they drove them to more distant ground: Each movement shew'd a visible design, The Britons chose to pass the Brandywine: The cautious Washington the time improv'd, Halted with them, and march'd whene'er they mov'd; And was intrench'd, and strongly station'd found Near ev'ry ford, on advantageous ground, With a large train, to form a thund'ring bar, And fifteen thousand men prepar'd for war. One column to the right Cornwallis led; Another with Knyphausen forward sped; For Chad's Ford they design'd, and bought with blood The ground o'er which they march'd to reach the flood; Here, Maxwell posted on a neighb'ring height, Oppos'd their passage, and prolong'd the fight: To gain that height, a British party strove, That party the provincials backward drove; Which reinforc'd, The provincials say, General Maxwell declared they had but 3 killed, and 9 wounded; but that the British had at least 300 killed and wounded, before they attempted to pass the ford; and 1 captain, and 30 men, when they first advanced to pass it, and were repulsed. again retrod the ground; But such a second warm reception found, Again they fled, postponing the design, Until Cornwallis pass'd the Brandywine: Repuls'd, and vex'd, for close attack they burn'd; 'Gainst Maxwell's front, and flank, again they turn'd; Who overaw'd, across the passage mov'd, Where Washington his guard of safety prov'd: At distance now, both parties stood and made A long continu'd thund'ring cannonade: To cross the limpid stream, Cornwallis chose, Where Brandywine in double channels flows; And Washington inform'd of his intent, With Sullivan a grand detachment sent: Advanc'd before, on advantageous ground, Green's, Wayne's, and Stirling's corps, were posted found: Nearer and nearer still the parties drew; And now both hostile fronts appear'd in view: Station'd on Birmingham's commanding height, Ten thousand colonists stood rang'd for fight; To right and left rose a thick shady wood, Which near each flank, as friendly cov'rings stood; Their cannon advantageously dispos'd, Which roar'd rough greeting ere the battle clos'd: Cornwallis form'd the line with care and skill, Rapid and steady led them up the hill; The Britons saw their foes, and to the fight, Advancing briskly with a fierce delight, Amidst a roaring storm they upward mov'd, Which both offensive and defensive prov'd: Grey, Matthew, Agnew, to the battle flew, And all around enliv'ning glances threw; Each chief shook off th' appearance of delay, And strove to share the honour of the day; The chasseurs and light infantry inspir'd, Began th' attack, with emulation fir'd: The colonists display'd their warlike skill, To check their progress up the dang'rous hill, A blended show'r of lead and iron sent, Their dreaded quick advances to prevent: Tho' from their musquetry and cannon fell A mortal storm, the Britons to repel, (Which havoc made, yet undecisive prov'd;) Towards their lines the main corps briskly mov'd: The guards and grenadiers now onward push'd, And foremost to a close engagement rush'd; With ireful eyes, and a soul-harrowing frown, They charg'd compact, and bore resistance down; Amidst th' impetuous shock their foes gave way, They chac'd them to the woods in sad dismay; In close pursuit increas'd their speed and fear, Oft harrass'd and alarm'd their broken rear! Meanwhile at Chad's Ford neither party gain'd A great advantage, tho' both sides maintain'd A cannonade; for each with caution view'd Their adverse foes, and at due distance stood. Maxwell still near the ford well station'd lay, And held the British forces at a bay; But when a distant thund'ring cannonade, Proclaim'd Cornwallis had a passage made; The British troops in motion soon appear'd, And loud-repeated chearful shouts were heard; Grant led them on, each caught his warlike flame, And like their leader thirsted after fame; And as through hissing show'rs of balls they past, Towards their foes their threat'ning glances cast; Whose cannon, musquetry, and mortars roar'd From trenches, and redoubts, to guard the ford: Maxwell, and Mayne, were rouz'd, and labour'd hard The passage of the Britons to retard; Who made their deeds their firm resolves proclaim, Whilst wading thro' the intervening stream; Onward they press'd to make their passage good, And rang'd once more on âterra firmaâ stood; For their slain comrades full of great regret, Vex'd by repulse, and long delay they met, Impatient of restraint, to closest fight They quick advanc'd, and put their foes to flight; Still upwards drove, surmounting ev'ry bar, And seiz'd the brazen thunder of the war. To glory's goal advanc'd before the rest, Two British reg'ments emulously prest; Foremost the fourth stepp'd forth, and forc'd their way, Where the chief strength of their opponents lay; As close as possible, the fifth appear'd; And now the pass of all obstructions clear'd; Knyphausen, with the main corps, pass'd the brook, And on the ground they gain'd, their stations took. Meanwhile, Cornwallis on to conquest led; As he advanc'd, all opposition fled; Stirling's and Sullivan's, hard press'd, retir'd, Nor were they with fresh courage reinspir'd, Till Wayne's division check'd their wild career, And partly banish'd their desponding fear; But when the gallant Green appear'd in view, To flight and fear again they bid adieu; For battle rang'd, thus pow'rfully sustain'd, They stood, expecting honour might be gain'd A quick advance the British forces made, 'Gainst Proctor's brisk effectual cannonade; Cornwallis, Agnew, Matthew, Grey, appear'd Serenely brave, and each beholder chear'd; Firm stood the colonists, seem'd undismay'd; Wayne, Green, and Fayette, warlike worth display'd; Woodford and Spotswood much distinguish'd shone, (For their humanity to Fordyce known) Wenden's and Stuart's corps great honour gain'd, A close and heavy fire long time sustain'd: Some other chiefs, not natives of the land, By their examples strove to make them stand, T' annoy the Britons, when they gave the shock, And rally those that were dispers'd and broke: Thus officer'd, and by example taught, They kept their ground, and vigorously fought; But when th' impetuous close attack took place, And Britain's forces charg'd them face to face, They broke, confus'd, whilst Wenden, Woodford, Wayne, Green, Hartley, Spotswood, Stewart, call'd in vain, To halt, to rally, and to face about: As vainly to prevent a gen'ral rout, Polaski, Plessi, Fayette, Fleuri rode From corps to corps, still retrograde they trod! Altho' th' artillery the Britons gall'd, And Proctor, Allen, Cooper, loudly call'd Stand, stand, and make one glorious effort more; Rally, and join our yet effective roar! Of succour now on all sides quite bereft, They, with reluctance, next th' artill'ry left; A general retreat took place around, From Chad's Ford, quite to This battle was fought on the heights of the River Brandywine, on the 11th of Sept. 1777: in which, and in skirmishes, according to General Howe's account, there were of the British, killed, 3 captains, 5 lieutenants, 5 serjeants, 68 rank and file. Wounded, 1 lieutenant-colonel, 1 major, 25 captains, 21 lieutenants, 5 ensigns, 35 serjeants, 4 drummers, 372 rank and file, 6 missing. The Germans lost 2 serjeants, 6 rank and file, killed; and 1 captain, 3 lieutenants, 5 serjeants, 26 rank and file, wounded. The Provincials lost about 317 men killed; 600 wounded; and near 400 made prisoners. Ordnance, mounted on travelling-carriages; 3 brass six-pounders, 4 French four-pounders, 2 three-pounders, 1 five and half inch howitzer, 1 iron four-pounder; total 11.

The Provincials say, their loss does not exceed 1000 killed and wounded; and they call it another Bunker's Hill affair: but with how much propriety, I must leave my readers to judge. Brandywine's high ground. Where Wayne with fifteen hundred distant lay, Three reg'ments On the 20th of Sept. 1777, at night, Major-general Grey was detached with the 2d light infantry, the 42d and 44th regiments, to suprize General Wayne's corps, of about 1500, in the woods; which was effected with great slaughter. General Howe writes, âThe provincials had killed and wounded, not less than 300 between 70 and 80 taken prisoners, including several officers; the greatest part of their arms, and 8 waggons, loaded with baggage and stores. The British lost 1 captain and 3 men killed, and 4 wounded.â thither march'd, led on by Grey; And under covert of nocturnal shade, Like prowling wolves their near approaches made; Rapid, and sudden, to the charge they flew, Surprize and consternation gen'ral grew: Great slaughter 'midst a total rout ensu'd, The dead and wounded wide around were strew'd. As Howe advanc'd he small resistance found; For Washington wou'd not dispute the ground: He seem'd to fear a total overthrow, And Philadelphia lost without a blow! The Delaware, This was the Delaware, a 36 gun frigate, with gallies, &amp;c. mann'd by provincial foes, Drew near the town, to rouse them from repose; Her long continu'd fire advantage gain'd, By gallies and gondolas well sustain'd; Whilst they their cannon resolutely ply'd, They heeded not th' incessant ebbing tide, Until the ground receiv'd the vessel's keel; As soon as Cleveland saw the frigate heel, He brought the four battalion guns to bear, And pour'd destruction on the Delaware: Soon overpow'r'd, the frigate silent lay, To shun her fate the gallies mov'd away. The Britons were detach'd in parties round, And occupy'd a great extent of ground; And Washington employ'd each precious hour, To reunite his lately scatter'd pow'r; Justly concluding his extended foes, Might meet perhaps repeated overthrows Like those in Jersey, when they felt dismay! And Rall, at Trenton, fell an easy prey! From various parts, throughout the continent, Large reinforcements to the camp were sent; To battle, for revenge, all seem'd t' incline, For friends, and honour lost, near Brandywine; For slaughter unreveng'd, they hourly grieve, And long their late-lost honour to retrieve; Their fears forgot, the chief, with great delight, Observ'd returning ardor for the fight; From Skippach Creek, with his collected force, To German Town, he straightway bent his course; So great their numbers, such the speed they made With secret march, thro' the nocturnal shade, 'Twas more than probable they should obtain Revenge for honour lost, and comrades slain: With early dawn, the colonists appear'd, The vanguard soon their hostile greeting heard; Quickly alarm'd, all rouz'd from sweet repose, And under arms advanc'd to meet their foes; Briskly they mov'd, firm, and compact, to form, Amidst the fury of th' impending storm. Knyphausen, Agnew, Matthew, Grant, and Grey, Knowing the consequences of delay, Donop and Stirn, with many a gallant chief, To battle ran, to give their friends relief; For Sullivan had some advantage gain'd, By Conway, Wayne, and Washington sustain'd: Before their growing pow'r, and brisk attack, The vanguard and light infantry fell back; Tho' the tenth reg'ment gallantry display'd, 'Midst the first shock, and gave them friendly aid; As fresh provincial troops came pouring round, In haste they quitted the disputed ground. The gallant Musgrave, full of martial fire, Reluctant mov'd, and scorning to retire, Resolv'd he wou'd in Chew's Colonel Musgrave had with him six companies of the 40th regiment. strong house abide, And posted there, his enemies defy'd: The door secur'd, with furniture he made In the grand entrance a strong barricade; With frowning front, and a determin'd look, In various parts each man his station took; And as th' assailing forces nearer drew, On ev'ry side, each window open threw; On all sides storm'd by a detach'd brigade; Who many bold and brisk advances made; They, undismay'd, their stony station held, And ev'ry hostile near approach repel'd: Although to strike the British troops with fear, Th' assailants brought four batt'ring cannons near; The shatter'd facile doors asunder flew; They gave a shout, and more determin'd grew: Aloud th' undaunted Musgrave rais'd his voice; Let glorious death, or vict'ry, be your choice; Tho', far out-number'd, we appear but few, Convince your foes what British troops can do: This strong-built house we may long time defend, And can from hence destructive vollies send; Our worthy friends, station'd all round this place, Will not be tardy in bright glory's race; We soon shall see th' assailants put to rout, And hear the friendly loud exulting shout: Should all this fail, each man, at honour's call, Among an heap of slaughter'd foes will fall: Triumphing thus, who'd not resign his breath! And almost smile amidst the pangs of death! Now the provincials briskly forward prest, And put their manhood to severest test; Both parties equally resolv'd appear'd, At intervals, respondent shouts were heard, To chear th' advancing corps 'midst rough attack, And rouze th' assail'd, to drive th' assailants back; The doors and furniture were swept away, Therefore the batt'ring cannon ceas'd to play; Thronging provincials briskly forward push'd; Towards the door intrepidly they rush'd: To right and left the Britons met the war, And with their bay'nets form'd a steely bar; To pass, th' assailants resolutely strove; Whilst those behind, the foremost on ward drove: The flanking bay'nets gave a mortal wound, In heaps they fell, and form'd a frindly mound! Thus, hostile bodies prov'd a strong safeguard, And the grand entrance 'gainst th' assailants barr'd! Laborious was the fight for those below; No respite cou'd the door's defendants know; Altho' their comrades, from each window sent A show'r of balls, approaches to prevent; The spacious court was with provincials spread, And on the slipp'ry steps lay heaps of dead! Over their wounded friends, and comrades slain, Each man advanc'd who strove the door to gain! If they continu'd thus the house t' assail, Numbers, and cannons, must at length prevail; But Musgrave, and his vet'ran troops, held out, Until a welcome loud approaching shout From each adjacent friendly corps was heard, And Britain's quick advancing flags appear'd; Agnew, and Grey, in fierce encounter clos'd, And first th' advancing colonists oppos'd; Matthew, and Grant, advanc'd upon the right, And the fifth reg'ment, hast'ning to the fight, Was by the fifty-fifth so well sustain'd, They check'd their foes, and great advantage gain'd; Two The 27th and 28th, with the guards, stood opposed to two columns of the enemy. reg'ments, with the guards, stood undismay'd, Bore the grand shock, and warlike worth display'd. Now, from th' invested house, those sons of worth, Headed by Musgrave, briskly sally'd forth; As when a torrent bursts the obstructing mound, And spreads a deluge o'er th' adjacent ground; Thro' the grand portal, over heaps of dead, They frowning rush'd, and wide destruction spread; From right to left, both parties fiercely fought, And their main strength up to the battle brought. How soon are sanguine expectations crost And blooming hopes of glorious conquest lost! For in the moment vict'ry seem'd t'incline To grant revenge for loss at Brandywine; Round Washington unfriendly vapours flew, And hid the scene of action from his view! Which fog envelop'd the disputed spot, On which th' encount'ring parties fiercest fought! This prov'd a gloomy cause of doubt, and grief, The late exulting Transatlantic Chief, (Who, had with greatest caution travers'd round, Expecting soon with vict'ry to be crown'd;) Saw not the Britons meditating flight! The scene was vanish'd from his ravish'd sight! For Britain's right wing pressing closer, chose To charge the left of their assailing foes; A random fight, perplexity, and doubt, Took place, and put the colonists to rout; Not long the right wing, and the center stood, Disorder, and confusion soon ensu'd; Whilst the provincial leaders strove in vain, To make them rally, and their ground maintain; Thro' diff'rent roads, the routed parties seek Safety, and rest, at Perkiomy This battle was fought at German Town, in Pennsylvania, on the 4th of Oct. 1777. General Howe wrote, âThat the British forces lost; killed, Brigadier-gen. Agnew, 1 colonel, 1 capt. 1 ensign, 7 serjeants, and 60 privates. Wounded, 1 colonel, 8 captains, 12 lieutenants, 12 ensigns, 23 serjeants, 373 privates: 1 captain and 13 privates missing: 3 horses killed, and 4 wounded. The Hessians had 1 serjeant, 23 rank and file, wounded.â Of the Provincials, Gen. Howe writes, âBy the best accounts, their loss was between 2 and 300 killed, about 600 wounded, and upwards of 400 taken: among the killed, was General Nash, with many other officers of all ranks; and 54 officers among the prisoners:â (to which we may add, 10 officers in the Delaware frigate, and all her crew.)

Sir Henry Clinton, Major-gen. Vaughan, Brigadier-gen. Campbell, Col. Campbell, and Capt. Drummond. They landed at Elizabeth Town Point, Schuyler's Ferry, Fort Lee, and Japan. They returned with 400 head of cattle, and 400 sheep, with some horses. The British loss, 8 rank and file killed. One lieutenant, 17 rank and file wounded, 10 missing, 5 taken prisoners.

Sir H. Clinton, in a long and particular account to Gen. Sir W. Howe, writes as follows: âI chose to wait a favourable moment before I ordered the attack on the side of Fort Clinton; which was a circular height, defended by a line for musquetry, with a barbet battery in the center of 3 guns, and flanked by 2 redoubts. The approaches to it, through a continued abbatis of 400 yards, defensive every inch, and exposed to the fire of 10 pieces of cannon, &amp;c. The gallies approaching, firing, the men of war appearing, crouding sail to support us, the extreme ardor of the troops, in short, all determined me to order the attack; General Vaughan's spirited behaviour and good conduct did the rest. Having no time to lose, I particularly ordered that not a shot should be fired; in this I was strictly obeyed, and both the redoubts, &amp;c. were stormed. General Tryon advanced with one battalion to support General Vaughan, if necessary; and he arrived in time to join the cry of victory. Trumbach's regiment was posted at the wall to cover our retreat, in case of misfortune. N. B. The Forts Clinton and Montgomery are separated by a creek, and communicate with each other by a bridge.â abbatis he forc'd his way 'Gainst roaring cannon, and at glory's call, He gain'd, and kept possession of the wall; Where Clinton soon to succour him appear'd, The welcome junction ev'ry soldier chear'd. Now, under covert of a gloomy night, Surrounding troops prepar'd for closest fight; Meanwhile, both Robinson and Campbell lay Near Fort Montgom'ry, ready to display Their warlike worth, soon as the gallies made Their near approach, with thund'ring cannonade: 'Gainst Fort Montgomery their force was bent, From whence their foes a mortal greeting sent; Campbell soon felt a fatal random ball; But Robinson reveng'd the warrior's fall; Inspir'd his corps their duty to perform, And gain'd th' assaulted fortress in a storm. Clinton, and Vaughan, with emulation fir'd, To action rouz'd, and all as if inspir'd With martial ardor, through the gloomy shade, And the strong abbatis, advances made: Silent, and resolute, the ground they gain'd, And a destructive hostile fire sustain'd From musquetry, and cannon, all around, Whilst lab'ring o'er the well-disputed ground: No British vollies in return were heard; Their swords and bay'nets all obstruction clear'd. Vaughan executed gallant Clinton's plan, Skillful, and brave, the race of glory ran; Each British ready chief in concert mov'd, Cautious, and bold, and mutual succour prov'd; So gallantly each corps the fight maintain'd, Both forts were The British forces lost in this storm; killed, Lieutenant-col.

The provincials lost, according to Gen. Sir Wm. Howe's account, about 100 killed, 8 field-officers, 2 captains, 12 subalterns, and about 300 taken prisoners. Gen. Clinton's account of their loss, as follows: 67 cannon, from 32 to 2 pounders; two frigates built for 36 and 30 guns, burnt by themselves, and 2 gallies; and a sloop with 10 guns taken. The total loss about 100 cannon, 54 casks of powder, 11 half barrels; 12,236 l. exclusive of what was on board the vessels; 1,852 cannon cartridges, filed; 57,396 musquet ditto; 9,530 round cannon-shot, 886 double-headed, 2,486 grape and case; 36 cwt. 1 qr. 15 lb. of langridge; 379 lb. wt. of musquet balls, 116 lb. of buck shot, 5,400 flints. Every article belonging to a laboratory in the greatest perfection. Other stores, such as port fires, match, harness, spare gun carriages, tools, instruments, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. in great plenty. A large quantity of provisions. The boom and chain, which ran across the river from Fort Montgomery to St. Anthony's Nose, is supposed to be worth 70,000 l. Another boom, which was destroyed near Fort Constitution, cost much much money and labour. Barracks for 1,500 men, burst on the 9th of Oct. by Major-gen. Tryon, with several storehouses and loaded waggons, at Continental Village, Fort Constitution evacuated, and taken by Sir James Wallace and Gen. Tryon; the guns left unspiked, and storehouses burnt. Esopus likewise burnt, by Major-gen. Vaughan, on the 11th of October, and at the same time all the shipping, and all the stores on shore (except 1 galley) destroyed by Sir James Wallace. All this was performed from the 6th to the 17 of October 1777. The naval officers mentioned in the expedition by Com. Hotham, are Captains Sir James Wallace, Pownall, Ommonney, Jordan, and Stanhope; of whom, with the inferior officers and men under their commands, he writes honourably, and applauds the spirited behaviour of the troops, in their fatiguing march over precipices, and through roads almost impenetrable, without cannon, and but small assistance to be expected from the naval force, in such a dangerous and laborious enterprize. storm'd, and both at once were gain'd: This fail'd of proving a decisive blow; The spirit and resources of the foe Were now so great, that with a warlike pride, With arms, and ammunition, well supply'd They met Burgoyne, form'd an effectual bar, And check'd the progress of the British war.

One row remov'd, they small advantage gain'd; Nearer the forts, obstructing rows remain'd; Now, larger ships of war approaches made, T' assist the troops with naval cannonade; This joint attack the colonists sustain'd, Held both their forts, and some advantage gain'd: Whilst death in show'rs of lead and iron flew From side to side, and hot the battle grew; Forth from th' Augusta, suddenly there broke A pitchy cloud of suffocating smoke: The spreading flame resistless fury gain'd; From stem to stern, fear, and confusion reign'd; Whilst from the burning ship the seamen came, To shun their fates amidst devouring flame, Beyond their warmest expectations pleas'd, The colonists the dreadful moment seiz'd, Among the boats, incessantly to pour From each well-mann'd redoubt, a mortal show'r; Th' assisting num'rous boats in haste withdrew To distant safety, with th' affrighted crew; When 'midst the final blast, so justly fear'd, Th' Augusta, and the Merlin, disappear'd. The tumult ceas'd, and with redoubled rage, The British troops, and tars, began t' engage; Mud Island, and Red Bank, at once assail'd, In front, and rear, and o'er their foes prevail'd. The British troops with dear-bought Mud Island Fort was evacuated, and surrendered, on the 16th of Novem. 1777, as was Red Bank on the 19th; and the works at Billingport abandoned, and blown up; and on the 20th, 2 zebecques, 2 floating batteries, with several ships, and fire-vessels, 17 in number, were quitted and burnt, being opposed in their attempt to pass the town, by Lieut. Watt, made capt. of the Delaware frigate. Ordnance and stores found in Mud Island Fort, and Red Bank Fort; iron ordnance, on travelling carriages, 12 from 32 to 12 pounders; on garrison and truck carriages, 29 from 18 to 10 pounders; 12 howitzer swivels, 3 common swivels, 1 travelling carriage for 18 pounders, 5 truck carriages for ditto, 1 travelling carriage for 9 pounders, 4 ditto for 6 pounders: round loose shot, 6,626 from 24 to 3 pounders: bar, from 32 to 3 pounders, 326; from 32 to 4 pounders, 330; 6 boxes with ball, and some cask ditto: grape in bags, case, &amp;c. 77; 1 box, different sorts; 400 lb. wt. of small iron for case; 18 hand-granades; 9 boxes with ball-cartridges; 1 cask with musquet-balls; 65 8 pounder paper cartridges, fill'd; 93 pikes, 39 sponges, 9 ladles, 17 wad-hooks, 3 drag-ropes, 1 traversing handspike, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. The Provincials lost, according to Gen. Howe's account, about 400 killed and wounded. The British troops had 7 killed, and 5 wounded; the ships had 6 killed, and 19 wounded. The Augusta, a 64 gun ship, and the Merlin sloop of war, burnt in the attack, and blown up, and about 30 of the Augusta's crew perished. vict'ry crown'd, Resolv'd till spring arriv'd to keep the ground. BOOK VI. THE ARGUMENT. Various expeditions in the spring of 1778. Gen. Clinton proceeds by land, through Jersey, to New York; the troops fatigued, impeded, and harrassed on all sides, are at last attacked by large detachments on their flanks, and by Gen. Washington, with the main corps, in the rear; the battle near Freehold; the provincials driven back; and in the night the British army retires from the field of battle, to rejoin their baggage, and march to New York. Count D'Estaing, with a French fleet, anchors at Sandy Hook; proceeds to Rhode Island: Gen. Sullivan advances by land, to attack the garrison at Newport. D'Estaign quits the siege, and plying off at sea, expects Lord Viscount Howe; a storm separates the fleets, and D'Estaing bears away for Boston, to refit: the siege commenced by Gen. Sullivan, and a good defence made by Gen. Pigot, Cap. Brisbane, &amp;c. The provincials retire, are harrassed in their retreat, and quit the island. Several expeditions in the spring of 1779. The fort at Stoney Point attacked by Brigadier-general Wayne, and taken by storm. Col. Maclean's post attacked on the River Penobscot, makes a gallant defence; Commodore Sir George Collier arrives with some frigates, destroys the provincial naval armament, with the transports, &amp;c. D'Estaing arrives from the West Indies, off Tybee Bar; commences the siege of the fort and town of Savannah; is joined by Gen. Lincoln, and Count Polaski, with a large body of the continental forces; the vigilance and bravery of Capt. Moncrief, and other British officers, displayed, during the siege, and in the final storm. The intrepidity of the French and continental troops, and their commanders, in their joint attack: their resolution staggered, the rout commenced, and slaughter in the retreat: the provincials retire from Savannah, the French abandon the enterprize, and with secret expedition embark, and sail for Europe. To render the provincial threat'ning vain, At the first op'ning of the rough campaign; Pigot, and Griffith, jointly strove to mar Hostile designs, and stop th' approaching war: Seir, Mawhood, In March 1778, Col. Mawhood made a descent in Jersey, near Salem; and returned with a large supply of forage. On the 4th of May, Lieutenant-col. Abercromby, with 700, attacked 900 provincials; killed, wounded, and took 150: only 9 British wounded. About the same time, a small party of the British infantry, dragoons, and queen's rangers, with Howerden's Pennsylvania and Chester's dragoons, fell in with Lancy's brigade of 500; killed about 100, took 60, with 10 waggons loaded with baggage, &amp;c. and burnt 3 others, with the huts, and what baggage could not be brought off, with the loss of 7 men wounded, and 2 horses killed. On 17th of May, Major Maitland, with 2d battalion of light infantry, and 2 field-pieces, attended by a naval force, under the command of Capt. Henry, proceeded from Philadelphia up the Delaware; and at Borden Town, Biles Island Creek, &amp;c. they burnt 1 frigate for 32 guns, 1 for 28 guns, 9 large ships, 2 of them loaded with tobacco, rum, military stores, &amp;c. 3 privateer sloops, for 16 guns each, 3 ditto, for 10 guns each, and 23 brigs, with a number of sloops and schooners; Col. Borden's house and furniture; 4 stores, containing provisions of all species, a very large quantity of tobacco, sugar, military stores, &amp;c. spoiled 5 cannon, and brought off 1 field-piece, with but little loss of men on either side. As the Provincials in the spring were making great preparations of boats, &amp;c. which plainly indicated a design to make a descent on Rhode Island; Gen. Pigot, with Capt. Griffith, the naval commander, resolved in season to attempt to frustrate their design; and on the 25th of May 1778, Col. Campbell, Lieutenant col. Hillman, with Captains Noltenius, Coore, Trench, Seir, &amp;c. with 500 men, proceeded up Warren's River, covered by the Flora, Capt. Brisbane; the flat boats were under the direction of Captains Clayton, and Reeves, Lieutenants Knowles, Stanhope, D'Auvergne, Christie; and Lieut. Kempshorn, who, with some boats, took the Spitfire galley that morning. And at Papasquash Point, at Warren, Hickamuct River, Bristol, Fogland Ferry, &amp;c. they burnt and destroyed, 125 boats, some of them 50 feet long; 1 galley of 6 twelve-pounders, 2 sloops, 1 loaded with stores, a new privateer-sloop, mounting 16 four-pounders, a saw-mill, with a large quantity of planks, pitch, tar, &amp;c. a store, and a house with ammunition, rum, rice, sugar, warlike stores, &amp;c. a town house, 2 churches, and several dwelling-houses; a bridge; and at Fogland Ferry, a guard-house: they likewise destroyed a battery; and at different places, 2 twenty-four-pounders, 5 eighteen-pounders, 2 nine pounders, all on travelling carriages complete; with 4 eighteen-pounders, 6 twelve-pounders, 3 three-pounders, and 2 field pieces; and took prisoners, 1 colonel, 3 field-officers, 2 captains, 2 lieutenants, 58 privates; and returned to Newport, with a lieutenant, and 12 privates wounded, and 2 drummers missing. Maitland, Abercromby, rose, With Campbell, Hillman, Brisbane, 'gainst their foes; Noltenus, Clayton, Kempshorn, Trench, and Coore, Reeve, Henry, Stanhope, Christian, vengeance bore To various parts, with many chiefs beside, By land and sea approv'd, in action try'd. Tho' Red Bank, and Mud Island, were subdu'd, Which had long time in opposition stood, And the provincial troops on all sides round, Had been repell'd, and driv'n to distant ground; Not long the British forces held the same, An order for evacuation came: And gallant Clinton, chief in the command, Prepar'd to make a dang'rous march by land. New York the royal mandate pointed out; Through Jersey lay the gen'ral's destin'd route; Precaution, skill, and courage, were requir'd, To march by land, and gain the end desir'd: The welfare of his army was at stake; Before he can a single movement make, Provisions must be got, and waggons found, To bear the baggage over hostile ground; Twelve miles they cover'd! and whene'er they mov'd, A constant cause for close attention prov'd; This must the British army's march retard; Demanding thousands for sufficient guard; And must of course their thin weak flanks expose To frequent insults from their watchful foes! Divided thus, and drawn to such a length, Cou'd not exert their whole compacted strength: This train of carriages was forward sent, And with the vanguard, bold Knyphausen went: With him, Cornwallis in conjunction mov'd, And good support in time of danger prov'd: Clinton with British troops brought up the rear; To face, and fight, shou'd Washington appear: 'Twas almost certain, such a cautious foe, Wou'd never let them unmolested go Their destin'd march, encumber'd, and their strength Drawn out to such an unaccustom'd length: Onward they mov'd, their foes as if they slept, Had not yet dar'd their march to intercept; Tho' seemingly at rest, they were employ'd; The Britons found the bridges were destroy'd; Which caus'd them disagreeable delays, 'Midst labour, thirst, and dust, of sultry days; The colonists employ'd that time to form, And gather round them like a threat'ning storm: With wonted caution, Washington had sent Maxwell before, with visible intent, To join the rouz'd militia, gath'ring round, And strive to prove they trod forbidden ground: On the same errand, Morgan forward sped; Six hundred bold selected men he led, (Exceeding fit in ambuscade to lie; All well-accustom'd with discerning eye, To raise the rifled tube, and send the ball Against an individual doom'd to fall;) Whilst Washington, with his collected force, Most circumspectly follow'd Clinton's course; Resolv'd a gen'ral action to decline, (So visibly the British chief's design;) Halting at Hopewell, distant from his foes, To give his troops refreshment, and repose, And with mature deliberation scan, What might be done in his intended plan. T' assist and join the force, advanc'd before, He thence detach'd near fifteen hundred more; All chosen troops, and led by gallant Scott: With eager speed, towards the destin'd spot, A thousand more selected men were sent, A failure, and misfortune to prevent; Fayette, and Wayne, he chief commanders chose, To lead this corps, to vex the British foes; Each officer detach'd on that command, Resign'd the reins into the Frenchman's hand: But Washington had some foreboding doubt, That Clinton wou'd those chosen forces rout; Reflecting cooly, thought might better be, Shou'd they be led to fight by British Lee; And fearing they'd not stand the dreadful test, With two This account of the detachments sent forward, corresponds exactly with Gen. Washington's report; who uses the words âselect corps of 600 men, 1500 chosen troops, select men. Major-general Lee detached with 2 brigades; and mentions likewise 7 or 800 Jersey militia, under Gen. Dickenson, who, with Col. Morgan's corps, hovered on the British flanks, joined by Gen. Maxwell's detachment,â &amp;c. brigades the gen'ral forward prest: These were respectable, but had to go Against no puny despicable foe; But such as wou'd with fierce resentment burn; Like lions chaf'd would on their hunters turn: This Lee well knew, and tho' he brought this aid, The British troops to harrass and impede, The various corps at awful distance lay, Hov'ring around, like rav'nous birds of prey. Slow, in the rear, march'd Washington along; His main corps rumour'd full twelve thousand strong, With him advanced a well-mann'd thund'ring train, They might the fiercest hostile shock sustain. Meanwhile the Britons slowly mov'd, and found Frequent obstructions, from a marshy ground; Some slight impediments th' insurgents prov'd, But vig'rously attack'd, were soon remov'd. Near to New York the British army drew, And Washington now most impatient grew Of such delay, and order'd Lee more near, T' attack, and harrass, both their flanks, and rear. Clinton had been repeatedly alarm'd, Danger was nigh, and with precaution arm'd, He rang'd each corps, and station'd them, where best They might exert themselves, and stand the test. The baggage mov'd under Knyphausen's This division consisted of the 17th light dragoons, 2d battalion light infantry, Hessian yagers, 1st and 2d brigades, British; Stern's and Loo's brigades of Hessians; Pennsylvania and Maryland loyalists; and West Jersey volunteers. care; Grant, and Cornwallis, station'd very near, Mov'd as they mov'd, a good sufficient guard, From that weak part th' expected blow to ward: Far in the rear the British chief remain'd, And with him several well try'd Gen. Clinton's division consisted of the 16th, light dragoons; 1st and 2d battalions of British grenadiers; 1st battalion light infantry, guards; Hessian grenadiers; 3d, 4th, and 5th brigades, British. corps retain'd; And in his rear, roll'd on the batt'ring train, To scour the woods, or sweep th' embattled plain; Or in a fulminating storm, t' oppose With the like thunder, near advancing foes. The messengers, and scouts arriv'd, and gave Intelligence, alarming to the brave! That Gates from distant parts was marching on, T' oppose the passage of the Rariton; And Washington, and Lee, were near at hand, With twenty thousand forces at command; That large militia corps were likewise sent From various parts, their passage to prevent. They had a dang'rous glorious race to run Thro' dusty roads, and melting in the sun! Harrass'd by day, and ev'ry night in dread Of foes more num'rous, all around them spread! Morgan, and Dickenson, around them mov'd, And as they march'd, vexatious neighbours prov'd: Lee, Maxwell, Scott, and Wayne, with thousands more, To seize the baggage, were advanc'd before; If they cou'd rout that long-extended guard, At least t' alarm, to harrass, and retard; On either flank were cautiously dispos'd; The signal giv'n, they with the vanguard clos'd; Grant, and From the attack made on the baggage, to the reinforcement ordered from the vanguard, corresponds with Gen. Clinton's account of the action. Knyphausen, ready for th' attack, Turn'd on their foes, and drove th' assailants back; The fortieth reg'ment fac'd, and firmly stood; The light dragoons their scatt'ring foes pursu'd, Who disappear'd with unexpected speed, And left them unmolested to proceed. Fayette, with hostile cavalry drew near To Clinton's flank, and threat'ning in the rear Descending Freehold's height, a thund'ring train Appear'd, whilst yet across the subject plain, The harrass'd Britons slow advances made, To expedite their march with cannonade; But Clinton scorning tamely to retire, Fac'd, and return'd the Transatlantic fire: As nearer with the flank young Fayette clos'd, The queen's dragoons his cavalry oppos'd; Who, stagger'd at the movement, wheel'd, and broke, Intimidated ere they felt the shock! Confus'd, upon their infantry fell back, Inclining them to shun the brisk attack! Now, like a gath'ring storm, the British rear, Drew more compact, and fill'd their foes with fear; By Clinton led, they quick retrod the plain, The colonists endeavour'd to regain Th' adjacent height, down which, not long before, They march'd exulting, with loud threat'ning roar! Clinton uncertain of the day's event, For reinforcements from the vanguard sent; And Washington expecting an attack, Call'd th' harrassing advancing parties back; The Transatlantic cannon turn'd, and made Destructive roar, as they drove Vide Major-general Lee's two letters to Mr. Burden, bookseller, Winchester; in which he says, âTo call the affair a complete victory would be a dishonourable gasconade: it was indeed a very handsome check, and did the Americans honour;â and he likewise calls it âa retrograde manÅuvre of near 4 miles,â &amp;c. retrograde; Each party quick retrod the ground they'd gain'd, To reach the spot where Washington remain'd; At intervals some British troops drew near, Charg'd in the front, or threaten'd in the rear; Now they advanc'd, and fought, again retir'd, Nor were with resolution reinspir'd, Until the friendly main corps rose in view, With whom they mix'd, and more determin'd grew. Now Washington ingenuously confess'd, He found his chosen thousands closely press'd! By Lee they said, commanded to retire, Before they had return'd the British fire! Surpriz'd! and General Washington's own expressions, and account of this part of the action. mortify'd! the Gen'ral stood; With indignation their confusion view'd! He join'd the rear amidst the thickest rout; His presence made them halt, and face about; A sympathetic resolution wrought Among the chiefs, whilst Know, and Oswald brought Their well-serv'd loud artillery to bear, And check'd the Britons in their brisk career: Whilst clouds of smoke, and dust, obscur'd the day, The sun with his meridian sultry ray, Added fatigue, and thirst, unknown to those, Who never met with rough encount'ring foes. The scatter'd colonists now gather'd round, And took possession of a rising ground; Behind a deep morass they posted stood; Their rear defended by a shady wood; To guard the flank, Green on the right appear'd, And Stirling on the left his banners rear'd; And now a gen'ral cannonade ensu'd, Whilst yet both parties at a distance stood; But Clinton was on closer battle bent, Thinking the time to little purpose spent; Monckton, Trelawney, Matthew, led the way, With Leslie, Erskine, Patterson, and Grey. The grenadiers, and guards, first gave the shock, And foremost, through strong opposition broke; Where duty call'd, and thickest foes were found, Intrepid Monckton trod the dang'rous ground; And had his race of martial glory run, Before the setting of the scorching sun. The continental front soon This part of the action corresponds with Gen. Clinton's account; who writes, 45 British, and 11 German, died with fatigue, and heat; and Gen. Washington gives an account, that several of his men died with heat, and fatigue. disappear'd; The second line much firmer persever'd: Britain's main corps to closest action flew, With active zeal, and obstinacy too, The colonists receiv'd them as they clos'd, And ev'ry effort, vig'rously oppos'd; From man to man the warlike ardor caught, For honour, and America they fought; Begrim'd with sprinkled blood, and dust, and sweat, In clouds of smoke, encount'ring parties met: Thus, amidst flaming gloom, both sides engag'd: As if Vesuvius 'gainst Mount Etna rag'd: And now the solar heat grew most intense, Which prov'd of dreadful fatal consequence! As they advance, and chace, wheel, and retire, Their constitutions seem'd as if on fire! They fought in clouds of dust, with sulph'rous smoke, Which from their engines of destruction broke! Frail nature sunk beneath th' oppressive weight Of parching thirst, and dusty scorching heat! Brave men on both sides fell, gasping for breath, Without a wound, a prey to greedy death! The Britons closer press'd, and by the shock, The continental second line was broke; Backward they mov'd, a strong position gain'd; By prudence, heat, and great fatigue restrain'd, No further progress Britain's forces made; But skirmishing, and 'midst a cannonade, They strove the continental flanks to gain, And were repuls'd by Stirling, Green, and Wayne. The Britons now retir'd, and rang'd remain'd Upon the ground, they first in battle gain'd; Their flanks, and front, no sudden onset fear'd, So formidably posted they appear'd: Both parties at convenient distance stood, And for a while each other grimly view'd; And were surrounded by the shades of night, Before they recommenc'd the dusty fight: To join their Gen. Sir H. Clinton, in his letter, in the London Gazette Extraordinary, 24th of Aug. 1778, writes, âThat, pursuant to his Majesty's instructions, he evacuated Philadelphia on the 18th of June 1778, at 3 o'clock in the morning,â &amp;c. After a most laborious march, amidst excessive heat, and dust, repairing bridges, and frequent skirmishes with harrassing parties, this battle was fought near Monmouth, Freehold, and places adjacent, when the heat was intense, and almost insufferable; in which the British and Germans lost; total killed, 1 lieutenant-col. 1 captain, 2 lieutenants, 4 serjeants, 56 rank and file; 3 serjeants, 56 rank and file, died with fatigue. Wounded, 1 col. 1 lieutenant-col. 1 major, 7 captains, 5 lieutenants, 7 serjeants, 148 rank and file; 3 serjeants, 61 rank and file missing. The German loss was, 1 killed, 11 died with fatigue, and 11 missing. Gen. Washington's account of the American army, killed, Lt. Col. Bonner, of Pennsylvania; Maj. Dickenson, of Virginia; 3 captains, 4 lieutenants, 1 serjeant, 61 rank and file. Wounded, 2 colonels, 9 captains, 6 lieutenants, 6 ensigns, 1 adjutant, 3 serjeants, 1 drummer, 138 rank and file; 5 serjeants, 126 rank and file, missing, many of whom dropped through fatigue, and some have since come in; 6 horses killed, and 2 wounded: and he writes, they buried 4 officers, and 245 privates, British: left dead on the field; and that there were several new graves near the field of battle; and that Gen. Lee was in arrest, &amp;c. baggage, in that friendly shade, The British troops a cautious movement made; So, near their cubs, th' old lions make a stand, Prepar'd to meet th' approaching hunting band; By their loud cries, and numbers, not dismay'd, They roar collected, scorning to recede; Retarding tremors on the huntsmen seize, Whilst each the troop indignantly surveys, Lashing their sides, then with erected tail, Each onward springs th' assailants to assail; They plunge amidst their whole collected force, Scatter the dogs, bear down both man and horse; To right and left, they traverse o'er the ground, And spread the mangled carnage wide around! Fill the survivors with a cold dismay, Rejoin their cubs, and growling stalk away. Thus unmolested, suffer'd to proceed, The Britons marching on with decent speed, Rejoin'd their baggage, which, untouch'd they found, Conducted safely over distant ground; Whilst Washington, who had so lately try'd Their skill, and courage, rested satisfy'd, The bold attempt perhaps might cost too dear, Shou'd he again attack the British rear. Towards New York they mov'd, and saw no more Approaching foes, nor heard their cannon roar. Soon after this, th' unwelcome news was heard, The Gallic The French squadron, commanded by Count D'Estaing; 12 of the line, and 3 frigates, anchored on the 11th of July 1778, at Sandy Hook: but instead of attacking New York, they weighed, and sailed, and on the 29th appeared off Rhode Island, where the Generals Sir Rob. Pigot, Prescot, Losberg, and Smith, the Colonels Campbell, and Marsh, and other officers of the troops, with the artillery corps, in conjunction with the Captains Brisbane, Christian, Dalrymple, Smyth, Hudson, Symons, Harwood, Stanhope, Forrest, &amp;c. of the navy, exerted themselves to put the town of Newport, and garrison, in the best posture of defence, determined to make an obstinate resistance. squadron on the coast appear'd; Soldiers, and sailors, rouz'd at glory's call, To baffle and oppose the threat'ning Gaul; A firm defence both Howe, and Clinton plann'd; From merchant ships the ships of war were mann'd: Warn'd of the resolution that prevail'd, D'Estaing soon weigh'd, and to Rhode Island sail'd; As at New York, he found one martial soul Seem'd to pervade, and animate the whole; Pigot, and Brisbane, emulous aspir'd, Like gallant Howe, and Clinton, nobly fir'd, With Britain's troops, and rugged tars, t' oppose The continental troops, and Gallic foes: The Congress vessels join'd D'Estaing's command, Whilst Sullivan's large army on the land, At Providence, for embarkation lay, They might co-operate by land, and sea: The French expected succours to be sent; But none arriving from the continent; Twelve of the line their near approaches made; And 'midst a gen'ral constant cannonade From batt'ries, by the British tars maintain'd, They fighting pass'd, and Newport's harbour gain'd, But strange event! instead of an attack, The French next morn prepar'd for moving back! They weigh'd, set sail, as on the day before, The batt'ries pass'd amidst a mutual roar, Stood off from shore, expecting soon to meet, In rough engagement with the British fleet; For Howe had sail'd, (tho' with inferior The French fleet consisted of 1 ship of 90 guns, 1 of 84, 5 of 74, 5 of 64, and 4 frigates of 36 guns. The British fleet, 1 of 74 guns, 7 of 64, 4 of 50, 2 of 44, and 4 frigates of 32 guns, with 3 fireships. After the storm, on the 13th of Aug 1778, at night; the Renown, a 50 gun ship, Cap. Dayson, fell in with, and engaged Count D'Estaing, in the Languedoc, dismasted a 90 gun ship; as did Commodore Hotham, in the Preston, a 50 gun ship, with the Tonant, an 80 gun ship; but were obliged to decline the renewal of the fight next morning, as 6 French ships of the line appeared, and bore down towards them; and on the 16th Capt. Rayner, in the Isis, a 50 gun ship, engaged Le Zele, a French undamaged 74 gun ship, and behaved with great gallantry, as to oblige her to sheer off, and decline the action. force,) From Sandy Hook, and thither shap'd his course. Both admirals strove the weather-gage to gain, As they manÅuvred on the swelling main: Two days, and nights, were in this manner spent, And both sides seem'd on final action bent; When Providence all potent, interpos'd, Before the fleets in line of battle clos'd: With a rough blust'ring storm each squadron strove, And wide asunder from each other drove; And as they scatter'd on the troubled sea, Their boltsprits sprung, roll'd masts and yards away. The tempest ceas'd, the sea much calmer grew; Had now an enemy appear'd in view, The storm had left them in such dismal plight, That neither squadron seem'd prepar'd for fight, And to repair the damages sustain'd, With all convenient speed a port they gain'd. Meanwhile, the continental war on shore, A formidable threat'ning aspect wore; Newport became the Gen'ral's chiefest care, Whilst unobstructed, Sullivan drew near; Whose army, slow, and cautious, march'd along, And rumour'd more than twenty thousand strong: Advanc'd in view, they presently broke ground, And took convenient stations all around; 'Gainst whom, the Britions thund'ring greeting sent, Their sev'ral near approaches to prevent; The num'rous colonists with vigor wrought, And forward ev'ry apparatus brought; To right and left, their batt'ries rose to view, And down the hill they nearer Newport drew, Mortars, and cannon, now incessant roar'd, With fulminating batt'ring mischief stor'd: Thrice they Major-gen. Sir Robert Pigot gave the following account: âOn the 11th of Aug. 1778, the continental forces were discovered breaking ground on Honyman's Hill; and they began to construct several batteries, and lines of approach: on the 19th, they drove the front of the British encampment back, and continued to construct batteries for cannon, and mortars, nearer down the hill, and were indefatigable in making advances to Newport, and the garrison, till the 25th; having in that time, made 3 regular approaches, and seemed to meditate a general storm; but as the French disabled fleet had totally disappeared, on the 26th they discontinued their works, and on the 28th, at night, the enemy retreated from their lines, and works, near Newport; and after several smart skirmishes (and perhaps equal slaughter on both sides); on the 30th of Aug. at night, they retreated from Ball's Hill, &amp;c. over Bristol, and Howland Ferry, and relinquished every hold on the island.â Gen. Sullivan's account is much to the same purport, and authenticates several passages in the retreat. Gen. Clinton's account of the number in each army, is as follows; British 3,500; Continental, 18,000. Gen. Pigot, and Capt. Brisbane's account of the loss of the British, during the siege, harrassing, &amp;c. Total killed, 1 captain, 1 volunteer, 4 serjeants, 33 rank and file. Wounded, 2 captains, 5 lieutenants, 7 ensigns, 13 serjeants, 184 rank and file: 1 lieutenant, 1 serjeant, 10 privates missing. The Juno, Lark, Orpheus, and Cerberus frigates, of 32 guns each; the King's Fisher, of 16 guns, and 2 gallies, were burnt; and the Flora of 32 guns, and the Falcon of 18 guns, were sunk; and 10 sail of transports were sunk, when the French fleet made their approaches to the harbour, to keep them at a distance from the batteries. Gen. Clinton embarked, and sailed from New York with 4000 men, to assist Gen. Pigot; but finding the enemy had evacuated Rhode Island, he resolved to employ his forces in a descent on the enemy's coast; accordingly, Major-gen. Grey, with the troops, and Capt. Robert Fanshaw, in the Carysfort frigate, with other armed vessels, and transports, proceeded to Accushnet River, Bedford, Fair Haven, Martha's Vineyard, the Sound, Cran's Mill, Holmes's Hole, &amp;c. They took, burnt, and destroyed, 8 sail of large vessels, from 2 to 300 tons; a large privateer ship on the stocks; 6 armed vessels, from 10 to 16 guns; brigs, sloops, and schooners, amounting in all to 80; 23 whale boats, and several others; 2 large rope walks; a battery of 11 heavy cannon; blew up the magazine, and platform, and burnt the barracks for 200 men; destroyed a salt-work, and took a considerable quantity of salt, and plank, and staves: they burnt 26 storehouses (and others) filled with great quantities of rum, sugar, molasses, coffee, tobacco, cotton, tea, medicines, gun-powder, sail-cloth, cordage, &amp;c. and brought off from Martha's Vineyard, 300 oxen, and 10,000 sheep, 1000 l. sterling paper tax; 776 firelocks, and several other weapons; a quantity of powder, ball, flints, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. The British lost, 1 killed, 4 wounded, and 16 missing. The Provincials, 4 killed, and 16 taken, to exchange for the 16 missing. approach'd in front, seem'd undismay'd, And forc'd the British vet'rans to recede; But when the Gallic squadron disappear'd, And Sullivan th' unwelcome tidings heard Of Clinton's near approach, they seem'd to slack, As if inclining to decline th' attack; Their troubled minds foreboding a defeat, Their views all center'd in a safe retreat; To compass their designs, they therefore made A backward movement, 'midst nocturnal shade; Foremost, 'mongst those in harrassing employ'd, Smith, Prescot, Losberg, Bruce, their foe annoy'd; Marsh, Campbell, Trench, and Coore, bold sons of Mars, Th' artill'ry corps, join'd by the British tars, Brown, Fanning, Voit, Noltenus, brought to test, To meet their foes a readiness exprest. At intervals, whilst moving retrograde, Crane, Jackson, Laurens, Livingston, and Wade, With Lovell, Fleury, Talbot, made an halt, And first sustain'd the harrassers assault; And when hard press'd, for the disputed ground, Green's, Cornell's, Varnum's, in the front were found. Quaker's and Turkey Hill, the Britons gain'd; On Bull's commanding height their foes remain'd: On rising ground, in view, each army stood, And now, a thund'ring cannonade ensu'd; The Britons forward mov'd in rough attack, To win their works, and drive them farther back; A smart and long engagement was th' event; Each party reinforcements forward sent; Both briskly fought, th' assailants and th' assail'd, Advanc'd, retir'd, and each in turn prevail'd; And when the grand attack ceas'd all around, Each army stood retir'd, on rising ground: A dreadful interval appear'd between, Where wounded, dead, and dying men were seen! No foes cou'd seize their prey, no mournful friend, Dar'd to march forth, and kind assistance lend! Th' artill'ry yawning stood, prepar'd to throw A storm of bullets to the vale below. With night, both parties quitted the dispute, And the loud thunder of the war grew mute: The Colonists retir'd to Windmill Height, But not to rest, for thro' the gloomy night, To compass their designs, they labour'd hard; Next morn, perhaps, the Britons might retard Their further progress, stop their destin'd flight; Which they perform'd before the morning light. D'Estaing no more t' assist his friends appear'd; For safety, to the port of Boston steer'd; (Dreading a second time with Howe to meet,) He there refitted his disabled fleet: Evading offer'd fight, from thence he sail'd, And 'gainst the isle of Grenada prevail'd. Meanwhile, upon the northern continent, On Lord Cornwallis lying with his detachment near Newbridge, in Jersey, to open a road for supplies, and protect friends; he dispatched Major-general Grey, on the night of the 27th of Sept. 1778, with the 2d battalion of light infantry, &amp;c. to surprize a regiment of dragoons, near Old Tapan; which he effected, and very few escaped being killed or taken; and he brought in some militia likewise. Capt. Collins of the Zebra, Capt. Christian, of the Vigilant, with other small armed vessels, with Capt. Pat. Ferguson of the 70th regiment, Capt. Cox, and Capt. Campbell of the 3d Jersey volunteers, &amp;c. with about 250 men, proceeded on an expedition to Egg Harbour, in New Jersey; and from the 5th to the 10th of Oct. 1778, they performed a very difficult inland navigation of 20 miles, to Chesnut Neck, &amp;c. They destroyed 2 batteries for 6 guns each, demolished the village, destroyed 10 capital vessels, 3 salt works, and razed several houses belonging to the militia officers, &amp;c. and about the 14th of Oct. Capt. Christian, with the boats, and Captains Ferguson, Cox, &amp;c. with 250 men, proceeded about midnight from Egg Harbour, and after rowing 10 miles, the troops landed, and surprized Polaski's legion of 3 troops of horse, 3 companies of foot, a detachment of artillery, and a field piece. They killed a lieutenant-colonel, and other officers, and about 50 privates, and took 5, and in the whole expedition had but 6 killed and wounded. N. B. They generously neglected the opportunity of destroying part of the baggage and equipage of the legion, as the houses in which it lay, belonged to some inoffensive quakers. About the latter end of Feb. 1779, Lieutenant-col. Stirling landed on the Jersey shore, and burnt some barracks, and several stores, in which were about 130 barrels of flour, 30 puncheons of rum, soap, candles, &amp;c. took 1 officer, and 32 privates, with very little loss killed and wounded. Capt. Willet made a descent on the Connecticut coast, and destroyed Kebble's Mills, near Campo; where a great quantity of flour, and grain, with provisions, were collected for Mons. D'Estaing. In the beginning of March, Major-gen. Tryon marched from Kingsbridge to Horseneck, with a large detachment, routed 300 Provincials, took 3 iron field-pieces, six-pounders, 25 prisoners, 40 head of cattle, and destroyed a salt-work. From the 8th of May, to the 16th, 1779. Commodore Sir Geo. Collier, with a small squadron, and Major-gen. Matthew, with a detachment of troops, destroyed at Norfolk, Suffolk, and several places in the Chesapeak Bay, Virginia; 2 French ships, with 1000 hogsheads of tobacco, 3000 barrels of pork; burned many vessels, with several stores, and took possession of the town of Portsmouth, with a large quantity of masts, yards, timber, plank, iron, pitch, tar, nails, blocks, rigging, sail cloth, and other naval and military stores; a 14 gun privateer, 117 barrels of pork, 113 barrels of flour, 59 hogsheads of molasses, 43 puncheons of rum, &amp;c &amp;c. &amp;c. with little loss of men on either side. In the beginning of July 1779, Major-gen. Tryon made a descent at Wect Haven in Connecticut, burnt the public stores, brought off a privateer, and 6 field pieces: he proceeded from thence to Fairfield, and Norwalk, and being fired at from the houses, burnt both villages. Gen. Tryon regrets the unintended destruction of two places of public worship. He returned from this expedition, with the loss of 20 royalists killed, 96 wounded, and 32 missing: the loss of the Provincials in men uncertain. About the same time, Lieutenant-col. Tarleton attempted to surprize Sheldon's regiment of cavalry, at Pound Bridge; where, although they were timely noticed of his approach, he killed, wounded, and took about 30, their standard, and a great quantity of their helmets, arms, and accoutrements; and was forced to burn some houses, to quiet a party of militia that molested him: he had only one man and horse killed, and one man wounded. About the same time, Paulus Hook was surprized, by mistaking the Provincials for their own foraging party: but Major Sutherland, the commandant, with about 40 hussars, threw himself into a redoubt, and behaved so gallantly, that the enemy evacuated the garrison, without damaging the cannon, or firing the barracks, and carried off 40 invalids; but being pursued, one of their officers, and several privates were taken. Commodore Sir George Collier, with his squadron, and Gen. Sir Hen. Clinton, with 2,600 land-forces, proceeded to Newhaven, took, and destroyed the fort, 5 large vessels, 2 privateer brigs, on the flocks, 20 whale boats, 2 saw mills, a large salt work, and warehouses of stores, merchandize, &amp;c. devastation Britain's chiefs were bent; Cornwallis, Clinton, Tryon, mov'd around, With Tarleton, Stirling, Grey, o'er hostile ground: Collins, Cox, Ferguson, and Christian sail'd, And where they came, by land and sea prevail'd; Collier, and Matthew, likewise jointly bore Their wasting war to the Virginian shore; M'Pherson, Prevost, Campbell, On the 23d of Dec. 1778, Lieutenant-col. Campbell, with the 71st regiment, 2 battalions of Hessians, 4 ditto of loyal provincials, and a detachment of the royal artillery; conducted by a small squadron of ships of war, under the command of Commodore Parker, in the PhÅnix, arrived off Tybee; and on the 29th, at break of day, a landing was effected on the River Dam, and the advanced parties of the enemy were repulsed. Col. Campbell writes to the following purport: âThe continental forces, under the command of Major-gen. Rob. Howe, were drawn up about half a mile east of the town, across the road, with several pieces of cannon in their front; consisting of Thompson's, and Eugee's regiments, of Carolina troops, part of the 1st, 2d, 3d, and 4th battalions of Col. Elbert's Georgia brigade; with riflemen, in the adjacent plantations; the number of the militia uncertain. Their flanks were defended by wooded swamps, houses, and plantations; their rear was covered by an old line of intrenchment, with cannon properly disposed: in the center of their line, about 200 paces in front, at a critical spot, between two swamps, a trench was cut across the road, and about 100 yards in front of this trench, a marshy rivulet ran, almost parallel the whole extent of their front, and the bridge burnt down,â &amp;c. Col. Campbell proceeds after mentioning the rout: âOne stand of colours, 48 cannon, 23 mortars, 94 barrels of powder, the fort, with all its stores, the capital of Georgia, the shipping in the harbour, with a large quantity of provisions, fell into our possession. The British lost 1 captain, 1 subaltern, 7 privates, killed; and 1 serjeant, and 18 privates, wounded. Eighty-three of the enemy were found dead, 11 wounded, and about 30 lost in the swamp. Taken prisoners, 1 colonel, 3 majors, 11 captains, 15 lieutenants, 8 surgeons, commissaries, &amp;c. 33 serjeants, 7 drummers, 5 fifes, 370 rank and file Baird, and Taws, Embark'd with Parker, in the British cause; To seize Savannah was the point in view; They briskly pass'd (as near the town they drew) A narrow causeway, ditch'd, and swamp'd around, Leading towards an hostile rising ground: The Capt. Cameron and 2 Highlanders, were killed, and 5 wounded, in this attack. Caledonians this obstruction clear'd, Led on by Maitland, Cameron, and Baird; The British main corps soon debark'd, and now The continental forces, under Howe, Cover'd with cannon, they well posted found, Who seem'd determin'd to dispute the ground; Through nat'ral obstacles their passage lay; A glorious, dang'rous, intersected way! With caution Campbell held the Britons back; When, ev'ry corps dispos'd to make th' attack, They gallantly advanc'd, whilst either side, Their musquetry, and loud artill'ry ply'd: Before both parties join'd in closer fight, Baird rapidly advancing on the right, Under the covert of a swampy wood, Had gain'd the rear where Georgia's forces stood; To closest fight his party quickly flew, He drove them thence, and seiz'd their cannon too; To make the rout complete their friends began, Across his front the Carolinians ran, The Caledonians rush'd upon their flanks, Hew'd down, dispers'd, and thinn'd the broken ranks; The main corps backward shrunk, no longer stood, Confusion, slaughter, total rout ensu'd! The fort was taken, with Savannah's town; The province re-annex'd to Britain's crown. Prevost, in quest of military fame, From St. Augustine's to Savannah came: Most difficult this expedition prov'd; 'Midst hunger, Major-gen. Prevost, being ordered by Gen. Sir Hen. Clinton, to proceed from St. Augustine's to Savannah, in the middle of the winter, took the Fort of Sunbury in his way, with 21 pieces of cannon, and 212 prisoners; 1 captain and 2 privates killed, 6 wounded. The British, 1 private killed, and 3 wounded. toils, and cold, the Britons mov'd. Moultrie's and Lincoln's corps were hov'ring round, To hem the Britons in a narrow bound; But Prevost scorning to be held at Bay, Made an Vide Major-gen. Prevost's letter, in the London Gazette, 20th of April 1779; viz. that the movements of the enemy seemed to indicate an intention of hampering the British troops in their quarters, &amp;c. He then proceeds: âAccordingly Major M'Pherson, with 1st battalion, 71st regiment (of Highlanders) and some irregulars, with 2 field-pieces, was directed by Lieutenant-col. Prevost, to advance towards the bridge, to mask the movements he himself had made with the 2d battalion, 71st regiment, a corps of light infantry, commanded by Sir James Baird, and 3 companies of grenadiers, of the Florida brigade, with which he took a long circuit of 50 miles to cross the creek above them, and endeavour to gain their rear. The Provincials were surprized, totally defeated, and dispersed, with the loss of 7 pieces of cannon, several stands of colours, almost all their arms, all their ammunition, and baggage.â Gen. Prevost likewise writes, âThe 2d in command, Brigadier-gen. Elbert, with 26 officers besides were taken, and near 200 men; about 150 were killed in the field of battle, and adjoining woods and swamps; but their chief loss consists in the number of officers and men drowned in attempting to save themselves from the slaughter, and plunging into a deep and rapid river. The loss on our side, was only five privates killed, and one officer, and 10 privates wounded. On our side 3 grenadier companies of the 61st regiment, Sir James Baird's light infantry, Capt. Tawes's troop of light dragoons, with about 150 Provincials, rangers, and militia, making in all about 900, composed the corps that attacked about 2,500 of the enemy, according to their commissary's account, taken prisoner.â attempt to drive them far away: Through Major-gen. Prevost mentioned several reasons for penetrating into South Carolina, and advancing against Charlestown, and gives an account of this affair, to the following purport: âBrigadier-gen. Moultrie's corps of observation, about 2000, chiefly militia, were struck with a panic, when they saw the British troops emerging from the swamps; made a weak resistance, and in the greatest hurry and confusion fled towards Charlestown, which was summoned; but as they hourly expected General Lincoln with a large reinforcement, had a numerous artillery mounted on their ramparts, their naval force covering and flanking their lines; the British army no more than 2000 men fit for duty, in want of battering artillery, and having no naval force to cooperate with them; the summons proved ineffectual.â The British army retired, and took post on the main, at Stono Ferry, and on the Island of St. John; and Gen. Prevost writes, on the 20th of June, âAfter every preparation had been made to abandon those posts, the enemy's whole force attacked the post at Stono Ferry, with 8 pieces of cannon, and 5000 men: their attack was at first spirited; but the good countenance of the troops, and the fire of the armed flat, that covered the left flank of our post, just as the troops were ferrying over from St. John's Island, to reinforce it, obliged the enemy to retreat; Lieutenant-col. Maitland, who commanded there, had with him the 1st battalion, 71st Highlanders, then much reduced; a weak battalion of Hessians, and the refugees of North and South Carolina; the whole about 800 men: they behaved with coolness and bravery. The enemy lost a colonel of artillery, much esteemed among them, and about 28 officers of different ranks; and had between 3 and 400 killed and wounded. The British loss was 1 major, 1 lieutenant, 1 ensign, 4 serjeants, 18 rank and file killed; and 1 major, 2 captains, 3 lieutenants, 1 ensign, 7 serjeants, 1 drummer, 77 rank and file wounded; 1 missing.â swamps, were deem'd impassable before, To Carolina's bounds, he terror bore; Towards Charlestown they boldly march'd along, The town was tenable, the works were strong; Their flanking naval force banish'd their fear, And Lincoln with five thousand troops was near; Prevost judiciously withdrew from thence, And chose his posts adapted for defence; Lincoln's collected force, for war prepar'd; Eight thund'ring cannon their approach declar'd; They made a bold and spirited attack, To take, or drive Maitland's detachment back; Th' outnumber'd Britons, veterans, and brave, Receiv'd the shock, and warm reception gave; Inspir'd by Maitland, they maintain'd the fight, And put their num'rous enemies to flight. Now to revenge, or timely to prevent This havoc, spreading through the continent; Chiefly Fort Clinton's, and Montgom'ry's fall, Which for retaliation seem'd to call; The rouzing colonists, led on by Brigadier-gen. Wayne, in his letter to Gen. Washington, dated July 17th 1779, after mentioning the difficulties in their march of 14 miles, gives the following account of the action at Stoney Point, on the 16th of July, about 1 o'clock in the morning: âCol. Febiger's, and Meigs's regiments, with Major Hull's detachment, formed the right column: Col. Butler's regiment, and Major Mulfree's 2 companies, the left: the van of the right, under Lieutenant-col. Fleury, preceded by 20 picked men, to remove the abbatis, advanced with unloaded muskets, and fixed bayonets, as did the van of the left, under the command of Major Steward,â &amp;c. He then proceeds: âAbout 20 minutes after 12 the assault began, previous to which I placed myself at the head of Febiger's regiment, or 8 columns, and gave the troops the most pointed orders not to fire upon any account; which order was faithfully obeyed. Neither the deep morass, the formidable and double rows of abbatis, or the strong works in front and flank, could damp the ardor of the troops, who, in the face of a most tremendous and incessant fire of musketry, and from cannon loaded with grape-shot, forced their way at the point of the bayonet, through every obstacle; both columns meeting in the center of the enemy's works, nearly at the same instant.â Total of the provincial forces killed; 2 serjeants, 13 privates: wounded, 1 lieutenant-colonel, 2 captains, 3 lieutenants, 10 serjeants, 3 corporals, and 44 privates. Lieutenant-col. Henry Johnson, who commanded at Stoney Point, gives the following account of the British loss, in the action of the 16th of July 1779. Total, 1 captain, 3 serjeants, 1 drummer, 15 rank and file killed; and 1 captain, 3 lieutenants, 2 ensigns, 1 serjeant, 67 rank and file wounded; 1 captain, 1 lieutenant, 1 serjeant, 1 drummer, 54 rank and file missing; 1 colonel, 4 captains, 12 lieutenants, 5 ensigns, 1 adjutant, 1 surgeon, 1 conductor, 23 serjeants, 16 drummers, 408 rank and file, prisoners. The Colonists immediately commenced a cannonade against Lieutenant-col. Webster, at Verplanks, but without the desired effect; and Gen. Clinton, on the first intelligence of this affair, pushed the army forward to relieve Verplanks, and recover Stoney Point, and bring on a general action; but General Washington, with his wonted caution, avoided coming to action; and on the appearance of Brigadier-gen. Stirling, with his division, the provincials abandoned the fort at Stoney Point with precipitation. Wayne, Grieving for houses burnt, and kinsmen slain; 'Gainst Stoney Point advanc'd, with warlike glow, Premeditating sudden overthrow: Buoy'd up by hope, they forward press'd untir'd, By Butler, Febiger, and Wayne inspir'd: Upon each flank mounting the parapet, They forward rush'd, and in the center met: In vain the Britons for the battle glow'd, A torrent of destruction round them flow'd: Thus intercepted, they cou'd not unite, And rush imbody'd to commence the fight: Butler, and Meigs, within the fort they found; Hull, Febiger, and Wayne, were gath'ring round; Fleury, and Stewart, boldly rush'd along, And all towards the place of action throng; Whilst Mulfree 'gainst the front advanc'd, to pass Across an intervening deep morass: Their silent havoc, as injoin'd by Wayne, Added fresh horror to the gloomy scene! With bay'nets fix'd, they wounds, and slaughter dealt, And oft in turn an Highland broad-sword felt, Or from a random ball receiv'd a blow, And sunk to earth in sanguin'd overthrow: Out-number'd, and surpriz'd, in sad suspense, With minds foredoding fatal consequence, The British parties were at distance held; They cou'd not hope their foes cou'd be repel'd: Wayne gave them quarter which they timely crav'd, And the survivors from destruction sav'd. From town to town the joyful tidings ran, The state of Massachussets form'd a plan, To share with Wayne their portion of renown, Hoping success their enterprize wou'd crown; Their troops imbody'd 'gainst Col. Maclean, who was sent to establish a post on the River Penobscot, landed on the 16th of June 1779, with 450 rank and file of the 74th regiment, and 200 of the 82d. Maclean were sent, Conducted by a naval armament, Which, unobstructed, to Penobscot steer'd, And near the British settlement appear'd; They boldly strove to pass the naval bar; But twice On the 25th and 26th of July, the continental fleet commanded by Commodore D'Sallonstall, attacked the Albany, North, and Nautillus, to force a passage; but were repulsed; and on the 25th, 26th, and 27th, they made several attempts to land, but were constantly repulsed: however, on the morning of the 28th, under cover of a very heavy cannonade, they effected their purpose, which obliged Capt. Maclean to call in all his outposts, and to think of only strengthening and defending his works: on the 30th the enemy, commanded by Gen. Lovell, opened a battery against the fort, at about 750 yards distance, and from that day, to the 12th of Aug. the cannonading continued with great spirit on both sides, with frequent skirmishes without the fort. repel'd by Britain's ships of war; They distant mov'd; with warlike rage inspir'd, As if repulse each individual fir'd; Their troops in boats cover'd by naval roar, Bore opposition down, and gain'd the shore: Maclean, and Britain's chiefs, undaunted fought; Each man their flame by inspiration caught; Join'd by the tars, they rais'd redoubts around, To render tenable the British ground; Rough specimens of resolution gave, Their honour, and th' unfinish'd fort to save: Without the works, th' assailants, and th' assail'd, Oft met in skirmish, and in turn prevail'd. The Colonists impatient of delay, And scorning longer to be held at bay; Boldly resolv'd a gen'ral storm to make; Their hopes of conquest on th' event to stake. Before both parties in close action met, And fiercely struggled at the parapet; The thund'ring news arriv'd, which cast a damp, And fill'd with fear the continental camp; Collier was near, with Britain's naval force, And up Penobscot River shap'd his course! They thought of nothing but a sudden flight, And reimbark'd amidst the shades of night! But Saltonstall, On the 14th of August 1779, in the morning, Commodore Sir George Collier, in the Raisonable, with the Greyhound, Blonde, Virginia, Camilla, and Galatea frigates, came in sight of the continental fleet, drawn up in a crescent, across the river; but, as they advanced, a sudden and unexpected flight took place. The king's ships followed them up the river, took the Hampden of 20 guns, and the Hunter of 18 guns; blew up, burnt, and destroyed the Warren, a fine new frigate of 32 guns, 18 and 12 pounders; 7 other ships of war, 5 brigs, 1 sloop, and 1 schooner, mounting 248 guns, with 24 transports, and gained some cannon of 18 and 12 pounders. The loss of the British troops during the fiege, 23 killed, 33 wounded, and 11 missing, 4 seamen killed, 9 wounded, and 2 missing: the loss of men on the Provincial side uncertain, except about 60 which fell in a dispute among themselves, after they were driven on shore. ignoble flight disdain'd, And in his station till the morn remain'd; Across the river in a crescent drew; And when the British fleet appear'd in view, They seem'd resolv'd the transports to defend, And for the passage bravely to contend; Yet, when they saw the frigates drawing near, Foreboding tremors, and desponding fear, Across the crescent flew, their courage fail'd, Confus'd, they fled before they were assail'd! None of their fleet a place of safety gain'd, Great was the loss, and damage they sustain'd. Tho' plung'd amidst a great and fruitless cost, Their naval armament and transports lost; Tho' from Penobscot's distant hostile shore, Driv'n in distress the desert wilds t' explore, The Colonists had other schemes in view, As if with troubles resolution grew: They meditate revenge, to war inclin'd, In hope some vulnerable part to find; To gain their point, their preparations tend; They 'gainst Savannah join'd their Gallic friend; Who now arriv'd, (fraught with insidious guile,) Boasting his conquest o'er Grenada's isle; Flush'd with success, appear'd off On the 4th of Sept. 1779, they appeared, and on the 9th 4 large frigates came over the bar. Tybee bar, And there display'd the threat'ning pomp of war. Prevost, with Britain's chiefs employ'd each hour, To baffle and repel the Gallic pow'r; Moncrief his vigilance and skill display'd, With judgment most mature the ground survey'd; To add new batteries incessant wrought, And rais'd redoubts on each convenient spot: Brown, Henry, Fisher, full of martial glow, Quitted their element to fight the foe; With them, on shore came Britain's active tars, To take their stations in the field of Mars, Whilst Lincoln, and Polaski, quick advance, With horse and foot, to join the troops of France. Ere the Provincials had a junction made, Or Count D'Estaing began a cannonade; A flag, and summons, he to Prevost sent, Fram'd with a view resistance to prevent: The French were strong, th' insurgents nearer drew; But Prevost, with procrastinating view Amus'd D'Estaing, and fortify'd the ground, And call'd his troops from every post around; From Beaufort soon the gallant Maitland came, And brought four hundred to the field of fame; With indefatigable zeal they strove, And through each obstacle resistless drove; Prevost rejoic'd; grew more resolv'd to stand 'Gainst the united force, by sea and land; Always preparing vig'rously t' oppose The French force, join'd with continental foes. To final council call'd; each chief appear'd; In which not one dissentient voice was heard; Firmly resolv'd, each officer withdrew; From post to post, they next their troops review; In ev'ry face a rough complacence shone, When their determination was made known; The seamen gave three loud exulting cheers, Which rung discordant in the Frenchmen's ears; And Prevost greatly pleas'd with this event, The news in thunder from the rampart sent. Lincoln arriv'd, and scorning slow delay, They blockaded the town by land and sea; This pow'rful According to Count D'Estaing's letter, dated 16th Sept. 1779, to Gen. Prevost, this junction was effected on the 16th or 17th of Sept. at farthest; and, according to the best accounts we can get, we may conclude the fort and town of Savannah was invested by about 16000 Continental and French forces, horse and foot; 22 sail of the line, 9 frigates, several of the Congress ships of war, and Continental armed vessels; and more troops expected from several parts; and from every circumstantial account it appears, that the troops, and seamen, with Gen. Prevost, did not exceed 3000 effective men. junction made, they full to view, With formidable aspect nearer drew: And now like moles, the engineers of France, By sap, towards the garrison advance. To vex and check th' advancing foes, and bar The progress of the subterraneous war; Two Caledonian chiefs alternate rose, And gallantly the post of danger chose. As from a rock, an eagle wings his way, And sudden souses on his destin'd prey; So, from the lines, his party Major-gen. Prevost, in his account of the siege, wrote as follows: âThe 24th of Sept. in the morning, the enemy were discovered to have pushed a sap to within 300 yards of our abbatis, to the left of the center: at 9 o'clock, 3 companies of light infantry (97 rank and file) were sent out under Major Graham of the 16th, &amp;c. The conduct of the major, and his little corps, was spirited, and proper, almost above praise! Darting out with amazing rapidity, he was in an instant in the enemy's nearest work, which he kept possession of till 2 solid columns at length were very near gaining his flanks, and till the whole French damp was in motion; he then ordered a retreat, which being as rapid as the advance, left the heads of the enemy's columns in an instant exposed to the fire of our artillery, which galled them severely, and soon obliged them to retire behind their works. Our loss is 1 subaltern, 2 serjeants, 3 rank and file killed; and 15 rank and file wounded: that of the enemy, as we have been since well informed, 14 officers, and 145 rank and file killed and wounded (by much the greater part killed) of their best troops.â Graham led, And rapidly towards the Frenchmen sped; His active little corps not only gain'd, But long the nearest Gallic work maintain'd! Nor did he quit possession of the ground, Till much superior forces gather'd round; Then speedily towards the camp withdrew; Two Gallic columns brisk advanc'd in view; Moncrief soon drove them back with quicken'd pace, Behind their works, with slaughter, and disgrace. Wrapp'd in surrounding gloom, M'Arthur Gen. Prevost writes; âThe 27th of Sept. at night, Major M'Arthur of the 71st, with a party of the picquet, advanced, and fired into the enemy's works, and amusing them for some little time, drew off, with 3 wounded. He set the French and Americans a firing upon each other; their loss acknowledged 50.â next Advanc'd, and with uncertainty perplext The Transatlantics, and their French allies; Who, suddenly alarm'd, seiz'd with surprize! With random fire each other much annoy'd; Mistaken friends confus'd, their friends destroy'd! To strengthen, add, annoy, and to repair, Became the daily and nocturnal care Of Britain's troops, and tars, who firm defy'd The Colonists, and French, in war ally'd, The Gallic shells, and hostile cannonade, Sad havoc, and promiscuous slaughter made! By a disploding shell, or random ball, Women, and children, oft were doom'd to fall! Now Prevost felt corroding cares perplex; Anxiety to save the softer sex, And helpless children, all removed far From the rude shock, and dreadful chance of war, Mov'd him to send a message to desire D'Estaing's permission, that they might retire: Both Lincoln, Gen. Prevost, after mentioning his forming a camp, the battery from the French ships, and the advances of the enemy on every quarter, with the traverses made, platforms laid, redoubts raised, the boom got across the channel, and ditches deepened, and every other preparation to obstruct the enemy, and make a vigorous defence, proceeds thus: âOct. the 3d, at midnight, the enemy began to bombard from 9 mortars, of 8 and 10 inches, continued about 2 hours; the 4th, at day-light, they open with 9 mortars, 37 pieces of cannon, from the land side, and 16 from the water. Continue without intermission till 8 o'clock; on the 5th, the enemy prosecute their works on their left, and we repair, strengthen, and add. On the 6th, they throw carcasses into the town, and burn one wooden house; at 11 o'clock, we sent to Count D'Estaing for permission to send the women and children out of town, on board of ships, and down the river, under the protection of a French ship of war, until the business should be decided. After 3 hours, and a great deal of intermediate cannon, and shells, received an insulting answer from Messieurs Lincoln, and D'Estaing, in conjunction.â Vide letters in the Gazette. and D'Estaing, roughly reply'd, They must the fury of the storm abide; Amidst which storm, Prevost perhaps might feel More poignant anguish, than from wounds of steel! The troops and tars, rouz'd by this rough reply, Resolv'd they'd conquer, or wou'd bravely die. All parley ceas'd, both sides on war intent, Their shot, and shells, against each other sent. D'Estaing convinc'd that he must nearer move, (As distant war cou'd not effective prove,) Scorning at bay longer retain'd to stand, Prepar'd to force his way with sword in hand; Lincoln agreed, and long before the dawn, French, and Provincials, from their trenches drawn, Their choice Sir James Wright, Bart. Governor of Georgia, wrote that the flower of both armies, amounting to about 4000, were in this body, which made the attack: Gen. Prevost wrote to the same purport; adding that they were led by D'Estaing in person, with all the principal officers of either army, and advanced in three columns, &amp;c. prime vet'ran troops, in darkness hid, Towards the fort advanc'd with silent speed: Their destin'd stations gain'd, ere day appear'd, Their hostile greeting suddenly was heard; The rough salute the garrison alarm'd, The troops and tars with emulation warm'd, Ran to their posts, and waited undismay'd, To hold that post, or give their comrades aid: The loud respondent British thunder roar'd; From well-work'd guns, with grape-shot amply ston'd, They sent retarding mortal show'rs of balls, Amongst the Transatlantics, and the Gauls; From right to left, a fire incessant kept, Which like the besom of destruction swept! With Count D'Estaing, (as candidates for fame) O'Duin, Fontagne, and Noailles came: A pow'rful junction Count De Dillon made, With his Hibernian veteran brigade: Lincoln, Polaski, oft in battle try'd, With many gallant chiefs on either side, Gallic Hibernians, 'mongst the Frenchmen mix'd, And Transatlantics, with their bay'nets fix'd, A brisk advancing constant fire maintain'd, And bought with blood each inch of ground they gain'd! A painful wound, inflicted by a ball, D'Estaing receiv'd; but still th' intrepid Gaul, Press'd onward bleeding, scorning to fall back, And briskly led his troops 'midst rough attack: Polaski next, felt a retarding blow, And down he sunk in mortal overthrow. 'Mongst other chiefs, Fontagne receiv'd a wound, He turn'd reluctant, limping o'er the ground. From post to post, Moncrief with ardor flew, Station'd his corps, and as they nearer drew; The tars, and bombardiers, sent show'rs of balls, With lightning wing'd among th' advancing Gauls, With transverse havoc their designs to mar, Deform, and thin the Gallic ranks of war. The continental troops with vigor strove; And like a torrent, on the Gen. Prevost writes, âThe attack was very spirited, and for some time very obstinately persevered in, particularly on the Ebenezer Road redoubt. Two stands of colours were actually planted, and several of the assailants killed upon the parapet; but they met with so determined a resistance, and the fire of three seamen batteries, and the field-pieces, taking them in almost every direction, was so severe, that they were thrown into some disorder, at least at a stand; at this most critical moment, Major Glasier of the 60th regiment, with the 60th grenadiers, and the marines, advancing rapidly from the lines, charged (It may be said) with a degree of fury! in an instant, the ditches of the redoubt, and a battery to its right in rear, were cleared, the grenadiers charging briskly into them, and the enemy drove in confusion over the abbatis, and into the swamp. On this occasion, Capt. Wickham of the 2d, 60th grenadiers, was greatly distinguished. A considerable body or column, more to the left, was repulsed in every attempt to deploy out of the hollow, by the brisk and well-directed fire of a militia redoubt, and Hamilton's small corps of North Carolinians, on its right, moved there with a field-piece, to take them obliquely; a sailor battery, still nearer to the right, took them in flank. As the enemy retreated, we contented ourselves plying them with our cannon, advancing some field-pieces to the abbatis as long as they were in fight, or judged within reach. Lieutenant-col. D'Porbeck, of Weissenbach's, field-officer of the day, of the right wing, and being in the redoubt where the attack began, had an opportunity, which he well improved, to signalize himself, in a most gallant manner. The troops who defended it were part of the South Carolina loyalists, light dragoons dismounted, and the battalion men of the 5th, 60th, in all about 100; commanded by special order, by Capt. Taws, of the 71st, a good and gallant officer, and who nobly fell with his sword in the body of the third he killed with his own hand.â Frenchmen drove, Forward they rush'd as if without dismay! Through all impediments to force their way! Where gallant Taws, and Porbeck, honour gain'd, By Glasier, Wickham, Hamilton sustain'd: The Frenchmen with each other seem'd to vie, To mount the parapets, or bravely die! The Britons nobly rouz'd, as they drew near, Stood firm, th' assaulted parapets to clear; The troops and tars, in each attack'd redoubt, Now labour'd hard to keep th' assailants out; With wonted vigor resolutely flew, T' oppose each Frenchman, as he rose to view: On those in front, the French rear closely prest, And roughly put their brav'ry to the test! A Gallic chief all threat'ning dangers brav'd, And on the parapet his ensign wav'd Amidst a shout; which Britain's tars return'd, Each other chear'd, and for close action burn'd; âVive le roy!â exclaim'd th' exulting Gaul; Taws heard indignant, and at glory's call, With active zeal th' intruding Frenchman met, And spurn'd him headlong from the parapet: At his repulse, and death, unterrify'd, âVive le roy!â another Frenchman cry'd; Erect upon the parapet appear'd, And boldly there a second ensign rear'd! The fort's defendants, and the troops without, United, rais'd an animating shout; Taws forward sprung, gave a repelling blow, He disappear'd in sanguin'd overthrow; A purple dye the Gallic ensigns wore, Trod under foot, and stain'd with Gallic gore. From place to place, Taws briskly sped t' oppose The growing torrent of advancing foes; Where threat'ning danger frown'd, he made a stand, To check a firm determin'd Gallic band: Who, with their Transatlantic allies vy'd, Forward to rush, inspir'd with martial pride! And seem'd resolv'd no danger shou'd retard, Tho' Death himself the parapet shou'd guard! Taws bravely fac'd the foremost, to arrest His bold intrusion, as he forward prest; They met, engag'd, he made the Frenchman feel The mortal thrust of Caledonian steel. Whilst yet he thrust, he felt a fatal ball, Sent from the tube of an observant Gaul; Who mark'd the noble stand the Briton made, And fear'd the future havoc of his blade; Reluctant stood, and unresolv'd t' advance Towards that sword, drench'd in the blood of France! He shunn'd his arm, his frown he could not bear, Which like the Gorgon's petrify'd with fear! The fight grew hot, and neither seem'd to slack In making, or repelling an attack; Tho' fresh assailing parties pour'd around, The Britons gallantly maintain'd their ground: Brown, Henry, Three naval captains, and two lieutenants. Fisher, Lock, and Crawford, made A constant-most successful cannonade: Prevost inspir'd Britannia's sons of Mars, To join in concert with her active tars: Fraser, and Hamilton, most fiercely glow'd, To check them on the Ebenezer road: The vigilant Moncrief travers'd around, His corps he chear'd, with skill survey'd the ground; Directing where to strike the wasting blow, T' accelerate th' assailants overthrow; Such was th' offensive and defensive war, They jointly made, it prov'd a mortal bar To the brisk charge th' assailing forces made; Who, 'midst that well directed cannonade, Suspended stood; expecting a defeat, And meditated on a safe retreat; To fix their choice, and magnify their fears, Glasier, and Wickham, with the grenadiers, Like a strong torrent breaking down a mound, And sweeping rapid o'er th' adjacent ground, Quitted the lines, and with their bay'nets fix'd, With martial fury 'mongst th' assailants mix'd! Widely they spread a sudden overthrow, And made sad havoc of the scatt'ring foe! Frowning, they turn'd; and where a party stood, They drench'd their bay'nets oft in hostile blood. So, when the Trojans pass'd the Grecian wall, Pelides (sudden rouz'd at glory's call) Led on his myrmidons, who trod them down, And drove them headlong back towards the town. As round this little party danger grew, A corps of Caledonians rush'd to view; To battle they advanc'd with wonted speed, (A firm support in time of dang'rous need:) Their broad vibrating swords like meteors blaz'd! The bravest, fiercest Frenchmen, much amaz'd, Retrod the ground to shun the dreadful sight, And with averted looks commenc'd a flight! To multiply their woes, a second ball, Struck the commanding enterprizing Gaul; D'Estaing look'd round, in mind and body pain'd, And mark'd how ill his troops their ground maintain'd! At length he saw them totally give way, And scatter widely round in disarray! Like tim'rous flocks of sheep, lost in affright, When worry'd by the wolves in gloomy night! Despairing of success, he fac'd about, And join'd indignantly the gen'ral rout; By various ways they fled, some to the Major-gen. Prevost, in his account of the action, which was on the 9th of Oct. 1779, writes thus: âOur loss on this occasion, 1 captain, and 15 rank and file, killed: 1 captain, 3 subalterns, and 35 rank and file, wounded: that of the enemy we do not exaggerate, when we set it, in killed and wounded, at 1000 to 1200. The French acknowledged 44 officers, and about 700 men: (to this we may add 2 officers taken, 197 officers and privates killed and wounded during the fiege.) Of the provincials, we may say less; but the unvariable report of deserters, and prisoners (gentlemen) since exchanged, make their loss above 4000; (thus it appears in the copy from the Gazette;) among the wounded were Count D'Estaing, (in two places) Mr. De Fontange, major-general; Count Polasky, since dead; and several others of distinction. We buried 231, and delivered 116 wounded prisoners, greater part mortally. Many were self-burried in the mud of the swamps, and no doubt many were carried of. On the 18th of Oct. the fog clearing off, about 9 o'clock, we were not much surprized to find the enemy had moved off. Gen. Prevost mentions the very active and zealous services of Capt. Henry of the Fowey, Capt. Brown of the Rose, and their officers, and seamen; particularly, Lieutenants Lock, and Crawford, in every part where they could give their assistance; and verbatim, as follows: âI would also wish to mention Capt. Moncrief, commanding engineer; but sincerely sensible that all I can express, will fall greatly short of what that gentleman deserves, not only on this, but on all other occasions, I shall only in the most earnest manner, request your Lordship taking him into your protection, and patronage, to recommend him to his Majesty, as an officer of long service, and most singular merit; assuring you, my Lord, from my own positive knowledge, that there is not one officer, or soldier, in this little army, capable of reflecting, or judging, who will not regard as personal to himself, any mark of royal favour graciously conferred by your Lordship, on Capt. Moncrief. We have been greatly obliged to Major Fraser, of the 71st, acting quarter-master-general, for his zealous and indefatigable industry, in landing, and mounting upon the batteries the cannon, stores, &amp;c. and constantly supplying all wants. The extreme vigilance, and attendance, of Capt, Prevost, acting adjutant-general, deserves to be known. Indeed the whole engineers, and every other public department, were activity itself.â Capt. Shaw, my aid de camp, who will have the honour to deliver this, has been present on every active service in this country. A return of the killed, wounded, and missing, in the different corps, during the siege; 1 captain, 2 lieutenants, 1 ensign, 4 serjeants, 32 rank and file, killed: and 2 captains, 2 lieutenants, 2 serjeants, 1 drummer, 56 rank and file, wounded: 2 drummers, 2 rank and file, missing; 5 serjeants, 2 drummers, 41 rank and file, deserted. camp, Some closer press'd, into th' adjacent swamp Precipitately plung'd, in hasty flight, And in oblivion sunk to shades of night. Whilst show'rs of balls among the Frenchmen fell, Th' artill'ry roar'd a loud departing knell; Within its baneful reach they came no more, But privately decamp'd, and sail'd from shore; That fatal shore, and well defended place, For dreadful slaughter fam'd, and foul disgrace To Gallia's flag, by Britons trodden down In Gallic blood, before Savannah's town.
