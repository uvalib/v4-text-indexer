      <field name="fulltext">ARTS, MANUFACTURES, AND COMMERCE: A POEM. DEDICATION. TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE PRESIDENT, VICE PRESIDENTS, AND MEMBERS OF THE SOCIETY, FOR THE Encouragement OF ARTS, MANUFACTURES, AND COMMERCE. My Lords, and Gentlemen, When I consider, that the ultimate, and (I may say) sole Design of all your Meetings, and Assiduity, is to serve your Country in the truest Sense; and with an unparalleled Generosity, to bestow not the Property of others intrusted to your Management, but your own Money, on the deserving of either Sex: to stimulate by Honorary Expectations the Nobility, to excel in the Use of the Pencil, and to that more noble Undertaking, of raising Groves of Britain's native Oaks, and Elms, to be in future Days launched forth, the floating Bulwarks of our Land, to bear Britannia's vengeful Thunder against every insidious Foe, and to prove a Legacy of Utility, and Public Safety to Posterity: and when I reflect that your Pecuniary Premiums, are bestowed to incite the Artists, Manufacturers, Mechanics, &amp;c. to Competition in their several Professions; and the Mercantile Traders of England, to attempt new Schemes, by which to set our Commerce on a more beneficial Footing; my Mind is at once filled and Captivated with the Grandeur of the Plan, its Apititude for Success, and the Munificence of its Supporters: Honor, and Gain, being undoubtedly the Motives to every sublunary Undertaking. These Reflections on the Laudable Transactions of your Honourable Society, instituted solely for the Public Good, and which has incontestably proved its vast Utility, irresistibly impelled me to dress my Sentiments in poetic Numbers, and to usher them into the World under your Protection. With all due Reverence then for so Respectable a Body, it is to you, my Lords, and Gentlemen, with an humble Confidence, that I address the following Poem; and beg the Liberty I have taken may not give Offence; accept it with Complacency, adn as I have been so happy thus far to give Satisfaction in my Station, and you have hitherto been pleased to favour me with a benign Aspect, (of which I shall ever retain the most grateful Remembrance) be pleased to condescend to bestow a Smile on my Offspring; the Sanction of your Approbation being the Summit of my Ambition, who am, My Lords, and Gentlemen, with the greatest Respect, your much obliged, and most Obedient humble Servant, GEORGE COCKINGS. Tho' long accustom'd in heroic Strain, To sing the Horrors of the rough Campaign; The British bold Huzzas, the Savage Yells, The flaming Havoc of disploding Shells; The mould'ring Walls, the batt'ring Cannons Roar, And Heroes drench'd in Patriotic Alluding to War, an Heroic Poem; from the taking of Minorca by the French, to the Reduction of Manilla by the English: which Poem, has with Corrections and Additions, been carried through four Editions. Gore: Great Britain's fulminating Terrors hurl'd, Thro' ev'ry Quarter of the wond'ring World; Cuba subdu'd, Hispania terrify'd, And Gallia check'd in her all-grasping Pride; Britannia's Triumph, and her Foes Dismay, Where the dread triple Union Englishmen, Caledonians, and Hibernians united. forc'd their Way; Who girded Her with floating Naval War, To gasconading Foes a dreadful Bar: And, like King David's Worthies, round the Throne Of mighty George, form'd a tremendous Zone: Tho' long my Muse with martial Terrors grac'd, Our Troops, and Tars, thro' glorious Conquest trac'd; A gentler Theme, with grateful Ardor fires, Flows in my Verse, and ev'ry Thought inspires. I sing the gen'rous Plan, (the worthy Cause) From whence a noble Elevation rose: The Public Good; the Manufact'rer's Gain; (Who now attempts no useful Scheme in vain) Arts, Commerce, and our Cultivated Lands, The Base whereon the Superstructure stands. Whilst Fate and Time intwin'd, their Courses ran, According to the Providential Plan; As in Rotation Seasons roll'd away, At length appear'd the long predestin'd Day, When gen'rous Thousands shou'd united stand, True Friends to Merit in old Albion's Land; With Influence beneficent shou'd smile On Arts, and Commerce, in Britannia's Isle; To distant Isles, with Hearts benevolent, And North America's wide Continent, Shou'd stretch their Hands, replete with friendly Aid, To planting Schemes, and beneficial Trade. Oh! may th' Americans for ever prove Obedient Children, and deserve the Love Of an indulgent Parent, always pleas'd, Whene'er her Sons of just Complaints are eas'd; Tho' distant far remov'd o'er Oceans wide, May Filial Duty all their Actions guide: May they more tractable, more placid grow, Be wise betimes, and their true Int'rest know; Nor in her Bosom fix, by Tumults rude, The poignant Stings of black Ingratitude! As in domestic Life, we often see, An open unsuspecting Amity, The happy Husband, the contented Wife, And Children, banish Diffidence and Strife; So may the Colonists in Love and Peace, With Britain live, and civil Discord cease; Oh! never may arrive that fatal Day, When She shall cease her soft maternal Sway! 'Tis thought a dread Attempt by bravest Men, To rouze the dormant Lion from his Den! By Providence design'd, for gen'ral good, With Riches bless'd, and Godlike Souls endu'd; Some noble Patriotic Men began, To carry on a meritorious Plan. Soon as the Public their Proceedings knew, They gain'd Esteem, and great their Number grew: The Great, the Generous, the Wise, the Grave, The Skilful, Literate, Humane, and Brave; By willing Thousands ardently incline, To aid and execute the grand Design. Like risng Sol, with morning Splendor crown'd, They first threw chearing Smiles benignly round: Like Him at Noon, dispensing fertile Glow, (Great second Cause of Blessings here below;) Rais'd to meridian Height, on ampler Schemes They shone more strong with vivifying Beams. As He emits a bright enliv'ning Ray, T'illume the World, and never knows Decay: May they with Vigor inexhausted shine, But not like Him, be subject to decline. Behold them now, their noble Plan pursue, Calling each worthy Claimant forth to View; And, as incentives to display their Worth, And shoot their latent Rays of Genius forth, They give large Premiums where they deem them due, And Bounties to th' excelling skilful few; To kindle up an emulating Flame, Worthy the gen'rous Donors of the same. So gentle Show'rs prolifick, from the Sky Descend, and cause the Ground to fructify; Trees, Plants, and Flow'rs, with vegetative Grace, Excrescent rise, t' adorn all Nature's Face. No more our dreaded Naval Warriors ride, With Thunder arm'd, upon the briny Tide, To blast Hispania's Pride, and lay it low, And transfix Gaul in total Overthrow: No more our gallant Sons of Mars engage 'Gainst hostile Odds, inspir'd by freeborn Rage, Great conq'ring George bids Devastation cease, And Heroes Alluding to the great Number of General Officers, and Commanders, both by Sea and Land, now belonging to this Society. cultivate the Arts of Peace: With bounteous Hearts, and Patriotic Zeal, Diffusing Wealth, to serve the Common-weal. So from pacifick Scenes, at War's Alarms, Rome's Leaders rush'd, and dreadful shone in Arms; Their Troops embody'd, full of martial Glow, And gave the Nations round an Overthrow; Return'd in Peace, with their victorious Hands, They cherish'd Arts, and fertiliz'd their Lands. Abroad their promissary Books they sent, Through Britain's Isle, and to the Continent; Which gain'd the Point they ardently desir'd, And Multitudes with Emulation fir'd: The Titled Great confess the noble Flame, For Approbation pant, and thirst for Fame; Wishing to gain the Honorary Prize, They cause whole Groves of This alludes to the Honorary Medals given by the Society, to the Nobility and Gentry, for sowing Acorns, and Spanish Chesnuts: planting Firs, Elms, Weymouth Pines, &amp;c. and to young Gentlemen and Ladies, Sons and Daughters of Peers or Peeresses, in their own Right, of Great Britain or Ireland, for original Designs and Drawings. Oaks and Elms to rise, As Monuments of their great Worth to stand, The future Naval Bulwarks of our Land. Th' ennobled Fair Ones emulously glow, And condescend their pencil'd Works to show; They likewise claim the Honorary Prize, On Fame's bright Summit fix their sparkling Eyes. Whole Ages, Italy in various Parts, Had reign'd sole Mistress in the pencil'd Arts; Her Architects, and her Engravers shone; By wond'rous Skill to distant Nations known; Her Rivals now, Britannia's Sculptors grow, Her Architects with Emulation glow: Now City Domes, and rural Mansions rear Their august Fabricks, and at once appear With Judgment plann'd, design'd with nicest Art, For useful Aptitude in ev'ry Part; With ornamental Pride, they tow'ring stand, Skill structur'd Piles, magnificently grand. Cornelians, The Society from their first Institution, have given great Encouragement to Persons of either Sex, for Designs in Architecture, Plans, and Elevations; Basso Relievos, Statues and Models in Marble, Portland Stone, Paste, Clay, and Wax; Festoons, Designs for useful and ornamental Furniture, Medallions, casting in Bronze, and repairing; engraving Intaglios, and Cameos, on Cornelians, and Onyxes; Steel Dies, Enamelling, Drawings of Human Figures, Flowers, Birds, and Beasts; Patterns for Silk Weavers, and Callico Printers; Engravings, Etchings, Scrapings in Metzotinto, and Drawings of various Kinds, with red or black Pencils, Chalk, Crayons, Pen, Indian Ink, Bister, Black Lead, and Water Colours; Painting in Chlaro Oscuro; Surveys of Counties, and Maps of the same; Painting of History Pieces, Landscapes, and Sea Pieces, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. And there is one Instance of the Society having given a Bounty for Writing, viz. A Gold Pen, to Mr. Andrew Dickie, Jun. of George's Court, near St. John's Gate, For his excellent Penmanship, in his 13th year. Onyxes, and Marbles feel The 'graving Tool, the sharp indenting Steel; On Glass, on Copper, Stones, and diff'rent Dies, Various Designs are form'd, of diff'rent Size, Which by Gradation to Perfection rise. Our Pencil'd Artists Proofs of Genius give, Inform the Charts, and make the Canvas live; On ev'ry Part, Just Symmetry bestow; The dimpled Cheek, adorn'd with rosy Glow; Herculean Brawn, or Neck and Arms like Snow. The sapient Look, Mirth, Anger, Grief, or Fear, Strongly imprinted in the Face appear; In ev'ry Passion Visages are dress'd, And ev'ry Attitude is well express'd. They wisely order ev'ry Candidate To bring his Claim, and Vide, Premium Book. It is required in all Cases where it can be done, that the Matters for which Premiums are offered, be delivered in without Names, or any Intimation to whom they belong; that each particular Thing be marked in what Manner each Claimant thinks fit; he, or she sending with it a Paper sealed up, having on the Outside, a corresponding Mark, and on the Inside, the Claimant's Name and Address. unknown wait his Fate; His private Signature, or Mark, alone, Is all they crave, whereby the Claim is known. Proper Committees, previously ordain'd, Adjudge all Claims, their Approbation gain'd; All may inspect the same; each Claim must be Twice more approv'd in full The invariab. Method of Proceeding, concerning every Thing brought in for a Premium, or Bounty is as follows. The Claimant deposits his or her Performance in the Register's Care, on or before a certain Day, fixed annually in the Premium Books; and on the Wednesday Night following (on which Nights the Society meet, from the second Wednesday in October, to the first Wednesday in July) the Register reports to the Society what Claims he has received; who refer them to the several Committees, to consider the same; and these meet accordingly, and adjudge such Claims. Every Member of the Society may, if he pleases, be a Member of every Committee. Their Adjudication, and all Resolutions are in Succession reported to the Society, at their Meetings on Wednesdays, &amp;c. And if any Sum of Money, Medal, or Pallet, has been adjudged to the Candidates by the Committee, it must be twice reported to the Society, first, for their Approbation of that Resolution, and a second Time for their Confirmation. But if a Negative is put on the Report at first, it then requires no Confirmation. All Models of Machines, Machines at large, Paintings; Drawings, Engravings, &amp;c. until they have been before the Committees, are not subject to a general Inspection: But when once the Committees have considered the Claims, they then may be examined by any of the Members, at a proper Season, as often as they please; and every Thing in the Polite Arts in particular, is placed up in the great Room, where the general Meetings of the Society are held, that every Member may, as often as he enters, have a repeated View, of the same, to enable him the better to resolve, whether he shall approve, or disapprove, the Resolutions of the Committee. And the Candidates, after having brought in their Claims, are excluded the Society's Room, until they are finally determined; under Penalty of forfeiting the Premium, or Bounty. Society; This sets the modest Diffident to view, And Stamps the Mark of Merit where 'tis due. The Letters of such Candidates as fail, They ne'er inspect, nor meddle with the Seal; Unbroke they doom them to devouring Vide Premium Book. No Papers shall be opened but such as shall gain Premiums, all the rest shall be returned, unopened, with the Matters to which they belong, if inquired after by their Marks within two Years; after which Time, if not demanded, they shall be publicly burnt, unopened, at some Meeting of the Society. Flame, And in Oblivion drop the Claimant's Name. And that there may no partial Favour be, They've made and ratify'd a sage Decree; When the Society shall congregate, On Matters of Importance to debate, No Father of a Youth, who claims a Prize, Shall present be Vide Book of Rules and Orders. No Member, who is the Father, or Master, of a Candidate for a Premium, Bounty, or Reward, nor any Person anywise lucratively interested in such Event, shall be of the Committee to which such Matter is referred; nor present in the Society, when it is under Consideration, unless called in, under Penalty of excluding such Child, Scholar, Apprentice, or Servant, from all Title to any such Premium, Bounty, or Reward; notwithstanding a Determination of the Society in its Favour. whene'er they scrutinize; Nor shall a Master in the Room abide, Whilst they the Claims in any Class decide, And measure by the Rule of genuine Truth, The sev'ral Merits of contending Youth: Nor to Committees can they then belong, Lest Love Paternal shou'd direct them wrong; Or partial Prejudice, a Master guide, In Favour of th' Apprentice to decide: Who breaks this Law, his Servant is debarr'd, Or Son, from Premium, Bounty, or Reward, Altho' the whole, with one Consent shou'd deem His Work the prime, deserving great Esteem. The rustic Farmers, drawn by Fame or Gain, Lay by the Spade, and labour with the Brain; Machines they send, and Plans Alluding to the great Encouragement given to every Branch of Agriculture, such as planting Madder, sowing or planting Lucerne, and Burnet: Sowing Carrots, Parsnips, and Parsley, to feed Cattle; raising Apiaries, and preserving the Lives of Bees; cultivating Wheat, Rye, Oats, Barley, Turneps, Sanfoin, Beans, Pease, Tares, or Vetches, &amp;c. and gathering and sowing the Seeds of Meadow Fescue, Meadow Foxtail, Hemp, yellow Oat, common Poa, annual Poa, Vernal, Fine Bent, Sheep's Fescue, crested Dog's Tail, &amp;c. &amp;c. on Plans produce, For Agriculture fit, and gen'ral Use; Hope buoys them up as Candidates to stand, Whilst cultivating of the pregnant Land; The wish'd Reward exhilarates the Mind, Whilst sowing fertile Seeds of ev'ry Kind.

Well pleas'd, the Merchants Plough from Shore to Shore, Tho' Billows roll, and stormy Tempests roar; With chearful Minds, they tempt the raging Main, Impell'd by Love of Fame, and Hopes of Gain; For this they strive their Traffic to procure, The Premium The Society have given great Encouragement for several Years, to the Importation of Pearl-Ash, and Pot-Ash, Bar-Iron, made of the black Sand found in America; Cochineal, Scammony, Nitre, and Cobalt, from North America, the West India Islands, and the Bahama Islands; and to the planting and effectually fencing, securing, and cultivating Vines for Raisins, actually producing the true Malaga Grapes, Vines for Wines, Cinnamon Plants, of the true Cinnamon Tree, which now grows in the Island of Guadaloupe; Spanish Kali, or Glass-wort, and Aloes Plants, within any of the British Colonies, upon the Continent of North America, in the Bahama Islands, and in the West Indies; and for Raw Silk and Silk Cocoons, raised, and produced, in the Provinces of Georgia, and South Carolina, and in the Colonies of Connecticut, Pensylvania, and North Carolina; and bringing Sturgeon to Market, &amp;c. spurs, they know the Promise sure. A Saw Mill rears its elevated Head, With potent transverse Wings of Canvass spread, To catch and use the Winds, whene'er they fly From ev'ry Point, below th' expanded Sky; Or by the flowing Liquid Element, Drawn from the Neighb'ring Thames for that Intent, To urge by Cranks, and the coercive Wheel, Thro' Twenty Cuts, the Fang'd corrosive Steel; By gentle Traction, ev'ry Tree to guide Against the Saws, which shall its Trunk divide: Whilst other Wheels, destin'd for diff'rent Use, Perform their Work, and fresh Supplies produce: They, from th' adjacent Yard, by slow Degrees, Drag up perforce the pond'rous square hewn Trees. This Mill, There is a Mill of this Sort, worked by Wind, erected at Limehouse, built by order of Charles Dingley, Esq; to whom the Society gave a Gold Medal. When I saw it, there were twenty Saws fixed, fit for Work. It is so contrived, that whilst the Cranks work the Saws up and down, with a quick Motion, another Part of the Machinery brings the Beams gently forward, placed and fastened on a sliding Frame; they advance so gradually against the Saws, as to offer no more than is sufficient for them to cut in their Descent; and are never thrust onward so violently, as to impede the Motion, or cause the least Shock in the Machine; the Saws ascending freely, and never descending, but with an effective Stroke, advancing through the Beams with the greatest Regularity, cutting the Planks smoother, and more of an equal Thickness throughout, than when they are sawn by two Men: Consequently, the Planks are sooner fitted for any Purpose, and Carpenters, Joiners, &amp;c. employ less Time, and Labour, in Chipping, and planing them for any Use). In the mean Time, another Movement drags the Beams almost imperceptibly on the Floor of the Saw-mill, from the adjacent Yard, under a Crane, ready fix'd, to lift them into the Frame when wanted; and as the Beams are sawn asunder, they are by the natural Motion of the Frame, sent off on Rollers fixed in the Floor, to the opposite Door of the Mill, and returned in Planks into the Yard, from whence they were so lately dragged in Beams; and altho' each of these Operations are performed by various Movements of the Machine, both slow, and rapid, yet there is such an Aptitude in all its Parts, such a Congruity in its Motions, and so well are the Mechanical Powers exerted, that it performs all its destined Labour with the most minute Exactness. When first this Mill was erected, it worked by Wind; but a numerous Party of Sawyers, as supposed, (and no Doubt many other turbulent People mixed with them,) assembled in a riotous Manner, stripped off the Vanes, and disabled every Movement of the Machine, and damaged it to the amount of several Hundred Pounds. Since which Time, I understand, there is a Channel dug to conduct the Water from the Thames, and all the necessary Apparatus applied for that Mode of Operation. The Society offered a Premium for an Improvement in Saw-mills; and Mr. Stanfield invented this Mill; for which he received a Premium of a Hundred Pounds. The Model he produced may be seen at the Society's Office. whose equal never yet appear'd, By the Proprietor was lately rear'd, To pluck the Profit from each foreign Hand, And make it center Britannia's Land; And wou'd have now repaid with wealth and Fame, The worthy Man who patroniz'd the same; But lo, a Multitude, a Tumult made, Who reap'd th' Advantage of that Branch of Trade; They came with bold premeditated Spleen, And spoil'd each Movement in the grand Machine. Culters are likewise fix'd, with Judgment nice, By operative Whirl the Roots to slice, (With an aperient Quality endu'd;) For Sheep, and Oxen, deem'd salubrious Food. For quick Dispatch, its Parts are form'd so well, None ever yet the same cou'd parallel. Into the Reservoir ten Bushels throw, With such such voracious Speed the Turnips flow Through ev'ry Section of the culter'd Base, The Work's compleated in five Minutes Space The whole Machine's of such a simple Frame, That Children may be trusted with the same: Prov'd, and approv'd; and justly thought to be A Work of Skill, and great Utility: And doubtless, this Machine This is a Machine, invented by Mr. James Edgell, at Frome, Somerset: and much improved by Mr. Wm. Bailey, Register to the Society: (so as to double, or perhaps treble its Utility, and Facility of Operation:) who has contrived it so, as to work it with the largest Part of the Reservoir, or Tub, downward, to lower or raise the Bottom, by Screws, and Indexes, to the 8th Part of an Inch, to slice the Turnips thick or thin at Pleasure: the Culters can be taken out to grind or whet them; and to prevent Friction, he has contrived eight Brass Friction Rollers, on which the Tub revolves. Whereas, in that made by Mr. Edgell; the Culters and Bottom were immoveable; consequently, the Turnips could never vary in Thickness if should be thought necessary; the smallest Part of the Tub was downward; which on Trial plainly proved the Turnips would not evacuate with that Facility as was desired; for, as they pressed downward, from a larger to a smaller Compass, they wedged more closely, and burdened the Tub with a ponderous Load, rendering it much more tiresome for the Person at Work, to thrust that Weight of Turnips round with it. Neither were there any Friction Rollers; but the Weight of the Tub hung chiefly on the Center, at the Spindle, and as it revolved, its Edges would often grate harshly over the Bottom Part, where the Culters were fixed; which impeded the Motion, and lengthened the Time of Operation. But in this, by Mr. Bailey's Contrivance, all Obstructions are removed; and in five or six Minutes Time, two Men can with Ease slice ten Bushels of Turnips. This Machine may be seen at the Society's Office. The Society gave Mr. Bailey a Bounty for his Improvement. will always stand Most efficacious, in Great Britain's Land; Excelling all, in future may be try'd, Unless more Space, more Force, more Culters, are apply'd. With salutary Care in ev'ry Part, And Springs retentive, fix'd with simplest Art, A Crane is form'd t'avert the dashing Fate, When Inadvertence shall accelerate The pond'rous pendent Load, in its Descent, Which drags the Wheel beyond all Government; Its Mode of Operation proves the best, The Skill of Man e'er brought to public Test; When the Wheel rolls beyond a fix'd Degree, Gaining a dangerous Velocity, With equal Force the Bellows ventilates, Unlocks a Spring, which instant operates; A new, and seeming strange Effect succeeds, Celerity th' ungovern'd Wheel impedes: Tho' this to some may seem a Point abstruse, The Weight There is a Crane of this Sort, invented by Mr. Pinchbeck, fixed up at Dice Kay: which, as it works, blows a small Bellows, communicating with an effective Spring, under the Wheel; and whenever the Wheel revolves more rapidly than designed, the Bellows ventilates with equal Force, acting on a Lock Spring, whiich instantly performs its destined Office, and checks the Velocity of the Wheel: at the same Time, by the Operation of that Spring, a Pall, fixed above the Wheel, presses hard down upon it, so that after it is arrived at that Velocity, beyond which it is marked not to go, it scarce makes the fourth Part of a Revolution more, before it stops; and all these Operations are performed in almost an imperceptible manner to the Person at Work; only that he has the agreeable Pleasure, to find the Motion of the Wheel gently cease, and himself remaining unhurt; whereas, the walking Cranes, in general Use, by Neglect, or some sinister Chance, often overpower the Men in the Wheel, (in lowering especially) whirl them headlong round, break Legs, Arms, Ribs, or crush their Heads. But with this Crane no such Misfortune can happen to the most stupid and inactive Person alive; the different Parts of the Crane so co-operating together, that it is not at the Option of the Person in the Wheel to let it run amain. Mr. Pinchbeck obtained the Gold Medal of the Society; and the Model of the Crane, may be seen at the Society's Office. suspended shows its potent Use, And amply proves it skilfully design'd; Pregnant with Life, and Safety to Mankind. On Principles of Skill, (well understood,) With plain intelligible Aptitude, To polish Glass, a new This Machine, (for which the Society gave a Premium of seventy Pounds) was invented and made by Mr. Jeremiah Burrows; and so contrived, as to grind and polish Plate, convex and concave Glass, at once. The Runner, or Polisher, which glides over the Plate, is thrust forward, and retracted, by a Crank, in a Sort of circular Motion, and at Intervals, a Brass Hook, (like a Man's Finger crooked,) named a Trigger, (and fixed on an upright Spindle) acting in Concert with the Rod, which directs the Runner, strikes smartly against the Teeth of the horizontal Spur-wheel, fastened to the Runner; altering the sweeping Motion it made at first, and making it spin round (like a Top); grinding and polishing by that means the Center of the Plate, which, without that Motion, would be in some Measure avoided, or but very ineffectually passed over. The Model of this Machine, (for which Mr. Burrows received twenty Pounds) may be seen at the Society's Office. Machine comes forth, (Whose future Trials may proclaim its Worth;) 'Tis work'd by windy Pow'r, or watry Force, Or by a circumambulating Horse: Two diff'rent Ways the Crank, the Runner guides, As o'er a subject Plate it gently glides; By other Cranks, some Polishers are made At first t' advance, and then turn retrograde; And as they o'er the Spheres, and Basons pass, Polish the convex, and the concave Glass.

He went through the whole Process, in Presence of a Committee, appointed for that Purpose: he declaring the Weight, Name, and Use, of every Material; and performed is so much to the Satisfaction of the Society, that they gave him a Gold Medal, and one Hundred Pounds. And they have now in their Possession, the Process in Manuscript, and several Skins, of both red and yellow, dyed by Mr. Phillippo, in Presence of the Committee, allowed by such as are esteemed good Judges, to equal any foreign Skins, and to excel many imported from abroad. and yellow Leather dye, With Lisbon, Turkey, and Morocco vie: No more shall Foreigners enjoy the Gain, For which, 'till now, Great Britain strove in vain; Th' annual Duty, and the vast Expence, For Leather dy'd, which Strangers carried hence, Shall center here; inrich the Common weal; And Britons shall with native Britons deal! An Acquisition! which from Day to Day Declares their Worth, whilst Manufact'rers say, (With Hearts elate, o'ercharg'd with grateful Glow!) It is to this Society we owe Our warmest Thanks! good Wishes most sincere! For Strangers can no longer interfere With our domestic Trade, as heretofore, And bear our Riches to some distant Shore.

Dr. Stephen Hales, F. R. S. Mr. Nicholas Crispe, Merchant. Charles Lawrence, Esq; Gustavus Brander, Esq; F. R. S. Mr. James Short. F. R. S. and Mr. Messiter, met Mr. William Shipley, a Gentleman, of Northampton, at Rawthmell's Coffee House, in Henrietta Street, Covent Garden, to consult on the Measures proper to be taken, to put his Plan in Execution; from which Day, joined by Thousands more of the Nobility, Gentry, Merchants, &amp;c. they have with indefatigable Assiduity, continued their laudable Undertaking, for the Benefit of the Public, to this present Time. For further Information, vide concise Account of the Rise and Progress of the Society, for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce. Respectable; (and justly fam'd) Below the Sun; from its first Origin, (Excelling all which heretofore have been,) By grand and laudable Designs pursu'd, Hath prov'd a flowing Source of Public Good. In many Branches, Commerce languid grew; Having no certain Method to pursue, No new Efforts the cautious Merchants made, T' assist our Colonies, t' inlarge our Trade; Nor wou'd the Manufact'rers strive t' obtain Green, Yellow, Blue, or Scarlet dy'd in Grain; But with the common Dyes remain'd content; Th' uncertain Prospect of a gainful Vent, Oft crush'd in Embryo the rising Thought, And few Designs were into Practice brought: Some Projects, which obtain'd a natal Day, Faded in early Infancy away, (Like sickly Babes, whose Births are premature, Whose transient Lives but little Time endure.) Thro' all the Sons of Skill a Langour ran, A cold Indiff'rence damp'd each lib'ral Plan: Nor cou'd they into Reputation rise, Wanting some pow'rful Friends to patronize; When lo, for their Encouragement stood forth, Possess'd of gen'rous Patriotic Worth, The Great Supports of lib'ral Arts, who made Successful Efforts for inlarging Trade: Both Arts, and Artists, now began to smile, New Streams of Commerce flow'd to Britain's Isle; With Heart elate, each worthy skilful Man, Beheld the Progress of the rising Plan, Certain of Gain, shou'd any one produce An Instrument, or Plan, for Public Use. So when the Months are past of chearless Gloom, PhÅbus returns, with welcome Blaze t' illume Dark Greenland's Frost-bound Coast, and chase away, The frigid Shades, before his genial Ray: All Nature smiles beneath th' illumin'd Sky, The Mariners, their Oars, and Harpoons ply; Rejoicing in their piscatorial Toil, T' obtain th' elastic Bone, and useful Oyl. O! Godlike Plan of universal Fame! Worthy the Grand Supporters of the same! Which charms the Great, and warms their noble Hearts, T' excell in planting, and the Pencil'd Arts! Which makes our Artists with each other vie, And learned Chemists all their efforts try, To serve our Manufact'rers, and produce The best compounded Colours fit for Use: Which makes the Men of fertile Brains possest, Invent, and prove, and bring to Public Test Machines, in which the Pow'rs mechanic lie; (That Man for Strength may with Behemoth vie;) In which the Wit of Man's at large display'd, In their dispatchful Work, and potent Aid: Which makes the Farmers emulously glow, By well-approv'd Experiments to know Such Modes of Culture, as will meliorate The worst of Land, and much improve th' Estate; Will render Arable the stubborn Soil, And will facilitate each rural Toil: Which stimulates (on Fame or Gain intent,) The thrifty, curious, and intelligent, Without Lacteal Vide Premium Book. The Society have offered this Year a Premium; to the Person who shall deliver to the Society an Account of the best Method of rearing Black Cattle without Milk, verified by Experiments. For the best Account of the most profitable Method of rearing and fattening Hogs, verified by Experiments. And for the best Account of the most profitable Method of hatching Fowls of every Kind; including Ducks, Geese, and Turkeys, by artificial Heat, or otherways, rearing them, and fattening them for the Market; verified by Experiments. Nutriment to feed For Food, or Work, the Quadrupeded Breed: To help Dame Nature in her brittle Cells, And bring the Feather'd Bipeds from the Shells: To rear and fatten Swine, they may produce On an Emergency for Public Use, Supplies of necessary Food, for those, Who launch our naval Thunder 'gainst our Foes. Which animates th' advent'rous trading Man, (T' extend more wide his Mercatorial Plan,) To bring the useful Articles of Trade, From British Colonies, by British Subjects made. A Plan, which teaches not to kill, There has been great Encouragement given by the Society for preserving the Lives of Bees: for as heretofore, the cruel, and (I may add) unthrifty Method of such as raised Apiaries, was to destroy these laborious and useful Creatures, whenever they took the Wax and Honey from the Hive: the Possessors of several Stocks, or Hives of Bees, have now adopted a more lucrative Method, incited thereto by the Premiums offered, viz. Instead of totally destroying the busy Inhabitants of the Hive, which they intend to plunder, they turn it Bottom up, and, with a crooked Knife, make a Section through such Parts of the Combs as they judge convenient; by which Means they only destroy some few of the Embryos, or Maggots, well advanced in their Maturity: they then replace the Hive in its former Position; and the Bees immediately, (like well disciplined, brave, and indefatigable Troops, striving to repair a mural Breach which the Battery of an Enemy has made,) with all the Dispatch, and Assiduity, they are capable of, strive to repair the Devastation of the Knife. Another Method practised by the Raisers of Apiaries, is to place one Box or Hive, on the Top of another; the under Hive, having an Aperture in the Top, through which they drive the Bees into the upper empty Hive, prepared for them; then close that Hole, take the under Hive away, and place the whole transplanted Colony in its Room; who, never being idle, set to work immediately, to build Cells, in which their fertile Queen may deposit her numerous Eggs, and to serve as Store-houses, wherein to lay up the Fruits of their Labour against the Winter. By either of these Methods, their generative Progress is not much retarded; a fresh Supply of Nutriment is laid up for their Young; they renew their Race several Times, by Swarms sent forth to disincumber the Hive; the Possessor reaps the Gain of their Industry, as a Reward for his Clemency in sparing their Lives; and the audable Design of the Society is answered, in their Preservation, and the greater Increase of Wax, and Honey. but drive An injur'd Nation, from each plunder'd Hive, With this Precaution, (taking proper Care) For their Reception timely to prepare A vacant Hive, with pleasing Herbs rubb'd o'er, In which to treasure their Mellifluous Store; And on the Tripod of supporting Wood, (The Base whereon their Straw built City stood,) Replacing, with the Regent Mother Bee, Th' industrious faithful subject Colony; Who will, where'er their Royal Mistress dwells, Erect their waxen Geometric Cells; Will labour hard their Fears to dissipate, To save their Young, avert the dreaded Fate; And carry on the Bus'ness of the State. How many wander'd from the Path of Fame, Unknown, unnotic'd, and without a Name; Struggling with Efforts vain, yet never rose, Wanting the Sanction of deserv'd Applause; (Like callow Birds, which hop from Spray to Spray, Yet cannot mount aloft, and wing their Way,) Till THEY arose, (and set their Genius free, To soar above the Dread of Penury!) From low Obscurity to call them forth, And make the World acquainted with their Worth! So when a Traveller benighted Strays, Through the wild Forest's unfrequented Ways, At ev'ry Step, a Precipice he fears, Trembling with dread the savage Howlings hears: He's view'd by all the bright Ãthereal Race, (Whilst Love, and Pity, glow in ev'ry Face;) Some amicable Spirit of the Sky, Expands his Wings and waits Command to fly; Th' Assent obtain'd, He wings his rapid Way, And chears his Soul with Hope's enliv'ning Ray; By secret Impulse, makes Him deviate From liquid Dangers, Bogs, and headlong Fate; By the same Pow'r, turns every Beast of Prey, Far from the Heav'n protected Trav'ler's, Way; 'Till welcome Dawn, to guide his Steps appears Dispels his Doubts, and banishes his Fears; With Gratitude, and Joy, his Course he bends From Haunts of Beasts, to mingle with his Friends. With all who feel a just and grateful Sense Of this Society's Benevolence, My Heart accords; for past and present Good, Replete with Sentiments of Gratitude: Which will a lasting chearful Impulse give, To serve my Benefactors whilst I live: My prime grand Object, and my chiefest Aim, Shall be to make my future Deeds proclaim My Veneration and Respect profest; By all allow'd a sure and proper Test.
