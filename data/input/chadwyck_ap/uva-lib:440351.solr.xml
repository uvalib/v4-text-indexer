      <field name="fulltext">[The Conquest of Canada] To the PUBLIC. Although the undertaking is great and arduous, for a person in my situation of life, unassisted, to dare attempt the sole composition of a Tragedy; yet I was incited to the task, by ruminating on a rapid, and almost uninterrupted series of successes, in 1759, and the great and ever memorable year of 1758 &amp;c. the glorious effects of the amicable and happy union, which subsisted between our gallant troops, and intrepid tars; who, with a true spirit of martial bravery and emulation (never to be outdone, or equalled again but by themselves) baffled, bore down, and triumphed over all hostile opposition, in every quarter of the globe, both by land and sea, which the united power and policy of France, Spain, and their civilized and barbarous friends and allies, could possibly exert. At first, I thought to have made one entire Dramatic Piece of it, through the whole course of the war, so gloriously successful to Great-Britain, beyond all parallel; rendering her terrible to the nations around, and so effectually humbling to France; totally destroying her trade, baffling, and overcoming all her armaments, both by land and sea; that at length she could be scarcely said to make any effort, deserving the name of resistance. Had I proceeded according to the above design, I then intended to have named the piece, The Matchless Æra. But when I came to reflect upon the transactions in North-America; the great and and hazardous siege of Quebec, seemed to stand foremost, and claim my chief attention: For there, near 12,000 veteran French, joined by Canadians, and many savage tribes, lay intrenched at the only spot attackable; commanded by a bold, experienced, enterprising, (and hitherto) fortunate General, Monsieur de Montcalm, and many other gallant leaders, with all the advantages of art and nature on their side, to render their situation as formidable as possible, to the most intrepid foe: Yet about 8000 of Britannia's troops, assisted by her matchless tars, led and animated by Wolfe, Saunders, Monckton, Townshend, Holmes, Howe, Murray, Fraser, and many other leaders brave, laid siege to that strong and important fortress and capital; carried on their several attacks, with the loss of about 3000 killed and wounded; and at last, on the famed height of Abraham, with about 5000 men, gained a complete victory, and chased in a total rout, to the garrison walle, French, Indians, and Canadians! The glorious consequence of which was, the surrender of the city and garrison of Quebec; and soon after all Canada submitted to the victorious troops of Great-Britain. So great, and many, were the remarkable transactions of that siege, and so much worth, and bravery, was there displayed, I thought there needed no additional aid of wellwrought fiction, or fulsome adulation, to render it worthy of a dramatic representation. I therefore resolved to send it forth into the world, dressed in the amiable garb of impartial verity, under the title of The Conquest of Canada: Or, The Siege of Quebec; and designed to adhere strictly to historical facts, as much as a dramatic performance would allow. Not being conversant with the stage, and consequently not well acquainted with the rules of the drama, as a dramatic writer, perhaps I may have greatly erred in the composition of the play, as to time, place, circumstances, and, many other minute particulars, which the most judicious and nice critics in ancient literature, may think a work of this kind deserves. But I write a historical tragedy; and as a historian, have endeavoured to display, in the different scenes, a representation of real and genuine facts, great in themselves, as any in our times, and amply worthy of being registered in the annals of fame, as rival actions of those patriotic deeds, of the so much admired ancient Greeks and Romans! We read with pleasure and admiration the siege of Calasi, Aquileia, Addison's Cato, and the gallant defence of the Thermopylæan pass; where the regal patriot Leonidas, with his few chosen, and ever renowned Spartants, Thebans, and Thespians, nobly fell, in the defence of their country, its privileges and laws. Yet at these places, none but Gauls, Greeks, and Romans, were the worthy warriors, with whom we are so pleas'd. Whilst Greece, and Rome, boast their patriotic warrior, slain in defence of their laws and liberties, and France trumpets forth the noble and praise-worthy resolutions of her Burghers at Calais, who only offered themselves at the mercy of the British royal victor, to save their countrymen, friends, and relations from ruin; yet providentially escaped the threatened fate, and lived very justly revered by their grateful country. I say, whilst all these states seem emulously to vie with each other for the greatest honour in the records of patriotism, shall we be mute, nor give deserved applause to these gallant countrymen of ours, who to save wives, children, lands and laws, fought, bled, and died in the glorious cause of freedom, and the service of their country, at Louisbourg, Quebec, &amp;c. and shall we not enjoy a more exquisite pleasure, when we read the scenes which display the victorious intrepidity, warlike worth, or glorious deaths, not of Greeks, Gauls, and Romans, (as oft has happened, against rude, barbarous, or effeminated troops, or at best if disciplined; not trained and armed like themselves, for offensive and defensive war;) but of Englishmen, Caledonians, and Hibernians, who engaged against superior numbers, like themselves civilized; who had a constant supply from large magazines of all the destructive implements of death; trained, armed, and equally disciplined in the arts of war, and well skilled in every manœuvre of the field; and were immured in strong fortresses, or advantageously intrenched, yet these they would often attack, and fired by patriotic ardor, (with an impetuosity not to be withstood) would rout from trench to trench, chase from field to field; and drive from garrison to garrison, these more numerous, well disciplined, and veteran forces, till all retreat was cut off, and submission became the only resource they had left for safety: Whilst the nations around trembled at Britannia's name, and dreaded the united thunder-storm of her terrene and naval warriors. 1766 Geo.

Then you resolve to leave me? Wolfe. Madam, I do.— Our sage and patriot Minister on me Has fix'd his choice, to stand prime candidate For honour in this glorious enterprise; Our martial King, (well pleas'd) gave his royal Assent to that choice, and glory calls me forth. Sophr. Have not those British troops you've train'd to war, Giv'n ample proof of skill and courage, in The day of battle, and by their conduct, Reflected honour on you their former Chief? And Louisbourg bore dreadful witness, To your impetuous and unbated Fury in the siege: Why then shou'd future Fame ingross th' attention of your soul? Wolfe. Those troops you're pleas'd to hint at; when they fought, Were headed by another: Besides, it Is too scant an honour to shine by their Reflection, and borrow glory from those Gallant soldiers deeds:— At Louisbourg, I was not first in the Command, and cannot claim the foremost rank Of fame: Then I only took a gentle Sip of honour's cup, but was with-held by Destiny from draining it, which like true Lovers kisses, (still raising new desires,) Has let my thirsty soul in flame for more! And being chief, I long to swallow down Whole draughts of glory; like Philip's conq'ring Son, I'd bathe in seas of danger, brave all The horrors of the fight, and with eyes of Warlike jealousy, stand on the watch for Some advent'rous deeds, worthy of the King, My country, and a British General. Sophr. Forgive, my son, a mother's fears: I wou'd not check you in your full career To glory, nor from my country's service Willingly detain a brave and useful leader.— My heart distends with secret pride, and joy Maternal fills my bosom, whene'er I Call you son! But oh! (sad thought!) I much fear Th' impetuous fury of your soul, will Greatly spur you on to wounds, and dangers, And perhaps to death:— Oh! think what I must then endure!— You have already gain'd great honour;— Be sedately brave, and cautiously Intrepid;—repress the furious ardor Of your mind;—be content;—and— Wolfe. Madam, I guess your speech; You'd say, and stay at home.—That cannot be. Shall I, with a dull tortoise pace, set out In honour's path, and at the slightest touch Of danger, like him, skrink back into my Shell? No!—let these resemblances of men, Who outside wear the martial garb, and seem To look the lion in their surly port, Yet bear within a tim'rous deer-like soul: Let such as these, (if such there are in life) In grov'ling sloth, receive their country's pay, Tremble at the thought of action! and when The foe is nam'd, start! look aghast! and grow pale! Th' animating trumpets! th' artillery's roar! My soldiers steady manly looks! the drums! The fifes! and all the grand apparatus For the war, have charms for me to rouze my Faculties, and kindle up an ardor In my soul, beyond what speech can paint! or Any but a warrior feel!— Madam I am resolv'd. Sophr. Since you will go, come to my arms and take A mother's blessing. [Embracing him. Hear me all sufficient Heav'n! inspire, and Guard my son: Let him not seek danger for The sake of danger, nor feel a coward's Pang: Oh! give him victory, and to my Arms, again restore the darling of my age. Now, go my son:—Deserve a Briton's name;— With honour come;—or,—oh my fault'ring tongue! I would say, come not at all;—and yet a Mother's fond anxiety, would make me Say, at any rate return.— Wolfe. Be pleas'd to wait with patience this event; And during this intended siege I hope All things will so concur together, that I shall at last return with life and honour. Sophr. Oh! direful thought! in battle fell'd you may Be trodden under foot, in the purple Stream, flowing from the fountain of your heart: [Weeps. Perhaps whilst bleeding, and ebbing life but Tardily retreats from the weak shatter'd Mansion, you may fall a prey to some fell Savages, who stand insulting o'er Departing life, and add a racking pang! (A pang!) more exquisite to manly souls, Than glorious death cou'd e'er inflict. [Leans on his breast, as if to faint, but recovers again. Wolfe. Madam, I beg you'd calm the inquietudes Of your soul, and grieve no more at thoughts of What may come to pass, but has no certainty: Yet be assur'd, whate'er shall hap, I'll bring No stain upon my family, or my Country; what wounds I gain, shall be by me Most honestly receiv'd, against my front Shall ev'ry terror fly, and I will face The hostile thundring storm of death, and if I fall, I'll fall at least with honour. Sophr. At length my resolution, and a warm Regard for Britain's welfare, seem to stand Almost on an equality with my Maternal fondness; and now the intestine Conflict in my soul partly subsides:— Oh! poignant thought of deep distress! shall I E'er spur my son to battle, and to death! And yet, oh! keener thought of woe! shall I Receive a dastard to my arms! and hear My country curse th' inglorious war he made! Forbid it Heav'n!—avert it, oh—my son,— Another dear embrace before we part; [Embracing him, weeping. Perhaps to meet no more below.— Oh! cruel war!—oh! dear bought fame!— Oh! wou'd'st thou court a gentler mistress than Rough honour!—but 'tis the will of fate, and thine. Then go;—thy King commands; thy country calls; —Forget not thyself!—and guess the rest: Wolfe. You'd say return victorious;—at least come Home with honour;—bring home no dastard looks To me:—Your fears are just;—your caution's good; I'll not forget myself.—When in danger Most extreme, I'll recollect the glory Of my King, Britannia's weal, and what should Be to ev'ry soldier dearer than his Life, my own honour is at stake; with this Threefold recollection back'd, what horrid Shape can death put on, to chill the ardor Of my heart, or shock my steady soul? Who would not fight in mighty George's cause, When mothers pray, and sigh a fond applause! Madam, Farewell,— [Exit Wolfe. Sopronia sola. Oh! 'tis hard indeed to root affection Up in outward show, and bid a son go fight! None but a mother knows the bitter task, To quell the tender yearnings of a parent's Soul, and for a son so full of manly Fortitude, and patriotic worth! If he returns victorious, I'm bless'd indeed! If he falls, with him fall all my fond hopes, And I am gloriously unhappy!— [Exit Sophr. SCENE II. Sophia's Parlour. Wolfe solus. Now comes the time to prove my resolution; I'm wrapp'd in am'rous doubt, mix'd with a sweet Perplexity! Love's fierce desires inform My glowing soul! the wish'd for malady With ardent tremor rolls thro' ev'ry vital part! The sages surely have mistook, And Heav'n ordain'd that darling sex, to rule Superior here below: How facile to Subdue they find our mighty boasted reason! In ev'ry glance a soft inchantment's couch'd! And their pretty prattling tongues are hung with An harmonious magic!— How potent when array'd with each killing charm, Is all conq'ring woman!— The downy fetters which she throws around The heart, when first laid on scarce felt; soon prove More hard to break than links of stubborn steel, Be firm my heart; and let me not be drawn Like Anthony, by fond desires, to quit Bright honour's chace; but let me run resolv'd The race of glory.— Now two great passions struggle for command; 'Twixt love, and glory, I suspended stand: Born down by beauty's blaze, my soul gives way, Like mollient wax, in sol's refulgent ray; At glory's call, again abdur'd I grow, And Cupid flees before the martial glow; Yet when return'd, I shall my charmer meet, And lay new laurels gain'd at Sophia's feet; Bright Sophia then shall here unrivall'd reign, And with one smile, shall overpay my pain. [Exit. SCENE III. Scene draws, and discovers Wolfe and Sophia, sitting. Soph. Then I find, Sir, you prefer the noise and Danger of the battle, and fatigues of A foreign campaign, to the quiet enjoyment Of your friends in safety in your native Country? Wolfe. Madam, you already know my sentiments; Our Monarch, good, and gracious as he is, In me reposes special trust; in me, Great-Britain, and her Patriots confide; With joy, my faithful sturdy soldiers wait To hail me General: No sluggish thought Shall ever harbour in my breast, to cause Me to recede from my firm purpose. Soph. I think not of altering your purpose For the war; perhaps that would be a task Too hard:— And yet methinks we might expect a more Lasting pleasure than we yet have had, in Your company, and friendship, that we might Add more esteem and heap new favours on The man, whose actions have rendered him so Deserving. Wolfe. By honour spur'd and an emulating Thirst for fame, to stand inroll'd 'mongst Britain's Worthies, I re-assume the martial toil.— Whilst all Britannia's sons, are rous'd to arms, And burn with gen'rous ardor to revenge, And redress their country's wrongs; shall I sit Tamely down, and dose a life of sloth away? [Wolfe and Sophia rising. Soph. Such Sir, has ever been your active course Of life, and such your shining deeds, they spread A blaze of glory round, that pale envy's Self must keep a silent distance, and with Mute indignation gnaw the galling chain. You're scarce return'd from Louisbourg, and yet Seem longing for another undertaking. Has nothing charms to stay you longer here? Wolfe aside.] Such charms!—the fair! the kind enquirer has! I scarce know how to flee their magic pow'r! [To her.] Tho' you are unconscious of the blaze of Charms with which you're bless'd, yet I confess their Pow'r;—[languishing] and in yourself alone,—[sighing] I'd seek the Summit of terrestrial joy: But now my Honour is at stake; that like a rich gem Inestimable, has ever been and Still shall be the prime treasure of my soul: England has many foes; I'll therefore strive To merit more esteem by future deeds. Soph. Whene'er new actions shall bespeak more Worth, and add new honours to those you have Already gain'd, I never shall be wanting In my just applause, nor fail to crown with The deserv'd esteem, a man so worthy: Your warlike deeds, and all your brave exploits, We'll oft recount, and dwell with pleasure on The wond'rous tale!— Proceed as you've begun, and such rewards, With me, and mine, (replete with friendly joy) Your grateful country will bestow, as might Satisfy the utmost bounds of your ambition. [Wolfe assuming a more sprightly and pleasant air. All my ambition, Madam, centers in Yourself: And I esteem my honour well Insur'd, and cannot doubt success, since while I range the savage continent, maiden Innocence, will plead with kneeling eloquence, My cause with Heav'n.— Active as the rising flame, my gladden'd Soul transported! soars upon the wings of Exultation, sweetly reflecting on My future bliss! Soph. Your happiness I measure by the soft Transports I enjoy: now shou'd I feel a Sweet foretaste of mutual delight, did Not honour rival me, (at present) in Your esteem, and smile triumphant in the Conquest she has made, mixing some jealous Anxious pangs with that overflowing flood of joy, Wolfe. That rival mistress shortly must depart, And you remain sole charmer of my soul. No greater joy has fate in store! since you Are pleas'd to give me but a distant hope! To bid me conquer! and make my fame your Theme! and promise me you'll smile applause on Each praise-worthy deed!— Sophia. Long would I fain detain you here, and with Persuasive kindness, strive to beguile your Resolution for this foreign war: But Being honour'd with the royal confidence, And public approbation, and drawn by Glory's animating call, I cannot Wish you to relinquish that high claim of Honour which fires your soul; may your guardian Angel go forth with you to the battle; Avert each rapid bullet as it flies; And ward far off the mortal steel: and oh! May you return with vict'ry crown'd, to bless My longing eyes again.— Wolfe. Dear as you've ever been, this last kind speech Makes you shine more amiable; rend'ring You dearer to my soul, by sympathy Of sentiment.—Madam, I take my leave:—[Embracing her tenderly. [Embracing her a second time. Dear! dear maid! Farewell! Exit Wolfe, Sophia attends him to the door; looking eagerly after him. Sophia sola. He's gone! [Weeps.] and yet he seem'd as if about To stay; and often backward cast such tender Speaking looks of sweet distress, as if his Soul had been upon the wing to quit its Body, and fix its habitation here. The thrilling eloquence so charm'd my senses, I thought my soul about to blend with his; And such an unwonted pungent pang he Gave my heart at parting! as if he there Till then had grown; and thence was dragg'd by some Superior force! [Exit Sophia. SCENE IV. Portsmouth Point, or Beach. Enter a Land and Sea Officer meeting. Sea Off. Good morrow t'ye, Sir: What news is stirring? Land Off. News, my friend? I can tell thee such a piece Of news, as once to hear it would make a Gouty sinner leap for joy! a soldier Leave his wench! a sailor leave his flip! and All France to tremble! Sea Off. Then I'm sure 'tis warlike news: Some new expedition, some siege, I hope; For nought like that can make Britannia's sons Of thunder leaver their wenches and their flip; And nothing better suited to make the Monsieurs tremble. Land Off. A siege it is: Our good old King has doom'd Quebec to fail; Pitt longs to have an ampler vengeance; And Wolfe is nominated General: Wolfe! at whose name the French are thunderstruck! Th' intrepid Monckton is the second, and The gallant Townshend third in the command: Their presence, (as the sun gives heat and day Light) can warm each soldier's heart for battle, And spur an animated army on Full speed to glory. Sea Off. But who's the Admiral for this design? I want to thrash their jackets once again. Land Off. I hear it is the gallant Saunders, and Holmes the second in command. Sea Off. Just as I wish'd:—I sail with Saunders; He is a brave commander, and will soon Give a convincing proof of it, on the Frenchmen to their cost.— I think now England has pretty well paid Herself for the loss of St. Philip's.— Land Off. I think so too:—Yet between you and I, They met no essenc'd Jack-a-Dandys there; The brave old Blakeney and his worthy few Of vet'ran troops, and newly landed tars, Were fierce as lions, and fearless as Job's War horse. Sea Off. There they got a sample of what they might Expect, and since have had a full measure Of vengeance pour'd out upon them. Land Off. And more shall have, or I'm mistaken. Sea Off. With what tumultuous joy, the burning scene We saw! when sixscore ships, with ware-houses, And stores were wrapp'd in one fierce British blaze, Whilst with accustom'd shouts we frighten'd France! Meanwhile, St. Maloes's thunder, silent as The grave growl'd not the least defiance, as If well pleas'd with Marlb'rough's vengeance. Land Off. Their troubles, fears, and losses, only then began. Sea Off. Right brother Officer! 'twas glorious sport! Where princely Edward fought on hostile ground; And where the gallant Howe, and Bligh engag'd; (And once more bore destruction to proud France:) To see at Edward's feet, their stubborn ramparts Kiss the ground! their empty plunder'd royal Stores, and magazines, in flames! and then to Crown the scene, to see the subterraneous Ruin rise, and all disjointed fling their Cherbourg's costly bason in the air! Land Off. These were sights worth seeing! Sea Off. Then to sail along their coasts, with Osborne, Gard'ner, Hawke, and Howe; to take th'Orphee and The more dreadful Foudroyant! (changing the Expedition of Du Quesne, to Britain's Shore, instead of Louisbourg,) driving their Fleets into neutral harbours locking up Their ports, and stagnating all their trade! then To go with Rodney, and overturn all Their flat bottom'd war! to break their fine spun Project of invasion, and ramm their schemes Down their throats wrapp'd up in smoke! Land Off. This sport was chiefly on the element, Where you sailors were the best actors, and We soldiers had but little hand in it: But we handled them a little roughly At Senegal, and many other places Of the torrid zone; where, with resistless Fury, Watson, Sayer, Barrington, Marsh, Mason, Moore, and Draper, with other bold Commanders, swept all before them, in a Deluge of repeated victories! Sea Off. And amongst the rest, Keppel in a storm Of thunder, beat Goree to the ground. And as if the French hadn't had loss and griefs Enough, how bold Boscawen maul'd De Clue! Scatt'ring his fleet, and driving some on shore, Taking, burning, sinking, at his pleasure! And then it was, the French ocean, by the Hardy De la Clue commanded, tumbled On the shore to shun Boscawen's rage, and Was lick'd up by English flame! Land Off. And still to add to England's glory, and Their shame, to seize upon Cape Breton's Isle. Oh! hadst thou seen that siege! it wou'd have serv'd Thee for an age to come, whilst passing round The flowing cann, to tell thy friends the tale. Thus wou'dst thou say, invelop'd in a cloud Of sulph'rous smoke, which broke in thunder from The British fleet; with British thunderbolts well Stor'd and thro' a mortal show'r of shot, and Shells, and leaden deaths, from cannons, mortars, And French entrenchments sent Amberst, and Wolfe, Sedately warm'd, and most serenely bold, (As if their presence victory insur'd,) With Britain's troops, plung'd into the flood, to Ravish mighty fate! to bid destruction Defiance! and outface the grim king of terrors! Sea Off. There England's troops and tars were nobly try'd; And there the Frenchmen learnt, how terrible We are, when rushing on in dread union, Thirsting after fame, and eager for the battle. Land Off. The disposition for the siege was a Most glorious toil: each soldier, and each Sailor, strove t'outdo each other:— Our cannons, mortars, cohorns, bellow'd loud Against the place; defiance thundr'd from The forts of France; that like mount Ætna, and Vesuvius, in convulsive rage, both parties fought. Full against the town, and grand fort, Amherst Bent his fury; whilst Wolfe attack'd, and sunk, And burnt their ships, o'erturn'd the thunder of Their island fort, and from the base tore up Their ramparts! battering the front before His storm headlong into the sea! and now 'Gainst Dauphin gate, his brazen engines yawn'd, Pregnant with destruction, Drucour, amaz'd! For parley call'd, and gave up Louisbourg. Sea Off. 'Twas high time to give it up; else Hardy, And Boscawen, wou'd soon have made the place Too hot for him, and from their double tiers Have sent him such a surly summons, as Wou'd have puzzled him, and nonplus'd all his Troops e'er they could recollect themselves, to Remit them a reply of equal weight. But my worthy friend, you forgot, or else Omitted one great transaction of the Siege; the ships, the ships, the boats took. Land Off. Right: I had forgot indeed: One night the fleet's boats, under the command Of the bold Balfour, and Laforey, row'd Into the harbour of Louisbourg, and Amidst all the terrors of a gloomy night, In an unfriendly port, thro' a random Storm of death, and under cover of their Garrison, they bravely boarded, and took Possession of two men of war at once, A sixty, and a seventy-four gun ship! They burnt Le Prudent, (which stuck a ground,) And from the harbour tow'd Le Bienfaisant Away! Sea Off. We generally go through with what we Take in hand. Land Off. A few words more before we part. I wonder what possess'd the French nation To kindle up afresh the flames of war, Or after kindling them, still to carry On the war, whilst Old England own'd a Pitt; And for their terror on the land, a Wolfe, An Amherst, and a Granby, a Johnson, Williams, Foy, Phillips, Drummond, and Macbean; A Frazer, Clive, Coote, a Townshend, Elliot, And a Murray: With such a num'rous list Besides of worthies, in the triple union Of England, that when all fam'd Homer's boasted Warriors are compar'd with them, they seem a Few, each of them an equal to Hector, And a rival to fierce Mars. Sea Off. And for their scourge at sea, a Hawke, a Howe, A Saunders, a Pocock, and Boscawen; A Gilchrist, Clements, Elliot, and Logie; A Keppel, Rodney, Lockhart, Tyrrel, Forrest; A Hardy, Holmes, a Langdon, and a Suckling: With hundreds more, all hardy tars and good Commanders brave, each of whose names wou'd sound In a 'Frenchman's ears, like to a clap of Thunder! [Going off.] We've whole fleets mann'd with brave fellows. [Exit. Land Off. [Going off] Whole reg'ments of heroes! [Exit. SCENE V. Scene draws, and discovers Jack Ratlin, Ned Forecastle and Jemmy Chaunter, with several other sailors, in a drinking house. Ned taking up the mug, or bowl. Come here's success to Admiral Saunders, And Admiral Holmes, and to our own ship's crew; They're a parcel of as good fellows as Ever went between stem and scorn of a ship. [Drinks. Jack Ratl. But now I think on't, give us that new song, Jemmy Chaunter, that you got t'other day: I like it Ned. [Turning to Ned. Ned. Is it about fighting? If 'tis, let's have it. [Jemmy rising.] With all my heart, brothers. [All rising. I. Come on my brave tars! let's away to the wars, To the siege of Quebec let's advance; Our anchor's a trip, let's away to the ship, And bellow defiance to France. Brave boys, &amp;c. II. We'll spread ev'ry sail, with a prosperous gale, Thro' the kingdom of Neptune we'll roam! If we meet the French fleet, in thunder we'll greet, We'll take 'em, or drive them all home. Brave boys, &amp;c. III. If they dare to engage, and meet British rage, We'll bear closely down to the fight; Yard arm and yard arm, their jackets well warm, For that is the Britons delight. Brave boys, &amp;c. IV. When the fight is begun, lest away they shou'd run, Our grapples shall hold us together; 'Tis a sport they don't like, we'll soon make 'em strike, And straightway bear down to another. Brave boys, &amp;c. V. We'll range to 'em close, and a terrible dose, For a sample, we'll send the Monsieurs; If the fight does not end, then another we'll send, From both of our thundering tiers! Brave boys, &amp;c. VI. On their quarters we'll board, with pike, pistols and sword; Hawke like we will pounce on our prey; We'll make them our own, and their flags we'll haul down, For George shall be Sovereign at sea. Brave boys, &amp;c. VII. When our thunder shall break, o'er the walls of Quebec, Monsieurs! your strong ramparts shan't save ye; Your heads shall all droop! and your walls shall all drop! When shook by the sons of the navy! Brave boys, &amp;c. VIII. Tho' your tow'rs shou'd arise, o'er the clouds in the skies, Let Saunders but say that we must Pluck 'em up to the base, each fortress we'll raze, And trample your pride in the dust! Brave boys, &amp;c. IX. When we tars shall unite, with our troops in the fight, And emulous jealousy calls. As hurricanes sweep thro' the land and the deep, We'll sweep to destruction the Gauls! Brave boys, &amp;c. Exeunt omnes, huzzaing. The END of ACT I. ACT II. POINT LEVI, OPPOSITE QUEBEC, In AMERICA. SCENE I. Wolfe, Leonatus and Britannicus, in a Tent. Wolfe. Good Providence our purpose seems to back; Thus far with little loss advanc'd, we may Expect success will crown the enterprize: Join'd by provincial troops both, Orleans, And Point Levi, well secur'd; and as our Fleet is anchor'd in the river; and forms A floating bulwark 'twixt this and Montmorenci; We've little need to fear a visit from Our enemies: Our next attempt must be To bring them to a battle. Leonatus. And that a glorious toilsome battle too!— Their troops out-number ours by far: Strong are Their entrenchments, brave and experienced Are their Generals, and other leaders: A rough steep ascent leads to their trenches! Rugged, fierce, and cruel are their savages: Regulars and veterans are their soldiers: But ours I know will stand the test, we'll have A mortal struggle with them! and tug in Earnest for the conquest! Britannicus. I hope the wish'd for day is near at hand, When we shall meet them in the field, and put To noble proof, their boasted veteran Thousands, and all their scalping bands, and prove We have Britannia's welfare at our hearts! Wolfe. These resolutions I approve. We came here to purchase warlike honour; To fight and conquer, or like Britons fall; And not to tell the dastard tale at home, We durst not see our foes. [Enter a Serjeant, addressing himself to Wolfe.] Sir, the officer and drum are both return'd, you sent To summon the town and garrison of Quebec. Wolfe. Let him enter. [Exit Serjeant, enter Officer.] Wolfe, to the Officer. What answer give they to our summons? Officer. When I, according to your orders, Sir, In George the Second's name, demanded both The town and garrison, the Governor And General, with others, seem'd to sneer At my demand; bid me advise you to Return, and ask our Royal Master for The keys, and a few more troops t'escort Them to Quebec: Their situation, they Likewise say, is strong and lofty; they've near Twelve thousand regulars entrench'd, and at The only spot attackable, commanded By their bold, enterprising, fortunate General, Montcalm; and in their wonted Gasconading boast, you cannot force the Bars of their gates, not daring t'approach near Enough, since Monsieur Montcalm occupies Th' adjacent plain, and around their ramparts, Forms an impenetrable living outwark! Too dreadful for your near advances! and Before whose war you cannot stand, if he Chose t'evacuate the trenches, and give You battle! Wolfe. Say they this? They shall e'er long, hear Britain's thunder roll! And feel the bolt! Our troops and tars shall roar Them such a concert, as shall shake the strong And lofty base of their Quebec! and let Montcalm take heed, or like hungry lions, Foaming for their prey, we'll overleap his Breastworks, and drag his Frenchmen by the heels, Out from underground, where like moles they seem To have buried themselves, fearing to look At us, as if like basilisks, our eyes wou'd kill! I cannot boast twelve thousand regulars, With many savage scalping bands; my troops Will scarcely to eight thousand rise; but these Are gallant fellows; and I have seen them Try'd: They're Britain's troops; and from Old England, Caledonia and Hibernia drawn. Britannicus. They're the descendants of those very men, Who fought at Cressy, Poictiers, Blenheim! And often march'd victorious thro' the heart Of France! and surely feel the ardor of Their brave ancestors! But more than this, in The last war, several gain'd great honour, And many, we know, both officers, and Soldiers at the late siege of Louisbourg, Signaliz'd themselves. Leonatus to Wolfe. I think Sir, we've enough; Especially when I reflect, we lead The triple union to the battle! all Emulous of fame! most honourably Jealous of each other! and firmly resolv'd To bring no stain upon their mother country! Wolfe. This promises full well. I must to my repose; weak nature will No longer hold: Be it your care, Gentlemen, To see the order of the camp, and guard Against surprize; too much security, Has many forts, and many armies lost. Pardon, Gentlemen, the liberty I take, I cannot doubt your honour, courage, or Your prudence: Fail not I beg of using All your eloquence, to ward the hearts of All our troops, against the day, in which we Shall attack the French entrenchments, which I intend shall shortly be. That day will bring the bravest to the test? Britannicus. All shall be done a man can do, And if example will have any weight, That shall not be wanting. Leonatus. I join my gallant brother in command, And promise on the honour of a soldier, On my part, that nothing shall be wanting. Wolfe. My worthy 'sharers in command! my Honourable partners of bright glory! Adieu;—and Heav'n will speed you both. [Exeunt omnes.] SCENE II. Montmorenci; (Montcalm's Camp.) Montcalm, Levi, and Bougainville, in a Tent. Bougainville to Montcalm. So it seems Sir, the Britons demanded The town and garrison of Quebec, and Have sent three young Gen'rals with eight thousand Troops on the sleeveless errand? Montcalm. Being this day, with some others, at the Governor's conven'd, I heard the British Officer when he made the proud demand, Which we rejected with disdain, and sent Him back with such a message to their camp, As will give their enterprising boasted Wolfe, but little pleasure. On our refusal, he denounc'd rough war, And threaten'd devastation to the town And garrison:— And by a prisoner we have taken, We learn that they intend shortly to storm Us in our trenches. Bougainville. These Britains wou'd be thought invincible, And dream of nothing else but asking for Our forts, our towns and garrisons, as if The mention of their names had a magic Charm in it! wou'd waste our troops! and batte Down our walls! but they're mistaken! Whene'er they land at Montmorenci, let Us from our trenches pour down upon them, And shouting loud as Niagara's steep Cataract, with the like rapidity, Bear all down before us: leave the straggling Offals of destruction, as delicious Morsels for our savages! and scourge the Insolence of their young leaders! Montcalm. Be not too rash, good Sir. We must not give them battle on the plain, Nor carry on offensive war: Tho' young their leaders, and their troops but few, Their monarch, and their Minister, are too Sagacious to be deceived in this so Critical a choice! (no Pompadour rules there.) What'er their years, and muster roll, are found Deficient in, depend upon it, 'tis Over balanc'd well, by intrepidity Of soul! active resolution! a firm Contempt of danger! and well try'd vet'ran Service! Levi. Lead we not better troops than they? Besides, our numbers, bating savages, Are full four thousands more; we've every male Inhabitant within the town to back Us, they are some thousands; why shou'd we then Within our trenches sculk, as if afraid To meet them in the open field? rather Let us run them down by numbrers! and as The lordly lion serves the foremost hunters, When they press upon him, spurn them to a Knowledge of themselves! who fancy how they Rise superior to the common rank of Men! or else let us make them in a forc'd Retreat, precipitate themselves into The sea! Montcalm. Rather than dream of driving them before Us, like a tim'rous flock of sheep, let us Prepare to stand their furious charge, when they Like rav'nous wolves, o'erleaping sheep-folds, shall Mount our breast-works; and plunge into our trench! Which if they shou'd, they will not fail to make Us feel their mortal gripe! I can repose but little confidence In open field, in the rabble thousands Of Quebec, and less in all our savage Bands; the former, at the first onset will Break and run; and the latter, before the Roar of British thunder, and the bright blaze Of northern steely death, flee horror struck! And yelling, from the field. Bougainville to Montcalm. You seem enamour'd, Sir, with Britain's troops, And to forget the worth and bravery of your own. Montcalm. Pardon me, Monsieurs; I am not guilty of so gross a fault: I know the worth and bravery of our troops; And only speak th' opinion of the world Concerning our foes; their own atchievements Loudly speak the same!— (Waving the exploits of all former days) Look back in our own time to Fontenoy's Well fought! hard earn'd! and dreadful field to France! (And that Te Deum'd field of Dettingen!) Nay, bring the prospect nearer, and look back, To Louisbourg, (smoking yet in ruins! The horrid marks of the joint well temper'd Rage, of their Ulyssean Amherst, and Pelidean Wolfe!) There art! and nature! And the blustering ocean, join'd t'obstruct Their landing! yet, with what an amazing Intrepidity did they come on! and Plunge amidst the foaming surges on the Shore! choosing wat'ry death, amidst the fire Of thousands there intrench'd! rather than be Thought tardy in the race of honour! Bougainville. But what avails all this, concerning these British forces at present, come against Quebec? Montcalm. To put us more serious on our guards. They're the same victorious corps and leaders! This same young Gen'ral headed them! and with A martial skill, and undaunted fury, Spurr'd them on to glory! so that by his Example fir'd, an ardor ran thro' the Ranks, quick as so many trains of powder Blaze, when touch'd by the match, and rous'd them to Such enthusiastic rage! no obstacle Cou'd stop the rapid progress of their troops! Levi. All this is granted, Sir: But I presume the case at present chang'd: At Louisbourg, they had twice their present Number, and then we sent not all our troops To obstruct their descent; but if we now Include our savage friends, we number twice Their troops; our twelve thousand regulars are Veteran French, and have been often try'd Thro' the continent; we, ourselves, have seen Each other try'd in battle; why shou'd we Then not meet them in the field? Montcalm. That my resolves, and arguments, do not Proceed from any backwardness to fight, I to yourselves appeal.— Bougainville. Of that we must acquit you, Sir. We know your courage and ability; But fain wou'd have your private reasons for Your resolutions. Montcalm. Hear me then with patience. That we, I think, will stand the test, is put Beyond dispute: That we have good and well Train'd veteran troops I likewise grant, and Thousands more than they; but our success must Be the chiefest hinge, on which the affairs of Canada must turn: This barrier pass'd, They'll sweep onward like an inundation! And overwhelm each Gallic settlement In undistinguish'd ruin! and as the Event of war was ever dubious, and Numbers have not always conquer'd Englishmen; Why shou'd we give them equal battle, and Throw all at stake upon th' uncertain chance? Levi. I see no need to fear the coming to a battle. Bougainville. Nor can I doubt of matching them, when hand To hand engag'd: Eight thousand may begin Th' attack, and break the fury of their most Impetuous charge; shou'd these be repell'd, A corps de reserve of four thousand men, By all our rough Indian tribe assisted, May soon recover that first disorder, Help them to rally, and with new spirits, Face the foe: or at least they'll cover their Retreat (in safety) to their trenches: Then Shall we prove ourselves true sons of Mars, and Wipe away the scandal of a dastard name. Montcalm. Our bus'ness here is to preserve Quebec, And with as little loss as possible; And if from numbers we may hope success, Let us remain intrench'd, and make th' event More certain. The sea now swarms with English Men of war, who intercept our transports, And our royal fleets, therefore we can have But little hope of a supply of men From France: As for our invading foes, all Their attacks must be with loss attended: They're few already, and their troops will thin: Perhaps being harrass'd, sickness may ensue, And they'll grow weary of the tardy siege: Then, when their spirits shall be most depress'd, Rush we'll on them with our united force: Beat up their sickly camp! and make them take A bloody farewell! by which means, we shall Preserve our troops, our honours, and Quebec. Bougainville. On cool reflection, I now see plainly, What before did nor occur: Since we are The continental bulwark, and with us, Quebec must stand or fall, I do submit To lie before its walls, and only act On the defensive side; since through our troops A passage must be cut into the town. Levi to Montcalm. To your superior judgment I submit, And well applaud the plan of operation. This method may perhaps be better than Pitch'd battles, where one chance blow, a signal Misapply'd, or a word misunderstood, May turn the sway of action, subvert the Best concerted schemes, and fling a conquest Into the arms of those, who waited but The signal to desert the field: And all The world allows, that warlike arts and skill Mature, (with policy apply'd) to save The men, and gain the cheapest victories, (If not the first qualifications, they Are) to personal bravery, the next Best requisite in any General. Bougainville to Montcalm. I've nothing to object Sir; To your opinion I'm entirely won. Montcalm. Be it our chiefest care then to protract The siege, and save our men; Behind us lies Montreal, against which place, I learn the Gallant and experienc'd Amherst, their Sage prime chief, 'gainst Louisbourg, is in full March, with near ten thousand forces, and with Fierce Wolfe, no doubt, intends a junction; but In all human probability, they Never can surmount each obstacle, and Soon enough arrive with their expected Aid: But shou'd that reinforcement come, the Less our present loss, and harrassment now Is, the better we shall then receive them. Bougainville. Let us dam up th' entrance into Quebec; No landing place lies near the threaten'd town, And practicable, but Montmorenci's Strand, below our camp, which place we'll guard full Well, and render inaccessable, as Art, and warlike terrors can.— In these Northern climes, the winter will come On apace, and frustrate ev'ry hostile Plan; their thin remains (the baffled refuse Of repeated skirmishes) will then return With disappointed hopes, and sullen shame. Montcalm. But when they land, let us be well prepar'd For their reception; for they'll compel us To believe their leaders fierce! and all their Forces brave! [Exeunt omnes. The END of ACT II. ACT III. SCENE I. Point Levi. Wolfe, Leonatus and Britannicus. Wolfe. This distant battery avails us not; We waste our troops and harrass out our men, And expend our ball and powder but to Little purpose: I long to see our foes, And grapple with them in a close engagement. Britannicus. In that let all our resolutions fix, And let ev'ry movement center in that Purpose, to Montmorenci let's transfer The war, and with all our force united, Steadily pursue the end we've plann'd, and Launch destruction 'mongst their troops. Wolfe. Your sentiments concur with mine: To-morrow we'll attack 'em; th' Admirals Have promis'd all th' assistance in their pow'r, And I doubt not the hearty concurrence Of their officers and th' English seamen. Leonatus. All our officers and troops seem well pleas'd And once fully resolv'd; they only wait The signal for the undertaking. Britannicus. A greater emulation ne'er was known, Nor firmer union ever subsisted, Betwixt the soldiery and the seamen; The sep'rate corps no more support with cool Indifference each other's cause, nor in Their wonted disagreement jar: All seem To strive who shall be most alert t' exert Themselves to gain a glorious name; and like Gallant and faithful brothers in the war, Aspire to stand with the most intrepid Souls, the greatest shock of danger. Wolfe. We will not fail on our parts to answer Their warmest expectations, and lead them On to take gigantic danger by the Throat; and tho' repell'd, we'll force the Frenchmen To confess we fought like sons of liberty. Now let us hence to where our several Stations call us: Meanwhile, let us not grow tardy, but with Redoubled fury cannonade, and ply Them with disploding storms of shells, as if We meant to bury them in iron graves: Perhaps some lucky shell, or shot, mark'd out By fate, may do more than at other times, A month of toilsome siege. [Exeunt omnes SCENE II. The stage darkened, and two men placed behind the scenery with speaking trumpets, one at the front, and one at the inner end of the stage. A ship to appear. Front Man.

There let her grow; She makes a fine illumination: Clear your grapples, and get off in the stream In readiness. [Inner Trumpet, Lieutenant Hatchway, Front Trumpet halloo. Inner Trumpet. Here's a whole fleet of fire ships, and fire floats, Coming round the point: The French are trading with Lucifer I think, And have borrow'd th' infernal coast of him For this might's service.

Carpenters! stand by to cut the cables! Second Off. Pull up your starboard oars briskly my lads! And keep her well to starboard of us: Take care; don't fall athwart the ship's hawse Astern of us. [Sailors bawl out, Whurrow, whurrow: Never fear, never fear. Second Off. She goes clear of us: They have her under command. [Inner Trumpet, Lieutenant Hatchway, Front Trumpet, halloo. Inner Trumpet. I can perceive no more fire floats and fire ships Coming; that whole division may be employ'd In picking up such as pass'd the Point. Front Trumpet. They are all clapp'd on board by this time, And greatest part of them landed on Terra Firma: The most mischief they've done us, was just To singe one of the ships sides as they pass'd. [All the sailors within, Huzza! huzza! huzza! scene closes; lights descend. SCENE III. Point Levi: Centinels call in this manner behind the scenes, going up the right side thrice; that is in the front, center, and rear, All's well: The like on the left side, rear, center and front, all's well: At a distance, as on board the fleet in the river, all's well; all's well; all's well; all's well; different voices. Wolfe Solus, in his Tent. The dreadful tumult of this horrid night Is o'er, and with its clamours are all its Terrors vanish'd. Stuck firm upon the shore, in harmless blaze, These engines of destruction melt away. Throughout the fleet the voice of safety runs, And thro' the camp, from right to left, I hear The centinels revolve the welcome sound. Enter a Sea Officer. Wolfe to him. I congratulate you, Sir, on this night's Success, and the safety of all our fleet. We have luckily escap'd the danger, With which these fire ships threaten'd us. Sea Off. They threaten'd us with no less than total Ruin in one relentless blaze! it was A master-stroke of policy, and the French had like to have rais'd the siege at one Decisive blow. We had warm and busy Duty, and ev'ry boat belonging to The fleet, was well employ'd. Wolfe. Upon this Point, wrapp'd in suspense I stood, To see the fiery deluge rolling down Upon us, nor stirr'd from hence, until each Flame was row'd on shore, nor fail'd to mark with Pleasure, the transactions of the boats, and The activity of our tars. Sea Off. They all behav'd worthy of the fame they Have 'midst fire and smoke, in naval battles Gain'd: when first th' alarm was giv'n to mann our Boats, to meet and stop the fire ships, and floats, Turn'd adrift upon the stream towards us, They ne'er betray'd one token of base fear, Or backward tardiness for duty, tho' All a-head appear'd, as if the fiery Phlegethon had risen from its burning Bed, and from the hostile walls, was pouring Down it's sulph'rous torrent upon our fleet: With all the speed their oars cou'd make, they row'd Amidst the gloomy danger, surrounded On each side by floating flame! and as they Breath'd, drew in thick clouds of suffocating smoke: Still, as fresh ships and fire floats, came pouring Down, new spirits and new strength they seem'd to Gain! with busy anxious minds they boldly Wrought, and clear from ev'ry ship they tow'd Th' infernal flame! Wolfe. Whilst they were busy in the burning war, We in a vigilant suspense remain'd For battle ready, we might repel the Sudden onset expected from the French; 'Twas there they fail'd in policy. Sea Off. Perhaps in courage, Sir: 'tis seldom known They beat up English camps, or board a ship, Except when they are greatly superior In their force and numbers, and have a most Convenient opportunity. Wolfe. England, I think is most peculiarly Happy in her naval powers; I see No cause to doubt their future conduct in This siege; we have here, brave; vigilant, and Hardy officers and seamen. Sea Off. Their match in all his annual round the Sun sees not, so capable of duty, Or so agile in the working of the Ship, and brimful of alacrity, when Bearing down upon the foe to battle. On the mortal verge of close engagement, I've seen their souls o'erflow with joy! and their Full charg'd hearts, like rivers rising o'er their Banks, pour out a flood of rough but apt and Daring sentiments! England exult! tell wond'ring nations round, Thy freeborn tars mock at the name of fear! Fear not my lads says ev'ry British tar, And plunges thro' the thunder of the fight! Where flame and death, and war, rage in the most Tumultuous manner, there shout Britannik's Seamen, and with delight engage! Wolfe. I hope they'll still deserve the name they've gain'd, And live in friendly union with our troops: To-morrow I intend another rough Trial of their bravery and spirit, When they shall launch our sons of Mars upon the shore. Sea Off. I'll pawn my life our sailors will not fail. I hid you, Sir, good night, Wolfe. The same to you, Sir. [Exit Officer. Wolfe solus. O thou, whose never sleeping eyes pierce at One glance thro' space immense, watch o'er our camp! Retard all hostile ills! and shield us from surprise! [Exit Wolfe, &amp; the scene closes. SCENE IV. The French Camp at Montmorenci, Montcalm and Bougainville. Montcalm. Our grand scheme is baffled, and all our hopes From that quarter are frustrated. Bougainville. I had such a firm reliance on it, I thought it would surpass all human pow'r To baffle it: I expected no less Than universal ruin to their fleet, To have seen their powder blaze, and all their Stores expire in flames, whilst from their ships they Leapt by hundreds, and plung'd to watry death Below, t'escape the burning war above: At least, I thought the greedy flame wou'd have Devour'd sev'ral ships, and forc'd some others On the shore, and some whole crews have perish'd In the wild confusion! Montcalm. But see how contrary last night's event! Their sailors seem another race of men, Whene'er compar'd 'gainst other countries tars, And like the water, sulphur, smoke and flame! Seem almost to be their element! they Laugh at threat'ning danger! and play with black Destruction!— Bougainville. They've done this night, what England may ever Boast, what France will scarce believe, and other. Nations stand astonish'd at! Montcalm. Ungrateful truth! How many of us from Our diff'rent posts, mark'd with what unconcern, And cheerful resolution, they met the Flaming fleet! Oars mix'd with oars, like persons Striving for the goal! the sternmost drove the Headmost on! cheering each other with their Noise! all full of emulation, who shou'd Throw the grapples first! and thronging fiercely To catch each flame, they form'd (if I may use Th' expression) a sort of naval phalanx, Too firm, for any of our fire floats to Pass, and do the wish'd-for execution! Bougainville. For the future, but little from the like We can expect: they are forewarn'd, and will Not now be off their guard. Besides, it was The chiefest effort we, can make, and they Who baffled this, will sneer at all our vain attempts. Montcalm. Next we may expect to meet them on the Shore; for flush'd with this success, and full of Indignation at the great design, no Doubt they'll make some desp'rate push, by way of Fierce retaliation.—Let us expect The worst, 'twill rouze us more! and if we can Repel them now, perhaps they'll raise the siege. Bougainville. Let them come on!—we fear 'em not! We're ready!—They shall have a warm welcome! Montcalm. And such I hope, as will prevent their bold Intrusion for the future. [Exeunt. The END of ACT III. ACT IV. SCENE I. A Nunnery, a Lady Abbess, and Two Nuns. Lady Abbess. Oh how welcome seems the returning day, After this night of horrors!— 1st Nun. [crossing herself] Blessed Mary defend us, from all the Threat'ning dangers of the succeeding night! 2d Nun. [crossing herself] May all the holy angels, and host of Saints, be our protection this day; and the Ensuing days, until our army drives The enemies away. Lady Abbess. Heav'nly Father!—[crossing herself.] Such another night, for all the world I Wou'd not choose to pass!— Amidst the displosion of our own guns In the garrison, (so near us) and the Continual discharge from Point Levi, and The British ships, of mortars and cannon, The city seem'd to reel; nay, the very Ground trembled under us! whilst the whole air Felt one unintermitted shock; and in The undulating space, long hung the hoarse Growling sound, like distant thunder. 1st Nun. Good heav'ns!— How dreadful was the scene within our walls! Deban'd the cheering company of the More intrepid sex, to sooth our souls and Calm our fears, each sister gave herself for lost! 2d Nun. How shocking thro' the gloom of night, wou'd the Discharge of their artill'ry, and mortars, Flash like lightning, against our walls, and gleam Horrible thro' the long range of all our Cells! and then to raise us from the trembling Stupor into which the sight had thrown us, Instantly, the terrific roar roll'd over head! 1st Nun. Methinks I yet hear the battering of The balls! and see the shells, (like meteors) With their flaming tails, descending thro' the air! Lady Abbess. The shrieking sisterhood, (like a flock of Frighten'd doves, trembling! and scatt'ring from an Eagle sousing down) oft as they heard the Warning voice; a shell! or flight of shells! in Doleful accents pierce their ears, or saw the Flaming show'r aloft, fell prostrate! kneel'd! and Pray'd! or ran almost each a different Way, as fear suggested; seeking shelter, And dubious of th' event!—and from our Apartments, as they burst around us, broke Forth a terrifying scream!— 1st Nun. To this without our walls, in a dismal Concert, rung the groans, and cries, of dying People!—Houses tumbling into ruins!— Or perishing in flames:—Fearful mothers, With their children crying, and thronging in Heaps; not knowing where to fly for present Security, and calling loud on all The saints for help. Lady Abbess. Alas! in vain!— For over head would rise another show'r Of shells, and send them screeching headlong to A distant spot!—many too slowly fled; For death, with unrelenting haste, follow'd At their heels, and as a peasant cuts thro' A grassy meadow, so he mow'd down the Crowd!— 2d Nun. Oh terrible!—if they shou'd take the city! And we shou'd fall into the hands of these Rough Englishmen! 1st Nun. I'm shock'd at the thought!— 2d Nun. The very idea harrows up my Soul!— And darts a tremor thro' every nerve!— Lady Abbess. I hope it will not happen as you fear, We have all the saints on our sides, to pray For us; the bold General Montcalm, (who Has often beat them) and twelve thousand French Soldiers, with a Canadian militia, And some thousands of Indians, to fight for Us, and they are not half our number. 2d Nun. But still my good Lady they may beat us; And then alas what may we expect will Be the consequence! 1st Nun to Lady Abbess. Our Confessors, Father Dominic, and Father Francis, have told us strange things. Lady Abbess. Perhaps our good fathers were a little Too rash in forming their judgments, or were Misinform'd. What their whole nation is, I Cannot say; but I'm told by a Lady, Who was at Louisbourg when taken by them, That the officers behaved with the greatest Civility and politeness to all, But in a more peculiar manner, to The religious Ladies, and orders, of All sorts; kept the strictest decorum in The town, among their soldiers, and stuck most Honourably to their capitulation, Injuring none, after the deliv'ry Of the forts and town. 1st Nun to Lady Abbess. I'm greatly shock'd at what our Confessors Have told us! Lady Abbess. My dear children, discard these fears: I hope The Governor will not give up the town; But if he should, let this calm all our doubts: These are the men, who treated their captive Enemies with so much humanity And good manners at Louisbourg. 2d Nun to Lady Abbess. How know you that, Madam? Lady Abbess. From the same Lady, who inform'd me of Their former behaviour. I trust we're safe From personal insult: for where the true Spirit of brav'ry inspires the breast of Any Commanders in Chief, a manly Generosity accompanies it; And they'll keep the troops under then command, In good order and discipline, 2d Nun. Heav'n hear my pray'r and grant they may! For I'm almost at my wit's end!— Lady Abbess. But for your further comfort, my ghostly Father tells me, we are by and by to Have a general solemn procession, To the church of Misericordia, to Deprecate the ruin which threatens us, From this invasion of our enemies: Let us retire my children, and join with Them in their petitions for victory. This is our last, our best resource, in all Our dangers. [Exeunt omnes. SCENE II. Point Levi: Wolfe solus, in his Tent. The hour is near; and swift upon the wings Of time the minute rides, pregnant with fate! And full of dread decision; whether we Rout them from their fortify'd entrenchments, Or retreat with loss from Montmorenci, The purple bed of honour will this day Be throng'd with British worthies. [Enter an Officer.] Sir all the forces are embark'd, the ships Are station'd for their cover, both officers And men are in high spirits, and all seem To be resolutely ready to force The Gallic lines, and make their landing good. Wolfe. The lover pining in the absence of The fair inchantress of his heart, ne'er felt Such a flood of joy rush in upon his Soul, when she returning, charms his ears with The well known accents of her tongue, as I Now feel, to hear the welcome tale;—which tale, Has rous'd me to the onset, and kindled Ev'ry martial sentiment within my Soul, I go, at honourable Freedom's Call. To fight my country's battle. [Exeunt. [Curtain falls, thunders, and a discharge of artillery, and small arms, drums beating, and a shout of battle. Curtain rises, and discovers Capt. Ochterlony and Lieut. Peyton, lying wounded among several dead soldiers; Mr. Peyton's leg shatter'd near his knee; he being armed with a fusee, and a dagger. Drum beats a retreat.] Enter a Serjeant, and some Grenadiers as retreating. Soldier. O! dismal sight of grief! here wounded lie Our Captain and Lieutenant! Serjeant. We'll bear them off, tho' thousands dam the pass. [Speaking to Ochterlony, and reaching him his hand. Rise worthy Sir, and on my back ascend; Proud as a miser bears his load of pelf, Forth rushing from a house inwrapt in flame, My willing shoulders shall sustain your weight; Thro' crimson floods, and numbers of the slain: Another will your good Lieutenant take; The rest all opposition shall defy, 'Till we in safety shall depose our charge, Rescu'd from death, and far from scalping foes. Ochterlony. My gen'rous men, I ever thought you brave, And worthy of the fame our troops have gain'd; I feel I have my mortal wound receiv'd, Should I retard your quick retreat, you're lost: I am not therefore worth the hazard of Your lives, which yet may be of service to Your country, and in future days revenge My fall. Here let me lie, in painful joy, Reflecting on my soldiers proffer'd love; But bear the gallant Peyton from the field, I know his valour, and I love the man! Perhaps the foe may one day feel his worth, And you his gratitude. Soldiers. We'll take you likewise, Sir. Ochterlony. Soldiers, no more: I will not hazard lives So precious to Great-Britain, and my King; Nor at so great a price, will dearly buy A few short painful useless moments here: But oh! fulfil my last my best request! Preserve my friend; defend his precious life; And bear him safely hence! [Ochterlony reclines on a dead body. Soldiers move towards Mr. Peyton. Peyton. Stand off soldiers! nor think to take me hence, O can! can I bear the cruicating thought! How shall I when amongst our troops arriv'd E'er cast a look of warm reflection back, And in idea see my gallant friend, My Ochterlony! whilst alive forsook! And by his Peyton too! Oh, then to see him Drown'd in blood! by savage foes incircled, Screaming aloud th' infernal yell of joy: Then see the tomax sink into his head; His body mangled; and his scalp torn off. Whilst he perhaps is vainly calling on His absent friend!— No Peyton near, to dart like lightning on Them! and with remorseless amicable Fury, tread them down among their kindred Fiends below! Serjeant. Consider, Sir, reject not timely aid, Tho' fractur'd be your bone, vigor remains, And youth, and time may give that part new strength; Besides you yet may serve your country. Peyton. Serjeant, thou spok'st a dagger to my heart: For safety, and for life, my country calls, Then who shall Ochterlony save! pausing a little. It is resolv'd:—and here will I remain. [Speaking now in a commanding tone. Soldiers, with speed retreat while yet you may! Serjeant. Farewel, ye brave and much lov'd officers; We'd gladly bear you hence, and with our lives At stake defend you both, wou'd you consent; But here we can no longer safely stay, Our duty to our country calls us hence; For from their lofty trenches like a flood, The Frenchmen pour o'er Montmorenci's field, And like grim furies from th' infernal coast, The cruel savage bands are straggling round. [The Indians yell.] Hark! They yell the transport which they'll soon enjoy Amidst the scalping scene! we promise this, Our friends once more rejoin'd, we'll rouze them to Avenge your cause. [Exeunt soldiers. SCENE III. Manent Ochterlony and Peyton. Ochterlony. Oh, my dear Friend, e'er 'tis too late, be gone. Peyton, persuade me not, for I am fixt as fate! Watchful and fierce, as is the dragon said To stand, and guard the bright hesperian tree; So will I guard thee from the savage foes: Perhaps some foe of manly sentiment, By Providence directed, may approach; At least, before I die, amongst the scalpers I'll spread a gloomy scene of slaughter, and Fall with thee amidst a glorious ruin! [An Indian yell, Ochterlony attempts to rise, and Peyton begins to load his fusee; the scene closes in the mean time. SCENE IV. Enter Captain Macdonald, with a party of Highlanders, and a dead body. Macdonald. Yonder I see an English officer, Towards him speeds a band of savages; He seems design'd to stand on his defence, Too great the odds!— Three thither haste, and to his rescue fly! [Exeunt three Highlanders with drawn swords. Now onward with our fallen friend. [Exeunt omnes. Re-enter three Highlanders, with drawn swords, and Mr. Peyton on one of their shoulders, with his fusee. Peyton. Soldiers, I thank you for this timely rescue: To what officer owe I this obligation? First Highl. Capt. Macdonald, of Fraser's battalion, Whose frown against the French nerves all our arms With strength, and edges every sword, to hew Him out the path to glory; he sent us: We flew with pleasure to your aid, and flesh'd Our steel in every scalper we could reach. [An Indian yell, they all face about, and Peyton claps his fusee to his shoulder. The Indians halt. Peyton. Dare they not come! then bear me onward: For ambuscade and murder only fit; They ne'er cou'd face th' uplifted glitt'ring steel, Nor stand the light'ning of an English eye. [Exeunt omnes. SCENE V. The Camp on Point Levi: Enter a Sea Officer, and a Caledonian Chief. Sea Officer. So Peyton is return'd? but Ochterlony's lost? Caledon Chief. That is not certain: Mr. Peyton says, He saw him with a Frenchman, standing near The breastwork, and therefore he has hopes. Sea Off. Heav'n grant his hopes are true.— But tell me Sir, what pass'd while they remain'd Upon the field of battle? Cal. Ch. Whilst Ochterlony's bleeding heart glow'd with Undissembled love, (which none but friends can Feel) and pour'd out salutary wishes For his friend, Peyton, (like a bear growling O'er her wounded whelp) was swallow'd up in Friendly rage, and fiercely meditated Great revenge, if any hand should rudely Touch his Ochterlony. Sea Off. Well worthy they the names of soldiers and Of friends:—What ensu'd? Cal. Ch. Not long they lay in pain, 'midst blood and carnage, E'er two fell savages towards them came, Whose cruel meins, and ireful eyes, declar'd Their rugged souls ne'er felt a tender thought, Join'd by a Gaul, as savage as themselves; These wounded Ochterlony several times, For he unfortunately was unarm'd, And saw no friendly weapon in his reach, With which to deal the Caledonian blow, And like a dying lion, fall amidst The slaughter of his hunters! Sea Off. Oh, barbarous and inhuman! to wound A man at mercy, and a prisoner!— But proceed. Cal. Ch. He of their outrage to his friend complain'd: Quick as a spirit answers Merlin's call, The magic found rous'd Peyton from the earth; (Who in his friend's danger forgot his own:) He frown'd in flame, and sent the leaden fate! Death seiz'd a savage, and he groan'd his last! His mate upon th' Hibernian quick advanc'd; They both fir'd, both wounded were, yet both stood; The savage flesh'd his bay'net in his side; His fractur'd leg, and loss of blood forgot, Peyton's left hand his next thrust parry'd well, And flung wide off the sanguin'd point! whilst from His side his right a dagger drew, so well The bold Hibernian play'd the steel, he sheath'd It in his cruel heart! and spurn'd the vanquish'd Savage to the ground! Sea Off. You fill my mind with pleasing wonder! Caled. Chief. I tell you nought but truth; and more can add, How French artillery on Peyton play'd, Thund'ring applause, and roaring loud acclaim! What further happen'd you already know. Sea Off. But think you not we made a fierce attack Upon the French? Caled. Chief. We did indeed—and a horrid Scene it was! The bellowing engine of the skies began To growl! o'er the summit of the hill a Gloomy horror lowr'd! and down the clouds pour'd Their liquid torrents, and sheets of sulph'rous Flame; a prelude to that storm, which from the French camp soon after roar'd in pond'rous show'rs Of lead! High over-head th' æthereal Fragors broke; against our front the Gallic Artificial thunder roll'd! on ev'ry Side our friendly infantry, and cannon, Help'd to make the rattling concert up (Cœlestial and terrestrial lightning mix'd.) The French artillery, and small arms, swept Whole platoons away, and cut wide lanes of Carnage! among the landing troops and boats, In flaming show'rs, the countless bombs came down, And in displosion made promiscous havoc? So that thro' floods of flame, and deluges Of death, our men rush'd on to battle! Sea Off. And did like men full well acquit themselves: As well they might, when they had such a bright Example set by Monckton, Wolfe and Townshend, To rouze a noble emulation in Their souls; and their diff'rent corps were headed By many other leaders brave, old in Renown, and well accustom'd to look death And danger in the face. Caled. Chief. We made the attack to let the Frenchmen see We fear'd not death in any form, but might As well have thought of plucking mountains up By the roots, as of dragging Montcalm and His troops per force, against their wills, out of Their subterraneous caverns, or else, to Speak more proper, from their lofty furrow'd Precipices of the rocks, for trench on Trench rose, dreadfully beyond each other, And made a terrible gradation In the hill, as if they meant to sleep with Clouds for curtains to their deep entrenchments, And doubted the common surface of the Globe too low for safety. Sea Off. Our Gen'rals, at the disappointment, seem Chagrin'd, but undismay'd, and wait with fierce Impatience for an opportunity, To wipe the mem'ry of this foil away; When, as the sun blazes from an eclipse, They may rise more terrible in a storm Of vengeance, from this disaster, run their Gloomy courses and set in Gallic blood. I understand, as soon as possible, They are resolved to storm the town, or force Them to a battle distant from their trenches. Caled. Chief. These are the leaders for me, and these our Country will revere. Like the well-fed stallion in the stall, when He scents the female, at th' alarm of war, Their active souls grow restive; distain the Bounds by nature circumscrib'd, wou'd break the Stubborn dam, and thro' the battle wing their Way, to wed dame honour in the bloody field. We came not here to sleep our time away, And then return, and than tell our friends we saw Quebec and Montcalm's camp, from Levi's Point, Made one attempt (which, like a flash of powder, Vanish'd into smoke) and then grew tir'd of the siege, [Looking on his watch. Let us be gone, our duty calls, and that Shou'd never be neglected by a soldier, But especially on hostile ground. [Exeunt. SCENE VI. Point Levi. Wolfe, Leonatus, Britannicus and two Caledonian Chiefs, sitting in a Tent. Wolfe, [with a letter in his hand, speaking and looking, as if partly reading the letter.] Gentlemen; From our worthy brother Amherst comes this Advice; that as the distance 'twixt us is So wide, and Montreal well garrison'd, Dams up the road thro' which he needs must march, And with his pow'r unaided, force a pass Thro' their entrenchments, ambuscades, defiles, And deep morrasses, must clamber rocks and Hills, and thro' whole forrests hew, beset with Savage nations, and French troops, possess'd of Most advantageous posts; being well assur'd, He of necessity must fight thro' all. The congregated force of Canada, E'er he can affect a junction with us; He therefore thinks it necessary to Inform us, 'twill be full late before he Comes, if he arrives at all; especially When he considers, how necessary His presence is, where he now remains with All his forces: He therefore recommends Us to the care of Providence, trusting In the goodness of our cause, and concludes With strong assurance, he will join us if 'Tis practicable. 1st Cal. Ch. If Sir Jeffery Amherst cannot join Us with those gallant troops he leads (which we Indeed cou'd wish) let us not waste the short Liv'd season in fruitless wishes, and a Distant war, or grieve because the French by Us are not out-number'd; but let us, as Has before been hinted, by some means gain The Height of Abraham, and in Montcalm's Sight invest their walls; no doubt 'twill rouze the Frenchmen to a battle; and when they shall Advance to fight, we will upon ourselves Rely; and in our front shall march stern fate! Sustain'd on either wing by gloomy terror! Intrepidity shall head the main corps! And bold resolution shall bring up the Rear, and serve us in the stead of numbers. Britann. If Gen'ral Amherst joins us not, yet he Will be of service to us, shou'd we be Still compell'd to carry on the siege by Slow degrees: He keeps in awe the inland Pow'rs around, and is a curb on each fort, And Canadian settlement the French have Got: Full in the center of their diff'rent Corps he lies, and like a couchant lion In the path, fiercely waits to leap upon His prey, shou'd they e'er dare attempt to join, And Montreal seems terrify'd but at The rumour of his near approach, from whence We may expect they will detach no force Against us.—But I'm for speedy work, and Gallant actions, well becoming Englishmen. 2d Cal. Ch. Let us strike some noble blow, and make an Attempt worthy of ourselves, before a Sickness seizes on our camp, or sluggish Inactivity benumbs the spirits Of our men. Leonatus. Tho' brave and experienc'd the Gallic Commanders; veteran and more num'rous Their forces, with all the advantages On their side, of art and nature; such are The officers we have with us, and such The several corps they lead, on them I Ground my eager hopes of victory, and Dare to hazard all a soldier can hold Most dear, both life and honour, on equal Footing, in a close engagement with our Enemies. [Wolfe, &amp;c. rising, Wolfe. Gentlemen! I feel a mighty pleasure in my mind, To see the forward dispositions of Your souls, which I oftimes in our other Leaders have observ'd likewise, nor do the Soldiers seem to want th' ingredient Necessary for my plan.— This day I'll call a council, wherein I Will propose (and doubt not but 'twill meet the Wish'd-for approbation) that our army Be e'er night embark'd in boats, with ev'ry Necessary disposition for a Battle, which boats shall row some miles beyond Quebec, upon the tide, and when that tide Returns, then wrapt in silence, and the gloom Of friendly night, we'll gently downward glide Upon the stream, and at the foot of that Rough precipice, whose top communicates With Abraham's Height, we'll land unseen, and Up the stony steep we'll climb, 'till we have Gain'd the level summit, and when Aurora Ushers o'er the hills the car of day, all Rang'd in order firm, and dread array of War, we'll shout her such a welcome, as shall Make Quebec's rocky base to tremble! and Wake each Frenchman out of his lethargic Dream of vain security! Leonatus. This project suits my disposition well: Methinks I can already see both fronts In battle join'd; and every soldier Pressing onward to the goal of glory! Now their white ensigns beaten down, are all Restain'd with Gallic gore, and wear a purple Dye! [recollecting himself] the thought transported me. But here upon my sword [drawing] I swear [kissing it] I from That field will ne'er return, till victory Is ours, or I'm borne off with bleeding marks Of honour.— Britannicus. And on my sword [drawing his sword] I swear [kissing it] with heart resolv'd, And resolution firm to struggle for The palm of victory, and if we fail, I'll not think life worth care, to save it by A forc'd retreat. First Caledonian Chief, [drawing his sword.] By this good blade I swear [kissing his sword] which never prov'd Unfaithful to my arm, nor fail'd me in The greatest need; I'll put it once more to The noblest test, and thro' the thickest ranks Of Gauls, will hew my way victorious, And make it blaze a bright example to My corps, or fall that day, to be inroll'd In future annals, among the worthy Warriors slain on Abraham's Height. Second Caledonian Chief, [drawing his sword.] I kiss [kissing his sword] this burnish'd steel, in token of My great reverence for a soldier's name; And promise by my hope of future fame In war, to make the foes of Britain feel Its mortal weight; duty nerves my willing Arm, and honour gives the blade an edge; with This I'll strive to rouze my troops to action, And at the head of my battalion rush Towards Quebec, leading to conquest: But If retain'd at bay, by groves of bay'nets, And show'rs of shot, we bear not down the thick Obstructing ranks of Frenchmen, retreat we'll Scorn, deal death for death; and make them (as at Fontenoy) purchase mournful victory. Wolfe. [drawing his sword.] Mine be the task to ratify the whole: I likewise swear [kissing his sword] upon my sword, I'll hunt For conquest in the face of danger; If human resolution can effect The same, vict'ry shall be ours: we'll ravish Her my friends to-morrow! for if she's shy, And seems about to quit us, we'll summon All our manly strength, and fortitude of Soul, arrest her forward steps, and pluck her Back again; at least we can do this, earn Honourable deaths, and fall amidst a Monumental pile of glory, which we Ourselves whilst living rais'd around us! and Sampson like, drag with us to the grave whole Cohorts of our foes! For vanquish'd, I will never more return. Montcalm! I come, arm'd with angry Britain's Vengeance, to scourge European scalpers, And Canadian savages, and stand Thy rival in the fiercest shock of battle! [Exeunt omnes. The END of ACT IV. ACT V. SCENE I. Montmorenci, the French Camp. Montcalm and Levi. Montcalm. I've just receiv'd intelligence, that all The English army is imbark'd in boats, And one division is already swiftly Row'd beyond Quebec; the rest by all their Motions, seem inclin'd to follow them. Levi. Then doubtless they'll attempt to land so near As possible; Should we not, Sir, endeavour to oppose And repel them, or give them a baneful Welcome? Montcalm. Of that I've taken care.— I've order'd Monsieur de Bougainville To draw out two thousand from the camp, and Watch their motions: He marches this way, And will soon be here for order. [French drums beat a march. He comes with hasty steps and pleasure in his looks. Enter Bougainville addressing himself to Montcalm. Sir, your orders are obey'd: I've march'd two thousand from the camp, men well Resolv'd and eager to perform the duty you impose. Montcalm. 'Tis well Sir;— May they answer our best expectations. Proceed you now, and lead these men to the Banks of the river, and wait in ambush For the landing of the British troops, and Choose your posts as time and circumstances Will permit, to the best advantage. As they row up the river, be sure you Upward march likewise; whene'er they stop, then Halt; if they fall down the stream, retreat with Them, that in ev'ry shape (like their evil Genius) you may keep pace with them; and on Their debarkation, be ready boldly To receive them, in a show'r of leaden Vengeance, wing'd with flame. Bougainville. Be not afraid Sir, but we'll receive them As we ought; for tho' they land, cloth'd in all The terrors their boasted dreadful triple Union can assume, I doubt not but we Shall bring back with us, a good account of These few audacious Britons. [Going. Montcalm. But mark me well, Sir, should they downward bend Their course, and row as if they meant to reach Quebec, or Levi's Point again, then Dispatch me word immediately, and with Your main corps follow the messenger to The camp, with all the speed you can. [Exit Bougainville bowing. French troops beat a march. Levi. Think you, Sir, Monsieur de Bougainville Has troops enough with him, to repel all The British forces, should they attempt to land? Montcalm. All things together weigh'd, I think he has: He and his corps have often trod the ground, And in the darkest night can measure out Its distance well: No thought of ambush can Alarm them, they tread on friendly ground, and Are you know sustain'd by savages, train'd Up to night adventures, and to lurking fights: These Britons ne'er saw the ground, but at a Distant view; and when they land, will tread at Each uncertain step a hostile shore, and Must come on in dread of pitfalls, breast-works, Entrenchments, batteries, and ambuscades; And when they shall receive the fire from our Two thousand, their own fears, and the horrors Of the night (full of black uncertainty) Will multiply them to ten thousand strong. Levi. From which I may presume you wou'd infer, They'll soon retreat back to their boats, or fall A daring sacrifice, by a brisk fire, Kept up by our troops and friendly Indians. Montcalm. I do infer no less:— Yet policy suggests I shou'd not march Our main body thither, lest they evade Us, and in the night returning, make good Their landing at Montmorenci, and seize Upon our camp untenable by few. You've not forgot the fierce attack they made On all our troops, in their first bold attempt. And this I have t'observe, shou'd Bougainville Be put to rout by rage unparallel'd, And their rough impetuous charge, they know Each avenue and path, and safely can Retreat, whilst we to sustain them march out With all our force, oppose rage to rage, check The furious ardor of their souls, and from Their weary troops, ravish with ease th' infant Victory. Levi. I'm satisfy'd, and cannot doubt success. Montcalm. Let us to the camp repair, and put all In order for an attack upon us, Or an evacuation: These Britons Are not to be despis'd; they surely are, I fear, meditating some grand design. The gath'ring storm must e'er long fall somewhere; And on that dubious hour the Gallic Honour, Canadia's weal, our own bright fame, Britannia's enterprize, and Wolfe's rising Glory hangs. Whene'r it falls, I'll face the low'ring storm, Let death put on th' most tremendous form; With Wolfe I'll grapple for the laurel crown, Tho' mighty fate against my purpose frown: Yet if I fall, in death, 'tis some relief, Britons were foes I fought, and wond'rous Wolfe their Chief? [A woody scene, as if on the top of a hill, or precipice; and as near to the front as possible, to make room for the more ample scene of the Height of Abraham soon after.] [Colonel behind the scenes.] Advance briskly on them, my brave fellows! Climb that precipice, and close with the enemy! [A discharge of small arms and a shout. Enter several French soldiers, retreating before an English Colonel, at the head of some light infantry: As they run across the stage, scene draws, and discovers a larger View of the Height of Abraham. SCENE II. The Height of Abraham: Wolfe, Leonatus, and Britannicus, at the head of the troops; they all shout. Wolfe. At length we've gain'd an ample footing on This Height of Abraham (to which my soul With ardent wish hath long aspir'd) and are Advanc'd upon the glorious edge of battle. I will not ask my gallant soldiers, if You're ready; th' alacrity with which you Have explor'd the gloomy winding of this Ascent, and the brisk manner in which you Clamber'd up, surmounting all obstacles, Declares to me with greater certainty Than words, you're ready. Britannicus. Each low'ring brow declares the resolutions Of their hearts, and indicates th' heroic Workings of their souls, in every face I read a warm impatience for th' onset, As if they'd say, why stand we here in cool Deliberation? Let us to closest Fight advance, our foes may see us frown, and Mark each lifted arm descending with the Mortal blow, that we may hew thro' the front Of their battle, and trample down their rear. Leonatus. Who falls this day, may well be deem'd great in His death; and worthy of a British Patriot's name! How much our absent and worthy friends of Freedom will envy us each glorious wound we feel: Wolfe. Oh! what a beaming blaze of victory, Love, and never-dying fame, will crown each Rich survivor's head! who helps this day to Rout the num'rous French, and scourge their scalping Friends, (those bands of human brutes, back to their Lurking dens, and native wilds again! Now beat our drums, and sound each instrument Of war, whilst we march onward to the Field Of fame. [Drums beat, instruments sound.] [Exeunt, beating a march. SCENE III. Scene draws, and discovers Montcalm, sitting in his Tent. Enter Levi. Levi. Sir, there's a rumour in our camp, that all Th' English, troops are ranging on the Height of Abraham, if so, we may soon expect them here. Montcalm. It cannot be!—wou'd they dare attempt it? They cannot have eluded Bougainville's Caution!—He has not inadvertantly Let them pass; and surely all our out-guards, And centinels, have not been wrapt in one Fatal delusion, all conspiring to Retard a timely notice of their landing. Perhaps a desperate few have straggled Thither, in order to amuse our troops, Whilst others strike an unexpected blow: Draw out a small detachment from the camp Against them. Levi. Nay, had they ev'ry man they've brought against Quebec on Abraham's Height, I shou'd esteem It but the forlorn hope of Britain. Montcalm. Let my orders be executed, and Bring me word immediately how matters go. [Exit Levi. Montcalm solus. If all their troops are there, they'll give us work Enough this day to drive them thence, and prove, I fear, a dear bought victory to France. Re-enter Levi, in more haste. Sir I'd fear it will require our utmost Efforts to repel the storm which threatens Us! There's scarce a man of all the English Troops, but now treads Abra'am's Height! with headlong Rage they stumbled up the precipice! and With Herculean fury, their bombardiers, And sailors, drag up th' artillery, and With their light arm'd infantry, in equal Pace they roll the brazen thunder onward! They had already taken possession Of the fort which guarded the ascent, and Turn'd the guns upon our flying parties, Who as they mingle with our forces, in The outlines of our camp, spread terror. [Montcalm rising, and drawing his sword. Then now 'tis time to rouze, and stir ourselves! Let the drums beat to arms! and call forth all The pow'r within our camp; we'll onward march To meet them; and before our walls, in presence Of our friends, shall both our battles close. [Exit Levi. Montcalm solus. These Britons will compel us to hazard All on equal footing on the plain, or Force us tamely to sit down entrench'd and, See Quebec by them beleaguer'd; but e'er They shall do that, death or victory, shall Be mine. This day the fates weigh Britain against Gaul; Wolfe, thou must bleed, or flee, or I will nobly fall. [Exit. [The French drums beat to arms.] SCENE IV. [Scene draws, Montcalm and a French Officer at the head of his troops; the French drums beating a march.] Montcalm. Halt. Enter Levi. Montcalm. Are all our Indians dispos'd of to the Best advantage? Levi. They are, Sir;— And as fierce tigers from their covert, eye Th' approaching kids and couchant lick their chaps, Anticipating the delicious banquet; They in their close ambush lurk, with furious Expectation, viewing the British troops, Waiting for the welcome signal to fall Upon their broken rear, or else pick up The scatter'd remnant of their flying forces. Montcalm. Since they seem to like the chace so well, I Hope we'll give them sport enough e'er long. [Turning to the soldiers. Now my brave countrymen, remember you Are to fight in the cause of Lewis, the Well-beloved of his people; you fight Likewise your country's battle; and I may Add, many of you here fight for wives, and Children, and possessions; and if any thing Can wake your dormant rage, and kindle up A flame of valour in your souls, all these Considerations can. French Off. Altho' their army's greatly thinn'd, and they Can scarcely number full five thousand strong, And we, (excluding all our savages,) Can muster twice their tale, yet think not they May be easily repell'd; altho' we Have no room to doubt of victory, if We behave like men of spirit, who have Their country's good at heart, yet march into The field forewarned thus, with courage firm, Boldly prepar'd for the severest trial Of your manhood, and meet resolutely, Expecting th' impetuosity of their charge. Montcalm. If you'd acquit yourselves as soldiers shou'd, Who wish their King and country well, and long Have thirsted for an opportunity, To staunch your bleeding mother's wounds, and to Retrieve her long lost honour; you must not Think meanly of them, but call up all the man Within your souls, and bravely blaze, absorb'd In valour's flame! Intrepidly resolv'd, and skilful, are Their leaders, and commanders; rough, fierce and Veteran, are their soldiers; and in their Defeat, great wou'd be our fame! Let us march to meet them. [Exeunt, drums beating a march: Scene closes. SCENE V. Wolfe, at the head of the troops; a march beating; and opposite, as from Montcalm's camp, enter an English Officer, addressing himself to Wolfe. Sir, I come from reconnoitring Montcalm's Camp, where with all the haste they're masters of, They're arming, evacuating the trenches, And forming on the plain; they seem inclin'd To save us the trouble of forcing their Entrenchments, and in a few minutes we may Expect them here. [Wolfe, turning to the soldiers. Now the completion of your wishes is At hand! you no more shall pant for war, and With impatience glow, chiding the tardy Hours which roll'd inactively away, Nor shall you ask indignantly again, When shall we meet and rush upon our foes? And battle with them, bay'net to bay'net, Sword to sword, front to front, and man to man? [They all shout, and several call out, Lead us on to glorious death, or victory! To glorious death, or victory! lead us on! An Officer advances from the rear. Wolfe. Is the artillery well advanc'd? Officer. They have already gain'd the rear, And 'twixt the flanks of diff'rent corps, they are Advancing to the front with intrepid Haste, and ready to eject their mingled Storm of lead and iron, to deform the Hostile ranks of war. Wolfe. When they have gain'd the front, (pregnant with fate) Let our fulminating engines bellow Britannia's salutation to the French; 'Midst which we will advance, careering in The thunder storm. Are all the corps dispos'd of as I order'd? Officer. Col'nel Howe, and his light infantry, are Drawn in a semicircle round our rear, and Left flank, and form an offensive moving Bulwark against th' incursions of such foes, As may be lurking in the adjacent coppice, Where doubtless all their Indians skulk: Ev'ry other officer, and corps, fill their Stations in the field. Wolfe. Then we are ready for the onset: Good Providence! befriend us. Officer. Whilst traversing the field, from rank to rank, I found a sympathetic resolution Spread from man to man; each leader glowing With an indignant noble emulation For glory, (with sparkling eyes, brimful of Fierce delight, and steady countenance) strove To animate his corps, who stood alert: And when the drums began to beat, join'd with The shrill fifes, when the brisk clangors of the Trumpets echo'd thro' the ranks, and the deep Throated cannons roar'd a dread prelude to The battle, their gen'rous souls dilated With a warlike pride! then (like Job's war-horse) They bid adieu to fear, and with genuine Freeborn ardor, eager for close action, Join'd in loud concert with the martial grand Enliv'ning melody; sending forth their Wonted cheering shouts of exultation! Wolfe [turning to the soldiers.] In view, before us lies the plenteous field Of martial glory, in which this day we Are to reap, with honourable toil, a Matchless harvest of renown: Now is the Time to serve our country well, to spread the Terror of our Sov'reign's name, and with a Freeborn flame rush into battle. Let glory warm our emulating hearts, Like men in Britain's cause, to play our parts: 'Gainst Montcalm now, let us defiance roar, And fate's untrodden path resolv'd explore: And when the dreadful conflict is begun, Let each remember he's a Briton's son; Each recollect Great Britain's wholesome laws, Let each reflect he fights in freedom's cause; Then glowing with the thoughts, we'll charge our foes; Lighten like Jove, and deal our riving blows. [Scene closes, drums beat a short march on both sides, then a point of war; a discharge of artillery and small arms, a shout of battle, and Indians yelling: Scene draws and discovers General Wolfe wounded in the wrist; an Officer attending.] Officer. You bleed, Sir. Wolfe. The ball graz'd my wrist. Officer. Shall a Surgeon be call'd to dress the wound, Sir? Wolfe. Call no Surgeon for a wound so slight as this. [Taking out his handkerchief, and wrapping it round his wrist] We waste the precious moments! whilst all are Upon the wing to honour! See, where the Anstruthers and Caledonians, with a Mutual emulation, hew thro' the thick Obstructing ranks of Frenchmen; and as they Lift their burnish'd steel, they fling a transient Gleam of terror round! And see, where every other corps with Bayonets fix'd, to close engagement throngs! Let us my friend among 'em speed, and in Their front rush foremost to their goal of glory! [Exeunt, in haste. [A shout of battle, Indians yelling.] Scene draws. Levi and a French Officer in disorder. Levi. The battle will be irretrievably Lost, without a sudden turn! Gen'ral Montcalm, and others are wounded! The wings give way! the main body is broke! Officer. The Indians faintly squall their horrid yell Of onset! and in their thick abushment Riveted agape, they gazing stand as Thunderstruck! Levi. Heav'ns! that such a handful of men should work So much confusion! Run! Rally the broken troops, and make them stand; Whilst I head and spirit up the main corps, 'Till Bougainville's reinforcement arrives. [Exeunt severally, in haste. [Montcalm brought in by two, his thighs wrapp'd and bloody.] Montcalm. Each Englishman this day behaves, He wore Medusa's head! with Gorgon frowns They look some Frenchmen pale and stiff with horror! Whilst with averted looks, others retreat With a Mercurial speed! 1st Soldier. Where'er they face, our troops retreat; Or else they pierce and hew a lane of carnage out. 2d Soldier. Our army dares as far as men can do: But who can stand the charge of these Impetuous Britons! The day is theirs! Quebec must fall! Montcalm. And Canada is lost!—Alas my country! As the roaring thunder, on the rapid Wings of keen light'ning, bursts resistless thro' The sturdy oaken grove, scorches, and rives, And lays its stubborn honours low, so the Furious Britons break thro' our thickest ranks! And as a cold blight nips tender blossoms, The fierce Wolfe blasts all the former honours Of my life! he tears with greedy hand the Fading laurels from my head! and rises Into glory, whilst in disgrace I set! Bear me into Quebec. [Exeunt. [Montcalm, as they go off. Canada shakes!—my country bleeds!—my honour's lost!— [Groans, oh— Enter Leonatus, supported by two soldiers, his hand to his lungs. Leonatus. Ill fated bullet!— In its rapid flight, I fear it pierc'd my Lungs, and threatens painful dissolution. If we gain the vict'ry, welcome death: my Wound would plead with sanguin'd eloquence for fame. [Looking back, as he looks back, a shout. I must quit the field! For tho' my spirit is resolv'd, yet the Poignant torments, and expence of blood, roll Cooling tremors to my heart, and weigh frail Nature down. Soldier. Sir, as we pass'd the rear with you, I think I saw General Wolfe bearing off this Way, between four. Leonatus. Cease the unwelcome tale! That news pierc'd thro' my soul and from the near Exhausted fountain of my heart, roll'd a Fresh purple stream of life!—yet still I'll hope. [Going off, and looking back. Oh! Townshend! What an harvest of immortal glory, Wilt thou reap this day! [Exeunt. [As they go off, enter four soldiers, bearing General Wolfe; an Officer attending.] Wolfe. Here let me rest awhile:— My wounds grow painful.— [Speaking to the Officer. Pray tell me, Sir, how goes the battle? For hearing is the chiefest sense I've left: A chilly damp of gloom hangs o'er my sight, And seems to wrap me in a waking dream. Officer. Firm as a rock amidst the billows plac'd, Our little army stands the furious charge Of their ten thousand vet'ran troops! And at an awful trembling distance held, The savage yelling bands, (with horror struck) Howl out their rage against the gallant Howe, And his small corps of infantry, yet dare Not come within the fascination of Their eyes, nor meet the piercing terrors of their frowns! Wolfe. Discern you this for certain? Mock me not I beg with vain delusive Hopes in my last moments.— [Officer, clapping his hand to his breast. Upon my honour, Sir, I discern it well. Wolfe. Now fate retard thy speed! Oh death inexorable! stop! stop thy dart! Already-levell'd at my breast! that my Glad soul may take its flight, amidst the shouts Of my victorious countrymen! [Groans. Officer. Now front to front they close and man to man They stand, and urge the steely arguments Against each others breasts! Pikes, bayonets, And halberts meet and clash together! Others with batt'ring firelock's clubb'd, engage, And pound to death their rough opponents! and All around the glitt'ring deaths, in show'rs of Steel descend! Wolfe. Ill lay me back, and rest awhile, Perhaps this cooling tremor may wear off. [Lays back against a soldier, (sitting for that purpose) as he falls back groans, and lies as dead. Officer. The Gallic standard backward seems to move! And in a disarray their colours seem! Near their pale flags our blood red ensigns wave! And in conjunction mortal, spread the plain! They still recede! and ours as swift advance! Our wings and main corps boldly cross their lines! They've beaten down the oriflamme of France! And now they trample it in Gallic gore! And like a rapid inundation, they Mix promiscuous with the hostile ranks, Repelling the impetuous torrent of The foes, gorging voracious death with whole Platoons!— Surely towards Quebec our forces rush! And all their vet'ran thousands swift retreat! Oh now they scatter!—now they flee full speed!— Victory!—Victory!—by heav'ns they run! [A shout of victory, and Indians yelling. [Wolfe raising himself in haste.] Who runs?—That sound recall'd me into life!— Surely my fearless Britons do not run!— Now I'm well!—bear me into the battle!— Amidst the greatest rout there set me down! My soldiers will not leave me! The glorious tumult of the war, has charms To stay my flitting soul some short moments! And the bright implements of death shall give New day to my benighted eyes, and light Me where to snatch at victory with my dying grasp! Officer. Your fears are needless, Sir: For in a total rout the foe is fled: Your soldiers chace them headlong to their walls! They kill! run down! and take at pleasure! and Never was a victory more complete! Wolfe. My glory's race is run!—my country's serv'd! Quebec is conquer'd!—Great George is victor!— I wish no more; and am completely satisfy'd. [Dies. Scene changes to London. Sophronia's House: Enter Sophronia, and a Gentleman. Gentleman. Madam there's a report in town, Quebec Is taken. Sophronia. How comes the news? I might expect to have heard as soon as Any; Heav'n grant all is well.— Gent. I hear there is an express arriv'd to His Majesty. Soph. An express arriv'd! [sighing] and is it possible My son can have forgotten me!—my heart Forebodes all is not well with him—[sighing] know you The particulars? [flutter'd] Gent. Madam, I could not obtain a knowledge Of them. Soph. That was unkind indeed not to enquire; The friendship that has long time subsisted Between you, and all the fond endearments Of your youth together, methinks shou'd have Prompted you to gain a recital from The messenger, of all concern'd my son. I shou'd have had a thousand fond queries, And dwelt with rapture on his bravery, List'ning with delight to the melodious Tale of honour. Gent. Too much I know. (Aside. To her. I have enquir'd, but cou'd not get the whole Intelligence. [Sophronia aside. His solemn looks, like to black gath'ring clouds Preceding a thunder storm, seem to me The dismal harbingers, to warn me of Th' approaching storm of grief! To him. Learnt you any thing, Sir! [eagerly.] Oh! tell me, tell me! [sighing] Gent. I learnt your son gave the Frenchmen battle Before Quebec, in which he sev'ral wounds Receiv'd, but still rush'd fearless onward to The goal of glory, heaping new honours Upon those already gain'd, and at length Obtain'd the hard disputed victory: The dubious conflict ended, Quebec fell To the conquerors. Soph. Alas! there's more to follow;—and I fear This great encomium on his valour, Is like an opiate that's giv'n to a Patient, to lull him to repose; but when The dormiant draught is evaporated, And the gentle slumber wears away, he Awakes in torments exquisite again. Forgetting the short respite of his woe. Wounded you said!—and slain I fear—[weeping] cou'd he Not write to me? Gent. His wrist was broken, Madam. Soph. He had a tongue!—[sighing.] His secretary then Could write.— [Aside. He makes such vain evasions, surely my Son is lost—[weeping.] To him. Will you go in and stay dinner with us? Let me know the worst, I beg Sir,—for this Anxiety is insufferable!— [Exeunt. Sophia sola, in Sophronia's Parlour. Enter to her a servant. Madam, my mistress will wait on you immediately. [Exit. Sophia sola. A gloom hangs on the countenance of all I meet here, and with a fatal presage Fills my soul—Be still my heart,—nor pine at The decrees of fate: Now summon all thy Resolution, to bear th' unwelcome tale, From whence to date the æra of thy grief. Enter Sophronia. Sophia. Madam I took the liberty to wait On you, in hopes of having the pleasure To wish you joy of your good news from Quebec. Soph. I'm oblig'd t'ye Madam, for this friendly Visit,—but have no room to hope for joy. [Sophia, aside] Has she no room to hope for joy!—then what Have I to fear! [sighing] To her. Pray, Madam, what intelligence arriv'd? Sophia. I have not seen the Gentleman who brought Th' express, nor receiv'd a letter, but I Have great reason to guess by what I've heard, Cou'd the lofty sounding name of honour Give a mournful parent any joy, from The gallant exploits of my son, perhaps I might some pleasure feel, and boast he fell A British Patriot. Sophia. Is he then slain!—Ah me!— And was my happiness so fleeting! Soph. If your happiness, Madam, is center'd In my son, fleeting it may be; for I Fear he is no more. [weeps] Sophia. Then farewel all the goodly treasure of Felicity, which my fond soul had in Expectation hoarded up.—Oh how oft In fancy had I been clasp'd within my Hero's arms! and dwelt with vast pleasure on His tales of danger; whilst my list'ning ears Methought, were sweetly ravish'd with the loud Exulting shouts of his glad countrymen, And friends, to welcome him victorious to His native shore!—But now a sad reverse Of fortune threatens me—[weeps.] Enter a Gentleman, addressing Sophronia. Madam, here's a Gentleman Officer Without, from Quebec, desires to speak with you. Soph. Be pleas'd, Sir, to introduce him. [Exit Gent. A palpitation seizes on my heart! A cold tremor runs thro' ev'ry vein; the Direful agitation both of soul and Body, borders on a fond delirium. Oh, what tender anguish! what racking woes Unspeakable, careful tim'rous mothers Feel for their dear offspring! Children of their Youth; and sweet pledges of connubial love! Enter Officer and the Gentleman. Officer to Sophronia, [bowing and looking serious] Madam, I am from Quebec. Soph. So I learn, Sir,—Is all well there? [eagerly] Officer. [aside] She must know it. To her. Madam, your son is conq'ror; he has gain'd Universal love, esteem, and never Dying fame! Sophia. [aside] That welcome sound wou'd almost lift my soul To heav'n, did not his gloomy countenance Fill it with dubious fears and clog its flight. Soph. But does he live?—Shall I again in these Fond arms infold the staff of my age; and To my bosom press the darling of my Soul; bedew his manly cheeks with tears of Joy; and listen with a parent's pleasure, Whilst he recounts his wounds, his dangers and His battles?—But oh! I fear such joy is Not in store for me—[weeps.] Sophia. [aside, weeping] My sad soul can sympathize with her's in Silent sorrow. Gent. I've this to add, before the battle clos'd, Your son was wounded in the breast, and Carried from the line. Soph. [weeping] Too true my fears are come to past: Go on, Sir; for I'm prepar'd to hear the worst. Sophia. [aside, weeping.] My throbbing heart anticipates his tale. Officer. The wound he then receiv'd was dangerous. And your son is— Soph. [hastily] Oh, say not he is dead!— Officer. Madam, he is,—and nations mourn his fall. [Sophronia faints, and falls into the arms of the Gentleman, who sets her in a chair, placed there for that purpose. Sophia stands seemingly regardless of the whole, and lost in dumb sorrow.] Gent. Who waits there! [Enter a woman servant to assist. Soph. [recovering after a short time.] Cruel generosity! Oh! Why by your officious care have you Awaken'd me from the sweet delusion? My soul was on the wing into the world Of spirits blest, to meet and hold in an Eternal clasp, his much lov'd filial shade. Sophia. The ball which took his life, consign'd my [illeg.] To woe. Officer to Sophia. To say you shou'd not grieve for such a loss, Wou'd be to change all nature's order. To Sophronia. Not to sympathize with you, Madam, wou'd Indicate a most unfeeling soul:—Your Son was all a fond mother cou'd desire, Or a tender virgin wish:—Yet in the Dying victor's fall, there's consolation. Beyond the common rank of men his name Shall live, and in Britannia's patriot List, shall shine with a superior blaze: He Nobly dy'd!—And as he for his country Fell, he left you full of honourable Grief, array'd with solemn dignity of Glorious woe. [Turning to the audience.] Shou'd France again Europe in broils engage, And dare to rouze the dormant lion's rage; Methinks I see your souls around me glow With flame indignant, 'gainst th' insidious foe! Like sons of freedom to maintain your cause, Nobly to save wives, children, lands and laws, To glory's goal what Briton wou'd not fly! To fall like Wolfe, who wou'd not wish to die! Who wou'd not fight the treaty-breaking Gaul! When George, and liberty, and martial honour call!. FINIS.</field>
