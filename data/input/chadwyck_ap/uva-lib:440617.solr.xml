      <field name="fulltext">TO HIS EMINENCE, CARDINAL JOHN HENRY NEWMAN, THESE POEMS ARE, WITH HIS GRACIOUS PERMISSION, REVERENTLY INSCRIBED BY HIS SERVANT, THE AUTHOR. DEDICATION. As waters from the lowliest valleys breathe Their tribute vapors to the mountain height, Where each, anon, transfigured of the light Enkindles all the parent wave beneath; So, these my misty reveries I wreathe, And waft them to the summit of thy sight, Till in that sunshine, shriven from the night, A mirrored benediction they bequeathe. For long thy lordly Eminence hath stood Among the favored of the Olympian Nine, Upon whose ear thy psaltering voice renewed The ancient echoes of the classic shrine, Whereon the while my tottering steps intrude, Fain would I place a timorous hand in thine. THE HOSPITAL BIRD. A breath of joy, sweet bird, A solace to each prisoner of pain, A pledge of hope returning, is thy strain Through the long watches heard. The soul in sleepless sighs, Or else of dreams, through panting hours, the prey, Hails in thy voice a prophecy of day Ere yet the darkness flies. The tender babe, new-born,â The dying mother, startled by its wail,â The fevered brow,âthe cheek of madness pale,â The bosom rest-forlorn,â Each, with emotion strong, Heaves through the billowed agonies of night, Whilst over them, a glittering foam of light, Drifts thy unshadowed song. How vast its influence sweet! How small the voiceful compass of thy throat, Whereof each silver, scintillating note A thousand blessings greet! Teach me the power divine Some light o'er dark humanity to fling, Some song of hope celestial to sing, Dear to all hearts as thine. THE VISION OF THE TARN. Alone, in contemplation lost, I stood upon a castled height, Dark beetling o'er a lurid tarn That glassed the brow of night. Between the icy flash of stars, Above me sprinkled and beneath, The silence of the listening air Was counterfeit of death. No cloud upon the naked sky, No ripple on the lake below; But o'er the sluggish waters hung A phosphorescent glow, That suddenly, all quivering wan, As smitten with the throes of birth, Upheaving, vanished, to reveal A phantom not of earthâ A lily wonderful as light, Unfolded on the balmy deep, And, cradled in its bosom, lay A presence lost in sleep. And tenderly a star remote Shed holy lustre o'er the place, Where innocence and peace betrayed Such unimagined grace That e'en the calm celestial orb, Enamoured of the dream below, With tremulous emotion pale Diffused a milder glow. And I beheld, in mystery, The secret of my vision fairâ That of a relic sprung the flower That bore its image there. And from the watchful satelliteâ The dwelling of a spirit fledâ That faithful sentinel of love Its vacant shrine surveyed, And knew, through all transition seen, Its place and habitation dear, Still waiting, in the throb of hope, Its resurrection here. Long had I gazed; but, lo! a cloud, Down-swooping as a bird of night, O'erwhelmed me, and the phantasy Was blotted from my sight. THE WIND. A gentle sigh of half regret Thou breathest o'er me now, Scarce wakening the leafy shade That trembles on my brow; And yet of direful visitants The sternest thou. Controlling all, of none controlled, O'er earth, and sky, and sea, Where'er thou listest, wandering, A scourge or balm to be, Thou bendest all to reverence Thy majesty. Thou scatterest the fleecy clouds, And herdest them again, To pour upon the harvest lands The bounty of the rain; Then winnowest, with lusty flail The ripened grain. In lordly blessings lordliest, In malediction worst, Thou fannest from a shadeless wing, On multitudes accurst, Wan famine, reeking pestilence, And scarlet thirst. The anger of the storm is thine, The terror of the wave, Old ocean, in thy foamy wrath Howls, smitten as a slave, Or, at thy whisperings of calm, Forgets to rave. We see thee not, though everywhere Thou compassest the eye: Thyself, in silence mystical, The subtle harmony Of Nature's tuneful choir divine Dost all supply. Mute spirit, if thy pinions waft, Unbidden, o'er my soul, The thoughts that as a tide of dreams Involuntary roll, Be thine the gift of utterance,â My tongue control! INVOCATION. Come, gentle Sleep! Unchiding mother of a wayward son; Come, and mine eyelids steep, For day is done. And night's cold shadow steals my lonely soul upon. Come, Queen of Peace! And seal me with thy benediction now; Come, and from care release The throbbing brow, And to thy sceptred calm each stern emotion bow. Bring with thee dreamsâ Responsive visions of the days gone by, Still as in quiet streams The pictured sky, That with a soothing charm allures the pensive eye. Thou art of Love A tender token to each erring child, Sent, as the holy dove O'er waters wild: The one remaining joy of Eden undefiled. As pilgrims, we, Thy children, weary of the shifting scene, Turn for repose to thee: Thy brow serene No frown repulsive clouds, the yearning heart to wean. When life is spent, And Death, thy brother, claimeth as his own All that thy favor lent, Then for thy son Plead, that he kindly deal, as thou hast ever done. THE DOVE. A tuneful mist above a silent sea O'er which thou broodest, seems thy voice to meâ A moan of widowed memory above A tideless depth of erst impetuous love. E'en as the main, thy circling monody Upon the lone horizon meets the sky, Where faintly flickers, in the distance far, The afterglow of hope's departed star. Pour forth, sweet bird, thy requiem; and lo! Night's dreamy waves of sympathy o'erflow To soothe thy pain; while thoughts, attuned to thine, Melt into twilight tenderness divine. FLOWERS. They are not ours, The fleeting flowers, But lights of God, That through the sod Flash upwards from the world beneathâ That region peopled wide with deathâ And tell us, in each subtle hue, That life renewed is passing through Our world again to seek the skiesâ Its native realm of Paradise. How brief their day! They cannot stay; Our mother Earth Beholds their birth, And spreads her ample bosom deep, Some relic of their stay to keep, And each in benediction flings A virtue from its dainty wings; But lo! she treasures it in vain, It blooms, and vanishes again! A FLEETING GUEST. Through the foul arch of night, On airy pinions white, It came to me, And, in the smile of day, All beautiful it lay, Yet pale to see. âWhence comest thou?â I cried; A silence soft replied: âFrom regions vastâ The ocean gave me birth, And thence through heaven to earth My spirit passed.â As o'er an elfin bright, I bent with strange delight, But all too near; For, lo! my breathing warm Dissolved the magic charm Into a tear! A PRELUDE OF NIGHT. Over the waters far there came, At the birth of the evening star, a voice Like music low: Unto the heart alone it spake, With the stress of the ocean tone. âMine is the reign of peace,â it said, âDay's restless throbbings cease in me; The fevered glow Of her o'er-wearied feet subsides Beneath my kisses sweet. âMy starry arch doth link this calm Of twilight to the brink of her Pale sister-hour, While trembling shadows weave in one All stranger souls that grieve. âLight is the keen-edged blade that cleaves The spirits kindred made in dreams: My gentle power Breathes into souls apart a sigh From the day's breaking heart. âNoon hath no gift of tears: her eye Burns with a glance that sears the wings Of tender thought; And from its lidless fire, aghast, All fairy throngs retire. âNight is the elder child of God; His brooding spirit mild, as ere The light was wrought, Still, for its wonted rest, returns To her dark-sheltered breast.â LINDENWOOD. Revelry wakes in the dim halls of Lindenwood; Strange is the minstrelsy there to be heard; Long have they slumbered in silence and solitude, Haunted alone of the night-roving bird. Swells with its chorus the mirth-mingled banquet song, Fresh as the tide-lifted billows at playâ Why to the festal board comes not the bridal throng? Where, with his bride, doth the bridegroom delay? Lingering still, stands the lord of green Lindenwood, Waiting the bride, for her nuptials arrayed, Loth to be led from the bower of her maidenhood, Lady of lineage proud to be made. Silently there, at her portal, he listeneth: Gloweth his heart with a rapture inspired; While, in his glance, as a beacon-star, glisteneth Love with the flash of expectancy fired. Lo! is it she, in the moonlight, that beckoneth, Timing her step to the faint-flowing song? Nought but the spell of her presence he reckoneth, Flitting the intricate mazes along. Still from his touch like a shadow ethereal, Glideth she on, in the dim-veiling light, Till, as the torch, in a vapor funereal, Quenched is the wildering vision to sight! Hark! let the choral-song cease in old Lindenwood! Pray for a soul from life's revelry fled! High in her chamber, the shrine of her maidenhood, Pale as her bridal-wreath, lieth she, deadâ Mourn, let us mourn for the grey walls of Lindenwood, There, nevermore, be the minstrelsy heard: Leave them alone in their silence and solitude, Haunted again of the night-roving bird. DESTINY. âThe Stars above us govern our condition.ââ King Lear. Oft had a melancholy star, Of human aspect mild, In pensive vigil gazed upon A sleeping child, And whitened, as the wave of light Dispelled the vision from his sight. Behind the sun, disconsolate, The livelong summer day, In love and loneliness he sighed The hours away, Till roused from reverie to feel The twilight vapors o'er him steal. Night after night, all tremulous, Distraught, and paler grown, He saw, enamoured of the spell, That form alone, Nor found amid the realms of air A paragon of love so fair. âAlas!â and silently a tear The swelling thought betrayed, âForlorn, sweet child, my destiny Apart!â he said; âA phantom of perpetual night To woo thy slumbering orbs of light!â âLost in sublimity of space, Above the eternal snow, That clothes in raiment virginal The peaks below, In vain this rhapsody of sighs To lift the fringes of thine eyes.â âO, for some charm melodious! A seraph-toneâto sweep In throbbing syllables adown The tide of sleep, And with the conscious smile to raise Thy spirit to my wistful gaze!â He ceased: for, hark! a nightingale From dreams all passion-wrought, Wakes into song, interpreting The plaintive thought, Till, soft as lily petals white, The eyelids blossom with delight. And lo! the child in ecstacy Of reverence hath bent Upon the burning satellite His gaze intent, While blend in rapture of desire The mortal and immortal fire. Serene, but coldly beautiful, At dewy dawn of day, A moon-pale masterpiece of Death In marble lay, And o'er it, tremulously far, The splendor of the morning star. SYMPATHY. 'Tis in the silent isthmus-hour of time, Where light and darkness have alternate birth, And nature, in her agony sublime, Shrouds with a veil of mystery, the earth That, as a mist low-creeping through the gloom, A wandering shadow clasps a nameless tombâ All night the cypress sighs: the waning moon Sinks, pale with vigil, where the sun has set: The morning wakes; and, lo! an altar strewn,â A grave with deathless sympathy is wet. THE RHYME OF THE ROCK. Creation's morning broke upon my brow; The joyous sea, Baptized of light, as I behold it now, Encompassed me With all its breathing tides of voiceful majesty. The tender dawn, a virgin, blushed before The rising sun, And wrought of mist a folding mantle pure Her charms upon, When, lo! the quickening glance she fondly strove to shun. Swift rolled to noon the unaccustomed wheel, Then westward sped, Where, fain the kindling radiance to feel, Rich vapors spread Beneath their monarch's feet, and o'er his regal head. Then soft the budding crescent silvered through The twilight dim, And darkling to its full-blown splendor grew The burnished rim, While sang the choral waves a hoarse triumphal hymn. The circling years to centuries untold, As moments passed; Nor Time nor Death one dismal shadow cold Upon me cast: All earth and heaven reposed in calm communion vast. But Change, alas! on sudden pinions borne, With darkness fell; And blind Confusion, from the womb uptorn Of haggard Hell, Spun o'er the dizzy world that shrunk their alien spell. Then drifted, prone upon the devious main, Whose billows warm Plunged headlong with the wayward hurricane, A fragile form Untented to the elements that swayed the storm. The shudder of the thunder-bolt amazed The welkin wide; And, as in dumb bewilderment I gazed, The cloven tide Upheaved its burthen, motionless, upon my side. Ah! well-a-day! It was a maiden face, A brow that shone With the divine mortality and grace That Death aloneâ Pale sculptor!âgraves, in mockery, on human stone! âArt thou a child, sweet wanderer, of the sea, Or earth, or air? Whence comest thou,â I marveled, âunto me? What winged care Pursues a pathless voyager, so heavenly fair?â No voiceâno motionâfor the sea had done Its deed of death: The first pale victim to its vengeance won With briny breath The foam had stifled and the waves that writhe beneath! Had I but tears! Alas! my bosom cold, How rough to be Her resting place! No throb convulsive told Its agonyâ The dull imprisoned pain, unslaked, that wasted me! And here she lay. The dewy twilight wept Her woeful doom, While the perpetual breezes fragrant kept Her roofless tomb, Whence meteors of the night dispelled sepulchral gloom. And yonder light upon my summit setâ A beacon starâ Is tended of her watchful spirit yet, That, from afar, Warns the benighted sail that nears the harbor bar.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SONNETS. TO HIS EMINENCE CARDINAL NEWMAN. MAY 1879. Father;âfor loftier titles cannot hide The tenderness of thy paternity From eyes that turn with filial gaze to theeâ Sons of thy Faith across the ocean wide, Led of thy light from paths unsanctified, Thine own begotten, though unseen are we. Thy loss, thy gain, we count our own to be: And now our hearts exulting in the tide Of favors shed upon thee from the hand Whose grace outgrows its giving, fondly glow With more than silent syllables expressâ O, westward, as the sunshine, to our land Still let thy love, a light perpetual, flow, Thy children, bowed in reverence, to bless. EUGENIE. JUNE 1879. In exile, widowed, childless, desolate, Thou sittest in the majesty of woe, And nations gaze, with shuddering murmurs low, Upon the direful trilogy of Fate. Hushed are the warring interests of state Beneath the pall of Sorrow. Foes forego Their wonted discord, and with footsteps slow And meekened foreheads, move compassionate. All exiles weave their miseries with thine; All widows turn with sympathy to thee; All mothers, desolate and childless made, Mingle their moan with this thine agony: And yet, to thee the royal lot is laidâ Threefold the cross that measures love divine. COLUMBUS. 'Tis read of one, a ferryman of old, St. Christopher, who on his shoulders bore, Across the torrent to the welcome shore, The infant Christ. The alien waters rolled Their weltering weight tumultuous; but 'tis told The pilot swerved not 'mid the desperate roar, Till, landed safe, his tottering burden sore He trembled, lost in reverence, to behold. And thou, to me, in that prophetic dream, Which led thee westward o'er the wandering main, Christ-laden, to the land whereof no gleam Had cleft the compass of the narrower brain, The legendary Christopher dost seem, Fulfilling all his destiny again. SHAKESPEARE'S MOURNERS. I saw the grave of Shakespeare in a dream, And round about it grouped a wondrous throng, His own majestic mourners, who belong Forever to the Stage of Life, and seem The rivals of reality. Supreme Stood Hamlet, as erewhile the graves among, Mantled in thought: and sad Ophelia sung The same swan-dirge she chanted in the stream. Othello, dark in destiny's eclipse, Laid on the tomb a lily. Near him wept Dejected Constance. Fair Cordelia's lips Moved prayerfully the while her father slept, And each and all, inspired of vital breath, Kept vigil o'er the sacred spoils of death. YESTERDAY. As light on lids that slumber, warms unseen, So now, thy veiled presence breathing near, Soft penetrates the web of darkness drear, That Night, the grim Arachne, weaves between Wan Twilight and her roseate sister-queen, Imperial Dawn. Behold how many a tear (Pale records of immortal memory dear) Attests thy wonted influence serene! And, lo! the winged moments, one by one, Foreshadowed of the ages yet to be, Upon the bleak horizon where the sun Tinges the mist of dim futurity, Beholding here thy glimmering footsteps gone, Speed through the trackless interval to thee. AD MONTEM. I lift mine eyes, and lo! impetuous tears Bedim them, as the tides of thought o'erflow The soul's expansion. On thy peaks of snow, Above the boreal revel, Nature hears The chorus of the night-enkindled spheres Roll westward, while their flickering torches grow Like phantoms, in the orient's warmer glow, Ere yet the Dawn's imperial crest appears. But on thy deep foundations slumber Night And everlasting Silence. 'Tis their dream Alone that lingers when the darkness wanes; Amid the ephemeral seasons' bloom and blight, When earth and sky and ocean changeful seem, That sovereign Calm inviolate remains. TO AN ANCIENT LUTE. As one who on the precincts of a shrine, Treads softly, lest his footfall, echoing there, Profane the cloistered solitude of prayer, So, reverence stays this venturous hand of mine, Upon the brink of sound. Lo! themes divine, Hushed of the folding silence, everywhere, Upon the drowsy bosom of the air, Around thy form, oblivious recline: O, bid me wake them! Let me call again, Thy latest bornâthe last whose lingering sigh Sank, as departing Genius retired, Into the mist of slumber. Hark, a train Of Echoes, heralding the anthem high! Prepare, my soul, to greet the strain inspired. AT ST. HELENA. The Night encamps around thee. From afar, The bannered hosts of outer darkness throng, And crested billows shout their battle song To greet the dreadful summoner of war. The throbbing bursts of molten thunder jar The firmament: and lo! the mountains strong Are livid with the lightning's leprous tongue, As nations smit of some malignant star! What spirit wroth, from Erebos uptorn, Is launched upon the laboring tempest wide? Is it the Captive Conqueror's, forlorn, His late avenging destiny defied?â Who laughed?âor was it but the seething scorn Of Ocean kindled at the dream of pride? THE PASCHAL MOON. Thy face is whitened with remembered woe; For thou alone, pale satellite, didst see, Amid the shadows of Gethsemane, The mingled cup of sacrifice o'erflow; Nor hadst the power of utterance to show The wasting wound of silent sympathy, Till sudden tides, obedient to thee, Sobbed, desolate in weltering anguish, low. The holy night returneth year by year, And while the mystic vapors from thy rim Distil the dews, as from the Victim there The red drops trickled in the twilight dim, The ocean's changeless threnody we hear, And gaze upon thee as thou didst on Him. ENGADDI. Hail, trackless waste! a heart made desolate Speeds from a sterner solitude to thee! O, let me, lost in contemplation, be Among thy children numberedâat the gate Of Mercy, meekly pleading, still to wait, With lifted eye and penitential knee, The silent herald of Eternityâ The swift, relentless messenger of Fate! Heaven weeps not here o'er man's ingratitude, Where, from the heart perpetual fountains flow; But Love, in cloudless majesty revealed, Sustains the soul with Hope's celestial food, Till, life to Life, the flame supernal grows, And dust to dust the parting spirit yield. TO MY LAMP. Companion of my vigil, silently, At midnight, when the voiceful world is still, Alone with me thou watchest. Peaceably Thy radiance stems the darkened tide and chill That floods the outer prospect. On thy ray Night's foamless torrent breaks not, but retires As from a charmed circle, far away, To glooms beyond. E'en so, Promethean fires, Within my throbbing temples, fed of pain, Resist the powers around themâwild desires, Fevered of passion, as the troubled main That slumbers not. Thy task with morn expires, But nought to me of respite brings the day, Till life is wasted, as thine oil, away.</field>
