      <field name="fulltext">Chaque vertu devient une divinite. âBoileau. TO William Cullen Bryant, Esq. AS A FEEBLE TESTIMONY TO HIS TALENTS, AND IN ADMIRATION OF HIS GENIUS, THIS VOLUME IS DEDICATED. SONNET. In vain the bard will ride on wings of fire, And glowing fancy guide his flaming path, In vain he wields the sabre of his wrath, If lovely truth cannot a ray inspire; The meteor dazzles in its gleaming ire, And crimson havoc flies upon its trail, But beauty smiles, and bids the planet hail! That glows, but lights not vestal nature's pyre. The bard may stand, like Nero, o'er the flame That wrapt in ocean-blaze imperial Rome, And strike his lyre to yelling myriads' doom, But virtue, honour, execrate his name. Though others stand on towering Helicon, And flush in glorious lyric victory, Religion, virtue, truth, are paths for me, Though a vile molehill be the fane that's won. âOH THAT THE DESERT WERE MY DWELLING PLACE.â 'T was thus of yore the Minstrel sung, When wo was rankling in his breast, But oh! extatic beauty flung A veil o'er grief, and he was blest; For me no ray of pleasure gleams, No seraph smiles, no hope appears, Dark, dark, lone Sorrow haunts my dreams, And Misery blasts my orient years. Oh! he who sighs had once a heart, That beat responsive unto glee, But Fateâah! noâMan sped the dartâ Hope withered in its revelry:â Affection wrungâthe heart's deep core Rentâcankered by misfortune's bane,â The aspic's venom in each poreâ Who would not quit this scene of pain? Caressed, deserted, lauded, curstâ Met with a smile, and then a sneerâ From friendship comes the rapier thrust, And blooming love and faith are sear; And fiends have long beset my path In cherub-robes, but demon hue. But virtue scorns their vaunted wrath, And worth appals their covert view. Time was, when hope flew smiling by, When waved Love's pinions on the breeze, When tranquil breathed the bright blue sky, And rustled green the laurel-trees: In sooth, then rung my roundelay, O'er mead, and pure waves hyaline, My descant then was blithe, but nayâ The contrast wrings this heart of mine! Grief cries, our life's a bitter boon; Love is the nuncio of despair, Youth smiles in beautyâbut too soon Vengeance awakes from misery's lair! The long dark lashes of the lid Secrete an eye, whose glance is flame, Deep, deep, within corroding, hid, A spirit burns, no power can tame. O'er mirth's unruffled lineament Grief fiercely drives her redhot share, Each feature's now by smiles unbent, And ebon-throned sits fell despair; Oh once as blithe as mountain-roe, Bright skies were childhood's canopy, Now tainted is each breeze with wo, And scorching is my panoply. Around the halo of my prime Misfortune winds her sable shroud, And brambles throng the mount I climb, And threat'ning lowers the sulph'rous cloud; The thunderstorm of Fate hath broke, And blasted fortune's shrivelled reed, And I have quailed beneath the strokeâ Nemesis will avenge the deed. Beneath the ornate vestment's glow, Lurk thoughts no mortal ear can learn, Dark dash the lava floods of wo, Ah! fiery billows roll and burn; The mimic smile, like osprey's wing, Hides the deep death-wound of our fate, The dying swan doth music fling, On Nature's ear inanimate! The pensive reverie cannot soothe Demoniac agony's dire thrill, Nor pleasure fill the void of youth, That loves to tread the greenwood hill; The leafless wilderness of soul, Where e'en hath died the shrubbery, Sighs not o'er nature's direst dole, But gazes in stern apathy. In Naxian bowers, in Daphne's grove, Where fairy nymphs in wanton mood, Perfume the pinions of blithe Love, And beauty charm'd the solitude, On her velvet roseous bed, Ariadne smiling lay; While phantom cherub-minstrels sped, In blooming coronals of bay. But ah! an asp, with venom sting, Unheeded stole upon her breastâ And now Elysium's withering, The flowery mansion of the blest. And thus, beneath a cold world's frown, The sympathetic soul expires, Nor ocean-flood could whelming drown The hopeless heart's corroding fires. O I have known our life's extremes, Elate with rapture, merged in woâ Lured by fancy's fitful beams, And scorch'd by passion's fiery glow. And Iâwhat boots it now to tell The woes that madden manhood's brain? No tongue will notes of pleasure swell, No hand assuage my writhing pain. Life is a mighty masquerade, Conflicting scene of varied woes; We enter on the promenade, And toil awhile, and greet the close; The phantom sprites that cross our way, The gilded visions that beguile, The glittering pageants light that play, Allure us onâforsakeâand smile. O, that the desert were my home! Cerulean skies would list the tale Of bitter griefâand I should roam No more, nor hear lone sorrow's wail; Then man no more would desecrate His heaven-born powers in calumny, And I no more indulge a hate, That's nurtured now by misery. The magic landscape, woodland green, Romantic grove, and blushing mead, Where nature winds her mantling screen, And rural minstrel tunes his reed, The chequered shade, the sylvan bower, The green wood's tinted drapery, Would soothe the minstrel's vigil hour, And shield him with their tapestry. Beneath the bright blue sky's arcade, From flowery arbour, oh! my gaze Would hang upon the stream's cascade, Gemmed by the sun's long-lingering rays; And when the twilight melts away, The pensive-pleasing queen of night In beauty, through the milky way, Impels the charioteer of light. On every crannied cliff sublime, On every roscid emerald spray, Below, the rill's symphonious chime, The feathered minstrels wake their lay; The lark aloft in hymnic strain, With carols hails the orient sun, And Philomela's starry reign Brings spirits down, by music won. And o'er yon isles, where dwell the blest, Hesperian groves of myrtle spread, And Tempe's vales, once fondly prest By her, beneath whose wanton tread All Nature sprung to living bloom, Wane in their pride, compar'd with fields Where glory gilds the reckless tomb, And death a heav'nly pathway yields. Alas! the thrills of rapture thwart Their own devotionâwane, expireâ The ray that sports around the heart, Is but an ignis-fatuus fire; The mists, that fled at Phosphor's glow, And melted from the ruby heaven, Condense in clouds of noon, that throw Their sheeted flame athwart the even. Sweet on the jocund ear of youth, Aerial strains of music float, But spurns the Ãolian harp their truth, And feeling strikes a different note; We quit the arena of dire strife, But flee in Tisiphone's pall; We writheâand wringâand curse the life For ever twined with sorrow's thrall. So Fancy cheats us of our wo, Perchance an hour of bitter pain, But ah! she sends a rush-light glow O'er cells, where gloom and darkness reign; The desert void of love and soul, Man cannot fillâby tempests driven, We hope and quake, court peace, and roll,â Nor cease until we rest in heaven. CANZONET. O tell me not of frantic hours, That follow pleasure's tread; Nor deck the amaranthine bowers, For hearts, whose ardour's fled. Display no more the festive mirth, When darkness draws her veil, For revel teems with hideous birth, Blasphemous cries, diseases pale. The hell-kite flaps her raven wing, And fiends ride on the gale, Infernal choirs exulting sing, And tramp the burning vale. The dome, where thousand ideots wait To feast their souls with mimicry, The scenes that worldly hearts dilate, Dispand no luring charms for me. The swelling notes that peal along The vaulted roof of majesty, The choir, that chant the sacred song, And raise the soul to ecstasy; The embowering groves of solitude, Where crystal waters chiming flow, Where the mind in pensive mood Hangs on the scenes of heavenly glow; Alone are joys that swell my breast, And fan devotion's fire, Charms, that blazon virtue's crest, And tune an angel's lyre. Like the vapours that expand A limpid stream, o'er Afric's plain, Deluding e'er the wretch, whose hand, Grasps the shade, and finds it pain; The fickle god of pleasure rears The joyous cup of revelry, But ah! the chalice swims with tears Wrung from the eye of agony. The barbed dart of black despair, Twanged from the bow of madness, Will pierce the bosom debonair, And rankle in its sadness. Then wish me, O, a lone recess, Where scenes illusive fade, Where smiles the seraph happiness, Irradiate through the glade. There contemplation will survey The jasper fields of light, And pleasure through the live-long day Will wear her vestments bright. There will we twine a living wreath To parted friendsâand be forgiven, Imbibe the glowing Spirits' breath, And make our bosomâheaven. CANTICLE. The Monarch Minstrel swept along his glory-breathing lyre, And mute were peopled walks; above hung the celestial choir; He mourned the apostate renegade, and Nature o'er his urn, Amid the cypress grove, leaned musingly, a father's love to learn. Zion and Hermon smiled with love, and beauty linger'd o'erâ Carmel hung list'ningâSharon bloomed, and Siloe's pearly shore Heard echo tread, with tinkling feet, the flowery dale of Palestine, While the cherub throned Shechinah gleamed with dazzling rays divine. But myrtle, cassia, willow-groves sigh to those strains no more, For lone, and sad sounds pilgrim tread on Jordan's desert shore, And started coils the aspic lord, as human shadows flit Across the pathless plain, where wrath the fires of Justice lit. Vengeance bared the gory arm, and prostrate lay the battlement, The sovereign drove his burning carâhushed was revel's merrimentâ Crackling roof and pillar fell, and ocean-flames were curled Around Moriah's godlike fane, and glory thence was hurled. The vollied blast in havoc ragedâwide rolled the dark red floodâ Wild Famine stalked in frantic wrath, with all her maddened brood; The quailing, shuddering yell arose loud o'er the tombless dead, And, with his red neck clothed in thunder, shook the courser's tread. Ages have fled in time's career, but Mockery's held her reign O'er moss-grown walls, and sunken gate, o'er palace, and bright fane, Where bitterns shriek mid ruins, and the fierce hyenas howl, Where satyrs dance, and vultures teem, and hoots the solemn owl. But hark! o'er Salem's broken shrines, o'er Judea's olive grove, The slumbering lyre of ages breathes mellifluous notes of love; And, O Columbia! thou art blest, who first awoke the strain Thy zealous Angel Angel, messenger, missionary. will prolong o'er many a blooming plain. Lord of bright mercy and of love! thy Chosen will return, And from the mosque the minaret no more shall flaming burn; Sinai's thunders will be hushedâthe Iris of Salvation Blend its hues with Judah's star, and Nature bow in adoration. RELIGION. AN ALCAIC ODE. Pure ray of love divine, That brightly gilds the mirrored wave of time, Deign in my breast to shine, And tune the soul to harmony sublime! In labyrinthine maze The terrene feelings are for ever lost, Till Piety's bright rays Blazon the gloom, where mind's tumultuous tost. The cloister's dreary cell, Where Superstition kindles wanton fires, And strikes the dirge, and knell Of holy love, that thrills the warbling wires; Or, gay saloons, where pride, Displays with mirthful pomp its grand eclat, Or, where the passions ride, Like whirlwinds, when the murky tempests draw Their clouds along the sky; Or, domes, where mimic love, or, madness reign, And wrought to ecstasy, With fancied bliss, or agonizing pain, Attention silent hangs On every look, or gesture, sad or wild, And feels fictitious pangs, That rack the breast by sensual love beguiled; Or, yet the splendid hall, Where folly in her frolic pranks too light, Swings through the mazy ball, Nor leaves much myst'ry for the festal night; Religion ne'er illumes. Her flights are not the visions of a brain Wrapt in monastic glooms, Her steps ne'er press the flowers of the plain, Where aspics throng the rose; Her glory's not th' ephemeral charms that rise, When midnight revel throws His frantic mirth upon the darkling skies. Sublimer is her path Sketched with the pencil of celestial glow; No wild and madd'ning wrath Strews victims round and loves the purple flow; Soft, placid, and serene, Each feature seems the counterpart of Heav'n, Though pensive be the mien, By no tornado is the bosom riv'n. The luring scenes of mirth Suit not the tenor of her even way. 'Tis but the charms of worth On which her smile will lingering delay; For, hope, on golden wing, And starry plumes, awaits her gentle hest And faith doth incense bring From bright Elysium radiate and blest. To Israel's royal Bard, In sorrow's thrall, her silvery shield she gave, And waved the rich reward, To deck his hoary head beyond the grave. No pleasure is denied That suits the soaring majesty of mind, The futile vaunts of pride The low-born, grovelling, and base senses bind; When, 'mid the galaxy, The starry host in blended splendour gleam, The Heaven-directed eye Sees worlds, that well a stainless soul beseem. Thence she directs its flight To where the Empyrean burns sublime, Where angels, robed in light, Wake high devotion with harmonious chime; Or, pensive pleasures sweet Attend the holy, Heaven-descended maid, Where waning glories greet The western skies, and beaming light has paid Its full diurnal debt; Can no mild pleasure soothe the aching breast, Nor musing comfort yet, When life's last billow laves the realm of rest? Religion wears a smileâ 'Tis not the laugh of bacchanalian swine, Nor yet the leer of guile; It is the sweet enchanting glow divine, Cheerful, not airy swell Of grateful joy to earth's indulgent King; What tongue can ever tell The fragrant charms such beams of mercy bring? O! lovely ray of light Pure from the bosom of the Lord supreme, Irradiate my sight, And warm my heart with fire of seraphim! When mortal sorrows rise, And blast the pleasures of a joyous heart, O point me to yon skies, Where holy joys eternal peace impart; Nor let me grief repress, 'Till mind shall canker with the bane it bears, 'Till none remain to bless, And none, whom blessing, would assuage my cares. But, oh! when fortune smiles, And earth is robed in most attractive hues, Display sin's covert wiles, And point the vision in its wand'ring views; An asp 'neath roseous bed Will shed its poison ere the sting is known, And fancy oft has bred Visions, for which e'en life could not atone, Then, O Religion pure! Be thou my balm when grief inflicts the wound, Though sorrow will endure, Mem'ry of worth will waft perfumes around. When glowing days shall dawn, Direct my vision to the source of good; And when my thread is drawn, May glory be my theme and praise my luscious food. IDEAL BEAUTY. Autumnal twilight lingered o'er The pearly bed of ocean's stream, And dimly flung around the shore The dull expiring solar beam, That dwelt awhile to mark the track Of the full sun's refulgent glow, While waning glories, rolling back, Illumine all the vale below. O how I love from towering height To see the sunbeams melt away, When jarring winds have sped their flight, And lights, receding, dimly play Upon the clear wave tranquilly; Then mem'ry ushers long-lost dreams, Clothes airy forms with many a die, And spreads around extatic beams. The heart and soul with love expand When thought flies back on objects dear, A soft delight, and beauty bland Steal o'er the mind, and brightly wear Vestures, that charm when fancy reigns, And other seasons gilded throng; Alas! bright reason never deigns To sanction half the poet's song. O incense breathed in every breeze, When youth was sporting on with love, The vista still can sadly pleaseâ It oft recalls the absent dove, That raised its soul-delighting strain, Or warbled forth the tender sigh, Soothing the heart of wo and pain With pure and dulcet melody. See! evening lingers on yon height, And balmy breezes waft perfume From flowers, that scent the robe of night, And spread afar their glowing bloom, To deck the woodland's vermeil bowers, Where oft is heard the woodnote wild Soft stealing o'er the vesper hours, To charm the ear of fancy's child. The ideal shades of beauty bring Visions, that wo will oft beguile, Dreams often wake the warbling string, And shed an animated smile O'er the sad mien, that woes depress; But oh! my Marietta's voice My saddest sorrows could repress, And cause my senses to rejoice. But where art thou? In skies serene; The sapphire walks resound the tread Of thy infantile footâthe scene Throws a bright halo round the head Of beauty, robed in living light; Pellucid, amber streams along O'er golden sands roll ever bright, And murmur sweet their undersong. Ah! can immortal spirits view, From heaven's bespangled portals high, The grovelling friends, who oft renew The sad lament, and heave the sigh? Can mind such rapt'rous converse hold, And shed on earth an Eden's bloom, Or, linger on those streets of gold, Nor pass the vale, nor heed the tomb? Alas! that monumental stone, Amid the lonely-weeping willows, Points out the path of life alone, Through deep affliction's stormy billows. Yet thou, my charm, my earthly heaven, Nor sin, nor grief, nor sorrow knew, To thee alone the palm was given, Ere yet the battle-trumpet blew. And now, when years have rolled away, And the gale sighs o'er beauty's dust, Imagination brings the day When tender chords of love were burst; On the dim mirrored wave of time Affection pure delights to dwell, And by the rill's symphonious chime List airy strains, that rise and swell. Yon levant crescent's silvery glow Sheds a pure light along the sky, And, as the curling breezes blow, It gems the stream of emerald die; And bright'ning, as the sheeted blaze Fades on the western skies of blue, The lunar beams through rack and haze Glitter o'er gilded dales of dew. So blithesome scenes of earthly bliss Fly, marshalled in the train of time, The melting shade receives a kiss, And seeks afar a better clime; While pensive mem'ry o'er the scene Of blasted joys hangs, fondly dwelling, And time and distance, prone to wean, Roll on the tide, the current swelling. Vivific phantoms cheer the soul, As cresset lights the wand'rer's way, The brightest beams of glory roll From the dun scatt'ring clouds of day; The glowing woodbine loves the shade, And flings perfume through brambles rude, And heaven's most holy esplanade Is nature's silent solitude. O sainted shade! the sacred haunt Of cheerless hours thy grave shall be, Nor shall my glowing spirit vaunt A nobler guerdon oh! than thee, A form to me beyond compare; But oft thine ear will catch a groan, Or, heart-fraught sigh for one so fair, Or yet, a lyric benison. Thou wert as calm as this mild eve, When nature smiles to view her form, Thou wert as pure as dews, that give Effulgence to the rose of morn; From purity thy spirit rose To realms as sheen as yon bright sky, Where glory o'er devotion throws An etherial ecstasy. O could I mount on wings sublime, Or tread the wavy floods of light, My lyre would charm the ear of time, And warble strains of high delight; Then would I seek some quiet shore Sacred to thee and lovely Eve, Then mirth should grate my soul no more, And blighted love no longer grieve. THELYPHTHORA. She was the guerdon of a mother's yearsâ The lovely, artless, pure Elviraâtears Unconscious when she sighed at some sad tale, Bedewed the manly cheekâand when all wan and pale Her mien, and red her brimming eye, The adamantine heart would melt, and spy The noiseless, but triumphal reign of love, Whose sway, unable to repel, it did approve. The extatic flame through each wild trembling nerve Wrought thrills of rapture, until nought could swerve The revelling, abstracted gazeâraptured thought Would sketch in fancy all that charms, but ought Of its creation, like the crescent's beams Before the full meridian sun, whose gleams Illume earth, was lost in bright reality. On earth a paragonâI saw the nymph Glide, like the cygnet on translucent lymph; Or, like a Naiad on the crystal lake, While from the coral wave each pearly flake Was glittering in the sunbeams: o'er the lawn Of roseate flowers, Aurora of the dawn; Love and the graces chased her airy tread, And drew their radiance from her deep-blue eye; Remorseless guile and sensual flatt'rers fled Her pure cherubic presence, destiny Had thrown her panoply around herâworth And innocence, the rather, mused, that all In man was nature's fairest, noblest birth; And mortals, like herself, above the thrall Of reckless and lascivious mirth; yet Frantic pleasure lingered around her path, And laid her toils illusiveâand beset The guileless victim with phrenetic wrath; The viper, unknown, near her bosom lay, And flung its baneful poison in the heart Of youth, and innocence and beautyâyea In the deep core fell misery's barbed dart. A magic charm enthroned her marble brow, And raven ringlets, o'er her neck of snow, Waved in their pride, like aerial fays, Diana's train in Daphne, whose chaste lays, Symphonious, breathed the notes of love; she trod The smiling mead with winning graceâthe sod Shed forth an exquisite perfume beneath Her dew bespangled footâand her pure breath Lent auxiliar fragrance to the breeze of morn; And O, the damask-rose upon its thorn Spread not to nature more attractive hues, Than all her blending charms; Arcadian dews Fell not more light, nor brighter gilded fields Where Cytherea roved; honied Hybla yields Not richer stores; but unobtrusive souls Sway voiceless in their sphere; the amulet controls Stern destiny, yet lies beneath the vest, Whose varied folds enshroud the Druid's breast; The massive wheels of empire roll, and earth Obeys the viewless power that guides; their birth The glorious energies of time and light, Of worlds, and systems, hierarchy bright, And sentient animation, owe to Him, Who dwells in majesty, but far and dim, Above idea, in unrecounted state; Yet whose least nod is the decree of Fate. She loved the bowering arbour, and would gaze From the flower-twined lattice, when the rays Of noon delicious grottos crowned, and played With fervour o'er the full tapestried shade; And she would catch the last long-lingering beams Of solar glory, and in waking dreams With measured, solemn pace, through Paradise Would rove, enamoured of the laughing skies, Herself as bright and pure; and swelling strains Of minstrelsy came floating o'er the plains, When the gay songsters of the grove did wing Their bower-ward flight, and dulcet carols sing Amid the tufted blossoms of the grot, Nor leave on the parterre a tainting blot. In sooth, she was a lovely nymphâand wore A heart, that would beseem a brighter shore, Where whelming billows break notâand pure truth And loveliness arrayed the mind of youth With blissful charmsâbut forms of earthly mould Attract to ruinâthe fair flower, unrolled, Too oft is shivered by the ruthless blastâ Nor doth it, like the mimosa twined fast With every fibre round the unbending stalk, Shield its own glory, when the tempests walk Upon the loud tornado; to repel The dire assault, the harbinger of hell, The soulless libertine; religion's shield Must hang around the virginâshe must wield The dread falchion of virtueânor despair If hell's unpeopled, and the tainted air Is loaded with exulting demonsâthe hand Of faith will send the fell, but pow'rless band, With fury back to their own dungeonâthere To writhe in tenfold hotter flamesâand where, Nor worm shall cease to gnaw, nor fires to burn, Stern justice doomed their mansion, past return To glory and to life. Alas! the soul Of sweet Elvira, formed though in the mould Of heaven, deigned not piety's control. She had been nursed in virtue,âhad unrolled The volume graved by Deityâbut the wave Of cool Bethesda had ne'er laved her heart; And she found no warm bosom for a grave, But one,âcold,âdrear,âforsaken,âfar apart. She loved and was belovedâdisease obeyed Her lenient hand; as bending o'er she stood, Like some bright angel of cherubic grade, Heaven's messenger of love to man, the mood Of feverish, and insensate madness fled, And quiet sleep, a banquet to the frame Tortured and scorched, o'er wearied senses sped; A mother's benison upon the name Of her attendant child oft caught her ear, And at each start, and groan, she would attend The reckless, restless sleeper, and would wear An unruffling softness as she did bend O'er her; while the full crystal tear her eye In sweet, heavenly sympathy bedewed; And when, with a long-drawn, and heart-fraught sigh, The parent awoke, and her slow pulse shewed, The fond caress, and glowing fervour shed A dazzling beauty o'er each feature bright With an extatic passion from heaven bred; And sketched the picture of a child's delight. She was the portraiture of all that lives, And banquets in the warmest heartâbut charms All unadorned, and by herself unprized, For mind vaunts not fair clayâbut rather strives To shield its powers, had flung (alas! love warms But cankers oft the heart, that is surprized, And stung to madness, unappeased but by The ruin of fair name and chastened worth; For the fell simoom is the lustful eye, And irreligion teems with stygian birth;) A fatal fascination round her, and Engendered deep infernal stores of wrath. The dread hour cameâreason fellâmis'ry's brand Pierced the heart's recessâand across her path Flew the red lightningâshe was desolate. The fairest flowers are soonest blightedâchaste Woman's honour fallsâand dies for ayeâfate Drops the black curtainâand the scene is past. TO MYRRHA. O dost thou seek to know why mirth Harsh grates upon my soulâ Dost fondly ask, why joyous earth, And all its charms, like vapours roll? Perchance thou'st seen the wand'rer tread O'er lawns, where flowers embalm the gale, While caustic lightnings vengeance shed, Deep thunders burst and woodlands wail. The cresset gleams through forests far, But points the startled pilgrim's way O'er marshes, fens, and thorns, that war With every step towards safety's ray. Dost think, my love, the wanderer stoops To cull the flowers while terrors fly, As the gaunt vulture rapid swoops With fury to his revelry? Toils he to weave a bridal wreath, Twines he the amorous gay festoon, While o'er the nuptial couch stern death Terrific bends, and blights his boon? Alas! where nature dictates gives, Wisdom and truth attend our path; Where reckless, wanton pleasure strives With heaven, burst the bolts of wrath. The maudlin hall, the sportive dance, Blasphemous jeer, ignoble vaunt, Before him spread a dire expanse, Whose mandates high his wild soul daunt. Cheered by the light, for errors sad, The distant rays e'er fire his eye, Till, veiled in raptures ever glad, Hope blooms in bright reality. The breathings of the ardent soul To brighter worlds are given, Where purest streams of glory roll Amid the golden walks of heaven. THE GRECIAN CROSS. âEt a chi ferma in contra i suoi vestigi, Per lui del corso tuo la fama aggiunge.ââ Tasso. From Pyle's proud brow the bright banner waves, And Freedom her crest in ThermopylÃ¦ rears, And silver-tinged Salamis the battlement laves, Where the Genius of Glory the red panoply wears, Whose sheeny effulgence, mid battle and war, Shed a glittering halo round the patriot's path; While cuirass and morion, from the thunderer's car, Shot the flames of destruction o'er the dread falchion's wrath. The green-turbaned Emir sheaths his ataghatan, For the crescent is hurled from the glory-crowned arch, And dark frowning Destiny 'neath her imperial ban Hath laid Paynim prowess in victorious march; The minaret shivers on the proud trophied mosque, O'er fragile Al-Sirat Al-Siratâthe bridge that, in Mahommedan Pneumatology, leads to Paradise. rings the votaries' tread Of the prophet's dark Houris,âthey leave the Kiosk The gory symar Symarâa shroud. of the Mussulmaun dead. O Freedom her Sparta, 'mid Thracia's drear wild, With human-girt battlements of victory builds, And her lone craggy mountains, in majesty piled, Rear a monument to shades, that glory's beam gilds, And will blazon, when pyramids, where diadems rust, Shall scatter their fragments, and unhallowed be trod; But the laurel-wreathed warrior from his prison will burst O'er the death-circled field, and the blood-reeking sod. The fierce Janizar wields his powerless brand, And his false comboloio Comboloioârosary. cons the desp'rate vizier And in vain rings the tophaike Tophaikeâmusket. o'er ocean and strand, For dim is the vision when the bright banner's near; In the harem no more dark-haired almas Almasâthe beauties of the Seraglio. give zest To the vine-crowned board of Miramolin supreme, The usher Meuzzin cries amaun to the blest, And red are the fires that round revelry gleam. But fays, fauns, and dryads on Peneus play, And age-slumb'ring Tempe awakens again In renovate bloom, when the lyre's magic lay Breathes the wild tones of freedom, and the conqueror's strain; Rich Arcadia smiles, and the Cyclades spread Their bright golden wings round the clime of renown, And Hymettus his sweet honied treasures will shed O'er Morea, ransomed Grecia's glory and crown. O'er the tombs of her tyrants the bright cross shall wave, O'er the Dey's shroudless corse the armada sails, O'er Moslem destruction the pÃ¦an of the brave Shall be echoed by Sirocco, when it mournfully wails Mid grandeur's drear ruins; but AstrÃ¦a resumes Her untrophied mansion, and her wand will control. For the bright Star of Judah the long night illumes, And the sunbeams of glory cheer the ethnical soul. THRENODY. Who has not known in being's lonely hour An aching void of pleasure and of soul? When friendship, love, and beauty lose their charms, And dark creation's scanned with baleful eye; When joy, or grief, or love, or hate, is lost In the mind's starless desolation; when Edens odoriferous shed unprized perfume, And all the beauty-crowned habitants seem Ruin's pestiferous harpies; when clouds Of blackness shroud the empyreal throne Enamelled but with scathing fires of wrath. Balm is shed on adamant, for the soul Shrinks from perceptionâunallured, unwrought By all that's lovely, to unveil the gloom Of its mis'ry terribleâdark, dormant, Desolate, as slumbering chaos, ere Creation's choral hymn, when raven time Spread his fleet pinions to the pauseless blast, Awoke the emulgent empyreuma, And, with ethereal worth, and symmetry, Buried volcanic fires, whose quenchless flames Pour hottest lava o'er the hopeless breast. Can ought, decked in the world's habiliments, Awake, and renovate, or bright beams shed Through the drear palace of the sunless soul? Pleasure! assay thy vaunted magic powers, Proclaim thine orgies bacchanal, and wear The veilless robes of mirth; no chalice, Brimming with luxurious bane, forbear; Hold grasping dalliance with each wanton form That flits across thy path, and oh! invoke The sable shield of hell to consecrate Thy hall, and hang a dreadless battlement Around thee! The heart is lone, sick, and sad, Amid the full hilarity of mirth; The flushed cheek, and red eyeball's glare, unlike The rosy-winged morn, are but the fires That canopy the thunderboltâportend The death-encircled tornado, and shroud The daring, and heroic wanderer. Descend, Nemesis, blighted honour shield, Avenge thy votary, and in crimson gore Unstain polluted dignity; sabres Flash in battle's glory, and gild the shrine Of a proud nation's grandeur; and the din Of havoc is unheeded, when the world Derives her freedom from ensanguined fields; But, when the hands, that fondly clasped in youth, Wield demons' falchions; when the bosoms, That throbbed with fondest love, are bared to dye The gory shaft; when the once mingling breath Of friendship taints the impassioned fury. Of unhallowed wrath; indignation walks The welkin, deep and endless shame attends The bloodhoundâheaven and earth's anathema. O sapient reason! from thy earth-girt throne Wield the imperious sceptre of dominion, And recall the golden visions of the pride, And dignity of man, that scorns to crouch, And stoop to morbid mental gloom: paint scenes That stretch beyond the future's sable veil With glowing fancy's crayon, and awake The soul unconscious of primeval worth, Can fitful rays through the deep dungeon's grate Illume the darkness of the felon's cell? Or will it rather point the straining eye To solitude forlorn, and visible? Rise, O fancy! wave thine airy pinions! Enamoured graces float along thy track; Love sheds emollient powers, and o'er the mind Holds sway unrivalled; lo! the heart dilates, The soul, enchanted, lights the lowering gloom, And lucid splendour glows upon the mien. Alas! the evanescent, and ephem'ral glare Was but the flash, that lit the dun, dark night, Which lowers the deeper for the gilded guile. Strike, O Music, heaven-descended maid! The thrilling wires of the symphonious lyre, Wake the soul's celestial harmonies, and thrill Each trembling fibre, and responsive nerve, Till pealing anthems vaulted roofs rebound, And e'en the walls seem bending o'er to hear. Like fabled ethnic libertines, who stand Immerged in floods, that lave the sacred shore, And view the embowering groves, and hear the choir Angelic tune their golden lyres, and raise Their heavenly notes till the empyrean rings With melody ethereal, and pÃ¦ans grand, But ne'er can mingle with the votive throng; So sinks the heart, whose youthful accents breathed Philanthropy and sweet adoration Unmingled with a thought unholy, or Unheeding, to the Sovereign of all worlds; But mangled by the wretch, whose impious name Shall live in infamy, or forgotten sink To its own native nothingness, each core Is petrified, and made the dread abode Of dissocial, hopeless, rayless misery. The beauty tunes her harp, the bard his lyre Of pleasure, and the hero winds the trump Of gloryânot for him, if pleased in life, Most happy with the muse of his sad strains, With misery fraught, and not misanthropy. Nor wealth, nor pomp, nor power, a moment gild Of life's delirious turmoil; mind toils, Hearts freeze, hands grasp, love flies, and worth expires; Still the insatiate thirst's unslaked for gold. Some human souls are an odious compound Of clay and foul corruption; and the flame Of holiness lives and burns like the torch In hydrogen; the heartless recusant, Who knows no God but self, no charm but earth, No breeze propitious, but whose pinions waft The treasures of a world to him, enjoys His little dayâand diesâand leaves a gilded curse Behind him. Then be his pathway mine, When the soul divests itself of being, And clay reigns empress over kindred worms. Come philosophic wisdom, then, unfurl Thy sable vestments, and unroll thy lore, And loose thy learned stole, and soothe the wretch, Whose joys are blasted by a graceless worldâ âStem mountain billows when the lurid sky And quaking earth are blendingâsteer thy bark In the rude tempest's wake, and hope for peace,â Is all the solace Pallas yields to man. But lo! on Zion-hill a banner waves, And radiant glories beam, and bliss-crowned choir Invoke the effulgent Deity, and wear The jewelled diadems of paradise, And wave the embossed censer of perfume, And tune the hallowed cymbal to his praise. And there the pilgrims of earth's troublous way Shout their triumphal hymnâthe anthem high Of pure, unsullied, grand, unbondaged state. Faith's halcyon and undazzled mien shall glow In full fruitionâHope, on golden wings, Shall mingle with the lauding hosts around Jehovah's veilless throne, where Messiah With mien extatic and benign, shall reign In majesty and love, through boundless space. For earth religion has descended, crowned With the unseen glory of the Being Whose dazzling mien was veiled in darkness erst On high; she is our guardian angel O'er this vast, trackless, desart of despair; She heals the wound, where rankle sorrow's shafts, And o'er the heart pours Gilead's sacred balm.

FAREWELL. The refluent sun flung his mantle of gold O'er childhood's cloud-wrapt mountain, And his bright tinged full tapestry rolled O'er the crystal chiming fountain; And there when the green waving meadows expanded Beneath the fond eye, and the dell, Where the rose, vermillion, and woodbine were banded, Echo caught our last, long farewell! And its tones seemed the requiem of all that was fair, The notes of the funeral dirge, The shriek of the dying that had loaded the air, When had broken the reef-mounting surge; O! how mutely we hung on the scenes that were glowing With the tints of our magical day! And the rill, where we sported in youth, was flowing, And tinkling the sorrowful lay. Ere the last fond grasp was relinquished for ever, The pale crescent gleamed in the sky, And silent we sat in the high bower, our hearts could not sever, When the breeze blew summoning by; 'Twas the storm's shivering blast to the dew-spangled flower, And it bore the fell angel of death, But the fleet youth hath gone from the bright mountain bower, And is wafted by Boreas' breath. He has gone to the land where his hand will grasp The rose of the tropical grove, He has gone to the land, where his prize he will clasp To his breast, but ah! not his true love; O Immortal! enshield him from a merciless world, And his sails with calm breezes swell; Let not his proud soul from dominion be hurledâ Heaven's blessings attend theeâfarewell! EUTHANASIA. The blushing lily droops in vaunted hour, And folds its silken drapery beneath The effulgent sunbeams, but e'en in death Sheds perfumed incense o'er the woodland bower. The love-lorn nightingale asserts her power Of charming nature, when the blackest sky Enshrouds the world, and forked flashes fly Athwart the heavens, and shuddering terrors lower. The swan floats reckless on the crystal lake, And rears her downy arched neck, and sings Most musical when each spread pinion flings The crimson fluid on the pearly flake; So lies the breathless corse, while yet the flush Of beauty mantles where the shrouding haze Of dissolution, and death's amel glaze Are mingled with the bright and virgin blush That beamed, the herald of immortal bliss. A placid smile o'er each fair lineament Like weeping foliage of the willow bent O'er the cerulean limpid stream, to kiss The silvan rill, that chimes a mournful lay, Glows o'er the ashen cheek, as if the fire Ethereal, bright, and listless to expire, Diffusive beams of heaven had shed through clay, That once had been its loved, and gilded dome. The lambent glory of the unflown soul, Enamoured of its fane, sought not the goal Of heaven, but spread its golden wings to roam Around its death-cold tenement of fair, Unearthly beauty; as the melting glow Of animation fled the cheek of snow, Poised on the pinions of the viewless air, The soul from its own full radiance flung A ruby mantle o'er the pallid mien, And furled its pinions to resume unseen Its wonted empire, but the Sovereign hung His signal banner on the welkin's wing, And called the mundane recreant away; Slow sunk the sunbeams of the parting day, And ling'ring, lengthening, they die, and fling Their glories e'en on darkness' raven reign, Till not a bright ray lingers in the road Of life's last light, the emblem dim of Godâ But all is merged in heaven's effulgent train. ODE TO EVENING. Yon dim red splendour o'er the wavy flood, Of mingling hues, proclaims the god of day His bright, effulgent race In majesty has run. Lo! varied dies in sheeny beauty glow, And blend in one harmonious symphony,â For viewless angels strike Their golden wires to laud The God of nature, from their radiant thrones In every orb, that in the concave hangs; And all the glowing blaze Is but a ray of heavenly fire. But dim gleams glory o'er the melting pride Of solar pageantry, and night resumes Her dusky car, and sways In Cynthia's silver glow. How pensive-sweet, chaste eve, beneath the gleam Of constellations pendant on the sky, To muse on this lone cliff, Dark frowning o'er the wave Of yon glassed crystal lake, where lunar rays To fancy's frenzied eye enamel forms We loved, ere wo had wrought Affection into hate. Silence, with downy footstep, treads her fane, Save where the owlet tunes his dreary note Resounding through the dells, And distant mountain caves; Or gloomy bat, that flits on leathern wing, Or beetle, rushing on the reign of night From darkling, moss-strewn cells, Enjoy their destined hour. The lucent field of pure and waveless lymph, Pencilled with beauty's soft and blushing tints, Reflects the solitary's mien, Where pleasure reigned of yore. So, raptured friendship, heaven's saturnian boon, Responds the ardent energies of souls, By chords of virtue joined For earthâfor timeâfor bliss. I love thee, night, raised on thine ebon car, But beauty lingers round thy hallowed queen, And, from the woodland hill, Fans the sweet, noiseless vale; And round the hamlet, veiled with myrtle groves, Rustles with Zephyr, when on dewy wings, He perfumed Flora woos, And leads the hours with pride. Love reigns unrivalled in yon noiseless dale, And mingles heaven with earth's illusive charm Unknown to envy, hate, Fell ruin, and his train. Sleep on yon rural, weary eyelids dwells, Like the wild cygnet on its breast of down,â No phantom yields the joys, That flow from nature's breast. O soothing, Eve, are thy sequestered scenes, Where placid peace, and thrilling love unite, And smiles unearthly blend With being's seraph gaze. While spring with lilies scents thy blushing robe, While summer spreads the wide green-bosomed lawn, While golden autumn smiles, And iron winter reigns; So long, chaste Eve, will I admire thy sway, And chant thy pÃ¦an to the balmy breeze, And breathe the tale of love To manâto human kind. NEPENTHE. She was a miniature of loveliness. The glow, and flush of youth and beauty hung A veil of deep carnation o'er her mien, And o'er her neck, in gay profusion, fell Her auburn tresses loose from their egrette. Her full dark eye shot light and life around, And Love amid its beams with beauty reigned. Oft, ere the mists, that cinctured mountain's height, Melted 'neath sunbeams red from PhÅbus' car, She sought the lone lagoon, where Venus flung Her virgin blushes o'er the crystal wave; And there, as nature o'er the mead unrolled The heaven-graved volume of exhaustless lore, Calm Contemplation, that celestial nymph, Whose silent eye beams glory's lambent fire, Hung on the vault, that spans the pale blue skies, And gazed, not as the sceptic's eyeballs roll O'er vacancy, but on the countless gems That gleam along the bright aerial dales, Where nature's ardent amateur imbibes Ethereal fervour, and celestial worth. Oh! wrapt to ecstacy, in abstraction lost To earth's rude turmoil, and collisions dire, She sat, like rich Idallia's queen amid The flowery groves of Tempe, where Peneus Wafted on his wave the fragrant odours Of a godlike feast; but unlike the queen Of love and beauty, unallured by charms, Of sensual mould, her angelic soul Shed forth its notes responsive to the harps Of spotless, glory veiled seraphic choirs. Each sound of earth was hushed to grim repose, Save where the odour-breathing breeze on light And silvery pinions rustled mid the groves, Where the lone-musing melancholy bird Of silence poured its dulcet music forth To the immortal Sovereign of the spheres; Whose winning notes through raven night's expanse Floated on zephyr's soft and dewy wings Then would she waken from her reverie Of realms unearthly, and hang on the strain, Which amorous echo, through each lonely glen, And dell, and grotto, wafted with delight. And when sweet Philomel had sung her last Exulting vigil hymn, the soaring lark Caught its full echo for her matin song, And shed her choral carols through the skies; While beauty's voice the lauding chorus raised And then Aurora flung her farewell beams Athwart the sky; and golden-crested morn Glittered with splendour o'er the roscid vales. She loved this glorious solitude, and trod, With downy footstep, the extatic grove, Reckless, her marble brow, and tresses bright Gave full effulgence to the glowing beams That spangled brightest, where the evening dew Its pure libations had from heaven shed; As the deep lotus in the thorny wild Gems the full sunbeams, e'en till hooded Eve Restore the treasure light had snatched away. Nature to her had charms unknown to those Whose dull unheeding faculties are warped, And wrung for sordid gold; essence holy, Uncontaminate mingles not with clay, Love and beauty cheer o'er saddened hours Not oft, nor long; pure ethereal fire Illumines not this dark, and godless world. I muse full oft upon that graceful form, And heavenly mien, which nature made for bliss; But baseless charms, and visionary spells Robe light's viewless phantom with the folds And curves, that decked her earthly frame; and mute Expectation foils its own assurance. Hebrew Melodies. I. DAVID'S LAMENT. In guileless youth, with infant glee, When rosy smiles and love were blending, Thou climb'st thy father's lulling knee, And blessings were ascending; Thou wert my solace and my joy From blushing morn to ev'ning dun, But ah! they slew my smiling boyâ O Absalom, my son, my son! With glowing eye, and swelling breast, Thou didst transport thy royal sire, Who gaz'd upon thee, and was blest, And sweetly struck his sacred lyre; Thy voice was music to my ear, Thy flashing eye the orient sun, But murky tempests discord bear O'er thee, Absalom, my son, my son! When, pillowed on thy mother's bosom, In slumbers lay the sinless child, Fond fancy saw the cion blossom, And at the blissful image smiled; And blest love mus'd if death in gloom Should shroud the flower, that zephyr won, Beauty should deck thy princely tombâ O Absalom, my son, my son! But desert rocks are thy cold pillow, And dreary is the unhaunted wild, The sighing cypress, nor the willow Chant a sad dirge o'er my lone child; From the drear sunless wood is gleaming No proud tomb of beauty gone, But the raven bird is screaming O'er thee, Absalom my son, my son! The graceless rebels shrink away, And leave their scoffed lord mansionless, Minions! they bask in summer's ray, But to grief's voice are motionless; Ayâbut veiled Zion wakes my wail,â By plaudits was the prince undone, And earth shall quake to hear the tale Of Absalom, my son, my son! When wreathing incense rolled on high, And the sin-girt victim bled, Devotion glistened in thine eye, And heavenly hope was in thy tread; Yet, guile beset thy bright path blooming With the fair flowers of Lebanon, And all thy glory now is looming, O Absalom, my son, my son! O had I died for thee, my child, For my foot trod the downward vale, And thou wast young, and wast beguiled And led along the gore-paved dale! Forgive him heaven! he sought to rise On wings plumed for himâbut he's gone; O may sweet peace in yon bright skies Crown Absalom, my son, my son! II. THE DESOLATE FANE. The mitre's fallen from the brow Of Judah's holy hierarch, The fires of heaven no longer glow, And cincture glory's sacred ark; The olive circled cherubim With halcyon mercy no more reign, Nor Moriah's turrets gleam O'er heaven-girt Palestine's domain. Here Desolation builds his dome, And bitterns shriek his vigil song, And pelicans mid ruins roam, And willows moan the dales along; Amidst the rich and columned halls The noiseless spider weaves his woof, And brambles wave along the walls, And vipers throng the vaulted roof. The heaven-descended Shiloh came, Not in the warrior's sheeny car, Nor 'mid the glory-circling flame, With wrath his herald through the war; Nor jewelled crown of bright dominion Glowed on his brow irradiate! He rode not on the eagle's pinion, Lord of battle and of fate. But, a virgin bore the smiling child, And his palace was a manger, His airy walks the desert wild, And, on earth, he was a stranger; His aulic throne, the storm-lashed mountain, His royal banquet nature's store, His glowing nectar the lone fountain, And his tomb the voiceless shore. He came .... and bowed his crownless head, That wore, ere time to being sprang, The diadem, whose radiance shed Glory, and heaven illumed, when rang The golden wires of countless choirs, And uncreated piles of light Were the abode of Calvary's God, And angels, veiled, beheld the sight. Again, round Salem glory beams, From heaven descends her hierarch, And ev'ry mausoleum gleams, And a halo lingers round the ark;â O haunted, holy, Palestine, Allâall thy scenes are consecrate,â Thy King, thy God, thy Priest divine Thy towerless fane will renovate. [III. The Monarch walked his battlement] The Monarch walked his battlement, And o'er the sheeny turrets bent, His harp was strung, and in the breeze was sighing. And Kedron, in meandering flow, Was chiming, 'mid the solar glow, And to their lairs the wild's inmates were hieing. Below, the curling water played, And, beneath the myrtle shade, A diamond eye from raven lids is glancing; The coral lip, the glossy brow, The ivory neck, where tresses flow, Array the form, round which bright love is dancing. And when the crystal mirrored lymph, In undulations, saw the nymph In veilless beauty, as carnation blushing, It flung a sparkling beam above, And haloed the sheen path of love, And through the veins the ardent flood was rushing. The monarch sawâand felt the glow, The vivid flame of passion grow, Like balmy breezes rich ratafia breathing; The royal mandate flewâand soon The spotless nymph in the gay saloon Idallia stood, and soft perfume was wreathing. And now, amid the battle-shock, With death in ev'ry falchion's stroke, The doomed Uriah, like a hero's, warring; Alas! he crowns the gory slain, The breathless mountain of the plain,â The wanton grasp no mortal dread's debarring. The purple vestments veil the deed, And rapture wears the trophied meed, And blithesome reveries joyous hope are beaming; But the sabre cleaves the cion, And blackness shrouds celestial Zion, And quenchless fires around the scene are gleaming. [IV. Salem! heaven's terrestial daughter] Salem! heaven's terrestial daughter! Veil thy glowing mien in blackness, For thy banner's bathed in slaughter, And thy glory bright is trackless; The mighty fallâthe shield is cloven, And the bow is conquerless, The mantle's rent, in which was woven The image calm of holiness. The fell, and painim horde are shouting O'er the crestless son of glory, And their Dagon now is routing Israel on the mountain gory; Gath! O! echo not the tale, And hush thy breezes, Askalon,â The mighty fallâand nature's wail Is heard along the desert lone. The lion, when his eye was glowing, In the battle's fiery van, And his crimson plume was flowing, And his foe was wild and wan, Closed his red balls in stygian gloom; And by his sire the son is sleeping, Without a shroud, without a tomb, And no fond tear the field is steeping. O! they fought in fame together, And where the fires of death were flashing, And they did fadeless laurels gather Where the floods of flame were dashing; As they warred, and as they gloried, As they lived, and as they died, Where they sleep, with deeds unstoried, Fall light, ye dews, upon their pride. [The moon unfurls her blushing sail] The moon unfurls her blushing sail Along the bright translucent sky, And, like the curves of beauty's veil, The gilded, starry pennons fly; Night's empress through no sable rack Majestic scuds her haloed way, For lucid gleams o'er glory's track Of pensive splendour brightly play. The sylphs sport on the argent stream, That, chiming, laves the pebbled shore, And o'er the glassy surface gleam The twinkling lights, that richly store The sapphire vault, whose radiant dies Beam heaven's own lambent glory round, And span, and deck the deep blue skies, Where beauty reigns, and virtue's crowned. Enamoured Echo's airy numbers Are mute along the flower-girt wild, For the nymph serenely slumbers On her perfumed couchâand smiled When love-lorn Philomel's last note Mellifluous fell upon her ear, And when angelic strains did float Along the sky in music clear. Oh! could my waxen pinions soar, And ride along the viewless sky, The eagle's compeer, I would pour Unheeded strains no more, but fly With my wild harp diffusing love, And cull the pure ambrosial flowers, That amaranthine bloom above, And tapestry celestial bowers. O who can love this dull, cold sphere, Where man brooks nought of heavenly form, Where waves the pall, and creaks the bier, Surfeits the viper, gnaws the worm? Love is deceit, ambition guile, Fame a bright shadow, beauty dust, Honour destruction, worth a wile, Glory is death, and virtue's curst. But heaven glows in each glen and wold, When silver-hooded eve hangs o'er, Nature's pure volume's then unrolled, And her votarist treasures lore; Each tinkling rill, in heavenly chime, Responds the warbling notes of lyres Touched by pure choirs in bliss sublime, And raptured mind with fancy fires. Yet earth is but a vapid sphere, Ethereal glory's vestibule, A fire-girt pathway, wild and drear, A speck in heaven's unbounded rule! The bright beams of an endless day Illume not oft our darkling path, Religion is a wandering ray, A smile from the mien oft clothed in wrath. THE RURAL RUELLE. I have known many sorrows, that corroded the heart, And have revelled in pleasures, that bound like a spell, But sorrow to repress, and mild beauty impart, I ne'er knew a scene like the rural ruelle. The bright beaming eye, the soft glance of love, The rich stream of fancy from the clear mental well, The beauty that dazzles where'er the eyes rove, All depict the sweet pleasures of the rural ruelle. The sensitive mind that shrinks from the view, Like the tender mimosa within its deep shell, Expands with delight, and a roseate hue, In the quiet recess of the rural ruelle. The dull morbid follies and noise of the world, That o'er a sad heart in mockery dwell; Wild revel, where reason from dominion is hurled, Obtrude not their forms in the rural ruelle. But wisdom, more glorious than rubies or gems, And music, whose tones make the heart rise and swell, Like the colours that mingle on the lillied stems, Delight, and improve the mild rural ruelle. When grief sits triumphant on her ebony throne, And the breeze of the morn seems the funeral knell, The soft stealing tearâmellifluous tone, Show no desolate heart in the rural ruelle. The wild blooming grove, where the musical choir Of nature's wing'd minstrels with their songs o'er the dell, Teach man whom to praise, hears the sweet woodland lyre Send its notes from the unadorned rural ruelle. The libertine, reeling from his revelry high, Wears a heart ever cankered, a dread living hell; But we meet, and we part, with a bright glowing eye, From the innocent joys of the rural ruelle. SONNET. The whirlwind raged o'er land and ocean far, And heaved to heaven the billows of the main, And swept the emerald forest of the plain, In one unvaried blast of elemental war. And, 'mid the tempest, blackening o'er the sky, The centenary oak in vigour stood, And spread his hundred arms unto the flood, Defiance bid, and towered in majesty. But lo! the giant on the mountain side Shivered and shattered, in confusion lies, With trunk and branches wheeling thro' the skies, Where wrath and terror in their triumph ride. Yet, O imperial Ruin! it were wise To be, like thee, by mighty whirlwind broke, And lie in majesty beneath the stroke, Of heaven's dire thunderbolt from fiery skies, Rather than bow exemption dear to crave, Like the vile osier bending to the wind; More wise it is to die, and leave a name behind, Than fawnâand couchâand be a despot's slave. REMINISCENCE. Full many a heart with ardour beat, Full many a gem shone pure and bright, When love soared on hope's pinions fleet, And brightly beamed the cresset light To gild the path, that led to fame, And blazon worth in glory's prideâ And fancy saw youth's magic name Exalted, ne'er to be belied. Exulting, like the fleet gazelle, Gay, as the lark in vernal skies, Bright, as the blushing asphodel, Pure, as the moonbeam's placid dies, Rich, as ambrosia spread by love, Sweet, as the nectar Hybla yields, Visions of honour soar above, And paint around elysian fields. We live by fancyâlife's a dreamâ The luring shadow of despair, And love is but an idle themeâ As cataracts their channels wear, Our pleasures witherâwaneâand die; The mien, that beamed with attic grace, The soul, that fired life's ecstasy, Kindle no more in glory's race. We sought the loved and dear caress, And panted for the sameâsame gaol, In fond affection we did press, And burned the high, congenial soul; Youth and its pleasures now have pastâ And where are all my compeersâwhere? Their path is one wide, lonely waste, Their sunbeams waned in dark despair. The cypress, yew, and willow bend Their weeping foliage o'er the tomb, The mournful dirge, and pÃ¦an blend Their varied notes amid the gloom; The undulating streamlet laves The bowering arbour, where they sleep While the unheeding tempest raves, And flame-girt billows fiercely sweep. And O! I love that tufted grove, And voiceless, solemn, solitude, Where silence fosters heavenly love, And lone peace crowns youth's pensive mood, Far more than pompous pageantry, Or airy, flaunting, heartless mirth,â Melancholy! they are to thee The fairy forms of phantom birth. O sinful world! allied to heaven, Where genius bright neglected dies, Where worth's a bane, and mind is riven, And blasphemy assaults the skies; Where high-born virtue cannot charm, And purity receives a blot, Where malice stalks in fell alarmâ O foul ingrate! I love thee not. SCALDIC SONG. The eagle plumes her noble crest, And seeks the dales of upper air, And proudly swells her fearless breast When gazing on the red sun there; The fire-crested billow breaks loud o'er the Haaf, And hushed is the runic wild, revelling laugh, The storm in blackness shrouds the sky, Save when liquid fires illume The murky welkinâand they fly In forked flashes through the gloom. The garland is streaming from the mast, The loose shrouds are shiv'ring, and furies are dancing And frantic sybils on the blast, Their baleful eyes in wrath are glancing. O'er the wild and warring billows, The frail bark by ice-bergs is rapidly driven,â Sinks the wreckâand gelid pillows Bear the inmatesâhope is riven;â But the sybil now is sailing On the fire flashing wings of the merciless storm, Though gale and surge are wildly wailing The last dirge of Arva, of the paragon form; And the beauty's golden tresses Mark her form on the phosphoric billows of night, And, anon, a father blesses His relic of pleasure, and her guardian bright. [When tortured life, and visionary schemes] Non havea pianto, ma che di sospiri Che l'aura eterna facea tremare, E cio avenea di duoi senza matiri.â Dante. When tortured life, and visionary schemes, And gilded hopes, and gay illusions wane, When from the soul the momentary beams Of joy shed beauty o'er the rack of pain, And madness of infuriate agony, No moreâwhen fond affection dies for aye, And the wrung heart recoils in mystery, And shrinks aghast from every genial ray Of love, or beauty, fearful 'tis the flame Of lowering wrath, the volcan's fire serene But herald of the lava floodâthe name Of her, who erst did diadem the scene Of raptured transport, and enthrilling love, Grates, like a slow-trod funeral dirge, upon The aching earâand all the myrtle grove, That whilom heard the heartless vows, which won The joyous soul's devotion, and entwined Each fond delight with heaven, deeply sighs Through all its platted foliage to the wind, And hoarsely calls the shade of death to rise, And, with his darkling shadow, shroud in gloom The Eden, where the faithless voice of guile Developed hope illusive; dark the tomb, But envy, hate, ambition, ire, the wile Of cunning, and the fires of fury wring No heart, that slumbers there in grim repose; Pierced by the poisoned shaft, the venom sting, Still fond of being, hoping though the close, Amid the mirth and hum of reckless souls, Who plume themselves in folly and deceit, And soan the laws proud Lucifer unrolls,â And in a miasmatic slime surfeit Their base souls insatiateâin loneliness, In dismal solitude, I dwell, unknown To all the fairy charms of life, that bless Our wayward, sad existence; the soft tone Of some inviting voice, that calls from far The toil-oppressed traveller, when the fires Of death flash round, and elemental war Toils on, till nature's wanton bloom expires, Beguiles, like syrens' music floating o'er The necromantic strandâor hope appears In solitary bloom; the sea-girt shore, When transient tempests roar and blacken, wears An evanescent robe of terrorâlove Glows in the deep blue fields of etherâpeace Floats on her pinions from the arch above; But, when the clouds in gath'ring rage increase, And flake on flake, in slow, but awful gloom, Curtain the heavens in blackness, and portend The issue terrible; when fires illume The sky in momentary glare, and blend, Like death and sin, along the welkin's bound, With loud, tumultuous torrents; when wrath Wails in the unremitted blast, and round The concave, no bright aperture to path A track for hope salutes the moveless gaze; When fiery billows, in dread mountain piles, Sweep heaven, and disclose deathâand a dark haze Veils nature in wild desolationâsmiles Sit not graceful on the frantic mien; And O! how faint, how feeble is this sketch To mental agony! the inward scene Of more than mortal warâO! hope will stretch Her waxen wings, and find her Eden death; Eternal death to all terrestrial love! Our dearest pleasures are the sportive breath Of fascinating wo; alas! we rove, The storm-lashed wanderers of a gloomy hour, Gazing on every fleet, and vapoury sail, That lives in wild imaginative power, And ply our highest force and might to hail A phantom; O it were! a demon band Of unknown miseries! immerged in gloom, By hope deluded, shudd'ring when the brand Of death hangs flashing o'er usâthe Simoom Of envy blighting all but dreary life, Imagination glowing with the joys Of youth,âthat never can returnâthe strife Of worldly pomp pursuingâwith the toys Of more than low infantile manhood lured, By vaunted ken recked fortune's darling minions, Our skies by clouds and tempests e'er obscured, We drag our chainsâand plume for death our pinions. THE ANGEL OF PEACE. Star of the East! in effulgence glowing When Persia's magi hung upon thy beams, And nectared streams of heaven-born ruth were flowing, And all creation, in the dazzling gleams Of state imperial, saw the conqu'rer come; Star of the East! bright herald of the dove, Thy pensive splendour lit the midnight gloom, And cheered thy songstress in the olive grove. Bright Sun of Glory! kindled by the rays Of constellations mingling through the globe, A spotless spirit round thy halo plays, And sunbeams flash from his full gemmed robe. Thy veilless sheen the lurid pyres will dim Of false devotion, and idolatry, And sacred Ganges echo heaven's own hymn, And the red cross, proud India's banner, fly. Bright Sun of Glory! lucid fires will gild The Shach's rich calpac, and the diadem,â The wailing war-whoop's hushed along the wild. And loudly ring the songs of Bethlehem; The ethnic Cachique, and the Inca proud, Will sleep in glory's festooned cenotaph, And, wrapt in love's immortal, jewelled shroud, Invoke a seraph for their epitaph. The mountaineer o'er avalanches sublime Impels his pulka, and his matin song Of heavenly love, and gratitude, doth chime With the loud hymn of distant land and tongue; The prince and peasant, lord and slave, unite In one ethereal jubilee of love, And time unrolls his covert visions, bright With fervid blissâcelestial spirits rove Through blooming dales, where sunbeams love to dwell, And nature's carmine robe exhales perfume; Where lucid streams from vine-clad bowers well, And gales of balm succeed the fell Simoom; On love's fleet pinions lo! the incarnate God Deigns to descend and bless apostate man, O how unlike the awful Lord, who trod Sinai, and laid the world beneath his ban. The proud pagodas of the painim clime, Hid in the bowers of palmetto groves, Resound the pÃ¦an of palanquined chime No moreâthe tortured fakeer vainly roves, To seek the votaries of illusive charms, And desolate is Brumhu's gory shrine, On Vishnoo's breast the necromantic arms No longer flash in luring rays divine. Bright Sun of Glory! thine it is to gild The amaranthine blossoms of the East, To clothe the dark and desert mental wild With light celestial; and the maudlin feast Becomes the banquet of a chaste desire; O! glories blend along the empyreal sky, With dove-like mercies, as the crystal fire In alloy glows with brighter purity. BELLONA. When the fires of death are glowing O'er the reeking battle-field, When the crimson stream is flowing, And the watchword âdie or yield,â By vollied thunders, trumpets' bray, And clash of brand and shield is rung; When the scenes of youth are blooming Round the pallid warrior's brain, And the frantic soul is stung To madness, when the fates are dooming His gory tomb among the slain; When the spouse on some high cleft Breathes forth her vigil orison, And, of hope, and life bereft, In frenzy pours her malison On fell ambition's wanton wasteâ When, amid the din of war, The dreadful shock of death has past, And moaning murmurs swell afar, And vict'ry greets her trophied carâ Where the lava floods are dashing, And the courser's tread, like thunder, Shakes the red-field, where are flashing Lightnings caustic, and asunder Life, and hope, and heart are rivenâ Where the crestless morion lies, And the martial shield is clovenâ Where nothing 'mid the dire scene lives, Save a dim halo on the wing;â There in mortal carnage glowing, I the death-knell love to ring, And revel where the life-blood's flowing. [I stood amid the perfumed foliage] I stood amid the perfumed foliage Of an Asian bower, tapestried by bloom; The blushing vine had flung its fruitage o'er The enamelled domeâand, woven 'mid the robes Of Flora's iris drapery, had won The homage of enamoured Zephyr's breath; The gurgling rill o'er granite calmly flowed, And laved, in soft meandering undulations, The tufted bower of amaranthine bloomâ The pure rose distilled its fragrant odours, And spread its snowy mantle o'er the wave; The magnolia, with odoriferous breath, Sprang into life exuberant, and 'mid Its platted shrubbery lay the waking fawn; And lilies, like the bright carbuncle, rise And carpet o'er the velvet lawn, and woo The aching heart to press their bridal couch; And there, in gorgeous vestments, blossoms one, Rafflesia titan. Whose scarlet petals treasure crystal dew, And ope its rosy bosom to the eye Of nature's devotee, like the chaste nymph, Who erst, in rich Hesperian gardens, Bore the trophied palm of beauty, and drew Olympian pÃ¦ans; whose crimson leaves, As variegated mosaic, blend Their silken tapestry, and mellow glow, With oriental pomp, magnificence, And glory; and in pride unrivalled rear On high the irradiate crest of splendour. In the enchanted distance myrtle groves Expand, and, when the gentle vigil breeze, On rustling pinions, plays amid the green And musical branches, and the dryads, Sleepless, tune the soft woodland reed, or pipe, To notes of holy, and celestial love, And gladness unalloyed by mortal hate, The tired wanderer of this dismal sphere Might there repose, nor while away his hours In heartless mirth, inglorious revel, Nor inhuman schemes of malice, envy, And insatiate vengeance; but, in mild love, Attend the soothing voice of nature kind To all her melancholy votaries; And awake from blissful dreams to behold The cincturing Eden, blooming in its pride, And lulled into a visionary spell Of rapture, hear the songs of Paradise Float, in immortal strains, from the strung harps Of nature's spotless ministers, who wing Their earthward flight on noiseless pinions, gemmed With the effulgent glory of their Lord. Afar, the sighing willow copse, whose boughs Pendent o'er the sheeny wave, that ripples In silvery whiteness, tinged by the beams Of solar splendour, tinkling in its chime The unvaried dirge, and swelling higher notes, That close in one full-voiced diapason, Bathe their pale-green foilage in the flood And drink the drastic fluid; shadows o'er The laughing mead, and veils the sacred scene Of sculptured urns, and storied mausoleums. O! in this charming bower I would dwell Undazzled by the pomp, and unallured By the vain pageants of a faithless world; And there, unknown to mirth, and guile, and grief, Mingle my lyric minstrelsy of love With the strains of the sad, lone, nightingale, The muse of solitude, that float along Cerulean skies, and flowery meads, and dales Exulting in the radiance of light and life; And call up visions, where the lonely mind, Unused to brook the bitter jeer, the smile Of envy, and the brutal shock of him, Who outvies the fierce hyÃ¦na, and slakes His frenzied fury with the brilliant charms, That twine around the fibres of the heart, And break, when each fond passion wanes and dies In budding beauty, or celestial bloom, Enjoys all nature in her mellowness, And, nurtured by ambrosia shed from heaven, And nectar, fraught with more than fabled force, Or, rich Arcadian sweetness, attune The warbling wires of enraptured gladness; Unknowing pompous misery, and hate, That decks itself in friendship, and assumes The smile of soft complacency, indulge In heavenly reveries of hope, and faith, Till the unstained soul shall rise, and spring, And mingle with angelic choirs on high. [I saw a yacht, in gay career] I saw a yacht, in gay career, Glide like a swan along the stream, The jewelled empress of her sphere, And glitt'ring brilliants flung a beam, A halo round the ivory neck, And seanymphs walked the foaming wake, And streamers fanned the golden deck, And mirth flew o'er the crystal lake. I saw the flame-girt sun arise, And gild the concave in his march, And saw the rainbow span the skies, And tinge the beauty's flower-wreathed arch, When, amid a golden flood, He slowly sought his vesper dome, And decked the fair, and perfumed wood, But left behind impervious gloom. I saw the silver crescent float Amid the mantling rack on high, And oft was heard the warbler's note Breathe o'er the wild rich melody; And flashing stars, her gilded train, Like love on beauty, mildly wait, But faint, fleet, transient, was her reign, And silent as the realm of fate. I saw a blushing lily bloom, And o'er the lone and desert heath Fling on Zephyr soft perfume, Like the stainless virgin's breath; There hung the beryl, and the gem, And by there blushed the violet, The myrtle waved, love's diadem,â And stately rose the mignonette. I saw amid the myrtle grove The gentle nymph of purity, The graces round her fair form move, And revel in their ecstasy; And oh! my heart, at Mary's name, Mutely confessed the charms of love, And every fair breeze fanned the flame, Whose radiance brightest glows above. [Come to the bower, that love has wove] Come to the bower, that love has wove Amid the foliage of the tufted grove, Thou beauteous queen of my heart; The world is a cheerless scene of strife, With reckless wo and chicane rife, And love alone can bliss impart. O come, and grace the mossy bower, Thou blushing, roseate spangled flower, And reign the empress of my soul,â The flashing light of thy diamond eye, Thy hyacinthine locks that fly, Seem the radiance of bliss by mortals stole. The woodbine, rose, and jasmine entwine, Like love and beauty in ardour divine, And amorous ringdoves chant their song; Come from thy height of pomp, my love, And charm my heart in the tap'stried grove, And thy train will dance the wild along. The lulling stream the arbour laves, And bright skies hang our architraves, And spirits press the banks of thyme; Without thee, fragrance leaves my path, And dies like the withered lattermath, And harsh to the soul is the crystal chime. Thy coral lip breathes mellifluous love, Thy marble cheek is tinged from above With the carmine that lives in upper air; O'er thy ivory neck, as a mantle of gold, Thy auburn tresses, from their band unrolled, Float, like sheen Iris exultingly fair. There on the emerald carpet, bright With gems that sparkle to the queen of night, The dove-like fays twirl round their nymph, And they sing, as they spread their visual sail, To the cool breeze, that echoes their fanciful tale, And fans the lucent mirrored lymph. [There is a fountain welling, yet unknown] There is a fountain welling, yet unknown, And shaded deeper than the untrod cave, Where mortals venture not, and where have blown No sweeping tempestsâsilent as the grave, Yet mighty in its progressâand unquelled By human prowessâflows the living stream In full power, till, in icy bondage held It murmursâdiesânor yields a parting gleam;â There is a region, veiled in sunless gloom, Peopled by pygmy beings, and arrayed In pomp exotic, alien pride,âthe tomb Of the ascetic eremite, inlayed With all the aulic pearls, and gems, and flowers Of kingly state, betrays not folly more Than the full-festooned, but rayless bowers, Delineated on the desert shore By viewless hands, and pencilled in the shades Of darkness and of beautyâlove and hateâ There blooms the hyacinth through the op'ning glades Of nightshade and of banewortâand dire fate Amid the scene hath reared his darkling throne; There is a clime by withered lilies strewn, That glowed with incense erstâthe lyre's soft tone Is hushed to all the charms, that oft attune The woodland wiresâand cheerless nature droops, And sighs the dirge through all her leafless grove, And there the ungorged hawk, or ostrich swoops, And unheard, unknown, is the turtle-dove; There is a dome that rears its turrets o'er Desolation, beauties nor a ray impart Of hope, or loveânor charm the joyless shoreâ It is despair's domainâa broken heart; Far more unknown than polar climes, that sleep In dormant gloom, that eye ne'er gazed upon; Than the dark mansions of the coral deep, Or the drear palace of the torrid zone. ELEGY ON THE DEATH OF THE REV. WALTER CRANSTON. Enraptured hope had culled the perfumed flowers, And twined her wreath around the glowing brow, While faith hung fondly on the joyous hours, And love beamed forth in amaranthine glow. Each radiant eye, in kindling joy, surveyed The cherub features of his glowing mien, And mute attention winning homage paid, And heaven's devotion harmonized the scene. His smile angelic lit the troublous way, When grief had shrouded earth in murky gloom, Like orient sunbeams, in their brilliant play, His flash could gild the darkness of the tomb. O dear, lost patron of my tuneful art! As stars, that flash along the crystal dome Of heaven, a bright and vivid gleam impart To nature, when the viewless spirits roam; So the sheen rays of thy celestial soul Illumed the darkness of my lonely path, When the mild tear from thy dark lashes stole, And gleamed thy shield amid the bolts of wrath As pearly streams, that lave the diamond mine, Bear the rich treasure in their ceaseless flow, Time, grief, misfortune, and decay combine To gild the past with never-waning glow. O! oft with thee through classic haunts of yore, With a soul fired to win the Paphian meed, I roved, and mused on soft Castalia's shore, And round Aganippe attuned the reed. Thy wisdom taught my grovelling thoughts to ris When barbed darts transfixed my feeling heart, The arch of love and mercy spanned the skies, When thy bold hand with vigour drew the dart. Unknown to guile, impelled by virtue's power, His heaven-girt soul disdained the aspic fiend Of malice,âscandal,âwho improved the hour Unguarded, to assail the bosom of my friend. O! on the varnished hypocrite there fell His holy ire, and sacred malison, The painted demon back recoiled to hell, And joined his compeers in their feats anon. But oh! what scenes are opening on thy sight, What raptured strains awake thy living lyre Shrouded in innocence, and robed in light, Thy bosom burns with bright, ethereal fire Ah! could my hand but reach thy distant tomb, Fair flowers should deck the desolate domain Of sin's fierce heir, and blossoms e'er illume The darkling grandeur of his dreaded reign. But breathing sculpture cannot raise thy fame, Nor mausoleums consecrate the sod;â O sainted shade! thy fair and glorious name By angels is engraved upon the throne of God. THE REQUIEM. The curtain has fallen, the night-cloud has lowered, And dark waves the pall o'er the desolate bier; And low lies the fair form, that exultingly towered, And the white shroud of death is bedewed with a tear. Oh! his name o'er oblivion tunes the pÃ¦an of glory, It sinks not to dust, but is twined in the heart, O his eloge is the eternal story Of his deeds, and his mind, that did virtue impart. There's a sound floating on the fleet breezes of balm, And the dirge is absorbed in the song of the saint, There's a seraph that follows with the heavenly palm, And his shadow is dim, and the lyre's notes are faint. Gild, ye sunbeams of glory, the tomb where he sleeps, And enamel the bright urn, fraught with embers, that glowed In lambent effulgenceâfor the willow-copse weeps, Where he mused on his woes, and wept as he trode. The aspen, that quivers when the light breeze is blowing, Spreads its deep-blue foliage, and adorns the domain Of nature, when each field with rich verdure is glowing; So shrinks the soft heart from the fell stroke of pain. They called him austere,âhe frowned on the herd, Who wade thro' the slime of corruption and lust, They called him a maniacâfor he deigned not a word To the wretch, who banquets on glittering dust. He slumbers; the tempest is howling above, Yet his heart is unmoved, and his fancy is still;â He slumbers; but his spirit in the pure realms of love Breathes the redolence that issues from bright Zion-bill. THE WANDERER. âThe sun is sinking on the sea,â The dim shades flit along the lea, The scintillating sunbeams flee, And tinge the heaving billow; The night has lowered, and flung her veil O'er the wold, and o'er the dale, And swelling is the snowy sail, And rolling is my pillow. The ship is bounding in her motion, The proud waves heave in loud commotion, The mirage of the restless ocean Is hanging on the horizon; The seagull screams, and hastens by, The porpoise bounds in revelry, The lurid vestments o'er the sky Seem to the soul a malison. The blast is dread on wings of fire, The billows flash in vivid ire, The quailing heart dares not aspire, And draw a hope from heaven; The death-fires dance among the shrouds, The wind-god rides the fleecy clouds, And, wailing, writhe the pallid crowds, And fiercely is the frail bark driven. The wave is resting on the deep, The wanderer's eye is closed in sleep, The lachrymal fount has ceased to weep, And the arcade's clothed in brightness; The gilded spire attracts the view, The tropic clime, now veiled in dew, The range of domes, of diverse hue, And fields in budding whiteness. The verdant grove is decked with bloom, The woodbine blushes through the gloom, The floral petals o'er the tomb, And the shrubbery redolent, The bay, where smooth lianas twine, The rill, whose silver waters shine, The fane, where rises thought divine, In one rich view are blent. The friend of youth is far away, The shades of beauty dimly play, The floods of wo have quenched the ray, And all the charms of love; The plaintive sigh's not breathed for me, The joyous board, the mirthful glee, The loving smile, festivity;â For I am doomed to rove. The hope of joy is plumed for all, The cup, that crowns the festival, The fond caress, the aulic hall, And blest is ardent passion; The sneer, that blasts the love of youth, The wrath, that scorns celestial ruth, The ire, unheeding worth and truth, Have shown me faith is out of fashion. The saint, who clasped me to his breast, The voice, that hushed my woes to rest, The love, imbibed among the blest, Have sought their silent mansion; The heart, untainted, high, sincere, The full soul, unconfined by sphere, Have been by vipers rendered sear, And burst in their expansion. The partner of my childhood pleasures, The hand, that shared my orient treasures, The foot, that trod our sportive measures, (Would thrustâwould tramp me into earth; The bird, that sung, would hush her strain, The dog, who loved me, ere again My footsteps tread my natal plain, Wound me, a form of unknown birth. The scenes of bliss are gone for ever, Their charms return to cheer meânever, The hearts, that fell hate could not sever, Have broke in earth's collision; The eyes, that wept for others' woes, The glance of vengeance now disclose, And civic form a mantle throws O'er manhood's sheer derision. [There's a crystalline cove hid in the deep-bosomed hills] There's a crystalline cove hid in the deep-bosomed hills, Where the perch and mullet rove, and chime the flashing rills, And dandelions blush around, and daffodils perfume The air, and carpet o'er the ground, and love the quiet gloom. Amid the fresco concerts raise the songs of bliss above, And the purlieu echoes praise, that charms the rosy grove, And there the red-bird chirps and plays, and to his honied dome The freeborn bee, 'mid lauding lays, on weary wing doth roam. The cocoa clasps the myrtle spray, and weaves a colonnade, And flaunting woodbines wind their way, and tapestry the shade, The whispering winds o'er floral lawns woo sorrow to repose, And the sun of pleasure dawns, and bliss its mantle throws. There on the limpid water dance the woodnymphs clothed in robes of flowers, And dryads fling a raptured glance, and ringdoves, from their bowers, In mellow music keep the chime, and rule their joyous measures, And then they sleep on shores of thyme, and gather fairy treasures. There in the linden groves of peace, and where bananas spread, When the notes of woe shall cease, I'd lay my weary head, Or rove along the pebbled shore, and rear a pearly dome, Where fiery billows never roar, and vestal virgins come. THE ORPHAN. I saw when the tired day and dim eve were blending, And the hyacinth was valving its petals of yellow, A form, with her looks all dishevelled, descending The dew-covered hill to the mead that was mellow; She was beautiful and fair, but the rose reigned alone, The lily had withered, the carnation had died, And wild flashed her eye, and her low vocal tone Arose on the breeze, like the requiem of pride. Embosomed in the deep maple grove, there arose The mouldering walls of a roofless abode, And the nightshade, and hemlock, as the sighing breeze blows, Bent their stalks o'er the path, where the lone virgin trode; And the owlet, and raven, and twittering swallow, Found a desolate shelter in the maid's sunny bower, And the tempest, that moaned in gusts faint and hollow, Threw an ominous pall o'er the sorrowful hour. But, along the wild desert, and beneath the arch'd willow, The lorn relic of bloom, a sweet lily was budding, Like the philomot flower on the fire-crested billow, When the wandering sunbeams the clear wave are studding; The motherless child, by illusion, though fleeting, Wore a lingering smile as she paced the lone mansion, And she sought the high chamber, with her hands spread for greeting Her sisterâher soul sunk in noble expansion. She had grasped the fond hand and had sunk on the breast, And had kiss'd the full tear from the tremulous cheek, And sought a far land, where beloved and carest, She shared all that charms, and thought not to seek; She was blooming in beauty, and as spotless as fair, But a fell demon saw herâthe tale is soon told, Her bright orb has set in a rayless despair, And she trod to her tomb as she flew o'er the wold. The nightingale heard the shrill shriek of wo, And spread her soft pinions, and perched on the willow, And the maid loosed her scarf, laid her fair form below, And the lily bent o'er her on her motionless pillow; The requiem is chanted, and it floats through the air, And, cinctured by green turf, the beauty is sleeping, And choristers sing dirges o'er the orphan, and there The heaven-wept dew her mute mansion is steeping. Oh! her pure soul has flown, and is raptured above, Where high angels encircle her, and sweep their strung lyres, But when the lone wanderer, through the bowering grove Where she sleeps, doth ramble o'er the tombs of his sires, In the darkness of even, he fancies a spirit Is gliding around him, and he seeks the lone willow, And pauses to listen, that his heart may inherit A ray from the eye, that is closed on the pillow. THE SAILOR'S DREAM. The ship upon the breeze was hung, My hammock from the deck was swung, Our last song of glee was sung, And I was deeply sleeping. My father's cot before me stood, And the wide pine-apple wood, The sportive deer, in mirthful mood, Around my path was leaping. And there my wife, in faithful love, Was gazing on the distant grove, And when the breeze its boughs did move, She bowed her head in weeping. She caught my frisking dog, and pressed Him to her fair and throbbing breast, And words she spoke, as she carest, And words they were worth keeping. I strove to burst my way, and hear The song, alas! my aching ear Could not, for far away my dear Our bridal couch was steeping. I could not hear, but saw my sire Collect his wood for winter fire, And knew he touch'd the rustic lyre As he his grain was reaping. But, loud above my aching head, The drowsy watch was called to tread The deck, and slow I left my bed, And then the tide was neaping. THE FELO-DE-SE. In yon unhaunted, and unhallowed copse, O'er whom no form is bent to shed a tear, The tortured victim of delusive hopes, Poor Austin sleeps, beyond the verge of fear. Perchance his heart was formed in virtue's mould, And beat responsive to celestial worth, His noble hand the gilded stores unrolled Before the good man of ignoble birth; His voice, in soothing accents, hushed the woes, The iron pangs, that rack the pensile breast, And his high soul portrayed each charm, that throws A screen o'er sorrows, that life's blessings wrest. In the deep mansions of his pliant heart, He bore the shafts of envy and disdain, Nor worth, nor wisdom could a charm impart To quell his anguish, or assuage his pain. A smile would tremble on his pallid lip, Like the dim sunbeam of the dusky hour O'er lilied lawns, when pendent willows dip Their boughs in rills, or droop beneath the shower. But oh! when fancy lured his raptured sight With a rich gem, in thrilling hope he sprung, And grasped the thorn, and, merged in mental night, His spirit dark to agony was stung. ANTISTROPHE I. When flower-wreathed Morn upon the mountains danced, And fragrant gales the spangled meadows fanned, His radiant eye o'er nature's fair form glanced, Each sense was revelling, and each passion bland. His soul drank nectar from the honied fields, And, in exuberance, bounded like the fawn, The darkest breast the light of glory gilds, And heaven descends to deck the gemmed dawn. Oh! then he roved and culled the blushing flowers, And wove a garland, in his wayward mood, To grace the brow of her, who charmed the bowers, That bloomed in his lone, mental solitude. STROPHE II. The soft, the delicate, the dovelike breath Of gentle ruth attuned his soul for bliss, But in the shock, the scorn of man fell death His fine heart sunk to dark despair's abyss. His breast was not an adamantine throne, Where reigned stern Apathy with stoic eye, Unmoved by gore, unheeding mortal groan, Dark deeds her vaunt, and death her revelry. He lured not victims with the rays of heaven, Stolen to fascinate by a lucid glare, Then lock the chain by which the wretch is riven, And, smiling, dye the gory scimitar. No!âthe fierce pangs of human wo he hushed, But curses fell upon his tortured ear, From lifeâfrom hope in frenzied rage he rushed, They laid him shroudness on his raven bier. ANTISTROPHE II. So there he sleeps beneath the glebe untrod, And, if perchance a vagrant footstep roam Around the spot, or press the fatal sod, Or a sigh's breathed o'er dire misfortune's dome; A warning voice will break the sweet repose, And mark pollution on the pensive mien, That dares to drop a tear, and is not froze To iciness when gazing on the scene. Poor suicide! thy bitter life was sad, And agonizing were thy woes unknown, A fiend each fair, and bright, and dear scene clad With desolation; and the eternal throne Man strove to seize, and thee thy doom award In never waning fire and hopelessness; Thou should'st have reared thy crest, and bravely warred, And made each proud head prone, and every voice to bless. CHORUS. But I would seek thy voiceless tomb, And tread the moaning nightshade down, And weep amid sepulchral gloom, Nor vent a curse, nor wear a frown. He, that thy being gave, alone Can know thy thousand untold woes, He knows if ought can death atone Inflicted by thy handâhe knows. Goaded by hate, and black despair, Illuded by his fickle fate, The youth has fallen who was fair, And his grave is desolate. This sphere is sure no place for those, Who feel each taunt and bitter jeer, Yet we must brave our mortal woes, And steel ourselves against a tear. The hand, that caused the stream to flow, A one can justly stem the torrent, And he, who strikes the fatal blow, Is ever viewed with eye abhorrent. A NONDESCRIPT. There lives amid the varied scenes of life A vixen, masqued in starless mystery. Her tresses seem, in distant view, to wave In auburn full profusion o'er a neck Of ivory; her bright mien lit with smiles, That glow in loveliness, and homage win From devotees, who kneel afar, and strew Her path with odoriferous incense; Her eye, in diamond flashes, fills the soul With rapture voiceless, and to mortal ken A blissful angel loves to linger there, And the Pierian habitants are gemmed With the bright crowns the Paphian goddess wore; And there they dance in mazy pride, and fling Sweet perfume at each wanton wheel of love; Not soft Idallia's form, 'mid groves of palm, Seemed wrought in mould so smooth, and pencilled o'er With teints so delicate, as her's; she moved In dignity and gracefulnessâher voice Breathed forth celestial aspirations, fraught With holy love, in vocal symphony. I saw a form, on glossy pinions, move In fearless majesty, yet calm and sweet, And soar above the dazzled herd around, And break the spell the Pythoness had hung, In sybil wiles, around her horrid mien. Oh! then, recoiling, faith was lost in dread, And false, illusive seemed my startled view Of hissing serpents, wreathed around her brow, Who coiled, in massive folds, and fiercely flung, From venomed tongues, their fatal poison o'er The haunted scene; her wrinkled lineaments, Distorted all, assumed a demon glare Of vengful fierceness; and the yellow blood Diffused a sallow flush o'er features, Wrought into heavenly form by the art Of magic falsehood; her celestial frame Before the seraph eye, that gazed upon Its dread deformity, became a mass Of formless, graceless, and ignoble shame; Her eye flashed with the fires, that glow around The sad victim of undying torture. She shrunk away in terror wild before The rays, that disenthralled the votary Of charms, that glittered in the distant eye, But withered in possession, and assumed A Stygian horror, and in holy wrath A sheeny sabre was brandished on high, And pierced the heart's deep core; the flood Of life reeked from the deadly wound, and flowed, In tainting streams, around the syren's dome. Graved on her robe were flaring figures, wrought In fascinating forms, but on her brow, Devoid of hieroglyphic mystery, Appeared âhypocrisy;â and upon the crown Of the winged being, who unveiled her wiles, And broke her fancied spell, in jewels set, Shone the fair name of bright and stainless Truth. LESANG; OR, THE GRAVE OF THE ABORIGINAL FLOWER. I. The crescent through the liquid air, That breathed in fragrance o'er the grove, Was sailing, and her vestments fair Unfurled in mild and tranquil love; And o'er the wold, enamelled bright, The fairy woodnymphs seem to glide, The phantom queens of noiseless night, In all their lucent pygmean pride; The beech was nodding from the cliff, The moss-wreathed oak was sadly sighing, And, on the cove afar, the skiff O'er the light blue wave was flying; The mountain hoar arose on high, The visual pillar of the sky, And down its shaggy sides, embrowned By tropic suns, with rapid bound, The lion, panther, fierce jackal, Rushed to their midnight festival; The hour was lone and sad, I ween, But, voiceless was the desert scene? II. Clad in the garb of deepest wo, A tenant of the airy height, Her bosom heaved by mis'ry's throe, And marked with grief her visage bright, Why moans Manan in wailings deep, Why loves lone Echo to respond The bitter cry along the steep, In notes of deep affection fond? Oh! she has ceased to win the meed, The olive sons of the cane-girt wood In battle fierce, and fell, did bleed To crown her with, the fair, the good; Her sire, the chief of all the braves, Who reigned the lords of wave and weald, No more the fiend of havoc raves; And rules by prowess firmly held; And dark-haired Manan's sunny bower, Upon the emerald, sloping hill, Is tenantless at vesper hour, And untrod dews around distil; The eagle spirit of her race Has flown away with rapid pace, The congar makes his gory lair In the royal weekwamâayâand there The night-wind bears the embers warm Of all, that wore the living form, And none, amid the dark despair, Is left a boon to crave, or share. Why flash the eyes, that beamed with mildness, Around the wood in maniac wildness? III. Why are her arms clasped round her breast, And why that heartless smile through tears? Her dulcet song will hush to rest The infant now the mother bears. It slumbers in its bough-rocked cradle, And mutely to the fountain-spring Lone Manan treads, with cocoa-ladle, The cold, pure beverage to bring. In dreamless wo she pressed the knoll, And sat upon the moss-grown seatâ âDread grief seems rushing on thy soul, And art thouâart thou desolate? Why lov'st thou this dark wilderness, If ought can be to win and blessâ âStranger! thy mien appals my sight, And adds a pang unto my heart, The north-wind, oh! has sent a blight O'er all that could a hope impart; My garden in you wild was growing, And vernal rays just oped the bud, Then flew the fires of vengeance glowing, Quenched only by my father's blood. I was a chieftain's pride and glory, The flower, that bloomed around his path, O veil, ye Powers, the awful story! Areouski's thundering wrath Slept, moveless, in yon darkling cave. And here is now my princely grave Amid the marshâno Indian eye Will e'er the unknown spot espy, Nor wandering footstep press the sod, Save the cursed white-man's sole, O God!â IV. âAs shadows flit before the dawn, Perchance thy woes will find a balm, And yet remain a martial train Of warriors, who will bear the palm.â âThe Spirit, of the red right-hand, Will hear proud Kolacusta's daughter, And wield in wrath the gore-dyed brand O'er the murderers' ruthless slaughter! By my tombless father's name, By all the glory he had won, They shall hear 'mid death and flame, My lastâmy dying malison! Lesangâaccursed for ever be The man, who robbed me of my glory, Yet O! his name is dear to me, I love him, e'en in garments goryâ Lesang entwined my heart in love, We lookedâand vowed by him above, To live in oneâour bosoms prest, An infant hung upon my breast, And I in love and hope was blest. V. âTaught by my sire, he bounded o'er The pathless forest, like a roe, And slew the crocodile on the shore, Or bayed the rapid buffalo; And sure, unerring was his arrow, As the flaming bolt of heaven, In wide savannas, ravine narrow, The victim fell by morn, or even! And dauntless was his fiery soul, As the firm rock 'mid cataracts, Each scene of terror would unroll, Ere death did mark his gory tracks; We spread the bear-skin, and we slept I woke, and base Lesang had fled, Years rolled away, and still I wept, And classed him with the unknown dead. 'Twas when the autumnal jubilee Had filled each heart with joyous glee, And dimmed the eye of the Cherokee, Around lay buskined warriors, dead To glory's whoop, or danger's dread, On arid sands the feathery plume, The bow, and battle's rich costume, Were strewn, and soul impassive slept, And deadly still was the cloud-wrapt hill, Like lioness, ere burns her eye, When nought is left but to shriek and die. VI. âSwathed in its bands, yon orphan child, (O! sweet the thought, it knows not grief,) Hung on my breast, and we sought the wild, But oft gazed on the warrior-chief, Who lay, unknown, unseen, unheeding Guile, or ambush, bow or brand; But on the prairie war is breeding, And death is winged from the white man's hand; Through the dun gloom a vivid flash, A barbed bolt, the signal rung, An hundred desperadoes dashâ Our warriors to the battle sprung, But reeled and fell, and not a bow Their nerveless arms in terror drew; O'er marsh and glen I frantic flew, Lesang, Lesang, and is it you? Spare, spare himâOh! my hoary sire! 'Twas vain; their hands had lit the pyre. His blood is reeking on the turf, His embers rest upon the surf. VII. âMy frenzied eye, in burning wrath, Surveyed the basilisk of night, In reckless ire I crossed his path, And spoke in fell despair's dread might; 'Nayâseek not thus to 'scape the doom The Manitou prepares for thee, Beneath yon thicket's rayless gloom Thou shalt enjoy thy revelry; Say, demon, say is this the pledge Of deathless hope, and ceaseless love; Is that his couchâyon craggy hedge, Where thou hast doomed thy spouse to rove? Goâthou shalt sleep in shroudless dust, The crow shall weave thy funeral pall, Thy name by every tongue be curst And round thy fleshless form shall all The serpent brood agree to coil; Now take my malison to foil Thy exploits, and thy feats of glory; Goâthou shalt sleep in vestures gory; Thy banner, dyed in human slaughter, The wrathful Ioconda's daughter Shall wrest from thy ignoble hand, And furies round thy torture stand. VIII. âHe turned in scornâI sought yon height, With fury merged in dark despair, My shriek rung on the ear of night, And sprung the lion from his lair; A death-scene rushed upon my view, And screams of horror shook the glen, The poisoned arrow fiercely flew, A flash arrayed the gloom, and then The pierced heart's last convulsive throb Sent a faint shriekâI could not sob, The fountain of my tears had dried, And love, and hope, and passion died, But Lesang fellâand all was o'erâ My voice is hushed for evermore.â IX. Dark Manan sunk upon the knoll, Her flashing eye has lost its fire, Her noble mind and guileless soul No more the tale of death inspire; The wanderer scooped a shallow grave, And there he laid the forest flower, The last of all the savage brave, To whom their spirit, as a dower, Gave all this noble hemisphere; He took the boy, devoid of fear, And trained him, in a Christian land, To deeds of mercy, pure and bland; And oft the bard, at eventide, When nature veils her scenes of pride, Has heard him chant, along the dale, His mother's wild, and dreadful tale. A SEASIDE REVERIE. Aurora's sheen track fades along the sky, And orient beams vermilion it in pride, The crimson pendants from the vessel fly, That o'er the blue wave doth serenely glide; The rapid fury of the warring tide Is hushed along the platted woodland shore, And warbling larks through the blue ether ride, Carolling their honied music as they soar To those aerial fields, that wing ne'er fanned before. Congenial nature in the banquet shares Of renovated life, and living light, Decks her fair brow, her robe of splendour wears, And views, in time's clear mirror, with delight The form, that gilds her votary's raptured sight; The curlew joins the seagull in her glee, The mock-bird carols from the wood-crowned height, All living powers awake the jubilee, Whose kingdom is the land, or bright and waveless sea. Majestic Ocean! thy wide-rolling wave Paths the dread course, and is the joyless home Of the neglected sailor, or his grave; Stern fate hath doomed him o'er the world to roam, His pathway billowy, and his rocking dome The bark, careering mid the lurid storm; Maternal eld to watch his slumbers come Not, O, nor greets his vacant eye the form, That shone upon his visions when his heart was warm. He walks, with eagle-eye, the airy shrouds, Whose infant foostep pressed the flowery field, His dark canopy is the flood of clouds, O'er whom affection did a mansion build, And gratulate itself with fancies wild; O! when the smiling mother saw the eye Of childhood glow, and o'er the laughing weald The fair child sport in glowing ecstasy, Her clouded vision kenned not manhood's lowering sky. In the deep bosom of yon billowy flood Lies many a jewelâmany a form full dear, The ardent votary of ideal good, And the misanthropist with feelings sear; O'er coral fields the reckless billows bear The austere beauty, and wild libertine, And o'er their unseen tomb no pearly tear Is shed in sympathetic ruth divine, No plaintive lay is sung, around no flowers entwine. Wild youth, invested with the charms of heaven, Revels in baseless dreams, and phantasies, And woos a syren, till by furies driven, He wakes encircled by the warring skies, And agony succeeds his ecstasies; Exulting hope is merged in dark despair, The radiance of youthful fervour dies, Withered is every scene that once was fair, And fraught with poison the horrific simoom air. Wisdom is nurtured by the saddest scenes, The restless waves, menacing wo and death, Depict the soul, whose baseness never gleans A wandering thought of grandeur from the breath Of glory; oh! be mine the iron wreath Of moveless honour, and unchanging vow, That cannot crouch a heartless plea beneath To scorn all faith, and wear a placid brow Alone towards pampered guilt, whose tinselled vestures glow. THE MANIAC. Hark! The rosy foot, that pressed the bed of flowers, Like angels on the rainbow, trips around these massive towers; A smiling form, in golden vestures clad, As sunbeams o'er an arid heath, descends and makes me glad. And music on my sweet harmonious ear Floats like the strains of spirits from yon glory-cinctured sphere, My raptured soul is panting for the wing To sail o'er glowing floods of light, and hymns of Eden sing. Lo! he appears! O come my chosen lover! Like gales of perfume, that have flown the rich Ausonia over, My bosom swells to meet thy clasping hand, As fires of pure devotion urge the bright seraphic band. Hush! his pallid lips would sing the song of love, Like heaven-taught choristers within the deep palmetto grove, I see his jewelled pinions wave for flight, As stars that flash along the welkin in the dark-descending night. Alas! my vision is so dim, I cannot trace, Amid my dark, and wandering hair, the smile upon his face, I know his voice will tune a welcome back, For he did follow like the star in Luna's haloed track. Oh God! he wears around a snowy shroud, And seems amid it like a seraph on a fleecy cloud; I wove a blooming garland for his brow, But ah! I cannot touch him, or he ne'er would break his vow. He's goneâbut lives within my burning brain, As walks the mermaid o'er the waters of the rolling main, And dies the notes of his soft silver lute,â The charm has fledâand I am loneâand all the mansion's mute. [There's a dome in yon star, that is floating on high] There's a dome in yon star, that is floating on high, And shedding its brilliance o'er the blue fields above, Where the tear trickles not, nor is uttered the sigh, But the thoughts are all gentle, and the dictates of love; Where the wreath, that encircles the ivory brow, Is culled from the flowers entwined round the trellice, And the honied accents of affection, that flow, Melt on the ear, like pure notes that are warbled from bliss; Where the soul is untainted by passion, or guile, And is pure as the dew that vermilions the lawn, Where the mien of delight wears a cherubic smile, Like the gilded Aurora, when she heralds the dawn; Where diaphanous streams from the mild bosom well, And are tinctured by smiles as they ripple along The shore of the heart, where the clear currents swell When sublimely is chaunted the mellifluent song; Where the groves of perfume are amaranthine, And the breeze, that fans the interminable fields, The breath of the Being, whose bright glories shine O'er the emerald lawn, that his veilless eye gilds; Where the habitants of bliss on viewless wings roam, And warble the strains of devotion and love, Whose echo is caught in the musical dome, And floats o'er the sapphire walks, gilded above, Like pyramidal incense from gratitude's shrine; Where bliss hymeneal is untainted, and pure, And imparting through termless time blessings divine, Like sunbeams that flash from the ruby-wreathed ewer. [The night-hawks fly] The night-hawks fly Along the sky, And fan the welkin with a hollow sound, The dusky veil Of eve o'er dale, And mountain's hung in vapoury folds around. The lily's bell Perfumes the dell, Ere curling petals sleep upon the dew, Beneath the shade Of willows laid, Past scenes of joy attract the mental view. In yon high nest, The ringdoves rest, And spread their dappled wings around their young, So love did knit A mantle, and sit Above my fearsâaround a bright shield hung. 'Mid lilac bowers The joyous hours, In mellow tinctures, softly flew along A vernant shore; Alas! no more Those pure hours cheer, save in ideal song. The fires of mirth, The rays of worth, Are quenched in the gulf of grief and wo, The bliss of love, The guileless dove, Have fled, with all their varnished charms, below. The heart's full throb, And sorrow's sob Unreal hopes can never hush to rest, The lone alcove, Where fairies rove, And wanderers pause, is nature's vermeil breast. There I would lay The live-long day, And tune my roundelay, or madrigal; Nor leave the bower, Till death's cold hour, And leave it then my consecrated pall. COLUMBIA; A SAPPHIC ODE. Eagle of the West! from thine eyrie thou Didst stoop, and wrest from grandeur's diadem The choicest gem, that glittered there in pride Invaluable. And Freedom's banner, hung upon thy wing, Was bathed in the fountain of the despot's heart, And waved in light triumphal o'er a land Invincible. O'er bigot rage, and feudal tyranny, Jewelled regalia, and baronial pomp, The car of freeborn energies was driven By the unshackled soul. Star of the bright West! thy celestial beams Oppression blew upon the crest of glory, And spangled o'er the waving gonfalon With the rays of heaven. The green-wood arbour, the pellucid stream, The rural meadow, wood-crowned prairie's plain, The sea majestic, and the city's scene, Thy effulgence gilds. Thy sheeny halo fires the eagle's crest, When her undazzled eye is on the fight, Or when her wings are spread above the hall Of legislation. The dreadless lion walks amid thy blaze, Eyes his winged compeer in her heavenward flight, Spares the wild victim, bounds upon his prey, And glories in the war. Yet thy irradiation brightest burns Upon the foaming billow of the ocean,â The picaroon in his felucca flies Afar in terror. The red flag, crescent, glowing tricolor, Bow to the eagle on her ocean wing, And spirits greet the glories of the realm Rising transcendant. Eagle of the West! Star of Glory dawning! With pencil dipped in Iris hues, and song Echoed from heaven, we'll twine the fleur-de-lis Round victory's brow. MY NATAL SCENES; AN IDYL. Tossed from the nursery on a frowning world, By wailing gales o'er boiling surges hurled, Lured by the beacon's tantalizing glow, That fitful gleams o'er scenes of bitter wo, Condemned to drag the manacles of wrath Along our course, and track our reeking path, Sweet mem'ry, being's sheen and brilliant star, When hushed is terror, and the din of war, Illumes the dome of mind, the lone heart's cell, And, as the streams of curling amber well From the translucent fountain in the grove, Gilds with celestial rays the forms we love. But, as the ivy, while it clasps the tree, And throws its tendrils bright with many a dye, Infuses poison with its firm embrace, And blasts the verdure, while it adds a grace, The gilded visions of saturnian hours, When beauty's fingers culled the roseate flowers, And wove a garland for the infantine brow, And waved the agnus castus' pensile bough, Rush on the mind with mingled joy and pain, As rose and hawthorn join to decorate the plain. Yet the high mount, that rears its snowy head Majestic o'er the stream's pellucid bed, Whose azure waves, that rippled in their flow, Oft bore the youth in wild meanders slow, And every dell, and bowering grotto dun, With golden harvests, bronzed in summer's sun, And laughing meads, where sportive zephyrs play, And o'er the green-bosomed lawn attune the lay Of blithesome pleasure, and celestial love, Where the fond eye gazed on the perfumed grove Borne on the wings of flashing fancy, rise In renovate and bright transparencies. With thee, dear L??????, in the days of youth, Ere love had fled, and died the charms of truth, Oft have I roved along the sunny mead, And tuned to jollity the rural reed, When nature, smiling, round the grazing flocks Waved her bright wand; and shook ambrosial locks, When fawns in gambols trod the flowery plain, And bending spirits, at the ringdove's strain, Struck their thrilled wires unto the songs of heaven, And sung the glories unto mortals given; And, when the carols of the soaring lark Floated in air, ere sunbeams did embark Hyperion's cohort through the pale-blue skies, And gild the welkin with irradiate dies, Nature unfurled her gemmed robe around, And bloomed in living splendour at the sound The linnet's melody in aspen grove, That fluctuates when the light-wing'd zephyrs move, The cooing turtle's song in vigil hour, The minstrel's songstress in her darkling bower, The swallow, twittering on her plumed wing, The jovial mock-bird of the roseate spring, The crested cuckoo in the forest's gloom, And all the lyrists that flit round the bloom, Regale the bard of solitary mood, And, with their thousand choirs, make vocal every wood. Such were the pleasures of our orient years, That rolling time to distant vision bears; Distance to fancy lends delightful hues, And gilds the eye in retrospective views; In youth each fountain is a nectared ewer, And every scene extatic, bright, and pure. The clustering vine that fragrant incense yields, The golden pomp, and âgarniture of fields,â The sheeny cascade, silvered by the rays Of solar brilliance, and meridian blaze, Deck radiant nature,âthrow a winning charm Around the heart with vestal virtue warm; And, when in fury foaming torrents dash, And fires of wrath around the victim flash, And peals of thunder rend the shuddering frame Recoiling from the forked, death-clad flame, We fondly gaze, through time's dark vista, o'er The scenes of beauty on a blooming shore, Drop the sad tearâand chase our fickle fate, Shrouded in vestures black, and desolate. FANCY'S ROMAUNT. I stood on Zion; and methought (a dream Of ingulphed ages o'er me came) there stood An hoary minstrel by me, and the gleam Of his unwonted flashing eye, imbued With fire, that long had slept in solitude, Illumed his furrowed visage, and arrayed His form in splendourâwayward was his mood Of feverish being, and a fitful shade Of unknown anguish passedâbut on his vitals prey'd. He stood before me with his caftan rent, And silvery beard far streaming to the breeze, His unstrung lyre was tunelessâand he bent O'er its sad, worn golden wires, like the freize Of some lone fane o'er tomb-stones, or the greeze, Where countless votaries thronged, that far winds Its untrod pathway round the dome, where trees, Time's moaning relics, sigh, and fate unbinds The virgin lyrist from her shrine, where worshipped noble minds An unknown Being sketched in mortal garb; Around the untombed minstrel myst'ry flung Her sable mantleâbut the thoughts unbarb The heart, that slumbers in its cell, and, stung To noble plenitude, like bright stars hung In yon aerial concave, the soul Springs to impart its fire; when mind is wrung To frenzied madness, spurning time's control, The flood of passion pours, clandestine scenes unroll. He woke from his deep, unbroken reverieâ Not war's fierce, untamed, courser bounds away 'Mid vollied thunders with triumphal glee, And shakes the gory battle-fieldânot the fray Of ocean's billowy waves, when murky day Retires, and sheds not light upon the scene Of the wreck'd bark's despairâas the gray Genius of time, when burst his voice, I ween, Seem half so terrible, for their armory's seen. He broke mute silence, and his arched brow Seemed clothed in jewels, and his tow'ring frame Of adamant,âand fires irradiate glow, In one full halo of unearthly flame, Around him; and his eye's wild wrath to tame No mortal power would dare. The vision flew Through boundless space, when pealed his awful name, And rising empires my fixed optics drew, While tuned the bard his lyre, and sung how nations grew. âProstrate Judea! darling child of heaven! God was thy hierarch, and gracious King, Before his war-car hostile hordes were driven, And in Moriah did warbling music fling On high melodious praiseâchoirs, enamoured, wing Their terrene flight to mingle glory's lays With adoration's songsâearth, elysium ring, And votive shrines waft censers' perfumeâpraise, Honour and devotion crowned blest Ãlia's holy days. âBut low-born chicane, and intrigue beguile A nation of its grandeur, and infest Ambition's dome, and wisdom's hall, and smile Upon the railing turmoilâdregs congest, And poison oft the banquet of the blest; The vulgar heart enshrouds the hottest fires, The unknown start, and lords pursue the jest, Freedom and truth outvie the mob's desires, But lawless rapine lights the noblest nation's pyres. âLo! mailed avengers on the ingrate rush, In madness fly the ungorged eagles o'er The heaven-doomed clime, and their broad pinions brush Away the pride of ages, and the shore, Where angels love to linger, peals the roar Of ruin, and the poltroon's cry awakes The fierce fanatic's vauntâand on high soar The proud fane's fragments, where the streaming flakes Of flame illume the sky, and heaven's bright mirror breaks. âDebasement drove them to the feats of hell, And nature shuddered at her children's fall, Frenzied despair, and frantic fury swell Alecto's blood-fed orgiesâbut the pall Of blackness shrouds the unholy festival; Rebels they were, alas! they loved the slime Of the foul quagmire, and the sordid thrall Of luxury and lust, above the clime, The Eden portionedâplantedâblessed by a kind King sublime. âLone Desolation stalks through mirthless streets, And reigns sole monarch of the desert land, Where God once deigned to sway,âthe Sovereign greets From glory's high arch, where, amid his band Of bitterns, waves the sceptre of command, And gleams the jewelled diadem of sate, His voiceless realm exultingâhis stern hand Upholds his silent mandateâand the state Of once bright Palestine nought but heaven can renovate. âWhere are thy glories, lost Judea! where? Where are the pomp and splendour of thy fane? Aerial strains float not through listless air, Nor beauties linger on thy ravished plain. Where are thy high-soul'd heroes? Can again The voice of dauntless chivalry awake The dormant energies of David's reign? Can glory's heaven-descended, full beams break The spell of bondage, gild the Gallilean lake? âBehold! yon cloud, that veils the eastern skies, Secrets the angel of exhaustless love, It gathers not, but bright transparencies Reveal where harbingers of mercy move; Doth not thy soul dilate, when from above Descends the herald to invoke the bloom, And rays of heaven upon the clime, where grove, Hill, dale, stream, rock, and nameless tomb, Attract love, awe, and veneration, though in gloom? âO towery Babylon! cinctured bright With massive bulwarksâwhere the gilded groves Of spires and turrets shed the solar light, When eve in darkness reignedâthy splendour proves A fairy pageantâand the wand'rer roves Through blood-paved palaces; the dragon loves To slumber in the monarch's couchâand mirth And maudlin revel quake, when ireful moves The fiery besom o'er the startled earthâ And heaven's dire fiat caused Chaldea's dismal dearth. âShe fell by pampered luxuryâthe hall Of Semiramis and Belshazzar gleamed With diverse instrumentsâat glory's call The one her courser sped where loudly screamed The raven o'er red heaps of foesâwhere beamed The trophied car of triumphâwhere the dome Of fame immortal tow'redâand honour deemed He built earth's empire; fiery spirits roam, And make the tombless battle-field their foemen's home. âThe other reigned amid a wilderness Of dazzling glory, and his gem-crowned brow Beamed peerless mirthâwhite robed panders bless The glorious feastâarchitraves throw Lamps' kindling lightâand the full banquet's glow Of golden cups, and embossed lavers, crowns The festive domeâarch'd vaults, and swung globes strow Delicious incense roundâbut darkly frowns Impending vengeance, lo! wreathed flame the palace bounds. âThe voiceless, viewless angel hovered o'er The festal cityâflower-wreathed maidens dance Around the festooned fane of Belâthe shore Of grand Euphrates hears the proud steed prance Along towered wallsâafar the Persian's lance Mocks the bright sunbeams, and the clarion's bray Echoes a fierce defiance; but the glance Of the determined captain lights the fray, And nought can crush the band where all their lord obey. âNow, save the storm-lash'd pyramid, where sleep Creation's lords in aweless grandeur, all The gemm'd land is one vast Golgothaâdeep Lie time's vaunting demigods, to the call Of honour, or of fame unknownâthe pall Of desolation shrouds themâsaint and sage, Monarch and slave, in foul corruption's thrall Are held mute compeers, and the guileless page Of refluent Time doth class them equals of the age. âThe feudal manacles no longer bind The low-born vassalâthrough the slime and gore Of war and bondage, slaves no longer wind Their way, and drag their chains, for the rich store Of death is mingled clayâand vipers soar Above distinction; chainless mind obeys Not the tiar'd despotânervous powers pour Tinselled treasures into tyrants' cellsârays Of thought celestial break debasement's tainting haze. âImmortal Greece! the dim gem glory leaves, When on her eagle-pinions, ere the ire Of freedom's foe the fane of grandeur cleaves, She seeks the lone wild, where the vestal fire Of virtue burnsâunshackled souls aspire! The quenchless embers of thy funeral pyre The despot's fell breath blew to vivid flame: Though long the willow wore thy warbling lyre, It livesâand cannot dieâthy free-born name,â And every age shall add a jewel to thy fame. âThine was the bard, whose noble ardour lives In freedom's child, and fires his glowing eye, Thine the proud sophist, whose great name survives Conception's crude ideas of mystery; Thine were the heroes, on whom destiny Attended, like the lightning on the storm; Thine is the clime, where patriot souls will fly In freedom's holy cause sublimely warm, And tread thy hallowed strand, and frown at despot's form. âDestruction waved his besom o'er thee, Rome Through pillared streets, and festooned fanes of pride, The vaulted palace, and the peasant's dome, Decay asserts her dismal reignâthe nide Of feathered rovers throng the hall, or ride Unrivalled in triumphal marchâand chant Victorious pÃ¦ans o'er the clime, where's died Each patriot passion, that could charm or daunt, Or shed a glow o'er her, that worth made glory's haunt. âEgeria was the child of fancy, wrought Into a sybil, and a Pythoness, By the credulity of man, who sought To deck a being formed to view and bless; She and the flamen raised Rome's glory less Than the low archer of her phalanx'd host; Her martial virtue, and her fearlessness Were her omnipotent deitiesâwhen lost The Pantheon fell, and pride fled from BaiÃ¦'s coast. âThe triple tiar graces ill the brow Of him, whose palace is the Lateran, The pomp of gemm'd canonicals, whose glow Was dazzlingâthe voice of wrath, from whose ban The soul recoiled, and quivering lips, all wan, Ejaculated ruthâthe ermined power, Have fallen in their acmeâfreeborn man No more in cells of priestcraft drags his hour Of wretchednessâbut resumes the soul's celestial tower. âTime's mansionsâcitiesâlords, in one dread tomb Are now immergedâand other monarchs rise, And reign o'er other climesâthe dread simoom Of vengeance hath blackened the bright skies Of glory and of fame. The obsequies Of nations time performs, and in the dust Lays all the train of pride; the conqueror dies, And earth receives himâbut the green clods burst, And winds herald his ashes to their mansion erst.â The minstrel turnedâand radiant flashed his eyeâ âLo! where the Atlantic laves a perfum'd shore, And the winged glories of a distant sky, In lambent fires of beauty, hover o'er, A nation reigns; in all the vaunted lore Of eastern sages, ne'er a reign, like this, Was sketched in fancy; the shade of power bore From bondaged climes, now slavery's dark abyss, The bay, the laurel, palm, to trophy freedom's bliss. âNo proud regalia of imperial state, Nor feudal seignories of pomp and power, Nor pride baronial mark the noble fate Of heaven-blest Columbia; but the hour, That sealed her freedom, brought a blissful dower Of wise equality in human kind; Her patriot chiefs, 'mid glory's splendour, tower, A golden chain each filial heart doth bind, And harps in tones of love fling music on each wind. âShe owns no autocrat, who drives his car O'er prostrate slaves, and lives but in their doom; The light, that flashed from her refulgent star, Will wane when ruin shrouds the world in gloom, But ne'er till then! for the blasting simoom Of chilling tyranny will rage remote.â He said; I stood upon a lonely tomb Amid the platted broomlandâand the note Of the soft nightingale through ether fields did float. THE DESPERATE MAID. WRITTEN AT SEVENTEEN. Sad sat a maiden on the shore, And viewed the tumbling lake, She listened to the dismal roar, And heard the billows break. She saw high rocks their mountains raise The rolling waves that washed their base, The water dashing up the bays, Which lashed the rocky vase. Loosened was her golden hair, Hung in tresses down her breast Or floating to the chilly air, Winged from the lake that knew no rest. Wan was her form and pale her mien, Sorrow marked her visage bright; Fled was her eye's full glow serene, Life was now a winter night. Her snowy breast was open wide, On it all the winds did blow, It felt the cold and chilly tide, Yet calmed was not its heated glow. Her changing pulse beat short and slow, As she heard the raging roar; Quick they ran with every blow, The rolling waves did strike the shore. Torn were her feet with flinty stones, Bare her head to every blast; Soon did she think to find the bones, Of him she loved best and last. On every gale were borne his groans, Each roaring wave but told them o'er; Each beast rehearsed his deadly moans; His boat was wrecked upon the shore. She laid her heated, glowing head Upon the cold and frosty earth; Thought on the woes of him now dead, For whom she left her father's hearth. Perhaps they now will search in vain, To find her whom they loved so dear; Little think they she dares complain In sullen notes, by lake so drear. These direful thoughts did rack her breast, As the tempest howled along; Such are the thoughts that find no rest, Which to aching hearts belong. She heard full oft the owl's wild screech, Which seemed the awful, dismal dirge; Oft she sprang her love to reach;â As oft she met the cruel surge. Till, rising on the growing breeze, A dreadful crash did strike her ear; She started from her bended knees, Wild with love, and mad with fear. She eyed the lake from side to side, She saw its waters dyed with blood; Nought could be seen upon its tide; Nothing but the foaming flood. She looked again;âan object rose, It was her William on the vergeâ She stretched her arms to him incloseâ Off was he borne by roaring surge. She heard her William's final shriek And left the low and dreadful shore, Of rocks she climbed the highest peakâ She plungedâand heard no more. THE OUTLAW'S BRIDE. In a lone vale, unknown to pomp and state, Beloved by few, unwilling to be great, Yet pressed by them in love and faith sincere, Inmates of penury, beyond a fear For simple life, save that the hydra head Of vice might rise in their secluded shed, Congenial souls, by virtue joined in love, With not a wish that flew beyond the grove, Lucius and Laura saw their offspring rise, Like gilded stars along cerulean skies, Their minds expanding like the blushing flowers Beneath bright sunbeams, and prolific showers. Wild was the scenery, and an arid heath, Emblem of desolation, and of death To those who revel in voluptuous mirth, And scorn the treasure of ignoble birth, Spread round the cot, that stood within a glade Which labour's hand had opened from the shade, But patient toil had drawn from nature's breast A store, that made the unambitious blest, And crowned the weary cares of sire and son With hope of wealth by wise exertions won. Each infant mien within the cot was bland, And all was neat, for Laura's toilless hand Had spread a chaste and graceful scene around, O'er which the fawn and kid, with sportive bound Enhanced the blushing maiden's merry glee, And nature held a joyful jubilee. When from the wood, where fell the gnarled oak, And towering pine beneath his nervous stroke, Or the far field, enriched with golden sheaves, That for the granary the planter leaves, The joyous husband smiles to meet the eye Of her he loves, nor heaves a bitter sigh; When gathered round autumnal fires, that burn And gild the scene to welcome their return, The social circle blend their rural smiles, Unheeding envy, and her wanton wiles, Survey past scenes and hope for joys to come, The weeping eye, condemned to gaze and roam, Might rest upon that quiet spot, and glow In sparkling fervour o'er a placid brow. Amid the calm scenes of those gladsome days A sullen darkness, and a sunless haze, A fitful wildness, and elinguid mood, Came o'er the cheerful tenant of the wood; His fields were fruitless, and his home unknown To rustic pleasure, and the honied tone Of love and friendship, gratitude, content, With moody sadness and despair unblent. His board was crowned with viands, known before To those alone, to whom the ample store Of fortune had descended, with its train Of luxuries, attendant on her reign; Yet 'mid the banquet, wondrous to the view Of her, whose wild imagination flew Not o'er her hills to search the aulic dome, And know its pleasuresâbut ne'er thought to roamâ He sat unquiet, unallured by all The glowing, rich, and vinous festival; A pang would rack his soul, the iron there Was treasuring fast the horrors of despair. The leaden eye of Laura could not pierce His darkling breast, nor learn his terrors fierce; As fond philosophy ascends the height, And views the lava that illumes the night, Bends o'er the crater, where the volcan's flame Not billowy floods could subjugate and tame, Hears the dread rumbling of the giant's car Shake the proud height with subterranean war, But cannot penetrate the scene of strife, Nor scan the gulf with deadly horrors rife; So guilt corrodes the bosom of despair, While conscience, like the lion from his lair, Asserts her empire, o'er the madding soul Doth all its sins, unholy deeds, unroll; When racks the brain with terrors none can tell, Displays the writhing agonies of hell, And bids to hope and heaven a long farewell! But the fierce fires by shame and guilt represt, Assuaged by none, within the hopeless breast In vivid fury, not exhaustion burn, And unknown miseries proffered solace spurn. Yet, when in midnight visions, reason slept, And lovely Laura on her pillow wept, Delirious Fancy, in her airy flight, Invoked the appalling demons of the night, And told a tale, from which the soul recoiled,â The sense was frenzied, and the life-blood boiled, The voice of Lucius gave the dread command, His eyeballs flashed, and in his gory hand A sabre gleamedââthe noble deed is done, The miser falls, the golden prize is won.â Low murmurs now his pallid lips declare, Before his vision frowned the fiend Despair, And shook his brand amid the hydra brood Of withering spectres lured by human blood; The incantation he could not dispel, Nor exorcise the fiends of wrath, who dwell Within his burning brain; his straining eye Saw nought but dread, undying agony. âPoor guileless Austin! thine it was to feel The ruthless brand, the undeserved steel, Edgeless but for my adamantine heartâ O God! my hand impelled the deadly dart! Demons of Death! ye strained the dreadful bow, And smiling saw the reeking life-blood flow, Ye nerved my arm, and rung his funeral knell, Ye are my compeersâand my dome is hell!â He paused and slept; a ghastly smile was seen Upon his lipâbewildered was his mien. But Oh! what anguish rent a woman's breast, What moonless darkness on her senses prest! No sound is heard beneath the thatched roof, But low, and far, and rapid tramps a courser's hoof. âLucius! thy crime is known to Him on high, Prepare thy shroud, and pall, for thou must die! The sword of Justice o'er thy fate-doomed head Is hung, to avenge the blood that thou hast shed; Vengeance hath heard, and bared her crimson arm, Her eye is on thee, her thou canst not charm.â The frantic woodsman saw the massive chain, And owned the dread of murder's purple grain, A horse, a bar, a dungeon, meet his eye, All that remains is to confess and die! Before his view the fatal scene appears, The husband dies, the wife is left to tears. The hope of youth, when every scene is fair, Unknown deep wo, and pleasure-blighting care, The nectared joys of matrimonial love, The peace of age, and happiness above, Have lost their richness, and the soul in gloom Seeks her bright home beyond the darkling tomb. Reason deserts her awe-commanding throne, Her soul is void, and every passion lone, Save when dread memory recalls the hours, That flew along a brilliant field of flowers; When hope was smiling, blissful dreams beguiled The lonely tenant of the desert wild; The days of toil then ushered nights of rest, Each eye was glowing, and each passion blest. But when bewildering miseries inurn The mind, while fires of fitful fury burn, When the warm heart, in agony immured, By nothing bright or lovely is allured; It is as if the human frame entombed, While yet the vital spark the breast illumed, Felt every pang inflicted by the worm, And every gripe he makes upon the form; But cannot frame a curse to fright away The revellers jubilant over mortal clay; Nor lift a hand the reptiles low to crush, Who hold dominion, and in armies rush. Laura, who once with joyous fervour hailed The glad return of Lucius, and regaled His hours of solitude with bonny love, And roved delighted through the maple grove, Who pledged her hand, and yielded up her breast To cheer his loneliness, his heart divest Of all the stings a reckless world will give, And all the darts that rankle there and thrive, No more with rosy foot treads o'er the lawn, And heralds with her radiant smile the dawn; Dark is her soul, her every hope is dead, Misfortune's baneful vial now has shed A blighting poison through her graceful frame, A storm around her home, a stigma on her name. Her cot is roofless, and the scene is mute That echoed once the flagelet and flute, Her fields uncultured, and her children fair, Like silver down upon the viewless air, Scattered through varied climes unsought, unknown, Deaf to a mother's prayers, or mellow tone, Or laid in sunless mansions premature, And shroudless, on a wild and desert moor. Round the lone fountain, digged by hands beloved, Musing on other scenes, she oft has roved, While the clear wave, that glistened sheeny there, Flung back the bending form, and imaged out Despair. ADIEU. The winged hours flew along, we metâ Embracedâand partedâbut oh! yet There was a rapture in the eye, A veilless glow of ecstasy, A treasure in that warm embrace, A lingering smile upon the face; There was the soul in every word My revelling ear with ardour heard, There was a charm in every tread, That thrilled my heart, and pleasure bred. A thousand loves were vision glancing, And round Eliza's bright form dancing; And all the scene of full delight Was winning, beautiful, and bright. 'Tis heaven to meet the forms we love, When our dull eyeballs widely rove, Around the earth, o'er vacancy, Nor catch a glimpse of beauty nigh; But oh! to mingle souls, and partâ It seems a death blow to the heart. Yet, yet, we meet ere long again, And then we'll link a golden chain. INOSCULATION. With the bright fires of youth and beauty glowing, And heaven-lit hearts, imbued in virtue's mould With love celestial, while hope's tide was flowing, They met; before their vision been unrolled Earth's fairy scenes, and rapture is bestowing Her trophied meed,âher gilded wreath of gold; And amber skies diffuse the ambient air, And every scene of life is beautiful and fair. Oh! while the youthful tide is laving hearts, That feel intensely every bitter jeer Of a demon world, ere bright hope departs, And stygian Time the Lethean pall doth wear, And tortured soul is steeled 'gainst sorrow's darts,â Oh! then to feel the hand of beauty wipe the tear Of grief awayâher bosom, oped to share Life's piercing woesâsure heaven is dwelling there. Earth is a joyless sphere; but oh! if bliss E'er her cherubic smile to mortals deigns, She lingers in the soft connubial kiss, She warms the blood in matrimonial veins, And thrills the rapture of our happiness. Unenvied celibacy quiet feigns, And vaunts the unshared banquet of the soul, But all his joys spring from the brimming bowl. The baseless pictures of a wild romance, And all the poet's termless fancy yields, Thrill not the bosom like the faintest glance Of sweet domestic love; it brightly gilds Each sceneâin transport's beatific trance Angels are dancing o'er the flowery fields, And He, whose name's Benevolence and Love, Sheds his sweet smile o'er heaven's wide realms above. When soul expansive grasps the blissful boon, Dear woman's heartâand love by rolling years Is nurturedâand smiles the hymeneal moon In ceaseless glow, like stars along the spheres Cinctured by the flushing radiance of June; Primeval hope her Eden vestures wears, Exuberant pleasure cheers the heart of feeling, And silver streams o'er laughing lawns are stealing. When childhood's eye was glowing with the joys, That spring from life beheld in theory, When the infantine hand grasped nature's toys, And the light foot, beneath a radiant sky, Was dancing o'er the mead, and the soft voice Was heard full jocund; then our bosoms prest, And the rural reveries of hope were blest. Another, and a fairer being shares The sweet affection of that feeling breast, To sorrow's view each holy scene appears In Tisiphone's pallâand demons wrest Our transient pleasures bought with bitter tears; Still Virtue folds thee in her jewelled vest, And lovely woman, clasped in rapture's arms, Dispels the gloom of wo with her celestial charms. MONOLOGUE. NAPOLEON. SceneâSt. Helena. TimeâSunset. The flaming sun sinks on the ocean's breast, And seeks his wavy dome 'mid coral groves; His beams, in opaque scintillations, illume The desert crags, and bronze the leafless wood. So sunk my peerless glory on the plain Of dread Waterloo, when my tricolor, First drooped in battle, and the eagle's wing Fanned the vapid air in her crestless fight; So died the laurel wreath of Victory, That cinctured bright my imperial brow, And was crested by the dark crimson plume Waving, a banner, 'mid the din of war. Creation's Lord is Saint Helena's slave! Ambition's fount is quenchless and its wave Instils a ruthless madness through the soul, And the unsated palate burns for aye; Like the fell fluid from the dipsas' tooth, The burning tongue to quench corroding fires Craves the oft replenished cup, but finds, alas! The flame is nurtured by the ceaseless draught. O! in ambition's gory path I dared The fiercest flashes from the flame of death, And climbed the Gallic throne o'er breathless hills Of shroudless foes. God, in his sovereign wrath, When Pandemonium's fiends in artifice, And baneful bitterness, had failed to win The burning wreath, that harrows up the brain To deeds diabolic, commissioned earth A fell peerless demon to engender. She chose the gaunt hyena, to depict The outward monsterâheaven hurled scathing fires To light the heart of adamant, that hell Had sacked its dire domains to deck, ensconce, And enshrine with liquid flame; he towered Lord of the world, and harbinger of death. Conscience enseared, and riven every chord That tuned a thought to high magnificence, He gazed alike on minaret and spire, Crescent and cross, mosque and fane; prostrate fell Before the shrine of Hera's sage, or God; But chiefly adoration hung upon The formless being, anarchy; who reigned In aulic domes all untrod and voiceless. From the giant's mouth a volcan poured Its sheeted flame o'er empires and the flood Wafted the besom of desolation; His morbid eye beheld no splendid good, Domestic peace, or public worth, but wrath Blasted the joys of beauty and of hope. I am that being! heaven's unwilling scourge! For I would burst my manacles, and ride, Imperial Autocrat, o'er the wreck Of universal nature; I would light The concave in an ocean blaze, and tune Creation's requiem 'mid the dying yells Of her slaughtered habitantsâthe sound Of shrieks and lyres would mingle in a flood Of symphony unequalled and sublime. The murky skies should roll, like parchment, o'er The fire-clad welkin, and the expiring groan Of nature raise my loud triumphal song. Alas! the radiant sun has fled, and night Wraps in her massive folds of darkness The hero of her love; upon this height, In giddy loneliness, and desolate, I stand, enveloped by the iron pall, Whose folds shall wrap me in oblivion; And yon wild flood, that roars in thunders round The storm-lashed cliff, shall chant my lonely dirge Along this Albion; and the foot shall tread Heedless on his grave whose voice could call Angels, or demons; at whose sovereign beck Myriads of hands would sketch his name Upon the glorious heavens, and array His tomb with the halo of undying light. [I love to linger on the hours] I love to linger on the hours, That thrilled my infant heart with happy gladness, When wreaths were culled from blushing flowers, That hung around ambrosial bowers, And ne'er was seen the Gorgon form of sadness. There we can fondly, deeply dwell Nor heave a cankering thought in sighing, The wild-bird's song, the village bell, The laughing mead, the flowery dell, In fancy bright, around the mind are flying. Each scene of youth is consecrate, And rushes through the soul in airy brightness, We heed not then our fickle fate, Our minds with hope and love dilate, And smiling woodnymphs trip around with lightness. Beneath the oak, not drooping willow, Laid, when the flashing sun rolled down in glory, The beryl turf my vernant pillow I loved to gaze upon the billow Rolling afarâand list wild fancy's story. The unholy deeds, that rack the brain, And wring the bounding soul with torture, Are all unknownâthe lyric strain, That floats along the blooming plain, Wafts no base homage to the ear of hauteur. O could I trace my being o'er, And hang upon the sunny spots that brighten, Mind could not find a fairer shore, A finer field, a nobler store, Than childhood pure and holy love to heighten. Obscure, ignoble, and unknown, E'en while a vivid fancy's brightly glowing, I'd seek my natal plains all lone, And listen to the songster's tone, And drink the balm from nature's bosom flowing. WINTER. In sheeted robes of iciness, Aloft on sweeping pinion, The sire of storms and dreariness Resumes his wild dominion; The green lawn's robed in bedded snow, And Autumn, nature's darling child, Has fled, and veiled her golden brow, And every scene is cold and wild. The chilling stream unchiming flows Beneath the icy mantle, thrown O'er weald and rill, and, deeply froze, No eye can mark its torrents flown; So grief has barred the vital flood, That whilom flew at sorrow's tone, But rapid pours the boiling blood Within my bosomâthere alone. The ice-tapestried, leafless grove, Tinged by the yellow solar glow, Doth in fantastic figures move, Or rattle on the crust below; So through my soul, at misery's throe, The reliques of sweet pleasures rush, But ah! so changed, eye cannot know Their fairy forms in livid flush. Oh! all is drear and desolate! But sweeter to my lonely mind Is winter's bloomless, fruitless state, Than all the pomp and glow, that bind The eager gaze in revelry; The spirits of a fair clime wind Their way around to charm the eye, That manhood's guile and venom blind. Congenial Winter! like my spirit, Gloomy, dark, companionless, From thy breath I can inherit Balm to quench the bitterness, That poisons every nectared chaliceâ I love thee in thy glacial dress, For thy gale's not fraught with malice, But thousand scenes are left to bless. While o'er desert scenery roving, And the gale is whistling by, While tender forms are bright and loving, And fancy gilds the flashing eye, The blissful realms that hang above, On fleecy folds sublimely moving, Raise our hopes to praise and love, And heaven is then its rapture proving. [Here on this velvet-mantled lawn] Here on this velvet-mantled lawn, Smiling beneath the rosy dawn, The breeze breathes incense from the daisies bedding, The musk-rose blooms around, and flings A nectared burden on the wings Of fragrant Zephyr, who is lightly treading O'er the fields of dewy flowers, Or above is fanning bowers, The violet or the flaunting woodbine's spreading; The Eden scene is purely fair, And forms, that flit around it, wear The carmine robes that deck the hour of wedding. Here the odorous yellow jasmine, And the virgin eglantine, Through groves of platted evergreen are creeping, And when the gale is rustling by, And cooling an effulgent sky, Beneath the shielding shade the lover lone is sleeping Oh! blissful are his fairy dreams, And radiant are the blushing beams, That gild the eye of beauty absence weeping; Now on a blooming, sunny spot, And cinctured by a flower-spread grot, His peaceful hamlet stands, and fawns in glee are leaping. Here perched upon the verdant bay, The merry mockbird tunes his lay, And countless choristers are music flinging On the hours, that linger still In dance along the winding rill, Ere, o'er empyreal plains their wild flight winging, They mingle in the flood of age, And leave to compeers frolic's stage; The lark, the robin, and the redbird, singing, In carols woo, the festoons through, The throbbing heart to share a part Of joys, that spring not from the nerve that torture's wringing. Here, o'er the full and airy soul Sweet streams of baneless rapture roll, And holy bliss o'er tender chords is stealing, Unruffled is the rose-twined bower, Delightful is the joyous hour, That sheds its soothing balm o'er tortured feeling; The sky-lark mounts to chant her song, The eagle, heavenly dales along, Is heralding celestial angels wheeling Through the amber skies afarâ The dome of each is a flashing star, And on each riven chord is felt the hand of healing. A CANTLET. When winter winds, wailing, Tear the fair robes of Autumn, When icy hills, sailing, Hear the rude polar drum; When wanton wilds, wearing Their mantles of flowers, The stern gale is searing, And divesting the bowers; When wood pigions wild wing Their way to the tropic, And the turtle-doves sing Not, with love, lay, and topic; When woman, weald, woodland, Are silent and sighing, And the smiles of the mien bland Are drooping, and dying; When, wielding with wasting His rod of dominion, The wind-god is blasting Sweet Spring on the pinion; When winged winds winnow The lilies fresh blooming, And red perfumed minnow, And beauty is looming; I would watch the fleet wild-bird Careering through ether, I would catch the sweet watchword, And seek the far heather. I would ramble through wild groves, And the isles of the blest, And list the thronged ringdoves Coo love from their nest. ENNUI. There is a dark and rayless hour, that hangs A mystic mantle o'er our dearest pleasures, Attended not by agonizing pangs, A ruthless ruin of our tinkling treasures, When the Eumenides, with Gorgon mien, Call their dire progeny, the empusae, To lay the dark domains of death, the scene Of mornless gloom, and dreadful destiny, Before the startled vision, and array Their legions in a phalanx;âbut when worth, Nor love, nor beauty, round the fancy play, And o'er the soul's dominions dark a dearth Of feeling reigns, a desert listlessness Enshrouds the mind; as hopeless Psyche lone, Companionless, was left with none to bless Her tired existence, no soft, soothing tone To call her dormant energies back to life, And renovate the passions, that illume This warring sphere with reckless terrors rife, And gild the tenant of a living tomb. The heartless galliard, and buffoon appear Like gilded butterflies, on velvet wing, In idle sport, and idiot mummery, e'er Chasing airy phantoms around the spring, That purls along in draining flowâor apes, Frisking around in frolic mimicry; Or like the wanton shades, and sybil shapes, Flitting, on pinions beautiful, on high, And luring fickle man to misery and death. The sage philosopher, in sable stole, Strikes the fell dart, and poisons with his breath The exquisite, cultured, but hopeless soul, And flings the robe of Nessus o'er the frame; His learned maxims lose their magic art, They kindle into fury terrible the flame, That sleeps in dormant embers round the heart. O'er the sad soul there comes a chilling blight, A winter ... and a withering of all that's fair, A heedless feeling, and a starless night; And pestilential is the circling air! Yet surging billows break not, whelm not all The fine sensations of majestic mindâ Stern apathy, of iron mien, the pall Of darkness throwsâin labyrinths we wind Our devious wayâin wild vagaries Of soulless mirth, and jest, we strive to throw A darkling veil o'er grief, and light the skies, Where horror broods, with beauty's vermeil glow. 'Tis all a wanton masqueradeâa play With woes, that none can mitigate, nor healâ Like the light deer, that sports the summer day Beneath the shade nemoral, ere the steel Rives her full heart, and lays her darling young In piles around her;âIn exclusion dread From all we hope or love, not fiercely stung To vengeful madness, by agony bred, Not doomed to writhe in torture audible, Cinctured by victorious fiends, and e'er Illuded by their subtle arts, and fell, But condemned groanless, and without a tear, To drag along a weary lifeâno fond, Mild, compassionate voice to hear, and spring To higher spheres, and brighter worlds, beyond This vapid tenementâno fanning wing To view, on which to soar away, and blend Existence with eternity, and join In high devotion ne'er to wane, nor end Its song extatic, symphony divine. LATRIA. Amid the joyless scenes of life, we gaze With kindling fondness on the realms above, And catch the faintest spark from those sheen rays, That seem to canopy descending love. O our fond vision kens the vapoury folds, That wave in radiance round the aerial bow, Our tireless eye espies the raptured souls, Whose dome is heaven, and who 'mid glory's glow Attune their golden wires in ceaseless praise; Upon the waking ear falls every strain, That wanders from heaven's pure seraphic lays, And oh! we seem to linger on the plain With lucid beauty, and perfection rife, Imbibe the glories of bright Zion hill, Burst from our bands to renovated life, And spring to brighter being. Gales distil A mellow balm o'er every baneful wound, And all the sad attendants of our course, Pale grief, desolate despair, disease, that bound Our pleasuresâthe furies murmuring hoarse, The shroud, the bier, the tomb, the chilling dread Of an unknown future, all forgotten lie In latent mystery;âour footsteps tread With gladness the ethereal plains on high, That spread around in holy loveliness, And beauty, lilies amaranthine bloom, And wave their pensile tendrils, like a tress Of a wandering Naiad in the gloom Of Daphne's groves of myrtle and of palm, Or floating, in her pygmy bark, o'er waves, That chime along, curled by the breeze of balm Into cincturing ripples. The bed of flowers paves The golden dome, and diamonds flash around In sheeny splendour kindled by the blaze, That emanates from the high Lord supreme, Who smiles in calm benignity at the sound Of the seraphic harps, that tune His praise, And own His glory their immortal theme. Time wears the robe of bright eternity! Ere disembodied, on the rapid wings Of sacred vision, o'er the arching sky We rove, and drink the light that Eden flings To wrap our souls elastic, and awake The rays of heaven within the darkling breast. Laid on the banks of the translucent lake, O'er which sweet nature flings her silver vest, A thrilling wildfire flashes in the eye, When in sublimity, and grandeur soar Majestic mountains, columns of the sky, O'er sunken glens, and lonely dells, and dales Expanding in luxuriance along the shore, Where eddying seagulls throng, and shrilly wails The startled kittywake; where the raven wing Of the indulgent pelican is heard, Like rushing winds, that sigh along, and fling The deep-blue foliage on the arching sky. O then we live in nature's charmsâthe word, That called her into life, and from on high Sent forth the winged hosts, embalmed, comes o'er The revelling sensesâand awakes the soul To all the beauties of the outward form Of pure religion's handmaid; and the shore, The forest, and the cityâthe wild storm, And cloudless sunshineâfair scenes, that unroll The happiness of olive Peaceâand all The deadly din of dread and wasting war, The flaunting robe of grandeur, and the pall Of deathâthe slow dark bier, and the fleet car, Derive their pomp, or terror, from the King Of worlds unnumbered, and every scene of earth Displays the impression of primeval birthâ Nature in gentle homage owns her Sire, And points her silver sceptre to the throne Of God, as upward burns the volcan's fire, Or as the magnet seeks the frigid zone. Oh! when the soul asserts her godlike powers, And Fancy, winging her celestial flight, Invokes the sainted shades of bliss from bowers Tapestried in heaven with flowers for ever bright, The mental eye dwells not upon the scene Of drear oblivion, and forgetfulness, But oh! intensely gazes on the sheen Of glory, opening on the world to bless The reckless visionâfondly pants the heart To join in beatific anthems sweetâ Where the high Paraclete doth love impart, And He, who erst did death in triumph meet, From the eternal throne serenely smiles, And wo is unknown, and its wanton wiles. MATERNAL LOVE. The deep affection of a mother's soul O who can paint? The vivid glow of love, Like the firm needle on the distant pole, Or the fair bow that spans the skies above, Abides the tempest, as the dappled dove Broods o'er her fledgelings when the howling gale Sweeps o'er the heavens, and rives the blooming grove; O love is firmer than the hauberk's mall, Though delicate its frame, mellifluent the tale. While the fair cherub, hung upon the breast, Smiles on the eye, that beams in blissful glow, Fond fancy culls each flower among the blest, Invokes the charms, that live in heaven below, A robe to deck, o'er which the heart will throw Its tender passion's perfume, and array The guileless infant; hope will incense strow Around its path where genial zephyrs play, And the high angels grave in heaven its natal day. When manhood rises agile and alert, And time has seized his young, unruffled years, When infant mild! thou art not what thou wert, And the rude world in dismal garb appears, Parental love another vestment wears, Yet decked with finer gems, and brighter hues; The eye's impearled with less of saline tears, But a deep feeling lingers in its views, And every noble deed its vision keen pursues. Within the mother's bosom dwells a store Of all, that beautifies terrestrial life, Imbibed not from the metaphysic lore Of warring sophists, nursed in ceaseless strife, But with the holy thought of heaven rife;â Untainted, undeluding, and sincere, The joyous mother, and the loving wife, Fair woman heeds not menace, knows not fear, When virtue is assailed, or pity craves a tear. She was the acmÃ¨ of unnumbered worlds! She was the festoon, that arrayed the fane Of natureâand when the Archangel's fury hurls The dome of earth to ruin, o'er the plain, That spreads on high, will float the raptured strain Of heavenly choirs on innocence and love! Eternal Wisdom in his ruth did deign To pair the eagle with the tender dove, And in celestial unison they live and move. If wanton fascinations lead astray The heedless youth, and plunge the darling child In revelry's dark abyssâif the ray Of light and hope is quenched by folly wild, If the full heart by no dim gleam's beguiled, And death broods o'er the mother's pride and care, A lingering flush her pallid cheek will gild, And flash along the gloom of black despair, E'en while she treads his grave, and heaven assails in prayer. O sacred love that never knows decay! O faithful guardians of our infant hours! Unknown to pomp, and glittering array, Are the beautiful, odoriferous flowers, That hang around the woodland's umbered bowers. Yet they enshield us from the solar glow; So woman, witness, ye Supernal Powers, Guards us in youth, ere opening mind can know The countless ills of life, that whelm us in their flow. Then while existence, in its fleet career, Displays the hand that reared the tender germ, While the fond soul doth all the vestments wear, Flung by affection round the pensile form, Ere the heart feels the fierce corroding worm, Let gratitude sincere libations shed, And gild of time each rapid rolling term; So noble nations, in sweet virtue bred, Will mercy mild revere, and deprecate all dread. ODE TO DEITY. Eternal Monad! Great Invisible! Essence incontaminate of Glory! High chainless Mind pervading heaven and hell, Spheres countless, systems sublime! The story Of thy Being, oh! how grand! far beyond Conception's airy flight, and soaring thought, Is thy imperial grandeur, yet fond Is mind ethereal to portray ought, That can in visions dim but image Life All unoriginatedâwith heaven rise. Mysterious Triad! Jehovah, Saviour, Comforter! throned in unity! O'er the wide heaven's aerial plains afar, Bright orbs concentric in a golden sky, Their laudatory smile enkindles bloom, While at the frown from the immortal throne Heaven quakesâand hell, the living tomb Of spirits apostate, is voiceless, lone, And o'er this sphere the forked lightning flies, And intonating thunders shake the skies. The genealogic chronicles of Time, Titanian pyramids, and all the pride Of mausoleums, storied with the rhyme Encomiastic of earth's lords, who died In victory's thousand armsâshall fadeâshall cease To shrine the godless Ammonâand the dust Of forms embalmed in myrrh no more in peace Oblivious shall slumberâtime will burst The mansion of eternal fameâin vain Their ashes canopy the rolling main! But Thou art linked with wide Eternity, Eternity itself thou art! no space Impedes thy sunlike visionâno dark sky Obnubilates thy brightness! Gentle grace And majesty upon thy visage blend, Like golden floods with sapphire skies at eve, And forth thy diamond sceptre, waved, doth send Winged spirits base-born man to cheer, or grieve, Heralding, where'er they move, Thy name, Or robed in mercy, or wide wasting flame. Before my swimming vision lay the plains Of the highest heavenâand the Presence there Irradiates my sightâafar the strains Of angels, breathed upon the fanning air, Concentrate in one enraptured symphony Around the viewless throneâthe ransomed saint, On earth a homeless, houseless wanderer by The revelling mansion, in notes not faint, And tremulous, joins high devotion's song, But sounds the anthem listening heavens along. Oh! spotless, stainless is the flowing robe, That wraps the disembodied spiritâfair Is the lustre of that unclouded globe, That doth in undecaying beauty wear The vestures, flung by holy Being round Its vaulted skies.âBut, thou Supreme! O what am I? A praiseless creature unto baubles bound, A poor ephemeraâbut born to die, A being fond of mingled joy and pain! Ah! no! a spirit called to live and reign. Ineffable are thy glories, unconfined By worlds celestial, that far stretch beyond The eye of fancyâpiercing is thy mind, Creation's luminaryâsuns respond The flash, that kindles into life each sphere! Yet Thou dost deign in mediatorial love, And mild benignity deathless to wear A brow of soft complacency above;â And the refraction of thy glory shines Through human breasts in bright interminable lines. As the fell tarantula at the sound Of lyric wires coils in innocent glee, And winds its way in playfulness around, So warring passions, when the Deity But smiles, subside in waveless, gentle Peace;â O Thou Omnipotent! with Thee to dwell, Is heavenâis full beatitudeâne'er cease Thine everlasting glories. No farewell, That wild, that rending word! the spirit yields To Him, who lives in blissâand ceaseless ages gilds. MNEMOSYNE. O memory! sad, unwilling dream of time! Impelled to muse on energies sublime, And heaven-born exploits, blasted by the breath Of malice, and consigned to infamy and death. Storehouse of time! thou palace of the soul! Whose treasures flow, and heed not mind's control. O painful-pleasing wand'rer, are the scenes, From which wild fancy peerless treasure gleans, Thou dost array before the mental eye, And deck in terror, or in ecstasy; Here towers the warrior with his plumed crest, And in his country's noble feats is blestâ The high-souled patriot, who contemns the gold, By which his empire is betrayed and soldâ The saint, the sage, the sophistâall who stand Enrolled in honour,âwield the flashing brand, Or wrap around the philosophic stole, Rush in review before the dazzled sight, And, like a mantle flung from heaven's own height O'er golden fields, and sunny meads, they shed A charm around the vista of the dead. But virtue, honour, and a stainless worth, Like the bright fruitage in its vernal birth, Display their envied glories, and awake The whelming blastâand vengeful torrents break The heaven-raised battlement; on the ruined scene We gaze, unconscious of the pomp that's been. In ev'ry age, of devasting time, And ev'ry glorious, or ignoble clime, Virtue has wandered to her meed unknown, And base born finesse has usurped the throne; Devotion to the nation's noblest weal Been crowned with iron on the writhing wheel, The sage's lore demanded being's bane, And ruin's panders have enjoyed the strain Of triumph from the mercenary bard; Thus justice, wisdom, meet the world's reward. ANTHEM. O Thou, whose hand with vengeance grasped the thunders of the skies, Who left thy jasper throne of light and deigned for man to bleed; Thou will not human griefs contemn, nor aching hearts despise, Thou wilt not quench the smoking flax, nor break the bruised reed. Unhonoured, and unpitied thou didst groan in dark Gethsemane, And up the hill of Calvary didst bear thy cross to bleed, Thou bow'st thy head, and nature quaked in homage unto thee, Thou will not quench the smoking flax, nor break the bruised reed. Mercy, with radiant beaming eye, waves high her olive wand, The man of sorrows and of grief confers the holy meed On broken hearts that fear to riseâand smiles in beauty bland, He will not quench the smoking flax, nor break the bruised reed. The flaming mount, that blazed sublime when great Jehovah came, The awful pomp and grandeur that attended on the deed, Are all absorbed and beautiful in great Emmanuel's name, He will not quench the smoking flax, nor break the bruised reed. His holy brow was pierced with thorns, his cheek was wet with blood, He bled, and agonized, and died, but oh! he died to lead The weary laden to the feast adorned with heavenly food, He will not quench the smoking flax, nor break the bruised reed. THE DAWN. Fond memory lingers o'er the days of youth, Whose rays effulgent glitter in the eye, Whose hours, like odours on the fragrant south, Roll on beneath an ever-glowing sky; No scene around a pleasure can deny, To hearts which e'er with living ardour glow, A sweet response, whose echoes never die, To His, who claims to be adored below By Love, the bond of life, which smooths the warring brow. Time hides his flight from youth's enraptured view, And seldom soars upon his raven wing, But beams delightful burst in every hue That charms the sight with one eternal spring; The heart, too ardent, feels no secret sting Rising beneath the roseous bed around, Suspects no gale will grief, or sorrow bring, No chords of love emit a jarring sound, But that the fairy scene will never know a bound. Ah! has thine eye ne'er paused upon the dawn, Fretting the east with grand vermilion dies? Seen mild Aurora, by her coursers drawn, Recede before the sun's refulgent rise? Short was the sheeny phantom to thine eyes, Dazzling a momentâlost in vapours dun! So fares life's mornâthe beauty man descries; It disappears, before the eye has won Scarce one extatic view of what it dwells upon. Then raise thy view to heav'nly worlds on high, Attune to strains sublime the warbling wire, Seek views whose radiance cannot wane or die, And cherish hope that never can expire; So youth shall blossom o'er the tott'ring sire, Immortal beauties wake the living strain, Whose dulcet notes shall fan the latent fire And spread abroad o'er Zion's golden plain, The holy joys that spring from Love's eternal reign PALESTINE. Erst o'er thy plains, the sun his golden car, And spangled skies his pathway, highly rode The Warrior-Chief of thy embattled hosts, Heaven-girt Judea! thy Monarch high, And deity beneficent; On his brow The sovereign diadem of glory gleamed, The sceptre, olive-wreathed, of boundless state Was waved o'er thy fair realm, and heavenly smiles Of love arrayed thy blooming meads and fields And while the soul its winning homage paid To Being in sublimity, and worth Wafted its gilded treasures to the throne Of immortality, while the censer Flung its wreathing incense piacular On high, and all in the theocracy Were blest, the bright, pictorial bow Of gentle ruth the arching heavens spanned But glory left thy skies Yet bright again Thy phenix spirit glowsâagain the choir Angelic, ardent, wield their thousand wings O'er Sinai, and the Mount of Passion dire. No magi watch the phasis from the height Of towering Lebanon, to mark the hour Of festival, or jubilee; victims Bleed not on the holy altarâthe robes Of grandeur clerical wave not o'er The thronging mass in adoration bowed. But the pure messengers of heavenly Peace Tread o'er thy seraph-haunted scenes, and strike The tuneless lyre of slumbering ages To strains harmonic and celestial notes; O envied bliss! upon thy dales to gaze, Proud Salem! once bright Glory's chosen dome! In earth's vast amphitheatre the eye In all its rapid flight o'er fields of blood, Where valour's demigods of fame repose And e'en the air seems nectared with the breath Of honour, as it plays with lambent fan Around their barrows; or o'er the kingdom, Pillared by heroes, whose foundation rests Upon the adamantine ocean-rock, Whose every glen teems with a hardy race Of free-born warriors, and who tune their lays To battle's fury or the arts of peace; The kindling eye dwells not with moveless gaze Upon these scenesâon earth no hill like Zion Transports the soulâno vale expands in pride, Like wide Jehoshaphatâno sweet garden Charms the vision, like the one, that echoed The melting groans of writhing agony. O'er Neptune's wide domains, whose trident waves In wild dominion,âHeroes of the Cross! Lies your untrod pathwayâand woman sweet Shines in her sphereâthe world of doing good; To her a full luxury is proffered, And forth, arrayed in heaven's unyielding shield, And all the panoply of faith, she speeds, Like an enchantress o'er the desert wild. O! when the apocalyptic vision, Unfolded by the rapid wing of Time, Shall open on the view the plans complex Of Deity, tutelar of gloryâ The fanning airs, that breathed celestial love, The fane that rose in glorious majesty, The lonely fountain, and the mountain cave, Shall hear the mingled songs of Judah high, And Christian bands, arise in symphony; While o'er the joyous scene the mellow harp Of female worth shall close the full diapason. SONNET. Where, Hope, are all thy golden visions fled? Sybil enchantress! vain are all thy dreams! Formless the shade that on the fancy beams, When faith is flown, and energy is dead; Thine airy arches, that enshield the head, With fascinating figures wrought, delude, And the sweet gales of Araby, that shed Love through the soul, cheer not the wayward mood; Oh! lynx-eyed rapture, on her eagle wing, In feeling exquisite soars away, Basks in the sunbeams of celestial day, Then sinksâand fierce the fires of fury wring. Joys charm not this cold, sublunary sphere, Life opens with a smile, and closes with a tear. [O, that in listening to my youthful strain] O, that in listening to my youthful strain, Stern Grief would hush his agonizing throe, That, merged in slumbers, lay the heart of pain And torrents wild would cease their lava flow. Why thrills the lyre to pleasure's notes alone, Or carols e'er the sapphic lay of love? Is there no minstrel to embalm the tone Of dark despair, and inspiration prove? When the effulgent seraphim on high To praise eternal tune their magic lays, The exiled fiends forbear a bitter sigh, And the eye flashes through the circling haze. The Muse can fire the soldier's fearless breast, And nerve his arm amid the flame of death, But can she not to everlasting rest Hush the sad wail with her soft, soothing breath? Oh! not alone doth Music charm the hall Of mirth, when boiling blood distracts the brain, Companion sweet! o'er misery's funeral pall Her dovelike voice is heard, her melting strain. Lo! yon wild maniac, when the mountain breeze Fans the fair meadow, listens deeply there, And, if it harps amid the bowering trees, The rustling soothes her desolate despair. The wretch, whom demons dire incarcerate, Forgets his woes when sounds the mellow lyre, Rears his fair brow, defiance bids to fate, His high soul dancing on the silver wire. The exile, panting for his native clime, Is wrought to rapture with the floating song, That falls upon the ear in heavenly chime, Like streams that murmur childhood's dales along. In grandeur visionary, created rise Romantic scenes beneath the plastic hand, Torrents below, above irradiate skies, Around the beautifu and sublime expand. The eye dwells fondly on some happy scene And, wrapt in reverie, âforgets all time;â So can the poet's vivid fancy wean Man from his grief, and raise his soul sublime. Then let imagination cull each flower To deck the aching heart incarnadine, And throw a waking light upon the hour O'er which no mental gleam of love doth shine. Let sorrow rove in virtue's garb of peace, And pleasure sport around her leaden eye, Then the deep sigh, and rending groan will cease, And pure religion point the soul on high. Why thrills the lyre to pleasure's notes alone, Or carols e'er the sapphic lay of love? Is there no minstrel to embalm the tone Of dark despair, and inspiration prove? A FRAGMENT. A thousand melting scenes of dread distress Not to thy fancy, but thine eye appear, Ideal grief may on thy mind impress A sentiment sublime, And swell the sympathetic heart With feeling, that rude time Can never seize, nor yet impartâ A smile may mingle with a rolling tear. But gentle Nature paints with magic truth, Attires the language of the sensient soul, Decks hoary age, smiles on exuberant youth, And o'er each fair and holy scene holds mild control. Pursue her path, obey her wand, And Passion, Hate, and frenzied Rage, And Murder, with the gory hand, No more will battle wage; But shrink away, when o'er the thrilling lyre Thy fingers fly, and ruth, and nature thee inspire. STANZAS. O Memory! nymph for ever fond! Arraying all the bitter past Before the eyeâwhile all beyond Fancy depicts a lonely waste. Delighting, and deluding e'er, Enchanting now, and all anon Blasting our joys with a sullen sneer, And smiling when bright hope is gone. Gilding with love the raptured vision Retracing every youthful scene, And tearing with a fierce derision Every form that smiles serene;â Away with all your false Mnemonics, Lave the soul in Lethe's stream, The boiling blood demands not tonics, O plunge the brain in a wanton dream. The eye of love, caress of beauty, The bliss of friendship, pleasure's tone, The holy deeds of cheering duty, All have diedâand I am lone; Every hope of earth is fickle, Glowingâveiled in stygian blackness, Tears of writhing anguish trickle,â Every genial ray is trackless. O if our being were a blank, A void of all that cheers or saddens, If nor Love nor Hate grew wild and rank, Nor this depresses, nor that gladdens; If life unconscious wore away, And brutal instinct all suppliedâ What were the creature of a day? A feather on the warring tide. Ah! we must linger on the brink Of dark despair's wild precipice, And we must gazeâand we must think Upon the scenes that ne'er entice, Upon the agony below! And shudder ne'er, but rive the foot With the hard rock, and heed not wo, Nor list the sound of the silver lute. The passion strong, the thought intense, Feeling acute, conception dear, Launching in high magnificence, Will strand on deep reefs dread and drear, And all, that youth or age has given, Amid the false world's shivering shock, Is lost and deadâand nought but heaven Can mind recover from the stroke. [When, like austral breezes light soft breathing o'er the fields of roses] O Lachymarum sons, tenero sacros Ducentium ortus ex animo; Felix; in imo qui scatentem Pectore te, pia Nympha, sensit. Gray's Poemata. When, like austral breezes light soft breathing o'er the fields of roses, The tender thoughts of winged years in freshness throng the mind, When wo has hushed her melting wail, and sorrow's portal closes, The bounding soul in love drinks joys that time has left behind. When smiles angelic light the eye, and dance upon the lip, Like lunar beams of flushing June upon the glassy deep, And joy ecstatic flies around, from beauty's breath to sip His nectar sweet, and sorrow doth in darkling caverns sleep; When woman's swanlike bosom heaves with warm love nestling there, Like blushing sylphs that rise and sink upon the fanning air, And pleasure wears a viny crown, and, ever on the wing, Exquisite Rapture flits around, nor feels a bitter sting; The smiling hours roll fleetly on, and o'er the swelling breast Pour honied streams of bliss, on which the heaven-born fairies float, Who deck their airy forms and leave the âIslands of the Blest,â And stem the whelming flood of time to tune youth's cheering note. The scene, that meets our moveless gaze, is not loud wassail's dome, Where dormant souls awake alone to vent a mirthless jeer, Or fire-clad phrenzy leaves the brain, when o'er the senses come A chilling coldness and a blight of all that lust deemed dear. Pure as the dew by heaven poured in libations o'er the lawn, Wild as the vernal sky, that spreads its arches when the shower is o'er, Is every thought that retrospective wakes the laughing dawn Of life, bright is the tear, like waves when sunbeams gild the shore. Like the wild courser when he snuffs the battle field afar, Like warring billows when they rush o'er ocean's rocky breast, The vivid fancy bounds away when gleams the twinkling star Of memory o'er the happy scenes where youth was passed and blest. [My bosom has become a sepulchre] I. My bosom has become a sepulchre Of departed hopes and joys,âa dungeon Rather, were the clanking manacles grate On the rough bars serrated by the toil Of inborn agonyâwhere the damp base Of clay is worn into caverns hollow By sleepless torture, and is deeply tinged With crimsonâmantling from the bursting heart By uncontrollable fatality Existence is dominatedâpatience Then must raise a battlement, like the rock, That mountain billows move not, and against Despair rear an iron front. The ordeal Of fire and flood ah! who can safely pass? Who wears a breast of adamantâan heart Of brass? A frame insensible to pain? None!âWhy then invite the fawn to battle With the whelpless Lionessâthe fair dove To pair with the foul insatiate falcon? Stoic Philosophy is the parent Of the veriest idiotismâand wears Her sable robe in mockery when grief Demands a balm;âa shroud, a pall, a tomb Is all she deigns to being desolate. II. The dungeon! feelings unutterable, Unintelligible thrill the wrung soul To phrenetic, and unknown delirium. Through the high lattice intermural gleam The flashing sunbeams in refractions dim, And awful; for the twilight gloom inspires Thoughts, that invest the outward forms of things With unseen terror, dreaded, yet unknown; Darkness tangible loads not the soul With terrible sensationsâno demon glides Through the rayless gloom, for his sparkling breath Would supersede his purpose; but the hour, That intervenes between the varied reign Of sun and moon, the time of dizziness, The season of chaotic anarchy, Is fraught with bodied horrorsâgorgons, then, And fiends walk unforbidden o'er the earth. Around the tortured brain, corroding, play The lambent fires of brighter days, when youth, In sportive trills, and wild exuberance, Free as the mountain breeze, or like the roe Bounding away in woeless mirth and glee, Or the winged deer arching her smooth neck, And culling every fragrant shrub, that grows Upon the sunny hill-side, or the gazelle, Darting from raven lids a piercing eye Pregnant with rainbow hues; was fraught with heaven, And seemed a spirit, wandering from the bowers Of higher spheres, and happier realms than this. Like wreathing flames around a voiceless wreck, Manless, sailorless, the thoughts of sweet years Long pastâlong lostâcome o'er my aching mind, And wrap me in oblivion momentary! Sweet hour! O thatâalas! this clanking chain Hath broke the fascinating spell, and crushed The embryo wish, that dawned upon my soul, And rose the harbinger of lovely hope. III. The mental powers, and passions all confined Unquelledâunbrokenâwild and warring still! The stretched hand now graspingânoughtânow clenched round The icy chain! the straining eyeball's glare O'er vacancy! the fierce whelming tempest Raging within! the hissing shades, that pass, And hurl their puny thunderbolts around, Or curl the sneers of degradation and contempt: All paint but feebly the fell miseries, And severing pangs, that rack the pensile frame Immured in wrath within a living tomb. The bosom's sepulchre! unseen by man, In long and undisturbed hours of deep And dreadful loneliness, the soul had slept, Unheeding mortal mandate, when a sun Arose upon my vision, and a world Of dazzling brightness, and around me flew Strange forms, and laughing eyes did shine through hair Loose wavingâI wondered at the transition! The glad reversions of my former fate! I mused upon the inexplicable Sceneâand thought, as oft we think when deep sleep, Midway between Death and Eternity, Steals o'er the wearied senses and recalls The visions she has bred before, a dream, Engendered by some hovering angel, Had swelled my vivid fancy with a sweet, Illuding phantom scene, to cheer, dispel, The clouds, that hang in blackening folds around The fathomless, quenchless oblivial gulf. But a hand touched me, and a voice was heard. I wakened from my reverie, and rose Upon my fanning pinions o'er the clouds, That rolled beneath, and opened on my view A blissful sceneâand I was bodiless. IV. My soul drank the rays of light as nectar, And they became a nutriment, that fired Its powers primeval with a rapture Exquisite, etherealâand attuned My harp, that breathed 'mid the gales of perfume Celestial harmonies sweet, responsive To the songs of choirs seraphic. Above, Below, around, was one constellation Of interminable light and glory, The skies were sapphire and the pavement gold, And the eternal throne of Majesty, Exalted on the foundations moveless Of countless worlds, was sardonyx mingled With the diamond, and around in bloom, Waved the olive and the broad palm intwined, Like happiness and devotion. The balm Sanative poured o'er the festered wounds, And wrenched chords, and broken throbbing heart, And feeling soul, slumbering in the deep gloom Of a sepulchre animate, revives Me once again; but divested by hands Gentle, without the pang of intervening Death, Of frail Mortality's crushing burden O how extatic is the airy flight Of the unshackled spirit o'er the plains For ever budding, and for e'er in bloom. THE REBELLION. The tartarean scheme of vengeance fell Was well matured for ruthless execution; The massive chain of treason bound the hearts Of soul-exulting myriads, who were galled By a sad interminable bondage, And tortured into madness unheeding Innocence, or worth, or virtue's weal, By the gory lash of despotism mean; Yet not a link was broken; rolling years, In wide accumulating flow, had brought An iron mass of fearless desperadoes, A dauntless phalanx of auxiliaries, With frames of steel, and souls of vivid flame, And hearts impenetrable to the shriek Of defloration, or the dying groan Of honour fair; still no unguarded hour, In inadvertent jest, developed guile, Brooding beneath a placid browâa smile Of toil obsequious, a massacre Unfeeling, undistinguishing, unseen. A lonely shed, amid the marsh afar, Impervious to the approaching tread Of eagle-eyed Detection, had become The dome of eloquence incendiary, And Vesey there inflamed the palled soul Of slavery debasing with his flood Of lava passionâthe fires of freedom Intensely glowed within the waking breast Of thousand auditors, who grouped around, And though no shrill huzza sublimely rung, In lengthening echoes, through the deep pine wood, Each thrilling fibre, in responsive tone, Impelled the arm to action terrible. Anon the hut arose a capitol! And legislation, by the vulgar mass Of sable sages cultured, smiled around Upon the scene fantastic; fancy saw The plains prolific own their brutal slaves Lords legitimate by blood and rapine, And wisdom sanctioned all the happy tale. Yet sure they reasoned on the point not ill; Track trophied Victory around the globe, Mark the wide progress of revolution, And of freedom; allâall are bought with blood Fierce spirits ever dominate the mob. From the congregated throng arose A deep magician, versed in subtle spell, And incantation, and enchantment wild. His sea-shell rosary was the amulet, That held dominion over Destiny, A glossy cane was waved his magic wand, And his broad cincturing girdle, graven With figures rude, uncouth, illegible, Was viewed by Superstition's glazed eye As pregnant more with power invulnerable Than the wrought mail, and panoply of war. The doom of fated Carolina in that cell Of midnight counsel dread was fixed, fore'er IrrevocableâDeath indiscriminate To manâthe soulless tyrantâto womanâ The dark domains of fiends diabolic Ne'er teemed with thought so foul, contaminate, Debasing! her breast was open to the steel, But not toâ. Indulging horrid systems Of vengeance unrelenting, and intense, They seek their distant cots in joyful mirth, And frame their idol Liberty. Mean-while Smiling on lords they soon will tombless lay. The night was dark, and scarce a wandering star Was flashing along the bright spheres of June, No meteor-blaze, an omen dread, arrayed The concave in a momentary glare, The loud volcano voice of terror, And alarm, was heard notâa spirit mild Noiseless had descended, on the wings Of gentle ruth, and warned the slumbering clime Of wrath impending; through the moonless gloom The thundering dragoons fly, and the sound Of steely sabre sheath, and iron hoof Along the street, and the shrill parting voice Of love connubial, or paternal, And the hollow-pealing drum, that awakes The soldier from reposeâartillery Anon in distant thunders shaking earth, And intonating knells the alarum Sounding in dirge-like tones, all blend, And rush upon the open, aching ear. Trembling affright, and quivering terror pale Swayed thousand victims, and impressed the soul With agonyâand the brain with phantoms dire, And shades menacing death,âthey wielded round, The sabre ruthless, and incarnadine, Or pierced with cruel spike the bosom deep. It was, alas! a scene of woâan hour Of suspense terrificâfor the high mind Impels the sense, recoiling from the voice That divests the tale of ignorance sweet Of all its fairy decorations thrown By causeless hope around it, to knowledge Of all, that dread, or joy conspires to shroud In mystery; and oft the mind serene Will bear the full developement of death Inevitable, while the hour of wild Suspense uncertain sheds a chilling blight, And fearful phrenzy through the throbbing breast Ye fair! what thoughts within your bosoms burned? What writhing horrors on your senses prest? The ideal view of massacre and death, Pillage, and all the scenes attendant on The victory unrepressed, is fraught with dread To potent minds and masculine; but when A tempest and a whelming hurricane, Winged by fell human passion, fling around A pestilence worse than quick destruction, And the soft, delicate form is fated To endure corroding pangsâa living deathâ Imagination cannot paint the scene. Vindictive Justice bared her gory arm,â Then fell her wrath upon the myrmidons; And all their gilded scenes of freedom, And bright emancipation, and the reign Of their immortal Vesey, witheredâdied. Immured within a darkling cell, the thoughts Of hempen exaltation, and a sway Sublime and airy, o'er their senses came, And brought a scene befitting base-born minds. The toiling Law in even balance weighed Their virtues and their crimesâand drew a line Between bland innocence, and iron guilt; O'er some there came a chill when the award Of Death rung solemn on the startled earâ Unfeeling apathy, or reckless mirth All other swayed;âtheir dreadful doomsday came. And 'mid thronged myriads, who were fiercely doomed To death promiscuous, they yielded life On earth forâwhat their Judge omnipotent Did award themâe'en the magician died! THE SABBATH. ?????? ? ???, ??? ????, ??? ???????? ????? ????????, ?????? ???? ????, ???? ???????? ?????? ???? ????????. Ãschylus. O sweet, and calm, and solemn day of rest! The deafening din, and reckless hum of man, And all the tumult of mercantile life, And cheering mirth of worldly pleasure, cease. Thy legates, Lord! develope, in the dome To holy adoration consecrate, The mediatorial mission of the skies, And point the sentient powers unto the throne Of Immortality, and the mansions By the hand of Calvary's sacred King Prepared on high for praising saints below. The sapphire sky, o'er which a topaz veil Is flung by gentle morn, and fleecy clouds Float in transparent silvery whiteness, Smiles on the lifted eye of devotion Viewing, through the azure fields, angels bright Gazing, as they tune their strung golden lyres To heavenly adoration, on the saint Kneeling before the shrine all unadorned, And wafting on the wings of spirits pure The incense of faith, and love, and gratitude. Unlike the day, when Sinai heard the tread Of the Almighty Being, at whose word Emulgent chaos felt the massive wheels Of revolution roll, and order, time, Existence, nature, sprung from the abyss Of anarchyâand lovely hope, not bred In famed Pandora's fabled box of yore, Arrayed the scene, and love flew laughing round. O how unlike the dayâloud thunders dread Sublimely heralded the grand descent Of heaven's high King, and lightenings paved his track, And the earthquake was the voice with which he spake. Appalling terror shook the bosom then, And thronging millions, prostrate, then beheld The awful God, they dared not look upon.</field>
