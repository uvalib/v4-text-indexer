      <field name="fulltext">ORPHEUS. TO MY SISTER JOSEPHINE. 1869. ORPHEUS. Laughter and dance, and sounds of harp and lyre, Piping of flutes, singing of festal songs, Ribbons of flame from flaunting torches, dulled By the broad summer sunshine, these had filled Since the high noon the pillared vestibules, The peristyles and porches, in the house Of the bride's father. Maidens, garlanded With rose and myrtle dedicate to Love, Adorned with chaplets fresh the bride, and veiled The shining head and wistful, girlish face, Ineffable sweetness of divided lips, Large light of clear, gray eyes, low, lucid brows, White as a cloud, beneath pale, clustering gold. When sunless skies uncertain twilight cast, That makes a friend's face as an alien's strange, Investing with a foreign mystery The dear green fields about our very home. Then waiting stood the gilded chariot Before the porch, and from the vine-wreathed door, Issued the white-veiled bride, while jocund youths And mÃ¦nads followed her with dance and song. She came with double glory; for her lord, Son of Apollo and Calliope, Towered beside her, beautiful in limb And feature, as though formed to magic strains, Like the BÅotian city, that arose In airy structures to Amphion's lute. The light serene shone from his brow and eyes, Of one whose lofty thoughts keep consonance With the celestial music of the spheres. His smile was fluent, and his speech outsang The cadences of soft-stringed instruments. He to the chariot led Eurydice, And these twain, mounting with their paranymph, Drove onward through the dusky twilit fields, Preceded by the nymphs and singing youths, And boys diffusing light and odors warm, With flaming brands of aromatic woods, And matrons bearing symbols of the life Of careful wives, the distaff and the sieve; And followed by the echoes of their songs, The fragrance crushed from moist and trodden grass, The blessing of the ever-present gods, Whom they invoked with earnest hymns and prayer. From Orpheus' portico, festooned with vines, Issued a flood of rare, ambrosial light, As though Olympian portals stood ajar, And Hymen, radiant by his torch's flame, Mystic with saffron vest and purple, stood With hands munificent to greet and bless. Ripe fruits were poured upon the married pair Alighting, and the chariot wheels were burnt, A token that the bride returned no more Unto her father's house. With step resolved, She crossed the threshold soft with flowers, secure That his heroic soul who guided her, Was potent and alert to grace her life, With noble outlines and ideal hues, Uplifting it to equal height with his. EPITHALAMIUM. TO ZEUS. Because thou art enthroned beyond our reach, Behind the brightest and the farthest star, And silence is as eloquent as speech, To thee who knowest us for what we are, We bring thee naught save brief and simple prayer, Strong in its naked, frank sincerity. Send sacred joys of marriage to this pair, With fertile increase and prosperity. Three nymphs had met beneath an oak that cast Cool, dappled shadow on the glowing grass, And liquid gleam of the translucent brook. The air was musical with frolic sounds Of feminine voices, and of laughter blithe. Patines of sunshine fell like mottled gold On the rose-white of bright bare limbs and neck, On flowing, snowy mantles, and again With sudden splendor on the gloriole Of warm, rich hair. The fairest nymph reclined Beneath the tree, and leaned her yellow head, With its crisp, clustering rings, against the trunk, And dipped her pure feet in the colorless brook, Stirring the ripples into circles wide, With cool, delicious plashings in the stream. Her young companions lay upon the grass, With indolent eyes half closed, and parted lips Half-smiling, in the languor of the noon. But suddenly these twain, arising, cried, Startled and sharply, âLo, Eurydice, Behold!â and she, uplifting frightened eyes, Saw a strange shepherd watching with bold glance. Veiling their faces with their mantles light, Her sisters fled swift-footed, with shrill cries, Adown the meadow, but her wet feet clung To the dry grasses and the earthy soil. âEurydice, I love thee! fear me not, For I am AristÃ¦us, with gray groves Of hoary olives, and innumerous flocks, And precious swarms of yellow-vested bees.â But she with sudden strength eluding him, Sprang o'er the flowery turf, with back-blown hair, And wing-like garments, shortened breath, and face Kindled with shame and terror. In her flight She ran through fatal flowers and tangled weeds, And thick rank grass beside a stagnant pool, When, with a keen and breathless cry of pain, Abrupt she fell amidst the tall, green reeds. Then AristÃ¦us reached her, as a snake Crept back in sinuous lines amidst the slime. Desire was changed to pity, when he saw The wounded dryad in her agony Strive vainly to escape, repelling him With feeble arms. âForgive me, nymph,â he cried; âI will not touch, save with most reverent hands, Thy sacred form. But let me bear thee hence, And soothe thy bruise with healing herbs. âToo late, Leave me,â she sighed, âand lead thou Orpheus here, That I may see him ere the daylight fails.â He left her pale with suffering,âearth seemed strange Unto her eyes, who knew she looked her last On level-stretching meadows, hazy hills, And all the light and color of the sky. Brief as a dream she saw her happy life, Her father's face, her mother's blessed eyes, The hero who, unheralded, appeared, And all was changed,âall things put forth a voice, As in the season of the singing birds. She looked around revived, and saw again The lapsing river and abiding sky. Across the sunny fields came AristÃ¦us, With Orpheus following,âand after these, Sad nymphs and heroes grave with sympathy. Quite calm she lay, and almost wished to die Before they reached her, if the throbbing pain Of limb and heart could only thus be stilled. But Orpheus hastened to her side, and mourned, âEurydice, Eurydice! Remain,â For there is no delight of speech nor song Among the dead. Will the gods jest with me, And call this life, which must forevermore Be but a void, a hunger, a desire, A stretching out of empty hands to grasp What earth nor sea nor heaven will restore? Is this the life that I conceived and sang, Rich with all noble opportunities And beautiful realities?â But she: âBrave Orpheus, search thou not the eternal gods, Surely they love us dearer than we know. Do thou refrain, for yet I hold my faith. When I am gone, thou still wilt have thy lyre; Love it and cherish,âit is Fate's best gift, And with death's clearer vision, I can see That in all ages men will be upraised Nearer to gods through this than through aught else. My death may but inspire a larger note, A passionate cadence to thy strain, which else Were not quite human, and thus incomplete. And with this thought I am content to die. Cease not to sing to me when I am gone; Thy voice will reach me in the farthest spheres, Or wake me out of silence. Now begin, That I may float on those celestial waves Into the darkness, as I oft have longed.â ORPHEUS. Once in a wild, bright vision, came to me Beautiful music, luminous as morn, An effluence of light and rapture born, With eyes as full of splendor as the sea; Dazzling as youth, with pinions frail as air, Yet potent to uplift and soar as prayer. Again I see her, cypress in her wreath, Sad with all grave and tender mysteries; Tears in her unimaginable eyes, That look their first with wondering awe on Death. Never again, in all the after years, Will her lips laugh with utter mirthfulness; Nor the strange longing in her eyes grow less, Nor any time dispel their mist of tears. Yea, with new numbers she completes her strain, A song unsung before by gods or men; But she hath lost, ah! lost for evermore, The ringing note of joy ineffable, The high assurance proud, that all is well, The glad refrain that pealed from shore to shore. O lyre, thou hast done with joyous things, Triumphant ecstasies, exultant song; Of subtle pain, keen anguish, hopeless wrong, I fashion now another of thy strings, And strike thee with a strong hand passionate, Into a fuller music, adequate Unto a soul that seeks insatiably, With fond, illusive hope and faith divine; For through all ages will my soul seek thine, Eurydice, my lost Eurydice! What solace to lament with empty hands And smitten heart, above a mound of earth, Vivid with mockery of perpetual flowers, O'er one small urn that holds beneath its lid, With overmeasure, all the flameless dust And soulless ashes of our love? Yet this Was Orpheus' life, to mourn beside the grave, From his stringed lyre compelling wild response, And thrilling intonation of his grief, That made the hearts of gnarled and knotty oaks Ache as with human sympathy, and rived The adamantine centre of the rock, And lured the forest beasts, and hushed the birds, Mavis and lark, while with wide, awful wings, The eagle shadowed his exalted brow. âSurely,â he cried, âthe senseless dust hears not, More than the burnt brand hears old natural sounds Innumerable rustle of young leaves. It cannot be that only these remain, The ashes of her glittering limbs, warm flesh, And blessed hair,âmy love had more than these Where is the vital soul, that was to me An inspiration and an influence? The gods are not unstable like rash man, Aimlessly to create and discreate, With cruel and capricious fantasy, For thus the immaculate skies would be a lie; Eurydice is but withdrawn from me, And disembodied, while mine eyesight blinds, My senses are a hindrance, and obstruct The accurate perception of my soul. When mine own spirit, nightly disenthralled, Soars to the land of dreams, whose boundaries, By day, loom infinitely far and vague, And yet, at night, become our very home,â There still I see thee with the same bright form, The same auroral eyes that made for me Perpetual morning; and I stretch mine arms Hungering after thee, and, calling, wake Unto the vapid glare of languid dawn. Yet all these things address my very soul, Telling it that thou art not dead; for death Is but the incarnation of man's fears; Gods do not recognize it. If thou art (As I have faith) in the known universe, Yea, though it be in the extremest land, Beyond the sunset, with its shining isles, I will go forth and seek thee, nor will cease To mourn thee and desire, till I have found.â Thus Orpheus fared across the full-fed streams Of Hebrus and of Strymon, and beyond The purple outlines and aerial crags, Snow-glittering of Scardus, Rhodope, And grand Orbelus; through fair, fertile fields Of Thessaly with increase of ripe corn, Through Attica, BÅotia and EubÅa, And southward to the royal-citied state, Beautiful Corinth, throned upon the base Of green Acrocorinthus, whose soft slope Was dedicate with temples to the gods, And towering over all the sacred shrine Of Aphrodite. Upward from the town The mountain rose defensive, where the walls Of Corinth ended, and beyond the gates, The radiant plain of the Corinthian Gulf Stretched infinitely. Orpheus rested here, Till he bethought him to ascend the mount, With offerings at Aphrodite's shrineâ Not sanguine victims, but fresh myrtle wreath And faultless roseâto sue the oracle For help and guidance. All the town was still, The bright red band of sunrise lit the sky Above the dark blue gulf, and Orpheus heard A hundred birds saluting, from the brake, Aurora, and cool rush of waterfalls Made murmurous music, while AthenÃ© breathed The vigor of the morning in his soul. Up the steep mountain side he passed, beyond The silver growth of olives, and the belt Of pines, to where the foam-white temple stood, Smitten at once by all the beams of morn. He saw the double peak, rose-white with snow And early sunshine, of Parnassus cleave The northern sky, and sacred Helicon Erect its head, crowned with the Muses' grove. The Bay of Crissa and Corinthian Gulf, Below flashed restless, and a path of gold Divided with clear, tremulous light the waves. From the large beauty of the morn, he went Into the holy limits of the shrine, With warm air heavy with the odorous rose. ORPHEUS. I put into my prayer to thee, O mother, The tumult and the passion of the ocean, The unflecked purity of winnowed foam-wreaths; To thee who sprang from these, the incarnation Of all the huge sea holds of grace or splendor, With its own light between thine amorous eyelids. For I, in thy most sacred cause a pilgrim, Have wandered tireless, from Thrace to Corinth, 'Midst foreign scenes and alien men and women. And at my right hand Grief incessant follows, And at my left walks Memory with the semblance Of lost Eurydice's ethereal beauty. Infatuate I gaze, until the vision Thrills me to madness, and I start and tremble, Remembering also Grief is my companion. Onward through spacious fields, by copious waters, Through purple growth of amaranth and crocus, And past the marble beauty of great cities, We three have journeyed,âstrangers saw me reckless, And knew at once that I had walked with sorrow, And that the gods had chosen me their victim. Are all my carols useless, worse than useless? Shall my long pilgrimage, thus unrewarded, End at the blank, insuperable ocean? Hast thou no wise compassion, goddess, mother? In all the measureless years' unfathomed chances, Is the dear past to be repeated never? O supreme mother! crowned with blessed poppy As well as myrtle,âbring her here, or compass My soul with death, that elsewhere I may seek her. He ceased, and through the temple spread a mist Ambrosial, and above the shrine a star Serenely brightened, and a heavenly voice Made sweet response: âLove guides himself thy course To the last sea-girt rock. No worthy soul May ever truly seek, and fail to find.â Still southward Orpheus journeyed, till he reached Cape TÃ¦narus, the last bleak point of Greece, Desolate o'er an infinite waste of waves, While sunset lit the western sea and sky With yellow floods of warm, diffusive light, Kindling his serious face and earnest eyes, And glittering on his lyre. Long time he stood, And gazed upon the trouble of the waves, Expectant of a word, a signâand still No answer made the wild, indifferent sea. Impetuous, he smote his quivering lyre To reckless and sonorous melody, Vibrating o'er the watery turbulence. Then far below its western bath, the sun Dipped and was gone, and all the sea was gray. Still through the air rang those imploring notes, Unutterably plaintiveâtill there came From out the ocean cave of TÃ¦narus The shining forms of Oceanides, With myriad faces raised supremely fair, And myriad arms that beckoned as he sang. Behold! a stir amidst the frothing brine, As though upheaved by powers submarine, In implicate confusion, wave on wave, Then rose with windy manes and fiery eyes, Proudly careering, the immortal steeds, Bearing, within the shell-shaped car, the god Of august aspect and imperial port, With such profusion of ambrosial locks As curl around the very front of Zeus. He with benign regard the minstrel viewed, Then whirling thrice his massy trident, struck The scarpÃ©d promontory with its fork. And Orpheus felt the solid basis yield, And heard the hollow rumbling, as when earth Rocks to her centre, and high hills spit flame. And lo! he stood before a sulphurous throne, Set in an open space, wherefrom there streamed Four rivers stagnant, black. Here Ades reigned, His very presence unto mortal sense Oppressive as low thunder in the air. The triple-headed guardian of his realm Crouched at his feet, and in the dismal murk, The hideous Harpies hovered o'er his head. The serpent-haired Eumenides stood near, Brow-bound with sanguine fillets, and the Fates Wielded the distaff, spindle, and sharp shears. The air was dense with noisome influence, And shadowy apparitions seemed to float Athwart the dusk. But on the infernal throne Conspicuous in beauty, by her lord, Persephone was seated. Wonderment Looked from her eyes, in seeing him, no god, Who came before his time among the dead, Unarmed with spear or shield, a glistening lyre Nigh slipping from the loose grasp of his hands. âWho comes unsummoned to my realm?â began The baleful godhead in discordant tones, Widely reverberant; and the low, clear voice Of Orpheus answered: âOne who would remain, If but the impotent body could be free To follow the desires of the soul,â Orpheus, an unskilled singer.â âBirth and death Are preordained for thee, presumptuous man. What narrow space of time the Fates accord, 'Twould best become thee to bear worthily, With dignity, and leave the rest to them, The end as the beginning.â âPlead for me, O beautiful Persephone,âbehold! Eurydice was snatched with violent hand From out mine eager arms, and I have sought Her image o'er the peopled earth in vain.â Then she: âI may not summon her, nor hope To swerve the haughty purpose of my lord. With influence of thy familiar voice, If thou canst touch her spirit, she is thine.â But Ades: âWho recalls the dead by prayer? They whose calm souls are once possessed by death, Find such a solid joy in grasping firm, After life's phantasms, this reality, That wisdom, grief, nor love persuadeth them Their liberated spirits to confine With fleshly limitations. Nathless sing,â And prove life's glittering evanescence vain, Outweighed by death's sublime security.â ORPHEUS. I render thanks, eternal gods, that ye Empower myself to call Eurydice. Man only can fulfill his own desire; And if I fail, the sorrow rests with me. Ye give what we deserve; I pray alone Ne'er to be cursed with what I have not won. And to whom else would I intrust my lyre, This supreme invocation to intone? But in myself I feel the love, the power, The lyric inspiration, while the flower Of all my life brings forth its proper fruit, In this my loftiest, most godlike hour. If I could make ye feel the agony Of the strong man, O gods, condemned to see The light fail from dear eyes, the white lips mute, The elusive soul take flight eternally To where we cannot follow it nor find, With the most subtle searchings of the mind, With the most passionate longings of the soul, Deaf, unresponsive as the empty wind; Then would your pity as your power be, 'Twould crown us all with immortality, And grace us with completeness, make us whole, Worthy to be the peers of deity. For we are mighty now to slay and bless, Yea, gifted with strange strength of steadfastness, To conquer bodiless and viewless foes Within ourselves, yet in our helplessness, As children, in the presence of this Death, Whom nor revolt nor patience conquereth, Implacable, with grim mouth fastened close, That with no hope our anguish answereth. Resound with wildest utterance, O my lyre; Let each note be a living flame of fire; To reach her, to burn through her, to compel, Strong with the infinite strength of my desire. I am no god, yet Fate, Eurydice, A goddess for my slave hath given me,â Immortal Music, pure, ineffable; And I send her, my handmaid, after thee. If all wherein I put my faith as sure, Be not delusions vain which death will cure; If the sublime reliance of the soul On her own powers be no empty lure, Whereat the high gods laugh in bitter scorn; If what I have achieved and what forborne, Will lead me nearer to a worthy goal, If all life's promises be not forsworn,â Eurydice, appear! Before mine eyes, O gods, I see a formless essence rise, That moulds itself unto the music's beat, Appareled in the glory of the skies. Now, while I ring a more celestial tone, The spirit more divinely bright hath grown, To larger modulations, strains complete, The white limbs from the shapeless mist are won, As from the bosom of a summer cloud, Wherewith a goddess would her semblance shroud. Is this mine own creation? Is it truth, That with warm life I have blank air endowed? The soft cloud parts asunder,âyea, 'tis she! Once more the face that was my star I see, Crowned with the beauty of immortal youth, Eurydice, my lost Eurydice! Silent beside his silent, fallen lyre, The singer stood, and clasped her in his arms, Gazing upon this pale, fair face as one Whose heart's supreme desire is satisfied. âIs not this hour the hour I have foreseen, Through all obstructions and infirmities Of my mortality, and is it not More glorious in fruition than I dreamed! Yea, I have dreamed it all, eternal gods, Even as now have pressed her to my heart With the same clinging effort to retain, And seen this breathing form, these lucent eyes Vivid as now, instinct with life and love. Yet have I waked to chill discouragement, To vacant disappointment, and the sense Of aching, unassuaged desire. O speak, For in my dreams I never hear thy voice, Save veiled and indistinct, a mockery Of the old limpid music. Speak to me: Thy flesh is warm, thy heart beats close to mine, Thine upturned face is wet with human tears; O speak to me,âlest I should wake again To barren fields and empty skies of Thrace.â Then in low, natural tones, Eurydice: âThy voice hath reached me in the farthest spheres, And waked me out of silence.â âFollow me,â It is thyself,âif I must wake from this, 'Twill be to death or madness. Follow me, From darkness palpable, to earth, to light Of ample skies, and freshness of blown grass And rolling waters.â âHold!â the jarring voice Of Ades interposed: â'Tis excellent The attribute we gave thee, to convert To such a weapon as may overcome The old hereditary foes of man, Sleep, death, corruption, and necessity. But to reveal thyself the peer of gods, Not only through inspired ecstasy, But through a continent persistency, This never was accomplished by thy race, And thou must yet be tried. This soul is thine, For thou hast won her from the jaws of Hell; Yea, she may follow thee as free as light,â Lead thou the way and charm the hostile fiends. Look forward ever; if thine eyes revert But once to gaze on her, to reassure Unworthy fears, or sate a mean desire, Thou art not mate for us. She will dissolve To empty airânever to be recalled. ORPHEUS. Back to the vital earth, O follow me, Regained Eurydice. To rippling well-heads and to sunlit plains, Greened by soft wash of rains. See orchards rosy with prolific bloom, And vineyards' purple gloom. Lulled by the languid flow of lilied streams, There will I sing my dreams. Behold! I chant a hymn of adoration, Triumphant exultation, For I can see, in all the universe, No error and no curse. The gods have naught withheld, in power and sway, From him who will obey Their own divine and everlasting laws. Above the world's applause, As vigorous as morning, he can rise, Wrest the desired prize From the clenched hands of Nemesis and Fate. With victory elate, I chant unmitigated prayer and praise To gods who part our ways, Seeing 'midst clamorous change incredible, That all is ordered well. In more harmonious strains, O lyre, express My twice-born happiness; Yea, utter and translate with larger sense My rich experience, That makes complete life's solemn threnody Joy unalloyed and free, Grief unexampled, victory at last, When strife is overpast. Through pathways hedged with horrors still they fared Invulnerable. Darkness stayed them not, Nor yet more dreadful light, revealing oft The hideous fiends who rose on every side, Huge shapes of ill, to gaze upon the twain. A Greek, who, fleeing, smote a vibrant lyre, That chimed to carols more divinely quired Than those that fill with ravishment a grove, Misty with moonlight, where the plain brown bird Makes midnight vocal. Closely following him, A woman with grave aspect, parted lips, Upraising, in enthrallÃ©d ecstasy, Large eyes serene, fulfilled with holier light For having pierced beyond the boundaries Of time and of mortality. The day Shone through the murk at last, and filled their path With dusky sunbeams; and far-stretching fields Of soft, delicious green, and crystal skies, Encouraged them; all perils past save one. But a black, stagnant river crawled along, Spanned by no bridge, and ferried by no sail, With muddy tide between the day and them. And Orpheus with enamored eyes passed on, And saw not how the loathsome waters crept, Nor how his magic song enchanted them To solid substance; but he missed at once The footsteps light that had inspired his lay. Imupetous he turned to reassure His fearful soul, and sate his hungry eyes; But as he turned, the inspiration fled, His lips refused to frame the fruitless words, His eyes beheld,âO gods! Eurydice Removed already far away from him, By all the wide-expanded space, between Our loftiest dream and our unworthy deed. She gazed with no reproachful glance nor tears, And Orpheus felt himself beneath her, fall, Momently down from empyreal heights, And lo! he stood within the fields of Thrace, On earth familiar, 'neath familiar skies, And heard a voice float through the shining air, From unimaginable distances, Faint as a dream,ââFarewell, farewell, farewell.â âWoe! woe! what lamentations may express The fullness of my new calamity! I, overbearing, who presumed to reach The lordly and severe stability Of the immortals,âwhom may I invoke? To whom may man appeal when he hath failed Unto himself? What god will interpose To thwart invincible necessity? Lost, lost forever! I stood elevate, For one brief moment dreaming I had won The skill and power of true divinity. Gods! with what lofty and superb disdain Ye must look down on mine unworthy haste,â Ye, who with grandeur of sublime repose, And majesty of patience, still abide Invariable through eternity! Alas! my mighty visions were to me Auspicious omens, and they fed my heart With vigor and encouragement; but now, This was no dream; for Hope, full-flushed and fair, Born, like the freshness of auroral dew, From unseen air, and traceless vanishing, Consorts not with this mighty goddess, Truth, With solemn and unfathomable eyes, For Truth is one with Death and Destiny. With what a depth of meaning didst thou turn, For the last time, to me, Eurydice, A glory 'midst the darkness, with that glance Of infinite compassion, hands outstretched, As if to save me from mine own defect. With what humiliation and despair I saw thee rising unattainably!â The vault, the stream accursed had disappeared; I was in Thrace uplooking to the sky. O, to what harmonies I might have wed The blessed tidings which all men await! Now I can only make my song express A distant echo, a suggestion vague, Of the serene contentment of thy voice. Sing this, my lyre, that all who hark to thee With an attentive and a gentle ear, May hear the promise, faint and yet assured, Recall the grace and the deliciousness Of immortality, and strive anew Towards the ideal unattained by me, Yet still accessible to stronger souls.â Thus Orpheus, when the first wild burst of woe Had passed; no need to seek her now; No need to wander o'er the peopled earth. Was he in truth a victim of the gods, Or rather with a fairer fortune blest Than happier men, selected for a fate Divinely tragical, that he might know The fullness of a life's experience, And find expression adequate for all, Simple as wisdom, and as dignified As silence? From his kind he lived apart, As one who cherishes a grief, nor seeks Forgetfulness nor comfort; elevate To glittering eminence by destiny, And lonely through the privacy of woe Beyond the reaches of man's sympathy. Where lucid Hebrus bathes its golden sands, He sat discoursing gracious harmonies, Amidst the morning fields, when on his ears Sounded with horrid dissonance the clang Of smitten cymbals and the throb of drums. But still the revelers remained unseen, Till, rounding suddenly a neighboring hill, The whole mad troop came dancing into sight. First marched a jovial bacchanal, who bore A crystal vessel, decked with branching vine, Then youth and nymphs with ivy chapleted, In purfled raiment of hues delicate, With mitres, thyrsi, cymbals, drums and flutes, Some balancing upon their graceful heads, Regal with crisp-curled gold, their burdens light Of baskets heaped with figs and dusky grapes. And 'midst them all the sacrificial goat, Adorned with berries. Thus the festal throng, With wanton gestures, and with antic bounds, And wild embracings, mad with wine, approached, With peals of laughter, echoing faintly back From jocund hill to hill, and lusty shouts Of âBacchÃ©, BacchÃ©!â SONG. With wassail all the night, Celestial Bacchus, we have worshipped thee! With riotous revel and with festal wine. Still on the hills in early morning light, With frolic dances and brisk jollity, Our hymns of praise are thine. For we have seen thee, god! The fawn-skin slipping from thy shoulder bare, Thy gestures lithe and loose, thine eyes that shine, Thy rosy hands that waved a clustered rod Of uncrushed grapes, and thine ambrosial hair, Dripping with myrrh and wine. Thou art not strict, severe, Like loftier gods and ruthless goddesses, Implacable like Pallas, Zeus, or Truth; But to humanity akin and near, Eager for folly, and the luxuries Of lustful health and youth. This crystal-vialed balm, Divinely brewed, soothing as Lethe's streams, Is the most generous gift of Deity, Informing us with soft oblivion calm Of Death and Fate, with joys beyond the dreams Of grave sobriety. Come, let us drink again. Resound, O timbrels, and thou bird-voiced flute; Thyrsus and pipes make shrill and clear acclaim, To Bacchus, who impurples hill and plain With vineyards bursting with increase of fruit, Subtle as liquid flame. ÅvoÃ«! quaff and sing! Who drinks no more, offends the deity Of Bacchus! lo on Hebrus' grassy brink, A minstrel sits, with gold lute glistening, Marring our rites with stern solemnity, Who doth not chant nor drink. Ho! Orpheus, laugh again, From mirthful heart, and join our happy throng; Cease to lament with unappeased desire. We bring a cordial for all grief and pain. Add to the choral strain thy siren song, And thine enchanted lyre. For Fate hath answered thee With cold derision; Death respondeth not. Here is a god who soothes the soul and sense With sweet nepenthe,âthy Eurydice Thou wilt not lure to earthly grove nor grot With suasive eloquence. Here, nymphs no whit less fair Are waiting thee, with warm, caressing arms And loving eyes, lips fit for gods to kiss, And rosy shoulders, dimpling white and bare,â Pliant and graceful, with innumerous charms, To sate thy heart with bliss. ORPHEUS. Hence, thou ignoble throng! Dare ye profane the splendid purity, The high nobility of morn, with rites Lewd and disgusting, and delirious song, Completing in clear sunshine, shamelessly, Rude orgies of wild nights? BACCHANTES. Ha! he insults the god, With his presumptuous and impious scorn. Avenge, O bacchanals, the cause divine; Compel him with the sacred cup and rod, To quaff his salutation to the morn, In frothing, Massic wine! ORPHEUS. Mad bacchanals, begone! I honor all the gods and Nemesis. They favor not such frantic revelry, But blameless lives, and deeds most like their own, The service of a patient heart submiss, And staunch integrity. Behold the morning hills, Sky-kissed Libethra, delicate as air; The fragile grasses gray with wreaths of dew. Hark to the tumbling of the mountain rills To Eos and Athene your first prayer And sacrifice are due. BACCHANTES. With shameless blasphemy, He dares proscribe, O god, thy rank and fame. Enough! enough! he hath despised us long, Bewailing his beloved Eurydice. O nymphs, avenge yourselves in Liber's name, Slay him 'midst dance and song. Your deadly javelins fling With flinty missiles at the singer proud, Who deems himself an equal of the gods, Because he hath the skill to pipe and sing, With facile fluency of speech endowed. Smite him with spears and rods. ORPHEUS. Ring forth, my lyre, again,â With magic harmonies my doom avert, In tones as plaintive and as rich as life. BACCHANTES. Our stones and javelins we have hurled in vain; His lyre enchants them, he remains unhurt, 'Midst all the wrath and strife. Toss the loud tambourine, Its tight-drawn skin with noisy fingers smite; Clash ye the cymbals, sing with fatal art; Cast ye his sundered limbs the stream within,â They irritate us, soft and bare and white; Rend them, O nymphs, apart. ORPHEUS. Sweet Death, deliver me Out of the reach of envy, lust, and hate; Enfold me in thy large-embracing arms. BACCHANTES. Ah! will he now invoke Eurydice, Madly resisting his allotted fate With vile, unhallowed charms? So with a clamorous swell Of drums and timbrels, we o'erpower the breath Of dulcet and persuasive melody. ORPHEUS. The maniacs conquer! O my lyre, farewell! Approach, thou beautiful and welcome Death, With lost Eurydice. December 2, 1869. LOHENGRIN. TO MY COUSIN WASHINGTON. 1870. PROEM. The alert and valiant faith that could respond, Upon life's threshold, to the highest call, Unquestioning of what might lie beyond,â Courage afield and courtesy in hall, And sweet, unbroken patience therewithal, And simple loyalty,âcan these things be The virtues that have died with chivalry? The lapsing stream that leads to love and fate, Now mystic-shadowed, and now broad and free, Reflecting all the gold of heaven's gate; The snowy bird's symbolic purity, The toilsome contest and the victory, The troubled joy of life, and after these, The crowning guerdon of the perfect peace,â These dreams have filled my dazzled sense and brain, With images so vivid that at last I wake to life and find them all again Repeated in the present as the past, The hues recolored and the forms recast; And in familiar eyes I see outshine The old heroic faith in love divine. No empty fable of a day long dead, No baseless vision of some sanguine saint, No legend, only half rememberÃ©d, Of prowess obsolete and virtues quaint; But be this rather a reflection faint Of that which taught me how the near and real Surpass in strength and beauty the ideal. LOHENGRIN. The holy bell, untouched by human hands, Clanged suddenly, and tolled with solemn knell. Between the massive, blazoned temple-doors, Thrown wide, to let the summer morning in, Sir Lohengrin, the youngest of the knights, Had paused to taste the sweetness of the air. All sounds came up the mountain-side to him, Softened to music,ânoise of laboring men, The cheerful cock-crow and the low of kine, Bleating of sheep, and twittering of the birds, Commingled into murmurous harmoniesâ When harsh, and near, and clamorous tolled the bell. He started, with his hand upon his sword; His face, an instant since serene and fair, And simple with the beauty of a boy, Heroic, flushed, expectant all at once. The lovely valley stretching out beneath Was now a painted picture,ânothing more; All music of the mountain or the vale Rang meaningless to him who heard the bell. âI stand upon the threshold, and am called,â His clear, young voice shrilled gladly through the air, And backward through the sounding corridors. âAnd have ye heard the bell, my brother knights, Untouched by human hands or winds of heaven? It called me, yea, it called my very name!â So, breathing still of morning, Lohengrin Sprang 'midst the gathering circle of the knights, Eager, exalted. âNay, it called us all: It rang as it hath often rung before,â Because the good cause, somewhere on the earth, Requires a champion,â with a serious smile, An elder gravely answered. âWhere to go? We know not, and we know not whom to serve.â Then spake Sir Percivale, their holiest knight, And father of the young Sir Lohengrin: âAll that to us seems old, familiar, stale, Unto the boy is vision, miracle. Cross him not, brethren, in his first desire. I will dare swear the summons rang to him, Not sternly solemn, as it tolled to us, But gracious, sweet, and gay as marriage-bells.â His pious hands above the young man's head Wandered in blessing, lightly touching it, As fondly as a mother. âLohengrin, My son, farewell,âGod send thee faith and strength.â âGod send me patience and humility,â Murmured the boyish knight, from contrite heart, With head downcast for those anointing hands. Then raising suddenly wide, innocent eyes,â âFather, my faith is boundless as God's love.â Complete in glittering silver armor clad, With silver maiden-shield, blank of device, Sir Lohengrin rode down the Montsalvatsch, With Percivale and Tristram, Frimutelle And Eliduc, to speed him on his quest. They fared in silence, for the elder knights Were filled with grave misgivings, solemn thoughts Of fate and sorrow, and they heard the bell Tolling incessant; while Sir Lohengrin, Buoyant with hope, and dreaming like a girl, With wild blood dancing in his veins, had made The journey down the mount unconsciously, Surprised to find that he had reached the vale. Distinct and bowered in green the mountain loomed, Topped with the wondrous temple, with its cross Smitten to splendor by the eastern sun. Around them lay the valley beautiful, Imparadised with flowers and light of June; And through the valley flowed a willowy stream, Golden and gray, at this delicious hour, With purity and sunshine. Here the knights, Irresolute, gave pause,âwhich path to choose? âGod lead me right!â said meek Sir Lohengrin; And as he spoke, afar upon the stream, He saw a shining swan approaching them. Full-breasted, with the current it sailed down, Dazzling in sun and shadow, air and wave, With unseen movement, wings a little spread, Their downy under-feathers fluttering, Stirred by its stately progress; in its beak It held a silver chain, and drew thereby A dainty carven shallop after it, Embossed with silver and with ivory. âLead ye my charger up the mount again,â Cried Lohengrin, and leaped unto the ground, âFor I will trust my guidance to the swan.â âNay, hold, Sir Lohengrin,â said Eliduc, âThou hast not made provision for this quest.â âGod will provide,â the pious knight replied. Then Percival: âBe faithful to thy vows; Bethink thee of thine oath when thou art asked Thy mission in the temple, or thy race. Farewell, farewell.â âFarewell,â cried Lohengrin, And sprang into the shallop as it passed, And waved farewells unto his brother knights, Until they saw the white and silver shine Of boat and swan and armor less and less, Till in the willowy distance they were lost. Skirting the bases of the rolling hills, He glided on the river hour by hour, All through the endless summer day. At first On either side the willows brushed his boat, Then underneath their sweeping arch he passed, Into a rich, enchanted wilderness, Cool, full of mystic shadows and rare lights, Wherein the very river changed its hue, Reflecting tender shades of waving green, And mossy undergrowth of grass and fern. Here yellow lilies floated 'midst broad leaves, Upon their reedy stalks, and far below, Beneath the flags and rushes, coppery bream Sedately sailed, and flickering perch, and dace With silvery lustres caught the glancing rays Of the June sun upon their mottled scales. 'Midst the close sedge the bright-eyed water-mouse Nibbled its food, while overhead, its kin, The squirrel, frisked among the trees. The air Was full of life and sound of restless birds, Darting with gayer tints of red and blue And speckled plumage 'mid gray willow leaves, And sober alders, and light-foliaged birch. Unnumbered insects fluttered o'er the banks, Some dimpling the smooth river's slippery floor, Leaping from point to point. Then passed the knight 'Twixt broad fields basking in excess of light, And girt around by range on range of hills, Green, umber, purple, waving limitless, Unto the radiant crystal of the sky. Through unfamiliar solitudes the swan Still led him, and he saw no living thing Save creatures of the wood, no human face, Nor sign of human dwelling. But he sailed, Holding high thoughts and vowing valorous vows, Filled with vast wonder and keen happiness, At the world's very beauty, and his life Opened in spacious vistas measureless, As lovely as the stream that bore him on. So dazzled was the boyish Lohengrin By all the vital beauty of the real, And the yet wilder beauty of his dreams, That he had lost all sense of passing time, And woke as from a trance of centuries, To find himself within the heart of hills, The river widened to an ample lake, And the swan faring towards a narrow gorge, That seemed to lead him to the sunset clouds. Suffused with color were the extremest heights; The river rippled in a glassy flood, Glorying in the glory of the sky. O what a moment for a man to take Down with him in his memory to the grave! Life at that hour appeared as infinite As expectation, sacred, wonderful, A vision and a privilege. The stream Lessened to force its way through rocky walls, Then swerved and flowed, a purple brook, through woods Dewy with evening, sunless, odorous. There Lohengrin, with eyes upon the stream, Now brighter than the earth, saw, deep and clear, The delicate splendor of the earliest star. All night, too full of sweet expectancy, Too reverent of the loveliness, for sleep, He watched the rise and setting of the stars. All things were new upon that magic day, Suggesting nobler possibilities, For a life passed in wise serenity, Confided with sublimely simple faith Unto the guidance of the higher will. In the still heavens hung the large round moon, White on the blue-black ripples glittering, And rolled soft floods of slumberous, misty light Over dim fields and colorless, huge hills. But the pure swan still bore its burden on, The ivory shallop and the silver knight, Pale-faced in that white lustre, neither made For any port, but seemed to float at will Aimlessly in a strange, unpeopled land. So passed the short fair night, and morning broke Upon the river where it flowed through flats Wide, fresh, and vague in gray, uncertain dawn, With cool air sweet from leagues of dewy grass. Then 'midst the flush and beauty of the east, The risen sun made all the river flow, Smitten with light, in gold and gray again. Rightly he judged his voyage but begun, When the swan loitered by low banks set thick With cresses, and red berries, and sweet herbs, That he might pluck and taste thereof; for these Such wondrous vigor in his frame infused, They seemed enchanted and ambrosial fruits. Day waxed and waned and vanished many times, And many suns still found him journeying; But when the sixth night darkened hill and wold, He seemed bewitched as by a wizard's spell, By this slow, constant progress, and deep sleep Possessed his spirit, and his head drooped low On the hard pillow of his silver shield. Unconscious he was borne through silent hours, Nor wakened by the dawn of a new day, But in his dreamless sleep he never lost The sense of moving forward on a stream. Now fared the swan through tilled and cultured lands, Dappled with sheep and kine on pastures soft, Sprinkled with trim and pleasant cottages, With men and women working noiselessly, As in a picture; nearer then they drew, And sounds of rural labor, spoken words, Sir Lohengrin might hear, but still he slept, Nor saw the shining turrets of a town, Gardens and castles, domes and cross-topped spires Fair in the distance, and the flowing stream, Cleaving its liquid path 'midst many men, And glittering galleries filled with courtly folk, Ranged for a tourney-show in open air. Ah! what a miracle it seemed to these,â The white bird bearing on the river's breast That curious, sparkling shallop, and within The knight in silver armor, with bared head, And crisp hair blown about his angel face, Asleep upon his shield! They gazed on him As on the incarnate spirit of pure faith, And as the very ministrant of God. But one great damsel throned beside a king, With coroneted head and white, wan face, Flushed suddenly, and clasped her hands in prayer, And raised large, lucid eyes in thanks to Heaven. Then, in his dreamless slumber, Lohengrin, Feeling the steady motion of the boat Suddenly cease, awoke. Refreshed, alert, He knew at once that he had reached his port, And saw that peerless maiden thanking Heaven For his own advent, and his heart leaped up Into his throat, and love o'ermastered him. After the blare of flourished trumpets died, A herald thus proclaimed the tournament: âGreetings and glory to the majesty Of the imperial Henry. By his grace, This tourney has been granted to the knight, Frederick of Telramund, who claims the hand Of Lady Elsie, Duchess of Brabant, His ward, and stands prepared to prove in arms His rights against all champions in the lists, Whom his unwilling mistress may select. Sir Frederick, Lord of Telramund, is here: What champion will espouse the lady's cause?â Sir Frederick, huge in stature and in bulk, In gleaming armor terribly equipped, Advanced defiant, as the herald ceased. Then Lohengrin, with spear and shield in hand, Sprang lightly, from his shallop, in the lists. His beaver raised disclosed his ardent face, His whole soul shining from inspired eyes. With cast-back head, sun-smitten silver mail, Quivering with spirit, light, and life, he stood, And flung his gauntlet at Sir Frederick's feet, Crying with shrill, clear voice that rang again, âSir Lohengrin adopts the lady's cause.â Then these with shock of conflict couched their spears In deadly combat; but their weapons clanged Harmless against their mail impregnable, Or else were nimbly foiled by dexterous shields. Unequal and unjust it seemed at first,â The slender boy matched with the warrior huge, Who bore upon him with the skill and strength Of a tried conqueror; but the stranger knight Displayed such agile grace in parrying blows, Such fiery valor dealing his own strokes, That men looked on in wonder, and his foe Was hardly put upon it for his life. Thrice they gave pause, to breathe, and to prepare For fiercer battle, and the galleries rang With plaudits, and the names of both the knights. And they, with spirits whetted by the strife, Met for the fourth, last time, and fenced and struck, And the keen lance of Lohengrin made way, Between the meshes of Sir Frederick's mail, Through cuirass and through jerkin, to the flesh, With pain so sharp and sudden that he fell. Then Henry threw his warder to the ground, And cried the stranger knight had won the day; And all the lesser voices, following his, Called, âLohengrinâSir Lohengrin hath won!â He, flushed with victory, standing in the lists, Deafened with clamor of his very name, ReÃ«choed to the heavens, felt himself Alone and alien, and would fain float back Unto the temple, had he not recalled The fair, great damsel throned beside the king. But lo! the swan had vanished, and the boat He fancied he descried a tiny star, Glimmering in the shining distances. âHis Majesty would greet Sir Lohengrin; And Lady Elsie, Duchess of Brabant, Would thank him for his prowess.â Thus proclaimed The herald, while the unknown knight was led To the imperial throne. Then Elsie spake: âThou hast redeemed my life from misery; How may I worthily reward or thank? Be thou the nearest to our ducal throne, The highest knight of Limburg and Brabant, The greatest gentleman,âunless thy rank, In truth, be suited to thine own deserts, And thou, a prince, art called to higher aims.â âMadam, my thanks are rather due to Fate, For having chosen so poor an instrument For such a noble end. A knight am I, The champion of the helpless and oppressed, Bound by fast vows to own no other name Than Lohengrin, the Stranger, in this land, And to depart when asked my race or rank. Trusting in God I came, and, trusting Him, I must remain, for all my fate hath changed, All my desires and hopes, since I am here.â So ended that great joust, and in the days Thereafter Elsie and Sir Lohengrin, United by a circumstance so strange, Loved and were wedded. A more courteous duke, A braver chevalier, Brabant ne'er saw. Such grace breathed from his person and his deeds, Such simple innocence and faith looked forth From eyes well-nigh too beautiful for man, That whom he met, departed as his friend. But Elsie, bound to him by every bond Of love and honor and vast gratitude, Being of lesser faith and confidence, Tortured herself with envious jealousies, Misdoubting her own beauty, and her power To win and to retain so great a heart. Each year Sir Lohengrin proclaimed a joust In memory of the tourney where he won His lovely Duchess, and his lance prevailed Against all lesser knights. When his twain sons, Loyal and brave and gentle as their sire, Had grown to stalwart men, and his one girl, Eyed like himself and as his Duchess fair, Floramie, grew to gracious maidenhood, He gave a noble tourney, and o'erthrew The terrible and potent Duke of Cleves. âHa!â sneered the Dame of Cleves, âthis Lohengrin May be a knight adroit and valorous, But who knows whence he sprang?â and lightly laughed, Seeing the hot blood kindle Elsie's cheek. That night Sir Lohengrin sought rest betimes, By hours of crowded action quite forespent, And found the Duchess Elsie on her couch, Staining the silken broideries with her tears. âWhy dost thou weep?â he questioned tenderly, Kissing her delicate hands, and parting back Her heavy yellow hair from brow and face. âThe Duchess Anne of Cleves hath wounded me.â âSweet, am not I at hand to comfort thee?â And he caressed her as an ailing child, Until she smiled and slept. But the next night He found her weeping, and he questioned her, With the same answer, and again she slept; Then the third night he asked her why she grieved, And she uprising, white, with eager eyes, Cried, âLohengrin, my lord, my only love, For our sons' sake, who know not whence they spring, Our daughter who remains a virgin yet, Let me not hear folk girding at thy race. I know thy blood is royal, I have faith; But tell me all, that I may publish it Unto our dukedom.â Hurt and wondering, He answered simply, âI am Lohengrin, Son to Sir Percivale; and ministrant Within the holy temple of the Grail. I would thy faith were greater, this is all. Now must I bid farewell.â âO Lohengrin, What have I done?â She clung about his neck, And moistened all his beard with streaming tears; But he with one long kiss relaxed her arms Calmly from his embrace, and stood alone. âBlame not thy nature now with vain reproofs. This also is our fate: in all things else We have submitted,âlet us yield in this, With no less grace now that God tries our hearts, Than when He sent us victory and love.â âYea, go,âyou never loved me,â faltered she; âI will not blame my nature, but your own. Through all our wedded years I doubted you; Your eyes have never brightened meeting mine As I have seen them in religious zeal, Or in exalted hours of victory.â A look of perfect weariness, unmixed With wrath or grief, o'erspread the knight's pale face; But with the pity that a god might show Towards one with ills impossible to him, He drew anear, caressing her, and sighed: âThrough all our wedded years you doubted me? Poor child, poor child! and it has come to this. Thank Heaven, I gave no cause for your mistrust, Desiring never an ideal more fair Of womanhood than was my chosen wife.â She, broken, sobbing, leaned her delicate head On his great shoulder, and remorseful cried, âO loyal, honest, simple Lohengrin, Thy wife has been unworthy: this is why Thou sayest farewell in accents cold and strange, With alien eyes that even now behold Things fairer, better, than her mournful face.â But he with large allowance answered her: âIf this be truth, it is because I feel That I belong no more unto myself, Neither to thee, for God withdraws my soul Beyond all earthly passions unto Him. Now that we know our doom, with serious calm, Beside thee I will sit, till break of day, Thus holding thy chill hand and tell thee all. This will resign thee, for I cannot think How any human soul that hath beheld Life's compensations and its miracles, Can fail to trust in what is yet to come.â Then he began from that auroral hour When he first heard the temple bell, and told The wonder of the swan that came for him, His journey down the stream, the tournament, His strength unwonted, combating the knight Who towered above him with superior force Of flesh and sinew,âhow he prayed through all, Imploring God to let the just cause win, Unconscious of the close-thronged galleries, Feeling two eyes alone that burned his soul. She knew the rest. Therewith he kissed her brow And ended,ââNow the knights will take me back Into the temple; all who keep their vows, Are welcomed there again to peace and rest. There will my years fall from me like a cloak, And I will stand again at manhood's prime. Then when all errors of the flesh are purged From these I loved here, they may follow me, Unto perpetual worship and to peace.â She lay quite calm, and smiling heard his voice, Already grown to her remote and changed, And when he ceased, arose and gazed in awe On his transfigured face and kissed his brow, And understood, accepting all her fate. Anon he called his children, and to these: âFarewell, sweet Florance and dear Percivale; Here is my horn, and here mine ancient sword,â Guard them with care and win with them repute. Here, Elsie, is the ring my mother gave,â Part with it never; and thou, Floramie, Take thou my love,âI have naught else to give; Be of strong faith in him thou mean'st to wed.â So these communed together, till the night Died from the brightening skies, and in the east The morning star hung in aerial rose, And the blue deepened; while moist lawn and hedge Breathed dewy freshness through the windows oped. Then on the stream, that nigh the palace flowed, A stainless swan approached them; in its beak It held a silver chain, and drew thereby A dainty, carven shallop after it, Embossed with silver and with ivory. Followed by waved farewells and streaming eyes, Sir Lohengrin embarked and floated forth Unto perpetual worship and to peace. MISCELLANEOUS. FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE. Upon the whitewashed walls A woman's shadow falls, A woman walketh o'er the darksome floors. A soft, angelic smile Lighteth her face the while, In passing through the dismal corridors. And now and then there slips A word from out her lips, More sweet and grateful to those listening ears Than the most plaintive tale Of the sad nightingale, Whose name and tenderness this woman bears. Her presence in the room Of agony and gloom, No fretful murmurs, no coarse words profane; For while she standeth there, All words are hushed save prayer; She seems God's angel weeping o'er man's pain. And some of them arise, With eager, tearful eyes, From off their couch to see her passing by. Some, e'en too weak for this, Can only stoop and kiss Her shadow, and fall back content to die. No monument of stone Needs this heroic one,â Her name is graven on each noble heart; And in all after years Her praise will be the tears Which at that name from quivering lids will start. And those who live not now, To see the sainted brow, And the angelic smile before it flits for aye, They in the future age Will kiss the storied page Whereon the shadow of her life will lie. March 7, 1867. DREAMS. A dream of lilies: all the blooming earth, A garden full of fairies and of flowers; Its only music the glad cry of mirth, While the warm sun weaves golden-tissued hours; Hope a bright angel, beautiful and true As Truth herself, and life a lovely toy, Which ne'er will weary us, ne'er break, a new Eternal source of pleasure and of joy. A dream of roses: vision of Love's tree, Of beauty and of madness, and as bright As naught on earth save only dreams can be, Made fair and odorous with flower and light; A dream that Love is strong to outlast Time, That hearts are stronger than forgetfulness, The slippery sand than changeful waves that climb, The wind-blown foam than mighty waters' stress. A dream of laurels: after much is gone, Much buried, much lamented, much forgot, With what remains to do and what is done, With what yet is, and what, alas! is not, Man dreams a dream of laurel and of bays, A dream of crowns and guerdons and rewards, Wherein sounds sweet the hollow voice of praise, And bright appears the wreath that it awards. A dream of poppies, sad and true as Truth,â That all these dreams were dreams of vanity; And full of bitter penitence and ruth, In his last dream, man deems 'twere good to die: And weeping o'er the visions vain of yore, In the sad vigils he doth nightly keep, He dreams it may be good to dream no more, And life has nothing like Death's dreamless sleep. April 30, 1867. ON A TUFT OF GRASS. Weak, slender blades of tender green, With little fragrance, little sheen, What maketh ye so dear to all? Nor bud, nor flower, nor fruit have ye, So tiny, it can only be 'Mongst fairies ye are counted tall. No beauty is in this,âah, yea, E'en as I gaze on you to-day, Your hue and fragrance bear me back Into the green, wide fields of old, With clear, blue air, and manifold Bright buds and flowers in blossoming track. All bent one way like flickering flame, Each blade caught sunlight as it came, Then rising, saddened into shade; A changeful, wavy, harmless sea, Whose billows none could bitterly Reproach with wrecks that they had made. No gold ever was buried there More rich, more precious, or more fair Than buttercups with yellow gloss. No ships of mighty forest trees E'er foundered in these guiltless seas Of grassy waves and tender moss. Ah, no! ah, no! not guiltless still, Green waves on meadow and on hill, Not wholly innocent are ye; For what dead hopes and loves, what graves, Lie underneath your placid waves, While breezes kiss them lovingly! Calm sleepers with sealed eyes lie there; They see not, neither feel nor care If over them the grass be green. And some sleep here who ne'er knew rest, Until the grass grew o'er their breast, And stilled the aching pain within. Not all the sorrow man hath known, Not all the evil he hath done, Have ever cast thereon a stain. It groweth green and fresh and light, As in the olden garden bright, Beneath the feet of Eve and Cain. It flutters, bows, and bends, and quivers, And creeps through forests and by rivers, Each blade with dewy brightness wet, So soft, so quiet, and so fair, We almost dream of sleeping there, Without or sorrow or regret. May 22, 1867. IN THE JEWISH SYNAGOGUE AT NEWPORT. Here, where the noises of the busy town, The ocean's plunge and roar can enter not, We stand and gaze around with tearful awe, And muse upon the consecrated spot. No signs of life are here: the very prayers Inscribed around are in a language dead; The light of the âperpetual lampâ is spent That an undying radiance was to shed. What prayers were in this temple offered up, Wrung from sad hearts that knew no joy on earth, By these lone exiles of a thousand years, From the fair sunrise land that gave them birth! Now as we gaze, in this new world of light, Upon this relic of the days of old, The present vanishes, and tropic bloom And Eastern towns and temples we behold. Again we see the patriarch with his flocks, The purple seas, the hot blue sky o'erhead, The slaves of Egypt,âomens, mysteries,â Dark fleeing hosts by flaming angels led. A wondrous light upon a sky-kissed mount, A man who reads Jehovah's written law, 'Midst blinding glory and effulgence rare, Unto a people prone with reverent awe. The pride of luxury's barbaric pomp, In the rich court of royal Solomonâ Alas! we wake: one scene alone remains,â The exiles by the streams of Babylon. Our softened voices send us back again But mournful echoes through the empty hall; Our footsteps have a strange unnatural sound, And with unwonted gentleness they fall. The weary ones, the sad, the suffering, All found their comfort in the holy place, And children's gladness and men's gratitude Took voice and mingled in the chant of praise. The funeral and the marriage, now, alas! We know not which is sadder to recall; For youth and happiness have followed age, And green grass lieth gently over all. Nathless the sacred shrine is holy yet, With its lone floors where reverent feet once trod. Take off your shoes as by the burning bush, Before the mystery of death and God. July, 1867. WINGS. Dawn opes her pensive eyes, In the yet starry skies, A roseate blush upon her cheek and brows. Her purple mantle still Lies on the sky-kissed hill, And a blue, solemn shade thereon it throws. The earth lies hushed and calm, No chant of praise, no psalm Riseth to greet the rose-crowned queen of day. Each blade of grass, each leaf, Stands out in sharp relief, Against the rayless blue and silver gray. All nature seems to wait For some new deed of Fate; The silence is a sacred, reverent prayer,â When hark! from some sweet throat One thrilling, quivering note Fills with its tremulous music all the air. Then from the dewy grass A tiny form doth pass, A little soul all music and all wings. All nature's voice is heard, Embodied in this bird, That darteth up and, rising, ever sings. It mounteth still and sings: What soul yearns not for wings, To follow after, burst its prison bars, And learn the secret there, In those clear realms of air,â The secret of the rainbow and the stars; To rush as swift as light, Within those regions bright Of throbbing, scintillant, intensest blue; The air all breathless cleave, And far below to leave Regrets and tears, the raindrop and the dew. Ah! caged 'mongst meaner things, The soul can use no wings, And beats against the bars it cannot pass; But it might humbly turn, Essaying first to learn The secret of the flowers and the grass. November, 1867. IN A SWEDISH GRAVEYARD. âThey all sleep with their heads to the westward. Each held a lighted taper in his hand when he died, and in his coffin were placed his little heart-treasures and a piece of money for his last journey.â Longfellow, Rural Life in Sweden. After wearisome toil and much sorrow, How quietly sleep they at last, Neither dreading and fearing the morrow, Nor vainly bemoaning the past! Shall we give them our envy or pity? Shall we shun or yearn after such rest, So calm near the turbulent city, With their heart stilled at length in their breast? They all sleep with their heads lying westward, Where all suns and all days have gone down. Do they long for the dawn, looking eastward? Do they dream of the strife and the crown? Each one held a lit taper when dying: Where hath vanished the fugitive flame? With his love, and his joy, and his sighing, Alas! and his youth and his name. The living stands o'er him and dreameth, And wonders what dreams came to him. While the tender, brief twilight still gleameth, With a light strangely mournful and dim. And he wonders what lights and what shadows Passed over these dead long ago, When their feet now at rest trod these meadows, And their hearts throbbed to pleasure or woe. What dreams came to them in their living? The self-same that come now to thee. If thou findest those dreams are deceiving, Then these lives thou wilt know and wilt see: The same visions of love and of glory, The same vain regret for the past; All the same poor and pitiful story, Till the taper's extinguished at last. All the treasures on earth that they cherished, Now they care not to clasp nor to save; And the poor little lights, how they perished, Slowly dying alone in the grave! With a flickering faint on the features Of age, or of youth in its bloom: Lighting up for grim Death his weak creatures, In the darkness and night of the tomb,â With a radiance ghostly and mournful, On the good, on the just and unjust; For a space, till the monarch, so scornful, Turned the light and the lighted to dust. No taper of earth he desired In his halls where they quietly rest; For all those who have toiled and are tired, Utter darkness and sleep may be best. 1867. MARJORIE'S WOOING. The corn was yellow upon the cliffs, The fluttering grass was green to see, The waves were blue as the sky above, And the sun it was shining merrily. âMarjorie, Marjorie! do you love me, Faithfully, truly as I love you?â The little lass reddened, and whitened, and smiled, And answered him with her clear eyes of blue. âMarjorie, you are but gentle and young; I am too old and too rough for you.â The little lass, trustfully giving her hand, Answered, âI love you, faithful and true.â âMarjorie, Marjorie, when shall we wed?â âAs soon as you will it,âto-morrow, to-day.â âMarjorie, Marjorie, if you knew all, Would you still say me the words that you say?â âIf I knew all?â said the little lass, âI know you are Kenneth, the brave and strong; I know that I love, and that you are good: I will know it e'er, and have known it long.â âMarjorie, Marjorie, if I should say I fled from prison to come to you; I stabbed a man all for jealous love; I am not noble, nor good, nor true?â âKenneth, your eyes would belie your words,â Boldly and bravely the lass replied. âWhy should God fill them with love and truth, And your heart with cruelty, hate, and pride?â âMarjorie, Marjorie, if I should say That I loved many ere I loved you?â âEre you had seen me,â Marjorie said, âHow could you know I was loving and true?â âMarjorie, Marjorie, if I should say That I was outcast on land and on sea?â âAll the more reason,â the little maid said, âWhy you should ever be loved by me.â âMarjorie, Marjorie, if I should say That I was noble, and titled, and grand; Lord of the woods, and the castle, and park, Lord of the acres of corn o'er the land?â Dropping a courtesy, the little lass said, âStill should I love you and ever be true; But if you found me too lowly and poor, I should bid farewell and go die for you.â âMarjorie, darling, I tell you then, This is the truth, and the land is mine, And the castle, the park, and the vessel far off, And whatever is mine, is thine, dear, thine!â December 25, 1867. THE GARDEN OF ADONIS. (The Garden of Life in Spenser's âFaerie Queene.â) It is no fabled garden in the skies, But bloometh here,âthis is no world of death; And nothing that once liveth, ever dies, And naught that breathes can ever cease to breathe, And naught that bloometh ever withereth. The gods can ne'er take back their gifts from men, They gave us life,âthey cannot take again. Who hath known Death, and who hath seen his face? On what high mountain have ye met with him? Within what lowest valley is there trace Of his feared footsteps? in what forest dim, In what great city, in what lonely ways? Nay, there is no such god, but one called Change, And all he does is beautiful and strange. It is but Change that lays our darlings low, And, though we doubt and fear, forsakes them not. Where red lips smiled do sweetest roses blow, And star-flowers bloom above the lovely spot Where gleamed the eyes, with blue forget-me-not. And through the grasses runs the same wave there We knew of old within the golden hair. Dig in the earth,âye shall not surely find Death or death's semblance; only roots of flowers. And all fair, goodly things there live enshrined, With the foundations of the glad green bowers, Through which the sunshine comes in golden showers. And all the blossoms that this earth enwreathe, Are for assurance that there is no death. O mother, raise thy tear-bathed lids again: Thy child died not, he only liveth more,â His soul is in the sunshine and the rain, His life is in the waters and the shore, He is around thee all the wide world o'er; The daisy thou hast plucked smiles back at thee, Because it doth again its mother see. What noble deed that ever lived, is dead, Or yet hath lost its power to inspire Courage in hearts that sicken, and to shed New faith and hope when hands and footsteps tire, And make sad, downcast eyes look upward higher? Yea, all men see and know it, whence it came; It purifies them like a burning flame. And dreams? What dreams were ever lost and gone, But wandering in strange lands we found again? When least we think of these dear birdlings flown, We find that bright and fresh they still remain. The garden of all life is round us then; And he is blind who doth not know and see, And praise the gods for immortality. May, 1868. MORNING. Gray-vested Dawn, with flameless, tranquil eye. Cool hands, and dewy lips, is in the sky, A sober nun, with starry rosary. With eyes downcast and with uplifted palm, She seems to whisper now her silent psalm; Beneath her gaze the sleeping earth is calm. Her prayer is ended, and she riseth slow, And o'er the hills she quietly doth go, Noiseless and gentle as the midnight snow. Then suddenly the pale east blushes red, The flowers to see upraise a sleepy head, The rosy colors deepen, grow, and spread. A cool breeze whispers: âShe is coming now!â And then the radiant colors burn and glow, The white east blushes over cheek and brow, And glorious on the hills the Morning stands, Her saffron hair back-blown from rosy bands, And light and joy and fragrance in her hands. Her foot has touched the hill-tops, and they shine; She comes,âthe willow rustles and the pine; She smiles upon the fields a smile divine, And all the earth smiles back; from mount to vale, From oak to shuddering grass, from glen to dale, Wet fields and flowers and glistening brooks cry âHail!â IN MEMORIAM. O friend who passed away while flowers died, Now that the land bursts into bloom again, With vivid blossoms o'er the landscape wide, Purple and white 'mongst grasses golden-eyed, In beauteous resurrection o'er the plain,â My thoughts revert to thee, who liest still, Under the pulsing, stirring, glowing earth; Not rising with the lilac on the hill, Not waking with the sunny daffodil, Living and breathing with no second birth. In these sweet days I dream I see thy grave, A mockery of death, alive with flowers. The delicate sprays and tender grasses wave, Blue violets and the hardy crocus brave, Wooed back to life by sunshine, dew, and showers. I cannot deem that thou art lying there, Asleep through all these fervent days of spring; For I perceive thy spirit in the air, Around me ever in my dream and prayer, Enskied and hallowed by thy suffering. When thou didst walk upon the earth before, My trivial words and deeds alone were thine; But now my holiest dreams are evermore Blended with thoughts of thee, on that far shore, Where thy pale, girlish face has grown divine. Through the dark shadows thou must go alone; And lo! thou hast a dauntless bravery, A most majestic resignation shown; A valiant patience, a faith not overthrown By the dread terror of uncertainty. The day had fled, from thee for evermore, Thy soul was ebbing with the waning light, And still thou asked, aweary and heartsore, The same pathetic question o'er and o'er,â âO, I am tired! will I go to-night?â Aye, thou didst go,âand where? Thou knowest now. Nature is innocent as well as fair; Lilies, as well as amaranth, wreathe her brow. She hath thy soul; because I cannot know Where it may be, I feel it everywhere. And thus the spring hath brought me flowers of worth. O mourners, cease to weep o'er empty graves! Open them all! no dead come trooping forth, To fill with ghastly hosts the living earth; Only the flowers bloom, the green grass waves. Those ye laid low with solemn rites and tears, Elude you; while ye weep, they all have flown. And so I lay aside my doubts and fears; My friend in day-dreams and at night appears, And hovers near when I am most alone. REALITY. âHold fast to your most indefinite waking dream. Dreams are the solidest facts that we know.ââ Henry D. Thoreau. Celestial hopes and dreams, And lofty purposes, and long rich days, With fragrance filled of blameless deeds and ways, And visionary gleams,â These things alone endure; âThey are the solid facts,â that we may grasp, Leading us on and upward if we clasp And hold them firm and sure. In a wise fable old, A hero sought a god who could at will Assume all figures, and the hero still Loosed not his steadfast hold, For image foul or fair, For soft-eyed nymph, who wept with pain and shame, For threatening fiend or loathsome beast or flame, For menace or for prayer. Until the god, outbraved, Took his own shape divine; not wrathfully, But wondering, to the hero gave reply, The knowledge that he craved. We seize the god in youth; All forms conspire to make us loose our grasp,â Ambition, folly, gain,âtill we unclasp From the embrace of truth. We grow more wise, we say, And work for worldly ends and mock our dream. Alas! while all life's glory and its gleam, With that have fled away. If thereto we had clung Through change and peril, fire and night and storm, Till it assumed its proper, godlike form, We might at last have wrung An answer to our cries,â A brave response to our most valiant hope. Unto the light of day this word might ope A million mysteries. O'er each man's brow I see The bright star of his genius shining clear; It seeks to guide him to a nobler sphere, Above earth's vanity. Up to pure height of snow, Its beckoning ray still leads him on and on; To those who follow, lo, itself comes down And crowns at length their brow. The nimbus still doth gleam On these the heroes, sages of the earth, The few who found, in life of any worth, Only their loftiest dream. May, 1869. EXULTATION. Behold, I walked abroad at early morning, The fields of June were bathed in dew and lustre. The hills were clad with light as with a garment. The inexpressible auroral freshness, The grave, immutable, aerial heavens, The transient clouds above the quiet landscape, The heavy odor of the passionate lilacs, That hedged the road with sober-colored clusters, All these o'ermastered me with subtle power, And made my rural walk a royal progress, Peopled my solitude with airy spirits, Who hovered over me with joyous singing. âBehold!â they sang, âthe glory of the morning. Through every vein does not the summer tingle, With vague desire and flush of expectation? âTo think how fair is life! set round with grandeur; The eloquent sea beneath the voiceless heavens, The shifting shows of every bounteous season; âRich skies, fantastic clouds, and herby meadows, Gray rivers, prairies spread with regal flowers, Grasses and grains and herds of browsing cattle: âGreat cities filled with breathing men and women, Of whom the basest have their aspirations, High impulses of courage or affection. âAnd on this brave earth still those finer spirits, Heroic Valor, admirable Friendship, And Love itself, a very god among you. âAll these for thee, and thou evoked from nothing, Born from blank darkness to this blaze of beauty, Where is thy faith, and where are thy thanksgivings?â The world is his who can behold it rightly, Who hears the harmonies of unseen angels Above the senseless outcry of the hour. SONNET. Still northward is the central mount of Maine, From whose high crown the rugged forests seem Like shaven lawns, and lakes with frequent gleam, âLike broken mirrors,â flash back light again. Eastward the sea, with its majestic plain, Endless, of radiant, restless blue, superb With might and music, whether storms perturb Its reckless waves, or halcyon winds that reign, Make it serene as wisdom. Storied Spain Is the next coast, and yet we may not sigh For lands beyond the inexorable main; Our noble scenes have yet no history. All subtler charms than those that feed the eye, Our lives must give them; 'tis an aim austere, But opes new vistas, and a pathway clear. IDYL. The swallows made twitter incessant, The thrushes were wild with their mirth. The ways and the woods were made pleasant, And the flowering nooks of the earth. And the sunshine sufficed to rejoice me, And the air was as bracing as wine, And the sky and the shadows and grasses Were enough to make living divine. Then I saw on the ground two gray robins, One with glorious flame-colored vest, 'Neath the shade of some delicate bluebells, By the breeze of the morning caressed. They were singing of love in the shadow; She was bashful, and modest, and coy, And he sang to her tenderest love-songs, And madrigals full of his joy. And his song came forth clearer and clearer, With each passionate, musical note; Like the ripple of silvery waters, It gushed from his beautiful throat. His whole little bird-soul he offers,â Ah! she listens to him as he sings: Then he ceases, awaiting her answer, With bright eyes and with quivering wings. And I, too, stood awaiting it, breathless, For his song was too sweet to disdain, Till it came, little notes full of gladness, With a plaintive and tender refrain. And the songs died away in the distance, And the forest alone heard the rest, As the two little lovers flew upward, To build them together a nest. 1868. THE DAY OF DEAD SOLDIERS. May 30, 1869. Welcome, thou gray and fragrant Sabbath-day, To deathless love and valor dedicate! Glorious with the richest flowers of May, With early roses, lingering lilacs late, With vivid green of grass and leaf and spray, Thou bringest memories that far outweigh The season's joy with thoughts of death and fate. What words may paint the picture on the air Of this broad land to-day from sea to sea? The rolling prairies, purple valleys rare, And royal mountains, endless rivers free, Filled full with phantoms flitting everywhere, Pale ghosts of buried armies, slowly there From countless graves uprising silently. A calm, grave day,âthe sunlight does not shine, But thin, gray clouds bedrape the sky o'erhead. The delicate air is filled with spirits fine, The temperate breezes whisper of the dead. What visions and what memories divine, O holy Sabbath flower-day, are thine, Painted in light against a field of red! Behold the fairest spots in all the land, To-day in this mid-season of fresh flowers, Are heroes' graves,âby many a tender hand Sprinkled with odorous, radiant-colored showers; By mild, moist breezes delicately fanned, Sending o'er distant towns their perfumes bland, Loading with sweet aroma sunless hours. Who knows what tremulous, dusky hands set free. Deck quaintly with gay flowers the graves unknown? What wealth of bloom is shed exuberantly, On the far grave in Illinois alone, Where the last hero, sleeping peacefully, Beyond detraction and mistrust, doth lie, By the glad winds of prairies overblown? With hymns and prayer be this day sanctified, And consecrate to heroes' memories; Not with wild, violent grief for those who died, O wives and mothers, but with patience wise, Calm resignation, and a thankful pride, That they have left their land a fame so wide, So rich a page of thrilling histories.</field>
