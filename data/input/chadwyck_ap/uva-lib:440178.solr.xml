      <field name="fulltext">IN THE ANTECHAMBER OF MONSIGNORE DEL FIOCCO. Our master will be Cardinal ere longâ Is he not made for one?âso smooth and plump, With those broad jaws, those half-shut peeping eyes, Those ankle-heavy legs and knotty feet, Which only need red stockings. Even now He totters round with the true Cardinal's gait Upon his tender toes, while you behind Demurely follow, scarce an ear-shot off, The pious footsteps of the holy man. How many years have you thus stalked along Behind that broad-brimmed, purple-tasselled hat, In your stiff lace and livery, trained to pause Whene'er he pauses, turning half to fix His Fifthly on his fingers to some dull Cringing Abbate shuffling at his side? Then, when that point is drilled into his brain (Proving the blessedness of poverty, Or how the devil has no cursed wiles To lure the world to hell like libertyâ The only one great good being obedience), Back go the hands beneath the creased black silk That streams behind, and on you march again; While the gilt carriage lumbers in the rear, And the black stallions nod their tufted crests. Yours is a noble station, clinging there Behind it as you clatter through the town, Your white calves shaking with the pavement's jar, The mark and sneer of half the world you meet. Ah, well! 'tis wretched business yours and mine; I know not which is worstâbut then it pays; The cards are dirty, but what matters dirt To those who win? Though now the stakes are small, We'll hold the court-cards when the suit is red;â And so it will be soon; why, even now I seem to see red stockings on his legs;â And yesterday I said, âYour Eminence,â As if I thought he now was Cardinalâ âYour Eminence,â indeed! At that he smiled That oily smile of his, and rubbed his handsâ Those thick fat hands, on which his emerald ring Flashes ('tis worth at least a thousand crowns)â And said, âGood Giacomo, not âEminence,â I'm but a Monsignor, and that's too much For my deserts.â Then I, âYour âReverenceâ Ought to be âEminence,â and will be soon; The tassel's almost old upon your hat.â âSei matto, Giacomo,â he said, and smiled. You know those smiles, that glitter falsely o'er His smooth broad cheeks, as if he asked of you, âAm I not kind and good?â and all the while Your soul protests, and calls out âKnave and cheat.â But, then, how can one call him by such names, When, even with that smile upon his face, He slips a scudo in one's hand and says, âGo, Giacomo, and drink my health with thisâ? What can one do but bow and try to blush? âOhâEminenzaâthanksâyou are too good.â Dear man! sweet man! in all those troublous times What zeal was his!âhow earnestly he worked! Who can forget his pure self-sacrifice, His virtuous deeds, above this world's rewardâ Done for pure Christian dutyâdone, of course, For Holy Churchâall was for Holy Churchâ (Without a notion of this world's reward)â All for the good of souls and Holy Churchâ (Ora pro nobis, and that sort of thing)â All to bring sinners back again to God, And from the harvest root the devil's taresâ In omnia sÃ¦culaâamenâamen. We don't forgetâwell! you know whom I mean No need to mention names, though no one's nigh; We don't forget him whose anointed hands Were flayed by order of his Reverence, Ere with his bleeding palms they led him down Into the court-yard, and we, peeping through The half-closed blind, saw him throw up his hands And forward fall upon his face, and writhe, When the sharp volley rang against the walls. Those oily fingers wrote that sentence down! That thick voice, with a hypocritic tone, While both his palms were raised, decreed that doom. Who could help weeping when that pious man, Professing horror at his victim's crime, And bidding him confess and pray to God, And saying, âGod would pardon him, perhaps, As he himself would, if the power were his, But, being the instrument of Church and State, No choice was given,â with his priestly foot Pushed, you know whom, into a felon's grave? That bloody stain is still upon the walls, Of the same colour as the scarlet hat Our master soon will wear; and, after all, Who more deserves it? If he stained his soul, Is not the labourer worthy of his hire? He shall be raised who doth abase himself! The good and faithful servant shall be made The ruler over many! Ah! my friend, He nothing lost by all those deeds of his. He erred in zeal, but zeal is not a viceâ 'Twas all for Holy Church. His secret life, Perhaps, was not quite perfect! Who of you Is without sin let him first cast a stone;â No one, you see; so let us think no more Of that. Does any Duchess smile the less At all his compliments and unctuous words As, leaning o'er her chair, his downcast eyes He fixes somewhat lower than her lips,â Upon the jewels on her neck, perchance, He is so modest,âand with undertone Whispers, and, deprecating, lifts his hands, While with her fan she covers half her face? He knows as well as any man that lives How far to venture;âcovers his foul jokes With honeyed words, so ladies swallow them;â Treads on the edge of scandalânot a chance He will fall in; knows all the secret shoals Of innuendo;âin pure earnestness (Oh, nothing more) he seizes their soft hands And holds themâpresses them, as to enforce His argument;âfor this, our Monsignor, Lifted above temptation, with, of course, No carnal thought, may do before the worldâ Because it must be done through innocence. Fie on his foul mouth who should hint 'twas wrong! Who'd be more shock'd than he, the pious man? He would go home and pray for that lost soul! And yet, how can a woman pure in heart, Without disgust, accept his compliments, And let him feed on her his gloating eyes? Of course, it's just because she's innocent. Yes! I am lean and dry, a servitor, Not fat and oily like our Monsignor, And so I can't endure his nauseous ways;â All right, of course! But yet I sometimes think, Did San Pietro talk to Martha thus, And every night, wearing his fisherman's ring, Show like silk-stocking'd legs in soft saloons, And fish for women with a net like this? Those soft fat handsâthose sweet anointed handsâ Those hands that wear the glittering emerald ringâ Those hands whose palms are pressed so oft in prayerâ Those hands that fondle high-born ladies' handsâ Those hands that give their blessing to the poorâ Those hateful, hideous hands are red with blood! Think! Principessa, when you kiss those handsâ Think! Novice, when those hands upon your head Are laid in consecrationâthink of this! Stop, Master Giacomo! don't get too warm! When Monsignore gave you yesterday, With those same hateful, hideous, bloody hands, Your scudo, did you take it, sir, or not? Yes! I confess! the world will be the world! One must not ask too much of mortal man, Nor mortal woman neither, Giacomo! But yet we cannot always keep a curb Upon our feelings, school them as we will; And I, who bow and cringe and smile all day, Detest at times my very self, and grow So restive 'neath my rank hypocrisy, I must break loose and fling out like a horse In useless kicks, or else I should go mad. God knows I hate this man, and so at times, Rather than take him by the throat, I come And pour my passion out in idle words; They ease me. You're my friend; but if I thought A word of this would reach his ears; but, no! We know each other both too well for that. One or two questions I should like to ask, If Monsignor would only answer them, As thisâwhat Sora Lisa says to him At her confession, once a-week at least (For Monsignor, having her soul in charge, When she don't come to him, must go to her). She used to be so poor, but times are changed, And Sora Lisa keeps her carriage now; And those old gowns, by some âHey, presto, change,â Have turned to rustling silks; and at her ears Diamonds and rubies dangle, which she shows, When she's the mind, in her own opera box. Well! well! that office our good Monsignor Gave her poor husband from pure love of him May pay for these; and if it don't, why, then, It don'tâwhat business is it of ours? And then, who knows, some uncle may have died (Uncles are always dying for such folks) And made her rich;âwhy should we peep and pry? Her soul is safe at least with Monsignor. And this reminds meâdid you ever know Nina, that tall, majestic, fierce-eyed girl, With blue-black hair, which, when she loosed it, shook Its crimpled darkness almost to the floor?â She that was friend to Monsignor while yet He was a humble AbbÃ©âborn indeed In the same town and came to live in Rome? Not know her? She, I mean, who disappeared Some ten years back, and God knows how or why? Well, Nina,âare you sure there's no one near?â Ninaâ Per Dio! how his stinging bell Startled my blood, as if the Monsignor Cried out, âYou, Giacomo; what, there again At your old trick of talking? Hold your tongue!â And so I will, per Bacco, so I will;â Who tells no secrets breaks no confidence. Nature, as Monsignor has often said, Gave us two eyes, two ears, and but one tongue, As if to say, âTell half you see and hear;â And I'm an ass to let my tongue run on, After such lessons. There he rings again! Vengoâper DioâVengo subito. TO FORTUNE. Oh Goddess! fixed and fair and calm, That bearest in thy grasp the palmâ That bearest in thy grasp the rodâ Oh voice of Fate! oh smile of God!â Be graciousâlend to us thy earâ Be not too awful, too austere. Against thy will no power avails; Without thy aid all struggle fails. Stayed by thy hand, no reed so spare But, column-like, life's weight will bear; Reft of thy hand our steps to lead, The brazen shaft is like a reed. Blow but thy breath across the sea, Our galleys go triumphantly; Avert thy face, though skies are fair We sink and founder in despair. Dear Goddess, turn to us thy face! Not justice we implore, but grace; Give us what none can win or buyâ Thy godlike gift, prosperity. THE LILAC. The lilac-bush is in blossom, It hath the balmy smell Of that dear delicious summer, Of love's first miracle. I feel, as I breathe its fragrance, The old enchanting pain, The sweet insatiate longing, Thrill through my heart and brain. Oh youth! youth! youth! where are you? I call, but you come no more! I weep, but afar you mock me! And you laugh when I implore! Yet you hide within the lilac, With an odour you shoot me through, And a whiff of the old you fling me That is better than all the new. How proudly we struggled to leave you, When you implored us to stay! How bitterly grieve to regain you When once you have fled away. Too late, too late, we love you, And long for your laugh of surprise, And we only truly can see you With manhood's tears in our eyes. You flung your arms around me And pelted me with flowers; You clung to me as we wandered Among those lilac bowers. You kissed me, half laughing, half crying, Beseeching me to remain, But impatient I shook you from meâ And you never will come again. Your lilacs are ever blooming In happy gardens of play, But they love you not who have you, And fain would they flee away. They long for the fields of freedom Where the fruit of ambition grows, And for manhood's heights, that are lifted Against a sky of rose. THE GAUCHO. Over the lonely, desolate Pampas, A sinewy horse my flying throne, Coiled at my saddle-bow the lasso, In my belt a knife that reaches the bone. I am the Gaucho,âriding, hiding, Whirling the bolas, wielding the knife, Over the prairies of Buenos Ayres, Let him who would take me look out for his life! Ne'er a tide but the fleeting seasons Sweeps o'er the inland sea of grass; Roaring herds, like clouds of thunder, Over its lonely levels pass. Jaguars yell; and, striding, hiding, Ostriches rushâfor they fear the knifeâ Over the prairies of Buenos Ayres, Let him who pursues me look out for his life! With my tongues of cows and gourd of yerba, And the cigaritos smoke on my hearth, I laugh at your houses; my saddle 's my pillow, My chamber a thousand miles of earth. With the stars above me gliding, hiding, I lie at ease, as I grasp my knife. On the wide prairies of Buenos Ayres, Let him who awakes me look out for his life! Look! in the distance a cloud is rising; In with the spur! fling loose the rein! Sharp sings the lasso's loop as it whizzes,â And the bellowing bull drops on the plain. Out from my saddle sliding, gliding, Deep in his throat my flashing knife. O'er the wide prairies of Buenos Ayres, Let him who pursues me look out for his life! Keep your dragoons at homeâI warn you! For the Gaucho writes his laws in blood; The bolas are ready; coiled is the lasso; And this white dust can be red mud. You for the crows, and, riding, riding, I for the Andes with my knife. Over the prairies of Buenos Ayres, Let him who would take me look out for his life! CASTEL GANDOLFO. [Dedicated to L. C.] The fountain on the moonlight plays, And old Castello's turrets rise Darkly against the silvery skies, And voices laugh along the ways. The moonlight sleeps upon the square; And from the castellated town The sharp dark blocks of shadow thrown Lie cut out in the whiteness there. Among the trees the luccioli Show fitfully their wandering light, And far away across the night The owl prolongs his dreary cry. How still! how exquisitely still! No sound disturbs the silentness Save the untiring cricket's stress, And the continuous fountain's spill. The weeds along the old grey wall Hang moveless, casting spots of shade; And all is beautified, and made More perfect where the moonbeams fall. What magic light that thus can hide The ravages of time, and grace The commonest and meanest place, And veil the earth as 'twere a bride! On such a night Diana kissed Endymion's brow the while he slept, As noiselessly to him she crept Enshrouded in a silver mist. Oh! pass not, perfect night, from us, But stay with us and crown our love! Sing, from the shadowy ilex groveâ Sing, nightingale, for ever thus! WOGGINS. Singing little artless snatches, Words and music all her own, While her dolls she tends and dresses, By herself, but not alone, Round from room to room she wanders, Through the hall, and up the stairs, And her sunny buoyant spirit Knows but trivial shades and cares. Now upon the stair she's singing; Now, in corners of the rooms, Self-involved, her little household Patronising she assumes. What a teeming world of fiction Out of nothing she creates! Fancy, childhood's gentle fairy, With her wand upon her waits. Little scraps of worthless paper, Scribbled o'er with crooked lines, She interprets into landscapes Where an endless sunlight shines. Conversations wise and serious With her painted dolls she holds; And the good ones she caresses, And the naughty ones she scolds. Now she brings her book of pictures, And with large and wondering eyes, On my knee she sits and listens With a smile of young surprise, While I tell the same old stories I have told her o'er and o'er Scores of times, yet when I finish, With a shout she cries, âTell more!â Knowledge, that the mind encumbers, Cares, that after-years harass, Are to her but misty sun-showers, Rainbow traps that come and pass. All the world is as a playthingâ When it wearies, thrown away, As from new to new she ranges In the imagination's play. Wisdom such as thine I covet, Happy childhood! Work and toil, Plans that never reach enjoyment, But the present's beauty spoil, Are not made for thee; contented With the present, from each day But its juice of joy thou pressest, Fling'st the bitter rind away. Not till man through toil and labour Onward pass to joyous ease, Not till knowing rhyme with loving, Nature will give up its keys. All is shut to poet, artist, Till he be a child again; And in play shall be created What was never born of pain. UNDER THE CYPRESSES. Here I stand in the cypress lane; I see the light in her window shine; Ah, God! can this love be all in vain, And shall she never be mine? There stays her shadow against the walls; There moves on the ceiling to and fro: She does not think of the heart that calls So loud in the dark below. Why should she think of a fool like me, Though I'd give my life to save her a pain? The stars might as well look down to see The fire-flies in the lane. I am too low for her to love; And I would not give her the pain to say That a love like mine could only prove A shadow upon her way. So I stand in the cypress shade and weepâ I weep, for my heart is sick with love; And I pray for strength my vow to keep, As I gaze on the sky above. Is it wrong to gaze at her window-sill, Where she sits like an angel in a shrine, While my heart cries out, despite my will, âAh, heaven! were she but mine?â Heart of mine, I could tear you out! Am I so weak and faint of will That the fair dear serpent coiled about My purpose I cannot kill? Where is my vaunted manhood fled? Come, my prideâmy pride, come back! Serve me and prompt me a while, instead Of all I so sadly lack! Vain! ah, vain! all day and night One thought, like a ghost, I cannot lay, Ranges my life and haunts my sight, And never will pass away. It mocks me and beckons at my work, It lures me away from joy and ease; Where shall I flee that it does not lurk, This shadow no hand can seize? Give me something to meet and grasp! I faint with fighting this thing of air! I die despairing in its clasp! Its presence I cannot bear! Oh, give me strength, my God, to endure! Let me not writhe to death in the grass! Send me, ye stars, from your chambers pure, Some ease, as ye coldly pass! Look at this poor mad wretch that lies Beating his brain that is all afire! Pity him here as he grovelling dies In the flames of his vain desire! UNDER A CLOUD. Ah me! I'm so ill and weary, I wish I could only die! For here all alone and dreary, As hour after hour I lie, I think it all over and over, And see no issue of peace; No way the lost joy to recover, If death do not give me release. I know not what change may come after, But that I take upon trust; Perhaps no more weeping nor laughterâ Only a handful of dust. Perhaps a glory and gladness We never have dreamt of here, Where love has no shadow of sadness, And joy has no shudder of fear. At least I shall no more sorrow, And suffer such helpless pain, With no hope for the coming morrow, No hope to behold him again. And that terrible longing and craving Again in his arms to be, Will cease in my heart to be raving And tearing me inwardly. But then, perhaps, I shall lose himâ And here, if I strive and stay, Since God is so good, if one sues Him, Perhaps he will open a wayâ Some way through this tangle of anguish To a joy beyond our sight, Nor leave as to linger and languish, Like creatures lost in the night. Here, as I lie, I go over The dear departed days, When my love I began to discover, Till my thoughts are all in a craze; And the vines on the sunny terrace, Through the windows again I see; And the room with the quaint old arras, Where he whispered his love to me. But what is the use of thinking? 'Tis all like a sleepless pain, That keeps tramping, tramping, and clinking In the treadmill of my brain. 'Tis like hearing the music for ever Going on to the dancers' tread, While I'm fainting and dying with fever, And helpless to lift my head. I am getting so old with fretting, Perhaps he will love me no more; And I sometimes fear his forgetting And this makes my heart so sore. And before the stone that is lying Across my path is removed, Who knows but that he may be dying, To make it vain that we loved. Oh Nannie, you soon will be strewing The flowers on the bed where I lie! Last week I thought I was going! But oh, 'tis so hard to die! Life beat in my bosom so slowly, Though a fever was in my brainâ And everything went from me wholly, Save a numb, dull sense of pain. In body and mind I seemed doubled; And one was so tired and weak, And the other was dead and untroubledâ Too dead to feel or to speak. And the tired body kept praying, âMake me, too, cold and numb.â âLet me sleep, let me sleep,â it kept sayingâ But sleep would never come. Oh God! that it all were over, For life is not worth its cost; And I know I can never recover The joy and the peace that are lost. Death only can break the fetter, Death only can set things straight; And death, after all, is better Than a lifelong struggle with fate. Tell George he must try and forgive me, For my struggle, though vain, was sore; And beg him in quiet to leave me, And scold and reproach me no more. I was weakâbut 'tis useless to chide me, Let him leave me alone to God; And bury my sins beside me, When he lays me under the sod. THE SHADY LANE. I waited for him in the shady lane, For I knew he would pass there late at night; And that leaf-strewn wood I swore to stain With his blood or mine, for I hated his sight. There I waited and listened alone, With a tumult of rage in my heart and brain; And I swore to myself the deed should be done To-night, as he passed the lane. Was I not right? He had stolen her heartâ My heart, that more than my life was dear; Had poisoned her mind with his treacherous art, And his vile love breathed in her ear. He, the contemptible trivial fool, With never a scruple or doubt or fear Of his exquisite selfâto make her the tool Of his flatteries insincere! Why did she blush as she heard him speak, Flushing all over as red as a rose When he touched her hand? and tremble, as weak As a reed when a light wind blows. What was there, I say, in that empty face, In that empty head, and emptier heart, That gave him the power her name to disgrace, And my darling from me to part? I knew his step, as gaily he came, Swinging his stick as he strode alongâ Hate lightened along my nerves like flame, I was mad to hear him singing that song. Before him I leaped with a single bound, Face to face in the pale moonlightâ âNo words,â I cried; âblows, blows, you hound; One of us two must die to-night.â Aghast he stood, but not with fear, Most with the suddenness of the thingâ As one when the sky is bright and clear Starts at the lightning's sudden sting. âYou!â he cried. âBack; let me pass! Back, I say; are you drunk or mad?â âBoth,â I cried. âYou have ruined the lass; And your blood shall answer, my lad.â We fought together there in the shade, As a madman and his keeper fight; He for his life, that love had made So sweet, and I for his death, that night. That love!âa fire was in my brain, The strength of a fiend was in my hand, And at last he dropped in the shady lane, And his blood oozed out on the sand. âMy life! don't murder me,â he said, As I clenched him thereâwhen suddenly The struggling body lay heavy and dead, And I felt above me the moon's great eye. There, alone, where a moment before Two were struggling, was only one! âThank God!â I cried, âhe will love no more, And deceive no moreâ'tis done!â The hate that had blazed so fierce calmed down Slowly, until of its raging glow Only the ashes were left. The frown Cleared away from my knotted brow. In the trough of my passion's swell I lay, And a sickening calm across me crept, As the satiate passions slank away Drunk with revenge, and slept. The deed was done! but an ugly fear Came over me now to touch this thing. There was nothing to struggle against me here In this lifeless heap; I wished it would spring And grasp me, and strike at me as it did Only a moment or two before. I lifted the head, but it dropped and slid From my grasp to its bed of gore. Coward! 'tis but a carcass that's dead! Lift it; drag it along the wood! No one is lookingâcarefully spread Dry leaves over the stains of blood! Hark!âah! 'tis but the rustling leaves, As the freshening night-wind lifts and dies; 'Tis but the wind that sighs and grievesâ No eye sees but the starry eyes! What will you do with this horrible thing? Down! and grub a grave in the ground! Grub with your nails! If you choose, you may sing That song of his. Don't start and look round! 'Tis but a corpse you are burying nowâ Surely that is a Christian deedâ How she would thank you!âclear your browâ What else do you ask or need? Dig!âhow terribly slow you are! The dawn in the east begins to grow; The birds are all chirpingâbury there That body at once, and for God's sake go! The world will be up in less than an hour, And rattle and ring along the roadâ Dig for your life!âah, well! that's o'er! And he lies in his last abode. Speed o'er the country, slink to your room, Happy at last that the deed is done! Why do you look so?âsurely the gloom That clouded so long your life has gone! Why do you shrink from the open street? Why should you hide from the gaze of men? Go! tell her your night's work when you meet, And surely she'll kiss you and love you then. OPHELIA. The rising wind o'er wold and hill Blows dreary, leadening all the lake; And all the whitened willows shake, And twilight closes blear and chill. The mist hangs thickening o'er the sea, A spectral light is in the sky, And all the branches creak and sigh, And my heart sighs with them drearily. Oh where is love that once was mine? Speak, oh my heart, and tell me where! Tell me, oh wind! whose wild despair Is wrestling with the straining pine! I rock its corpse so cold and pale, I braid its hair and kiss its eyes, And deck it with sweet memories; Yet what can tears and moans avail? Oh call it back to life again, With all its tones of youth and spring; Or break at once the throbbing string That jars so wildly in my brain. The past is past,âwith sullen moan, Oh dreary wind, I hear you cry! And all the struggling trees reply, Alone, alone, alone, alone. THE RIVER OF TIME. Oh! the river that runs for ever, The rapid river of time! The silent river, that pauses never, Nor ceases its solemn rhyme! How swift by the flowery banks it rushes, Where love and joy are at play, And stretch out their hands with laughter and blushes, And beg it in vain to stay! How slow through the sullen marsh of sorrow It creeps with a lingering pain; When night comes down and we long for the morrow. And longing is all in vain! O'er sparkling shoals of glittering folly, O'er deeps of dreadful crime, O'er gladness and madness and melancholy, Through fears and hopes sublime, Ruthlessly on in waking or sleeping, Unheeding our wish or will, Through loving and laughing, and wailing and weeping, It bears us for good or illâ Bears us down with a fearful motion, In a current no eye can see, Down to the vast mysterious ocean We call eternity. RENUNCIATION. Oh no! you shall not catch me in the snareâ I will not love, I say! Life might become a terror, a despair, If you were ta'en away. Nothing is given here, 'tis only lent,â I will not, dare not, trust: For joy might strike at once his heaven-built tent, And leave me but its dust. What horror, after all my life was given, Adventured in one bark, If that should go, even to the joy of heaven, And I left in the dark! Left on a wreck of sorrow, with no power My losses to repair; With death denied, and every torturing hour By memory made a snare. Left with the dregs of life, its wine poured out; Left to the past a prey; From its sad ghosts that haunt my heart about, Helpless to flee away. No! I renounce life's blissâlove's perfect flower, Sweet though it be!âI choose The lower, lasting lot, and keep the power, Without a pang, to lose. NIGHT-WATCH. [Dedicated to F. O. S.] Night the mysterious, silent, solemn night, Broods over all! Time, sweeping onward to the infinite, No sound lets fall. We hear alone its heavy lifting breath Of deep repose, As turning slowly in its dream of death The great earth goes. Above, below, is silence! In the deep Of the vast sky, In the low hollows where the white mists heap And shroud-like lie, On the far plains where ghostlike in the shade Dim olives dwell, O'er slumbering city, forest, sea, is laid Night's secret spell. Tranced in the silence of this mystery, And awe intense Of all that is, and was, and is to be, Weighs on the sense; And shapeless thoughts and disembodied dreams That end in sighs, Sad memories, longings vague, and vanished schemes, Before me rise. Cease, ye wild thoughts! In duty's narrow bound Alone is peace! Oh infinite sea! that plummet cannot sound, In thy abyss Of wild conjecture we but sink and drown. The awful breath That blows from out the future bears us down To fear,âto death. IN THE SHADOW. And can it be that all is o'erâ That I shall never see you more? Or is it but a dream of night, That soon will pass with morning's light? Oh! is the joy I used to own So lost, beyond the power to save; And can it be that you are gone, And in the grave? Not young, perhaps, as others see, Yet ever young you seemed to me; The same sweet smile and tender art Remained, that first beguiled my heart; The same dear look and gentle tone That ever its fresh welcome gaveâ And can it be that you are gone, And in the grave? Some silver lines were in your hair, But yet I never saw them there: The years went on to you and me So gently and so evenly, That scarce it seemed a week had flown Since first to me your love you gaveâ And can it be that you are gone, And in the grave? Something I miss at every turnâ Something for which I blankly yearn; And still some question to decide I turn as you were at my sideâ I turn and thinkâah! she alone Will give the counsel that I crave! And then I feel that you are gone, And in the grave! Henceforth, I know, at close of day, When I return the old, old way, The voice that greeted me before, Soon as my hand was on the door, No more will greet me with the tone Of gentle welcome once it gaveâ For oh! I feel that you are gone, And in the grave. Others such grief as mine have borne, And I, like them, shall live and mourn,â It nought avails to grieve or sigh For what has gone so utterly! And yet, how can I help to moan For what no love had power to saveâ For oh! I feel that you are gone, And in the grave. Courage! the heavy hand of Fate Has laid on me its cruel weight, And all these coming years of care And sorrow I alone must bear; Yes! I must strive to bear alone, Without the help that once you gave; For you, my love, my joy, are gone, And in the grave. ON THE SEA-SHORE. The sky is grey, with lowering clouds of lead, And scarce a break of blue, Here pencilled down with rain, and overhead With silver gleams shot through. Upon the rocky shore I sit alone; The dark-green sullen sea, Along the shore makes a perpetual moan, And struggles restlessly. Noiseless as pictures, on their wings of white The distant vessels glide By purple islands veiled in dreamy light, That silent there abide. Across the purple shoals of sunken rocks The toppling racers break, And suck, and roar, and beat with ceaseless shocks The worn cliff's weedy base. Heaved by the lifting swell, the long green flag Of sea-weed floats and falls, And down their shelf the raking pebbles drag, As back the surf-wave crawls. I sit as in a dream, and hear, and see, With senses lulled away, And what the ocean says or sings to me I strive in vain to say. Something there is beneath that constant moan That utterance seeks in vain; Like some dim memory, some hidden tone, That, helpless, haunts the brain. But all my thoughts, like sea-weed, swing and sway, The sport of fantasy; And visions pass before me far away, Like vessels out at sea,â Pass through my mind with an ideal freight, And softly move alongâ A sweet procession, without care or weight, Like disembodied song. BLANK QUESTIONINGS. What is this vague, dim world before, We vainly struggle to explore With outstretched wishes, hopes, and thoughts, That fail before they reach the shore? What is this startling, sudden change, That in a moment from the range Of every sense takes life away To regions dim and strange? Dear friend! my earnest following thought Thy track into that world hath sought In vain; no word nor silent sign Of what, and where thou art, is brought. And yet I seem to feel that thou Beholdest me more nearly now, And all my soul, like some clear book, Readest, I see not how. And knowing, now that life has fled, Thou, silent and unseen, may'st thread The dim, still chambers of my soulâ I feel, as with a holy dread, How full of love it ought to be, How pure of thought, how clean and free From any stain and soil of sense, Which thy dear eyes could see. Come, then, when I am sad and low, And through those chambers softly blow The fragrance of thy love around, And seeds of purer purpose sow. Come! find the secret memories That are not seen of human eyesâ The thoughts, the hopes, the dreams, that dwell In inmost privacies. And if thou findest, entering there, Some nooks that are not wholly bare Of love, forgive them for that love, The evil and unfair. ALPINE SONG. With alpenstock and knapsack light I wander o'er hill and valley, I climb the snow-peak's flashing height And sleep in the sheltered chalet,â Free in heartâhappy and freeâ This is the summer life for me. The city's dust I leave behind For the keen, sweet air of the mountain, The grassy path by the wild rose lined, The gush of the living fountain,â Free in heartâhappy and freeâ This is the summer life for me. High above me snow-clouds rise In the early morning gleaming; And the patterned valley beneath me lies Softly in sunshine dreaming,â Free in heartâhappy and freeâ This is the summer life for me. The bells of wandering herds I list Chiming in upland meadows; How sweet they sound, as I lie at rest Under the dark pine shadows!â Glad in heartâhappy and freeâ This is the summer life for me. The thundering lawine's roar I hear, And the torrent's foamy bounding; And the steep crag's answer sweet and clear, When the alpine horn is sounding,â Glad in heartâhappy and free, This is the summer life for me. A good stout alpenstock in hand, A flask from my shoulder swinging, And a rose in my hat, o'er the Oberland I wander for ever singing,â Glad in heartâhappy and free, This is the summer life for me. BLUE BEARD'S CABINETS. [Dedicated to E. B. H.] Women are curious, one and all, we know,â Eve was, and so is every woman since. All other virtues unto you are given Except to close your eyes and curb your tongue. Nor should I dare, dear Fatima, to you, Best of your sex, to trust this single key, Forbidding you to turn it in the lock;â You pout, say no! and shake your pretty headâ VainlyâI know 'twould never let you rest. Since mother Eve, a thing prohibited Tortures your sex till it is known and tried. Just try you? 'Tis a shame to say such words. What have you ever done? When trust is gone, Love follows soonâand are those really tears? Tears? and we married only two short monthsâ Smile, dearest, once again, and take the key! Take it! there's nothing better in the world Than curiosity. It is the spur Of knowledge. Pray, forgive me, Fatima! Take itâI meant to leave you all the rest, For these two months have slipped so swift away (Joy flies so fast, 'tis only grief that halts) In this our Spanish castle, that in truth I had forgotten all the curious things In the old cabinets;âbut now, constrained To leave you for a week, Annie and you May hunt them through to while the hours away. Here are the keysâeach opes a cabinet Where all of rare my ancestors have found, Whether in travel through the broad domain Of fact, or fancy, or romance, are ranged. Each has its number. Enter! open all! Stay! just to show how false is tongue of man, Let me prohibit one! I will not say What it contains. Thank you for that proud smile! Think you I fear lest you should enter there; No, by my love! You need not promise me. I only say, This opes the door of death Beyond the hall of dreams. You look surprised! Curious, of course, you're not! There is the key! These nine-and-ninety keys ope worlds enough For one short week; and in the hall of death Sooner or later all of us shall look. Meanwhile, the others may suffice you. Stop! Let me point out some curious cabinets That will amuse you most, and mark the keys. This, turned within its wards, will show you gems Of wondrous beauty and strange rarity. Red trees of branching coral, found beneath The Elysian isles, and by the shining scales Of mermaids polished, over-roof the hall; And dragons, gleaming in enamelled mail, With eyes of diamond, in the corners crouch. In frieze of beaten gold, along the wall, Struggle fierce centaurs clasped by LapithÃ¦. And round the pavement whirls a chariot race, With foaming steeds and naked outstretched arms Mosaic'd on a band of marble black. The ceiling's panels are in ivory carved, Each with a lotus or magnolia spread, And all the solid beams are massive gold. Here, round the walls, in ebon cabinets With ivory intarsia storied o'er, And faced with flawless crystal, you may see My stores of curious gems;âclear crystal balls, Concealing in their depths a magic life, Where steal the pale reflections of time's ghosts; Cat eyes, whose iris circles glare and shift; Opals, alive within with quivering fires; Smooth globes of garnets like rich jelly-drops; And mystic onyxes with figures strange Carved on their facets by Egyptian priests; Vases of jasper red and sardonyx, Beryl and topaz, jacinth, amethyst, And orient alabaster; and all stones That sun-struck Africa, of dark and veined, Blood-streaked and solemn, in her caves conceals; The great carbuncle, sought for centuries, Here blazes like a sun; and at its side Note, too, a common stone, a pebble vile, Hung near a pure and perfect chrysolite (Smooth as a mirror, flawless as the sky); It scarce would take your eye, it seems so vile, Yet touched by it the filthiest dross grows gold, And Europe for that stone would sell its soul. Here is the pearl the Egyptian queen dissolved, What time with Anthony in revels wild She toyed and feasted; and beside it lies The royal asp, her bracelet, where she kept Her death, her freedom, in one poison-drop. Pass not the Gracchi jewels, famed so long, Two great cornelians, and beyond all price; Nor the vast diamond Polyphemus wore Fixed to his forehead, called by men his eye. Here hangs a curtain; draw it backâit runs On rings that from the field of CannÃ¦ cameâ Behind it other curious rings you'll findâ Morone's, whence a prisoned devil spoke; Aboukir's, gifted with a lightning sword, Which, when his hand waved, sheared his foeman's head; Joudar's, which owned its black tremendous slave; The Samian's lucky ring he could not lose; And Pyrrhus's, whose figures nature carved; And that which Gyges wore; and Solomon's, Whose mystic stamp sealed in his sunken vase The cloud-vast Afrite 'neath the Arabian lake; There is the ring with which my ancestor Married the Adriaticâone sea-green Aqua marina, jutting forth in points Of starry brilliants; and beside it lies The poison-ring the gold-haired Borgia wore; And that Elizabeth to Essex gave. This iron key, with lines of silver veined, Opens a cabinet more curious yet. Ultramarine the roof, one mighty block, Besprinkled with a thousand golden stars. Panelled in Afric marbles are the walls, All pictured o'er with wild and mystic shapes Of every varying hue,âfrom purpling lakes And crimson carmines unto Stygian black. Two sombre columns carved with stories strange Of Asian magic in the centre standâ The capital's red gold a band of skulls. As the vast door you push, a thunderous sound Of mournful music groans along the vault, And lightnings, flashing, cross their jagged swords. Be undismayed and enter! On the floor A charm is written; in the circle stand And say âGeheimniss!â Music then will rain Soft as a summer shower to soothe the sense, And hands invisible will lead you round. Here you will find the wondrous planisphere Of Abdelsamad, in whose depths were seen All regions of the earthâthat smote with fire The nations at its owner's wrathful nod. Here I have ranged a thousand curious things Found in my travels into distant lands;â Among them is a hydra's snaky head;â And (for I'm curious in hair) you'll find, Bound in a single braid, and closely clasped By a dried Harpy-claw, one Gorgon lock From the Medusa's head, entwined with one Torn from MegÃ¦ra and Tisiphone, And from Alecto oneâwhile in and out A golden tress that on the Borgia's brow Meandered once, slips gleaming here and there. Here are some relics which from over sea The Flying Dutchman brought from classic lands. Among them is Pandora's opened box, The Attic cynic's lantern and his tub, A shrieking branch from the Ãneid grove, Arion's harp and Hermes' wand; the bag Of Eolus, Ulysses' wax, the flute That Orpheus played; a soft half-melted plume Dropped from the waxen wings of Icarus, The sword suspended by a single hair. ... And underneath this last a skull I've placedâ One that was brought to me from Golgotha. Here from the vaguer regions of Romance Are various objects, and beyond all price: Such as the cap which Fortunatus wore, The bowl in which the men of Gotham sailed, The bodkin that Amina used to pick Her grains of rice before her fouler feast,â Agrippa's glass and that of Schemseddin, The King of Thule's goblet, with a tinge Of the red wine that wet his noble beard, Poor Schlemihl's shadow, and the Roc's huge egg, Aladdin's lamp, and Circe's magic cup. Here in one corner of the room you'll find A medley of all sorts of oddities: There's a wise saw, that shows its teeth to fools, An ancient augur (famous as a bore), A modern screw, a rod in pickle kept, A pair of ruined breaches made by Time, And in them tares the enemy hath sown. Here is the crystal luck of Eden hall, In which some flowers of rhetoric are placedâ The snowy plume of Henry of Navarre, With Conachar's white feather at its sideâ Here is a tune that from Munchausen's horn Was taken ere it thawed, and fragments rare Of frozen music sent me by De StaÃ«l,â Being choice bits of fluting round the drum Of Kubla Khan's majestic pleasure domeâ You'll know the spot by looking on the floor, Where I have caused a pattern to be worked In coloured jewels, after a design From the Mosaic dispensation drawnâ While from the ceiling o'er it like a lamp Hangs the lost Pleiad, which the wandering Jew Found on the topmost peak of Ararat. This my menagerie will ope, and here Along the walls are pictured various lands: While columns with alternate ebon bands Winding with ivory spirals stand betweenâ Here Asian deserts, idly vast, outstretch, And black Nigritia scowls, and naked girls Dance in the shade of Abyssinian palmsâ Here shakes the tinkling life of the Chinese 'Neath Altai mountains in Mongolia; While on the other side the slim canoe Through Polynesian waters swiftly glides; And the great banyan darkens down the shore. Along the northern wall the iceberg sails, Toppling and crashing through white fields of ice, Where the bear souses in his Arctic bath. Close by, beneath the Uralian avalanche, Siberia spreads her dark platoons of pines. All lands are hereâall quarters of the earthâ Venetian splendours of her gorgeous daysâ The savage life afar in western wildsâ The babbling glitter of the Boulevardsâ The lonely Kaffir's hutâthe middle sea, With roaring billows plunging all alone. Here range my wondrous animals, and here The great white elephant of Siam walks Beside the magic steed that swam the air, And Pegasus with both his wings tied down. Here is Androcles' lion; at his side ChimÃ¦ra and three-headed Cerberus; And near the dragon with a hundred heads, That watched the Hesperian gardens day and night, Couches the sad Sphinx with her silent face. Strange converse hold they in a wondrous tongue, And many a tale of ancient days they tell, Or Orpheus, Hercules, Bellerophon, Growling a laugh the while from ruddy maws. Rouse them from sleep! for now with habits changed And wearied with the sleepless hours of eld They slumber much. But not to pause with these, Look at my Attic hive. Hymettus' flowers Are blooming round it. There is Rhaicus' bee, And one that Sappho caught on Cupid's lips, Which stung her to a luscious epigram. Here in sheep's clothing wanders Ãsop's wolf, With Reineke the diplomatic fox, And Monsieur Frog who burst with vanity. Here too 's the cow that vaulted o'er the moon, The famous clock the mouse ran up, the cat That owned the fiddle, the small dog that laughed When crafty dish with silly spoon eloped, And mother Hubbard's still more famous dog. Here is the goose that laid the golden egg, The camel through the needle's eye that passed, Quarles' friendly monkey, Beauty's gentle beast, The tortoise with the hare that ran a race, And that which crushed the skull of Ãschylus. Here in a pleasant group you may behold The Austrian eagle with its double head, The Scottish unicorn and Gallic cock, Discussing politics and talking wise Of European balances of power. And here in pleasant conversation meet Two long-eared friends, who hold a wise discourse With longer-horned companions scarce so dull As many a human party we have known. There Balaam's social beast, and at his side His crony, Apuleius' golden ass, May yet be seen talking with Myron's cow, Or the red cow that told such wondrous tales Of her interior knowledge of Tom Thumb; While standing near and listening, you may see A group of bullsâamong them he who pulled Cock Robin's knell, and he whom Phaleris Begat in brass, and one from Ireland sent, And from the Vatican one Papal bull. And here at last, to end my catalogue, Which merely hints a creature here and there, My rarest wonders from the East, you'll see Two vampires and a red-lipped female Ghoule. Tired of these, if you should wish to read, Look in my library. This curious keyâ A serpent issuing from an ivory skull And twisting round its handleâopens it. Here are dim alcoves framed in ebony And lit by softly-blazoned diamond panes, Where glow and move as if endowed with life The painted history of glorious men. Each pane is magic; at a simple sign The life of him whose name is writ beneath Will glide in mute procession o'er its face. The room is deaf to sound; a moth-like veil Like woven twilight o'er the ceiling floats, And from the centre hangs a crystal globe: Touch it but once, a Marid answers it, And at your nod brings all your wish may shape. Noiseless he moves, and comes and goes like air, Waving Arabian odour from his wings. Would you behold the furthest wildest spot Hid in the secret'st corner of the earth, Twirl the globe thrice and in its depths it lives. Fixed in the wall a magic mirror shines Oblong and veined with myriad wavering lines: That's the time-table of the centuriesâ Name but the number of a year, day, hour, And then a placeâthe deed there done, and then, Will start at once to picture in the glass And move, as you request it, on in time. Within these cabinets are curious books, Among a myriad which I will not name, Which now the world supposes to be lostâ The Sibyl's books are there, the two she burnt, There Dante's rhyme, with Angelo's designs, There Raffaelle's hundred sonnets fairly writ, There Sappho's songs, complete, and Shakespeare's life, And the lost tragedies of Ãschylus. The famous distich of Callicrates Writ on a seed of sesamum is there, With the whole Iliad in a nutshell closed. There is the music of the Song of songs, Great books of drawings by Philostrates, And all the poems Coleridge meant to write. In the far corner towering over all Chryselephantine sits the Phidian Zeus, And on the walls Da Vinci's great cartoon Beside its rival hangs intact and fresh; And there alone upon a sombre stand, Tempting the touch to open its great leaves, Where no one ever read but wept, is placed The sad black-letter Book of Destiny. This key my great conservatory opes, Where you will find some rare and curious fruitsâ There are the sour grapesâbut within your reachâ Taste them if you desire! There too you'll see The apple Paris to the fairest gave; And that which tempted Eve, in it her teeth You'll see imprinted; also that which grows Upon the Dead Sea's margin, with the three That from the Hesperian gardens Atlas stole. There is the date-stone by the merchant thrown Against the Afrite o'er the garden-wall; The pear that caused the sleeper's nose to grow; The Lotus fruit that brings oblivion; A date-tree with the dates of everything; And the unripening fruit of our desires. This opes the silent cabinet of dreamsâ 'Tis vague and empty when you enter first! A mystery floats around, like music dim For which the ear keeps strainingâsounds so fine That all the soul must listen, leaning out Upon the furthest verge of sense to hear. Out of the dark emerge, by slow degrees, Vague things that come and goâgreat ghostly shapesâ Like shadows on a curtain when it swings; Dear smiles gleam there that made the joy of life, And hopes burst forth to their consummate flower That faded long ago to death and dust In our young hearts. Ambition there holds up Its splendid gifts, and in our hands we grasp The prize we covet dearer than our life. There, lips are kissed that drown the soul with love, And voices whisper us to heavenly trance, And wishes reach their goal. There you may find The cabala on which is fairly writ The squaring of the circleâthe receipt For alchemists to make the wondrous stone, And to achieve perpetual motion. There Are faultless pictures, statues, poems, songs, That sternest critics strive in vain to blame. One cabinet contains, placed side by side, A pair of shabby, little, worn-out shoes, A golden locket with an auburn curl, A dry dead rose, the yellow page whereon The drawing of a childish hand is seen, And a love-letter stained with blots of tearsâ Ah! touch them not, for they will make you weep! There is a box crammed full of broken hopes And childish joys we careless threw away And never could recover, though lifelong We prayed the truants to return again. Here for a time, while sleep's dim door is shut, What waking life denies, in dreams is given. Here, sleeping, you may quaff the drink of gods, And in a moment know perennial youth. Nor this aloneâbut through the wilds of space, Borne to the universe's verge, may rush Up to the gates of heaven, and see below In endless swarming all the fiery spheres Flash through the solemn depths of silent night. Pass through this roomâ'tis but a vestibule That opens to a vaster drearier hallâ Where horrent dreams steal noiselessly about, And opiate shapes of sick delirium swarm, And nightmares wander. There the Marids dwell And Ghouls, and Ginns, and Afrites huge and black, And forms so faint that they elude the eye. These, as you look upon them, shift and change, Mow, mock, and threaten, and pursue your steps As, wild with fear, you strive with leaden feet To flee their presence. There, in awe and dread, Vague horrors creep that have no name on earth, Found in the fevered dreams of wicked souls, And sent me from the East. There upward stretch, Leading to nowhere, monstrous galleries, Where slipping, sliding, goes the 'wildered thought Up endless convolutions into heights So vast we totter in a vague dismay Or drop to blankness. There huge caverns gape, Dripping with terrors, into which we slip Despite our death-like graspings for support. There whirl a million dizzy wheels of thought, And spin to madness. With your waking steps You need not fear themâthey're unreal all. Here stay your feet; nor curious seek to pass The massive door that opens out beyond. What lies behind, your eyes must never seeâ Never without the charm to keep you safe, For there lies death, unless the charm you own. âGive it to me,â you cryâso curious, then? If you insist, of course; and you'll admit Eve is your mother. Never say again That women have no curiosity. Ah! now you frown, and with a look of pride Reject my offer. So, love, let it be. I'll keep the charm, and say 'tis just as sure That you are curious as that I'm unkind. Both falseâand here's the key, dear Fatima; And pray obey my warningânever look Into the Cabinet of Death, for there A step were fatal if without the charm. So fare you well.âAh! I forgot to say The key's a fairy that will tell me all. Don't shake your finger at me, and curl up That pretty lip with scorn. Better a kiss! Perhaps I'd better leave the charmâno! no! Not one word moreâonly a kissâfarewell!</field>
