      <field name="fulltext">ANYTA. I. Thy happy tongue strings vocal pearls From morn to eve through listening noon; Thou shakest beauty from thy curls, As on the longest day of June The Sun pours splendor from his eyes, Thou font of sinless ecstasies. Thou indoor Sun, whose gendering ray Is the glad look thy smile that crests, Thy little self sheds light all day, Kindling new love in thankful breasts, And breeding such good thoughts in me That I am inly warmed by thee. And was I once as thou now art, My days with rosy blossoms rife? Therefore it is thy little heart Singing so true fresh songs of life, Tunes mine upon a wiser key, And makes me find myself in thee. 1853. II. My feelings grow too large for speech, If on the cliff in vivid hour I stand, and with my mind would reach About the sea and clasp its power. When reverend Night, opening her eyes, Bends all their pomp of look on me, Dilated by the light, I rise On thoughts of hushed solemnity. Thy great new eyes light in me thought Deeper than sea or night can draw, To speechless love and wonder wrought, Gazing in them with holy awe. III. The life that flashes in the cloud Dies in its thunder-greeted birth: The night it scatters from the earth Reclasps it with an earthy shroud. Quick kindled from a sphere still higher Are lightnings mixt of finer light, That die not, quenched in sudden night, But live a steadfast sacred fire. Like suns new-lit by th' Architect, Who warms th' eternal domes above, Fresh flashes issuing from his love Warm thee, by his great hand bedeckt. And thus in glistening unity Thy beauties inly bud and flower: Thou beam'st with daily brightened power, Each day more full of Deity. IV. With thee 't is ever morning, Thou playmate of the Hours; Young Time keeps young, adorning Thy life with dewy flowers. Thy minutes all are blessings, Rained from an inward Heaven; We share them through caressings, Regiving what thou 'st given. Hope's fondling, pet of gladness, Of prattling joy The ready toy, Thy coming gilds the clouds of sadness. Is it a fiery breathing, The pulsing of the brain, In the rich turmoil seething Of its initial gain? Or does imagination, Enfreed by thee and fed, Exhale an emanation To girt thy glittering head? For lo! a golden glory Circles thy brow: It fronts me now, Palpable as that of sacred story. Fresh orb of holy fire, That sun'st our earthy night, Thy motion swings me higher, Thou singing star of light! The splendor in thy glances Relumes my darkened youth; Thou swell'st my tide of fancies New satellite of truth. Wise monitor of duty, Mysterious child! In thee uppiled Are treasuries of love and beauty. V. The noonday heat hath hushed the air, And leaflets drink with noiseless glee Their fill of light, and everywhere The hot earth pulses silently. Adown through ash-leaved maple limbs, That guard with green the open sash, A thousand rays with voiceless hymns, A golden throng, benignant flash. The light and air serenely keep A smiling watch about the bed, Whereon divine resistless sleep Hath chained those lips, that restless head. The warm beams play at hide-and-seek 'Mong naked knees and arms and curls, And smoothly glide from rounded cheek, Like flying shadows chased from pearls. And whosoever now draws nigh, A loving listening silence keeps, To catch that whisper from on high, The breathing of a child that sleeps. VI. Life's tide in that sleep-circled breast Heaves with a swell so much more worth Than common cadences of earth, It might be breathings of the blest. The Builder builds a being rare, Flushing it full with virgin power, And in its rest, that holy hour, Unresting works creative there. And Beauty thenâlike flowers at night, That nurse their sweetness in their sleepâ Crouches to spring with bolder leap, And seize tranced eyes with gaudier light. VII. Of genius 't is the gorgeous gift To read the cipher always gleaming From Nature's face, and shrewdly sift The subtleties of her wise seeming. The Artist's large elected eye, Tracking the Almighty's splendent duty, Enraptured sees even gross things lie Transfigured by the soul of beauty. And things that are or great or good Shine with a twofold lustre glowing, Imburnished by his purple mood, Like streams 'mid autumn foliage flowing. These trembling moods, by plastic might Transmuted are to firm creations, So potent fair, they grow the light And glory of the proudest nations. And kings upraise themselves who raise Art-palaces to ward these treasures, That so the heart with joy amaze, And feed such inward endless pleasures, That thoughtful, thankful, Christian men, To steep their eyes in these pure pages, Bringing best will or practised ken, Make to them votive pilgrimages. And such a Palace broadly stands, Its walls with hallowed handwork flashing, Where Elbe is proudest of her lands, Her waters stately Dresden dashing. Here flame-eyed Rubens' titan brush Hastens to fix the thronged emotions, Lightening from his hot brain, that gush In fulgent floods of grand proportions. And here the wisest gaze with awe, To see unfolded by a brother Beauty transcending earthly law,â The Saviour-Child and sainted Mother, âMadonna di San Sistoâ styled, Whereinto holy Raphael melted His boundless being undefiled:â Those radiant heads, with grandeur belted. Here too is great Correggio's âNight.â The dawn, that through Heaven's portal prieth, Has not yet scaled in his auburn flight The lonely manger, wherein lieth The sacred Child. Yet, lo! a sight! Athwart the air so thick and sparkless From th' Infant streams triumphant light, Divinely vanquishing the darkness.â Fresh to my heart dear memories bring That pictured joy, thee now beholding, As Cherubs 'bout thee sleeping sing, Thy tender life in theirs enfolding; While from thy brow divinely flows Fresh conquering light, our souls illuming: With love and hope it silent glows, The earth's dank gloominess consuming. VIII. They hover near,âlike sunlit airs About the new-born lily's bloom, To shield it from the wither'd doom A stagnant darkness surely bears,â They hover near, the ghostly powers, They fan celestial light upon The lid that veils its fiery sun: Their vision guides the bandaged Hours,â A vision that nor rests nor swerves, That knows not darkness, knows not sleep, That long hath quit the realms that keep The spirit subject to the nerves. How solemn is this living death! The haughty self so lowly lain, The muffling of the mighty brain, And life but an unconscious breath. IX. As cloudlet silvered by the Sun, Or air-supported gossamer, Thou sleepest safe, without a stir, Uplifted by His benison. Great Sleep, thou liest on those lids Like a warm calm upon the ocean, When winds have folded up their motion, And June to brooding stillness bids. Lie gently, gracious Sleep, the while Life's inmost channels brim with streams To ripple soft through flowery dreams, That dally with a waking smile. X. Lift at last those lids belashed: From without and from within Counter streams of light are flashed: A new glory tints her skin. Wide awake, she lieth still; As she would her conscience steep In the juices choice that fill Life with savor after sleep. Still she lieth, and her mouth Joy exchangeth with her eyes: As with breathings from the south Flush her temples where she lies. XI. Lusty freedom's brave child, Thy dear motions all swing To a rhythm such as angel-ears quaff: In the air what is wild, On the earth what can sing Set their chords to thy musical laugh. From thy black impish eyes Leap young goblins of fun, Deftly mounted on beamlets of light: With their gossamer ties, Out of mischief quick spun, They fast bind us with magical might. And these bonds make us free, With their magical might Unloosing of years the rough hold: We grow guiltless with thee, While we move in the sight Of thy joy and thy innocence bold. XII. Thou art a vision which the eyes Cannot see with all their light: Too far a mystery in thee lies For the reason's measured sight. Thou art a myth entrapped in flesh, From its antique cloudy land, Delighting in the sudden mesh Spun by Beauty's lithesome hand: A Poem bounding through the leaves, Interlaced with sun and thee, More true than ever Poet weaves In his gladdest minstrelsy. A beamlet art thou of the dawn, Shot from Night's high-peopled blue, To skim across a May-steeped lawn, Scattering diamonds on the dew. So full of Morning's healthy gush Is thy motion's fluent spring, Thou know'st nor noon nor evening's hush, Nor for thee hath Time a wing. Too nimble thou for sense to catch thee In thy mystic joyous dance: Imagination e'en can't match thee With his fleet extravagance. XIII. Swift minutes run before thy feet; But not the swiftest passeth by Till he hath touched the springs that ply Thy ruddy pulse's wishful beat. Each comes from far to bring his gift, He comes from God's eternity; Mysterious gives his gift to thee, Then silent onward passeth swift. And lordly Day, when thou dost sleep, His vassals' tribute counteth o'er, And, miser with his more to more, Rejoiceth in the growing heap. XIV. Like matin-note from bridal nest Entangled in a blooming tree; Or, rockt on ripple's trembling breast, The moon's long path across the sea; Or foremost sunbeams' ordered flight, A gairish, gleesome, countless crew, That scale the dungeon-walls of night To kiss th' expectant eyes of dew,â Like all that best, through eye and ear, High thought doth launch upon the deeps Where unseen hands our being steer And life with sightless movement leaps, Is thy free glance's mystery; And in thy voice's maiden mood Are cadences that fall on me, Soft echoes from infinitude. XV. Transparent streamlets upward run From roots that cull a dainty food, And send it in an amber flood To meet the embraces of the sun. A miracle the summit shows: The overrunnings of the rill A broidered chalice scoop, and fill With fragrant flakes, which are the rose. But pale and cold and thin the vein Of earthy blood that vivifies The rose, to juices hot that rise Ensanguined to thy crescent brain; And there through torrid teemful spells,â Which human senses dare not trace, Nor less than holiest thought embrace,â Perform their plastic miracles. XVI. For there such luminous fires are lit, A blaze athwart the stars they fling, And flashing broad, the riches bring Of shapes, sounds, colors infinite. And others kindle warmer yet, And thought's smooth endless coils unwind, That blandly thy new being bind In law's unseen connubial net. And others warmer, finer still, Upon thy inward softly melt The loves that purest hearts have felt, And fuse thy bashful wants to will. And this deep inward wealth o'erruns In featured joyfulness, and dips In beauty's foam curl, cheek, and lips, And eyes that borrow of the suns. XVII. But deeper inward, still more rare, Are essences that swiftly sweep, And, glorified, as nimble leap As lightnings in their boreal lair. Than rubiest blood more potent they, They mete its currents to the heart, And rule its pulse with earthless art In supersubtle ghostly play. Earth cannot hear their working-hymn, Nor see their billowy hues of flame, To which Beethoven's chords were tame, And splendors of the rainbow dim. Streaming from life's great fountain-head, They know nor death, decay, nor sleep, Foredestined to upmount the steep Of angel-summits, music-led. Behind all thought and passion sit The immortal, to the mortal bound, And watch each motion, blow, or wound, With looks informed from th' Infinite,â With looks more grand than beamy bend From old Olympian battlements, When to great Agamemnon's tents The Grecian gods a greeting send. XVIII. Like the violets veined thou cullest,â Singing, as the laden bees, Untaught airs wherewith thou lullest Sweetest inner harmonies,â Is the pensive opal blaze Of thy face on summer days. Like the restless leap of fountain, Musical from morn to eve, That from distant trackless mountain Draws the thread its jet to weave, From the Highest, dim away, Comes thy tuneful bubbling day. Like the changeful joy of skies, Flooded so by western Sun With sweet awe they brim our eyes, And the heart to prayer is won, Is the shifting earnest play Of thy childhood's dimpled day. XIX. The Sun his children doth embrace, In flame his arm they feel: Through love it is he rolls through space Each ordered orbit's wheel. From several suns the fervor warms Thy new corruscant path, And burns with love the hydra-harms That multiply with wrath. But not a beam from us outstarts To beck thee on thy way, But it returns upon our hearts To bless us with its day,â A day elate with love's own light, Illumination pure,â A spark seraphic, kindled white By inward sufflature. XX. As flusht Aurora, crowned with May, Snatches from Night the dreamy flowers, Earth's beauties waken to the day Of thy new-risen spriteful powers. And one by one life's wonders press Their features on thy molten brain, Where words that lift and thoughts that bless In quivering piles are hourly lain. Like pictured cherub-heads a-wing, Soft glistening through fresh incense-fires, Here little loves and longings cling, And peeping buds of pure desires. They nestle shy and close and warm, An unfledged brood of meteless might, That twitter, chirp and flit, and arm Their pinions for a summer flight. XXI. But pinions puissant-plumed have I,â Imagination's brood, by love Requickened,âkeen to soar and rove Through the deep Future's swarming sky. Ere yet thy paths grow steep and rough, While still the day has all its bloom, And night no care for one to whom Each glossy hour is life enough, I waft me to the rubied peaks, First warmed by Fortune's gairish ray, Where breezes fan the heats of day, And latest linger golden streaks. Here, with a thousand shadows chased,â By foils and artful mouldings cast,â A towered palace, light and vast, With oriels, corbels, finials graced, Looks from a hundred windows out, Through vista'd park, on leafy forms, Gigantic playmates of the storms, Hoar oaks, that help the tempest shout. Within, smooth luxuryârefined By manly needâenrobes the halls And chambers, from whose storied walls Gleams lifesome Art's transfusive mind. The air is sweet with courtesy; And martial wills and grandeurs proud Are quelled by breeding in the crowd That radiant waving circles thee, Mistress and Matron young, whose jets Of speech canorous fountains make, And from whose breathing beauties break As lightnings from thy carcanets. XXII. But wherefore leap the jocund years To hang upon thy woman's state The dole of gross ambition's weight, That presses out the bitterest tears? If Fancy, hopeful-hovering, will Dare the dim Future's silent vast, Shield her, the dear one, 'gainst the blast Of joyments that the duties chill. Let Fancy work it modestly Each nimble gleaming spirit-vein, Intreasured in a blossom-brain, To glisten through eternity. Audacious sacrilege it is, To build for thee with wishful thought, God's fresh-enkindled flame inwrought With earthenâgreedy fantasies. XXIII. And Fancy hath her craven moods; Then, 'gainst my heart, she cowards me, And through my pallor makes me see Of crime and vice the raven broods Screeching about thy shadowed head,â Untimely tamed by net of gray;â Then darkening still my cold dismay, She conjures phantoms upas-fed, Dim visible,âso murksome vague,â Except on thy wan features, feared To clammy paleness, as though bleared By poison of an inward plague. Then quickly shifts the torture's phase, And, like a cave within a cave, Sinks to a deeper night; and, slave To terrors undivulged, I gaze, Blinded at first by blackness. Then By silent lightning swift is torn The pitchy screen, and thou, forlorn, Sittest within a muttering den. Ere on this hell sweep other blast, My harrowed soul the senses shakes Loose from the spell, like one who wakes With dreams unspeakable aghast. XXIV. Cold Fancy here 's no friend of mine, But traitress, who doth dog my mood, To tempt me with circean food, Or drug me with a poisoned wine. And false to me to thee she 's false; And so I gird me 'gainst her bribes, And hearken where the soul imbibes Naught that or flatters or appalls,â Where accents free are laden deep With music tuned on heavenly bars; Where pulses throbbing through the stars Temper thy motion's joyful sweep. Thy lightest plays are buds that hold A rhythmic life within their flakes, And through fresh orient glancing breaks Thy noon in marvels manifold. And marvels more than fancy feigns Are smallest deeds, so dim their reach; Nor can all thought such wisdom teach As thy young loves and petty pains. With these and these alone I'll build A modest future for thy years: I'll build it more of smiles than tears, And pray that Heaven its sorrows gild. 1861. OTHER POEMS. A HARP OF MANY STRINGS. Softly doth sleep at dawn unlock The forted palace where she broods; Then back to their chambers instant flock The brain's unnumbered multitudes. Through the quick-opened casement, where An hour before was lonely night, My fresh eyes meet the crowded glare, And broad beatitudes of light. The joyance of the star-cooled trees, Earth's baptizement in dewy air, Love-messages through whispering breeze, The sky's gold crown of misty hair, The winds that with grave shadows romp, Splendors that through the glad leaves leap, Young Morning's sunny pilÃ¨d pomp,â All these are harvests I may reap. Nor does the wonder steal away If I step out into the blaze,â The broad is changed for subtler day, The grosser for minute amaze; For leaf and blossom, blade and bush, So vibrate each with separate law, And beauty so doth all beflush, That wonder deepens into awe. From sleepless nature, myriad-faced, Upglimmers such a sea of eyes, My brain, with sibyl-lights belaced, Illumined wills it will be wise. And thought is chafed by orphic hints, The common glistens weird and strange, And melt the firmest forms and tints In mystic sequences of change. And all about are sights and sounds That suckle rapture, since began Creation's radiant rhythmic rounds Through rose and beetle up to man. No pulse of life that humblest beats, On earth below, in air above, But its unhindered motion heats In healthy hearts the pulse of love. Each dumbest creature music wakes That through the deeper life-chord rings, As love upon us quivering shakes The warmth that lifts seraphic wings. Across the isles of joy and woe Ãolian gales forever sweep; Than hearts that faintly feel them blow More blest are hearts they make to weep. From wide still burning hearths the past Bejems me with its whitest rays, Whitened in the high holy blast Of sage and poet's brain ablaze. And in my jubilant thought so nurst, Giant imaginations surge, As they the bonds of clay would burst, And daunt me on creation's verge. In sleep's far travel what great hosts Accost the soul, we cannot say; But gifts are given, as angel-ghosts Had dyed them in a higher day. Great lights great joys forever ply About my life: the breath that warms The Sun blows on my cheek, and I Seem dandled in almighty arms. I am a harp of many strings, And all the day, through night and noon, Upon me God his music flings, If I but keep the harp in tune. PREVISIONS. Yet shall be waked the slumbering years By the quick tramp of guilty war, And blameless eyes be scorched by tears Wrung from new depths of old despair. Hate shall yet brew his venom's blight By heat that ne'er from vengeance warps, Till sleepless, pale, unpitying night Casts at day's door a mangled corpse. Young truths shall still their counsel keep, Silent 'mid clack of hoary lies, That, servile bold, maskt manhood steep In slime of stale hypocrisies. As lightning's breath at tranquil noon Upbuilds beneath the western vault Its far-off cloud-based batteries, soon To volley the dread thunderbolt, In life's warm lulls shall still be nurst Hot ires, that, foully fed, and pent In Custom's coward cages, burst On the rackt world with ghastly rent. And still from age's sensual lip Shall ooze the lees of rotted truth, Dripping, a daily upas-drip In the sweet blood of listening youth. But truth, though tortured, is truth still, The stanchest tool wherewith doth ply In the world's sway his regnant will, The God who can't create a lie. Lies are all human, fibres true Perversely twisted in the strain Of sense, that lusts beyond its due, Stifling high joy with pampered pain. Nor in life's swarming womb, where sleep Action's full germs, is there a seed But from its vivid core might leap The graces of a sinless deed. On Time's green stem the clustered fruit Eternity's replenishings With such remedial sap recruit, That age to age aye bettering brings. Thus by the soul's aspiring toil Her earthly garment shall be wove With ever dwindling taint of soil, Till human life be heavenly love. 1857. LOVE. I. This sorrow-shadowed world would sparkle, bright As painless Paradise to its new Eve, If earth's love-woven threads were lines of light; For not the basest bosom but 't will heave At times love-laden, and the many grieve Love-anguished daily, while to most is dear Lone life through one or more to whom they cleave, In thought tracking them hourly, far or near, Sending Love warm o'er arctic trail or desert drear. II. And drearier than Sahara's starless waste, When winds are playing billows with its sands, Colder than frozen moonbeam, pallid traced Through Greenland's slanting snows, the soul in bands Of rigid self so fortressed it withstands Hot summons of beleaguering troops of woe, That myriad-tongued with thin briarian hands Upwail and stretch from their dejection low, And moan like tempests that through foundering cordage blow. III. If in such loveless cave could live a soul, And notâin deep self-darkened dungeon pent, Uncoupled from the sunn'd celestial wholeâ Lose its immortal gait and hardiment, And, forfeiting the limitless ascent Of the undying, wane to earthy breath, To vex the sea, with wintry blusterings blent, Or creep plague-tainted lusty sheets beneath, Or howl round hearths where love is weeping for a death. IV. Full blest is only he who warmly weeps; And Love's most sacred fonts are brim with tears, Through which grow visible his voiceless deeps, As heaven's through night's blue gush of farthest spheres. These drops are jewels stored in toilsome years, Wherein Love glistens on his gala-days Of sorrow, sad despair, and ardent fears, That rouse great Love, who foremost pangs allays; For his wide glow first fires then soothes them with his blaze, V. As the hot helpful Sun Spring's stormy rains, Who with his tender bloom-enkindling heat Strains them to joyous fruit and wipes their stains. High partner of the sovereign Sun, Love's feet Glide like Aurora's arrows that defeat The flying darkness and uplight the dew: Where'er he comes, life's beauties rise to greet His flame: the faint expended old renew Their juices, and the young pant for the good and true. VI. Love is the measure of the more or less Of depth in deed, from the brave lonely fall Of martyred saint to nursing lioness, Who shields her cub with death. Upon the pall, Folded in every heart, waiting the call Of deathful selfishness, Love throws his spark, And like benignant light that rends the wall Of cloud to hang on high the exultant arc, Love's ray cleaves the bleak tempest and the lurid dark. VII. The tender breath of timorous spring doth kiss With Love's first joy the wishful earth, that drinks The welcome warmth, and tokens of her bliss Soon gives in blossomed lea, and on the brinks Of quickened brooks, through hyacinths and pinks And violets, in the new bridal coats Of amorous flies, the clinking golden links Of gleesome matin-minstrelsy, that floats From groves thrilled by the quiring of love-swollen throats. VIII. Through the croaked plainings of this jangled life No song doth sparkle but its melody Is Love's, whose music sleeps in hottest strife, And wakes to smooth destruction's deepening sea, Wooes the palled ear of pining misery, The sullen eye of outcast crime endears; So strong, that, were Love banished, earth would be One vast encampment of armed hates and fears, A restless desolation, void of smiles and tears. IX. History's best beacons, her refulgent torches By Love are lighted, whose empyrean fire Makes Moses' sacred mountain smoke, and scorches The bush, stifles the lower with a higher Heroic heat in the doomed Brutus' sire, Turns heavenward Dante's fruitful look that roams Through Hell, deep tunes the wistful minstrel-choir, And warmer glows than even in tenderest homes In the dim vaulted sweep of great cathedral domes. X. The starry mazes peopling heaven are gifts Of Love, and by their mystic light we read The cipher of the eternal hand that lifts The film of seeming chaos, plants the seed That grows to suns, by whose great touch is freed The joy of hopeful being, and momently Are loosed souls multitudinous, of breed So lordly they are born immortal, free, Co-heirs from God of hope and faith and charity. XI. The soul's ascendant recompense 't is Love's To heap, urging life's motion toward the heights Where man puts on his majesty and moves Erect, purged to unbarbÃ¨d free delights; Whereâfeebler feebler grown the sordid fights Of selfâactivities more calm and wide And meedful by his breath are fed, and rights To duties high deported so allied, His pulses are with ceaseless benediction plied. XII. Tempered in us by Love is the great awe That else would freeze the swelling thoughts that soar To seek the all-holy source of life and law, To which we then are nearest when we pour Ourselves upon our fellows, and our core Grows seedful ripe through self-forgetfulness, And we, feeling Love's health through every pore, Nearer and nearer to the godhead press, And blessÃ¨d are in that we live to love and bless. TO A ROSE. Not the honeyed bee doth sip All thy fragrance blossomed rife: Sweetest juices from thy lip Go to nourish higher life. Human souls are fed by thee: What thou draw'st from air and earth Is compounded cunningly In a gift of moral worth. Wisest thinker of our kind Comes not near thee in his walk, But thou dost enrich his mind, Pendant on a tiny stalk. Nurseling of the tenderest air, All the life thou hast to live, Dearest child of culture's care, Is, to give, and still to give. ALONE. The widowed mother, one by one Hath seen her children drop away. A boy was left: now he is gone, She sits forlorn, that mother gray. The captive weeps upon his stone, Chained to the narrow wintry floor: Nor voice nor eye to him is known, Save when the jailer opes his door. By wayward shipwreck singly thrown Upon a distant speechless isle, A sailor-boy so mute has grown That he at last hath ceased to smile. Think you that these are all alone, Because bereft of human gaze? Never was aught but on it shone Incessant superhuman blaze. The blindest worm, the proudest throne Are ever blest with company: Who were an instant left alone, That instant would he cease to be. And that first death would shake the stars, With terror rack creation's face, That sprung were life's eternal bars, And God no more was in his place. THE DEMON. I. Cradled in earth's diviner wealth, The costly breath of infancy,â That orbed the ruddy limbs to be Like dimpled coral tinct with health,â A new soul beamed its mortal joy Through the fresh eyelids of a boy. II. He lay couched on the silent marge Of boundless mights, that deeply swelled In tune with mights that in him welled,â A boy of look so lustrous large, That where in inward light he lay The happiest sunbeams came to play. III. And with them played a sunnier light, Quelling with swollen tides of work The jealous stains of busy murk,â Beauty's illuminings, clean and bright As Seraph's phantasies of power, And to all being a sumless dower. IV. And still another braid of beamsâ As her loost hair a maiden's feetâ Enwinds him in their hallowed heat: With such electric current streams Love on his head, an answering flood Leaps through his eyes and rose cheek's blood; V. So that he lay a lump of joy, A fount spouted through hundred jets Of smiles. And Beauty, pausing, lets Love have his will on the dear boy: For Beauty can not do Love's duty, Nor even Love do that of Beauty.â VI. Sunbeam by hasty blackness quenched, Of light were not more swift deflowered Than that blest boy. So low he cowered, As being's pivot had been wrenched, Or he had heard through his mother's kisses Cold whisperings from a serpent's hisses. VII. Lower and lower quailed the boy. Choked by gaunt Pallor's pulseless breath,â Wan wafture from the wastes of death,â He lay a new-launched wreck of joy, Wrecked in broad day, and none could see The sudden rock of his misery. VIII. Whence that despiteous covert thrill? Are his young eyeballs glazed by glare Of bristling monster clutched from air? Or are his terrors ghostlier still? Do subtler spectres inly creep Through the dim chambers left by sleep? IX. Mightier than even the might of thought,â That grasps in the gauge of its great seeing The deep magnificence of being,â Is love, here to its utmost wrought, Swift filtered through earth's holiest part, A trembling large maternal heart; X. Whence now in flood so warm it gushed,â Like sane looks poured on madman's eyes, Stilling their lunar ecstasies,â The boy's cold terror melted: hushed, His tears ceased falling on her breast, And there he sobbed his moan to rest. XI. And angered Beauty,âquick returned To where the love-rockt infant slept,â With Love and Life such vigil kept, That when he waked his rose cheek burned, As o'er its joy had never passed A viewless spectre's whitening blast. XII. And still as on the road he skipped From childhood's smile to boyhood's laugh, At times, when just about to quaff The cup from gladness' river dipt, Such shadow on him strange would fall The draught grew thick in sudden gall. XIII. But on the panting hearts of boys E'en weight of shadows cannot lie: Betossed on fitful lights they die, Scourged by the nimble whip of joys,â Pet brood of omnipresent truth, Th' invisible spirit-guard of youth.â XIV. The strenuous ploughman's obdurate tread Less cold entombs the suppliant flowersâ All young and diadem'd with showersâ Than fresh-crowned manhood's vaulting head Scorns the late urchin's puny joys, Counting them but a witless noise. XV. The boy has thought himself to man, And stoutly covets manly prizes. As the first ray from sun that rises, Striking a hill or barbacan, Chafes the strong eye of plumÃ¨d troop, Embattled for the lusted swoop, XVI. On him, elate and heated, blazedâ Like beckoning lights in happiest dreamsâ A virgin drift of Hope's brisk beams, As, proud and glad, he dauntless gazed Where, glittering in the dewy sun, Wide lay the victories to be won. XVII. How trustful broad doth prophesy The heart, when new and strong and good! And truly too; for in young blood, As in first Adam's, folded lie The potencies that are to be The all of human destiny. XVIII. Yet not for seer fulfilment is. Young hearts are but a magic glass, Whereon just flash, then quickly pass Life's gorgeous possibilities Back to the future's calm abyss, To sleep till light shall wake their bliss. XIX. Against his thought he soon was sad. Besprent by ceaseless rain of sorrow, He saw each day entoiled by its morrow, Coy good constrained by brazen bad; Ever beside warm quickening wombs The frosty deeps of infant tombs.â XX. And now th' invisible rays of thoughtâ White-heated by beleaguering fires In the quick furnace of desiresâ Are to such plastic temper wrought, They forge, of mingled ores compact, The humming wheels of human act. XXI. But when, hot from the surgy brain, The generous, guiltless, young ideal First meets the old grim sordid real, Like heated bar immersed, with pain Winces the soul, and dark and cold Inward recoils to griefs untold. XXII. But love will blench at no ordeal; And who shall set on thought a cope? So beauty, love, and happy hope, Young mothers of the hale ideal, Who in benignant longings bask, Grow stronger, younger at their task; XXIII. Aye, ever stronger, younger, bolder, Till from man's turbid sleep be past The shadow by his day-dreams cast, And wrong in its foul embers smoulder, Fused by the crescent Sun of right, Climbing mankind from height to height. XXIV. Like cheery breeze-blest galleon, warm With flusht farewells and valiant hails, That smooth from festive moorings sails Into a noyous night of storm, And, shrieking, straining, leaping, brave, Breasts the close lightning, blast and wave, XXV. Was his quick launch into the world, A true, bold, willing man, whose will, Affronted, baffled, wounded, still Waxed braver in the shock, and, whirled On the rude vortex, drew strong breath To gird its ribs 'gainst inward death. XXVI. Unlike the ship, no rest had he. A stout man, with the will to steer, Leaves never tempests in his rear: They front him ever angrily. Co-angered, he struck stronger through, As wilder blacker storm-racks flew. XXVII. On life's mid-path he stood, unbent; But sad his eye was, and his brow In furrows knit, as if the now Despised the past and challenge sent To the future. Round his mouth were dates Indented there by scorns and hates. XXVIII. Not one was he to flinch or falter: Nor eye of man nor frown of hell Could for a trice his courage quell. And yet, as with himself he 'd palter, Or that his ruddiest heart-drops paled, At times the spirit in him quailed. XXIX. Across clear onward thoughts would fall,â Like shower on festal cavalcade, Or summons on a bridegroom laid,â A rueful shadow's sudden pall, That fixed his eye and blanched his lips, And drenched him in malign eclipse. XXX. With weird alarms even sleep was shook. Athwart the jointless dreams would crawl A hideous hydra to appall The bravest. Crouched, a dastard look Glared from his wrinkled furtive eyes, Greenish and circumfused with lies. XXXI. In a long, sinewy, jagged jaw Revenge was toothed; cold avarice pined Pale on his forehead, intertwined With lurid hate; in a vast maw Were crammed mixt crude things, of the best, Which he could gulp, but not digest. XXXII. With such associate to dream on Proved bravest nerve. But now 'gan loom Blacker against the ashy gloom Gigantesque the trembling Demon. Then, weltered in cold sweat, he quaked, And, shrieking, from his torture waked.â XXXIII. The moving shadow, worded night, Unto the day that made her cleaves, And lives by food her master leaves, Gathering what droppeth in his flight, Whereon, through the veiled hours, she broods, For good or ill, as be her moods. XXXIV. Only that form was haggard night's; Begotten on shy, helpless sleep By wilful day, who bids her weep Or laugh, according as he blights Or blesses her lone hours. What stalks In shade, first in the noontide walks. XXXV. The strong man's strength was mastering will, Itself o'ermastered by the blood Of lustful wants,âthe feverish food Of pampered life,âwhich when they fill Th' imperial orbs of thought, usurp A throne, and linkÃ¨d life discerp XXXVI. With bad contentions, endless, black, Splintering the wholesome man in two, The social both and single, who, Self-tortured, gasps upon the rack Of thwartings, doubtings, plots, and dreads, Like one who in armed darkness treads. XXXVII. Who is unruled by lustless wants, Knows not his rank, and basely creeps,â Whate'er his front,âand craven peeps For harbor 'mong the heart's low haunts. A crownless King is he, his state Sad as were Eve's without her mate, XXXVIII. Woful as sunless planet reeling Through thickened chaos,âor an ocean Heaved in perpetual shade, its motion Untuned by light,âor the pale feeling At frantic lion's torrid roar, Heard on far Iceland's arctic shore. XXXIX. And thus for him was night in day: The sunshine of the soul was quenched By earth-clouds, and the reason wrenched Its loyal path, the upward way. The worst were not mute slumber's gleams, But in loud noon the conscious dreams; XL. Day-dreams about the night they make In the blank future's awe-hedged realm,â Vague misshapes, horrible whims that whelm The minds that breed them, which still take Unholy joy in self-born fright, Hugging with vague and stern delight XLI. Their terrible imaginations, The froward offspring, coarse and grim, Of sultry passions that bedim Their life,âlusts and indignations, Wherewith they God endow, blaspheming With their loose, selfish, dark day-dreaming. XLII. Now sways the ghostly infinite law, That the unseen rules the seen. Each hour These phantasms truculent lap power From life's selectest blood, and draw Poison from healthy juice, to kill All generous, loving, kindly will. XLIII. So was his higher being curst By mandates from the lower nature Of ires, anxieties, each feature Dark with a darkness inly nurst, That in his steadfast face you spell Prints grooved by thoughts of death and hell. XLIV. Death is a dream of unripe man, A carnal myth,âin being a schism Impossible,âa cold egotism Of crude self-busied brains, which plan, That with the ceasing of a breath Ceases God's law, which knows not death.â XLV. The murkiest midnight feels the Sun: In total shade men could not breathe: And when in ghastliest umbrage seethe The passions,âlike pale silver, spun In the black earth, that unseen glows,â Through dreariest bosom secret flows XLVI. A thread of lucent life, which chance Or prosperous stroke of purpose bares; Or, oftener still, spontaneous flares An inward flame, that in the dance Fresh leaps,âthe grovelling dance of death,â And the blind heart illumineth. XLVII. That is a resurrection-day, When through the crusted sensual clods Breaks the self-loosened soul, and God's Great smileâfirst greetedâshines away The terrors, greeds, and spites that meet Round the numb'd heart, its winding-sheet. XLVIII. O! the deep pious ecstasy, When, from the smaller self upflown, We firmly sail on currents blown Love-lifted towards humanity. The far Heavens quit their frosty skies, And stooping to us warm our eyes; XLIX. And touch the brain with holy calm, That all about we patent see Divine impulsions working free The prisoned world. With chastened palm We handle commonest things, and bless All ours with the new happiness. L. One he had been who sent abroadâ Horsed fleeter than the tempest's windâ His myriad messengers of mind, Sent far, even to the verge of fraud, For homage, power, delight, and pelf, To gild one petty home for self. LI. But now, as though fresh sap had shot A subtler tide into the brain, Making it sparkle in a train Of glib imaginings, all hot With great desires, the strong man grew Transformed to something mildly new. LII. Another sun rose on his face; And thereâlike unbowed prisoner, free By stir of slow-paced libertyâ The soul came out, and through the haze Of ebbing darkness glistened glorious In its own light, jubilant, victorious. LIII. New thoughts gave action wiser bent; New acts gave life so sweet a grace, That men looked hopeful in his face, And outcasts blest him as he went. If higher joy can be, he proved, Than loving, 't is to be beloved. LIV. For ripened use too late in him These selfless pulses of the heart: Spirit from flesh will quickly part: The soul hies to a home less dim. But not in anguish part the two. Gentle regretful sighs came through, LV. That freer verge he had not here To be his better self,âfor earth Rebuilding on a cleaner hearth The life he had misbuilt,âand rear A name that memory might hold, And warmer grow in growing old. LVI. Soon melt even these unbodied sighs; For on his willing conscience roll Such pageants of the radiant Whole, The bounded earth-life from him flies A speck. He feels himself to be Parcel of vast Infinity. LVII. A freer pulse new thought upbears, More true than life, more wide than dreams; What he had been locked childhood seems; And earth, with its earthy wants and cares, Lies suddenly remote, and cast Behind him in the dusky past; LVIII. While heâlike dawn seizing vast glooms With surges of its easy mightâ Rides forward on majestic light, Mindless of flesh-imagined dooms; His calm clear spirit-staring eyes Ranged far beyond the visual skies.â LIX. Again the routed gang remuster,â Minions of venomous desires,â To sway him back to stealthy mires. Only to singe their wings they cluster. Himself his panoply, with arms Of light he 's helmed 'gainst wily harms. LX. Still unabashed, by power unvouched, Through laurelled hopes, through visions blest, Vainly once more the old shades prest; And at the last beside him crouched, Like baffled buzzard on a bier, Writhing, unmarkt, the Demon, Fear. SONG OF BIRDS BEFORE DAWN IN SPRING. Swinging upon the edge of light, As violets on flushed April's edge, They ply their tuneful privilege Yet in the chambers of the night. As planets speaking from the blue, They sparkle in the silence deep, And their unsullied voices steep In moisture of the fragrant dew. Leap, dreamer, from the dizzy pool, Where wicked fancy drowns thy sense; Leap to the call of innocence, And bathe thy heated instincts cool. Sad sleeper, shake thee loose from fears,â Old wizard Dream's unfathomed cheat,â And hearken how these notes repeat The music of enravished spheres. And thou, whose slumbered breathings move Concordant with seraphic lyres, Awake, to bless thy ear with choirs Of warblers singing songs of love. CHILDREN. What distant fingers knead their clay, What fervors slumber in their sleep, Of all they be unweeting they, They laugh and prattle, kiss and weep. How strong, how great, these little things, Who play among our busy feet; They hold us with the gordian strings Tied by the heart's enraptured beat. They are the deep perpetual peace, That underlies life's windy war, The limpid unploughed layer where cease The rages that the surface mar. STRIKE NOT A CHILD. Strike not a child: the Maker's breath Is warmer in its heart Than in or man or woman's. Death To the holy spirit is in the smart Of brutal blows. 'T is sacrilege To wound a chirping child,â In whom God just hath smiled,â Free fluttering on life's dreadful edge. He trembles! that great face, so fair But now, is quenched; its flood Of beauty ebbed inward to the lair Where suckles Anger his mad brood. Your blow has thrust him ere his time Over the precipice, To the black pit where hiss The scalding lusts that chafe to crime. POETS. We haunt the early mountain heights, Flusht by the dawns of truth; Here rustle God's creative mights, Here we can keep our youth: Rather the morning's golden flight, With never rested wings, Than the unwholesome ignorant night Which too much resting brings. We crowd the glad auroral halls, Where beautiful Ideals Aye brace and tone themselves for calls To earth's abrupt ordeals: Better a day in Beauty's school,â Beauty the bride of Truth,â Than months of seedless, drowsy rule; For thus we keep our youth. A KING. I. Sovereign he is of throned domains, more wide Than Rome's blanched eagles with their boldest wing O'ershadowed; or than in her sea-nursed pride England, whose ampler arms such realms enring, That round the globe her morning gun Reverberates, chasing the Sun. II. The Lydian King was not so rich as mine,â Whom Solon's wisdom snatched from fiery death,â Nor did luxurious, learned Lucullus dine With guests so finely choice. Napoleon's breath, When Monarchs trembled at its sound, Was less imperially becrowned. III. Not wreckful spendthrift who,âlike faithless cask, Letting rare wine as plenteous water leak,â Wastes handfuls daily, nor doth ever ask Whether they be copper or gold, and eke Would rather they were gold, for so He furthers fate at every blow; IV. Nor he whose ointed palm, like the sky's sluices, Opes only for a wise beneficence, Of whose compassionings the flooded juices To gush watch ever for a sweet pretence:â These lavish two spend not so fast As he whose horoscope I cast. V. Not scented darling of gem'd women's eyes, With his happy teeth and smooth bemirror'd curls, Who at the glass, his shrine, doth sacrifice With incense that around himself aye purls, More dainty tended is than he, The pet of my poor minstrelsy. VI. Father, of long illustrious lines the last But for one tremulous remnant twig,âround whom Convolve the chaplet of a princely past, And love, the warmer for the threatened tomb,â She like a tarn, secluded, far, That lonely clasps each stooping star:â VII. Rich lover, and more rich in love than gold, In bounteousness still richer than in both, Who with his bounteousness makes wealth unfold The plaits of love and his intreasured troth, Whose tributes so his mistress cover, She dreams, a fairy is her lover:â VIII. Not these, nor any of the thousands living, Gifted with spirit's or with body's goods, And with the still more blessed gift of giving, Can give like him, who gives as do the woods, That give a world of leaves in spring That oaks may grow and birds may sing.â IX. The subtlest visitors to the large brain Who spirit-like from th' Infinite descend, And ever travel with a glittering train Of halos new, that with the old inblend To wield the top of privilege, Whetting of thought the restless edge; X. Of the great heart the dearest intimates, Who come because 't is warm and warmer make it, Showered with love that from creation dates, The Word's winged soul and life of Him who spake it;â These lordly vassals proudly bring Of crowns the proudest to our King. XI. But King he is not yet, nor to his head Will fit the crown, till 'tween those circled bands A third, afire with gems, outvaults, to wed The two, in glow as of celestial hands. Like Morning's holy rim of light, That welds forever day to night, XII. And thus sublimely wedged, moves on the earth Creative, Beauty's visionary might Enfrees, where'er it falls, imprisoned worth,â The mind's best pioneer, with its lustral light Giving to thought a fleckless eye And chasteness unto sympathy. XIII. Who is encompassed by this tripled crown Has solar warmth which he no more can keep Within one bosom, than the Sun can frown His summer beams to icicles, or sleep While towards him in maternal May Turns the young earth with prayer for day. XIV. Of the best gifts that knows immortal life To yearning man he is the elected giver, Gifts of warm truths, that feed the soul till, rife For better mansions here, they make it shiver Of strongest Kings the strongest will, Obedient to a stronger still. XV. The primal hallowing power is his, to feel Throb through his heart the pulse of all that throbs. Dim planets that in space their splendors wheel, Warriors triumphant, bondsmen through their sobs, All trust, as all things do that stir, In him, God's meet interpreter. XVI. He sits enthroned in Nature, whence to his brain From life's perennial springs run rills of force, Which, filtered there, flow limpid back again, For centuries the fonts of new resource. To one whom God with crown enrings What are a thousand man-made Kings? XVII. His is the right divine, the puissant lord Of men through all the births of history, Puissant that with a breath he makes the chord Vibrate that 's deepest, truest. Who is he? The Poet-Thinker, he it is,â King through his fiery sympathies. XVIII. Seek that exhaustless land, whose seedful dower Of men the peopled silence of the past Enfolds with stately joy; whose giant power, Rewaked by Garibaldi's patriot blast, Flushes the classic land with sheen Bright as the grandeurs that have been. XIX. Adown five hundred years of wakeful time, Bequeathed from million sires to million sons, Undimmed, unsoiled by centuries of crime, Like Heaven's unwasted fire, translucent runs, Through tyranny's dull desert blight, One quenchless shaft of thoughtful light. XX. Dead are her dastard Kings and putrid Popes, Dead to men's love and wants and memory; But in Ausonia's inmost thoughts and hopes,â A strength and promise yet of victory,â Live primal Dante's quivering words, To patriots, inly-flaming swords. XXI. Hark to the organ-swell of thoughts that teach, From Luther's home, men foremost in life's race. What gave the pitch to that full concert's reach, What still is strongest those vast chords to brace, Binding a severed land in one, Is the deep rhythm of GÅthe's tone. XXII. Wipe from proud England's scroll her highest name, And the sweet manly tongue that clasps the earth With freedom's clamorous voice, were not the same. From him, the Seer, dates its fulgent worth: 'T is he swells England's brain so wide With his great soul's creative tide. XXIII. And we, a mighty mother's soaring child, Who on self-balanced centre stand apart, Irreverent of her Kings, our sovereign mild Thee we enthrone within our thankful heart, Great Englishman, greatest, most dear, Beloved, revered, becrowned Shakespeare. 1859. THE MEETING. They met again, and they were calm, The calm of happy years; The memories that startled both Dissolved them not in tears. The past lay still within its deep, And came not to the face; Each saw it,âshe through his old strength, And he through her old grace. He led a daughter by the hand, And she by hers a boy; The children kissed each other cheeks With ready childish joy. Then in their eyes that swiftly met Kindled a tender light, Shot o'er the future from the past, With nuptial blessing bright. She took his girl upon her knee, And he on his her boy; And thus they freely looked and talked, Brimmed with parental joy. DOWNWARD. Down from great Alps the Rivers leap, Slaking the plain with flooded sweep: Shoots, like an angel on the sight, 'Thwart the low gloom the Pharos' light: Humbly the wise their wisdom speak: Forgiveness stoops to souls that seek: Love looks its strongest downward bent From mother's lid on babe new-sent: The highest joy the highest know, Is to work downward to the low, Melting with daily dawn of love The frosts cold Misery's night hath wove: Their sleepless vigil in the skies The spirits keep with earthward eyes. THE YOUNG MOTHER. Earth has no look more deep Than a young mother's, gazing On her boy asleep; Her eyes oft raising, Then swift descending, On him again their lustre bending; As she on him from Him above Would look a sacrament of love. Not so attended is the mate Of Monarch in her queenliest state: Sovereign omnipotent she is, Her subjects peerless fantasies, That bend them to her farthest will, As, rapt, in wakeful dream she stirs Musings that all the mother thrill. And what a dream is hers! Poetic lovers never woo Ideal words to paint their loves, So warmly, or more lively sue Delight for gifts, than she now moves Imaginations that upspring From her heart's nest, and round the dome Of starriest heaven familiar sing As finding there his fitter home. Across the chasms of time she floats; She tempts the future's giddiest brinks; Of space she leaps the shadowy moats; Only from Hope's fresh cup she drinks. Thus from Fancy's free caressings Gathering for him ripest blessings, She careers where life most glistens, Where to her own heart-wants she listens. Her sleeping boy!âHe stirs, he wakes. Quick as a cloud the lightning's bar From Fancy free her soul she shakes, And swifter than a shooting star To Earth from Dream's loved heights she springs, A mother with an angel's wings; And in her countenance a light Struck from creative cores,âa glare For aught save a young mother's face too bright, And here on earth seen only there. ODE. EMOTION AND THOUGHT. I. The floods of vast Emotion heave; Then towards the shore of sense outgushing, Their trembling billows cleave, With a moan-mingled glee, To its firm bosom, rushing Thereon, like to a crested sea Clasping the brawny land, And thence rebounding, Its sunny kisses sounding On the eternal sand. II. Not from a rash admiring Stir in your amplest deeps, But with a calm aspiring, That ye may grandly wake Your great twin-brother Thought, who sleeps O'ercanopied by visions. Shake The dew of common dreams From his big eye, which gleams Bold lightning, in the welcome heat Surging from fonts that dart Creative breath, as beat The swollen pulses of your heart.â Rouse ye, your strength with light enwreathing, High sovereign Thought, That blest Emotion's procreant breathing Waste not its virtue, wrought To perdurable forms by you,â Forms beautiful as true. III. The measureless waters and the air Keep themselves clean with motion, Bathed ever in the ocean Of universal light. More fair Than speech can tell Earth rises from her star-watched rest, Resplendent 'neath the spell Of powers within her quickened breast,â Creation's voiceless powers, that leap Forever in warm nature's womb, And know nor check nor sleep, Nor death's material doom; Eternally alive and rife With affluent life; Their forging might revealed, Daily on mortal vision wheeled, In beauty's myriad thoughts and forms, And the dark majesty of storms. IV. In tiniest things Is instant revelation Of this transcendent life, which sings Interminable jubilation, And flings On shore and sea Everlastingly, Ethereal radiance, whose quick glow There where its fires Feed infinite desires,â Within the bounteous heart of man,â Is deeper now than aye, Flashing new light on God's near way, Inflaming us to feel and know How much we are, how much we can. V. Upon our opened eyes Rushes Infinity, Poured in us from the skies: Eternity Broods ever on the inward senses: The centres we Of such circumferences! Out of ourselves so far we stretch, In holiest moments we can catch Glimpses of th' unimaginable glare Of higher homes, and list their jubilee, Voiced like a million clarions' trophied blare Heard faintly o'er a subject sea. VI. Unhatched abilities, Beautiful possibilities, Live in your soundless deeps, Supreme illimitable twain! Their latent life it is that keeps You profluent towards a higher plane, They who uplift and lave humanity,â Which else in swinish trough had lain, Unfeeling of Infinity, Unthinking of Eternity, Whose awful presences Transfigure fleshly essences, Swathing in a pellucid zone man's being, Through which he feels the vision of the Allseeing. VII. Immeasurable Emotion, Unconquerable Thought, By whose inmarried motion All best ascendancies are wrought; Upmount ye, interfused For mutual beneficence, Your diverse strength conjointly used Against the downward pull of sense; Each lifting each, So ye may reach Into the empyrian day Of supersensuous truth, Whose indefatigable ray Knows not the night of pause, Regendering ceaselessly worn manhood's youth With the ever freshened forces of anointed laws. VIII. What a glad awe O'erfills the expectant soul, When vaulting thought Of being's courses grasps a new law On the scaled ramparts of the Whole; And thence supremely taught, More festering rags From the cold back of ignorance drags, And grown humanely bold, Casts on our nakedness Another fold Of warm truth's sacredness. VEILS. We move within a world of veils: They are not cleft by thrust of will: We know them not as such until The higher thought o'er will prevails. With each new throb of inward power Another mesh is softly rent; Then light to dark is quiet blent, As rosier tint to ripening flower. We dimly see till we create The things that on our senses rise, Enshrouded in a lone surmise; For all upon the spirit wait. The silent soul is ever sending Creative messages to things: On these a yearning ray she flings, Their breath with her diviner blending. Her life is one long slow prevailing Against recruited sensuous odds, Exalting man's desires, and God's Great visage more and more unveiling. WE. We glimmer specks in shoreless space, But motes the mountains are we see, And digits to immensity Whatever here the senses trace. But this immensity is ours, Partakers we in sacred rule, If loyally we bide, and school Our deep immeasurable powers. From astral zones upon us shoot Near eyes with calm parental glow, In whose fine mystic light may grow The sourest will to sweetened fruit. On spirit spirit ever ray'th: The free'd from their supernal day Beckon to those still bound in clay, In them to nurse upcleaving faith. And through the folds of living dust From higher life come shafts of love, To link the soul to souls above, And strengthen freedom's strength with trust. But who to unbelief doth cling, Revolves amid unbodied bands, Twitted and tossed by viewless hands, As children blinded in the ring. FOREVER. Their flight he watches with feathery joy, As high over head is heard The wild flock's cry,âthen quick the boy Wishes himself a bird. The youthful man upon a peak, Amid a mountain-throng, Chafes at his limbs, so wingless weak, While he riots the peaks among. The father and grandfather hies, In thought, affection, will, To his scattered progeny; but lies His crippled body still. And what are these but dumb foresight Of acts as yet unfreed,â Shoots from a latent life, whose light Foreshines the certain deed? Shall the eye go where the man can not? Shall thought or bolder dreams, Whose range and reach are aye begot By the soul that through them gleams? Does man's deep inward him bemock With sham presentiment, His heart with moony longings rock, And nothing more be meant? Could malice strike from the great source Of order, reason, love? Does He give feeling, thought, and force, To balk them from above? Dim prescience these, sweet prophecy, Mysterious far foretelling Of life disbodied, life to be With will, with love aye welling;â Faint whisperings from the power that roofs All being unfailingly,â Soul-bidden promptings, hints, near proofs Of immortality. The present, past, and future clasp Each other in a ring; And if of one a link you grasp, Through all a thrill you fling. They end not here our appetites, On earth they but begin; For though our bodies rot, their rights Survive as bliss or sin. A marriage deep without divorce Is that of spirit and flesh, And from the cold, relapsing corpse Springs life forever fresh. The body's members are no toys For the soul's sublunar play; But counters, that in griefs or joys Sum what the soul must pay. How fruitful is the littleness Wherewith our souls are vext, When acorns of this world express Oaks rooted in the next. Aye, thus by thought and phrase we split An intermelted whole; But thought and phrase can sunder it No more than speech the soul. Our worlds are one, and one are we: That still too close our glance To mete this rounded unity, Is the due of ignorance. Could men foreknow that they will live, And ever be themselves, To the self a higher hold 't would give, That sordidly now delves. To thought what height 't would lend, to spy Beyond earth's finite seeing, Life's littleness o'erbalanced by Its magnitude of being! Our lusts and pampered tawdry needs Pile dread upon the bier; With them hard-hearted Christless creeds, That brew the curse of fear. The man he feels no blast of age, Is by no sickness torn: After a long earth-pilgrimage The clay coat 't is that 's worn. The spirit keeps its light, a flame That aye illumineth Earth-paths, as well as what we name The shadowed vale of death. A STAR. The moon lies still beneath the trees, And silver-spots the sleeping moss, And touches with a ghostly gloss The leaves unwakened by the breeze. A silence as of myriad swoons Drives in my feelings to their deeps, Where still more awful silence sleeps, Mid lights more ghostly than the moon's. From th' eastward, through a leafy rent, Flashes across the moony sleep One star upon my inmost deep, Voicing the silence therein pent. With holy glances, diamond-hued, About my flickering lights it winds, And all my finite tossings binds To fixtures of infinitude. SONNETS. TO KEATS. Of the heart's reasons wherefore one would know That the departed live, and smile or sigh When we do, with a level sympathy, There 's one I feel an impulse to let flow In tuneful words: it is, that I might throw Upon thy listening ear, if so may be, My thankfulness for what I owe to thee, Imperial genius, who, a boy, didst sow Fresh seeds, of quickening power to men, great Keats; So wisely great in thy unfurnished youth, That, what had been thy broad Shakesperian feats If ripened, swift imaginations gasp To guess, sure only that sublimer truth Had more enriched thy larger rhythmic grasp. TO SHELLEY. Upon thy subtile nature was a bloom, Unearthly in its tender, gleamful glow, As thou had'st strayed from some sane star where blow But halcyon airs, and here, blinded by gloom, Did'st stumble, for the lack of light and room, And strike and wound with purposed good; and so, Through Highest pity, thou had'st leave to go Early to where for each earth-life its doom Awaits it, as the fruit the seed, and where Thy multitudinous imaginings, So truthful pure, on Heaven's fulgent stair Fit issue find, and mid the radiant rings Of mounting Angels thy great spirit's glare Adds to the brightness of the brightest things. TO COLERIDGE. Coleridge, for many a studious year I have been Thy thankful mate; climbing the misty heights Of speculation, or whenâthe delights Of great imagination's realm serene Blessing me through th' impassioned visions seen By ravished geniusâthou hast shown me sights, Revealed to mighty Poets with the lights Struck by creative frenzy; visions clean, That mind in purgatorial surges dip, And we come freshened forth, so purified, That ever anew thy rich companionship I court, to warm me at a holy fire, And be with deep soul-logic stoutly plied, Or trance-ensteeped by thy melodious lyre. TO WORDSWORTH. Among my unabating joys are these, That under thy calm roof I pressed the hand Whose life had been obedience to command Of rarest genius; that beneath thy trees I shared with thee thy cordial mountain-breeze, Answered thy speech, and looked into the bland Mysterious eyes that had beshone the land,â Those inlets to deep beauty's boundless seas,â And there, beside thy household lakes, did hear Thee laugh, and feel thy smile, so kindly blent With hospitalities, that since that year Thy face hath been a loved accompaniment To the grand music, mounting tier on tier, That to my thought profounder rhythm hath lent. TO GÅTHE. Teutonic leader,âin the foremost file Of that pickt corps, whose rapture 't is to feel With subtler closer sense all woe and weal, And forge the feeling into rhythmic pile Of words, so tuned they sing the sigh and smile Of all humanity,âmeek did'st thou kneel At Nature's pious altars, midst the peal Of prophet-organs, thy great self the while All ear and eye, thou greatest of the band, Whose voices waked their brooding Luther-land,â At last left lone in Weimar, famed through thee, Wearing with stately grace thy triple crown Of science, statesmanship, and poesy, Enrobed in age and love and rare renown. TO MILTON. Burned into History's high beacon-page By deed and thought and genius,âtriple fire, Seld-seen on earth,âthy wreathÃ¨d name flares higher Than all men's else in the sublimest age Of England, where against Time's billowy rage None is more fenced than thou, without thy lyre, Whose tones shall ring till pales the last dim pyre, And crumbles earth's triumphant equipage,â Stirring meanwhile, with deep sonorous peals, All whom its softer notes have quick entranced, Dulcet and manful,âfirst on even keels Smooth wafting raptured souls, then in high storms Of giant music purging them, advanced To where the holier spheral influence warms. TO SHAKESPEARE. Coruscant Presence, who dost ceaseless shine Unbodied benefaction on the blest,â Thy lifted myriad-millions, aye possest Of that wide speech, in whose unwearied mine Thou art the richest vein,âphrases of thine, The largest, most embossed, the fiery best, He needs who, cheered by gratitude, would crest His love and awe with epithets so fine They shall exhale some flavor of thy worth, A fraction speak of what men owe to thee, Thou lonely one, at whose still modest birth Were born new worlds of truth and ecstasy, Thou great emblazoner of man and earth, Thou secret-holder of humanity. TO DANTE. Monarch august, thy solitary throne Didst thou with solitary wisdom earn, Midst want and gloom and exile, stout and stern To master thy great self, and all alone,â Away from Tuscan hearth and children blown By Guelfian tempests,âwith strange power to turn Thy soul's hot tumults into flames that burn A world-effulgency, while for thy own Dear land thy mighty rhyme hath been a breath Breathing from Beatrice's heaven through thee, A breath of holier life heaving beneath The life of universal Italy, Where, sung thy song, thou passedst lone through death, Ended thy long sublime soliloquy. TO HOMER. In realms beyond young Story's dusky day, Where but for thee were Chaos' lightless rule, Thy fresh strong-souled impersonings so fool The senses, that we yield us to their sway, And clasp unto our hearts with earnest play Thy Doric brood, in whose primeval school Poet or sage is glad to fill a stool, And grow beneath thy fruitful quenchless ray, As on thy vast horizon Gods and men Shame history with the grandeurs of their strife, Inbreed delight, wrath, wonder, love, and ruth, And deepen man's outworn fast fading ken With teachings of the dear religious truth, That Heaven and earth live intermingled life. TO THE PRINCE OF WALES. Not lonely did a mother's grateful gaze Illume thy cradled brow; but from all climes And continents of this round earth came chimes Of love, that made a globe-enclasping blaze Of hearty homage to thy tender days,â A flame nor quenched nor dimmed by changeful time's Assault; but still old loyalty sublimes Thy manly person with its steadfast rays; Wherewith has now been wreathed a novel fire, Long burning in a kindred People's core, And by thy presence kindled to desire To burst in buoyant greeting and outpour A great Republic's welcome from its breast To England's future King, our honored guest. October, 1860. TO ENGLAND. England, we are proud to be thy eldest child, Thankful to God for the rich heritage Which thou, ere we were born, from age to age With thoughts and deeds of mightiest men up-piled, Too great within thy bounds to be inisled, And thence,âwide wafted on the undying page, Feeding the soul of hero and of sage In every Christian land,âon us have smiled, Through privilege of tongue, a daily cheer, So warmly kindred to our Saxon hearts, That we, though sundered from thee, parent dear, Have kept our love and reverence through all smarts, And now stride with thee in one grand career, Sowing the Earth with freedom and with arts. October, 1860. TO SCOTT. Winfield, thy prophet-parents named thee, Scott; And now at climax of delight they fold Thee in celestial vision, and behold Their warrior win his highest field; for not Canadian laurels, 't was thy youthful lot To reap victorious, nor thy wreaths of gold, Inwove with Azteck palm, will e'er be rolled With such sonorous hymn from trumpets hot With fame's fresh breathing, as thy present deeds, Baffling the blackest treason ever hatched In the foul nests where brood the godless greeds, Its crime foiled by a steadfast eye that watched Thy perilled country, and in its dread needs With duteous mastership from ruin snatched. January 22d, 1861. TO ANDERSON. Glad lightning, on his myriad-footed steed, Sped o'er the land, as happiest angels ride On blissful errands; then through the flood tide Of fiery syllables, thy sudden deed Poured on the Nation's troubled heart such seed Of power, the flagging pulse leapt in its side, The eagle soared sunward, again strong-eyed, Stout men looked each on each with freshened pride, And stretched to the utmost admiration's creed Towards mothers that could bear the like of thee, Who mid mad shriek of treason's thwarted brag, With soldier's grasp and true soul's loyalty, Outflung with prayer on Sumpter's martial crag Freedom's broad shield, terrible on land and sea, The world's chief hope,âour war-won fulgent flag. January 27th, 1861. TO LUTHER. Deep in the sanctuaries of the mind, Where, mystically fed, are fiery wrought The exulting miracles of freest thought, Where boldened wills the subtleties unwind That in conspirant coils resistless bind Man to his broadest duties, where are caught Fresh whispers from skyed voices, where are fought Truth's foremost battles,âthere art thou enshrined, Forever incensed by new love and light Born daily in the aspiring hearts where glows The fire of freedom, kindled through thy might, Thou Titan of the Conscience, whose vast blows Clove Popedom to the core, and freed the right From Thraldom's lurid spells and deathful throes. March 8th, 1862.</field>
