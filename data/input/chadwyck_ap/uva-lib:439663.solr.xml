      <field name="fulltext">HIPPOLYTUS CHARACTERS Artemis. Her Priestess and Virgins Aphrodite Phaedra Oenone Amazon Hippolytus, son to Theseus Creon, his friend Theseus Priest of Venus Leton, a soothsayer Satyrs. Nymphs. Chorus of Winds Followers of Theseus. Herald Priestess First Man Second Man Polydorus Thenexites ACT I. Scene 1: Music. The Temple of Diana. Priestess and Virgins bearing offerings. Priest. Daughter of Jove, Artemis, virgin-eyed, Swift-footed goddess of the sylvan shade, Release the fawn within thy silver leash, Restrain th' impatience of thy bounding feet, And gladden her who brings thee votive gifts. [Enter Artemis, C.] Art. With joy I answer to your duteous greeting; Where are the offerings? Priest. At thy feet we lay them, Flowers from the chaste, the huntsman's spear and shaft, And cakes, the timid offering of a slave, Who for libation poured abundant tears, And prayed protection from her master's will. Art. Nor shall she want it. Heaven o'erwhelm the man, Who with unholy purpose dares o'erstep The sad defenses of captivity. What hast thou else? Priest. An arrow tipped with flame, All vibrant with the light of shining gold, For thee, the fairest. Art. From his hand it comes! The Athenian youthâhas he then passed this way? Priest. With eyes averted he approached the shrine At early dawnâupon his buskined feet The dew shone pearl-like, in his locks as well. The breeze scarce stirred their golden cinctured wealth, His eye and cheek were fresher than the dawn. Aurora, passing in her purple car, Stooped to caress them, every god looked down, And envied Artemis her worshipper. Art. So young, so wise? with eyes averted came he? Relate his words, as thou art wont to do. Priest. He seemed intent upon the holy rite, For long he stood and bowed his head before thee, But taking voice at last, with ringing speech: âArtemis, reign within this heart forever! Thou art the chosen goddess of my faith.â He cried: âOh! take my life ere other love Than thine, profane the breast I vow to thee!â Art. And then he passed? Priest. A bugle note did sound From the green-roofed recesses of the wood, And reverent he departed. Art. 'Tis enough. [Priestess retires, with Virgins] The gods have written that Hippolytus Die young, but I will intercede with Jove To stretch the golden spanning of his years To utmost bound of Fate. Then, what's too short In length of days, I'll piece with length of fame. Immortal love shall hedge thy path about. The evil shall not taint thee with their breath, Nor to vile passion bend thy hero soul. And dying, thou shalt live before men's eyes, The fairest thing remembered as a man. Come hither, Priestessâcome, ye virgin bands! Ourselves are harnessed for the chase to-day, And we must find our quarry in the woods Before the heats compel to bower and bath. Sound out our summons! What? Away, away. Scene 2: The woods. Enter Aphrodite, R. Aphro. My sister doats on this Athenian youth, Hated of me, whose mother brought him forth In savage spots, and reared him in the wilds, A stranger to my venerable rule, Which he is bold to mock at and contemn. Be not too sure, chill-bosomed Artemis! Ice melts not ice, but ice doth melt at will When fire leaps out to quench its frostiness. BewareâI weave a plot thou canst not know, And in a corner where thine eyes reach not The embers burn that shall consume thy joy. I'll raise the love-sick Phaedra from her couch With the sweet venom of a flatterer's tongue. She shall encounter him who fires her soul, And scorch his marble manhood with her flame; For 'tis against Jove's promise that her suit Should conquer mine, who am invincible. So, Dian, take your pleasure in the woods, So, friend, be strong, and conquer Aphrodite. [Exit, L. Enter Hippolytus, in hunting dress, R.] Hipp. Whichever way I thread the woods to-day Doth a white garment flutter in my sight, That then eludes my seekingâ'tis most strange. When first the stag awoke, and swept away, Crushing the boughs before him, this appeared, As though one were before me in the chase, And hither, thither must I follow it, Following the beast that takes the water now, Now dashes to the blue and distant hills, Till the hot drops stand out upon my brow, And my vexed soul's at fault. What ho! hillo! I'll follow till I see the face of her Whose daring steps between me and my prey. [Exit, L. Enter Polydorus and Thenexetes, R.] Poly. Witch-haunted are the woods. An hundred times I've seen, methought, the shadowy Amazons, Whom Theseus slew, disporting through the boughs. I've felt an anxious trampling in the air, A rustling, as of winds in women's hair, Yet one finds nothing. Were it well, think you, That we should pour libations to the gods? Then. 'Twere very well, so there were wine enough, That we should pour a second to ourselves. If not enough for both, the gods can wait. These fancies, Polydorus, only come Of fasting, and th' untempered morning air. Our lord is young and eager, but for me, I'd rather have his venison than his sport. Poly. Fie, thou gross-bellied lounger, stay at home, To turn the chestnuts buried in the coals, Or help the housewife wind her tangled wool, Or, at the bravest, brace thy forces up To try a bold encounter with the cock. Who singled thee to follow Theseus' son? Then. I am as good to follow, friend, as thou, When dinner's called. [A shout is heard] Poly. The prince doth call us now. [Exeunt, L. Enter Hippolytus, R.] Hipp. This morning's chase doth baffle human skill; Almost I could be weary. Artemis, Assist my strivingâwere't not shame to thee I came, without a gift, before thy shrine? [Enter Artemis, C.] Art. Who calls the froward huntress of the wood, Haughty and wild? Fair youth, praise other godsâ To Aphrodite give thy voice, to her, The smiling goddess of delight. Invoke Hera or Pallas, who have might with Jove; 'Twere pity thou shouldst waste thy vows on her Who hath the single grace of chastity. Hipp. But that thy looks belie thy thoughtless words, We who ne'er met before, should part in anger. Thus much at leastâgrow reverent in thy speech, Who'er thou art, when things so holy move it. Art. Speak on. I'll hear thee on the theme thou lovest. Hipp. My mother was the lofty Amazonâ Wedded by Theseusâshe bequeathed to me Her worship, dearer than my father's fame. But much I marvel, now I look on thee, Thou shouldst impede the praise of her whose seal Is set upon thy gracious countenance. Thou wearest the very garb of Artemis, The garments white, the vest of starry fur, Stript from the tigerâsee, the moonÃ¨d shield, The quiver, braced against the hardy breast, The knotted hair the morning's breeze doth fill. And over all, as moonlight in the skies, The presence of the high, immortal gift That Jove made hers forever! Thou art silent, Say, hast thou seen her! Doth this make thee bright Beyond thy peers, that she hath looked on thee? Where doth she hide, when her fair footsteps deign To touch this humble earth? What shade so blest That one with duteous eyes might visit it Afar, and with bowed heart, and bated breath, Attend her passing? Shew me such a place And I will borrow Hermes' wingÃ¨d heels To seek it, and Apollo's high-tuned lyre To praise her with the cunning of a God. Art. Let deadly terror seize the heart of him Who would aspire to see what thou dost name. Know'st thou that men have been so rash? Hipp. I do. Art. Let me so ring the warning in thine ears That in thy purpose it shall sink and stay. The Elian shepherd nursed this fearful thought; Three nights he cried: âOh! Artemis, appear!â The fourth, his prayer was heard. In silver veil The goddess stoodâenvironed by the clouds White-fleeced, the flock she leads thro' summer nights; âUnveil!â he cried, and raised the impious hand, And stretched entreating arms to hold her fast. The veil was rent, the shepherd fell to earth, Transfixed with death and madness; dost thou tremble? Hipp. Now by my manhood, I am touched with awe, But fear I know not. Art. On his purple bier They laid the youth, with tender lilies strewn, While tears unfailing mourned his stricken bloom; And, as they bore him to the funeral pile, Men's lips did mutter: âShame on Artemis!â Hipp. Shame on such false reproachâa thousand shames! Was it not merciful that he did die? Art. This doth not fright thee? hear another tale. A huntsman, bold as thou, approached too near The lake where Dian quenched her virgin flame. Vainly the guardian nymphs did warn him off. âAway, the goddess takes her pastime here, Hers are these groves, these waters.â âIs she here!â He cried, and rudely thrust the boughs aside; But his offense the gods did not permit. The man saw not th' Immortalârooted fast, He stood a twenty-antlered stag, and lo, His very hounds did hunt him to the death, For which we hold them sacred evermore. Now tell me, is not Dian merciless? Hipp. I am too deep in holy Dian's love For change or turningâthou dost blame the gods For men's ill-doingâon a deed so rash What else could wait than deadly punishment? Hear what I tell thee. Once in trancÃ¨d sleep, Spellbound and dumb, I saw the goddess stand Before my couch. She turned and looked on me. âThou'rt mine,â she said, âI chose thee from thy birth.â She spake, and I was fain to rend the bonds Of sleep and cry, âI'll serve thee to the death.â Then had I sunk in terror, but that she Caught up my vehement striving with a smile, And passed without rebuke; since when, my heart Is all possest with her divinity. Art. Thou wilt be false to Artemis. Hipp. Thou sayest? Sooner will I betray my father's faith, And die an outcast, ruined in his wrath. [Enter Creon and others, R.] Creon. The stag's at bay. Hipp. Couple the hounds on him. Thou bring'st me fortune, gentle Amazon. Come, my good bow, I hold the prize in sight. To Artemis I vow this arrow's spoil. Art. [Springing past him] The goddess claims her own. [Exit, R. All are struck with astonishment] Hipp. What have I seen, what heard? Creon. Pursue her not. She is not human who did pass from here. Hipp. Oh! what a beast am I! how dull of sense! The goddess' self did stand and talk with me, And I withstood her. Creon. Like a form of dreams She passed. My lord, such things should move our fear. The gods are jealous; Aphrodite's wrath May dearly visit Dian's love on thee. Haste we, dear friend, to leave this haunted ground, And with quick offerings supplicate the gods, Forestalling anger. Hipp. As thou wilt, appease them! My offering's made. I saw her and I live. Oh! should an hour of dark foreboding come To try my virtue with some deadly snare, Remember, her fair eyes did answer thine, And grow a hero thus, Hippolytus. [Exeunt, R. Music. Enter Phaedra and Oenone] Phaed. You have heard my spoken passion, in your face I see it. When the fever loosed my tongue, You stood to catch the secret I had kept Else, to the death. Oenone. My faithful zeal deserved To have heard it long agoâyet, dearest child, I know but halfâwithhold not what remains. Recount to me each act and circumstance, That gave this deadly passion leave to grow. Phaed. Oh! shame, whose innocent blush has left my cheek To waste with deeper fires, stand back awhile, And let me give my bosom-secret room! Thou know'st how coldly I was wed, Oenone, Dropt like an apple from the parent bough To Theseus' asking hand. I left my home Thinking to wend so passionless through life, But Aphrodite willed it otherwise, And through my bridal vesture sent a shaft That rankles here forever. As thou knowest, King Theseus bade I should attend the games Attired in splendour. Oenone. As I well remember. Did he not cry: âLet Athens see, this once, The royal beauty Theseus takes to wife?â And thou wert perfect, as he said, my child, In all thy form. Phaed. How listlessly I sate And saw the wrestlers close in tug and strain, And saw the horses, coupled to the car, Loosed from the starting-point, with stride and bound, And marked the contest thro' my half-shut lids, Dreaming of scenes familiar. But a shout Went pealing from the eager crowd to Heaven, And something whispered: âPhaedra. rouse thyself; See what is now before thee.â As I looked, A form Elysian leapt into the car Whose movements scattered beauty as the stars Shed lightâa countenance divinely fair, A brow of glory unattainable. I gazedâall else seemed blotted from the world; But when the circling steeds had borne him round, And victor at the goal he stood and smiled, Then came the pang of death. They brought the youth Close to my feet, and Theseus, well content, Said, âPhaedra, crown my son!â From my cold hand The chaplet dropt, and I sank withering down, The daylight blurr'd before meâonly this Of all my pleasure broke to utterance, The cry, âRemove him ever from my sight!â And he was exiled from my presence, he To kiss whose feet I would have dragged myself In the extremity of death. Thou'st heard My dreadful tale; despise me as thou wilt. Oenone. Know, royal Phaedra, thou art innocent! The gods inflict the torment of thy love. Thy struggling heart doth speak thee free of guilt. Some awful, some most costly sacrifice Shall win th' immortals, and appease the pain That thou resistest. Phaed. I resist no more. Hear me, and know my ill past remedy. When I lay down upon my bed to die, With folded palms, I was almost content, Death-weary with the struggle of my soul. Ev'n there a thought supreme in joy and crime, A hope most horrible in fruit or failure Found me: could but the prince return thy love, It said, one happy hour were worth the rest. And this doth drag me from my passive couch, Doth send me wild before the universe, Hurled like Fate's arrow pointed at his heart, To find but that, and have no errand more. Oenone. And you are here, in this unusual garb, The prince abroad and like to choose this way? Phaed. Thou hast said it. Oenone. Then prevention comes too late And love for love is only remedy. I hear a voice, a stepâ Phaed. [Throws herself on Oenone's breast] 'Tis his, Oenone. Hide me awhile. Oenone. This grove shall give us time To watch the favored moment. Phaed. [Pushing her behind the trees] Stand thou thus. I must observe him. [She stands half hidden. Enter Hippolytus and Creon, R.] Hipp. [Walking across the stage] Dost thou think, my Creon, These woods may guard such holy things unseen As only dreams can show us? Creon. Good, my lord, I do not dream as thou dost. Hipp. Wherefore not? Creon. Being but a common serviceable man, Whose sinews, worn apace with following you, Are like a ploughman's in the bond of sleep. The gods I thank, who leave my couch in peace, Sending no earlier vision than the dawn. Hipp. Jest as you will, my Creonâstill believe Such things are near us, though we see them not. Until some wonder makes us 'ware of them. The goddess of my faith attends my steps, Keeping the passioned ills of life away, And with the glory of her countenance, Enforces the vowed purpose of my soul. [Exeunt Hippolytus and Creon] Phaed. He's gone. Ah! Gods! I could not speak to him. Oenone. Shall I not call him back? Phaed. I charge thee, no. There is in him a coldness so divine That it should teach a virgin modesty, And, turned against my vexed and angry soul, Fall on it with the doomÃ¨d weight of death. Oenone. Speak not of death; why shouldst thou sink and yield, When bolder counsels blossom to success? There's not a tree among the whispering pines But could disclose as wild a tale as thine, If it had speech. The heavens are merciful. Ev'n night, the Argus with unnumbered eyes, Keeps what we trust to him. So, dearest child, Lift thy fair head and hearken in thine ear. I have a friend at Aphrodite's shrine, A wizard who can bid the stars turn back And wait his pleasure. Every augury Of earth and air he knows, with awful words Unwilling wrung from dead Aegyptian lips, Stifled with balsams. Thither let us go With costly gifts; the heavens shall lend some sign To help us further. Phaed. [With sudden animation] Aphrodite's shrine! Ev'n while thou speak'st, the lightning of my thoughts Leaps there, and falls before her, asking low The grace of her who is invincible. [Exeunt] ACT II. Scene 1: Temple of Venus. Priest and Leton. Leton. Remove these entrails. By my art, I see One great in rank comes hither: give me leave To deal with her. Priest. The sacrifice is mine To offer for the rest, I give you way. I love the incense, and the prayer that soars Upon its cloudy wings; when victims bleed The pitying gods are present to my sense, That with mild foreheads contemplate the rite, Remitting deadly penalties to man. But you have other thoughts, have wit and words To snare the secrets of men's hearts, and bind Their thoughtless steps with bonds of vigilance. Leton. Thou know'st my cunning doth enrich the shrine More than thy virtue; thou dost watch the gods, While I watch men; thou wait'st for miracles, And I have done them, ere thou look'st again. But hist! the supplicants are at hand. Stay thou! I will not yet appear. [Withdraws behind the altar. Enter Phaedra closely veiled and Oenone, L.] Priest. [Greeting them] Have welcome here. Phaed. [To Oenone] Do thou bestow the offerings with the priest, And give me room to vent my heart awhile. Oenone. Twelve sheep of faultless fleece my mistress gives, A flock of doves, a chlamys, wrought with gems And flexible gold, to honor Aphrodite. Priest. Such gifts betoken wealth and fervent worship. Who's she that doth so instant need our helps? Oenone. One high in all deserving; ask no more. The sheep stand bleating at the temple's porch. [Exeunt Priest and Oenone, L.] Phaed. [Flinging herself at the feet of the statue of Aphrodite] Goddess of love! thou source of all delight, Source of all anguish; thou with joy and woe Swayed in thy hand the might of Jove himself. Hear me, a supplicant; see my queenly rank Trailed in the dust before thee; my high heart Poured out in weeping, and my frantic hands Clasping thy vesture through these mortal pangs That rend my bodily life in twain. O goddess, Before whose power my soul lies motionless, Smite with an equal blow the haughty breast Of him I love, in sympathetic pain. Move him to seek me; keep the heavens in pause For one blest moment that shall make him mine. Then, let the savage Furies work their will, Who have in all their scourges no such pang As unrequited love. Write down my vows! Give me one hour to please Hippolytus, Thereafter let me perish! Leton. Thou shalt please him. Phaed. [Shrieks] Help, help, Oenone! Leton. Let one further word Escape thy frantic lips, and thou art lost. I am the help that Aphrodite sends. Past prayer and hoping; while the moments press Hear my quick counsel: woo with smiles and favours, Not with that frowning brow of grief. What man Would kiss thro' tears, or to his bosom press A form convulsed as thine in agony? Let fair adornment set thy beauty forth, Untimely withering; let a feast be spread, And bid him, thoughtless, to its secrecy. Once there, thou know'st how wines intoxicate, How flowers and odors bind the subtle sense; Watch but the moment, at thy feet he lies To rise no more but shorn and love-enthralled. Dost thou hear me? Phaed. Slowly thy words pierce through The veil of madness that o'erhangs my thoughts; But dost thou know me, that thy hardy tongue Bids a king's daughter stoop to arts like these? Leton. Have not the pangs that thou bewailest taught thee King's daughters are but women in Love's sight? Phaed. This have I learned in such humility As shames the distant glories of my birth. [More confidentially] But he I pine for is so virgin cold No woman's heart can snare, nor beauty move him. Ev'n could I win him to a moment's speech, He would but look on me in wonderment; I could not touch him with my burning heart, Nor he, with icy calmness, quench its flame. Leton. Then let me give his life into thine hand. I have a philter an Egyptian priest Sold dearly to my askingânot Medea Has such a potion. In this shining drop, Showing phial As in a star, doth love's sweet madness hang. This mingle in a cup of choicest wine, And watch its working. Does he taste the draught, Thy heart's desire is thine. Wilt thou pay its price? Phaed. [Gives her ornaments] Take these twin jewels, and this heavy chain, This purple broidered mantle, clasped with gold; And other gifts more excellent I'll send thee; Take all I have, and give it. Leton. Thou must promise That I shall counsel all thy future acts In furtherance of this purpose. Phaed. This I promise. Leton. Have then thy wish! [Gives the phial and exit, L.] Phaed. Oh! joy too terrible For words! Oenone, dear Oenone, help me. [Oenone comes at her summons] Lend but thy veil. [Envelopes herself in it] From Aphrodite's shrine Shall the king's daughter like a beggar go, Stript of adornment, one whom love makes poor To crown her with a glory of his own. [Exeunt] Scene 2: The woods. Twilight. Enter Artemis, then Aphrodite, L. Art. A deadly danger waits on Theseus' house, And him whom this unpassioned heart holds dear. I could be swift to warn him, were it not That jealous Aphrodite all these hours Keeps instant watch; her power, allowed of Jove, Baffles my helpful working; would he came Where I, unseen of her, might speak with him! Aphro. Thou shalt not mar my counsels, hindering maid, Keep thy cold madness for the midnight damps. This hour is mine, bestowed of Jove supreme, Who wears my shining cypher on his brow. [Points to the star] Art. Give leave, good sister; let me succour one Whom all the gods have cause to love. Aphro. Save one. He, the rude offspring of an Amazon, Forgets to honour Aphrodite's shrine. 'Tis written; he shall honour her or die. Art. He passes yonder; stand aside, I pray, For I must speak to him. Aphro. He shall not hear One word of thine. What? could not Pallas win, Nor Jove's great queen, the shepherd Paris from me, And thou wilt cross my power? Be still, I say, For well he goes where I have bidden him. [Aphrodite binds her scarf around Artemis] Art. Hippolytus! Go not to Phaedra's feast! Aphro. Thou seest he hears thee not. Art. Drink not the wine She pours for thee! Aphro. Now that, by heav'n, he shall! He's gone, and I release thee; go thy ways, Since over Phaedra's palace I have set My sentinel, that none of thine may enter, Go take thy wonted sport by wood and wave, And hear the far-off laughter of the gods, That follows her who strives with Aphrodite. Art. The gods command thee not, if help of thine Can wait on deeds so evil. Aphro. We and they Alike are servants of the Fate unseen, Before whose mandates Jove himself is still. [Exeunt, R. Enter Hippolytus and Creon, L.] Hipp. The unclouded joys of youth are leaving me, And unfamiliar shadows to my soul Gather unbidden. I have been a child Until to-day, a painted holiday boat, Becalmed in sunny harbours of delight; But now the wind springs up, and far to sea, The untried countries show their solemn shores That wait my visitation. Friend, no more Will I outweary thee with speed and stride Unmeasured; from henceforth, I'll task thy mind And not thy sinews. Creon. Yet my gracious prince Was ever counted wise beyond his years In all men's judgments. Hipp. I allow thy love That would be falsehood from another's tongue. True, I had noble nurture: at his knee My grandsire, Pirrheus taught me poet's song And sages' maxims; but the froward child Was happiest when the grave discourse was o'er, And he might hunt the wood bee to his hive With other urchins. Now the old man's words Come back, pathetic, to meâwhat he spake Of hero-virtue, of the unsleeping Fates. And the unflinching soul that masters them. Creon. What moves my prince to this unusual strain? What omen has disturbed you? Hipp. Since the gods Have talked with me, I see another light Upon the world I walk in. We that sit So smooth upon its surface, have no hold On its possessions. He that reigns may lose His kingdom; he that wars may lose his life; And we that love may lose the dearest joy Our heart can boast of, while we draw our breath. Thou call'st me wise, but, see, until this hour The thought ne'er came that he who stays so long, My father, might have human fate, and die. Creon. Who dives beneath the sea to bring up sorrow? The gods benevolently veil the face Of every evil, till its time has come, And we, with sunshine blinded, go to meet What, known before, had whelmed us from our birth. Hipp. Why, see, thy argument runs close to mine. It is the fear of such an unseen ill Doth sharply pierce the armour of my youth. Dispute it, Creon, say it could not be, And let me walk as I did walk before. Creon. I do believe, your father's ways are well, Whose life in every step was victory. But he is long unseen, and in his absence The city plunges like an unreined steed Missing his rider, while in treacherous hearts A ferment stirs, that brings the scum to surface. The moody queen, they say, hath left her couch, And wanders in the suburbs with her nurse, Of whom we should take note, as one whose plots Have wrought the sole misfortune of your life. There is the danger, sure and tangible. Beware her machinations! Hipp. 'Tis most strange That one I know not is mine enemy. Whom, when I met, such sudden hatred seized Of all my person that, without one word Fall'n from my lips, she craved of Theseus' love, New-plighted then, my instant banishment. Creon. Does this surprise you? Such is jealousy As women feel it, free of reason's sway. Your mother, that once boasted Theseus' love, Tho' dead, was Phaedra's enemy; and you Heir to the throne, or ere her heir was born, Were foe to him and her. Hipp. If this were so, One word should set her frantic heart at rest, Since Theseus lives, and never wish of mine Hath gone beyond him to his heritance. Creon. She was as fair as morning when she came, Freighting the Cretan galley with her bloom And countless dower; yet when she stept to land, A cloud came o'er the city's smiling brow That hangs there yetâthe horror of her race Did move men's hearts to ask what deity Had blinded Theseus' eyes, that he should wive With one whose mother is the scorn of women. Hipp. No word of that, my Creon! what was done By noble Theseus, that the gods approve. Nor hath our human pity juster leave To vent itself than when a guiltless soul Sinks beneath crimes ancestral, since 'tis so That men will see the parent in the child. Chiefest of all I thank the gods for this: That they did make my mother virtuousâ Who knocks so soft? [Enter Messenger, L.] Mess. A message from the queen. Hipp. The queen to me? You have mistook your way. Good friend, I know you not. Mess. You are the prince Hippolytus, great Theseus' son, to whom His sorrowing wife sends greeting, bidding you To sup with her at nightfall. Hipp. Do my ears Teach me aright? To sup with her to-night? Mess. So runs the message I was laden with. Creon. Go not, my prince! With some unblest intent She woos you to her presence. Mess. Sire, be kind. The queen doth own offenses towards your grace, Based on false rumours of your enmity. But now that Theseus' absence makes her weak, With thin-spun hope and patience drawn to end, She asks your generous nature to forget The past displeasures, and to comfort her With Theseus, in the presence of his son. Hipp. He has other children. Mess. Of such tender age, They can but ask relief, not answer it. [Hippolytus muses] Creon. [To Messenger] Why, this is strangeâothers still thank the queen In no fond fashion, for this gracious form, Twice banished yearlong from her loving sight, To please thy mistress. Fie! To sup, to taste, Perhaps, a morsel that shall quiet him From hunger pangs hereafter! Hipp. Hold thy peace, Creon, nor rudely taunt a messenger With those who send him. Bring the queen this word: Albeit no woman's banquet pleasures me, Vowed to deny them, I will wait on hers For peace and kindred's sake, that she may see How little rancour settles in the heart Whose lineage comes of hospitable blood. Say more: If in the future, I can aid Her need by timely zeal and furtherance, That let her seek, and name the past no more. Mess. May thoughts so generous be their own reward! I leave you, sire. [Exit Messenger, L.] Creon. My prince, you shall not go. Some double purpose lurks in all her ways; What now she asks, hereafter she'll malign. Hipp. Creon, I could be angry with thy counsel, But that 'tis love misleads theeâshould I slight The wife of Thesus, though mine enemy? Creon. Be wroth, but go notâshe is beautiful As she is wicked. Hipp. If the queen be fair, Mine eye should wrong her, that should note so much, Against her matron wishes. Be she false, True heart doth conquer evil augury. Creon. What shield have heroes 'gainst a woman's arts? Ask the old legends! Hipp. Fool! thou hast not seen What armour hangs beneath these idle folds. My shield is here withinâa love divine Hath shed its silver sheen o'er all my breast, Making Hippolytus invincible. [Exeunt, L.] Scene 3: A banqueting room. A table, with gold, etc. Phaedra reclines under a canopy, R.H. Oenone stands near her. Soft music. Phaed. The board is piled, the beakers crowned with flowers, The music hath foretold the hour of joy; I put it from me, listening for a sound More subtle sweet, the music of his step, As he draws near me, near me; will he come, Think you? Oenone. Indeed, you were no sovereign else. Phaed. He durst not slight the daughter of a king, Though, like a slave, she crouch before his feet. Oenone. Who enters? Phaed. 'Tis our dark-browed messenger. I like him not. Oenone. Ay, but he's serviceable. Phaed. How fared your errand? Give its end, I pray; Speak, will he come? Mess. That will he, by my faith. Now if he 'scape thee, I will grow devout, Since nothing but a god can snatch him hence. Phaed. He comesâstand back, but answer to my call. [Exeunt Messenger and Oenone, L.] He comesâye Lydian flutes, twine sweeter measures Than ever knotted round a soul with love; Glimmer, ye tapers; flowers, your softest sigh Yield to the ravished senseâhe is at hand! [Hippolytus enters, stands on threshold L.H.I.E.] Hipp. Upon this sacred threshold I salute The spouse of Theseus, who did call me hither. Phaed. Wait not so far for idle ceremony; But, if thou com'st in peace and friendship, Seat thee beside her. Hipp. [Advancing a little] He you honour thus Is strange at feasts, a simple savage man, Trained to the chase, and waiting for the years That shall unfold the hero-sport of war. Phaed. Still will you stand? Come near, Hippolytus, Nor cross my pleasure with that froward brow. You take me for a stepdame harsh and cold; Look in this face, and read me otherwise. Hipp. Your words are flattering. Phaed. No, my words are true. Come hitherâmust I wrong my state, and stand To do you honour, who refuse the same? Hipp. In no wise. I am here but to obey Your bidding. Phaed. Sit then, ere we pour the wine, For you shall pledge me to great Theseus' health, Whose likeness in your features comforts me. Hipp. [Seating himself] My father's absence is become a grief To them that love him. In those savage wilds Who knows what ills, what danger he has met? But that 'twere impious to think the gods Could him abandon; impious e'en to doubt That his right hand compels deliverance, I could, at times, remember that my father Is mortal, and despond of his return. Phaed. I set my ban upon such evil thoughts. Why should he not be well, since we are so That bear a life more fragile? Look not so, But smile, and give my folly room so long That I may count the features that I love In Theseus. First, the lofty brow, and hair Blacker than night, when torches show its hue. The magical eye, a well of tenderness, Lit with Olympian fire, the heavy lashes Set as a bristling spear-row for defense, But yielding to love's watchword heav'n's delight; The sharp-set nostril, with its marble flukes, The mouth that Aphrodite could not pass Untempted, whence mine eyes, o'ercome of thine, Sink to the silken meshes of the beard. One moment let me look upon you thus, And think the thing I worship is before me. Hipp. You paint in me my father's lineaments, And thus you crown me higher than my thoughts, But in the portrait you've omitted that Whose absence wrongs us both. Phaed. What should that be? Hipp. The lofty mind, and honourable soul No siren could seduce from nobleness. Phaed. A chill doth seize me. Hipp. Since we're met to praise The godlike Theseus, let us name his deeds, Whose glory puts his beauty out of sight: That were a theme for tongues more skilled than mine, Yet it commands my strivingâthink, this man, Born of a king, but left unrecognized, Did with his kingly sword so vindicate His high begetting that not one alone, But all the monarchs of the earth might leap To claim him as true heir of royalty. Think of the wilds enfranchized of their fears, Of tyrants slain, of monsters hewn to earth, Conflicts whereat the stars of Heaven stood still, And charioteering Day, in shining mail, Stooped from his course to bid the hero hail! Think of this city, ransomed from the waste, Girt with rich fields, endowed with noble laws, Adorned by Theseus as a queenly bride, Then tell me, how shall praise come up with him, Or how my loitering steps shall overtake The pledge she gave, who bore me as his son. Phaed. The music of thy voice commends a theme That has its sorrow to a sister's heart, Since all the glories thou didst name, recall The blot that mars them, Ariadne's fate, Beloved, betrayed, abandoned. Hipp. Name it not, The single blemish on so great a name; Or, if thou wilt, deplore the adverse Fates That urged the unwilling fault. Phaed. Is there a god Doth smile upon a loving woman scorned? Thou'rt silent? Nay then, listen, while my slave, Cunning in implements of song, shall weave The glowing garland of your father's fame To crown us as we sit. Now, sound the lyre, And press the plectron sharply, till the chords Answer its wounds with wailing. [Gives the wine] Hipp. A martial measure suits a soldier's praise. Leton. I pray you, let me vary as the theme Demands, since even the strength of hero-souls Is woven of fibres endless intricate. Phaed. Will't please you drink? Hipp. The song shall first refresh. [Phaedra nods to Leton, who recites the following strophes, to faint music] Young Theseus from his father's house goes forth To conquer him who mixed The brute's distemper with the sense of man. With tears, the father's arms Loose from his well-belovÃ¨d neck. Often His mother prays, âNow make thy kingship sure.â The fated ship sets sail. Followed with sobs that shake the firmament, While youths and maidens, that return no more, Cast unavailing looks, And funeral flowers, backward to the shore, Sighing, âRemember us!â They reach the Cretan isle. Grim Minos counts the tribute. âThou,â he says, âArt Aethra's son? But not a king thy sire? Else why thine heirdom risked with vulgar blood?â âMy deeds,â the youth replied, With leaping words, âShall show my fatherhood.â Hipp. A noble strophe, friend, here's gold for thee! Phaed. You break the musicâpray you hear him through. Leton. [Music] The king's fair daughter stood To see the captives; meeting Theseus' eyes, Such pity smote her heart That from her window, as he went to death, She flung the silken coil To guide him, and her father's keen-edged sword. Ye know the deed he wrought,â The monster, as he sprang In his own entrails sheathed the murderous steel: With fiercely knotted limbs And writhings ineffectual, he lay Wasting his hated life, The while, with lightened heart, Greece shook the shameful tribute from her brow. Hipp. I thank again. Phaed. Sweet prince, I pray thee, hearken. Leton. [Music] But where is she Who gave the fatal help, the coil Whose tangles overthrew her own free steps? Love ravished for a day, Forgotten ere its close. On desert crags she sits and lengthens out Her hair dishevelled; that her hand may twist From its own wealth, the cruel braid of death. O tuneful lips, give voice, O gentle souls, respond To pangs that wring her bosom, love-betrayed! Thro' all the blue below Wander her mazÃ¨d eyes, that seek the ship Of him who comes no more. Phaed. [Aside to Oenone] He saddensâpity gains his gentle heart! Leton. From her soft foot, she flings The silken shoe, that sets its beauty off; She parteth clasp and band To tear the rosy beauty of her breast, Until its bleeding match the inward wound! Faint sinks she on the sands; the very beasts Move mournful round her, and a god descends Bearing the bitter wine, The dear-bought joy of death. Oh! never to a loving heart, Bared at thy feet, deal thou the stab of scorn, Lest it should bring thee woe Hereafter, and the music of thy life Halt fearful at the shriek The vexÃ¨d soul sends back From the chill bosom of Persephone. Ye who are loved in youth Hold fast the passing treasure that the Fates So swiftly use to waste; Match love's endeavor with the quick embrace, Since this supremest bliss Alone doth move the envy of the gods. Hipp. [More and more moved by the song] Alas that such a deed was ever done! Phaed. [To Oenone] His manhood softensâsee, his forehead sinks Heavy with sorrow not his own, while tears Brimming his eyes, o'erflow his beauteous cheeks, Like brooklets wandering down enamelled fields. This is the momentâgive the wine cup here, Then leave us. [Bearing the wine to Hippolytus] Now shall generous wine dispel The shadows that obey the call of song. Let Bacchus smile, and June look benign, But most of all, let Venus, child of foam, Smile radiant on the foam-crowned cup, and twine Its beaded drops, like pearls about her throat Celestial; so shall heavenly madness sit Deep in the liquorâyou shall taste it first. Drink, I entreat you. Hipp. No, I will not drink! Phaed. For courtesy! Hipp. I will not drink, I say! What rites unblest are these you celebrate? Why did they leave us? some ill charm is here, That steals into the fortress of a man, And makes his fancies traitors to his faith. Hence with these garlandsâtake the wine awayâ Absolve me from this sick and perfumed air That breeds disorder in a healthful brain. Your music is pernicious, let it ceaseâ Pluck back that curtain. [He pulls back the curtain, the moon is seen] Ah! I see her now, The goddess of my vows in moonÃ¨d state. Dian from yonder cloud doth beckon me With solemn warningâyes, I follow thee Unaltered; do not frownâI only stay To fling before thy feet the fevered cup They force on me, and with my manhood's might, To answer, âHail!â All hail to Artemis! [Flings down the cup, and exit, C.] Phaed. Stay, I entreat thee! Do not leave me thus! Oenone! [Enter Oenone] Follow thou! He went in anger. Hang on his cloak, plead piteous in his face, And with warm breath compel him back to me. Oenone. Where shall I seek him! Phaed. That way. [Clouds pass over the moon] Oenone. 'Tis too late. I see no trace of himâthe heav'ns grow dark, And from yon parapet of cloud, the moon Frowns sullen, with a fixed indignant glare. Phaed. 'Tis she I cannot name, who from the skies Wages unequal warfare with my suit. Stay till I curse thee, cold, vindictive maid! If things celestial stood within our reach, My vengeance should not wait before thy power. TABLEAU ACT III. Scene 1: A vestibule in Phaedra's palace. Leton. How poor a thing can foil our best device! This peevish youth escaped me by a hair, A slender thread of accidentâwhat then? Shall I give up the ruin that I plot For him and his? Not soâhis fate hath slept, But I will wake it. Jealous Acheron, Lend me thy Furies, coupled on with speed, Until I track him to thy jaws, whose heart Ne'er honoured Aphrodite. SoftâOenone! [Enter Oenone] How fares thy mistress? Oenone. Ill indeed, good friend. The hope that lifted lets her further down, So in the pit of grief she lies and moans, Calling the gods to end her wretched days. Leton. I have a medicine shall stay her ill, A plan most fit to help her. Oenone. What can help A soul so wrought? Her thoughts are turned to death. Leton. That suits not with my purposeâdost thou think This boy, this innocent, shall foil my skill Ripened in many summers? Bring me straight To speech with her, and I shall show you both The contest's but begun, the prize is free; And I have arts that summon victory From Heaven's high justice to the side I serve. Oenone. If thus thou counsellest truly, follow me. [Exeunt] Scene 2: A room in the palace, 3.G. Enter Creon, L.H. Creon. Hippolytus has met a ghost, or looked On the dim features of a coming ill, So spiritless he leaves his couch, this morn, So fall'n the high complexion of his youth. Heaven send him safe from Phaedra's cunning hands! Could e'er his goddess stoop to watch and aid, That were the moment when he went to her. But see, he comes; now, whatso'er his grief, It must lie deep but I shall win to it. [Enter Hippolytus, R.H.] Hipp. I greet thee, Creon, with a clouded brow That wrongs the love I bear thee; but my heart Has deeper burthen than such love to-day. Friend, we are fallen upon doubtful times That tend to evil. Creon. Such is every time. This has grown hateful with thy father's stay In unknown regions. Sure, that fault shall mend. The days of absence shall be counted soon. And Athens, kindled with one flame of joy, Shall flash again the glory of his smile. Why should you doubt it? Hipp. I dispute it not, ButâI am heavy-heartedâlet this passâ Another day I'll reason like myself. Creon. My love demands your sorrow as its right. Were you the king, you had not in your gift The treasure I should take in its exchange. For justice, then, unload this girded breast, And grant me half of all it hides; nay, more. When vague displeasures vent themselves in words, They are as gloomy clouds that fall in rain And then are nowhere in the face of Heaven. Hipp. Unwilling went I to a feast last night, Where courteous duty seemed to urge my way. Once there, the very air grew weird and strange, The music had an evil magic in it. The queen did seat me on a purple bed, In utmost stateâher lips were swift to weave A cunning chain of silken flatteries, While in the intervals of song, she pressed A fragrant wine cup. Creon. You were not so rash As taste it! Hipp. Ere the madness of the feast Could gain my senses, in my sudden thought, My father stood, and fixed his eyes on me, Pale and reproachfulâwith an instant strength, Breaking all bonds, I spurned the soft-spread couch, And ere the palsied lips of those around Could summon words to question me, I flung The wine untasted on the ground, and fled, Calling on Artemis. Creon. Oh! this was well. Hipp. 'Twas like a dream, and as a dream I see it. How came this sudden darkness on my soul, That scattered like a vapor, when my prayer Invoked the goddess? Creon. Often thus in sleep, The heart stands still for undiscovered fear, The stalwart muscles cannot stir, the tongue With agony unspeakable is dumb; The desperate possession at the last Forces a shriek, and, waking, you are free. Hipp. Ay, so it was. Creon. But dreams have warning in them. Dread thou the queen; ay, cross her bounds no more! Who knows what drugs and sorceries she keeps Of Cretan use and learning? In that cup Perhaps, she mixed a poison for the heir Of Theseus. Hipp. Such a thought I never harboured, But now you name it, 'tis most horrible! [A muffled sound behind the scenes] What sound is that without? [Enter a Herald dressed in black] Herald. Alas! my lord! I bring you mournful tidings. Hipp. Speak! Herald. Our realm The gods, as this one hearth, make desolate. The king, your father, is no more in life. Hipp. [Hiding his face] My father! Herald. Has encountered death afar. Hipp. O mortal pangâO father, what thou gavest In giving life, thou dearly takest now. Sharp beyond nature is the blow that rends This cherished bond in twain. Herald. The people wait To bring you duteous speech; thus runs their talk: âGreat Theseus we have lost, but Theseus' son Is ours to rule us nobly as himself.â Hipp. Bid them affront not my dead father's name By placing mine beside it. When the pyre, Fragrant with him, exhales its latest spark, Then only, let men think upon his son. For me, I am still in grief's astonishment, And cannot come to words, till tears have done. Creon. The days of vengeance are not yet fulfilled. Hipp. [Starting] Vengeance? Why, what a beast am I to sit Playing the woman, while the murderers Of such a man are tenants of the day! We will to arms, nor give our sorrow breath Until he be avenged. Thou messenger Of evil, who is he that slew my father? Although he dwell beyond the leaguÃ¨d clouds, His blood shall honour Theseus. Speak, what hand Hath done the impious deed? Herald. Alas, my lord, Your valiant purpose hath no wayâthe gods Of Styx, whose breathless realm he did invade, Aiding his friend, closed darkly in the rear; Grim Pluto holds him, and the leaden waves That bore him thither bring him no more back. Hipp. O ye sad deities, who swallow up The glories of the earth, shall this great prize Enrich your greedy bosoms ere its time? Had'st thou but died in battle, slaying wide, And heaping corses for your funeral pileâ But on this wise to fall! Infernal gods, Unroof to me your dark domainsâgive way, Give way before me, bloody Cerberus, And ye whose penances do make men stare With fearful thoughts at noonday, give me place! I'll plunge beneath the earth for Theseus' soul, And tear his bonds, that Hell shall sound again For terror, and the ghosts of Acheron Scatter like clouds before his rescued face. Creon. Sweet prince, your words are wild beyond your wont. You know not what you sayâyour duteous soul Is strong to suffer what the gods decree. Herald. The people wait, and will not be denied. [Going] Hipp. Creon, speak thou! Nay, I must be alone. [Exeunt Hippolytus, R.H., and Creon, L. Enter a deputation of the people] First Man. We greet the son of Theseus, at whose hands We seek the sole redemption of our loss, That he should take his father's sceptre up, And fit his youthful shoulders to the state, As did an elder, not a better man. Creon. Good neighbours, you are over quick with him. Sorrow must have its time. The crown you bring Is an ill medicine for an orphaned heart, And you and he are orphaned from this hour; The greatest man that trod the earth is dead. First Man. He was a hero! Second Man. Nay, a demi-god, The friend and peer of Hercules. Creon. Ev'n so. Then let us fitly mourn this mighty sorrow, And when the honours of the dead are paid, Your prince will not be wanting to your love. First Man. The city shall be given up to grief, And women shall not smile upon their babes, Until the prince's heart be comforted. [Exeunt Deputation by one door and Creon by the other. Enter Leton, leading Phaedra, clad in mourning] Phaed. So far I've come, by stronger will than mine, But when you leave me, I shall sink again, And from his lips a little scornful breath Shall sweep me out of sight. Leton. That must not be. Remember well my lessonsâoutward shame And inner boldness; like the new-shorn lamb, Be meek and patient in your proffering, But keep the lion crouching in your heart, To spring on him defenseless; you shall find His nature softened by this moment's grief, And all the metal of his soul aglow With sorrow's fervour. Strike, that he shall bear Your impress unto death. Phaed. Ah! Gods! he comes. [Exit Leton. Enter Hippolytus, musing] Hipp. I have not found a word of comfort yet In all their reasons. At the last, I bade That they should leave me, face to face with grief, Till his unloved companionship be grown Familiar, and endurance wait on use. [Perceiving Phaedra] Who's this? The queen! O madam, do you know Our mutual loss, that you stand strangely here? Phaed. Alas! What place so fit for me as this? Whither should Theseus' widow turn for aid, Unless to Theseus' son? Here at your foot I stand a suppliantâsince the hand of Fate Doth rend my state in twain, be gentle with me, And let this yet unwonted garb of woe Plead in my favour. Hipp. It were strange to me If I could aid you in this mournful time, Being myself transported out of sense By what I think on. If there be a good You prize beyond a hero's memory Explain it briefly. Phaed. Who but you can give The maintenance and order of my life? Your father's sovereign rank descends on you, And I, a queen but now, and queenly born, Sit in the dust, a thing of yesterday. Hipp. O madam, in a heavy hour like this, Such titles mock us with their emptiness. Sorrow is lord of peasant and of prince, And I attain an ancient heritage,â The heritage of tears. Phaed. Since it is thus, Be near me in these unaccustomed daysâ Since one ill fortune doth enwrap us both, Make we its burthen light by sharing it. By all that's kind and piteous, by the love You bore your father, do not suffer me To weep aloneâpress cooling on my brow; Answer my joyless eyes that seek him still With yours, and since his glories live in you, Redeem my deprivation with yourself. Hipp. How can this be? Phaed. Do you so coldly question? Is there no word whose fervour can unlock The ice gates of your bosom? Sister? Friend? Call me ev'n mother, if the name be dear. Hipp. Madam, my mother walks th' Elysian fields, And her chaste eyes to tears are marble-sealed. Phaed. Nay, then, I lift the veil, and show beneath My features as they areâHippolytus, 'Twas as a mask I put the mother on, With other love I love you. Hipp. Gracious gods! Phaed. You turn your face from me? Lend me your ears, For you must listenâI must speak, or perish. When first your beauty passed before mine eyes, The fatal flame was kindled, that henceforth Made devastate the wholesome ways of life. Nor queenly rank, nor kingly spouse availed, Nor mother's travail brought me mother's joy. The fever at my heart, like some wild thing, Did dry the milk of Nature from my veins, And made such havoc of my blooming youth, As wrongs my counted summers to the eye. Long stifled in the blackness of my heart, The secret leaps to voice and breath at last. Here, love-consumed, I sink before your feet, And clasp your knees for mercy. Hipp. [With sudden energy] Loose your hold, Or Heaven forgive me if I murder you! Phaed. Yes, shed my blood, but let me first pour out The death song of my passionâhark! I love Not as a girl, with fond and blushful shame, Nor yet like Argive Helen, free as fair, Passing from lip to lip like hireling's wine, And wooing tamely back the lord she wronged. I love thee with the power of earth and Heaven, And for thy love will pledge myself to Hell. Hipp. I have heard you speak. Now, in the face of Heav'n, I have a spotless fame to vindicate. What was't that fixed your wanton eyes on me? What was't that bade you dare what you have done? If in the armour of my constant soul, Or in the virtue of my unstained flesh, There was a spot could plead for such a purpose, Did it lie deeper than my bosom's core, I'd tear it out, and cast it to the dogs. Phaed. He scorns me. Hipp. Scorn thee? I am yet too new In deeds like these to give my horror name, But if there's something that should beggar scorn In hate and loathing, take it from my lips. [Phaedra follows him with a deprecating gesture] Nay, come not near me, lest the fear you reach Do make me strong and cruel, for methinks When Theseus banished monsters from the world, And spared your race, his task was half undone; He should have met you in his hero strength, And staying not for pity, should have hewn Thy beauty's venom from the ways of men. Phaed. I am dumb with shame and angerâsuch reproof Fits not such worship; ev'n the gods above Frown not so terrible on human love, Supremest Jove ne'er turned from woman thus. Hipp. Blasphemest thou? The gods requite thy thoughts With their own justice. [Going] Father, happiest thou, Where'er thou underliest the doom of death, Free of such shame, and from such infamy Timely escaped. [Exit Hippolytus] Phaed. What's this within my heart? A serpent stings, where late a wounded dove Lay panting. Here I knelt, a suppliant, And here he spurned me, broken at his feet, Like a mean potter's vase, whose shards should mock The care that gathered them. All's lost, but he, He is yet to lose. A braver music sounds Where late he crushed love's wailing melody. Come, arts of men, come, Furies, to my aid! And ye dumb walls, that gaze so horror-struck, Give hearing, while I curse Hippolytus. Curse on his haughty brow, and pitiless heart, Curse on his lip, whose frost belies its bloom, And the unnumbered beauties of his form, But curses most on her, the huntress-maid, Who sweeps him from me, mocking thro' the cloud. Gods, let her suffer what immortals can, Seeing the ruin of the thing they love. ACT IV. Scene 1: Phaedra's apartment. Enter from opposite doors, Leton and Oenone. Leton. How came thy mistress from the prince? Oenone. You shall not know her when you look on her, so Changed. Leton. Why, that bodes well. Oenone. If heavy heaping clouds Foretell the outpouring of the elements, From such a brow soul-wrecking storms should come. Leton. He has resisted then. I had not thought it. Has she said aught? Oenone. Nothing indeed of moment. She sits alone, and ponders, and her eyes Flash like an angry steel before her thoughts. Leton. Humph! I have news that shall astonish, But first I'll hear her speak. Oenone. What news, I pray? Leton. I told thee I had news for herâto thee I promised none. Oenone. I hear her voice within. Phaed. [Coming] Oenone, where's Oenone? Art thou here? Then call me Leton. Oenone. He is come but now. Phaed. Come hitherâstand before me, both of you. Tell me, Oenone, do I seem the same That pined, so white of cheek, but yesterday? Oenone. Nay, you are changed indeedâyour eyes on fire, Your pallor burning with an inward flame: You are ill, I think. Phaed. Not so; I have been ill, But now 'tis well with meâay, more than well. I thank th' ungentle cautery that seared My breast, but there is one must bleed for it, And ye, that were my ministers in love, Must bend your steps to follow my revenge, For that it comes, swift, sure, and terrible, My father's daughter owes my father's shade. Since Theseus' death doth leave my son supreme In Athens, while his tender years give space For me to hold his kingdom, know you not Of one whose life is dangerous to the state? How say you, Leton? Leton. Hear the news I bring Before you hear me: know your husband lives! Phaed. Theseus! Leton. Methinks I hear the joyful shouts That hail him. Phaed. Never let him find me living. Hide me, O Death! O Earth, unclose and hide From his stern sight. Oenone. What if the prince do first Possess his ear? Leton. [To Phaedra] Where then is thy revenge? Phaed. Here in my heart, that, shaken for a moment, Now hardens to resolve. Thyself shalt see That by thy lessons I have profited, For I will be beforehand with a tale Shall turn the discomposure of my mien Against the man I hate. Leton. Now, thou dost well, But let no sudden terror bend thy soul, For if thou falterest, thou art lost. Phaed. Ev'n so. Oenone. He comes! Phaed. Not yet! Oenone. The sounds draw near. Phaed. Then leave me. [Exeunt Oenone and Leton] Be bold, my forehead, think Hippolytus Did brand thee brazen with his scorn! [Enter Theseus, Phaedra advances to meet him] Phaed. My lord! Thes. Phaedra, 'tis thou? Here let me rest, at last, And find no change. A wanderer in far realms I come, rejoicing, to my household gods: But men who meet me start and stare, before They give me welcome. In the street, my son Stood where I passed, and changing, like a ghost, Cried: âFather!â and did turn his face from me, Till Creon plucked him by the sleeve, nor then Did he embrace me joyous as you were. No, no, you too are changed. Phaed. In what, my lord? Thes. I cannot tell, but 'twere, methinks, as well I had remained the guest of Hell, as come A stranger to my city. Phaed. Royal Theseus, You read our hearts amiss. Your rumoured death Hath drawn such bitter tributes from our eyes As doth unfit them for the sight of joy. Still we behold you between death and life, Uncertain which abides. But for your son, He thought you dead, and as he thought, he wished. Thes. My son! explain your meaningâit is dark. Phaed. So was his purpose. Scarcely had in Athens The accursed tidings of your death been told Ere he would gird him to ascend your throne. Nor there his daring stopt. These widow's weeds Could not protect the innocence they honoured. He sought me; by these feeble hands repulsed, He left me, breathing hatred and revenge. Thes. Keep me, ye gods, that I do not transcend My reason, in the madness of my wrath! O monster! Thou defam'st the ties of blood With such a crime, and still dar'st call me father? Lie at my feet, and bleed for thine offense That passeth punishment! What ho? my guards. [Soldiers appear] Summon the prince to Theseus' company. [Exeunt Soldiers] Phaed. Not here, my lord, not here! Thes. It shall be here: Where else should vengeance find him? Phaed. I entreat, If not for love, at least for modesty, Leave to depart. Thes. This curtain's fold shall screen Thy beauty from his false, lascivious eyes. There, hide thee, Phaedra, but no further go. You women, that so oft are cause of blood, Should learn to look on it. [He places Phaedra behind the curtain, and walks up and down in impatience] He does not come? He is not at present leisure. Am I grown So small a thing that I should wait for him? He comes. I'll feign awhile to question him. [Enter Hippolytus, L.] Come hither, sir, you seem to shun my sight, And when I passed unlooked for, thro' the streets, You were not quick, methought, to welcome me; Theseus is conscious of no ill-desert Towards youâfor which of his good offices Is't that you grudge his rescue from the shades? Hipp. My father! O my father! All the gods Witness the love I bear youâlet their shrines Attest my grateful offeringsâsurer yet Their eyes can read the gladness of my heart That thanks for this miraculous return, Beyond all gifts, beyond ev'n hope itself. Thes. You are well pleased to see me come again? You call me fatherâare you well assured That I so stand to you? Hipp. How otherwise? You are my father, by the sacred pledge Of nature, and the echo of your heart That thrills within my bosomâwere you not, A thousand benefits that crowned with peace My motherless youth should make you, in my sight, Most reverend of mankind. Thes. He names me so, And yet his wishes did detain me dead An hour agone. Hipp. Now, who durst tell me so, Father, should take the shameful words again Cleft to the throat. Thes. You had then no intent To seize my power? Hipp. Nor thought nor wish had I Beyond the sudden anguish of thy death, That left me orphaned of all human love. Thes. Rest of all love? And by what other name Didst thou invoke the false, adulterous flame That raised its daring to my marriage bed? Oh! now at last your cheek doth change its hue, And ghastly pallor blazons forth your crime. Hipp. I stand and sicken, I confess it true. To hear so vile a sin join names with mine; But that your lips should wed them, father mine, Is monstrous. Are you smitten of the gods With some strange frenzy, that you know me not? Thes. Have done with falsehoodâgive the truth, the truth! Hipp. Call that not truth, for which my loathing soul Shudders to be alive. Thes. Fool, dost thou think That thou alone wert knowing to the deed? Hipp. Who dares accuse me? Bring me face to face With such a one, that Innocence may turn And slay the treacherous slander with a look, Albeit I fear to wrong with such a doubt The basest human thing my foot could spurn. Speak, who accuses? Thes. [Draws back the curtain and shows Phaedra] She, the woman thereâ She, triply shielded from thine impious lust, Queen, wife, and widowâdidst thou think that she Should meekly sink thine insult out of sight, Like the first slave in the market? Hipp. O ye gods! Am I distraught, or do such visions wait On waking men, who know the thing they see? Thes. Dost thou stand speechless there, nor knowest my thoughts Run on thy blood, thy treacherous blood? Hipp. My father, If in thine heart no voice of Nature speaks, Strike! I have lived too long, for faith and love Are dead before me! Thes. Wilt thou kneel for grace? Hipp. [Strides to Phaedra] Look on me, madam, and look further on The heav'ns that see our deeds, whose thousand eyes Keep the still record of the things we shew, While they attest your words' solemnity. Speakâdo you thus accuse me to my father? [Phaedra slowly nods assent, supporting herself with the back of a chair] Thes. Thou art too bold. Hipp. Nay, then, I see it all. Since thou hast said it, by the fearful oath Of Jove, I bind thee to unsay it never: Not though thy heart rose shrieking to thy lips To loose the hateful burden with a breath; Not though thy thoughts should envy his repose, Whose innocent life shall pay the debt thou claimestâ But keep your cunning perfect to the end; Let Theseus find no hollow in your breast, Padded with falsehood; let no dream arise To scare the sleeping husband from your arms. Keep to your wordâwalk honoured to your grave, And with the heart you have, confront the gods! [Phaedra drops] Thes. She faintsâwas ever daring like to thine? Take thy unhappy presence from my sightâ Lest this right hand outleap my slow design, And slay thee at my feetâand bear The curse of him who gave you life! Hipp. The gods Repay that curse with blessings thicklier gathered [Striking his breast] As years increaseâhere fall the thunderbolt, The lightning here make havoc, and above The great ancestral tree keep strength and state. Sire, if no living words of mine again Salute your kingly ear, remember these. [Exit Hippolytus, L.] Thes. [Bending over Phaedra] My Phaedra! My fair queen, come back to life! Hither, Oenone, hasten! [Enter Oenone, R.] To her couch Convey this royal lady, overcome With sudden terror. Use thy choicest skill Of gums and unguentsâbring her soft to rest, And with the plumage of illustrious birds, Disperse the death swoon from her heavy lids. [Exit Oenone, supporting Phaedra] Exile or death? Oh, could the pangs of both Be blent in one, that exile might be swift, And death be slow, and tenfold terrible! [After a moment's pause] Poseidon! Thou art bounden to my suit By thine own promise, that did close upon My kingly gifts and service. Hear me now, And if he skirt thy region in his flight, Call up the howling winds to hunt him forth, And let thy billows whisper each to each My vengeance, crowding close their shining heads For one wild surge of ruin. Let thy wrath Sweep his dishonoured record from the earth, And yon deep heavens appease, that saw his crime. If this thou grant not, thou art so forsworn That never prayer or sacrifice of mine Shall hold thee in remembrance from this hour. [Exit] Scene 2: The woods; moon about to rise. Chorus of Satyrs. First Satyr. [An old one] Ah, woe! Ah, woe! On Athens woe! Second Satyr. [A young one] Good father, what should move thee so? First Satyr. The hellish queen, with ill-intent, Doth work our darling's banishment, Hippolytus to death must go. Chorus. Ah, woe is me, forever woe! 2nd Strophe. Ye little rivulets that flow, Forsake your beds and backward go; Your merry music now must fall, While heavens are black, and stars grow pale. Rise up this wicked deed to show. Chorus. Ah, woe is me, forever woe! 3rd Strophe. Ye pretty grasses of the woods, Ye May-plants with the fragrant buds, To funeral incense change your breath, And droop your foreheads, feigning death. Hippolytus to doom doth go. Chorus. Ah, woe is me, forever woe! [Four Nymphs come forward] First Nymph. How your twinkling eyes will miss him, Who so soft your state did press! Rise up one last time to kiss him, Hold him fast for one caress. FringÃ¨d branches, close around him, Twine him in your fresh embrace, For the chords of death have bound him, Ye no more shall see his face. Second Nymph. We who in the summer weather, Saw his feathery footsteps bound, When the hounds sang all together, And the dew shone on the ground; We shall wait his further coming With distended eyes, in vain. Winter's rain or summer's blooming Shall not bring him back again. Third Nymph. Never, oh, ye beauteous blossoms, Let the poisonous Phaedra pass; Nymphs, make hard your pitying bosoms, Wither at her footsteps, grass! Would she loose, in wood or meadow, From her breast the guilty chain, Fright her with her victim's shadow, Till she flee in frantic pain. Fourth Nymph. Ah! Our love than hate is stronger, Wretch, we curse thee, and have done, But we'll weave his chaplet longer Than the journeys of the sun. Maids unborn shall shear their tresses For the hero we bewail, He shall live in our distresses Till the voice of song shall fail. First Satyr. I hear a footstep. Second Satyr. Some one comes this way. Then hide we in our unseen fastnesses. [Exeunt Omnes. Enter Hippolytus] Hipp. How melancholy are the shades to-night! The boughs hang spiritless across my path, As though a sorrow touched them. As I came Weird music sobbed, but left the cheated ear Untold of its direction. Nay, methought That very tears were dropt upon my cheek By th' unseen creatures of the woods, in this More piteous of my sorrow than myself That cannot vent it thus. Have ever thanks, Ye harmless satyrs, and ye woodland nymphs, For suiting thus my moodâI am not well. Oh, where stays Creon? Creon. [Entering] He is close at hand, Filled with the shame and anguish of your wrong. Hipp. Let us not speak of thatâfor many years Its bitterness shall grow, when we have time To weep upon it. Action suits us now, And the sweet comfort of your faultless love, My Creon. Goest thou with me? Creon. By my life, Though twenty kings stood bristling in my path, I go with thee. Hipp. Perchance, in Theseus' mind, Shall this devotion blight thy growing grace, And lose the state a valiant officer. Stay where thou art, and serve the land I love, But never from thy lips let word escape To grieve my father for the thing he does. Creon. How? Wouldst thou bind me to inglorious fraud? Hipp. I bind thee to be mindful of his peace, Who, beyond all that is, is dear to me. [Enter Messenger] Creon. What have we here? Hipp. A message from the king. Mess. Art thou Hippolytus? Hipp. You have known me suchâ And what I was, I am. Mess. This from the king. Theseus commands you journey by the sea, Southward, until you learn his further will. Creon. Into the country of his enemies He sends you! Hipp. It is well as he ordains. What bringst thou more? Mess. He bids thee take thy way At earliest dawn, and from thy banished steps Divorces all who love him. Hipp. All who love him? Mess. Ev'n so. Hipp. Why, then, my Creon, we must part. Creon. Not so, for by the anguish of this hour, And by the glorious head unjustly shamed, I love him not. Hipp. Restrain the impious word. That much offends thyself and me. Creon. By heaven, I'll speak the truth altho' my blood spout with it: I love him not, and, till he do thee right, I'll serve him as the panther serves the wolf. Hipp. Forsake my presence, then, for, as I live, None shall be near me in whose heart his name Is not the kingliest jewel in the crown. Nay, have I grieved thee? [Opening his arms] Comrade, counsellor! [Embracing him] Thus let us part, as friends whose firm-knit bonds Distance shall draw but closer. With the dawn Bid that my chariot at the seaward gates Await me. Creon. But you'll rest with us till thenâ We'll keep the precious watches of the night, And mark the heavy hours with mutual tears. Hipp. Here will I sleep, that no Athenian roof Confront the royal wrath to harbour me. Creon, farewell. [Exit Creon, reluctantly] A houseless, friendless wretch, I ask the pitying woods to shelter me, Till the unwelcome sun shall hold the torch That lights Hippolytus to banishment. [Music. He lies down, the Nymphs and Satyrs steal softly out, and group around him; the moon slowly rises on the scene. Soft music. Tableau] ACT V. Scene 1: Palace in 3.G. Phaed. [Discovered] He has sealed my lips to silence, but my thoughts Clamour so wildly at the gates of speech That all my brain is mad with hearing them. How can I hide what all around me knows, How bind the sibilant air to secrecy? The very serpent at my breast would hiss His knowledge out, with every breath I drew, Did I forget to hold him, thus, thus, thus. [Pressing her hand on her lips] He's gone to death, they say, to bloody death. What then? Why, every limb of mine is struck With palsy, that I cannot follow him Whom I must follow, for he beckons me. Shall we go down together, thou and I To Erebus, with evermore thine eyes Resting so dead on mine? If I could speak 'Twere well for both, but thou permitt'st it not, And from these circling flames that gird me round, Opens no backward way. Help, help, I say! I am alone with something that I fear! [Enter Oenone and Leton] Oenone. How now, dear lady? Phaed. Did I summon you? I will not have you in my company. Oenone. I am your faithful nurse. Phaed. Begone, I say, Who was't that led to Aphrodite's shrine? You see I know you, tho' I love you not. Hence, let thy vileness perish from the earth! Oenone. [To Leton] What here avails? Leton. Her senses are distraught. Not thus in Theseus' presence must she come, Or all is lost. Madam, you know my voice: I was your guide, your friend, when others failed. Phaed. You were my servant when I hired youâ There's gold at willâyou sell your soul for gold, [Flings a purse] But I gave mine for fire, for burning fire The death damps will not quench. Leton. Forbear awhile, Till healthful slumber recreate your brain, And the vague horrors that oppress you now Show like a dream in distance. Phaed. None of that. Think you I'll sleep, that horrid ghosts may come, And breathless vengeance seize me unawares? NoâI'll not sleep. Infest my sight no more! Yet here's a thought. [Disengages her dagger] Oenone. Great heavens! what will she do? Phaed. [With weight, looking at the dagger] He said, keep silence everâthis is silence. Oenone. Have pity on thy youth. Leton. Hold back her hand Thus, while I wrest the dagger from its grasp. [A struggle ensues, Leton disarms her] Oenone. Sweet mistress, come with us. Phaed. [Breaking for them] Keep off your hands, I am the daughter of a race of kings, And crownÃ¨d death comes kingly forth to meet me: See, I have made thee rich before thy time, And thou mayst welcome whom the sick earth spurns From her upheaving bosom. Leton. You must come. Phaed. He said, keep silence ever. Oenone. Theseus comes! Leton. Haste! Must we drag you from your husband's sight? [Enter Theseus] Phaed. [Makes a movement towards him] Theseus! [Shuddering back] Nay, silence, silence was the word, And thus I keep it. [She strangles herself with her scarf] Oenone. [Springing forward] Shall she die before us? Leton. [Detaining her] 'Tis safer thus, than that her madness speak. Thes. What do I see? Oenone. [Bending over her] Alas, alas! She's dead By her own hand! Thes. How dead? This cannot be. Gather what help you may, alarm the house, Speak to me, Phaedra! Leton. She will speak no more. Self-strangled here she lies. Oenone. My child, my child! I brought thee from thy happy land of birth, And dost thou thus to mother's arms return? Oh! Woe upon this day! Thes. Restrain awhile Your woman's wailingâgive my words reply. How came she to this end? By what sharp grief Or sudden frenzy? Ye are silent both. Deliver me the truth of that I see Or ere the torture make you eloquent. Leton. My lord, these visitations mock our power And knowledgeâthe possession of the gods Nor medicine can assuage, nor wisdom charm. Thes. Fools, ye deceive meâwill ye dare contend With Theseus? Was it never known to you That the supernals are with him in league, And that the clouds of Heaven attend his wrath, To crush the thing he hates? Who art thou, slave! Leton. The soothsayer of Aphrodite's shrine. Thes. Thou serv'st thy goddess false! Ho! [Enter Soldiers] Bind me these. Oenone. Oh! Think not I'll betray thee, nor impart Thy dear concernment to the shallow air, But as the rooted mandrake shrinks and bleeds, Frighting the hand that pluck it, so shall I Utter mine own sole anguish in my breath, And keep thy secret perfect unto death. Thes. Guards! Lead them hence! I follow all intent To thread a dismal labyrinth of crime, Without the succour of one loving heart. [Exeunt] Scene 2: Seacoast. Twilight before dawn. Chorus of the Winds, in long dark robes and hoods; they dance round and round, chanting these stanzas. Left. I know that doth please me well. Right. [Nodding] So do Iâso do I. Left. I know that I will not tell. Right. So do Iâso do I. One. Wrath and wrong and scorn and hate, Wefted in one web of Fate, I know that shall plague the State. All. Ay, that know we all! [Second stanza, etc., in the same way] Hooded messengers of ill, Here we go, here we go, Working more than mortal will, Working woe, working woe, He who called us from the main, Glad would yield his right to reign, Could he send us back again. All. That he cannot do. 3RD. Fool to speak the hasty word, We obey, we obey, Bringing judgment undeferred, Have thy way, have thy way: Firmer than your turrets are, Fate doth fix the frantic prayer, For the Deities of Air Never more unsay. 4TH. Come, ye spirits of the deep, Athens mourns, Athens mourns! Rouse Poseidon from his sleep With your melancholy horns! Father! Thou a father hearest, When he bids thee lose his dearest, Nor the mortal's grief thou fearest, That thy greatness scorns. [Enter Artemis] Art. Be still, ye wild and turbulent natures, still! The work ye have to do is terrible, Exult not to fulfill it. All. Dost thou weep? A goddess weep? Art. Forbidden by my birth, See, my grief's passion breaks Jove's ordinance, And like a mortal, I must agonize, One Spirit. Venus hath done this! Art. By the will of Jove She conquers, but th' avenging years draw nigh, Unseen of her. Hark, spirits, in my woods The boar lies suckling that shall pierce the thigh Of young Adonis. I will vow such thorns Among the roses on her painted brow, That she shall shriek through all the dismal night, And follow Death as wild Bacchantes dance After the god that maddens them. But ye, Go bind th' unseemly bosom of the deep With the blue zone of calmness, while I stay To sprinkle silver on the fatal sands, And do my faithful office to the end. Chorus. [Divided as before] One is mightier than thou, Hist! We flyâhist! We fly, But he loves thy moonÃ¨d brow, Drawing nigh, drawing nigh. Doom is fixed, our master saith, Counted pulse, and measured breath, But we'll keep the hush of death, Till thy darling die. [They dance off] Art. I hear the springing footstep that respects The lightest dewdrop on my virgin flowers. Let me withdraw, and yet be near his words. [She passes out of sight] Scene 3: The seashore, a chariot waiting in the background. View of the distant city. Enter Hippolytus. Hipp. My native Athens, let me see thee once Ere I resign the dearest right of birth, To call thee Mother! From thy fostering arms Such falsehood hunts me, as the gracious earth Should surge and quake beneath to let it through Where it hath place, with pitchy flames of hell, And foul-mouthed Furies. Where are ye, ye gods, That I should suffer this which I must bear For such necessity? I have been calm, But at this step my vexed soul rises up, Like some full wave, storm-swoll'n from yonder deep, Which, rolling all its angry length along, Breaks in the sight of Heav'n with one wild cry That mocks at patience! Should I then endure That shame sit throned upon my father's couch, And point and gibber as I creep away, Bearing its loathsome burden? 'Tis too much! I'll speak, but oh, th' unutterable word, The unimaginable crimeâmy lips, Keep it till death! The stars that see me wronged Must purge my memory, when their hour is come. Art. Hippolytus! Hipp. The huntress of the woods! How cam'st thou hither? Art. For thy need I come. Hipp. Who'er thou art, approach notâhe who waits To guide this car is henceforth barred of men. Dishonour hides his crest, and on his brow Sits the black signal of a father's curse. Art. Am I of those whose sight goes not beyond The flimsy armour of a woman's guile? The curse unmerited dissolves for meâ I know your stepdame Phaedra, and her crime. Hipp. [With eagerness] Oh! If you know it, never breathe it loud, Nor whisper low, to tempt the elements. If you so love me as your deed should show, Following a fallen man, forget the thing You spokeâthis grace alone I ask of you. Art. When should the truth be known? Hipp. When mortal pain Doth loose its hold on Theseusâwhen his shade, Encountering mine, devoid of wrath or stain, Shall see the thrilling sorrows of this life But as the faultless working of the gods To some high purpose. Art. Thou art perfect still, In all thy temper. Leave these things to such Whose office is to tend themâfor thyself I now entreat thee. Hipp. See, the dawn is full, I must away. Art. A moment hear me first. Thou know'st I dwell not in the ways of men, But for mine own free pleasure haunt the woods, Hunting the antlered stagâby Jove's high will I live in holy cherished maidenhood, But thou art dearer than the world to me. Now, by the love I've borne thee, year for year, Hippolytus, ride not beside the sea! Hipp. My father gave the road by which I goâ Maiden, farewell, that road leads by the sea. Art. [Detaining him] One moment moreâI have a fastness hid From eyes of men, beyond yon mountain's peak, Where at the purple sunset, oft thine eyes Devout have lingeredâthither, in a cloud, Serene as sleep, I'll bear thy gentleness, And hide thee, till the present danger pass. Hipp. Set the bird free, whose happy wings unblamed May free him from the deadly wound and snare: But I am forged as iron from the ore, To meet the shock that waits me. Art. Listen yetâ Know'st thou Poseidon is thy father's friend, Who, in wild anger, claimed a boon of him? Hipp. Then shall he have it! Art. If it were thy death! Hipp. Turn hence thine eyes that hold me, while I feel My swift thoughts rushing to the brink of fate: Ye elements, accomplish Theseus' will, And as he prayed, revoking Nature's bond, So let it be. [Exit, R.] Art. So must it be? Then go. [She assumes a posture of intense attention] How swiftly rolls his chariot on the sands! Oh, bear him, trusty steeds, beyond this hour Of dreadful promiseâwell you love his care, His voice, his handâbe true and save his life! [Enter an Amazon] Amazon. How suddenly the deep grows turbulent, While still the clear day smiles! Art. Hist! Do you see That chariot, flashing like a dart of steel Hurled on the ocean highway? It is his. Amazon. Scared at the rushing of the brine, the steeds Break from their steady pace. Art. He reins them well. Amazon. Still, they are froward. Art. Do not speakâmine eyes Will have my soul all in them for this sight. See you that gathering pyramid of foam Heaped up before him? It has glaring eyes, And monstrous features, that do belch forth flame Across his path. Ah, gods! It hurls itself! Amazon. Help! Help! The horses lose the guiding handâ The car is overturned and dashed to splints. But where is he? Art. Where I must follow him. [Exeunt in haste, R. Enter Theseus and followers, L.] Thes. Where is the prince? Let me not come too late, Ye gods, and thou, Poseidon, stay thine hand! I was the fool of curst deceit, but thou In whose clear sight he stood, devoid of fault, Wouldst thou destroy him, at my frantic prayer? Then should the heavens betray the innocent, And spread their pall to give the guilty cover. No, he shall live, to comfort my sad years, That take their date of sorrow from this day Of dark revealing. Follower. Who are these that bear A weight along, with wild and clouded eyes? [Enter Artemis and others, bearing Hippolytus. Music] Art. Theseus, behold your son. Thes. Disfigured thus? Art. 'Tis as you wished. Thes. Hell's curses on the tongue That falsely did accuse theeâstill, thou breathest? Oh! live, that I may heal thy wounds with love, And wipe outrageous slander from thy brow. Art. It cannot be. Hipp. Father, have ever peace! Thes. Canst thou forgive me thine untimely death? Hipp. Wouldst thou remember me in coming years, Think only that I loved thee! Thes. Pitying gods, Can nothing save him? Hipp. [With great effort] Thou hast other childrenâ If thou wouldst doubt them, think that they Are thine, and trust the virtue of thy godlike race. I perish! [Sinking back] Art. Give thy last look to me, Whom thy fair life did honour. I am she That smiled from Heavenâthe Goddess Artemis. Hipp. Father, 'tis she! [Dies] Art. In fair Elysian fields, Dream without sorrow of the things that wereâ Beneath thy shadowy steps shall lilies spring, While the pure-hearted, fleeting ere their time, Shall joy to take their virgin rest with thee. [Music] CURTAIN</field>
