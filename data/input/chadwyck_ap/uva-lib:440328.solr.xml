      <field name="fulltext">Devotional Poetry To Thyrsis While Vice triumphant lords it o'er the plain, And holds o'er abject man her tyrant-reign; While poor dejected Virtue hangs her head, Her dictates quite despis'd, her influence dead; While hoary Age forgets its wonted lore, And lives a pattern of good deeds no more; While Youth, no more by modest duty bound, Of vice or folly runs one constant round; In fine, while almost all their bane pursue, Nor have one gen'rous God-like aim in view; Dear Thyrsis, scorn the listless, impious, throng, And harken to the precepts of my song. Observe the muse that tempts the moral lay, And boldly follow, where she leads the way; With me be brave in virtue's injur'd cause, Gain thou from heav'n, if not from men, applause. First then, to Him, who bad the first to be, Th' all-good, all-wise, all pow'rful Deity; With humblest awe, thy faithful pray'r address, To guide thee thro' this thorny Wilderness. For Oh! without his providential care, How vain our most important projects are? The man, who travels life's uncertain way, And fondly cries, I will not err to Day, Deceives himself; for, mortal, canst thou tell, How oft thou swervest ev'n from thinking well? O Thought! from thee what anxious griefs arise: How great the pain, to labour to be wise? What various triffles will the heart amuse, And stagger all her pow'rs, ere we can chuse? And in the choice, how oft do we prefer What's more absur'd to what is just and clear, Cherish Ideas wandering, low and gay, And cast each serious, useful thought away. How fatal the result! - my friend beware, And fall not heedless in the baneful snare. Ah! let not Wit profane thy heart engage; Read every moral, ev'ry sacred page. To Reason's strength call Revelation's aid, Nor be by too presuming Self betray'd; By Both assisted, soon thou'lt gain the field, Without the aid of Both as soon wilt yield. Then passions plead, and prejudice has sway, And poor insulted Virtue dies away. And now the Tongue demands thy utmost care, 'Tis wise, the mischiefs of the Tongue to fear. How oft are schemes the noblest, closest laid, By one unthinking, guardless word betray'd? What guilt, what shame in loose expression lies? And yet how few can be in silence wise? Ah friend! the silly rant of fools defy, The nauseous ribaldry, the senseless lie; The hideous blasphemy, the envious sneer; The killing scandal and the biting jeer. Why should you blush at what yourself have said? Why blushes stain the face of that fair Maid? Why will you thus, where nought can tempt, offend? Why shame your wife, your father or your friend? Why anger heav'n without a seeming Cause? Or why affront great nature's purest laws? Why, lastly, hurt his character and fame, Whom, tho' you scarcely know, but by his name, Yet for mere folly's sake, you censure and condem? In prudent silence, rather seek to shine, And pay your offrings at her sacred shrine. She, heaps applause, if you her rules obey, Gives you a temper sweet, serene and gay, And chases all chagrin, and all remorse away. A just regard to Action next succeeds: Foul Thoughts, foul Words are bad, but worst foul Deeds. The maid deflour'd, the easy friend deceiv'd; The helpless orphan of his rights betray'd; The pow'r divine disclaim'd, the breach of troth; The Midnight revel, and the Mid-day sloth The Poor neglected, and the Villain fed; Religion with her institutes betray'd— O what a scene of guilt! How wretched He O'er whelm'd with half this load of infamy! And yet look round—such is the hideous face Of things below— But turn thine eyes—a different prospect view, And the blest path now pointed out pursue. And firm regard to Heav'n devoutly paid; His pow'r acknowledg'd, and implor'd his aid; The Parent's, Sov'reign's, Reason's laws observ'd; The Naked cloath'd, the Fainting soul preserv'd; The duties of each station well perform'd, And in her strongest holds vice bravely storm'd; Goodness, by pattern more than precept, taught; And Wisdom's awful rules for ever fought— These, these have charms—these, these pursue, my friend! On these e'en here the surest joys attend; And these will give thee bliss, which ne'er shall end. Maryland, Baltimore County, written in the year 1744. A POEM Sacred to the Memory of Miss Margaret Lawson, Miss Elizabeth Lawson, Miss Dorothy Lawson, and Miss Elizabeth Read. As whilom roving o'er the lonely Plain, Pensive and sad, my Soul distract with Grief For unexpected woes; yet still intent My Thoughts on Thee, O God, and on thy Ways, Thy deep mysterious Ways with mortal Man; Struck with thy various Dispensations, long In humble Adoration lost, I stood. “Surely (I said), the God that's just and wise, “And good and pow'rful needs must act aright: “And who shall say, What dost thou? to what end?” Yet still, when anxious, I presum'd to scan His late tremendous Act; t' explore the Cause, Why sweetest Innocence and loveliest Youth, Fell such an early Sacrifice to Death: Why beauteous Margaretta, peerless Maid! The two Elizas, faultless both as fair, And gentle Dorothea, heav'nly Child! So sudden left us, left us, to bewail Beauties and Graces, that with Rapture long We'ad view'd perfection op'ning; Thought Was in Amazement sunk, I look'd astound, And all was Chaos round me: Like the Sage, Who, when exploring great Creation's Laws, Finds Difficulties not to be explain'd, And owns his Reason's dim short sighted Pow'rs. Strait I cried out; “Inscrutable thy Ways, “Thy Counsels and thy Will, O sov'reign Lord!” Long in the dark Perplexity my Soul Was not involv'd; I onward bent my Way, And to yon Empyrean lift my eyes, Tho' dubious, yet adoring; when behold! The Face of Heav'n was chang'd; the gloomy Clouds Divided and stream'd out a shining Light, Radiance, as is a Summer's Sun at Noon. Surpriz'd I stopp'd and contemplated strait The blest Appearance, when a heav'nly Form Broke forth, and stood before me; such her Charms “As make Expression dumb;” her Voice, her Mien Spoke Margaretta; but, tho' lovely she When mortal, yet a thousandth thousandth Part She had not of the Beauties that beam'd forth Now from her Face celestial; nobler Sweets Than or Arabia, or the spicy Isles E'er boasted, from her breath'd; she look'd, she smil'd, As Angels Look and Smile, to some good Man On happy errand sent. I stood entranc'd In speechless Rapture, while the Charmer spoke (Such Sounds none surely but Immortals hear), She spoke, and fill'd me with ecstatic Joy. “O thou, my Father's Friend, and therefore mine, “To thee I'm sent, to teach thee how to chear “The drooping Hearts of those, whose Parent-Love “Strikes them with bootless Grief, and fills their Eyes “With streaming Sorrows for their dear beloved. “Alas! why mourn they? Mourn they not for them, “Who to Eternity are blest? For them, “Who tread you happy heav'nly Plains, where reign “Immortal Peace and Pleasure? Joy is there, “Such Joy as mortal Eye ne'er yet as seen, “Nor mortal Tongue exprest, nay more; the Heart “Of Man, will ne'er conceive, 'till they, like us “Thereto have blest Admittance. Oh! that thou, “Or that my Father, or that honour'd Dame, “Who bore me in the Womb, who train'd me up “From Infancy, in Virtue's heav'nly Road; “O that you knew, what Joy celestial struck “Our ravish'd Senses, when advanced first “To what we now possess! From your dull Earth “Short was our Passage, and but slight our Pain, “Death's a mere Bug-bear, which, because untried, “Vain Man thinks all that's horrible and dire. “Far, far from this;—to those, who like Ourselves “Walk in the Ways of Pleasantness and Peace, “In Wisdom's Ways, he is the kindest Friend. “Scarce had we felt the Danger that you mourn'd “When from our Bodies mounted blithe our Souls, “And flew to light, so lively that we soon “Reach'd the desired goal; as soon forgot “The idle World we 'ad left behind, and blest “The Means that disengag'd us from our Clay: “But this is nought to the ecstatic Bliss “We prov'd, when to the bright Assembly join'd “Of just Men perfect made; when 'mid a Host “Of Cherubim and Seraph we approach'd “The King of Kings, in Glory bright array'd, “And join'd in Allelujahs to the Lamb “That sat by him enthron'd, Omnipotence “And Majesty and Holiness divine, “And boundless Wisdom, Justice, Goodness, Love, “Are now the Theme of our eternal Songs. “This, this the Happiness, for which we've left “Your nether World; and say, tho' Children ne'er “Enjoy'd from Parents a sincerer Love, “Can we regret the blessed Change? Ah, no! “Tho' dear unto us still, yet wou'd we not “For all then thousand Worlds like yours can yield “Quit yon blest Plains, to tread with them again “Your sordid Earth. Your Message then be this: “Tell them to sigh no more for us; our God “In kind Compassion to themselves hath call'd “The darling Objects of their Souls away. “Of us depriv'd, they now must surely know “The Vanity of earthly Bliss, and feel, “Sensibly feel, that they must seek for Joy “In other Worlds, in Worlds where only Joy “Is to be found: Their best Affections then “Set they on Things above; and soon shall we “In Heaven's due time to yon immortal Shores “Hail them arriv'd: Their happy Daughters there “Again shall they behold; and with them live “Eternal Ages, never more to part.” T. CRADOCK Seven Hymns Hymn for Christmas 1 Rejoice, ye servants of the Lord: Be this great name ador'd: Exalt your voices high: For lo! He comes; the Godhead comes; Our nature to His own assumes, That he for us may die. 2 This blessed day, glad Earth receives The Prince of Peace: a Virgin gives The Savior to the light: Angelic hosts the wonder sing; The Shepherds haste to hail their King, And bless the awful sight. 3 And see, the Magi from afar, Directed by a radiant star, To where their Maker lay; Offer, with mingled joy and fear, Their gold, frankincense, and their myrrh, And adoration pay. 4 And shall not we, with equal fear, With equal warmth and joy revere, His great and glorious name! And shall not we in loftiest hymns, With Seraphs and Cherubims, The Saviour God proclaim! Hymn for Whitsunday 1 Thou Holy Ghost; mysterious power! To thee we fly for aid; Teach us, on wings of Faith to soar, Our inmost hearts purvey'd. 2 O still, as erst Thou didst inspire, The chosen of the Lord, When first they felt the Sacred fire, Instruct me in Thy Word. 3 With wonder, heard the mingled throng! They saw and were amazed! The rushing wind, the cloven tongues— They trembled as they gazed. 4 But what astonishment was theirs! Who can their joy unfold! While each, in his own language hears Th' important tidings told. 5 This wond'rous work, all clement power, Didst then for man ordain! That sin, and death, and hell, no more Might hold their hated reign. 6 Therefore, our gratitude to Thee, Breaks forth in hymns of joy; And thus, thro' all eternity, May we our tongues employ. Sacremental Hymn 1 The feast's prepared; the table's set; The chosen of the Lord are met. Blest visitants! how happy all, Who haste to obey the gracious call. 2 Hark! 'tis the Saviour Who invites! Such condescension, sure excites Each fervent heart to join the feast; Who would not be the Saviour's guest? 3 Haste then, with ardor to your bliss! “O taste and see how good He is!” Feast your glad souls, in what will prove Sweet earnest of your bliss above. Resignation 1 What e'er, all-clement God, Thy justice shall ordain; I'll bow, submissive to thy rod, And never will complain. 2 Though ills, successive fall, On my devoted head, With patient heart, I'll bear them all, And to thy mercy plead. 3 For well, I know, the cause Of thy consuming wrath; Too long I've disobey'd thy laws, I've merited my death. 4 I know, whate'er I feel, The Saviour suffer'd more; And man's distempered heart to heal, Severest tortures bore. 5 Hear this! my soul, thou'lt say, Since God's such tender love, I'll bear life's sorrows as I may, My gratitude to prove. Hymn for Ascension 1 He springs, he rises from the ground He cleaves the yielding sky. Then Earth, the heavens with joy resound, That Savior mounts on high. 2 O Wondrous proof of power divine The God, the God ascends; With what a lustre does he shine, And what a train attends. 3 The cherubim &amp; seraphim Crowd thick his azure way; And hark in one continued hymn Their duteous homage pay. 4 Hear this ye nations and adore; The Era is begun, When time and death—their ravage o'er— Lie vanquished by the Son. 5 Again he'll in the clouds appear; When—all-tremendous thought— For what we've live &amp; acted here, Shall be to judgement brought. 6 The wicked in the depths of hell, To wail eternal woe; The righteous with their Lord to dwell, Where joys immortal flow. Funeral Hymn 1 Fruitless the toils which harrass man; His anxious cares for wealth or pow'r; Life's longest period's but a span, And soon he meets his destined hour. 2 Death strikes! fell tyrant! less he lies, And those that loved him round him mourn; But vain their tears &amp; vain their sighs, For life once fled has no return. 3 And is there nothing that can boast, Its various ills to make us bear? Is all in disappointment lost, Without one prospect worth our care? 4 Yes, there's a brighter, a heavenly prize Deserves our care, our utmost pains; You blooming fields above the skies, Where Seraphs sing, where Jesus reigns. 5 With these in view &amp; these our aim, Life's deepest woes we can support. And immortality our claim, Who'll dare to say that life is short? On Viewing the Grave of Arthur Cradock 1 In the dark Earth his body lies— Deep hid from mortal sight; Clos'd, ever clos'd, those beaming eyes— That gave me such delight. 2 Cold as the turf that covers him— He whom the parent mourns; Corruption triumphs o'er each limb— And dust to dust returns. 3 O with what rapture viewed we all— His sweet, his manly form; Ah, could we think so soon he'd fall— A victim to the worm. 4 And yet that body cloth'd a mind— That with devotion glow'd; And could no solid pleasure find— But in the love of God. 5 And yet those eyes so mildly bright— Trac'd out creation's laws; And guided by celestial light— Discern'd th'Almighty Cause. 6 And yet that form display'd a Soul— In every grace complete; Which every passion could control— Serene, sublimely great. 7 Is then my dear loved son no more?— Ah yes! he lives above; No longer then, fond heart, deplore— The loss of filial love. A Fragment Blest is the Man who's free from publick Cares; Who no Man envies, and who no Man fears, Whose Heart, a Stranger to the Ways of Sin, Gives him true Joy, true Happiness within. With his own Hands he ploughs that native Field, His Father, Grandsire, and their Grandsires till'd. Under those Oaks they found a cool Retreat When spent with Labour in the Midday Heat, He throws Him down: The Rooks, whose Sires before Lull'd his Forefathers with their cawing Lore, On him like Tribute gratefully bestow. Tis all they have to give, tis all the Rent they owe. Though small his Income, though his Household great, The Poor unpitty'd never leave his Gate. To them a Little of his Little's given. Did I say, given? no; that is lent to Heaven. On Sundays seated in his wicker Chair, His Wife, his Children, Friends and Neighbours near, He from the sacred Text a Chapter reads, Comments, explains each verse as he proceeds: Not to corrupt, but to apply the Word, Not make his Hearers Casuists, but good. When in the Markett with his Team he stands, The Rich, the Great will take him by the Hand. Though he no Pensions grants, no Bribes bestows, Virtue will meet Respect where'evr She goes. Among his Neighbours if Disputes arise, The injur'd Party straight to him applys. He hears both Sides, determines soon the Cause; For He has Sense, though unskill'd in the Laws. And Who has Sense with Honesty combin'd, Him make thy Judge, if such one Thou canst find. When Death prepares his Being here to end, Celestial Angels round his Couch attend; Who wait impatient till the Stroke be given, Eager to waft his honest Soul to Heaven. Crurulia Part the 2d [1] The Check 1 But why, my soul, so mournfully complain? The crime of base ingratitude beware; Has Heav'n no mercies mingled with thy pain? Dost thou no blessings from thy Maker share? 2 Oh yes! they're countless—hourly on my head— (For which his glorious name be still ador'd) Has he the bounties of his goodness shed, Like gladning rains on thirsty pastures pour'd. 3 Various indeed his mercies—nor forget, My soul, his blest benificence to praise, Never oh never thou'lt discharge the debt, Tho' to his will devoted all thy days: 4 Blest in th'affection of a tender wife Whose constant joy's my wayward heart to please; Who seeks to smooth the rigours of my life, And ne'er is happy, but when I have ease: 5 Blest is my children who with duteous eye Wait ev'ry motion of their father's will; Whose infant hearts with filial simpathy, Young as they are, their father's anguish feel: 6 Blest in the genuine friendship of the Few, Whose worthy souls, from servile meanness free, Firmly the rigid paths of truth pursue, And scorn the dupes of modern modes to be: 7 Blest in my country's welfare which no more Mourns battles badly fought &amp; basely lost, But with her fleets insults the hostile shore, Cou'd late a Wolfe, can yet an Amherst boast: 8 Blest in my faith, which wanders not abroad After the wild fanatick's idle schemes, But makes it only rule the book of GOD, Clear from the taint of superstitution's dreams: 9 But all above, blest in the glorious hope, That, when I die, I shall not total die, But Heav'n will give my soul her amplest scope, To climb yon bright etherial worlds on high. 10 Lo! these are blessings of the noblest kind; And can I then ungratefully complain For trifling ills?—for shame, my dastard mind, The coward's weak unmanly moan disdain, 11 Be thy own self—thy origin respect; The ways of Heav'n, it's kind intension scan; On what thou art design'd for, calm, reflect; And bravely act the Christian &amp; the Man. 2 Afflictions mercies 1 Yes; well the sacred page informs my soul, That our severest evils mercies prove; The force of sensual passion to controul, Inflicted on us by Almighty love. 2 I find it so; for now my humbled heart Melts with the dread of that tremendous hour, When I from earth &amp; all its ties must part, And see the glories of the sun no more. 3 Now ev'ry word and ev'ry action's weigh'd; Now the minutest thought I strickly poise; That I to him whose blood my ransome paid, May yet present a welcome sacrifice. 4 Yet not my soul, thou of perfection boast; Alass! I feel how very frail I be; How weak my virtue, where I struggle most How wondrous hard, from folly to be free: 5 That still my mind a motley-mixture shews, Where grace &amp; passion have by turns their pow'r; As in the mass, wherein the bullion glows, Dull worthless earth is blended with the ore. 6 But as that ore is by the fire refin'd, Purg'd from it's dross, &amp; render'd bright &amp; pure; So is my hope, that my afflicted mind Will whiten thro' it's pains, &amp; Heav'n secure: 7 And is it thus? and will that Heav'n be mine? By means of blest affliction shall I see My Maker's face? kind source of bliss divine! That thus conducts me to eternity! 8 Eternity, thou no more dreadful thought! My only prospect, and my only aim! In pain's hard school the wholsome lesson taught, For thee I labour, &amp; tis thee I claim. 9 Let princes vain fantastick hopes pursue And wade thro' blood &amp; carnage to a crown; I scorn their low ambition; thou my view, With pity on a Bourbon I look down. 3 The Resolve 1 The royal shepherd in his songs of woe, When noisome ulcers o'er his body ran, And he no respite from his pains cou'd know, Determin'd on his wise religious plan: 2 That if high Heav'n him to his health restor'd, His voice in hymns of gratitude he'd raise, Duely attend the temple of the Lord, And make his life one constant act of praise. 3 And shall not I, by his example led, Sweet health returning to my weaken'd frame, Thus rescued from the confines of the dead Adore my gracious God &amp; bless his name: 4 Taught by his chastning, yet supporting hand, My duty and true interest to know, The pleasant ways, the paths to peace regain'd With the bright flame of heavenly zeal to glow? 5 Yes, O my God, thy praise I'll ever sing, Thou heard'st me in the direful hour of pain, Didst kind relief in all my sad anguish bring, And gav'st me to behold the sun again. 6 To thee I'll dedicate my future days; Subject my ev'ry passion to thy will; And, while my tongue shall grateful hymn thy praise, My soul shall joy thy precepts to fulfill. 7 The lures of pleasure &amp; charms of sence Shall cheat my now-awaken'd heart no more; But a new Era I'll of life commence Devoted solely to thy gracious power. 8 I stand resolv'd and thou all-clement God, Benignly these my resolutions aid, On me be thy effectual grace bestow'd, That I, prepar'd, may ev'ry sin evade: 9 Firmly that I the ways of truth may tread, And follow close the precepts thou hast given, From virtue still to virtue by thee led, Till I have reach'd at length my destin'd Heav'n. 10 Then I'll rejoice, affliction has been mine, That I have felt thy kind correcting rod; Thus fully prov'd the son of Love divine, Of Thee, my Lord, my Saviour, &amp; my God. 4 The Relapse 1 Vain empty efforts of humanity! And is it thus I've kept the solemn vow? Thus sudden from my resolutions fly? The wretch I was alate, the same I'm now— 2 Base dastard as I am, I quit the field To boist'rous passions leave my soul the prey; E'en at the first assault supinely yield, A rebel, where I bound my heart t' obey. 3 Thus when the shaggy tirant of the waste Falls on the scatter'd flocks, the caitiff-swain Deserts his fleecy charge with all his haste, And leave the bestial master of the plain. 4 What tho' my soul they unexpected storm'd And pour'd upon her with impetuous rage? The noble resolutions she had form'd, Had arm'd her sure their fury to assuage! 5 Fool! to forget the scared promise made Of firm obedience to all-righteous Heav'n! Fool! to forget, how ardently I pray'd, To have my crimes &amp; errors past forgiven. 6 And can I hope his goodness will assist The enormous wretch who thus deserts his post Who acts just as his lordly passions list, In the wild whirl of impious anger lost. 7 Ah no! I feel the heavy weight of sin, That if I'd conquer, I must sorely strive, My faithful monitor forewarns, within, Incessant contest, if with God I'd live. 8 And yet how hard!—too vainly we essay To check our passions, in their full career; Our poor weak hearts too suddenly given way,— And lose their fortitude when danger's near. 9 So, in a tempest's rage, with headlong force The torrents, rushing from the mountains, roar. Mounds, dams &amp; banks in vain oppose their course, On all around they desolate pour. 10 Delusive plea, &amp; indolent excuse! Passions must be controul'd, if Heav'n we'd win; The gates of mercy entrance will refuse If we approch them, laden with our sin. 5 The Recovery 1 Delightful change! my heart again has peace I feel my soul now to her God return; The terrors of impenitence decrease Again with bright celestial zeal I burn. 2 Wild passions now no more distort my frame: Their base pernicious influence is o'er; My soul now glowing with devotion's flame, I bend beneath their tiranny no more. 3 Religion waits me with her lovely train; The sister virtues all around me shine. And now, a votary to my God again, I cease to tremble at the wrath divine. 4 Rapt into prospects of sublimest joys Which by his blood my Saviour for me won, E'en Pleasure's gaudy lures and gilded toys, Firmly, I scorn, and can with horror shun. 5 How great soever their attractions prove, Let them their trophies &amp; their conquests boast, Thanks to me my God and his afflicting love On me their flatt'ring, fatal charms are lost. 6 So to the wisest of the kings of Greece, As by their dangerous shore the Heroe past, The Sirens sung; in vain—the song they cease; They see they gain not on his guarded breast. 7 Yes, O my God, to thee with humbliest awe, With earnest love, I'll dedicate my days; The rule of all my actions is thy law, The sweet employment of my tongue—thy praise; 8 Thy grace conducting me, I look above The narrow limits of this lower sphere, The seats of light, the scenes of heav'nly love My only mark for thou, O Lord, art there. 9 Sincerest thanks to thy correcting hand That led thro' pain, thro' anguish to my bliss; Strengthen'd by thee I now collected stand, And fix my views on endless happiness. 6 The Prospect 1 What glorious vision breaks upon my eyes? What heav'nly prospect charms my raptur'd mind? What wondrous beauties sudden round me rise, As if to dissipate my doubts design'd? 2 Sure Heav'n now opens to my longing heart, And gives a prelude of those future joys, Which it's high Monarch will to all impart, Who strive to win the great eternal prize. 3 So to the weary swain, who travels long A miry road, the verdant plains appear, Whose flow'ry glades &amp; breezy groves among, He hopes his harast, panting soul to cheer. 4 Now are forgot the labours that are o'er, His many toilsome steps in dreary ways; A sweet continued prospect lies before, His ravish'd sight, and tunes him all to praise. 5 O what a view of bliss? in transport lost, I can't my wonder, my surprise express? Sure these the shining fields, that joyous coast, Where ever blooms celestial happiness. 6 Greece, boast no more thy fond ideal plains Oh joys, Elysian, where Immortals throng— Tis here, full in my view, that pleasure reigns Which far exceeds the scenes thy Homer sung. 7 What rapture, O my soul! the minstrelsy Of Seraph &amp; of Cherub strikes my ears; Amid the tuneful choir I seem to be, And listen to the musick of the spheres. 8 Lo! what a flood of piercing light pours down Thro' the Immense, &amp; brightens all around! This sure th'effulgence from th'Eternal's throne On them who're with his mighty favour crown'd. 9 I see them all—O what a countless train! Myriads &amp; Myriads number not their bands; Who'd tell the Blest that in these regions reign, Might count in the extended oceans glitt'ring sands. 10 And does my God this place for me prepare? And will these heavenly pleasures all be mine? Shall I the glories of Immortals share? O blest benificence of love divine! 11 Strive, O my soul, with all thy efforts strive To please that Saviour—God who to provide These bright rewards; his precious blood did give; His life thy pattern and his law thy guide.</field>

These really are Gentlemen that bring a great discredit on their Funtion. For we resemble those at Home no more, Than Saints of Modern Days do Saints of yore. Tit: Sic canibus catulos similis, Noram Haec tantum alias inter caput extulit urbes Quantum lenta solent inter viburna cupressi. Crape: And pray, what made you to this Country come?

Candidior postquam tondenti barba cadebat I quite grew weary of my country Fare. Oatmeal &amp; Water was too thin a Diet, To keep my grumbling Guts in peace &amp; Quiet; So fear of Starving, Hope of living better, Made me have Heart enough to cross the Water. Nec spes libertatis erat, nec cura peculi. Crape: I was surpris'd, that tho' you liv'd so well, Me: Mirabar quid maesta Deos, amarylli, vocares; Your Carcase was so lank, you Phiz so pale; The Cause is plain The philosophy of this I don't pretend to assert; but I think Experience is plainly on our Side.—your native, hungry Food So gain'd th'Ascendant o'er your youthful Blood, You look, as, if no meat cou'd do you good.

A very just Satyr I think on our Clergy for putting his lordship in our Pray'rs on a par with the Royal Family. He bad me come, he bad me preach &amp; pray, And, if the Planters wou'd not, make 'em pay. Tit: neque servitio me exire licebat, Nec tam praesentis alibi cognoscere divos. Hic illum vidi juvenem, Meliboe, quotannis Bis senos cui nostra dies altaria fumant. Hic mihi responsum primus dedit ille pententi; Pascite boves boves, pueri; submittite tauros. Crape: O happy Brother; happy is Thy Plight; Mel: Fortunate senex ergo tua rura manebunt; Happy in all that can thy Soul delight; Sure of the Forties, The Clergy's Income is by forty Pound Wt of Tobacco a Head; &amp; indeed little enough for those that are worthy of it; tho' occasion is taken from the Ill behaviour of some to represent their Income as a great Burthen on the Country. Whate'er Loss betide The Planter's Toil; since they must be supply'd.

No more in Bumbo, or in Cyder swill; I'm sorry to say, the Satyr here too just. Indeed Ecclesiastical Authority is much wanted here; &amp; till proper measures are taken, there will be some among the Clergy, whose Lives will be a Scandal to the rest. Faith! all's o'er now—I may go where I will. Split-text: To night howe'er with me you'll foul a Plate; A juicy fat Gammon &amp; a Chick we'll get; Wine I have none; Good Bumbo Rum, Water and Sugar without Acid. &amp; small Beer, Clean, tho' coarse Linnen, will be all your Fare. This year of Cyder I but made one Stoup, Cider very plentiful in this Country: but tis observable that the Trees bear but ev'ry other Year. We must suppose this then to be the scarce year. One Night the Planters came &amp; drank it up, Walk in—the Chimney's Smoke's more plainly seen; And Giant Shadows cross the dewy Green; Tit: Hic tamen hac mecum poteras requiescere nocte Sunt nobis mitia poma Constaneae molles et pressi copia lactis; Et jam summa procul villarum culmina fumant Majoresque cadunt altis de montibus umbrae In louder Musick sing the marshy Frogs; The frogs here are of various Kinds &amp; have notes as various, which on a summer's Ev'ning make a musick not disagreable. —Sambo, go, pen the Turkies, feed the Hogs. DAPHNE Eclogue 2d. Argument Pompey, a Negro Slave, is in love with Daphne, a fellow Slave that has gained the good Graces of her Master—He therefore in this Eclogue complains of her Cruelty, says all he can in his own Favour, &amp; importunes her to come &amp; live with him; till at last perceiving the Vanity of her Pretensions, he acknowledges his Folly, &amp; is resolv'd to Trouble himself no more about her. For Daphne's Charms did hapless Pompey The Planters generally give to their Negroes the names of the greatest men of old, which I can't help thinking is doing a great outrage to the Heroes of antiquity. burn, In vain, She scorn'd to make him a Return; The planter lov'd too well the coal-black Maid, Tis very well known both Planters &amp; their Wives have transgrest this Way. Joy of his Eyes, &amp; Partner of his Bed: The gloomy Woods were all the Slave's Relief, His toil once o'er, he'd solace there his Grief; To echoing hills wou'd tell his piteous Tale, And grumble to the trees—without Avail. Alexis Ecloga 2da Formosum pastor Corydon ardebat Alexin, Delicias Domini; nec quid Speraret habebat. Tantum inter densas, umbrosa cacumina, fagos Assidue veniebat ibi haec incondita solus Montibus et silvis studio jactabat inani O cruel Daphne, must I die indeed, Nor thou my Songs, my Cares, my Passion heed?

But I, pursuing charming Thee in vain, Constant with chirping Grashopper complain. The haughty Airs of proud Mulatto Bess, Was't not enough to bear—without redress? True; she was yellow;—lovely black art thou; Yet both coneur my Wonted Peace t'undo. Trust not too much, my Tyrant, to thy Charms; The whites are sometimes welcome to our Arms: My Mistress oft invites me to her Bed, See note a. And, if thou'rt cruel still, she'll sure succeed. O crudelis Alexi, nihil mea carmina curas; Nil nostri miserere; mori me denique coges: Nunc etiam pecudes umbras &amp; frigora captant, Thestylis &amp; rapido fessis messoribus aestu Nunc viridis etiam occultant spineta lacertos, Allia serpyllumque herbas contundit olentis. At mecum raucis, tua dum vestigia lustro, Sole sub ardenti resonant asbusta cicadis. Nonne fuit satius tristes Amaryllidis iras Atque superba puti fastidia? Quamvis ille niger, quamvis tu candidus esses. O formose puer, nimium ne crede colori, Alba liqustra cadunt. Vaccinia nigra leguntur. Daphne, indeed you shun you don't know who; A thousand Things at your Command I'll do. Fullrich am I in Poultry, Turkies, Geese; Cotton I gather, white as any Fleece; Potatoes sweet shall be thy Winter-Fare, And most delicious Fruits thy Summer's Share. I sing as well as ever Negro sung. Nor Sambo has a Banjar A Negro Instrument, something like a Bladder. better strung. Despectus tibi sum, nec, qui sim, quaeris, Alexi. Quam dives pecoris, nivei quam lactis abundans. Mille meae Siculis errant in montibus agnae Lac mihi non aestate, novum non frigore desit Canto quae solitus Amphion Dircaeus— Nor am I so deform'd—alate I stood, And view'd my shape in Choptank's A River on the Western Shore of the Chesapeak. Silver Flood My Master's self, tho' we were judg'd by thee, Can't boast a Body, Shape, or Limbs like me. Nec sum adeo informis: nuper me in litore vidi, Cum pacidum ventis staret mare; non ego Daphnim Judice te, metuam O might this humble Hut thy Charms receive; With me the Piggies to their Accorns drive. Our haughty Lord, tho' now so wondrous great, Nothing more common than for the Convits that go over, if they prove anything careful, to get a handsome Livelihood; &amp; buy Slaves themselves; which they are sure to use cruelly enough. Once on Tobacco, &amp; on Hogs did wait: First toil'd like me, was next an Overseer; So by Degrees grew what you've found him here. Nor think it Scorn to use this gentle Hoe; Once in his Life, twas more than he wou'd do.

Besides, within the Woods I lately found Two lovely Fawns, Deer range here in great Plenty, &amp; anyone that will, may destroy them, tho now scarcer, especially in the more cultivated Part of the Country, than they were in the author's Time. with White all Spotted round, These have I kept for thee—Nell oft in vain Has beg'd 'em of me; she'll her Suit obtain, Since thou the Giver &amp; the Gift disdain.

Et vos, O lauri, carpam, &amp; te, proxima myrte Sic positae quoniam suavis miscetis odores. Ah, Pompey! she thy scoundrel—Presents scorns; Thy Lord with nobler Gifts her Love returns; What wou'd I have?—how wretched is my Lot? The Hogs into my Cotton Patch have got. Ev'ry Planter allows his Negro a little spot of ground to raise some little Truck for himself, such as Cotton, Potatoes, Negro Peese, &amp;c. Surely our Huts you scorn'st not; lest you're mad; Our Master's self at first no better had. Rusticus es, Corydon: nec munera curat Alexis; Nec si muneribus certes, concedat Iolas. Ehue! quid volni misero mihi Floribus Austrum Perditus &amp; liquidis immisi fontibus Apros. Quem fugis ah! demens! habitarunt di quoque sylvas Dardaniusque Paris. The Wolf with greedy Eyes the Lamb pursues, The Gentle Lamb the Glade with rapture views. I follow thee, My Daphne; thee alone; All follow that they want to make their own. See my returning Mates—their Toil is done, The Shadows now attend the setting Sun: Yet I'm burnt up with Love—What yet could prove Lupis ipse capellam Florentem cytisum sequitur lasciva capella Te Corydon, O Alexi; Trahit sua quemque voluptas. Aspice, aratra jugo referunt suspensa juvenci, Et Sol crescentes decendens duplicat umbras: Me tamen urit amor—quis enim modus adsit Amori? Sufficient Guard against the Flames of Love. Ah Pompey, say! thy Mind what Frenzy sways? And yet no Boughs support thy drooping Peas: Why rather does thou not those Things prepare Which both for thy wants &amp; ease more needful are? Another court, since thou must do without her; Ah Corydon, Corydon! quae te dementia cepit? Semiputata tibi frondosa vitis in ulmo est. Quin tu aliquid saltem potius, quorum indiget usus, Viminibus mollique paras detexere junco. Invenies alium, si te hic fastidit, Alexim. Make no more Rant, nor vex thyself about her. Good advice truly; &amp; follow'd by the Generality of the Province, for from the Counsellor to the Slave, there was never an instance of true gen'rous Courtship; The Refinement of that noble Passion being what they are wholly Strangers to. SHOAT Ecloga 3 Argument After a Squabble, as too usual among Convicts, Scape-Rope &amp; Cutpurse challenge one another to sing, &amp; make their Shipmate Shoat Judge of the Performance.— If the Poetry of this Eclogue seems in some Places worse than ordinary, you must consider how hard it is, to make such Persons Speak in Character. Scape-Rope, Cut-Purse, Shoat Scape-Rope: Ho! Cutpurse, say, whose starveling Kine are these? Cutpurse: My Master Foists;—They brousing on the Trees. Scape-Rope: Ay, so it seems, while any slut he'll court, Who picks his Pocket, &amp; laughs at him for't You, Scoundrel as you are, his Corn destroy, And the few Cows he has with Hunger die. Cutpurse: Good Words become you; or I'm much mistaken; Who late was caught a filching Dobson's Bacon? Scape-Rope: Rascal! I did not kill my Neighbour's Trees; They're Rogues like you, that play such Pranks as these. Cutpurse: Not you, be sure—poor Hodges best can tell; 'Cause he his Master pleas'd &amp; serv'd him well; A Jacket his Reward—You, envious Wight! To Pieces tore it, purely out of Spite. Scape-Rope: Sirrah! I caught thee late—thou know'st, I did. The Dog betray'd thee—in the Bushes hid; And when I cried; Beward the Turkies, Turkies surprisingly plentiful &amp; the best I ever eat in my life. ho! Aside the Rails you scamper'd—Is't not so? Cutpurse: The Turkey's mine; twas by a Song I won it; And tho' he kept it from me, Bumpkin own'd it. Scape-Rope: Heigh! thou pretend to sing—sure never yet Cou'd Voice like thine one Tart by singing get, Tis true, thou scar'st the Wild-Cats by thy yell; For thy shrill Roar's enough to frighten Hell. Cutpurse: Ha! darst thou try, which of us best can sing? This Dog I prize 'bove any earthly Thing; Better than ought of thine—yet this I'll lay— Tis plain, thou dar'st not—dar'st thou, Scoundrel, ha! Scape-Rope: Dogs I have none; My Mistress well you know To Dogs e'er since her Loss has been a Foe; By them her hapless Lover was betray'd, And thro' her Husband's Rage an Eunuch made; And now she hates them with the utmost Spite, And the least Howl still puts her in a Fright. A true story, &amp; just as it is related here. But since thou art resolv'd the Fool to play; The only Thing I have, I'm free to lay: This Knife, last Instance of that nimble Art, Which liked to have plac'd me in the fatal Cart This I have valued long—&amp; yet I'll stake it, And if thou win'st it from me, thou must take it. Cutpurse: And I've a Spoon too, Sukey to me gave, That last sad Day we took our parting Leave; O keep it for my Sake, she fondly cry'd, While round her neck the Noose the Hangman tied, Yet tho' I value't much, you see, I stake it, And if you win it from me, you must take it. Scape-Rope: Agreed!—I'll make thee own thy Folly soon, And to my Knife will add thy Sukey's Spoon See Shoat, that grinning Knave does trudge this Way, Let him be judge, who sings the better song. Cutpurse: Begin then Strait, thy very awkward Song; I promise, not to be behind thee long. Come neighbour Shoat, tis not of little Weight; Mind which of us sings best; &amp; judge aright. Shoat: Ay, ay, My Lads; begin; so cold's the Day, No Danger that your Cows too far will stray; Or if they do, they'll come to feed at night. There is no tending of Cattle in the summer after April, but they range at Liberty, where they will; And about the middle of November they begin to feed them night &amp; morning; at which Time the Season begins to grow cold. Come make a Fire, &amp; let us all sit by't; You, Cutpurse, first; then you, in answer sing; And I'll soon tell which merits most the String. Cutpurse: Be Rum Rum suppos'd to destroy as many here for the number of the People, as Spirits of all Kinds do at Home. 'bove ev'ry Earthy Thing my Choice; Rum makes me work &amp; animates my Voice. Scape-Rope: To me good Cyder's the more welcome Draught; If I've enough of that, I'm thankful for't. Cutpurse: 'Tis me black Juno pats, the wanton Queen; Then hides herself, &amp; twitters to be seen. Scape-Rope: But Jenny oft aside with me has gone; Myself not to my Cows am better known Cutpurse: Ribbons to Juno, fine Ones I design; Ribbons I'll buy her, when the money's mine. Scape-Rope: Kerchiefs to Jenny I've already given; Tho' yet she 'as had but three, I'll make 'em even. Cutpurse: O what kind Whispers from the Slut I've heard; Tho! lest her Dame shou'd catch her, much afraid. Scape-Rope: When on poor Jenny's Hide the Lash I hear; Her Smart's not less, tho' I the Torment Share. Cutpurse: Soon shall I have my Dues; ye Lasses, come And Jovial Lads; I'll glut you all with Rum. When the Convicts have serv'd out their seven years they have certain dues allow'd them by an Act of Parliament; which they very commonly spend in an Entertainment on their Friends. Scape-Rope: I shall in Time be free—Arriv'd the Day; Ye Lads &amp; Lasses, we wll sing &amp; play. Cutpurse: My Overseer I've oft a Cuckold made, And his Wife tells me, I'm a clever Lad. Scape-Rope: And dost thou brag of that; thou silly Elf; My Master out, I kiss my Dame herself. A Case common among the lower Tribe of Planter's wives. Nay indeed, not twenty years ago the major Part of a whole Bench of justices in a Certain County were not only open adulterers, but as remarkable Cuckolds! Cutpurse: My Master loves to hear My Fecund Song, For this I work with Pleasure all Day long. Scape-Rope: My Master sings himself; so glad's his Heart, That in each drunken Catch he'll bear a Part. Cutpurse: Who loves the honest Planter, may he swill In Bumbos A common Word in Maryland. &amp; in Cyder, when he will. Scape-Rope: And he who likes the man that sings unwell; Let him d[a]mn'd &amp; Anthems chant in Hell. Cutpurse: Ha! Rascals, while you lurk to steal all Night Take Care you do not get a Whipping by't. Scape-Rope: Forbear my Lads, in Time, &amp; be not mad; For I now suffer for the filching Trade. Cutpurse: Ho! Sambo, drive those oxen from the Spring; Myself will Time enough their Fodder bring. Scape-Rope: Lads, feed the Cows; if they Shou'd once go dry; Milk wou'd be wanting to our Huomini. Hominee of two Sorts; the Small Hominee eat with Milk. Cutpurse: L-as! see yon butting Bull is wondrous lean; Love makes the Herdsman &amp; the Herds look thin. Scape-Rope: That's not the Cause the Yearlings are so poor; They're sure bewitch'd by some old ugly Whore. Cut-Purse: Tell us the reason when we at home again, We yet our itching Fingers can't restrain. Tis been observed that even those Convicts that have Liv'd honestly here, &amp; have prov'd good and faithful Servants to their masters, have, when they have gone Home, either been hang'd or return'd, in a short Time; &amp; I myself have known two or three, who had a good character of their masters, &amp; who have sold the dearest from that Character, a third Time brought into the Country. Scape-Rope: Say, when the Girls with eating Chalk are pale, Say, what will make them ruddy fresh &amp; hale. Shoat: You've both perform'd so ill, I can't say which Doest most deserve the Honours of the Switch. Might I advise, who first of you shall sing, Shall make his Exit in a hempen String. For shame! ha' done—I ne'er heard such before; And Heav'n forefend, I e'er should hear you more. THE M[ARYLAND]D-D[IVIN]E Ecloga 4th Argument The Satyr here is on those of the Clery, who, after they have try'd in vain, to get a gentile Maintenance in another Profession, fly to the Church as their last Refuge, &amp; are too apt (as Experience sadly shews) by their imprudent Behaviour to bring a Disgrace upon their Office. Ye Severn Severn, a River on the mouth of which Annapolis the Metropolis of Maryland is built; &amp; this Eclogue seems to have a particular Eye on sev'ral Places to that polite Place. Nymphs, attempt a nobler song; Tho' meaner Themes delight the vulgar Throng, Slaves, Convicts, scoundrel Subjects please not all; Sublimer Minds for loftier Numbers call. Such then I'll sing, wou'd Baldus Baldus—This &amp; the other names in this Ecologue have much puzzled me; but I presume they are Gentleman, which sometimes or other have distinguish'd themselves in the Author's Company: Baldus especially appears to be one of extraordinary note. lend an Ear, As Baldus' self wou'd not disdain to hear. Now, now's arrived the long expected Time Old Hoeus had foretold in tuneful Rhime. Now M[arylan]d a Set of Priests This must not be understood of them all; for there are really sev'ral of them that have done Honour to their Profession, &amp; tis observ'd the Gentleman that come over alate, have had more Learning &amp; Piety too that their Predecessors can boast To slavish Principles of Truth not lost: Whose golden Tongues true Freedom shall restore And make those cease to pray, who pray'd before. And so the Doctrines of our Faith explain, As serves make th' Observance of 'em vain. Caress them, Baldus, great to them thy Debt; For faith! thyself &amp; they are nicely met. To thy auspicious Rule all Bliss we owe, And Epochas of Blessings wait us now. Our Leader thou; if any Marks remain Of blind Subjection to the Priestly Chain, These deep Divines the Darkness shall remove, In Freedom's Cause Hiberno's self shall prove; Thomaso's Genius shall their Breasts inspire, And fill them with his own persuasive Fire. O happy Priest! Your Forties shall be paid, And old Hybernio too, shall give his Aid, Hybernio who at Parsons long has growl'd, And rail'd at Bishops like an errant Scold. But make a jest of Jesus &amp; his Laws, And he without a Fee will plead you Cause. To you the Fair in Clusters shall repair, The glorious Doctrines that you teach to hear. E'en all the Church &amp; Parson shall entoll; And why, 'cause now twill be no Church at all. Now Tindal's System's ev'ry where received, And Collins, Morgan, Whoolstan all believ'd, Now sits great Sh[aftesbury] on each Heart enthron'd, And Mandevil's with highest Honour's crown'd. I myself have heard these Gentlemen's Systems approv'd by some of the Clergy. Some few Remains of Truth howe'er shall be, Some stubborn Souls won't with these Schemes agree, There are indeed some worthy Gentlemen, who, spite of the Politeness that prevails, still think the Truths in that exploded Book the Bible serious, &amp; fashion their Lives according to the Rules it gives us. Will own a Saviour, &amp; will think him God. Of honest Faith will Still endure the Load: Will think the Sacraments art awful Things, And great the Transports true Religion brings. In short, in Spite of all these Sons of Reason, Will still be Godly, tho' tis out of Season. No more than Britain need our Parsons come, Enough we have, that better know at Home. The common Cant of a great many of the polite Marylanders. No more the beardless Boy Damnation fears, But at such Old Wive's Fables nobly sneers; The tim'rous Girl that wont to fear an Oath, And trembled at the Thought of Breach of Troth, Now smiles at Perjuries—the Reason's plain By Gospel-Laws who wou'd themselves restrain? This has an Eye to the mercenary Temper of the young Girls, who after the most solemn Promises to one Lover, never scruple to marry another that is richer, &amp; has the approbation of the generality for it. They socrn, with self-sufficient Wisdom fraught, By Bibles or by Parsons to be taught. Thus spoke they to each other; 'now's the Time, ‘Let's to the Honours of the Forties climb; ‘Tho 'tis a Trade, tis yet a gainful Trade; ‘Better help on the Cheat, than not have Bread, ‘Both Law &amp; Physick Starves, too well we know, ‘And tho' we've hardly common sense, twill do.’ O had I strength but equal to my will, These glorious Wights shou'd be my Subject still; Nor shou'd e'en L[ewi]s poor, unhappy Bard, A Gentleman who had a pretty Vein in Poetry, &amp; like other sons of Parnassus, was very poor; he was also a fine Gentleman, &amp; laught at Religion with the rest. Be read with more Delight or more Regard. L[ewi]s, on whom the Muse her Favours Shed And yet to Want her Favourite betray'd. Nay, M[arylan]d, Spite of herself, Shall own, Their Preaching by my Poetry out done; I'd paint them out, just in the Light I ought; And shew the wondrous Lessons they have taught. Go on; as yet you hardly know your Pow'r; Harangue 'gainst sacred Doctrines ev'ry Hour; With Love of Truth, with Love of Freedom fill'd, To moral Systems bid the Bible yield; So shall his fav'rite Priests great Baldus make ye; And to his inmost Soul &amp; Counsels take ye. TOSS-POT Eclogue the 5th Argument Love-Rum &amp; Ever-Drunk, two planters, meeting together, to take a Morning's Draught, resolve to divert one another with a Song; But think none so proper, as what relates to their old Companion, Toss-pot, whose Worth, the Loss they receive by his Death, &amp; his Admission into the happy Shades of honest Topers they merrily sing. Love-Rum, Ever-Drunk Love-Rum: Since, Everdrunk, we're here so nicely met Beneath these Trees let's take a Morning's Wet; And as we're both old Dabsters at a Song, A merry Catch won't make it seem too long. Daphnis; Ecloga 5ta Menalcas, MopsusMe: Cur-non, Mopse, boni quoniam convenimus ambo, Tu calamos inflare leves, ego dicere versus, Hic corylis mixtas inter consedimus ulmos. Ever-Drunk: Agreed—We two such bon Companions are, If you once bid me sing, I can't forbear: Say, shall we sit beneath these shady Boughs, Or wou'd you rather walk into the House? Mo: Tu major; tibi me est aequum parere, Menalca Sive sub incertas Zephyris motantibus umbras, Sive antro potius succeedimus— Love-Rum: I think in all our Country there's but one, Can sing with you, &amp; that is Boozy John. Mo: Quid si idem certet Phoebum superare canendo? Ever-Drunk: Why; e'en at church he makes so great a roar, The Clerk declares he'll sing the Psalm no more. Love-Rum: Begin then First; No Love-song have you got 'Bout Nancy's Charms? the brave &amp; valiant Scot, Or bouncing Nell most woundily wou'd please— —Cato, I see, is cropping round the Trees.— Me: Incipe Mopse prior, si quos aut Phillidus ignes, Aut alconis habes laudes aut jurgia Codri. —Pascentis servabit Tityrus haedos. Ever-Drunk: I'll give you then a Song I lately made; From Boozy John, a Better you ne'er had. Mo: Imo haec, in virdidi nuper quae cortice fagi Carmina descripsi— Experiar; tu deinde jubeto certet Amintas. Love-Rum: Pho! Man; he sing with you; I'd think as soon, Twas lighter far at Midnight than at Noon; Or that a Weevil's A very small Insect that does great damage to Corn &amp; Bread. larger than a Mouse. Me: Lenta salix &amp;c. judicio nostro tantum tibi cedit Amintas. Ever-Drunk: Enough, old Lad—Come, walk into the House— —When Tosspot died, Lord! What a do we made; The planters round lamented, he was dead: While 'bout his Clay-cold cor[p]se poor Susy hung, And sigh'd so deep, she cou'd not use her Tongue. Mo: Sed tu desine plura, successimus antro. Extinctum Nymphae crudeli funere Daphnim Flebant— Cum complexa sui Corpus miserabile nati; Atque deos atque vocat crudelia Mater. None now our Guts with Ham &amp; Chicken fill; Nor can we in our much-lov'd Bumbo swill; Toss-pot, there's not an honest Lad alive, But t' have thee here again, his Soul wou'd give. Toss-pot wou'd make the wisest Man a Fool, And give new Life, if we were e'er so dull; Wou'd make us drink, till we cou'd drink no more, But cover'd with our Carcases the Floor. Daphni, tuum Poenos etiam in gemuisse leones Interitum Daphnis &amp; Armenias curru subjungere tygres Instituit; Daphnis Thiasos inducere Baccho, Et foliis lentas intexere Mollibus hastas. Vitis ut arboribus &amp;c. As of all Liquors Rum delights the best, And 'midst all Food, good Ham excels the rest; So 'mongst us Planters there was none became, So well the Business, or deserv'd the name. His Death of all our fud[d]ling Bouts bereft us, Sober, we've gone to Bed, since he has left us. Where wont the Silver Tankard to be brought, With Nutmeg'd Cyder for a Morning's Draught, Tu deccus omne tuis. Postqum te fata tulerunt Ipsa Pales agros, atque ipse reliquit Apollo Grandi saepe &amp;c. Now can we scarce regale on thin small Beer, And Ten to One! that's dead—&amp; never clear. For the full Bowl, Obedient to our Call, Alass! What meet us now? Faith! nought at all. Come, Brother Planters, dance we round his Grave; Such Honours fit it is our Friend shou'd have; Each bring his Song &amp; Bowl &amp; toss 'em off; Spargite humum Foliis &amp;c. Our Value, our great Regard, we can't shew enough, For him we ne'er can show Regard enough. His Influence still shall warm us, when we meet, And, tipsy, we shall think, we have him yet. Formosi pecoris custos, formosior ipse. Love-Rum: As, when confounded drunk, a Nap to take Makes me quite gay and spritely when I wake; As in the Morning—Drunkards then are dry— Small-Beer does e'en a grateful Draught supply: So does thy well-made Song delight me now; Nor e'er a better have I heard, I vow. Me: Tale tuum carmen nobis, Quale Sopor fessis in Gramine, quale per aestum Dulcis aquae saliente Sitim restinguere rivo. But I must have my Song, as well as you, And I've a good One—'Tis on Tosspot too— The honest Fellow lov'd me, as his Life— —I'm sure, much better than he did his Wife. Nos tamen haec quocunque mod tibi nostra vicissim Dicemus, Daphninque tuum tollemus ad astra. —amavit nos quoque Daphnis. Ever-Drunk: You can't oblige me more—Friend Rumps declar'd, A feater Song than yours he never heard; And well poor Toss-pot merited our Lay's, Since 'Twas his continual care his Friends to please. Mo: An quicquam nobis tali sit munere majus; Et puer ipse fuit cantari dignus, &amp; ista jam pridem stimicon laudavit carmina nobis. Love-Rum: When Toss-pot's Spirit left his breathless Clay, And to more solid Pleasures wing'd away; Where he, with happy Topers, gone before, Might swallow Nectar, &amp; more nobly roar; With joy ourselves &amp; Mates all gather'd round And all our sorrows in our Bumpers drown'd: Me: Candidus insuetum &amp;c. Ergo alacris silvas &amp; cetera rura voluptas Panaque postoresque tenet, Dryadasque puellas. Our Negroes all their Hardships quite forgot, Our Overseers the Seasons heeded not; Times for the managing of Tobacco, which can never be medled with, but in the rain. Toss-pot lov'd Ease &amp; Indolence—So we To go the Road he led us, all agree. With Toss-pot's Name the neighbouring Woods resound, And distant Mountains eccho back the Sound: A Saint we've made him &amp; his constant Task's To hover o'er the Punch-Bowls &amp; the Flasks. For which we'll yearly Honours to him pay, For his sake drink our very souls away. Ipsi laetitia voces Deus, Deus ille, Sis bonus O felixque tuis En quatour aras Pocula bina &amp;c. As oft as boozy thy old Friend shall be, My Catches, Toss-pot, shall be all of Thee; With soaking Tom, &amp; toping Hodge I'll join, And make thy mem'ry &amp; thy Fame divine. Yes while in Woods fell Wolves shall chuse to rove, While Humming-Birds Very small and a very beautiful Bird that is seen all over America in the Summer; flying and humming about the flow'rs. &amp; Bees sweet Blossoms love, Thy name, thy Praise, thy Honour shall remain,— Gad! if they don't I'll ne'er get drunk again. Cantabunt mihi Damoetas &amp; Lyctius Aegon. Dum juga montis aper,— Dumque thymo pascentur apes— Semper honos nomenque tuum laudesque manebunt. Ever-Drunk: What does thy Song deserve? A North-West Wind In Summer's Heat can't better Welcome find; Not yon green Waves, that grumble 'gainst the Shore, Nor that smooth murm'ring Stream, delight me more. Mo: Quae tibi, quae tali reddam pro carmine dona? Nam neque me tantum venientis Sibilus Austri Nec percussa juvant fluctu tam littora, nec quae Saxosas inter decurrunt flumina valles. Love-Rum: This, 'Baccostopper first do thou receive; Me: Hac te os fragili donabimus ante cicuta. The same I thought t' our Parson once to give; But faith! I think it better here bestow'd, And I'll assure it made of stoutest Wood. Ever-Drunk: And here's a Gourd the neatest of the Sort, Gourds here grow very large; &amp; of great use; on various accounts, the great ones, to keep Fat, Flow'r, &amp;c., the less, for water. Old jerom Crump bad me a Shilling for't, Tho', being an Assembly-man his wound is great, Mo: At tu sume pedum, quod me cum Saepe rogaret Non tulit Antigenes (et erat tum dignus amari ?. I'd rather you the Triffle wou'd accept. CELSUS Eclogue 6th Argument The great Progress of Infidelity gives rise to this Poem; &amp; I can hardly call it even an Imitation of the Eclogue. The Imitation so small, that I shan't think it worth my while to mark out the few Places, where I have follow'd the Poet. I cou'd wish there was no Occasion for the Satyr in it; &amp; am sorry to say some very great men make the important Truths of our holy Religion the daily Subjects of the wanton Raillery! The Author will venture to affirm, That nothing is here suppos'd to be said by Celsus, but what he has actually heard often &amp; vehemently maintained in common Conversation. The first was I, who thought it worth my while, Of Mary-Land to Speak in any Style; Nor bless'd my Muse—a modest girl you'll say— Her wondrous Sons to sing in rustick Lay— Assembly Men, &amp; Counsellors, &amp; jars Surely our Author is here upon the Sneer, for I never knew one Squabble they ever had that was worth a wise Man's regarding at all; or even a Bavius's making an Epigram on. In highflown Numbers thought I to rehearse; No; she reply'd;—too ventrous are the Themes; Nor dare you triffle with those glorious Names. What Worth they have, deserving nobler Rhimes, Some, tuneful Bard shall sing in blither Times. Thy humbler Verse of Celsus' Worth shall tell, Celsus, who is Himself's own Parallel; Celsus, whose large capacious Soul's too great, Things sacred with the least Regard to treat: He keeps with W?n, M?n strict Alliance, And holds Priests, Prophets, Gospels, at Defiance! 'Gainst Creeds with what persuasive Force he raves; How scorns the Wretches Priestly, Pow'r enslaves? Yet when, Himself his Rheth'rick flings about, And gives 'gainst Heav'n &amp; Ch[urch] his dictates out; Whate'er he says, his Hearers must believe; What he calls Truth implicitly receive. Thus is the Wight the very Priest, he blames, This the case of too many of the Maryland Gentry, who, without any Education still fancy themselves wiser than all the great Men that went before 'em, &amp; expect all they say to be receiv'd as Oracles. And the same Track pursues that he condemns. On then, my Muse—Once visited the Sage, Thoughtless &amp; Rakely, Youths of equal Age, Of equal Warmth in Reason's mighty Cause, Of like Invet'racy to Tyrant-Laws. Oft had he promis'd to their longing Heart A Schedule of his fav'rite, Scheme t' impart. They now demand it—He with gracious Eyes Benignly to their fond Request replies: ‘Children, I'll all your doubtings joyful clear; ‘just is the Boon you ask; attentive Hear.’ He said, &amp; strait a Silence most profound, Still as the Dead of night reign'd all around. E'en Crab, his fav'rite Foist, Foist, a name for a little dog. was quite struck dumb, Nor Puss has stir'd, tho' Mouse, had crost the Room. As serious as Dan: Burgess did he look, As grave as Nailor's were the Words he spoke. Well does our Author sneer those two Enthusiasts, for to their followers is in great measure owing the Infidelity of the Marylanders; whom having too much sense to be Quakers &amp; too much Pride to submit to the Establish'd Church, set up for Free Thinkers &amp; drown what Sense they have in an arrogant Self-Conceit. First, then he sung how this round Spacious Ball Once on a Time, was a huge Chaos all; Till Chance, a mighty Pow'r, but who or what, Was far beyond this Ken—that matter'd not— Bad Order from Confusion to arise, And thus form'd Lands &amp; Seas, &amp; liquid Skies. Next, [God] he sung, but such a [God] as shew'd I'm afraid this may be thought treating a serious Subject in too ludicrous a Manner. Certain I am, the Author had the highest Veneration not only to the divine Being consider'd as his Creator; but with regard to ev'ry Relation he bears to us according to the Christian Scheme. He thought he very little to him ow'd; Too great, too glorious, &amp; too unconfin'd, The paltry Bus'ness of our Earth to mind, And therefore left poor Mortals to their Passions, To do what suited best their Inclinations. Then sacred Story was his Scoundrel-Theme, And wondrous wisely did he now declaim: Adam &amp; Eve Non-Entities were made; No Serpent yet a Woman e'er betray'd; Noah's a Blockhead, &amp; Cham Serv'd him right, T'expose, His Weakness to his Brother's Sight; Abr'ham's great Faith was nothing but a name, And Moses cheated Israel with a Sham: Sampson's vast Strength deserves our Ridicule, David's a Villain, Solomon a fool; David in particular is sadly maul'd, &amp; a certain—himself have been known to call him the grandest Villain that ever liv'd: But no wonder, he meets with no better Treatment from a Common Sharper. By childish whims were fill'd the Prophets all, No more inspir'd by H[eave]n, than by Baal. And the whole Bible's a notorious Cheat, A Maintenance for lazy Priests to get. The Gospel next his Eloquence commands, And now he loudly Ch[rist] himself arraigns. A pack of Sots is ev'ry Ch[ri]st[ia]n, Nation, And gull'd the World had been, e'er since the Passion. And they, who his Absurdities believe, A just Pretence alone to Wisdom have. —But hark! the Muse is shock'd Shock'd indeed; Ev'ry serious Ear must be shock'd at the daily Conversation of our pretended Solomons.—She bids me cease These Outrages against the Prince of Peace: And to those other glorious Tenets haste, Which wondrous Celsus to the Youths exprest. The Sacraments he made of equal Force To save a Ch[ri]st[ia]n, as to save a Horse: No sacrifice of Praise did H[ea]v[e]n require, And fruitless, needless all were Forms of Pray'r. By Consequence no Need there was of Teaching, And P[a]r[s]ons shou'd be planting, instead of preaching. The constant Part of 'em all to a Man—Indeed we are so unhappy, that not a few of our Clergy wou'd become a Hoe, better than a Pulpit. In short, Religion was the Child of Pow'r, To keep poor ign'rant Man from knowing more, Than what their wise Forefathers knew before. Hence then, this Inference he plainly drew, Our Passions shou'd be all submitted to; Pray why were they bestow'd if not employ'd, And what are Blessings, that are not enjoy'd? Come then, indulge where Humane Laws permit, Hell, Devil defy, these School-boy Fears forget, Hell &amp; Devil now are old antiquated Notions &amp; as such Laugh'd at here, as ever they were at St. ?'s. Dare any Act, but what may cause you swing: Libel your G[od], your Country &amp; your King; Debauch a diff'rant Fair one ev'ry Night; The Nuptial Tie's an Imposition quite. Go Bravely on—No After-Reck'ning fear, With which old Dreamers frighten Children here When Death invades, the Humane Frame's no more, This is really the Doctrine they teach, &amp; endeavour to persuade themselves of, in Spite of that unwelcome Monitor, their Conscience, who is always telling them quite the Reverse. Than just the empty nought it was before. Souls we've no more, than has a Bug, a Mite, And all is wrapt in one eternal Night: No Heav'n, no Hell will be hereafter seen, But we shall be, as tho' we' had never been. He ceas'd—the list'ning Youths around him bow'd, And grateful own'd what mighty Thanks they ow'd. His fine Harangue, enraptur'd Hearts approv'd, While Tray began to bark, &amp; puss remov'd: Some farther Time in friendly Converse spent, Away well-pleas'd with Blasphemy they went! JEMIMA [Eclogue 8th] Argument Jemima, forsaken by her Lover Crocus, goes to Granny, an old Midwife, famous among Planter's Wives &amp; Daughters for her great Skill in Charms &amp; Enchantments; where Jemima complains much of her Lover's Cruelty &amp; Perfidiousness; &amp; then Granny endeavours to get the disconsolate fair One another, tho' alas! for once she fails &amp; loses her Labour. Poor sad Jemima's Jemina, a name extremely common in this Country. doleful Plaints I sing; And the kind of Comfort Granny strove to bring: At which grave Puss, unmindful of her Prey, Stood so aghast, the Vermin stole away. Nay, e'en the Fire, (if all was said, is true) Struck with sage Granny's magick Force, burnt blue. Thou, Celia, Any body, whom the Reader, pleases. deign to listen to the Theme, Thou Glory of my Lays, from whence their Influence came. By Crocus By Crocus one wou'd think he meant some ship surgeon, of which this Country is full, where they administer their Poysons under the pompus name of Doctors. long Jemina had been woo'd, At last he'ad gain'd the Point he'ad long persued. Her kind Consent was one—the happy Night's Appointed to begin Connubial Rites. When, basely treach'rous to th'expecting Maid, He left her, a more wealthy Fair to wed; And now he revels in Dorinda's Charms, Forgetful of Jemima's vacant Arms. While the poor Girl pours forth her vain Complaints, And 'gainst the perjur'd Wretch her Curses vents. True;—oft she'ad thus been us'd by other Men; But thought it wondrous hard, to be so us'd again. Twas Night; the grateful Dew carest the Glade, When to old Granny's Hut repairs the Maid; Granny, fam'd matron, vers'd in midnight Lore; O'er Ghosts &amp; Stars &amp; Devils great her Pow'r, Such she to whom for Ease Jemima run; She wip'd her blubber'd Cheeks, &amp; thus begun. Jemima O Chearful God of Day, restore the Morn, While I with fruitless Love for Crocus burn: Crocus, who soon my easy Heart deceiv'd; Ye Pow'rs! ye know it, tho' ye've not reliev'd: Witness you are of my Distress in vain: Begin, my Heart, begin the Plaintive Strain. Crocus is married to Dorinda fair, What Lover now has Reason to despair, Let Sc[o]ts &amp; Buckskins A Name, given the Country-born in Derision, from the great number of Deer in the Country. now together join, And cleanly Polecats mix with cleanlier Swine; Dorinda go; the nuptial Candle light; Perhaps one Candle he'll allow to Night; Too great th' Expence for him t'indulge again, From this &amp; sev'ral other Hints, tis plain this Eclogue has it's Foundation on Truth. Begin, my Heart, begin the Plaintive strain. O better match'd, than thou cou'dst e'er expect, While thus you treat me with unjust Neglect; While thus my Face once flatter'd you despise, And view my Features with ill-natur'd Eyes, You think the Gods to punish you disdain; Begin, my Heart, begin the plaintive Strain. First, when I saw you twas with Captain Grim Strait, strait I lov'd, you look'd so gay &amp; trim: Then were my years I think scarce twenty four; A great age for an unmarried woman in Maryland. Happy indeed, had I ne'er seen you more. I saw, was lost, siez'd with the raging Pain; Begin, my Heart, begin the plaintive Strain. I know thee, Love; a savage Life thou'st led; In some hard Highland Rock with Crows bred; None of our Buckskin Blood runs in thy Veins; Begin, my Heart, begin the plaintive strains. 'Tis Love, hard-hearted Love, has oft imbrued The mother's Hands in her poor Infant's Blood; Such Mothers sure must bear a cruel Heart: Yet, Cupid! Thou by far more cruel art; To thy vile Ends such hapless nymphs to gain; Begin, my Heart, begin the plaintive strain. Now fly the Wolf at the young Lamb's Pursuit Produce the knotty Oak delicious Fruit; With tuneful Mocking-Birds A remarkable Bird, whose Musick equals any of the feather'd Choir, &amp; has this peculiar to it, that it can imitate any other Bird it hears. let Owls contend, Their Lives let Planters thro' D-ll's See Eclogue the first Preaching mend, And free from scandal let our Priests remain; Begin, my Heart, begin the plaintive Strain. Ye woods, farewel; let all be Seas around; My Sorrows soon shall in their Waves be drown'd, My faulting Tongue no longer shall complain, But, my Heart, cease at once the plaintive Strain. She ceas'd—Old Granny pitied much her Case, And sooth'd with sof'ning words her great Distress; Bad her be calm, nor for one Youth run mad, If Charms cou'd do't another shou'd be had; Jemima beg'd that she might have one soon; The mumping Beldam grin'd, &amp; thus begun. Granny Bring Water, &amp; this Circle sprinkle round, With Greens &amp; Ribbands be this Threshold burn'd, Tho' I your former Lover can't restore, Court the desponding Maid, one Lover more. What wondrous Things my pow'rful Charms have done, How oft against her Will brought down the Moon? E'en Snakes themselves I've stiffen'd many a Score; Court the desponding Maid, one Lover more. This particolour'd Ribband, fair One, take, And true Love Knots of various Fashion make; Tie, tie 'em fast &amp; Venus' Aid implore; Court the desponding Maid, one shepherd more. As this Wax Image melts afore the Fire, With Love of Thee some Youth shall yet expire; Thou want'st a Husband—all thy Wants are o'er; Court the desponding Maid, one Lover more. For am'rous Transports such thy wondrous Love, That Sows themselves not greater Longings prove, I can't help owning, that this Simile, tho strong, is yet too coarse; yet if we consider the Plenty of Hogs in this Country, &amp; how nearly allied in nature the People are to this useful animal, we shall the more readily excuse the author. When thro' the Woods they seek the foamy Boar; Court the desponding Maid, one Lover more. These Presents, which the faithless Lover left, Pledges of Love, tho' of that Love bereft, Hide deep beneath the Threshold of the Door. Court the desponding Maid, one Lover more. To me these Poisons an old Negro gave, Negroes, especially the saltwater ones, remarkable for their skill in Poysons, of which they sometimes gives too fatal Instances. Mighty his knowledge in them, tho' a Slave, Strange Things with them he'as done, strange Changes made, As if all Hell itself came to his Aid. With these the very Graves can I explore; Court the desponding Maid, one Lover more. Within this Door, Jemima, Ashes bring, And o'er thy Head into that Riv'let fling; Look not behind; some shepherd thou shalt see, If there is Truth or in my Charms or me: Ha! Sure I am, I never fail'd before; O Court the hapless Maid, one Lover more. See how in vain I all my Arts have tried; My sullen Sprites have all the Aid denied; Ah! poor Jemima! all thy Hopes are o'er, Die an old Maid, nor think of Lover more! Gachradidow Eclogue the 9th Argument Tachanoontia, &amp; Gachradidow, two Indians, meeting together, bewail the common Loss of their Lands, usurp'd by the English; thence are led to celebrate the Worth of Shuncallamie, one of their Chiefs; &amp; at last, Gachradidow sings in Praise of that Liberty which in the most severe Distresses they are still resolv'd to enjoy. Tachanoontia, Gachradidow, Tachanoontia: Hoa, Gachradidow, whither art thou going? Moeris: Ecloga 9a Lycidas, MoerisLy: Quo' te, Moeri, pedes? an quo via ducit in urbem? Gachradidow: To Town, to pay some Skins Deer Skins;—the Indians kill a great many, &amp; sell the skins for Triffles to the Traders. I've long been owing. —O Tachanoontia, see our Wayward Fate; Strangers how Lord it, where we liv'd alate, ‘Away, you Scoundrels, you've no Business here;’ Are Sounds which once we thought to hear. Now driven far distant from our native Lands, (So Heav'n ordains—that Heav'n, which all commands). We live in Want, in Poverty, in Pain, And part with all our Skins for little Gain. Mo: O Lycida, vivi pervenimus, advena nostri, (Quod nunqm veriti sumus) ut possessor agelli Diceret: Haec mea sunt; veteres migrate coloni. Nunc victi, tristes, quoniam fors omnia versat, Hos illi mittimus haedos. Tachanoontia: Surely I've heard—if what I've heard, is true— That by our Indian Road a Line they drew, Which Line by Treaty was the Barrier made, For both, all future Wranglings to evade. Ly: Certe equidem audieram, qua se subducere colles Incipiunt &amp;c. Omnia carminibus vestrum servasse Menalcan Gachradidow: 'Twas Truth;—But what will Treaties e'er avail With Christian-Whites, whose Av'rice grasps at all? As wisely might you hope, the plaintive Dove The hungry Eagle's empty Maw might move. Mo: Audieras &amp; fama fuit: sed carmina tantum Nostra valent, Lycida, tela inter Martia quantu Chaonais dicunt aguila veniente, columbas. Soon they encroach'd upon us, kill'd our Deer And, did they not our wild Resentment fear, Of all our Lands we'ad quickly been depriv'd, And must without our Venison have liv'd: Your Gachradidow wou'd have wanted Pone, Bread made of Maize or Indian Corn. And what wou'd great Shuncallamie ha' done? Nec tuus hic Moeris, nec viveret ipse Menalcas Tachanoontia: Shuncallamie? Wou'd he to Ills submit, Whose stubborn Soul ne'er knew a Master yet? Ly: Quis caneret Nymphas? quis &amp;c. Who then should teach our brawny youth to sling The hissing Stone, or missive Shaft to wing? Who bid 'em, with loud chearful Cries, advance Against the hostile Fort, in Warlike Dance? Who sing our Warriours in melodious Strains, How they with Villain Blood have died the Plains; How with Katawby A nation of Indians ever in war with the Indians of the Six Nations; who are the Borderers on Mary Land, Penn. &amp; New York. At the last Treaty between Virg &amp; Mard with the S Nat, when the Virginians would have made Peace between them, our Indians said the Kat had so affronted them that they never wou'd, &amp; had called them women &amp; not men; whereas themselves were men &amp; double men for they had two—.—Furies they've engag'd, And War unequal, tho' successful wag'd?

Tho' Swarms of Ch[ri]stian-Scoundrels round us roam, Afraid, at least, asham'd, to stay at Home, In good Truth; the case of most of us. In strains as sweet as Mocking-bird's we'll shew, Mo: Imo haec quae Varo canebat Vare, tuum nomen. Cantantes sublime ferent ad sidera cycni Our gen'rous Hearts with Love of Freedom glow.

Ly:— Incipe, &amp; me fecere poetam Pierides; sunt &amp; mihi carmina; me quoque dicunt Vatem Pastores Neque adhuc vario videor nec dicere Cinna Digna, sed argutos inter strepere anser olores Gachradidow: I will—nor shall my Song unworthy be Of what we hold most dear, blest Liberty. Here then, O Goddess, midst our Tribes remain; With Us, thy faithful Race, for ever reign; Mo: Id quidem ago neque est ignobile Carmen. Hec ades, O Galatea Hic ver purpureum &amp;c. Poor as we are, our wide-extended Waste, Our Christal Streams, which yield a cool Repast, Our lofty Forests all shall witness be, How much we love, how greatly honour thee.

The Christian Plans—we neither will obey— What Wonder that these Wretches seek our Shore, Since Wealth, not Thee, O Freedom, they explore? Nor wou'd they come, did not each fruitful Field Large golden Crops of our Tobacco yield.— —What will not Age—My Mem'ry once was strong, And, when a Boy the live-long Day I sung; Now I've my Lays forgot, my Voice I've lost; —Surely my Eyes some Rattlesnake A Serpent illegible well known; there are sev'ral odd notions about it, &amp; this among the rest. hath crost! Omina fert aetas saepe ego longos Cantando puerum memini me condere Soles. Nunc oblita mihi tot carmina; vox quoque Moerim Jam fugit ipsa; lupi Moerin videre priores. Tachanoontia: Why do you rob me of Delight so soon? You've Time enough—As yet tis scarcely Noon. The town's not far—Besides, the Winds are still, Without a Murmur glides this gentle Rill; Et nunc omne tibi stratum silet aequor, &amp; omnes ventosi, ceciderunt murmuris aurea Shrill sounds you Voice along this gloomy Shade— —Or if you're of yon low'ring Cloud, afraid, Sing as we walk—less tedious is the Road— Sing as we walk—I'll help to bear your Load. tamen veniemus in urbem; Aut si, nox pluviam ne colligat ante veremur, Cantantes licet usque (minus via laedit) eamus; Cantantes ut eamus, ego hoc te fasce levabo Gachradidow: No more—we see Shuncallamie to Night; His Voice will give you more sincere Delight. Mo: Desine plura, puer Carmina tunc melius, cum venerit ipse, canemus. WORTHY Ecloga the 10th Argument Worthy, a young Maryland Gentleman, had long courted Flavia, &amp; was kindly receiv'd by her, so far, that he gain'd her consent, &amp; only waited proper Time for the Ceremony. Being oblig'd the meanwhile to make a Voyage to England &amp; a richer match offering, Flavia very prudently accepted of it &amp; left poor Worthy to his fruitless complaints. This Poem was writ, it seems, at the very Time the affair was in agitation, Worthy being an Intimate Friend of the Authors. This my last Labour, gentle Goddess, aid, To Worthy due, by Flavia hapless made; Be such the Song, that she the Bard approve, And listen to the honest Planter's Love. To Worthy who their Measures can refuse? The best in Maryland deserves the Muse. So shall thy Bard acknowledge still thy Sway, And when thou bid'st the Song, attune the Lay. Begin—his gen'rous Passion let us sing, While warbling Mock-Birds usher in the Spring Nor think the cheerful, spritely Labour vain The waving Woods will echo back the Strain! What Groves, my jolly Girls, your forms conceal, When Worthy burns with Love, without Avail? What tow'ring Hills such grateful Prospects shew, Or what meandring Rills so sweetly flow, Your unkind absence from the Youth t'excuse, Not Woods themselves their gen'rous Plaints refuse; E'en Mountains sympathize with him in Grief, And stony Rocks can wish him kind Relief. His faithful Overseer his Task forgets, And every Slave at his misfortune frets: Poor Brother Philip comes to sooth his Pains: All kindly ask what Nymph his suit disdains. E'en Thickscull, 'mongst his Neighbors wondrous wise, Gives him a helping hand, &amp; bravely cries; ‘Pho Man!’ why makst thou such a mighty Pother, ‘Scorn the false Jade, &amp; briskly court another.’ Kind neighbor Twanhum, by his Tresses known, To join his honest Grief with his rides down; Good Parson Saygrace his lov'd Bumbo leaves, Tho' he small Comfort to the Lover gives; Saygrace whose fiery Phiz more brightly shines, Than Lay'rs of Gold in rich Peruvian Mines. ‘Where will this end? he cries, too cruel Love, ‘No skill what'er can from our Hearts remove: ‘As well teach deists faith, &amp; Lawyers Truth, ‘Give Sense to Coxcombs, &amp; to old Maids Youth.’ He sorrowful returns—Yet, gentle Swains, In doleful Ditties sing my am'rous Pains; Some little Ease my harrass'd Soul may feel My hapless Tale in Rhime to hear you tell. O that an Overseer I'ad only been, This cruel Creature I shou'd ne'er have seen; Some Convict-Girl full well had serv'd my Turn, Black Bess at least with equal Flame wou'd burn; And what tho' black she is—The Crabs Crabs very plentiful in the seaside, tho no Lobster. brave food, Tho' it's Form's hideous, yet the meat is good: O Flavia, by this Riv'let's purling stream, These woods, these flow'ry Meads (thy Charms my Theme) O blest with Thee, with that dear Shape &amp; Face, Be me disclaimed, Eternity might pass. Now furious Love boils up my heated Blood, And I cou'd revel in a purple Flood, Cou'd feast on murders &amp; in rapes delight, And 'gainst my dearest Friend for madness fight. Thou far from me the greatest Woes wou'dst dare, Rather than live with me in safety here: O Cruel! Still let not thy haughty Scorn Bring on thy pitiless Soul a like Return: Now, now, of Lover's fatal Woes I sing, And Charms, of Sorrows like my own, the Spring. Yes—in the Woods midst Bears &amp; Wolves I'll roam, The Author here has the advantage of the Bardling at Home, for here are both Bears &amp; Wolves in great Plenty. And think no more of Flavia &amp; of Home: There shall the Trees my fatal Passion wear, The Marks of my fond Love their Barks shall bear. Meanwhile, Scotch-Irish Great numbers of these Gentry in the back Parts of the Provinces &amp; tis hard to say whether the Indians or they are greater Savages. shall my socials be, Wild as they are, quite good enough for me. Or 'gainst the grizley Bear my Rage I'll vent, To trace his Haunts in Freezing Cold content. Now over Rocks &amp; ecchoing Woods I fly, The friendly Indians all my arms supply, As if by this my Soul a Cure cou'd gain, And Heav'n had taught me thus to ease my Pain. Now neither Nymphs nor Songs can yield me Peace, And all the Charms the woodland's gave me, cease; Not all my Cares can change the Tirant-Boy; My Summer's Thirst Patuxent A River on the Western Shore, on which the suppos'd false one lived. may alloy; Winter's most piercing Cold I might endure; But Love still governs all, &amp; will not know a Cure. Enough has Worthy mourn'd—enough I've sung, Due Thanks, ye Planters, to my Lays belong; No more my Pipe with spritely Strains shall swell; Go mind your Hogs &amp; Crops,—&amp; so farewel. My friend here has finish'd, but has left out not imitated the seventh Eclogue of Virgil; What can be Reason; I'm at a Loss; But tis most likely that he died before he had finish'd his Design, for certainly had he liv'd longer, he would have imitated that &amp; left these Poems, he has done, more perfect than they are.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Death of Socrates [Cast of Characters Socrates Philosopher of Athens Xantippe His wife Plato Crito His students Phedon Melitus Lycon His accusers Anitus (Anytus) Apame Melitus's sister First Areopagus Second Areopagus Judges of Athens Crier Bailiff Gaoler Jailer Citizens of Athens] [Act the 1st] [Scene 2d] [Melitus, Anitus] [Melitus] The heavenly powers no doubt entrust their secre[t] With that vain wretch, who dared defy their godhead, And slight their altars. Anitus Thus the bold Lysistratus Won on the people by a like pretence; He too had his Minerva to protect him, To aid his counsels, and support his cause. High on the shining car with him she rode; And the gull'd commons, struck with stupid wonder, Gaz'd on the feign'd divinity, till they Lost their dear liberty, and hug[g]'d the chain Of a foul tirant—Doubt not, Socrates Hath the same view; and if the worthy Melitus, With others that are wakeful for the state, Use not the noble talents heaven has given them, Their pow'rs of speech, their energy of sense, In firm defiance 'gainst his guileful schemes, And timely ward the fatal blow he aims, What can ensue but slavery and ruin? Melitus Such slavery and such ruin as slate Gall'd [illeg.] that villain traitor, Critias. He lorded nobly o'er his fellow-citizens, To death devoted ev'ry man of virtue, And was indeed a tirant—such the ruin The haughty son of Clinias had essay'd, (Whose vile contemptuous usage of the god That guards, benign, our doors still strikes our souls With chilling terrors) had not Athens fear'd Th'impending peril—These thy pupils, Socrates! These are the youths that fondly listen'd to thee; These had'st thou taught in all the secret arts Of thy philosophy; conspicuous proofs Of thy attachment to the publick weal! Anitus What wait we then? Why waste we still the hours In vain complaint? And since our patriot hearts Burn for the injuries our state hath suffer'd, Why don't we rather haste to execute What nobly we've resolv'd—th'applauded deeds Of all the heroes that our Athens boasts, However great, are poor, compar'd with this. T'assert the dread divinities that guard us, To shield their shrines, to vindicate their temples; To free our youth from impious fallacies, From vain illusions and destructive tenets; Our freedom to establish on a base That will be solid, these are godlike toils, And, if we fall, our fate will yet be glorious, Worthy the sons of Athens! Melitus And I'll dare it, Whatever perils face me in the conflict. But there's no peril—be we staunch and honest, And all his subtleties and nice evasions Can's stem the torrent that comes pouring on him. My sister! hah!—I know her simple businesses— Retire we for the present—Well-inform'd Of our design, and stupidly enthral'd In love's fond bondage, her romantick head Thinks high of Socrates, and much she labours To thawart my soul in her confirm'd resolves. In vain! The cause is heav'n's, and I'll be steady. I dearly love her, and she cou'd not ask A second favor that I shou'd deny her. Scene 3rd Apame Thou fly'st me; ah! infatuated brother! Thy sly insinuating Anitus And the fool Lycon lead thee on to ruin. Big with high notions of thy own desert, Thy boasted eloquence, thy cry'd-up wisdom, And proudly swol[le]n with their pernicious praise, Fondly thou think'st to bear down all before thee, To manage Athens, as thy own vain will Suggests, and trample e'en beneath thy feet All that oppose thee in thy windy schemes. 'Cause thou art angry, and yet know'st not why. The venerable Socrates must bleed; That first of men, who mates a god in wisdom, Sent surely as a blessing from above, To teach sublimest truths, to rear the soul 'Bove earthly views, and form her, to embrace Joys more than mortal, bright, etherial, pure And yet this excellent, this peerless sage Must fall the sacrifice of villain malice, Of wicked men who hate him for his virtues. Meanwhile, what sorrows swell my anguish'd bosome, Rent 'twixt distressful passion and the tie That binds me to my brother. Love for Phedon, For Phedon, worthiest of the youths of Athens, Whose truth wou'd shame the constancy of swains; Phedon, adorned with ev'ry mainly grace, That cou'd engage a virgin's tender heart, Fills all my soul, and makes it his entire. Alass! Dear, gen'rous youth! What boots the love, The faithful fondness of thy charm'd Apame, While still her brother with relentless hate, Thwarts all the schemes thou form'st to save thy friend, And aims the ruin of thy dear instructor, The reverend sage thou lov'st to call thy father? The dire result of this I well forebode, And e'en anticipate that weight of woe, That follows close his obstinate pursuit. Scene 4th Apame, Phedon Phedon That pensive posture, and that tearful eye Betray fair excellence, the ill success Of my Apame's pleadings with her brother. Apame O Phedon, Melitus, I fear, is doom'd By the just gods to force his own destruction, His strong inveteracy 'gainst Socrates To them is painful; and for righteous ends Tho' that great man may suffer, still my brother Must feel the utmost fury of their vengeance: For well I know, their justice yet will punish The wretch, a foe to virtues like their own, Phedon Then he's resolv'd? Apame Resolv'd? he shuns his sister; Soon as he saw me, from my sight he fled, Like a base murderer, conscious of his guilt, Who dreads each whisper'd nothing that he hears, And flies the phantom that himself hath form'd. Phedon Then thou must fall, my Socrates: thy soul, Great as hath yet e'er animated man, I know, will bear this stroke of fate undaunted: Will smile at all the malice of her foes, And look with calm indifference on death. Hence spring our fears: Were he like other men, Had he the same weak frailties to lament, Life wou'd appear to some importance to him, And he'd be more sollicitous about her. For, far from this, he thinks not of his danger, As danger; but pursues his wonted course, Directing others in the paths of truth, As if no foes endeavour'd his destruction, And all without was, like his own pure soul, Sweet harmony and peace. Apame This binds me to him, Weak as I am, and of that thoughtless sex, Who seek no further for their rule in life Than the dull road their mothers trod before them; Yet ever hath my heart leap'd at the name Of Socrates; and scarce had reason dacon'd In my young mind; but I grew fond to hear The lessons that he taught; to learn from him Truths, hid before in sophistry's dark guise, And close to follow, where he led the way. The more I knew, more was my joy athirst For higher knowledge; and he still encreas'd, Still as he hed me on, my love of wisdom. But, more than all his wondrous eloquence, His choice expression, and his flow of reason, His practice pleads; unerring in his life, He walks conspicuous in each godlike virtue, And lives himself in the great good man he teaches. Phedon He is indeed the man thy justice speaks him. Nor did he want a herald to his virtues, Cou'd he employ a nobler tongue than thine; For thou art even wanton in his praise, And then shin'st loveliest, when his worth's thy subject. Oh! my Apame! how unlike thy brother. But I'll evade the contrast—he's thy brother, And therefore to a softer theme I'll turn, Such as demands the eloquence of gods, Thy heav'nly beauties, thy divine perfections. Apame Forbear, presuming Phedon— Phedon Listen to me, Nor with that frown indignant kill your Phedon. Say rather; dearest object of my vows; Thou first and only mistress of my heart; Say, wilt thou now with kind relenting eye Hear me pour forth the truest noblest passion That ever swell'd a fond and faithful soul; A soul that lives not but upon the hope, The distant hope that goodness, nigh divine, Will look with pity on the pangs she suffers. Oh! thou art all that fancy's self can paint— All harmony, all excellence, all beauty! Thy form so exquisite, that wou'd the maid, Last of the gods that left our earth reluctant, Once more forsake her natal plains above, And with her presence gladden thankless man; She'd sure shine forth in all the bright effulgence, In the divine attractions of Apame, O stay that killing look—forgive my rapture— Indulge my wanton tongue while she essays A task more arduous, to display the charms, The heavenly beauties of thy matchless mind. Apame Say, is this Phedon, this the strenuous friend Of Socrates, of Socrates the sage, Form'd by his rules, and won by his example, Who can thus poorly waste the precious hours In wordy compliment and vain encomiums On the mean trifle of a woman's beauty? Now when thy friend, thy father, thy instructor Walks on the verge of fate, can thy low soul Sink in the soothings of an idle passion? Phedon Chide not, Apame, chide not; deep I feel The pressing dangers of that virtuous man; And oh! if I had twice ten thousand lives, I'd part will all, nay, almost part with thee, To save him from the direful fate that threats him; For much I fear the pow'r of those that hate him. For what inures my heart amid it's sorrows, What firms my soul, but love of thee, my charmer, Of thee the lover and the friend of Socrates? This ardent passion arms me 'gainst my grief, With manly fortitude, with intrepidity. Forgive me then, nor blame thy faithful Phedon, If in the fullness of his love he speaks The glorious charms of that transcendant maid, Which thus inspires him to sustain each shock, To dare all danger for the friend he loves. Apame No more; but that I know thy honest heart, This flattery wou'd be grating to my ear, Harsh and discordant as an ill-tun'd instrument. 'Tis not by sounds like these I can be won. Yet still forgive me, virgin—modesty— I own thy worth, thy virtues, and thy truth Have made my soul a sharer in thy griefs. But oh! I leave it to thy thought to form The various evils that will thwart our bliss. Still be thyself, still be the friend of Socrates; And if the gods join with thee in thy cares, And crown thy filial friendship with success, Apame then with honour—spare my blushes— What have I said?—my maiden heart condemns me— I dare not stay to tell thee, how I'd thank thee. Scene 5th Phedon Transporting sounds! O my enraptur'd soul! Yes; I will be the friend of Socrates, Will be myself, and will deserve Apame. Thou shalt be mine; for sure the righteous powers Must crown my truth, and thy consummate virtue With ev'ry happiness this earth can yield— But talk'd she not of evils that might bar, Might thwart our bliss? forbid it, heav'n!—the thought, Shou'd I dwell longer on it, wou'd distract me. I'll strive then to forget it, and away To my expecting friends. Scene 6th Plato, Crito, Phedon Plato Tis now the hour That Phedon said he'd meet us. Crito He appears. Phedon Alass! My tiddings bear but slender hope: The foes of Socrates resolve his Death: Apame's not allow'd to see her brother; Sullen he flies her presence, and in vain She strives to turn him from his fatal purpose. Plato What frenzy hath possest the men of Athens? Think they the gods will thank them for their hate To that great man, whom only they allow Sincerely wise? Have they so soon forgot What dread Apollo from the sacred tripod Divinely answer'd to th'enquiring Cherephon, Chaerephon, a youthful friend of Socrates and a member of the democratic party in Athens that was now persecuring the philosopher, once asked the oracle of Apollo at Delphi if there was anyone wiser than Socrates, to which the oracle replied that there was none wiser. Plato, Apology, 20e-21a. That Socrates was wise, and only Socrates? And well the sage responds to the great character The oracle bestows; for sure if wisdom E'er dwell on earth, within his virtuous breast The heav'n-born goddess lives, and sways the man Sways ev'ry action, dictates all his words. Well ye repay the pow'rs divine, Athenians, To work his death, who forms your greatest glory, And makes you foremost in the states of Greece For true philosophy, for solid knowledge! Lo! this is ample gratitude to heaven! Crito Such gratitude hath Athens ever shew'd Where worth illustrious shone. In arts or arms Whoe'er excell'd, but met the like return? Thus Homer, thus Tirtous The reference to Homer is unexplained in this context. Tirtous or Tyrateus was a seventh-century B.C. Spartan general and patriotic poet. Some claimed he was an Athenian schoolmaster before going to Sparta. Cradock's allusion seems to be to the Athenian belief than no Spartan could be a poet, so he had to be a former Athenian. bore their despite; Thus Anexagoras was once condemn'd; Anaxagoras (c. 500-c. 428 B.C.) was probably the first philosopher to reside in Athens. He was exiled for alleged impiety during an attack on his friend Pericles, c. 450 B.C. Miltiades Miltiades (c. 554–489 B.C.) was the Athenian general who directed the victory over the Persians at Marathon in 490 B.C. He was imprisoned by political rivals and died shortly thereafter. thus languish'd in a prison, And great Themistocles Themistocles (c. 524-c. 460 B.C.) was the Athenian admiral who saved Greece from Persian domination as the result of the destruction of Xerxes' fleet off Salamis in 480 B.C. Exiled from Athens, he eventually served Xerxes' son as governor of some Greek cities in Asia Minor that were under Persian control. was forc'd to fly For refuge to the monarch, 'gainst whose tiranny His prudent counsels had preserv'd his country. Phedon Th'unruly populace, who're ever won By the loud rhetorick of a noisy demagogue, Forget the noble actions of their heroes. Their city sav'd, their pow'r maintain'd, enlarg'd, Their wives, their daughters snatch'd from direful rape, Line 38 was Cradock's line 400 for Act 1. And peace and affluence to their streets restor'd; Their youth instructed in each patriot-duty, And form'd to virtue from their infant-years; All these plead vainly with a boistrous rout, Who're giddy with th'authority they bear; And call it glorious freedom to devote Their worthiest citizens to death or exile. Plato Else Socrates who bends beneath the weight Of seventy years, years spent in noblest toils For his dear country's safety or her glory; Might hope to wear away the few poor minutes That yet remain of life, amid his friends, In honourable ease, exempt from danger. Phedon And might he not, did not the 'unworthy Anitus, Whose flagrant guilt can't bear the kind rebuke Of one who but endeavors to reclaim His soul from ruin, urge the prosecution? For Melitus and Lycon are but tools Anytus is considered to have instigated the proceedings against Socrates for worthy motives. His objective wasnot to execute Socrates but rather to exile him as a threat to political stability. Anytus chose an obscure, young religious fanatic named Melitus to prosecute the case. About Lycon very little is known. See A. B. Taylor, Socrates: The Man and His Thought (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1953), pp. 102–4. To his iniquities and mean revenge. Base, he gives up to an unmanly passion, Beneath the soul that is not worse than brutal, Revenge for good intended, such a man, As Athens, if she yields to his delusions, Will ne'er remember but with tears of repentant penitence. Plato Then be't our care to save her from her shame. O friends, O youths, that have with me imbib'd The sacred truths, which, like Hyblean sweets, Hyblean refers to the town of Hybla in Sicily that was celebrated for the honey produced in nearby hills. The bees of Hybla are mentioned in Vergil, Eclogues, 1.54. Flow'd on your souls from his mellifluous tongue; Who've often with unutterable transport Felt the glad influence of his blest instructions; O let us know, unanimous, resolve To thwart the machinations of his foes; To stay the low'ring mischiefs that impend Over our great preceptor. Much we owe To his directing hand. If we are virtuous, If for our country or our friend we feel, If our hearts glow with love of ev'ry grace, That can exalt us 'bove the groveling crowd, Twas he that form'd us; he the sacred spring, From whence our souls drank deep the cordial draught Of heaven-born truth, of knowledge that aspires 'Bove sense, bove appetites, and penetrates Yon empyrean Empyrean pertains to the highest heaven in the cosmology of the ancients. heights; of rapturous wisdom, That teaches us to scorn this lower scene Of mean delights, beneth th'enlightened mind, T'emerge from out the prison of the body. And seek for our inheritance, amid Etherial beings in the realms above. Crito Doubt not, my Plato, but our inmost souls And seek for our inheritance, amid Etherial beings in the realms above. Crito Doubt not, my Plato, but our inmost souls Are link'd with his; and, if he falls, we feel Griefs that wou'd dumb expression.—Name thou then The means to save him, and we joy to dare them E'en at the utmost peril of our lives. Plato Alass! that's only in the will of heav'n, At least, what project can we form at present? If he won't fly, he must submit to trial; All therefore we can do, is to be active, Strenuous, and resolute in his defence; To plead with all the eloquence of tears, To battle 'gainst his enemies, and rather To die— Phedon Imortal gods! wou'd that preserve him, I'd dare a tirant's tortures. Crito So wou'd I, And bless the hand that took my life for his. Plato Bravely resolv'd, my friends! Methinks we are Like a poor people, who beneath the rule Of a just prince have long been blest and happy; When the stern-fates the cruel mandate give To close his precious life: the direful news Link them in wild astonishment, they look Aghast, and, struck with terror, deep they mourn, Fly to their altars, with incessant prayer Plead for his life, recount his gracious deeds, Run o'er his gen'rous cares, his gentle reign; Suppliant, the mercy of high heaven implore, And, to retrieve their prince, will be themselves no more. Line 115 is Cradock's line 486. In the subsequent acts there were no numbered lines in the manuscript. End of the 1st Act Act 2nd Scene 1st Socrates How beauteous springs the morn! yon golden beams, That burst all glorious from the rising sun, To glad approaching day, and cheer mankind In their repeated toils, but late were hid Beneath night's dreary mantle, and black darkness Shaded a sleepy world: and yet that sun Rose yesterday as bright, and will tomorrow. —Say, is not this to die and rise again Each even and morn? for death itself's no more Than the dark instant that removes the soul From this world to a better, when she rises More free, more active, to etherial life; In this superiour to yon blazing orb, That, when she once hath risen, she sets no more. This to a listless, an ungrateful world I long have taught aloud, and pointed forth The way to solid wisdom. By that pow'r Inspir'd, who long with unremitted goodness Hath on my anxious, my enquiring mind Beam'd heavenly knowledge,—such as ancient sages In vain essay'd to learn,—have I to man Laid ope the hidden stores of true philosophy, And shew'd her plain and naked to the eye. For this what worthy recompence is mine? E'en taunt and despite: Man that will not know. —His real good, insulting, thus repays For him my gen'rous cares; nay more; grown tir'd With being freely told ungrateful truths, They scheme against me; 'gainst a weak old man, Emaciated with toil, with pain, with indigence, They level all th'artillery of their malice. They work my ruin, merely 'cause I love them, And labour for their welfare in Hereafter. But be it so; be this their kind return; Persist, my soul, in thy benevolence; Be firm in doing good—Beneath thy thought Are life's vain scenes, and death to thee but opens A brighter prospect, rich with endless life, With rich happiness! Not to be told, Not to be thought, while thou art confin'd below! Scene 2nd Socrates, Plato, Crito, Phedon Socrates What gloom is this, my worthy youths, that sits So heavy on the visage? You're no more Lightsome and gay, as when you us'd to crowd Around your old philosopher, to hear The smooth and easy dictates he unfolded. You seem distrest, as if some sudden evil, Some unexpected blow, had stunn'd your souls, And wretchedness and you were grown familiar. Plato Alass! we're now no strangers to each other. Ah! Socrates, canst thou demand the cause Why all thy friends have lost their wonted glee, Why they look sunk in thought, in deep anxiety, When thou, who long hast been their heart's best solace Their dear-lov'd object of esteem and reverence, Stands't tott'ring on the precipice of fate, The horrid precipice, nor seem'st to hear The gulph that roars beneath thee? Socrates Pho! my friends; This all your cause? I am not worth your sorrows. Too long already have I toil'd, deprest By this dull clayey covering, this incumbrance, That keeps me downward; while my soul aspires To something higher, something that she whispers As far exceeds what we call bliss below, As man himself excells the vilest worm, That groveling crawls the earth. Then why for me This needless anguish? Wou'd you please your Socrates, Be cheerful still, be gay, as you were wont, And listen, blithe, to those important truths, I'll never cease to speak, while life informs This old and tottering fabrick. Crito Chearful, say'st thou? O Socrates, in vain wou'st thou instruct us To bear serene the perils, that we fear. While thus our big-swol[le]n hearts bleed inly for thee, Too piercing is the anguish that we feel, E'en to be sooth'd by thee. Phedon We mourn, we mourn For thee our dear-lov'd friend, our blest instructor, And therefore are we come once more to move thee, To yield awhile to this thy pressing danger. Well do we know the firmness of thy soul; Dauntless she views the rancour of her foes, And smiles at all the efforts of their fury. But oh! forgive us, if we urge thy flight; Evade at present what will else destroy thee: The citizens will yet return to reason, Soon will they wonder at their own mad folly, And blush to think they e'er could hurt their Socrates. Plato Then to thy wishing friends mayst thou return, With glory soon; again from thee they'll hear The words of wisdom, nay, the words of life; For what is life without that heavenly guide, To lead us onward to eternal day? Consider; Oh! reflect, if thou art lost, We lose the hand that guides us, and again Sink in that rayless state, wherein the world Long time had grop'd in vain, till heaven sent thee To drive the darkness, and illume our hearts. Socrates What means my Plato? how! must Socrates Fly from his country like some villain—traytor, Who bears within him all the guilt, for which He fears the just resentment of his citizens? Is life so very valuable, that he Must give the lie to what himself had taught, Poorly resign his yet-unsullied fame, And bid farewel to all his peace of mind, Meanly to save it? Never, friends, o never, Shall your Preceptor thus condemn his Doctrines. Plato Sure when a desperate enemy resolves To ruin worth, any by fallacious arts Betray that virtue which he hates to death; The guiltless sufferer can fear, no stain Will soil his honest praise, if he awhile Leaves his ungrateful country, and retires, Till she at length recovers from her madness, With tears calls back her dear, her injur'd patriot, With open arms receives him to her bosome, Owns her offence, and begs him to forgive her. Socrates The man, that flies the justice of his country, Must have some inward reason for his conduct; He wou'd not fly but that his conscious mind Urges his flight;—he knows too well he's guilty, And therefore he escapes; I know my innocence, And therefore am resolv'd to stand my trial. O friends, conceive the transport I must feel To hear my foes with all their busy malice Rack their poor thought to find one single circumstance, Whereon to ground their cruel accusation. How shall I smile, to hear the twist and torture Each harmless word, and each indifferent action, To mould them to their purpose, but in vain. Plato Alass! Thou wilt not see the fearful danger: The people, when a noisy Orator Pleads 'gainst exalted merit, quick enflam'd By his insidious, his bewitching eloquence, Lose all destinction soon 'twixt right and wrong, And madly vote to death the man they love, The man by whom they live, by whom they're free. Phedon Hast thou forgot, how those unhappy chiefs, Who fought victorious at the Arginuse, At the naval battle of Arginusae off Lesbos (406 B.C.), the Athenian fleet decisively defeated the Spartans, but the victors were unable to rescue the crews of some of their sinking ships. For this the Athenians arrested, tried, and executed six of their admirals. And dyed the azure main with Spartan blood, The blood of enemies that struck at Athens, Fell victims to an inflam'd populace? What was their crime? fatal necessity. The winds, the waves, the very gods oppos'd them; Yet still they suffer'd; nor their own high merit, Nor even thou, tho' nobly didst thou plead In their defense, cou'dst save them from their fate, Socrates' defense of the six accused admirals may be found in Plato, Apology 32b-32c, and Xenophon, Hellenica 1.7. Crito They perish'd—so wilt thou—remember yet; Thy Alcibiades Rather than face trial for impiety due to the multilation of the Hermae, Alcibiades fled in 415 B.C. to Sparta. See Act 1, Scene 2, note 4. His advice to the Spartans in the Peloponnesian War contributed significantly to their eventual victory over Athens. Alcibiades, an open traitor condemned to death by Athens and cursed for sacrilege, was a supposed pupil of Socrates. This association was a critical factor in public opinion relative to Socrates' alleged corruption of the youth of the city. cou'd boast a soul Equal to ev'ry danger; yet he thought It well befitted his high fortitude To avoid his partial trial, when he knew His judges were his foes, and stood determin'd To satiate their resentment with his blood. Socrates In vain are these examples urg'd—I still Will front the danger, be it e'er so dreadful. But why do I say, danger? Life to me Long time hath worn indifference. Even now Death hath not one poor terror to appall me: And, if such base injustice sways my country, Meanly to yield to my causeless foes, Tho' well ascertain'd of my innocence; I'll meet this death, this bug-bear to mankind E'en as a courteous friend that kindly takes me From a base world, which knows not how to value A patriot-citizen, devoid of guile, Who only sought the welfare of his country. Plato Yet let Xantippe, let your children plead; Yet live for them—your little innocents Deserve your life, as long as heaven will grant it. Tis sure not like a father, thus to waste it, When their young tender years demand support From thy directing hand—O think, think of them, Think, what they lose, when they're bereav'd of thee. Socrates Xantippe and my children share my heart: Forbid it, heaven, that shou'd want for them, That strong affection, which our common mother Enforces to the meanest of her offspring! Yet still there is a more coercive law, Which the mind will obey; and, when that tells me To stay and face the malice of my foes; I think, I'm well absolv'd, if to that pow'r, Who ever guards the orphan and the widow I leave them, with a firm and holy confidence, That he will be to them a friend, a father. Scene 3d Socrates, Xantippe, Plato, Phedon, Crito Socrates Thy looks are wild, Xantippe, and thou tremblest— Xantippe Ah! Socrates, have I not cause to tremble, When thy inveterate enemies combine To take thee from me, and will sure succeed, Merely 'cause thou art wanting to thyself; When thou goest on in thy old beaten track, Like one forsaken by the gods he scorns, To teach those doctrines whence they form thy ruin, And art indifferent to what ill betides Thy little ones or me. Socrates You wrong me much, To think youself or them to me indifferent. I bear about me all the tender passions, That throb the husband's and the parent's breast; And wou'd be all an honest man can be For your support. But tell me, wou'dst thou have me, Now, that I'm tott'ring on the on the verge of fate, And death by natural means must very soon Divorce me from thee, meanly save a life; That can't be long of much emoulment To them or thee? I never can, Xantippe— Haply my enemies may not succeed, And Athens have that great regard to justice, Not to condemn an innocent old man, Only because the wicked rage against him. But if it is resolv'd that I must fall, For thy dear sake, and for my children's sake, I will not, must not finish with dishonour A life, as yet unstain'd with guilt or baseness; I must not meanly fly, but dare the danger, And bravely suffer, as a good man ought. Xantippe Ridiculous! But such hath ever been Thy life's wild conduct. Vainly dost thou boast Thy wise philosophy, if this th'event, Thou'lt suffer, how?—like a delirious fool, Who in a fever's rage eludes his keepers And plunges in the flood—the same thy madness; Drunk with thy idle sistems, wild with notions Of what thou can'st not know, thou hast brav'd our gods, Derided our religion; warp'd our youth, And made thyself obnoxious to the state; And yet thou calmly talk'st of innocence! They'll not condemn an innocent old man; I'll bravely suffer, as a good man ought. Stuff! stuff! mere stuff!—ah! Socrates, thou say'st Thou art old; thou art so; for thou doatest Socrates; And all thou say'st, is folly, mere, rank folly. Socrates Have patience, my Xantippe Xantippe Patience? preach it To thy kind friends, to Melitus and Lycon; They'll listen most attentive; yes; they'll hear thee With most observant reverence—preach to them— They'll be thy Platos, Phedons, Critos—all Their passions will be sooth'd no doubt to peace, When thou preach patience to them; they'll no more Plot 'gainst a poor and innocent old man; They will admire thy virtue and thy wisdom; Thy wondrous virtue, that can leave thy wife— Thy children—in the most severe distress— Thy wisdom, that can bid thee not t' evade The ills that threat thee—Heavens! can this be wisdom! Can this be virtue?—Curse such hair-brain'd maxims— And yet I wou'd preserve thee—I shall rave— Say, wilt thou save thyself? Socrates As how? Xantippe Why fly, Fly till the storm is over. Socrates No, Xantippe, I cannot fly— Xantippe Thou can'st not? Driveling wretch! The gods are even with thee for thy madness; They will repay thee for thy wild contempt; They now laugh at thee; for their high abodes They dart their vengeance, and thou diest their victim; Infatuated fool! thou diest their victim. O I cou'd tear myself to atoms—Thus To see thee—Heavens? my brain—Curse on—O Socrates! —Dull stupid wretch! Thou art not worth my tears. Scene 4th Socrates, Plato, Phedon, Crito Socrates Strong is the virulence of female passion; Poor woman! how her boistrous temper sways her! And yet she loves me with sincere affection 'Mid all this tirant-madness that deforms her— But tis beneath philosophy, to heed A woman's idle rage. Plato O Socrates Greatly she's worthy of your kind regard; Her soul's bewilder'd in the killing fears Of your approaching danger; and she knows not, By nature violent, in her distress To moderate her anguish. Socrates Therefore be she No more the subject of our thoughts at present: For you, for her, and for the tender pledges Of our most holy loves, I will do all, I will bear all the humane heart can bear. But there's one rule I must constant follow; The rule my soul imposes on herself: I have already said, I can't transgress it. Great are the transport of an honest conscience, E'en in the severest trials! he that knows That he means well; and by that inward law Hath modell'd all his actions, stands secure, Tho' all around is waste and desolation. Tis this compels me to my present conduct: Think not, tis vanity directs my heart; I know too well our nature, to be vain. I will be Socrates, will be the man I've ever taught mankind; and if my foes Prevail, and I'm unjustly doom'd to suffer, I'll die as I have liv'd,—I will die Socrates. Scene 5th Apame, Melitus Apame At length I've found you, Brother; long you've shunn'd me, As if Apame's presence were unwelcome; The cause yourself best knows; but sure you need not Fear the reproaches of a simple sister. Melitus I own, I fled your presence for a while, 'Cause well I know your high attachment to The man your brother hates—I blame you not— Phedon's pathetick eloquence hath power— But therefore I declin'd a conversation, Guessing the mighty purport of your errand. Apame An errand, Melitus, that much concerns you: For know, your malice 'gainst the godlike Socrates, Rebounds upon yourself—You may succeed; But sure, unhappy youth, you only work Your own perdition; your insidious wiles Will in the end ensnare you in a ruin I dread to think of. Melitus Then e'en spare thy terrors For me, dear sister, I despise that ruin, But say, what ruin? Brave, don't I defend Our country-gods, whom this vain man insults? Will they desert me, when in their own honour I firmly dare? When I assert their godhead, And strive to save their temples from contempt? No sister; they're themselves too much concern'd T'expose the man, who fights their cause, to ruin. Apame Ah! brother; vainly dost thou urge a plea; Which can't convince one single soul that knows thee. The worship of the gods affect thee little. Long might they mourn their want of votaries, Their shrines neglected, their forsaken altars, Did not thy own resentment trail thee in To their assistance.—Socrate's friendship His gen'rous candour, and his honest zeal To wean thee from thy idle, fond amusements The stupid figments of a poet's brain, Words without meaning; and to lure thee thence To solid studies, such as wou'd inform thee In life's importance, and advance thy soul To real pleasures—this his love for thee Hath rais'd thy spleen, and drives thee to repay him With such ingratitude as wants a name. Therefore thou join'st the villain Anytus, And ideot Lycon; one, a half-learn'd fool Fraught with his empty self; the other, Heavens! A wretch the meanest, guiltiest, most abandon'd Of all that plagues our Athens—worthy fellowship! Melitus Well sister, hast thou learn'd thy sexes talent; Thou bandiest purely; but pray I stope Apparently Cradock refers to the fable that Melitus was put to death by remorseful Athenians who erected a statue in Socrate's honor. Taylor, Socrates, p. 118. no more; My friends will laugh at all thy woman's railing; Nor think thy modest appellations worth A wise man's notice—still, if thou art prudent, Thou wilt forbear, and not provoke me farther— I may perhaps forget I am thy brother. Apame These threats to me, dear Melitus, are idle; I have, as well becomes me, all the love, Nay, all the reverence, you can claim as brother. Yet sure there's something due unto a sister, The rather, when her tenderness alarms her, And she forbodes some very sad event From her dear brother's conduct. If he's angry Merely because she fears he may regret The steps he's blindly following, she will pity him, But smiles—contemptuous at his empty threats. Melitus Well; my pert sister, I'll for once be calm, And hear the wondrous lesson thou wou'dst teach me, Tho' much compliance sits but awkward on me. Apame Away with this derision! More important Is the sad subject of our present converse. You're tempting your own fate; and, like the bestial, That heedless roves the flow'ry plain along, That feeds securely on the verdant herbage, Nor views the dreadful precipice before him, Till suddenly he tumbles down it's height; Gaily you rush into your own destruction. The cruel prosecution you intend 'Gainst Socrates, whatever flattering dream Deludes you on, will have most woeful issue. Say, you succeed—oft-times the gods permit A good man's fall, for wise and secret ends, Which puzzle man with all his boasted wisdom. But be assur'd the wretched instruments Of these their sacred counsels are by them Devoted to inevitable ruin. Melitus Full learnedly, Apame, hast thou pleaded; I fancy Phedon understands his business; He tutors well; and, I will do thee justice,— His charming pupil hath a coming genius. Apame Twice you've unkindly mention'd Phedon to me; O Melitus, wou'd you but act like him, Your sister's aching heart wou'd be at peace; The horrid image that now strikes her soul With fearful horrors, strait wou'd disappear, And leave her calm and easy. Melitus What Enigma Is this that thou wou'dst fain unravel to me? Apame It is my brother's pale and haggard carcase, Drag'd by a ruthless mob along the street, Spurn'd and insulted by each scoundrel citizen, That now applauds thee; nay, while yet thou liv'st, Me thinks e'en now I see thee scorn'd and loath'd; Not one will speak to thee; they shun thee, like The most abhor'd production of wild nature; And thou at length will thank the executioner For the kind blow that rids thee of thy being. Say, can thy sister think this without horror? And yet her fancy paints it to her view In colours still more hideous. Melitus Well sayst thou Thy fancy forms this to thee.—Pray, Apame, No more of these imaginary terrors. I stand resolv'd; and, were th'event to prove As thy sick mind hath imag'd, such strong hate My soul Note how Melitus has adopted the Socratic notion of a soul. See also Anytus's comments, scene 7, line 9. resentful bears thy idol, Socrates, That I wou'd dare the horrors thou hast painted. Away!—I'll hear no more thy wild surmises— Why, thou hast rais'd such phantoms, as e'en shock My firmest powers—Be gone, or I shall something That—prithee, leave me. Apame Yes, I will be gone; Unhappy Melitus, thou bidst me leave thee; And oh! forgive a sister's pious prayer, May the tumultuous passion, which now writches thee, End in a fair resolve to quit thy purpose, And free Apame from her killing fears. Scene the 6th Melitus Gods! how she hath unman'd me! She has drawn A shocking pourtrait—say, shou'd it prove real? Why, be it so;—the man, that dares a guilt, Must have a soul like mine, which braves the gods To thwart it's purpose.—Socrates, I hate thee; And thou shalt pay me ample retribution. My friends?—I thank them; they are come in time, To firm me 'gainst the horrors she hath rais'd. Scene the 7th Melitus, Anytus, Lycon Melitus I've had a glorious lecture from my sister, Why; the girl's grown a mere philosopher; And mouths her maxims, out as well as Socrates; Had not my soul been iron-proof against her, I shou'd have faulter'd— Anytus Sure the noble Melitus Will laugh at a weak woman's idle reasonings. The sex will oft assume a fancied power, And rate it shrewdly; but they're tinsel arguers; The man, whose soul is constant to herself, Carries with ease the pretty things they say. Melitus Nay; had she spoke with sevenfold eloquence, With all the energy of Hermes, Hermes or Mercury was the Greek messenger god and the patron of eloquence. still Her eloquence were fruitless—I am determin'd, Nor all the powers of heav'n or hell can move me. Can shake my soul, or alter her resolve. A fane is a temple. Lycon Spoke like my friend, and now we soon shall see How this sage reasoner, this intrepid Socrates, This mighty man of wisdom will behave, Aw'd by the solemn presence of a court, And all his baleful schemes produc'd against him. Tis well, if his philosophy supports him: He'll then appear like other common mortals, Sunk in his fears, and cover'd with confusion. Anytus No; Lycon, no; his philosophick pride Will bear him up against us; we shall see him E'en smile contempt upon us: 'Twere unworthy Of the wise Socrates to hint a fear. Therefore he'll summon all his hoard of maxims, All he hath gather'd from a long experience, To arm his haughty stubborn soul against us: For tis the boast of madmen, like himself, Not to confess their frenzy, but stand out E'en Against the strongest Evidence. Melitus We'll prove him; We'll work up all his patience; I'm deceiv'd, Or we shall make him totter on the basis Of his assum'd Integrity—Be it Firm and immoveable, as he pretends, We'll undermine, till like a tumbling tower It falls at length in hideous ruins on him, And crushes him to atoms. Anytus Twill be so; He ne'er can stand th'assault—he falls—he dies. And then, my friends, our souls will be at ease; Our virtues too our own without a monitor; Our youth will tread the good old path Of their forefathers; Heaven will have it's votaries; Our sacred fanes, A fane is a temple. as usual, will be throng'd With hallow'd victims; Athens rise anew In wonted glory; horrid war forbear To fright her matrons and her tender maids; O'er distant realms supreme once more she'll reign, And hold her envied empire o'er the main. End of the second Act Act 3d Scene 1st Phedon, Apame Phedon This day, this solemn day, my dear Apame, Will stand recorded in Athenian Annals, As the most black and dismal: Not the period, When Heav'n sent forth the raging pestilence, When the dank air we breath'd was big with death, And Athens shew'd a heap of carcases, Will wear a gloomier aspect to posterity. Our after-race must blush to read, their fathers Brought to an infamous, a cruel trial The man, whose virtues made their state renown'd Bove all the Grecian Cities; heav'n, they'll cry, Had let the Furies loose, and given them leave To dart their venom in each Attick Attica was the region in Greece where Athens was located. breast. O Athens! O my country! how my soul Indignant glows, that she within thy walls First view'd yon glorious sun! Apame Thou art happy, Phedon, Thou hast been a steady friend to Socrates: Hast shewn a soul well worthy his instructions, Nor will desert him in the day of evil; Thou hast no brother, whose prepost'rous hate, Whose perverse enmity, to worth, to virtue, Can give thy heart a pang.—Too wretched I! Long as I've lov'd that venerable sage, And almost reverenc'd him as a divinity, When I reflect, the man that calls me sister, That drew his first, his infant-nourishment From the same honour'd breast, resolves his ruin, And joins with impious men against his life; How I am struck with horror at the thought? How I am lost in my excess of misery? Phedon Strange! that a man who in the spring of life Promis'd a glorious harvest of brave actions, Shou'd thus run counter to his fair beginnings, And hate that virtue, which he once rever'd! We then were friends; at least I call'd him mine, And with delight I saw him close attend The virtuous Socrates, and catch each sentiment— As it came from him—How alass! he's chang'd! Sure some malignant Planet sways his conduct, And drives him head long on the guilty course, He now with such determin'd will pursues. Apame Oh! he is lost, my Phedon, he is lost; The gods have destin'd him to be the dupe Of his remorseless folly;—Late I saw him, And strove to win him from his dread design; In vain—his fury rose—his form look'd madness— Wild were his eyes—his voice grew loud and rageful, And he in heighth of passion drove me from him. Phedon How I am mov'd at thy too just complainings? O my Apame, Life is fraught with misery; Few are our joys and many are our woes. For me, had they denied me thy dear love, If thou hadst not with kind compassion heard me, Heard my fond suit, and bad me hope, that time Might ballance all my miseries with thee, Sure I shou'd sink beneath the pondrous load. Apame Ah! Phedon, cease t'indulge this weakness farther; T'will but delude thee—Heaven forbids our loves— Far from each other we must fly for ever; Must bid adieu to ev'ry fond desire, Each tender thought that knit our souls together; I can't be thine—I must not—Nature, virtue, The ties of blood, the rigid laws of honour, Severly bar me from thee. Phedon Aweful powers! What do I hear? Apame now forbid me T'indulge my faithful love!—It must not be! O thou art all to me the Gods can grant, And, if I lose thee, Heaven hath not beneath it A wretch more lost in misery than Phedon. Apame Phedon, be calm; to thy impartial reason Will I appeal, and she'll I'm sure, acquit me. My brother is the foe of Socrates, Th'inveterate foe, and e'en to death pursues him. However guilty, he is still my brother, A Brother too, for all his wayward conduct Something within commands me still to reverence. Say, can I marry then the youth, whose friendship For that illustrious, that much injur'd sage, Must make him look on Melitus with hatred, As on the base destroyer of his friend? How wou'd it suit with thy Apame's virtue, With that chaste fame she values far above All that mistaken man calls great and splendid, To lose herself in softnesses of love, So to be led away by her fond folly, As to forget that great, that innate law Nature makes indispensable, forget My brother is my brother, thou his enemy? No Phedon, never can Apame's soul Bear the reflection of so wild a conduct. Phedon Good heavens! Where am I? Are they all a dream, These golden hopes, that have thus long entranc'd me? To all the dreaded woes, that now alarm me, Must this be added yet?—Apame lost! Apame never mine!—Assist me, fair one, Say something to relieve thy sinking Phedon, Or, like the bark, that on the stormy surge Hath long been tost, the sport of raging winds, And sinks at length deep down to the opening gulph. I fall victim to my love and thee. Apame Alass! what can I say to ease thy anguish? That I have lov'd thee—witness, ye chaste Stars, Witness, ye holy powers, that know our hearts, And search the inmost passions lurking there; Long have I lov'd thee, and to death will bear The virtuous flame—but oh! Apame can No more— Phedon How I am lost in many sorrows? Thou lov'st me, my Apame! What avails This fond confession, if I still must live Unblest without thee, and must languish out A tedious, hated life in dread despair? Apame Learn, Phedon, to support the awards of Heaven With noble fortitude, with true philosophy; And copy with more firmness thy great master. He sets a glorious pattern—act like him. This is unmanly whining—if he falls, All I can promise, since I can't be thine, Is, ne'er to be another's—if he lives, (But oh! my heart forebodes, the god's decree, That he must fall, and by my brother's means) Yet, if he lives, and Melitus at length Sees and laments his present wayward conduct, I'll only say, that life without my Phedon Will be a burden heavier to my soul, Than to the chained slave, that tugs the oar, And hourly dies beneath a tirant-lord. Phedon Too slender solace for my bleeding heart! And yet I thank thee—yes; thy Phedon thanks thee. O may high Heaven with piteous eye look down On our transcendant loves!—But I'm all fear— My trembling heart—forgive me, my Apame— But when I think what I shall lose in thee, Oh!—I will copy my great Master's firmness, I'll copy thee—Do thou, my virtuous maid, Support me—O I wou'd, wou'd hope, and yet Some envious demon glooms upon my soul, And e'en forbids my hope—O help me, Socrates, Help me, Apame; help me all that virtue, That I've imbib'd from Socrates and thee. Scene 2d Socrates, Plato, Phedon, Crito, and others his friends attending him to his trial Socrates No, Plato; no, my youths; it must not be. Dear is the offer of your friendly hearts, And Socrates will to his dying hour Retain a kind remembrance of your love. For me you shan't expose your precious lives To needless dangers, to the rude resentment Of a licentious people—I'm prepar'd Gainst the worst fury of my mad accusers; And can myself support my character. Good Heaven hath not so left me; I can plead With firmest resolution all my services, My constant, faithful services to Athens, And, if they will condemn me, they shall own, Spite of their malice, that I die unjustly. Plato That the kind powers have blest thy sapient tongue With all the energy of soft persuasion; That virtues like thy own might well reject The feeble aid of our imperfect eloquence; That the severest trials of ill fortune Cannot unnerve thy firm and manly soul, We're well assur'd—But yet forgive thy friends, If they still hope, their faithful cares may prove Of solid service to thee 'gainst their slanders. Mean tho' our powers of speech, we yet may urge Something, that in the hurry of thy thoughts, May slip thy memory, of great import— Socrates Alass! of what emolument to me All you can say? my judges, if they're just, From my own mouth will be convinc'd—However, I'll be my own defender, and assert My innocence of soul with honest freedom: Firm and serene I'll meet the pouring tempest, And smile at all the horrors they wou'd raise. Plato And can thy pupils, they, who've learn'd from thee The road to wisdom, and the paths of peace Whose tender minds thou hast form'd with pious care, And, kind, instructed in each godlike virtue, Silent, can they behold thee stand alone Gainst the united malice of thy enemies, And not reach out their helping hand? Must tears And patient suffering only be their share, And not one word drop from them to defend thee? Much twill alleviate our heart-piercing sorrows, If we're allow'd to plead thy righteous cause, To shew Mankind that not in barren soil Thou hast planted thy own virtues; that we know Our heavy loss in being bereav'd of thee, And will dare all that honour bids, to save thee. Socrates Enough, dear youths; I do believe, you love me, And tis no moderate solace to my soul, That I've not toil'd in vain'; that you deserve My cares and labours.—Greatly it rejoices me, To know, if Heaven determines I shall die, That I shall leave in Athens worthy men, Firm patriots like myself, sincere to friendship, True to their country's interest and to virtue; For such, I'm sure, are you—pursue the track With steady resolution—but you will. For me, you have my thanks; but know, 'twill pain me More than my trial, to involve my friends In the same ruin—Leave me to myself; I shall not be dismay'd; my steady soul Suffices 'gainst the assaults of all their fury, And will repel their slanders—let us on; The venerable court is set, and I Wou'd not delay their more important business For an old man, not worth the mighty pother, Some wild and busy heads have made about him. Scene the 3d The Court of the Areopagus The Areaopagus was the high judicial tribunal of Athens. Cradock also uses the term to mean a member of the court rather than the more normal Areopagite; for example, see the first speaker of this scene. in the open air The orator's desk Melitus, Anitus, Lycon, as accusers of Socrates, with the Athenian populace attending them: After some time enter Socrates, Plato, Crito, Phedon and numbers of the Athenian youth; he gay and cheerful, they under the greatest dejection. Areopagus Give out the business of the day. Crier reads Melitus, son of Melitus of the people of Pythos By people is meant deme or administrative district of Attica. Melitus was from the deme of Pitthus and Socrates from the deme of Alopece. accuses Socrates, son of Sophroniscus of the people of Alopece. Areopagus Read the accusation. Crier Socrates is criminal, because he acknowledges not the gods, that the republick acknowledges; and because he introduces new deities; he is farther criminal, because he corrupts the youth. Areopagus Bid Melitus stand forth. Crier Melitus son of Melitus of the people of Pythos, appear and prove your accusation against Socrates son of Sophroniscus of the people of Alopece. Melitus ascends the Orator's desk and speaks. Much I'm abash'd, most grave and reverend Senators, Thus to appear, unequal as I am, To this important cause, but 'tis the cause Of Heaven and Athens—and the fervent zeal That warms my heart for our immortal gods; That dear regard my native soil demands, Compel me to accuse the great delinquent. I say then, Socrates abjures our gods; He laughs with high contempt as all the honours We pay to their divinity, and stiles them Mere empty nothings, creatures of the brain, The idle dreams of ancient superstition, Grown sacred from the ignorance of our fathers, Grown venerable from a length of years. When was it, Socrates wou'd condescend T'attend their fanes, and pay that holy reverence Which their divine protection of our city Claims from the sons of Athens? He, more wise, More deeply read in nature and her powers, Inspir'd, no doubt, with wisdom from above, Forms to himself a deity unknown, A being sole, and independent of All other beings, o'er the world supreme. To him this God benign communicates The secrets of his will, to him alone Unfolds his counsels; and, to guide his steps To guard him from the frailities of our nature; T'inform his reason, and inspire his soul, Directs a special demon to attend him. This his assertion; vain, presuming man! Thus he divests those ever-gracious deities, By whose propitious aid our Athens long Hath been the pride and wonder of the World, Of all their virtues, attributes and powers. Nor yet content with his own blasphemies, He lures our youth to listen to his doctrines, T'imbibe his vile pernicious fatal errors; He trains them up to sins of horrid kind, To guilt that wants a name, to monstrous mischiefs. Him do they follow wildly 'long the streets, Nor hearken to a parent's kind rebuke, Nor hearken to their country's solemn voice; Nay, e'en religion pleads with them in vain; For Socrates to them is parent, country, Their god, their all; and madly they're prepar'd To act all his commands, however wicked, However fatal to our weal and peace. These, dear Athenians, these ye rev'rend Judges, These are the crimes of this all dearing man. To you, as well becomes me, I shall leave The Award of his demerits; but if ever Pernicious citizen deserv'd to die, If every Athens bore a son ingrate, Who sought clandestine to undo his country, To rob her of her liberties and laws, To innovate her ancient sacred rites, And level all the objects of her worship, The son of Sophroniscus is that traitor. Socrates to his friends Heavens! what a stranger am I to myself? Say, friends, am I this wretch, this impious parricide? If Melitus hath search'd my heart so deeply, And found these dreadful mischiefs lurking there, Sure never man was more unknown to man Than Socrates to Socrates. Melitus To strengthen What I've asserted 'gainst this vile deluder, The worthy Anitus and gen'rous Lycon Men of sincere affection to the state, Faithful and active in their country's interest, Are both prepar'd and willing to support me. Areopagus Let them attend, and speak their thoughts with freedom. Anitus Small is the trouble I shall give the senate; I have not learn'd the niceties of speech, And can but bluntly say what I've to offer. Nay, tis with great reluctance I appear Against the man that once I call'd my friend. But when I see to what irreverent use His talents are applied; when I observe, Against those very gods that gave him all The wondrous faculties he justly boasts, He lavishes their blessings, and does outrage To all that we hold sacred and divine, When the wild listless youth of this great city Run after him, and catch with eager gape Each impious tenet he profanely utters; When Heaven must soon lament it's want of votaries; And the avenging gods, justly incens'd At our neglect of their most holy worship, Will curse this city with severest evils, Will sink us deep in most deserv'd distress, In woes more fatal than we've felt already, Unless we timely hinder the result Of their tremendous anger, I no more Look on the ties of friendship to be binding: And therefore I conjure you, rev'rend Senators, As you are men of Athens, as you're citizens, That have the welfare of the state at heart, To rouse yourselves against these threatening perils, To clear your city of these novel doctrines, T'assert your gods, and most severely punish The man who dares to speak against their power, That dares deny their providence and being, Phedon aside Poor tender Anitus! his righteous conscience Can't bear the least infringement on the rites Of his dear country. Sure his virtuous heart Is clear from ev'ry stain of base injustice. Lycon It is no mean offender, ye Athenians Today demands your cognisance; if ever Presumptious man hath dar'd beyond forgiveness Or of the gods or you, this vain declaimer Against our hallow'd rites, this mighty reasoner In speculative knowledge, this arraigner Of our dread gods is he.—I wou'd be calm, I wou'd be master of myself, my faculties, While I lay forth the insolent attempts Of his insidious heart. But when already We feel the fatal issue of his conduct, When even now our gods dart down their vengeance In fearful bolts of wrath; and Athens mourns Almost in Ashes their severe displeasure, Say, can a citizen, can one that Loves His dear maternal land, command his utterance, And speak with temper?—O reflect, Athenians, Consider coolly the successive evils That long have ravag'd this devoted city; Then say, if all the gods have not conspir'd To pour destruction on us.—Why, my countrymen, Why are we thus the objects of their wrath? Why? 'Cause an old irreverend dotard lures you To horrid guilt—grown desperate in impiety, He charges you with folly in your worship, Deprives high Heav'n of it's undoubted powers, And quite annihilates it's blest inhabitants. Are ye asleep, Athenians? Lo! Your youth, Mad with his baneful dogmas, slight the temples, No more the consecrated victim bleeds; No more the solemn vows are paid;—nay further, He draws them from the duties of relation; In vain with his ungracious son the father, In vain the mother, pleads parental cares. Their children fly their precepts, and return Unnatural ingratitude—Can this, Can this be pleasing to the powers divine? Will Athens flourish, when the holy bond That shou'd subsist between a child and parent, Is thus dissolv'd?—Let our experience teach us. What an abandon'd wretch was Alcibiades? What a remorseless savage tirant, Critias? These left their friends to listen to his lore; These were his pupils; these had long imbib'd His boasted maxims; these were once his favourites, And bore the appellation of his sons. Awake, ye rev'rend Senators; no more Sleep in the dangers that alarm the state; Call forth your courage, let your country rouse you; Be just, be earnest—Heaven and earth conjoin, And claim your verdict 'gainst this dangerous man. He will, I know, endeavour to amuse you; He'll soothe you to forgive him; he'll smooth over His base detested conduct—but beware— He hath a winning, a bewitching eloquence; His words are oil, but oh! there lurks within Poison of killing force; and, if you hear him, If to the magick of his tongue you yield, I can but mourn the ruin of my country, Shall weep, religion, thy deserted altars, Shall wail, dear liberty, thy fall in Athens. Plato aside O eloquence, what a pernicious bane Thy beauties are, when basely they're adapted To screen a villain, or defame the good. Areopagus Who speaks for the defendant? Socrates Even he That best knows how to answer his accurers (Plato attempts to mount the desk) Plato, forbear; thou dost me great injustice To think I want assistance 'gainst a heap Of falsehood so absurd; if Athens boasts An honest senate, I've no cause to fear. E'en their own hearts will plead with them for Socrates, And safely guard him 'gainst such frontless malice. 1 Areopagus Gods! he e'en braves the senate. 2 Areopagus Let him on He'll say enough to make him guilty. Socrates Whence comes it, ye Athenians, that I am charg'd With a denial of our country-Gods? Have I not always worship'd in their temples? Have I not always bow'd before their altars? What festal days hath Athens e'er ordain'd That I have not kept holy? Many are there Can prove my presence, there, and Melitus, Had he so will'd, might have observ'd me too. They say, I introduce new deities: What are they, Senators? inform me, do. I own I'm ignorant, unless to say, The voice of God directs me, is, to assert Some novel deity you have not known. They who divine by thunder, they that mark The notes of birds, the priestess on her tripod, Are they not guided by the voice divine? What difference, tell me? only this, that I, Pious as well as wise, ascribe to Heav'n, What only they ascribe to second causes, to mediate powers, whence they derive their Omens. Alass! no base design, no wicked purpose Hath ever swayed my heart: if heav'n declares That I am wise, I sent not Cherephon See above, act 1, scene 6, line 13. To Delphos to enquire; and yet the God Pronounc'd me more than wise,—both just and free. But why am I not so? No slave to sense, Above temptation, faithful to my poverty, Still searching after knowledge, teaching others What have I learn'd myself; Is this not wisdom, Is this not justice, freedom, all that's right, All that is grateful in the eyes of men, Nay, I'll go farther, in the eye of Heaven? Thus many of our citizens have thought, Thus all the virtuous in the states of Greece To me they've travell'd; and from me, well-pleas'd, Imbib'd the maxims of philosophy. But I corrupt your youth;—What youth corrupted? Name even one, who with a mind sincere Ador'd the gods, that I have made an infidel; Name one remark'd for chaste and modest bearing, That I have render'd impudent and leud; Name any sober, frugal, hardy, brave, That have become debauch'd, or profligate, Or coward, or effeminate, from pursuing The rigid path I've pointed to their steps. Melitus Many there are, unthinking, heedless youth, Who, tho' regardless of a parent's will, Bear most submissive reverence to thee, And pay thee the submission that they owe To them alone or Heaven. Socrates They have obey'd me In following virtue; I was their preceptor; Their parents knew not how to teach them wisdom, And therefore they applied themselves to me. Who heeds relation in a dangerous fever? Is it their parent's counsel that they take Or the Physician's? In the trade of war, The general's skill, and not his friends are weigh'd. Instruction is my province; therefore justly Submissive reverence from them is my due. Is this a cause, why I shou'd suffer death? Is this so dread an evil to the state, That nothing but my life can recompence The mischiefs I have done?—Speak, Anitus; Speak, Lycon, Melitus—but, O my judges, Let them succeed; they hurt not Socrates Death bears to me no terrors.—who can say, Whether he is an happiness or evil? But he that dreads him, for that very reason Can not be wise—however he may palliate His servile fears—his soul's estrang'd from wisdom. The Areopagus consult for some time, and by their Suffrages bring him in guilty. Areopagus The justice of the senate, Socrates. Hath found thee guilty; and thy punishment By law is death—However, if thou'lt Pay the fine awarded, thou'rt allow'd to live. Socrates A fine? for what Athenians? I a fine? Yours is uncommon justice—Innocence Hath ever sway'd my conduct; and no guilt Cleaves to my soul; and she shall ne'er upbraid me, That, dastard-like, I'd meanly save a life I ever held indifferent at the forfeit Of what I hold most dear, my fame and virtue. Plato O Socrates, have pity on your friends, Your relatives, your country—curb a little This grandeur of thy soul; impartial men Will ne'er conceive thee guilty, and thy life May yet be long a blessing to the world. Socrates No, Plato; were the wealth of Athens mine, I wou'd not buy my life so basely from them. But since they're in suspence, myself will rate My services—be this my punishment. As I've been ever faithful to my country: Have frelly shed my blood in her defence, And sav'd her noblest citizens from death, Have taught her yout the road to solid glory, To real virtue, and immortal happiness, The publick shall maintain me, while I live, A cheap reward for what I've done for them. The Areopagus shew marks of high resentment, and after some consultation give the final sentence. Areopagus Thy haughty soul, thou son of Sophroniscus, Compels us to condemn thee; therefore be it As thy high crimes deserve—the poison'd bowl Thy portion;—when arrives the sacred ship From Delos' hallow'd Isle, that day's they last. Be on thyself thy blood—dismiss the court. Scene 4th Socrates and his friends returning from the trial. Guards attending. Socrates Tis then determin'd, and I die, Athenians; Why then I leave a base ungrateful world, And hie me to those calm, those blessed regions Where misery is no more, and all is peace. Forbear, my friends; these unavailing tears Betray unmanly weakness; tis beneath Philosophy, to weep and grieve like women. Compose your hearts; and bear my loss with firmness, Like men that have not learn'd in vain my lessons. Crito O Socrates, th'injustice of thy country! That thou so wise, so good, so innocent, Shou'dst thus be sacrific'd? Socrates What means my Crito? Tis better thus, than die an abject wretch, Condemn'd by by own heart, my friend's disgrace. My foes may take my life, but can't deprive me Of what is more than life and all it's joys, Unsullied innocence and firm integrity; They are above their reach, above their malice; Therefore they hurt not me—Cheer up, my youths— Come, lead me to the prison—I can die. The man who walks the path of life sincere, Nor deviates from the truth, disdains to fear: Tho' Death each horrid, ghastly form assume, My hopes are fixed on better world to come: Long, long ago the arduous task I learn'd And view his fancied terrors unconcern'd. End of the third act Act 4th Scene 1st Xantippe, Plato Xantippe Ye gods! what hath Xantippe done, to feel This deep excess of misery?—Life! What art thou? —A Curse—at least I've found thee so—the brute, That knows no care but happily enjoys The present hour, boasts nobler bliss than man. He roves along the fields in joyous plight, Selects his food, drinks free the christal stream, And to the moment of his fate is happy. But we, that vaunt ourselves superior beings, That proudly talk of reason and her powers, What bliss have we? incessant fears alarm us; Incessant ills o'ertake us; and our joys So thinly scatter'd, that they fleet unfelt, Like empty bubbles on a watry mirror. Plato This springs from Heaven's peculiar love to man; Too well he knows, how fond our hearts wou'd grow Of mundane bliss; and therefore wisely mixes The cup of life with gall. Sublimer joys, Than what this life can furnish, he intends In future, brighter Worlds; but, if our souls Met here the full completion of their wishes, They'd grow unfit for more exalted pleasures, And cling to earth as to their only stay. Xantippe These are the idle rants of Socrates, And he hath madden'd thee with his delusions. Whence springs this knowledge or to him or thee? Or why to you alone is given to know The after-state of men? Tis all mere Rhapsody, And he, inebriated with his whimsies, Hath quite cast off all thought of what I feel, Of what his harmless, helpless children feel, Knows not the anguish of parental tenderness, Forgets the love he owes to his Xantippe, And wraps himself in his ideal prospects Of something, but of what he does not know: While I, distracted with my sore distress, Rave to the Gods in fruitless exclamation, And have no glympse of hope t'allay my sorrows. Plato Yet may'st thou hope, that that Omniscient Power, Whose will he hath ever sought, and taught to others, Tho' in his boundless wisdom he ordain, That Socrates must fall, may yet to you And to your little ones extend his mercy. He may have glorious reasons for his sufferings, Beyond our ken; and wou'd exhibit forth His chosen favourite, as a blest example To shew to others, how the man of virtue, The man of wisdom, like to his shou'd act. You therefore he'll forsake not in affliction, But still will raise you friends, to heal your griefs, To aid your wants, and drive away despair. Xantippe Alass! thou talkest wildly, Plato; How! Must Socrates, who boasts that he hath serv'd This unknown Deity with strict sincerity, Be given a victim up unto his foes, And feel the vengeance of their villain-malice; Yet I, who never had a thought about him, But worshipped merely as our father worshipp'd, Regardless how, or whom, I must forsooth! Be the peculiar object of his favour? Gods! this is worse that womanish reasoning, And shews us, how absurdly man will argue, When he pretends to fathom what he knows not. Plato 'Twere vain, Xantippe, now to plead submission To Heaven's high will, to bid thee arm with patience, Thy soul, too much opprest with sore calamity. But sure afflictions are not always evils, And Socrates, me thinks, in future times Will shine the brighter from his noble conduct Under the pressure of his present woes. Like yon gay sun that glads the world with day; Sometimes a black invidious cloud conceals him, When he emerging with redoubled vigour, Darts all his beams with more resplendent glory. Xantippe No more of this—to me he's ever lost— By Socrates, thou'rt gone—thou diest, my Socrates; But a few hours, and death's unpitying hand Gives the dread final stroke—O hear me, Heaven! Hear a lorn widow's prayer—shower down, shower down Thy deadliest curses on those villain-wretches, That have bereav'd me of my Socrates: O let them feel the pangs I suffer now; Heap all thy vengeance on them, till they groan In deepest anguish, till they're curs'd like me. Plato Restrain, thou consort of my god-like friend, This mad disorder; yet, if thou'lt be calm, And bear submissive what the Gods ordain, Yet may some unexpected change disperse Thy present woes, and thou again be happy. Xantippe Happy? I happy? No; I've long shook hands With happiness; tis writ in heaven, that I Must be the most unhappy of my kind. O I am all affliction—Socrates! Thou hast brought this misery on me—I forgive thee, Yet hadst thou listen'd to me, hadst thou yielded To my persuasions—but tis vain t'upbraid thee Thou art lost, and I am—O support me, Heav'n! Scene 2d Plato Her killing griefs have so possest her soul, That 'twere a needless task to speak to her. I wou'd have told her of our friendly scheme— To free her Socrates; but, shou'd it fail, Shou'd he himself (as much I fear) obstruct The honest mean we've taken to preserve him, And, obstinate, resolve to die, her grief Wou'd have return'd with double weight upon her, And sunk her soul to utter desolation. But why delay my friends? tis now the hour They promis'd here to meet me with the gaoler. If he is firm, and Socrates will hear us, He'll yet escape, and triumph o'er the malice Of his invet'rate foes—grant Heaven, he may! Scene 3d Plato, Phedon, Crito, Apame, Gaoler Plato Welcome, my mournful friends; tis then resolv'd And you're unanimous t'attempt his rescue? Phedon Unanimous? Who wou'd not dare their fate, To save the man who e'en the gods behold, With rapturous wonder, from so base a death? Crito Yes, Plato, we're resolv'd; and Heaven in pity To Athens, to relieve her from her shame, Inspires this generous man to aid our purpose. He blushes for his country, and determines To share with us, the brave attempt, or die. Gaoler Who, that beholds his great, his god like patience, His nobleness of suffering, but wou'd join With earnest resolution, to preserve him? I am a stranger to philosophy, Nor know her influence on the sons of men; But this man's more than humane; his demeanour Hath in it something of divinity. Calm and serene he smiles at my compassion, And bids me not to be concern'd for him; That life and death he hath weigh'd in equal ballance, And finds himself indifferent to either. Oft, when I speak th'inveteracy of those That work'd his cruel sufferings, strait he pities them, And begs of Heaven that they may be forgiven. I heard him with amaze; he won my soul; And O, were I the humble mean to save him, Methinks I cou'd forgive the gods, shou'd they Ordain my death the moment he escap'd. Plato Thy honest heart! But doubt not but the gods Will shower their blessings on thee. Thy regard For virtue in affliction, claims their goodness, And they will pay thee worthy recompence. Why, my good friends, this looks as if the Powers Above took care of him—let's seize th'occasion, Spite of himself preserve him, and become Th'asserters of exalted worth in Athens. Apame Yes, ye Athenians, dare the utmost perils, Bid brave defiance to severest tortures, Rather than he shou'd fall; the world hath not In it's extended regions one that mates With him in virtue. Hapless that I am, To have my nearest relative his foe, I'd dare for him above my feeble sex. Plato O sweet Apame, worthiest, matchless maid! How shall I praise thee, as thy worth deserves? Thy dear esteem for Socrates demands Our highest gratitude, and makes us almost Forget, thy cruel brother sought his death. O thou transcendant excellence! had he But half thy virtue—O forgive the thought! I see how it transports thy gentle soul. Phedon Gods! how she's mov'd! O Plato, thou hast rais'd Tumultuous war within her—heavenly fair One, Summon thy own great virtues to thy aid, Calm thy afflicted soul—thy Phedon asks thee Speak solace to thyself—support the conflict— What can I say to ease thy strugling heart? Apame O the severe distress that hangs upon me! You're all the friends of Socrates—be mine. Ye know, how I revere him, how I love him; And oh! if ye succeed (and grant, ye Gods, They may succeed) have pity on Apame, And give her back, if possible, her brother. Scene 4th Plato, Phedon, Crito, Gaoler Plato Her soul is deeply wounded—may the gods Prosper our righteous scheme, and give her peace. Crito We must succeed; he cannot long withstand Our earnest prayers and tears; do you, my friends Be ready to admit us; when escap'd From out the loathsome prison, I'll convey him, Ere dawn beams forth, beyond the reach of malice. A gen'rous band of youths, who mourn his fate, Await our coming at the gate, that leads To Thebes; They'll there receive the sage with transport, And safe conduct him to the destin'd place Of his concealment. Gaoler Hence an hour exact, The prison-doors are open—you be there, And I'll attend you to him. Plato You've our thanks But that's but poor; you'll have the thanks of Athens. Believe me, when their present madness leaves them, And they reflect th'injustice of their conduct To you illustrious prisoner, much 'twill please them He hath escap'd their sentence; they will then Heap with caresses, with assur'd applause, All that have bravely ventur'd for his safety. Gaoler That as they list; the goodness of the deed Weighs more than me, than e'en a world's applause. Scene 5th Anitus, Melitus, Lycon Lycon The sacred ship is then return'd from Crete? Melitus She is; and now yon cool philosopher Must yield to fate; few are the hours he numbers, Ere he is reckon'd with the dead. Lycon My soul Longs for th'important moment, much I fear'd, His friends wou'd try their utmost power to save him. Anitus No doubt they have, and will; but won't succeed; Their greatest obstacle will be himself; The senate wou'd have wink'd at his escape; And had been glad he had evaded punishment. But here my anchor held; I knew his temper; I knew he wou'd not fly; he laughs at dying, And calls the apprehensions mortals form Of death, the brain's delirium—how? he fly? What inconsistence? No; that king of terrors Affrights not him, he'll brave him to the last, Or rather meet him as a friend. Melitus Absurd! To spurn our gods, and so insult their powers, And yet presume that, when he goes from hence, Eternal wretchedness is not his lot! Fine reasoning this! but so are fools deluded. Had he, content with what his fathers knew Liv'd as we liv'd, and, when his country call'd, Fought, like ourselves, her battles, and been silent, Nor sought presumptuous things above his sphere, Of woful issue to the publick weal, He might have liv'd for Melitus Lycon Or me. Anitus O say not, had he fought his country's battles; For righteous cause tho' I've pursued his death, Yet still I'll do his virtues ample justice. Myself have seen him—on that fatal day, When fierce Beotia's sons in Delium's plain Pour'd their victorious thousands on our troops, And we, like timerous flocks, when wolves pursue, Fled from them daunted; Socrates alone Bravely maintain'd his post, or, if receded, Twas as a lion, that disdains his hunters; He turn'd and fac'd them, and repell'd their fury; Till by his bold resistance he gave time To the dishearten'd soldier to retreat, And hide their shame in safety. Brave he stood; Not Ajax nor Achilles match'd his force; He dar'd them to the battle—they beheld him, As a divinity that fought for Athens, And, struck with reverence, check'd their full pursuit. Melitus Well; be his virtues what they will; no matter, Fate has him now, and, thank the gracious powers, Athens and we shall fear our foe no longer. But I will curb my joy—my worthy Lycon, My noble Anitus, good night to both, And let our hearts be blithe—he dies tomorrow. Socrates is credited with exceptional bravery in covering the retreat of the Athenian forces after the disaster at Delium (424 B.C.), where the Attic forces were routed by the Boetians. See Plato, Apology, 28e, Symposium, 219e, Laches, 181b. Cradock misspelled Boetia. Scene 6th The Prison Socrates discovered asleep; to him enter Plato, Phedon, Crito, and Gaoler Gaoler See, there he sleeps; thus ever hath he slept When nature call'd; his troubles seem not his; He feels them not; thus calm and thus resign'd, He lays him down and takes his sweet repose, As fate fear'd him, and he, her sovereign Lord, Cou'd stay her progress, and controul her power. Phedon Who, that views him, wou'd envy Persia's monarch? Surrounded by his guard, yet still embitter'd Are all his hours, some sudden plot he fears, And starts amid his slumbers, well aware Of might mischiefs, brooding o'er his head, And breaking quick upon him. Plato Tis not thus With virtuous men; our great preceptor shews us, E'en by that smile that now englads his face, That in his sleep he's happy—O ye Gods! Who wou'd not be that glorious man of virtue? Tomorrow comes, and he is then a corse, And yet—but see, he wakes—ye guardian powers, Inspire us with your own blest energy, To win him to our purpose, and to save him. Socrates awaking Thanks to that gracious Being, that now supports me: O this is heavenly rapture! Have I then E'en now a foretaste, what I soon shall be? Dear Melitus, I thank thee; thou wilt send me Strait to the region of immortal Spirts There to enjoy—my friends, what calls you forth In this inclement season of the night, To visit this dank dungeon? tis your love;— But sure tomorrow is our own—the laws Of Athens are not chang'd, that I must die, Ere I cou'd take or give a last farewel. Plato No, Socrates, tomorrow yet is yours; Spite of your cruel foes;—a noble cause Now calls us hither; fate's a length propitious And ere tomorrow dawns, are you secure From all the villain-efforts of your foes. Socrates What means my friend? Crito Oh! he hath glorious meaning; And wou'd the man, on whom our all depends, The dearest solace of our lives on earth, The nobler prospect of our joys hereafter, But listen to his pleadings, Athens yet May boast the blessing of her Socrates, For years to come; and he may long continue The pattern of all virtues of his Country. Socrates Unfold yourselves. Phedon The vessel is arriv'd Socrates I know it, and that I'm to die tomorrow. Crito aside O how I fear that steadiness of look, That firm demeanour—all our hopes are vain. Plato That you must die tomorrow? No, my father, Good Heaven reserves you still for nobler purpose; To make you yet his substitute below. This earth is still too rank to lose her Socrates; His lessons are too needful to her peace; She must not want you; and in kind compassion To erring mortals, he that wakes o'er all, That gracious providence you've long ador'd, Inspires this honest man to aid our counsels, To free you from your fate, and ope the way To your deliv'rance.—Some selected youths, The pupils long of your divine instructions, Are ready to convey you far from Athens, From the ungrateful citizens, to life To peace, to safety. O regard your friends, Your family, mankind—fly hence, and give Your future lessons to th'applauding world. Socrates How, Plato; this from you; from you, to whom I've long unfolded all my inmost soul? Is Socrates so little known by those, Who from their infant-years have learn'd his lore, That they shou'd think him meanly fond of life; Shou'd think he'd fly the death his country dooms him? My Country hath condemn'd me, her's the blame, If causeless she condemn'd—for me, I glory, That, innocent, I quit a thankless world, And spring to regions of immortal joy; To regions—cou'd my tongue express the rapture, My soul conceives at her desir'd release, My friends no more wou'd strive to stop her progress, But kindly aid her in her flight to Heaven. Plato Full well we know that life hath lost it's relish, That all it's glitter, all it's tinsel joys, Have not one charm, to win you from that Heaven. And yet—forgive the yearning of our souls— We still wou'd keep you, still wou'd we be blest With that divine, that more than heavenly sapience That flows so strongly from you, and leads on By inpersceptible degrees, our hearts To love of ev'ry virtue. Without thee Darkling bewilder'd we shall madly wander In life's vain errors, like the simple traveller, Lost in the mazes of a devious wood, Who knows no path to lead him on his way. Socrates Have then my precepts had so poor effect? What say'st thou, Plato? have I toil'd so long To guide you to your bliss, and toil'd in vain? O no, my friends; you're rich in ev'ry virtue; Form'd by my hand, you know each step is wisdom; Charm'd with her beauty, you will ne'er desert her. Tho' the world frowns, tho' wicked men exclaim, Tho' tirants threaten, you will ne'er desert her. And my glad soul presages, future times Will learn the lessons you have heard from me, Will copy from your page the fair example. There's no occasion I shou'd violate My country's laws by which I stand condemn'd, Nor stain my soul by acting 'gainst their verdict. Believe me, this would give me greater pangs, Than e'en a thousand deaths, such as I'm doom'd to. Phedon Yet wou'd we save thee— Crito O forgive our love, And yield thee to our prayers. Plato, pointing to the gaoler View this good man; Behold his honest eyes suffus'd with tears; He speaks not, for his heart's too full to speak, And yet his ev'ry gesture pleads thy pity, On him, on us, on all. Apame too, Her heart now bleeding for her brothers cruelty, Is wearying heaven—in vain? Must she in vain Plead to heaven for thee?—And need I say How thy Xantippe, how thy children—Oh! Will nothing move thee? bend thy soul a little, Be still a man, or soar above thy nature; Struggle with thy perfection for a while, And want thy happiness a little longer, To sooth the sorrowing hearts of those that love thee. Socrates Indeed, my friends, you love grows painful to me; The more, 'cause all your pleadings will be fruitless. I stand resolv'd—tis sure the will divine Which thus resolves me—I must die, my Plato, Tomorrow I must die; and oh! might life Be mine for yet a long, long round of years, And spritely youth and vigour wou'd return, New—string my nerves, and make me as I have been; I wou'd not quit the hopes of what my soul Assures herself that she shall be tomorrow. Leave me—I thank you for your pious friendship, But leave me—nature still demands repose, She will claim her debt out—When the morn Wakes to fresh life the tenants of the worlds, Again I'll see you, give one kind embrace, The last on earth—indeed I wou'd not grieve you, But part we now—I find, whilst I am mortal, I've all the weakness of a man about me— I must submit—farewel—my eyes grow heavy. Goes to his couch, and composes himself to rest; they continue fix'd for some time in amaze &amp; sorrow, when at length Plato Tis vain to urge him farther—he's a determin'd: His righteous soul won't in her own defence Act 'gainst the hallow'd statutes of his country. Good heavens! The godlike virtue of this man! O let us have him ever in our eye; Make him our precedent, like him support The World's despite, in conscious worth secure: And the like peace to our last hour ensure. End of the fourth act Act 5th Scene 1st Melitus What means this dreadful vision of the night? Ha! Sure it was not fancy? fancy breeds A thousand megrims in the brain, and loves To tease her e'en to madness.—No; twas real; I saw it plain, and horrid was it's figure; It glar'd upon me with the eye of death; And spoke too—sure it spoke—it mention'd Socrates, And told me, heav'n was pouring down it's vengeance On my accursed head—It was no dream; My slumbers left me soon, and long I lay, Stretch'd on the rack of conscience, when it came. It came—I saw it stalk into my chamber. How I'm distracted? Gods, was it for this, That I maintain'd your godhead 'gainst the wretch That wou'd have rob'd your temples of their worship? O for that peace I once enjoy'd—tis gone, And now I feel such tortures—I will feel them— My sister, ha! I wou'd not see her now. Scene 2d Melitus, Apame Apame Alass! my brother, what uncommon terror Speaks in your countenance? you look so wild, So sternly sad; that you alarm your sister. Melitus Apame, you've succeeded in your wishes; Your brother's lost; you pray'd the foes of Socrates Might feel the pangs of fell remorse—I feel them, And fall the victim of my own resentment. Apame Does Melitus relent? O heavely powers! The venerable sage will yet find mercy; My brother will retract the wrongs he did him, And haste to save him from the fatal potion. Melitus No; by the gods, I'll have my dear revenge; Save him? I save him? Were it possible To have my tortures doubled, (and I feel All that the most distracted mind can form) So strong the hate I hear him, he shou'd suffer, Shou'd die the death my vengeance draws upon him. Apame What horrid resolution? Are there gods? You say, there are, and have yourself asserted Their dread divinity. Say, will not they (They must be just) inflict severest torture On guilt like yours? O hear me, dearest brother; Give to your soul her peace, implore their mercy, To aid you in the justice you shou'd act; To make you gentle, humble, mild, forgiving, That you may yet— Melitus Ha! sayst thou? I implore The gods?—they'll hear not me, or, if they wou'd, I'll not implore them, for I'll not retract All that my injur'd soul hath urg'd against him. He merited my vengeance—I implore them? No; I'll not ask the mercy they'll not grant me. —Avaunt, foul spectre! What is Socrates To thee? art thou his wife, his child, his friend, That thus thou haunt'st me?—Well, I will be wretched; Away! I tell thee, that I will be wretched— O my pain'd heart!—Ha! hath he suffer'd, say you? Thank heaven for that the dotard then is gone To his reward—to what reward? Ay; there, There lies the question—If he shou'd be right— What's that to me? I'm sure, I must be wrong— Apame—sister! how dar'st thou intrude Upon thy brother's privacies? Phedon sent thee; I know him—he's the friend of Socrates, And he has sent thee to behold thy brother Curst e'en beyond redemption—hold, my brain! —Gods?—what Gods?—there are none—or if there are, They are the gods of Socrates, not mine— I'll have no Gods—Yes, roar, ye changeling crowd, Drag, tear me e'en to atoms, if you will; You're true Athenians, and I'm—horror, horror! Scene the 3d Apame Unhappy Melitus! I mourn thy crimes, I mourn thy punishment—alass! thou'st rack'd With the most cruel torture, conscious guilt. How wondrous sad thy fate? thou feel'st the pangs, Without the blest result, of dear repentance. Thou wou'dst be sorry for thy fault, but can'st not, So harden'd is thy heart! In what strong chain, The sinner's soul is bound? he wou'd be free; Vain is his wish; stern fate's inexorable, And holds him fast enfetter'd in his wretchedness. Oh! poor ill fated brother! I will pray for thee; Spite of my reverent love for Socrates, —Tis nature's dictate—I will pray for thee— With thee compar'd, he's happy, whilst thy soul Feels even now the measure of it's woes. Scene 4th Apame, Phedon Apame Alass! I've heard your kind attempt was fruitless; That all your eloquence, your prayers, your tears Mov'd not the god-like sage. He'll not escape; And Athens must receive a stain, which all The tears of her repenting citizens (For sure I am they will regret his death[)] Will ne'er wash out. Phedon No, my Apame, no; He will not hear us; he hath weigh'd it well, And on the ballance finds it best for virtue To quit at once a base and sordid world, A world unworthy of the Good she offers. We sued, as pious children to a parent, On whose dear life hung all their future welfare; In vain; he answer'd all our pleaded reasons, Said, he must die; that it was Heaven's high will; And he'd obey it: then with that authority That firm, commanding, yet endearing aspect, He wonted to instruct us, bad us leave him; His seem'd the voice of Heaven; in wonder lost, Sunk in our grief's distraction, we submitted. Apame O Phedon, what a day is this to Athens! How will she rue—yet she deserves it all— The dire result of her inhumane cruelty? Indeed I pity her—she demands my pity— Yes, O my country, I will pity thee. But for the virtuous man she hath condemn'd, Condemn'd unjustly; by his godlike firmness, He shews he has made his peace with those above, And only waits the destin'd hour for happiness; Therefore, an object only now of wonder, Rather, of envy, he's above our pity. Phedon I joy, my dear Apame's soul regains Her wonted calm; you look resign'd, my charmer, And quit your Socrates with that tranquillity, As suits his great philosophy. Apame Ah, Phedon! My soul is stunn'd;—it is indeed a calm— But what th' event?—that we must leave to Heaven. The death of Socrates, my brother's madness, For oh! he hath lost— Phedon Your brother? say, Apame What of your brother? Apame Now he left me, frantick, Mad with his guilt, and sunk in desolation Phedon Good Heaven! how you surprise me!—but, no wonder— When guilt like his recoils upon the soul Tis then a dreary waste, a dreadful gloom, And not one ray of comfort darts upon her But I forbear—O pardon me, Apame. Apame Yes; I will pardon thee; thou say's no more, Than what becomes the friend of Socrates; Myself condemns him, tho' I am his sister; A sister, that much loves and pities him. O Heavens! What means my heart?—it seems too easy; These two great evils, that shou'd sink her down To deepest woe— Phedon Oh! add a third, my charmer, A third, that, spite of all I feel for Socrates Gives me more cruel pangs, our hapless loves. Apame Yes; Phedon: I must own, I once indulg'd A fruitless hope, that thou and I were form'd By Heaven's blest power, to give each other happiness, But tis determin'd, tis above determin'd That we must meet. Phedon Thus mortals oft Plan to themselves their flattering schemes of bliss, And, spite of all their vaunted art and forsight, Drop from their airy hopes to dire despair. What must I say? at this tremendous moment What can I say? And yet I wou'd say something. Alass! O can't—My soul distrest, desponding, Wants e'en conception to describe the pangs, That rack her now, and makes her more than wretched. Apame Say this; that thou art still Apame's friend That thou wilt ever bear within thy breast Her dear Idea In Platonic philosophy, an idea is an archetype of which all real things are but imperfect imitations., as she will do thine; That thou wilt still pursue the glorious track Thy great Preceptor led thee; and endeavour T'improve in ev'ry grace, in ev'ry virtue; Say this; and thy Apame yet will promise To love thee still, t'indulge the holy friendship That flames her soul for thee, to weary Heaven With prayers for Phedon, and to her last hour Think on thee with affection and with rapture. Phedon Say this! O Heavens! My feeble tongue wants utterance To tell thee—this is more than I durst hope; To be subject of Apame's prayers, The constant object of her tender thought, The sole delight of her remaining hours! What can't I promise thee? divinest maid! Oh! I'll be all that thou wou'dst have me be; And, if not here, yet sure in future worlds, Transporting thought! our gentle souls shall meet, Where no impetuous storms of fate shall part us. Apame Be that our hope; tis time we now retire, You to the prison, to perform the last Kind, filial service to your dying master. Tell him, Apame never will forget Th'important lessons that she learn'd from him; Tell him she deeply mourns her loss, not his, Much will she want him—but she hopes to see him In better worlds, where she and thou and all That lov'd him here, and listen'd to his lore, Will yet attend him in an endless state Of peace, of happiness.—farewel—my soul Sinks to her heaviness—farewel, my Phedon. Phedon One kind embarce—Sure modesty forbids not This last—forgive me; but my soul hangs on thee, As o'er the body it's departing spirit, Unwilling to forsake her long-lov'd mansion. Do not refuse me—tis the last sad favour Thy Phedon asks— She inclines to him O Heavens! and I must lose thee? Farewel;—sure, sure, it will not be—for ever. Scene 5th The Prison Socrates Today I am to die—What art thou, death? Some say, a dread, a formidable tirant, That mak'st mankind thy quarry, and devourst them, Till they're no more than what they were, ere first The great Eternal call'd them into being. Thou art not so; and such I shall not find thee. I've noblest prospects far; and to my soul So mild thy aspect, that I'll call thee friend. Thou'lt lead me, where at least my better part Will meet with perfect virtue, certain knowledge, With all th'improvements that she sought in vain In this low scene.—Her state is sure progressive, She still went on each day acquiring something, Yet still dissatisfied, met not completion, And wanted something farther still to be. Nay more; her innocence, her constant bent To sweet philanthropy, to doing good, Was given by that dread power for noblest ends. Are those ends answer'd? No. I feel, I am not Contented with the little I have done, And wou'd do farther—but I must not here; My judges have forbad me—Therefore, therefore, I go from hence to where no vile incumbrance, No base abuse of power, no impious malice Will hinder me from doing all I can: Where I shall still be virtuous; nay be all What wisdom tells me, I have not been yet; And feel each ardent faculty within me Fully employ'd, and blest in it's attainments. Scene 6th Socrates, Plato, Phedon, Crito and others Socrates Socrates Welcome, my faithful pupils; you are come To bid your Socrates a last farewel. A last? No sure; we yet shall meet again. I've been debating with myself, my friends, And find upon the upshot, I have gain'd. Tis true, I might have liv'd a little longer; But oh! that little longer I had liv'd Had rob'd me just so much of happiness. Plato Thou peerless man! how I adore thy virtues! Now on the confines of eternity, Thy looks, thy words, thy gestures are so calm, So full of inward peace, my soul admires thee. Socrates For what, my Plato? He that acts aright, At such a time as this is ever easy. It may be hard to know we act aright; Yet, if no conscious thought within disturb us, No nauseous bitter mingles with our sweet, But all is peace and pleasantness, sure then Death's a mere phantom, and must lose his terrors. Phedon Alass! so wretched is the state of man, We know not what we must be; thou art right; My soul assures me, Socrates is right; And yet—forgive me—still my darken'd mind [Is] lost in her surmises, and she knows not How to unriddle these thy causeless sufferings. Socrates Phedon, I can't inform thee more than what I know myself; I've yet no full conception Of how it will be; but my soul forebodes Joy 'bove expression: Heaven for noblest ends May yet delay to great enquiring man The knowledge of his future fate above. Crito That's our distress; we've view'd the constant tenor Of thy applauded life; and to reflect The vile indignities thou hast endur'd The base, insidious villain schemes against thee, The woful death that thou must die today, Fills us with vain incertitude; we wonder— What mean the powers above, that they shou'd yield thee Thus to thy impious foes. Socrates You quite surprise me, How, Crito, don't I tell thee I'm ascertain'd Of being something nobler than I am While I am here—but what—that lies beyond The ken of present knowledge—God is good, Is gracious ever—In some future time, When man's prepar'd to hear the happy tidings, Some blessed sage will rise t'instruct him, whither He goes from hence, to teach the certain road He must pursue to reach his destin'd goal. Meanwhile tis but our duty to await That glorious period; we not know it yet; [But] if I bode aright, our after-race Won't be bewilder'd in a fruitless search Of this important question. Plato Be it so! Be heaven thus gracious to his creature, man; And let all those, who've learnt from thee the rule, I had almost said, th'unerring rule to live, Await that welcome instant—Ah! my Socrates, Xantippe comes; she comes to bid forever Adieu to her dear Socrates; look on her With eyes of tenderness; she's deeply wounded, And merits all the pity thou canst shew her. Socrates She is my best-belov'd; heaven only knows The true esteem that warms my heart for her. Scene 7th Socrates, Xantippe, Plato, Phedon, Crito &amp; c. Xantippe runs to him and embraces him O Socrates! Socrates My dear, my best Xantippe. Xantippe And art thou going? have thy foes prevail'd And must I lose thee? On this fatal day Fore'er lose thee? O my bleeding heart! My Socrates, do we now part for ever? Socrates So heaven ordains; and tho my soul reflects fondness all the happy hours And yet— [end of manuscript] On The two Miss ?'? as they Sat before me, hearing of Mr. Whitefield— An Extempore Epigram. Plac'd as I was, such charms within my view, Say, Whitefield, what could all thy Rhet'ric do? In vain the nonsense trickl'd from thy tongue, In vain with canting harmony you Sung; Their blooming beauties more perswasive prov'd, My heart with greater energy they mov'd, Their Swan-like necks my ravish'd eyes did bliss, Courted the touch, and tempted me to kiss.— “The name given under the Emperor by flatt'rers &amp; dependents to their Patrons” “This is translated to shew that Poets are not always prophets”</field>
