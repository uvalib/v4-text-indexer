      <field name="fulltext">To the REVEREND Mr. Timothy Edwards. Sir, At sight of this you scarcely will Excuse My broken Numbers should affront your Muse, Whose single Elegance outdoes the Nine; And all their Off'rings at Apollo's shrine. But, Sir, they come not to Affront, but are Trembling before your awful Seat to hear, From you their Sentence that's definitive, Whither they shall be kill'd, or sav'd alive. Yet when you Censure, Sir, don't make the Verse You pin'd to Glover's venerable Hearse, The standard for their Trial: nor Enact You never will acquit, what's Left Exact. Sir, that will never do; Rules so severe Would ever Leave Apollo's Altars bare, His Priests no service: All must starve Together And fair Parnassus Verdant tops must wither. Sure that was not the purpose nor design, Of the fair Sisters when they did Combine Themselves in your Assistance: no their mind In that great Work was otherwise Design'd. They having often to their Trouble seen Many bold Poets Launch on Hipocrene; Men that might have a handsom Voyage made Had they but kept them to the Coasting Trade. But Ranging far upon those swelling Seas, Came home with broken Lines and Voyages: Griev'd of those Losses and Miscarriages, A Council met at Hipocrenidees. They Vote a Remedy which to Effect That their Herculan Pillar did Erect, And to advise Adventurers once for all, Writ ne plus ultra on it's Pedestal. Since which there's none that dare presume to go Beyond that wonder then set up by you, No nor attain it in their Navigation, That sacred work is not for Imitation! Conscious of this, you see my Muse ne're soars To Hiblas top nor the Aonian shoars, Nor doth pretend to Raptures that might sute, Pindarus Muse or great Apollo's Lute. Then weigh them Candidly, and if that you Shall once pronounce a Longer Life their due: And for their Patron will your self Engage, They may perhaps Adventure on the stage: But if deny'd, they blushing back retire To burn themselves in their own funeral Fire! Windsor, January 4th. 1722, 3. MEDITATIONS on Man's First and Fallen Estate, and the Wonderful Love of GOD Exhibited in a Redeemer. Once did I view a fragrant Flower fair, Till thro' the optick windows of mine Eye The sweet discoveries of its beauties rare Did much affect &amp; Charm my fantasie, To see how bright and sweetly it did shine In Beauties that were purely Genuine. But Lo, the dire Effects of baneful Pride; A weed whose favour was Pestiferous Did vie with this fair flower Qualify'd With many Vertues Odoriferous. This fragrant flower which to affect the sense Had Beauties, Grace, and Vertues Excellence. Not being Content unworthily to stand In the dark Corner of some mead obscure, Or in some rough uncultivated Land Which th' painful Husbandman did nev'r manure; Or in some dismal wood where Mischief Lyes And Ravens croak their fatal Auguries. But by a bold Insulting Disposition Presumes into a famous Garden fair And more to Manifest it's bold Ambition, Vies with the fairest flowers that were there; And by it's growth the flowers so overtops That it bereaved them of Heavens drops. Collecting of the Nutrimental juice That's of the Earth it did Monopolize The same to it's own benefit and Use, Also the benediction of the Skies. Thus to it's Baseness makes subservient, Earth's fruitfulness and Heaven's dews descent. The Flowers thus Injuriously ov'r-topt Began to darken perish fade and dye, Their beauty Lost &amp; all their Grace was Cropt Their Savour soon became unsavoury; For having Lost the Suns sweet Influence They with it Lost their Grace and Excellence. Nor were they in this Deplorable state Able to work their Liberty and Ease None but the Gardiner can Extricate, Them from their Bondage and give them release. Many instructions may from hence arise If on this embleme we do Moralize. I'le take occasion hence to Contemplate Fair Paradise in it's prime Excellence But most of all the Glorious Estate, Of our first Father in his Innocence. Who was the flower of that Garden, and A Garden in which many flowers did stand. His body with such Comliness was deck't As did declare this famous Faberick Was of no ordinary Architect, But the Almighties Glorious work-manship, Being fearfully and wonderfully made, By him that needed not a foreign aid. His parts proportion and rare Simmetrie Shew'd forth his Glorious uniformal Grace His pleasant and yet awful Majestie, Appeared in the figure of his face: Where ruby ruddiness did beautify The lily white with a Vermilion dye. Behold him there made Misne Lord of all The whole Creation that was sublunary And all the Creatures made that so they shall Unto his Comfort be Contributary, He was to take their Tributes and again, Offer them up unto his Soveraign. His understanding was so Excellent That he was able by his Knowledge Great Names to all Creatures in his Government To give: Ev'n such as were most adequate, Unto their Inclinations Natural, O wondrous wisdom Philosophy call. But was that Knowledge and discerning Skill The Sole perfection of this noble Nature? O no; he was possessed with a will, Able to Love and serve his great Creator. To apprehend him as his Chiefest Good, And prize him more than his appointed food. He was Commissionated to remain In this Estate to perpetuity Here might he Live rejoyce in God and Reign Throughout the Ages of Eternity. And of all the Delights and fruits of Eden, Only the Tree of Knowledge was forbidden. But Lo, the dire Effects of baneful Pride Man being made in Honour thus to flourish Did not a night in that Estate abide But soon became like to the beasts that perish. Abusing of his Liberty of will Against his Sovereign Lord he did rebel. For casting off that Reverential awe He ow'd unto God's Sacred Majestie Against the Comminations of his Law, He did rebel, and in rebellion he The Sacramental Tree of Life neglected, And eat of that which God had Interdicted. And for endeavouring to Equalize The Lord's Omniscence: is quite ruinated And hath his Soul in all its Faculties Strangely Besotted and Infatuated: For having once rebell'd against his duty, Opacous Sin soon blasted all his beauty. Now we have Lost Ability to Climb The steps of Providence unto Gods Throne: Our Souls (alas) are now to Insublime, To Seat and Settle our Affections on The Pinacle of all Perfection, Whose Vision Satisfys th' Affection. But through a Poisonous Impetuous Rage, Our Minds we to these Earthly Objects glew: And tho' we find they can't our Thirst asswage, The more we're Dis-appointed, we pursue. Thus do we prostitute our vast affection, To yield to our Inferiours subjection. But when we sunk under this misery And all help failed us on every side No Creature could find out a way whereby, Justice Offended might be Satisfi'd: To do that work our Saviour undertook As it was writ i'th' Volumn of the book. The Love that gave him, Oh! 'twas Infinite; The Person suffering was most Excellent The Pains he suffered were most Exquisite; And Glorious was the blessed Consequent. With wonderment and Ravishing surprize, The Angels Contemplate these Mysteries. When I behold th' Heavens wond'rous frame The Sun and Moon shining in Beauty bright Which thou hast made to Magnify thy Name By thy Almighty power Infinite And View the Stars in their celestial ranging Not Jostling in all their inter-changing. Oh what is man that thou shouldest allow Him to Inherit thy divine compassion? What is the sinful Son of man that thou Should'st grant to him thy Spirits visitation? And suffer thine Eternal SON to dye To Reconcile thy stubborn Enemy. Proverbs XVI. 18. Pride goeth before Destruction. Pride goes before Destruction and haughtiness before a fall, Whoever pores his Merits on shall be Endangered there withal. Whoever vaults himself on high in Contemplating his own worth Shall find his wings soon melt thereby and down he'll tumble to the Earth: Have I got wit and memory and can my tongue freely dispence, To Charm the silent standers by torrents of moving Eloquence. Beauty sets Throned in my face and my sweet Symmetry of parts Yields such an uniformal Grace as wins all Eyes and wounds all hearts. And hath my birth Ennobled me of a noble Pedigree From whence many fair Branches spread more to adorn and cover me: An Education liberal has been bestowed me upon, Have I to Crown these Blessings all an healthy Constitution? The Earth with her abundant store yields me the greatest Confluence, So that from her can be no more to pamper and Indulge the sense. Doth pleasure with her balmy hand proffer to flood me on her streams And subject unto my Command whatever carnal sense Esteems? Doth honour with her Courtly breath invite me to her Turrets high To rule and Govern on the Earth whilest Thousands fore me prostrate ly? To what a pleasing topick now think I my fortune hath me rais'd, Tis sweet to see whole Thousands bow whilest by them every one I'm prais'd. Now hard it is not to grow proud and over others Tyranize And think because I'm thus Endow'd my self I well may Idolize. Or in a mirror when I look on the sweet feature of my face Narcissus like I soon am took, a Captive and confin'd the place. O me to see my youthful blood now in its prime activity Comes Rushing like a ruby Flood, the Lily skin to beautify. When tempted thus at any time then O my Soul don't thou forget That these Endowments are not mine, but for them all I'm still in Debt. These are but Talents in my hand of which I only have the use And he that gave them gave Command, they should be us'd without abuse. The Man that gave them is Austere and Reapest where he hath not straw'd That is, He's dreadfully severe, Exacting all he hath bestow'd. My Talents all are Registred in his book of Rememberance And he has set a time to plead, his book and take his recompence. There's no vain action, no vain word, nor vain Imagination That ever in my heart hath stir'd since there the vital Spirits run. Tho' unobserv'd, tho' multiply'd so that all numbers they surmount The smallest of them shall not hide, nor be forgot in that account. And in that awful Reckoning Day escape his Vengeance shall not I Unless exactly I repay each Talent down with usury. If it be so: say how shall I improve those gifts he hath bestow'd? He says, with men deal equally, and walk thou humbly with thy God: Serve him with awful Reverence 'tis thus thou must thy gifts Improve And if I fail thro' Impotence, the Law may be fulfil'd by Love. For tho' He's Just, He's good also the one doth not confound the other; His Justice and his goodness too, both set on equal Thrones together. Proverbs XXXI. 10. Who can find a Vertuous Woman, for her Price is far above Rubies. Vertue's a Babe, first born in Paradice, And hath by birth priority of Vice. Vertue is all that's good we brought from thence The dear remains of our first Innocence. Vertue still makes the Vertuous to shine, Like those that Liv'd in the first week of time. Vertue hath force the vile to cleanse again, So being like clear shining after Rain. A Kind and Constant, Chearful Vertuous Life, Becomes each Man, and most Adorns a Wife. But such a Vertue, ah, where shall we find, That's Bright, especially in Woman kind? If such an one had been on Earth, no doubt Searching King Solomon had found her out. But stay my Muse, nor may we thence Conclude, There is not One in all their Multitude: For tho' it be too True, that Solomon Amongst a Thousand found not such an one; It follows not at all but such an one Amongst an Hundred Thousand may be shown; Which if she may, her Price beyond Compare, Excels the Price of Rubies very fair. Psalm LXIV. 6. The Heart is Deep. He that can trace a Ship making her way, Amidst the threatening Surges on the Sea; Or track a Towering Eagle in the Air, Or on a Rock find the Impressions there Made by a Serpents Footsteps. Who Surveys The Subtile Intreagues that a Young Man lays, In his Sly Courtship of an harmless Maid, Whereby his Wanton Amours are Convey'd Into her Breast; Tis he alone that can Find out the Cursed Policies of Man. Proverbs XVIII. 14. A Wounded Spirit who can bear? Money answers every thing, But a Guilty Conscience Sting, Whose Immortal Torments are Quite Insupportable to bear, Nor the Silver of Peru, Nor the Wealth the East do shew, Nor the softest Bed of Down, Nor the Jewels of a Crown, Can give unto the Mind a Power, To bear its Twinges half an Hour. When GOD's Iron Justice once Seiseth on the Conscience, And in fearful ample wise Lays before the Sinners Eyes, His Lifes Horrible Transgressions, In their dreadful Aggravations; And then for his greater aw, In most ample forms doth draw All the Curses of his Law; Then the Worm begins to gnaw, And altho' it every hour Doth the very Soul Devour, Yet it nothing doth Sussice; Oh! this Worm that never Dies. Oh! the Multitude of thought Into which the Sinner's brought; Looking up he sees GOD's Power Through his Angry Face doth Lour; And hath for his ruin Join'd Ten Thousand Chariots in the Wind: All prepar'd to Glorify, The Strong Arm of the most high. By Inflicting Punishments Equal to his Vengeance. Looking Down he amply seeth Hell rowling in her Flames beneath; Enlarg'd to take his Soul into Its deep Caverns full of Wo: Now the Sinners Apprehension Stretcheth Large as Hells Dimensions, And doth Comprehensively Fathom out Eternity. The most extream and Vexing Sense Seiseth on the Conscience. Fill'd with deepest Agony, He maketh this Soliloquy. View those Torments most extream See this torrid Liquid Stream In the which my Soul must fry Ever, and yet never Dy. When a Thousand Years are gone There's ten Thousand coming on: And when these are over worn, There's a Million to be born, Yet they are not Comprehended, For they Never shall be Ended. Now Despair by Representing, Eternity fill'd with Tormenting, By Anticipation brings All Eternal Sufferings, Every Moment up at once Into actual Sufferance, Thus those Pains that are to come, Ten Thousand Ages further down; Every Moment must be born Whilest Eternity is worn Every Moment that doth come, Such Torments brings; as if the sum Of all God's anger now were pressing, For all in which I liv'd transgressing. Yet the next succeeding Hour, Holdeth forth his Equal power; And succeeding with it brings, Up the sum of Sufferings. Yet they are not Comprehended, For they never shall be Ended. For GOD Himself He is but One, Without least Variation: Just what He was; is, is to come Always entirely the same. Possessing his Eternity Without succession instantly, With whom the like proportion bears, One Day as doth a Thousand Years. He makes the Prison and the Chain, He is the Author of my pain. 'Twas unto Him I made Offence; 'Tis He that takes the Recompence. 'Tis His design my Misery Himself alone shall Glorify; Therefore must some proportion bear With Him, whose Glory they declare. And so they shall, being Day and Night, Unchangeable and Infinite. These very Meditations are, Quite Insupportable to bear: The fire within my Conscience, Is Grown so fervent and intense, I cannot long its force endure, But rather shall my End procure. Griefly Death's pale Image lies, On my Ghastly piercing Eyes. My hands made for my lifes defence, Are ready to do violence Unto my life: And send me hence, Unto that awful residence. There to be fill'd with that Despair, Of which the Incipiations are, A Wounded Spirit none can bear. But, Oh! My Soul, think once again, That there is for this burning Pain, One only Medicine Soveraign. CHRIST's Blood will fetch out all this Fire, If that God's SPIRIT be the Applyer. Oh! Then my Soul when Grief abounds, Shroud thy self within these Wounds: And that thou there may'st be Secure, Be Purified as He is Pure. And, Oh! my GOD, let me behold thy SON, Impurpled in his Crucifixion, With such an eye of Faith that may from thence Derive from Him a Gracious Influence, To cure my Sin and Wounded Conscience. There, there alone is Healing to be had: Oh! Let me have that Balm of Gilead. Matthew X. 28. And fear not them that can kill the body, but are not able to kill the Soul: But rather fear Him, which is able to destroy both Soul and Body in Hell. And is our Life, a life wherein we borrow No not the smallest respite from our Sorrow? Our Profits are they but some Yellow Dust; Subject to Loss, to Canker-eat and Rust: Whose very Image breedeth ceaseless Cares In every Mind where it Dominion bears. And are our Pleasures mainly in Excess? Which genders Guilt, and ends in Bitterness. Are Honours fickle and dependent Stuff? Oft-times blown furthest from us by a Puff. Doth pale-fac'd Envy wait at every Stage, To bite and wound us in our Pilgrimage? Is all we have, or hope for, but Adventure? Then here's nought worth our stay, let us encounter The King of Terrors bravely, un-dismay'd, As gallant Aria to her Pætus said. And so might be my Choice, but that I see Hells flashes folding through Eternitie; And hear damn'd Company, that there remain For very Anguish gnaw their Tongues in twain. Then him for Happy I will never Praise, That's fill'd with Honour, Wealth, or length of Days: But Happy he, though in a Dying Hour, O're whom the Second Death obtains no power. A Brief ACCOUNT Of The AGENCY Of the HONOURABLE John Winthrop, Esq; in the COURT of King Charles the Second, Anno Dom. 1662. When he Obtained for the Colony of Connecticut His Majesty's Gracious CHARTER. The Night is Past, &amp; Civil Wars o're-blown, And the right Heir advanced to the Throne, A general Joy runs thro' Great-Britanny, At the appearance of His Majesty: Loud Canons from the Ships upon the Thames, And from the Batteries fill'd the Air with Flames: Whilst from the Tower such mighty Thunders went As shook the Islands, Seas, and Continent. The Rich, the Poor, the Old, the Young, agree, To Celebrate a joyful Jubilee: And to the utmost all themselves Employ, To make free Demonstrations of their Joy. Some quaff full Goblets of the Richest Wine; And others make the blazing Bonfires shine: Whil'st the Devout their Prayers to Heaven sent, For Blessings on the King and Government. These happy Tidings soon found out their way, Unto the English in America; Who join with Britain in the Celebration, Of their just Princes happy Restauration. The Sages of Connecticut do meet, To pay their Homage at their Princes Feet; To whom they seek to hasten an Address, To shew their Duty and their Joys Excess. Learned WINTHROP then by general Consent, Sat at the Helm to sway the Government; Who prudently the People doth Advise, To ask the King for CHARTER Liberties. All like his Counsel well; and all reply, Sir, You must undertake our Agency: For there is none but You we may expect, Can make the thing you Counsel take Effect: Your Serving us in this Important Thing, And Personating Us before the KING, Will sure Endear a WINTHROP's Memory To Us, and to our Last Posterity. His Mind, vast as the Heavenly Spheres above, Was all bespangled with the Stars of Love; And Zealous Care for their Prosperity, Of all his Acts the Primum Mobile; Led on by these bright Stars kind Influence, He hastens to the Palace of his Prince; There waiting for an Opportunity,— E're long, Great Charles was in his Council sat With some Choice Nobles of his Cabinet: His Royal Mind Intent on his Affairs, He thus Unbosoms to his Counsellers; What News, My Lords? How go Affairs Abroad? What more Remains to do for Englands Good? Do distant Parts of our Dominion Want farther Help or Favour from the Throne? At this arose one of the Lords of Trade, And to His Majesty this Answer made, An Agent from Connecticut doth wait, With an Address before your Palace Gate. Let him come in, says Charles, and let us Hear, What has been done, and what's a doing there? Winthrop brought in before his Princes Feet, Prostrates himself with Reverence, as 'twas meet And thanks His Majesty for his Access: Then for his People offers this Address; ‘GREAT SIR, Since Reconciled Heaven Restores ‘YOU to the Throne of Your High Ancestors, ‘See how each Subject Emulating tries, ‘To Express our National Felicities: ‘The Joy of Your Accession to the Throne, ‘Is like the Lustre of the Morning Sun; ‘Which from the East Salutes the Western Shores, ‘Still trampling under foot Nights horrid Powers: ‘So the loud Accents of this boundless Joy, ‘Ecchoing in our Ears from Britanny, ‘Gave Light &amp; Gladness where-so'ere it came, ‘And fill'd our joyful Hearts with equal Flame. ‘The sad Remembrance of those days of Wo, ‘Which in your Absence we did undergo, ‘Transports our present Joys to that Excess, ‘As passeth all Expressions to express. ‘May Heaven preserve Your Majesty, and Bless ‘Your Reign with Honour, &amp; with Length of Days; ‘And in Your Line the Regal Power extend, ‘Until the Suns last Revolution end. ‘And since we are at Mighty Cæsar's Feet, ‘O may He Pardon us, while we Entreat, ‘Your Royal Favour in the thing we want; ‘T' Incorporate us by Your CHARTER-Grant. ‘The Land we've Purchas'd, or Subdu'd by Fight, ‘And Bought of Fenwick what was Warwick's Right, ‘And all at the Endeavour of our Own, ‘Without the least Dis-bursment from the Throne. Rise up, Quoth Charles; My Liberal Hand Supplies, All needful Help to every One that Cries; Nor shall I be Illiberal to You: But, Prithee, Winthrop, Please to let me Know, By whom it was your Place did first Commence, Your Patriarchs that Led your Tribes from Hence? ‘If to declare their Worth, is what You ask, ‘Then I must beg Your Pardon. That's a task, ‘So Worthy due Performance, and so Great, ‘As goes beyond my Utterance and Conceipt: ‘But Vertue never fails, succeeding Days ‘Shall much regard their Merits, and shall Raise ‘Men of bright Parts and moving Oratory; ‘Who shall Emblazon their immortal Glory. ‘But if You ask to gain Intelligence, ‘What were the Reasons, why they went from hence, ‘What Straits they met with in their Way, &amp; There? ‘These Facts I think I'm able to declare. ‘RELIGION was the Cause; Divinity ‘Having declared the Gospel shine should be, ‘Extensive as the Suns Diurnal Shine; ‘This mov'd our Founders to this Great design, ‘And sure the Holy Spirit from above, ‘That first did Quickning on the Waters move, ‘Inspir'd their Minds &amp; fill'd them with Intents, ‘To bring to pass such Glorious Events. ‘And now they wholly to this Work devote, ‘Mind not the Country they are going out: ‘Their Ancient Homes they leave to come no more. ‘Their Weeping Friends &amp; Kindred on the shore ‘They bid adieu, and with an aking Heart ‘Shake Hands, 'tis hard when dearest Friends must part. ‘But here they part and leave their Parent Isle, ‘Their whilome Happy Seat. The Winds a while ‘Are Courteous and Conduct them on their way, ‘To near the midst of the Atlantick Sea, ‘When suddenly their Pleasant Gales they Change ‘For dismal Storms that on the Ocean Range. For Faithless Æolus Meditating Harms, ‘Breaks up the Peace and Priding much in Arms, ‘Unbars the great Artillery of Heaven ‘And at the fatal Signal by him given, ‘The Cloudy Chariots Threatning take the Plains; ‘Drawn by wing'd Steeds, hard pressing on their reins. ‘These Vast Battalions in dire Aspect rais'd, ‘Start from the Barriers-night with Lightning blaz'd ‘Whil'st clashing Wheels resounding Thunder cracks, ‘Struck Mortals deaf, &amp; Heaven astonished shakes. ‘Here the Ship Captain in the midnight Watch, ‘Stamps on the Deck &amp; thunders up the Hatch; ‘And to the Mariners aloud he Cries, ‘Now all from Safe-recumbency arise: ‘All Hands aloft, &amp; stand well to your Tack, ‘Engendring Storms have cloath'd the Sky with black, ‘Big Tempests threaten to Undo the World: ‘Down Top-sail, let the Main-sail soon be furl'd, ‘Hast to the Fore-sail, there take up a Rief: ‘'Tis time, Boys, now if ever to be brief: ‘Aloof for Life; lets try to stem the Tide, ‘The Ship's much Water, thus we may not Ride: ‘Stand roomer then, let's run before the Sea, ‘That so the Ship may feel her Stearage-way: ‘Steady at Helm! Swiftly along she Scuds, ‘Before the Wind, and cuts the foaming Suds. ‘Sometimes aloft she lifts her Prow so high, ‘As if she'd run her Bowsprit thro' the Skie. ‘Then from the summit Ebbs and hurries down, ‘As if her way were to the Center shown. ‘Mean while our Founders in the Cabbin sat, ‘Reflecting on their true and sad Estate. ‘Whilst holy Warham's Sacred lips did treat, ‘About GOD's Promises, and Mercies Great. ‘Still more Gigantick Births spring from the Clouds, ‘Which tore the tatter'd Canvis from the Shrouds, ‘And dreadful Balls of Lightning fill the Air, ‘Shot from the Hand of the Great Thunderer. ‘And now a mighty Sea the Ship or'e rakes, ‘Which falling on the Deck the Bulk-head breaks; ‘The Sailors cling to Ropes and frighted Cry, ‘The Ship is Foundered, We dy! we dy! ‘Those in the Cabbin heard the Sailors Screech, ‘All rise and Reverend Warham do beseech, ‘That he would now lift up to Heaven a Cry, ‘For Preservation in Extremity. ‘He with a Faith sure bottom'd on the Word, ‘Of Him that was of Sea and Winds the LORD. ‘His Eyes lifts up to Heaven, his hands Extends, ‘And fervent Prayers for deliverence sends. ‘The Winds abate, the Threatning Waves appease, ‘And a sweet Calm sits Regent on the Seas. ‘They bless the Name of their Deliverer, ‘Who now they found a God that heareth Prayer. ‘Still further West-ward on they keep their way, ‘Plowing the Pavement of the briny Sea. ‘Till the vast Ocean they had overpast, ‘And in Connecticut their Anchors cast. ‘Here came Soheage and told the Company, ‘The Garden of America did Ly, ‘Further up Stream near Fifty Miles from hence, ‘Part of which Country he himself was Prince. ‘Much ask'd o'th Soil, much of the Government, ‘What Kings were there? the Land of what Extent? ‘All which by his free answers when they knew, ‘They or'e his back a Scarlet Mantle threw. ‘And now invited with fresh Southern Gales, ‘They weigh their Anchors &amp; they hoise their Sails, ‘And Northward for th' Expected Country stood, ‘Upon the smiling Pavement of the Flood. ‘At length they Entered those awful Streights, ‘Where the Stream runs thro' Adamantine Gates. ‘Twas strange to see the Banks advanc'd so high, ‘As if with Atlas they bore up the Sky. ‘But when those dismal Streights were passed thro', ‘A Glorious Country opens to their view. ‘Cloath'd all in Green and to the Eye presents, ‘Natures best Fruits and Richest Ornaments. ‘Chear'd with the sight they set all Sails a-trip, ‘And rais'd the English Ensign on their Ship. ‘Brave Youths with eager Strokes bend knotty Oars, ‘Glad shouts bring chearful Eccho's from the Shores. ‘As when the Wounded Amorous doth spy, ‘His Smiling Fortune in his Ladys Eye, ‘O how his Veins and Breast swell with a Flood, ‘Of pleasing Raptures that revive his Blood? ‘And grown impatient now of all Delays, ‘No longer he Deliberating stays; ‘But thro' the Force of her resistless Charms, ‘He throws him Soul &amp; Body in her Arms. ‘So we amazed at these seen Delights, ‘Which to fruition every sense Invites, ‘Our eager Mind already Captive made, ‘Grow most Impatient now to be delay'd. ‘This most Delightful Country to Possess, ‘And forward with Industrious speed we press ‘Upon the Virgin Stream who had as yet, ‘Never been Violated with a Ship; ‘Upon the Banks King Aramamet Stood, ‘And round about his Wondering Multitude, ‘Greatly Amazed at such an uncouth show, ‘What is't they Cry'd? Some say, A great Canoe. ‘Others, a Bird that in the Air doth Fly, ‘With her Long Bill, and Wings up to the Skie. ‘But other some, whom Fear did Terrify ‘Cry'd, tis some Ill Presaging Prodigie. ‘Nothing on Earth more Impetuous we find, ‘Than Terror when it Seiseth on the Mind. ‘Dreadful Effects of this did soon Appear, ‘The Multitude Surpriz'd with chilling Fear; ‘With Looks Distracted, &amp; out-staring Eyes, ‘Each Scares himself and others Terrifys; ‘Only the King who had within his Breast, ‘A Heart which foolish fear could not Infest; ‘Perceiv'd the Matter, and the Ship he hails, ‘Now drop your Anchors, and unbend your Sails; ‘And if for Peace and Friendship you are come, ‘And do Desire this Land shou'd be your Home; ‘Let some of your Chief Leaders come to Land, ‘And now with Me join their right Hand to Hand. ‘Sails lower amain, nor Oars now touch the Flood, ‘Down drop the Anchors deep into the Mud. ‘Their Chiefs Repair to Land, &amp; with them bring ‘Obliging Presents for the Indian King. ‘Majestick Aramamet with his Lords, ‘Steps forth to meet those Guests without his Guards ‘Meeting he paus'd, astonish'd at the sight, ‘Such Men, such Airs such Countenances bright, ‘He ne'er had seen, nor now to see Expecting; ‘Amaz'd he stood! a while, but recollecting, ‘His Scattered Intellect, he crys, Who's there? ‘Whence come you? Seek you with us Peace or War? ‘Brittons you see, say they, and we are come, ‘From England happiest Seat in Christendom, ‘Where Mighty CHARLES Obligeth Sea &amp; Land ‘To yield Obedience to his Scept'red Hand, ‘Nor came we here to Live with you in Wars, ‘As He knows best that made Sun Moon &amp; Stars, ‘But rather here to Live with you in Peace, ‘Till Day and Nights Successive Changes cease. ‘This we propose, and this if you approve ‘And do Respect our Neighbourhood and Love, ‘Then Sell us Land, whereon we Towns may Plant, ‘And join with us in Friendly Covenant. ‘What you propose, (quoth he,) is Just &amp; Good, ‘And I shall e're Respect your Neighbourhood; ‘Land you may have, we Value not the Soil, ‘Accounting Tillage too severe a Toil. ‘Then he his own Right hand to theirs doth join, ‘Of his sure Friendship the undoubted sign, ‘Then brings them to his House, &amp; from his Boards ‘Feasts them with what his Country best affords, ‘Whilst here they stay at Aramamets Court, ‘Hither the Neighbouring Indian Kings resort, ‘And join with them in Articles of Peace, ‘And of their Lands make firm Conveyances, ‘And being now by Deeds and Leagues Secure, ‘Their Towns they Build, their Purchas'd Land Manure. Thus far he said; Then said His Majesty, Methinks, I have a Curiosity, To know this Country, that for Ages Past, Lay hid and you have now found out at last; This New-found River, Is it Fresh and Fair? What Land adjoins to it? Has't a Pleasant Air? Learn'd Winthrop bow'd with humble Reverence, T' Express his Loyalty unto his Prince. And then these His demands to Satisfy, He with a Chearful air made this reply; ‘This Your Desire, Great Sir, bears me in mind, ‘What in the Ancient Register we find. ‘Of the first King in Jesurun from whose breast, ‘Such vast and ample thoughts themselves exprest, ‘That they have by the World been held e're since, ‘Of Truth and Wisdom clearest Evidence. ‘This mighty Man desired of his GOD ‘That he before his Lifes last Period, ‘Might be Permitted once to look upon ‘The Land, that goodly Mount and Lebanon, ‘Which his desire was thus Accomplished, ‘After his Charge was done, then he was led ‘Up to the top of Pisgah and his Eye, ‘From thence was well enabled to Discry ‘The Land of Promise in its full extent, ‘And all things in it that were Excellent. ‘Long did he Feast his hungry Eyes and gaz'd ‘Upon those Objects, until all amaz'd ‘And Ravisht with the sight thus to him given, ‘His vast Capacious Soul flew up to Heaven. ‘But thus to view fine Countrys from a far ‘Must still remain that Man's Peculiar; ‘And tho' I think, our Land is near as Good ‘As that which then was unto Moses shew'd, ‘Yet may it not from me be now expected ‘It's worth should be so amply Dissected, ‘Yet will I do my best to satisfy ‘What is Demanded by Your Majesty. ‘This gallent Stream keeps running from the Head ‘Four Hundred Miles ere it with Neptune bed, ‘Passing along hundreds of Rivolets, ‘From either bank its Christial waves besets, ‘Freely to pay their Tributes to this Stream, ‘As being Chief and Sovereign unto them, ‘It bears no torrent nor Impetuous course ‘As if 'twere driven to the Sea by force. ‘But calmly on a gentle wave doth move; ‘As if 'twere drawn to Thetis house by love. ‘The Waters Fresh and Sweet, &amp; he that swims ‘In it, Recruits and Cures his Surfeit Limbs. ‘The Fisherman the Fry with Pleasure gets, ‘With Seins, Pots, Angles, and his Tramel-nets, ‘In it Swim Salmon, Sturgion, Crap and Eels, ‘Above fly Cranes, Geese, Duck, Herons and Teals; ‘And Swans which take such Pleasure as they fly, ‘They Sing their Hymns oft long before they Dy. ‘The Grassy Banks are like a Verdant Bed, ‘With Choicest Flowers all Enameled, ‘O're which the winged Choristers do fly, ‘And Wound th' Air with wonderous Melody. ‘Here Philomel high Perch't upon a Thorn, ‘Sings chearful Hymns to the approaching Morn. ‘The Song once set, each Bird Tunes up his Lyre, ‘Responding Heavenly Musick through the quire. ‘Within these Fields, fair Banks of Violets grows; ‘And near them stand the Air Perfuming Rose, ‘And Yellow Lilies fair Enameled, ‘With Ruddy Spots here Blushing hang the Head. ‘These Meadows serve not only for the sight, ‘To Charm the Eye with wonder and delight, ‘But for their Excellent Fertility, ‘Transcends each spot that ere beheld Sol's Eye. ‘Here Lady Flora's richest Treasure grows, ‘And here she bounteously her Gifts bestows. ‘The Husband-Man for all his Diligence, ‘Receives an ample Liberal Recompence, ‘And Feasting on the Kidneys of the Wheat, ‘Doth soon his Labour and his Toil forget. ‘After the Meadows thus have took their Place, ‘The Champion Plains draw up to fill the space. ‘Fair in their Prospect, Pleasant, Fruitful, Wide, ‘Here Tellus may be seen in all his Pride. ‘Cloud kissing Pines in stately Man groves stand, ‘Firm Oaks fair Branches wide and large extend. ‘The Fir, the Box, the Balm-Tree here stand mute, ‘So do the Nut-Trees Laden down with Fruit. ‘In shady Vales the Fruitful Vine o're whelms, ‘The Weaving Branches of the bending Elms. ‘Within the Covert of these shady Boughs, ‘The Loving Turtle and his Lovely Spouse. ‘From Bough to Bough in deep Affection move, ‘And with Chast Joy reciprocate their Love. ‘At the Cool Brooks, the Beavers and the Minks ‘Keep House, and here the Hart &amp; Panther Drinks. ‘And Partridges here keep in Memory, ‘How to their Loss they soared once too high. ‘Within these Spacious Forests, Fresh &amp; Green, ‘No Monsters of Burn Africk may be seen. ‘No hissing Bassalisk stands to affright. ‘Nor Seps, nor Hemorhus with Mortal bite, ‘The Lybian Lyon n'er set Footing here, ‘Nor Tygers of Numedia do appear. ‘But here the Moose his spreading Antlers sways, ‘And bears down Stubborn standels with their sprays, ‘These sport themselves within these Woods &amp; here ‘The Fatted Roe-Buck and the Fallow Deer, ‘Yield Venison as good as that which won ‘The Partriarchial Bendiction. ‘Each Plain is bounded at its utmost Edge ‘With a long Chain of Mountains in a ridge, ‘Whose Azure tops advance themselves so high ‘They seem like pendants hanging in the Skie. ‘Twenty Four Miles, Surveyers do account ‘Between the Eastern and the Western Mount; ‘In which vast Interspace, Pleasant and Fair, ‘Zephirus Whispers a Delightful Air. ‘These Mountains stand at Equi-distant space, ‘From the fair Flood in such Majestick Grace. ‘Their looks alone are able to Inspire ‘An Active Brain with a Mercurial Fire. ‘The Muses hence their ample Dews Distil, ‘More than was Feigned from the twy topt Hill. ‘And if those Witty Men that have us told ‘Strange Tales of Mountains in the Days of Old, ‘Had they but seen how these are Elevated, ‘We should have found them far more Celebrated, ‘In the Fine Works that they have left to us, ‘Than high Olimpus or long Cancassus; ‘Or Latmos which Diana stops upon, ‘There to Salute her dear Endimion. ‘Hither the Eagles fly and lay their Eggs, ‘Then bring their Young ones forth out of those Crags ‘And force them to behold Sols Majesty, ‘In mid-noon Glory with a steady Eye. ‘Here the old Eagle his long beak belays, ‘Upon a rock till he renews his days. ‘And hence they from afar behold their Prey ‘And with a steady pinion wing their way. ‘But why so Excellent a Land should Lie, ‘So many Ages in Obscurity, ‘Unseen, Unheard of, or Unthought upon? ‘I think there's no good reason can be shown. ‘Unless 'twere as it seems the mind of Fate, ‘Your Royal Name long to perpetuate, ‘So ordered it that such a Land might owe, ‘Thanks for it's Libertys, Great Sir, to You. ‘The English Settlements when thus begun, ‘Were blest and prospered in their carrying on. ‘Churches Embody, Heaven they address, ‘For Preservation in the Wilderness. ‘The Heathen they Invite unto the Lord, ‘And teach them the good Knowledge of his word. ‘Heav'n heard their Pray'rs &amp; their Labour Crown'd, ‘With Health &amp; Peace with all their Nei'bors round. ‘Thus all Succeeded well until the Sun, ‘Had near one time his Annual Circle run, ‘When Great Sasacus rose in Impious Arms, ‘And fill'd the Land with Mischiefs and Alarms. ‘But since I've mention'd Great Sasacus Name, ‘That Day so much a Terrour where it came: ‘Let me in Prosecuting of my Story, ‘Say something of his Pride and Kingdoms Glory. ‘Of the brave Pequot Nation he was Head, ‘And with such Conduct had their Armies led, ‘That by the Power of his Martial Bands, ‘He had Subjected all the Neighbouring Lands. ‘Upon the Vanquish'd he would Exercise ‘The most Inhumane Acts of Cruelties. ‘By which, and by his often Victories, ‘He grew so dreadful to his Enemies ‘That weaponless they fell before his Feet, ‘For Pardon and Protection to Intreat. ‘Great was his Glory, greater still his Pride, ‘Much by himself and others Magnify'd. ‘He hears the English in the Eastern Parts, ‘Are of such Stoutness and Resolved Hearts, ‘That they will do no Homage to the Throne ‘Of any Sov'reign Prince, except their own. ‘This suiteth not with his Ambitious Breast, ‘He'll have their Homage too amongst the rest. ‘And Such of them as fall within his Power, ‘He like an Hungry Lion doth Devour. ‘He Norton, Stone, and Oldham, doth Surprise, ‘Then Murthers them and all their Companies; ‘Seiseth their goods, and them for Presents sends, ‘At once to Comfort and Confirm his Friends. ‘Their Death's the Massachusetts doth Resent, ‘And Endicott is with an Army sent; ‘Who tho' he Wisely did the War Pursue, ‘And did what a brave General could do: ‘Yet he return'd again without Success, ‘And Pequots kept Insulting Ne'rtheless. ‘So Great a Work, and Mighty was it found ‘To fix Your English on that distant Ground. ‘Mean while the English of that Colony, ‘On whose account I'm here in Agency, ‘Entred the River and Possess'd the same, ‘Paying no Defference to his dreadful Name. ‘This high affront the Tyrant deep Resents, ‘And Vows to Ruinate their Settlements. ‘His Priests, his Captains, and Great Men of War, ‘He calleth to Consult on this Affair, ‘Who being met, the Case to them Relates, ‘And thus the Wretch on us Recriminates. ‘My Noble Captains and Wise Counsellers, ‘You know how that of Old our Ancestors. ‘By their know Liberties and Ancient Laws, ‘Were well allow'd to Marry many Squaws. ‘Their way of Worship was to Dance and Sing, ‘By the Religious rules of Powawing. ‘Their Gods always accepted their address, ‘And Crown'd their Arms with Glorious Success. ‘Then was the Pequot name Greatly Renown'd, ‘And terrible to Neighbouring Nations round. ‘These Rules and their Estate so prosperous, ‘They handed down unblemished to us: ‘And we have been as prosperous in our days, ‘In following their long approved ways. ‘But there's of men a most Audacious Brood, ‘Lately come hither from beyond the flood, ‘Who teach us other Doctrines to believe, ‘Than ever our Fore-fathers did receive. ‘These tell the Indians they have got no Eyes, ‘But as for they themselves are very Wise. ‘They Preach there is no other God but One, ‘Him whom your Fathers Worshipt, he is none. ‘Their way of Worship was a Cursed way, ‘They serv'd the Devil in their Antick Play. ‘'Tis very like they now are all in Hell, ‘Where they in Fire &amp; Brimstone Roar &amp; Yell. ‘And you for following the steps they tread, ‘Are like enough so to be Punished. ‘Unless for what is past you soon Repent, ‘And turn you from those ways to full Intent. ‘You must not have so many handsome Wives, ‘That don't consist with Mortifyed lives. ‘And we allow no such Pluralities, ‘Therefore forsake them, pity not their Cryes. ‘The Sabbath you must keep, yea Fast and Pray, ‘And watch your Wicked hearts both Night &amp; Day. ‘And when all this is done you must complain, ‘All stands for nothing till you'r Born again. ‘Now shall we all at once be rul'd by them, ‘And so our Fathers and our Gods Contemn? ‘Shall we at once forsake our pleasant Wives, ‘That so we may live Mortified lives? ‘Shall we yield them the Empire we command, ‘And humbly wait upon them Cap in hand? ‘Or shan't we rather curb them now betimes, ‘And make them feel the folly of their crimes? ‘Speak freely. On the Honour of a Prince, ‘I'll hear as freely and without Offence. ‘Then an old Panime rose to ease his breast, ‘And thus his deep resentments he Exprest; ‘Such Horrid words such sayings Blasphemous, ‘Comes from no Tongue but the most impious. ‘All Nations yet have ever Honoured, ‘The sacred Name and Mem'ry of the dead. ‘No men till these dare ever yet despise, ‘And trample on Immortal Deities, ‘No Strangers yet; Till conquest gave them cause, ‘Dare once Prescribe to Native Princes Laws. ‘Which shews their Blasphemy and Insolence, ‘Is Great and doth Surpass all Presidents. ‘Our Laws, our Empire, and Religion too, ‘Are safely, Sir, deposited with you. ‘And you have kept them safely hitherto, ‘As 'tis your duty and your praise to do. ‘Suffer them not to keep Insulting thus, ‘Nor put such Impositions upon us. ‘But arm your Warriours, Let us try the odds, ‘'Twixt them and us, 'twixt theirs and our Gods. ‘For much I fear Impending Vengeance, ‘Will ruin us unless we drive them hence. ‘This said, One of his Chiefast Warriours rose, ‘And thus his Mind did to his Prince disclose; ‘If they are so Audacious while a few, ‘When grown a Multitude what will they Do? ‘Therefore 'tis my advice to Arm and Try, ‘The Quarrel with them in their Infancy. ‘Sure now if ever we may well Succeed, ‘Whilst Fortunate Sasacus doth us Lead: ‘Whose very Name and Martial Policy, ‘Has always Gain'd us half the Victory. ‘To what he said they all agreed as one: ‘Now is the Trumpet of Defiance blown ‘War with the English Nation is Proclaim'd. ‘(Their Priests their Martial men greatly Enflam'd) ‘A Bloody Host is sent to Say-Brook Fort, ‘To Plunder, Kill, and cut the English short. ‘Where they Arriv'd and Diverse Murthered, ‘Then round the English Fort Beleaguered. ‘Another Army Cross the Land is sent, ‘With Fire and Sword to kill the Innocent. ‘At Wethersfield they lay an Ambuscade, ‘And a sad Slaughter of the People made. ‘Others they took and them in Captive Led, ‘Unto their Forts there to be Tortured. ‘Thus from our Peace most suddenly we are ‘Wrapt up in the Calamities of War. ‘So have I sometimes in the Summer seen, ‘The Sun ascending and the Skie serene. ‘Nor Wind nor Cloud in all the Hemisphere, ‘All things in such a perfect Calmness were. ‘At length a little Cloud doth up arise, ‘To which the nitrous sulphiry Vapour flys. ‘Soon a dark mantle over Heaven spread, ‘With which the Lamp of day was darkened. ‘And now the Clouds in tempest loud contend, ‘And rain and dreadful Lightning downward send. ‘With which such loud and mighty Thunders broke ‘As made Earth tremble &amp; the Mountains smoke, ‘And the Convulsive world seem drawing on, ‘Apace to her own Dissolution ‘The awfulness of which amazing Sight, ‘Greatly did Earths Inhabitants affright. ‘Ev'n so those Halcyon days that were with us, ‘Were soon turn'd into Times Tempestuous. ‘Mischief on Mischief every day succeeds, ‘And Every Mischief Greater Mischief breeds ‘The Numerous Nations all the Country ore, ‘Who had appeared Friendly heretofore, ‘Seeing the Pequots had the War begun, ‘And well Succeeded in their carrying on. ‘Calling to mind their former Victories, ‘The English Men grew Abject in their Eyes. ‘Some at the first the Pequot Armies joyn'd ‘And all the rest but of a Wavering mind. ‘Waiting but for an opportunity, ‘To Murther us by Force or Treachery. ‘No Confidence in any we repose, ‘Our seeming Friends we find our real Foes. ‘Fears never to behold the morning Light, ‘Encumbered our Natural rest each night. ‘Nor had we place of Refuge to Repair, ‘Only to the Most High in Heaven by Prayer. ‘To whom was offered up the Sacrifice, ‘Of Broken Hearts and Penitential Cryes. ‘A Council met at Hartford who Conclude, ‘We must Subdue the Foe, or be Subdued. ‘And that the Gangreen still would further stray, ‘'Till the Infected Limb be cut away. ‘And thereupon they Ordered and Decreed, ‘To raise our utmost Forces with all Speed. ‘This Resolution publisht and declar'd, ‘Ninety brave Combatants in Arms appear'd. ‘This was the Sum of all our Infantry, ‘Yet scarce a Tithe unto the Enemy. ‘But what they wanted in their Multitude, ‘'Twas hop'd their Resolution would make Good. ‘These were the Men, this was the little Band, ‘That durst the force of the new World withstand, ‘These were the men that by their Swords made way, ‘For Peace and Safety in America. ‘And these are those whose Names fame hath Enrol'd ‘Fairly in brightest Characters of Gold. ‘The Amry now drawn up. To be their Head ‘Our Valiant Mason was Commissioned. ‘(Whose Name is never mentioned by me, ‘Without a special Note of Dignity.) ‘The Leader March't them to the River side, ‘There to Embark his Army on the Tide; ‘Where lay our little Fleet to Wait upon ‘Our Army for their Transportation ‘(Going on board Oraculous Hooker said, ‘Fear not the Foe, they shall become your Bread.) ‘'Twas here that Uncass did the Army Meet, ‘With many stout Mohegans at his Feet. ‘He to the General goes, and doth Declare, ‘He came for our Assistance in the War. ‘He was a Prince whom great Sasacus's rage ‘Had hitherto kept under Vassalage. ‘But weary of his great Severity, ‘He now Revolts, and to the English fly. ‘With Chearful Air our Captain him Embraces, ‘And him and his Chief Men with Titles Graces; ‘But over them Preserv'd a Jealous Eye, ‘Lest all this might be done in Treachery. ‘Then down the River with their Fleet they stood ‘But stranding often on the Flats and Mud. ‘Uncass Impatient of such long delays, ‘Stood forth and freely to the General says, ‘Suffer me and my Men to go on shore, ‘We are not us'd to Shipping, Sails and Oar. ‘I'l Range the Woods to find the Enemy, ‘Where they in their close Ambushments may lie. ‘And unto you at Say-Brook will repair ‘And so attend your further Orders there. ‘Consented to, they Land Immediately, ‘And Marching down soon met the Enemy: ‘And Showers of Arrows on them he bestows, ‘Swifter than ever flew from Parthian Bows. ‘At length the Pequots left the Field and Fled, ‘There Leaving many of their Fellows Dead. ‘The News of this our Forces greatly Chears, ‘And turn'd to Confidence our Jealous Fears. ‘Coming to Say-Brook, Uncass on them Waits, ‘Whose good Success our Men Congratulates. ‘Here Captain Underhill with our Army join'd ‘And being favoured with a Lucky Wind, ‘All hast on Board, and soon forsake the Shoar; ‘With the rough Winds, both Sails &amp; Tackle roar, ‘Their Oaken Oars, they in the Ocean steep, ‘And Cuss the foaming Billows of the deep. ‘Swiftly thro' Tides &amp; threatning Waves they scud, ‘Plowing the pavement of the briny Flood: ‘So fetch't about a Compass on the Sea, ‘And Landed in the Narraghansetts-Bay ‘And marching thro' that Country soon they met, ‘The Narraghansett Prince, proud Ninegrett. ‘To whom the English says, We Lead these Bands, ‘Arm'd in this manner thus into your Lands, ‘Without design to do you Injury, ‘But only to Invade the Enemy, ‘You who to the Expence of so much Blood, ‘Have long time born their evil Neighbourhood, ‘Will bid us welcom; and will well Excuse, ‘That we this way have took our Rendezvouze. ‘Quoth Ninegrett, Your War I well approve, ‘And so your March Souldiers I alway Love: ‘But sure Sasacus is unknown to you, ‘Else had you never hoped with so few, ‘One of his smallest Captains to Suppress, ‘Much less to storm him in his Fortresses. ‘Never believe it: In these Castles are, ‘Brave Captains and Couragious men of War. ‘All men have found it so that yet have try'd. ‘To whom the English thus in short reply'd; ‘Their Strength &amp; Courage doth not us affright, ‘'Tis with fuch men we use and chuse to Fight. ‘Our Army Marching unto Nayantick goes, ‘Lying just in our Progress towards the Foes. ‘The news of this our march Fame doth transport, ‘With speed to great Miaantinomohs Court. ‘Nor had that pensive King forgot the Losses, ‘He had sustain'd thro' Sasacus's Forces. ‘Chear'd with the news, his Captains all as one, ‘In humble manner do address the Throne, ‘And press the King to give them his Commission ‘To join the English in this Expedition. ‘To their request the chearful King assents, ‘And now they fill and form their Regiments, ‘To near: a Co-hort which came marching down ‘To us who lay Encamp'd before the Town. ‘Their Chiefs go to our General, and declare ‘What's their Intention and whose men they are. ‘We come, fay they, with heart and hand to join, ‘With English men upon this brave design; ‘For Pequots pride allows them no Content ‘Within the sphere of their own Government: ‘Without Essays to wrong their Brethren ‘And ravish Freedom from the Sons of men, ‘Which makes this work most needful to be done, ‘To stop their measureless Ambition. ‘But sure the War that you intend to make ‘And manage thus must come from your mistake. ‘Can these white liver'd men, &amp; but a few, ‘So much as hope the Pequots to Subdue? ‘Yes hope you may while fatal Ignorance, ‘Keeps back the knowledge of their Puissance. ‘But if you come to be Engaged once, ‘You'l Learn more with by sad Experience. ‘But happy you: who thus your selves Expose, ‘To be the Prey and Triumph of your Foes. ‘Thrice happy you to be preserved thus, ‘From your Destruction and such Deaths by us: ‘And since our Numbers and our Features show, ‘Us more, as well &amp; better men than you, ‘We hope it will offend not you nor yours, ‘The chiefest Post of Honour should be ours. ‘Mason Harrangues them with high Compliments, ‘And to confirm them he to them Consents. ‘Hold on bold Men, says he as you've began: ‘I'm Free and Easie, you shall take the Van. ‘And in this order Marching on they went ‘Towards the Enemy till the day was Spent. ‘And now Bright Phœbus had his Chariot driven, ‘Down from the Lofty Battlements of Heaven, ‘And weary put his tired steeds to rest, ‘Chearing himself on blushing Thetis breast. ‘But lest the horrid Darkness of the Night, ‘Should quite Eclipse the Glory of his light: ‘Fair Cynthia towering up did well Embrace, ‘Her Brothers light into her Orbed face. ‘The Indians still kept up their boasted flame, ‘Till near the Enemies Fortresses they came. ‘But as we always by Experience find, ‘Frost bitten Leaves will not abide the wind. ‘Hang Trembling on the limbs a while they may, ‘But when once Boreas roars they fly away, ‘To hide themselves in the deep Vales below, ‘And to his force leave the exposed bough. ‘So these who had so often to their harms, ‘Felt the great power of Sasacus's Arms, ‘And now again just to Endure the same ‘The dreadful sound of great Sasacus's Name, ‘Seem'd every Moment to attach their Ears ‘And fill'd them with such heart amazing fears, ‘That suddenly they run and seek to hide, ‘Swifter than Leaves in the Autumnal Tide. ‘The Narrhagansetts quite the Service Clear, ‘But the Mohegan followed in the Rear. ‘Our Men perceives the Allies all are gone, ‘And scarce a Pilot left to lead them on: ‘Caused an Alta, and then from the Rear, ‘Summon's up such Indians as were there. ‘At last after long waiting for the same, ‘Up Trusty Uncass and Stout Wequash came, ‘Of whom the General in strict Terms demands, ‘Where stands the Fort, &amp; how their Judgment stands, ‘About the Enter-prise? And what's the Cause, ‘They left their Post against all Martial Laws? ‘To which we had this Answer from a Prince, ‘The Enemies Fort stands on yond Eminence; ‘Whose steep Ascent is now before your Eyes: ‘And for my Judgment in the enterprize, ‘Fain would my willing Heart hope for Success, ‘Fain would my eager Tongue such hopes express. ‘But Knowledge of the Foe such hope deny's, ‘And Sinks my Heart in deep Despondencies. ‘You cannot know the Danger of your case, ‘Not having yet beheld a Pequots Face. ‘But sad Experience hath Instructed me, ‘How Dreadful and Invincible they be. ‘What mighty Battles often have they won, ‘And cut down Armies like the Grass that's Mown. ‘And my Heart rues this day because I fear, ‘Those Lions will your Lambs in pieces tear. ‘When once they are Engag'd, 'tis hard to get, ‘A Dispensation from them to Retreat. ‘Sir, be Advis'd before it be too late, ‘Trust not too far your Evil-boding Fate. ‘Great pity tis to lose so brave an Host; ‘And more that such a General shoud be lost. ‘Then steer another course: thrust not your selves ‘To certain ruin on these dangerous shelves: ‘Here stop't, and on the English fix'd his Eye, ‘With care Expecting what they would reply. ‘Brave Mason who had in his breast Enshrin'd, ‘A Prudent and Invulnerable mind; ‘Weighing the case &amp; ground whereon they stood, ‘The Enemy how hard to be subdu'd: ‘How if the Field should by the Foe be won, ‘The English Settlements might be Undone. ‘His little Army now was left alone, ‘And all the Allies Hopes and Hearts were gone. ‘These and all other things that might Disswade, ‘From an Engagement having fully weigh'd: ‘But looking on his Chearful Soldiery, ‘True Sons of Mars, bred up in Brittany; ‘Each firmly bent to Glorify his Name ‘By Dying bravely in the Bed of Fame, ‘In his New Countrys Just Defence, or else ‘To Extirpate these Murtherous Infidels; ‘This rais'd his Tho'ts his Vital Spirits Clear'd, ‘So that no Enemy on Earth he Fear'd. ‘And now resolv'd the City to Invade; ‘He to the tho'tful Prince this Answer made; ‘You say, My Men han't yet a Pequot seen; ‘Tis true, yet they e're now in Wars have been, ‘Where mighty Captains &amp; brave Men have shed, ‘Their Blood, while roaring Canons Ecchoed, ‘Yet they Undaunted Resolute go on ‘Where dying springs make Sanguine Rivers run. ‘Out-braving Danger mount the highest Wall, ‘Yea Play with Death it self without appal: ‘Nor turn the Back till they have won the Day, ‘And from the mighty torn the Spoils away. ‘And do you think that any Pequots face ‘Shall daunt us much, or alter much the case? ‘The Valour of our Foes we always prize, ‘As that which most our Triumph Glorifies. ‘Their Strength &amp; Courage but allurements are, ‘To make us more Ambitious of the War. ‘Then don't Despair, but turn you back again ‘Encourag'd, &amp; Confirm your Heartless Men, ‘And hinder them in their Intended Flight; ‘Only to see how English Men will Fight ‘And let your Eyes themselves be Judges then ‘'Twixt Us &amp; Pequots, which are better Men. ‘Down bow'd the Prince, down bow'd this trembling 'Squire; ‘Greatly the Gen'rals Courage they Admire. ‘Back to the Rear, with speedy hast they went, ‘And call the Captains of their Regiment; ‘To whom the Prince doth in short terms declare, ‘English or Pequots must go and hunt white Deer. ‘No Counsel can the General's wrath asswage, ‘Nor calm the fury of his Martial rage. ‘His men are all resolved to go on, ‘Unto the Pequots Ruin, or their own: ‘Then we our selves will stand in sight and see ‘The last Conclusion of this Tragedie. ‘Mean while the General his Oration makes, ‘And with his Army thus Expostulates; ‘There's such a Crisis now in Providence, ‘As scarce has been since time did first Commence. ‘Fate has determin'd that this very Day, ‘Shall try the Title of America: ‘And that these hands of ours shall be the hands, ‘That shall subdue or forfeit all these Lands. ‘If this days work by us be once well done, ‘America is for the English won: ‘But if we faint and fail in this design, ‘The numerous Nations will as one combine, ‘Their Countries Forces and with Violence ‘Destroy the English and their Settlements. ‘Here we are Strangers, and if we are beat, ‘We have no place for Safety or Retreat. ‘Therefore our Hands must be Preservatives, ‘Of our Religion, Liberties and Lives. ‘I urge not this as Motives from Despair, ‘To which I know you utter Strangers are. ‘Only to shew what great Advantages, ‘Attends your Valour urging the Success. ‘Mov'd with Despair the coward Fights &amp; Storms, ‘But your brave Minds have more Angelick forms ‘Your high born Souls in Brighter orbs do move ‘And take in fair Ideas from Above. ‘Minding the Laurels that the Victor wears, ‘And great Example of your Ancestors. ‘I know you can't their Mighty acts forget, ‘And yet how often did they them repeat? ‘What did that ever famous Black Prince do, ‘At first at Cressey, after at Poictou? ‘Bravely he led the English Squadrons on, ‘Bravely they Fought till they had took King John. ‘Bravely he did his Fathers Message bear, ‘To save his Life and Honour in the War. ‘For in that Fight he rais'd the English Fame, ‘Above the Grecian or the Roman Name. ‘And with what Force and Martial Puissance. ‘Did great King Henry claim the Crown of France ‘He like a Gamester play'd his tennis Balls, ‘Like Bolts of Thunder over Paris Walls. ‘How Lion-like he led his British Bands, ‘Tho' few in number through the Gallick Lands. ‘To Agin-Court, then Fac'd his mighty Foe, ‘And gave his Multitude the overthrow; ‘Where e're his Generals came they did Advance ‘The English Ensigns on the Towers of France; ‘Until that Nation rendered up to him ‘Their Heiress and Imperial Diadem. ‘And when of late King Philip did Attempt, ‘Quite to Subvert the British Government; ‘And for that end sent out his mighty Fleet, ‘Whom Howards, Seymore, &amp; bold Drake did meet, ‘And meeting took or sunk into the main ‘The wealth, the hope, the power &amp; pride of Spain. ‘By such Exploits, the English Glory went ‘Throughout from Britain to the Orient: ‘And there too soon 'twas bounded by the Seas ‘And limited from the Antipodies. ‘Nought of their worth in the new world was told, ‘Nor more could be expressed in the Old. ‘Then Fame it self dull and inactive grew ‘For want of other Business to Pursue. ‘But Fate which long hath Destinated you, ‘To prove the Stories of th' old World i' th' New, ‘Shipt you on Board &amp; with full gales hath sent ‘You forth from Britain to this Continent; ‘And by this Foe gives Opportunity ‘Here to evince the English Bravery. ‘And give the World Assurance that we be, ‘Sons of those mighty Men of Britannie. ‘'Tis true, our Enemies are hard to tame, ‘The more the Danger is the more's the Fame. ‘But they are Strong, Immur'd, a Multitude: ‘The more's the Honour when they are Subdu'd. ‘But they are Valiant, us'd to overthrow, ‘What Glory 'tis to Conquer such a Foe? ‘Their very Name hath made our Allies run, ‘Oh how will this adorn the Field when won! ‘Leave the Success to Him whose boundless Powers ‘Will doubtless bless so just a War as ours. ‘Then let's not give the sence of Danger place, ‘But Storm the Enemies Fortress in the face. ‘So shall the Line of your high Praises run ‘The same in time and Circle with the Sun: ‘And Happy Albeon shall for ever Glory, ‘Her distant Sons did here make good her Story. ‘No more he said, then thro' the Regiment ‘Was heard a softly Murmur of Consent. ‘Amen, Our Forces said, and then on high ‘To the Worlds Arbiter, lift up their Eye, ‘And with an Humble Air of Earnestness ‘Unto His Majesty made this Address, ‘O Most Divine Eternal Majesty, ‘Whose Thrones Exalted far above the Sky; ‘Where thou by spotless Spirits art Ador'd, ‘As their, and our and every things Great Lord. ‘Yea so Exalted is thy Majesty, ‘So Infinite is thy Divinity: ‘That what their best and utmost Praises be, ‘Once to behold is Humbleness in thee, ‘Yet albeit thou art Exalted so, ‘Thou hast a kind Respect unto the Low: ‘And from thy most Exalted Stations there, ‘Viewest what's Acting on thy Footstool here. ‘Thou in thy Word dost oft' and oft' declare, ‘Thy Peoples Good is thine Especial Care. ‘And hast more often in thy Providence, ‘Made good that Word in their Deliverence: ‘So that their Motto hitherto hath been, ‘In the Mount of the Lord it shall be seen. ‘Look down from thy Immense Sublimities, ‘To view our Troubles and to hear our Cries. ‘Our Eyes are unto thee who canst Subdue ‘A Multitude, and Victors make a few. ‘Mind Lord, it was thy Power and Right-hand ‘Hath bro't us to and set us in this Land. ‘'Twas for thy Sake that we left Britannie, ‘And our Enjoyments there; Here to have thee. ‘But how the Heathen Rage, and how their Kings ‘Against thee, and thy Christ speak Evil things? ‘For sure the Truth of their Intentions be, ‘By Driving us from hence to Banish Thee. ‘If thou art Silent and allow'st the same, ‘What wilt thou do unto thy Dreadful Name? ‘Thy Promise to thy Son hast thou forgot, ‘That thou wilt give the Heathen for his Lot: ‘And of the Earth the utmost parts thereon ‘To be to Him for His Possession. ‘We hop'd of this to've seen th' Accomplishment, ‘Yea and ourselves to help on the Event. ‘Then Lord arise and to our help incline, ‘And shout as mighty Men shout after Wine. ‘Let the Proud Dwellers of the Nations see ‘There's none that is Invincible but thee. ‘So shall the Wrath of Man Honour thy Name, ‘And this shall their remaining Wrath restrain: ‘And this thy Peoples Thankful Hearts shall raise ‘To Celebrate thy Name with endless Praise. ‘After Devotions thus to Heaven Paid, ‘Up to the Enemy Our Armys led, ‘As silent as the Riphean Snow doth fall, ‘Or Fishes walk in Neptunes spacious Hall. ‘Now Lucifer had just put out his Head, ‘To call Aurora from old Tithon's bed. ‘Whereat the Troops of the Approaching light, ‘Began to beat the Reg'ments of the Night. ‘But Morpheus with his unperceived Bands, ‘Had closed the Pequots Eyes &amp; chain'd their Hands. ‘All Slept secure save one Sagacious Wretch, ‘Whose turn it was to stand upon the Watch. ‘His weighty Charge with Diligence he applies, ‘And Looking round with fierce, Lyncean Eyes. ‘At Length our Avant Couriers he Espy'd, ‘Straining his Lungs aloud, Auwunux Cry'd. (Auwunux, said our King, What doth that mean? It signifys, said Winthrop, English Men) ‘The startling News doth every Souldier rouse, ‘Each Arms and Hastens to his Rendezvouze. ‘Mean time the English did the Fort Attach, ‘And in the same had opened a Breach. ‘Through which our brave Aleides Entred first, ‘In after whom his valiant Souldiers thrust. ‘Before the breach an Unappalled band, ‘Of Warlike Pequots with in bright Armour stand. ‘With Chearful Accents these themselves Confirm ‘To dy like Men or to outface the Storm. ‘Then Gallantly the English they assail, ‘With winged Arrows like a shower of Hail ‘These ours Endure; and with like Violence, ‘Sent Lead and Sulphur back in Recompence. ‘And now the fight grew more &amp; more Intense, ‘Each violent Death Enflames the Violence. ‘Charge answered Charge, &amp; shout reply'd to shout ‘Both parties like Enraged fury's fought. ‘Till Death in all its horrid Forms appears, ‘And Dreadful Noise keeps Clamouring in our Ears. ‘Now as some Spacious Rivers in their way, ‘By which they Travel onwards to the Sea. ‘Meet with some mighty Precipice from whence, ‘Enrag'd they throw themselves with Violence. ‘Upon the Stubborn Rocks that ly below, ‘To make Disturbance in the way they go. ‘Here tho' the Fury of the fray doth make ‘The near Adjacent Rocks &amp; Mountains quake. ‘Still the Remorsless Stream keep on its course, ‘Nor will abate a Moment of its force, ‘But rather hastens by Impetuous Facts ‘To throw itself into those Cataracts. ‘And so it happened with our Soldiers here, ‘Whose Fortune 'twas to Travel in the rear. ‘The Combatings of these within the Breaches, ‘With Dreadful noise their listening Ears Attaches, ‘And from their Foes and from their Bretheren, ‘Loud Crys of Fighting and of Dying Men. ‘Sense of the Danger doth not them Affright, ‘But rather proves a Motive to excite, ‘The Martial Flame in every Soldiers Breast, ‘And on they like enraged Lyons prest. ‘Determined upon the spot to Dy, ‘Or from the Foe obtain the Victory. ‘Now Fortune shews to the beholders sight, ‘A very Dreadful, yet a Doubtful Fight. ‘Whilst Mighty Men born in far Distant Land, ‘Stood Foot to Foot engaging Hand to Hand. ‘As when some Mighty Tempest that arise, ‘Meet with Imbattled Fury in the Skies: ‘Fire balls of Lightnings &amp; loud Thunders Rend, ‘And Tear the Raging parly's that contend. ‘So did the Fury of these mighty Foes, ‘With which they did each others force oppose, ‘Bring on such ruins as might daunt with fears, ‘The Hearts of any Men; Excepting Theirs. ‘Never did Pequots fight with greater Pride: ‘Never was English Valour Better try'd. ‘Never was Ground soak't with more Gallant blood ‘Than the Aceldama whereon we stood. ‘Sometimes one Party Victory soon Expect, ‘As soon their eager Hopes are Counterchect. ‘And those that seem'd as Conquered before, ‘Repel with greater force the Conqueror. ‘Three times the Pequots seemed to be beat: ‘As many times they made their Foes retreat. ‘And now our hope and help for Victory, ‘Chiefly Depended from the Arm on High, ‘As when Euroclydon the forest rends, ‘The bigger Oaks fall down the Lesser bends; ‘The beaten Limbs and Leaves before him scour, ‘Affrighted and Enforced by his Power; ‘To some huge Rock whose Adamantine brow, ‘Out braves the Fury of all Winds that blow; ‘There hoping to be hid from the high Charge, ‘Of Fierce pursuers by his Mighty Verge. ‘The Winds in pressing troops Demand Surrender, ‘Of the pursued &amp; boisterous Storm &amp; Thunder: ‘But he brow-beats, and Masters all their pride, ‘And sends them roaring to the Larbord side. ‘So Mason here most strongly Drest in arms, ‘Re-animates his men, their Ranks Reforms, ‘Then Leading on thro' Deaths &amp; Dangers goes, ‘And beats the thickest Squadrons of the foes. ‘Prince Mononotto sees his Squadrons fly, ‘And on our General having fixt his Eye. ‘Rage and Revenge his Spirits quickening, ‘He set a Mortal Arrow on the String. ‘Then to his God and Fathers Ghosts he pray'd, ‘Hear, O Immortal Powers, hear me, he said; ‘And pity Mistick, Save the tottering Town, ‘And on our Foes hurl dreadful Vengeance down. ‘Will you forsake your Altars and abodes, ‘To those Contemners of Immortal God's? ‘Will those Pay Hecatombs unto your shrine, ‘Who have deny'd your Powers to be Divine? ‘O favour us; our hopes on you are Built ‘But if you Mindful of our former guilt, ‘Determine final ruin on us all; ‘Yet let us not quite unrevenged fall. ‘Here I Devote this of our Enemies ‘His precious Life to you a Sacrifice. ‘Nor shall I Covet long to be Alive, ‘If such a Mischief I might once Survive. ‘But O Indulgent, Hearken to my Prayer; ‘Try us once more; this once the City spare: ‘And take my Gift, Let your acceptance be ‘An Omen we shall gain the Victory. ‘That very Instant Mason did Advance, ‘Whereat rage Interrupts his utterance; ‘Nor could he add a Word to what was said, ‘But drew the winged Arrow to the Head: ‘And aiming right Discharged it, whereupon ‘Its Fury made the Pierced Air to Groan. ‘But wary Mason with his active Spear, ‘Glanc'd the Princes Arrow in the Air: ‘Whereat the Pequots quite Discouraged. ‘Throw down the Gauntlet &amp; from Battel fled. ‘Mason swift as the chased Roe on Foot, ‘Out strips the rest in making the Pursuit: ‘Entring the Palace in a Hall he found, ‘A Multitude of Foes, who gathering round ‘This mighty Man on every side Engag'd ‘Like Bears bereav'd of their Whelps enrag'd. ‘One finding such Resistance where he came, ‘His Mind, his Weapons &amp; his Eyes stroke Flame. ‘Their Boldness much his martial sprite Provokes, ‘And round he lays his deep inveterate strokes. ‘Making his Sword at each enforced blow ‘Send great Soul'd Heroes to the shades below. ‘But as when Hercules did undertake, ‘A doubtful Combate with the Lernian Snake; ‘Fondly propos'd if he cut off her Head, ‘The Monster might with ease be Vanquished: ‘But when he the Experiment did make, ‘Soon to his hazard found his dear mistake; ‘And that as often as he cut off one, ‘Another Instantly sprang in its room. ‘So here, tho' Mason laid so many Dead, ‘Their number seemed not Diminished; ‘And Death the Umpire of this Martial Fray, ‘Stood yet expecting Mason for his Prey. ‘But Fate that doth the rule of Actions know, ‘Did this unequal Combate Disallow. ‘As too severe to force one Man alone, ‘To Beat an Army, take a Garrison: ‘Or if he failed in the Enterprize, ‘To fall a Victim to his Enemies; ‘Sent Heydon in, who with his sure Steel'd Blade, ‘Joining the General such a Slaughter made, ‘That soon the Pequots ceased to Oppose, ‘The Matchless force of such Resistless Foes. ‘After so many Deaths and Dangers past, ‘Mason was thorowly Enflamed at last: ‘He Snatcht a blazing Bavin with his Hand, ‘And Fir'd the stately Palace with the Brand. ‘And soon the towring &amp; Rapacious Flame, ‘All hope of Opposition overcame. ‘Eurus and Notus readily Subjoin, ‘Their best Assistance to this great Design; ‘Drive Pitchy Flames in vast enfoldings down, ‘And dreadful Globes of Fire along the Town. ‘And now the English Army Marched out, ‘To Hemn this Flaming City round about; ‘That such as strived to escape the Fire, ‘Might by the Fury of their Arms Expire. ‘But O what Language or what Tongue can tell, ‘This dreadful Emblem of the flames of Hell? ‘No Fantasie sufficient is to Dream, ‘A Faint Idea of their Woes Extream. ‘Some like unlucky Comets do appear, ‘Rushing along the Streets with flagrant hair: ‘Some seeking safety Clamber up the wall, ‘Then down again with Blazing fingers Fall. ‘In this last Hour of Extremity, ‘Friends and Relations met in Company; ‘But all in vain their tender Sympathy, ‘Cannot allay but makes their Misery. ‘The Paramour here met his amourous Dame, ‘Whose eyes had often set his heart in flame: ‘Urg'd with the Motives of her Love and Fear, ‘She runs and Clasps her arms about her Dear: ‘Where weeping on his bosom as she Lies, ‘And Languisheth on him she sets her Eyes; ‘Till those bright Lamps do with her life Expire, ‘And Leave him Weltering in a double fire. ‘The Fair &amp; Beauteous Bride with all her Charms, ‘This night lay Melting in her Bridegrooms arms. ‘This Morning in his bosom yields her Life, ‘While he dyes Sympathizing with his Wife. ‘In Love relation and in Life the same, ‘The same in Death, both dy in the same Flame, ‘Their Souls united both at once repair, ‘Unto their place appointed thro' the air. ‘The Gracious Father here stood looking on, ‘His little Brood with deep affection, ‘They round about him at each quarter stands, ‘With piteous looks, Each lifts his little Hands ‘To him for shelter, and then nearer throng, ‘Whilst piercing Cries for help flows from each Tongue, ‘Fain would he give their miseries relief; ‘Tho' with the forfeiture of his own life: ‘But finds his power too short to shield off harms, ‘The torturing flame Arrests them in his arms. ‘The tender Mother with like Woes opprest, ‘Beholds her Infant frying at her breast; ‘Crying and looking on her, as it fryes; ‘Till Death shuts up its heart affecting Eyes. ‘The Conquering flame long Sorrows doth prevent, ‘And Bankrupt Life soon breaks Imprisonment, ‘Souls leave their Tenements gone to decay, ‘And fly untouched through the flames away. ‘Now all with speed to final ruin hast, ‘And soon this Tragick scene is overpast. ‘The Town its Wealth high Battlements &amp; Spires, ‘Now Sinketh Weltring in conjoining Fires. ‘MASON Commands the Officers with speed, ‘To see his Men drawn up and Martialed, ‘Which being done, they Wheel about their Ranks, ‘And Humbly Kneeling down to Heav'n all gave Thanks. ‘By this Aurora doth with Gold adorn, ‘The ever Beauteous Eylids of the Morn; ‘And Burning Titan his Exhaustless rays, ‘Bright in the Eastern Horrizon Displays: ‘Then soon Appearing in Majestick Aw, ‘Makes all the starry Deitys withdraw; ‘Veiling their Faces in deep Reverence, ‘Before the Throne of his Magnificence. ‘And now the English their Red Cross Display, ‘And under it march bravely toward the Sea; ‘There hoping in this needful Hour to meet, ‘Ample Provisions coming with the Fleet. ‘Mean time came Tidings to Sasacus's Ears, ‘That Mistick-Town was taken unawares. ‘Three Hundred of his Able Men he sent, ‘With utmost hast its ruin to Prevent: ‘But if for that they chance to come too late, ‘Like Harms on us they should Retaliate. ‘These with loud Out-crys met us coming down ‘The Hill, about three furlongs from the Town; ‘Gave us a Skirmish and then turn'd to gaze, ‘Upon the ruin'd City yet on blaze. ‘But when they saw this Doleful Tragedy, ‘The Sorrow of their Hearts did close their Eye: ‘Silent &amp; Mute they stand yet breathe out Grones; ‘Nor Gorgons Head like this transforms to Stones. ‘Here lay the Numerous Body's of the Dead; ‘Some Frying, others almost Calcined: ‘All dolefully Imprison'd Underneath ‘The Dark and Adamantine Bars of Death. ‘But mighty Sorrows never are Content ‘Long to be kept in close Imprisonment, ‘When once grown desperate will not keep under, ‘But break all Bands of their restraint asunder. ‘And now with Shrieks the Ecchoing Air they Wound, ‘And Stampt &amp; Tore &amp; Curst the Suffering Ground. ‘Some with their hansts tore off their Guiltless Hair, ‘And throw up dust &amp; cinder in the Air ‘Thus with strange Actions &amp; Horrendous Cries, ‘They Celebrate these Doleful Obsequies ‘At length Revenge so Vehemently doth Burn, ‘As caused all other Passions to adjourn. ‘Alecto raves and rates them in the ear, ‘O Senseless Cowards to stand blubbering here! ‘Will Tears revive these Body's of the Slain, ‘Or bring their Ashes Back to Life again, ‘Will Tears Appease their mighty Ghosts that are, ‘Hoping to be Revenged, hovering here? ‘Surely expecting you will Sacrifice, ‘To them the Lives of those their Enemies: ‘And will you Baffle them thus by delay, ‘Until the Enemy be gone away? ‘O Cursed Negligence! And then she Strips, ‘And Jerks &amp; Stings them with her Scorpion Whips; ‘Until with Anger &amp; Revenge they Yell, ‘As if the very Fiends had broke up Hell. ‘That we shall Dy, they all Outragous Swear; ‘And Vomit Imprecations in the Air; ‘Then, full speed! with Ejulations Loud, ‘They follow us like an Impetuous Cloud. ‘Mason to stop their Violent Career, ‘Rally's his Company a New to War; ‘Who finding them within a little space, ‘Let fly his Blunder-busses in their Face. ‘Thick Sulphurous Smoke maketh the Sky look black, ‘And Heaven's high Galleries Thunder with the crack, ‘Earth Grones &amp; Trembles &amp; from underneath, ‘Deep Vaulted Caverns horrid Eccho's Breathe. ‘The Bolts that this first clap of Thunder shed, ‘Strook down their Stout File-leaders Dead. ‘To see them fall a Stupifying Fear, ‘Surpris'd and Stopt their Soldiers in the Rear: ‘The numerous Natives stopt, and fac'd about; ‘Whereat the Conquering English gave a shout. ‘At which they start &amp; through the Forrest Scour, ‘Like Trembling Hinds that hear the Lions roar. ‘Back to great Sasacus they return again; ‘And of their Loss they thus aloud Complain, ‘Sir, 'tis in Vain to Fight: The Fates Engage, ‘Themselves for those with whom this War we Wage. ‘We Mistick saw, &amp; 'twas an Awful Sight; ‘As Dreadful are our Enemies in Fight: ‘And the loud Thunderings that their Arms did make, ‘Made Us, the Earth, yea Heaven itself to shake. ‘Very unwelcome to Sasacus's Ears, ‘Were these Misfortunes and his Subjects Fears: ‘Yet to his Men, the English he Contemns, ‘And Threats to ruin us with Stratagems. ‘And now his tho'ts Ten Thousand ways Divide, ‘And swift through all Imaginations Glide. ‘Endless Projections in his Head he lays, ‘Deep Policies and Stratagems he Weighs. ‘Sometimes he thinks, he'll thus the War maintain, ‘Reviews the Scheme &amp; throws it by again: ‘Now thus, or thus, Concludes tis best to do; ‘But neither thus, nor thus, on the Review. ‘And thus his mind on endless Projects Wanders, ‘Till he is lost in Intricate Meanders. ‘At last gives up the Case as Desperate, ‘And Sinks, Bewailing his Forlorn Estate. ‘He and his People quite Discouraged, ‘Now leave their Seats, &amp; towards Monhattons fled. ‘But in his way the English sword o're takes ‘His Camp, and in it sad Massakers makes. ‘Yet he Escap'd and to the Mohawks goes, ‘Where he to them keeps Reckoning up his woes: ‘And they to cure the Passions of his breast, ‘Cut off his Head, and all his Cares releas'd. ‘Thus great Sasacus! and his Kingdom fell, ‘Who in their time so greatly did Excel. ‘So frail and full of Mutabilities, ‘Are all Times Adjuncts, underneath the Skies. ‘Since this fair Towns have spread the Conntry o're, ‘Both on the River and along the Shore: ‘All which with English names Your Subjects stile, ‘In dear remembrance of our Parent Isle. ‘The Land thus either Purchas'd, or Subdu'd, ‘'Twas our Intent then Early to have sued, ‘Unto the Throne, where your Illustr'ous Father sate, ‘That he would Graciously Incorporate ‘Us, by his Charter, with such Liberty, ‘As I Petition from Your Majesty. ‘But soon those Cloudy Days of Wo came on, ‘(Ripen'd for Ruin and Destruction) ‘Wherein the Subjects in Rebellion rose, ‘Drowning their Soveraign &amp; Themselves in woes. ‘'Till nothing could Appease the Multitude, ‘Less than that Blessed Martyrs Royal Blood. ‘Nor yet Content; Their Rage Inveterate, ‘Together with his Life Seise on the State. ‘Neither could that Extinct the hateful Flame, ‘Without Endeavours to destroy his name. ‘And all his race to ruin to Consigne, ‘For being Branches of the Royal Line. ‘But here my Tongue does falter, Spirits sink, ‘And my Heart bursts asunder once to think, ‘That such a King the Glory of his age, ‘Should fall a victim to the Popular Rage. ‘And that such Miserys should fall on them, ‘That were Descendants of the Royal Stem. ‘But God who dwelleth in Approachless light, ‘And whose wise counsel doth surpass our sight, ‘As far as Heaven doth the Earth in height, ‘In his Un-erring Counsel Infinite. ‘Covers sometimes the Footstool of his Throne, ‘And makes thick Darkness his Pavilion. ‘And as we fondly Guess by the Event, ‘Laughs at the Tryal of the Innocent. ‘Yet He by Ways and Means that seem to us, ‘The clean Contrary and Preposterous. ‘Bringeth about the Good He did Decree, ‘In His wise Counsel from Eternity. ‘He having set His Love Transcendantly, ‘Upon your Father from Eternity. ‘The Restlest Motions of his constant Love, ‘Ne'er ceast to Act but in his Interest strove. ‘That he should be Prepar'd to sit on High, ‘In some Especial seat of Dignity. ‘Surely 'twas this that led him to and fro, ‘Along those Pathless Labyrinths of Wo, ‘And made his Life as 'twere a Tragedie, ‘Concluding in that sad Catastrophe. ‘Being thus Conformed to the King of Kings, ‘Who was made Perfect thorow Sufferings. ‘He took him from his Kingdom Transitory, ‘And set him on a throne of Endless Glory. ‘And then to shew the Good he did design, ‘Unto that Blessed Martyrs Royal Line. ‘Accomplished your Happy Restauration, ‘And set you safely on your Fathers Throne. ‘From whence your liberal Hand doth freely pour, ‘Most Royal Bounty's like an Heavenly shower. ‘Distilling on the Grass that's newly Mown, ‘And we your Supplyants before the Throne, ‘Beg leave to hope while all your Favours Tast, ‘Connecticut will not be overpast. Great Charles who gave attention all the while, Looking on Winthrop with a Royal Smile, Until that of his Fathers woes he speaks, Which drew the Christal Rivers down his Cheeks. But seeing Winthrop his Address had clos'd, The King his Mind and Countenance Compos'd And with as bright an Air of Majesty, As Phœbus shews when he Serenes the Sky, Made this Resolve upon the Agency, Be it so then, and WE OUR SELF Decree, CONNECTICUT shall be a COLONY: Enfranchis'd with such Ample Liberties As thou, Their Friend, shalt best for them Devise; And farther know Our Royal Pleasure thus; And so it is Determined by US; Chief in the Patent Winthrop Thou shalt stand, And Valiant Mason next at thy Right Hand. And for Chief Senators end Patentees, Take Men of Wealth and known Abilities; Men of Estates and Men of Influence, Friends to their Country and to US their Prince. And may the People of that Happy Place Whom thou hast so Endeared to My Grace; Till times last Exit, through Succeeding Ages, Be Blest with Happy English Privileges. And that they may be so, bear thou from hence To them these Premonitions from their Prince. First, Let all Officers in Civil Trust, Always Espouse their Countrys Interest. Let Law and Right be Precious in their Eyes, And hear the Poor Mans Cause when e're he Crys. Preserve Religion Pure and Understand, That is the Firmest Pillar of a Land: Let it be kept in Credit in the Court, And never fail for want of due Support. And let the Sacred Order of the Gown, With Zeal apply the Business that's their own. So Peace may Spring from th' Earth &amp; Righteousness, Look down from Heaven, Truth and Judgment Kiss. Then, Let the Freemen of your Corporation, Always beware of the Insinuation, Of those which always Brood Complaint and Fear, Such Plagues are Dangerous to Infect the Air: Such Men are Over-Laden with Compassion, Having Mens Freedom in such Admiration: That every Act of Order or Restraint They'll Represent as matter of Complaint. And this is no New Doctrine, 'tis a Rule Was taught in Satans first Erected School. It serv'd his turn with wonderful Success, And ever since has been his Master-piece. 'Tis true the sleight by which that field he won, Was argued from man's benefit alone. But these outdo him in that way of Evil, And will sometimes for God's sake play the Devil. And Lastly, Let Your New English Multitude, Remember well a bond of Gratitude Will Lye on them and their Posterity To bear in mind their Freedom came by Thee. FINIS.</field>
