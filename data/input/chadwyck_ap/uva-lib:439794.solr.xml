      <field name="fulltext">DEDICATORY SONNET TO EDWIN P. WHIPPLE, ESQ., OF BOSTON. O Friend! between us, for long dreary years, Distance and Fate have raised their barriers strong; Yet Love, surviving, takes the wings of Song, And flies to greet thee; whatsoe'er appears Of false or feeble in these various lays, Forgive; the heart is in them, and to thee The lowliest strains of true sincerity Rise like the music of a voice of praise. Though thou hast searched the souls of greatest Seers, Shakespeare, and Spencer, Sidney,âto the core Of their deep natures probing o'er and o'er,â Still not the less to humbler bards are given Thy faith and homage,âfor the Poet's lore, Or great or small, is knowledge caught from Heaven! AVOLIOâA LEGEND OF THE ISLAND OF COS. What time the Norman ruled in Sicily At that mild season when the vernal sea Is ruffled only by the zephyrs gay, A goodly ship set sail upon her way From Ceos unto Smyrna; through the calm She passed by sunny islands crowned with palm, Until, so witching tender was the breeze, So drugged the hours with balms of slumb'rous case, That they who manned her, in the genial air And dalliance of the time, forgot the care Due to her courses; in the warm sunshine They lay enchanted, dreaming dreams divine, Whilst drifting heedless on the halcyon water The bark obeyed whatever currents caught her. Borne onward thus for many a charmÃ©d day, They reach at length a wide and wooded bay, The haunt of birds, whose purpling wings, in flight, Made even the gold-hued morning seem more bright, Flushed as with darting rainbows; through the tide By the o'erripe pomegranate juices dyed, And laving boughs of the wild fig, and grape, Great shoals of dazzling fishes madly ape The play of silver lightnings in the deep Translucent pools; the crew awoke from sleep, Or, rather, that strange trance which on them pressed Gently as sleep; yet still they seemed to rest, Fanned by voluptuous gales, by Morphean languors blessed. The shore sloped upward into foliaged hills Cleft by the channels of a maze of rills That sent their clarion voices clear, and loud, Up to the answering eagle in the cloud; Green vales there were between, and pleasant lawns Thick-set with blooms, like sheen of tropic dawns Brightening the Orient; further still, the glades Of murmurous forests flecked with golden shades Stretched glimmering southward; on the woods' far rim, Faintly discerned through veiling vapors, dim As mists of Indian summer, the wide view Was clasped by mountains flickering in the blue And hazy distance;âover all there hung The morn's eternal beauty calm and young. Amidst the throng that gazed with wondering faces On that fair Eden, and its fairy graces, Was oneâAvolioâa brave youth of Florence, Self-exiled from his country, in abhorrence Of the base, blood-stained tyrants dominant there;â A gentleman he was, of gracious air, And liberal as the summer, skilled in lore Of arms, and chivalry, and many more Deep sciences, which others left unlearned. He loved adventure; how his spirit burned Within him, when, as now, a chance arose To search untravelled forests, and strange foes Vanquish by pÃºissance of knightly blows, Or, rescue maidens from malignant spells Enforced by hordes of wizard sentinels: So, in the ardor of his martial glee He clapped his hands, and shouted suddenly: âHo! Sirs! a challenge! let us pierce these woods Down to the core; explore the solitudes, And make this flowery empire all our own; Who knows but we may conquer us a throne? At least, bold feats await us, grand emprise To win us favor in our ladies' eyes;â By Heaven! he is a coward who delays!â So saying, all his countenance ablaze With fiery zeal, the youth sprang lightly up, And with right lusty motion filled a cup (They brought him straightway) to the glistening brim With Cyprus wine:ââNow glory unto him Whom, bent on gallant deeds, no danger daunts, Whose constant soul a constant impulse haunts Which spurs him onward, onward, to the end; Pledge we the Brave! and may St. Ermo send Success to crown our valiantest!â this said, Avolio shoreward leaped, and with him led The whole ship's company. A motley band Were they who mustered; 'round him on the strand, Mixed knights, and traders; the first, fired for toil Which promised glory; the last, hotâfor spoil. Through breezy paths, and beds of blossoming thyme Kept fresh by secret springs, the showery chime Of whose clear falling waters in the dells, Played like an airy peal of elfin bells, With eager minds, but aimless, idle feet, (The scene about them was so lone, and sweet, It spelled their steps), 'mid labyrinths of flowers, By mossy streams, and in deep shadowed bowers, They strayed from charm to charm through lengths of languid hours. In thickets of wild fern and rustling broom, The humble-bee buzzed past them with a boom Of insect thunder, and in glens afar The golden fire-fly, a small, animate star, Shone from the twilight of the darkling leaves. High noon it was, but dusk, like mellow eve's, Reigned in the wood's deep places, whence it seemed That flushing locks, and quick arch glances gleamed, From eyes scarce human; thus the fancy deemed Of those most given to marvels; the rest laughed A merry jeering laugh, and many a shaft Launched from the Norman cross-bow pierced the nooks, Or cleft the shallow channels of the brooks, Whence, as the credulous swore, an Oread shy, And a glad Nymph, had peeped out laughingly. Thus wandering, they reached a sombre mound Rising abruptly from the level ground, And planted thick with dark funereal trees, Whose foliage waved and murmured, though the breeze Had sunk to midnight quiet, and the sky Just o'er the place seemed locked in apathy, Like a fair face wan with the sudden stroke Of death, or heart-break; not a word they spoke, But paused with wide, bewildered, gleaming eyes, Standing at gaze: what mortal terrors rise And coil about their hearts with serpent fold; And O! what loathly scene is this they hold, Grasped with unwinking vision, as they creep, (Led by their very horror,) up the steep, And the whole preternatural landscape dawns Freezingly on them; a broad stretch of lawns Sown with rank poisonous grasses, whence the dew Of hovering exhalations flickered blue, And wavering on the dead-still atmosphere; Dead-still it was, and yet the grasses sere, Stirred as with horrid life amidst the sickening glare! The affrighted crew (all save Avolio) fled Incontinent, but his dull feet with lead Seemed freighted; whilst his terror whispered âfly,â The spell of some uncouth necessity Baffled retreat, and ruthless, scourged him on; Meanwhile the sun thro' darkening vapors shone Nigh to his setting, and a sudden blastâ Sudden and chillâwoke shrilly up and passed With ghostly din, and tumult; airy sounds Of sylvan horns, and sweep of circling hounds Nearing the quarry: now, the wizard chase Swept faintly, faintly up the fields of space, And now, with backward rushing whirl roared by Louder, and fiercer, till a maddening cry, A bitter shrick of human agony Leaped up, and died, amidst the stifling yell Of brutes athirst for blood: a crowning swell Of savage triumph followed, mixed with wails Sad as the dying songs of nightingales Murmuring the nameâActaeon! Even as oneâ A 'rapt sleep-walkerâthrough the shadows dun Of half-oblivious sense, with soulless gaze Goes idly journeying 'midst uncertain ways, Thus did Avolio, sore perplexed in mind, (Excess of mystery made his spirit blind,) Grope through the gloom; anon he reached a fount Whose watery columns had long ceased to mount Above its prostrate Tritons: near at hand, Dammed up in part by heaps of yellow sand,â Dead-white, and lustreless,âa rivulet Of oozy banks, with dank dark alders set, Blurred in its turbid tides the o'erhanging sky; The melancholy waters seemed to sigh In wailful murmurs of articulate woe, And struggling from the sullen depths below. This dirge arose:â SONG OF THE IMPRISONED NAIAD. I. Woe! woe is me! the ages pass away, The mortal seasons run their mystic rounds, Whilst here I wither for the sun-bright day, Its genial sights and sounds. Woe! woe is me! II. One summer night, in centuries long agone, I saw my Oread lover leave the brake, I heard him plaining on the peaceful lawn A plaint âfor my sweet sake.â Woe! woe is me! III. Hearkening! I couched upon a reedy bank, Until the music grew so mournful-wild, Its sweet despair o'ercame me, and I sank Weak, wailful as a child. Woe! woe is me! IV. My heart leaped up to answer that fond lay, But suddenly the star-girt planets paled, And high into the welkin's glimmering gray Majestic Dian sailed. Woe! woe is me! V. She swept aloft,âbold, burning as the sun, And wrathful-red as fiery-crested Mars; Then knew I that some fearful deed was done On earth, or in the stars, Woe! woe is me! VI. With ghastly face upraised, and shuddering throat, I watched the portent with a prescient pain, When, lightning-barbed, a beamy arrow smote, Or seemed to smite my brain. Woe! woe is me! VII. Oblivion clasped me, till I woke forlorn, Fettered, and sorrowing on this lonely bed, Shut from the mirthful kisses of the morn,â Earth's glories overhead. Woe! woe is me! VIII. The south winds stir the sedges into song, The blossoming myrtles scent the enamored air, But still, sore moaning for another's wrong, I pine in sadness here. Woe! woe is me! IX. Alas! alas! the weary centuries flee! The waning seasons perish,âdark, or bright,â My grief alone, like some charmed poison-tree, Knows not an autumn blight. Woe! woe is me! The mournful sounds swooned off, but Echo rose And bore them up divinely to a close Of rare mysterious sweetness; never more Shall mortal winds to listening wood and shore, Bring such heart-melting music: âWhere, O! where!â Avolio murmured, âto what haunted sphere Hath dubious Fate my errant footsteps brought?â Launched on a baffling sea of mystic thought, His reason in a whirling chaos lost Compass and chart, and headway, vaguely tossed 'Midst flitting shapes of wingÃ©d phantasies;â Just then uplifting his bewildered eyes, He sawâhalf hid in shadeâthe pillars grand, Of a great gateway reared on either hand, And close beyond them, nested in a wood Of stern Ã¡spect, a sombrous mansion stood: Long wreaths of ghastly ivy on its walls Quivered like goblin tapestry, or palls, Tattered and rusty, mildewed in the chill Of dreadful vaults; across each window-sill Curtains of weird device and fiery hue Hung moveless,âonly when the sun glanced through The gathering glooms, the hieroglyphs took form, And life, and action, and the whole grew warm With meanings baffling to Avolio's sense:â He stood expectant, trembling, with intense Dread in his eyes, and yet a struggling faith Vital at heart;âa sudden-passing breath Of mystic wind thrilled by his tingling ear, Waving the curtains inward, and his fear Uprose victorians, for a serpent shape, Tall, lithe, and writhing, with malignant gape, Which showed its fiery fangs, hissed in the gleam Its own fell eyeballs kindled; oh! supreme The horror of that vision! as he gazed, Irresolute, mute, motionless, amazed, The monster disappeared; a moment sped! The next, it fawned before him on a bed Of scarlet poppies. âSpeak!â Avolio said, âWhat art thou? speak! I charge thee in God's name;â A death-cold shudder seized the Serpent's frame; Its huge throat writhed; whence, bubbling with a throe Of hideous import, a voice, thin and low, Broke like a mudded rill: âBethink thee well! This Isle is Cos, of which old legends tell Such marvels. Hast thou never heard of me,â The Island's fated Queen?â âAy! verily!â Avolio cried, âthou art that thing of dread!ââ Sharply the Serpent raised its glittering head And front tempestuous. âHold! no tongue save mine Shall solve that mystery! prithee then, incline Thine ear to the sad story of my grief, And with thine ear, yield, yield me thy belief;â Foul as I am, there was a time, O! youth! When these fierce eyes were founts of love and truth; There was a time when woman's blooming grace Glowed through the flush of roses in my face; When,âbut I sinned a deep and damning sin,â I cursed the great Diana! I defied The night's immaculate goddess, argent-eyed, And holiest of Immortals! I denied The eternal might which looks so cold and calm;â Therefore, O! stranger! am I what I am; A monster meet for Tartarus! a thing Whereon men gaze with awe and shuddering, And stress of inward terror; through all time, Down to the last age, my abhorrÃ©d crime Must hold me prisoner in this vile abode, Unless some man, large-hearted as a god, Bolder than Ajax, mercifully deign To kiss me on the mouth!â She towered amain With sparkling crest, and universal thrill Of frenzied eagerness that seemed to fill Her cavernous eyes with jets of lurid fire;â âAnd if I do accord thee thy desire,â Rejoined Avolio, âwhat sure guage have I, That this same kiss thy cursed destiny Hath not ordainedâthe least elaborate plan Whereby to snare and slay me?â âO! man! man!â The Serpent answered with a loftier mien, The while her voice grew mild, her front serene, âShall Matter always triumph; the base mould Mask the immortal essence, uncontrolled Save by your grovelling fancies? O! eterne, And grand Benignities that breathe and burn Throughout Creation, are we but the motes In some vain dream that idly sways and floats To nothingness; or, are your grandeurs pent Within ourselves, to rise magnificent In bloom and music, when we bend above, And wake them by the kisses of our love? I yearn to be made beautiful; alas! Beauty itself looks on prepared to pass In callous disbelief! one action kind, Would free and save me,âWhy art thou so blind Avolio?â While she spoke, two timorous hares Seared by a threatening falcon from their lairs, Rushed to the Serpent's side; with fondling tongue She soothed them as a mother soothes her young. Avolio mused. âCan innocent things like these Take refuge by her? then perchance some good, Some tenderness, if rightly understood, Lurks in her nature. I will do the deed; Christ and the Virgin save me at my need!â He signed the monster nearer, closed his eyes, And with some natural shuddering, some deep sighs, Gave up his pallid lips to the foul kiss. What followed then?âa traitorous serpent hiss Sharper for triumph? O! not soâhe felt A warm, rich, clinging mouth approach and melt In languid, loving sweetness on his own, And two fond arms caressingly were thrown About his neck, and on his bosom pressed Twin lilies of a pure-white virgin breast. He raised his eyes, released from brief despair,â They rested on a maiden tall and fair, Fair as the tropic morn, when morn is new; And her sweet glances smote him through and through With such keen-thrilling rapture, that he swore His willing heart should evermore adore Such loveliness, and woo her till he died. âI am thine own,â she said, âthine own dear bride, If thou wilt take me.â Hand in hand they strayed Adown the shadows through the woodland glade, Whence every evil Influence shrank afraid, And round them poured the golden eventide. Swiftly the news of this most strange event Abroad upon the tell-tale wind was sent, Rousing the eager world to wonderment. Now 'mid the various companies that came To visit Cos, was that leal knight by Fame Exalted, for brave deeds, and faith divine, Shown in the sacred wars of Palestine,â Tancred, Salerno's Prince; he came in state, With fourscore gorgeous barges, small and great; With pomp and music like an Ocean Fate, His blazoned prows along the glimmering sea Spread like an Eastern sunrise gloriously. Him and his followers did Avolio feast Right royally, but when the mirth increased, And joyous-wingÃ©d jests began to pass Above the sparkling cups of Hippocras, Tancred arose, and in his courtly phrase Invoked delight, and length of prosperous days, To crown that happy union; one sole doubt The Prince confessed, and this he dared speak out,â âIt could not be that their sweet hostess still Worshipped Diana, and her heathen will?â âO! Sir, not so!â Avolio flushing cried, âBut Christ the Lord!â No single word replied The beauteous lady, but with gentle pride, And a quick motion to Avolio's side She drew more closely by a little space, Gazing with modest passion in his face, As one who longed to whisper tenderly, âO! brave, kind Heart! I worship only thee!â SONNETS. ON THE OCCURRENCE OF A SPELL OF ARCTIC WEATHER IN MAY, 1858. We thought that Winter with his hungry pack Of hounding Winds had closed his dreary chase,â For virgin Spring, with arch, triumphant face, Lightly descending, had strewed o'er his track Gay flowers that hid the stormy season's wrack. Vain thought! for, wheeling on his northward path, And girt by all his hungry Blasts, in wrath The shrill-voiced Huntsman hurries swiftly back,â The frightened vernal Zephyrs shrink and die Through the chilled forest,âthe rare blooms expire,â And Spring herself, too terror-struck to fly, Seized by the ravening Winds with fury dire, Dies 'mid the scarlet flowers that round her lie, Like waning flames of some rich funeral fire! [I. An idle Poet dreaming in the sun] An idle Poet dreaming in the sun,â One given to much unhallowed vagrancy Of thought and step; who, when he comes to die, In the broad world can point to nothing done; No chartered corporations, no streets paved With very princely stone-work, no vast file Of warehouses, no slowly-hoarded pile Of priceless treasure, no proud sceptre waved O'er potent realms of stock, no magic art Lavished on curious gins, or works of steam; Onlyâa few wild songs that melt the heart; Onlyâthe glow of some unearthly dream, Embodied and immortal! What are these, Sneers the sage world,âchaff! smoke! vain phantasies! [II. Yet Stock depreciates, even Banks decay] Yet Stock depreciates, even Banks decay, Merchant and architect are lowly laid In purple palls, and the shrewd lords of trade Lament, for they were wiser in their day Than the clear sons of light;âbut prithee, how Doth stand the matter, when the years have fled; What means you concourse thronging where the dead Old Singer sleeps;âsay! do they seek him now? Now that his dust is scattered on the breath Of every wind that blows;âwhat meaneth this? It means, thou sapient citizen, that death Heralds the Bard's true life, as with a kiss, Wakens two immortalities; then bow To the world's scorn, O Poet, with calm brow. [Are these the mountains, this the forest gay] Are these the mountains, this the forest gay, Through whose grand gorges, and empurpled aisles I walked when Nature wore the light of smiles, And tuneful Fancies charmed the genial way? O'er the broad landscape shines as fair a day, Still sport the breezes, and the wild brooks weave The same low, drowsy, music; wherefore grieve, I ask my heart, and whence this sad decay Of answering gratulation? Oh! my soul, In thee, in thee, the mournful darkness lies, Which clogs the buoyant pulse, and dims the eyes That feasted once upon the humblest flowers; And so, in vain the kingly mountain towers, The joyous forest waves, the sparkling waters roll. POLITICAL SONNETS. SONNET [I. Hath the proud Spirit which o'erruled this land] Hath the proud Spirit which o'erruled this land When Freedom was baptized in holy blood, Succumbed forever to the turbid flood Of wretched anarchies!âoh! calm and grand, Did her broad wings above our homes expand In the old heroic days; but we have turned From the high shrine whereon her glories burned, And her sweet tongue none seem to understand. What! battling by our hearthstones, while the Foe Storms at the gates of our most sacred Right, When every limb should girded be for fight, And every heart with one impulsion glow! Let Traitors in base broils expend their might, A Titan threats usâshall we bide the blow? [II. Strike! 'tis a righteous quarrel! strike as they] Strike! 'tis a righteous quarrel! strike as they, Our grand, brave, free Ancestors struck of yore, Full at the Tyrant's bosomâthey forebore, But not so long as we haveâmuch delay Endangers liberty, and Freedom's day Wanes when the unquelled Despot stalks abroad. Why pause ye? right is right, and God is God Foreverâwhile the mountain breezes play Unfettered round your summits, while the sea Breaks on your shores in thunder, and the glooms Of mighty woods enshroud your Patriots' tombs, Ringing to stormy anthems, can it be That ye will court the Oppressor's insolent sway, And basely fawn, and falter, andâobey? SONNET [I. The conflict swells apace! the rallying cries] The conflict swells apace! the rallying cries Of frenzied Faction, and discordant Hate Send forth their ominous voices, thundering fate And ruin, while all loftier virtue dies! Above us gleam two giant Destinies Solemn and still, the one with mien elate, The other that dread Doom whose shadows wait Where Freedom's sun pales down its wintry skies; Behind us looms the Past, innumerous grand Imperial Phantoms resurrectionized, And beckoning with dumb pathos by their tombs,â Beyond us, the veiled Future, with command To bless or curse, as we shall stand full-sized In Freedom's light, or dwarfed in Slavery's glooms. [II. Our ancient Honor, our ancestral Pride] Our ancient Honor, our ancestral Pride, Duty, and manhood, every regal Thought Wherewith a noble end is nobly wrought, Purpose made strong and Valor sanctified, All urge divorce from that weak sloth allied To treacherous peace by glozing compacts bought; Success, and empire shall not come unsought, And plumÃ©d Victory walks by Labor's side; Yet Sleep hath bound us, and the shadow of dreams Rests cold upon our spirits; one by one The bulwarks of supremest Rights are riven, And the crash wakes us not, the lightning-gleams Unheeded o'er the tempest's bosom run, And we are blind and deaf to earth, andâheaven. [III. Ay! deaf, blind! lulled with opiates of self-praise] Ay! deaf, blind! lulled with opiates of self-praise, And sluggish in the calm of base content; Our Wisdom clogged, our Will in banishment, Idly we pass the weak, voluptuous days; Or, if a moment starting from the maze Of pleasant dreamings, we have feebly bent To mark the insurgent Madness which hath rent The altars of our safety, brief the gaze! Straight the lethargic Ease resumes its power, And with a listless, and all-vacant air, We mutter foolish fancies, andâare still; Meantime, the Foe is up, the trumpets blare, The mailed Oppression works his iron will, Whilst dark Destruction bides the final Hour. SONNET I. Ye cannot add by any pile YE raise [On the refusal of the Legislature of a Southern State to appropriate any amount for the erection of a Monument to the memory of a distinguished Statesman.] Ye cannot add by any pile YE raise One jot, or tittle to the Statesman's fame: That the world knows; to the far future days Belongs his glory, and its radiant flame Will burn when YE are dead, decayed, forgot; Therefore your opposition matters not; The thin-masked jealousies of present time Unburied in his grave, survive to keep Rampant the hate He deemed his highest praise, And the rude clash of discord o'er his sleep; But for his great, wise acts, his faith sublime, All that the soul of genius sanctifies, These mount where viler Passions cannot climb, These live where palsied Malice faints and dies. [II. Still must the common Voice denounce the deed] Still must the common Voice denounce the deed, The common Heart swell with an outraged pride, That the poor purchase of the paltry meed His country owed him, should be thus denied; Shame on the Senate! shame on every hand Which did not falter when recording there, The basest act achieved for many a year, To fire the scorn of the whole Southern land; Nor the South only, for our foes will cry, Out on your petty pasteboard chivalry! The People who refuse to crown the Great And Good with honor, do themselves eclipse, And doubly shameless is the recreant State, Whose condemnation comes from her own lips. MISCELLANEOUS SONNETS [O! pour thine inmost soul upon the Air] O! pour thine inmost soul upon the Air, And trust to Heaven the secrets that recline In the sweet nunnery of thy virgin breast; Speak to the winds that wander everywhere,â And sure must wander hitherâthe divine Contentment, and the infinite, deep rest That calm thy passionate being, and lift high To the still realm of Love's eternity The passive ocean of thy charmÃ©d thought; And tell the Ariel element to bear The burden of thy whispered heart to me, By Fairy alchemy of distance wrought To something sacred as a saintly prayer, A spell to set my nobler nature free. WRITTEN AFTER READING TRELAWNEY'S DESCRIPTION OF THE BURNING OF SHELLEY'S BODY. Why did they take thee from thine Ocean-grave, O! man of many sorrows?âthe blue sea Had been thy brother, and each wandering wave That kissed the shores of thy loved Italy A solace, and a blessing:âthe low moan Of the lamenting waters seemed to start Within thy soul an echo, and the tone Of a more mournful music in thy heart. O! therefore did'st thou seek them, and pour forth To their deep sympathy a sorrowing strain Of all the woes and wretchedness of earth, That strove to bend thy patient mind in vain: The Ocean heard thee, loved theeâand the breast Of Nature's mighty minstrel gave theeârest. [Thou who art moving ever in the round] Thou who art moving ever in the round Of Custom, dragging an eternal chain, Whose weight for thy dull spirit hath no pain, Deeming that thou life's secret bliss hast found;â Whose senseless ear is ravished by no sound Of inner harmonies, whose eyes are blind To the rich splendors of creative mind, That make our common earth imperial ground, 'Tis well for thee in the supreme content Of grovelling worldliness, to sit, and sigh That Heaven hath fashioned Poesy, and blent With our base instincts aught of pure, and high: Thou would'st pluck down the stars, and curb the bound Of Ocean, did thy Avarice gain thereby! [O lady! radiant lady! thy sweet eyes] O lady! radiant lady! thy sweet eyes, And happy smiles, and fulness of all light Of genial beauty, overthrong my sight With memories of another, who now lies Crowned with the churchyard marble: thou hast all Her winning graces, and her blighted years Re-bloom in thee,âthe dark thought disappears That wooed the silence, and o'erwept the pall. My soul flows to thee, and though not again May passionate thoughts possess me, I will pray, (As a fond brother might,) that on thy way The adoration of strong love may rain Its benedictions,âand around thee fall Blisses that deepen with the deepening day. THE MYSTERY OF LIFE. I. Wrong conquers Right, and the black shadow of ill Covers the earth with drought and drear eclipse, And stammering prayers are uttered by pale lips, And Tyrants triumph, and Fiends drink their fill Of mortal wretchedness, and quick blights kill Virtue i' th' bud of promise;âwherefore this? Moans the blind soul, stumbling away from bliss Through the wide mysteries of the eternal Will; Why fainteth Love in the rude grasp of Hate? Why creeps the Genius which hath wings to soar? And human Misery, fronting human Fate, Scorn and deny Thee, Father, evermore? Till even the faithful falter from the dust. O awful God! we hope that thou art just. THE REVELATION OF DEATH. II. âLight! give me light!â âThe last audible words of Goethe were, More Light! The final darkness grew apace, and he, whose eternal longings had been for more Light, gave a parting cry for it as he was passing under the shadow of Death.â Lewes's Life and Works of Goethe, vol. ii. p. 456.âthe expiring Poet cried, Closing his languid eyelids on the day, And with that solemn cry he passed away; And haply Doubt was solved, and Error died, And glimmering Trust was grandly glorified, Even in the moment of his mightiest need; And that same light God planteth as a seed, Outburst from darkness to a broad noontide; So that he saw as, Brothers! we shall see (Freed by the angel Death) the chain sublime Which binds dim Earth to clear Eternity, Gleam from the duskiest depths of doubtful Time; And learnt, as we shall learn, the wondrous plan âWhich justifies the ways of God to man.â PRE-EXISTENCE. If Immortality be not a dream, Wherefore should we have never known of yore Another life than ours, a mystic shore, Whose memory haunts us as a shadowy beam Of pallid starlight haunts a clouded stream? What lives for aye hereafter, must before Have felt the pulse of being; our weak lore Declares it not; is't therefore the false gleam Of fantasy, which holds we rise to Heaven By infinite gradations, through all rounds Of multiform experienceâby the levin Of fiery trial hallowed in the bounds Of many worlds, till the immaculate soul Stands on the heights of Godhead pure and whole? ELEGIAC. I. âWhom the Gods love, die early,ââit may be,â But standing, noble Friend, beside thy grave, Whereon already the lush grasses wave, Nursed by the pitying Skies' serenity, [While the pent grief expands, the tears gush free,] I do arraign the fiery Fate whose blow, In thy bright morn of years, hath laid thee low, Whose noon had held all gifts of fame in fee; Thou wert a Prince in manhood; every grace Of generous nurture and of genial blood Beamed in thy presence; and thy lordly face, The dial of a clear and lofty mood; Yet now thou art a Phantom,âall is fled,â The grace, the glory,âGod! canst thou be dead? IMMATURITY. The fields are ripening to the harvest bloom, The full grain reddens in the fiery morn, When, lo!âa mighty whirlwind, sudden-born, Blights the fair produce with untimely doom;â Oft do the coral islands faintly loom Above the South-sea waters, to sink back, Crumbling to ruin in the earthquake's track, And what had risen an Eden, restsâa tomb. Thus, glorious natures, toiling through the years, Just ready to yield up the glowing flowers Of faith and genius, fall amid their peers, And bear to Darkness those supernal powers, Wrought slowly upward with elaborate care, Swelling from depths obscure, to fill the loftiest Sphere. [He stands as one to whom all life is vain] He stands as one to whom all life is vain, And death is terrorless,âthe misty dread, Wherewith the Future veils her awful head, Hath touched him like the shadow of past pain: He has no heart to woo Faith's lofty lore, The aspiring Instincts of his youth have fled, And even the shining tracks on which they sped Shall never catch their waning glory more. O Life! O Sorrow! fare ye well together! At last Nepenthe comes with healing wings, And a faint music girds the final sleep; Alas! he cannot sigh, he cannot weep; And even the hope this blest deliverance brings, Falls like a doubtful gleam of Autumn weather. THE GARDEN IN THE CITY. Here in the City's hot and lurid heart, Embowered with richest green, the Garden lies Open to each soft influence of the skies,â A natural brilliant on the breast of Art, A shrine for quiet fancies 'mid the Mart, Whose multiplied harsh tumult faints and dies Adown its still arcades; here Thought may rise Above base Mammon worship, and take part In the soul's inmost drama of delight, Its play of constant hopes, its prophet-powers, Half shrouded, yet indued with prescient might, And bathed with sunshine from far future hours, Calm Meditation merging faith in sight, And drooping Will made strong in Nature's secret bowers! [O! weary bondage of the clouding clay] O! weary bondage of the clouding clay, O! prison of base darkness, in whose gloom Life shows a ghastly spectre, stript of bloom, And beauty faintly struggles with decay,â Come Death! with thy kind lightnings, rend away The crowded shadows, break the charnel doom, Haunting our years, as vapors haunt a tomb, Shut from the morning's songs and bliss of day; Thou Blaster of all hope in hearts of joy, To ours thou shalt be welcome as a Bride Of passionate eyes and love-enamoured breath; The shock of thy sharp summons shall destroy The hideous thrall upon us, and a tide Of happier Life gush from the stroke of Death. TO A CELEBRATED ACTRESS. All moods and feelings,âSorrow, Love, Delight, Tempestuous Pride, and low-voiced Tenderness,â The mournful pleadings of a mute Distress, And regal Passion's fiery-vested might,â Thou hast embodied to our souls and sight, Unsealing the deep fountains of our tears, Or lifting up our spirits from their spheres In the low Actual to the glorious height Of some sublime Ideal;âArt in thee, The genial handmaid of a natural grace, Moves to a queenly measure, bold and free, Yet, moulded ever in each perfect part By that serene and sweet humanity Which crowns the genius with the loyal Heart! WRITTEN ON A FLY-LEAF OF THE LETTERS AND JOURNALS OF SIR HUDSON LOWE, EDITED BY WILLIAM FORSYTH, M. A. How vain with pleas like this to quench the hate, The righteous hate, which, following hot and fast, Like an o'ermastering torrent, whelmed at last The false Malignant!âhe who stooped to sate His bloodless passions on the fallen Great,â To wound and sting by every pitiful art That brave, heroic, sorely-smitten heart, Pierced to the core with deadly shafts of Fate: Base spirit! one unanimous voice of scorn Uprose and rang forever in thine ears,â A haunting voice, reÃ«choed down the years; O! thou didst live detested, die forlorn,â So racked by Memories fierce, by coward Fears, 'Twere best, methinks, that thou hadst ne'er been born! AFTER THE STORM. A long, wild swell! a waste of turbulent sea, Thrilled with the storm's last thunders; overhead, A spectral sky down-glimmering, white and dead, On the gray billows staring sullenly Up to the colorless heavens;âthe winds so free But yester-eve, so furious, harsh, and dread, Have hushed their warring turmoils, and are fled To ocean-gulfs;âthe zephyr's gentle glee Waits for the lingering sunrise;âwhile we look, The clouds, like leaves of some dark-volumed book, Holding a glorious mystery, roll apart, A sudden splendor smites the leaden skies, The waste is all ablaze, the waters start To rapture 'neath the morning's passionate eyes! [Well spake the Poet, that howe'er the cry] Well spake the Poet, that howe'er the cry Of frenzied sorrow might call loud on death, âWhatever crazy sorrow saith, No life that breathes with human breath Has ever truly longed for death.â Tennyson's âTwo Voices.â No soul hath prayed that with our transient breath, The last sad burden of a mortal sigh, Lifeâthoughtâdesireâshould perish utterly; O! rather would the spirit bear the yoke Of torture, if beyond its prison-bars A glimmer of the feeblest promise broke, Athwart new heavens, sown thick with happy stars; O! rather would we hold that doctrine just, Whereby mankindâsave some through Christ set freeâ Shall writhe for aye divorced from joy and trust, Than yield up thus our Immortality, Quenching THAT HOPE in darkness and the dust. DEDICATED TO M. H. H. Her face is very noble, and her mien Gracious, and sweet as sunshine; in her eyes Dwell the deep lights of tender sympathies Which, from abysses of her soul serene, Come out like stars from depths of quiet skies Made lustrous by the night of others' pain; Her deeds of patient goodness fall like rain Upon our arid spirits, whence arise Warm benedictions gladdening all her way With heavenly music; as her stormy day, So is her strength; amid earth's bitter woes The river of her mercy gently flows; Sick hearts revive, and fading hopes grow green, And frenzied Passions sink to soft repose. THE ACTOR TO THE THINKER. Pale Thinker! wed to Monkish solitude! Weaving the subtle substance of thy mind In flimsy webs of speculation blind, Fearful lest some bold worldling should intrude; How false the pride of that self-conscious mood, Wherein thou claim'st the power to loose, or bind The car of progress; thou that liest reclined At lazy length in depths of vernal wood: Give ME the pulse of action, the fierce hope Of triumph 'midst the crowding ranks of men In mart, or field, or temple; let me cope, Not with vain dreams in some deep-shadowed glen, But those stern facts which conquered, straight-way ope The Gates of Fortune to our eager ken! [All day the distant mountain tops have worn] All day the distant mountain tops have worn A glory caught from the frank August sun, Steadfast, serene, unwaning,âall save one Tall peak o'er which a storm-cloud seems to mourn, Or, oftener still, to threaten, as its torn And fiery heart, rent by the lightning bolt, Gleams with a terrible glare o'er heath and holt, The desolate mountain caves, and dells forlorn: Why wreaks the storm its fury on that height, Lonely and rugged, of sweet verdure bared? Because yon haughty peak alone has dared To tower above its peers, to grasp the sky;â Storms, and not sunshine, gird the soul of might, And barren is all bold supremacy! [The West is one great sea of cloudy fire] The West is one great sea of cloudy fire, Above the horizon flaming in a flood Of such thick glory, that the Autumn wood Towers in the splendor like a burning pyre Built in the heat of sacrificial ire, In honor of some fierce Divinity; Some barbarous God of dreadful brow, and eye Red with the fumes of slaughter, and the dire Designs he fosters in his evil might; It burns, and burns from shadowy mountain base Slow-smouldering upwards to the loftiest height, Whereon the feignÃ©d flames with sunset die, But not in darkness, for the radiant grace Of Eve, and Eve's calm Planet, shame the Night. MISCELLANEOUS PIECES. QUEEN GALENA; OR, THE SULTANA BETRAYED. Hold! let the heartless Perjurer go! Speak not! strike not! he is my foe,â From me, me only, comes the blow,â I will repay him woe for woe; Look in my eyes! my eyes are dry, I breathe no plaint, I heave no sigh, Butâwill avenge me ere I die. Think you that I shall basely rest, And know the bosom mine hath pressed Is couched upon a colder breast? Think you that I shall yield the West, The Orient soul my nature nurst, Till the black seed of treachery burst, And blossomed to this deed accurst? My rival! O! her eyes are meek, Her faltering presence wan and weak As the faint flush that tints her cheek; 'Tis not on her that I would wreak LINES ON THE DEATH OF THE REV. J. A. S., THE DISTINGUISHED PASTOR OF THE CHURCH OF ST. PETER, CHARLESTON, S. C. As those who, sailing in a Tropic Sea, Through golden calms borne on contentedly, And yielded to a listless noonday sleep, Are roused therefrom by thunder on the Deep, And wake to sudden turmoil and the dread Of lightning, which has struck a comrade dead, (Their faithful Pilot laboring at the wheel,) O! thus we slumbered, and thus burst the peal Of death's artillery, and the bolt of woe Which smote his noble Life, and laid it mute and low. Our souls were stillâour lives, a summer seaâ When the great God, who worketh fearfully, Around whose will the shroud of mystery 's thrown, Whose paths are dim, whose footsteps are not known, Wrapped in the awful cloud, and darkness came, And on our shuddering hearts his judgment wrote in flame. But what, to our weak sight, is girt about With mist of grief and chilling shades of doubt, To him we mourn is very bright and clear,â His is the joy, and OURS the blight and fear; His the vast freedom, ours the prison wall; His the white robe, and ours the bier and pall; His the calm Height which overtops the spheres, And ours the Depth of passionate despairs; Then should we for ourselves and children keep The bitter human tears 'tis vain for him to weep But tears must fall, and sorrowing words be spoken, And stricken hearts lament, or elseâbe broken; 'Tis not 'mid bleeding love's late-severed ties, We thrill to feel the healing Comfort rise, And catch the inner hymns of Paradise,â Gently, and as the morn from banks of gloom Is slowly rounded upward into bloom, That tender Angel steals upon our being, And with it comes a harmony, agreeing With the soft sunshine of its heavenly spell, And startled Faith returns, and all is well. Then, from the cypress gloom, the darkening sod, We lift our eyes to the pure light of God, Where 'mid the shining ranks, absolved from sin, A perfect spirit hath just entered in, Felt the keen rapture of its last release, Received the immortal Crown, and clasped the palm of Peace. THE BATTLE IN THE DISTANCE. Her dark eyes gleamed amid the gloom, Slow gathering from the stormy main, She stood as one who fronts her doom, And tasks the mystic Fate in vain: Sudden, a steed with drooping rein, Burst from the desert's shadowy rim, And flecked with many a crimson stain, Paused by the portal, black and grim. She knew the steed,âshe marked the cloud Which rolled across the distant fight, And strove to pierce the awful shroud,â But a strange mist o'erhung her sight, The prospect swayed in doubtful light, And, idly tottering to and fro, She shivered 'neath the lurid might Of prescient Thoughts foreboding woe. âO, Love! last eve, your head was laid Close to this warm and tender breast, And all the thrilling vows we made, And all I knew, and all I guessed, Of passion breathed, or unexprest, Did point to bliss built up on bliss, An Aidenne of voluptuous rest New-opened by each burning kiss. âBut Fate is stern, and men are base, Wrong creepeth in the dark to smite,â A caitiff who had seen my face Onceâon El Kalim's castled height, Swore by the Houris' brows of light To bear me through his Harem gate, And yonder strives my Roland's right With jealous fraud and desperate hate.â But see! the cloud rolls up apace! But hark! the shouts grow wild and clear! A sudden whirlwind! and the place Of strife looms outward everywhere;â And lo! his proud plume waved in air, The victor Roland!âa dense throng With glittering casque, and gleaming spear, Shouting an ancient knightly song Of triumph, close around their Lord, And banners flaunt, and trumpets peal, And thundering on the level sward Rush the fierce chargers, clad in steel; The solid feudal bastions reel, The welkin thrills to brave alarms, Tumultuous liegemens' fiery zeal, With clang of hoofs, and clash of arms. That night the bonfires hid the stars, The mighty wassail bowl foamed high, And to the deepest dungeon-bars, Rang the uproarious revelry; And knights did woo, and ladies sigh, And minstrels sung, and jesters laughed, And gayly sped from eye to eye, Love winged his fairy-feathered shaft. But in a cloister near the sea, Shut from the jest, the dance, the tale, While the low winds breathe mournfully, And shadows throng, and billows wail, Bowed by the altar, hushed and pale, The Lord and Lady court the calm, Till the last lingering echoes fail Of solemn prayer and saintly psalm! TO A FRIEND IN AFFLICTION. Oh! bitter is this final blow! Yet shouldst thou strive to battle still, To calm the heart, to nerve the will, And overcome the woe;â Although thou walk'st a desolate path, Where all the blooms of life seem dead, And fierce, and threatening overhead, The thunder speaks in wrath;â Yet never, while the sovereign brain Retains the rule by Nature given, Should misery shake our trust in heaven, Or Manhood crouch to Pain! Young art thou, and this stormy day, So cold, so dim, so cheerless now, May thrill thy brightening soul and brow With sudden noontide ray;â Or else, ere Life shall sink to Night, A golden sunset-calm may rise, To flush thy spirit's peaceful skies With blessed evening light. Whate'er betide, 'tis noblest, best, Against all earthly ills to cope, Keep to the last our heart and hope, And leave with God the rest! LIFE'S UNDER-CURRENT. Mankind esteemed him happy! filled with good Of all things grateful unto youth's desire; Alas! they neither saw, nor understood His sorrow's secret fire. How could they dream that one whose genial face Seemed the sure index of a soul at rest, Watched in the darkening shadow of disgrace, Fierce torture in his breast? How could they tell that one whose smiles would wake To such quick radiance of responsive glee, Unseen tormentors to a viewless stake Had bound in agony? O, shallow wisdom of this world, avaunt! Thou seest the outward show, the whited tomb, But there is that within would stir and daunt, And shake thee as with doom! Mirth, silvery clear, from breaking hearts may rise, Gay laughter quiver upon Misery's lips, 'Tis not the whimpering soul that shrinks and sighs, That most has known eclipse;â For strong hearts, strong in joy, more strong in pain, Dare to the last the banded hosts of Fate, And covering o'er their death-wounds, on the plain, Sink even in death elate. We cannot mould our lives, but can our wills Gird with keen-steeled resolve to meet our foes, And he who fights unyieldingâhe fulfils A doom to which repose, The sordid quiet of your sensual souls Is mean and tame, as those low lands which lie 'Twixt mountain peaks that swell the thunder-rolls, The battling eagle's cry. SONG. I. Here, long ago, While the fair River in its spring-time flow, Murmured with happy voice âRejoice! Rejoice!â While youth's full pulses thrilled within our breasts, Far from life's hopeless calms, or fierce unrests, We told our love; The April sunset heaven was bright above, The earth below Most beautifulâbut this was long ago, Long, very long ago. II. Here, once again, While the dark River like a soul in pain Heaves, as it were from depths of human care, A sigh of lorn despair; Youth's glorious pulses stilled within our breasts, The haunt of hopeless calms, or fierce unrests, We speakâbut NOT of love! The angry winter's heaven is wild above, The earth below Drear as the hopes that withered long ago, Long, very long ago. PALINGENESIS. I dreamed of late a mystic dream! Methought that Death Had struck my heart's warm pulses still, And robbed my breath: This feverish blood, and troubled soul Were calm and cold; That which had borne thought, passion, will, Wasâsenseless mould; I saw the mourners round my bedâ I heard their wail; I knew what heavy tear-storms drenched My forehead pale: YetâI was dead, dead, dead, for aye! My blood was ice, And crumbled with my crumbling brain Thought's last device. LINES. COMPOSED UPON A BEAUTIFUL DAY IN AUTUMN. How grandly in the mild September rays Rest the rich forests, and the cloudless sky! Thou queenliest of the regal Autumn days, Would that thy happy Hours might never fly! O! that the same calm glory in the air Might bless forevermore our grateful sight! O! that the Earth might ever seem as fair And Nature wear for aye these robes of light! In the still Present, musing, let me rest, The Past be banished, and the Future veiled! Dark fears! yield up your empire in my breast, Fierce memories! leave my spirit unassailed: This genial morn I give to gentle thought, Angels of peace and comfort hover nigh; Sweet Hope, so long an alien, comes unsought, And Joy resumes her sway, I know not why: Yet, Heaven! I thank thee for these healthful gleams Of present bliss, though brief the rapture be; They pierce the sullen darkness of my dreams, They bring me nearâoh! Father!âunto thee! THE TEMPTER IN THE HOUSE. The sky is dark with a cloudy pall, And the earth is dim with rain, And the ghastly pine trees toss and moan By the side of the moaning main; And around the eaves of the desolate Hall The shrill March winds complain. But a darker pall has shrouded the light Of the Household Hopes within, For the troubled hearts that toss and moan By the terrible verge of sin Are sorely beset by the Tempter's might, And the Devil is sure to win! THE UNPRISONED SPIRITS. Our prison walls are wrecked and gray; Cast not a glance behind us, For forceful fraud has ceased to stay, And tyrant chains to bind us; Press onward where his herald-gleams The Day-God sends in warning, Shake off the LÃ©thean dew of dreams, And speed to hail the morning; Dreary the night, and foul the wrong That curbed our bold endeavor, But though the despot held us long, He could not hold forever. Brave hearts, and high in Hell's despite Can ne'er make base surrender Of THAT which clothes the will with might, The Genius with its splendor; The Gods of earth may tempt and blind The souls that soar above them, But worthier Fates will seek, and find, And nobler Masters prove them; So, when the Tempter's hour is passed, His bonds are rent asunder, His dungeon topples in the blast, And falls before the thunder. Then rise the souls he could not tame To writeâin deedsâtheir story; To pluck the laurel-wreath from Fame, And scale the Mount of Glory; Then, stronger for the deep disgust Of brief revolt from Duty, They fight the battle of the Just, Led on by Truth and Beauty; Upborne from sun-crowned height to height, They chase the grand Ideal Till conquering faith is merged in sight, The Ideal in the Real! SUNSET AND MOONLIGHT. Here, glancing from this breezy Height, While the still Day goes slowly down, And sombre Evening's shadows brown Close o'er the purple-flushing light. I mark the softer radiance rest Of the calm moon, till now unseen, Along the Ocean tides serene, Scarce heaving toward the faded West; At first there dawns a ghostly ray, Faint as a new-born infant's dreams, But soon an ampler glory streams, And trembling up the lustrous Bay, Long level shafts of silvery glow Lead upward to the quiet skies, The radiant paths to Paradise Revealed when all is dark below. FLOWERS FROM A GRAVE. These flowers are withered, Lady! like the hopes We buried in the grave from which they sprung; Yet are the tokens precious; they have voices, And sad, sad memories of the broken Past;â O! I could steep them in my bitter tears, But that the channels of my grief are closed, And dryer than their petals; those whose hearts Have wept blood, seldom find their eyelids moist With dew of milder sorrow;âfrom her grave You plucked these blooms in the soft summer dawn;â Her grave, whose mould lies heavier on our souls Than e'er on her sweet body; God in Heaven Reward you for the pure impulsive pity To which I owe these treasures;âthey are dear To memory as to passion, and though dead, Are greener than the sapless barren life Of him who wears them, henceforth, next his heart! BOUGHT AND SOLD. I have no hope, and I will not cope Base knave with you!â A Nabob whose gold remains untold, What may I do to vanquish you, And to lift my Love To a heart above The bitter, the cruel, the dazzling spell Which has snared her soul with the snare of Hell? Win her, and wear! Go to the shrine with a Satyr's leer, To the holy altar of God With the vilest thought that the prurient clod, Miscalled your Heart, can engender; O! guardian Angels, behold and weep!â No more in your prayers befriend her,â For lo! her purity seems to fall Like a garment off by the chancel wall, She is yours to keep No more,â For a woman, a woman, that's bought and sold In a mart where the Devil pays down the gold, Goes forth from the sacred door! PERFECT CALM. See Thorndale, or the Conflict of Opinions, p. 413. Eternal Quiet were eternal sleep! âO! we will make,â some fond Enthusiast cries, âThis present weary world a Paradise O'er which all gentle Thoughts their watch shall keep; A noiseless calm shall brood above its bowers, And only Nature's sweet, and tender powers, Hold genial converse in the charmÃ©d shade;â Through the new Eden's golden gates I look, And lo! stretched listless by a murmuring brook, Whose silvery lustre glimmers 'mid the glade, I see the angel Tenant of the place, Fast by the tree of Life, his placid face Half hidden in his pinions' downy deep, The Angel muses, or perchanceâhe prays!â Not so, look closer,âhe is sound asleep! FRAGMENT OF AN ODE ON THE DEATH OF A GREAT STATESMAN. Toll forth, O mournful bells, the solemn dirge; Speak out to the hushed heavens your lamentation, A deep funereal music, surge on surge, Timed to the sorrow of a stricken Nation; For a grand Life hath set, The last Star in a glorious sky gone down, And sullen shades of lowering darkness frown, Where constellated lights of genius met On the proud summits of our old Renown! JANUARY TO MAY. I have naught to give thee, lady,â Love nor gold; This dull urn of burial-ashes, This is all I hold. Wouldst thou wed a soul in ruin, Clasp a breast, Where in depth of doubt and darkness Bides a demon-guest? Wouldst thou pour a fervid torrent, Passion's flood, On a wrecked and lonely nature, Chilled in brain and blood? O, forbear! thou wert not fated Thus to yield;â All thy warmth of love and beauty Leaves me unannealed. Plant thy roses in the spring-mould, Not the snow; And thy precious heart-seeds scatter Where the seeds may grow! A REMEMBRANCE. Softly shone thy lustrous eyes On that silent summer night, Softly on my wakened heart, Thrilling into love and light, Though from the near mountain's height The shadows wrapt us solemnly. Faintly fell the tremulous tones From thy sweet lips coyly won,â Dropping with the liquid lull Of low rivulets, by the sun Courted from the woodlands dun, Into pastures, glad and free. Through the mazes of deep speech Wandered we, absorbed,âapart,â On the mingled flood of thought Drawing nigh each other's heart,â Till we felt the pulses start Of a mystic sympathy! Ah! those brief, harmonious hours! When their wingÃ©d music fled, Discord through all voices ran, And the universe seemed dead, Only,âmoaning o'er its bed, I heard the low pathetic sea. LUCETTE. A snow-white brow, and tender eyes! A lip of rich carnation! A fairy's pace, And form of grace, With the still glory on her face Of virgin meditation! A snow-white mind! the tenderest heart That e'er bore Heaven reflected! A light, it seems, Of sacred dreams (O radiant tide!) about her streams, The chrism of God's elected. I greet her with a conscious thrill, âA strange and deep confusion,â As one who knows His crimes must close Hope's portal to the Thought which rose, âGo! win her from seclusion!â False am I, yet not false enough To link my base condition With her pure state, Forestalling Fate, Who lurks with latent Joy in wait To crown her with fruition. THE PICTURE OF A BEAUTIFUL DEATH A FRAGMENT. They knew that she must leave them! day by day Her spirit brightened through its veil of clay, Till that seemed spirit also,âa fair Thing, Poised for a moment on its luminous wing, And soon,âoh! not to die,âbut melt away Into the perfect splendor:â One calm morn, âA July morn,âjust as the sunshine kissed From the dim summits of the broadening hills The shadows of the twilight and the mist, Amidst the faint-heard music of far rills, With not a sight, nor tone, nor shade forlorn In earth or heaven,âshe rose from mystic dreams To view once more the golden summer-gleams, And say âfarewellâ to Nature;â Nature smiled, And with majestic pity drew around The failing footsteps of her favorite child Her richest spells of beauty;ânot a sound But came with mellowed murmur,ânot an air That touched her tranquil forehead, and dark hair, But seemed a Seraph's whisper; the glad birds Were full of carols, and the loving Sky Bent, as it were, to clasp her; peaceful herds Browsed on the distant slopes, and in the vale, Still as a placid vision, the clear lake Glassed the blue heaven's divine tranquillity.â And every verdant shrub and blossoming brake Glistened with dewy baptism. There she lay As in the first mild sleep of infancy, Her face upturned towards the quiet sky, O'er which a white cloud floated silently, âMost like an angel;âas the cloud crept on, It threw a shadow struggling with a gleam Right on her eyelids; slowly they unclosed From the deep rapture of some glorious dream, And the large eyes, clear with immortal life, Shone out upon her mother;âthen she sighed One transient human sigh,âand soâshe died. And years have passed!âspring blooms, and wintry showers, And gorgeous splendors of Autumnal eves By turn have glorified, and chilled the spot Her mortal form hath hallowed;âbut the years Bring no reprieve to memory!âlast thou not, O stricken Mother! ever in thy mind A vision of thy darling 'mid the leaves Of the young spring-vines dying?âpale as then, But oh! so beautiful, so beautiful, That murmuring to thyself, thou sayst again, âAs in a trance,ââdaughter! the angels wait To bear thee up!ââ Alas! the Eden gate Hath closed so long upon her, that oftimes A stress of rayless misery weighs thee down; Thou hear'st no hymn supernal,âbut the chimes Of funeral bells,âthe everlasting crown Pales by the spectral whiteness of her tomb!â There shalt thou mourn through all the coming years, And there, when Faith is darkened, drop thy tears, God help thee lady! 'twas the bitterest blow! Yet other hearts than thine were stricken low, And other hopes eclipsed, when she departed; Well, let us lean on Patience! we have done With earthly gauds; the day is waxing late, The sunset falls, the shadows are unfurled About the Future, and I see thee stand, O Mother! with thy loved one, hand in hand, Beneath the palm-trees in the Better Land! THE PESTILENCE. WRITTEN DURING THE PREVALENCE OF THE YELLOW FEVER IN CHARLESTON, S. C., IN THE SUMMER OF 1858. How long, O Lord! shall Desolation hold Stern empire over us, and wasteful Death Darken the sunshine, and the life of hope? Fierce Harvester! Oh! whither stretch the bounds Of thy permitted vengeance? hast thou not In thy cold granary heaped the human grain Sheaf upon sheaf?âis not the harvest ended, Or nigh its end?âmost precious household bonds Of wifehood, childhood, brotherhood, all ties Which twine with tenderest thrill around our hearts, âAnd parted leave them broken,âthy swift scythe Hath severed; barren hast thou left the field Thou found'st so rich in fruitage; spare the rest, The few, sad, shivering stalks that droop i' th' wind Mourning their prostrate brethren. God of might! How fearful art thou when in cloud and fire, Thou send'st thy pitiless messengers to smite The doomÃ©d nations! then this beautiful earth, Changed to a pestilent charnel, opes her womb Unutterably loathsome, where Decay Sits mocking at our motley human pomps, Our pride, and even the sacred passionate grief Wherewith we mourn its victims;âhollow masks Hiding a dark Reality, seem all Man's shows, conventions, forms, howe'er august. Death pricks them with his keen Ithurial lance, And lo! from out of their gilded impotence crawls âThe Conqueror Worm!â âHard it is for Earth Amidst these mortal vapors,âthese foul damps Corrupt, and earthy, to lift up her wings Dank with sepulchral dew, and win the light Which still shines calm above them; her fair face, Furrowed with scathing tears, hath lost its clear Angelic courage, and her faltering voice,â Faint as the tremulous accents of fourscore,â Can only whisper feebly, âWatch, and pray!â RETROSPECTION AND ASPIRATION. The fiery glow of sunset pales, And soft adown the deepening vales The tranquil shadows steal apace; The winds repose, the waters keep The stillness of unbroken sleep, And all the unmeasured realm of space Between us, and the stars that rise To crown those rich imperial skies, Majestic Silence holds in thrall: Onlyâthe quiet dews that fall In stealthy dripping from the eaves, Or some lone bird among the leaves, Touched by a transient dream of flight, Stir to the faintest thrill of sound, The mystery of the Calm profound. The peace of Heaven is in my heart! And if that God would grant me grace, I could lie down in this sweet place, Breathe Nunc Dimittis!âand depart! I stand forlorn, where last the light Of her mild beauty blessed my sight;â Oh! she, so generous in her trust, So queenly in her maiden pride,â (The pride of perfect womanhood That crowneth with its regal sweetness All meaner creatures' incompleteness,) Was near to blend the brightening charm Of her entrancing human eyes With Nature's beauty, and make warm With whisperings of a human loveâ Born of all tender sympathiesâ The else cold pulses of the air. Soul! thou alone art altered here! Around me sways the orange grove, The self-same grove that heard our vows, And waved its glad melodious boughs, Setting to music all she said, And showering on her gracious head White flowers, as if to crown a bride: Just on an eve like this, she diedâ So still and fairâI saw her die, Bound by a spell of misery Too bitter for the balm of sighs,â That froze the tears within mine eyes, The currents of my brain and blood; The while, as statue-wan, I stood As one who in the lonely trance Of some unearthly dark Romance, Hath heard a ghostly voice of doom Wailing above an open tomb. Love! lift me to thy radiant clime,â I sicken on the waste of Time, And burn to breathe a subtler breath Than that which haunts these realms of death; For round about me float and stir Foul vapors from the sepulchre, Rising,âa monstrous gloom,âto blight The glory of the inner sightâ Shrouding phantasmal shapes of ill,â But thou, the same sweet Angel still, Thou canst not leave me thus forlorn, And exiled from the gates of Morn! Within my soul a vision glows, A vision of the peace to be, The undivined serenity, In whose clear depths the angels dwell: Through many a fiery-circled Hell Of self-inflicted woe and pain, Through many livesâ(for still I hold That not in vain above us rolled, The mighty Planets whirl in space,â Each is the destined dwelling-place Of souls, fresh-winged in every star,â) We struggle toward the holy Height, The consummation infinite, Whereto the groaning Ages tend: A prescient Voice foretells the End O Voice that fallest faint and far, Sound on through all our dreary night; âFrom height to height the soul aspires, Reluming its mysterious fires Through the vast worlds which gird the way Up to the immemorial Day Of primal Immortality!â Ah! that I then may meet with thee In that serene Eternity! May feel that human love can shine Unwavering 'midst the Love Divine, May rise on Rapture's eagle wing, And hear the spheral music ring, And that great Song the Seraphs sing Peal round the Godhead's Mystery,â And mark, where grosser systems trace Their orbits in the outcast space, Earth with its transient agonies Sink from the height of those calm skies Down to a gulf so dim and low, They flicker to a fire-fly glow, Myths of a million years ago! [Vainly a hostile world may strive to tame] Vainly a hostile world may strive to tame The Poet's soul through Love, and Grief made strong; Unfettered still, he soars to heights of Song, Whence his clear genius sheds a starlike flame. Deaf to the captious sneer, the ignorant blame, He sings of heavenly Right, and mortal Wrong, Of faith and sufferance, that by birth belong To noble spirits,âand that final fame Which crowns their shining brows with Amaranth bloom: No shallow discontent, with fretful moan, Mars his brave utterance,âno unmanly gloom Shadows his heart wherein Hope reigns alone; For rebel Doubts his nature hath no room, Scorning to be thus basely overthrown! [Moments there are when most familiar things] Moments there are when most familiar things Seem strangers to us; when 'round heart and head The mists of unreality are spread, From which our keenest searching, baffled, brings Unformed conceptions, vague imaginings, Tinged with the doubtful hues of a half-truth; Chiefly in age, or in our dreaming youth This phase of contemplation sternly wrings Our bosoms with the thought,ââthe soul is blind!â Unfathomed meanings, beauty most divine, Lie round about us,âbut we cannot see; In sky and forest burns a spirit's sign Unrecognized, and in the whispering wind Breathes a low undertone of mystery! FUGITIVE VERESES. [Through dismal nights, and long laborious days] Through dismal nights, and long laborious days, A weary Workman at the forge of Thought, He toils, till brain and spirit overwrought, Sink to enforced inaction, and the maze Of troublous dreams;âno nimble Fancy plays Her necromantic tricks which lead to naught But stale delusions; bitter years have taught His heart the hollowness of casual praise; And yet, even this poor boon's denied him now;â Bound by Convention's hard and galling rule, He must subdue his nature, smooth his brow, List meekly while an ignorant Pedant speaks, And though the hot blood boils from soul to cheeks, Pay homage to a tyrant, and a fool! A LIFE-HISTORY,âBRIEFLY TOLD. I. In the saddening light of the Autumn stars, Half hidden behind those lattice-bars,â I mark the flush of her ringlets bright Gleam faintly forth on the misty night; II. Her face is pale, and I barely see That her looks are bended mournfully On what, perchance, is the image of One, Who, dying,âleft her hopes undone! III. Poor girl! she had given her best, her all,â And now her heart like a funeral pall Holds only a thought of the silent dead, Of the grace that is lost, and the love that's fled. TO G. C. H. I. I know not where thou art my Friend, But tender thoughts arise, and wend Their way to thee, where'er thou art; No distance chills the loyal heart. II. If ocean breezes fan thy cheek, Oh, may their breath be mild and meek, And every wind that stirs the sea Come like a mother's kiss to thee! III. Or if, the mighty billows past, Thy eager feet have touched at last That glorious realm which filled thy dreams, While pondering by our Western streams, IV. May all those antique scenes be bright As when beheld in Fancy's light, So that thy soul may haply chance To wander still with old Romance. V. Once, the delicious hope was mine To blend a traveller's joys with thine, From farthest frith of Northern sea, To the fair fields of Italy: VI. But Fate stepped in with stern command, And bound me to this barren land;â What matter?âthough by Fate denied, No Power can keep me from thy side.</field>
