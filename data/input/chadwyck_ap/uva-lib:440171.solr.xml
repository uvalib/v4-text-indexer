      <field name="fulltext">BRER RABBIT AND THE TAR-BABY In Levemteen Hunder'd-an-Full-er-Fleas, When dey raise sech a crap er gooba peas, De creeturs wuz all des ez chummy ez you please: Dey raced an' dey rastled, dey jumped an' dey played, An' dey wa'n't nothin' 'tall fer ter make 'um 'fraid. Dey had der parties, bofe dar an' here, Wid May-pop puddin' an' 'simmon beer; An' de way dey keep der Fo'th-er-Julys Wuz in eatin' goobas an' fresh tater piesâ An' dey wa'n't no doubt, an' no prehaps, Dat dey holp one anudder out wid der craps. An' dey had der frolics in de fall, When dey 'scort'd Miss Meadows ter de ball, Wid âSasshay, ladies!â an' âBalance all!â Dey had mighty little fer ter set um back, Good health an' good crapsâbut what dey lack Wuz good, clean water when de branch run dry, Kaze de river wuz muddy when low er high. Dey mought 'a' got a well by sellin' corn, But de man what dugged um ain't been born; So dey rocked along fum day ter day, An' hoed der corn an' saved der hay. When de Sun helt its own up in de sky, An' de long drouth come, an' de branch run dry, Mr. Fox an' Mr. Wolf look like dey'd die; An' all de creeturs wuz in de same fix, Ceppin' ol' Brer Rabbit, wid his errytatin' tricks; He went his way, an' he had his fun Ef de branch wuz dry er ef it run; He loped along wid his lippity-clips, A-wigglin' his nose an' a-workin' his lips, An' his mornin' drink wuz allers newâ It wuz sweet-gum sap an' honey-dew! De kin' what you fin' in de heart uv a flower, Er de poplar-leaf, ef you'll wait fer de hour, An' watch fer de moonshine's sweetenin' shower! But de yuther creeturs ain't cotch de knack, Dey wuz dull ez walkin' ter mill an' back; Dey never tuck notice how de birds kin sing, How de black bee zoons when he's on de wing, How de stars swing 'roun', how de flowers smell, An' dey'd dodge fum thunder wid âWell, well, well!â Dey wisht mighty strong dat der cants wuz coulds, Twel de day Mr. Fox got back fum de woods. He come back, he did, an' sezee, âBy jing! You kin b'lieve me or not, but I done foun' a spring, An' I feel like cuttin' de pidjin-wing! An' it runs so clean, an' it runs so clear, Dat it do like it's whisp'rin' in yo' y'ear, Wid its âGoogle-goody!â an' its âGoogle-good!â It's 'way over yander in de Chinkapin wood!â An' de creeturs all, dey wuz happy, mon! Dey trot, an' dey gallop, an' den dey run, Wid a tippity-tip, an' a long-time swing, Ter whar dey kin see de googlin'-spring! Well, de spring wuz dar at de head er de dreen, Whar de calamus shuck its flags er green, An' de cat-tails tried fer to make a screen: De creeturs all laugh, an' den dey squeal, An' dey hopped all 'roun' on toe an' heel. Brer Rabbit, he ax, âWhat's de hullabaloo?â An' dey answer back, âIt's a spring fer true!â Den ol' Brer Rabbit tuck anudder chaw Er his terbacker, an' he work his jaw, An' sniff de a'r, an' shet his eyes, An' fling back his head, an' look mighty wise. Now, de spring had been dar sence de Flood, But one fine mornin' 'twuz full er mud, (An' ol' Brer Rabbit, he chawed his cud!) An' atter dat 'twa'n't never clear, An' der wa'n't no google fer de creeturs ter hear; 'Twuz mud in de mornin', an' mud at nightâ 'Tain't no use er talkin', dat mud wuz a sight! Mr. Fox, ez de finder, watched over de spring, An' he try ter diskiver what kinder thing Wuz a-stirrin' up mud bofe night an' dayâ An' he watch an' he wait twel he had his way. An' one fine mornin' he foun' some tracks, An' he shuck his head (I'm tellin' you de facts!) An' he went off an' got im some shoemaker's wax, An' pitch an' rozzum, an' den an' dar He mould him a baby outer de tar, Wid leg an' body, an' head an' han'â An' it look like it settin' dar playin' in de san'â An' he hide hisse'f whar he kin see Whatsomever gwine ter happen ter de Tar-Baby-eeâ De Tar-Baby-ow, de Tar-Baby-ohâ An' den he hide an' lay mighty low! Brer Rabbit, he skipped along at las'â He skip sorter slow, den he skip kinder fas'â Kaze he use de spring ez a lookin'-glass, An' he seed de Tar-Baby settin' dar: âGood-mornin', suh, an' how's yo' Ma? An' how does yo' copperositee Seem ter segashuate?â sezee; âAn' whar yo' manners? You mus' be deff! You'll hear ef I hit you, an' you'll lose yo' breff!â Brer Rabbit, he wait, wid âTooby sho!â Tar-Baby say nothin'âMr. Fox lay low! âYou better tell me howdy! you better make yo' bow! No trouble ter show you ef you dunner howâ Er maybe you er keen fer ter git in a row? Good-mornin', dis mornin', I'll ax you once mo'!â Tar-Baby say nothin'âMr. Fox lay low! Brer Rabbit, he stomp his foot on de groun', âYou er mighty stuck up, but I'll fetch you down! You see dis han'? Well, I'll hit you a blip Dat'll split you open fum hat ter hip! What ail you, man? an' whar did you grow?â Tar-Baby say nothin'âMr. Fox lay low! Brer Rabbit made a pass at 'im des fer luck, An' he hauled off an' hit 'im in de eyeâkerchuck! An' tried ter jump away, but de han' done stuck! âTurn me loose, you villyun, er I'll hit you ag'in! I'll gi' you a jolt dat'll cave you in!â Brer Rabbit draw'd backââI'll try yo' pluck!â An' biffed 'im ag'in, an' t'er han' stuck! âYou see dis foot? I'll gi' you a kick Dat'll lan' you down yander close ter Ol' Nick! Des turn me loose, an' I'll let you go!â Tar-Baby say nothin'âMr. Fox lay low. Brer Rabbit hit de groun' wid his foot, an' say: âYou'll be sorry you pestered wid me dis dayâ So des turn me a-loose an' go on away!â Den he up wid his foot an' kicked 'imâblam! âI lay I'll show you des who I am!â But de foot done stuck! âWill you le' me go?â Tar-Baby say nothin'âMr. Fox lay low! Den Brer Rabbit feel like he 'bout ter git vext, Kaze he spected eve'y minnit would be de next, An' he monstus sorry dat it wuz so! Tar-Baby say nothin'âMr. Fox lay low. Well, de yuther foot stuck, an', atter dat, Brer Rabbit, he grin like a Chessy-catâ âEf you don't turn me loose I'll butt you flat! I'll scatter yo' brains! I'll ruin you, sho!â Tar-Baby say nothin'âMr. Fox lay low. Brer Rabbit, he butted ez hard ez he could, An' his head it stuck, let 'im do what he wouldâ An' de Tar-Baby helt 'im hard an' fast, An' it look like his time done come at last: Mr. Fox sa'nter'd out fum his hidin' place, Wid a blood-red smile runnin' 'cross his face! He scraped his foot an' den he bow, He licked his chops an' den he 'low: âHowdy-do, Brer Rabbit? How you feel, nohow?â Wid a th'obbin' heart an' a shakin' knee, Brer Rabbit wuz skeer'd ez skeer'd could be. âYou er mighty stuck up,â Mr. Fox, he say, âAn' I'm s'prized ter see it at dis time er day!â He walked aroun'ââHere's a gooba shell, I kin skacely believe it! Well, well, well!â He pulled off his coat an' rolled up his sleevesâ âNow, I'm gwine ter show you des what I b'lieves!â An' he grinned ag'in de grin dat wuz red, An' he opened his mouf fer ter let it spread Twel he show all de tushes in his head: He grab Brer Rabbit by de leg, An' you oughter hear dat creetur beg! Mr. Fox, he say, âWhat I'm gwine ter do Is to pay you bofe fer de ol' an' de new! Oh, you nee'n ter talk: I know you er nice: But you fooled me once an' you fooled me twice! You steal my goobas, an' den you fling A whole pile er mud right in dat spring! âBut I got you now, an' yo' hide I'll stretchâ I'll l'arn you sump'n, you triflin' wretch! I'll gi' you de ol'-time Buckra tetch! I'll skin you alive, I'll drown you dead! I'll break yo' neck. I'll crack yo' headâ I'll wallop you twel I make you think I'm de patter-roller, you wall-eyed slink!â Brer Rabbit sniffle, an' den he say, âI know mighty well you'll have yo' way: You may drown me, suh, ef it's yo' desires, But please don't fling me in de briers!â De tar wuz so rank dat Brer Rabbit sneeze, But he still wuz shakin' in de knees, An' he keep on a-whimplin', âPlease, suh, please!â âOh, yes! I'll please!â Mr. Fox, he say, âAn' I'll please myse'f dis very day! You mayn't be mine, but I think you is, An' I'm sho gwine ter bake you twel you sizz! I'll kindle de bresh-heap, an' fling you in, An' I lay dat'll cook an' crisp yo' skin!â Brer Rabbit, he say: âDes fetch on yo' fires, But please don't fling me in de briers!â Brer Fox, he study an' rub his chin, He rub it once, an' he rub it ag'in, An' he wunk one eye, an' grinned a grinâ âI'll hang you high, an' maybe higher, An' I'll fling you in de big quogmire!â âDo des ez you please,â Brer Rabbit cry, âAn' I'll ax no reason, fer which er why; You kin drown me deep, you kin hang me high, An' not one tear will drap fum my eye; You kin hamstring me wid red-hot wires, But please, oh, please, keep me outer de briers!â Mr. Fox he tuck him at his word, An' sont him sailin' like a bird, Ez ef he wuz feather'd instidder furr'd, Right spang in de briers growin' dar Ez thick, ev'y bit, ez de thickest ha'r: Brer Rabbit, he holla, âI ain't got a scratch! I was bred an' born in de brier-patch! You flung me in an' lif de latch: Oh, one fine mornin', when day was dawnin', I was bred an' born in de brier-patch!â DE APPILE-TREE Dat's a mighty quare tale 'bout de Appile-tree In de Pa'dise gyarden whar Adam run free, Whar de butterflies drunk honey wid ol' Mammy Bee. Talk 'bout good times! I bet you he had 'emâ Adamâ Ol' man Adam un' de Appile-tree. He woke one mornin' wid a pullin' at his sleeve; He open one eye, an' dar wuz Eve; He shuck her han', wid âHoney, don't you grieve!â Talk 'bout good times! I bet you dey had 'emâ Adamâ Adam an' Eve un' de Appile-tree. Den Eve tuck a bite er de Appile fruit, An' Adam he bit, an' den dey scoot (Dar's whar de niggers l'arned de quick callyhoot), An' run an' hid behime de fig-tree. Talk about troubles! I bet you dey had 'emâ Adamâ Adam an' Eve behime de fig-tree. Dey had der frolics an' dey had der flings, An' den atter dat der fun tuck wings. Honey mighty sweet, but bees got stings. Talk about hard times! I bet you dey had 'emâ Adamâ Adam an' Eve behime de fig-tree. Kaze out er dat gyarden dey had fer ter skin, Fer ter look fer de crack whar Satan crope in. Dey s'arch fur an' wide, an' dey s'arch mighty wellâ Eve she knowed, but she 'fuse fer ter tell. Ol' Satan's trail wuz all rubbed out, Ceppin' a track er two whar he walked about. Talk about troubles! Well, I bet you dey had 'emâ Adamâ Adam an' Eve an' all der kin. An' when dey got back, de gate wuz shot, An' dat wuz de pay what Adam got. In dat gyarden he went no mo'; De overseer gi' 'im a shovel an' a hoe, A mule an' plow, an' a swingletree. Talk about hard times! I bet you dey had 'emâ Adamâ An' all er his chillun, bofe slave an' free; Dey had 'emâ Bekaze er de fruit er de Appile-tree. An' de chillun er Adam, an' de chillun's kin, Dey all got smeared wid de pitch er Sin; Dey shot der eyes ter de big hereatter, An' flung Sin aroun' wid a tur'ble splatter, An' collogued wid Satan, an' dat what de matter. An' troublesâwell, I bet you dey had 'emâ Adamâ De chillun er Adam dat fergit ter prayâ Dey had 'emâ An' dey keep on a-had'n' 'em down ter dis day! But dat wa'n't de last er de Appile-tree, Kaze she scatter her seeds bofe fur an' free, An' dat's what de matter wid you an' me. I knows de feelin's what fotch on de Fall, De red Appile an' ol' Satan's callâ Lor' bless yo' soul, I knows um all!

DE 'GATER AND DE RABBIT GIZZARD Mr. Rabbit come gallopin' home fum de frolic, But a look at de creek made him feel sollumcolic, Kaze de creek in a night done turn ter a river, An' de water look so wet it make him shiver; He holler, an' holler, an' holler at de ferryâ 'Twuz run by a man which his name wuz Jerryâ But de creek so high, de ferry wa'n't dar, An' Jerry wuz treed by ol' Brer B'ar.

Kaze now I kin set right flat in my cheer, An' call back de days fum year ter yearâ An' wid no need ter call, kaze, time I sets down, Dey all comes a-flittin' an' a-flyin' 'roun', An' all wid der Sunday doin's on, An' all der troubles done clean gone, An' I sets up wid um, er I draps ter sleep, Glad fer ter git my fun so cheap; It's de same ez a frolicâfer now I know Lots better dan I know'd some fifty year ago. No shade fer me! I kin set in de sun, An' hear dem chillun, an' see um run; An' over de hills when de day is long I kin hear de plough-han's homin' song, An' in de creek bottomâgo-bing! go-bang! I kin hear de racket er de new-groun' gang, An' it seem mighty quare dat it come ter pass, Kaze chillun an' niggers is under de grassâ Dey er dar, dey er here, an' one thing sho, I never would 'a' b'lieved it fifty year ago! Little chillun die, an' you think dey er gone, An' you weep an' wail wid de mournin' on; Fambly an' frien's, dey er tooken, too, An' it seem like de reaper won't never git thoo; Bofe big an' little, bofe young an' ol', Dey all got ter answer ter de call er de roll; Dey answer an' go. Does you speck dat's all? Is de oak tree sorry when de acorns fall? Bless you, honey! I know what I know Lots better dan I did some fifty year ago. Dey all comes back, an' dey comes ter stay, An' you has um wid you bofe night an' dayâ An' I dunner whar yo' eyes ef you can't see Dem chillun a-stan'in' right at my knee, Wid shinin' eyes an' ha'r fallin' free, One little gal, an' little boys three; An' mos' eve'y day when de light gits pale I ketch myse'f a-tellin' um a tale, An' I goes on an' tells itâfer now I know Lots better dan I know'd some fifty year ago. âUnc' Remus!

THE HARD-HEADED WOMAN Now, den, honey, I tell you what, You'll be like de 'oman an' de big dinner-pot Ef yo' don't min' yo' mammy. You don't see how come it? Well, I tell you right now, you ain't fur fum it; You kin blin'fol' my eyes, an' I'll call yo' nameâ It's âHello, Mr. Hardhead! Ain't you 'shame'?â You kin grin an' twis' an' squirm an' frown, But I know yo' name by de way it soun'â Don't dull dat shoe-knife! Des put it down! Don't pester my pegs! an' des drap dat awl! You'll stick yo'se'f wid it, an' den you'll squallâ Don't fool wid my fillin's! don't scatter de tacks, You'll drap um on de flo' an' lose um in de cracksâ Don't tangle my twine, an' don't chaw up my wax! What kin you do? Why, set still a minnit, An' de way fer ter do it is ter commence an' begin it! I tell you, honey, you done got so wil' Dat nobody'll b'lieve you er Miss Sally's chil'! You wanter hear a tale? Well, you sho do skeer me! Kaze how kin you set right still an' hear me? De ol' sow done got up fum whar you knocked 'er, An' de heifer is lookin' fer ter see who rocked 'er; You er sholy ailin', an' you'll hatter see de doctor! I dunner what gwine ter happen ef dey ain't sump'n doneâ Ef you ain't rockin' creeturs, dey ain't no fun; Boys bleeze ter have funâyou say dat yo'se'f'â Er else dey mought ez well be put on de shelf. It mought er been Georgy, er Yallerbammerâ Fer de goodness' sake, put down dat hammer!â In one er de yuther dar lived a 'oman, She wuz nine parts Injun an' one part human. She lived in a wood-lot, close ter water, An' she done a heap er things what she ain't had oughterâ De neighbors say dat she done kilt her daughter! She had a bad temper, an' her clackin' tongue Wuz long an' loud an' mighty well hung. Her ol' man done de best dat he could, He split up kindlin' an' he chopped up wood; He fotch home meal an' he fotch home meat, Yit she never would cook what he wanter eat; She wuz hard-headed, honey, des like you, An' what folks wanted wuz de thing she won't do. But she'd scol' an' quoil de whole day thoo; An' she'd be contrary, an' ack like a mule, Twel de neighbors all say she's a Friday-born fool. Ef her husban' want grits she'd cook him greens, Ef he want roas' tater she'd bile 'im beans, Ef he want fried meat she'd make corn-bread, An' de pone wuz so hard 'twould 'a' broke his headâ Ef she but had 'a' hit 'im he'd 'a' done gone dead! She'd kindle a fier wid sparrer-grass, An' gi' her ol' man de wuss kinder sass. She'd burn de spar'-rib an' scorch de tripeâ When it come ter meanness she wuz good an' ripe. Her ol' man watch, an' wait, an' pray Fer de time fer ter come when she'd change her way; He spit in de ashes an' make a cross-mark, An' sump'n n'er tol' 'im fer ter wait twel dark, When de moon look pale, an' de loony-dogs bark An' put in de pot, when de big owls hoot, Some thunderwood buds an' calamus root. Well, dat night de 'oman come in kinder late, An' she slam things 'roun' like you does de gate. Atter kickin' up a rippit an' gittin' things hot, She built a big fier un' de dinner-pot; She put in some dumperlin's, likewise some peas, An' flung in a sheep-head on top er dese. De water 'gun ter bubble, an' de 'vittles it fou't, Twel de sheep-head butted de dumperlin's out, An' de peas went flyin' all 'roun' an' about. De 'oman, she strip off her homespun sack, Wid âNo matter what happen, dat pot I'll crack!â She got de ax, but de pot see her comin', An' it jump off de fier, an' des went a-hummin'; Mon, inter de woods dat pot did sneak, Beyan de branch an' way beyan de creek; It run an' run twel de 'oman get weak, An' when she got cotch wid a bamboo brier, Here come de pot wid a chunk er red fier; An' den she yell, an' den she squall, An' de pot wuz dar fer ter ketch her when she fall. An' she never come back, and de pot des laugh, A-hoppin' an' a-skippin' up de spring paff; It come, it did, an' straddle de place Whar it been settin' at; an' washed its face An' scraped off de mud an' wiped off de greaseâ An' de man eat his supper fer one time in peace. TWO TALES IN ONEâONE TALE IN TWO Folks think deyer smart, an' I speck it's so, Kaze most anybody bleeze ter know what dey know, But when you dig down ter de trufe an' all, You feel like creepin' thoo a hole in de wall, An' you don't want de hole fer ter be too wide, Kaze you want a place whar you kin hideâ Fer dat what you know mighty certain an' sho Ain't mo' dan a thimbleful ter what you ain't know. When you run yo' head in a hornets' nes' You kin say what you please an' think de res', But de ve'y fust thing dat you wanter do Is ter git up fum dar, an' shuffle yo' shoeâ Man! I wish you'd hush! You wanter git away, Dey ain't money nuff fer ter make you stay! Well, what you dunno, is got claws an' wings, It zoons in yo' year, it zoons an' stings! What! Tell you a tale dat I dunno? Is you ever hear de one 'bout Tippity-Toe? You ain't! Well, dat's mighty funny ter me, An' I speck I better tell 'bout Flee-ter-my-Kneeâ One tale in two, an' two tales in one, By de time deyer finish' deyer mighty nigh done; You'll lissen an' laugh, you'll lissen an' cry, But yo' face will be straight an' yo' eye will be dry! Dey wuz born in a well, an' dey wa'n't no doubt Dat dey couldn't fall in, so dey had ter fall out, An' de folks all say dat it sho wuz a sin Fer ter be fallin' out when dey oughter fall in; An' dey wonder'd an' wonder'd how dat kin be, An' dey hunted an' hunted fer Flee-ter-my-Knee, But he wa'n't ter be foun', ner Tippity-Toe, An' dat's how come dey ain't nobody know. An' down ter dis day, when folks settin' still, An' lookin' 'way off 'cross de creek an' de hill, An' frownin' up when dey shets der eyes, Er puttin' on specks fer ter make um look wise, Deyer wond'rin' (special ef dey rubs der chin) How it feels ter fall out when you oughter fall in; Deyer watchin' an' waitin' an' tryin' ter see Little Tippity-Toe an' Flee-ter-my-Knee. Sometimes in de night you'll hear a mouse squeal Kaze Tippity-Toe done trod on his heel, An' sometimes you'll wake an' hear de wall crack, But it's Flee-ter-my-Knee a-drivin' a tack; Dey gits in de kitchen an' makes de pans leak, An' dey creeps in de closet, an' makes de shoes screak; An' dey stops de clockâbut der purtiest trick Is ter swing on de pennel-um an' make it tick. In de middle er de night, when you hear de dog howl, An' de bullfrog grumble like he talkin' ter de owl, An' de killdee holler like he skeer'd ter death, An' de win' do like she's a-hol'in' her breath, And de moon slips along twel she fin's a cloud Fer ter hide behime, an' de geeses all crowd Close up tergedder, it's bekaze dey see Little Tippity-Toe an' Flee-ter-my-Knee. An' de katydids, wid der chatterin' song, You'd think 'twould take um all night long Fer ter tell what dey ain't do, an' what dey done, A-jawin' an' 'sputin' one by one, But, turnin' twelve, dey simmers down, An' you can't hear one fer miles aroun'. Deyer mo' dan willin' fer ter gi' do flo' Ter Flee-ter-my-Knee an' Tippity-Toe. An' chillun like you better keep der eyes skun So dey'll know what's mischief fum dat what's fun, Kaze Flee-ter-my-Knee an' Tippity-Toe Deyer watchin' you close wharsomever you goâ Wharsomever you go, whatsomever you do, Deyer wid you all day an' de whole night thoo; Dey'll raise up de kivver when youer in bed, An' pull at yo' toes an' tousel yo' head, An' you'll whimper an' groan, an' jump in yo' sleep An' be slidin' down places dat's slick an' steep, An' Rawhead-an'-Bloody-Bones 'll be drivin' his teams Bofe' backerds an' forrerds thoo all er yo' dreams! How you gwineter keep um off? Why, honey, whirl in An' try ter be goodâdes ez good ez you kin! WHY THE FROG HAS NO TAIL Now, honey, you lissen, an' keep right still, An' I'll tell you 'bout de Frog what live nigh de mill: He stayed in de pon' when he wa'n't on de bank, An' hot days he stayed whar de grass wuz rank; He liked col' water, an' he liked de sun; He wuz marked like a clown, an' full er funâ When he stood up he sot, an' he hopped when he run. Day in an' day out he wuz much de sameâ Brer Bull-Frog dey named him, an' he answer ter der name. Pop-eyed he wuz, wid no ha'r on his head, An' dey wa'n't no tellin' when he went ter bed, Kaze he'd watch all day an' beller all night, An' de creeturs all say dat dat wa'n't right; An' mo' dan dat, dey say 'twuz a shame Dat any kinder creetur shill ruin his name. Brer Bull-Frog say, âCome along! Oh, come! I ain't got nothin' but a jug er rumâ Jug-er-rum! Jug-er-rum! I'll gi' you some!â De creeturs dey say, âIt's wuss an' wuss, An' de fust news you know, he'll up an' cuss, Er he'll git so mad dat he'll swell up an' bus'.â Brer Rabbit he hear 'bout de jug er rum, An' he smack his mouf wid a Nyum-nyum-nyum! An' he study an' study how he'll git 'im a dram, An' bimeby he went on de ol' mill-dam; De water look so col' it make him shiverâ Bull-Frog say, â'Tain't col' ez de river.â De water lap-lap!âBrer Rabbit's skin creepâ Brer Bull-Frog beller, âKnee-deep! Knee-deep!â Brer Rabbit jump inâker-splish, ker-splash! An' it like ter 'a' been de las' er his hash; He fotch a snort, an' he fotch a sneeze, It made 'im cough, an' it made 'im wheezeâ He allers strangle when it's deeper dan his knees. Brer Rabbit put out, an' put out faster, An' de Frog he laugh like a bull in de pastur'. Atter dat, Brer Rabbit he watch an' wait, He riz mighty soon, an' he went ter bed late; He watch by de poplar, an' by de mill-gate. Dar wuz times when he'd laugh, an' times when he'd grinâ He wuz fixin' fer ter take dat Bull-Frog in. Well, time flickered on, an' Brer Bull-Frog 'Gun ter think 'bout gwine fum de pon' ter de bog; He wash his neck, an' wipe his feet, So de gals would think he wuz mighty sweet.

BAYLOR'S MAIL Before and during the war, and perhaps afterwards, the negroes on the Southern plantations had in use a complete system of intercommunication by means of which all kinds of intelligence could be transmitted from point to point with amazing rapidity. When Sherman swung loose from Atlanta for his march across Georgia, the fact became known to all the negroes on a plantation in middle Georgiaâand to one white personâwithin the course of twelve hours. In India, where the same system prevails, the results have been attributed to occult influences. It prevails also among the African tribes, and was introduced on the Southern plantations (as far as I can learn) by a negro named Qua, who died in Augusta, Ga., in the thirties at an extreme old age. Qua had a grandson who was nearly grown in 1800. The African name of this grandson was M'Bulu, pronounced M'Booloo, which was corrupted into Baylor. The system of intercommunication was known among the older negroes as M'Bulu Irruwanduâliterally, Baylor's waist-cloth, or breech cloutâthe means by which a signal, or a series of signals, is given in Africa. But it may be made to mean the song, the holla, or any other method by means of which intelligence is transmitted. This information is as scanty as it is unimportant, but such as it is, it is the result of an investigation covering forty years. Run, little Brothers, run!

PLANTATION PLAY-SONG (Putnam Countyâ1856.) Hit's a-gittin' mighty late w'en de Guinny-hins squall, En you better dance now, ef you gwineter dance a tall, Fer by dis time ter-morrer night you can't hardly crawl, Kaze you'll hatter take de hoe ag'in en likewise de maulâ Don't you hear dat bay colt a kickin' in his stall?

TRANSCRIPTIONS If these are adaptations from songs the negroes have caught from the whites, their origin is very remote. I have transcribed them literally, and I regard them as in the highest degree characteristic. 1. A Plantation Chant Hit's eighteen hunder'd forty-en-fo', Christ done open dat He'v'mly do'â An' I don't wanter stay yer no longer; Hit's eighteen hunder'd forty-en-five, Christ done made dat dead man aliveâ An' I don't wanter stay yer no longer. You ax me ter run home, Little childunâ Run home, dat sun done rollâ An' I don't wanter stay yer no longer. Hit's eighteen hunder'd forty-en-six, Christ is got us a place done fixâ An' I don't wanter stay yer no longer; Hit's eighteen hunder'd forty-en-sev'm Christ done sot a table in He'v'mâ An' I don't wanter stay yer no longer. You ax me ter run home, Little childunâ Run home, dat sun done rollâ An' I don't wanter stay yer no longer. Hit's eighteen hunder'd forty-en-eight, Christ done make dat crooked way straightâ An' I don't wanter stay yer no longer; Hit's eighteen hunder'd forty-en-nine, Christ done tu'n dat water inter wineâ An' I don't wanter stay yer no longer. You ax me ter run home, Little childunâ Run home, dat sun done rollâ An' I don't wanter stay yer no longer. Hit's eighteen hunder'd forty-en-ten, Christ is de mo'ner's onliest frien'â An' I don't wanter stay yer no longer; Hit's eighteen hunder'd forty-en-'lev'm, Christ'll be at de do' w'en we all git ter He'v'mâ An' I don't wanter stay yer no longer. You ax me ter run home, Little childunâ Run home, dat sun done rollâ An' I don't wanter stay yer no longer. 2. A Plantation Serenade De ole bee make de honey-comb, De young bee make de honey, De niggers make de cotton en co'n, En de w'ite folks gits de money. De raccoon he's a cu'us man, He never walk twel dark, En nuthin' never 'sturbs his min', Twel he hear ole Bringer bark. De raccoon totes a bushy tail, De 'possum totes no ha'r, Mr. Rabbit, he come skippin' by, He ain't got none ter spar'. Monday mornin' break er day, W'ite folks got me gwine, But Sat'd'y night, w'en de sun goes down, Dat yaller gal's in my mine. Fifteen poun' er meat a week, W'isky fer ter sell, Oh, how can a young man stay at home, Dem gals dey look so well? Met a 'possum in de roadâ Brer 'Possum, whar you gwine? I thank my stars, I bless my life, I'm a-huntin' fer de muscadine. DE BIG BETHEL CHURCH De Big Bethel chu'ch! de Big Bethel chu'ch! Done put ole Satun behin' um; Ef a sinner git loose fum enny udder chu'ch, De Big Bethel chu'ch will fin' um! Hit's good ter be dere, en its sweet ter be dere, Wid de sisterin all aroun' youâ A-shakin' dem shackles er mussy en love Wharwid de Lord is boun' you. Hit's sweet ter be dere en lissen ter de hymes, En hear dem mo'ners a-shoutin'â Dey done reach de place whar der ain't no room Fer enny mo' weepin' en doubtin'. Hit's good ter be dere w'en de sinners all jine Wid de brudderin in dere singin', En it look like Gaberl gwine ter rack up en blow En set dem heav'm bells ter ringin'! Oh, de Big Bethel chu'ch! de Big Bethel chu'ch, Done put ole Satun behin' um; Ef a sinner git loose fum enny udder chu'ch De Big Bethel chu'ch will fin' um! TIME GOES BY TURNS Dar's a pow'ful rassle 'twix de Good en de Bad, En de Bad's got de all-under holt; En w'en de wuss come, she come i'on-clad, En you hatter hole yo' bref fer de jolt. But des todes de las' Good gits de knee-lock, En dey draps ter de groun' ker flop! Good had de inturn, en he stan' like a rock, En he bleedzd fer ter be on top. De dry wedder breaks wid a big thunder-clap, Fer dey ain't no drout' w'at kin las', But de seasons w'at whoops up de cotton crap, Likewise dey freshens up de grass. De rain fall so saf' in de long dark night, Twel you hatter hol' yo' han' fer a sign, But de drizzle w'at sets de tater-slips right Is de makin' er de May-pop vine. In de mellerest groun' de clay root'll ketch En hole ter de tongue er de plow, En a pine-pole gate at de gyardin-patch Never'll keep out de ole brindle cow. One en all on us knows who's a-pullin' at de bits Like de lead-mule dat guides by de rein, En yit, somehow er nudder, de bestest un us gits Mighty sick er de tuggin' at de chain. Hump yo'se'f ter de load en fergit de distress, En dem w'at stan's by ter scoff, Fer de harder de pullin', de longer de res', En de bigger de feed in de troff. A HOWDY SONG Prelude Ef I could coax dat baby Fer ter git upon my knee I'd up an' sing my howdy song, I'd sing it loud an' free: I'm gittin' ol' an' po'ly, But I ain't fergit de song, Kaze I use ter shake de rafters When de nights wuz gittin' long: He'd do a sight er laughin' An' den he'd kinder smile, But 'fo' you counted twenty, He'd be sleepin' by de mile! I know I use ter sing it Ter one little boy I know'd, An' I seem ter see him comin' When I look 'way down de road! I'd take 'im an' I'd rock 'im Twel his eyeleds settled down, An' he'd soon be gwine off yander On de stage ter Sleepy Town! An' de dreams would be a-blowin' Thoo his little curly head, An' he'd try ter pull at de kivver Des like he gone ter bed! The Song It's howdy, honey, when you laugh, An' howdy, when you cry, An' all day long its howdyâ I never shill say good-bye! I'm monst'us peart myse'f, suh, An' hopin' de same fer you, An' when I ketch my breff, suh, I'll ax you howdy-do! It's howdy, honey, when you sleep, It's howdy, when you cry; Keep up, keep up de howdyin' Don't never say good-bye! I'm middlin' well myse'f, suh, Which de same I hope fer you; Ef you'll le' me ketch my breff, suh, I'll ax you howdy-do!</field>
