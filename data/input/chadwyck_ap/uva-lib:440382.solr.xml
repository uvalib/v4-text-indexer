      <field name="fulltext">“Of all dear Nature's welcomings, which greet Her lover, when he seeks her fastnesses, Music of breeze, brook, bird, and happy trees,— The voice of flowing water is most sweet.” THE BALLAD OF THE BRONX. In sixteen hundred and thirty-nine— Back in the foggy past how far! Jonas Bronck, of an old Dutch line, Being the earliest white grantee Under the Sachems of Ranacque— Owned the land, by unquestioned claim Later known by the lordly name Of “the Manor of Morrisania;” Then it was “Bronck's land”—and that is why The little river that eddied by, (Which every one who beholds it, knows Is the crookedest river that ever froze) Twisting and doubling along its way, Received the name that it bears to-day; “Bronck's,” not “Bronx,” did they call it then, All who knew it, with tongue and pen— And no historian knows or recks— Not even Bolton has tried to guess— When the river took on the puzzling “x” Instead of the ancient “c k s.” Of Jonas Bronck there is little trace, He left no child in his name or place, His widow alone was his legatee— Antonia Slaghboom she used to be When she was called by her maiden name, In far-off Holland, whence she came; And when in his portly prime, he died, His lonesome widow became the bride Of another Dutchman, whose lordlier name Arendt von Curler—is known to fame In “Curls” and “Corlears” up and down, Though few remember his old renown. Jonas Bronck was a man of tact, Wise to purpose and prompt to act, And though so short was his earthly span, The way he managed his forest tract Proved him a sharp and thrifty man. Thus said he to Peter Andriessen And Laurent Dayts—two poorer men. “I lease you a certain lot of land Which stretches over against the plain And the river, also, of Manhattan, And from these acres, on every hand, You shall drive the wild-cats and clear the trees, And stumps and bushes; and if you please, When nature is conquered by ax and blaze, Shall plant tobacco, and likewise maize, And reap what profit you may and can, On this condition, you understand, That each two years you shall clear still more Of new wild space in this rough domain, While all you have cleared and tilled before Comes back to me, Jonas Bronck, again; And these wide reaches of fruitful ground In proper order shall all be found For me to harrow and sow with grain.” How wisely the wily Jonas planned, Thus, with no effort of foot or hand, But only work of a nimble brain, To make smooth acres of waste wild land! Then, 'tis said—in the olden days Ere Jonas Bronck and his wife were dreams, While still they lived on their manor here, And counted their acres, and made good cheer, Wild-cats prowled in the forest ways And rattlers hid in the boulders' seams— But nothing fiercer than meadow-mouse, Or woodchuck, musing on stone or stump, Or mole, half out of his burrowed house, Or rabbit, fleeing with flirt and jump, Or squirrel frisking on walnut bough, Is seen in the winding valley now. Sometimes there glides from a clump of brake The graceful and harmless garter-snake, And his delicate stripes and diamond eye Gleam a moment, and hurry by; Or, rarelier still, when the stroller strays Farther away from trodden ways, A racer flashes across his view, And vanishes in a streak of blue. Once, the river's secluded bends Were happy homes of the sensitive trout, Till man, who, bent upon gainful ends, Shows no mercy and spares no friends, Sullied the waters and drove him out. Fair, indeed, is the rambling stream Where'er it wanders, with glint and gleam, By hill and hollow, by field and wood— Save where, intrusive, and loud and rude, Some sordid village has grown beside Its erst transparent and peaceful tide, Despoiled its margin, and dared profane Its virgin pureness with sewer and drain; Defiled with refuse its crystal deeps, Blasphemed its beauty with rubbish-heaps, And bent its force to the selfish will Of dirty factory or noisy mill; With these it labors and frets a while, And then escaping with bound and smile, Again it follows its sinuous quest, Now to the east and now to the west, By sloping meadow, by cliff and wood, In search of shadow and solitude, Eager to find, past stain and stress, In the cleansing power of loneliness, Its early clearness and purity, Ere it shall reach its love, the sea. Yet, spite of changes, there still remain Pleasant reaches, by dale and plain, Where one may follow the beckoning stream, And study its beauty, and muse and dream— Or haply stumble, before he knows Into a circle of charmed repose, Stillest and sweetest of bosky dells, Rich with earthy and mossy smells, Where foot of stroller but rarely comes. Where the cuckoo calls, and the high-hole drums, And ferns that shrink from the day's broad glare Spread their fronds in the moist still air, And white-hearts venture their trembling bells, Sure no tempest can reach them there, And long-stemmed violets keep their dew All the shivery spring day through, And scarlet columbines, tipped with gold, Laugh at the wind and dare the cold. Many a stretch of level green The river borders with glancing sheen Where young calves gambol, and serious cows Watch indulgently, while they browse, Or stand knee-deep in a shallow pool Under the shadows dim and cool; Where in their season, shoot thickly up The dandelion and buttercup, And ox-eyes, spared by the grazing herd, Dance to the piping of breeze and bird, And later, the opulent golden-rod Scatters its sunny wealth abroad; And when in the seedy grass appear The amber tints of the ripening year, The brave and delicate asters dare The threatening hint of the chilly air, And fill the corners that scaped the mower With sudden beauty unknown before, Smoke-like cloudings of tender hue, Lavender, purple, and pearl and white, Palest lilac and skyey blue Dim and vague in the hazy light. Many a pasture and field it sees Dappled with shade of graceful trees— Where wild black-cherry, when May is young, With fragrant tassels of white is hung, Which later sunshine and rain transmute To strings of bitter and bony fruit Beloved of birds; and the oaks in spring Put out their tender and downy leaves Of pinky velvet, all soft and fine, Like furry ears of some living thing; And eager woodbine, with clasp and twine Round gnarly branches and rugged bole, Its curtain of sheltering foliage weaves, Hiding the owl's dark nesting-hole, And the garrulous flicker's lofty home, Or veiling close, till no eye perceives, The cleft where the wild-bee builds her comb. There in autumn the sumacs don The richest colors that leaves put on, Scarlet, golden and carmine hues Meet and mingle and interfuse, Till ledgy hillside and pasture gleam Mellow and warm as an artist's dream— Their frond-like foliage crimson-crowned With woolly berries packed close and firm, And never once in their ranks is found A single cluster without a worm. There dogwood blossoms, with broad, bright eye Stare straight up at the April sky, And the resonant voice of the thrush is heard Through all the earlier summer days, And powdery pendants of chestnut bloom Swing and scatter their strange perfume, And the slim hop-hornbeam's limber sprays Tremble under the tiniest bird, And the drooping wreaths of the locust tree Load the wind with their fragrancy, And sassafras, with a hundred shoots Sprouting up from its spicy roots, Which wakens early and blossoms bold Or ever its leaves have dared unfold; Then, taking thought, with untimely care Dons its mittens for summer wear— And the pepperidge and the sweet birch grow, And hickory, that the squirrels know, And big broad leaves of the bass-wood tree Whose flowers smell like a honey-bee— The weird witch-hazel, with magic spell, That loves the frost and the cruel cold, And in November, puts bravely on Its fragile blossoms of tender gold After its latest leaf is gone— The kind horse-chestnut, with outspread hand, And many another that loves to dwell In the woodsy edges of cultured land. Sometimes the river, that loves to glide Where sunshine, flowers and mirth abide, Goes hurrying past a shelving ledge Rising steep from the meadow's edge, Girt with brambles, a barren height, Lonely, spite of the water's tune, Gloomy, spite of the noonday light, Arid and bloomless, even in June, Whereon there clusters, as set apart From all the gladness of nature's heart, A group of sorrowful savin-trees, Dense with shadows and mysteries, Which love not laughter, nor happy song, But murmur, murmur, the whole day long, In mournful garments, like those who brood On some old anguish, in solitude— And the river answers, and hurries by In search of merrier company. Sometimes, a frolicksome thing at play, It laughs and gurgles along its way, Bounds and bubbles and foams and sings, With braided currents and whirling rings— Then, sobered suddenly, where it sees A bridge defying its boundaries, Sends softly back from its mirror clear A visible echo of arch and pier, Of dipping bushes and oak-tree's crest— A drowsy picture of peace and rest. Fair, indeed, is the zigzag stream With playful eddy and changeful gleam, Wherever it wanders free and wild, Idle and gay, like a truant child— Whether where tall trees shade its brink And shy birds warble, and pause to drink, And the wilful grape-vine grips and clings— Sweetest of all sweet vernal things In early May, when it shyly flowers, And sheds a fragrance that almost seems Wafted down from some realm of dreams Far from this humdrum world of ours— Mounts to the topmost branch, and there Winds and tangles and hangs and swings, Ripening its fruit in the light and air, Sparse black clusters of keenest sour, Far from the boldest climber's power, Out of the reach of all but wings— Or whether it slowly winds and creeps Past marshy flats, where the tortoise sleeps, Where muskrats paddle, and frogs abide And fearless, anchor their clustered eggs, Where skaters circle, and dart, and glide, And tadpoles wriggle, and wait for legs— And strong sharp grasses, which cut like knives, Shoot up and bourgeon with downy plume, And worlds of reptile and insect lives Bask and thrive in the moist warm air— Blest existence, without a care Or grief to sadden, or dream to mock! Where bladderwort and the spearmint bloom, And the arrow-head, and the spatter-dock, With scores of other bibulous things Which love the presence of oozy springs And boggy hollows, and gladly flock Where lazy rivers are warm and slow, Tired, mayhap, with their long wild race, And finding Swampland a pleasant place Ponder whether to stay or go. Anon it wanders in hollows dim Past fallen tree-trunks and riven limb, Where the hemlocks spread their arms so wide They meet the boughs on the other side, And even noonday is cool and dark— Where willows dip in the purling tide, And spotted sycamore sheds its bark, And (since the loveliest spots must bear Some trace of evil, however fair) The poison ivy, with venomed clutch Grasps at the wanderer passing there— And tall lobelia with spikes of blue Heightens the cardinal's vivid hue, And the jewel-weed's translucent stems Are hung with flowers like pensile gems, And petulant pods, that snap and fly And scatter their seeds at the lightest touch. But who shall reckon the whole sweet list Of lovely places it wanders through, Now dark with shadow, now sunlight-kissed, Now skirting towns and now lost in woods, This pleasant river of many moods Which Jonas Bronck and Antonia knew? Four years only did Jonas dwell On the virgin manor he loved so well; Four years only he saw the soil Growing smooth by his tenants' toil; Four years only he watched the flow Of the river doubling to and fro, And then he yielded to austere fate And left his widow his real estate, Whence, not long after, the record stands, It passed to Arendt von Curler's hands. But still, recalling his ancient claim, The faithful river retains his name; The urchin whispers it, when he steals From work or lessons to fish for eels; His sister breathes it, who seeks its brink For freckled lily and bright rock-pink; The wild-goose shouts it, as soaring high She sails at night through the listening sky; And even the frogs, who love to dwell In its deepest gullies, have kept it well; And many a time when the summer eves Melt softly into the haunted night, When sweet airs whisper among the leaves, And the moon dim-silvers vale and height, When the tree-toads trill and the crickets sing, And the world is resting from toil and jar— When night-hawks circle on silent wing, To spy where the sleeping nestlings are— When katydids are in every tree, And the watch-dog's bark sounds faint and far From village kennel or distant farm, And the river slumbers peacefully In mystic quiet—so still and calm That it mirrors the smile of the even-star— Then the screech-owl, high in the blasted oak, Screams “Jo-o-o-nas! Jo-o-o-nas!” for all her song, And deep in the waters, the bull-frogs croak “Bronck! Bronck! Bronck! Bronck!” the whole night long. So, though from all human memory In the hurry and rush of future time, May perish the name of the old grantee, And even this poor remembering rhyme May be forgotten, may fade and fail— Still, long as the wild-geese fly by night, And greet, in passing, the river's gleam, A zigzag crinkle of silver light— And the bull-frogs boom, and the screech-owls wail, His name will linger, a midnight dream In the shadowy depths of the winding vale Where wanders, faithful in time's despite, The haunted tide of his namesake stream. Elizabeth Akers.</field>
