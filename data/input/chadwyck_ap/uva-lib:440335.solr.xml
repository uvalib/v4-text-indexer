      <field name="fulltext">THE MUSIC-LESSON OF CONFUCIUS. THE music-lesson of Koung-tseu the wise, Known as Confucius in the western world. Of all the sages of the Flowery Land None knew so well as great Confucius The ancient rites; and when his mother died, Three years he mourned alone beside her tomb As the Old Custom bade, nor did he miss A single detail of the dark old forms Required of the bereaved, for he had made Himself a model for all living men: A mirror and a pattern of the Past. Now when the years of mourning with their rites Were at an end, Confucius came forth And wandered as of old with other men, Giving his counsel unto many kings; But still the hand of grief was on his heart, And his dark hue set forth his darkened hours. To drive away these sorrows from his soul, Remembering that music had been made A moral motive in the golden books Of wisdom by the sacred ancestors, He played upon the Kinâthe curious lute Invented by Fou-Hi in days of old; Fou-Hi of the bull's head and dragon's form, The Lord of Learning who upraised mankind From being silent brutes to singing men. In vain Confucius played upon the lute; He found that music would not be to him What it had been of oldâa pastime gay: For he had borne through three long years of grief Stupendous knowledge, and his mighty soul, Grasping the lines which link all earthly lore, Had been by suffering raised to greater power: For he who knows and suffers, if he will May raise himself unnumbered scales o'er man. The music spoke no more its wonted sounds, But whispered mysteries in a broken tongue Which urged him sorely. Then Confucius said: âO secret Music! sacred tongue of God! I hear thee calling to me, and I come! Of old I did but know thy outer form And dreamed not of the spirit hid within; The Goddess in the Lotus. Yes, I come, And will not restânor will I calm my doubt Till I have seen thee plainly with mine eyes, And palpably have touched thee with my hand, Then shall I know theeâraised to life for me For what thou truly art. Lo! I have heard That in the land of Kin a master lives, So deeply skilled in music, that mankind Begin again to give a glowing faith Unto the golden stories which are told Of the strange harmonies which built the world, And of the melody whose key is God. Now I will travel to the land of Kin, And know this sage of music, great Siang, And learn the secret lore which hides within All sweet well-ordered sounds.â He went his way, Nor rested till he stood before the man. Thus spoke Siang unto Confucius: âOf all the arts, great Music is the art To raise the soul above all earthly storms; For in it lies that purest harmony Which lifts us over self and up to God. Thou who hast studied deeply the KouÃ â The eight great symbols of created thingsâ Knowest the sacred power of the line Which when unbroken flies to all the worlds As light unendingâbut in broken forms Falls short as sky and earth, clouds, winds, and fire, The deep blue ocean and the mountain high, And the red lightning hissing in the wave. The mighty law which formed what thou canst see, As clearly lives in all that thou canst hear, And more than this, in all that thou canst feel. Here, take thy lute in hand. I teach the air Made by the sage Wen Wang of ancient days.â Confucius took the lute and played the air Till all his soul seemed passing into song; Then he fell deep into the solemn chords As though his body and the lute were one, And every chord a wave which bore him on Through the great sea of ecstasy. His hands Then ceased to playâbut in his raptured look They saw him following out the harmony. Five days went by, and still Confucius Played all day long the ancient simple air; And when Siang would teach him more, he said: âNot yet, my master, I would seize the thought, The subtle thought which hides within the tune.â To which the master answered: âIt is well. Take five days more!â And when the time was passed Unto Siang thus spoke Confucius: âI do begin to seeâyet what I see Is very dim. I am as one who looks And nothing sees except a luminous cloud: Give me but five more days, and at the end If I have not attained the great idea Hidden of old within the melody, I will leave music as beyond my power.â âDo as thou wilt, Oh pupil!â cried Siang In deepest admiration; ânever yet Had I a scholar who was like to thee.â And on the fifteenth day Confucius rose And stood before Siang, and cried aloud: âThe mist which shadowed me is blown away, I am as one who stands upon a cliff And gazes far and wide upon the world, For I have mastered every secret thought, Yea, every shadow of a feeling dim Which flitted through the spirit of Wen Wang When he composed that air. I speak to him, I hear him clearly answer me again; And more than thatâI see his very form: A man of middle stature, with a hue Half blended with the dark and with the fair; His features longâand large sweet eyes which beam With great benevolenceâa noble face! His voice is deep and full, and all his air Inspires a sense of virtue and of love. I know that I behold the very man, The sage of ancient days, Wen Wang the just.â Then good Siang lay down upon the dust, And said: âThou art my master. Even thus The ancient legend, known to none but me, Describes our first great sire. And thou hast seen That which I never yet myself beheld, Though I have played the sacred song for years, Striving with all my soul to penetrate Its mystery unto the master's form, Whilst thou hast reached it at a single bound:â Henceforth the gods alone can teach thee tune.â THE RETURN OF THE GODS. âGreece so thoroughly wrought out its conception of the beautiful human animal as to make an idol of it, and in order to glorify it on earth they made a divinity of it in heaven.ââ The Philosophy of Art, by H. Taine. LIKE one who looks over a city when day is beginning to break, I look o'er the million-homed age where we live, in the dusk of the dawn, Seeing the sunlight on steeples, or edging the turrets and towers, While the streets and the low-lying houses are grey in the gloaming or gloom. Light in the eye of the thinker; light on the brow of the wise, Dimmering shade in the spirit of him who is hopeless and low. But far on the fire-flashing mountains which circle the town of the time Flame brighter and higher the glories, though deeper and grander the gloom. Like gods freshly set on the summits, just resting a moment, but soon To sweep down the sides to the valleys, and conquer the giants of night. Yes, they are coming in glory again to resplendour the world, The gods whom we thought were long-perished: Olympus is coming again. In the roar of the terrible engine, in boats which go onward by steam, Or the pathways of iron extending from ocean to ocean unbent, In bridges once buried, deep hidden, now binding the summits of cliffs; In wheels which are whirling for ever to multiply comfort for man: All this but the little beginningâall this but the mustard-seed small; When all is unfolded, oh Vulcan, wilt thou not be with us again? When Genius in infinite channels, when Labour with infinite might Shall have solved all the problems we dream of, while solving, creating anew; When the branches while further diverging send quicker the sap to the root And the highest adventurous blossom feels deepest its part in the whole, Will Man then believe in his power, and, scorning the petty and vile, Be grand in his power creative and Vulcan be with us again? Phul KhanâTubal Cainâthe Fire Monarchâfirst king and first master of Iron! They could not dispense with the blacksmith, the smith who by right was a god And the right-hand of every warrior, yes, even the master of Mars; But they shamed him and lamed him, those proud ones, and punished him with his reward. Now he cometh, he cometh in glory, his lameness and shame are removed, And Art in its union with Beauty shines brighter with Honour and Pride. Venus, the life of the lovelyâsoul of the exquisite charm! Thou hast done penance for ages, as we thy poor children have done. Short was the carnival season in the gay god-land of Greece, Few were the guests at the banquet,âbrief was the life of the flowers, Long was the Lent which came after,âbitter the wailing and woe;â But the trial was good for the mourners,âit humbled the cruel and proud, It raised up the humble and fallen,âgave spirit and strength to the poor, And is freeing from slavery Woman,âthe slave of all ages gone by. Enough of the sackcloth and ashes,âenough of the penance and pain, Enough of deep woe for the Many and feverish joy for the Few; Joy which defeats its own wishes and struggles in hard narrow rounds Ignoring the truth that great Pleasure demands the great concourse of All. Oh, Mother of rapture and Beautyâthou too hast done penance in grief, Thou did'st rise from the Ocean in glory, red glowing to kiss the warm sun! Short were the luscious embracesâcold blew the wind from the North, Thou fell'st in sad tears from Heaven, and on earth wert a torrent of tears. Now in comfort, with justice and beauty and freedom for woman and man, Thou wilt rise in a rosier glory, and light every soul with a ray. For when Man shall have learned that the spirit of Sin is but trespass and pain, Trespass and pain on his fellow, or idle neglect of his own, And that Pleasure which injures none other and wounds not the spirit of truth, Has nothing in common with Evil and touches none other but Self, Then thou wilt be with us, sweet Mother, and charm every soul with thy smile, Raising to Art all our labourâand Love be the life of the world. Mars, the magnificent master of warfare with foes to the gods, Brilliant and bold and unbending thou too wilt rise on with the rest, For the progress of Man is the progress of gods in the infinite scale, He who lifts up the spear to do battle lifts also the pennon and steel. And though the point shine in the sunlight or gleam in the glory of war, Far over the head of the knight, it must wait till the wood has been raised. While Man is deep buried in valleys his gods live on mountains above, When he reaches the silvery summits they dwell in the gold of the sky. No more the Messiah of Murder will Mars be the terror of Man, No longer the dread of the lowly, the bravo exulting in blood. For in the great Fight of the Future our foes will be mightier far Than men of mere sinew and muscle,âthose foes which lie silent around;â The rugged rock-giants denying the room for existence to all, The awful deep Dragon of Ocean still keeping in secret its plains, And the solemn blue space yet unconquered which parts us from numberless stars, And the Fire-Land which burns in our centre,âthese foes still await thee, oh Mars! For the doctor who drives out diseases or shortens the power of death, And the teacher who quickens the spirit and conquers the darkness of crime, The poet who blesses with beauty the soul which was gloomy and grey, The builder, the chemist, the workman, are warriors each in their way: For what were the Jotuns and Titans o'erwhelmed by the gods of the Past But the forces of fire and of mountains,âthe giants we are fighting to-day? Fighting more bravely than everâfighting with better success:â Oh Mars, thou wert in the first battleâin the victory be by our side! I know that the swift-footed Hermes will soon be beloved again, For already Man finds with strange rapture he holds more than Mercury's power, More than the might which was fabled to be that of Hermes of old, When he touches the telegraph deftly and talks over oceans afar, As we go faster in motion; faster in thought and in speech, Quicker in means of conveying and shortening the path of ideas Life will be lengthened while growing, for Thought is the measure of life: He who speaks or does most in a little is Mercury's son and himself. And with Labour and Love and with Conquest and Speed all the rest will be won, With Vulcan and Venus, and Ares, and Hermes fast darting afar: For Apollo with Muses and Gracesâthe exquisite children of Artâ And the sense of the Lovely in Nature as shown in a myriad gods, All these are just hovering round us, awaiting a place in our hearts, Not as wearied-out forms of a worship which faded long ages ago, But as the fresh life of all worship, renewed in Man's faith in himself: The Man who has risen to Greatness was never yet wanting in gods. Do your hearts enter into my meaning, ye thinkers who list to my song? Do you feel that we come to religion in quitting the vulgar and mean? And that Man when he lives in the glory of conquest and knows he is great Soon learns that the power of crushing the Time-worn means thisâto be free, Freedom with power creative, Greatness with Beauty and Love, Was, is, and shall be for ever, the Godlike in spirit and truth. And be it in smoke upon Sinai, in temples and statues in Greece, Or walking by Galilee's waters, the noble is ever a god. Grander than Plato or Hegel, greater than Bacon or Comte, Is faith in a noble endeavour, the power to rise to the New: And the scorn of the ancient Egyptian; of Hermes, for those who but live For idle self-will and dull pleasureâthe million who nothing create, In the downward-born elements whirling away from the centre of Godâ Is the first of the wonderful chapter, long written and yet to be writ, Which told and will tell how the dawning drove darkness away from the world, And how the small sneer of the Devil was lost in God's infinite smile. This is the coming of Zeusâof Jove, the imperial lord! And of Juno his wife and his sisterâthe greatest are ever akinâ That Man shall find out he is nobleâthis knowing he finds out a god And the glory of God will be with him when dignity blesses his life. Esculapius teaches the lessonâthe purest of blood are most free, In strains without taint of disorder the nearest come ever more near: The souls which live Jove-like in calmness progress in perfecting their type; What Satan and folly have hidden, will rise in the ages to come. âHow shall we see the Immortals, and when shall we know they are come? In Greece we beheld them in statuesâunmoving immortals in stone: Closed in a book in Judeaâfrozen and centred in One, Blooming again into Many which flowed from the mythical Three, And burst into wide-flashing rainbows of colour and legend and song When the wonderful age mediÃ¦val threw pictures all over the world?ââ Not in statues or books or in pictures, or churches or legends or song Will ye see the great gods of your worship whose footsteps are sounding afar. Ah no;âin yourselves will ye see them, when Venus shall favour your love, And man, fitly mated with woman, believes that his love is divine: When Passion shall elevate Woman to something so holy and grand, That sheâthe ideal enrapturedâshall ne'er be a check upon Man, Then the children they bear will be holy, and Beauty shall make them her own, And Man in the eyes of his neighbour will gaze on the reflex divine Of the God he inclines to in spiritâor trace in each feature and limb The lines which the body inherits from souls which are noble and true. Would thou could'st feel in deep earnest, how beautiful God will be then, When we see him as Jove or Apollo in men who inspire us with love, As Juno and Venus the holy, in women who know not the mean, And feel not the influence cruel of hardness and self-love and scorn. Would thou could'st once know how real the presence of God will become, How earnest and ever more earnest thy faith when thyself shall be great, And from the true worship of others thou'lt learn what is holy in them, And rise to the infinite fountain of glory which flows in us all. But when shall we see the Immortals?âbelieve meâwhenever ye will They are near us, around us, within us, awaiting our wish and our word. More than thy dreams ever pictured, more than thy heart ever dreamed, Will pour in increasing abundance on him who has freedom and faith; Freedom from meanness and harshnessâfaith in the Godhood withinâ The ore lies before us in mountainsâwe've power to change it to gold:â Be to thyself what thou lovest, and others will be unto thee What thou wilt. When in God thou believest near God thou wilt certainly be! ON MOUNT MERU. Will the time come when man, the all-conquering, shall lay his hand on the past as on a weapon and say, with it in his terrible grasp, to the future, âBe thou my slaveâ? IN earliest ages on Mount Meru Stood together and talked, the Two. Gazing far from the golden berg, The DÃ¦mon spoke to the Demiurg. âAll is beautiful, all is true; Ocean and sky with their blending blue. âAll that wends from its type at will Is found in some higher harmony still. âLeaves deformed on the twig I see, But all meet well in the spreading tree. âAll is beautiful, all is fit, One creature alone seems wrong in itâ âThe creature Man, the being accurst, Unstable, unmeeting,âthe weakest and worst. âAll things together seem fitly grown, But that monster wanders unplaced and alone.â Infinite worlds at the music woke When to the DÃ¦mon the Maker spoke. âThine is the mission with pain and strife, To labour that death may awake to life. âEver denying, destroying,âthe fight Turns falsehood and darkness to truth and light. âBut all the battles thy craft e'er span Will be naught to thy strife with that creature Man. âFor he alone in creation's range Possesses the endless power of change. âAnd when the tortures of change are past, He will conquer all things and thee at last.â Infinite worlds at the jarring stirred, When the first-born laughter in life was heard. And the DÃ¦mon laughed: âThou hast given me skill To strengthen life with power to kill; âAnd may I die in my own wild wrath If I force not Man to a single path! âMy own full power I never have seen To show what agony, suffering, mean; âAnd all my power together I'll draw, But Man shall walk in a single law.â In later ages on Mount Meru, Again time gazed on the fearful Two. Slowly the centuries ebbed away: At the foot of the Maker the DÃ¦mon lay. Adown his head the Denier bent: âI have worked in all thingsâmy course is spentâ âAnd Manâthy creatureâhas conquered me For everâVicisti GalilÃ¦!â DE APIBUS MORTEM DOMINÃ LUGENTIBUS THE sky is grim, the air is grey, There is no gossamer on the grass; In shadows dim the vine-leaves swing, Softly browning and goldening, And curling aside that the grapes may pass; The grapes which all summer were lurking unseen, Green themselves in their drapery green. Now they are purple and scented sweet, And hang like bags of unmade wine: Long may they hang, for they never will greet Again in the morning that form divine Of a beautiful girl now dead and gone, Whose hands should have pressed From each purple breast Wine royal,âthe Porphyrogeniton. So still and strange! So grave and slow! It seems as if all things must ever be so In a world which only spirits know; Is that a sound In the garden's bound Or a sigh just dreamed, So soft and low? Yesâit is comingâa wondrous humming, A weirdly, mournful Elfin drumming, Rising and dying, Then silent lying; The saddest sound upon earth below A murmur of grief for a maiden gone, And the bees are mourning Melittion. There was no human eye to weep When the lonely girl laid down to sleep And die,âa humble Dacian slave, Far cast by warâinto a grave. Yet she was ever good and mild, And softer spoken than a child; And when her daily work was done She loved to wander by the corn Singing, yet understood by none, A murmuring lay Which died away In a sigh forlorn. Then rose in a melody sweet and warm, Buzzing and humming quaintly dull, Droning and rolling and wonderful Whispering, hushing, lulling, soft In solemn tones and dying thrills, Honeyed and hive-like, fading oft Like a twilight song from distant hills. And as she sang, with waving arm, If they asked her what the song might be, She said it was called the Wild Bee's Charm, And her mother sang it beyond the sea, And the Spirit Ladies who flit through the corn Had taught her of old the melody. Twilight and eve They murmur and grieve, Humming and drumming mournfully, Wailingâfor they have lost their head, And the Dacian Queen-Bee Girl is dead. DE SPIRIDIONE EPISCOPO. THIS is the story of Spiridion, Bishop of Cyprus by the grace of God, Told by Ruffinus in his history. A fair and stately lady was IrÃ©ne, Spiridion's daughter, and in all the land Was none so proud, if that indeed be pride, The haughty conscience of great truthfulness Which makes the spirit faithful unto death And martyrdom itself a little thing. There came a stranger to Spiridion, A wealthy merchant from the Syrian land, Who, greeting, said, âGood father, I have here A golden casket filled with Roman coin, And Eastern gems of cost uncountable. Great are the dangers of the rocky road, False as a serpent is the purple sea, And he who carries wealth in foreign lands Carries his death too often near his heart, And finds life's poison where he hoped to find Against its pains a pleasant antidote. I pray you keep for me these gems in trust And give them to me when I come again.â Spiridion listened with a friendly smile, And answered thus the dark-browed Syrian: âHere is a better guardian of gold:â My daughter, Sir. The people round about Are wont to say that if she broke her faith Silver and gold themselves would lose their shine. She is our island's trusty treasurer:ââ âThen,â said the Syrian, âshe shall be mine As well as theirsââand saying this he gave The casket with the jewels to her hand. Then thoughtfully the lady answered him, As one who slowly turns some curious thought, And as they sometimes speak who prophesy:â âSir, you have called this treasure life and death, Which in your Eastern lore, as I have read, Is the great symbol of the deity, And the most potent spell to sway the world. With life to death I'll guard the gems for you, And dead or living give them back again.â Now, while the merchant went to distant Rome The fair IrenÃ© died a sudden death, And all the land went mourning for the maid; And on the roads and in the palaces Was one long wail for her by night and day. While thus they grieved the Syrian came again, And after fit delay, in proper time Went to the father:âto Spiridion; Condoling with him on his daughter's death In many a sad and gentle Eastern phrase Deep tinctured with a strange philosophy. Now, when they had awhile consumed their grief, Outspoke the Bishop: âSyrian, it is well If this sad death be not more sad for us Than thou hast dreamed of.â Here he checked his speech, And then, as if in utter agony, Burst forth with: âShe is goneâand all thy store, It too is goneâShe only, upon earth, Knew where 'twas hidden, and she trusted none: Oh, God be merciful! what shall I do?â Then on him gravely looked the Syrian With grand calm mien, as almost pitying, And said, âOh, father,âcan this be thy faith? Man of the West, how little did'st thou know The wondrous nature of that girl now dead! Hast thou not heard that they who once become Faithful to death are masters over death, And here and there on earth a woman lives Whose eyes proclaim the mighty Victory won? Give me thy hand, and lead me to the deadâ Thou know'st it is not all of death to die.â He took his hand, and led him to the bier, And they beheld the Beautiful in Death, The perfect loveliness of Grecian form, Inspired by Egypt's solemn mystery: A single pause in the eternity Of Present, Past, and Future all in one. Awhile they stood and gazed upon the dead, And then Spiridion spoke as one inspired: âOh God! thou wert our witnessâmake it know!â He paused in solemn awe, for at the word There came an awful sign. The dead white hand Was lifted, and IrenÃ©'s eyes unclosed, Beaming with light as only angels beam, And from the cold white lips there came a voice: âThe gems lie hidden in the garden wall; God bless thee, father, for thy constant love! God bless thee, Syrian, for thy faith in me!â This is the story of Spiridion, And of his daughter, faithful unto death. POEMS OF PERFUMES. EAU DE COLOGNE. THE beautiful Queen of Hungary, A sad and weary woman was she, Since for many weeks a terrible pain Seemed burning and darting through her brain. Long were the nights, for little she slept; Longer the days, for all day she wept; Wretched as woman with pain could be Was the beautiful Queen of Hungary. Nothing at all could the doctors do, Though they searched their folios through and through; And the wonder was as the weeks went by, That of such torment she did not die. But her Majesty had a will of her own, And a brave little heart as ever was known, And very determined to live was she, The beautiful Queen of Hungary. Finding all pharmacy false and fair, Her Majesty took to penance and prayer, âBlessed Otilia, aid me!â she cried: âSweet Juliana, be thou my guide!â For these are the saints whom the Church has said Should be called upon for a pain in the head, So she went to them for a remedy: The beautiful Queen of Hungary. Long she prayed, till at length it seemed That though still waking and praying she dreamed. All around shone a living light Of angels in angels gleaming bright, A glory of faces in all the air, Each blended of faces still more fair, And rapt in this radiant mystery, Was the beautiful Queen of Hungary. But where the splendour brightest shone Two fairer figures stood gazing down On the suffering Queen with a loving air, The two she had called on in her prayer; Oh! the fondest lover has never known Such beauty in her he would call his own, And on earth such light you could never see As shone on the Queen of Hungary. Saint Juliana the silence broke, And thus to the kneeling lady spoke: âLong hast thou sufferedâ'tis time to know The pleasure which comes when torments go. Mary the Mother is Rose of Heaven,â By the Rosa Mystica life is given; Take, in her name, of rose-mary, Oh, penitent Queen of Hungary! âThen of Melissa, the honeyed balm, Which soothed of old the martyr's qualm, Spirit of rose from the garden bower, Of fresh sweet mint and the orange-flower, Blended together these scents give forth The freshest fragrance known on earth; And since it was first revealed to thee, They shall call it the water of Hungary.â The heavenly recipÃ© was tried With great success, and far and wide Men boasted much of its power to cure, And said that in headaches 'twas ever sure. With time some changes o'er it came, Till at last they changed its very name, Yet 'tis true enough, and to many known, That this was the first of Eau de Cologne, So whenever you use it grateful be To the sainted Queen Elsa of Hungary. FRANGIPANI. WHILE Mutio da Frangipani chose To walk on earth and lead the course called life, Men said he was a mighty alchemist, The greatest master of all mystic lore; And yet they never feared him. Where he went All women smiled, and men held out their hands, Or gave him kindest greeting. One could tell, In street or hall, where Frangipani stood By the gay group around him, and the laugh ReÃ«choing his ownâbut his, indeed, Ah, that was laughter like a Grecian god's, Deep, resonant, and wild as the full bay Of Odin's houndsâand when that laugh was heard The sick would raise their eyelids and exclaim, âWe shall be well, for Frangipani comes!â And then the nurse would add: âYes, when he comes My labour will be ended. Faith, I think That Frangipani's shadow is worth more Than any doctor, body, soul, and all, Who walks the streets of Rome. Ah, there's a man Who does not dread the poor. Yet he's a lord, One of our oldest, noblest families, And true unto its name. Did you ne'er hear How centuries ago there lived a count So full of kindness and all charity That when a famine came he gave his gold Unto the poor, until one loaf of bread Was all remaining to him, and of this He gave a beggar half, and gained thereby The name, so famous in our history, Of Frangipaniââhe who breaks the breadâ? This picture hangs in the south-western hall Of their old palace; and 'tis very strange How greatly it resembles Mutio, Who passes all his time in doing good.â This was his reputation, but his ways Were little like the ways of those who live Deep in the darkest learning. Dance and song Were merrier for his presence. Once he gave An honest inn-keeper, whose trade was dull, The recipÃ© for that great cordial Ros Solis or rosoglioââthe sundew,â Of musk and coriander and sweet seeds Well steeped in good red wine of Italy. A cordial which made the landlord rich, And then went forth o'er all the Christian world As a most excellent and Christian drink, Well suited unto ladies. Truly, he Was greatly loved by them, and 'twas not strange, Although the stories were which people told Of his most liberal friendship. Thus 'twas said That ten brief words once whispered in the ear Of Clara di Savelli in a dance Taught her a secret which prolonged her youth Full forty years. And when she died at last, She looked into her mirror, with a smile At her still wondrous beauty, and exclaimed, âI need not die were Frangipani here: Yetâdo not send for him. I'm tired of play, And need a little rest. Tell him I'll come On earth again some day to visit him. There came a strange disease o'er Italy, What 'twas we know notâbut it vexed men sore, Till Frangipani found a remedy Exceeding pleasant, sweet as summer flowers: A perfumed powder in a velvet bag Inhaled from hour to hour. It was a cast Of odours rareâof orris mixed with spice, Sandal and violet, with musk and rose Combined in due proportion. Thus he made The first bouquet of scents. The malady Soon passed awayâthe remedy remains, And with it lives the alchemist's great name In most enduring fragrance, for he said 'Twas Frangipani's legacy to all The ladies of all time; he loved them so, That he would have his name for ever breathed By them as 'twere a spirit 'mong the flowers. SWEET MARJORAM. AMARACOS the beautiful was page, Or, as some say, the son of Cinyras, A famous hero in the morning time Of history, when history was a dream, And gods meant passions, feelings, scents, and sounds, And kings and queenly girls and children fair Acted with singing flowers and talking birds, Strange fairy tales of nature's mysteries. Cinyras in the isle of Cyprus served As the high-priest of Venus. Very dear To him was her great name, and all her rites Were as the very spirit of his soul, For he had looked on beauty through all lands, And cast his worship starward in the night Through the dark violet heavenâand in all Had found that by her power all things drew Together and made life;âyea, death itself Was but a pause to leap to life again; And therefore by much study of this thought It seemed to him the chiefest end of life To honour her, and this he taught his son; The pride and glory of the services Of Aphrodite's temple filled his soul. Love leads to present rapture,âthen to pain, But all through Love in time is healed again. There was a grand procession to the shrine On the great festival, when, as they say, A voice is heard upon the silent hills Through all the world, yea, and through all the worlds, Proclaiming worship to the Queen of Love. And in the train upon this holy day, Most beautiful among the beautiful Went young AmÃ¡racos. His office was To bear the precious Alabaster vase Which in the olden time had come to earth, Soft borne by doves unto the Cyprian shrine, A gift from Venus to her worshippers. What was within the vase no sage could say, But this they knew, it gave a sweet perfume Unlike all fragrant odours known on earth, And every one did deem himself most blessed Who could inhale it. Therefore he who bore The vase was in great honour. All the lords Of all the land came smiling to the boy, Each seeking by his courtesy to inhale The sacred breath of Venus, for they deemed The mystic vase sent forth an aura sweet Like that which hangs around the dame divine; And as he went, bearing his sacred charge, Hearing his beauty praised by young and old, Full of the glory of the loveliness In which he lived, to which his life was given, Pride swelled within his heart, yet scarce had risen, When, lo! a wild dove from a wood near by, Dashed boldly on the wing close to his head: Yesâflapped her pinions in his very face, And he, all startled by this portent strange, Let fall the vaseâhe felt it slipâin vain! A fright like sickness flashed across his soul: Down went the vase and shattered on the ground. One long loud wail rose from the gentle boy, And instant agony thrilled all the crowd At this most dark disaster. Then they saw AmÃ¡racos fall down upon the earth Dead to the heart, but even as he fell He vanished from their sight, and with him went The fragments of the vase. Nothing remained, But on the earth a new-grown herb there stood Beside a mantle, and its leaves gave forth, Richer and sweeter than the vase had done, The self-same sacred fragrance, which is called The scent AmÃ¡rakine. The plant grew well, And others throve from it in every land. A better gift from Venus than the first:â And maidens call it the Sweet Marjoram. JESSAMINE. AN ARAB POEM. THE secret mystery of the Jessamine Sung by an Arab poet long ago, Azzodmo'l MoccÃ¡desi the sage, Among the voices of the Morning Land. âJas in the Arab language is despair, And Min the darkest meaning of a lie. Thus cried the Jessamine among the flowers, âHow justly doth a lie Draw on its head despair! Among the fragrant spirits of the bowers The boldest and the strongest still was I. Although so fair, Therefore from Heaven A stronger perfume unto me was given Than any blossom of the summer hours. âAnd there is nothing unto me so sweet As to be borne from loving friend to friend When minutes chase the minutes ever fleet, And the beginning seems too near the end. Then I cast all my secret treasure forth, And she who puts me in her bosom finds, The warmer place she gives, the better worth, The odour sweeter than the summer winds, Bestowed by me upon each pleasant breast Between the pillows where I had my rest. âWhere'er I go I make my secret known And cast my sweet aroma all around, And the most delicate and gifted own That in my breath a fresher life is found. But chiefly I delight When anxious passion wakened to a glow By my seductive fragrance flames to fire, And eyes meet eyes and souls each other know, Even to rapture all ineffable Which nothing knew before, And lips to lips are given As souls in heaven Theyâgoâ To bliss And in one long sweet passionate gasp expire! âAmong the flowers no perfume is like mine; That which is best in me comes from within. So those who in this life would rise and shine Should seek internal excellence to win. And though 'tis true that falsehood and despair Meet in my name, yet bear it still in mind That where they meet they perish. All is fair When they are gone, and nought remains behind.â ROSE PERFUME. JIZCHACH BEN AKIBA the Cabalist, The Emperor Rudolph's friend and favourite, Dwelling at Prague, determined to resist The power of death, however he might smite, Therefore he charmed all metals, beasts, and men, All hills and rivulets, all rocks and trees, The reeds which rustled by the oozy fen, All birds which ran or soared or skimmed the seas, That none of them should harm him, and at last, When he had made the mighty list complete, He proudly cried, âThe hour will soon be past, And Azrael lie conquered at my feet!â With this he plucked a rose, but as he smelt Its fragrance knew that death had reached his heart, And saw the awful shade who never knelt To king or magian, standing with his dart: âHow hast thou dared,â he cried, âto use that flower, Against my life, when by the mighty charm Of God 'twas bound to spare me from thy power, And never yield itself to do me harm?â âSon,â said the angel, âit is not the rose Which kills thee, but the rose's sweet perfume. The wine is not the goblet whence it flows, The fragrance not the blossom or its bloom. 'Twas through that fragrance that I reached thy brain; But hadst thou charmed the perfume with thy spell I could have used the perfume's life again, Or that life's spirit, as thou know'st full well. And still beyond, the subtle tinctures seven, Which spread in circles infinite to heaven. SWEET BASIL. Quo mollius eo suavius. âThe softer the sweeter.â THE state of Genoa was strong and proud, So was the Duke of Milan, and the pair Fell to disputing trifles, and to talk Of war, as dogs ere fighting show their teeth, And growl with savage boast before they bite. But ere it came to blows the Genoese, At least, the wiser of their senators, Summoned the man most learned in the law Of all their land, Francesco Marchio, And bade him go to Milan and the Duke, And call on him for speedy settlement Of all the points disputed. So he went, And was received with that great courtesy, And very liberal hospitality, Which all the great in station, or in soul, Show unto those who stand too near the line Of enmity to be considered friend, And yet not near enough to count as foes. Day after day passed by, and nought was done, Though oft Francesco Marchio pressed his claim To be considered. All their answers wereâ âWe'll see to itâa thousand pardons, Sir!â Your Excellence is ever in our mind. The case must be considered. Genoa Is doubtless a great state, but every state Has its own time and methodâwe have ours: In the mean time we pray you to accept Our warm assurances of great respect.ââ And so they played the never-ending air With all the modulations; which to hear And not rush forth enraged, to hang himself Driven to madness by monotony, Is the great task of every diplomat, Which once achieved, leads to the height of fame. A wary, shrewd, old, well-filed Genoese Was this same Marchio, so he took his time, Or let the Duke of Milan take it, till The want of courtesy in the long delay Had turned against the host. Meanwhile he spread A busy rumour that the Genoese Had sent him there but to procrastinate And hinder settlement, while they themselves Were gathering men and arms to go to war. When this fine tale went buzzing through the town, There came a speedy summons from the Duke To Marchio, and the cunning councillor Hastened to heed the bidding. But few words Had passed between them ere Francesco held Some twigs of fair sweet-Basil forth, and said, âI pray your Highness mark this curious herb; Touch it but lightly, stroke it softly, Sir, And it gives forth an odour sweet and rare; But crush it harshly and you'll make a scent Most disagreeable. So with Genoa,â Handle it gently, 'tis all gentleness, But treat it rudely, 'twill be rude in turn.â The speech, 'tis said, impressed the Ducal host, And soon the ambassador, full-satisfied, Returned to Genoa. The state, well-pleased, Gave him sweet-Basil for his coat-of-arms As a reward, and for a motto put Quo mollius eo suavius in his shield. MANY IN ONE. A POEM IN THREE PARTS. MYTHICAL, MEDIÃVAL, MODERN. PART I. MYTHICAL. BEL ER OPH ADON, First of enchanters In the old moon time, Lord of the Fire Land, Plougher of Orcus, Scarlet-born, Sun-born, Azure-born, Sea-born, Purple-born, King-born, Learned in all magicâ By long endurance, Penance, and torture From the abysses Of Godhood tremendous, Gained him such power, Wrenched forth such glory: Never was mortal Clad in such beauty, Forced from the Ãons, From the abysses, Terrible beauty, Loveliness fearful, Splendour of ages;â Such was his form. Bel Er Oph Adon Rose in the evening, Purple and rose-glown Light was around him, Fairer the radiance Shed from his features; Back on the sunset, Back on the purple, Splendour o'er splendour, Beauty o'er beauty Flashes his god-light. Bel Er Oph Adon Goes to his bridal; She, the great Star Queen, Venus the golden, Ivory, crimson, Waits for his coming, Waits for his beauty, She, the Immortal, Seeks his embraces, In her pavilion Flashes celestial Ray forth her raptures. All through the night time Quivers the North Light;â So love the Gods. Thus spoke the Star Queen: âBel Er Oph Adon, Thou who of mortals Only hast mastered Ãons unnumbered, Tinctures of beauty Over the earth-born, E'en to the glories Which my earth kingdom Shows not to mortals. Lord of enchanters, Say, can thy magic, Can thy ambition Picture more honour Than the sweet rapture God-given, God-flowing, Of my embraces? Know'st thou in Orcus? Know'st thou aught earthly? Know'st thou in ocean? Know'st thou in air life? Or in the ages Coming or vanished, Aught like this pleasure? Answer my soul.â Thus to the Star Queen Answered the Magus: âFairer than thou art Never was Goddess, Sweeter or dearer, And in the ages Flowing and coming, All shades of heaven Onward for ever Know of no rapture Like thy embraces. Yet if thou seekest Thus I must answer;â Truth is my power, By truth I ascended;â And I am prouder That each great goddess In the great kingdoms Made me her lover. Deep in the darkness Far among shadows, By the pale Empress Splendid in horror, Fearful in beauty, Long time I lingered. Oft in the Spring-tide On the green mountain Came to me, kissed me, Under dark branches, Hid from the moonlight, DionÃ© the fair. Baaltis the Ancient, Queen of the Mountains, Glowing gold-lustred, Breathing hot perfumes, Sparkling in splendour, Pantherine graceful, Lost in black tresses Like a white swan On the Stygian river, Wooed me in madness, Wooed me and won me; So did AstartÃ©, Lady of Fire Land, So did Melitta Mel Ida, Meldea, She of the Sun-realm Queen of the orgy, Fearful and passionate, Secret and sacred. Eastward or Westward, Heaven-bornâearthly, All the great beauties Worshipped by mortals, All have caressed me. Thee I have best loved; Yet since thou askest What makes me proudest, Truly I answer All make me proud.â Thus answered Venus, Fair AphroditÃ©, Rose-tinted sea foam: âThat which we love best Should make us proudest. Never should true love From pride be dissevered, And in thy love now Shall both be united. Listen to secrets Awful and charming; When in the shadows Deep in the caverns Lovely PersephonÃ© Clasped thee with kisses, I was thy loved one. When on the mountain Stately DionÃ© In thy embraces Made the leaves rustle, I was thy beauty, Bow-bearing, moon-horned. I was BaÃ¤ltis, Morning land-splendoured, Serpentine twining, Glowing in glory, Passionate lovely, Many and One. âI was all others, All who have loved thee; White AnaÃ¯tis Loveliness flowing, Limbs like milk rivers; Also Melitta. Goddess of Sweetness, Honey and perfume, Terrible pleasures Are her embraces. Infinite thrilling The luscious arcana Taught in her orgies, Flashed in her glances:â Yet was Melitta The ray of my spirit, And with the goddess And in the goddess Thou wert with me love. High in the heavens, On the green mountains, Deep in hell's palace, I the One Only Held thee in rapture, Ever enjoying Thy faith in the Many, Even as thou in Thy faith wert delighted; Now thou hast all, love; Now thou hast learned love, All is in love.â PART II. MEDIÃVAL. BE'T far or near, Dark tales we hear How Satan wins the soul Of those who fain Would wisdom gain, Or yield to Love's control; Yet well I wete That wisdom great Ne'er caused a soul to fall, And those who sin True love to win Have never sinned at all. For wisdom high Can pierce the sky To Heaven's brightest bower, And true love's spell Send joy through hell, Where devils sit in dour; And ye in doubt Who stay without, Awhile your minds engage, While I unfold The story old Of Satan and the Sage. In Italie Beyond the sea There lived a man so learned, All heathen lore From days of yore By magic he discerned. In many a tomb, In ancient gloom Unbroke since Jovis sped, He all day long With magic song Held speech with Romans dead. Each goblin child, And fairies wild That in the rivers swim, And sylphids rare Who float in air, Made strange discourse to him. From antique graves And hidden caves Deep murmurings were cast, And statues white In dim moonlight Cried Salve! as he passed. And for such sin His soul within Had Satan power to lay A dismal curse To turn to worse As time should pass away. And that vile root Which Satan put To win him from above, Was this, that he, From woman free, Should ne'er know woman's love. But oh, what part Hath devils' art In those whom Heaven owns? Though Satan sing Till Chaos ring, God chants for deeper tones. The wittiest wile And subtlest guile Ne'er reach the inmost core; The mouse may know Shrewd tricks, I trow, But ever the cat knows more. And now this sage In ripening age Felt Cupid's wondrous power, And oft would dream, By hill or stream, Of love in bed or bower. Yet all alone He made his moan,â Alone he led his life; No maiden fair With him would pair, No woman be his wife. With every spell And charm from hell He tempted girls to guile, But every May Still said him Nay,â No maid on him could smile. With gems and gold Right many a fold He sought to buy their charms, But ever the curse Turned bad to worse: They died within his arms. Ah God, what is All wealth I wis To him who liveth so? Withouten love E'en heaven above I ween were bitter woe The fairest flower, In sun or shower, Is but a laidly weed, And so this man To Satan than Did turn him in his need. And the Great Lord Of ill accord With him did thus agree: âA leman fai Of beauty rare I straight will give to thee. But this be known: To her alone Shall all thy love be given; If ever thou change, And from her range, Thou ne'er shalt rise to heaven.â Mark well, O Heart, What wondrous art Hath God to guard our youth. This sage but sought, By magic taught, To learn all wisdom's truth. Great risks they run Who've thus begun And walk where shadows reign, But ever God, With guiding rod, Will lead them back again. Now this fair maid To him purveyed Was but a demon fell, Whom Satan meant With foul intent To lure him into hell. But soon she felt Her spirit melt,â Her life with love was sore, And in her heart There burned a smart She never knew before. From early time The blackest crime Had ever been her play; In blood and filth She found her health And passed the time away. Even Rome's proud Queen, Great Messaline, To her was but a child, Yet all her soul In sweet control Was soon by Love beguiled. The task she had As Satan bade Was thisâto make her love In constant range To beauties strange, And still to others rove. Small wish had she That this should be, Or he from her should sever The man whose faith Thro' life and death She fain would keep for ever. With torture turned In pain she burned,â No hope was ever there; For all within Was death and sin, And hell was everywhere. Till love so deep Made angels weep, It proved a chastening rod; Love's suffering To heaven takes wing: She dared to think of God. Then to her mind By pain refined A subtle thought came in, A fancy deep Her love to keep And cheat the power of sin. How this should be In time you'll see; Twas all as Heaven bid. When prayer we bring Full many a thing Is oft from Satan hid. One day her love Had chanced to rove, And by the river strayed, When all away Mid forests grey He met a lovelier maid. Straight trapt and caught, He gave no thought Unto his leman fond, And lesser still His wanton will Upon the devil's bond. In evening breeze, Beneath the trees, They wandered long alone. In greenwood shade A tender maid Right easily is won. As the rushes shook In the bubbling brook His heart with passion thrilled, Each long gold hair Is subtle snare When souls with love are filled. With many a kiss Of burning bliss They part, and true love swear; But when next day He came that way He found another there. A cream-white queen Of stately mien With eyes like midnight stars. For her in turn His passions burn And naught his longing bars. And thus for years, Withouten fears, He led a wanton life, And aye his will Did he fulfil With many a lovely wife. Full many a maid In greenwood shade, Full many a bird in bower, And ladies great Of high estate Had he for paramours. Time fleeth on, Youth soon is gone, Naught earthly may abide; Life seemeth fast, But may not last,â It runs as runs the tide. A shallop bark Ye oft may mark Well anchored firm and sound; But lest it flies When waters rise 'Tis by the anchor drowned. Thus to our sage In later age There came the broken bowl; His wasted youth And broken truth, And then his forfeit soul. No joy of wine Or concubine Could heal his growing sore; Cold shadows vast Around him passed, And all was hell before. Thus oft alone He made his moan Mid rocks and forests grim, Till once when there, He was aware Of one who came to him,â A lady bright, While rosy light Shone round as she did pass, Like diamonds on The thistle down, And glow-worms in the grass. âSweet heart,â she cried, âDost know thy bride? Thy love of early years? The first whom thou Did'st kiss, comes now To drive away thy fears.â âAh, God,â said he, âHow can that be, When I am all forlorn? My soul is lost, My fate is crost, There's none so wretched born.â As when black clouds, Like fearful shrouds, Are blown by reckless wind, And glad we mark The fleeting dark With golden light behind; Or nightmare grim, Which froze each limb, Is driven by loving kiss, E'en so the word Which next he heard Did bring him back to bliss. âThou dream'st,â she spoke, âThe bond is broke, And all thy soul is gone, Because that thou Did'st quit thy vow And leave me all alone. 'Twas Satan's will; But Heaven still Hath deeper love than he. In others' arms, By other charms, Thou ever wert with me. âAs thou did'st range, So I did change To bodies young and fair, Of tawny hue, Or fresh and new, To white with golden hair. Was't Pernel, Joane, Or Josiane, Or Blanche, or Marinel, Or Florens sweet, Or Marguerite, I was thy bonnibel. âYes; I, the Elf, Was still myself, Though wooed in many a form; And ever anon I still came on, And got thy kisses warm. Though thou did'st fly Like bird in sky, Yet faster still I flew, And only one Was thine alone, And thou wert ever true. âThe work is done, Thy soul is won; I too am saved from thrall, Since now my yoke In hell is broke, For true love conquers all. We may not rise To yonder skies For many an age, I see; But thou art mine, And I am thine, And saved through love of thee.â Two eagles flew Through heaven blue,â May well such wonder be. Two wild deer strayed Through greenwood shade, Two fish swam in the sea. From life to life, Sweet dear and wife, I ween we often rove, But never part When once the heart Has found its own true love. PART III. MODERN. I WANDER in a wildering dream. What meaneth this, what meaneth all? Lord Arion with his dolphin call? And steam-boats on old sacred streams? What is this mystery which I hate? Are dirt and steam the life to live? Must I the inner truth up-give With gold-fire interpenetrate? I stand beside a mud canal, I hear six costermongers cry: The iron road like snake goes by, Yet the old sun shines over all. There is primÃ¦val loveliness, And here is nothing of the kind; New wisdom drives the soul to wind, And all is one infernal mess. When Dante sat upon his stone In Florence, then the world was square. He knew just how to strike them there, But now who knows the age's tone? 'Twas better when in Sodom thou Saw'st God on this side, hell on that In an arena fair and flat; But sayâwhere is the devil now? I know a man whose heart is whole, In the great city of New York; He deals in stocks and meal and pork: May God have mercy on my soul! Were he but Ser Porcone hight!â And did he but a ducat owe To sainted Fra Angelico For painting San Antonio bright! How very easy 'twould have been To tell the legend of my friend, Illuminated to the end, As though 'twere drawn from Voragin! Yet will I tell it as I may, Although I be a traitor hight, Gone back on the Pre-Raphael lightâ âGone back onâ is an American term for being renegade. Like the Great Lord of PaintâMillais. This man I knew, whose name was Smith, By Fate's sharp scalpel lost his wife, The oyster of his hard shell life, And of his plant the very pith. He mourned her taken up to Heaven While wandering in his devious ways; All life a wild and wilful maze,â And then joined Circle Number Seven. Thou know'st not what that means? Then list,â Such circles are the only rings In which Romance at present springs, For Smith had turned Spiritualist. When next I met him, in his eye There was a sweet and winky light, His very hat and gloves seemed bright With adolescent ecstasy. I gently touched upon his woe, I took him softly by the hand, But with a motion like command He turned upon me and cried, âPoh! âCondole not with me on the dead; They never die,âthey're always here; They sip with us the foaming beer, They're at our table,âand in bed.â â'Tis true,â I said. âInvisible, The dead are round us everywhere, But thinner than the thinnest air:ââ Here Smith replied, derisible: âSuch ignorance but makes me laugh, When yester evening I embraced, With arms tight locked around her waist, My dear departed better half.â âGreat Heaven,â I cried, âhow can that be? Does then the grave return its dead, And spirits from the portal sped, Hie backwards from Eternity?â But Smith replied in calmest tones: âThis spirit of my darling wife, Who comes so oft to cheer my life, Had entered into Mary Jones. âYou know herâisn't she divine? God never made a prettier girl, A real peachâa perfect pearlâ With cheeks which flash with Heaven's wine. âI only hope my wife will stay A long long time in Mary's form; She says she finds it nice and warm; Nor change aboutâas is her way. âFor since she died, beyond a doubt She's been in mediumsâlet me see! Yes, altogether, twenty-three! 'Tis hard to follow her about. âYet 'tis not all devoid of fun, If for an instant you reflect, That I must treat them with respect, For all the Twenty-Three are One! âOne spirit, though of different flesh; But what's the body? Doctors say It changes atoms every day,â Only the soul abideth fresh. And would you make of Earth a Heaven, Learn that the body is but dust; Think not of earthly laws or lust, And join our CircleâNumber Seven.â A THOUSAND YEARS AGO. THOU and I in spirit-land, A thousand years ago, Watched the waves beat on the strand, Ceaseless ebb and flow; Vowed to love and ever loveâ A thousand years ago. Thou and I in greenwood shade, Nine hundred years ago, Heard the wild dove in the glade Murmuring soft and low; Vowed to love for evermore,â Nine hundred years ago. Thou and I in yonder star, Eight hundred years ago, Saw strange forms of light afar In wild beauty glow; All things change, but love endures Now as long ago! Thou and I in Norman halls, Seven hundred years ago, Heard the warder on the walls Loud his trumpet blow,â âTon amors sera tojors,â Seven hundred years ago! Thou and I in Germany, Six hundred years agoâ Then I bound the red cross on: âTrue love, I must go,â But we part to meet again In the endless flow!â Thou and I in Syrian plains, Five hundred years ago, Felt the wild fire in our veins To a fever glow! All things die, but love lives on Now as long ago! Thou and I in shadow-land, Four hundred years ago, Saw strange flowers bloom on the strand, Heard strange breezes blow: In the ideal love is real, This alone I know. Thou and I in Italy, Three hundred years ago, Lived in faith and died for God, Felt the faggots glow: Ever new and ever true, Three hundred years ago. Thou and I on southern seas, Two hundred years ago, Felt the perfumed even-breeze, Spoke in Spanish by the trees, Had no care or woe: Life went dreamily in song Two hundred years ago. Thou and I mid Northern snows, One hundred years ago, Led an iron, silent life, And were glad to flow Onwards into changing death, One hundred years ago. Thou and I but yesterday Met in Fashion's show, Love, did you remember me, Love of long ago? Yes; we keep the fond oath sworn A thousand years ago! LEGENDS OF THE BIRDS. THE WONDERFUL CROW. Erfordiensis quidam civis corvum in deliciis habuisse dicitur quem spiritum ejusmodi fuisse (i.e. spiritus aeri) quod sequitur evincit. Quum quidam die tacitum et tristem videret, âquid tu,â inquit jocabundus, âmi corve ita mÃ¦stus es; quidve cogitas? HeÃ®c ex improviso ingeminat: Cogitavi dies antiquos et annos Ã¦ternos in mente habui. Statimque ex oculis heri disparuit. âThere was a certain citizen of Erfurth who had a pet crow which was one of these spirits of the air, as the following fully proves. For seeing him one day sad and silent, the master said in joke: âWell, my crow, why are you so sorrowful, and of what are you thinking?â To whom the crow mournfully made answer from the seventy-seventh Psalm: âI have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.â Having said this he suddenly disappeared from the eyes of his lord.ââ Henrici Kornmanni. Opera Curiosa Francofurti, A.M., A.D. 1694. IN the Thuringian Land of Song, Where nightingales sing all summer long, By the river Gesar Erfurth stands, A town well-known in many lands; For thereâas all the histories tellâ Great Luther had a cloister cell. Enoughâof him no further word, My song is of a humbler bird Than the great Reformation swan, Whose notes were heard in freedom's dawn. In this town of Erfurthâlong ago A gentleman once tamed a crow, Which proved to be a wondrous bird, If we may trust a writer's word: For he cawed to the horses in the stable, Could dance a hornpipe on the table, Beat time with his bill to the harper's tunes, Pilfered honey and hid the spoons, Kissed the maidens and bullied the cats, Played with the children and chased the rats, Frolicked about in the kitchen dens Where he earned a living by driving hens, Broke with his bill the window panes, And was always tangled in ladies' trains, Till everybody declared that he Was the life and soul of the family. In the town of Erfurth long ago. A change came over that jolly crow. No more he heeded the harper's tunes, No longer he pilfered honey or spoons, No more to the hens was a constable grim, And the cats quite lost their awe of him; While after dinner he danced no more His âwheel-aboutâ jigs on table or floor, And his health and spirits sunk so low That he seemed to be quite a converted crow. One day his master jesting said: âCrow! what fancies are in your head, Or what mighty sorrow is on your soul, That you mope and hide like a frightened mole? Crow, my Cronyââ Here came a surprise! The master started and opened his eyes, While a sense of doubt and terror stole o'er him, As though a ghost had jumped up before him. Well might he startâfor, without a joke, The crow uplifted his voice and spoke, In good clear tones, with no awe or qualms, From the Seventy-seventh of David's Psalms: âCogitavi dies antiquosââ (Here he paused)ââet annos Ã¦ternos.â He spoke with great solemnity, Setting forth this ancient Chronology; But ere a second breath they drew He spread his wings, and away he flew Far over river and road and plain, And never in Erfurth was seen again. MORAL. 'Tis common in every place To set forth by a crow the negro race, As Gilmore Simms long years ago Made known in his tale of The Lazy Crow. And 'tis very fine, if you are able, To have them work on your farm or stable, Dance your jigs and beat your call, And ânever pay them nothing at all.â But it cannot last for ever, you know, For a time will come when every crow, After being silent and perplexed, Will search the Scriptures and find a text,â A text of the wonderful days of old, When truth was to white and black unrolled, Then find his tongue. Fire melts all frost; E'en the negro will find his Pentecostâ And, speaking out, like a soul set free, Will rise to knowledge and liberty. Philadelphia, 1863. THE SWALLOW. WHEN Jesus hung upon the cross The birds, 'tis said, bewailed the loss Of Him who first to mortals taught, Guiding with love the life of all, And heeding e'en the sparrows' fall. But, as old Swedish legends say, Of all the birds upon that day, The swallow felt the deepest grief, And longed to give her Lord relief, And chirped when any near would come, âHugswala swala swal honom!â Meaning, as they who tell it deem, Oh, cool, oh, cool and comfort Him! Oh soul, oh life, oh love! Whene'er A sufferer in this world draws near, Wilt thou remember ere thou go How Jesus died in bitterest woe? That thou in every brother's pain Might'st see thy Saviour live again. Then, drawing from the living stream, âOh, cool, oh, cool and comfort Him!â THE SWAN. WHO rides the rustling woods by night? Sweet through the green leaves shines the moon; Blue flames his steel, his plume is white, And the brook is singing an Elfin tune. His road is running with the stream, Sweet through the green leaves shines the moon; Who wakes in love still walks in dream, And the brook is singing an Elfin tune. Are those three swans white splashing there? Sweet through the green leaves shines the moon; No swans are they, but women fair, And the brook is singing an Elfin tune. On a tree their swan-robes wave and fall, Sweet through the green leaves shines the moon; And the knight, if he would, may seize them all, While the brook is singing an Elfin tune. Who wears a swan-robe merrily, Sweet through the green leaves shines the moon; May sail at will o'er land and sea, And the brook is singing an Elfin tune. He rides and leaves them hanging there: Sweet through the green leaves shines the moon; âWhen you swim of your clothes take better care, There are some who would rob you, ladies fair!â And the brook is singing an Elfin tune. He rides into the deadly fight; Sweet through the green leaves shines the moon; Far o'er him fly three swans so white, And the brook is singing an Elfin tune. A lance has killed him in the fray: Sweet through the green leaves shines the moon; Three swans with a soul have flown away; They fade in the first red light of day:â And the brook is singing an Elfin tune. THE PEACOCK. WHY has the peacock hideous feet? Why is his voice no longer sweet? He who in Eden ere the Fall Mid birds, in both, surpassed them all. To Paradise, the Arabs say, Satan could never find the way Until the peacock led him in:â Pride takes in every sin;â Pride teaches Evil paths to gain Which he for years had sought in vain. The curse which pierced the Serpent through, 'Tis said, fell on the peacock too. His voice, which once in Eden's vales Rang sweeter than the nightingale's, Grew harsh:âthe feet, which led the way Of him who led the world astray, Became the claws which now he wears, Such as the Hebrew demon bears. Such is the story, plain to all, Which teaches, Pride must have a fall. THE EAGLE. Who is ruler of the eagles, Father of the feathered kings? In the dark and lonely Norland There the giant spreads his wings: Giant bird and god Hrosvelgar;â As the Iceland poet sings. When he flaps his wings, a tempest Howling o'er the ocean flies, From his eyes the lightning flashes, And he makes the whirlwind rise: So he calls his eagle-children, And they answer him with cries. âHe who clears away corruption,â Is the meaning of his name; Storm-winds sweep away infection, Wrath and strength cure many a shame Eagles also have their mission: Every bird should not be tame! THE OWL. WHEN Jesus walked in Jewry, then He hungered oft like other men; And quaint old monkish legends say That in a baker's shop one day He asked for food. About to bake, The mistress took a generous cake, And said: âAll this I mean for thee; Wait, Lord, until it ready be!â âIt is too much!â her daughter cried, And put one half the gift aside With angry air. He nothing said, But by the fire laid down the bread, When, lo! as when a blossom blows, To a vast loaf the manchet rose! In angry wonder standing by, The girl sent forth a wild, rude cry, And feathering fast into a fowl, Flew to the woods a wailing owl! Each voice which in the desert cries Teaches a lesson to the wise. Experience, the mistress stern, In legends gives us truth to learn, And emblemed in the owl we see That all men wise and kind should be. Thus monks in moralizing strain Revived Minerva's bird again, Adding a kindlier Christian sense To the symbol of intelligence, Making it Learning's quaintest type Humanity and wisdom ripe. TO YOU. I. WHEN day's red light is lost in night As waking thoughts are lost in dreams, And fancies flit in wanton flight As fire-flies glisten o'er the streams, And all the perfumes of the flowers Have turned to nectar all the air, What would you do in those sweet hoursâ What would you doâif I were there? In greenwood shade 'neath starry shine, When singing to the midnight breeze, You breathe the scent-life of the pine And seek wild coverts 'mid the trees; Wild heart, whose life is all in night! Strange dreamer in the leafy lair, What would youâfar from others' sight! What would you doâif I were there? Full was the moon and high the sea In hours when you and I were born; Blood red the sky gleamed wondrously Upon us in the early mornâ It bodes great hearts and bloody death; But what for that would either care If when we drew the parting breath 'Twere hand in hand together there? I see the full moon overhead, I hear the rustle of the pines; I see thee live who once wast dead, I hear thee singing by the vines: 'Tis I myselfâfor we are one, One thought alone and everywhere, One Night, one Dayâone Self, one Sun, For we are Allâfor ever there. II. Although I know all earthly forms Must meet with earth's decay, I cannot think thy beauty's life Will ever pass away. When meaner shapes of loveliness Return with every rain, Can I believe that thou wilt fade, And never come again? When summer warms the forest fair Its flowers again will blow, When winter chills again the air Again we'll see the snow: The brook will flash through emerald grass, The star from heaven highâ If lesser beauty cannot pass, Can thine, sweet darling, die? To think the love I feel for thee Is love for earth alone, That were a pain no joy on earth Could e'er on earth atone. The Lord who gave thee to my heart Wields no such torturing rod. Sweet heart, because I live in thee, I do believe in God. Thou dearest of all living things, Thou sunshine in my soul, In thee a light of life upsprings Beyond all life's control. Full many a dungeon gets its light From Heaven through narrow bars;â To me there came an angel bright; âI thought no more of stars. III. Whene'er thou movest, in every part There waves a flowing rhyme; The life of all the loveliest art Which lived in olden time. And if that art had ever been What long it sought to be, Then men long since in Art had seen What still I find in thee. Whene'er I gaze into thine eyes And deep love holds me dumb, I feel the Past within me rise Towards fairer dreams to come. Then to the Present I am wed, The Present bears me on; Stars shine the brightest, it is said, 'Twixt darkness and the dawn. Whene'er thy fingers sweep the chords, Whatever thou hast played, My heart sweet-suffering seeks the words, Those words which ne'er were made. And though full many a golden phrase In many a tongue may sound, And poets rise to angel lays, Those words will ne'er be found. The Past is in thy grace, sweetheart, The Present in thine eyes, But in thy voice the Future thrills With all its harmonies. Thou showest God in calm or mirth, There is a promise given In thy deep eyes, that love on earth Means endless joy in Heaven. TO RISE WITH THEE!â THEY said it to me until I believed, And then I said it sadly to myself; âThe yearning for the Beautiful is vain; Art is a bauble, Pride a stumbling-block, And your brave, Noble Soul, a silly dupe, While all must yield to selfish Common Sense, To Common Sense and Gold. In this believe! And in my need and grievous loneliness, Amid the dust and turmoil of the land, I did believe;âwhen, lo! I heard a voice As of youth singing on the distant hills, And then there came the gleam of glorious eyes, The tramp of steeds, the rush of autumn winds, And memories of those ideal friends Dreamed in the days of hope, and last of all The pale, proud, glorious face of their great Queen, Like Lucifer's when reconciled to God,â Too grand for woman, yet too sweet for man, Nobler from knowledgeâbetter from the fall, And then I wept and turned to Truth again. The past is but a mouldering shroud, The future all a shimmering cloud; But thy proud glance, oh! queenly star Turns not to phantoms faint and far. Thou lov'st to hear the North Wind's song, To see the torrent foam along. Oh! could I dart as wild and free For ever on, proud heart, with thee! The mists of dawn drive fast and far, And dimmer grows the morning-star; I see the day's red life arise, Reflected back from thy deep eyes; All moves and lives 'mid wakening sounds, And glad with life thy brave heart bounds; Thou gallant, daring heart, how free That heart must bound which mates with thee! Souls love! What though it be not given To us to dart like sprites through heaven, Or float in torrent-whirls along Forgetting life in one wild song, Still we may scorn the slavish fears Which crush the world to doubts and tears, And they who win this strength rise free With falcon glance o'er heaven and sea. And thou hast won it. Strength by strength Thou'st conquered all the spell at length. Henceforth no coward fear can chill, No lies benumb the joyous will, And all things unconfined and free Sing one great song of life to thee. And who is she who woke the song? Oh friend, look forth! In every throng Thou seest some eye which proudly gleams As though awaked from earth's low dreams, Some yearning glance in which is seen What fain would beâwhat might have been. A glance which, when I feel and see, My heart burns wild âto rise with thee.â ALMA VENUS. THERE were two Christians drowning in a storm, And unto them came Venus in her light, Who offered to the first a helping hand: But he preferred to drown, too pious far To owe his life to her. Then to the next She turned in beauty, and he took her hand. When safe upon the shore he kneeling cried: âI thank thee as the minister of God, Fair Queen of Loveliness and Life and Love. Since He hath chosen thee to save my life Shall I pass judgment on His ways and means?â The first who drowned went unto Heaven's gate, And knocked, and there could hardly enter in, So close St Peter held the leafâthe next Found it wide open with a welcome cry. God is in all things, and he works through all. THE ORIGIN OF WHEAT. BLESSED are they whose hearts and heads are full Of golden legends of the olden time, What is well tried need not be tried again. For they shall walk through life as in a dream, And rocks and grass and grain shall all be charmed. Were bird-songs needless, birds would never sing. Know'st thou the story how the bearded wheat, Man's friendliest food, came unto earth with him? Who knows what destiny runs by his own? When Adam fell with Eve from Eden's bowers No spirit of the flowers would go to earth. Those who have fallen keep no rising friends. Only the wheat, which hitherto was held Of little worth, went to the world with them. Who knows what bough may save a drowning man? Bread is the staff of life, and wheat the type; As man is buried, so the wheat is sown. The ancient sacrament is bread and wine. Think of all this when next you sow or reap, Or gather into barns the golden grain. No work was ever hindered yet by song. SONG OF THE NEW YEAR. OUT from the North, where ice and snow Hold one eternal carnival, Whirling with tempests as they blow, While deadly frost is over all, Just newly born, Unstained, unworn With light for life-blood fast I fly; Lord of the hours With sun or showers, King of the Yearâlo! here am I! And I am of your lives a part, Your very selvesâremember well! I beat in every bounding heart, And grow in every flower and shell. The roaring sea Is blue with me; Each oak-ring with its circled rhyme Repeating what The last year taught, All chronicle my round of time. The mighty mountains know my hand, The tides all count me hurrying on; New born, new dead, in every land; Record me comingâshow me gone; The rocks and graves, The flowers and waves, The lonely plains, where all is drear, With ruins old And loves untold, All tell the story of the year. The silent forms that flit around Man's daily doings, out and in: Unborn to sight, unkin to sound, Free from the shade of sense or sin; To them each hour An awful power More than to mortal man I seem. They count my bounds, And know the rounds Scarce glimmering in a Plato's dream. The lovely face with golden hair Which seemed to thee a world divine; The graceful armsâthe all too fair, I swear by truth shall all be thine! What doth appear On earth most dear Is all a promise made below, When it hath slept It will be kept In the fair rose-life yet to blow. All this I markâall this I am, I die, but I shall live again; I rise in every choral psalm, I vanish with the ripened grain, Then though we die Sing loudâfill high! And be your laughter brave and long! The year's great power Is in each hour; All time is but a New Year song! IN THE NORTH. THE moonlight shines upon the waves All bending in the wind; The sail-boat runs before them both, But leaves her foam behind. The porpoise takes the tide to sea, The herring to the sand; The seagull fishes far away, But rests at night on land. And if you say 'tis time to go, I'm off to sea once more; But if your eyes should tell me âNo,â I'll stay to-night on shore. The tide runs up, the tide runs down, The waves they rise and fall; But with a man whose mind is set It's once and once for all. IN THE SOUTH. HEY up the river, And ho! down the bay! Trees on the black rock, And grass on the grey. Send the boat closer in, Up to the shore; There she is standing, Just holding the door! Now is the time If you've something to say; Hey up the river, And ho! down the bay! Something is coming, I know by her smile; âLet me go down with you, Only a mile?â âPlenty of room For a dozen like you:â More to the forward, And trim the canoe! Now we are off again, Well under weigh; Hey up the river, And ho! down the bay!â Out of the deep water Into the shoal, Lay down the paddle, And take up the pole! Pull by the bushes! Look out for the root! Into the current, And over the shoot! âKeep on another mile?â âJust as you say!â Hey up the river, And ho! down the bay! âWhen the moon rises, We'll go by her light.â Still she kept on with him All through the night: Two miles, and three miles, And five miles, and ten: Back to the river home Never again. Long was the journey, But short seemed the way; Hey up the river, And ho! down the bay! Elk River, Braxton County, West Virginia, May 20, 1866. THE DREAM âLife's sweetest dreams Are foam on streams.â AN ancient dream has wandered Through earth since the earliest time, And he o'er whom it sweepeth Grows sternâor it may be weepeth, Like one who suffers with longing For a sweet yet terrible crime. It hath but a single picture: A fountain which leaps and foams, And by it a woman sits yearning, Starting 'mid reveriesâburning For a love which never comes. The fountain leaps up in passion, Darts out in a gleaming pain; And the longing of him who dreameth, And the passion of her who seemeth, Fall back into foam again. THE WORLD AND THE WORLD. IF all the world must see the world As the world the world hath seen, Then it were better for the world That the world had never been. Yet if the world could see the world As the world the world might see, Then a happier world than this old world Perhaps could never be. Oh, world that lives upon the world! You travel far too slow! Oh world! green grave of all the world, How wondrous swift you go. BUZZ! âMy name,â quoth the man, âis Fine Ear; I can hear all the noises in the world, and all that is spoken therein.ââ Grimm's Fairy Tales. I HEARD the steeples pouring forth Their storm-bells' roaring din, And the songs of merry companies As they sat so snug within; The measured tread of armies proud, The dash of the restless sea, âAnd it's buzz!â quoth the world, as on she whirled; And away with the world went we. I heard a martyr at the stake Groan out, âIn Domino!â I heard five infants squall at night, While cats yelled out below; I heard a preacher pounding texts To a godly companie, âAnd it's buzz!â quoth the world, as on she whirled; And away with the world went we. I heard a dainty cavalier Sing to his ladye love, While fountains in the moon-rays plashed, And the lady sighed above; And I heard the click of cold white dice With curses pealing free, âAnd it's buzz!â quoth the world, as on she whirled, And away with the world went we. I heard a swan's sweet dying song, I heard the tempest's breath; I heard a lady thrash her lord (And she thrashed him half to death); I heard a scholar turning leaves; The scream of an angry flea. âAnd its buzz!â quoth the world, as on she whirled; And away with the world went we. Yesâmusic, thunder, growls, and groans, With shouts and shots in store, While powder-mills exploded fastâ But I could bear no more. I stopped my earsâI howled a prayer, And swooned in agony, âAnd it's buzz!â quoth the world, as on she whirled; And away with the world went we. THE ROMAN RING. I SAW you first upon a gem set in a Roman ring, And I burned for it with longing as for a living thing. The Greek who sees his heart's own love sold in a Turkish mart Is not more grieved to think his purse is smaller than his heart, Than I with many wishes and ducats very few Was grieved to leave that lovely face behind me with the Jew. Again I met you ripening and kindling into life Beneath a skilful painter's brush as Vulcan's lovely wife, From the foam and flood of colour, out-blushing lusciously, As Venus Aphrodite rose from the summer sea; And I waited with the patience of one whom fate entwines, And sees a new strange destiny around him spin its lines. With doubting curiosity I watched the painter's face, Yet earnestly and half in fear, to see if I could trace A knowledge of the secret hope awaking with his art, And how each crimson pencil-touch made blood leap in my heart. In vainâfor as he painted on, the likeness passed away, And the rosy morning ended in a grim and cloudy day. I meet you now in mortal formâa lovely living thing, Still fairer than the vanished sketch, as that surpassed the ring, And with new light the solemn text comes often to my mind, That he who seeks right earnestly at last shall surely find. Let others swear they find you fair and still fresh incense bring: They did not know you, love, of old, upon the Roman ring. THE FALL OF THE TREES. I HAVE been in the wild green wilderness, A wood of many ages, leagues away From human home, when a tremendous storm Was giving its long warning in those signs Which every woodsman knows. We sat in peace In the canoe dug from a single tree, Well in the water and far out from shore, For none at such a time will trust to trees, Since lightning strikes them when they shelter men; And as we sat and watched the wide-spread clouds, I heard from time to time, long miles away, Deep dull and thundering sounds, like cannon fired In a ravine, which makes them heavier And yet prolongs the roar. An awful sound To one who knew that no artillery Was in those lonely dales, and that no flash Had shot as yet from heaven. It was the noise Of ancient trees falling while all was still Before the storm, in the long interval Between the gathering clouds and that light breeze Which Germans call the Wind's bride. At such time The oldest trees go down, no one knows why, But well I know from wood-experience That 'tis before the storm they mostly fall, And not while wind and rain are terrible. 'Tis wonderful, and seen ere every storm:â Our great old statesmen died before the war. THELEMÃ. âGive me leave,â said Friar John, âto found an abbey after my own fancy.â And Garagantua, well pleased, offered him all the country of ThelemÃ©.â Rabelais, Book i. C. lvii. I SAT one night on a palace step Wrapped up in a mantle thin, And I gazed with a smile on the world without, With a growl at my world within. Till I heard the merry voices ring Of a lordly companie, And straight to myself I began to sing: âIt is there I ought to be.â And long I gazed through a lattice raised, Which looked from the old grey wall, And my glance went in with the evening breeze, And ran o'er the revellers all. And I said: âIf they saw me 'twould cool their mirth Far more than this wild breeze free; But a merrier party was ne'er on earth, And among them I ought to be.â And, oh, but they all were beautiful, Fairer than fairy dreams, And their words were sweet as the wind-harp's tone When it sings o'er summer streams; And they pledged each other with noble mien, âTrue heart, with my life to thee!â âAlack!â quoth I, âbut my soul is dry, And among them I fain would be.â And the gentlemen were noble souls, Good fellows both sain and sound: I had not deemed that a band like this Could over the world be found; And they spoke of brave and beautiful things, Of all that was dear to me; So I thought, âPerhaps they would like me well If among them I once might be!â And lovely were the ladies too Who sat in the lighted hall, And one there was, oh, dream of life! The loveliest of them all; She sat alone by an empty chair, The Queen of the feast was she; And I said to myself, âBy that lady fair I certainly ought to be!â And aloud she spoke: âWe have waited long For one who in fear and doubt Looks wistfully into our Hall of Song, As he sits on the steps without; I have sung to him long in silent dreams, I have led him o'er land and sea: Go, welcome him in as his rank beseems, And give him a place by me!â They opened the door, yet I shrunk with shame As I sat in my mantle thin, But they haled me out with a joyous shout, And merrily led me in, And gave me a place by my bright-haired love As she wept with joy and glee, So I said to myself: âBy the stars above, I am just where I ought to be!â Farewell to thee, life of joy and grief! Farewell to thee, care and pain! Farewell, thou cruel and selfish world, For I never will know thee again! I live in a land where good fellows abound,â In ThelemÃ© by the sea; They may long for a happier life that will,â I am just where I ought to be. THE RIDDLER. THERE went a rider on a roan, By rock and hill and all alone, And asked of men these questions three: âWho may the greatest miller be? âWhat baker baked ere Adam's birth? âAnd what washer washes the most on earth?â And still the rider went his way By cities old and castles gray, In morning red or moonlight dim, Unto the sea where ships do swim; And yet no man could answer him. He reined his horse upon the sand: âThere is no lord in any land Can answer right my questions three:â Old fisher sitting by the sea, Can'st tell me where those craftsmen be?â Then spoke the fisher of the mere: âThe earth is dark, the water clear, And where the sea against the land Is grinding rocks and shells to sand, I see the greatest miller's hand. 'And the baker who baked ere the morn When Adam was in Eden born, Is Heat, that God made long before, Which dries the sand upon the shore, And hardens it to rock once more. âAnd the water falling night and day Is the washer, washing all away; All melts in time before the rain, The mountain sinks into the plain: So the great world comes and goes again.â âThou, Silver Beard, hast spoken well, With wisdom most commendable; So bind thee with this golden band!â The light was red upon the strand, The rider's road lay dark in-land. MAIDEN'S LOVE. THE fleetest horse in all the land, So swift you cannot ride But that his shadow on the sand Will follow by your side. And if your heart with love be sore For one who feels your pain, You cannot love that maiden more Than she will love again. So red a rosebud never blew When opened by the wind, But that one more as bright of hue By seeking you may find. And all that wooing lips e'er swore Of greater truth is vain; You cannot love a maiden more Than she will love again. The fairest fish upon the line So matchless may not be, But that some other fish as fine Is swimming in the sea. And love as man ne'er loved before, This truth will still be plain; You cannot love a maiden more Than she will love again. The horse will live while grass is free, The rose while wet with dew, The fish while swimming in the sea, And love while love is true. While light is in the sun above, And flowers are on the plain, So long as you are true to love, She'll love you back again. THE FOUNTAIN FAY. YE gentles all who love your life Beware, beware the water wife! She singeth soft, she singeth low; Her lute is the mountain-streamlet's flow; Her harp the pine-wood's mournful moan; She sits in the forest and sings alone, And her songs like rippling rivers roll; Beware, beware ere they drown thy soul! Ride where you may, ride where you will, The Fountain Fay may meet you still. He rode alone in the silent night, She swam like a star to his left and right. He rode by the linden blooming fair, The wood-bird sung: âOh, boy, beware!â He came to the fountain in the wood; The Fay in her beauty before him stood. In the starlight, silver-sparkling glance Her sisters swam in the Elfin dance. âAlight, young minstrel, brave and gay, And sing us thy sweetest, strangest lay!â He tuned his lute, and the tinkling sounds Flitted like birds through the greenwood bounds. He sang so sweetâhe sang so long, The flower-buds opened to hear his song. He sang so gently of maiden love, He ripened the fruit on the boughs above. âFar in the East is a rosy light. What shall he have for his song this night?â âI ask no more for lute and lay, Than a kiss from the lips of the Fountain Fay!â She kissed him onceâto the minstrel's sight The world seemed melting in golden light. Once more, and his soul to the land of the fay In beauty and music seemed floating away. As she kissed him again the spirit had fled: He lay in the moon-rays cold and dead. But far from above a whisper fell: âGreen Earth, with thy valleys and lakesâfarewell!â Ye who know not the life of poÃ«sy, Of beauty, romance, and fantasie! And who think there can be âno world like this,â Beware of the Fairyâbeware her kiss.â A SPARK IN THE ASHES. I WENT to a gay reception Last winter in the West, As the beau of the belle of the season, Quite out of the season dressed. For they told her no queen in story Had a bust so blanche and fair; And, like Samson, her strength and glory Was all in her wondrous hair. But I did not think of her tresses, For directly vis-Ã -vis, A dame in the simplest of dresses Was flashing her eyes at me. Eternal eyes of wonder! How gloriously they rolled, Like two black storm-lakes under An autumn forest of gold. For as Lilith's in her splendour Like an aureole gleamed her head, And a magic, strange yet tender, Seemed winding in every thread. Wavy and dreamy in motion I felt the old memory flow:â We had met by the sun-gold ocean A thousand years ago! And the beaux and the belles with their graces, Where were they on the ancient shore? Oh, the sea had blown froth in our faces A thousand years before. Sea-foam and weed and clam-shells Which slid in the waves' long rolls! Gay gentlemenâbeautiful damsels! Why, how did you come by those souls? THE TREES OF LIFE. THE city belles in Autumn Their gayest garments don; In Autumn, too, the forests Put brighter vesture on. At night in snowy linen The ladies sink to sleep; In winter 'neath the snow-drifts The trees seem slumbering deep. Oh! loves and leavesâamong you A man must walk with care; How soon we're lost in forests! How soon 'mong ladies fair! THE TWO FRIENDS. I HAVE two friendsâtwo glorious friendsâtwo better could not be, And every night when midnight tolls they meet to laugh with me. The first was shot by Carlist thievesâten years ago in Spain. The second drowned near Alicanteâwhile I alive remain. I love to see their dim white forms come floating through the night, And grieve to see them fade away in early morning light. The first with gnomes in the Under Land is leading a lordly life, The second has married a mer-maiden, a beautiful water-wife. And since I have friends in the Earth and Seaâwith a few, I trust, on high, 'Tis a matter of small account to meâthe way that I may die. For whether I sink in the foaming flood, or swing on the triple tree, Or die in my bed, as a Christian should, is all the same to me. IN THE OLD TIME. WHAT is a Kiss?âpray tell't to Mee. A daring daintie Fantasie: A Brace of Birdes whych chirpe, âwee would!â And pyping answer: âiff wee could!â What is a Kiss?âwhen Evenyng falls In russett Folds are Heaven's Walls, Itt is a blissed Prophesye, That Love wyll live, tho' Day may dye. What is a Kiss?âwhen Mornyng's Leme Casts Verjuice redd in Heaven's whyte Creme, Itt is a pretie, ringing Knell, That cryes to LoveââSwete, fare ye wel!â What is a Kiss? Alacke! at worst, A single Dropp to quenche a Thirst, Tho' oft it prooves in happie Hour, The first swete Dropp of one long Showre. BRAVE HEART. AFAR in the forest, Or deep in the town;â Where the sun rays come up, Or the wild waves go down; 'Mid armies triumphant, In deserts alone, While morning red gleameth, Brave Heart holds his own. When true love sings sweetly, And white arms hold fast, Or when love goes whistling Away with the blast; In kisses and music, By hatred's grim tone, In rags or in ermine, Brave Heart holds his own. When hunter's horn soundeth O'er river and rocks Each soul with joy boundeth, In chasing the fox; And though the fox 'scape them Still pleasure they've known, So through this world's hunting Brave Heart holds his own. Love, fame, and a fortune May come or may go; Hate, Vengeance, and Murder, With all the mad show:â But 'mid joys he hath garnered Or griefs he hath sown, O'er his feelings and sorrows Brave Heart holds his own. As the wild eagle saileth O'er sunshine and cloud, As the dead nothing heareth Far down in his shroud, As the tall man when bearded Hath child-dreams outgrown, So through all this world's wearing Brave Heart holds his own. GENTLE HEART. âVaut mieux Ãªtre gentil que beau.ââ Romance de Griselidis. I KNOW that Beauty's power is great To lead to love the heedless mind; That brilliant eyes may flit like stars, Yet leave an influence behind; That lips, like ruby amulets, Oft hold unwilling souls in thrall; Their spells are numberlessâand yet A gentle heart is worth them all. I know that Wit can lightly win What earthly charms have never won; That Beauty fades before her light As moonlight pales before the sun; That words enchant like elfin darts Although invisibly they fall, And yetâthough thousands own their mightâ A gentle heart is worth them all. I know that Wealth can purchase Love: The best on earth are bought with gold; That Power needs but to nod his head To win a myriad to his fold. All these in turn must cling to Rank, Like grape-vines to the sunny wall: The world is swayed by them, and yet A gentle heart is worth them all. Sweet Dames, remember when ye strive To hold a lover in your thrall, Wit, Beauty, Wealth, and Power may aidâ A gentle heart is worth them all. THE BRIDGE AND THE BROOK. HE casts his arms around her, But ever finds her gone; The love-span hath not bound her, And still the brook runs on. âFair Sun! be thou, my dearest!â She rose, his love to gain, In dreamy, misty beauty, But sunk in storm and rain. Leave not for one above thee Another tried for years: A few brief hours he'll love thee, Then cast thee back in tears. MINE OWN. AND oh, the longing, burning eyes! And oh, the gleaming hair Which waves around me, night and day, O'er chamber, hall, and stair! And oh, the step, half dreamt, half heard! And oh, the laughter low! And memories of merriment Which faded long ago! Oh, art thou Sylphâor truly Selfâ Or either at thy choice? Oh, speak in breeze or beating heart, But let me hear thy voice. âOh, some do call me Laughter, love; And some do call me Sin:ââ âAnd they may call thee what they will So I thy love may win. âAnd some do call me Wantonness, And some do call me Wine:ââ âOh, they might call thee what they would If thou wert only mine!â âAnd some do call me Sorrow, love, And some do call me Tears, When sighing for the golden hours Of love in early years. âAnd some do call me Gentle Heart, And some Forgetfulness:ââ âAnd if thou com'st as one or all, Thou comest but to bless!â âAnd some do call me Life, sweetheart, And some do call me Death; And he to whom the two are one Has won my heart and faith.â She twined her white arms round his neck:â The tears fell down like rain. âAnd if I live or if I die, We'll never part again.â WOMAN'S WILL. Con la muger y el dinero No te burles, companero. MANY a charm is round thee, Many a spell hath bound thee, Though awhile I give thee leave to range. Soon, thy wild flight over, Soon, no more a rover, Back thou'lt fly and never dare to change. If thou wilt, go flutter Here and there, to utter Burning words to all with wanton will; Butâthou canst not leave me, Noânor once deceive me; And in chains I hold thee captive still. To some love enchanting, Every favour granting, Go and sighâI bid thee!â'tis in vain; For no woman clever Lost a lover ever When she willed to hold him in her chain. She who's sure of winning, When the game's beginning Throws away of course a stake or two; But when higher aiming, Bent on bolder gamingâ Back they come, and then she holds them true. PORTRAITS. LOUISE IN NORMANDY. WE walked where storks and swallows fly, Louise! Louise! All on the castle-terrace high, We saw the village in the sun, We saw the sparkling waters run; Birds fluttering, hearts a-beating. Around your waist I twined my arm, Louise! Louise! I felt your life throb wild and warm; But Love soon hushed the first alarm: Birds fluttering, hearts a-beating. We saw the peasants churchward climb, Louise! Louise! We heard the bells ring slow in chime, And as they rung we kissed in time: Birds fluttering, hearts a-beating. Too slow the church-bells' melody! Louise! Louise! Yes; much too slow for you and me, High over all where none could see: Birds fluttering, hearts a-beating. EVA. I'VE seen bright eyes like mountain lakes, Reflecting heaven's blue; And some like black volcano-gulfs, With wildfire flashing through; But thine are like the eternal skies, Which draw the soul afarâ Their every glance a meteor, And every thought a star. Some lips when robbed seem cherries sweet, âSmall sin to those who stoleâ But thine are like the Eden fruit, Whose theft may cost a soul. Oh, coral fruit of Paradise! Who would not grasp the prize? With heaven so near to bring him back, In those eternal eyes. MANUELA. RED the lips of Manuelaâ How the lady loves to kiss! Ah, when Manuela kisses, First she kisses with her glances! Then her red lips kiss each other, Practising for warm encounters. Then she kisses with her eyelids, Kisses with her arching eyebrows, With her soft cheek softly rubbing, With her chin and hands and fingers. All the frame of Manuela, All her blood and all her spirit, All melt down to burning kisses: All she feeds on is their sugar. Oh, thou sun above us flying! Breeze from land to land still roaming, Saw ye ever yet a lady Half so fair or fond of kissing? Red the lips of Manuelaâ How the lady loves to kiss! ERMENGILDE. FAR in the forest 'Mid the rocks, His hands unwound Her heavy locks. In the tawny waves They swam with bliss, While red lips pressed The close wet kiss. Oh, broken leaves and withered flowers, Ye witnesses of golden hours! Spring up afresh, and tell to none Why your white sides are towards the sun. Beneath the vines, Where none could hear, Vines seem too human Creeping near; Awed with their secret Dread-confessed, Yet both half-lost In being bless'd. Oh, river swimming to the sea, Our death-pall thou shouldst quickly be, If one in all the world could dream That we had kissed beside thy stream. CALLIRHOE. DARK eyesâdark eyesâpale, earnest face, Oh, when I feel your power, The world seems mean and pitiful, Its fiercest storm a shower. Dark eyesâeternal soul of pride! Deep life of all that's true! Oh, what were death or anything To one full thought of you? Away, away to other skies! Away o'er sea and sands! Such eyes as those were never made To shine in earthly lands. MIRIAM. OH Miriam! Pearl of the morning, gazelle of the palm-land, soul of my spirit, Daughter of Akiba, beloved of the faithful and the Goyim! Blue sea; sister of lilies and roses! There came to me a dream fresh on the wings of the morning, Soft as the light of the Silver Sabbath lamp, when it shines on the Pesach feast. Dear as thine eye when loveliest beaming, love's sister. I walked by thy side in a dream; we walked by a river:â Jordan rolls not more gently: purple its waters; Thine eyes were upon me, beloved, thy star-light eyes, blessed as the lamp of the Sanctuary, Black eyes of infinite fireâoh soul, thou art lovely! Beauty of the Eastâthe golden sequins and ear-ringsâthe antique gold of Judea, Which hangs upon thy forehead with the golden earrings from Damascus, Which thou had'st from Sara thy auntâall the gold around thy dear face Is but the frame of a picture too fine for its setting, My arm and thine twined like the vines in spring, Slowly we walked and slower, till trembling and pausing, I kissed thee, oh beloved!âon the sand by the purple waters. Anna the gracious is fair; fair, too, is Sara the mistress; Abigail the joy of her father, and Ruth the satisfied; Tabitha the roe-buck, light are her footsteps and lovely; Esther the secret and silent, and Rachel the sheep; Eva life giving; Judith praising, confessing; Jemima fair as the day; Hagar, the stranger; Hannah gracious and merciful; Huldah all the world; Yes, all the world and its loveliness hath nothing like thine, little sister! Thy bitterness, oh Miriam, is sweeter than all their sweetness! FLORENCE. THE winds still rock the merry waves, And the blue waves shake the shore; But thine azure eyes and gentle words Will move my heart no more. Oh Sea! thou may'st well be glorious With thy snow-capped sapphire waves; There's a fairer white and a deeper blue Deep hid in thy silent caves. Oh Wind! thou may'st well be wailing With thy moaning, droning sound, For a sweeter, softer voice than thine By the wind in the water drowned. Oh Sea and Wind!âtogether, Since first your course has run, Ye have ta'en the brave and beautiful:â Could ye not spare us one? Not one!âin the breezy morning Thou'lt wake me no more from dreams: Not one!âin the dewy evening I shall miss thine eyes' blue gleams. THEN AND NOW. WE met and spoke in darkness, But my spirit knew your grace, And my heart had felt your fetters Ere my eyes had seen your face. That evening dream is over, No cloud between us rolls; Now the light is on our faces, And the darkness in our souls. THE PROPHET. THE prophet said: âAll mysteries Unto me are displayed, Yet not the Eagle's way in air Or a man's who woos a maid! Then I said to myself, âI soon will solve This subtle mystery;â So I asked the man and the maid, but they Knew even less than he. A SONG WITHOUT AN END. THE crow in the woods is cawing A solemn Indian rhyme, And the cat-bird cries while the wood-pecker Is merrily beating time; The leaves are sweetly rustling As the west wind sweeps along; Yet all is but the symphony Of a deeper and stranger song. And when bird and leaf are silent, And quiet my spirit wins, Then first with wondrous melody The Song of the Wood begins. WAKING DREAMS. THAT thought is no reality, Oft waking with a start, we find; But from reality take thought,â How little then remains behind. I walk the greenwood all alone, And thou in spirit by my side; Ah, then thou art indeed my own, A something more than earthly bride. A dead leaf falls, the vision flies Like morning mist from mountain stream,â Yet take that vision from my life, And life itself were but a dream! MOUNTAIN AND SEA. WHEN gazing on a summer sea Beneath a purple sky, It oft has seemed a mountain ridge Far rising blue and high. Now gazing inland and afar, The thought still comes to me, How much yon distant mountain line Is like the dim blue sea. When thou art seated by my side Loved memories ever rise; When thou art gone up swells the tide Of those sweet, sea-blue eyes. WHERE? DEEP in the dale the gold veins hide, Far up ascends the mountain's brow; But soul of gold and front of pride, Where in this wide world bidest thou? Night blesses me. The heart grows sweet In silence 'neath dark violet skies; But where are now her fairy feet? And whose and where her starry eyes? Soul of the Eagle! If I knew That thou but tread'st life soil or sands! Life of the mountain torrentsâwho Hath heard thee sing in silent lands? Unbounded one! could I but feel Thou liv'st,âthough in the Infinite,â How calmly unto thee I'd kneel, And worship in the perfumed night! Moon Queen and Love Star! ye behold All tender mysteriesâall things fairâ From the dim rites of Sidon old Through all Earth's beautyâwas she there? Proud serpent-beautyâCrested Queen! The tenderest dream this heart has known, Art thou to be or hast thou been My lifeâmy deathâmy golden One! Yes, while the rivers laughing run To meet in love the foaming sea, While flowers grow fragrant 'neath the sun, I know from them that thou must be. I know where miners seek their gold, Where Heaven kiss the mountain's brow; But, soul of beautyâpride untoldâ Where in this wide world hidest thou? EUTHANASIA. I WOKE at water dashing: At my window, bright as stars, Two dark brown eyes were flashing Their love light through the bars. âThou cam'st to me in spirit Amid our mountain streams;â Now thou shalt woo me waking, As once thou did'st in dreams.â And forth once more in darkness Twin souls have flown afar; Lo, yonder in the land of light, There shines another star. FROST PICTURES. I. WINTER came on, and the frost went down O'er field and forest and flood and town. It found the windows clear at night; But when morning came, with its golden light, They were all like silver, fair to see, Chased in wonderful imagery. âA New Year's gift to the world!â said the frost, Rich lace curtains which nothing cost.â And over the wide world he went his way, Till he passed a cell where a prisoner lay. Then he worked the windows thickly and white, And went freezing, freezingâon through the night. The prisoner woke ere morning grey, And saw that the frost had been that way, Then he wrote on the silvery crispy rind The thought that ever was on his mind: âO cara mÃ® Jesu, nunc libera me!â (Dear Lord, from this prison pray set me free!) Then lighted his taper, and all alone Read in the silence till morning shone. The Lord in the Castle sleepless lay; Long were the hours, and he wished for day, When all at once on his chamber wall He saw these letters bright-flickering fall: âO cara mÃ® Jesu, nunc libera me!â (Dear Lord, from this prison pray set me free!) Borne through the night from the prison cell, The frost and the taper had carried them well. Upstarted the lord, amazed I ween, For a stranger sight he had never seen. And sought till he found what the cause might be, And then set the prisoner fairly free, Who had writ on his window unthinkingly, âO cara mÃ® Jesu, nunc libera me!â II. THE frost upon the window Has painted all in ice, Castles and caverns and crystals With many a wild device. And with my breath it painted; But soon in the morning ray The castle and caverns and crystals Went running to nothing away. The frost made wondrous pictures With breath, and all in fun, Just as full many a speaker More seriously has done. Building up domes in figures, Painting in metaphor rare, Making with breath his pictures, Frosty and chilling and fair. But when some great genial spirit Came forth with a heart-warmed ray, The frosty and crystalline figures To nothing went fading away. âPERSEVERANDO.â STILL firm in purpose ever be, Wherever drifts the tide, And bear in mind, whate'er we see, The world to all is wide. Still firm in purpose ever be; The soaring albatross Sometimes must land on barren sand, 'Mid withered weeds and moss: Sometimes be lower than the gulls,â Crawl lower than the sea; But when he once can spread his wings, Far, far away goes he. Great albatross!âthe meanest birds Spring up and flit away, While thou must toil to gain a flight, And spread those pinions grey; But when they once are fairly poised, Far o'er each chirping thing Thou sailest wide to other lands, E'en sleeping on the wing. Many sea-birds find it difficult to rise from the ground, and are obliged to run a few paces or struggle before they can fly. Oh! heart, hold fast, though hard it be At first to win the way; The darkest morning in the end May prove the brightest day; As weak a boat has reached the port, In spite of every tide:â Fear not that every course will fail Until the whole are tried. AMERICA AND COLUMBIA. THROUGH years of toil Columbus Unto our New World came; But a charlatan skipped after, And gave that world his name. All day in street and market The liar's name we see; Columbia!âsweet and seldomâ Is left to Poetry. And the names bring back a lesson Taught to the world in youthâ That the realm of Song and Beauty Is the only home of Truth. SPRING. UPROSE the wild old winter-king, And shook his beard of snow; âI hear the first young hare-bell ring, 'Tis time for me to go! Northward o'er the icy rocks, Northward o'er the sea, My daughter comes with sunny locks: This land's too warm for me!â And softly came the fair young queen O'er mountain, dale, and dell; And where her golden light was seen An emerald shadow fell. The good-wife oped the window wide, The good-man spanned his plough; â'Tis time to run, 'tis time to ride, For Spring is with us now.â And the city-maiden smile smiled that day In all her loveliness; âI must pack my furs and things away, And think of a new spring dress, A new chapeauâa feather fine, Light gloves, and ribbons gay.â Oh, winter wild!âoh, maiden mine, Thus runs the world away. THE LANGUAGE OF THE SEA. I SPOKEâbut if my voice was heard, You did not answer me, But looked with painful earnestness Far at the foaming sea. The breakers caught the glance and thought, And in a wondrous strain, With tones of solemn melody They brought them back again. And what your glances did not tell I heard in that deep voice, And what to you was strange and sad First made my heart rejoice. Oh, it was well that none around Who laughed so merrily, Had ever learned on life's great shore The language of the sea. LONG AGO. MANY a weary year Since I waltzed, my love, with thee! And neither of us knows Where the other one may be; Dying in iron sorrow, Or sunk in the endless sea. Many a quiet year Since those wild old nights ran byâ Mornings in the forest, Days on the mountains high, Galleries of golden art:â Enough, enough, thou beating heartâ I would not have thee die! Galleries of golden art, And music soft and low, And friends in youthâoh, now in truth Some faint relief I know. And is she dead?âhurrah, my heart! Here comes the hot tears' flow! LOST DREAMS. VOICES, voices ever round me crying! Voices in the midnight in the storm! Voices deep in slumber softly sighing! Memories which long ago lost form! Memories which once too lightly faded Out of life, and now with endless pain In such tone and colour darkly shaded, Strive in agony to live again. Golden images of early morning! When I stood in youth beside a sea Fringed with palaces, why did no warning Ring from ivory windows unto me? Voices! had ye then but softly spokenâ âPrint these pictures ever on thy soul!â Ye would not be wailing now and broken, Agonized with tasks beyond control. By the sea and in the silent valleys, On the lakes where morning mists arise, Or in gardens old, through flowery alleys, Still they liveâthose gleams of Paradise: Dim, too dim, alas! for aught but feeling, Light,âtoo light for mind to hold them long; Only now and then a form revealing, Summoned by the magic spell of Song. For the artist is the true magician! Form may die, but harmony still lives; Death and Time may take away volition, Not the reflex which true beauty gives To Art creativeâand thus every poet Who brings soul-music forth with many a pain, Like her of Endor, though he may not know it, To others shows the glorious dead again. IN A DREAM. AND thou shalt walk as in a dream, Thine eyes bewildered by the gleam Of blending light, till future years Have chased thy present midnight fears. And thou shalt walk as in a dream, Yet oft through memory will it seem That one who should have been a guideâ Or friend, is wanting by thy side. And thou shalt walk as in a dream, With nothing as it now doth seem; Till all delusion pass away, And thou'rt alone in brightest day. For in thy heart thou bear'st the key Which yet must set thy spirit free, And lead thee to th' eternal stream:â Though now thou walkest in a dream. PARADISE LOST. AND we are in the winter, Sadly chilled with frost and snow! Oh, how strange amid my memories Seems last summer's rosy glow. When your bright eyes opened on me Like two dew-filled lotus flowers, When I saw myself reflected In the depths of Heaven's bowers. But in my deepest rapture It all vanishedâand I fell Back to artificial roses:â Heavenly lotus, fare thee well! THE DIFFERENCE. CLOTILDA writes such glowing verses, Maria scarce with prose can play; Ah me! how oft an idle fancy Leads mortals from the narrow way. For when it came to real singing Clotilda dared not hum a line, While fair Maria, like a Sappho, Poured forth her soul in thrills divine. HOW THE ENGINEER DIED AT DESJARDINS.â The engineer (brave fellow) whistled âdown brakes,â and while endeavouring to avert the catastrophe went down with the engine. Instead of attempting to escape at the first warning, he staid until the moment when the engine was precipitated into the abyss, and was reversing it and endeavouring to prevent if possible the fatal results.ââ N. Y. Albany Evening Journal, 1856. THE locomotive screamed along, A darting death on wings; And the smoke puffed out its masses black, As hell its legions flings, Over the track, right down the road, Swift as the desert wind, With a draw-bridge gaping wide before, And a hundred souls behind. The engineer looked out, and saw That hope was all in vain, Yet whistled to the brakesmanâdown! âI'll die, or save the train.â And did he leap to save himself? Noâin a desperate strife He wrestled with the Iron Fiend, True to the last in life. True to the heart, not caring though The last faint chance were gone, While like a thundering avalanche The roaring train flew on, Right o'er the drawâright down the gulf, In one tremendous fall. 'Mid screaming steam and crashing iron, Went engineer and all. Man of the road!âMay truth itself Judge well this thought of mine, That I do deem it worth a life To die a death like thine! The Roll of Honour will not end, Nor the Martyrs' list be done, Till that Desjardins engineer Be written down as one. SONGS OF THE AMERICAN WAR OF EMANCIPATION, 1861â1865. THE KNIGHT AND THE DRAGON. July, 1861. WHEN I wandered in the land of Art 'Mid the sharp-tipped dreams, where blue Madonnas Sit like butterflies upon a sunflower, Framed in fragments of the Golden Ages, Oft I noted that in all Cathedrals, Here or there amid grotesquest carving, One quaint symbol never was forgottenâ Soon or later I was sure to find it Lurking somewhere in entrellised columns; Peeping strangely through a gnarling impost, Always came the strange Masonic symbol Of a warrior, helmeted and sworded, Fighting grimly with a devil dragon. Good old priests have told me that the figure Simply meant St George:âyou know the storyâ Deeper heads will have it 'tis a symbol, Persian-oldâthe myth of Light and Darkness, Ahriman and Ormuzd fiercely fighting, Ever fighting the great world-old battle. And it is the fight of Light and Darkness, The great fight of God against the Devil; The great fight of Tyranny and Freedom; Truth and Right against foul Might and Falsehood: Many a thousand years the two have battledâ Tell me, is it an unending struggle? Many voices cry, âIt is unending; Man is damned by birth, for black transgression And the lust of power are his nature, Slavery, like sin, must last for ever: Woe unto the weakerâwoe eternal; God and Sin and Pain have plainly spoken, And the Earth will ne'er be free from bondage.â Let me see once more that ancient carving: No; it is not a mere balanced battle; True, the knight seems smothered by the dragon, True, the foul and snaky folds are round him; True, he gasps amid the flame and poison; But his blade is in the monster's vitals, And the grisly drake is slowly dying. Yes, although so slowly, he is dying; Many thousand years have fled in darkness Since the sword first cut his scaly armour, And the red wound roused him into madness; But the good knight is of race immortalâ Ever young, and passionate, and fearless; And the strength which oozes from the dragon Blooms reviving in the glorious warrior. Ancient dragon, you are slowly dying! Golden warrior, ever fairer, stronger! Child of Light, my great Prometheus-Balder, Dear and beautiful and never-fading, Rouse! for now the fire-drake makes him ready For his maddest, fiercest, foulest struggleâ Rouse! Oh, countrymen! men of the Northland All around you twines the Southern dragon, All your life is blent with subtle poison, All your veins are fired with heat infernal, From the loathsome devil's spume and breathing: Strike, my warrior, strike him dead for ever! End the world-old strife between the oppressor And the oppressed: press on, for you must conquer. Now the good knight frees him from the dragon, Casts aside the ancient heavy armour, Bathes him in the purest light of heaven, In the intensest lucent-flowing spirit; White and beautiful and lithe and naked, Oh! how golden fair withouten armour! True, it shielded him for many ages; True, it guarded him against the dragon; But it always was a heavy armour, Girding, smothering, chafing unto bleeding Those fair limbs of ivory-purest beauty: Strange that thousands should have dreamed that armour Was his chiefest charm and best worth keeping;â Soul of Beauty;ârule this world for ever. A SONG OF '62. THERE'S a sorrowful old story how the army of the Turk Once fell into an ambush, full of blood and evil work; When the fate-believing Moslem, caring not that all was gone, With sword a-sheath and eyes firm closed right into death rode on. He could not flyâhis hour had comeâand so he kissed the rod With La il Allah! on his lips, gave all the rest to God: Down rolled the rocksâthe muskets roaredâin heaps the Faithful fell, But one escaped of all the host the dreadful tale to tell. But there's another story, how a slave, in cruel sport, Was thrown unto a tiger before the Roman court. The man was born of fighting blood, and so he turned at bay: The Roman at the tiger!âand the great brute slunk away! Hurrah! we're called to battleâhurrah! the word is âfight!â We've a bloody day before us, perhaps a deathly night. But let there happen what there may in all our battlework, We'll pattern by the Roman, and never by the Turk. CAVALRY SONG. 1862. WEAPONED well to war we ride, With sabres ringing by our side, The warning knell of death to all, Who hold the holiest cause in thrall, The sacred Right Which grows to Might, The day which dawns in blood-red light. Weaponed well to war we ride, To conquer, tide what may betide, Since never yet beneath the sun Was battle by the devil won; For what to thee Defeat may be Time makes a glorious victory. Weaponed well to war we rideâ Who braves the battle wins the bride; Who dies the death for truth shall be Alive in love eternally. Though dead he lies, Soft starry eyes Smile hope to him from purple skies. Weaponed well to war we ride:â Hurrah for the surging thunder-tide! When the cannon's roar makes all seem large, And the war-horse screams in the crashing charge, And the rider strong Whom he bears along Is a death-dart shot at the yielding throng. Weaponed well to war we ride: The bail is open, the hall is wide; The sabre as it quits the sheath, And beams with the lurid light of death, And the deadly glance Of the glittering lance, Are the taper-lights of the battle-dance. Weaponed well to war we ride, Find your foeman on either side; But woe to those who miss the time When one false step is a deadly crime: Who loses breath In the dance of death Wins nor wears nor wants the wreath. Weaponed well to war we rideâ Our swords are keen and our cause is tried; When the sharp edge cuts and the blood runs free, May we die in the hour of victory! We feel no dreadâ The battle bed, Where'er it be, has heaven o'erhead. THE PROCLAMATION. This poem was written on the day when the Proclamation appeared. September 22, 1862. NOW who has done the greatest deed Which History has ever known? And who in Freedom's direst need Became her bravest champion? Who a whole continent set free? Who killed the curse and broke the ban Which made a lie of liberty? YouâFather Abrahamâyou're the man! The deed is done. Millions have yearned To see the spear of freedom cast:â The dragon writhed and roared and burned: You've smote him full and square at last. O Great and True! You do not know, You cannot tellâyou cannot feel How far through time your name must go, Honoured by all men, high or low, Wherever Freedom's votaries kneel. This wide world talks in many a tongueâ This world boasts many a noble stateâ In all your praises will be sung, In all the great will call you great. Freedom! Where'er that word is known, On silent shore, by sounding sea, 'Mid millions or in deserts lone, Your noble name shall ever be. The word is outâthe deed is doneâ The spear is castâdread no delay. When such a steed is fairly on Fate never fails to find a way. Hurrah! hurrah! The track is clear, We know your policy and plan; We'll stand by you through every year: Now, Father Abraham, you're our man. WHEN THE CAPTAIN IS READY TO RIDE. February 17, 1863. AirââWas helfen mir tausend Ducaten, tra la.â IN the morning when trumpets are sounding, tra la, Our horses are quickly untied, And fast down the road we go boundingâtra la, Or over the meadow-land ride; CHORUS. For we are the boys of the sword, Who can jump from the bed or the board, And be off like a shot to the skirmishing hot, When the Captain is ready to ride. âWell, scout, have you something to tell us?ââtra la, âThe rebels are hid by the hill, And the fellows believe they can sell usâah ha! But I know of a road by the mill.â âWe'll give them no chances to turn on the heel, We'll give them the powder and ball; We'll give them the bullet, we'll give them the steel; We'll give them the devil and all!â Hurrah for the battle! Hurrah for a bout! How we scatter the soldiers of sin! When our cavalry spreads like a thunder-cloud out, And drives like a thunderbolt in. Hurrah for the men of the sword! Who fight for the cause of the Lord! Oh, the sabre's sharp edge is the entering wedge In a war to let liberty in. THE BEGINNING OF THE END. October 27, 1864. THAT I have lived to know this time, That I have lived this fight to see, Through Slavery's night to Freedom's prime, Is Heaven's own holiest joy to me. I do not ask to see the end, For what am I to be so blest? Enough for me the strife's begun, And God will care for all the rest. Through blood-red clouds the light I see, Nunc dimittis Domine! Gone are those nightmares of the past, The hardening fearâthe lingering doubt, If Lord or Slave unto the last Must be our parts to still act out. How oft they cameâthose fiendish thoughts, Like vampires rising from the grave; âOh, call your labour what you will, The labourer is always slave.â From all devilish doubt set free, Nunc dimittis Domine! The world has seen a thousand wars, To test humanity's great truth, Yet still the prison kept its bars, And still the strife was one of youth, Of headlong Youth with wary Age: But Man is somewhat wiser grown, While Ancient Evil weakens fast, And soon it shall be overthrown. Saints have prayed this time to see, Nunc dimittis Domine! And thus spoke God: âOut of the Northâ (In every age the place of doom), âBehold, great evil shall come forth.â Wail! South-land, wail!âfor it has come. âWoe to the South!ââthe word went forth In solemn warning years ago, And many on the border laughed:â The bolt is shotânow let it go! Lord! we bow our heads to thee! Nunc dimittis Domine! Ho! Northmen of the stormy coast! Ye chosen with the avenging sword, Called forthâit is no idle boastâ To do the bidding of the Lord, Go on! And this ye shall not lose, This to your name shall glory lend, That Northmen in the world's long fight First brought the battle towards an end. 'Tis the end of Slavery. Nunc dimittis Domine! FREE! 1865. FREE, free, free The whole land shall be, North and South, from sea to sea, Freeâfor ever free! Free, free, free Shall all our labour be, Without a lash, without a chain, Without reproach, without a strain, Without a sneer or rankling word, Without a dungeon and the cord:â North and South, from sea to sea, Freeâfor ever free! Free, free, free Our Speech shall ever be; Far as Earth's waters run and ring, Far as the wild birds soar or sing, Where voice may speak and voice reply, And white-winged sheets like angels fly, North and South, from sea to sea, Freeâfor ever free! Free, free, free Our Thought shall ever be, Yes, freer yet with every year; What man may dare or heart holds dear Shall ring and roll through every land In speech which all may understand. North and South, from sea to sea, Freeâfor ever free. Free, free, free! And God our guide shall be! He led our fathers on of old Through trials dark and manifold, Till they the mark appointed won; Us will he lead yet further on, Till all shall be, from sea to sea, Freeâfor ever free. REAL INCIDENTS. BLUE AND GREY. December, 1865. I. âTHE only difference in your war,â I heard a stranger say, âIs that one side is dressed in blue, The other clad in grey.â I went into a Federal camp, I heard the soldiers cry: âHurrah! there come the newspapers!â And saw them rush to buy. I went along the Valley Road, And met upon my way Ten of Lee's straggling infantry, All dressed in rebel grey. One held a proclamation out, And as I stopped my steed, Said: âTell us what this paper says? For none of us can read!â And I spoke out:ââIf you could read, And find out what is true, Instead of wearing Davis grey, You'd bear the Lincoln blue.â Grey is the colour of the dust In which the serpent crawls, And blue the hue of heaven, which looks Down on earth's prison walls. II. ONE day, when I was on the march, In Eighteen Sixty-three, The very day when General Meade Was driving General Lee Before him out of Maryland, With all his chivalry: We passed a school-house on the road, The benches scattered round; But, ah! the scholars, where were they? For no familiar sound Of lessons conned, or pleasant play, Was heard in all the bound. I entered, and I stood alone; The troop went slowly by, And fainter grew the captain's tone, And faint the driver's cry; The heavy cannon's clank and groan Still lessened, passing further on, Yet never seemed to die:â Was it an echo all my own, Or the wild brook running nigh? I looked around, and on the walls I read in writing clear: âWe've gained the day, we'll soon have all The country far and near,â Signed by a rebel officer, A boasting cavalier. Hodie tibi, cras mihi, Beneath this vaunting strain, âTo-day is thine, to-morrow mine,â I wrote as clear and plain: No doubt it pleased the schoolmaster When he came back again! 'Twixt Boonsboro' and Hagerstown That log-hut school-house stands, The writing still upon the wall: But where are now the bands Which swept so proudly up and down, O'er all the border lands?â Oh! whither went the stately house Which stood upon the sands? The foregoing incidents are from my own personal experience.â C. G. L. THE END.</field>
