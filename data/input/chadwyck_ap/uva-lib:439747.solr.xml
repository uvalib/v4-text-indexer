      <field name="fulltext">VAGABONDIA. Off with the fetters That chafe and restrain! Off with the chain! Here Art and Letters, Music and wine, And Myrtle and Wanda, The winsome witches, Blithely combine. Here are true riches, Here is Golconda, Here are the Indies, Here we are freeâ Free as the wind is, Free as the sea, Free! Houp-la! What have we To do with the way Of the Pharisee? We go or we stay At our own sweet will; We think as we say, And we say or keep still At our own sweet will, At our own sweet will. Here we are free To be good or bad, Sane or mad, Merry or grim As the mood may be,â Free as the whim Of a spook on a spree,â Free to be oddities, Not mere commodities, Stupid and salable, Wholly available, Ranged upon shelves; Each with his puny form In the same uniform, Cramped and disabled; We are not labelled, We are ourselves. Here is the real, Here the ideal; Laughable hardship Met and forgot, Glory of bardshipâ World's bloom and world's blot; The shock and the jostle, The mock and the push, But hearts like the throstle A-joy in the bush; Wits that would merrily Laugh away wrong, Throats that would verily Melt Hell in Song. What though the dimes be Elusive as rhymes be, And Bessie, with finger Uplifted, is warning That breakfast next morning (A subject she 's scorning) Is mighty uncertain! What care we? Linger A moment to kissâ No time 's amiss To a vagabond's ardorâ Then finish the larder And pull down the curtain. Unless ere the kiss come, Black Richard or Bliss come, Or Tom with a flagon, Or Karl with a jag onâ Then up and after The joy of the night With the hounds of laughter To follow the flight Of the fox-foot hours That double and run Through brakes and bowers Of folly and fun. With the comrade heart For a moment's play, And the comrade heart For a heavier day, And the comrade heart Forever and aye. For the joy of wine Is not for long; And the joy of song Is a dream of shine; But the comrade heart Shall outlast art And a woman's love The fame thereof. But wine for a sign Of the love we bring! And song for an oath That Love is king! And both, and both For his worshipping! Then up and away Till the break of day, With a heart that 's merry And a Tom-and-Jerry, And a derry-down-derryâ What 's that you say, You highly respectable Buyers and sellers? We should be decenter? Not as we please inter Custom, frugality, Use and morality In the delectable Depths of wine-cellars? Midnights of revel, And noondays of song! Is it so wrong? Go to the Devil! I tell you that we, While you are smirking And lying and shirking Life's duty of duties, Honest sincerity, We are in verity Free! Free to rejoice In blisses and beauties! Free as the voice Of the wind as it passes! Free as the bird In the weft of the grasses! Free as the word Of the sun to the seaâ Free! EVENING ON THE POTOMAC. The fervid breath of our flushed Southern May Is sweet upon the city's throat and lips, As a lover's whose tired arm slips Listlessly over the shoulder of a queen. Far away The river melts in the unseen. Oh, beautiful Girl-City, how she dips Her feet in the stream With a touch that is half a kiss and half a dream! Her face is very fair, With flowers for smiles and sunlight in her hair. My westland flower-town, how serene she is! Here on this hill from which I look at her, All is still as if a worshipper Left at some shrine his offering. Soft winds kiss My cheek with a slow lingering. A luring whisper where the laurels stir Wiles my heart back to woodland-ward again. But lo, Across the sky the sunset couriers run, And I remain To watch the imperial pageant of the Sun Mock me, an impotent Cortez here below, With splendors of its vaster Mexico. O Eldorado of the templed clouds! O golden city of the western sky! Not like the Spaniard would I storm thy gates; Not like the babe stretch chubby hands and cry To have thee for a toy; but far from crowds, Like my Faun brother in the ferny glen, Peer from the wood's edge while thy glory waits, And in the darkening thickets plunge again. DOWN THE SONGO. I. Floating! Floatingâand all the stillness waits And listens at the ivory gates, Full of a dim uncertain presage Of some strange, undelivered message. There is no sound save from the bush The alto of the shy wood-thrush, And ever and anon the dip Of a lazy oar. The rhythmic drowsiness keeps time To hazy subtleties of rhyme That seem to slip Through the lulled soul to seek the sleepy shore. The idle clouds go floating by; Above us sky, beneath us sky; The sun shines on us as we lie Floating. It is a dream. It is a dream, my love; see how The ripples quiver at the prow, And all the long reflections shake Unsteadily beneath the lake. The mists about the uplands show Dim violet towers that come and go. Phantasmagoric palaces Rise trembling there, As though one breath of waking weather Would crash their airy walls together With sudden stress, While silent detonations shook the airâ Vast fabrics toppling to the ground And vanishing without a sound. Ah, love, these are not what we deem; It is a dream. II. Let us dream on, then,âdream and die Ere the dream pass. Let us for once, like idle flowers, Let slip the unregarded hours, Like the wise flowers that lie Unfretted by a feeble thought, Future and past alike forgot, Drinking the dew contentedly In the cool grass. III. Look yonder where the clouds float; could we glide As they, across the sky's blue shoreless tide, What better were it than to dream Across yon lake and into this still stream? IV. Trees and a glimpse of sky! And the slow river, quiet as a pool! And thou and Iâand thou and Iâ Kiss me! How soft the air is and how cool! THE WANDER-LOVERS. Down the world with Marna! That 's the life for me! Wandering with the wandering wind, Vagabond and unconfined! Roving with the roving rain Its unboundaried domain! Kith and kin of wander-kind, Children of the sea! Petrels of the sea-drift! Swallows of the lea! Arabs of the whole wide girth Of the wind-encircled earth! In all climes we pitch our tents, Cronies of the elements, With the secret lords of birth Intimate and free. All the seaboard knows us From Fundy to the Keys; Every bend and every creek Of abundant Chesapeake; Ardise hills and Newport coves And the far-off orange groves, Where Floridian oceans break, Tropic tiger seas. Down the world with Marna, Tarrying there and here! Just as much at home in Spain As in Tangier or Touraine! Shakespeare's Avon knows us well, And the crags of NeufchÃ¢tel; And the ancient Nile is fain Of our coming near. Down the world with Marna, Daughter of the air! Marna of the subtle grace, And the vision in her face! Moving in the measures trod By the angels before God! With her sky-blue eyes amaze And her sea-blue hair! Marna with the trees' life In her veins a-stir! Marna of the aspen heart Where the sudden quivers start! Quick-responsive, subtle, wild! Artless as an artless child, Spite of all her reach of art! Oh, to roam with her! Marna with the wind's will, Daughter of the sea! Marna of the quick disdain, Starting at the dream of stain! At a smile with love aglow, At a frown a statued woe, Standing pinnacled in pain Till a kiss sets free! Down the world with Marna, Daughter of the fire! Marna of the deathless hope, Still alert to win new scope Where the wings of life may spread For a flight unhazarded! Dreaming of the speech to cope With the heart's desire! Marna of the far quest After the divine! Striving ever for some goal Past the blunder-god's control! Dreaming of potential years When no day shall dawn in fears! That 's the Marna of my soul, Wander-bride of mine! DISCOVERY. When the bugler morn shall wind his horn, And we wake to the wild to be, Shall we open our eyes on the selfsame skies And stare at the selfsame sea? O new, new day! though you bring no stay To the strain of the sameness grim, You are new, new, newânew through and through, And strange as a lawless dream. Will the driftwood float by the lonely boat And our prisoner hearts unbar, As it tells of the strand of an unseen land That lies not far, not far? O new, new hope! O sweep and scope Of the glad, unlying sea! You are new, new, newâwith the promise true Of the dreamland isles to be. Will the land-birds fly across the sky, Though the land is not to see? Have they dipped and passed in the sea-line vast? Have we left the land a-lee? O new despair: though the hopeless air Grow foul with the calm and grieves, You are new, new, newâand we cleave to you As a soul to its freedom cleaves. Does the falling night hide fiends to fight And phantoms to affray? What demons lurk in the grisly mirk, As the night-watch waits for day? O strange new gloom! we await the doom, And what doom none may deem; But it 's new, new, newâand we'll sail it through, While the mocking sea-gulls scream. A light, a light, in the dead of night, That lifts and sinks in the waves! What folk are they who have kindled its ray,â Men or the ghouls of graves? O new, new fear! near, near and near, And you bear us weal or woe! But you 're new, new, newâso a cheer for you! And onwardâfriend or foe! Shall the lookout call from the foretop tall, âLand, land!â with a maddened scream, And the crew in glee from the taffrail see Where the island palm-trees dream? New heart, new eyes! For the morning skies Are a-chant with their green and gold! New, new, new, newânew through and through! New, new till the dawn is old! A SONG BY THE SHORE. âLose and loveâ is love's first art; So it was with thee and me, For I first beheld thy heart On the night I last saw thee. Pine-woods and mysteries! Sea-sands and sorrows! Hearts fluttered by a breeze That bodes dark morrows, morrows,â Bodes dark morrows! Moonlight in sweet overflow Poured upon the earth and sea! Lovelight with intenser glow In the deeps of thee and me! Clasped hands and silences! Hearts faint and throbbing! The weak wind sighing in the trees! The strong surf sobbing, sobbing,â The strong surf sobbing! A HILL SONG. Hills where once my love and I Let the hours go laughing by! All your woods and dales are sad,â You have lost your Oread. Falling leaves! Silent woodlands! Half your loveliness is fled. Golden-rod, wither now! Winter winds, come hither now! All the summer joy is dead. There 's a sense of something gone In the grass I linger on. There 's an under-voice that grieves In the rustling of the leaves. Pine-clad peaks! Rushing waters! Glens where we were once so glad! There 's a light passed from you, There 's a joy outcast from you,â You have lost your Oread. AT SEA. As a brave man faces the foe, Alone against hundreds, and sees Death grin in his teeth, But, shutting his lips, fights on to the end Without speech, without hope, without flinching,â So, silently, grimly, the steamer Lurches ahead through the night. A beacon-light far off, Twinkling across the waves like a star! But no star in the dark overhead! The splash of waters at the prow, and the evil light Of the death-fires flitting like will-o'-the-wisps beneath! And beyond Silence and night! I sit by the taffrail, Alone in the dark and the blown cold mist and the spray, Feeling myself swept on irresistibly, Sunk in the night and the sea, and made one with their footfall-less onrush, Letting myself be borne like a spar adrift Helplessly into the night. Without fear, without wish, Insensate save of a dull, crushed ache in my heart, Careless whither the steamer is going, Conscious only as in a dream of the wet and the dark And of a form that looms and fades indistinctly Everywhere out of the night. O love, how came I here? Shall I wake at thy side and smile at my dream? The dream that grips me so hard that I cannot wake nor stir! O love! O my own love, found but to be lost! My soul sends over the waters a wild inarticulate cry, Like a gull's scream heard in the night. The mist creeps closer. The beacon Vanishes astern. The sea's monotonous noises Lapse through the drizzle with a listless, subsiding cadence. And thou, O love, and the sea throb on in my brain together, While the steamer plunges along, Butting its way through the night. ISABEL. In her body's perfect sweet Suppleness and languor meet,â Arms that move like lapsing billows, Breasts that Love would make his pillows, Eyes where vision melts in bliss, Lips that ripen to a kiss. CONTEMPORARIES. âA barbered woman's man,ââyes, so He seemed to me a twelvemonth since; And so he may beâlet it goâ Admit his flawsâwe need not wince To find our noblest not all great. What of it? He is still the prince, And we the pages of his state. The world applauds his words; his fame Is noised wherever knowledge be; Even the trader hears his name, As one far inland hears the sea; The lady quotes him to the beau Across a cup of Russian tea; They know him and they do not know. I know him. In the nascent years Men's eyes shall see him as one crowned; His voice shall gather in their ears With each new age prophetic sound; And you and I and all the rest, Whose brows to-day are laurel-bound, Shall be but plumes upon his crest. A year ago this man was poor,â This Alfred whom the nations praise; He stood a beggar at my door For one mere word to help him raise From fainting limbs and shoulders bent The burden of the weary days; And I withheld itâand he went. I knew him then, as I know now, Our largest heart, our loftiest mind; Yet for the curls upon his brow And for his lisp, I could not find The helping word, the cheering touch. Ah, to be just, as well as kind,â It costs so little and so much! It seemed unmanly in my sight That he, whose spirit was so strong To lead the blind world to the light, Should look so like the mincing throng Who advertise the tailor's art. It angered meâI did him wrongâ I grudged my groat and shut my heart. I might have been the prophet's friend, Helped him who is to help the world! Now, when the striving is at end, The reek-stained battle-banners furled, And the age hears its muster-call, Then I, because his hair was curled, I shall have lost my chanceâthat 's all. A TOAST. Here's a health to thee, Roberts, And here 's a health to me; And here 's to all the pretty girls From Denver to the sea! Here 's to mine and here 's to thine! Now 's the time to clink it! Here 's a flagon of old wine, And here are we to drink it. Wine that maketh glad the heart Of the bully boy! Here 's the toast that we love most, âLove and song and joy!â Song that is the flower of love, And joy that is the fruit! Here 's the love of woman, lad, And here 's our love to boot! You and I are far too wise Not to fill our glasses. Here 's to me and here 's to thee, And here 's to all the lasses! THE KAVANAGH. A stone jug and a pewter mug, And a table set for three! A jug and a mug at every place, And a biscuit or two with Brie! Three stone jugs of Cruiskeen Lawn, And a cheese like crusted foam! The Kavanagh receives to-night! McMurrough is at home! We three and the barley-bree! And a health to the one away, Who drifts down careless Italy, God's wanderer and estray! For friends are more than Arno's store Of garnered charm, and he Were blither with us here the night Than Titian bids him be. Throw ope the window to the stars, And let the warm night in! Who knows what revelry in Mars May rhyme with rouse akin? Fill up and drain the loving cup And leave no drop to waste! The moon looks in to see what 's upâ Begad, she 'd like a taste! What odds if Leinter's kingly roll Be now an idle thing? The world is his who takes his toll, A vagrant or a king. What though the crown be melted down, And the heir a gypsy roam? The Kavanagh receives to-night! McMurrough is at home! We three and the barley-bree! And the moonlight on the floor! Who were a man to do with less? What emperor has more? Three stone jugs of Cruiskeen Lawn, And three stout hearts to drain A slanter to the truth in the heart of youth And the joy of the love of men. THE BUCCANEERS. Oh, not for us the easy mirth Of men that never roam! The crackling of the narrow hearth, The cabined joys of home! Keep your tame, regulated glee, O pale protected State! Our dwelling-place is on the sea, Our joy the joy of Fate! No long caresses give us ease, No lazy languors warm; We seize our mates as the sea-gulls seize, And leave them to the storm. But in the bridal halls of gloom The couch is stern and strait; For us the marriage rite of Doom, The nuptial joy of Fate. Wine for the weaklings of the town, Their lucky toasts to drain! Our skoal for them whose star goes down, Our drink the drink of men! No Bacchic ivy for our brows! Like vikings, we await The grim, ungarlanded carouse We keep to-night with Fate. Ho, gamesters of the pampered court! What stakes are those at strife? Your thousands are but paltry sport To them that play for life. You risk doubloons, and hold your breath, Win groats, and wax elate; But we throw loaded dice with Death, And call the turn on Fate. The kings of earth are crowned with care, Their poets wail and sigh; Our music is to do and dare, Our empire is to die. Against the storm we fling our glee And shout, till Time abate The exultation of the sea, The fearful joy of Fate. THE OUTLAW. Oh, let my lord laugh in his halls When he the tale shall tell! But woe to Jarlwell and its walls When I shall laugh as well! And he that laughs the last, lads, Laughs well, laughs well! He 's lord of many a burg and farm And mickle thralls and gold, And I am but my own right arm, My dwelling-place the wold. But when we twain meet face to face, He will not laugh so bold. The shame he chuckles as he shows This time he need not tell; I'll give his body to the crows, And his black soul to Hell. For he that laughs the last, lads, Laughs well, laughs well! THE KING'S SON. âDaughter, daughter, marry no man, Though a king's son come to woo, If he be not more than blessing or ban To the secret soul of you.â â'Tis the King's son, indeed, I ween, And he left me even but now, And he shall make me a dazzling queen, With a gold crown on my brow.â âAnd are you one that a golden crown, Or the lust of a name can lure? You had better wed with a country clown, And keep your young heart pure.â âMother, the King has sworn, and said That his son shall wed but me; And I must gang to the prince's bed, Or a traitor I shall be.â âOh, what care you for an old man's wrath? Or what care you for a king? I had rather you fled on an outlaw's path, A rebel, a hunted thing.â âMother, it is my father's will, For the King has promised him fair A goodly earldom of hollow and hill, And a coronet to wear.â âThen woe is worth a father's name, For it names your dourest foe! I had rather you came the child of shame Than to have you fathered so.â âMother, I shall have gold enow, Though love be never mine, To buy all else that the world can show Of good and fair and fine.â âOh, what care you for a prince's gold, Or the key of a kingdom's till? I had rather see you a harlot bold That sins of her own free will. âFor I have been wife for the stomach's sake, And I know whereof I say; A harlot is sold for a passing slake, But a wife is sold for aye. âBody and soul for a lifetime sell, And the price of the sale shall be That you shall be harlot and slave as well Until Death set you free.â LAURANA'S SONG. FOR âA LADY OF VENICE.â Who'll have the crumpled pieces of a heart? Let him take mine! Who'll give his whole of passion for a part, And call 't divine? Who'll have the soiled remainder of desire? Who'll warm his fingers at a burnt-out fire? Who'll drink the lees of love, and cast i' the mire The nobler wine? Let him come here, and kiss me on the mouth, And have his will! Love dead and dry as summer in the South When winds are still And all the leafage shrivels in the heat! Let him come here and linger at my feet Till he grow weary with the over-sweet, And die, or kill. LAUNA DEE. Weary, oh, so weary With it all! Sunny days or drearyâ How they pall! Why should we be heroes, Launa Dee, Striving to no winning? Let the world be Zero's! As in the beginning Let it be! What good comes of toiling, When all 's done? Frail green sprays for spoiling Of the sun; Laurel leaf or myrtle, Love or fameâ Ah, what odds what spray, sweet? Time, that makes life fertile, Makes its blooms decay, sweet, As they came. Lie here with me dreaming, Cheek to cheek, Lithe limbs twined and gleaming, Brown and sleek; Like two serpents coiling In their lair. Where 's the good of wreathing Sprays for Time's despoiling? Let me feel your breathing In my hair. You and I togetherâ Was it so? In the August weather Long ago! Did we kiss and fellow, Side by side, Till the sunbeams quickened From our stalks great yellow Sunflowers, till we sickened There and died? Were we tigers creeping Through the glade Where our prey lay sleeping, Unafraid, In some Eastern jungle? Better so. I am sure the snarling Beasts could never bungle Life as men do, darling, Who half know. Ah, if all of life, love, Were the living! Just to cease from strife, love, And from grieving; Let the swift world pass us, You and me, Stilled from all aspiring,â Sinai nor Parnassus Longer worth desiring, Launa Dee! Just to live like lilies In the lake! Where no thought nor will is, To mistake! Just to lose the human Eyes that weep! Just to cease from seeming Longer man and woman! Just to reach the dreaming And the sleep!</field>
