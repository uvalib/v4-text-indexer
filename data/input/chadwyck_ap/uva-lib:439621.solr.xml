      <field name="fulltext">MAY: 1859. The meadow-wooing Spring doth not forget To smile upon our toilsome city squares, Though men perceive her notâlike schoolboys set To daily tasks, and bent with life-long cares; Yet, even in our thraldom, have we met The light of bluer than the winter sky At office-windowsâsomething freer yet, Than lately breathed, in zephyrs passing by; Aye, and in yon walled church-yard can espy Green rustling branches:âO to be away! To list the birds sing and the breezes sigh In well remembered valleys! Thou and I, Dear Love, would roam once more a truant day, Living as we were wont to live in May. ITALY. Beyond the blue Atlantic lifts a land, In many a vineyard terrace, from the sea, And not alone those waters, lovingly, Roll toward her, but every freeman's hand Points thitherward, to cheer the noble band, Whose flowing blood shall make this fair land free: For, like a precious casket, Italy. Set round with jewelled memories doth standâ Full of her thousand gems of Art and Song. But, Italy, for me thou dost contain Three treasures richer than are said to throng Thine Angelo's or Raffael's richest vein: Mother and Sisters! unto you belong My heart, and all the passion of this strain. CHRISTMAS: 1857. Close on the ending of a doleful year, Sweet Christmas chimes and carollings, awhile, With blessed reminiscences, beguile Men's restless hearts and soothe away their fear; Ah, then! from Heaven looking to our sphere, Which He alone to Heaven could reconcile, Our Lord, amid His perfect joy, doth smile To seeâwherever men such music hearâ All human sufferers, on this dear morn, When into human life He erst was born, Forget their ancient curse and myriad woes, Feeling the bliss that some fair planet knows, Where never entered Sin, and Doubt, and Scorn, To bring the need of a Redeemer's throes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">âUnder the greenwood tree, Who loves to lie with me, And tune his merry note Unto the sweet bird's throat, Come hither, come hither, come hither! Here shall he see No enemy, But winter and rough weather.â AS YOU LIKE IT. THE RIME OF THE ELLE-KING. I. Long years ago, in idle greenwood time, When fairies tript it merrily on the toe, With roundels gay and many a tinkling rhyme; When wrinkled hags their sorcery muttered low, And forms of evil flitted to and fro In dark attendance on the magic spell; When woods were elfin-hauntedâlong agoâ An aged good-wife dwelt within a dell The loveliest of Lorraineâromantic Epinel. II. Her cottage was enwreathed luxuriously With flowering lilac and sweet jessamine, And by its step there grew a linden-tree, Deckt all about with thorny eglantine; Two loving willows strove to intertwine Their yellow branchesâpendulous among Its straw-thatched gablesâwith the fragrant vine; A joyous brook, with gushing, wildwood song, Flowed aye between their gnarl'd and earth-black roots along. III. Above the low and diamond-latticed door An oaken cross was hungâthat whoso stept, Howbeit by chance, upon the cottage floor, Its silent benediction might accept; Before it oft Ursula prayed, and weptâ Though lorn of goodman and each darling sonâ In pious joy, as not yet quite bereft, With one fair daughter, spared to soothe her moan, And dearer to her heart than all those dear ones gone. IV. For Marguerite her every want supplied, And stayed with care her tottering steps and faint; And oft Ursula trudged along beside The maiden, seeming little else than saint, With silvery tresses flowing down her quaint ProvenÃ§al habitâwaited on in love By ministering seraph without taint; Or, in some strange acquaintance interwove, A grey, old falcon-hawk beside a mild-eyed dove. V. Ah, Marguerite, sweet pearl of Epinel! Fair lily of Lorraine!âhow should it fade, And vanish quite from that enamored dell! All living creatures loved the little maid, At her own mirrored beauty half affrayed; To whose clear eyes the faun and satyr-kind, And dryad wood-nymphs, rural homage paid; And then how tunefully her eager mind To legends old and tales of romance was inclined! VI. For at Ursula's footstool would she kneel, With frequent sigh and tremulous heart's delight, To list how royal Guinevere did steal Away with Launcelotâher own true knight; Anon would shudder with bewitching fright, When of dark goblins spake the ancient dameâ Of Roncesvalles and brave Orlando's fight; But most of all she loved to hear the fame Of Elf and Fairy, and the Elle-King's dreaded name. VII. The Elle-King, whoâas every wrinkled dame Throughout fair Epinel, with boding tongue, Told the scared children, that around them came Listening, with little hearts by terror wrungâ Held royal sway in Elfland, where were hung Live fairy-harps on every orange bough, Breathing wild music, and where, all among The groves and rills and blossoms, whispering low, Elf pledged his love to Fay in many a summer vow; VIII. And who, they said, would oft in mortal guise, Down in the vale, beneath the holly-tree, On haunted nights appear to maidens' eyes, And woo them with unearthly melody, Until their souls would all entrancÃ¨d be With shadowy forms of beauty, and they sighed In FaÃ«ry-land forever amorously To dwell, and be the Elle-King's stately bride:â Saint Denis aid fair damsels when thus sorely tried! IX. For past redemption would that maiden be Who, music-charmed, should yield her to the Fay! Such ballads sang the dames continually, And twirled the distaff through the live-long day; But Marguerite strayed thoughtfully away, And often all the legend o'er would dream, Whene'er at night she might forget to pray To good saint Denis, or the silvery stream Of moonlight on her couch shone in with ominous gleam. X. And so forevermore her little heart With young romance was easily beguiled: Sometimes throughout the forest, far apart From the wierd cottage, in the copses wild, She sought for elfin grottoes, and then smiled, And curled her dainty lip in high disdain, To see herself so like a simple child! But ah! what longings nestled in her brain, Like serpents twining round the Lily of Lorraine! XI. It is the Hallow Eve, when elves have power And dark enchantments fill the haunted air; When, through great castle-hall and ladye's bower, White faces glimmer, dank with mildewed hair; And sickly will-o-wisp his fiendish glare Throws, like a murderer's candle, through the mist, While shrouded Evil watches everywhere; Ah! the foul fiend is busy now, I wist, And all the goblin imps his dismal spells assist! XII. What timorous damsel dares to wander through The elfin glen on this ill-fated eve? Yet Margret will her venturous path pursue, In spite of all that simple girls believe: Though flutteringly her gentle breast may heave, Darkling she hastens onward, while old dreams A hundred pictures for her fancy weave, And on her spectral form the fire-fly gleams Through all the climbing fog, till like a ghost she seems; XIII. A ghost of maiden, by false lover's sin Heart-broken, and forever wandering where The traitor did her brightest jewel win; And why doth Marguerite alone repair, With robe of white and little ankles bare, Through the witch-haunted valley? Hear you not Saint Mary's chapel bell? and see the glare Of waxen taper, in the holy spot, Where all but pious vow and penance is forgot. XIV. Thither she turns her course mysteriously, And thither to our Lady fain would pray, That, on this night, in great benignity, All spells and demons she will guard away From her dear cottage, till the breaking day Upon Ursula and herself shall glow; With such kind purpose, in her pure array She hurries forthâbut ah! she needs must go Past the great holly-oak o'er-clomb with mistletoe. XV. Saint Mary be her guardian! for see, What sudden radiance beacons through the ferns, Of flame intense, and colored variously As that which in some perfumed censer burns! Boding the antique legend, Margret yearns, In all her terror, with a strange delight, And slowly toward those drooping branches turns, With half-way thrills of longingâhalf-affrightâ As one who fears, yet pines, to view some ghostly sight. XVI. What sees the maiden, that so fixed she stays? From what arch spell of elfin glamoury, Bathed in the light of those bewildering rays, In all her wonderment so loth to fly? For whom those parted lipsâthat passionate sigh? And see her now like Ariadne smile, When her god-lover shone out splendidly Before her eyes, and clasped her hand the while, And told his love divineâin Naxos' dewy isle; XVII. Smile at the vision of a youthful king, With coronal of ocean-emerald crowned, And amber hair, by many a gorgeous ring Of wreathÃ©d gold fantastically bound; 'Mong all her peasant lovers, that around The village-pole on merry-makings throng, Such stately courtesy she has not found, And beauty, which young maidens praise in song, Or picture to their hearts in summer day-dreams long. XVIII. And ah! with pure, harmonious, dying notes, More sweetly than the nightingale's sweet tune, Which, mystically uttered, ever floats Along the ether to the listening moon, He prays of Marguerite a gentle boon, That she to bannered FaÃ«ry-land will go, And share with him the Elle-King's pearly throne; Soft, as on DanaÃ« fell the golden snow, Falls on her charmed ear the elfin music low! Elfin Song. 1. Far in the western ocean's breast, The summer fairies have found a nest; The heavens ever unclouded smile Over the breadth of their beautiful isle; Through it a hundred streamlets flow, In spangled paths, to the sea below, And woo the vales, that beside them lie, With a low and tremulous minstrelsy. The elfin brood have homes they love In the earth below and skies above; But the haunt, which of all they love the best, Is the palm-crowned isle, in the ocean's breast, That mortals call Canary; And many an Ariel, blithesome, airy, And each laughing Fay and lithesome Fairy, Know well the mystical way in the West To the sweet isle of Canary. 2. With an ever-sounding choral chant, And a clear, cerulean, wild desire To clasp that fairy-island nigher, The sinuous waves of ocean pant; For here all natural things are free To mingle in passionate harmony. The light from their mirror turns away With a golden splendor, in the day, But nightly, when coronetted Even Marshals the shining queen of heaven, There gleams a silvery scenery, From the rim of the great prismatic sea Around the isle of Canary, To the central crags of Pisgatiri, Where the crested eagle builds his eyrie, Scanning the shores of sweet Canary. 3. Lustrously sailing here and there, Afloat in the beatific air, Birds, of purple and blue and gold, Pour out their music manifold; All day long in the leas they sing, While the sun-kist flowers are blossoming; At eve, when the dew-drop feeds the rose, And the fragrant water-lilies close, The marvellous-throated nightingale With a dying music floods each vale, Till the seaward breezes, listening, stay To catch the harmony of his lay And cool the air of Canary; And thus the melodies ever vary, In the vales of the ocean aviary, In the blissful valleys of sweet Canary. 4. The Elle-King's palace was builded there By elves of water and earth and air; Lovingly worked each loyal sprite, And it grew to life in a summer night; It grew to life like a summer thoughtâ A fit abode for the monarch's court: Over the sheen of its limpid moat, Wafted along, in a magic boat, By fairy wings that fan the sails, And eddying through enchanted vales, Through walls of amber and crystal gates, We come where a fairy-warder waits; And so, by many a winding way Where sweet bells jingle and fountains play, To the inmost, royalest room of allâ The elfin monarch's reception-hall, The pearl and pride of Canary! To guard its fastness the elves are wary, And no wierd thing, of pleasure chary, Can enter with evil in sweet Canary! 5. All that saddens, and care and pain, Are banished far from that fair domain; There forever, by day and night, Is nought but pleasance and Love's delight; Daily, the Genii of the flowers Shade with beauty a hundred bowers; Nightly, the Gnomes of precious stones Emblazon and light a hundred thrones: And the Elves of the field, so swift and mute, Bring wine and honey and luscious fruit; And the Sylphs of the air, at noontide, cool The depths of each bower and vestibule; And all are gayâfrom the tricksome Fay, Who flutters in woodlands far away, To the best-beloved attendant Elf, And the royal heart of the King himself, Who rules in bright Canary; And the laboring Fairies are blithe and merry, Who press the juice from the swollen berry That reddens the vines of sweet Canary. 6. What if there be a fated day When the FaÃ«ry Isle shall pass away, And its beautiful groves and fountains seem The myths of a long, delicious dream! A century's joys shall first repay Our hearts, for the evil of that day; And the Elfin-King has sworn to wed A daughter of Earth, whose child shall be, By cross and water hallowÃ©d, From the fairies' doom forever free: What if there be a fated day! It is far away! it is far away! Maiden, fair Maiden: I, who sing Of this summer isle, am the island King; I come from its joys to make thee mine: Half of my kingdom shall be thine: Our horses of air and ocean waitâ Then hasten, and share the Elle-King's state In the sweet isle of Canary; And many an Ariel, blithesome, airy, And each laughing Fay and lithesome Fairy, Shall rovingly hover around and over thee, And the love of a king shall evermore cover thee, Nightly and daily in sweet Canary. XIX. The wizard song is dying amorously, And Marguerite, by music's wondrous spell Enwrapt in more than mortal ecstasy, Forgets her home, nor heeds the chapel bell That tolls for restless souls a piteous knell, But, open-mouthed, with pallid, suppliant hands, Seems trembling with a longing naught may quell; Then all amort, like carvÃ©d marble, stands, And pants for summer bowers and joy in faÃ«ry-lands. XX. Now instant let her guardian angel charm Her love-lorn soul from that wierd minstrelsy, And kind Saint Denis, with protecting arm, Speed to her aidâor else the linden-tree Will never shade her more, and she will be A prisoned bird in gilded cage forlorn! And look! with white arms reaching languidly Toward that perilous beauty, she has gone Yet nearer to the Fayâthe elfin charm has won! XXI. Good bye for aye, lost pearl of Epinel! The chill November wind, with moaning loud, In ominous gusts bewailed through all the dell; Ursula, though so old and ague-bowed, Yet would her daughter seek, and wildly vowed To find the maidâlet weal or woe betide! Her aged limbs were hallowed by no shroud, And no sweet child stood weeping by her side, But, anguished and alone, in the drear storm she died. 1850. THE ALBUM. The Winter had but just begun, The hills with snow were white, Far southward sank the Christmas sun When first you bid meââWrite!â And, Lady, I had little thought That Spring its zephyrs would have brought, Its birds and sunny hours, Before the Album would have flown, Like carrier-dove, unto its own, With all its gathered flowers. But I have waited lingeringly, While many a Winter's day, And many a night, have speeded by In ominous array. Weeks have I loitered, till for shame I hardly dare to scrawl my name, Or bow me at your throne; Yet, Lady, I can featly prove, By every gallant law of Love, The fault is all your own. For I have not delayed so long Without a thought of duty, But oft have tried to pen a song In honor of your beauty, Which, in whatever mood or guise, Still seems diviner, to these eyes, Than to her Numa seemed Egeria'sâbeside the rill That, from their green Arician hill, Forever gushed and gleamed. But still sweet thoughts will fill one's mind, Whene'er, in rhyming mood, I take your book, and feel inclined To make my promise good: Sweet thoughts, like elves that wizards raise, Charming away the lonely days With pleasant witchery:â That form has bent above this book, Those eyes have given it many a look, That face has smiled on me! That hand has dallied with these leaves, And idly turned them o'er: What wonder that your poet grieves The Album to restore! These halcyon thoughts I would not lose, And wayward Fancy still pursues The memory of that smile, Till I am fain to close the book, And the fond song I undertook Defer a longer while. You could not blame me, should I keep Your Album always nigh, Else spoil the ruby of your lip, And dim that lustrous eye! For myriad memories will throng In graceful groups;âthe flowing song Give place to tender dreams, That supersede the minstrel's artâ Throw golden chains around his heart, And kindle future themes. THE INLAND CITY. Guarded by circling streams and wooded mountains, Like sentinels round a queen. Dotted with groves and musical with fountains, The city lies serene. Not far away the Atlantic tide diverges, And, up the southern shore Of gray New England, rolls in shortened surges, That murmur evermore. The fairy city! not for frowning castle Do I extol her name, Not for the gardens and the domes palatial Of oriental fame; Yet if there be one man who will not rally, One man, who sayeth not That of all cities in the Eastern valley Ours is the fairest spot; Then let him roam beneath those elms gigantic, Or idly wander where Shetucket flows meandering, where Yantic Leaps through the cloven air; Gleaming from rock to rock with sunlit motion, Then slumbering in the cove; So sinks the soul, from Passion's wild devotion, To the deep calm of Love. And journey with me to the village olden, Among whose devious ways, Are mossy mansions, rich with legends golden Of early forest days; Elysian time! when, by the rippling water, Or in the woodland groves, The Indian warrior and the Sachem's daughter Whispered their artless loves; Legends of fords, where Uncas made his transit, Fierce for the border war, And drove all day the alien Narragansett Back to his haunts afar; Tales of the after-time, when scant and humble Grew the Mohegan band, And Tracy, Griswold, Huntington and Trumbull, Were judges in the land. So let the caviler feast on old tradition, And then at sunset climb Up yon green hill, where, on his broadened vision May burst the view sublime! The city spires, with stately power impelling The soul to look above, And peaceful homes, in many a rural dwelling, Lit up with flames of love;â And then confess, nor longer idly dally, While sinks the lingering sun, That of all cities in the Eastern valley Ours is the fairest one. CHARLEY. God gave him, and, from year to year, The precious gift yet dearer grew, And breathed his gentle spirit through The beings he was sent to cheer. We watched him:âso the loving gaze Upon the petals of a rose, That spread and sweeten, as it grows To blossom in the donor's praise. One day, before our wondering eyes, Expanded by an inward power, The infant bud became a flower In all the hues of Paradise! The gift was taken, in full bloom; But flowers their odors leave behind, Diffusing all the tempered wind With Memory's sweet and sad perfume.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">âO isplendor di Dio, per cu' io vidi L'alto trionfo del regno verace, Dammi virtude a dir com' io lo vidi.â Dante: Il Paradiso. âNow more than ever seems it rich to die!â Keats. GLIMPSES OF HEAVEN. I. There comes a fresher coolness o'er the sea: New murmurs wander from the hither strand; Like music from a far-off land, Is heard the fisher's twilight glee; The white waves ripple on the sand; Eve opens wide, once more, The entrance on her sea without a shore, The gaze into Infinityâ That semblance of Divinity, That larger prospect than the Noonday bore! II. Now watch-lights beacon from afar, O'er restless waters, one by one; But in the western pathway of the sun, More luminous, the affluent Evening Star Loops up her silvery robe, and hastens on Through tideless depths, where no commotions are. Eastward great Aldebaran sheds his light; Behind him linger yet, in fear Of dread Orion's ancient war, Alcyone and all her sisters bright; I see the Northern Charioteer On fiery wheels along the horizon roll; A thousand orbs at once appear! The Milky Way flows on to either Pole, Each spark of lustrous haze a blazing sphere; I see the radiant worlds, and, ah! their choral song would hear. III. O shining multitude! Effulgent glories of the purer air! What earthly films about us so preclude Communion with you there? Are ye as full of care, Of harsh disquietude, Of grief and Man's despair, As this dark world from whence we make our moan? Where then are those celestial realms? O, where That clime of bliss about the pearly throne, That central Heaven, round which all motions moveâ Region of light and love Ineffable, where dreaming pilgrims see Green fields and golden fruit and water of life! O answer planets! O make answer ye Fixed luminous suns, that shine Down from your placid heights upon our strife! Pellucid ether! through all time surrounding This grosser matter, through all space abounding, Is there no voiceâno sign? IV. Rapt watcher of the skies! No sound of mortal speech, From those bright orbs, shall reach Thine earsâno mystic signal greet thine eyes Of light from Paradise: Yet in their solemn march thou mayest find Serenest utterance, such as prophets heard After the earthquake and the rushing windâ A still, small voice, that loftiest passion stirred Where'er its whisper fell; Even now they tell Of holier ends than this insatiate strife: That each can make his own life, of that life Upholding all things, and which all things bear, A consecrated shrine; That here, and there, and everywhere, In suns, worlds, ether, water, earth and air, God's creatures have their joys and griefs like thine, Nor less the illimitable strong desire Of ceaseless aspirationâ Forever rising from that first creation, Through devious paths, to faÃ«ry prospects higher. V. I shrunk from Death, Dreading the lapse of sense, And lest the Spirit no other life might knowâ So rudely banished hence, With all those inlets closed through which our feelings flow; Thought might flit away with breath; Taste and touch and seeing Gone out, our very Being Might lose itself in gloom; And through that midnight solitude, Like the lone corpse-light o'er a ruined tomb, The soul should hoverâtrembling, wan, and nude. VI. Away! away!âthese fancies that did brood Upon my heart! Now, as I skyward gaze Where all those cressets glow, Fed with the same etherial rays From whence come earthly hues to cheer and light us so, The Shape that was a mystery Fades out. I see an angel where it stood! The doubts, that were a terror, turn and flee. Leaving its kingdom here below, The disembodied Soul new power shall know, And subtler sense, to rule a wider realm; So vast a sway beyond its young ideal At first the Monarch's heart may overwhelm, But soon shall seem that spacious empery real As noontideâwhen we meet Familiar faces, in the hurrying street, And know we live, and know our work aright; Then shall Life broaden on the sight, From some imperial height, More great and calm than now, and wiser and more bright. VII. But here our weepings furrow Their mocking lines in many a gentle face; And pityingly, each night, doth Sleep embrace With tenderest arm the weary babes of sorrow: Yea, even the eyelids of the slave Droop 'neath her kisses, and her shadow falls On prison walls:â Most sweet it seems for aye to slumber deep: âIn Heaven is rest!â they cryâand hail the grave, And clasp their hands and weepâ âRest! Rest! and Lethe for our aching pain: O, let us thither flee! Come, Death, and set us free That we may taste thy peace and never toil again!â VIII. O moaning sons of Earth! Ye know not whence ye came, Nor how divine the flame In which your souls had birth! Soon of Night's grateful draught ye drink your fill, For morning brings the sunlight on the hill; The little birds sing cheerly and anew; The winds praise God; the life-blood courses through Your strengthened frames in many a fervid rill; So at that hour, for whose release ye wait, A thousand sleeps are merged in one great thrill, One night and one awaking: In its swift transit taking Strength, that shall not abate, The Soul renews itself forevermore, And chants a loftier pÃ¦an than before! IX. Ah, yes! that life shall be No floating in perpetual balm, Nor long ignoble calm, Nor swooning ecstacy Such as the raptured Hascheesh-Eater knows; Perfected through each patient, suffering sense, The Soul into God's image grows With joy intense; The lilies of that purer land Not only in celestial meadows blowâ Are close at hand Even here, and by the wayside thronging, For all to gather as they go. These are the thrills of every hallowed longing: The dear delight and blessed guerdon Of Faith, that counts her losses gain; Hope, that triumphs over pain And lifts the heaviest burden; The sweet rewards of each subdued temptation And, O, divinely sweet! the bliss of abnegation. X. Think not that Heâour Fatherâ Will free the after-life of these alloys, That can so fuse our native gold, and mould us To what He would behold us; Rather shall Toil still chasten us, and, rather, New strength to grieve shall come with nobler joys. Only, as we draw more near His face, old doubts shall widen and grow clear; Perception will be truer; we shall know More through those still monitions, And precious intuitions, That from his Spirit flow: Only we shall grow more wise, Nor toil for meaner ends; what glorifies, And waxes brighter till the perfect day, We shall discern, and humbly dare to sever From temporal surroundingsâseeing, ever, How little of our love these can repay, And how they fade and pall, and vanish quite away. XI. Now, though having journeyed lateâ Far from that enchanted groundâ Though man has left his first estate And Eden's wildwood, 'Tis but as children leave their childhood, For larger life and spacious havens bound. Now, toiling on to something great, Launched venturously from those green-swarded shores Upon a rough, tempestuous seaâ Spreading sails and plying oars, In search of finer countries, even, than he Saw round him in his infancyâ What though the storms beat and the ocean roars! Not thus can any tempest wear Our souls or make our hearts despair. Often the helmsmen wonderingly hark To catch the rustle of angelic wings About their bark; Often some bird of Paradise doth light Upon the upper shrouds, and, while he sings, O, swiftly speeds the night, And heavenly breezes swell the yearning sails! Often, in middle watches dark, And lowering gales, Fainting and worn and weary, they may see, Straight forward from their prow, a little time, The clouds roll open lustrously! Then come those glimpses of the life immortal, In glory streaming through the portal, Flush with the splendor of a sunnier clime! XII. But see, how silvery over all the bay Creeps the white outline of a fairer sheen! Long since the last, faint, glimmering light of day Fled from the westward; in the East, serene, Night's stately Queen Sends out the lucent heralds of her sway. Softly the radiant train Absorb those distant lustres in their own; Now through yon trees, that fringe the narrowing main, Her pages pierce and play about beneath; Calm and full-orbed, she mounts her sapphire throne; So let me enter, with my latest breath, Yon clime that glistens through the shadowy gates of Death!</field>
