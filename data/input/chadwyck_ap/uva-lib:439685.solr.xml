      <field name="fulltext">TO THE REV. HOBART CAUNTER, B. D. INCUMBENT MINISTER OF ST. PAUL'S CHAPEL, MARY-LE-BONE, THE FOLLOWING PAGES Are gratefully inscribed, BY HIS OBLIGED FRIEND, THE AUTHOR. PREFACE. TO MY BOOK. Farewell! my fragile, flower-filled book! I fling thee on the stream of Time, With faltering hand and fearful soul,â As in the Orient's sunny clime, The maiden trims her fragrant lamp, A tiny, faint, but Love-fed spark, And trembling gives to doubtful waves, Illumed and wreathed, her fairy bark. My simple flowers! a heaven of Love Was o'er ye when ye budded first, And Love pronounced the blossoms fair, His own fond smiles and tears had nursed. Alas! the garland's light will die Beneath a colder critic's eye! His soft wings fanned ye into bloom; How will ye bear a ruder breath? Ah! wintry-wind and tempest-gloom Will chill your light leaves unto death! Farewell, my bark! yet once again, I would my wish might guide thee still, To clear the pirate-critic's den, Who'd blight thy tender freight at will. The syren, Fame, in vain should sing, Thou'dst shun Distinction's lofty sea, And only pause at friendly ports, Where partial eyes will look for thee. There Love, turned pilot for thy sake, Thy humble helm would proudly take; And anchor thee secure from storm, In some true heart, with welcome, warm. Yet vain the hopeâthe fearâperchance; For many a vessel bold and brave, With richer freight and fairer sail, And prow that proudlier cuts the wave, Is on the stream; and 'mid them all,â The strong, the lofty, swift and free, With current coin for merchandize,â Who Love's light gondola will see? Or, if beheld,âthe critic stern May scorn, for prize of richer cost, The smaller craft;âhow soon wilt thou In cold oblivion's wave be lost! Yet fare thee well!âIt was not Pride, That sheeted home thy fluttering sails, That launched thee on th' o'erburdened tide, And gave thy prow to wayward gales: A wreath of wild flowers all thy freight!â The tide at ebb!âa scanty crew!â The wind against thee!âah! too late, This daring venture I may rue! It was not Pride,âbut what it was, That Pride itself forbids I tell; Fate! with the plaything work thy will, 'Tis thine!âmy simple book, farewell! ELFRIDA. A DRAMATIC POEM, IN FIVE ACTS. DRAMATIS PERSONÃ. Edgar, King of England. Earl Athelwold, favourite of the King. Dunstan, Lord Bishop of London. Guido, a young Italian orphan, left to Edgar's care. Oswald, a courtier. Manbert, a slave. Elfrida, wife to Athelwold. Adelmine, a young orphan of noble birth, cousin to Elfrida. Gillian, a slave, tire-woman to Elfrida. ACT I. SCENE I. An Apartment in Edgar's Palace. Enter Edgar and Oswald. EDGAR. Thou'rt well assured of this? OSWALD. My gracious Liege! It is a common theme among them still, Her matchless wealth of beauty beggars all Our courtly dames can boast,âher queenly form, Her majesty of mien, would grace a throne! I saw her on her bridal-day, my Liege, In all the pomp and splendour of her charms; So regal in her lovelinessâso proud! Her brown and braided hair was lighted up With flashing gems, as is the night with stars; Her cheek at first might seem a thought too pale; Her dark, rich eyes, too wild and strangely sad; But, at a whisper from her young kinswoman, Lo! to that cheek a gleam of rosy fire, Like summer lightning, came, and to her eye A smile, that mocked the diamond on her brow. Her bosom heaved beneath its gorgeous vest Of broidered silk; then with impatient air She bit her lipâher arched and glowing lipâ And straight grew calm again, as still, and pale, And mute as sculptured marble. EDGAR. Now, by the light of heaven! What, ho! without there! (Enter Page.) Summon Earl Athelwold to our presence, boy! [Exit Page. By heaven, and earth, and hell, if this be true, The traitor's life shall answer it! OSWALD. Is it your Grace's will that I retire? EDGAR. Leave me, good Oswald! [Exit Oswald, enter Athelwold, at opposite doors. ATHELWOLD. How fares my loving master? EDGAR. Why, bravely, Athelwold! 'tis long, till now, Since mirth and Edgar met with right good-will: To-day we're boon companions; and to shew Our trusty servant, our most loyal, true And faithful friend, how loftily he stands In loving estimation with his Liege, Thou shalt be one of us;âto-night we'll sup Together at your castle.âHa! dost start? Tremble? turn pale? said I not well, sir Earl? Must sovereigns sue for welcome?âby my sword, The veriest churl in England had not met Our royal favour with less courteous grace. ATHELWOLD. Your pardon, dear my Liege, I did but turn Within my mind how best to meet the honour With such poor welcome as my house affords. EDGAR. Go to!âyou dwell not in a peasant's cot; An English Earl lacks not the wherewithal To greet his Sovereign nobly;âlook you do it. What, sullen still? by heaven, the churl is jealous, And fears his lady-love should meet mine eye! Thou dost forget, most loyal Athelwold, That she is homely, lean, of gait uncouth, Of peasant mien and mind;âsuch were thy words, When to our royal couch we thought to woo The maid;â'twas but the gleaming of her gold, Thou know'st, that won thee, faithful servant mine; Then fear not thou!âthe eye a star must be, The cheek a rose, that lures a look from Edgar. Away! we'll follow with our train anon. Farewell, 'till supper-time, most upright Earl. [Exit Edgar. ATHELWOLD. Now would I give mine earldom but to know Whose friendly deed is this. That I'm betrayed. His searching eye, where latent scorn and rage Lay coiled like some bright serpent ere it spring, Did plainly shew,âalbeit his words were soft, And round his lips played pleasant blandishment. Oh! fair Elfrida! thou hast cost me dear, And were it not that danger's self is sweet When brav'd for thee, I could have curs'd these eyes That saw thee beautiful, and this fond heart That felt thee pure, and therefore worshipped thee! He were a soulless fool, below thy worth, Who could behold thy charms, and not adore. And glorying in thy beauty as I did And do, could I have brooked to know thee, sweet, The sport of his capricious passionâproud, Voluptuous Edgarâwho would turn from thee As the wild zephyr from the queenly rose Itself had rifled, should another flower So pure and blooming win his wanton eye. There's but one way to save her,âI will own Even at her feet, the truth, and bid her hide, As best she may, that dangerous loveliness Beneath uncouth array and awkward mien. Her soul looks down upon her sex's weakness, Light vanity, else should I fear its voice Might triumph in the trial-hour, and drown The holy pleadings of pure love and honour. Now, lady, to the test! [Exit. SCENE II. A Street, near the Palace. Oswald walking to and fro in a reverie. OSWALD. Revenge is sure!â I have so wrought upon his fiery heart He'll never rest till he has found Elfrida; What follows? he will win her to his will, And I shall see those dark, imperial eyes, That flashed their scorn like lightning on mine own, When at her feet I sighed my passion forth,â Gods! I shall see them bent to the earth in shame Beneath my gaze of triumph; and her lipâ Curled with but half-suppressed derision thenâ Shall quiver with remorseful agony, Ere I my vow of vengeance cancel! Lady! Thou'st crushed a serpent that hath still a sting! (Enter Athelwold.) Ah! Athelwold! my noble friend! how fare you? ATHELWOLD. Oswald! well met! Thou'rt just the man I want; I've heard thee lavish of unlovely names Full oft on scoundrels;âhelp me now to pour My just abuse upon the veriest slave, The vilest, meanest, most malignant rascalâ OSWALD. Whom can you mean, my Lord? ATHELWOLD. In sooth, I know not;âsome poor pitiful fellow Who's robbed me of my favour with the King, And dares not shew himself. Knew I his name, I'd brand him first as coward through the realm, Then to the earth his low-born carcass trample! Now I think on't, I caught a glimpse of some one Leaving the presence-chamber as I entered. I did not see his faceâhis form I glanced at; It had a cringing airâThink you 'twas he? OSWALD. In truth, my Lord,â ATHELWOLD. But, Oswald, answer me! Was't not a venomous wretch? OSWALD. My Lord, in truthâ ATHELWOLD. In truth, my Lordâmy Lord, in truthâwhy so I amâin truth, a Lordâmy courteous friend! But what has tam'd thee thus? for God's sake, rave! Be furious! storm! as thou art wont when I See fit to give the reins unto my passion,â Was't not an odious knave? OSWALD. Iâgood my Lordâ ATHELWOLD. Why, Oswald, what's the matter? Art thou in love? has some bewitching dame Thy service slighted, or thy rival crowned With love's own rosy garland? OSWALD (aside.) 'Sdeath! doth he mock me? ATHELWOLD. Yet, gentle Oswald! if you love me, spare This knave of mine one round of rich invective, To comfort me, for I am sick at heart;â Was't not a white-heart craven? OSWALD. Yes! hell and fury! death! damnation!âI ATHELWOLD. Why, this is stirring! this is as it should be! On, on, good Oswald! spare not hell nor fury, Be prodigal of death, and heap damnation On the poor wretch's head! Why! were he thine, Thy foe, thou couldst not curse him with more relish! I thank thee, Oswald! thou hast cool'd my temper! Farewell, my friend; but prithee do not let My going stay thy torrent of abuse Against this caitiff-butt of oursâha! ha! How he would tremble could he hear us rage! He'd never dare to own itâwould he, Oswald? Ha! ha! ha! ha! poor fellow! Fare thee well! [Exit. OSWALD. âSlave!â âcoward!â ârascal!â âpitiful fellow!â âknave!â âPoor white-heart craven!â âsneaking, venomous wretch!â âThis caitiff-butt of ours!ââwell! well! I've borne it, And must, perchance, again; and watch, meanwhile, This wild volcano raging in my breast, Lest one light spark betray me. God of heaven What have I not endured this last half-hour! I could have dashed my torturer to the earth, With right good-will! but each fresh taunt of his, Though traced in burning letters on my brain, Made the appropriation harder still. And have I lived to bear these insults calmly? Ay! 'tis the meed of treachery like mine. I was his confidantâI have betrayed him, And do deserve his scornâbut not the less Will I pursue my purpose to its end. END OF ACT I. ACT II. SCENE I. A Chamber in Athelwold's Castle. Elfrida discovered, in a rich undress, reclining on a couch of carved oak. ELFRIDA. Perchance he thinks to find me ever thus Greeting him from the revel with a smile Of meek endurance! Why, even now he bends In courtly reverence to some mincing dame, Haply the star of Edgar's festival; While I, with this high heart and queenly form, Pine in neglect and solitude;âshall it be? Shall I not rend my fetters, and be free? Ay! be the cooing turtle-dove, content, Safe in her own loved nest!âthe eagle soars On restless plumes to meet the imperial sun! And Edgar is my day-star, in whose light This heart's proud wings shall yet be furled to rest! Why wedded I with Athelwold? for this? To pace, day after day, the same dull round, With some half-dozen maidens for my train? No! even at the altar when I stoodâ My hand in hisâhis gaze upon my cheekâ I did forget his presence, and the scene! A gorgeous vision rose before mine eyes, Of power, and pomp, and regal pageantry; A king was at my feet, and as he knelt I smiled; and turning, metâa husband's kiss! But still I smiled, for in my guilty soul I blessed him as the being by whose means I should be brought within my idol's sphereâ My haughty, glorious, brave, impassioned Edgar! Well I remember when these wondering eyes Beheld him firstâI was a maiden thenâ A dreaming childâbut from that thrilling hour I've been a queen in visions! Yet he passed With his proud train, unheedingâha! that step! What if my loving lord were listener now! He comes!âoh! noble Edgar! Enter Athelwold. ELFRIDA. My Lord! my love! Thou'rt here in haste; hath aught Of evil chanced thee? ATHELWOLD. Dost thou love me, wife? ELFRIDA. With a love so deep, Thou canst not fathom it. ATHELWOLD. Speak it once more, mine own! ELFRIDA. Who doubts Elfrida? am I not thy wifeâ Thy true and loving wifeâwho never yet In thought, or word, or deed, dishonoured thee? Nay, Athelwold! thou dost me grievous wrong, Thou dost, indeed. I to be doubted thus! Go to!âit vexes me! ATHELWOLD. Nay! dry those tears! I meant not thus to wound! I will not doubtâ Thy pardon, love! And nowâ ELFRIDA. And nowâsince I have pardoned theeâthou'lt grantâ I know thou wiltâone trifling boon. ATHELWOLD. Name it;âbut quick, Elfrida! ELFRIDA. Take me to court, my gracious husband! ATHELWOLD (aside.) Ha! Wend her light fancies thither?âthen farewell To Athelwold's fond dream of peace!âbut no! She will not yield so lightly to temptation. (Aloud.) Beseech thee, sweet, forget these idle dreams! I've that to speak, of import deep and grave, Will ask thy calmest mood, thy gentlest thoughts. By all my trust, my passion, and my truth; By thine own purity; thy stainless nameâ Dearer to me than is the light of heaven,â I do conjure thee listen tenderlyâ With your heart listen, for your husband speaks. The Kingâ ELFRIDA. What of the King?â(Aside.) My heart indeed will listen! ATHELWOLD. So eager, lady? ELFRIDA. Nay! I did but askâ ATHELWOLD. It matters not!âthou know'st that some months back, In Devon's bowers, I sought the famed Elfrida; I cameâ ELFRIDA. With Edgar's gracious leave to wed. ATHELWOLD. No, love! with Edgar's gracious leave to look On her whom but to look upon was bliss! Not for myself I gazed, but for the King, Yet lost myself in gazing, and forgot My trust, my fealty, honour, Edgarâallâ Ay, all save thee Oh! pardon, that I proved A traitor to thy beauty! I returned, With coward falsehood sullying my lip, Till then a stranger there.âNay! chide me not, It was for thy dear sake, my fairest love. I bade him blot thee from his memory, As one unworthy of his kingly thoughts; Ungraced of nature's gifts, unlovely, rude. The credulous King believed, and for a time The theme was dropped; but in my miser soul Thy image lived unaltered, and again I sought his presence, with a perjured tongue. I said, Elfrida's wealth had magic in't, To make her beauteous in mine humble eyes; Then won I from his royal lips a boon That makes me more a monarch than himself, Lord of thy love and beauty. ELFRIDA. Falseâforsworn! ATHELWOLD. How now! ELFRIDA. 'Twas jest, my gentle Lord. ATHELWOLD. A most untimely one;âbut hear me still. To-night the King comes hither with his trainâ Look not so wild, he shall not harm thee, love! I'll dim my jewel, lest he covet it; Thou shalt disguise thy beauty in some garb Of coarse material and fashion rude, That least becomes thee; put some rough restraint Upon thy gentle stateliness and grace; Shrink from his gaze, as if in shame-faced fear. Alas! can aught obscure the fire of soul That flashes from thine eyes? beseech thee weep Until thou dim its glory.âOh! Elfrida, Would thou wert not so beautiful!âbut hasteâ Thou'lt do it, sweet? ELFRIDA. And dost thou doubt me still? ATHELWOLD. Thou art but woman. ELFRIDA. Yet a loving one. I'll straightway don such weeds as even thou Wilt own would mar a fairer face than mine. ATHELWOLD. Earth hath no fairerâHeaven no lovelier knows. Adieu! We meet at supper-time,âtill thenâ Remember wifeâhonour and Athelwold! [Exit Athelwold. ELFRIDA. Love, glory, and the King! by all the gods, A noble chance! and I will husband it As doth become my breeding and my birth. What, ho! sir Page! (Enter Page.) Bid Gillian hither! As doth become my breeding.âI remember, When but a thoughtless child, my sire did part The wild curls from my brow, and call me queenâ His fairy queen; and when I gaily tossed My ringlets back, and bounding on his knee, Cried, with a look of mimic majesty, This is my throne!âbut who my subjects be! He bade me keep that proud and glowing smile, (Enter Gillian.) And it should lure a sovereign to my feet. And shall it not? by Edgar's self it shall! (To Gillian.) Why art thou here? GILLIAN. Your page did bid me, lady. ELFRIDA. I had forgot,âbring forth my richest robes, My costliest ornaments,âbe speedy, girl! [Exit Gillian. (After a pause.) In lowly weeds, forsooth! the weeds I wear Shall blind his recreant vision with their splendor, Dazzle the King, and light me to the throne! (Re-enter Gillian, who stands waiting behind her with dresses.) I robed in mean array! I stoop and tremble! I'll bear me like an Empress, tho' he die For his fond treachery! Caitiff! but for him My bridal-bed had been a royal one! And shall be yet. (To Gillian.) So, Gillian, lay them there, And tell me, girl, which in thy mind becomes My features best. GILLIAN. Here is a rose-hued mantle wrought with pearls, 'Twill match full well my lady's glowing cheek. ELFRIDA. Nay, 'tis too bright,â The rose upon my cheek is dim to-day, And this will make it show more faintly still. What next? GILLIAN. An amber velvet, madam, Adown its vest the sunny topaz gleams, 'Mid wreaths of flowers in golden broidery. How fittingly its gorgeous folds would sweep Around that stately form. ELFRIDA. Out on the topazâ'tis a beggar-stone! A vassal's wife may wear itâand shall I? I'll have the white robe, girl, the silken one, Resplendent with the diamond's regal ray; The diamond suits the queen, and is alone Of all earth's jewel star-drops worth the wearing. Bid them prepare the bath with perfume rare, Then, with all haste unto my chamber, Gillian: And look you, my tiar of gems and gold, My silver mirror, and my jewelled zoneâ I'll be a star to-night, and win all eyes Unto my wondrous splendourâoh! this heart! [Exit Elfrida. GILLIAN. âThe diamond suits the queen!â my lady mistress, That haughty head of thine is turned I'm sure. [Exit Gillian. SCENE II. A Grove, near the Castle. Enter Elfrida and Adelmine. ELFRIDA. Ha! ha! ha! Thou wouldst have laughed as I do to have heard him; He bade me clip my glossy braids of hair, Stoop in my gait, put on my lowliest garb, My coldest look,âdo all I could to mar What he was pleased to call my loveliness. ADELMINE. And will you not, dear lady? ELFRIDA. Will I not? Nay, most obedient Adelmine, would you? ADELMINE. Oh! ask me not, Elfrida; did mine eyes Wear the soft glory of an angel's smile, I'd shut them with a still and stern resolve, Nor lift their lashes at a King's command; Waved my rich tresses with the golden gleam That lighted Eve's in paradiseâI'd mar Their soft luxuriance with unfaltering hand; I'd spare as soon the serpent that would sting me, Because its coils with changing splendour shone, As let a ringlet's sunny lustre lure My heart from rectitude, my love to shame; Rivalled my roseate cheek the glowing dawn, I'd find some dye would change it, till its hue Were swart as Ethiop girl's; and should my smile Awake some sportive dimple from its sleep, To make that shadow lovelyâlike a star Twinkling on night's dark cheekâI'd wear a look Solemn as eastern sage; if peace and love Reposed upon my pure mouth's glowing arch, I'd bid repelling scorn usurp the throne; A sculptor's model were my glorious form For grace and queenly bearing as I moved, I'd stoop, I'd limp, to spoil its loveliness,â Nay, I would lame my limbs, deform my shape, And glory in the sacrifice, if so My husband were unperilled. ELFRIDA. And what would prompt thee to this strange romance? ADELMINE. Love, holy love, Elfrida! ELFRIDA. What if love were not? ADELMINE. Do you not love your husband, gentle lady? ELFRIDA. Nay, that I spoke not of;âbut is there aught Save love would tempt thee to so dear a loss? ADELMINE. Ay, madam!âif affection's voice were mute, Honor and woman's prideâthey too have tongues, Whose word is law with those who love themselves. ELFRIDA. Now, prithee, peace! ADELMINE. Oh! lady, say not so! I will not pauseâI'll bid thee think of all The shame, the ruin, it may guard thee from. Thou know'st the King's impassioned love of beautyâ His lawless violenceâhis tyrant will;â He'll wreak his wrath upon your noble husband, The gentle, generous Athelwold,âwhose peace, Honourânay, life perchance, are in thy keeping. Elfrida! will you risk them all to please A stranger's eyeâto win the wanton gaze Of reckless Edgar, whose least look, methinks. Were insult to your loveliness? ELFRIDA. Fond girl! Thou may'st well prate that hast no charms to hide. (Aside.) Now would I that were not a barefaced lie, For well I dread she'll rival me to-night; So young, so innocent, so beautiful! But no! I have itâ'tis a simple task To work her grateful spirit to my purpose. (Aloud.) Hear me, sweet Adelmine! I did but jest; But wilt thou too a simple guise assume? Some rustic garb?âIt were not well, methinks;â 'Twould seem too like a plotâattract too much The curious and enquiring gaze, if thou Wert robed in rich array, with gems and gold, And I, the lady of the castleâI, A noble's wife, more meanly, poorly clad. If both are thus, 'twill win less observation, And seem our common custom,âwilt thou so? ADELMINE. Yes, dear Elfrida, robe me as thou wilt; I would do more to save the noble Earl From danger; he was kind to me, thou know'st, When I was lone and sad;âbut how wilt thou Make thyself aught but beautiful, Elfrida? ELFRIDA (smiling.) I can but try. ADELMINE. And wilt thou do his bidding with thy hair? ELFRIDA. What! rashly rob myself of woman's prideâ Her dearest ornament?âthat auburn hair Which Athelwold a thousand times has praised? ADELMINE. Ay! fling the worthless tresses to the wind! He'll bless thee for it; and believe me, lady, The graceful deed will but adorn thee more In his adoring eyes;âwhy! with this hand I'll sever mine, if thou wilt, dearest cousin! ELFRIDA. Thine! what are thine? coarse stragglers! ADELMINE. Are they so? Then would I they were lovely as the light,â Each hair of them a thread of purest gold! If seeming thus a dearer sacrifice, It might ennoble in thine eyes my loss, And win thee to thy duty! ELFRIDA. Duty, girl? ADELMINE. Ay! duty, noble lady! ELFRIDA. Thou art bold, And dost forget, moreover, simple maid, As he forgot, that slaves alone do go With shaven head. How then may I appear Without my wealth of hair? It does not need; I'll fold it simply 'neath some awkward gear,â See thou do so. And now, my dearest coz, Hie to thy chamber. Keep thy kind resolve, And meet me in the banquet-room. I'll send A fitting dress to thee. ADELMINE. Good-bye, then, dear Elfrida;â How I shall love thee in thy homely garb! [Exit. ELFRIDA. She's gone! poor child! Poor, fond, confiding child! She'll prove a foil, Garbed like a rustic, in her rude attire, To proud Elfrida's majesty! Heigh ho! I would this royal banquet were well over! My heart, that should beat high with hope, is cold, And still, and dark, and passionless!âheigh ho! With hopeâwhat hope? a most unholy! Ay, Strive as I may to hide its shadowy form, Into the hateful light it will steal forth; For conscience is a mirror true and clear As heaven itself, and in it lives a spell, Divine, perchance, by whose resistless power All thoughts, deeds, wishes, passions, good or ill, Are won to view themselves reflected fairly;â Even so the voice of music doth beguile And awe the gliding serpent with its charm. Yes! hide it as I may, that guilty hope Doth stand before that magic mirror now, All undisguised in native hideousness! It looks a demon thereâso dark, so wild, So merciless! Its smile is fierce, yet cold; (Enter Gillian.) Its brow hath blood upon it!âha! GILLIAN (aside.) âIts brow hath blood upon it!ââshe is mad! (Aloud.) My lady! here's the chain. ELFRIDA. The chain that is to link me to my fate! Give it me, girl, and leave me. [Exit Gillian. 'Twas his first gift!âI do remember well How tenderly he clasped it round my throat, And bade me when I wore it, think of him! To-night I'll wear it. 'Tis a gorgeous toy,â Will it not choke me? let it. Athelwold!â What, tears? Elfrida weepingâand for him! Has he not wronged Elfrida? played her false? Dethroned her?âfor in Edgar's heart I dwelt A crowned queen, until his perjured tongue Did so belie me I was banished thence. Why! 'twas undoubted treason!âhe did owe As true allegiance to me there, as if On England's throne I sat; and shall I weep, I that was born to be his Sovereign?âno! [Exit. SCENE III. A large Banquetting Hall in Athelwold's Castle. Supper-table seen in the distance, at the upper end. Slaves bearing dishes on their heads. In front, King EdgarâAthelwoldâOswaldâ Guido, and other NoblesâAttendants, &amp;c. EDGAR (to Athelwold.) Methinks, my Lord, this dainty dame of thine Doth slight our noble presence. Doth she look To see us in her chamber, good my Lord? Waits she the royal hand to lead her forth? Beware, sir Earl! If thou artâHa! she comes! By heaven, a noble creature! Enter Elfrida, dressed with great splendour, attended by her maidens; and at the opposite door, Adelmine, in a peasant's dress. ATHELWOLD. Woman! ADELMINE. Elfrida! ELFRIDA (Crossing the stage, kneels at the King's feet.) My gracious Sovereign! EDGAR (raising her.) Rise, most noble lady! Here is thy station, at thy Sovereign's side, Let traitors kneel to him! And now permit That we remove this most disloyal veil, Which like a careful subject whom we wot of, Would hide thy dangerous beauty from our eyes. (Puts back her veil.) What! Athelwold! we prithee where's thy wife?â Thy thin, pale, homely, haggard, awkward wife? This is some captive queen, whom thou hast stolen, And we should claim her as our kingly right;â Nay, by the mass, we'll seal our title too. (Kisses her.) ATHELWOLD (aside.) Death! will she suffer it? EDGAR. Thou hast a regal eye for beauty, sir;â But, gentle Earl, we prithee where's thy wife? ATHELWOLD. I have no wife! My sometime wife is deadâ Dead to her Lord! I had a wife, my Liege,â A generous, lovely wifeâa leal, and pure; I did belie her when I called her else! She never looked unlovely until now,â Yet now she doth but keep her faith with me, For she did promise, with an angel-smile, She'd so transform herself, that she should seem Deform'd in these fond eyesâshe's kept her faith! EDGAR. What! kept her faith! if she did promise this, In very sooth those beauteous lips are perjured, For look! the diamond-glory of her eyes! Those silken braids! that pure and cloudless brow! The changing beauty of her dimpled cheek! The graceful curving of her swan-white throat! Each airy motionâevery glance and smileâ Are all resistless witnesses against her, And prove her still an angel! Thou art blind! By the blest rood, if she had kept her faith, We would have cursed her sacrilegious hand, That dared profane so heavenly fair a templeâ The shrine of beauty and of loveâat which Our kneeâeven oursâshall not disdain to bend, Albeit unused in yielding. Athelwold! Thou art a double traitor!âthou hast robbed Thy liege Lord of this smiling paradise, And hast defamed her loveliness, that thou Might'st revel safely in her Eden-bloom. ATHELWOLD (rushing forward, and throwing himself at the King's feet.) King! strike thy sword into this breaking heart, 'Twill find one victim there will woo the wound! EDGAR. And what is that?âRemorse? ATHELWOLD. Despair! EDGAR. No more of this! The banquet waits our presenceâon, my Lords! Thy hand, sweet lady of our revels!âsoâ (The King passes up the Hall, with Elfrida, followed by Nobles, Attendants, &amp;c.âto the rude Music of various warlike instruments, heard from without. As they seat themselves at the table, the Music ceases.) SCENE IV. Another Room in the same. Enter Manbert, with a Minstrel. MANBERT. Tarry thou here, good Minstrel. Fear not thou But I will make thee sharer in the feast. Music is ever welcome to my Lord. I think, 'Tis that his heart is never out of tune! My lady's is a trifle higher toned, And some rude hand, or I am much deceived, Hath strained a string too sharply, till it cracked. Of this I'm sure,âit does not chord with his!â But stay thou here; I'll be with thee anon. [Exit. Enter Gillian, without perceiving the Minstrel; crosses the stage with affected dignity, in imitation of Elfrida. GILLIAN. âAnd it shall lure a sovereign to my feet!â MINSTREL (following her.) A wandering bard, so please you. GILLIAN (still not seeing him.) âCaitiff! but for him My bridal-bed had been a royal one!â MINSTREL. Wilt list the gleeman's lay? GILLIAN. âOut on the topazâ'tis a beggar-stone, The diamond fits the queen!â MINSTREL. No jewels I,âbut I have many a song To charm thine ear withal. GILLIAN. âDazzle the King, and light me to the throne!â MINSTREL (starting back.) Nay! that is rather too much To ask of a poor minstrel! but my harpâ GILLIAN (turns and sees him.) âIts brow hath blood upon itââ Ha! MINSTREL (in alarm.) Blood! Where? GILLIAN. And who art thou? MINSTREL. Why! I've been telling you the last half hour. I am a wandering bard, most mighty madam. GILLIAN. Madam! I'm not a madam. MINSTREL. My gracious queen that is to be. GILLIAN. How dar'st thou queen me thus? MINSTREL. I queen'd thee notâit was thyself that queen'd thee GILLIAN. Thou'rt mad, poor minstrel! All the world I think Is mad to-night.âMy mistress is, I'm sure. (Re-enter Manbert.) MANBERT. And so's my master! He says he's not i' the mood for melody. GILLIAN. But, gentle bard, whence come you? MINSTREL. From Scotland, from the generous Kenneth's court. GILLIAN. Kenneth of Scotland! ay! a noble King! They say, when, with the other dozen of them, He helped to row our Monarch up the Dee, He looked a very tempest, and his brow Wore haughtier sovereignty even then than Edgar's MINSTREL. He help to row your Monarch up the Dee! A goodly tale, forsooth.âI tell thee, girl, He would have perished first. Had he been there, Your Edgar knew too well his kingly heart To bid him do it. MANBERT. Hush! Know'st thou not our King doth vaunt his triumph! And should he hearâ MINSTREL. His triumph! 'twas a mean one at the best, And never harp of mine its praise should ring. Enter a Servant. SERVANT. The King Desires the minstrel's presence at the banquet. This way, good harper! (Exeunt Harper and Servant.) MANBERT. Gillian, my lord is strangely stern to-night. GILLIAN. Manbert, my lady's stranger than my lord. MANBERT. I like it not. GILLIAN. Nor Iâgood faith! I'm weary of her whims. Why, at her toilet, ere the King arrived, Nothing would suit herânot a plait could I Fold to her likingânot a jewelled clasp Was where it should beânot a tress would fall As she would have itâeven the pure white robe With silver flowers in-wrought and star-like diamonds, In which she looked majestic as a swan, And blooming as a rose,âwas tawdry;âmean, Of shape uncouth.âI had no patience with her. MANBERT. Nor I with thee;âthy thoughts, that used to seem Lowly and gentle as a cooing dove, Have caught, I know not how, a peacock's dress, And strutâ GILLIAN. In borrowed plumage? say'st thou so? (The sound of a harp is heard.) But hark! the harp! I must e'en take a peep. (She goes to a door leading to the banquet-room, opens it slightly.) They pass the harp round, as their custom is. Elfrida has itâhist! (Elfrida's voice is heard from the banquet-room, singing the following.) As the lone eagle In his haughty ire, With beating wing And burning eye of fire, Still sunward lifts His free undazzled gaze, And pants to revel In that boundless blaze,â The winged ambition Struggling in my soul Turns its wild eye To one resplendent goal, Scorning its prison bars, Though gold they be, And murmuring ever I will yet be free! GILLIAN. And now she yields it, with a winning smile, Unto the King. (The King's voice.) No wonder that cheek, in its tinting transcendant, Excelleth the beauty of others by far; No wonder that eye is so richly resplendent, For your heart is a Rose, and your soul is a Star! Then give back to Heaven the light it bestows, Till the Star smile again in its birth-place above; But oh! let me share the soft bloom of the Rose, Yield, yield the warm heart to my cherishing love! MANBERT. Our gracious King is ever mixing up His love and his religion in one draught. GILLIAN. That noble dark-eyed youth, who came they say From the rich southern land, and whom they call Guido, has ta'en it now; and lo! he bends Courteously to the Lady Adelmine! Who lovelier looks in that strange lowly garb Than a pure rosebud in its veil of moss; Fairer than even she e'er looked before, And fairer far than any of the rest.â But listen, Manbert. (Guido's voice.) Love flew from Heaven one fatal day, To find a wild flower rare and sweet; Alas! how soon entranced he lay A smiling prisoner at thy feet! While thou and he, in guileless play, Beguiled the moments fleet. Yet pityâpity, maiden bright, The archer-boy, no longer free; For Time has stolen his wings of light, And flying, leaves poor Love with thee. Ah! doubly swift is now his flight, While Love remains with thee! GILLIAN. Love! love! its nothing but loveâvulgar fellows! I will not hear another syllable. (Runs offâManbert follows her.) END OF ACT II. ACT III. SCENE I. Elfrida and Edgar. ELFRIDA. Gentle my Liegeâspeak on. EDGAR. Earth hath no language, love, befitting thee; For its own children it hath pliant speech. And mortals know to call a blossom fair, A wavelet graceful, and a jewel rich: But thouâoh! teach me, sweet, the angel-tongue They talked in Heaven, ere thou didst leave its bowers To bloom below. Come, fair one! answer me! How named they thee in thy celestial home? ELFRIDA. If Athelwold should hear thee! EDGAR. Name not the felon knave to me, Elfrida; My soul is flame whene'er I think of him. Thou lov'st him notâoh! say thou dost not love him! ELFRIDA. When but a child, I saw thee in my dreams! EDGAR. Heaven bless thee, beautiful! Thou wilt be mine? Thou'lt to the palace with me? ELFRIDA. King! ere dishonour stain Earl Ordgar's child, This hand should change her glowing life to nought. Look on me, look! Is this a brow whereon The trembler, Shame, should sit? Is this a form Should droop and shrink before the glance of Scorn? Know me, my Lord! EDGAR. Thou wouldst ennoble Shame! and Scorn would change To suppliant Love before thee! How may we feed our passion, if not thus? ELFRIDA. Are there no means? Is Edgar's sceptre broken? Must monarchs tamely smile while they are robbed Of what they've set their hearts on? Be it so! Within yon wood is many a secret cave, Might more than match in gloom the darkest deed. Dost lack a dagger? EDGAR. I lack the courage, lady, To do a coward act! ELFRIDA. âA coward act!â How if some vagrant wasp Thy hand should stingâWouldst let it play there still? What more to theeâthe master of the realmâ Is this light lord? Go to! he's but a mote, Which with a word thou canst annihilate! And thou dost pause! Speak not of love to me! [Exit. EDGAR. An angel temper! Some summer's day I too may seem a mote Between her and the sun of her ambition; And thenâno dagger will my lady lack To clear her pathway! SCENE II. Grounds belonging to Athelwold's Castle. Enter AdelmineâGuido following. GUIDO. Stay, spirit! ADELMINE. I dare not stay. GUIDO. And why? ADELMINE. I know not why I dare notâthis I knowâ Mine eyes do fill with tears, my heart doth beat To very pain, when I do look on thee, Or hear thee speak. GUIDO. âTears!â âPain!ââThou dost not hate me? ADELMINE. I cannot tellâI do not think I hate thee. GUIDO. Dost love me then? ADELMINE. I cannot tell, and would not if I could. GUIDO. Who taught thee that cold âwould not?â ADELMINE. A low, soft voice within; even now I hear Its fairy murmur in my trembling soul, It whispers still âBeware!â GUIDO. Oh! not of me! ADELMINE. No! but of owning unrequited love. GUIDO. Wert ever wooed ere now? ADELMINE. Then thou dost woo me! GUIDO. Ay! and will, fair child! till thou art won! ADELMINE. Dost note this simple garb? GUIDO. Yes! loveliest! ADELMINE. It is a peasant's. GUIDO. Well! ADELMINE. Wouldst wed a peasant? GUIDO. I would wed thee wert thou a beggar, sweet. ADELMINE. And when? GUIDO. Now, now! so thou wilt love me! ADELMINE. Now do I bless thee, false and lost Elfrida. This lowly guise, which thy beguiling voice Did lure me to assume, has proved in sooth An elfin charm, to test a generous heart. GUIDO. What meanst thou, maiden? ADELMINE. See! (She throws off her coif, and releases her long hair, which is adorned with gems.) I am a noble's child! GUIDO (starting back.) Oh! would thou wert not so! ADELMINE. And why? GUIDO. No noble I. ADELMINE. And art thou not? then doth thy brow belie thee. Thou art! I read it in thy proud dark eyes, Whose glance is truth and love, and in those lips, Whose smile is but a ray of the soul's sunshine; In thy high bearing, in thy movements, words, Thou art of heaven's nobilityâas far Excelling earth's as doth yon winged star, Robed in its garment of celestial glory, Outshine the earth-bound glow-worm. GUIDO. Alas! sweet maiden! I am viewed by thee Thro' the pure light of thine own innocent spirit, Illumining all that comes within its sphere. As rugged hills, seen through an atmosphere Sunny and soft, seem robed in heavenly hues And radiance not their own. Yet shine thou still In thy young virgin loveliness upon me, And I will realise thy loftiest dream. ADELMINE. I know thou wilt; and now farewell, my friend! Elfrida waits my coming. Poor Elfrida! Her maiden, Gillian, tells me she is crased, And raves of crowns and thrones, and vaunts how she, If she were England's queen, would rule the world GUIDO. Alas! she cannot even rule herself; Her passions are too fierce for majesty. 'Tis strange, dear Adelmine, whene'er I dream, As oft I do, of England's future glory, The self-same lovely apparition rises, Sceptred and crowned. I will describe it, sweet, As I have seen it in my midnight visions. Fancy the sun of England in its zenith, And on its throne a youthful fair-haired creature, Round whom in reverence throng th' adoring train Of noble, lovely, wise, and great, and good,â Like Dian, throned in light and circled by The starry powers,âDian, ere yet she pressed In youthful joy Endymion's dimpled cheek, And left a rosy lustre floating there From that soft kiss which, gleaming thro' the night, Reach'd with its tremulous ray th' Olympian height And treacherously betrayed her to the gods. Canst thou not fancy her, my Adelmine! When veiled in mist, and smiling thro' her veil,â Glowing with maiden loveliness and love! Her golden tresses rippling o'er her feet,â She trod with steps of light the Latmian mount, And softly stealingâ ADELMINE. But the queen, my friend! GUIDO. Ah! fairest! fear me not! no word of mine Shall bid the rose of modesty unfold To lend thy cheek its blushesâYes! the queenâ A maiden queenâgentle and yet high-souled In the first glow of lovely womanhoodâ Pure as the snow-drop in the early dew With morning's flush upon itâfirm and proud In her own high resolves, yet still relying With modest trust on those she knows more wiseâ True to herself and heaven, and true to all Whose destinies are hersâin heart and deed, And when the cares of empire are thrown by, Artless, and timid, and confiding as The nestling dove within its woodland home, And playful too and loving as a child; Owning in every subject-heart a throne, Where she is crowned and knelt to by affection. Is't not a woman worthy of the realm? ADELMINE. Ah, yes! but I had rather thou wouldst dream Of me in future. I must leave thee now. I go to con this new sweet lesson o'er, Which thou and Love have taught me. Fare thee well! GUIDO. Farewell mine own! And be not jealous, sweet, I'll warrant thee thine image warmed my heart, When I did draw that glowing picture from it. [Exeunt at different doors. SCENE III. Elfrida's Chamber. ElfridaâManbert holding a dagger and a purse. ELFRIDA. Thou'lt do the deed, good Manbert? MANBERT. I'll do the deed. ELFRIDA. Thou'lt not betray me? MANBERT. No. ELFRIDA. Thou'rt chary of thy wordsâperchance thou deem'st Me chary of my goldâis't not enough? MANBERT. Ay! ELFRIDA. I shall go mad! I pray you say somewhat,â Is't not a loyal deed to stab a traitor? MANBERT. Ay, madam! ELFRIDA. And Athelwold's a traitor. MANBERT. So thou say'st. ELFRIDA. Knave! caitiff! slave! and is he not, I say? MANBERT. What, is he notââknave?âcaitiff?âslave?â good lady? ELFRIDA. Now had I but that dagger in this hand!â I pray you, pardon me! I'm not myself. But do it, friend, and look for farther meed, Not from your mistress onlyâbut your King. (Aside.) Edgar will thank me when the deed is o'er. (Aloud.) Farewell, good Manbert,âcome when it is done. (Turning aside.) I've locked his conscience with a golden key, Would mine were closed as lightly! (To Manbert.) Why star'st thou with those glaring eyes upon me. MANBERT. Methought I saw a fiend! ELFRIDA. A fiend! Heaven shield us! where! MANBERT (still looking at Elfrida.) Yonder! ELFRIDA. Still is thy gaze on me! MANBERT. Nay, pardon me, 'twas on the fiend I gazed. ELFRIDA. Go to! I'll leave thee with this scare-crow shade. [Exit Elfrida. MANBERT. It will not stay, it likes thy company best. (Looks at the purse.) And this then is my bribe for butchery! Faith! this same lady-murderess must prize A human soul but lightly, since she thinks To buy it at so cheap a rate as this. A bag of paltry gold!âperchance she deems A slave's soul is of meaner stamp and worth. Almighty power! do not all spirits bear Thine image pure and cloudless from their birth! And who shall dare decide that thou hast traced Its beauty less divinely for the slave Than for his lord, or that the impress is Less perfect in the one than in the other? (He holds up the dagger.) And this too is the instrument, which was To reach as noble and as kind a heart As ever beat for an ungrateful woman. Within yon moat They shall both lie, until that day of doom Yon subtle priest, the haughty Dunstan tells of; Then shall they stand as witnesses against her. For me, I'll not betray her; I am too thankful that she chose my hand To do the deedâsince thus I may prevent it. No, no,âI'll not betray her;âbut I'll warn My master that some danger threatens him. [Exit. SCENE IV. A Room in the Castle. Enter Edgar and Oswald. EDGAR. Ay! ay! She'd bear her bravely as fair England's queen. There's not another woman in the realm Would so become a throne as this Elfrida. Curse on the scheming Lord who robbed me of her, I'll have his head for't! But didst thou mark the peasant-maiden, Oswald, Some rustic in attendance on the lady, Yet so ennobled she her simple garb, With her pure delicate loveliness, her grace, Her sweet and silent gravity of mien, Her timid looksâher shrinking modesty; I could have sworn she was not what she seemed. Didst mark the maid? OSWALD. I did, my Liege,âyet, nothing did I mark Worthy a second glance from kingly eyes. EDGAR. Then call mine eyes unkingly, for so much They saw to ravish them, they sent not two, But twenty glances o'er that drooping form; Until her cheek, which was a rose beforeâ A faint-hued roseâbecame a crimson one; And her dark violet eyes did fall abashed Beneath my ardent gaze.âShe is a prize Which I will win, or perish.âOswald! look! Is not that she beyond?âby heaven it is! She comes this way.âOswald,âfarewell, good Oswald. OSWALD (aside, going.) Lies the hunt there? Curse on the fool! he'll pass The queenly deer that in his pathway glides, And wooes the threatened woundâthat he may lure This wild and timid fawn from out her covert. [Exit. Enter Adelmine. ADELMINE (starting back.) Pardon, my Liege! I knew not you were here. EDGAR (seizing her hand.) And hadst thou known, Wouldst thou have left me to my own dull thoughts? ADELMINE. I do beseech your Grace, let go my hand! EDGAR. Why! so I will, sweet child! to clasp thy waist. What! struggling, girl? and know'st thou who I am? ADELMINE. I thought, at first, you were the King of England. EDGAR. At first? and why not still? ADELMINE. They told me he was manly, courteous, brave. EDGAR. And since I am not eitherâI am not The King of England! is it so? wellâwell! I'll let thee go.âThou art a graceful pleader, And arguest prettily.âI'll let thee goâ In time, I mean;âwe'll have a ransom first,â A ransom worthy of our lovely prize. (Tries to kiss her.) ADELMINE (struggling.) Oh! Guido! where art thou! Enter Guidoâshe runs to him. GUIDO (bearing her off the stage.) Were he ten times thy King, he should not harm thee. [Exeunt Adelmine and Guido. EDGAR. Thou diest for this! [Exit. END OF ACT III. ACT IV. SCENE I. Another Room in the same. Athelwold alone. ATHELWOLD. And for this woman, I have stained for ever My noble name! For this light, feeble thing, Who has not even soul enough to feel The sacrifice I made for her,âthe loss Of all that should be dearest unto manâ Perjured myself for herâbroke my pledged faith, To Edgar doubly due, as King and friend! I have deserved the wound, but not from herâ Not from that hand so linked in love to mine!â Or did I dream she loved me! Heaven and earth! Have I been wasting heart, and soul, and life, On a cold, reckless wanton? Oh, Elfrida! Thy glorious beauty was the gift of heaven,â As such thou shouldst have priz'd it, and have died Ere thou didst yield it up to mortal touch, Unless thy heart went with it, to make pure And sanctify the offering. Oh, my wife!â The idol I have set apart to worshipâ Watch'd overâcherish'dâmus'd upon in absence, Until my full heart ached with tenderness!â Why! what a doting idiot have I been! Enter Manbert. MANBERT (aside.) True! (Coming forward.) My Lord! danger's at hand! ATHELWOLD. Danger for whom? MANBERT. Thyself! ATHELWOLD. Of what? MANBERT. Of death! ATHELWOLD. Well? MANBERT. Thou must fly! ATHELWOLD (bitterly.) And wherefore must? Good Manbert! go thou to the desert wild, And shew the panting wretch, whose very heart Is parched with thirst, a fountain at his feet! Then bid him fly, and taste it not! Or take Unto the tortured victim of the rack A bed of down, and offer him his choice! Manbert! to me is death a bed of down,â A fountain, in whose draught oblivion dwellsâ Oblivion of all sorrow! MANBERT (aside.) Now, by the mass! I will betray the woman! ATHELWOLD. But I wrong Thy kindly nature thus to trifle with thee;â From whom didst learn this danger? MANBERT. Hear!âMy ladyâ ATHELWOLD (aside.) Ay! poor Elfrida! she would warn me then! She doth repent her follyâthoughtless child! She dreams not of her own far greater peril. No! I will not desert her in her hour Of trial and temptation!âshe has lost My loveâmy trustâbut never shall she lose My best protection while I live to give it! (Aloud.) What said thy lady, Manbert? MANBERT (with emphasis.) She placed a dagger in my hand, my Lord! ATHELWOLD. Fond, fearful thing! I've daggers of my own. But am I then to be th' assassin's aim? I would not die that death! And she did send A weapon of defence?âShe loves me still! MANBERT. She gave me with the dagger, sir, a purse! ATHELWOLD. Lest I lack means to fly! I would not leave her In Edgar's power, while life is in this arm, Though all the dogs of hell were on the scent, To lap my heart's blood! MANBERT. Oh, my noble master! 'Tis she would have your heart's blood! ATHELWOLD. 'Sdeath! fellow! dost thou rave? MANBERT. Scarce an hour sinceâ With hollow voice, disordered dress, and eyes Where flashed a demon lightâshe bade me take A bribe to stab the traitor Athelwold! And look for farther meed, not from herself Alone, butâ ATHELWOLD. Edgar? ha!âmy royal foe! Now is existence dear again!ânow hath This low-souled Sovereign matched me my dishonour! Is he not King? had he not power to take This poor life in the open face of day? By heaven, thou'st lightened me of such a load Of gratitude to him, whom I did wrong, And pity for this woman.âTake her, King! Love her as I have lov'd, and she will prove A curse to thee and thine! My sword, good Manbert!â I must go armed. To-morrow, while the chase Is hot, I'll quit the eager train unseen, And fly to Scotland. Kenneth is my friendâ The noble Kenneth! Peace may yet be mine. I will forget that e'er I had a home In England's heart, or hers. Thou, Manbert, stay; And shield this reckless creature, if thou canst, From ruin and dishonour. Tell her,âhe Who loved her once, would guard her still from shame. Bear my forgiveness to her when I'm gone! Farewell, my trusty Manbert! Take this purse; I ask not where her bribe is,âfor I know Thy honour and thy pride would spurn the trash. [Exit. MANBERT. Thy gold I but retain to furnish me With means to follow thee, my generous master! Enter Elfrida, hastily, with a distracted air. ELFRIDA. I cannot rest! Ha, Manbert! is it thou? Thou hast the purse still?â And the dagger?âspeak! The dagger's work is finished?âit has found The traitor's life-blood? Speak! my faithful Manbert! MANBERT (confused.) There's been as yet no chanceâ To-morrowâin the huntâmy ladyâ [Exit, in haste. ELFRIDA. How?â Ay, ay! 'twere better so! Suspicion then Will never rest on me.âGood God! what am I? Am I turned fiend? that wheresoe'er I go The sounds of hell are ringing in mine ears, And all thingsâeven the clear and holy skies, The flowers, the fountainsâwear the hue of blood! The blood of Athelwold! Nay! not to-morrow! Thou shalt not do the deed to-morrow, Manbert! We'll wait awhileâ(looks wildly round.) Where is he?âgone? [Exit. SCENE II. Adelmine discovered on a rustic seat, near the Castle. ADELMINE. I know not why, my heart is light to-day, And full of music as a bird's in spring; The while I feel that danger threatens me,â Not me alone, but Athelwold and Guido,â And yet my heart is light. (Hums a few notes, and then sings the following.) Before a fair maiden Two offerings shone;â A blossom dew-laden, A sun-coloured stone: Alone in her bower, And musing on them,â She weeps o'er the flower, She smiles on the gem. That tear-drop so tender From Love's fount it steals; But the smile in its splendour A triumph reveals! Thy choice, gentle maiden! 'Tis thineâthine alone! The leaflet, dew-laden,â The sun-illumed stone. The one is the offer Of Power and Pride; With gold in his coffer, And gems for his bride. The other, a token From Passion and Truth; The pure and unbroken,â The love of thy youth. She falters!âthough cruel, The struggle is brief; She claspsânot the jewelâ The tear-laden leaf! He was a faithless bard that made the song, And much he wrongs the sex; I do not think The lady falteredâwhat! between a gemâ A silly jewel, and a glowing roseâ The gift of love! I'll not believe she faltered. (Guido enters behind her unperceived, and lays his hand on her shoulder. Adelmine screams, turns and sees him.) ADELMINE. I thoughtâThank heaven 'twas not that hateful King! Cruel! to fright me so! I'll not forgive thee. GUIDO. Ay! but thou wilt! ADELMINE. I will notâthat I will not! GUIDO. I tell thee, ere yon cloud has crossed the sun, Thou'lt weep thy pardon on my breast, sweet love! ADELMINE. Guido! GUIDO. Dear Adelmine! the King, incensed At my defiance of his haughty will, Has banished me. ADELMINE (throwing herself on his breast.) Thou wilt not go alone? GUIDO. Alone, and unforgiven, Adelmine! ADELMINE. Oh, trifle not!âI do, I do forgive thee. But wilt thou go alone? GUIDO. How should I else? ADELMINE. Oh! is there noneâno friend, whose tireless love Might sooth and bless thee in thy wanderings? GUIDO. I know of none. ADELMINE. Of none?âunkind! (turns away.) GUIDO. Thou dost not mean thyself?âby heav'n thou dost! Those downcast eyesâthat drooping, shrinking formâ That deepening blush!âcome to my heart, my purest! And didst thou dream that I would bear my flower, My timid violet, forth into the stir Of this rude world? Oh! thou wert made to dwell Where but the loving light of heaven, its dew And balmy air, should kiss thy virgin browâ Thou couldst not bide the storm! ADELMINE. And could I not? Oh, Guido! let me go! There is no storm so fierce, but love's pure smile Can light a rainbow through it:âLet me go! GUIDO. And leave thy home? ADELMINE. Thou art my home! GUIDO. Thy maiden dreams of joy? ADELMINE. They go with thee! Oh! if thou leave me here Without them, love, an exile from thy heart, Thou art a sterner tyrant than the King, And dost enforce a sadder banishment Than even thine own! Thou wilt not, gentle Guido! GUIDO. But were it known that we escape together, Fierce Edgar's anger might alight on thee. ADELMINE (in a low, emphatic tone.) His anger is less fearful than his love! GUIDO. By heaven! thou mov'st me now. Thou'rt in his power! The very thought hath madness in't! Thou'lt fly? ADELMINE. I will. GUIDO. But how? ADELMINE. I thought not how! But stay!âTo-morrow doth the King go forth, With all his train, to hunt. The wandering bard Who came last night, and for whose simple wants I did provide, is grateful for my care: I'll have for gold his mantle and his cap; And thus disguisedâfor well the minstrel-garb Will hide the beatings of a woman's heartâ I'll join the chase, and meet thee in the forest. GUIDO. Be it so then! To-morrow's sun shall see A bride more beauteous than his own Aurora! Farewell! Heaven bless thee! [Exeunt different ways. END OF ACT IV. ACT V. SCENE I. A sumptuous Chamber in the Castle, hung with the richest tapestry, and adorned with silver mirrors, couches and footstools of oak, inlaid with gold and covered with embroidered silk. In the centre of the room a golden table, beautifully wrought. Edgar, richly dressed, is seated by it alone; and on it is a wooden goblet, embossed with jewels and rimmed with gold; beside this stands a large silver vessel, containing wine. EDGAR. Beshrew these lovely witches! they've possessed me, They've haunted me all night, and even now Alternate glide before my spell-bound eyes! There, with alluring grace and lightning looks, Majestic Elfrid waves her snowy arm, And proudly bids me follow her to joy! And here, on light and fairy feet flits by The young and dark-eyed Adelmine!â Her gaze Bent to the earth in virgin bashfulness; And on her cheek the pure and dimpled rose Of innocence and love! Enter an Attendant. ATTENDANT. So please your Grace, There's one without would private speech with you. EDGAR. Admit him, slave! [Exit Attendant. How sweet a dream he broke! Re-enter Attendant, with Dunstan, disguised in a long dark mantle. EDGAR (laying his hand on his sword.) Thy name, sir stranger? DUNSTAN (throwing back his cloak.) Benedicite! EDGAR. Ah! reverend Father! thou? (Kneels. Dunstan lays his hand on Edgar's head; he rises, and they seat themselves.) But why art here at this untimely hour? DUNSTAN (sternly.) Because untimely deeds do call me hither! My son, while busy with my pious duties, I heard by chance of this thy sudden journeyâ I unconsulted!â'Twas ill done, young sir! EDGAR. Name me some penance, Father! DUNSTAN. Of that anon. How purpose you to win the fair Elfrida? EDGAR. I think not, care not howâso I do win her! But this I purposeâAthelwold must die!â He hath deceived me. DUNSTAN. If he die publicly, the world will say He perished only that the King might live In beauteous Elfrid's heart! He must not die Unless the stroke be secret! EDGAR. Be it so. Let me but win Elfridaâand that soon! I die till she is mine! DUNSTAN. Shame on thee, son! Hast thou no reverence for this holy garb. Know! reprobate! the thunders of the church Have reachedâmay yetâthe crowned head! Beware! EDGAR. I humbly crave your pardon, reverend Father. I pray you, pledge me in a draught of wine. Ho! slave! another goblet! (Dunstan slowly fills the goblet.âRe-enter Slave, with another.) DUNSTAN. Heaven forbid That I should so pollute my sacred calling! [Exit Slave. And yet, it ill beseems the lowly, poor, And humble priest, to thwart his Sovereign's will. Health and success, my son! (Drains the goblet and fills it again, Edgar does the same.) EDGAR. When once the Earl's despatched, I shall, with your good countenance, reverend sir! Espouse the lady Elfrid.âThis I promised E'en at the banquet-board. DUNSTAN. And should the church, In her benign compassion for the frailty Of an oft-erring son,âdeign to o'erlook Th' unseemly haste and manifest foolishness Of such an actâ These broad and fair estatesâ (Drains the goblet again.) EDGAR (smiling.) Shall prove my gratitude and my remorse, They shall be her'sâ Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! Commend me to a reverend, for preparing A salve for tender consciences beforehand! (Fills up Dunstan's goblet again.) DUNSTAN. Farewell! thou graceless boy! Remember! and beware! betray me not! I come disguised, because it is not meet My name were known in these designs of thine. Farewell! my blessingâ EDGAR. But see! your goblet is as yet undrainedâ DUNSTAN (demurely.) I am your subject, and must needs obey. (Drains it a third time.) EDGAR. Well said, and as well done! Your blessing, Father! (KneelsâDunstan gravely blesses him, and Exit.) EDGAR. Nay, by the mass! these priests are jolly fellows! [Exit. SCENE II. An extensive Forest.âStormâThunder &amp; Lightning Enter Edgar. EDGAR. Curse on my weakness, For yielding to a woman's light caprice. To please this wayward beauty, we must all, I and my train, give up the huntâalight To rest us in the wood,âbecause, forsooth, The day was sultry. Our good steeds, meanwhile, Must wander where they list,âthe search for them Would be so pleasant!âWell! we did her bidding. But hardly were we seated, when the storm Suddenly roseâour frightened horses dashed Like wildfire through the forestâwe dispersed In search of themâand here am I, alone, Baffled in my pursuit of Athelwold; Bewildered, and almost exhausted. (Enter Oswald.) Ha! Oswald, there's not a moment now to lose, I am too weary to pursue him farther: Go thou, and ere he find his steed, find him. Despatch him, friend, while I do rest myself In yonder cave, and if thou meet'st my train, Bid them haste there. But stayâdo thou go first Into the cave, and bring me prompt report If it be fitting for a King's repose. SCENE III. An immense Cavern.âStorm continues.âAthelwold near the mouth of the Cave. ATHELWOLD. But for this darkness which obscures the path, I had been distant many a league ere now. (Looks round.) I'll find some place to hide me, 'till his train Pass by! 'Tis a dread cave! Tradition tells, Ages ago, the mystic Druids hewed Its hollow in the rock;âand once, 'tis said, A horrid murder here was perpetrated; In sooth a fitting scene.âHa! some one comes! (He retires to the back of the Cave.) Enter Oswald. OSWALD. The selfish tyrant! let him do his deeds Of hell with his own hand,âI'll none of them. I've injured Athelwold enough already. His murder too, might baffle all my schemes Of vengeance on his wifeâby making clear Her pathway to the throne.â'Tis her disgrace, And not his death I seek. ATHELWOLD (coming forward.) Is it Oswald's voice that speaks? OSWALD. Thou here?âflyâfly! Fierce Edgar seeks thy life! ATHELWOLD. I know it, friend.âBut, Oswald, ere I fly, I've a commission for thee.âWilt thou seek The caitiff who betrayed me to the King?â OSWALD Wilt please you go, my Lord? ATHELWOLD. Ay! ay! in time! But on his craven back avenge thy friend. OSWALD. No more! ATHELWOLD. Yes! whip him as thou wouldst a rebel bondsman, Whose saucy malice had been arm'd against thee. OSWALD. By heaven! ATHELWOLD. Thou wilt? I know thou wilt, my friend. And tell him, I, if e'er he cross my path, Will tear his venomous tongue from out his throat, And fling it back into his faceâthe dastard! OSWALD. Fool! dost thou sport with fate? Then take it! thus! (Stabs him.) Enter Edgar. ATHELWOLD (to Oswald.) False knave! Have at thee! (They fight.) Enter Guido, with Adelmine in a Gleeman's dress. ADELMINE (screaming, and throwing herself between the combatants.) 'Tis Athelwold, and they would murder him! (Edgar rushes forward and drags her away.) (Athelwold falls.) EDGAR. What puny thing art thou that dar'st intrude 'Twixt me and vengeanceâ (Pointing a dagger at her breast.) (Guido wrenches the dagger from his hand, while Attendants enter and seize him.) GUIDO. My Adelmine! reveal and save thyself! (The Storm meanwhile has gradually ceased, and at this moment the Sun shines suddenly out upon the scene.) EDGAR. Adelmine! My lovely peasant! lovelier than ever! Kneel, for thy pardon, prettiest! ADELMINE (throws off her cap and mantle, beneath which is a bridal-robe befitting her station;â while her long tresses fall around her, partly confined by a band of jewels.) Not to thee, Though thou wert Monarch of the universe. Look there, assassin! (Points to the dead body of Athelwold. Then goes to it, and covers it tenderly with her mantle.) Enter Elfrida, behind, unseen by them. EDGAR (gazing in surprize at Adelmine.) She's noble then! I feared so! By heaven, her pride becomes her gloriously! She must be mine, by some means, foul or fair. What sayest thou, maiden? wilt thou share my throne? ELFRIDA (aside.) Ha! ADELMINE. Never! EDGAR. Nay! sweetest, think again! ADELMINE. False hearted King! I scorn thee! EDGAR. Die then, insulting girl! (Draws his dagger.) (Guido struggles with his guards.) ADELMINE. Death were the dearer bridegroom! (Edgar sheaths his dagger.) ELFRIDA (coming haughtily forward.) Saw you my lord? OSWALD (gloomily.) There lies what was thy lord, And thou hast slain him! ELFRIDA (shrieking, and throwing herself on her knees, by the body.) Athelwold! speak! speak! One wordâoh! one! of pity and of pardon. Look up, my loveâElfrida kneels to theeâ Thy wife, whom thou didst watch so tenderly, And who repaid thee with her cursesâlive! Oh! live! that I may love thee! worship thee! My noble lord! It is too lateâtoo late! (She rises slowly, and stands for some moments as if abandoned to despair.âThen, looking wildly round, she sees the King and Adelmine. âShe springs forwardâdrags the former towards the bodyâpoints to it, and cries.) It was for thee I killed him! ay! for thee, Thou beardless boy! And what is my reward? My guilty passion scorn'dâmy promis'd crownâ The bauble I have sold my very soul for, Offered, before me, to a whining child! Why, give it to her, King! the paltry toy! But, stir notâspeak notâtill thou hast restored Life to the heart that loved me! Give him back! Give me my lord, my noble generous husband. (She throws herself again, in a passion of tears, on the body.) EDGAR (aside to Oswald.) Now must this beauteous fury be appeased, Or with the murder all the realm will ring. Besidesâshe'll queen it bravelyâ Will she not! So lovely, even in her rage! (To Elfrida, aloud.) Mine own Best love!âMy fair Elfrida! wilt thou let A moment's playful jesting with a child, Deprive me of my heart's elected?âCome! Poor Athelwold was slain in equal fight, And shall have noble burial.â Come,âmy queen! Power, pomp, and love and homage wait thee still, Mistress of Edgar's soul and kingdom.âCome! England shall see a star upon her throne, Whose light shall glad the universe! ELFRIDA (aside.) England shall see a tigress on her throne, Thirsting for victims in her soul's despair! OSWALD (aside.) And this is my revenge! Blind fool! EDGAR. And lest This pretty runaway disturb us moreâ Here Guido, take her hand! Elfrida pardons you! (Guido comes forward and takes her hand.)

      <field name="fulltext">MISCELLANEOUS POEMS. EDWARD'S VOICE. Who taught that tiny voice of thine Its wealth of sweetness, child? Who tuned each tone to love divine, With melody so mild? Ah! simple is the spell, I ween, That doth that grace impart; It dwells his own sweet self within, It isâa loving heart! WHY DONT HE PROPOSE? An Epistle from Miss Seraphine Languish to Miss Jane Herbert. You've seen Sir George Eustace? rich, handsome, and good, dear, As brave as a lion, as mild as a dove; Ever since I have known him, I've tried all I could, dear, To win from his lips an avowal of love! The world gives him to meâits debtor I stand, Jane; He might be as generous tooâif he chose! Last evening, for two sets he offer'd his hand, Jane; 'Twas only for two sets!âwhy dont he propose? He said, cousin Isabel's dark hair was braided Above her white forehead, with classical grace; The very next morning, my raven locks shaded, In just such arrangement, my lovelier face! He likes Lady Adeline's bands, smooth and glossy; He looks at Georgina's soft tress as it flows;â I've worn my hair waving in curls light and flossy, I've worn Taglionis!âwhy dont he propose? He vows that my dimple is Love's sunny spell, dear; That my form than a fairy's is prettier far; That my teeth are but pearls in a rich crimson shell, dear; My cheek a blush-rose, and my bright eye a star! He says that my voice is bewitchingly tender; I sing to him always of Love's gentle woes! He knows I am ready my heart to surrender;â He knows I adore him;âwhy dont he propose? He likes timid women; by nature I'm bold, love, But once, when it thundered, I clung to his arm; Papa and Mama did look awfully cold, love, But he seemed delighted,âand where was the harm? He gazed on my drooping form, languidly leaning, He pressed my fair fingers as long asâhe chose? His eyes popped the question, with looks full of meaning; But his lips!âhow provoking!âI thought he'd propose! Were I Lady Eustace, no bride of the season Should sport a trousseau so recherchÃ¨ as I! I'd be my own mistress, or I'd know the reason; And wives meek and yielding, for envy should sigh! My robe should be velvet,âmy diamonds should lighten Amid my dark ringlets, as starry night glows! I'd winter in ParisâI'd summer in Brighton! What wouldn't I doâif he'd only propose! THE WITHERED FLOWER &amp; BROKEN HEART. The maiden by her mirror stands, Arraying for the festal dance, Along her hair her jewelled hands From tress to tress like lightning glance; Till all its floating waves of gold Around her graceful head are rolled, And seem so rich its braids and bright, A classic crown of changeful light. Her diamond zone is clasped above A heart that throbs with joy and love; Rich folds of snowy velvet there Meet on a breast as soft and fair; Th' elastic footâa captive lightâ Is laced within her slipper white; And faint the dimpled arm gleams through Her silken glove's transparent hue,â A lily 'neath the wave revealed, That charms the most when half concealed. And now a roseâLove's own sweet flower, His gift in Beauty's triumph hour, To lips that mock its blush is pressed, And laid upon the maiden's breast. In truth it is a pleasant sightâ That form of grace, that head of light! But not the velvet's fairest fold, And not the braid of gleaming gold; Nor flashing circlet on the hand, Nor rainbow-ray of diamond band; Not these the gazer's eye allure, But something far more rich and pure. The rosy glow of girlish joy, Unmingled yet with Care's alloy; The lip's sweet curl of maiden-pride, Not yet to bitterness allied; The glory of those azure eyes, Where virgin dreams of rapture rise; The glad and open brow of youth, Fair shrine of innocence and truth: These, these are charmsâthe trueâthe pureâ That still the gazer's eye allure. The maiden by her mirror stands, Before her clasped her languid hands! Her robe is looseâher feet are bareâ Her head is bent in mute despair, And wildly droops her lovely hair; Her gleaming girdle thrown aside, Resplendent still in jewelled pride, How mocks its diamond's radiant smile, The tears in those blue eyes the while! A withered rose is at her feet;â Wet with those tears, it still is sweet. Ah! not the only flower whose light Is lost in sorrow's shower to-night! A rose was on that eloquent face When last I marked its glowing grace; Her happy heart's warm crimson tide Its soft and changing bloom supplied: The heart is chilled! the cheek is pale! Sweet flowers must die when fountains fail. And what has wrought this wretched change? Alas! 'tis nothing new or strange! Her smile within the festive hall, Was saved for one who smiled on all. Ah! reckless tone and wandering look, A maiden's spirit ill may brook: Yet this has Marion met to-night, With clouded heart and look all light. Not one throughout the wearying dance Wore wilder joy of word and glance; No lighter form, no sunnier eye, No freer footstep floated by. And now 'tis o'er, the hated task, And idle now the mirthful mask; Quick sobs of anger, grief, and shame, Like storm-struck blossom bow her frame; The azure fire that filled her eyes, Is quenched in tears, that blinding rise; And quivering lip, and pallid cheek, The young heart's tale of suffering speak. Ah! beating heart! and blooming flower! Your fate is one: one glorious hour, Ye breathe your wealth of sweetness forth For those, who feel not half your worth; The nextâ'neath cold and reckless eyesâ The full heart breaks!âthe blossom dies! THE FAREWELL SONG OF THE AERONAUT. The cord has been severed that bound me below, The sport of the elements soaring I go; My dwelling a toyâthat the changeable breeze, Like a child wild and wayward, can break if it please Should the four winds of heaven be meeting to-day, A fine game of football the giants will play; Ah! little they'll reck in their glorious glee, That what's sport to them may be ruin to me: That the poor little football might come off the worst It is but a bubbleâthe bubble may burst, And Iâlike the far-fabled child of the sun, Too rashly assuming the reins he had won, And skilless to guide his wild coursers of fire, The victim of idle and daring desire, By the touch of the Thunderer cast from his car, From heaven, a blazing and beautiful star,â I too may be whelmed in the wild rolling wave, No loved one to weep amber-tears o'er my grave! My pathway with danger, with death may be fraught Oh! who will not pity the rash Aeronaut! Yet with heaven all before me, kind wishes behind, I give my light fears like my car to the wind; My flag to the breezeâmy life to the keeping Of Him, the all-merciful, strong, and unsleeping; Unseen by whose eye not a sparrow can fall, And whose word keeps the elements ever in thrall. Content to be wafted thus far on my way, By the prayer of the pensive, the laugh of the gay; While thousands of rosy lips smile as I go, No idle misgiving the rover can know: For the bright eyes of childhood in wonder uprais'd, And the glance of fair woman met mine as I gaz'd; And blest was the fancy that over me stole,â âA wish for my safety may be in her soul, Her prayers may be mine, when alone and afar, The Aeronaut sighs in his desolate car!â The world has a thousand resources for all; But the thrill of strange joy, when I broke from its thrall, Was worth all its gifts, and exulting I thought, Oh! who would not envy the gay Aeronaut! GABRIELLE. IN ILLUSTRATION OF AN ENGRAVING. You can see it on her saddened lip, And in her serious glance; She is thinking of her own dear home, Afar in pleasant France: And she looks as if the tears Were this moment going to rise, From her little heaving heart, To her black and brilliant eyes. She's a pretty creatureâisn't she? I know her very well; She'll be seven years old to-morrow, And her name is Gabrielle. Shall I tell you all about her? Such a charming little girl! Her spirit is as soft, and light, And careless as her curl: Her curls! you cannot see them now, They're tucked beneath that frill; But sometimes o'er her baby brow She lets them wave at will. She is far away from home, Yet her soul is full of love, And the stranger's heart receives her As it would a wandering dove. And many a cold and careless lip Has caught, as by a spell, A smile and tone of tenderness, From gentle Gabrielle. And thus, though she is sorrowing now, She is not often so, For the very power of âloving muchâ Is happiness, you know. And in each living thing she sees, In every bird and flower, The simple, earnest, guileless child Can find a pleasing power. Then, if at times unbidden, The bright warm tears will start, When the shadow of her distant home Goes o'er her happy heart, They glisten on her glowing cheek As beautiful and brief, As drops of sunny morning dew Upon a rose's leaf: And in a moment more, a smile Is dimpling where they fell, So happy and so good is she, The stranger, Gabrielle. She's a very pleasant playmate, Should you like such an one? You cannot think how fond she is Of frolic and of fun! She dances like a fairy, She warbles like a bird, Her laugh has more of melody Than any I have heard. Ah! when she blooms in womanhood I'm sure she'll be a belle; With those rich lips and dazzling eyes, Bewitching Gabrielle! If ever you should chance to meet A loving little girl, With a cap, like this one, lightly tied O'er many a silken curl; With a mouth of earnest sweetness, And a softly rounded cheek, And eyes that richly eloquent A sunbright spirit speak;â If she look just like this picture, And be sure you mark it well, For 'tis the very image Of the graceful Gabrielle;â If, like some wild flower smiling On every passer by, With many a pretty wile, she watch To win your youthful eye: Then take her by her little hand, And say you love her well; And should she whisper, âJe vous aime,â You'll know 'tis Gabrielle. LOVE'S COMPARISON. âOff with the old love, and on with the new.â Must I tell thee, Georgiana, Of my cousin Caroline? How the pretty creature sported with This wayward heart of mine? Oh! her eyes were blue as heaven, love, But not so blue as thine, And yet I almost idolized The eyes of Caroline. Her soft hair rippled to her waist In waves of golden light, Giving glimpses of a shoulder That was exquisitely white; Thine own has just that sunny fall But silkier far than hers, And a fairer neck gleams through them While the wind their beauty stirs. Ah! fondly (when she'd let me), Did I those tresses twine, But it was not near so pleasant, love, As playing thus with thine! Her laugh was like a fairy's laugh, So musical and sweet, Her foot was like a fairy's foot, So dainty and so fleet; Her smile was fitful sunshine, Her hand was dimpled snow, Her lip a very rosebud In sweetness and in glow; But I know a lighter footstep, More melodious a laugh, A hand that's swansdown to the touch, More soft than her's by half, And a smile with more of angel-power To brighten and to bless, And a lip, that (if you'd let me), I would perish but to press! Ah! dearly did I love to hold Her little hand in mine, But I was not half so happy, sweet, As now in taking thine! Her cheek was very eloquent, For there her feelings spoke, Like summer's rosy lightning, The colour o'er it broke; While bewitching smiles and dimples Changed its beautiful repose, Like the zephyr and the sunshine At play upon a rose. But I know a cheek whose blushes, As they trembling come and go, I could gaze upon for ever, If it did not pain thee so; She never sought to shun my gazeâ My petted Caroline, And yet I'd give her sunniest look For one dear blush of thine. Now prythee do not call My cousin Carryâa coquet! When I tell you she had danglers By the dozen in her net; For she was very beautiful, Bewildering and bright, And I own, her pretty, winning ways And words, bewitched me quite. Ah! I even now remember That sweet madness with a sigh, Nay, do not draw the hand away, Nor droop the doubting eye; But think, if I was dazzled thus By careless Caroline, How much more fondly I shall prize So pure a heart as thine! TO LIZZIE. Mine own sweet sister, wheresoe'er I go I hear thy voice melodiously low; Thine eyes, thy soft, dark, eloquent, loving eyes Before me in remembered beauty rise! Doth nature robe her form in rich array, Wreathing her brow with stars for jewels rare! Zoning her waist with the green moss of May, And broid'ring all her vest with blossoms fair? Do her sweet tonesâsweet as thine own the while, Forth from my home my willing feet allure, To wander in the warm light of her smile, And bare my forehead to her breathing pure! I sigh and thinkâif thou wert with me now, Exulting in thy youth, and health, and glee, How wouldst thou toss the ringlets from thy brow, And join in all her joyous revelry! How would thy heart's enthusiast pulses beat, Thy voice with all its wealth of music rise, Her ever changing melody to meet, Love in thy soul, and rapture in thine eyes! Oh! sweetest, loveliest! would that thou wert here, Heaven loses half her holy light to me; Earth is ungraced with all her spring-tide gear, And life itself worth little without thee! THE MORNING WALK, OR THE STOLEN BLUSH. A LOVER'S LAY. Never tell me that cheek is not painted, false maid! 'Tis a fib, tho' your pretty lip pouts while I say it; And if the cheat were not already betrayed, Those exquisite blushes themselves would betray it But listen! this morning you rose ere the dawn, To keep an appointment perhapsâwith Apollo? And finding a fairy foot-print on the lawn, Which I could not mistake, I determined to follow. To the hill-side I track'd it, and tripping above me, Her sun-ringlets flying and jewelled with dew, A maiden I saw!ânow the truth, if you love meâ But why should I questionâI'm sure it was you! And you cannot deny you were met in ascending,â I meanwhile pursuing my truant by stealth,â By a blooming young seraph, who turned and attending Your steps, said her name was âthe Spirit of Health.â Meantime thro' the mist of transparent vermillion That suddenly flooded the brow of the hill, All fretted with gold rose Aurora's pavilion, Illumining meadow, and mountain, and rill. And Health floating up through the luminous air, Dipped her fingers of snow in those clouds growing bright; Then turned and dashed down o'er her votary fair A handful of rose-beams that bathed her in light. Even yet they're at play here and there in your form, Thro' your fingers they steal to the white taper tips, Now rush to that cheek its soft dimples to warm, Now deepen the crimson that lives in your lips. Will you tell me again, with that scorn-lighted eye, That you do not use paintâwhile such tinting is there? While the glow still affirms what the glance would deny? No! in future disclaim the sweet theft if you dare! THE WELCOMING WORD. My own beloved home I left, Fearless of every future care; I leftâ(how could Iâthus bereft?) My precious mother weeping there. And as her last kiss warmed my cheek, A chill came o'er my fainting heart; A strange, cold calm, no words can speakâ How could I from my mother part! Weary I crossed the reckless main, And every wave but seemed a strong And iron link within the chain, âThe lengthening chain I dragged along.â At last the destined shore they traced; I turned away in wordless pain, And saw, beyond âthe watery waste,â My mother and my home again. An exile, ill in heart and frame,â A wanderer, weary of the way,â A stranger, without love's sweet claim On any heart, go where I may! Oh! England! strange and cold to me! When first my footsteps trod thy shore, I felt I'd give the world to be With mother, and at home once more! But sweetly, while I mourned my doom, One silvery voice a welcome spoke; One smile, all radiant through the gloom Of sorrow's night, like starlight broke. And back with that soft glance and tone A faint sweet dream of childhood flew; Those eyes before had met mine own,â That voiceâit was a voice I knew. Ah! none can like the stranger tell, How much of joy a look may give! How high the power, how deep the spell, That in a welcoming word may live! TO MARY P. WILLIS. While, in its exulting, looks, O'er many a stream the eye of day, The tiniest of the dimpled brooks May sparkle in the blessed ray. Mary, though richer gifts than mine Should come to claim thy happy smile, This offering âfrom my heart to thineââ Oh! will it be forgot the while? You heaven in splendour shines o'er all; The beams that light the queenly rose, Upon the violet too will fall, And cheer and bless it while it blows. Sweet! while some gifted poet twines A prouder wreath of rhyme for thee; Let but thy blue eyes love my lines, And read them, and remember me! TO GEORGE P?, ESQ. On his commissioning the Author to purchase for him some Landscapes, by Doughtyâa Summer and Winter Scene. Less proudly and well had the painter pourtray'd His own mountain-land with its sunshine and shade, Were the wealth of his genius less lavishly lent To the landscape where grandeur and beauty are blent; For thee they would still wear a magical grace, Which time cannot alter, or chances efface; For the thought of that impulse, so noble and kind, Which prompted their purchase will be in thy mind; And the sweet recollection will hallow to thee, Each curve of the cloud and each tint of the tree! Hadst thou watch'd the proud Artist with me, when his eyes Were suddenly lifted in joy and surprise, While I, full of childlike emotion, imparted That pleasant behest from the warm and high-hearted, Thou wouldst bless heaven's goodness for giving thee power To soothe, for the lonely, one sorrowful hour! For myself,âI was touched by thy courtesy free, And tho' poor this return for thy kindness may be, Be assured thou hast won, by that generous deed, Something more than the Artist's or rhyme-weaver's meed;â An esteem, that, surviving the painting's rich hue, Its verdure's warm tinting,âits sky's sunny blue,â The rivulet's ripple,âthe cloud's snowy breast,â So soft, it might lure a young seraph to rest,â Will glow, with as true and as fervent a light, When they are all lost in oblivion's night! And now let me pray that thy âsummerâ of life May be still, like the landscape, with radiance rife, That the sunshine of friendship or love light the scene, And the stream of benevolence freshen its green! Then if haply a cloud o'er thy âwinterâ should go, The rose-light of memory round it will glow, And the cold snows of age gather smiles from her ray, That shall pleasantly shine to the close of thy day. THE SPOILT PUPIL OF FANCY. I do not love the teacher, I do not love the school; I cannot bear to talk, and walk, And look, and smile, by rule. Oh! such a stupid lesson As I have learned to-day, About that tiresome prism, And the sun's refracted ray. I'd rather watch the rainbow, In coloured light arrayed, Than study how it came there, Or how its arch was made. I'd rather play with flowers, Beside the fountain free, Or in our garden bowers, Where they always smile on me. While they glory in the sunshine, While they revel in the air, What for their long, hard Latin names Do glowing roses care? My teacher tears their leaves apart, Their orderâclassâto know; I wonder she can have the heart To treat a blossom so! Once, if a flower were dying, On a sultry summer's day, I could hear its spirit sighing Her balmy life away! And now, alas! must Learning's lamp The lovely dream consume; And haughty hum-drum Reason Must dim my bower's bloom! I hate my teazing teacher, I hate to learn by rule; I had a pleasanter governess Before I went to school! She taught me prettier lessonsâ And easier too by far; She bade me think the silver moon A warbling seraph's car. And when I saw it gliding slow The wreathed clouds amid, And caught the gleam of spirit-steeds, That pawed the heavens half-hid; While round them softly glistened The starry train of fire; How earnestly I listened To hear the heavenly choir! She said, the sunny rainbow Was a band of brilliant flowers, Linking heaven and earth together In the lovely summer hours! By cherub fingers braided, In haunts of bliss above, And flung in angel-play to earth, A token of their love! But now, instead of looking For the violet divine, For the heaven-born tulip's glory, And the rose's blush benign; For the tears and smiles of cherubs Shed o'er that garland gay,â I shall think of the rain-drop prism, And the sun's refracted ray! Oh! a thousand lovely lessons My playmate taught of yore; And a thousand thrilling sights I saw Which I shall see no more. For Fancy was my teacher's nameâ A frolic sprite was she,â She bore me on her wings to heaven, She led me through the sea. There marked I many a floating hall, By coral columns graced; And many a dim sea-vision Through the crystal walls I traced. I traced them by the dazzling light Of jewels rich and rare, That hung in garlands round about, And made a glory there. The walls were all of crystal, But the sea waves were the floor; And ocean-sylphs were gliding Its gleamy surface o'er. Between the rosy pillars, Some gaily darting by, In curved shells of varied hue, Their pearly oars did ply. Some were their ringlets wreathing With strange and gleaming flowers; Plucked by the gold-fish's fitful light. In ocean's darkling bowers. Ah! many a scene beyond the stars, Of rapture pure and free, And many a dim sea-vision Did I and Fancy see! But we must part for ever, My playmate sweet and I,â She to some heart as wild as mineâ I to Reality! THE HEART'S-EASE EXPIRING. The sunny-eyed flower looked smiling up, Happy, though failing fast; And a sweet voice stole from its closing cup,â Poor thing! it was breathing its last! âWell!â said the blossom, âI'm dying it seems! And why should I fear to die? I've had my share of life-warm beams From the spirit of light on high. âOh! when the queen-rose, in her beauty and bloom O'ershadowing poor little me, Seemed to bid all the glory of heaven illume Her own wealth of leaves opened free. âShe little imagined the sun's loved smile, Which she deemed was delighted to find her, Was playing bopeep through her stems the while With the happy Heart's-ease behind her! âShe little imagined, when Zephyrus bore On his pinions her rich warm sighs, At the same time he borrowed from my little store An offering sweet for the skies. âShe did not perceive, as she blushingly bent Her brow to his playful caresses, How he slyly stole o'er, and, on mischief intent, My modest cheek covered with kisses! âAnd she never e'en dreamed, when the maiden gay Came to look at her beautiful pet, That she wore my smile in her heart away, While her own grew sunnier yet. âI am sure she will miss me the very next time Her fairy feet glide that way; And what will the herald of day's sweet primeâ Oh! what will the sunbeam say? âWhen he comes to-morrow, and glances round For the poor Heart's-ease in vain, Will his smile be dimm'd as he reaches the ground, Will he wish for my welcome again? âAnd Zephyr too after his soft repose On the heart of some night-blooming flower, Will his kiss be cold for the queenly rose? Will he ask why I fled from her bower? âI have borne every change of my humble lot With a smiling and shadowless eye; And heaven's warm smile has been never forgot When the storm swept sullenly by. âMy life has been innocent, lovely and pure, And all my heart's wealth I have given; Tho' tempests would threaten, and sunbeams lure, Still smiling and true unto Heaven. âA philosopher said, as he passed me one day, That nothing was lost upon earth; Who knows but I'll spring up some fine summer day In a loftier, lovelier birth? âWhatever it is, 'twill be happy and bright,â For where could this sunny heart go, If not into some form of beauty and light?â At least, I will fancy it so! âAh me! I must bid my gay sisters farewell! Sweet Zephyr receive my last sigh! Oh! breathe for the Heart's-ease one requiem knell! I trembleâI witherâI die!â THE LOVER'S APPEAL TO THE PAINTER. How! paint Julie in colours From earthly mixture made! Presumptuous mortal! what art thou That wouldst my love degrade? Go, dip thy brush in heaven, When bluest are her skies, The deep warm hue of summer, To paint those laughing eyes. And clothe its point in sunlight, With a shadow here and there, If thou wouldst give the gleamy wave Of her luxuriant hair. Be sure thou be not sparing, But with hand all free and bold, And generous in its daring, Pour on the glowing gold. And when it floats around her, Like a fountain's spray of light, With its rich ripples bathing Her shoulders snowy white; Then gaze again above thee, And if the dying day Has left its burning blushes there, Oh! snatch the rosy ray! And round her sportive dimples Those hues of beauty trace, Till heaven itself reflected seems Within her radiant face. Alas! the tints of loveliness, If thou couldst thus obtain, The lustre of the lovely tress, The cheeks transparent stain;â What will they be, with all thy care, Without the impassioned soul, That pleads so eloquently there, And animates the whole? SONG.âTHE FORSAKEN. I sunned myself once in her smileâ She has turned its soft beam upon one Who cares not a pin for her, while He triumphs, and I am undone! I lived on the sweets of her lipâ I must seek for a supper elsewhere!â Another that banquet may sip! Another may play with her hair! And why is my rival so dear? And why is she out when I call? His income's a thousand a year!â And mine, it isânothing at all! IMPROMPTU.âTO ANNIE. Her silken lash was drooping, At first she could not speak, But th' eloquent colour trembling rose Upon her youthful cheek: At last the words found way, And tears, till then unshed; In low and faltering tones she spoke,â âMy birds! they are both dead!â Sweet girl! if in thy heart A bird is cherished so, What wealth of love for human friends Within its shrine must glow! THE PET. A STAGE-COACH INCIDENT. Some dear little fellow she chattered about, Whom she was to call for, and take on her route; âThe sweet little creature, my precious, my ownâ The darling!âI wonder how much he has grown! They've taught him some clever accomplishments here;â I long to behold him, the dear little dear! With his dark, melting eyes, and his curling silk hairâ If I dont see him soon, I shall die, I declare! They say that his bow's the perfection of grace; And there's such an expression of soul in his face! The contour of his head is allowed to be fine; And his nose!âoh! it is absolutely divine! And then so bewitching his eloquent whine, When he puts his (I thought she said âhandâ) into mine. I have taught him to kiss me so cunning and sweetâ You'll see how he does it as soon as we meet. You know Lady Seraphine Languishâthey say She has hers washed in lavender three times a day; And the nurse, who is hired on purpose to hold it, Says her orders are never to teaze or to scold it. Every morning she takes the pet out with her lady, To walk in the park where it's pleasant and shady. Lady Languish's plans I should scorn to be stealing, But the world shall not say I am wanting in feeling; And if Sir Astley Cooper dont think it is wrong, Eugenio shall bathe in âBoquet de haut ton.â Some people, I'm told, really laugh at my whim In making so petted a darling of him: Thank heaven! my heart is more gentle and tender, (And tears, as she spoke, dimmed her eye's sunny splendour): Do you know, that last year, when I lay at death's door, And physicians and friends thought that all hope was o'er,â When my husband and little Louisa, you knowâ My youngestâwhom every one's spoiling so; When they were forbidden to enter the room, Lest the sound of a whisper should hasten my doom,â My darling Eugenio close to me crept, With a look of such pathos that I could have wept!â Overcome by emotion, or failing in breath, She paus'd; and reflecting, I sigh'd while I smil'd, For I thought, the poor boy will be petted to deathâ What a pity to spoil so enchanting a child! But while I mus'd thus, the coach stopp'd at a gate; Now, said I, I shall see all these infantine charms: The lady leaned forward, with rapture elate, And a nice littleâlap-dog! jumped into her arms! NONE ARE POOR. Alas! for the gay, who in gorgeous array, And chariots of pride, to God's altars are rolled: They would turn from a love-breathing seraph away If he came not apparelled in purple and gold! She stood 'mid the splendid insignia of wealth; But the jewels that shone o'er her beauty and bloom Were less fair than the sunny ray, smiling by stealth Through the rose-tinted damask that shaded the room! In the flash of her glance there was passion and pride, In the curve of her lip there was haughty contempt, As she spoke of the power to riches allied, Of the evil and pain from which she was exempt. Another stood by, with a soul in her eye, Out-glowing in lustre the sun-ray and gem; And a fount in that soul of warm feeling and high, Whose least emanation was worth all of them. She had pass'd thro' the shadow and sunlight of life, She had learn'd in its storms to exult and endure; And her gentle reply with sweet wisdom was rifeâ âTo me, there are none in the universeâpoor!â ON THE DEATH OF AN INFANT. As if she only sought the earth to bear Her smile into our hearts, and leave it there, Our cherub came and wentâthe tie was riven; Her spirit wears a brighter smile in Heaven! THE ROSE IN ICE. She has a glowing heart, they say, Though calm her seeming be; And oft that warm heart's lovely play Upon her cheek I see. Her cheek is almost always pale, And marble cold it seems, But a soft colour trembles there At times, in rosy gleams! Some sudden throb of love, or grief, Or pity, or delight, And lo! a flush of beautyâbrief, But passionately bright! She minds me of a rose I found In a far southern land,â A robe of ice its blushes bound, By winter breezes fanned. But softly through the crystal veil That gleamed about its form, There came a fitful glow to tell The flower beneath was warm! And thus, though cold her seeming be, Her cheek so calmly fair, Her spirit, struggling to be free, Doth often tremble there! ELLEN'S FIRST TOOTH. Your mouth is a rose-bud, And in it a pearl Lies smiling and snowy, My own little girl! Oh! pure pearl of promise! It is thy first toothâ How closely thou shuttest The rose-bud, forsooth! But let me peep in it, The fair thing to viewâ Nay! only a minuteâ Dear Ellen! now do! You wont? little miser, To hide the gem so! Some day you'll be wiser, And show them, I know! How dear is the pleasureâ My fears for thee pastâ To know the white treasure Has budded at last! Fair child! may each hour A rose-blossom be, And hide in its flower Some jewel for thee! EPIGRAM. The boot pinch'd hardâthe suffering dandy sigh'd! Jane fondly thought the sigh her beauty's due; âBootless your passion, sir!â she proudly cried; âAh!â said the fop, âWould I were bootless too!â FAZRY. Her hands clasped in anguishâher black eyes bent low, With motionless grace, as if sculptured in stone, Half veiled by her dark hair's magnificent flow, Sweet Fazry is standingâa captiveâalone! âKara Aly!ââthe statue awakes to that name, As the marble grew warm 'neath the love-spell of old! Lo! her pale cheek is kindling with beautiful shame, And her eye is on fire with emotion untold! âFrail flower of Kazan! you were nursed from your birth, Amid luxuries rarest and richest of earth;â Why left you that home, with the fierce mountain-chief?â âI loved him!â she murmured, in passionate grief. âSo young and so lovely, a cavern your home! Ne'er languished that spirit for freedom to roam? Rude dwelling for creature so fragile and fair!â She raised her rich eyesââKara Aly was there!â VIRGINIA. I saw her firstâa petted child, Her eyes were blue as heaven; Her cheek was dimpled when she smiled Her lips a rose-bud riven. Her form, the prettiest in the world, Her stepâa fairy's flight, Her hair like shaded sunshine, curled In clusters wild and bright. âA child,â I said,âso artless, wild, And full of mirth her mien; You'd deem her but a lovely child Though she was just fifteen. I met her on her way to school, The snow fell swift and still; The morn was clear and bright, but cool, And I had felt the chill. But idly at that childlike form Fierce Winter flung his dart; Her frolic feet had kept her warm, And Love was at her heart. Her small straw bonnet backward flung, Her cloak, blown here and there, While drops of snow like jewels hung In her disordered hair.â That dimpled cheek was flushed and bright, A smile was on her lip; Her eyes were full of wild delight, And gay her graceful trip. She seemed a sunbeam in my way, The vision warmed my heart, And Memory kept the blessed ray Long after we did part. Years wentâagain her path I've crossed, Ah! from that form and face; What depth of bloom and light are lost, What wealth of artless grace. The world has won herâshe has learned Its measured smile and tread; The foot, that once the snow-flake spurned, By courtly rule is led. And Fashion's hand has smoothed the fold Of that luxuriant hair, Where once the tress of glossy gold Waved wildly on the air. Yet oft, unbidden, to her eyes Quick tears of Feeling start, And while those gems of truth arise, She's still a child at heart. Alas! in all her Beauty's power, Proud, stately, and serene; She knows not one bright thrilling hour Like those of gay fifteen! THE DEATH OF THE TWO FLOWERS. FROM THE FRENCH. âI pray thee do not blossom yet, My fairy rose,âmy pretty pet! Let not the wooing light and air Beguile those tender leaves apart: But keep thy wealth of incense there, With Patience at thy blooming heart. Hold backâmy precious! yet awhile, Thy fragrant breath and glowing smile; I'd rather close beside thee go, And catch thy fitful sweetness so; I'd rather look the leaves between, That love to veil thy virgin sheen, Than have them yielded fair and free To idle eyes, that love not thee: For well I know the hour that sees Thy bloom the plaything of the breeze, Will see thee sigh that bloom away, And I shall mourn my flower's decay! Then oh! not now those petals ope, Keep thou thy smile, and I my hope!â Thus sang our playful Rosaline, Herself a bud of promise rare, With blooming cheek, and brow serene, And step and heart as light as air. At morn she sang!âWhen evening shed Her silvery smile o'er Rosa's head: All lifeless lay the tresses fair, That floated on that early air. All pale in Death's cold shadow, now, The dimpled cheek and smiling brow, While blushed her rose in full blown pride, A glowing mockery by her side! Yes! still its useless life is bore! The human blossom breathed no more! Alas! the flower had kept its bloom To shed it o'er her early tomb. Ere morning's feet yon mountain pressed, It died on that unconscious breast! TO MISS M?. I know that thou art beautiful,â In dreams I see thy face, I see its dimples come and go Like light in frolic grace. Thy rich eyes steal before mine own. 'Neath lashes long and dark, And on thy softly rounded cheek, The maiden bloom I mark. And why is this? what wizard spell Hath touched with prophet power My fancy thus? a simple thingâ A toneâa wordâa flower! I heard thy voiceâso gaily sweetâ I could not choose to guess, The mouth that breath'd it wreath'd with smiles Of playful loveliness. It spoke to one whose tiny lips To lisp thy name shall learn, Though now they can but murmur soft And answering smiles return. In gentle words of love they spoke, And I was very sure, That all thy looks were eloquent, With feeling high and pure. I know that thou art beautiful,â For thou hast told me so, In a sweet language that I learned Of Flora long ago. Thou'st sent me from thy garden bower The latest rosebud there, Its blush was eloquent, its leaves Were rife with meaning rare; It told of virgin bloom and hope, And modesty and truth; Ah! what so fit as fragrant flowers To emblem sunny youth? It touched a weary stranger's heart, That one she had not known, Could give a kindly thought to her In sadness and alone; It minded her of days gone by, When Love's untiring hand Wove blossoms for her youthful brow, In many a graceful band. Ah! far away from home and friends, That heart still warmly beats With something of its olden joy, When such as thou she meets! And oft in future dreams shall rise The eye and glossy curl, The soft rose-bloom and dimple Of the sweet-voiced English girl! TO MRS. W?. Be sure, though gay my seeming be, that pensive wish of thine Breathed from the heart, an echo found, a mournful one in mine; Yet, half with doubting tone you said, âand let the lay be sad;â Ah! could you guess the effort that I make in seeming glad! You cannot!âbless'd as now you are, with friends, and home, and all, That in th' exulting joy of love âour ownâ we fondly call: The loved and loving faces that you've known so long and well, The dear, familiar places where your childish footsteps fell,â Where you joined with careless heart and free, your playmates' blooming band; Ah! happy then as now, in this,âyou trod your native land! You cannot!âfor you are not doom'd in hopelessness to roam, To sigh with clasping hands in vainââmy country and my home!â Should stern Misfortune visit you, or Pain your couch attend, A mother, loving and beloved, would fondly o'er you bend; If Sorrow wound that gentle breast, or Joy the hour beguile, A sister weeps in sympathy, or shares the happy smile. My precious mother, far away, her absent child doth mourn! My sister checks the merry laugh, and sighs for my return!â Her dark eye's lovely lustre bewildering and bright, Her cheek's deep bloom and dimple soft, that mocks the gazer's sight, Are often dimmed with tears for me, while I, alone and sad, Must make a weary effort still to seem serene and glad! With one joy to my wanderings leftâthe loved ones cannot guess, In their bright home beyond the wave, my exile-wretchedness! Ah! gay to you my smile may seem, 'tis but the lightning brief, That flashes from a darkened soul, thro' gathering clouds of grief; And ever when the light is past, the tears are in mine eyesâ Tears that relieve the full, full heart, as showers clear the skies. But enough of selfish sorrow,âlet me speak of happier things, Of the countless kindly deeds and words that cheer my wanderings; Oh! English hearts are warm and true, and English voices sweet, And sweetest when the wanderer with welcoming they greet. But 'mid the many gentle tones whose music I have known, None have touch'd, with softer influence, my spirit than your own; And if some sunny moments yet are mine of genuine mirth, Their light has half been stolen from your happy household hearth: And I shall cherish, as I would a sweet but withered flower, The memory, in my âheart of heart,â of many a social hour. My thanks are thine,âmy simple verse, if it be far from glad, Remember, that with doubting tone, you bade the song be sad. THE CHERUB'S SECRET. What made my Ellen start and smile, Then sink in soft repose again, As if some joyous thought the while Had darted through her slumb'ring brain, Like rosy lightning brief and bright, Illumining a summer night? Perhaps a viewless cherub stole, Young as thyself, as pure and fair, On tiny pinions to thy soul, And whisp'ring some sweet secret there, Awoke that smile of heavenly glee: My Ellen! wakeâand tell it me! WOMAN'S TRUST. A DRAMATIC SKETCH. SceneâGermany. A Masked Ball. Madelon and a Stranger, in a deep recess. MADELON. Why hast thou led me here? My friends may deem it strange, unmaidenly, This lonely converse with an unknown mask. Yet in thy voice there is a thrilling power That makes me love to linger! It is like The tone of one far distantâonly his Was gayer and more soft. STRANGER. Sweet Madelon! Say thou wilt smile upon the passionate love That thou alone canst waken! Let me hope! MADELON. Hush! hush! I may not hear thee. Know'st thou not I am betrothed? STRANGER. Alas! too well I know! But I could tell thee such a tale of himâ Thine early loveâ'twould fire those timid eyes With lightning pride and anger,âcurl that lip, That gentle lip, to passionate contempt For man's light falsehood! Even now he bendsâ Thy Rupert bendsâo'er one as fair as thou, In fond affection. Even now his heartâ MADELON. Doth my eye flash? doth my lip curl with scorn?â 'Tis scorn of thee, thou perjured stranger! notâ Oh! not of him, the generous and the true! Hast thou e'er seen my Rupert? hast thou met Those proud and fearless eyes, that never quailed, As Falsehood quails, before another's glanceâ As thine even now are shrinking from mine ownâ The spirit-beauty of that open browâ The noble headâthe free and gallant stepâ The lofty mien, whose majesty is won From inborn honour,âHast thou seen all this? And darest thou speak of faithlessness and him In the same idle breath? Thou little know'st The strong confiding of a woman's heart, When woman lovesâas I do! Speak no more! STRANGER. Deluded girl!âI tell thee he is falseâ False as yon fleeting cloud! MADELON. True as the sun! STRANGER. The very wind less wayward than his heart! MADELON. The forest oak less firm! He loved me not For the frail rose hues and the fleeting light Of youthful loveliness!âAh! many a cheek, Of softer bloom, and many a dazzling eye, More rich than mine, may win my wanderer's gaze! He loved me for my loveâthe deep, the fond! For my unfaltering truthâhe cannot find, Rove where he will, a heart that beats for him With such intense, absorbing tendernessâ Such idolizing constancy as mine! Why should he change then?âI am still the same STRANGER. Sweet infidel! wilt thou have ruder proof? Rememberest thou a little golden case Thy Rupert wore, in which a gem was shrined?â A gem I would not barter for a world!â An angel face!âits sunny wealth of hair In radiant ripples bathed the graceful throat And dimpled shoulders,âround the rosy curve Of the sweet mouth a smile seemed wandering ever,â While in the depths of azure fire that gleamed Beneath the drooping lashes, slept a world Of eloquent meaningâpassionate, but pure!â Dreamy, subdued,âbut oh! how beautiful!â A look of timid, pleading tenderness, That should have been a talisman to charm His restless heart for aye! Rememberest thou? MADELON (impatiently.) I doâI do remember! 'twas my own! He prized it as his lifeâI gave it him! What of it? speak! STRANGER (shewing the miniature.) Lady, behold that gift! MADELON (clasping her hands.) Merciful heaven! Is my Rupert dead? (After a pause, during which she seems overwhelmed in agony.) How died he?âwhen? Oh! thou wert by his side In that last hourâand I was far away! My blessed love! Give me that token!âspeak! What message sent he to his Madelon? STRANGER (supporting her, and strongly agitated.) He is not dead, dear lady! grieve not thus! MADELON. He is not false, sir stranger! STRANGER. For thy sake, Would he were worthier! One other proof I'll give thee, loveliest! if thou lov'st him still, I'll not believe thee woman! Listen then! A faithful lover breathes not of his bliss To other ears.âWilt hear a fable, lady?â Softly from heaven the starlight fell, And trembled in the playful wave; Faintly the far-off vesper bell Its wild and mournful music gave! With frolic feet, and floating hair That glistened in the radiant air, A maiden sought the river's side; The white sands beamed beneath her tread, And smiled beyond the baffled tide, That murmuring and receding fled. Their silvery sparkle caught her eye,â Smooth was their tempting sheen and dry; The summer evening still and warm; The maiden weary;âon the sand She lightly laid her fairy form, And leaned her head upon her hand. And as she leaned, her lovely hair Fell o'er a forehead pure and fair,â Shaded her drooping eyes of blue,â Swept her soft cheek's transparent hue,â And trembled, like a glossy wreath Of gold, upon the ground beneath! That dreaming maiden did not hear The swift, light footstep, stealing near; She did not see the knee that bent Beside her softly, as she leant! With faltering finger, in the sand She traced a single word, and then She blushed, and passed her pretty hand Across it, and began again;â âRupertâ she wroteânay start not so! Fair lady! why that sudden glow? Once more she traced the nameâand lo! Beside it, as by magic, shone Another!âit was âMadelon!â The maiden turned, confused, distressed,â Her Rupert clasped her to his breast!â While fond and warm, the impassioned boy Revealed his love, his hope, his joy, To her young cheek the rose of shame In glowing tumult softly came; And trembled in her timid eye The tear of maiden-modesty! But Rupert kissed away the tear, And Rupert soothed her bashful fear: And ere the vesper hymn was done, A plighted maid was Madelon! Lady! my task is o'erâdost doubt me still? MADELON. Doubt thee, my Rupert!âah! I know thee now! Fling by that hateful mask!âlet me unclasp it! No! thou wouldst not betray thy Madelon! (Takes off his Mask.) RUPERT. Come to my heart! my faithful! my adored! Oh! guileless, constant, true as heaven itself, Must be the breast wherein dwells trust so pure! MADELON. And didst thou think to shake my faith in thee By idle tales like these? Yet it was wrong, A cruel mockery, Rupert! Woman's love Is far too tender and too soft a flower To be so played with!âAh! we may not deal Too roughly with the rose!âAnd why was this? RUPERT. Forgive me, Madelon!â'twas but to try Thy strength. In my long wanderings I have heard So much of woman's fickleness, and seen So much of evilânay! of ruin, wrought By woman's causeless jealousy!âBut thouâ Oh! thou hast been a bright and holy proof That only in the heart too prone itself To stray from truth, doth dark suspicion dwell! I bless thee then, my noble Madelon! For thy deep love, and thy unconquered trust! A COMPARISON BETWEEN A TALKATIVE FOOL AND A SILENT PHILOSOPHER. While shallow, babbling brooks, elate, Still of their worthless pebbles prate; The deeper waters silent flow Above the treasures hid below. TO ?. I vowed to thee a votive strain, But strove to keep my vow in vain; For when with some kind deed of thine I thought to fire the feeble line,â A myriad on my memory rushed, And lo! the grateful muse was hushed! I could not to thy mind recallâ I could not thank thee for them all! Yet, though the melody and fire Of love upon my lips expire; 'Tis only in my heart to play With sweeter power and warmer ray! TO ISABELLE. Thou'lt speed thy conquering way, I trow, Through hearts however narrow: Thy lips are Cupid's prettiest bow, Thy smile his surest arrow! THE PERJURED BRIDE. This golden band! it weighs like lead! Unclasp it from my aching head! Take off the veil of silver light,â Its dazzling waves oppress my sight! Ah me! methinks my weary brow Is scarce relieved or lightened now!â Quickâquick! the jewelled zone unwreathe! It binds my heart! I cannot breathe! Oh! loose my robe!âeach gorgeous fold That glitters on my joyless breast, Seems like a serpentâbright but coldâ It chills my life-blood!âlet me rest! Take from my throat this hateful chain!â So! I am free!âI breathe again! Free did I say?âoh! mockery wild As e'er on frenzied woman smiled! I do but sport in maniac glee With my own maddening misery! Free did I say? Have I not given Myselfâmy heartâthoughtâfeelingâwill, To fetters that may ne'er be riven, Until that heart's last throb is still? Have I not spoken words, whose power Is as an adamantine chain,â Linking me from this fatal hour To falsehood, sorrow, guilt, and pain? Ah no! 'twas not the gem-lit zone That weighed upon my heart like stone! 'Twas not the gaudy golden chain That clasped so tight my throbbing brain! And not amid my robe's light fold The serpent's icy rings were rolled! That loadâthe load of woe and sinâ That poison-fang are all within! Oh God! but to recall the pastâ But one, one hour, the dreadâthe last! To know once more the power to choose What then I madly dared refuse! I saw them all, ere yet the vow Had seared my soul and shamed my brow: Beautiful in its pure repose, My own, my early home arose; The blessed cotâits garden bowersâ Its lowly lattice, laced with flowersâ Oh! softly round it stole the breeze, Like music through the murmuring treesâ And radiant still to memory's eye, The silver rill went singing by. There Innocence, and Hope, and Truth, Linked with the guileless Love of youthâ A holy bandâdid smiling rise, And woo me with their angel eyes! Soft as a whispering waterfall, I heard their sweet, imploring call!â I heard, and heeded not! I turned, With heart that wildly, proudly burned;â A haughtier vision met my sightâ A palace-hall of dazzling light; And on its couch of luxury rare, Dishonour sat with jewelled hair! And from its festal-board the while, Did golden-fettered Misery Smile on me with a mocking smile! What were their gems and gold to me? Alas! within the lustrous braid, That garlanded that drooping head, So rich the diamond's lightning-play, That I was blinded by the ray! I did not mark the weary eyeâ I did not hear the hopeless sigh; And when that smileâso strangeâso coldâ Beamed from a forehead brightly crowned, I only saw the gleaming goldâ And not the wasted brow it bound! Near and more near the vision grew; My fair home faded from my viewâ High swelled the syren-song of pride; Mournful and slow,âreceding still, Love's pleading accent falteredâdied! I triumphed in my wayward willâ I took that form with glittering crownâ I pressed that splendid couch of downâ Flung from my heart the Pure, the Fair!â And clasped a golden fetter there! TO H?. Dont say you are not pretty! With that fair, frank brow of thine, And those eyes, where truth and tenderness So eloquently shine. Dont say you are not charming, While that cheek so softly glows With the loveliest and lightest hue, That warms the summer rose. With thy silken ringlets shadowing The smiling beauty there, As clouds, the soft vermillion, veil, That radiant morn doth wear. I would bid you ask your glass, love; But those modest eyesâI know itâ Will distrust the light reflections, Both of mirror and of poet! Ah! could you look into my heart And watch your image there! You would own the sunny loveliness Affection makes it wear. THE LAMENT OF JOSEPHINE. âMon ami!â no! that name is not For one, who hath his faith forgot,â My husband! oh! no more that word Must from these faltering lips be heard, No more this breaking heart may dare To breathe its warm devotion there! A loftier title they must learn, A colder name must on them dwellâ Oh! thou canst teach them to be sternâ Napoleon! Emperor! Fare thee well! I loved!âthat feeling deep defied What lighter love had shrunk beneath,â Thy cold neglect, thy careless pride, E'en dark suspicion's withering breath; I loved;âI turned away from all, That might a woman's mind enthrall, To watch my hero's wayward smile, To wait his fondâhis lightning-glance, And felt beneath it beat the while The happiest heart in sunny France: I loved;âthe jewelled coronet, Upon this favoured forehead set, Well might I deem it bright and fair! The hand I worshipped placed it there! 'Twas not the crown!âa wreath of flowers, A simple wreath entwined by thee, The gift of those unclouded hours, Had been as fondly prized by me! 'Twas thou I loved;âthe loveliest gem In that resplendent diadem, Was less to Josephine than one Kind look from thee when all was done! My foes have seen me by thy side, And murmured at my titled pride,â I had a title, dear as life,â Not Empressâno!âNapoleon's wife! Thy wife,âthe true, the proud, the blest, The first to mark thy changing mood, The last beside thy couch of rest, When pain that hero-heart subdued;â Thy wife,âwhen all devoted France Stood thrilling 'neath thy eagle glance, When flatterers bent the ready knee, And hailed their idol-lord in theeâ Who stood amid the joyous scene, With gladder eyes than Josephine? Whose smile of welcome flashed like hers, Amid that throng of worshippers? And must I leave thee? oh! to go, In grief away, unloved, forgot! And, far from thee, to feel, to know, Another's smile may light thy lot! To thinkâthe while in lonely sorrow, I turn, untired, to dream of thee, And look to every wretched morrow, In hopeless, heartless misery,â That where my hand in fondness fell So oft upon that kingly brow, Another's touch unchecked may dwell, Another's lip may bless thee now! Oh! rather strike thy victim here! Thusâat thy feet! that death were dear! Yet fare thee well! when once again Thou com'st, with glorious triumph flushed, And thou art hailed, in bright Bretagne, From where the red war-stream hath gushed; Amid that sweet applause, I ween, Thou'lt miss the voice of Josephine. I know thy yet unchanging star, Bright symbol of thy destiny, Whose mystic radiance streamed afar, Along thy path to victory; And but to see in life's decline, Its place in heaven undimmed and bright, I'd bless the cloud that darkens mine, And calmly watch its fading light! But well I know that star may wane, That conquering arm may strangely fail, And Europe yet may rend the chain, That bids her crowns before thee quail:â 'Twas wild ambition's voice that spoke, When first thy warrior-spirit woke; 'Twas high ambition's lofty tone, That led thee to the imperial throne; 'Tis stern ambition's accents now, That bid thee break thy hallowed vow. Yet pause! that syren voice erewhile, Thy steps to ruin may beguile, And thou wilt mourn, alas! too late, Thy splendid dream of Empire fled, And curse the cold inglorious fate That hovers o'er thy haughty head. Oh! in that hour of dark despair, When thou art left, perchance, alone, Will thou recal the voice that ne'er Will lose for thee its soothing tone?â And think that one, unchanged by all, By wrong, misfortune, absence, time, Still turns more fondly in thy fall, To theeâto thee,âwhate'er thy crime? Content,ânay, blest, if by thy side, When others leave thee, she might stay, And smiling there, whate'er betide, Forget thy once despotic sway! Alas! that hour may never be, Thy mandate all too rudely fell,â Yet oh! the heart that breaks for thee, Forgives and blesses!âFare thee well! TO ?. I would not tell thee for the world Thy early love will change; I would not see thy sweet lip curled In scorn of words so strange. I would not bid thy smiles away, Nor quell thy speaking blush; For happy spirits lend the ray, And timid thoughts the flush. Yet love is but a dangerous guest For hearts so young as thine, Where youth's unshadowed joy should rest, Life's spring-time fancies shine. Too soonâoh! all too soon would come In later years the spell, Touching, with changing hues, the path Where once but sunlight fell. Then, sweetest, leave the wildering dream, Till time has nerved thy heart To brook the fitful cloud and gleam Which must in love have part. Ah! life has many a blessed hour That passion never knows; And youth may gather many a flower Beside the blushing Rose. Turn to thy books! my gentle girl! They will not dim thine eyes, Thy hair will all as richly curl, Thy blush as brightly rise. Turn to thy friends! a smile as fond On friendship's lip may be, And rising from as true a heart As love can offer thee. Turn to thy home! affection wreathes Her dearest garland there; And more than all, a mother breathes For theeâfor thee, her prayer! Ah! life has many a hallowed hour Of joy, Love never knows! And youth may often find a flower More precious than the Rose! LETTER TO AN ABSENT FRIEND, On seeing Celeste for the first time in âThe Wept of Wish ton Wishâ (Written many years since.) My friend, by joy and genius fired, Thy sketch betrayed the poet's mind; And critic Taste approved, admired, And Feeling but one fault could find. One fault! for when thy glowing pen Portrayed the scene of festive pleasure, And bade it breathe and move againâ The mirthful strainâthe graceful measure,â It did not tell of one regret For her, who shares thy griefâthy joy; And didst thou, dearest, quite forget? And had that scene no sad alloy? I know by mine own heart it had, Wherever play its pulses free,â Aloneâin crowdsâsereneâor sadâ In shade or shineâthey play for thee! I too last evening joined the throng, I too beheld in rapture's trance, Like some wild vision waked by song, The graceful âspirit of the dance.â In guise of Indian girl she walked, The forest-fawn less light of foot; And while each look, each motion talked, Her stepâher voiceâalike were mute! Torn from her homeâa trembling child, Of sense and speech bereft by fear; She comesâa wanderer from the wild,â Nor knows that long-lost home is near. Her sister strives, by many an art, To bring back memory's powerâin vain! She clasps her red-boy to her heart,â She's pining for the woods again! âSee, love, the chain you used to wear,ââ That out-stretched hand! that look of joy! Alas! no memory wakens there,â To her 'tis but a pleasing toy! But hark! a soft and soothing strain! The song her mother used to sing! 'Tis o'er!âshe strives for it again, As if her spirit would take wing. Again it comes!âthe trinkets fall,â She rises with the music's swell! Struggles for utteranceâbreaks the thrall!â âMother!â she sighed, and lifeless fell! And now, her warrior-love is low; Her gun is seizedâraisedâaimedâoh heaven! They lift her child before the foe! She shrieksâas if her heart were riven! âConanchet diesââdark Uncas said; Her arms around his neck she threw, And moan'd, while mournful droop'd her head, âThen Narramattah will die too!â In the next scene her chief is slain,â And she, o'erwhelmed with woe unspoken, Creeps to himâtakes his handâand then Dies silently,âher heart is broken! She dies! the Indian girl!âbut oh! When the dark curtain rose again, Celeste! how radiant was the glow Of life, o'er all thy features then! She comes! âthe spirit of the dance!â And but for those large, eloquent eyes, Where passion speaks in every glance, She'd seem a wanderer from the skies! So lightâthat gazing breathless there, Lest the celestial dream should go, You'd think the music in the air Waved the fair vision to and fro! Or that the melody's sweet flow Within the radiant creature played! And those soft wreathing arms of snow, And white sylph-feet the music made. Now gliding slow with dreamy grace, Her eyes beneath their lashes, lost, Now motionless, with lifted face, And small hands on her bosom crossed. And nowâwith flashing eyes she springs, Her whole bright figure raised in air; As if her soul had spread its wings, And poised her one wild instant there! She spoke notâbut so richly fraught With language are her glance and smile; That when the curtain fell, I thought She had been talking all the while! Yet, though so lost in rapture's trance, Too oft beyond my reason's will, That I forgot myself, perchance,â Thou, dearest, wert remembered still. In every scene of tenderness, At every proof of noble pride, Through all the heroine's wild distress, I wished that thou wert by my side. Yes! I too sometimes join the throng, I smileâwhen smiling eyes I see; I watch the danceâI list the song, But everywhere I think of thee! TO ELIZABETH. They may talk of delicate tresses, That float in golden streams; And wooing the sun's caresses, Have caught and kept his beams. They may tell of eyes of azure, That smile, and smile, and smile, Full of the light of pleasure All the long while. They may rave of a lily cheek, Where never a blush doth dart; Ah! too like a lily to speak The thoughts of a living heart! But richer thy hair that resembles The raven's plumage wet, And brighter thine eye-beam trembles Under its lash of jet. And whiter far the forehead Beneath such shadow lies; With a light by contrast borrowed From the cloud-like curls and eyes. Those laughing orbs, that borrow From azure skies the light they wear, Are like that heaven, no sorrow Can float o'er hues so fair. Give me those skies, when darkling Soft clouds contend with light, When shower and sunshine sparkling, The dazzled eye delight. Give me those eyes, where often The tears of feeling shine, The gazer's heart they soften, And win its love like thine. Give me the eloquent cheek, Where blushes burn and die; Like thine, its changes speak The spirit's purity! Ah! though it give thee pain, So beautiful the glow, We cannot choose but gaze again, To see it come and go. Thy face seems ever stealing The rosesârichâdivineâ That Love, and Joy, and Feeling, Within thy heart entwine! I know no holier prayer Than that I breathe for thee; That ever, as unbidden, there, That modest blush may be. TO AN ATHEIST POET. Lov'st thou the music of the sea? Call'st thou the sunshine bright? HIS voice is more than Melody! HIS smile is more than Light! TO ANNA, IN REPLY TO A LETTER. Dont say you are âugly,â you darling! While still your sweet letters unfold The same glowing soul, that enlivened Those delicate features of old!â That soul, whose pure fire would illume, love, A cheek of less exquisite mould, With a changeable beauty and bloom, love, To which that of a Venus were cold. Dont say you've grown âugly and stupid,â While still, in each line, I can trace, Some glimpse of those lovely emotions, Which once I could read in your face! When you tell me your mind wears a chain, love, When you tell me your heart is asleep, Then may-be, but never till then, love, The wreck of your beauty I'll weep. THE HOURS OF YORE. I cannot choose but sing the strain That many a bard has sung before, That thousands yet will wake again,â The hours of yore! the hours of yore! The hours of yore! sweet childhood's hours, When all the livelong day I played With sunbeams, butterflies, and flowers, And wavelets in the woodland glade. I cared not then for plumes and pearlsâ The forest leaves were gems to me, I wreathed them round my careless curls, And found a crown in every tree! The murmuring fount my music made, I danced on Nature's broidered floor, A queen was I in the woodland glade, A crowned queen, in hours of yore! I deemed the flowers were all alive, I fancied birds could talk like me, And many an hour I'd listening strive To think what could their meaning be! I did not sigh for wealth or pleasure; If through the leaves a sunbeam stole, I called the ray my golden treasure, And blessed its beauty in my soul! Oh, monarch! 'mid your courtier train,â Oh, sage! half crazed with mystic lore,â Sing, sing with me the sad refrainâ âThe hours of yore! the hours of yore!â ATTIC ASPIRATIONS. âMa'am, shall I 'eat the hiron?â Betty said; âNo, Betty! eat your supper, and to bed!â ROMANCE. You can trace it in all in word and look, Through her lightestâher loftiest deed it plays, As you trace by the gleam of a graceful brook, Through valley and forest its winding ways. A vein of Romanceâlike a vein of gold And its source, is a mine of wealth untold, The wealth of rich feelingsâthe deepâthe pure, With strength to meet sorrow, and faith to endure. It smiles through triflesâa fairy gleam, Like a sparkle 'mid flowers of the playful stream, And often through higher and graver things, It breaks with its beauty and fresh delight, As the ray of the rivulet's rippling rings, Comes up in the woods on the startled sight. To such in the faintest cloud that floats, In the simplest leaf of the garden bower, In the least of the woodland warbler's notes, Is a charmed language, a spell of power. The cloud?âoh! an angel waves, they say, His wings in Heaven's resplendent air, And floats away in the holy ray, Shedding their delicate shadow there. The bird is singing the stars beneath, To Nature's harp with its viewless chords, And the fair bouquet, or the graceful wreath, Is a cluster, or garland, of fragrant words. Such was the spirit that thrilled her hand, When gaily bending her sweet work o'er; She wreathed with the flowers of her native land, The lowly steps of her cottage door. But the prettiest far of her pets was one, You'd fancy had fed on the beams of the sun; It seemed to look up in my face the while, So brightly, I thought that I saw it smile: It was that with the petals of purple and gold, Whose sweet appellations the poet has told. I passed them, and stood by the open door, But she stooped to gather and give me a flower; Playfully murmuring, stay! if you please! You pass not my threshold without âHeart's-ease!â Oh! long may the blossom, whatever betide, The tenderest breath of the summer-wind win, And smile in its beauty thy threshold beside, Bright symbol! sweet lady! of âHeart's-ease within!â A VISION. Long ere my senses slept last night, Bathed in the moon-beam's tremulous flame; Soft to my heart, a thing of light, A wild and winged vision came. A visionâlike a downy dove, It fanned me with its fragrant wings, Till lulled, as by the lip of love, I slept 'mid fair imaginings. Ah! even then it would not part, But nestled softly in my heart; And sang to me the livelong night A low sweet song of calm delight. THE LITTLE SLUMBERER. The child was weary, and had flung herself In beautiful abandonment, to rest, Low on the gorgeous carpeting, whose hues Contrasted richly with her snow-white robe: One dimpled arm lay curving o'er the head, Half buried in its glossy, golden curls, Moist and disordered by her graceful play; The other pressed beneath her cheek, did make With small round fingers dimples in the rose,â Where lashes soft as floss were darkly drooping,â Her red lips parted slightly, while the breath, Pure as a blossom's sigh, came sweet and still; Loosely the robe from one white shoulder fell; And so she lay, and slumbered 'mid the hues, The orient richness of the downy carpet,â Like a young flower, drooping its dewy head, And shutting its soft petals on the breast Of summer-mantled earth. AN EPISTLE From little Ellen to her Friend Mary,âwith a Christmas Gift. This morning, dear, I sent mamma, (Too busy I to go so far,) To find a doll as bright and pleasant, As her for whom was meant the present;â Now guess her name!âa charming child, As e'er on life's rough changes smiled! You cannot guess? ah! when you know For whom, mamma, I lessoned so, You'll say it was a hard embassy;â 'Twas Mary's selfâmy winsome lassie! In truth she might have searched the world, To match, in dolls, your speaking face,â Your eyes,âyour hair so richly curled,â Your radiant smile,âyour restless grace! And I, I own, was rather stupid, To think she'd find a waxen Cupid; So, as she did her best, I told her, I couldn't have the heart to scold her. Then take the babyâwill you, love? She'll be as quiet as a dove; And, with her, take the kiss I print, Upon her lip of rosy tint; But oh! be sure you do not press Too fondly there your sweet caress, Lest your own lovely mouth be tainted, For 'tween ourselves I fearâshe's painted! What pity that our modern belles Are not content with Nature's pallette; But steal their blush from carmine shells! It shan't be our rose-maker,âshall it? Yet take the doll,âand while you gaze Upon her eyes of beaming blue, And twist her golden hair all ways, Except the right,âyou fidget! you! And pinch her little harmless nose, And seek in vain her tiny toes,â Remember, she must not be pressed Too closely to that baby-breast; For she has such a melting way, When touched by love in such excess, She'd faint,ânay more!âI've heard them say, She'd die to show her tenderness! And oh! in all your mirthful dealings, Be careful not to hurt her feelings; So sensitive her nature is, That if you only touch her phiz Too roughly with that finger fair, 'Twill make a deep impression there. Oh! clasp her gently in thine arms, And sing to rest her smiling charms; And doff and don her pretty clothes, And lightly tie her little bonnet; And press her lip that softly glows, To find the kiss I printed on it: And then, when, weary of thy play, Thy cradle-pillow wooes to sleep,â While viewless cherubs pure and gay, As thou, their vigil o'er thee keep,â Sweet Mary, let poor Dolly lie Beside thee, in thy downy dwelling, And thou wilt dream that it is I, And call the waxen babyââEllen!â POSTSCRIPT. Now then as we've disposed of Dolly, Since postscripts are the cream of letters, A truce to all this babyish folly, And let us talk of graver matters. When next you climb your mother's knee, Give her a long, sweet kiss from me; My love, too, to your father, dear; And tell them both my warmest wishes, That Christmas-day may bring them cheer, In pleasant friends, and tempting dishes. If mine but knew that I was writing, They'd send, I'm sure, a pretty message; But one a story is inditing, And t'other sees some portraits presage In âhis mind's eye,â and heeds not now His daughter's cogitating brow. I often hear them speak of you And your mamma.âTo-day, at dinner, Papa exclaimed,ââNow, Fanny, do Write to that charming Mrs. Skinner!â Mamma began to frown and pout, I thought her manner quite alarming; At last the reason faltered out,â âI willâif you wont call her charming!â To tell the truth,â(you'll not betray?) I hate to see a jealous woman; As if e'en Beauty's faintest ray Should fall upon a heart that's human, Without awaking grateful love To Beauty's Author throned above! For me,âI would not give a groat For any one, who had not taste And soul enough to feel and note Where Loveliness her shrine has placed. For instance, love, they often say, That you are brighter far than I, Far more intelligent and gay, With stronger frame and lustier cry; They say your silken hair can curl, Your feet can tottle round the room, Your mouth is filled with teeth of pearl, Your cheek is rich with healthful bloom! My hair's as straight as sunbeams,ânay, 'Tis worse, for even when 'tis wet, It's not refracted like the ray, But only more refractory yet! My head's a hopeless case, my dear, My cheeks still wear the lily's hue, My feet wern't made to walk I fear, And as for teeth I've onlyâtwo! But I should think as soon of crying, Because yon star mine eye out-smiled, Or roses mocked my lip,âas sighing, When you are called a lovelier child! No!âif, when I'm grown up a lady, My husband talks of Mary Skinner, No frown shall make my forehead shady, No envious pang shall spoil my dinner! But, dearest, as I promised âcream,â I should have made my postscript shorter; So lengthened,âafter all 'twill seem, That flattest beverageâmilk and water! But one word more.âWhen left alone, And half awake within your crib, Do you not sometimes hear a tone,â (I hope you never tell a fib!) A silvery tone, closeâclose above you? As if some warbling cherub-child Had stolen from heaven to see and love you? And have you not in rapture smiled, And talked in whispers sweet and low, About your play,âyour griefs and joys,â And begged the baby not to go,â And promised it your prettiest toys? I have,âI often do.âMamma Thinks all young children thus are blest,â That infant-angels come from far, To watch and share their guileless rest. And, Mary, when again I hear My spirit-playmate's accent clear, And see again the wavy gleam Of golden ringlets in my dream,â I'll tell the angel-child of you; And pressing on its lips of dew A loving kiss, I'll bid it fly To where you in your beauty lie, And bring me, in another trip, A message from your own sweet lip! Now thenâgood bye! my precious Mary! I'm sure my next rhyme wont come well in; But you'll forgive a bard's vagary, And not forget your little Ellen! THE MAIDEN WITH HER ABSENT LOVER'S PORTRAIT. Why did he paint them to the life, The lip, the brow, the eye? Yet fail to make them warmly rife, Like thine with feeling high. Are these the lips that thrilled to mine? Is this the forehead bland? Is this the hair I used to twine With fond and frolic hand? Is this the cheek I loved to touch? Are these the eyes of blue? Whose very colour told how much Of Heaven the spirit knew. Alas! the hueâthe shapeâthe airâ Are truly told, I know; The waving of the deep brown hairâ The arching of the brow.â But where's the soul-beam, soft and bright, That so illumined them; The smile, worth all the jewel-light Of regal diadem. Ah! plaint like this the painter wrongs, Beyond his weak control; Only to those thou lov'st belongs, The language of thy soul! I could not prize thee half so much, If all were blessed by thee, With smiles of hallowed meaningâsuch As those thou giv'st to me! TO A LADY, Who consulted the Author about trimming her Bonnet with a Bow behind. Oh! wreathe the ribbon lightly round, And tie it 'neath your chin, And do not let its folds be bound By needle or by pin! It is unworthy, lady dear, Your dignity of mind, To take such trouble with your gear, To have a bow behind! Of all your virtues rare and bright The rarest seemed to me; Your scorn of trifles vain and light, Your fair simplicity. How was that cherished thought to-day, With many a sigh resigned; When, horror struck, I heard you say, You liked a bow behind! Besides, 'tis so unclassical, You love the taste, I'm sure, Which draped with graceful fold and fall Italia's child of yore. The rich, severe simplicity! The dignifiedârefined! How had the Roman matron scorned That petty bow behind! A bow! a light, unmeaning bow! A vain and useless thing! The veriest trifle here below! Oh! take it for a string! Consult your husband, lady, pray! He has a Roman mindâ And, like a dear good man, he'll say,â âDeuce take the bow behind!â LINES ON A POETESS, Who was advised to write less rapidly. Her muse is like the bird that roves Through Eastern India's fragrant groves; His trembling plumage burns in flightâ A living rainbow, rare and bright! And swifter as those pinions fly, More warm the glow, more rich the dye; But when with slow and measured wave They fall upon the balmy air, The hues his lightning-motion gave Grow dim, and fade unnoticed there. And when he furls those changeful wings, All wearied with his glorious play, Ah! one by one the shining rings Of radiant colour die away! And dark and dull, you ne'er would know The wealth of glory lost below; That every shadowy plume you see, Still wears its own resplendent hue; And once again, unfurled and free, Would flash its treasure on your view. Her muse is like the sunlit bird,â Then bid her not its wanderings stay, Lest all the light that flight has stirredâ Like hisâin rest should die away. THE OMEN. A book of birds before me lay, And half in childlike faith, and half in play, I said, whatever bird on opening it I see, Shall Ellen's emblem be. I opened to the Turtledove! Oh! blessed promise of pure truth and love; Surely on that fond faith kind Heaven indulgent smiled, Be thou the Dove, my child! IF HE CAN! A SONG. Let me see him once more For a moment or two, Let him tell me himself Of his purpose, dear, do; Let him gaze in these eyes While he lays out his plan To escape me,âand thenâ He may goâif he can! Let me see him once more, Let me give him one smile, Let me breathe but one word Of endearment the while; I ask but that momentâ My life on the man! Does he think to forget me? He mayâif he can! EPIGRAM. âI'll cut your acquaintance,â said Harry to John, In a furious passion, âif thus you go on!â âTo cut my acquaintance,â said John, âyou are free,â âCut them all, if you please, so you do not cut me!â A POET'S EXCUSE FOR SHUTTING HIS EYES IN THE PRESENCE OF A BEAUTIFUL GIRL. The miser hoards with jealous care The gleaming gold he starves to win; The diver hides his jewel rare, With joy, his homely vest within. And art not thou a gem divine, Far worthier of an idol's place? Ah! when these eyes could once enshrine Thy graceful form, thy glowing face,â When they in one impassioned gaze Thy wealth of beauty wildly stole, And let its glorious image blaze Like sunlight on my startled soul;â Say, is it strange that they should close, Exulting o'er their radiant treasure,â Content to dwell in dim repose, And feel the miser's trembling pleasure? No! since I've risked my heart to win One impress of a gem so rare, Oh! let me gaze on it within, And starve my eyes to keep it there! LINES ON THE BURNING OF THE ROYAL EXCHANGE. All hush'd in the moonlight, the city lay sleeping, Tower, Temple, and Palace, were bathed in her beams; Only sorrow and guilt were awaking and weeping, When the watchman's deep cry broke the slumberer's dreams. âFire! Fire!â 'tis a sound ever sad to the feeling, But oh! how terrific, how thrillingly grand, In the depth of that midnight, when Winter was stealing Unheard, with his fetters of ice, o'er the land! âFire! Fire!ââit is raging in fierce exultation, All reckless and tameless,âyour efforts are vain! Lo! it laughs at your labour in triumph's elation, And now, with fresh fury, it rises again! And the roar of the elements meeting in madnessâ The crash of vast timbers, that blaze as they fallâ The rushing of thousands, in terror and sadnessâ Are sounds that the mightiest heart would appal! Lo! the river, that drank in the moonlight erewhile, Now beams back the blaze of the flame-spirit's eye, Flushing fitfully up in the light of his smile, While he points, in his demon-delight, to the sky! All clear and serene in its purity, beaming, Night's amber-hued jewel floats tranquilly there, As an icicle cold and transparent in seeming, Undimm'd by the smoke, and unchang'd by the glare Pour on the swift waters!âas well might ye strive To check with a dewdrop the lightning's fierce play, For the flames in their reckless resolve seem aliveâ And look! the proud tower to their fury gives way! They have stol'n where sculptured in marble sublimely The island kings stood in majestic repose,â Oh! blasted for ever by ruin untimelyâ The wreck of their grandeur the conqueror shows E'en the emblem of Time to their might doth surrender,â Their mad work is finished invisibly there; And now, in new triumph and wild blazing splendor, They rise where the music bells sleep in the air. Hush! hark!âhath a pitying spirit from Heaven Stol'n down to mourn over the smouldering pile? Wild, plaintive, and soft, is that melody given, The throng's deep emotion to soothe and beguile. Ah, no! 'tis the last hallowed chime of those bells, That will gladden no longer your hearts with their peal; Even now, as more gaily the loved music swells, The destroyer upon them doth rapidly steal. And lo! with a crash of strange discord they fall, And the conqueror, weary of ruin and woe, Disappears, leaving clouds of dense smoke, like a pall, O'er the scene where the pride of the city lies low! MAY'S FELLOW-TRAVELLER. A rainbow descends, softly winging, Through tears and through tempests, its way; And Hope, like the ark-dove, is springing To welcome the coming of May! Her young smile will lighten through Heaven, Her blushes our bowers will illume, And the cloud by that beam will be riven, And the rose drink that blush till it bloom. But not for the sun-burst on high, And not for the rose-tinting ray, But for something far holier, I Will bless the sweet coming of May. She will steal into shadowed recesses, Where the timid young violet lies, Till it wake to her playful caresses, And wink 'neath her dazzling blue eyes. She will laugh by the beautiful river, By the fountain, the lake, and the brook, Till freer and brighter than ever They flow in the light of her look. She will whisper within the green woods, Till the birds catch her tones, and rejoice; And the holy and far solitudes Shall echo her musical voice. But not for all warblers that fly, And not for the free waters' play, Nor the violet's soft azure eye, Will I welcome the coming of May. There's a smile, that is truer and sweeter, There are eyes, as deep blue as her own, There's a stepâa loved stepâthat is fleeter, There's a dearer and tenderer tone!â Theyâthey will come with her,âand lo! From the depth of my heart's winter-gloom, Like flowers 'neath the sky's sunny glow, Bright feelings will spring into bloom. A rainbow descends, softly winging, Through tears and through tempests, its way; And Hope, like the ark-dove, is springing To welcome the coming of May! THE THREE VICTORIES.âA SONG. A smile was struggling with a tear, In Mary's eye of truth; In Mary's heart were Love and Fear, At Mary's feetâa youth! The tear-drop in a dimple fell, And 'mid her blush expired; Love lessoned Fear so sweetly well, She curtsied, and retired. Then beamed the victor-smile of light, Gay Love the world defied,â And proudly to the church that night The brave youth bore his bride!

Beautiful! beautiful! Passion is stilled, Meeting thy blessed eyes, Happy Matilde! All who behold theeâ The weary, the sadâ Yield to thy loveliness, Loving and glad. Joy, like the zephyr That flies o'er the flower, Rippling it into Fresh fairness each hour,â Waves o'er thy beauty His sun-woven wing, And dimples thy cheek Like the roses of Spring. It is not the rapture, The fitful and wild, That dies in a moment, Thou shadowless child. Over thy spirit, Over thy brow, Still will those pinions wave Ever as now. Within theeâaroundâ Shedding influence bright,â An atmosphere, fairest, Of sunny delight. Unclouded by Sin, And by Sorrow unchilled, It was born with thy being, My merry Matilde! Soft as a wreathing cloud, Free as the air, Falls from thy forehead Thy beautiful hair. And Thought, like the glory Through morning-mist seen, Shines through that forehead A spirit serene. They tell me, blest cherub, That tears never rise,â Never dim for a moment Thy melting, dark eyes! That the spirit of Joy, When those orbs were revealed, Flew there with a smile, And the tear-fountain sealed. But it seems to me, sweet, That a tear and a smile, Are struggling for ever Within them the while. And brightly they tremble, And tenderly too, As blend on the blossom The starlight and dew. Ah! Love knew the radiance Joy kept revealing, Would die, unless bathed In the fountain of Feeling! And the flashing ray floated More soft than before, When he broke the light seal, And the warm tears ran o'er. But they love their bright home, And they never dare flow, Lest they fall in the dimples That frolic below. Ah! always as now May that tender light gild Thy tears as they tremble, My tender Matilde! BLANK VERSE. A would-be poet wooed the muse in vain, Then showed the page his pen refused to stain; But to my wondering query answered terse,â âWhy do you stare? I only tried blank verse!â THE DOOMED. Ay! doomed indeed to worse than death, To teach those sweet lips hourly guile; To breathe thro' life but Falsehood's breath, And smile with Falsehood's smile. To kneel before that holy shrine, Where only Truth should dare appear, And clasp a hated hand in thine, In silent shame and fear. To speak that vow, with impious art, Which binds thee ever, solely his, While in thy shut and silent heart, A dearer image is! To wear within the poison-sting Of conscious wrong, that never dies; And tremble, like a guilty thing, Before Affection's eyes! To meet a husband's hallowed touch, Nor dare, yet long to shrink aside, To hateâto scorn thyself so much, Thou loath'st the world beside! TO MISS B???S. If Rumour tell the truth, fair girl! Ere winter-tempests lower, Thou'lt wreathe, thro' glossy braid and curl, A fragrant, snow-white flower;â And o'er thy dark and drooping eyes, Thy cheek's transparent glow, Where dimpled roses richly rise, A shining veil shall flow. How fair the orange-bloom will smile Amid that auburn braid! How soft will burn thy blush the while, Beneath the bridal-shade! Thou'rt young to wed!âthat virgin flower, White as thine own pure brow, Just stolen from its dewy bower, Is not more fresh than thou. Thou'rt young to wear the bridal-bloom, Yet go! for in thy heart, A lovelier blossom lights the gloom, That timid fears impart. The heaven-fed flower of Purity, Oh! nurse the snow-drop still; And in its breath a charm shall be, To guard thee from all ill. LINES ON PERUSING THE DRAMATIC WORKS OF JAMES SHERIDAN KNOWLES. He sports with a sentiment rich and rare, As the subtle Jew with a diamond plays, In the sunny light of his Fancy fair, He shifts his treasure a thousand ways: And the princely gem as swift it turns, With a lovelier glory beams and burns. The sun-beam searches the Diamond's heart, What wealth of beauty illumed is seen! Its gorgeous colours like lightning dart, As if Iris were veiled in its dazzling sheen, And fluttered her pinions of rainbow-light, In pride at a prison so pure and bright. Oh! the selfsame gem in an idler's mind, With a taste and skill less rare than his, Would lie as changeless and undefined, As the Diamond dim in the shadow is, And none would dream of the sparkling play Of those plumes within, that folded lay! ON A PICTURE, Representing a maiden with a pair of scales, and Love with a butterfly; the winged boy rises, as he should, and the motto beneath is,ââLove is the lightest!â Silly maiden, weigh them not! Butterflies are earthly things; Thou forgett'st their lowly lot, Gazing on their glittering wings. Rather weigh thy taper pale With the light by Luna given; Will the heaven-ray turn the scale? Will the earth-lamp rise to heaven? Love,âethereal, holy Love! Buoyant, joyous, proud, and free, Maiden, see! he soars above Worldly Pride and Vanity! Rightly to its native earth Sinks the gilded insect-fly; Loveâof holier, heavenlier birthâ Rises tow'rds his home on high! Maiden! throw the scales away, Never weigh poor Love again; Let his pinions freely play, Bind him not with vassal-chain! See! he lifts his wondering eye Half reproachfully to thee;â Measured with a butterfly! I'd take wing if I were he! If he must be proved and tried, Weigh him in thine own true heart, 'Gainst a frowning world beside,â Wealth and rank 'gainst bow and dart!â If he do not scorn the measure, Soaring high o'er them and thee,â Worth the world and worldly treasure,â Mark me! Love outweighs the three! ON THE SAME.âTO CUPID IN THE SCALES. Where are your wings and your will, Love? How can you be such a dunce? Why do you keep them so still, Love? Why dont you use them at once? Pray tell me what they were made for, If not to fly from a chain? What do you stay to be weighed for? Talk not of Freedom again! Sitting so tame and so quiet, Just like a dove in its nest; Why dont you kick up a riot? Where is the pride of your breast? Mount, Love, the back of the butterfly, Leave the light girl to her doom, Off to the clouds, and let not a fly Thus his frail earth-pinions plume! Spirit of Joy and of Passion, Plumed with the beams of the sun! Weighed in so worldly a fashion, Just for an idle maid's fun! Beat by a butterfly hollow, Tried by an insect so low, While the proud fire of Apollo Bright in thy bosom doth glow! Spurn the false scales to the deuce, Love, Laugh the cold maiden to scorn, Punish so saucy a âruse,â Love, Leave her alone and forlorn! A LOVER'S SIMILE. Mine eye is but a burning glass, Wherein your smile's too fatal rays Brought to a focus, setâalas! My poor heart in a blaze! SONG OF THE SPOILED BEAUTY. FROM AN UNPUBLISHED PLAY. Though you wreathe in my raven hair jewels the rarest, That ever illumined the brow of a queen, I should think the least one that were wanting the fairest, And pout at their lustre in petulant spleen; Though the Diamond should lighten there, regal in splendour, The Topaz its sunny glow shed o'er the curl, And the Emerald's ray tremble, timid and tender, If the Pearl be not by,âI should sigh for the Pearl! Tho' you fling at my feet all the loveliest flowers, That Summer is waking in forest and field, I should pine 'mid the bloom you had brought from her bowers, For some little blossom Spring only could yield: Take the Rose with its passionate beauty and bloom, love, The Lily so pure, and the Tulip so bright; Since I miss the sweet Violet's lowly perfume, love, The Violet only my soul can delight! THE HERO'S DEATH. FROM THE SAME. War's clarion calls to arms! âTo horseâto horse,â he cries; âHush, ladye-love, thy wild alarms!â Away his charger flies! Where fiercest flows the flight, His snow-white plume waves high; All's lost, his comrades turn for flight, He stands his groundâto die.â To die!âthat blow struck homeâ Yet, yet he braves the foe! âA rescue!â hark! they come! they come! But the snow-white plume lies low! LAND HO! OR THE SHIP IN PORT. FROM THE SAME. My heart has been the plaything, love, of woman, like a ship, That every fickle wandering gale may toss about at will; Now wooed to hidden danger, by the south wind's wanton lip, Now shivering in the northern gale, with fever-fit, and chill. But escaped from syren treachery, it has found a haven at last, Where the whirlpool cannot lure to death, nor breakers lash its rails; By thy dear side the pilot Love has moored it safe and fast, Dropped anchor at thy fairy feet, and furled its flying sails! THE BELLE'S CONSOLATION. FROM THE SAME. Is he false? then I am free! I pledged my troth to Taste and Sense; Since these he's lost, he'll e'en lose me; So tell him, girl, and bid him hence! Ne'er heart of mine shall break for Love; Come, Wealth! and woo a willing bride! I'll treat the truant like my glove, Too easy grownâ'tis thrown aside,â I throw it by, and buy another; If loose that setsâI set it free; Cupid no more my heart shall bother, For Wealth can win as well as he. Is he false? then I am free! He vowed he followed Beauty's banners; Since these he's lost in losing me, Heaven help the youthâand mend his manners! THE INFANT ELLEN'S LETTER FROM ENGLAND, TO HER COUSIN ANNA (SIX YEARS OF AGE) IN AMERICA. They tell me, love, that far away, Beyond the unfathomed tide, I have a little friend at play, My grandsire's knee beside. They bid me call her âcousin,ââdear, Her name is Anna Wells; And many a pretty tale of her, My loving mother tells. She says, her lip is like a rose, Her eye a gem of light, Her cheek such changing colour shows, As veils the morning bright. That o'er a forehead fair and mild Her soft brown hair is parted, And she's a pleasant, playful child, A bright and happy-hearted. Of one thing, I am certain, dear, This dark-eyed coz must be A lovely one, for oft I hear That she resembles me. And IâI do assure you, sweet, Am quite a perfect creature,â Such dainty hands! such cunning feet! Such grace of form and feature! Rich, violet eyes and auburn hair, A soft and pure complexion; And then, the lovely clothes I wear! They fit me to perfection. I fear you'll think me very vain, But, really, when I hear My father talk in such a strain, How can I help it, dear? Sometimes, when in my cradle, I, In meditation meek, Allow my silken lash to lie Demurely on my cheek,â He thinks that I am fast asleep, And bids mamma come near; While such a sober face I keep He does not dream I hear.â âShe's really very beautiful,ââ This morn he whispering said,â âHow gracefully upon her breast âThose tiny hands are laid! âThere's mind already on that brow, âHow bright the child is growing! âWhy, one would think she heard me now, âShe looks so very knowing! âWould you believe it?âyesterday âI chanced to breathe a sigh,â âShe looked directly in my face âAnd then began to cry! âHer reasoning powers are very strong, âBehold that bump!ââhe saidâ (Dont tell! it was a bump I got When mother knocked my head.) Not he alone, but others, while My fond papa is by, Declare I have the sweetest smile, The loveliest lip and eye! They kiss, they hug, they toss me up, And do make such a pother,â âThe pretty little darling dear! âThe image of her mother!â But if papa but turns his eye, Or leaves me in their arms, Why, in their arms they let me lie, Unheeding then my charms. Ah! cousin dear, Experience Has taught me how to prize The flattery of the faithless crowd, Who laud my lips and eyes; And I have learned, with stoic smile And brow serene, to hear, Whene'er they choose to praise and pet âThe little darling dear.â But these are trifles; I have woes, 'Twill grieve thy loving heart To hear,âand in those radiant eyes The pitying tear will start! Then listen, love, but breathe it not!â I would not, that the gay And heartless world should know my lot,â And thou wilt not betray? In truth, to others' eyes, I seem A tranquil child, and blest, And none, not e'en mamma, doth dream The sorrows of my breast! The cheek may glow, the eye may smile, The lips in laughter part, While coldly, 'neath them all the while, Slow throbs the suffering heart! And firstâ(I know the child is blamed, Who e'er a parent blames;â But who such trial tamely bears?) My father calls me names! Last night, he dipped me, head and all, The naughty, cruel man! And just because I chanced to fall He called me âPitchapan!â And then, when struggling for my food, (I'd been three hours without,) And could not find it quick enough, 'Twas little âBobabout!â Mamma, too, when she takes me up, To fondle me, begins And calls me âcherub,â âsnow-drop,â âstar!â I can't think what she means! What is a star?âdo you know, love? This morn, when on mamma I smiled,âthe nurse exclaimed, âShe's woke As smiling as a star!â This is not all,âwhenever I (I can't do well without it,) Think to enjoy a quiet cry, There's such a fuss about it! The âluxury of tears,â we all Have read in poets' dreams, 'Tis left for babes like us to tell The luxury of âscreams.â But scarce do hapless I begin, Than all are crowding round me, And pull and push to find the pin, With which my nurse has bound me! Yet, when the pin does really prick, And I begin to whimper, To cry and struggle, scream and kick, 'TisââGoodness! What a temper!â Ah! should I pain that gentle breast, With all my infant troubles, You'd own that hope's a dream at best, And pleasures are but bubbles! E'en now to think of all my woe, My baby heart is swelling; But you will sympathise, I know, And love your cousin, Ellen. P. S. And, dearest, when again you play Beside our grandpa's knee, Remember one who's far away, And talk to him of me! LITTLE ELLEN'S REPLY TO HER COUSIN. Your letter came safely, dear Anna, And much I'm indebted to thee For the graceful and delicate manner In which it comments upon me. But your pardon, sweet coz, if I ask you Who wrote an epistle so fine? I'm sorry so closely to task you, But really some parts are divine. Dont imagine I doubt your own power To perpetrate verses sublime; I dare say you rhyme by the hour, With many a musical chime. But steep is the path up Parnassus, And long for steps tiny as ours; And feet more experienced pass us, While we at its foot gather flowers. I am sure we should stumble alone, And I should like to know who helped thee; I am perfectly willing to own That my own dear mamma aided me. But as to your wish, love, of holding So bouncing a baby as I, My form in those fond arms enfolding,â Some morning I'll just let you try. They say you are slight as a fairy,â I'm strong, and a bit of a shrew; Now you dear little thing, light and airy, Pray dont you think I could hold you? But if you're inclined for a frolic, My own little cousin, with me, Some morning when I'm melancholic, I'll take a trip over the sea;â I'll wear my best frock and blue band, I'll curl up my hair over night, I'll clasp my sweet bells in my hand, To tinkle me tunes in my flight; I'll climb to thy knee for my throne, love, I'll nestle my head on thy breast, I'll lay my light hand in thine own, love, I'll pinch theeâbut only in jest; I'll wreathe round my rosy-tipped fingers Thy ringlets of silk with delight; But my hand's apt to pull where it lingersâ Would you weep if I pulled them too tight? Upon thy soft shoulder reposing, I'll give thee sweet kisses and light; But my lips have a sad trick of closingâ Shall you scold if I happen to bite? I dont know what mother will say, When she looks, and in vain, all about, To find her young âstarâ flown away,â She will fancy that I am âput out!â Oh! I did as you told me last night, I stole to the edge of the bed, And I peeped through a pin-hole so slight, 'Twas âa bird's-eye view,â you'd have said; âI'm sure I can't think where they are, These glittering creatures,â thought I, âIn the sky I must look for the star, But where must I look for the sky? There's something that's shining like fire On mother's work-table, close by, But it cannot be what I desire, For it is not so pretty as I.â At last, I looked up into Heaven, (I know where that is from mamma,) And I saw a blue curtain unriven, But not the least sign of a star. Yet I think, dearest, that was the curtain You bade me so slyly peep through, For of this I am perfectly certain, That as I was watching its hue, I suddenly saw a bright face Peeping out of a little loophole; And the very next moment, no trace Was left of it, love, on my soul! But again it appeared, with a smile So beaming with heavenly glee, So loving and lovely the while, I am sure it was looking at me! I imagine it must have been one Of those bright little cherubs, you know, Who with Heaven's messages run, On their winged feet of light, to and fro; I dont think it could be a star,â However, I mean to ask mother; How funny for two little stars To be playing âbopeepâ with each other! Mamma bids me say, though I warn her That I shall take up the whole space, She has still in her heart a warm corner For dear cousin Anna's bright face. But I shan't let you have it, my darling! Lest, looking your lodgings about, You should see me, and cry, like Sterne's starling, What's that? âlet me out! let me out!â I assure you, I'm fierce as a hero, I fight with my hands and my feet; I'm quite as relentless as Nero, (You've read of that gentleman, sweet?) But if you will change places with me, And let me have your mother's heart, Perhaps mine would let me go free,â Ah, no! it would kill us to part! Hark! I hear her quick step on the stair, She would scold should my pen meet her view; I must put on an innocent air;â My sweet correspondent, adieu! Give my love to each uncle, aunt, cousin, That cares for me, dearest, I pray; I hear I have them by the dozen, âCui bonoââso far, far away? And give to my darling grandma, love, And grandpa, whom mother loves so;â Fond kisses, just such as âa star,â love, Would be apt on a friend to bestow. Alas! these farewells make me sigh, They are things to be sad and to sob about, But it must be,âmy cousin, good bye! Your own little Pitchapan Bobabout. P. S. You've a brother, named Willie, Has he heard of his cousin afar? Dont think me coquettish and silly,â Once more, your affectionate THE ABSENT MOTHER'S PORTRAIT. I marvel not her pleasant face so sweet a smile doth wear, Her only son was in her heart when she was pictured there;â She fancied how, with tearful eyes and quivering lip, the while, He'd gaze upon the welcome prize, and kiss that lovely smile! Oh! never with the portrait part, while life and sense are thine! 'Twill prove a guardian to thy heart, through Fortune's shade and shine; Thou couldst not find in fairy realms an amulet or spell, Would hallow thee from grief and sin so faithfully and well! For while those eyes are on thee still, to smile when thou art blest, And fill with tears, or seem to fill, when Sorrow is thy guest, To glance a glad approval down on noble thought and deed, Or change to mournful tenderness, if Error should mislead, My life on itâno word, which thou wouldst blush to have her hear, Will stain thy lipâno reckless act will cause her heart a tear! No! holy Honour, fearless Truth, and Purity, will raise, To that beloved and loving face, a fond and fearless gaze. When friends around thy festal board in social mirth are met, And pledging theeâtheir generous hostâthe laughing lip is wet, Then will the love-charm work, I ween,âfor oh! the cup that's quaffed, Where soft her hallowed semblance glows, will not be filled too oft! Ah, no! no queen of fairy land could lend thee charm or spell, Would guard thee from all grief and sin so faithfully and well! Well may'st thou prize the portrait, and blest indeed is she Whose son has chosen a mother's form for household deity! TO EMMA A?. I shall not soon forget thee, with thy dark and flashing eye, And the pretty little haughty head thou carriest so high, With thy throat, whose swan-like curve is the loveliest I have seen, And the spirit and the grace of thy merry maiden-mien. I shall not soon forget thee, with thy smile's bewildering charm, With thy snow-white dimpled hand, and thy softly-rounded arm; With thy form of fairy moulding, so perfect, yet petite, And the light and restless movements of thy dainty little feet. I do not think I ever shall forget thee! for thine art Of bewitching all about thee has entangled half my heart; I am sure I never shall forget the kind and gentle thought Which prompted the fair offering those tiny fingers wrought. It is treasured in a memory where friendly deeds of yore And loving words I've hoarded, as a miser hoards his store; And when the rosy lustre of thy starlike gift is past, And the rich, soft gloss upon it now is worn away at last, The memory of thy kindness shall be fresh and fair as ever, And bright within my soul shall be the image of the giver! WRITTEN IN RUTH'S ALBUM. What's in a name? the merry minstrel asksâ An idle questionâidler my reply,â And vain,âfor who his plodding brain that tasks, Can the bard's comment on those words deny? The flower and thou would seem as sweet, in sooth, Without the lovely names of Rose and Ruth. Yet feel I well there is a charm in thine, Tender and soft, as it is plain and short, So will I rhyme it with my simple line, And thus upon the laughing bard retort. Devoted constancy, and faith, and truth, Dwell with that syllable of sweetnessââRuth.â Oh! who can hear it, and remember not That lovely story of the olden-time, Of her who joined her own fair blooming lot With the sad wanderer's of the eastern clime; Forgetting home, and hope, and love, and youth, At duty's call,âthe pure and patient Ruth! And who that looks on thee, can fail to own In thy dark, earnest eyesâthat all but speakâ And in the pleading witchery of thy tone, A tenderness like hers, as soft and meek, And feel, remembering her unfaltering truth, There's more than music in the name of Ruth? A PLEASANT DIVORCE. Kate's nose was retroussÃ©eâher husband's a Roman,â One day in a passion he bade her begone,â âWhich way?â said she,ââFollow your nose, silly woman!â He answered with pointed and petulant scorn. Kate laughed as she whispered,ââThe taunt is forgiven, It implies such a compliment, dearest, you know! I'll follow my nose, sir, with pleasureâto Heaven, If you'll follow yoursâto the regions below!â</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JUVENILE RHYMES. ADDRESS TO MY JUVENILE READERS. But few fleeting years have passed over my head, Since I too was playing in Youth's sunny bowers, And oh! with as free and as careless a tread, As ever chased butterfly over wild flowers! Reluctant was I the sweet limit to leave, That parts merry childhood from woman's sad lot; And now, half in sorrow, yet smiling, I weave A wreath from those scenes that are never forgot. Dear children, while chasing with soul-lighted smile The butterflyâFancyâmy posies amid, Remember some sweet little moral the while, In the heart of each blossom, like honey, is hid! Then take the light garland,â'twas woven for you; And say, while you cherish each simple âwild flower,ââ When critics more stern its construction would view,â âOh! breathe on it softly! it dies in an hour!â CHILDHOOD. Ah! well may sages bow to thee, Dear, loving, guileless Infancy! And sigh beside their lofty lore For one untaught delight of thine, And feel they'd give their Learning's store To know again thy truth divine. Ah! well may pampered Luxury, Aweary of his wasted wealth, Thy dearer treasures sigh to see,â Thy careless glee,âthy blooming health,â Thy frolic footstep, light and free,â Thy glowing smile, that far outshines The rosiest jewel of his mines! And well may eagle-Power look down, And scorn his eyrie and his crown! What though his gifted speech have stirred Some stoic's heart with eloquent prayer? From infant Innocenceâa word Will win its way as surely there, And the same fount of feeling, struck By his mind's magic from the rock, Will yield with willing flow, the while, To Childhood's voice and Childhood's smile! JACK FROST. A bright, little rogue jumped out of bed, With his cheek flushed warm,âand his moist, brown hair Curling and floating all over his head, As if Slumber had only been frolicking there. He sprang to the window in wild surprise, And a smile stole up to his deep blue eyes; For the glass was all wrought into landscapes white, As if formed of feathers of fleecy light! Willy knew by the tracery, strange and fair, That a queer little artist, called Frost, had been there, And he cried out, ('twas naughty to swear so!) âby Jindo! I know who it is that's been painting my window!â He thought he spied him outside of the paneâ That funny old manâwhen he looked again; With his twinkling eyes, keen, cold, and bright, His pallet of pearl, and pencil of light, His snow-feather pinions with moonbeams inlaid, And his three-cornered cap of a diamond made. He looked hard at Willy, as much as to say, âI would give my best icicle, only to play With your wild, bright hair, or your cheek's warm rose, Or to bite but the tip of your dear little nose!â And Will caught the meaning that lurk'd in his eye, And shook his rich curls, as he laughed in reply,â âNo, no! Mr. Frost! you may peep, if you please, Over the mountains and through the trees; You may float in the clouds, through the deep midnight, And play with your jewels of rainbow light; You may dance on the lake with your twinkling feet, Till it harden beneath themâa silver sheet; You may wave your wings o'er the woodland bloom, And sprinkle their sparkles amid the gloom, Till the whole wide forest, from giant-pine To baby-bush, with your snow-plumes shine! You may look on the rivulet murmuring by, Till you charm it to sleep with your clear, cold eye, And bid it forget its flowing; You may do what you will, and I shall not fear,â For I am determined you shan't come here;â Mother! how cold it is growing!â No, no! Mr. Frost! you may bite, if you please, The poor, little, shivering buds on the trees; You may dig, with the point of your cap, in the earth, Till you come to the place where the flowers have birth, And tell them they mustn't come up,âif they do, You'll pinch them all, till they're black and blue,â You may frighten the lilies and roses; You may bite the bushâthe vineâthe tree; But, Mr. Jack Frost! if you dare to bite me!â Mother! how cold my nose is!â No, no! Mr. Frost! you may eat the grass; You may try your teeth upon window glass, Since you must do some mischief or other; You may swallow the stream; and the deep, full sea, You thirsty old fellow, your drink may be! But, Jonathan Frost! you shall not eat me! Oh! give me my breakfast, mother!â The milk was lifted for Willy to sip; But he felt just then, on his soft, warm lip, A tiny touch from a hand of ice,â And he put it away from his mouth in a trice. What do you think he found in his cup? Shining and shivering, icy and bony,â The pert, little iceman, himself, peeped up,â Mr. Jonathan Frost, âin propria personÃ¦!â Willy lifted the bowl,âone draught he drew,â âAnd pray, Mr. Jack Frost! where are you? You needn't go diving and glancing about, As if you expected to slide yourself out!â Ah! Willy! he drained the sweet cup with delight! But when he had finished, he stared in affright!â He thought he should find him all snugly curl'd up, The poor little painter, within the deep cup; But no!âhe had vanished!âno trace was there! And Willy looked, vainly, to earth and to air;â âHe jumped from it while I was drinking, I know; Mother, dear mother, did you see him go? You're a coward, Jack Frost! and the next time I meet you, If you dare touch my breakfast,âyou see'f I dont eat you!â THE LITTLE HAND. We wandered sadly round the room,â We missed the voice's play, That warbled through our hours of gloom, And charmed the cloud away;â We missed the footstep, loved and light,â The tiny, twining hand,â The quick, arch smile, so wildly bright,â The brow, with beauty bland! We wandered sadly round the room,â No relic could we find, No toy of hers, to soothe our gloom,â She left not one behind! But look! there is a misty trace, Faint, undefined and broken, Of fingers, on the mirror's face,â A dear, though simple token! A cherub hand!âthe child we loved Had left its impress there, When first, by young Ambition moved, She climbed the easy-chair;â She saw her own sweet self, and tried To touch what seemed to be So near, so beautiful! and cried,â âWhy! there's another me!â Dear hand! though from the mirror's face Thy form did soon depart, I wore its welcome, tender trace, Long after, in my heart! HOPE'S RAINBOW. Fair Hope, with light and buoyant form, Came smiling through the clouds of Care, Glanced bright defiance on the storm, And hung her bow of promise there! THE STAR OF PROMISE. When kneeling sages saw, of yore, Their star of promise rise for them, How Learning's lamp grew dim before The heaven-born light of Bethlehem! How faltered Wisdom's haughty tone, When, led by God's exulting choir, His radiant herald glided onâ The darkling heathen's beacon-fire! When sweet, from many an angel voice, While rang the viewless harps of Heaven, He heard their song of loveââRejoice, For peace on earth, and sin forgiven!â The Chaldean flung his scroll aside, The Arab left his desert-tent, Their hopeâtheir trustâthat beaming guide, Till low at Mary's feet they bent!â Ay! Asia's wisest knelt around, Forgetting Fame's too earthly dream; While bright, upon the hallowed ground, Their golden giftsâa mockeryâgleam. There vainly too their censers breathed,â Oh! what were incense, gems, to Him, Around whose brow a glory wreathed, That made their day-star's splendour dim? To Him, o'er whose blest spirit came The fragrance of celestial flowers, Who saw the countless plumes of flame That play'd thro' Heaven's resplendent bowers? To kneeling Faith's devoted eye It shinesâthat Star of Promiseânow, Fair, as when far, in Asia's sky, It lit her sage's lifted brow! No sparkling treasure we may bring, Nor âgift of gold,â nor jewel-stone; The censer's sweets we may not fling, In incense, round our Saviour's throne;â But when, o'er Sorrow's clouded view, That planet rises to our prayer, We, where it leads, may follow too, And layâa contrite spirit there! LITTLE ANNA'S PICTURE. 'Tis but a pencil-sketch,âyet lovely still, And true as lovely! the rich mouth is there, The simple parting of the sun-brown hair, The large and lustrous eyes, all eloquent With their unchildlike, earnest look of thought, And the transparent fairness of the forehead! It is all Anna,âsave the faint rose-shade That trembles on her cheek, but in her lips Deepens to crimson,âand the tinge of gold, Revelling like a sunbeam 'mid her hair, While in those eyes, which wear the selfsame hue Of glossy brown, it melts to tender smiles! I would the picture could those colours wear, For in their contrast, half her beauty lies;â The chestnut richness of her drooping lash, Lying like silk upon that dimpled cheek, Makes the warm rose-tint softer with its shade. I would this little sketch those colours wore; But I've another portrait of the child, Wrought by a hand more powerful and true,â A portrait that will never fade, a hand Whose angel-skill is perfect and undying; There the brown hair on blue-veined temples rests, Just as it did on Anna's; the sweet lips Are as like hers, as hers are like a rose-bud; And the clear, beaming eyes, the colour wear With which her own are radiant!âIt is true,â For long ago, before our darling left us, Love drew her picture âin my heart of heart,â And Memory preserves it beautiful! THE BOY-PAINTER. âMy mother's kiss made me a painter!â Life of Sir Benjamin West. A little heart, where slept the germ, as yet in night concealed, Of power and glory since to be (how radiantly!) revealed, Alone, beside a cradle bed, was beating fast and warm, Where, beautiful in slumber, lay a baby's dimpled form! The infant smiled in sleep, and lo! a little, ardent hand, Ere fled the smile, had snatched a pen and paper from the stand, And traced the cradle and the babe, as if by magic spell,â How soft, beneath that tiny touch, the fairy features fell! How fondly o'er the playful sketch he bendsâthe enraptured boy! Unmindful of his precious charge, so deep his dream of joy; 'Tis broken by a stealing step,âhis mother caught the prize, And kissed away the cloud of doubt that filled his timid eyes! O blessed Love! how mighty thou to sway the human heart! A subtle, yet a holy king and conqueror thou art! His sister's smile awoke the germ,âhis mother's kiss, the flower,â And a world's tears, the fruit, embalm, in many a classic bower! THE TIME TO PRAY. âWhat is the lady doing there?â Louise, before a picture, cried; âThe lady kneels in holy prayer,â Her sister, Bell, replied. Louisa's eyes in musing fell,â âYou say the lady kneels in prayer,â To-day, you know, is Friday, Bell, And is it Sunday there?â âAh! dear Louise, can no one pray At any other time as well? Must Sunday be the only day?â Said thoughtful Isabel. âI should be very sad, if I, Who sorrow almost every day For something wrong, must wait and sigh, Till Sunday comes, to pray. âWhen I have erred, in deed or word, And tears arise, and blind my eye, My heart and lips with prayer are stirred, Till I forget to cry. âWhen lightly on my downy bed I wake and find the morning there, I think, whose smile the morning made, And speak to God in prayer. âWhen day's bright door is shut, I know Whose viewless hand forbids her beam, And dare not to my slumber go, Till I have prayed to Him! âAh! dear Louise! no matter where, No matter what the hour or day, The solemn eveâthe morning fairâ 'Tis always good to pray.â And young Louise said meekly then,â âIf kneeling lady any where I see, I will not ask again, If it is Sunday there.â ON SEEING AN ENGRAVING OF A SHIPWRECK. Ah me! I never see a scene like this, But o'er my heart a sudden shadow goes, A faint, but fearful vision of the storm, That wreck'd the darling of our household hearthâ My brother!âbeautiful, and good, and young! I was a child when he was lost at sea, And hardly knew the loss, or him remembered; But often since, in my lone hours of thought, I've had dim dreamings of a blue-eyed boy, Who watched and sometimes shared my pleasant play; And when swift gleams went by of waving hair, And brow of girlish softness, and a smile, Rich with heart-tenderness, and truth, and joy, I've felt that such were his, and blessed my dream. Then I recall his parting giftâa book,â It would be worth all others to me now!â Alas! 'twas lost before a week had flown; Yet with his last caress he bade me keep it, Till he should come,âhe never came again! Returning, and almost in sight of home, Already seen in Fancy,âhis young cheek Yet blest and warm with Love's imagined kiss, And his pure heart o'erflowing with sweet hopes, The ship went downâa shattered wreck,âand he!â That night his welcome-home was breathed in Heaven! REPLY TO A LETTER FROM AN ABSENT SISTER. Dear sister, if the world has aught, That wakens envy in my thought, It is the picture of myself, That hangs above your âlittle shelf.â You say it does not sympathize,â Alas! the cold and painted phiz, With silent lips and soulless eyes,â It does not know how blest it is! Unmoved it hears, what I would hear With beating heart and raptured ear; Untouched it sees, what I would see With loving looks and answering glee! It hears your blessed child address Its form with cherub tenderness; And, all unchanged, is callous too To words of sister-love from you! It hears her warbling voice prolong The notes of some impromptu song,â A merry bird, untaught by art, Singing the music in her heart; It hears the laughter, wild and soft, With which she cheers your sorrow oft; The prayer, that rises from her lips Like incense from the tender rose, Before her happy spirit slips Into its mantle of repose! It sees, her pretty, fairy feet, Glide in and out, with motion fleet, Or take, by true and graceful rule, The steps they learn at dancing-school! It sees her soft and serious eyes, Dilating into bright surprise, When some dear gift from grandpapa Reminds her of the friends afar! It seesâah! how much more than these, That dull, but favoured picture sees, Which I would give the world could be. One moment visible to me! Yes, sister, I do think of you, With tender sympathy and true, And almost wish my very self Could hang above that âlittle shelf.â THE CHILD'S DOUBT. âYou know you told me, mother dear, (How can I think it true?) That God can always see and hear Whate'er I say and do. âI listen, mother, for His voice, I look, His form to see; I see Him notâI hear Him not, Then how can He see me?â âMy child, you often tremble when The clouds are talking loud, And are you not afraid to hear His voice, who made the cloud? âAnd see! the sun is in the skies! Look up, with steadfast gaze,â You cannotâno! it hurts your eyes, Too strong the wondrous blaze;â âYet faint before the face of Him, That glory is a shade, Or at the best, a moment's gleam, His pitying glance has made!â âBut, mother, when the day is dark, When shadows dim the air, By radiant breakings through the cloud, I know the sun is there.â âMy child, the heavens, and earth, and air, Are darkness to His day, And all the glow of glory there, His love's attempered ray. âIn mercy to our senses weak, He shades His presence bright, In Nature's music veils His voice, And in her smile His light!â TO SEE THEE SMILE AGAIN. Dear Lizzie, when, in childhood's hour, Whate'er my laws, you would rebel, And I, who fancied age was power, Would feel my little bosom swell With anger infantine, because My mimic frown unheeded was, Our tiny tongues went very fast, And mineâmine always went the last! But when at length some childish jest Upon my pouting lip would rise, And wound my darling sister's breast, And fill with tears her dear, dark eyes,â Ashamed to own my fault to thee, Yet grieved in heart thy grief to see,â Rememberest thou how many a wile I tried, thy sorrow to beguile? Ah! even then I felt that Joy Must flee my spirit, thine in pain, And thought I'd give my prettiest toy To see thee smile again! Dear Lizzie, in maturer years, An angry word, or careless jest, Too often now distils the tears Of sorrow from thy gentle breast; Yet, love, believeâthy sister's heart, Whate'er its many errors be, Would never lightly pain impart, And least of all to thee! Oh! Passion's words are faithless things, And Love disowns them ere they fall; It is the reckless tongue that stingsâ The tongue that knows not Reason's thrall. Cold Satire's light and airy dart, Its point, its poison, there receives; And ere the weapon reach thy heart, My own has felt the wound it gives! And when I see thy dear lip curled, And quivering with thy just disdain, I sigh, and think I'd give the world To see thee smile again! EDWARD'S TRIAL. A TRUE STORY. A roguish elf is Ned, I ween, Five blooming years the boy has seen, Yet even now, his wily wit Far older lips would well befit. One day, as by the door he stands, He cries aloud, âMy father comes!â And clasps, in joy, his little hands; âHe's brought me home some sugar-plums!â For dearly loves the petted boy A sweetmeat, cake, or candied toy. The father entered,âput aside His hat and coat with quiet care, Then slow the packet's string untied, And laid its tempting treasures bare; With lips apart, th' impatient child, Delighted, eyed the feast, and smiled! And now his sire selects a plumâ The largest thereâwith aspect bland; On tiptoe, with expectance dumb, Ned reached his ready, dimpled hand; Mistaken boy!âslow rose the prize, Till in his father's mouth it vanished! And Ned beheld, with wondering eyes, And felt his fond confiding banished. But wilder, wider still they grewâ Those cloudless eyes,âas one by one, The sweets, in swift succession, flew Where fled the first, till half were gone! Poor Ned had half a mind to cry, And still another half to smile; So, with a sweet philosophy, He chose the happiest half the while, And lifting up his pleasant eyes, With glance demure, and sly, and wise, And wrinkling his soft brow of snow, Was not his self-command a virtue?) Said, in a tone of comic woe,â âDear father! I'm afraid they'll hurt you!â The father caught him to his breast, And on his lips fond kisses prest,â I'll warrant, Edward thought them sweet As any plum he e'er did eat! Yet whispered, with a smothered laugh,â âPray is it mineâthe other half?â âIt is!ââ'twas scarcely said before The boy had seized the precious store, And flew to find his sister Jane, To share with her his well-earned gain. Dear children, learn the moral,âMany a slip May be between the sugar and the lip; But he, the sugar never need to miss Who bears his loss with temper sweet as this! LITTLE CHARLIE'S PARADISE. Mamma, since Heaven's a place so fair, Why do we not our voyage begin? But shall I gather violets there, And will they let dear Rover in? ON A LITTLE OLD SHOE, SENT AS A MEASURE FOR A NEW PAIR. The trunk had come,âwe crowded round, With joy received our toys; The cap, âa gift for mother,â found, And bonbons for the boys. While father with a patient âhumâ The letters did unwrap, Sly Lizzie stole a sugar-plum, And mother kissed the cap! But one thing, more than all the rest, Did sweetly speak of you, And in my very heart I blessed Your little worn-out shoe! Was it your dancing shoe you sent,â A victim to the Graces? The very holes were eloquent, They gaped before our faces,â And spoke of restless joy, and in Our gladdened hearts we knew, How busy the dear foot had been, That wore that little shoe! They told of many an errand done, To please a mother kind; They told of childhood's âlove of fun,â They spoke an active mind. I've worn the helm a hero wore,â I've saved a sage's line,â And precious fragments from the shore Of glorious Greece are mine!â I've kissed the gems that decked the breast Of Europe's saddest queen; But ne'er was relic yet caressed, Like our old shoe I ween! The slipper Cinderella wore, So worshipped by her wooers, Was never prized or cherished more Than this dear one of yours! And when I'd read the letter o'er, And looked the papers through, And praised the cap,âI turned once more To kiss the little shoe! A CHILD'S THOUGHT ABOUT THE MOON. The child had seen the silver ring, Fair Dian floats in, filled with light, And tried to reach the radiant thing, And loved its smile, so softly bright. But now the wanderer, in her wane, Grew faint within that graceful car; And the child gazed on Heaven again, And saw the crescent shine afar! With plaintive voice, her thought was spoken, âOh dear! the pretty moon is broken!â A MOTHER'S WISH. âWhat shall I bring to thee, mother mine? What shall I bring to thee? Shall I bring thee jewels, that burn and shine In the depths of the darkling sea? âShall I bring the garland a hero wears, By a wondering world entwined, Whose leaves can cover a thousand cares, And smile o'er a clouded mind? âShall I bring the deep and sacred stores Of knowledge the high and free, That thrills the heart on the hallowed shores Of classic Italy?â âWhat are jewels, my boy, to me? Thou art the gem I prize! And the richest spot in that fearful sea Will be where thy vessel flies! âThe wreath the hero loves is won By the life-blood of the brave! And his brow must lose, ere it wear the crown, The smile that Mercy gave! âDearly earned is the volume's wealth That opes to the lamp of night, While the purer ray of Hope and Health Goes out by the sickly light! âBring me that innocent brow, my child, Bring me that eloquent eye, Bring me the tenderness, true and mild, That breathes in thy last good bye!â TO LITTLE FANNY,âWITH A NEW-YEAR'S GIFT. I will not wish thy coming year May pass unsullied by a tear; For well I know, in baby-eyes, Those pearly pleaders daily rise. I dare not hope thy lip of rose, May never curl with grief or scorn, For well I know this life has woes, Not e'en by babies to be borne. Nor would I idly quell thy hopes, Nor sing with raven note to thee; But Destiny her volume opes, And on the page thy name I see. It tellsâthy dearest toy will break! It tellsâthy prettiest dress will tear! It tells, alas! that thou wilt take A cold,âand cry for mother's care. That oft thou'lt sob thyself to sleep, No lullaby be nigh to soothe, And oft wilt wake to watch and weep, At parting day, or coming tooth. That sometimes thou wilt vainly play Thy Pat-a-cake,âor Peep-a-boo! While mother,âsister,âturn away Unheeding, from those eyes of blue. It darkly hints thy tiny feet That tottle proudly round the room, Some wrinkle in the rug may meet, And many a tumble be thy doom! Yes, these are ills that all must bear, And these are thine, devoted child! Yet 'mid them, dearest, calmly wear A stoic spirit, high and mild. And should thy sister, or thy brother, Cry o'er thy fall with mocking air; That's right! jump up, and take another,â Learn thou the martyr's lesson there,â The tumble and the taunt to meet With smile resigned, forbearing, sweet. Life's smoothest path has wrinkles too; And Pride, that deigns no downward look, Too oft, and ah! too late, must rue The fall it knows not how to brook! And now, one simple prayer be mine, To breathe for thee, my pretty pet!â That smiles more oft than tears may shine Beneath my giftâthe silken net; That all thy ways on earth may be Soft as that fireside rug to thee. As meekly gliding one by one, Pale through the glowing clouds of even, The stars peep forth at set of sun, And smile with tranquil light in Heaven,â So may thy little pearly teeth With soft and painless motion come, And starlike, smile, revealed beneath Thy laughing lips and rosy gum. As sweet in Persia's garden floats The night-bird's voice of music low, While soothed to slumber by his notes His rose-bud bends her balmy brow,â So may the voice most dear to thee, Beside thy couch at evening be; So lightly yielding to thy rest, Like Iran's Rose, may'st thou be blest. And oh! may rapture swell the notes, When thine own spirit sings thee, love, To thy last sleep, then warbling floats, Like Persia's heaven-taught bird above; And thus, although thy future years May pass not âall undimmed by tears,â Thou'lt wear that spirit high but mild, Amid the fleeting clouds, fair child! TO CAMILLE. I will not wish that Rapture's beam, May ever light that laughing eye; But, dear Camille, should every gleam Of youthful pleasure fade and die: May Faith, with purer, holier power, Lend thee her light in Sorrow's hour. I cannot pray the dimpling glow Upon thy cheek may ever play: The prayer were vainâfor Care, I know, Will chase each rosy smile away. But I do pray, when fades its bloom, That Love may light it to the tomb. I may not hope thy happy heart, Will never know Affliction's blight, But when its radiant dreams depart, And Hope's fair wings unfurl for flight: Oh! track the wanderer to the sky, And rest that wearied heart on high. FANNY'S ERROR. Fanny shuts her smiling eyes, Then, because she cannot see; Thoughtless simpleton! she cries, âAh! you can't see me!â Fanny's like the sinner vain, Who with spirit shut and dim, Thinks because he sees not Heaven, Heaven cannot see him! WILLY'S LAMENT FOR HIS NONPAREIL. My bird! my beautiful and bright, My present from the sunny South! Dear Anna sent him laden light, With kisses from her own sweet mouth. I stole them from him in my play, And has he, truly, flown away? My bird! all brilliant colours lent Their glory to his glossy wings, And with a changeful lustre, blent Around his throat in radiant rings. I called him Rainbow in my play, And, rainbow-like, he's flown away! My bird! my own beloved bird! His carol seemed more sweet and clear, Than any I have ever heard, Save her's who sent the warbler here. I thought he loved my gentle play, He did notâfor he's flown away! And Anna, when the tale she hears, Her little heart will heave with woe, Her large soft eyes will fill with tears, And she will think I let him go: I, who have mourned his loss all day, And wept because he went away! His cage was light, and large, I'm sure, And all his seeds were good to eat; And fresh the water was, and pure, In which he washed his playful feet. And then he seemed so fond and gay, I can't think why he went away. How much I miss his sunrise song, His pretty bill, his glancing eye, I think of them the whole day long, And every time I speak, I sigh: I do not love to laugh and play, When faithless Rainbow's flown away. THE CHILD'S GIFT. A FACT. A child beside a window stood, A merry child, in smiling mood; A little boy went slowly by, A beggar boy, with pleading eye! Why did the sweet girl's sunny face A sudden cloud of sorrow wear? She marked the beggar's lingering pace, Alas! those baby feet were bare! She glanced a moment at her own,â Her pretty shoes were bright and new,â A quick, glad thought, like sunlight, shone The trembling tears of Pity through! 'Twas done, as soon as thought,âshe bent, Her soul on her sweet task intent, Drew off the shoes with eager joy, And flung them to the beggar boy! ORDINATION HYMN. While peals, through Heaven's resplendent air, The solemn and unfaltering hymn, From blissful myriads meeting there, Thy Cherubim and Seraphim! On earth! oh God! a feebler strain, Thy frailer children humbly raise; Yet, blest as Heaven's, if Thou but deign To hear the voice of prayer and praise! The voice of praise,âthy hand divine, A lamp, to guide our feet hath given; The voice of prayer,âthat it may shine, Pure o'er the path to Thee and Heaven! And when its fires shall fail in death, Oh! source of glory may it rise! And, re-illumined by thy breath, Shine forth,âa star,âbeyond the skies! THE WARNING. Affection my pathway with roses was wreathing, They whisperedââTo-morrow will banish their bloom;â Fair Hope in my ear a sweet burden was breathing, They saidââ'Twill be hushed in Reality's gloom!â A day-dream of joy in my young heart was glowingâ âAlas!â said the warner, ânot long will it shine!â Gay fairy-like Fancy, the future was showing,â âThe vision,â they murmured, âis false as divine!â Ah! if love and life be but a dream, a delusion, And the cold future bright but in Fancy's glad eye; Still, still let me live in the blessed illusion, And, trusting the falsehood, hope on till I die! TO JESSIE, IN SCOTLAND. Ah! Jessie! how I envy thee! Thou dwellest 'mang the mountains, 'Mid breezes pure as thou canst be, And lochs and laughing fountains! I would I were beside thee there, My brow to free winds baring, To scale dear Scotland's rocky heights, Wi' foot o' fearless daring. I would I had a highland home, Wi' simple comforts smiling, Where those I luve alone could come, The canny hours beguiling. The wimpling burn should lave my feet, I'd seek the sunny brae; I'd braid my hair wi' gowans sweet, And bless the lee-lang day. Alas! condemned, wi' heart o' care, To London's crowded street; The thought o' highland sun and air, Fu' oft will gar me greet! LITTLE MARY'S âRUSE DE GUERRE.â âOh! give it, give it to me, Jane! It was a gift from mother! I would not change my darling chain, Oh! noâfor any other!â 'Twas thus I heard our Mary say,â A little, timid girl,â When naughty Jane had snatched away Her precious string of pearl. The tyrant lifted high the chain, Which Mary tiptoe tried, And tired her tiny arm, in vain, To reach, and Jane replied,â âThere, you shall have it, child, if you Will say just what I tell you to.â And thoughtless Mary said, âI will!â Too good herself to dream of ill; âWill you?â cried Jane, exultingly,â âThen sayâyou'll give the pearls to me!â A moment, frightened and subdued, The artless child in silence stood; A shadow filled her guileless eyes, And low her faltering voice replies,â âI must not break my word, and yetâ I cannotâcannot part with it!ââ âOh stop! I know!ââthe shadow fled, Our darling raised her pretty head,â Shook from her temples, white and fair, The careless curls that clustered there,â Held out her dimpled hand, and said, With smile and tone of roguish glee, âYes, Jane,ââYou'll give the pearls to me.â Now let me have my necklaceâdo!â I said just what you told me to!â TO A BEAUTY. Beautiful, yes! but the blush will fade, The light grow dim which the blue eyes wear; The gloss will vanish from curl and braid, And the sunbeam die in the waving hair. Turn from the mirror, and strive to win Treasures of loveliness still to last; Gather earth's glory and bloom within, That the soul may be bright when youth is past. TO JANE. Written in her Album, beneath a Picture of a Dove at a Fountain. The wild-dove, to the garden spring, May come and lave its wandering wing, And bend above the waters bright, And murmur with a dove's delight; But holier, in the solitude, Her own pure fountain of the wood, That blessed home,âthat shadowed nest, Where soft and calm her dear ones rest! And flinging, from her pinions fair, The silver drops that linger there; The bird will leave the garden-spring, And wave for home her weary wing. And thus for thee, in haunts of light, The stream of Joy will sparkle bright, And thou wilt stay thy step and sip The fairy draught, with smiling lip; And linger long amid the flowers, That gaily wreathe in Pleasure's bowers. And thou wilt weary like the dove, And turn thee from the wave away, To that fair fount of Truth and Love, That springs within thy home for aye! Oh! calm and blest be there thy rest, As the wild bird's in woodland nest! TO A FRIEND,âWITH A BOOK. Not as a token of my love,â For countless offerings, light as this, Can never tell thee half its high And holy tenderness! Not as a gift of gratitude,â A world's wealth could not guerdon thee, For the divine, deep wealth of heart, Thou lavishest on me! But as a simple souvenir, Of one, who proudly calls thee friend, Appealing to thy memory, The little book I send. THE FLOWER PLAY. How soon a bright and happy child Will catch our playful tone; And glad to have a frolic wild, Match our mirth with her own! I said to Anna onceââGood night, My precious Mignionette!â And she replied, with quick delight, âGood night, my Violet!â I tried again, âGood night, my Pink, My Jessamine, my Laurel!â She pressed her lip,ââI cannot thinkâ Oh! yesâGood night, my Sorrel.â Once more I spoke, in pleased surprise, âGood night, my little Fox-glove! She answered me, with laughing eyes,â âGood night, my piece of Box, love!â I thought to tire her baby-brain, But no! she'd not give up,â âGood night, my Rose!â she laughed againâ âGood night, my Buttercup!â But little versed in Flora's lore, Is Anna,âyet an hour She racked her infant mind for more, And gave me flower for flower! Weary at last, she sighed out, while Her brow began to wrinkle, With desperate tone and sleepy smile, âGood night,âmy Periwinkle!â A SKETCH. We had sat, Day after day, my gentle friend and I, On the rude door-step of the pleasant cottage; And all the time, the blessed smile of Heaven Was stealing to our hearts, and filling them With its own silent gladness. We had heard The last warm, fragrant sigh of parting Summerâ The last light rustle of her lovely robe, That fluttered in the Autumn-breeze, before The lingerer spread her bright, unwilling wings: We saw her sunny glances fade away From the fair meadows she so seemed to love,â The graceful wooded hills and streams, that laugh'd Like light, beneath the glory of her eye. Thus Fancy taught us then to gaze and listen, For Fancy is a fairy, that can hear, Ever, the melody of Nature's voice, And see all lovely visions that she will. She drew a picture of a beauteous bird, With plumes of radiant green and gold inwoven, Banished from its beloved resting-place, And fluttering, in vain hope, from tree to tree, And bade us think, how like it, the sweet season From one bright shelter to another fled: First, from the maple waved her emerald pinions, But lingered still upon the oak and elm, Till, frightened by rude breezes, even from them, With mournful sigh, she moan'd her sad farewell! And now came Autumn, like a gorgeous king, With mantle many-hued, of changeful light, And golden crownâthe harvest-moon his sceptre. No more we sat, as we were wont, at eve, On the rude door-step of the pleasant cottage, For all too frail as yet the trembling rose, Fanned by the breath of Summer into life, On Anna's cheekâthat cheek so pale of late! Fondly we nursed the flower, and dared not let The voice of Autumn whisper to our treasure Too rudely, lest he'd scare that bloom away: Yet gay within the evening went, and oft Our circle parted for another friendâ Another voice our pleasant converse joined. I wish I could recal, in his own words, A story told by one, who sometimes came: He had been wandering in a wood at sunset; Two little, careless girls, just come from school, Were standing mute beside a silent stream; The eldest looked, with deep blue eyes, intent Upon her graceful workâan oak-leaf wreath, On which her little fingers glanced like snow, While rapidly the pliant stems she twined, A chain of glowing tintsâcrimson and brown, And green and clouded goldâa brilliant toy! And wreathed around her white, unshadowed forehead Just such another rich-leafed coronal, Mingled its rude and changeful beauty there With sunny, curling clusters of light hair, That lay in wild waves on her neck and cheek: The other watched the garland as it grew, In patient joy and with a waiting smile, For well she knew 'twas for her own sweet brow. Meanwhile, the sun hung lingering o'er the scene, As if he loved to look on loveliness! And in the clear, still stream, with radiant pencil, Pictured the pretty creatures as they stood! Careless, unconscious, silent with delight, Their small straw bonnets flung among the leaves, And they, unheeding of the parting day, Thinking of nothing but their own sweet play! FRAGMENT OF A FAIRY ROMANCE. Mary, did you ever hear Of the frolic fairies, dear? They're a little, blessed race, Peeping up in Fancy's face, In the valley, on the hill, By the fountain and the rill; Laughing out between the leaves That the loving Summer weaves; Sailing in a nut-shell, set Down a tiny rivulet, With a rose-leaf for a sail, Swelling to the mimic gale; Riding on a humming-bird, Guiding him with magic word; Struggling with a butterfly, On a blossom fresh and fair, With a laughing lip and eye, For the clearest dew-drop there; Eating from its honey-cup All the poor bee's breakfast up; Hiding in the sunny sheaf, Sleeping on a lily leaf, Dancing ever on the moss That doth wear the greenest gloss, With their little lightning feet,â Did you ever see them, sweet? Waving soft their balmy wings O'er the infant's slumber meek, Circling it in airy rings, Breathing roses on its cheek; Well they love their watch to keep O'er all pure and guileless thingsâ Gentle childrenâhappy flowersâ Singing to them in their sleep, Through the holy starlight hours Smiling still their beds above,â Did you ever feel them, love? Did you ever, dearest? No? Do not look in sorrow so,â Hear the story, Mary mine, Of the fairy Rosoline; Such her pretty name, because, Keeper of the Rose she was;â Her's to watch the blushing flower, Fan it in the noontide hour, Bid the lazy zephyr fly, Lest her drooping charge should die, And with murmured elfin-charm Save it from the insect's harm. Once, in pleasant moonlight weather, Lots of fairies met together,â Busy creatures! what a bustle! How their silken winglets rustle! How their tongues, so tiny, rattle With their low, melodious prattle! How the rovers come and go âOn the light, fantastic toe!â You'd have thought a bee was there, Buzzing in the balmy air! Pleased to see its starlight track, One climbed up a glow-worm's back! One within her golden hair Wreathed a row of feathers rare, Borrowed, with imploring eye, From a beaming butterfly! Two, that loved to play see-saw, On a pebble laid a straw; But another roguish one, Fully bent on fairy fun, Crept behind them while at play, And the pebble pulled away; How the stones, for minutes after, Echoed to their silvery laughter! One, from off the slippery straw, Straight into a raindrop fell, Soaked her pretty pinions well; While her wiser playmate saw How things went,âand so the elf, Spread her wings and saved herself; But the loveliest of the throng, And the merriest, Mary mine, Was the heroine of my song, Was the fairy Rosoline! Hidden in her favorite rose, Rocking when the zephyr chose; There she lay and bubbles blew, With a tulip's pistil fine, Dipping in a drop of dew, While each circle as it flew, Wore that tiny form's reflection, Resting in her flower's protection. She had seen the day before, Children by a cottage door, She had watched them fling in play, Bubbles to the sunset ray; And had kept the secret sweet, Till the fairy band should meet. Well! the others saw the bubble, And exclaimed in pleasant trouble, âWhat a beautiful balloon! Is she going to the moon? Sure the form is Rosoline's, That within the crystal shines; Ah! 'tis broken in the air, And no shining form is there! Fell she in the blossom bright? Yes! from out the rose's heart, Bearing still that shape of light, See another circle start. One by one they soar on high, One by one they break and die; But each globe that rises there, Doth the same bright image bear, Rosoline upon her rose, Rosoline in soft repose! Nowâere one is burst, another Follows fast its beaming brother: Rare! to see the wonders shine, And in each a Rosoline!â Suddenly a laugh, that stirred All the rose's leaves was heard;â When the fairies gathered round, Wondering what the meaning should be, Roguish Rosoline they found, Quiet and demure as could be; With her pipe her lips below, Ready for another blow. Then the throng in accents gay, One and all did freely say, Rosoline out-fairied fairies, With her beautiful vagaries. LITTLE ELLEN'S PUN. She raised a boxâ(a baby of two years!) And smiling, criedââShall Ellen box her ears?â âMY BUBBLE'S BURSTâMY PIPE IS BROKEN!â One eve, when Summer's rosiest hours, To rich repose their Day-god drew; I saw, half-hid, in smiling flowers, A living blossom smiling too! A being, pure, and wild, and fair, As any rose-bud breathing there. It was a little playful girl, Her lips apart,âher blue eyes raised, While soft through many a silken curl, With eager joy they upwards gazed: I turned, and rising clear and light, A sun-lit bubble met my sight. In changeful beauty for a while, The rounded rainbow floated on, Returned the sun's rich farewell smile, Then trembled,âfaded, and was gone! My sad eyes sought the child once more, And she was gazing as before. While to her earnest brow and eye, A shade of silent thought had crept, But soon she started eagerly, And glanced aroundâthen wildly wept. For wreathed with flowersâa mockery sweet, Her pipe lay broken at her feet. Delighted with the radiant toy, That simple pipe had lightly given, She'd flung it there in thoughtless joy, To see her bubble rise to Heaven. Low words stole forthâthe first she'd spoken, âMy bubble's burstâmy pipe is broken!â Years came and wentâthe child had blushed To deeper, lovelier bloom, and now, A woman's soul the fair cheek flushed, A woman's feeling lit the brow. Again I saw that graceful head, On downy pillows lightly laid. Sweet dreams of holy Love, did fill Her maiden heart with Heaven;âbut while The rich glow deepened richer still, The red lip wore a sunnier smile. Her sleep was troubledâshe awoke, And the rose faded as she spoke. The same bright eyes before me shone, That watched the bubble soar on high, And wildly sweet the thrilling tone Of that soft evening hour went by. And still, with tears her thought was spoken, âMy dream hath fledâthe spell is broken!â âYears came and went,â and left the trace Of many a sorrow on her brow; But once again I saw that face, Alas! how sad its sweetness now! Consumption nursed the hectic tinge, Beneath her dark eye's drooping fringe. The breathing smileâonce bright and warm, With the rich dreams her heart had cherish'd,â Had that too darkened in the storm, Where bloom, and light, and joy had perished? Ah! worn away with grief unspoken, The smile was goneâthe heart was broken! FINIS.</field>
