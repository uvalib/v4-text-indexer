      <field name="fulltext">THE OLD PARSON. In antique-fashioned coat and wig, Along the road the aged preacher Goes slowly jogging in his gig, A homespun saint in garb and feature. He has a smile or kindly speech Alike for rich and poor and each Wild youth no sermon yet could reach: “For all are better than their deeds, And Heaven is kinder than our creeds,” Thinks the old Parson. Not now the school-boys, hat in hand, Or pinafored and pretty lassies, In rows upon the roadside stand, And make their manners when he passes. As the good custom used to be In days when he was young; but he Likes better, simple soul, to see The smile that lights each roguish eye— And rosy face as he rides by, The dear old Parson. Though many a stop he makes, you'll find His welcome presence longest lingers In yonder cottage-room behind The honeysuckles and syringas, Where all the lovely summer lies The crippled girl, with yearning eyes Turned outward to the flowers and skies. Few come to soothe her loneliness, And so good cause has she to bless The kind old Parson. When friends fall out, before the gate The gig turns up, he hitches sorrel,— Love enters in the house of Hate, He takes the hands of them that quarrel, And says: “Forgive! forgive! and then, If need there be, forgive again, And still forgive and love! For men Are always better than their deeds.” Such seeds he sows. Heaven bless the seeds Sown by the Parson! His mission is to help and bless; And the hard doctrines that he preaches In words of joy and gentleness Are hidden, like the stones in peaches. His hearers' hearts are warmed and stirred; “And yet, he does not preach the Word! His works are vain!” as late I heard, With finger-shake and sapient air, Two pert young ministers declare, And blame the Parson. One said, “He likes a hand at whist”; And one, “He takes a glass at dinner, And loves to counsel and assist Better than to convert the sinner.” “Grave faults!” said both. But this I know: The Parson's life, as parsons go, Is such that those who judge him so Are hardly worthy to unloose The buckles of his dusty shoes,— A rare old Parson! “He likes a joke too well by half”; And so he sets some hearts a-quaking, As if, because his deacons laugh The pillars of the church were shaking! “I never yet could learn,” he says, “Why rooted faith should flourish less In broad, sunshiny cheerfulness Than in the shadow of the tomb: 'T is fear, not faith, that hugs the gloom,” Argues the Parson. He squares his thought by right good sense, And does not dread the light of science. His finest flowers of eloquence Are just the common dandelions And buttercups of daily speech; And yet they say, who hear him preach, That none so well as he can teach The hope that lives, the love that burns, Till even the careless sceptic turns To heed the Parson. But, though he be not deeply versed In modern oratoric graces, The studied pause, the fervent burst, The flower-embroidered commonplaces, He treads no changeless, narrow rounds Of old belief, but far from bounds His New Jerusalem he founds; “For newer life brings larger needs, And truth outgrows our threadbare creeds,” Says the wise Parson. Love's labors are his rest, and still His friends will look, in pleasant weather, To see him jogging by, until His gig and he break down together. Our friend is growing very old, And rich in all the hoarded gold Which hearts alone can have and hold: “The riches that men leave behind Are not the riches to my mind,” Quoth the old Parson. He still will have the good he gave When, all his earthly errands ended, He who has stood by many a grave Shall be by us in turn attended To the last resting-place of clay; Then, as we lay his form away, We'll strew the sod with flowers, and say: “The man was better than his deeds, His heart was larger than our creeds, Peace to the Parson!” THE STORY OF COLUMBUS: TOLD TO THE YOUNG. I. COLUMBUS AND HIS LITTLE SON DIEGO. A way-worn man in Spanish lands, He wanders by the sea;— And by his side a little lad: “O Father! why are we so sad? Why don't you speak to me? “All day the silent ships go by, The long waves wash the shore. I'm weary of the silent ships! The salt waves mock my thirsty lips;— I'm weary of their roar! “Along the sky the ships go by, But never one comes near. So soft and slow, like ghosts they go! They must be ghosts, or else I know They would not leave us here! “I think the ships would pity us, If ships could understand!— Why did we leave our quiet home, In the grand old pleasant town, to roam Like beggars through the land? “O, Lisbon was a pleasant town! Till now I never knew How cool and sweet was our fair street, And the window, shaded from the heat, Where the fresh sea-breezes blew! “The window of your little room, Where many a day I stood For hours, and watched you, while you drew The charts which every captain knew, The maps we sold for food. “Was it those wondrous maps that put Such dreams into your mind, Of some strange country, far away, Beyond the ocean, which some day You mean to sail and find? “Those dreams have made us sad and poor; Your hair has turned to gray; And, sometimes, when you look at me, Your eyes are strange,—they seem to see That strange world far away! “O Father! I'm so tired to-night,” The little wanderer said, “That world, and all the things that live Or grow upon it, I would give Just for a little bread!” A tear was in the father's eye, But his heart was strong and great: “For thy dear sake, my child, I yearn To be at rest, but we must learn To suffer and to wait.” II. COLUMBUS AND THE PRIOR. Dreary and brown the night comes down, Gloomy, without a star. On Palos town the night comes down; The day departs with stormy frown; The sad sea moans afar. A convent gate is near: 't is late: Ting-ling! the bell they ring. They ring the bell, they ask for bread;— “Just for my child,” the father said. Kind hands the bread will bring. White was his hair, his mien was fair, His look was calm and great. The porter ran and called a friar; The friar made haste and told the prior; The prior came to the gate. He took them in, he gave them food; The traveller's dreams he heard; And fast the midnight moments flew, And fast the good man's wonder grew, And all his heart was stirred. The child the while, with soft, sweet smile, Forgetful of all sorrow, Lay soundly sleeping in his bed: The good man kissed him there, and said: “You leave us not to-morrow! “I pray you, rest the convent's guest. This child shall be our own,— A precious care, while you prepare Your business with the court, and bear Your message to the throne.” III. BEFORE THE KING AND QUEEN OF SPAIN. With heart elate, at the convent gate, The father kissed his boy. He kissed the child, he kissed the prior, And sallied forth in sad attire, Upon his errand of joy. King Ferdinand, august and grand, Sat in his royal chair. Beside him, gracious and serene, Sat Isabel, his famous Queen, As wise as she was fair. Now, after many wanderings Through long and weary years, Amidst a court of proud Castilians, Before the sovereigns of millions, The traveller appears. Unknown to fame, and poor, he came;— The courtiers veiled their laughter. He stooped to kiss each royal robe; While, stoutly bearing chart and globe, A little page came after. The crafty king, with courtly smile, That scarce concealed his scorn, Inquired his name, and whence he came. He said: “Columbus is my name; In Genoa was I born. “And many voyages have I made, And cities visited; In many countries have I been, And storms and battles have I seen, And toiled for daily bread. “But for one greater thing than all, Heaven marked me from my birth: Behold! I bear about with me, Beneath this garb of poverty, A pearl of priceless worth. “I offer it to crownéd heads: They scorn the gift sublime! But who accepts that slighted gem, 'T will glitter in his diadem, The wonder of all time! “I offer you a realm, O King! O Queen!” He spread his chart, And poised the globe. “This world,—'t is round; A part,” he said, “is solid ground, And rolling seas a part. “Here Europe lies; there, Africa; Vast Asia stretches here. Look now, what boundless wastes must be Beyond, of unknown land or sea, To make the perfect sphere! “Eastward it lies; yet give me ships, And crews, at my command, Less than a thousand leagues to sail Due westward, and I shall not fail To find that farthest land! “That new world found, 't is yours; and yours The deathless fame will be Of mighty potentates, who first Opened the darksome way, and burst The barrier of the sea!” IV. BEFORE THE WISE MEN OF SALAMANCA. King Ferdinand looked pleased and bland; He called for his wise men. Their gowns were black; their beards were gray; So very old and wise were they, Each knew enough for ten. Then up spoke one,—the very sun Of wisdom and of knowledge he! “This man,” he said, “is a deceiver;— 'T is plain, he is an unbeliever In science and theology.” Then with a frown black as his gown, And features fixed and solemn, he Condemned the scheme; “because,” he said, “Of such things no man ever read In Moses or in Ptolemy. “Surely that man is crazed,” quoth he, “Who talks of lands that lie Far off, beyond the farthest seas, Below the world, where men and trees Grow downward towards the sky! “I 'd like to ask this stranger,—if Your Majesties are willing,— What keeps the men from falling off? And what,” he added with a scoff, “Prevents the sea from spilling? “And even if such a land exists, Far in some unknown deep, And he sails down to it, 't is plain, He never could sail back again, He 'd find the world so steep!” And so the case was judged; for who Would ever think to rank a Poor traveller and his dreams before The solemn gowns and ancient lore Of men of Salamanca? Men call him crazed whose eyes are raised To look beyond his times; And they are learnéd, who too fast Are anchored in the changeless past, To seek Truth's newer climes! Yet act thy part, heroic heart! For only by the strong Are great and noble deeds achieved;— No truth was ever yet believed That had not struggled long. V. QUEEN ISABELLA. Forth from the court Columbus went, But lingered near it still To urge his suit; until at last Men touched their foreheads, as he passed, And nodded, as men will. Then up spoke good Queen Isabel:— Her large heart understood The voyager's noble heart and mind; For generous natures know their kind, The good discern the good. “Send hither again that man to me!” She heard once more his story;— In that strange tale, with joy and awe, As in a morning cloud, she saw The new time's rising glory. “For my own kingdom of Castile,” Said she, “this voyage I claim! I pledge my jewels for ships and crews, And treasure shall be yours to use”; And signed her royal name. “Your boy shall be my little page, And he at court shall stay. And now, farewell!” Right thankfully He kissed her hand, and forth went he, A happy man that day! VI. THE VOYAGE. The ships are here at Palos pier. Now kiss thy child adieu! He kissed the child, he kissed the prior: The sails are set: the Saint Maria Stands out towards the blue. Two other craft, light caravels, The armament complete:— His own good ship, full-decked, though small, And two frail, open barks, are all The voyager's little fleet. Away! away! across the bay, Like sea-birds they go sailing. But never a cheer the crews could hear;— From wives and children on the pier Went forth a sound of wailing. “Now woe befall our admiral!” The weeping mariners cry. “Farewell, farewell, O Mother Spain! We shall not see thy shores again! He takes us forth to die!” Three days from port, in freshening gales, The Pinta's rudder parted. They seek the fair Canaries; there The damaged Pinta they repair. Then forth afresh they started. The fiery peak of Teneriffe Glares red on sea and shore. It lights them from the fair Canaries; Thence seven days' sail, the needle varies; It points due north no more. The appalléd crews their chief accuse; They fill the ships with groans: “Our keels go down to night and chaos, Where gulfs will swallow, and monsters slay us, And miseries rack our bones!” A heron flies past the Nina's mast; Soon floating weeds appear, And hovering land-birds they descry: “Ha, ha!” the happy mariners cry, “The land, the land is near!” The wind blew ever from the east, Until it died away. Into a realm of calms they pass,— Upon a glistening sea of glass The lazy vessels lay. “This is the Sea of Death!” they said; “And never from this spot, Nor to nor fro, our keels will go; Nor seas will ripple, nor breeze will blow, But here our hulls will rot!” Up sprang the breeze, up rose the seas, And all the sailors cheered. Westerly still, by night and day, Where never a prow had found its way, The steadfast captain steered. All looked for land; and oft at dawn, Or on the evening air, “Land! land!” rang loud from deck or shroud; But every cliff dissolved in cloud, And hope changed to despair. Then many complain: “Our voyage is vain; We sail a shoreless sea!” Some said, “Now let us seize the barks! We'll toss the admiral to the sharks! A very madman he!” The mutineers he chides, or cheers With high prophetic words. His great soul falters not, nor sleeps: More southerly now his course he keeps, Following the flight of birds. Some fresh shore-weeds, and river reeds, At last come drifting by,— A thorn-branch, and a carvéd staff: The mariners clap their hands and laugh;— Now surely land is nigh! False as the gales that shook the sails, Their fickle spirits veered. Still, where no ship had shaped the way,— Where the waves are white with fleets to-day.— Steadily on he steered! VII. DISCOVERY OF THE NEW WORLD. Upon the lonesome deck he keeps His watch at dead of night. Searching with anxious eyes the dark, What sees he far away? a spark, A little glimmering light! Then boomed the Pinta's signal-gun! The first that ever broke The silence of a world. That sound, Echoing to savage depths profound, A continent awoke! Wild joy possessed each mariner's breast, When day revealed a rich And fruitful island, fair and green, Where naked savages were seen Running along the beach. The Saint Maria moves proudly up, And drops her anchor nighest; And “Glory to God!” the sailors sing; With “Glory to God!” the wild winds ring,— “Glory to God in the highest!” The boat is manned, and towards the land Swift fly the flashing oars. High at the prow the admiral, In princely garb, superb and tall, Surveys the savage shores. They touched the strand, he stepped to land, And knelt and kissed the sod, With all his followers. Amazed, Far off the painted red men gazed, Believing him a god. Then up rose he, and solemnly, With bright sword drawn, advanced The standard of the King and Queen;— On its rich sheen of gold and green, The sunrise glory glanced. With wondering awe, the red men saw The silken cross unfurled. His task was done: for good or ill, The fatal banners of Castile Waved o'er the Western World. VIII. RETURN TO SPAIN. His bark is here, at Palos pier, Storm-battered, stem and stern; And crowds come thronging to the pier, And wild huzzas, and cheer on cheer, Welcome his safe return. With fame, and trophies strange, from lands New found beyond the sea, He comes! and never conqueror, Returning home from glorious war, Such homage had as he. The haughty court that scorned him once Forgot its old disdain. The sovereigns greet him as a brother, Or prince more honored than all other, Who gives a realm to Spain. IX. THE COURTIERS AND THE EGG. When ships with ease across the seas His new-found path pursue, The courtiers slight his service done. “Why, that was, after all,” said one, “An easy thing to do!” Said he, “So 't is an easy thing To cause this egg to stand.” They try, and fail. “Why, look, my lord!” He said; and lightly on the board He struck it with his hand. He breaks the shell; and on the end It stands upright! Straightway All try the feat, and all succeed: “Why, that is easily done, indeed!” “Yes, when I 've shown the way.” X. HIS REWARD.
