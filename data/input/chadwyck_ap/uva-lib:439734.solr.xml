      <field name="fulltext">TO ONE—OF WHOM, IN THIS MOMENT OF DEPARTURE FOR A FOREIGN LAND, I THINK, SADLY AND ONLY—TO MY MOTHER, THIS VOLUME IS, WITH THE DEEPEST AFFECTION OF HER SON, FONDLY AND RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED. POEM DELIVERED BEFORE THE SOCIETY OF UNITED BROTHERS, AT BROWN UNIVERSITY, On the day preceding Commencement, Sept. 6, 1831. If in the eyes that rest upon me now I see the light of an immortal fire— If in the awe of concentrated thought, The solemn presence of a multitude Breathing together, the instinctive mind Acknowledges aright a type of God— If every soul that from its chambers dim Answers this summons, be a deathless spark Lit to outburn the ever constant stars,— Then is the ruling spirit of this hour Compell'd from Heaven, and if the soaring minds Usher'd this day upon an untried flight Stoop not their courses, we are met to cheer Spirits of light sprung freshly on their way. How strangely certain is the human mind, Godlike and gifted as it is, to err! It wakes within a frame of various powers, A stranger in a new and wondrous world. It brings an instinct from some other sphere, For its fine senses are familiar all, And, with th' unconscious habit of a dream, It calls, and they obey. The priceless sight Springs to its curious organ, and the ear Learns strangely to detect the articulate air In its unseen divisions, and the tongue Gets its miraculous lesson with the rest, And in the midst of an obedient throng Of well-trained ministers, the mind goes forth To search the secrets of a new-found home. Its infancy is full of hope and joy. Knowledge is sweet, and Nature is a nurse Gentle and holy; and the light and air, And all things common, warm it like the sun, And ripen the eternal seed within. And so its youth glides on; and still it seems A heavenward spirit, straying oftentimes, But never widely; and if Death might come And ravish it from earth as it is now, We could almost believe that it would mount, Spotless and radiant, from the very grave. But manhood comes, and in its bosom sits Another spirit. Stranger as it seems, It is familiar there, for it has grown In the unsearch'd recesses all unseen,— Or if its shadow darkened the bright doors, 'Twas smiled upon and gently driven in; And as the spider and the honey-bee Feed on the same bright flowers, this mocking soul Fed with its purer brother, and grew strong, Till now, in semblance of the soul itself, With its own mien and sceptre, and a voice Sweet as an angel's and as full of power, It sits, a bold usurper on the throne. What is its nature? 'Tis a child of clay, And born of human passions. In its train Follow all things unholy—Love of Gold, Ambition, Pleasure, Pride of place or name, All that we worship for itself alone, All that we may not carry through the grave. We have made idols of these perishing things Till they have grown time-honored on their shrines, And all men bow to them. Yet what are they? What is Ambition? 'Tis a glorious cheat! Angels of light walk not so dazzlingly The sapphire walls of Heaven. The unsearch'd mine Hath not such gems. Earth's constellated thrones Have not such pomp of purple and of gold. It hath no features. In its face is set A mirror, and the gazer sees his own. It looks a god, but it is like himself! It hath a mien of empery, and smiles Majestically sweet—but how like him! It follows not with Fortune. It is seen Rarely or never in the rich man's hall. It seeks the chamber of the gifted boy, And lifts his humble window, and comes in. The narrow walls expand, and spread away Into a kingly palace, and the roof Lifts to the sky, and unseen fingers work The ceilings with rich blazonry, and write His name in burning letters over all. And ever, as he shuts his wildered eyes, The phantom comes and lays upon his lids A spell that murders sleep, and in his ear Whispers a deathless word, and on his brain Breathes a fierce thirst no water will allay. He is its slave henceforth! His days are spent In chaining down his heart, and watching where To rise by human weaknesses. His nights Bring him no rest in all their blessed hours. His kindred are forgotten or estranged. Unhealthful fires burn constant in his eye. His lip grows restless, and its smile is curl'd Half into scorn—till the bright, fiery boy, That was a daily blessing but to see, His spirit was so bird-like and so pure, Is frozen, in the very flush of youth, Into a cold, care-fretted, heartless man! And what is its reward? At best, a name! Praise—when the ear has grown too dull to hear; Gold—when the senses it should please are dead; Wreaths—when the hair they cover has grown gray; Fame—when the heart it should have thrill'd is numb; All things but love—when love is all we want, And close behind comes Death, and ere we know That even these unavailing gifts are ours, He sends us, stripp'd and naked, to the grave! Is it its own reward? Reply to it Every aspiring heart within these walls! Summon the shadows of those bitter hours Wasted in brooding on neglect! Recall The burning tears wrung from a throbbing brain By a proud effort foil'd; and after all These agonies are number'd, rack your heart Back to its own self-nurtur'd wretchedness, And when the pangs are crowded into one Of all life's scorpion-stings, and Death itself Is sent or stayed, as it would bless or curse, Tell me if self-misgiving torture not Unutterably more! Yet this is all! The world has no such glorious phantom else. The spirit that could slave itself to Gold Hath never drunk of knowledge at the well. And Pleasure, if the senses would expand And multiply with using, might delude The flesh-imprisoned fancy—but not long. And earthly Love—if measured, is too tame— And if it drink, as in proud hearts it will, At the deep springs of life, is but a cloud Brooding with nameless sorrow on the soul— A sadness—a sick-heartedness—a tear! And these are the high idols of this world! Retreating shadows caught but at the grave— Mocking delusions, changing at the touch— Of one false spirit the false children all. And yet, what godlike gifts neglected lie Wasting and marr'd in the forgotten soul! The finest workmanship of God is there. 'Tis fleeter than the wings of light and wind; 'Tis subtler than the rarest shape of air; Fire and wind and water do its will; Earth has no secret from its delicate eye; The air no alchymy it solveth not; The star-writ Heavens are read and understood, And every sparry mineral hath a name, And truth is recogniz'd, and beauty felt, And God's own image stamp'd upon its brow. How is it so forgotten? Will it live When the great firmament is rolled away? Hath it a voice forever audible, “I am eternal!” Can it overcome This mocking passion-fiend, and even here Live like a seraph upon truth and light? How can we ever be the slaves we are, With a sweet angel sitting in our breasts! How can we creep so lowly, when our wings Tremble and plead for freedom! Look at him Who reads aright the image on his soul, And gives it nurture like a child of light. His life is calm and blessed, for his peace, Like a rich pearl beyond the diver's ken, Lies deep in his own bosom. He is pure, For the soul's errands are not done with men. His senses are subdued and serve the soul. He feels no void, for every faculty Is used, and the fine balance of desire Is perfect, and strains evenly, and on. Content dwells with him, for his mind is fed, And Temperance has driven out unrest. He heaps no gold. It cannot buy him more Of any thing he needs. The air of Heaven Visits no freshlier the rich man's brow; He has his portion of each silver star Sent to his eye as freely, and the light Of the blest sun pours on his book as clear As on the golden missal of a king. The spicy flowers are free to him; the sward, And tender moss, and matted forest leaves Are as elastic to his weary feet; The pictures in the fountains, and beneath The spreading trees, fine pencilings of light, Stay while he gazes on them; the bright birds Know not that he is poor; and as he comes From his low roof at morn, up goes the lark Mounting and singing to the gate of Heaven, And merrily away the little brook Trips with its feet of silver, and a voice Almost articulate, of perfect joy. Air to his forehead, water to his lips, Heat to his blood, come just as faithfully, And his own faculties as freely play. Love fills his voice with music, and the tear Springs at as light a bidding to his eye; And his free limbs obey him, and his sight Flies on its wondrous errands every where. What does he need? Next to the works of God His friends are the rapt sages of old time; And they impart their wisdom to his soul In lavish fulness, when and where he will. He sits in his mean dwelling and communes With Socrates and Plato, and the shades Of all great men and holy, and the words Written in fire by Milton, and the King Of Israel, and the troop of glorious bards, Ravish and steal his soul up to the sky— And what is it to him, if these come in And visit him, that at his humble door There are no pillars with rich capitals And walls of curious workmanship within? I stand not here in Wisdom's sacred stole. My lips have not been touch'd with holy fire. An humbler office than a counsellor Of human duties, and an humbler place Would better grace my knowledge and my years. I would not seem presuming. Yet have I Mingled a little in this earnest world, And staked upon its chances, and have learned Truths that I never gather'd from my books. And though the lessons they have taught me seem Things of the wayside to the practised man, It is a wisdom by much wandering learned; And if but one young spirit bend its wing More in the eye of Heaven because it knew The erring courses that bewildered mine, I have not suffered, nor shall teach in vain. It is a lesson oftener learned than loved— All knowledge is not nourishment. The mind May pine upon its food. In reckless thirst The scholar sometimes kneels beside the stream Polluted by the lepers of the mind. The sceptic, with his doubts of all things good And faith in all things evil, has been there; And, as the stream was mingled, he has strown The shore with all bright flowers to tempt the eye, And sloped the banks down gently for the feet; And Genius, like a fallen child of light, Has filled the place with magic, and compell'd Most beautiful creations into forms And images of license, and they come And tempt you with bewildering grace to kneel And drink of the wild waters; and behind Stand the strong Passions, pleading to go in; And the approving world looks silent on; Till the pleased mind conspires against itself, And finds a subtle reason why 'tis good. We are deceived, though, even as we drink, We taste the evil. In his sweetest tone The lying Tempter whispers in our ear, “Tho' it may stain, 'twill strengthen your proud wings;” And in the wild ambition of the soul We drink anew, and dream like Lucifer To mount upon our daring draught to Heaven. I need not follow the similitude. Health is vitality, and if the mind Is fed on poison, it must lose its power. The vision that forever strains to err Soon finds its task a habit; and the taste That will own nothing true or beautiful Soon finds the world distorted as itself; And the loose mind, that feeds an appetite For the enticements of licentious thought, Contracts a leprosy that oversteals Its senses, like a palsy, chill, and fast. The soul must be in health to keep its powers. It must lie open to the influences Of all things pure and simple. Like a flower Within a stifled chamber, it will droop If hidden from the pleasant sun and air; And every delicate fibre must have room To quicken and extend, and more than all, The stream that gives it moisture must be pure. Another lesson with my manhood came. I have unlearned contempt. It is the sin That is engender'd earliest in the soul, And doth beset it like a poison-worm, Feeding on all its beauty. As it steals Into the bosom you may see the light Of the clear, heavenly eye grow cold and dim, And the fine, upright glory of the brow Cloud with mistrust, and the unfetter'd lip, That was as free and changeful as the wind, Even in sadness redolent of love, Curl'd with the iciness of a constant scorn. It eats into the mind till it pollutes All its pure fountains. Feeling, reason, taste Breathe of its chill corruption. Every sense That could convey a pleasure is benumb'd, And the bright human being, that was made Full of all warm affections, and with power To look through all things lovely up to God, Is changed into a cold and doubting fiend, With but one use for reason—to despise! Oh if there is one law above the rest Written in wisdom—if there is a word That I would trace as with a pen of fire Upon the unsunn'd temper of a child— If there is any thing that keeps the mind Open to angel visits, and repels The ministry of ill—'tis human love! God has made nothing worthy of contempt. The smallest pebble in the well of truth Has its peculiar meaning, and will stand When man's best monuments have passed away. The law of Heaven is love and though its name; Has been usurp'd by passion, and profaned To its unholy uses through all time, Still, the eternal principle is pure; And in these deep affections that we feel Omnipotent within us, we but see The lavish measure in which love is given, And in the yearning tenderness of a child For every bird that sings above his head, And every creature feeding on the hills, And every tree, and flower, and running brook, We see how every thing was made to love, And how they err, who, in a world like this, Find any thing to hate but human pride! Oh, if we are not bitterly deceived— If this familiar spirit that communes With yours this hour—that has the power to search All things but its own compass—is a spark Struck from the burning essence of its God— If, as we dream, in every radiant star We see a shining gate through which the soul, In its degrees of being, will ascend— If, when these weary organs drop away, We shall forget their uses, and commune With angels and each other, as the stars Mingle their light, in silence and in love— What is this fleshly fetter of a day That we should bind it with immortal flowers! How do we ever gaze upon the sky, And watch the lark soar up till he is lost, And turn to our poor perishing dreams away, Without one tear for our imprisoned wings!</field>
