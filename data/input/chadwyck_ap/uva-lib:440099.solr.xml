      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME I THE SONG OF THE WAVE AND OTHER POEMS POEMS (1899â1902) CAIN THE SONG OF THE WAVE AND OTHER POEMS âMais nous, nous, consumÃ©s d'une impossible envie, En proie au mal de croire et d'aimer sans retour, RÃ©pondez, jours nouveaux, nous rendrez-vous la vie? Dites, Ã´ jours anciens, nous rendrez-vous l'amour?â âLeconte de Lisle. TO THE POET GIACOMO LEOPARDI EXORDIUM Speak! said my soul, be stern and adequate; The sunset falls from Heaven, the year is late, Love waits with fallen tresses at thy gate And mourns for perished days. Speak! in the rigor of thy fate and mine, Ere these scant, dying days, bright-lipped with wine, All one by one depart, resigned, divine, Through desert, autumn ways. Speak! thou art lonely in thy chilly mind, With all this desperate solitude of wind, The solitude of tears that make thee blind, Of wild and causeless tears. Speak! thou hast need of me, heart, hand and head, Speak, if it be an echo of thy dread, A dirge of hope, of young illusions deadâ Perchance God hears! A FIRST WORD âCome,â said the Ocean, âI have songs to sing, And need thine utterance, as Apollo's self Needed his lyre to perfume the world With chants of soul and body, both divine.â âCome,â said the Ocean, âif thy soul is fit To bear my mastery, thy words shall flow Simple and adequate as human tears, And all thy discord fall in great accords.â âCome,â said the Ocean: and I answered: âLord Of song and silence, I have heard thy voice, And loved as may a man the heart divine; But still my soul is tremulous and mute.â âCome,â said the Ocean, âoh, my tired child. My lips are delicate with whisper, sad With endless yesterdays, and marvellous With myriad legends since the birth of Time.â âCome,â said the Ocean, soft; and I, âBeloved, Alone upon thy breast I heard and knew And marvelled and was dumb.â And then the sea: âSpeak!â And I said, âBy what?â and She, âBy Love.â THE OCEAN SINGS I have glorified God in my descant, I have praised him in tempest and calm, I have mirrored his proper refulgence As I slept in the infinite palm. I have sung till the night was ecstatic, Till my lyrics woke flame in the moon, I have sung to the morning's desire And sheathed in the metal of noon. When my forehead was furrowed with silver, When my bosom swelled softly as sleep, When I wounded the sands in my passion, When I lisped through the sea-weed at neap, Through the piteous wail of the siren, Through the bell-buoy's comfortless moan, Through the silence that stirs to a sea-bird That moves in my vastness alone, I have sung; through the ranges of music I have frightened and comforted man, I have praised the strong life that compels me As what voice in the universe can. I have sung the great lyric of sorrow, The splendour of life and the pain, I have pitied the spirit's endeavour, The doubt and despair in the brain. My passion is never senescent, My sorrow is balm to the soul, My voice is divine with remembrance, With peace and commiserate dole. I have lavished my largess of comfort, Taken earth in mine arms like a child, Taught the children of life of its splendour, Brought their eyes to the light unbeguiled. I have laboured and none shall reward me, I have lavished and none shall repay, If the earth that I serve be ungrateful My bounty shall never decay. Could the stars be repaid for their brilliance, They would fall through precipitous air Day and night from the summit of heaven, Leave the universe blackened and bare. Take my beautyâGod's image is mirrored, Take my pity for Fate's sure control, Take my song, it is Life's evanescence, Take my silence, the strength of the Soul! THE SONG OF THE WAVE I This is the song of the wave! The mighty one! Child of the soul of silence, beating the air to sound: White as a live terror, as a drawn sword, This is the wave. II This is the song of the wave, the white-maned steed of the Tempest Whose veins are swollen with life, In whose flanks abide the four winds. This is the wave. III This is the song of the wave! The dawn leaped out of the sea And the waters lay smooth as a silver shield, And the sun-rays smote on the waters like a golden sword. Then a wind blew out of the morning And the waters rustled And the wave was born! IV This is the song of the wave! The wind blew out of the noon, And the white sea-birds like driven foam Winged in from the ocean that lay beyond the sky And the face of the waters was barred with white, For the wave had many brothers, And the wave was strong! V This is the song of the wave! The wind blew out of the sunset And the west was lurid as Hell. The black clouds closed like a tomb, for the sun was dead. Then the wind smote full as the breath of God, And the wave called to its brothers, âThis is the crest of life!â VI This is the song of the wave, that rises to fall, Rises a sheer green wall like a barrier of glass That has caught the soul of the moonlight, Caught and prisoned the moon-beams; Its edge is frittered to foam. This is the wave! VII This is the song of the wave, of the wave that fallsâ Wild as a burst of day-gold blown through the colours of morning It shivers to infinite atoms up the rumbling steep of sand. This is the wave. VIII This is the song of the wave, that died in the fulness of life. The prodigal this, that lavished its largess of strength In the lust of attainment. Aiming at things for Heaven too high, Sure in the pride of life, in the richness of strength. So tried it the impossible height, till the end was found: Where ends the soul that yearns for the fillet of morning stars, The soul in the toils of the journeying worlds, Whose eye is filled with the Image of God, And the end is Death! THE EAST WIND It came! Breaking across the giant gates of gold It cleaved the veils of morning fold on fold, A fluent sword aslant the early flame. The sea Shivered, as waking from impassioned sleep A naked girl might feel her senses creep Beneath the winter of reality. The dawn Fell haggard and dishevelled from the skies, The shoreless ocean filled with whispered cries And through the smothered twilight reared its spawn. And now A splash of chilly wind forsook the air And caught the ocean by its tangled hair, Bent it, and bit the stigma in its brow. Alone The wind of ruin walked from sky to skyâ As when Sertorius put forth to die, It swayed the void beyond the gates of stone. And then It grew almighty and the ocean roared; The living slime wherewith the world is floored Hearkened, as in their ships despairing men. To me The whisper came, the voice and then the call Of wanton power, and then, o'erwhelming all, The passion of mine own infinity. THE NORSEMEN These are the men! The North has given them name, The children of God who dare, From the field and the growing tree, Come down through the crystalline air Where the sky is a fleece of flame, And the breaker's crest is as hair Blown back from the brows of the sea; These are the men! These are the men! Where midnight abides in the land, Where the sun walks round the earth, Where the fields of God are benumbed, There the shadow did give them birth, Where the waves are tawny with sand And the miserly ground breeds dearth And the harps of the air are thrummed, These are the men! These are the men! Oh Merciful what for them? For thy children with frozen lips? Then the Lord spake, âI am the Life; Go down to the sea in ships BelovÃ¨d and dwell in the hem Of my robe though the tempest rips Like a sword, for I give ye Strife!â These are the men! These are the men! For they stand in the dawn of things Full-armed from the ocean's womb; With their dower of wild great joy In the pouring sun, in the boom Of the wave as the storm-flail sings, Till the waters pulse and ploy And gape like a snow-fringed tomb; These are the men! These are the men! In the strength of the primal song As the increate world turned white They descended and dwelt with the sea, Like a flower dawn bloomed on the night, And they knew that their lives were strong, That life was and should ever beâ Then the sun!âand a pulse of lightâ These are the men! These are the men! In their youth without memory They were glad, for they might not see The lies that the world has wrought On this parchment of God. The tree Yielded them ships and the sky Flamed as the waters fought; But they knew that death was a lie, That the life of man was as nought, And they dwelt in the truth of the sea: These are the men! âWAS HAT MAN DIR, DU ARMES KIND, GETHAN?â Weep nevermore again! The wind's wild footstep thrills the leaves with pain; Then desert silence, then the scattered cries Of frail-voiced children, then within thy heart A sense of falling leaves through gray linked rain, Of perished youth with grave prophetic eyes And strange scant visions of a hopeless past; A sense of life no older than thou art, And in thy soul, of bright tears falling fastâ Hush! tired child, weep nevermore again. THE SONG OF THE SWORD PRELUDE In the ineffable days when from the summits of morning, Through the extravagant noon, down to the murmurous eve, Lands of the plenteous vine lay in their vernal adorning, Robed in immutable calm, God's everlasting reprieve. Lands of imperial sun, lands of enduring fruition, Lands where abundant the wine perfumed the madness of youth, Lands where the women and men flamed in the vernal ignition, Gained through the shadows of sense rays from the ultimate truth. Where on the tenanted seas flashed the flushed feet of the moon-rise And stirred the dumb heart with its touchâsilent, alone, unconfined; Where, as to promiseful dawn, scattered the natural tune dies, Women's bare feet in the dew, women's wild hair in the wind. WhereâO immaculate dreamâHope that endureth forever, Beauty and adequate peace opened wide gates for the soul, Where the low lyric of love welded so nought could dissever, Where there was marble and song, where death was divine and its dole. There in impossible times, lands of the amorous turtle, Still, on a porphyry shrine lay the memorial sword, Sheathed in reverberate gold, consecrate laurel and myrtle, Cold in the plenty and peace, waiting the hand of the Lord. Passionate, passive and proud, stark on the porphyry altar, Menacing, waiting the years, serving an absolute need, Ever the sword is at hand, lest, when the hearts of men falter, Rise from the satiate peace sons of degenerate seed. So there may come to the need, filled with enormous desire, One from the mire of men bearing the resonant word, Then shall the slumber dissolve, shattered as crystal by fire, He alone voids the gold sheath, chaunting the song of the sword. Then shall the spirits of men wake to a novel refulgence, Over the marginal sea break an irradiate star, Flame shall arise in the heart, desire demanding indulgence, Lust of the greatness of earth, lust of dominion and war. INVOCATION God of the hand and loin and burning heart, God of the whelming ecstasy and lust, God of the fretful youth and lifeless dust, God that art travailed with a vital smart! God of the earlier races, limbed like Mars, Epic as Odin echoing bell-voiced forth, God of the sun-gilt South and iron North, Symbol of life's impulsionâGod of Wars! Thine, in thy powerful hand, before mankind Sprang from the womb of nature, blazed the sword, Forged in the vital heat creation poured, White from its core and tempered in the wind, That walked through chaos down the cold expanse Of lucent solitude from sun to sun! O sign of life when life was unbegun, This life of earth where death is circumstance! THE SONG When the vortex of Heaven was blind The sword Was framed from a primal desire That shook thro' the void like a wind; Then it rose as a shivering fire And crimsoned God's vision of peace; Then sank, like the trail of a star, Down the frail twilight of space And stood over hell like a scar Furrowed deep in the forehead of night, Till the universe called, âThere is light, And life and the promise of war.â Lamping the limitless gloom, The sword Glowed in the saffron of Hell, As might in a tenanted tomb Some strenuous memory swell Over death and illume the dead eyes. ThenâO wonder!âere ever it fell, A hand gat the sword in its grasp, And while earth and sea uttered their spawn, Far-flung on the ocean of skies, It lay like the welter of dawn In the giant immutable clasp. Then white as the darkness of death The sword Sang like a boreal breath Blown thro' the idyll of dawn, Cadenced as steel that is drawn Tense thro' the crest of a storm, It exalted the choir of earth, Singing deep where the heart-blood is warm, And pervaded the resonant sky Like the solemn and sorrowful mirth Of life that is living to die. And down thro' the legended years The sword, Sonorous with laughter and tears, Has sung its old epic to man; And the earlier glory awakes As when life in its anguish began, Till, whenever the noon-brilliance shakes Down the scabbardless steel, joy and woe, All is blended to passion that has Neither laughter, nor weeping, nor name, But love and the lusting for fame, Even death in its agony, grow Into life that is, shall be and wasâ Life the ichor of earth, the spring-throe, Ever manifold, ever the same. AFTER-WORD Is it this, BelovÃ¨d, this the secret?â Life, the earth life, thee and me compelling, Life and only life?âWhere flowers have withered, Lavished perfume on the impartial breezes, Fed the bee and crowned the bush with beauty, Then, the summer spent, the petals perish, Then, the spring returned, the sap returning, Novel buds that ripen to perfection,â Flowers may fade but never so the impulse, Shift the scenes the play goes on forever?â Is it this, BelovÃ¨d, this the secret? Oh, consider!âSure that life endurethâ Do I kiss thy lips, thine adolescent Breast of marble, do my fingers even Touch thy hand, the perfume of thy tresses Fall upon my sense, thy voice's cadence Turn concordant all my soul's confusionâ Do I these, or look upon thee even, Comes a certainty of life's persistence, Life that speaks in thee, in me, in nature, Life demanding choate form and substance, Life pervasive, deathless and enduring. Is it this, BelovÃ¨d, this the secret? This I sing to, since the word suffices, This thou hearest?âI strove to sing the man's song, Sing the earth's song, Life, the strength and splendour! Thou did'st lean and hark and comprehend me:â Life abideth, thou must knowâa lover!â Thou did'st know and then, and thenâI, pausing, Hear you question, âIs it this, the secret?â Hear you ask, âIs life the spirit's answer? Shall the inward voice be stilled in living?â Hear you wonder, âWhat's the good of life, then? Why endure the pain and natural anguish, Wherefore draw the furrow, sweat the year-long, When the winter shuts its jaws of crystal, Kills the generous spring, refuses fruitageâ This the secret? What's the good of life then?â Ah, there's still a songâmen strive to sing it, Sing their striving, reach their goal, are silent. What's the song?âNo utterance can confine it Only silence great enough to bear it. I who cannot praise thee, thee my woman, Singing life, as dim as life my verses, Could I call the winds and waves to witness, Could I pull the stars down from their courses, Were I lion-voiced as old Jehovah, Then my words could be but shadowy symbols; None may phrase the spirit's simple knowledge, And the secret and the revelation Of what is not, where the mind of mortal Turns to ashes and where life is tacit. Oh, my Well-Beloved, forget the pÃ¦an! Let the sword-blade and the gold and glory Warp no longer thine eternal vision. Seek thy soul, and, finding, cease from struggle; Cease, forget the song of life and living; That's the world's wayâLife and more and endless, Copious earth-life in its rich completion, Life and death and after, Life eternal, Sapphire pavements and the domes of opal, Life of blended music fair and fancied: Only lifeâwhat life might beâa vision! Then the Soul's way: lapse from sound to silence, Merge oblivious in entire ceasing In thy nativeness, the matrix ocean, Thou a spray-drop hung on slippery verges; Ah! the world's wayâthine to be no longer; Thine the soul's way, thou hast seen and known it! Like an empty tale the worlds shall vanish, Frail as dream, and life be quite forgotten. What of life-songs then, and what of death-songs? Sound and fury down the babbling ages, They shall cease, the echoes pass and perish; On the void the 'stablishment eternal Bides aloneâthe Soul's gigantic silence. BALLAD She died and lay in her grave of stone, Alone in her shroud with open eyes, And an angel came from the awful throne To lead her soul through the seven skies. He stood at her coffin in solemn mirth And called her spirit to leave its sleep, But her soul replied from the frozen earth, âIt is not for God that I wait and weep!â He sought her hand in her silver shroud, But her soul looked out from her sunken eyes, And the angel turned with his forehead bowed And rose alone through the seven skies. And she lay alone in her hearse of stone And her spirit watched like a sleepless flame, And her lover arose from a dream of moan And came to her tomb and spake her name. He whispered, âI come from the world of sin; My heart desires, my soul is proud; Shall I open thy coffin and come within, Or lead thee forth in thy silver shroud?â And the Lady rose in her awful pride, For her soul was strong with the wine of Love, And she said, âI have waited to be thy bride, Though God desired me there above.â And he whispered, âLove, I have come and found! I have died with thee, for my life was thine, And our bridal bed is the frozen ground,â If heaven is lost thou art wholly mine. âThe love of our lives can bear the frown Of God Himself, though our lives are gone.â And he drew her close while they laid them down Lip to lip in the tomb of stone. DAWN The swoon of night's delicate whisper, the tense wide stillness of birth, The holy awaiting of sound in the soul of the slumberous earth, The peace compelling our tears for the shame of the agonized flesh, Ere creation has riven its grave-clothes and come on the world afresh. The dawn that hath come like a song aflame on the lips of the world, The grasses' hymn to the dew, and the resonant wave that is hurled From the reticent soul of the waters, and about the death-bed of night Resurrection pulsating like music, and the heavens enormous with light. Dear God! how the pulses beat faster, as, lo! with the rush of a wind, From the labyrinth caves of our slumber we feel we have brought forth a mind; And the shock as the shock of battle, when our vision rends the veil As the sun swims in blood on the waters;â't is the Life of our life doth prevail! The exquisite fabric of morning, too pure for the spoken word, From the cedar-tree woven with twilight has uttered the song of a bird, 'T is the wild, pure pÃ¦an of pity, ever new since the world began, 'T is the sadness fragrant with promiseâa day that is given to Man! SUNSET The sea a great vague mistiness of blue, A thread of murmur drawn about the shore, The journeying of wind across the moor Even and slow and delicate with dew. The peace of ancient sorrow come anew, The resignation of a great despair And failing of all struggle into prayer;â The promise of a day is proved untrue. The choired sweetness of home-gathered birds, The tall gaunt shadows and the mellow light, The tirÃ¨d leaves that fold against the tree; Within the heart unutterable words, The pure compassion of the toward nightâ A day that dies and never more shall be. THE GATES OF LIFE Held in the bosom of night, large to the limits of wonder, Close where the refluent seas wrinkle the wandering sands, Where, with a tenderness torn from the secrets of sorrow, and under The pale pure spaces of night felt like ineffable hands, The weak strange pressure of winds moved with the moving of waters, Vast with their solitude, sad with their silences, strange with their sound, Comes like a sigh from the sleep of the realmless Olympian daughters, Widowed of worship by time, at the feet of their father uncrowned. Held in the bosom of night, with the wind in my face, and the ocean Stirred thro' its tremulous deeps with the unfulfilled dawning of moon, As involved in the power of life and ashake with the pulse of emotion It waited, when slow thro' the void came the primitive promise of noon. Filled with the open avowals of nature, the choral that falters Only to swell thro' the channels of song like an affluent stream, Pure with old faiths of the heart that have died in the horns of their altars, Leaving their beauty to live like the memories kept of a dream. Like the fragments of immanent silence, like the dew of immense resurrection Falls the night on mine eyes, in the curve of my lips the fresh tears of the sea, And like rifts in the texture of life, like the soul in empiric reflection, Come the tacit and lingering lapses where the phantoms of Heaven are free. There is peace in the winds, the invisible pinions of dark, there is patience enduring In the native and motionless outlines of headland and forest and stone, There is love in the perfumes essential of earth, the old impulse maturing To fruitage, and calm in the star-scattered chasms where night is alone. I am drenched with the night, I am drunk with the wine she prepares for the spirit, I am bathed in her solitudes, filled with her proper immensities, mad With the perilous visions of realms that my soul, is it strong, may inherit, With the simple and adequate bounty of natural things:âI am sad With the solemn completeness of joy that abides in the centres of sorrow, The sadness of life understood in its prophecy, loved in its pain, I am alien to yesterday, held on the heart-beat of time, tho' to-morrow Return and its temperance fall on my zenith like colourless rain. I am urged with the germinal ichor whose functional vigour increases, Subsides and suspires and fashions the world to its purpose againâ For the sands shall be fluent with sea when life's tremulous episode ceases, And winds from the regions of sunset blow warm with the perfume of rain. The darkness shall furnish its delicate silence, the destitute spaces August with disseminate suns shall be heritage still for the soul, And old memories warm from the heart shall inhabit earth's intimate places, When the cool, kind fingers of death loose our bonds and we leap to the goal. Tho' life shall return to me, sadden me cinctured with sin and besotten With heartless immoderate voices, and state with perversion of truth, I have tasted the lips of the night, the caress of its wind, and forgotten, Alone on the bosom of nature, the days that shall wither my youth; I have felt with the manifold ocean, with the blind, blank, lustreless shining Of starlight, and tasted intensely the crude cold smells of the earth, I have put my weak hands in the large hands of nature that caught me declining Thro' colourless ashes of thought in the fear of perpetual birth. She found me and nourished me, nourished mine eyes that were thirsty for shadow, My heart that desired her blindly, my senses diseased in the strife, Blurred phases of mortal desire, my soul that replied to her sad, slow Power, her promise of ultimate peace thro' the strength of her life; Her life that is lost in its bigness and big with the primitive glories, Can it save from the life that is cramped in the dust-stifled highways of men, Can it open the gates of the soul where the vital commencement and core is, And the soul leave the centres of life and be merged into nothing again? Can life save from itself? Oh, Beloved! thine eyes overcome me, and longer Than flesh can endure is the kiss on the dew of thy lips and the flame, And the old safe landmarks of life are lost in its volume, while stronger It widens till sorrow and happiness, virtue and sin, are the same! For love is coeval with life and what were divided are one now, As we leap in the night, as we plunge in the well-spring of nature, and then The world grows coherent with musicâOh, haste! shall our Heaven be won now, And the manna of earth changed to food for the ultimate soul-wants of men? Shall life turn to death in the living? Shall we pass from the heart-shaken centres Of nature, the pinnacled crisis and powerful matrix of life, That project thro' the cosmical fabric, where the sea-meadows pulse, where the scent stirs In flowers that feed the faint breezes, the eternal progenital strife? Can we pass to the perfect cessation where life is a dream unrecurring?â Earth's divisionless ecstasy fills me, till my body is rent with the strain,â Oh, Heart!âcould the flesh but endure the full splendour of life and enduring Dissolve in the quiet perfection of death, without hope, without pain! MOTHERS OF MEN Weep, mothers of men! Out of pain ye have peopled the earth, And the pain of life is the pain of birth, With its sordid lust and its evil mirth, And yet ye have borne and must bear againâ Weep, mothers of men! Weep, mothers of men! The toil of body and ache of brain, The sweat of life at the end proves vain; Your children leave you to dare the strain, Your children return to you alienâ Weep, mothers of men! Weep, mothers of men! The hands of the world are strong to take The lives ye bear for the world's sole sake, To try their souls till they bend or break: Your children vanish from out your kenâ Weep, mothers of men! Weep, mothers of men! For a woman's lips, for the lust of gold, Your children's honour is bought and sold, Your children die in the dark and cold, Your children never shall come againâ Weep, mothers of men! Weep, mothers of men! The human heart is the proper sheath For the dagger of life; ye have blown the breath Of life in the world and it ends in death; Your children live and die, and then?â Weep, mothers of men! Weep, mothers of men! Weep and pray to the God whose scorn Has given ye life that men may be born: Hearts to suffer and eyes to mourn, For the crown of love is a crown of thorn, And your children return to you alien, Perish and never return againâ Weep, mothers of men! LOVE IN AGE It was never more than a face, An impression merely; a bit Of failing landscapeâher grace Just caught as the rain-cloud split And the air grew warm a space. And now it is many years, And I, with my thin hair gray, Face wrinkledâperhaps by tears!â 'T is strange how my yesterday Of dead youth reappears. I wonder if after all I've any right to complain! As the shadows weave on the wall, And we feel the wash of rain Through the light grown thin and small; As we sit and cherish the hearth, While the dead come one by one And mime their long-quenched mirth, I feel I have grown alone And cold on a living earth. Well, one of the dear mute things That climb up out of the dark Is this face, this moment that clings To life and me, like a spark That all the dead sunlight flings. Just rain-starred, blowing grass, The scent of the fluent air, Her profileâeyes like glass That kept a jewel, hair All mysteryâI thought to pass And she turnedâone look to me Carelessly, then away Out over the flat gray sea Where the white squall fled away And the light broke scatteredly. And then I knew that her face Was all in my blood; half-blind, I paused, eyes closed, a spaceâ And after?ânaught but wind And the clouds blown fine as lace. And thereâthe story's told; And hardly worth, you'll sayâ Perhaps to yourself: âHe's old And wandersââyet far away I know that the days were gold As the past says, âI shall repay.â And the memory, three parts grief, Is exquisite and real With a joy unlived; but chief, As the warm drops heartward steal, With a present strange belief That all we have been and done And lived and suffered and loved Comes back as we sit alone In the old years, sure and proved, And gives us the crown we won. And says, âThe living was worth; The little laugh, much tears, The fight ye fought on earth, All come in the latter years More real in a richer birth.â Ah! there's the old, old painâ I stand in the sultry air And think I see again, Dimly, her wind-blown hair Through the drift of seaward rain. A MEMORY âQuel labbro, ond' alto Par, come d'urna piena, Traboccare il piacer.â âLeopardi. I remember but half-aright, Through the wine, a cloud of hair, And her breast's dishevelled white; While a perfume touched the air, And her eyes grew cold with light. I remember the colour's play In the carmine wine, and round The hush of an infant day The viol's silver sound Burn up and sob away. Behold she comes to me now And I kiss her naked hand, For her sin of the lips and brow And loveâI can understand And praise for the good I know. Your virtue is sterile as drouth And vain as your chilly words: This woman is all my youth Of wine, and the clash of swords, And a kiss on the open mouth. So give me her lips again, For I care not if heaven condemn, I have set on the brows of pain Her desire for diademâ And life has been so much gain! AGE Art thou not cold, Brother? alone to-night on God's great earth; Art thou not cold? In years of old The simple, tender, rude, Strong love of men was thine, the fire-bright hearth Where now is silence of long solitude. Art thou not old? Withered and white in these uncounted days; Art thou not old? Thy tale is told, And quite forgot as thou, To whom the world flung out a moment's praise, Then tore the laurel from thy bleeding brow. Art thou not sad? Dost thou not feel the welling of great tears? Art thou not sad? How grave and glad They rest, the quiet dead; And thouâhow dost thou live in these dim years?â Thy heart has begged from God and starved for bread. Shalt thou not die, Brother? the chill is fearful on thy life. Shalt thou not die? Is this a lie, This threadbare hopeâof death? A lie like God, and human love, and strife For pride and fameâthis soiled and withered wreath? Art thou not cold, Brother? alone on God's great earth to-night; Art thou not cold? Art thou not old And dying and forlorn? Art thou not choking in the last stern fight While in divine indifference glows the morn? EVENING The strangled breath Of life and death Fails to a lost complaint and dies, And softer than sleep a tawny light Furrows with fire the dawn of night As the moon swells soft o'er the ocean's white Like love through the desert centuries. And the long-linked years Bring their large arrears Of sorrow and passion and great surmise, And I know with a sense of familiar pain That the dead hopes never can come again, That the lust and struggle and tears are vain, While ever the future smiles and lies. TO A WOMAN How shall it seem to thee when thou art old? When this, the dust in which I wrote my name, And I in memory's twilight lost and cold Have grown too unremembered to defame? Perchance that when thine eyes are dull with drouth, Thy beauty haggard, thou shalt think on me And cry, âHis name is ashes in the mouth! His name I speak in dying misery.â Perchance thy rage shall sob its full despair: âHe was more masterful than Time and fell, Weak in the world, to lie despised and bareâ In death a chord, in life a broken bell.â Or shall thy pride be mightier and say: âHe fought and failed andâPeace! the scorn was best! With his forgotten deeds the years are gray, And now his brow I crowned is fallen to rest.â My heart instructs me it shall seem to thee In no such wise; thy lips may praise or blame And leave the heart its lovingâthou to me, Thy cheek that withers, my forgotten name. THE END âIl sempre sospirar nulla rileva.â âIl Petrarca. I said, âSince Life is old with pain, Since words are cold and tears are dead, And nothing now is left unsaid, And all the strain of thought is vain; âSince joy by joy the dreadful past Is paid in agony of soul, Since held in life's severe control, Our shaken hearts are mute at last; âSince echoless and unrevealed, Beyond, the sad impending days Shall take us both in several ways, Thro' worlds of windy rain concealed; âSince we have stood alone and proud And paid for every joy in full, And living touched the flames of Hell And given life the tears we owed: âWe who have felt the wild lament, The voids of darkness, cold and pain, That base the life we hold in vain, That vainly come is vainly spent, âMay watch alone the myriads pass Their low and level twilight way, Where never falls the splendid sway Of primal truth that is and was. âThe balance only lifts to fall, The hemlock almost seems divine To us, whose lips have touched the wine That makes God's lips grow musical. âAnd they, who neither know nor feel, Are strange to us nor understandâ I lay my lips upon thy hand And joy and pain grow tense as steel.â NEANT âEt toi, divine Mort, oÃ¹ tout rentre et s'efface, Accueille tes enfants dans ton sein Ã©toilÃª; Affranchis-nous du temps, du nombre et de l'espace, Et rends nous le repos que la vie a troublÃ©e!â âLeconte de Lisle. I tell you thisâeach lapse of light That glares the world from roof to floor, Shall leave, as days that died before, This envelope of antient night. O Heart! this wash of fluent air, The ocean's calm sonorous stir, That floods the huge horizon's blur, Dissolves in silence, like a prayer That threads the still cathedral's peace, A rhythmic pathway thro' the grave, Eternal twilight of the nave, Whose silences shall never cease. The fret of youth, the sword and wreath, The flush of fame, the vernal smart, The human tears that flood the heart Are sparkles on the void of death. For every life returns to thisâ We are and are not, one by one, As zones and systems, sun by sun, Burn outâthe darkness ever is. Yea, life and light, the sea and star, Upon the warp of things sublime, Seem onlyâNever touched by time Old night and death and silence are. YOUTH If I must die, The earth is inarticulate to sing The dirge I crave: The sorrow of the murmur-laden wave, The sea-born wind complaining 'neath the sky, And round my head the waters' silver ring. If I must live, And feel the ashes of oblivion About my soul, Let life be fearful, let me feel the whole, Despair, and face the sunriseâif I grieve Let it but be the tarrying of the sun. SERENADE Sleep! for the silver dawn is folded still Within the sea; Sleep! for the trees are slumberous on the hill, The lark is tuneless and the crickets thrillâ To wake is misery. Sleep! for the heart of God has slept to dream A better world; Sleep! for the day is sadder than we deem: Perchance thy soul shall lapse along the stream The lotus flower impearled. Sleep! Oh, my Love, for I am open-eyed Upon the sun; Sleep! for I would the heavens were yet more wide, The stars more limpid, and that I had died Ere yet the night was done. SONG My Love, thine eyes have been to me Like to a bird that singeth in the night To one who waits the coming of the light Through the enormous solitude of sea. Thy beauty fell upon my mind Like song to one within a darkling land Who, with fear on him like a bloodless hand, Hears the large, hurrying whisper of the wind. My Love, thy heart is like a prayer To one who, dying at the gates of morn, Stirless, in splendid effort and great scorn, Sends forth his soul to meet the last despair. And oh, thy Love is as a road To one who waits in deserts of the soul, And sees through Life, whose waves of fever roll, The waking Sorrow in the breast of God. SONG Out of one heart the birds and I together, Earth hushed in twilight, Low through the live-oaks hung heavy with silver, Gemmed with the sky-light, Under the great wet star Shaking with light, we jar Lute-voiced the silence with intervalled music. While under the margined world the slow sun lingers, Flaming earth's portal, Over the lilac dusk spreads his great fingersâ Earth is immortal! While the frail beauty dies, Dream in the dreamer's eyes, All the good gladness turns praise for the singers. Hark, 't is the breath of life! Hush! and I need it; Northern, gigantic,â Questing the silences, herding the sudden foam Down the Atlantic; Leaves from the autumn's store Shrill at my desert door, They and I out of one heart that is grieving. [Silent, alone! Around the wrinkled earth] âOr poserai per sempre, Stanco mio cor.â âLeopardi. Silent, alone! Around the wrinkled earth My lips can feel the final heart-throb creep, While autumn fills the world with solemn mirth That freights the vine and gilds the ripened sheaves That summer promised; and upon my sleep The guardian oak shall drop its pride of leaves. Silent, alone! Beneath the sleepless stars This cloven peak shall stand against the moon In windy solitude, the whispered wars Of waters writhed in silver at my feet Shall hush the verges of the world and croon A sure compassion for my sure defeat. Silent, alone! The river seeks the sea, The dew-drop on the rose desires its sun! Oh, prisoned Soul, shalt thou alone be free? Shalt thou escape the curse of death and birth And merge thy sorrows in oblivion? Thou, thou alone of all the living earth? Silent, alone! I know when next the dawn Shall cast its vision through the desert sea And find me not, the sword that I have drawn Shall flash between the twilights, and a word Shall praise what I was not but strove to be, Saying: âBehold the mercy of the Lord.â THEY âOh sprich mir nicht von jener bunten Menge, Bei deren Anblick uns der Geist entflieht!â âGoethe. Their voices die and calmly leave This interlude of running rain, This solitude of heart and brain, This solemn pause and brief reprieve. And as their voices they shall die, Dim darkened spirits dulled with sound; The truth they never sought nor found Shall give their little lives the lie. They live for life, their needs are filled, And in their false and narrow scope They mock at dream and jeer at hope; Their foolish noise shall soon be stilled. They live and laugh and cease to be, They fade and fall and rise again, Their scorn is false, their praise is vain, They live and die unceasingly. They are as writings on the snow, That pass and leave no trace behind; They mocked the sun, for they were blind, The Truth, because they could not know. Have patience! Yet a little while, Thou, too, shalt pass beyond their ken; The stupid scorn of vulgar men May madden, but cannot defile. If on the fire-forged nether springs Thy hands shall base the work they do, What matter if the pure and true Be bought and sold for meaner things? For if thro' thee, whate'er the cost, Pure light may shine in word or deed, Thy work shall live; thou art the seed Of what can never quite be lost. So take no heed of all the loud, Persistent folly, scorn and sin, But, where the light has entered in, Look steadfast, unafraid and proud. They pass like winds that chafe the seaâ Strive on unvexed with fear or hate, For calm abides and consummate The Peace that was, is and shall be. TO A BUST OF THE MATER DOLOROSA â? et sur nos croix d'Ã©bÃ¨ne Ton cadavre cÃ©leste en poussiÃ¨re est tombÃ©!â âDe Musset. Oh, Dolorous Mother with the silver tears, That in the withered day of Jesus' pain Received the flame of heaven-inspired prayers Upon thy pale, ascetic lips in vain! Thou, Israel's daughter, with white arms apart On Death's dishevelled midnight, felt despair Weep tears of blood upon thy broken heart And tears of silver through thy solemn hair. In vain thine agony grew almost sweet With pity at His death, and vainly there The Magdalen lavished on His wounded feet Her lips' caress, her opulence of hair. In vain thy Son raised Lazarus from the dust, In vain He brake the bread and shared the wine, In vain they wore His sign, the meek and just, In vain He was a symbol and a shrine! In vain! Thine image crumbles and is gone, Thine hallowed altar is an empty sign, And these mine unbelieving lips are stone That kiss thy dust amid those tears of thine! TO PSYCHE Forespent I sat at the morning's gate And Psyche beside with drooping wings, And I moaned, âWe have come in a world of hate Where the song-bird songless wings.â And she: âThou hast lived in the fierce hot light Till thy mind is gray with remembered things, But between the stars the air is bright With a song no singer sings. âI have waited; mine eyes are liquid for thee, For thou who wert lost in the elder years; I have come, and thy passion's throbbing sea Is salt with tears. âToo long have we dwelt apart, alone, I in the shadow, thou in the sun; Oh, bare thy breast that I build my throne, For the storm is run. âThrough the violet lustre of my hair Let a sleep steal over my golden eyes And I shall forget the tireless air And the cruel skies. âSleep, sleep, and never to wake again, But ever to lapse from dream to dream And taste the joy that is near to pain, Where the worlds not are but seem. âI am thy soul, God's child am I, And the day when thy mighty mind turns small In the simple nearness of the sky, I shall wake and hear thee call. âMine eyes shall unfold in a world of morn, Through the gates of night by music blown We shall watch dissolve the world's great scornâ On the breast of God, alone.â THE WILL âWas jeder im innersten Will, das muss er sein und was jeder ist, das Will er eben.ââ Schopenhauer. It sprang from the brows of a star And it lives with the life of the world, It appeared like the lightning of God Through the dust of eternity hurled. And much as a luminous thought May shine through the dusk of a dream, It awoke in the childhood of light And crimsoned the twilight with gleam. It arose in the first blade of grass That brake the stone mountains apart, And it budded and blossomed and bloomed Till it stirred in the human heart. And the centuries freighted with life Have trembled at touch of its flame, And lips where its lyric was warm Have laboured to give it a name. It inspires the voices of birds, The dÃ¦dalian tremor of earth, When the passion of increate spring Moves the heart to ineffable mirth. It suspires in scent from the rose And in midsummer's satiate rest; It is rich through the veins of the world, Like milk in a woman's deep breast. It burdens thy murmurous lips When love in thy spirit is warmâ My lover the sea, it is thou As it thrones in thy splendour of storm. 'T is the pride of the arm and the loin That thrives in the sinews of war, And puts forth in the whiteness of death Like life in the dawn of a star. And though life is grown tired and old, And the treasures of heart and of soul Are sold for a handful of coin, It stirs with a vital control In man and in woman and earth, As on Sappho's lips haunted with flame, Or as under the hand of the Christ It burnedâit is ever the same. And while ever the sunrise returns It shall still be the power that can Make the heart to grow pallid with love Or a man die the death of a man. TUCKANUCK I I am content to live the patient day: The wind sea-laden loiters to the land And on the glittering gold of naked sand The eternity of blue sea pales to spray. In such a world we have no need to pray; The holy voices of the sea and air Are sacramental, like a mighty prayer In which the earth has dreamed its tears away. We row across the waters' fluent gold And age seems blessÃ¨d, for the world is old. Softly we take from Nature's open palm The dower of the sunset and the sky, And dream an Eastern dream, starred by the cry Of sea-birds homing through the mighty calm. II Thou art the dwelling of unshadowed sun That spills its metal on the furrowed tide And vivid grasses when the winds have died In threads of murmur round the noontide spun. The cerements of flesh are like a rose Caressed with light, whose petals, one by one Unfolding, loose the soul to die upon The ocean of the air that ebbs and flows. Perchance the truth is nearer than we deem, That after grievous pilgrimage and dearth The soul shall wake and find it close beside; And see, as visioned in a perfect dream, The pitiful grave spirit of the earth, A patient presence sitting at God's side. III I know it never shall come again, This present peace of the great grave sea And the land that laughs in its sheen of rain, This friendship of nature to you and me, While Autumn smiles on us, big and sane. It never shall come though our love abide, And this very whisper stirs the grass, While clear and far on the tortured tide As now, the sea-birds cry and pass In years that shall come when our day has died. It never shall comeâmust we praise or blame If every day moulds the world anew? Better perhaps, but never the same; If this that we cherish and hold for true Shall wither and fade to an empty name? 'T is the woe o' the world! As the moments fly I war with time in a great despair, While the first shy star in the purple sky Steals through the dead day's golden hair That I love so much though it comes to die. IV WIND OF TWILIGHT âCuando besa Ã¢ la pradera La brisa que entre las ramas Pasa con voz lastimera.â âM. Garcia Merou. Gone the red reaches of repining sea, Thou, thro' forgotten twilights, and thy pain, Wind of immortal longing, fresh as rain, Wonderful, fresh and faint, O mystery! Give me again the languorous touch of thee Lost in the purple shadows, while the main, Intervalled, lifts its choral, and again Sorrow divine and calm thro' thee to me. Give me the steady silence: sea, sky, shore, Earth and her simple idylls!âAll is gone! All shall return, but be the same no more. Give me, O wonder! still thy dim dark kiss, Cool on my temples, while I bide alone And cling to youth and linger pale for this. PASTORAL Slopes of the sun and vine, and thou dark stream, Thou minstrel of the forest-gloom, whose roll Is like the passing of a natural dream Through depths of patient sleep To lend endurance to the taxÃ¨d soul. The cruel life beneath the cruel noon, Where men are quenched like dewdrops in the sun, Where haggard women reach to God and weep, Never corrodes thy silent solitude; But where thy sheer, green shadows shoreward creep Through the slow afternoon, The battle lost, the poem half-begun, Are chaplets that the hymning dawn-stars keep To grace the splendid hope our youth imbued. The twilight flowers close And down the shadow falls a timid star; Afar The sigh and silence of a changing wind, The perfume of a dying roseâ Beyond the senses and beyond the mind Dimly we hear a graver music grow,â Peace! Peace! the world is tuneful of her woes: With man's despair the richer chord impearled Is infinite of grief; we in the world Hear scattered discord, nor the broad full flow Of song until, waxed greater than the whole, Wide, from their slumber's mystery, unclose The vision-laden eyelids of the soul. FALL Nay, be contentâour door that opens wide On whitened fields this autumn dawn, all furred With silver imagery, the sudden bird That soothes the crystal air, the windless tide Of light across the world from roof to floorâ Thy heart can ask no more. The fringed horizon of the pines Is delicate with frore, And holds our world within its shadow shore, Our world where beauty fresh with dewy wines Sits naked at our door. Thine eyes in mine! The vineyard's dusky bloom, The garnered grain, are gifts of autumn's mirth; And now, while softly through the forest gloom The warm awakening of the good wet earth Suspires through the dawn, we need not fear The ceaseless pageantry of death and birth, The swallow's passing with the changing year. Our souls could say, âPerfection was and is; Death comes like slumber,ââif to-morrow's sun Should find us fallen with the summer's rose. This moment stolen from the centuries, This foretaste of the soul's oblivion We hold and cherish, and because of this Are life and death made perfect, and thy woes Turn lyric through the glory we have won. The morning flower that drew its petals close And slept the cold night through is now unfurled To catch the breathless moment; big and sane Our autumn day forsakes the gates of rose, And like a lion shakes its golden mane And leaps upon the world. SONNETS I TO SILENCE Lord of the deserts 'twixt a million spheres, Child of the moon-dawn and the naked moon, Close comrade of the whispered afternoon, Angel of mercy, whose absolving tears Erase the discord of our human fears: Thy lap is freighted with the dawn, thy heart Is warm about the sunset, for thou art The woof and fabric of eternal years. Thy hand is soft upon the troubled eyes, And, in the palace of thy sister Sleep, Thy peace remains when Life's last echo dies. Thou art more tender than the raptured breath That rounds a virgin's breast, and thou dost keep Thy kiss to lay upon the brows of Death. II TO THE EARTH The heart can understand, oh, Mother Earth! Thy tides and winds and seasons whisper, âFate Has held us dumb through centuries of hate, And tears, and blood for things of little worth.â The heart can understand, since Lilith's mirth Shivered the early echoes, half in scorn, The world-wide leap of light from every dawn, Day's dying pomp around thy blood-drenched girth. Across thy theatre pageants come and pass: The power and pride of man, a scenic thing, Frames forth his glory in enduring brass; And through his dust I hear the whispering Of lifted waters, and a blade of grass Breaking the murmur-laden breast of Spring. III ESSEX I Thy hills are kneeling in the tardy spring, And wait, in supplication's gentleness, The certain resurrection that shall bring A robe of verdure for their nakedness. Thy perfumed valleys where the twilights dwell, Thy fields within the sunlight's living coil, Now promise, while the veins of nature swell, Eternal recompense to human toil. And when the sunset's final shades depart The aspiration to completed birth Is sweet and silent; as the soft tears start, We know how wanton and how little worth Are all the passions of our bleeding heart That vex the awful patience of the earth. IV ESSEX II Thine are the large winds and the splendid sun Glutting the spread of heaven to the floor Of waters rhythmic from far shore to shore, And thine the stars, revealing one by one. Thine the grave, lucent night's oblivion, The tawny moon that waits below the skies,â Strange as the dawn that smote their blistered eyes Who watched from Calvary when the Deed was done. And thine the good brown earth that bares its breast To thy benign October, thine the trees Lusty with fruitage in the late year's rest; And thine the men whose blood has glorified Thy name with Liberty's divine decreesâ The men who loved thy soil and fought and died. [V Toward thine Eastern window when the morn] Toward thine Eastern window when the morn Steals through the silver mesh of silent stars, I come unlaurelled from the strenuous wars Where men have fought and wept and died forlorn. But here, across these early fields of corn, The living silence dwelleth, and the gray Sweet earth-mist, while afar the lisp of spray Breathes from the ocean like a Triton's horn. Open thy lattice, for the gage is won For which this earth has journeyed through the dust Of shattered systems, cold about the sun; And proved by sin, by mighty lives impearled, A voice cries through the sunrise: âTime is just!ââ And falls like dew God's pity on the world. VI FOG AT SEA Gray grisly tides that choke the master sun Who domes the caves of sullen fog with pearl, While round and still the sick white eddies swirl Between the smothered vistas one by one; Like ghosts the frail hysteric breezes run Aslant the ashen world, and strive to furl The slow drenched air in one enormous whirl And free the ocean's breast it weighs upon. The world is dying for a draught of air, Great autumn air that like a hoarded stream Floods the gigantic openness of dawn; And, like the whispering of hopeless prayer, The white world's voices, as if drowsed with dream, Sigh through the muffled stillness and are gone. VII NIRVANA I And shall we find thee? Shall the tired soul Toiling in gross dull clay, doomed to abide In blurred oblivion, condemned to hide Its eager wings impatient of control, And God-lit eyes that yearn to view the whole Of that divinest splendour glorified In earth's rare visionsâshall it feel the tide Of thy calm love in endless pity roll? Oh, let the inward vision drink the light Of thine effulgent countenance! Then might This immaterial dream of Thee and Me Dissolve away like moon-mists in the morn, And we could lapse in silence from the scorn Of Destiny to thy great unity. VIII NIRVANA II Woof of the scenic sense, large monotone Where life's diverse inceptions, death and birth, Where all the gaudy overflow of earth, Mergeâthey the manifold and thou the One. Increate, completeâwhen the stars are gone In cinders down the void, when yesterday No longer spurs desire starvation-gray, When God grows mortal in men's hearts of stone,â As each pulsation of the Heart Divine Peoples the chaos, or with falling breath Beggars creation, still the soul is thine! And still untortured by the world's increase, Thy wide, harmonic silences of death; And lastâthy white uncovered breast of peace. IX PASSING DAYS They walk across my life with great, grave eyes That greet my questioning hands with silent scorn And blossoms break upon their crowns of thorn, While garlands wither that their children prize. I kiss their lips and grow a little wise, A little patient, while my strength is worn Beneath the spur of each succeeding morn That dowers its evening with a fresh surmise. Their message dies with them, an empty word; But memory garners, in a wild regret, Their silent beauty that the heart preferred. And in the fire of hopeless love they seem So real with sorrow, that I half forget My soul shall wake and find the days a dream. X ON AN ÃOLIAN HARP Lure of the night's dÃ¦dalian sea-born breath, Wild as the heart's uncomprehended dole, Strange as the grieving of a mighty soul Touched with the lyric woe of life and death. Phraser of world-wide monotones that toll Like far enormous bells from sky to sky, Voice of the vaster solitudes that lie With life's solution past the mind's control. The golden eyes of long-forgotten days, The dolorous memory of simple things, Sadden thy lapsing chords:âthe present pays The past's arrears of sorrow, and they seem To wake a sense, among thy weeping strings, Of other lives, like some unceasing dream. XI THE SPHINX Oblivion like perfume from the wings Of dim Osiris, and the calm of one High soul, who thy remorseless lips of stone Chiselled to mock the resonance of kings. Thy proper silence, ripe with legend, clings To thine inert omnipotence, endures Though Gods and empires agonize, and lures Strange lapses from life's echoing, brazen strings. Thou seest new stars swing downward through the gloom, While on her dust, who smiled and ravished Rome, Decays the graven marble of her tomb. The fruitful Nile, the desert in thine eyesâ Dead laughter, and dead tearsâHow much to come?â Death, death, and fragile life that weeps and dies. [XII Whiles were, I almost seemed to understand] Whiles were, I almost seemed to understand; I watched the flooding waters with their fleece Of sudden foam, and felt the ripening peace And joy of increase that the earth had planned. Then the great shadow fell across the land, And in the harsh monotony of wind I felt the past like Death about my mind, And mild with grief put forth mine idle hand. There was the question: each day should I be What yesterday I was not, and for me Of my dead self but memory remain? And when upon my nakedness the snow Had spread its silence, should I wake and know, Or sleeping, dream another life as vain? XIII TO THE MEMORY OF W. H. P. Life may not perish though the winds of death Whine shrilly through the world, where we alone Crouch in the trodden dust, and feel the moan Of ancient sorrow burthening our breath. The blade endureth, though it break the sheath; Life springs and ceases in oblivion, Gathered and scattered by the master sun Like rain upon the waters calm beneath. We wait like corpses in a charnel-house, And singly, as the shrouded years return, They loose the cere-cloth on our furrowed brows; And one departs in splendour through the tomb, We hear the voice of Cherubim, and turn Weeping like children in the intenser gloom. XIV INSOMNIA To wake upon the shrouded, budding sky And sudden silenceâwake and lie alone In the gigantic solitude, and groan To feel the sting of light upon the eye. To wake and wait until the senses cryâ Knowing the sun shall smite upon the sea, And rouse the tragic day that is to be, Grief-haunted by the days that have gone by. To wake, and wait, and lie alone, and know That through the mist of grim familiar pain The world is perfect music even now; To strive and catch the master-hand that pearled The night with song, and feel, across the rain, A sadness as the sadness of the world. [XV I stood upon the old Earth's breast and gazed] I stood upon the old Earth's breast and gazed To where the seaward sand was gray with brine, And heard a song-bird weeping in a pine, Beneath the iron heaven, bent and crazed. The sea was like an eye that death had glazed; Amid gray light blown round the ragged marge The fallen sun hung lustreless and large And one thin trace of lifeless waters blazed. I strove to feel God's pity for His men, As, in the Galilean dawn, the love Of Jesu widened on the human ken:â In vain! I watched my fated evening go Heart-broken beyond tears and round me move The strength and sorrow of the life I know. [XVI Our lips are laughing while our eyes are wet] Our lips are laughing while our eyes are wet; The happiness we hope, the grief we fear, The stress and anguish that our moments bear, Are trivial shadows that our lives forget. The day's despairing toil and passion's fret Evanish utterly like empty words; What was has never been; the past affords Only a heritage of divine regret. But whiles the sorrow of a sleeping face Awakes a deeper pity not our own, Or when the soul in Beauty's large embrace Forsakes its margined slumber, we may grow To greater moments, when we stand alone And feel that life is sadder than we know. XVII THE GATE OF DREAMS The Gate of Dreams, where, time and time again, Through sleep transfigured with a nameless light, Fearful, upon the tired end of night, I come as might a devote to his fane. The Gate of Dreams, of melancholy pain, Flooding the drowsy labyrinthine soul With faces of despair or patient doleâ The tragic children of a weary brain. The Gate of Dreams, where throbs a ghostly wail, As it were of sobbing strings and wild accords, Where life is scenic in the smile of fate; Where faces, shrouded in an iron veil, Pass outward in a woe too great for words, Or weep in haggard terror, weep and wait. XVIII TO GIACOMO LEOPARDI Despair is musical, the wings of pain Are stirred in rhythm of large winds that bear A mute divinity of human prayer And human sorrow that the prayer is vain. The tears of speech that wet thy lips profane No Muse with discord, for the world's control Had never blurred the windows of thy soul Nor bound the beating of thy heart with chain. But we have piled the gates of sun with dust, And in the jangling darkness of the earth, With muffled hearts, exist because we must. Our times are blasphemous: no tears, no shame, But heaven insulted with an evil mirth And greed exalted with a sacred name. XIX TO J. T. S. After reading âAmis et Amile.â And were they friends as thou and I are friends That take the wind of sorrow open-eyed, And, striving sunward though the storms divide, Stand, speak and break amid the press that bends? We ache to life and bear the dower it sends Of Godless temples and of rusted sword, With ashes of the heart the heavens scored, Arched o'er a world unholy in its ends. Was their love more than ours, being impearled With sacrifice of blood and wife and child? Ah! they, who walked the sunshine of the world And heard grave angels speaking through a dream, Had never their unlaurelled brows defiled, Nor strove to stem the world's enormous stream. XX TO THE CHILDREN OF THE MUSE âNel secol tetro e in questo aer nefando.â âL. None shall put forth a hand and twist the brass That galls the neck of Liberty, none dare Avert the iron stigma of despair And show our eyes how good the battle was. Yet now for you who, 'mid the blowing grass That hides the grave of honour, sit and stare In the great muteness of forgotten prayerâ The vengeance of the Lord has come to pass! They fester in their cities who have scarred The face of earth until her skeleton Is naked, and her breasts are dry and hard; Say, shall ye tear the world's dishevelled robe And lay her ulcers open to the sun, Or murmur soft, âThy will be done!â like Job? XXI L'ENFANT DU SIÃCLE Dim dying child be still and taste thy pain, Poor hands be mild, for no new God appears, And patient on thy pinnacle of years, Dark soul forego thy Godlike task and chain Thy longings; Faith has died and they are vain, And thou hast lost the power of natural tears, And memories that thy dateless childhood bears Have blurred thy living days like sterile rain. The soul's sweet choristers that once did toll Thro' God's immensity are fallen dumb; As when the accorded harps and martial drum, Thro' some vast palace where a kingly soul Has passed away, are hushed; and thou shalt come Thro' life a mourner, mute and pitiful. XXII AUX MODERNES I âDispera L'ultima volta.â âLeopardi. Only an empty platitude for God, Only for poetry a jangling nerve, Only for life the baser lusts to serve, Only a fashion where the function stood. Only a shadow stealing span on span Over the unmeasured whiteness of the soul; Darkness around the God-established goal That blazed before the innocence of man. And when the flame of adolescence breaks On some wild heart the world has overthrown, He stares as one who waits alone and wakes, Cheated of love and faith, his vision drawn Haggard and hopeless from his death-bed down The hard, gray, tacit distances of dawn. XXIII AUX MODERNES II When I have learned the accents of your speech, The splendid grief of silence; when I know Your acrid laughter and your tearless woe, And learn the shame of lifeâwhat you can teach; When dust returns to dust, and mutely each Grows haggard thro' the fardâthen I shall say, âYour foolish lips have lied from day to day, And life has reached the goal that life must reach.â And then a hushâand then a mighty thought Shall move upon the fabric of your lives As thro' a tavern window looms the dawn; And in your tarnished tinsel, in the scorn Of guttered candles, all your lives have sought And you shall fade and finishâTruth survives! [XXIV Of this that I have written none is mine] Of this that I have written none is mine, Save only as my clouded sense has heard And blurred with ineffectual rhyme the Word Whose Virgin silence was and is divine. The veins of God are filled with golden wine Perturbed with splendour, and this world we dream Around our tinsel lives endows a theme Of musicâHearken! for its voice is thine! The Youth and Beauty of the earlier earth Have never died, but on the breast of song They lie like flowersâ't is we that agonize! And in the gray senescence of our birth Erase the soul whose voice condemns the wrong, And move our fingers through the dust we prize. XXV TO A STATUE Deep Soul that may not hold the brazen mould, Spirit whose silence bideth to the moon, Thou Goddess of the closing afternoon, Who gazeth where the tidal air is coldâ Thine eyes have watched beyond the stars grown gold, That polar silence where the shrouded spheres Stir slightly through the mist of little years, For thou wert never born, nor young, nor old. Goddess without a shrine to bear the prayer Of thy few faithful, whose despair has won A mourning fillet for thy solemn hair: The soul shall hear thee sigh beyond the cry Of Time, and fallen headlong from the sun, Shall find thy pity in the vaster sky. XXVI A DREAM I dreamed the world of noon was stricken blind: A sun, so haggard that it starved the air, Scarcely sufficed to light the stark despair Of tearless millions shrieking to the wind. Then, leering on the world, a hellish mind Drawn in a hearse, raved silently of pain; The voices died and silence laid the strain Of unforgotten anguish on mankind. Upon their bones the flesh of men grew gray, All nature withered in a wild regret, And maddened whispers scared the ashy sun: âNo more,â they moaned, âmen's hearts, like drops of spray, Shall touch their ocean, mingle and forgetâ This is the burial of oblivion!â XXVII âELI! ELI! LAMA SABACTHANI!â The glare of Hell it was, the haggard light, And tragic to His ears, from Galilee, Like wailing children sobbed His native sea: Then on the cruel nails He strained upright With sinews drawn as steel, and cast His sight Over the blackness, but He might not seeâ Even He the Christ. He plucked against the tree With piteous hands, and called across the night Thrice upon God the Fatherânone replied! The Heavens were void; ecstatic voices cried, âDespair! Despair! in death ye may not die!â He heard: the great sweat beaded on His face, The vital sob urged outward, and a space Rose through dissolving faith the Eternal Lie! XXVIII DANTE Thy voiceâall its least tones, the strain and stir Measured and ardent, and the mighty trend Outward upon a light-pervaded end, Gained through the fields of flame and hideous blur. Thou art sonorous as the shuddering fir Thwarting the tempest, nor thy metres bend Under their splendid freight, when thou dost blend Power and light and love to speak of Her. Inward thy flame arose and strong with strife Shone in thy wordsâthou art to me as life, Beaten, renewed with hope, and undestroyed. Thy voice comes pure to me as waters falling, Swells till it seems I hear the Seraph calling Through open spaces of the dayless void. XXIX LOVE I Sadder and more divine than human tears Born on the eyes to utter what is dumb, This simple silence when the heart grows numb Among the dead desires of perished years. Such silence quivers with the song it bears, Unsung within a fabric of old pain, Till in the dust of tired passions, plain Through wreaths of light, the naked truth appears. Then poised upon the moment thou canst lay Thy brow upon the Heart of Hearts, and feel The tide that ebbs and waxes through us all; Till from the silence, through the world's decay, A voice shall speak to thee like beaten steel, Lest on thy sea of sun the shadows fall. XXX LOVE II It flows thro' all of time from heart to heart, This solemn wonder fresh with naked strength, This source of life where every mouth at length Must drink and feel the old impulsions start. It is the whole that moves through every part, The aspiration dim of things unborn, The prophecy of life's essential dawn, That tears the everlasting night apart. And we who are, and were the splendid spur For wasted generations, we must bear For human sake the same gigantic stir Of breathless longing, and the great command Of life to life, and leave our spirits bare To feel the truth they cannot understand. [XXXI I dreamed of Thee, O Wonder, with the sheen] I dreamed of Thee, O Wonder, with the sheen Amid thy temples of a sanguine gem, And warm, between thy garment's purple hem, The languid passions of that Persian Queen Who sate with she-slaves in her quiet gloom, And felt the sob of fountains and the keen Perfume of lotus, and the murmurous lean Of windy flowers, and life's impending doom. O dream of dazzled senses and the pain Of conscious happiness! I woke beneath The dark maturing dawn, while earth again Renewed its patient toil for human sake, And felt the tender calm of such a death As thine, O Wonder, dream whose death it was to wake. [XXXII She came once only in a dream of death] She came once only in a dream of death And touched my face with wise, unhurried hand, And, âMan,â her silence said, âI understandâ The end is now, and quiet now, and faith.â And lotos-like and moved with tender breath, Her breast was calm as night and pale and bare, And, watching thro' the gloom of burnished hair, Her solemn eyes were deep, and tears beneath. And tears were on the lips that kissed her mouth, And only tears could speak to her, and tears Fell burning on her breastâthe tears of youth. And life, and evermore its weariness Was dim forgotten pain, the iterate years Were ceased, the roar of time was echoless. [XXXIII The low moon quivers on the hyacinth sky,] The low moon quivers on the hyacinth sky, And lays upon the ocean's glooming frown Its frail caress; like silence tenderly The shadow falls immeasurably down. A smouldering flame perturbs the heaven's girth, As might, in some great moment, silently, A sudden vision of the tragic earth Blazon the brows of God with mystery. And thou shalt come as the great shadow falls, Like the slow single star, and lay thy last Ethereal kiss upon my tired eyes; And I shall answer thee as one who calls Through the dumb places of the haunted past, Drinking its fulness ere the moment dies. [XXXIV Tell me again, and then lift up to me] Tell me again, and then lift up to me Those frail white arms of thine and touch my face, And wrap me wholly in thine eyes' embrace, Till God's sure hand run fire round me and thee. Tell me again, and let thy speaking be A faint phrased echo, delicate as lace, Of seas sonorous through the void of space, The low, lost rhythm of immensity. Tell me again, and where thy breasts divide Pillow my wearinessâthe breath of fall Shall blow crisp, crimson leaves upon thy hair; Thy presence is as where a song has died, And left its memory grieving over all This vital solitude of autumn air. [XXXV Give me thy pitiful, soft-moulded hand] Give me thy pitiful, soft-moulded hand, And we will bide in silence, Thou and I; Within the choirÃ¨d poem of the sky Thine is the voice I cannot understand. Give me thy hand and let the heart command: My mind is blurred, and yet I seem to know Darkly what men have spoken of, and now The Word itself their lips have never spanned, Nor I shall ever speak it, nor shall they That illustrate to-morrow with their birth; The tongue is tetheredâwe can just obey; And from the gates of sunrise issue dumb, Illuminedâwhile the spirit of the earth Reveals her secret, knowing we have come. [XXXVI If I have touched thy heart, as Solomon] If I have touched thy heart, as Solomon, When seemed the world dissolving in a kiss, Upon the pages wonder-white with prayer With lyric fingers laid his rose of song; And if the most I am is justâa man, Why yet, BelovÃ¨d, in that I am thine, I must not ask forgiveness; this I write Is all and more than I can say I am; Like veilÃ¨d music through the threadbare words Thy heart is beating even now, for I Have seen the morning quicken through its sleep In cycles of dim song. Thou canst not say What I have given is deserving scorn, For I have naught to give that is not Thine. XXXVII TOO SOON His wordless voice was like a toiling dream; I waited, stupid in my wasted hope, And felt the winds, beneath the heavens cope, Stir like the pulse of some vast gradual stream. This was the end. I heard again his scream Of perfect fear, and felt about me furled The naked hate of all the living world:â God's eyes looked into mine nor were supreme! The crawling fear had thrust his jaws apart And fixed his lidless eyes against the wall, And Death held back the tides within his heart; I cried, âFor Pity, tell me if she lied!â Then came the hideous simper, and a small Mute whisper writhed upon his lips and died. XXXVIII TOO LATE While over all the sullen embers gloat, Silence, forgetfulness and only now The twilight of your hair across my brow, And soft my kiss upon your marble throat. Be stillâgreat visions through the quiet float, And while the wind is wailing at our door, And day retires in gloom across the moor, Time shall forget an hour and grow remote AndâHush! The fire is dull between your hair: My tear upon your breast your curtained eyes Have answeredâit is all the heart can bear! Peace! Peace! there's pity in the soul of pain, And now our lives fulfil their destiniesâ Hark! the despairing whisper of the rain. XXXIX THE NIGHT-WIND Echoless voice of few sufficing chords, Soft as the memory of a vaster rest, Secret as sorrow held within the breast Of one whose silence never stoops to words. Harp of waste waters by thy hands caressed, Chalice of musicâprayer and song and strifeâ Filled with that wine that drowns the ills of life When the last vineyards of the soul are pressed. Prophet of final calm where life shall cease, Cease and a kind forgetfulness of soul Fall like a balm upon the wounds of peaceâ Thy voice shall soothe the last and sternest fight, Threading the dark dim solitudes of night, Like life without a prelude or a goal. [XL And they shall say to thee, âHe died distraught] And they shall say to thee, âHe died distraught; His mind was crazed by dreaming on things past, And so he grew in madness till the last Sheer height of scorn he tottered from to naught. His hands were weak and idle and ne'er caught With strength of purpose at the busy world; Forlorn and proud he stoodâTime onward whirled And left the ruins of the things he sought.â But thou shalt understand what they despise, Cherish what they reject, and count the few Poor virtues dearer than the things they prize. And weighing all the evil they have said, Thy heart shall say, âWhat, then, if this be true? Be Silent! for he loved me and is dead.â A LAST WORD Thine be the last thought and the best, and thine These few, poor, fluttering words, and thine the whole Of life, that in the quiet of the soul, Stirs through the muteness of the Heart Divine. And in its silence, overwrought with song, Where, through the curtained chambers of the mind, The soul of thought, in solitude enshrined, Unutterable dwells, and pure and strong, Thy royal heart shall cross the wide-eyed dawn Alone, and find the unspoken thing I am Waiting for none but thee behind the sham Of rhymÃ¨d words where the poem's self is born. POEMS (1899â1902) TO W. W. I toss upon Thy grave, (After Thy life resumed, after the pause, the backward glance of Death; Hence, hence the vistas on, the march continued, In larger spheres, new lives in paths untrodden, On! till the circle rounded, ever the journey on!) Upon Thy grave,âthe vital sod how thrilled as from Thy limbs and breast transpired, Rises the spring's sweet utterance of flowers,â I toss this sheaf of song, these scattered leaves of love! For thee, Thy Soul and Body spent for me, âAnd now still living, now in love, transmitting still Thy Soul, Thy Flesh to me, to all!â These variant phrases of the long-immortal chant I toss upon Thy grave! OUTWARD Outward broad airs, the sea's unshadowed sweep, And larger voice on shores of lovelier lands, Starred heavens of vaster light and night with sleep Tender as women's hands. Outward the grave processional of hours, Each a discovered joy, a solved surmise, Days dark in bud that ripening, fall like flowers Gardened in Paradise. Outward! O throes resolved in mightier song! Splendour of nameless deeds, essential words, Merged in the large acceptance, in the long Pulse of the cosmic chords. Outward, where every word and deed is fit; Outward, beyond the lies of name and shame, Of sin and ignorance the cause of it, Life's prison of fancied flame. Outward! O heart, the secret solved at last! Love that enfolds, unites, and understands; Love like the sea, with equal waters cast On this and alien lands! Outward! O free at last! O steadfast soul Calm in the poise of natural things! O wise, How wise is love!âonly, beyond control, To pass with open eyes! THE VOYAGE Outward! Sail ever on thy mystic voyages, Cut loose, up anchor from the shores of thought! There leave in safety all the dull world's countless captives, Seek thou the freedom only thou hast sought. Thine are the prophets, thine the few, the poets, martyrs, Stung with the impulse of divine surmise; Thy chosen ventured while the millions feared and faltered, Realized the rapture, dared the great surprise. Outward! For, ever as of old, the deep sea's distance, Ever new skies to lift and lighten, lie Far down the dusk of day-break from the shores proved pathways Pathless to perilous eternity. Yea! tho' the friendly wharves are all aflame with faces, Yea! tho' their anger rave in foolish sound,â Outward!âTheir hands would hinder but their hearts are fearful; Leave them their fetters, Thou shalt not be bound! What tho' they cryââTime's hosts have trod our ways of life out, Roads, charts and lamplight,âours the valued prize, The proved!â Thou sayestââMy goal how dim, my seas how trackless, My risks how vast!â Then leave them to their lies! Shake down the sails to catch the blood-red drift of sunset! Haste! lest they hold thee slave among the slaves. Thou shalt be outcast of their laws and scorned and homeless: The sin the world blames is the sin that saves. Outward! The sail full-breasted swells against the night-fall, And now the world where blind men lead the blind, The world of laws and lies, of safety and obedience, The prize, the conflict,âall is left behind! Outward! O haste! The flushed fresh mouth of dawn is calling! Outward! O space at last! O light at last! Steer where the comrades wait thee, journeying still, still outward, Wise in a conscious and perfected past. A SONG FOR WAKING Ere the blossom of sun from the mystical bud of the twilight is tenderly, hugely unfurled, Ere the lion of light from his lair in the womb of the shaken, green sea-shadows leaps on the world, Ere the masterful mistress and mother of life is released as a child from the womb of the night, Ere the echoing bell of the heavens resounds with the rush of the resonant pinions of light: Ere the day is declared and the globes of the dew are filled full of the splendour of opal and pearl, Ere the foam-lilies dropped from the lap of the storm are as roses that blush at the breast of a girl, Ere the aisles of the forest are heavy with dusk and are sweet with the murmur and marvel of birds, Ere the dreams of the slumber of earth are destroyed and she utters her hymn of ineffable words: Thro' the drift of the derelict airs, thro' the wind-trodden seas that are windless and weary with foam, On the strength of the shouldering tides and the roar of the refluent surge down the beaches of home, Comes the dream of the darkness of light, the frail flush of the feet of the dawn down the ways of the sea, Thro' the measureless sound of the marching of tides where the steeds of the tempest rode fiercely and free! Comes the delicate rapture of crimson as mute and intense as the dream of a passionate deed, Comes the miracle faultless as fire and fierce as a heart where desire is sown as a seed, Comes the glow like a prayer on the lips of a prophet whose eyes are aflame with the vision of God, Comes the flush like the solemn delight of the love that can waken a soul in the brute or the clod. And the silence is rich with the promise of song as the face of a child in the stillness of sleep, And the pause of the perfect fulfillment is grave as a death on the midnight when summer is deep, And the joy is the joy of a woman, her love and the light of her face and the sound of her feet. And the calm is profound as the calm of a soul risen freely from life with his knowledge complete. Over exquisite wind-dappled meadows that cover the foot and are fresh as a night in the fall, Where the airs scarce remember the rage of the tempest and darkness is deep round the world like a wall, Let us forth, ere the skies are washed empty of stars as the wind-rippled floods of the day-spring run free, Let us forth where the welkin is stately with sound and the headlands are held in the cleave of the sea! Let us leap from the scattered sweet shadows of slumber and venture our lives on the charger of youth, While the sunrise is closed as the lips of a girl ere the kiss of a lover has kindled her mouth, Till the languid, low airs smitten shrill with our passage re-echo the thunder of hoofs as we ride, Let us press down the perilous ways of the present our steed tho' he bleed 'neath the rowel of pride! Let us press in the hidden wet ways of the forest filled full of the shadows and sounds of the past, Let us travel the fields by the River of Years till the ways of the waters are open at last; And our steed shall be staunch tho' he weary and wince at the spur, tho' his nostrils are purple with blood, For the craving of Soul and the power of Love, for the freedom of Faith and the friendship of God! THE GREEK GALLEY The sound of the sea, the sway of the song, the swing of the oar! Out of the darkness, over the naked seas, Our galley is come With a shiver and leap, As the blade bites deep To the sway of back and the bend of knees, As she drives for home Out of the darkness, over the naked seas, To the sound of sea and the sway of song and the sweep of oar! The scarlet stars swing low to the ocean's floor Made silver and pearl by the slow resurgent sun, And the waters break To a leprous wake, As over the sea the ripples shake Between dawn and dark, as for life's sweet sake The battle of life is fought and won. And evermore, To the sound of sea and the sway of song and the swing of oar, We sever the sentient silences With our wind and way, where over the seas The surf booms steady and strong on the scented shore. Over the sea's unfurrowed fields The miracle spreads and the darkness yields. O heart that breaks in the strain and stress Of sinews bent to the tempered oak!â The golden gates of the dawn express Sudden and soft as a girl's caress, A glimmer of grass and a flash of wing, An echo of prayer to the censer's swing, And the altar's pillar of purple smoke. And over the spray that the rowers fling, Wide over the tide where the foam-drifts cling, As the rhythm of muscle and music swing To the sound of the sea, the sway of the song, the sweep of the oar, To the crash and cream of waves on the bountiful shore, The spring breaks scented over the sea! With a leap of sunlight under the lee, As she dips her side To the masterful tide And lists till the bilge distills through the cypress floor. O, the lift of blade! O, the clinging and shifting of naked feet! The coil of muscle that stiffens and swells to the delicate beat Of breath in the nostrils, of blood in the brain, As the earth-smell steals to our sense again From the pebble-blue beach where the shadows lie wet and sweet! We have fought in the noon for breathâ To the sound of sea and the sway of song and the sweep of oar; Our bodies would swing at the oars in death, Nor the rhythm of muscle and music cease, Nor the weariness end, nor the sad surcease Of sorrow absolve us: but evermore Our bodies would swing to the pitiless oar Till the goal was reached, Till the galley was beached, Till we tasted the spring in the forests and pleached Gardens and vineyards of Greece on the plentiful shore! The flurry of foam flecked red as the dawn looks over the trees, And ever the motion of song and the pulse of ineffable seas That empty and echoless break on the exquisite balance of air,â And tenderly winged on the morning, a perfumed and delicate breeze, Where the scent of the sacrifice floats with the distant refrain of a prayer, Where the cry of a bird and the whisper of grass and the lowing of kine, Are borne thro' the thunder of waves and the smell of the brine. And behold! We are come, we are there, we shall pass thro' the fringes of foamâ To the sound of the sea and the sway of the song and the sweep of the oarâ And the galley be lifted and leap like our hearts for the rest that has comeâ A spot of sunlight rolls on the reeking floor! She shall shiver and strike thro' the sundered spray, And the clean, fresh sand where the ebb-tides play Be gored and gashed with her eager keel; And our feet shall feel The swash of sea and the crawl of sand As we leap to land And pause and kneel To the sound of prayer, While thro' the air The dawn expands till the shadows are passed And the noon is over the sea at last! With our women and slaves, with our oxen and vines, we shall pass from the roar And the sound of the sea, the sway of the song, the sweep of the oarâ And stand where the burden of spring on the brows of the hills Is heavy and wetâwhere the blowing of pipes and the running of rills Persist in our ears.âIn the warmth of the sun and the wash of the wind, In the ceasing of struggle and peace of the mind, With the wandering passed, We are home at last! THE WORLD'S TOO LONG ABOUT US The world's too long about us!âLet us go Far from the righteous and the ignorant, The vacant phrases of familiar cant, The trivial loveless women and the low Abortive men, the fashions stale and slow, The greed of riches and the crime of want! Come! lest contentment dim the quenchless fire, Come! lest we lose from life the magic spell, The power of thought, the ceaseless miracle Of day and night, the youth of love's desire. Come! lest we wear the livery, take the hire, And prove in virtuous platitudes 't is well. Come! lest we take the thralldom and the food, Accept the hire and kiss the master's hand, Or hear, obedient to the world's command, Our praises from the Ciceronian âgoodâ; Or feel the shame of being understood By those we know can never understand! Earth knows our bodies, heaven our conscious souls! The world is ignorant of all but name; Come! let us fear its praise and seek its blame, Take larger motives that ignore its goals, And blow a fire within life's smouldering coals To scar its social erebus with flame! Come!âWe can feel, dilate with endless air, The journeying seas, or watch our Paris take New moods of laughter, or the sun-God shake, Low down the Nile, the splendour of his hair. Extreme in joy, extreme in soul's despair, Come! Let us dare to go for sweet life's sake! Life's choice is this: the world or all the rest. The heights are lonely and the depths are dark; Haply too weak of soul I miss the mark And fall below the world's unloveliest Level of littlenessâI say the best Is mine, I venture life's extremest test. No failures quench the Truth's eternal spark! LES BOURGEOIS Be silent! Let them laugh and lie Nor speak nor heed but come away; In truth they neither live nor die, More vain than gaudy flies that play And perish in the vital day. By rule and custom, time and place, Secure in noise and littleness, They live and laugh and lust a space, Incurious of themselves lest stress Of truth annul their nothingness. Their borrowed praise, their hired blame, Their timid platitudes, their greed, The virtue of their hidden shame, The vices of their sordid creed, Are theirs to serve a social need. Their crime then? None! Their lives are food To vainer things, and they shall seem, Afraid of sin, too weak for good, Once vanished, like a stupid dream That never wasâand now my theme!â Be something, good or bad! Be real! They are not,âwe'll take issue here Against them!ânot for base ideal Or murdered truth, but for their mere Respectability, the mood of fear! A SONG FOR REVOLUTION Tho' the red-litten cities are shameless and the rulers are guilty with gold, Tho' the lips of the prophet are flameless and the shrines of the sacrifice cold, Tho' the shadow of freedom departed lies deep in the paths where She pressed, Tho', a goddess, She grieves broken-hearted for the children who starve at her breast, Tho' the forehead forsaken of bay-leaves is bound with a circlet of blood And the sweat that the labour of day leaves brews the wine of the mercy of God, Tho' we lose all the loves that besought us, tho' our children rejoice in their chains, Still we cling, as our visions have taught us, to the faith of our raptures and pains! And tho' Nations forsake the desire and the faith of immutable things, Tho' the earth be subdued for their hire who rejoice in the cities of kings, Tho' the whole earth be theirs for their pleasure, and every man master or slave, Still the sea can afford beyond measure the inheritance perfect we crave! We can pass where the sand on the shore is made smooth as the breast of a girl, Where the waves whisper marvellous stories and the tideways are lustrous as pearl, Where the crest of the breakers in onset subsides in a welter of blood As the flame of the sword of the sunset is plunged in the breast of the flood; Where the sea-splintered lightning of noon lies in the lap of the long afternoon, By the fire of the pharos of moonrise, with the faultless, frail feet of the moon, Over meadows of midnight where starlight lies scattered like dew on a lawn, Let us forth so we follow the far light of freedom, the soul's light of dawn! Let us go with the wind and the twilight behind us, the rain in our hair, With a star on the brows of the shy night in ineffable heights of the air; The wide waters before us shall whiten, the horizon that bound us be rent, And no longer our hearts as they lighten shall grieve or complain or repent! We have seen that the progress they praise is of tears and enslavement and blood, Tho' they honour with blasphemous phrases their crimes as the service of God; In their mines where the serfs they control press in their factories reeking with coal They must labour until they are soulless, and the birthright of man is his soul! Tho' rejected of men we seem friendless, yet all nature itself is our home, For we come as the last of an endless procession and sing as we come! But they, faithless and cold to the kernel, with their minds in dogmatic control, They have lost the divine and eternal strong joys of the body and soul! And we bear as our brothers before us the message eternal and new, The exultant, unspeakable chorus of the souls that are tender and true, And our word for each comrade is, âThee-ward all joys in the universe trend, If thou darest with us to go seaward, on the seas of the soul without end! âIf thou darest go forth from the phrases that cheat, from the laws that restrain, From the shrines where the high-priest who prays is untrue and the servant of gain, Then the light and the love shall not perish but endure to illumine the years, For the fire of rebellion we cherish is Promethean and ours by our tears.â It is naught if the loveliest spaces of earth bear the soilure of greed For a day or an Ã¦on effaces the purpose, the profit, the deed; It is naught if they bring us disaster, if they blacken the skies in our ken, But we weep for the slave and the master, for the stunted and loveless, the men! It is naught if a man be defeated, it is naught if he suffer and die, It is naught if he starve and is cheated by the greedy who pillage and lie, It is much if reduced to a fashion or bound in whatever control, His body is scanted of passion, or he forfeits the light of his soul! And we whisper to all men and women, âLo! the light is at hand, and the way, Be it strange, be it guarded with foemen, is broad as the justice of day; You shall no more be joyless or lonely, our secret shall amply suffice, For man's world is a fashion and only man's body and soul are of price!â THE HERITAGE O, say in the splendour of days that await us, the scope and desire of midnights to be, The fruit of what powerful passions shall sate us, what Truths more effusive shall make us more free? What new depths of the soul shall we seek and discover, what strength of the body, what heat of the heart? In the dream of the seer, on the lute of the lover, what secrets shall yield and what melodies start? Shall the days be more ample and florid before us, the large nights more pregnant of mystical birth? What fresh voices shall peal what ineffable chorus, what beauty revive the old legends of earth? The old ramparts of thought, shall they fall and be shattered? The old barriers of Love, shall they splendidly fade? Shall the heavy, heaped dust of remembrance be scattered, our pleasures by loftier joys be repaid? Since the rapture of Life is the longing that rages and Truth is the wisdom that kindles to flame, So the judgments of God and the laws of the sages, man's virtue and evil, his praise and his blame, Shall be fused in the Truth of what new revelation, dissolved in the floods of what limitless light? As we forfeit our hearts to what new expectation, what senses shall thrill to what nameless delight? In what wise shall the lips of our new loves grow fervent, what dreamed-of caresses lie warm in their hands? Than the Gods who made Sapho their priestess and servant, what lovelier Gods shall inflict their commands? When the altars of Love are heaped up over-measure, when the passion of love grows intense as despair, What embrace shall afford what unbearable pleasure, on what breast, in the perfume and dusk of what hair? And the elder grave Gods we have chosen and cherish, bright Gods of our youth that were sumptuous and young!â Must they fail in the light of new vistas and perish as fail in long twilights the pulse of a song? Shall perfections so distant they seemed a derision, the wild aspirations we dared not avow, Be revealed in a solvent new vastness of vision, attained in a mightier moment than now? Then what holier shrines shall receive our oblation, what visions reveal more ineffable skies? As we pass from the creeds of our old adoration what marvels shall wake a more pregnant surmise? What new virtues and sins shall complete and delight us, what tenderness thrill in our hearts like a song? In what paths where what marvellous day-spring shall light us, what chorus of Heroes shall hail us along? All the questions are vain yet the day never faileth to light the large dusk of the limitless past, And desire forever in all ways availeth to bring all the largess we long for at last; A new ecstasy wakes to a novel desire, to a vision more wise new horizons shall swell, Tho' we will to ring round the huge heavens with fire or satiate such passions they know not in hell! Tho' we will to be God all-receptive in heaven, yet our longing To Be is forever too small; We are more than we know, as we ask shall be given, to ourselves and to only ourselves we are thrall; With the sword of our will we may rend as a curtain the dusk of desires that wince and withhold, Whatsoever we ask for the guerdon is certain, be it dust or the dawn-star, God's heaven or gold THE PASSAGE Onward ever and outward ever, over the uttermost verge of the earth, With ever before us the perilous vista, behind us the laughter and light of the hearth; With the wind of the wilderness fresh in our faces, the rain in our hair like a chaplet of light, As the silent, low shine of the dawn, like a dew-fall, is sifted and shed thro' the raiment of night. And the airs shall be smitten in sunder Before us With lightning and voices of thunder In chorus. We shall pass over desolate places, strange forest and measureless plain, And the noon shall relent and the spaces of midnight be severed in twain; Over meadows that murmur with fountains, where rivers like serpents lie curled, We shall pass to the wall of the mountains, crouched low on the edge of the world: Till the last low ledge of the lea Makes division, Till the wild, wide waste of the sea Fills our vision, We must journey in morning and midnight, we must travel in sorrow and mirth, Onward ever and outward ever, over the uttermost verge of the earth! Onward ever and outward ever, over the uttermost verge of the sea, Out over the tremulous tides and the trackless waste ways to the wall of the firmament free, Fulfilled of the light of ineffable spaces, the echoless thunder of wind in the night, And broad in the burnished blue hollow of heaven the endless procession of darkness and light. For the fire of the full moon shall waken To find us, And the hounds of the storm be forsaken Behind us; We shall on thro' the vistas uncertain, having neither beginning nor end, Tho' as folds of a fluttering curtain the deep sea be shaken and rend, Tho' the sea, where the foam-rivers run white, be naked and weary and blind As the breast of a shield in the sunlight, or black with the scourges of wind: Till the great green wall of the wave Shall cover us, Or the sweet spring grass of the grave Blow over us, We must on till we fall in our traces, we must follow the dawn and be free, Onward ever and outward ever, over the uttermost verge of the sea! Onward ever and outward ever, over the uttermost verge of the Soul, Out over the ages resumed in remembrance, the priest's and the tyrant's relentless control, The puny divisions of evil and virtue, restrictions of men and commandments of God,â O, ever the Soul in all paths and all places where straying or striving the Children have trod! For the Great Gods who curse and defile us Shall fear us, And all men who hate and revile us Shall hear us; And the bonds of allegiance that fetter the spirit, the oaths of obedience sworn in the past, Shall be words of the lesson of life we inherit, embraced, understood, superseded at last. We are done with the Gods of our old adoration, we acknowledge they served in their turn and were fair, But we go, for behold! after long preparation what no man has dared to discover we dare! Till the Body and Soul and all time Shall be blended, Aspiration and virtue and crime Comprehended, We must fathom the sense and the spirit till we stand self-possessed of the whole, Onward ever and outward ever, over the uttermost verge of the Soul! DAY AND DARK Now the golden fields of sunset rose on rose to me-ward fall, Down the dark reverberate beaches clear and far the sea-birds call, Blue across the fire-stained waters, eastward thrusts the chuckling tide, Fresh as when the immortal impulse took the lifeless world for bride. Now the shore's thin verge of shallows keep the tense and tender light, Now the stars hang few and faultless, diademed on the brows of night, Now the moon's unstinted silver falls like dew along the sea While from far a friendly casement softly fills with light for me. So it ends! I reaped the harvest, lived the long and lavish day, Saw the earliest sunlight shiver thro' the breakers' endless play, Felt the noonday's warm abundance, shared the hours of large repose, While the stately sun descended thro' the twilight's sumptuous close. Now the night-fallâAh! I guess the immortal secret, glimpse the goal, Know the hours have scanted nothing, know each fragment hints the whole, While the Soul in power and freedom dares and wills to claim its own, Star over star, a larger, lovelier unknown heaven beyond the known! RETROSPECT Beyond the earth is sea, Beyond the sense is soul, Beyond this life a little sleep, Beyond the race the goal. I know the earth is young, And time a little thing; When first the stars harmonious sung Thro' heaven, I heard them sing. Full well I know that I Was there when chaos hurled Formless and fervent on the void The huge and pregnant world. Sheer down the endless skies We took our furious flight, Our wings of flame flapped, vast and dumb, Against the ageless night. Helmless and wild we crossed The eternal seas of space, And moored beside the sun and swung In our predestined place. Pure as a distant song, Echoed from south to north, The strange first dawn came grave and strong, Gigantically forth. The sheer black pinnacle Of sky grew vaguely blue, As down the cold, thin, empty airs The red light glistered thro'. And when the last stars died About the noonday sun, And on the enormous distance fell Daylight's oblivion, I saw green tendrils blur The acrid plains, the sea Suck down between the naked hills, Roaring immeasurably. Then day retired, night fell, Frail breezes shook the air; The moon showed large between the stars Her void unfaltering stare. Thro' all the perfect night Ringing with silver, I Stood in my human solitude, Wondering ineffably. Then, in response, I heard A voice within me sing: âI know the stars are very young, And Time a little thing! âAlways Truth waits beyond Larger and more divine: The immeasurable Past And light and life are mine. âFather, O Soul of Me! Thy scope is never whole; Always a new infinity Lies waiting for the Soul!â Beyond the earth is sea, Beyond the sense is soul, Beyond this life, a little sleep, Beyond the parts the whole! SONNETS [I Cut loose! Hoist sail! Leave the familiar shores] Cut loose! Hoist sail! Leave the familiar shores Of life! Drive out on love's enormous wind Far from the safe small pieties and blind Tangles of conscience! O set wide the doors And throw the strong arms open utterly! Go forth reckless with faith and unresigned, Thus only seeking shall you surely find The peril and rapture of true liberty! Thus only shall divine discoveries Stretch the vague margins of the conscious soul And fire the peaks of more inclusive skies; Thus may we burst the self-created bond Of sordid fears and hear life's surges roll On shores of truth that always lie beyond! [II Would I were hopeful as the tender leaves] Would I were hopeful as the tender leaves, Would I were faithful as the myriad grass, Kindling conviction in the ways I pass; Would I believed as every flower believes! The pale wheat springs and flowers, the golden sheaves Serve in their turnâthe Earth's religion brings Proof of the power and miracle of things, That none are infidel and no thing grieves. No thing in nature grieves and all things die; Yea! from their burial Life is born anew: O faithful grass of graves!âperchance when I Change to the earth's desire, my soul shall take Thy lesson of faith and joy and still renew My journey onward for the journey's sake! [III The earth is glad of travail and labouring] The earth is glad of travail and labouring: The flower the whole sun's kiss is spent upon, The leaves light, as of sea depths smitten with sun And musical with incessant murmuring,â Bound as a girdle, the strong sea's silver ring, Where thro' and thro' the deep, clear hair of night Stars tread the chattering tides and swollen with light Moon walks beneath the slow dawn's fervent wing,â Earth, sea,âto them the large, fresh, passionate deed Of life is glad and wiseâhow wise is faith! Life's harvest flowers, death sows the exhaustless seed: We probe the intention till the soul has won Vista,âawake at last! Yea! journeying on Equal and wise and free with life and death! [IV How long the impassive feet of Time have trod] How long the impassive feet of Time have trod The myriads and their monuments to dust! How long the frailest, loveliest leaves have trust! How long life urges in the reeking sod! The flower is witless of a master's rod, The sunlight warms the unjust with the just, The he-bird, joyous in his vernal lust, Carols in native ignorance of God. And, when the travesty of God's control And human reason leave us at the last Naked before the all-receptive Soul, Incurious of the ends of life and death, Numb with the monstrous effort of our past, We pray the bird for joy, the flower for faith. [V Most lone and loveliest star, in glimmering spheres] Most lone and loveliest star, in glimmering spheres Of twilight hung, as tho' the lids of night, In one liquescent utterance large as light, Let fall the delicate silver of her tears; Monotonous music mute to mortal ears, Vibrant as birds that cry across the bright Silence and thro' the distance tense and white, Where loud as life the incessant dawn appears. Thou art, O star, how like a conscious soul Leaving the shadowy shores of life to blend Deep in the lustre of its native sea! Or like, in heaven, the pure and liquid toll Of one unechoing bell to mark the end Of God's rule and man's infidelity! [VI Most lone and loveliest star, in glimmering spheres] Most lone and loveliest star, in glimmering spheres Has flowed, and murmuring, teased thine ignorance! How many a derelict from the winds of chance Has signaled some unguessed eternity! The passion and pulse and power of all the sea Fills the thin foam with fierce significance, And thro' the sea-moods, to the deeper glance, Pierces the same intention utterly. Still, from life's shores to sea-ward, can the soul, Glimmering in dawn, spread out a wider pool Of light and vision till shadows flow to flame, As one by one we dare include the whole Of human change within our scope, nor school Our hearts to virtue more than sin and shame. [VII Mine is the bellowing, all-receiving sea] Mine is the bellowing, all-receiving sea, Mine the long beaches blurred with drifted foam, Mine the blind earth, the human lights of home, The midnight shuddering, deepening endlessly. Mine is the world to-night! Yea! Mine shall be Vistas and vaster worlds, a certain dower, When after faith, free love and conscious power, Soul dares desire its own infinity. Naught can be asked or given for all is ours: Ours of all space the cold incessant miles, Ours of all time the full, unstinting hours; And ours the sea beyond, that round the warm Shores of our being whiles will sleep and whiles Breathe thro' the soul the epic voice of storm. VIII THE POET He comes last of the long processional, Last of the perfect lovers, doomed as they To live ever more lonely day by day By all rejected and condemned by all. Hands stretch to hold him, passionate voices call, Bright lips beseech him,âyet he cannot stay. Treading in the large night his outward way He learns how much the crowns are spiritual. His heaven is godless since his faith is whole; No thing but finds in him a perfect love, No flower, no star but buds within his soul. Labor and sleep, the warmth of home belong To all but him,âhe feels instead thereof His heart's blood smelted to the ore of song. ODE TO THE SEA Lure me, O musical motions of the sea, Thou of the cosmic heart most mighty mood! And breathe beside me once again, O ye Intimate whispers of the outlawed wind! And grant, O Earth of long maternity, While dawn grows golden like an infant God Who walks the young world's twilight nude and free, Thy latest child the rest he cannot find! Still as I sought thee soul and flesh were fain! Before the flower of sunset, one by one, Scattered its petals like a golden rain, Before the twilight clear as amethyst Covered my lidless eyes, within my brain Seemed, in the lasting silence of the sun, All life as interludes of uttered pain That scar the lips of Heaven's mute Agonist! I am the heir to Time's exceeding dower: Ease me, thou minstrel of the changeless theme! Now while the midnight yields the mystic flower Of moondawn, violent as a sanguine stain, Like love's desire that in night's loneliest hour Dawns thro' the empty twilight of a dream, Mend with thy music-threads of faith and power Life's raiment ruinous with surmise and pain! Moon-like the motion of thy rhythmic cries Has lured how many a sea of tears to flood! How many a time thy sacramental sighs, Swelling the daedal veins of silence, bring, In eastern chambers where the darkness dies, Thro' Death's half-fallen veil of solitude, Desirous tears, sad eucharist of eyes Last opening over earth's essential spring! Soon shalt thou feel the miracle of light Soft as the distant music of a shell; Thy voice that creeps around the world to-night Breathes from long vistas of deciduous years, Since first thy bitter waters void of sight, Sterile of seasons, on earth's valleys fell As fall like darkness in the soul the bright Burden of life's insuperable tears! Soothe me! For when the sundawn gilds thy tide, Poised like love's lotos on life's perilous stream, When flower by flower the earth grows open-eyed, Almost I would to God my soul were drawn Where body and soul seem nearly to divide, Till, lapsed from life's dark labyrinth of dream, I ceased in darker solitudes and wide Eventual silence of the ripening dawn. Louder than cymbals, on thy silver breast The gold of sunrise fallsâour loneliness Ends with the shadows and the vain unrest Of life returns like long-familiar pain. Grant me the soul's deep truth thy voice expressed, The power to live in human tenderness, Yea! tho' I pass, repass, and never rest Still bound to life and death's immortal chain! Then shall the seas of soul be like to thine, Endless in stately vistas drowned in sun; Then shall I take thy perilous call for sign, Then shall I leave the world's familiar shore Seizing the soul's inheritance for mine; Then, while the huge horizons merge to one All-welcoming sphere, O then the Ship Divine Lost in the daybreak shall return no more! ODE TO THE EARTH I O tireless earth! O earth of long desire! Old earth whence now the gradual leaves transpire, Earth of eternal seasons, let me feel The folded flower of thy returning spring Thrill with the urge of life's divine appeal! Grant me, O earth, the faith thy seasons bring! Thro' silent airs, from sky to sky, The effluent tides of darkness pour, With foam of fire against the sunset's shore; And now, as one by one the bird-cries die, Singly thine ancient silences redeem Spaces that verge a sea of sleepy sound, And, 'stablished thro' the immobile dusk, they seem Like song but lately ceased, while on the wound Of daily life descends the balm of dream. II O earth across thy sentient sleep, Like silent maidens, one by one, Meseems thy countless days, dead daughters of the sun, Their unforgetful journey keep. Meseems beneath the masque of night, Clear in thy dreams, their large, remorseful eyes Always are overflowed with quenchless light; While, from their cataract of golden hair, Falls an ethereal fragrance and their shattered skies Are swayed with elemental tides of air. For surely when the world is fain Of thy desire that never dies, Thy toil of child-birth stirs again The mighty legend of thy memories, Till, even as when the feet of Lilith pressed Thy fruitless sod and roused the tardy spring, Pale in thy florid sleep, thy daughters bring Thrills of remembrance yearning in thy breast, And this to-night is stirred, as one by one, Rain-robed or bright with raiment of the sun, Like some processional of barefoot boys, They move across thy dream and all their pain, Their gifts, too generous, and their splendid joys Seem like loved voices lost and heard again. III Surely as, when the firmamental airs Grow, in a warm and lovelier noonday, sweet With flowers thy fruitful bosom bears, Forth from thy vistaed memories flow Thy life's unnumbered days that tread with ghostly feet Thy large and dreamful slumber, so Seen in the truth of thine essential mood, All things that were return and none can die Save for the ends of life. God knows if I, Tired with all the task of time, Died at thy breast, my cold and pulseless blood Would stir to feel the essential ichor climb The world's wide uplands, or beside My cheek the winds grow warm, or on my mouth the sweet Savour of sunrise, or against my naked side The thrust of earliest grass, the chill of dew. Yea! even my mere mute flesh would wake anew, O earth of graves and flowers, as thou dost take The burden of new birth for mere life's sake! IV Grant me to know thy larger love! If I Alway must go, beneath the self-same sky, Thro' life and death and can no more depart,â Grant, if I wisely serve thy large commands, That rivers of thine own rhythm drown my heart! For now meseems my life is grown, Vain as a shattered bowl To hold the essential vintage of the soul. Change me from small endeavors crazed to win Mean ends for aims whose littleness is sin To moods profound, effusive, all thine own; Till, flower by flower I understand As day by day the miracles expand! V Now spring from seaward blows, anon The winds grow cold as one by one They take the withering leaves,âthro' storm and calm Thy lips are flowing with the eternal psalm Of moving seas, but still beneath the masque Of seas and seasons in their tireless task Thy mood is silence and thy gift is grace! Tho' endless years replenish and efface, Thou art as one whose soul beneath the test Of human agony and human strife, This restless interlude of life, Is conscious of eternal rest In spheres whose very scope is peace! Thou sayest that life shall never cease, Yet now I dream that death has ceased to be And life has ceased; Yea! Life appears to me A bowl of Lethean wine whose margin's curve Is burned and bitter with the eager kiss Of myriads tortured by the thirst they serve. While in my dreams thy natural pieties Seem as the phases of the soul that is But neither lives nor dies! And when at last my visions fade to this Level of lawn, and when thy silences Are mightily 'stablished, as the emphatic hand Of darkness stays the cries of sleepy birds And turns the golden breezes blind and bland, Then all my dreams, desires and words Depart and leave me silent with the deep Meanings of silence; thro' my darkened mind Light buds, as now, thro' tides of warmer wind, Stars blossom on the night, and life seems large as sleep. Then idly, tenderly, my hand Falls on thy flowers still fresh with happy rain And wise with tears I seem to understand The purposes of pain! THE JOURNEY ON I My lips shall kiss thy brows! Thy bloodânow in my heart perchance the pulse of it!â Shall fall upon my face from all the thorns. Of their dead lives who killed and felt the scorn, Thy pity,âall its justice, vista, faith, How utterly dim, unguessed, or briefly seen As tho' a starred night thro' a wall's interstice glimpsed or sea-view caught between the crouching hills,â When once, in some long-hence, prepared arrival, Realized and known by me, in me comprised, Shall round the soul's slow spheres and lift a larger horizon! Then all the strewing of light in all thy ways, (Now even I glimpse thee by the self-same light) Shall flow between our eyes incessantly; Then as my lips gleam crimson from thy brows And feel thy lipsâthe comrades kiss at last! II Long hence thou shalt acclaim me! In retrospect of mine how many a god!â Fauns, stream-side nymphs, in twilights of mid-May Shy hamadryads and reluctant ghosts, Ishtar in Babylon who trod Hearts of fierce lovers in her wine-press out, Setebos, Hapi and the phallic Min, Thoth with a mystic wisdom, Iahveh, Baal, Ra, and the glorious, strange moon-father Sin, Golden Apollo with the throbbing throat, White Aphrodite in the mid-seas blueâ These, and of all my mythic infancy the dim and elder gods, Gods that no legend hints, no indirection proves, I, journeyed on in paths by them untrodden, On seas unhinted in their charts, their indications, prophecies, After an age of years turning, resume, interpret: These, now with negligent arms about my neck, Grave heads against my breast, deep eyes to mine, Come face to face at last, at last acclaim me! So thou, Essenian of the later Gods, As these my childhood's aspirations one by one, After long journeys done, dreams realized, thoughts explored, faint indications proved, Meet me and mate me with deep, quiet eyesâ I knowing we all are equal Gods at lastâ And kiss my naked brows and send me forth Vaster by them, by love and knowledge of themâ So thou!âthe pause returned, the vaster task resumed, the distance measured,â Surely my soul shall find thee somewhere waiting then! Surely mine eyes, sphered to how vast a light, Shall tally thine, surely my neck shall feel The strength and tenderness of thy sweet pierced hands, Surely thy brows shall share with mineâwe equal Gods at last!âthe sacred burden of thy human blood, The while thy sad, pierced feet, in all my ways, Equally go with even pace with mine, by open roads, by open seas vistaed before us, still untrod, uncrossed by thee or me, As we together take the long, long journey on! FOR E. L. I She stands before me till the space grows void, And round her form the desert's sterile heat Throbs with the tread of strong, impassive feet And song in fanes She builded and destroyed. The tideless waters swell and fall, the beat Of sunlight thrills along her limbs and glows On jade and turquoise, and her even brows With myrrh and natron seem forever sweet. She, child of mightier days and larger loves, Stands like a silence in the sound of life, And recent things about her beauty seem Vain and unlovely as our human strife; Wise and ineffable as Truth She moves As moves a great thought thro' a foolish dream. II She moves in the dusk of my mind like a bell with the sweetness of singing In a twilight of summer fulfilled with the joy of the sadness of tears, And the calm of her face and the splendid, slow smile are as memories clinging Of songs and of silences filling the distance of passionate years. She moves in the twilight of life like a prayer in a heart that is grieving, And her youth is essential and old as the spring and the freshness of spring; And her eyes watch the world and the little, low ways of the sons of the living As the seraph might watch from the golden, grave height of his heaven-spread wing. She moves in the darkness of Time from the centuries large as her spirit; From the magic of elder religions when the epic desires were strong, And the old, grave glories that She, of the living, alone may inherit Flow back from the harp of the past like the notes of ineffable song. She moves thro' the trivial days in the might of the peace of her presence; And, sweet as the death of a child, in the still high places of thought, Her soul in the hunger of life is appeased in a perfect florescence, Apart from the shadows and dust that our little desires have sought! III Why are you gone? I grope to find your hand; The light grows secret as your tenderness; My tears that fall for utter loneliness Seem sad as sunset in an alien land. Old simple words that you could understand And only you, are striving to possess My lips with utterance and their weariness Burns with the fever of a vain command. Why are you gone? The large winds, seaward bound, Tell of long journeying in the endless void. Why are you gone? I strain to catch the sound Of footsteps, watch to see the dark destroyed Before your lustrous fingers that would creep Over my eyes and give me strength to sleep! IV Pour down thy hair between the world and me! Between myself and my exhausted soul Spread, in the dreadful vistas where my goal Saddens and fails, thy love's euthanasy! Fold me away from Time and let me be Silent and ceased from bitterness, be thou Tacit as childhood and thine ivory brow Thoughtless, and be thou tender utterly! Strength, give me strength to spare the futile tears! Give me the consciousness of something proved: Faith, wisdom, personal and briefly true. I sift the scant, earned knowledge of my years Like dust between my hands, and all I loved And hoped and dreamed dissolves and blends to you! V She turned the falling light to fire, Dull fire throughout her sombre hair; It seemed She phrased the world's desire, Desire that woke with fervent prayer Thrills of a secret wonder everywhere. Her eyes caught splendours from the sun, Vague airs grew warm about her face, She saw the fire-stained ripples run And sing to sleep the smouldering space Of sunset and sink whispering on her trace. Height over height the skies caught fire:â She watched the red contagion flow, The wide, wild wings of flame aspire Till heaven uplifted seemed to grow A huge, domed sapphire paved with crimson snow. Her lips were still and marvellous, But, like a lute whose silence sings, Her hand fell warm in mine and thus Told me imperishable things: She held my senses as a perfume clings. My mind was like an ancient town Of shadows carved in moonlight, there, Like dreams thro' latticed casements blown, The twilight of her endless hair Brought stately visions, sweet and sad and fair. Along the towers and walls of thought They hung bright banners flown with song, The crooked, unlitten byways caught Their fires, and, as they passed along, My dull, wild heart woke strangely and was strong. So fire fell back from sky to sky, Night deepened down the purple sea: She turned her solemn eyes and I, In wonder and in certainty, Still touched her hand and still it sung to me. VI Thy breast is stainless as a star, thy hand Is calm and white and slow and thou dost come Sweet as a long-remembered song of home Heard thro' the twilight of an alien land. Thine eyes are pure and still, they understand More than our thoughts surmise, and stately dreams Hover about thee and thy presence seems Calm with a ceaseless custom of command. With memories of thy face the ways of time Are splendid, and my hours divinely stirred With tremor and silence as of unshed tears. Thou dost resume, as tho' the sea's sublime Music were uttered in a single word, The warm magnificence of earlier years. VII O murmur and passionate silence of to-night! Earth of sublime arrival!âLet there creep, Like music thro' the muffled gloom of sleep, Tremors of Life's imperishable might, Whether from airs that range the steep starred height Of heaven, or where the delicate dew is deep On grass and flowers, or where the bird-cries leap Loud down the pathways mute and bare with light. Fabric of night, O easeful rest, O airs Kissing her cheek, O flowers that feel her feet, O Life, O earth's impetuous utterance!â We stand to-night the fit and faithful heirs To Life's inheritance,âthe power, the sweet Strong motive, and the Soul's ecstatic trance! VIII Star of the sumptuous dusk and silent air, Thou loveliest child and latest-born of night, Jewel that binds the solemn brows of light Swept by its lustre of luxurious hair; O star of sundawn like a thread of prayer Weaved thro' the fabric of a song of bright Echoes and passionate notes of life's delight:â O throbbing heart of heaven, unstained and bare! Thou, in thy twilight, art as tho' her hand Dawned thro' the glamour of a gorgeous dream; And as to me her loveliness is shed Thro' depths of ancient time, I see thee stand Exalted and thro' endless space thy beam Fall pure and steadfast on the world I tread. IX 1 She moves beside the leaping sea, Along the beaches fledged with foam; The winds go seaward wearily, The waves seem children straying home. The golden breath of day retires Between the crimson lips of cloud, She seems, amid the smouldering fires, Like starlight thro' a burning shroud. I say, âThe toiling sea is old, The function lasts, the form is change; Yon wave that falls in splintered gold In every drop is fresh and strange. âThine eyes are deep as fluent pools Of starlightâYet despite of thee The world despairs of deathâO fools, Behold the fresh and stainless sea! âThe sea that felt the loveliest far And eldest God of earth transpire, Her flesh more radiant than a star,â The sea is young and cannot tire! âThe myriad waters run in ways Where moved a million tides before, So you aspire thro' all my days The same yet strange forevermore!â 2 The sunset spins its splendid skein, The sea-birds pass with fearless eye, The daylight falls in golden rain To gardens of a vaster sky. I say, âLike some sonorous bell, Flame-forged to call for war or prayer, Debased to chime a vulgar spell And phrase the pain of vulgar care,â âSo they, for whom their lies suffice, Who fear the splendid task of love, Who choose the world and pay the price, Are dead,âtheir lives are proof thereof! âBut now they seem as something gone A long, long while, and I may stand And hear the calm sea monotone, And watch thy face and touch thy hand.â 3 The stars come few and full as tears, The dark absorbs her fold on fold; She seems a song of earlier years, A myth the lips of heroes told. She turns, the twilight clothes her shape, The sands she treads seem moist with blood; Measured and low from cape to cape Sea-music thrills the evening's mood. I say, âThe wondering-up of love, The float of incense and the gloom That warmed of old thine altars, move About thee like a dull perfume. âAnd like a ship of glimmering pearl, My heart adventures far to sea: The urge of wind, the breaker's curl Seem promptings of infinity. âDay dies and night along my trace, Thy hair, the gloom and glow thereof, Surrounds me, and thy solemn face Is dawn across the seas of love! âBehold thou art like sleepy wine In all my sense, and now at last Thy human hours of life are mine And all thy strong, sonorous past!â X Ours is the day of soul-despair, The glimmering faith, the scanted sight; But thine the dim, deserted night, And, dark as moonlight thro' thy hair, The stately, solitary air. Ours are the years of foolish strife, Of small desires and smaller gain; But thine, beyond the toil and pain, Inert, unstirred by death or life, The changeless Truth that proves us vain. Ours are the trivial joys, the tears, The toil whereat our lives are priced; But thine, with nothing sacrificed, The harvest of unnumbered years, The silence where the soul appears. Ours is a short, sad sentience, ours Brief time and then forgetful sleep; But round thy face thy memories keep Strange vigil, and the lotos-flowers Of Egypt scent thy living hours. Ours are the life and death that seem, Ours is the race, but thine the goal, And thine the calm, unhindered soul That holds the dreamer and the dream As notes in one harmonious theme. We damn and praise, we crown the few With power and fameâa fading wreath; In thine alembic Life and Death Unite: beyond our partial view Thy calm eyes know that all is true! Thy vision sphered to vaster skies, Thy breast that keeps, serene and strong, The pulse of earth's eternal song, Thy hands that stir not and are wise, Thy face of epic centuries, Thy soul that sees beyond the tomb, Thy faith of wise and perfect love, Thy heart that time is lyric ofâ They know thro' life and death we come Thee-ward like children straying home. XI Thine is the silence of a night of mist, Thine is the wonder of a night of stars, Thine is the body, a solemn eucharist, And thine the face, the eyes no shadow mars Save of thy hair the twilight pale as amethyst. Thine is the voice, phrased echo of the sea, And thine the mood of statues black with moon, Staring, inert, with eyes too tense to see, Eastward thro' deserts desperate with noon; Thine is the day-spring of the world's eternity. Thy breast is perfumed of forgotten flowers, Thy dreams and destinies are old as youth That thrills, in chorus of memorial hours, The longing and the laughter of thy mouth; Thy soul is proud and calm with long-immortal powers. Thine is the portent of a deathless thing, Thine is the passion of a mortal change, Thine is the loveâAh God!âto cleave and cling, And thine the lover, violent and strange, To tune the lyre for thee, despair and break the string, Lest song turn discord tried beyond its range! XII Thine is the joy of life's transcendent hours, Thine is the grief of childish memories, Thy footsteps seem to fall on fragrant flowers, Strewn for the feet of grave Divinities; Thine eyes recall forgotten pieties. Deep in thy breast the sacred perfume lingers, Breathed from the lotos that were wont to hang Rose o'er the sistrum in thy rhythmic fingers, When thro' the shrine's mysterious twilight rang Thy voice and all the unseen respondents sang. Thine are the powers of Gods that now are nameless, Still on thy face there seems to fall the glow Of fires that flared on shrines for ages flameless, Still where the diadem pressed thy faultless brow Heavy with gems, the dimples linger now. Age after age the myriads live and perish, Theirs the harsh conflict and the sordid gain; Thine is the wisdom souls alone may cherish, Thine is the truth that heals the essential pain Of time and change and makes death's conquest vain. Life is a spark the night of death encloses, Somewhere is sunrise if the soul is sooth; And thou in life's brief hour of thorns and roses Showest the fashion of a deathless youth, The solemn portent of a final truth. THE SONNETS OF ISHTAR âOmnibus incutiens blandum per pectora amorem Efficis ut cupide generatim saecla propagent.â âLucretius. [I I am the world's imperishable desire] I am the world's imperishable desire; Life is because I will, for hope of me Life is, nor all the dark depths of the sea Could quench mine eyes' light nor my body's fire. Fresh hyacinth and the violent rose suspire, The black clod breaks to green eternally, Sap thrills to parturition the naked tree,â Of all things living I only cannot tire. I am the world's interminable sin; Yea! In my power and lust beyond control, Things mortal wage the war of life and win. For me the slave defies the master's rod, And while the antique pride swells within his soul The man reclaims his liberty of God! [II My face lives always in the quenchless light] My face lives always in the quenchless light, Frail gold of twilight burns across my breast, The red dusk girds me and my limbs are pressed In warm, wan shadows deepening down to night. My hair, red gold on brows of faultless white, Inspires earth's children to my fatal quest; Youth's passionate face in mortal hope of rest Grows blind against me, wearying of my might. With ravenous lips men scourge my lustrous flesh And crowd the quivering dusk with nameless sin; Death takes them, still insatiate, from my mesh. Viewless, my feet pash down the one who dies, While, sprung aloft from earth he festers in, I watch the last-born laughing in mine eyes! III Once was my name as fire, and once my wine Once was my name as fire, and once my wine Flushed in the veins of youth, and once the strong, The wise, the lyric, leaped beneath my thong Of love and hailed me human and divine! Mine was the world's confessed desire and mine The echoing thunder of the seas of song, Priests, virgins, youthsâa florid, sumptuous throngâ Gave me luxurious service at my shrine! Now tho', bereft, I seem perchance as one Smothered in night whose memory keeps the flush, The fire and huge transcendence of the sun, Still, in the apostate world, my fight I know Is won, and still the lips of manhood crush, And still the pained blood throbs thro' limbs of snow! IV For me, the eldest and the loveliest God, For me, the eldest and the loveliest God, For me and for my equal happiness The woman aches with sweet maternal stress, The slow seed breaks beneath the reeking sod. For me the strong, swift feet of dawn are shod With fire, for me the flowers' frail petals press Fearless and faithful, and warm winds caress The violet sea-ways where of old I trod. For me the long, resounding years return With gradual seasons, and the stately sun Shepherds thro' void infinity his brood; And only thro' my knowledge man may turn, To larger consciousness the soul has won, Leaving his outworn body for my food. AD SERVAM SAPPHICS 1 Day through, night through rest never gave its guerdon, Life unfolded never its heart's rejoicing, Sleep stood wrapped in visions of endless waking, Pale and relentless. 2 Dawn spread fire, the moon with its meagre twilight Died, the trees grew full of fresh sound and shadow; Bit with flame the implacable night, the sleepless Shrivelled like parchment. 3 Day with dumb, white hours like scourges smote me, Drop by drop day's river of sunlight drenched me, Sight and sound day's weariness wrought upon me, Wrought as with iron. 4 So was night shed silent as sifted ashes, Dim and sweet the invisible spring suspired, Voiced with song, earth's passion of parturition Toiled in the twilight. 5 Over earth the shadows were shod with silence, Night descended ample and rapt and faultless; Still was rest withholden and, pale and lidless, Sleep overglanced me. 6 Sleep!âDark page unlettered in life's sad volumeâ Not for me thy cession of ceased remembrance, Not for me thy dreamless, impassive mercyâ Thou hast denied me! 7 Fierce as fever blurred with fantastic fancy, Night through, Life, with resonant lips convulsive, Violent hands and eyes of incessant silence, Smote and enslaved me. 8 All my flesh cried: âSymbol of starved desire, Pain of all pains weariest, thou hast cursed me Now with tears and now more cruel with laughter, Hurt and caressed me!â 9 Then I cried to Death with exceeding anguish, Prayed her thusââO, Angel of tender wisdom! Wrap my brows in infinite night, in final Folds of thy cere-cloth!â 10 Then dislimned Life's image; the brawl and babble Ceased; yea, Life, the implacable Life relented, Turned and, mute as tho' to disclose its meaning, Leaned to caress me. 11 Then I saw the shadowless eyes, the scarlet Lips of laughter, lust and of little whispers, Whispers low and languid with fierce dominionâ Life was translated! 12 Cried I then: âO, pity for me, O mighty Gods of altars white as the limbs of loversââ Then She laughed and suddenly, burned and broken, Soul was defeated! 13 Thro' me smote her silence of stolen secrets, Dear, too dear for words and too sweet for music, Till She grew, in subtle and grievous longing, Fervent as bloodshed. 14 Then I saw the glamour of limbs uncovered, Saw the fresh, frail curves of her body broken, Saw the mouth, the eyes, everlasting vision Moist with her passion. 15 Soul was spent, flesh severed with sharp desire,â Flame on flame the print of her paces smote me, Yea! the song and sway of her eager body Surged in my senses. 16 Long I lay immobile, in monstrous struggle, Endless waking, weariness tense as harp strings, While the sobbing pulse of her blood against me Beat thro' my body. 17 Briefly then I knew why the sleepless demon Life, endured with sorrow and sound incessant, Knew why all the veins of my body filtered Wine for her thirsting. 18 Even Death, the goal and delight of living, Wrapped with earth's thick shadows, the sea's dense silence, Death, I knew, as Life in the day and night-time, Paled and grew sentient. 19 She, I knew, beneath my unlifting eyelids, Dark with dust or blind with the weight of waters, She could still, with fiery fingers, sever Death from its shadow! 20 Yea! the cool, kind fingers of Death would kindle; Sleep is scared and darkness too weak to wall me; Naught conceals my soul from her soul's desire, Slave She enslaves me! 21 So that now my body and soul in grievous Love cry outââO God, I would choose her nervous Fierce caress, tho' even the wings of slumber Closed to enfold me!â 22 Tho' my sleepless hours like fire and fever Burn my brain and all of my body suffers, Tho' my soul is famished, my heart leaps out in Wild supplication; 23 CriesââO thou, Implacable AphroditÃ©, Thou, whose feet flow flame and whose laughter lightens Down the trackless ways of the heart where bright blood Burns on thy traces!â 24 âThou, of Gods most pitiless, sumptuous, sanguineâ When I burn out body and soul and perish, Let my cinders, sifted thro' some sad twilight, Fall in Her pathway! 25 âWhere Her feet fall, yea! and beneath Her paces Let me lie in dust and with dust be mingled, Thrilled as now to feel of Her flesh the burden Bruise me in passage! 26 âThere, tho' stamped and scattered, Her feet could thrill me, Yea! till flowers from out of my dust transpired Still to lure Her fancy and still to feel Her Mine as she crushed them!â TANNHÃUSER TO VENUS I have learned the inevitable destinies By sheer endurance of thy careless love! Yet with a human and so needful hope, A desperate guess, I dare confront thy will And task with doubt thy flushed divinity: Hear me! O Goddess, hear my last surmise! I have watched thy face and seen the seasons pass, And now I know that memory cannot be Where death is not nor any mortal change. Thou art immortal, therefore all thy life Is now,âthe hours go by and leave no trace! O monstrous thought! Would I could ask thee where And how they fare, the insatiable men, Lovers of thine whose blood besmeared thy feet, Whose wild hearts perished as in fire, whose bones Gleam white as starlight in the paths of time! O where's it passed, the strong processional, The young men and young women pale as fire, Life's desperate mariners who glimpsed thee forthâ Pharos that lamped the starless night of timeâ And sought thee even on death's engulfing seas?â Tell me of them! Thy brows are pure of thought! Yet had thine epic lovers of yesterday Lips and strong hands more fierce than even are mine; Their violent will and weak humanity Suffered as mine to feel thy deathless youth! Then tell meâfor, by heaven, my extreme plight Lies bare before theeâif such men who strode Young in the young world are lapsed away Body and soul leaving no trace at all, Then where for me, for me who once foreswore My sweet Lord Christ, the strong and stainless God, Is triumph or hope or any tenderness? Am I more mighty than so much of time, So mighty and so wilful of my cause That, by extreme desire, I may contrive To give thee mortal memory and pain and tears, Feel thy heart falter and reduce to death The fashion of thy memorable flesh? Is this my only hope? Certain it is My whole life, harnessed to thine endless task, Toils without recompense, a merest tool Serving the vast monotony of fate; Certain it is that through eternal time No death can make the sight of my dazed eyes Grow bland or cool my fingers of thy feel! And therefore, drifted in the dreadful past, I shall be left a derelict on the shores Of thine oblivion that bear, I know, Wreckage of all the years and of all men! Certain it isâunlessâO give me power And light! For in the midnight of despair I seem to glimpse the dawn of a huge hope That fires a pathway to my utmost goal! Not thine the power! I go from thee to me! Mine is the taskâto teach my human soul The vastness of the immortal mood and thus Lift my fierce life to immortality! O hope great beyond all hope yet not vain! Haply I failâyet I have known thy love And served with life the soul's divinest end Since the extreme of all things leads to truth. Therefore I am content. Lift up thy hands And pour thy golden cataract of hair Over my face, then kiss me through the coils!â The frailty of my heart that does thee wrong, Memory, and grief for human joy and pain Shall cease. Behold me fit to bear thy love! I will no more desire the sea-wind, cool At sunrise, nor the lesser joys than Thou: The clasp of friends and the low lights of home! TWILIGHT Deep in thy lap I lay my head, Deep in my soul thy words resound; Thy lips where mine so lately bled Gleam like a wound. Now, in the sad reluctant light The passionate silence of thy mood, I feel thy robe's perfume, and night And solitude. Till in the solitude I feel The breaking heart, the dazzled brain Pulse with a longing tense as steel And more than pain. More than all pain and all delight, All laughter and convulsive tears, More than all sleep in all the night Of endless years. Thy robe's perfume is deep and warm, The dusk is deep and sad and low: I cannot save thee from love's harm Nor let thee go. I have nor strength nor will to save Thy life from my desire or me. I hold thee, Mistress still and Slave Eternally! SONG I am the soul of desire, The pleasure, the passion, the prayer; O, when shall my love for thee tire? Beloved, thou art fearfully fair And I am the soul of desire! I am the soul of desire, I call with the tones of the sea, With the infinite yearn of the sea. I am thrilled with my love as a lyre Is thrilled with the songs that transpire For love, and I thirst as a fire For thee! For thy indolent hands and thy hairâ O beloved! thou art fearfully fair And I am the soul of desire! I am the soul of desire, O where shall I find thee? My love shall consume thee entire, My passion shall bind thee! For a day and a night and a morrow, Thy body and soul shall be mine Till the laughter of love and the sorrow Are shed thro' thy senses like wine. Where thy bosom is bare My love shall suspire; Thou art fair, O beloved, thou art fearfully fair! And I am the soul of desire! SONNETS [I Strong saturation of sea! O widely flown,] Strong saturation of sea! O widely flown, Far winds of fall, your litanies of pain Moan like the music of a wild refrain Heard thro' the midnight of a feudal town! Young night is lipped with jasper where the blown Burden of evening lights intensely wane, And, shuddering seaward from the tawny plain, Vague fold on fold the enormous dark comes down. Gusty and fervid as the sleepless sea The passionate fancies of a formless fear Spring in my nervous brain like monstrous flowers; The night, the wind-chant work their will of me, And thoughts like death-bells echoing far and near, Toll for life's lost, irrevocable hours. [II How many a life must thou the journey keep] How many a life must thou the journey keep, O soul, thro' sexual seasons of the years? O heart, how many a harvest of thy tears Shall life's sharp sword of unfulfillment reap? The breath of dawn shall blowâhaply with tears!â How oft, O heart, O soul, before the deep Darkness and still eternity of sleep Bring natural justice for life's long arrears? Ah! when my rose of life is ripe to fall, Pray God I sink thro' gardens of the sun Till the dead fingers of oblivion Constrain my heart, and there lie over me The tideless waters and the eventual Darkness of death's unlit, unlifting sea! [III Come home to me at last! Come home to me] Come home to me at last! Come home to me! Bring me thy youth of tears and great desires; Frail round thy tired head the music tires, The music shed between the stars and sea! While still thy youth is echoing with its free Love-songs resounding like a storm of lyres, Come with thy deeds and dreams;âand thro' the fires Of wisdom sift the ash of memory. Come home to me at last! Life whispers, âCome!â Yea! thro' the mist of passions sad with loss, Strong in the sumptuous dusk, the light of home, The light of soul where thou must journey, lays, While spring is sweet in all the old dear ways, A splendour and a sacrament across! [IV Hush, child! Be still and give thy fingers rest] Hush, child! Be still and give thy fingers rest, Thine eyes the darkness, and thy lips that press Hard on the lips of life with fierce caress, Ease from their hunger and thy guideless quest. Ask of the vacant eyes and stirless breast Of life's last angel, pale Forgetfulness, Peace, and release from thought's eternal stress: She, of life's violent, fervent Gods, is best. Peace, child! Beneath her hand the fretful flame Of long desire grows frail and faint as dream: The immediate life is alien to despair. Held on her heart seem life and death the same, And nothing is at all and all things seem, And if life dies thou shalt not even care! [V Then cried the song of Life: âThe flowers that fall] Then cried the song of Life: âThe flowers that fall, Spendthrift of perfume, shall return again Fed by the tireless earth and fragrant rain: Far down the glimmering sea the musical Lips of the dawn repeat their clarion call; Always the heart shall kindle to regain Love's young desire whose very strength is pain, For life is love and love is best of all!â Then breathed an elder music: âI am peace! Peace of the silent soul, sphered in such wise That no thing lives or dies, is pleased or sad In me, where hope and prayer and struggle cease! Wise with my light thy calm and steadfast eyes Beholding death shall not be even glad!â DEATH IN YOUTH Thy lips grow cold against the lips of death, And peace shall come:âbe mild and unafraid! Then, in the silence, like a tender breath, Life's bloom of fever on thy cheeks shall fade As now the sunset's weariest saffron slips Over the moveless pallor of thy lips. What tho' the lips of love are wet with tears? Life was, thou sayest, magnificent and mine! Youth was possessed of dreams, the abundant years Thrilled like the freshness of a native wine! Behold! The hope of life is death, the goal Death that at last leads outward to the soul. Haply forgetfulness shall come. Behold! Day is a dream that haunts the elder night. Still is the earth so young and thou so old, Mute with thy memories flashed like shafts of light Thro' rain-swept days forlorn with beaten bells, Thy memories near and real as miracles. As Life is stern be merciful and mild, Solemn with joy as Life laughs loud with pain, Silent as life is shrill.âO dying child, Be all life is not, then was life not vain Since soul proves victor when the fight is fought And peace returns, profound and void of thought. Banish the keen regret, the foolish tears, Salt on the kiss that burned thy longing mouth! Wisdom shall soon be perfect: all thy years' Harvest, blown ashes of the gods of youth. Now shall thy grief refrain, thy passions cease: Silence has come and in the silence peace! Thou must forget or else 't were vain to die, Death with thy memories is not death at all; Passion and pain and pleasure, thou and I, Life and its longings, must, beyond recall, Cease or unite or merge and death must come Like seaward wind that takes the rain-drop home. Death shall forget tho' life's immortal power That gave thee strength to bear thy human fate Suffer and strive. Thro' death the mystic flower Of soul expands until thy youth's wise hate Of life has utterly passed in love away, While death prepares the spiritual day. LULLABY Sleep, ah! sleep in the light of the moon, Sleep, ah! sleep in the shadow of night, For the hour of waking is soon, how soon! And swift are the feet of light! Sleep, ah! sleep in the light of the stars, Sleep in the lull of the viewless airs, For you wake to the world and its pitiful wars, The flesh and its sordid cares. Sleep, ah! sleep in the hush of the heart, Dreamless, forget the return of strife, When the curtains of shadow are stricken apart On the pitiless drama of life. Sleep, ah! sleep in the light of the soul, In the measureless strength and the timeless peace; Sleep! and be free of the mind's control In the prison of time and space. Sleep, ah! sleep in the endless ways Of the shadow of Death, in the cool, kind earth, Till the dark is dissolved in the golden haze Of the Dawn of a greater birth. Sleep! for haply a night will come Where laughter is silent and none shall weep, Where the Soul after infinite travel goes home At last to an endless sleep. AFTER DEATH She said: Where shall my Soul be comforted, My body be satiated Since he is dead? She said: Since he is dead Where shall my lips be fed that blushed and bled Against his lips, and where my fingers cling, My arms enfold, my voice thrill whispering? My slow white hands shall fling Over what secret, where, The shadow of my hair? She said: Because the Man is dead To Thee I yield my soul, Lord God. I thought he could not die Leaving the vistas of his life untrod; I thought the mere desire of love sufficed To thwart Death utterly, For this how gladly soul were sacrificed! Now he is dead I learn thy litany, Lord God, and tame my lyric throat to prayer. Once, for his kiss, my lips were red, Now pale with tears they taste thy eucharist, And all my hair he loved, my sombre hair Lies sweet and heavy on the feet of Christ. She said: Lo! He is dead, Lord God, my love is dead! Now, leaf by leaf, Summer is fallen, earth grown mute and deaf, And winter rigorous above his grave. In heaven the angels have Thy stars for choir and all thy sons for song, They live before thy face, Glad in the sweet suffusion of thy peace.â My love is dead; Lord God, I do him wrong, Where he lies hid Lonely beneath his coffin-lid, To pray thy grace in heaven, Nor even Can I by thee be comforted Since he is dead. She said: Yea! tho' my love be dead, I know that never sleep Has shed her shadows on his lidless eyes;â Always I wonder if the dead can weep! The desolate wind is cold above his head, The wall of night impervious where he lies And shrill with withered things that agonize As tho' his buried body changed to cries, As tho' he called to me and said: âMy lips are jealous of the flesh of Christ Thy lips have tasted in the eucharist, Yea, of the heavy strewing of all thy hair On Christ's sad feet! My hands are jealous of thy sweet White fingers cold in attitudes of prayer. My heart is jealous of thy naked breast, Crimson where late the altar's marble pressed, Where once I took my rest; And in the violent ways of love I trod My soul is jealous of thy God!â She said: The stars of heaven are white with song, The Sons of God forever young; Dark is my love, O Lord, my love is dead! Lonely beneath his shroud he cannot rest Save where thy lilies fade against my breast. Lord! it would do him wrong And prove me faithless, if in Heaven My soul grew pure and calm with God; If, in the ways of good he never trod, My heart were comforted. She said: I choose the seven Sweet sins of love instead! She said: Summer has died because my love is dead, Winter is acrid as his sleepless eyes. Yet shall the earth wherein his body lies Thrill to the season's sun and soon be riven, Till Life, desire and dream of death, Leap forth and climb the hills of heaven And earth grow violent with spring That shall fling On the beating of her breath Foam of fresh flowers to the stainless sea. She said: Like the eternal spring, eternally Shall love persist in my dead Love and me, And Life, the elixir whence all love is fed, Shall thrill between us so we cannot sever. Lord God, we loved once and forever! For both of us Love is more marvellous, Whether alone beneath the coffin-lid Or lonelier and more desperate amid The glad familiar ways of earth we trod, Than Heaven with all its stars and hosts of song, With all thy sons immaculately young, And Thou Lord God! WOMEN FIRST [I She said: âO take me! Let my life become] She said: âO take me! Let my life become Part of your pleasure. As the rose that leaf By leaf falls scented from the crimson sheaf You loved, even so, until my life is numb And bare with giving, till the total sum Of joy my life contains, to serve your need Is spent, till all the music of my reed Is played to please you, till you leave me, dumbâ So am I yours! to love you till you tire Of love. I give so little!âyet the whole: The best and worst of me, my body and soul! O take me! Yours the nobler part, to take Unrecompensed my prodigal desire That pains me and would kill me for your sake!â [II He said: âEnough! I take you and repay] He said: âEnough! I take you and repay Nothing you give, but waste your sacrifice; I let your body and soul alone suffice, Your fierce love's largess lure me for a day. Held in my power your soul shall cease to pray, Your lips forget their pieties to entice My lips, and death at last shall film with ice Your desolate heart once drained and cast away. Come to me! You shall utterly be turned Into my pleasure, till my satiate sense Sickens to see you, till your flesh is burned Dry in my service, till the soul you staked Against a careless kiss is lost, till hence I drive you, with the thirst you nourished, slaked!â [III She said: âThank God! Beloved, I merely ask] She said: âThank God! Beloved, I merely ask Sufferance for love and me. My soul? I stake It, swift to lose the bauble for your sake, To spill the liquor as I break the flask!â She held the cup: then suddenly the masque Shattered before him, and the woman, real And soul-transfigured with matured ideal, Faced himâdivine to meet her mortal task. As sunlight breaks thro' vistas grey with rain, The breathless truth broke briefly on his brain. He paused and felt her fail to understand. She, desolate, shuddered watching him depart; The miracle of love's divine command Filled him, the gospel of the human heart! SECOND [I âSweet from my sin I rise before you, rise] âSweet from my sin I rise before you, rise, Wild as the vision and savour of the sea, Bland as the shadow of sleep's euthanasy Shed between burning lids and aching eyes! Clothed in love's fire that damns and purifies, Mistress and slave, I yield me utterly,â Yours by the gods my love reveals to me, The gods my pitiless passion crucifies! Love for love's sake my body is born again Thrilled with a new virginity, my soul Lends my desire the dignity of pain. For you my lips are fire, my naked breast Profound as sleep and heavens of splendour roll Over me, shattered with divine unrest!â [II He said, âI take you. Yet the laughter slips] He said, âI take you. Yet the laughter slips, Mocking your sacrifice. Be still! The phrase Is vain since sense with equal joy repays Loss of the soul we crush between our lips. Where 's soul, my Mistress, when thy finger-tips Drip wine till candles wither blaze by blaze, And down thy breast no song can fitly praise Pale drop by drop the ooze of daylight drips? Why vex the mind? Why ponderââMine the gain Her gold against my dross;âthe sacrifice Damns in acceptanceâHeart must yield the pain Of Heart due reverence, give the greater gift Denial?â To scruple so were over-nice.â Drown me in all your hair my fingers lift!â [III âHeart to my heart,â she cried, âand mouth to mine] âHeart to my heart,â she cried, âand mouth to mine! Lie close! I feel you like the pulse of life! Desire has pained my senses like a knife: Lie close, that I may know my body thine! Surely the pangs of love are all divine, And haply tho' my ways of love be dark Their depths may kindle with the saving spark! At least my incense floats before the shrine!â âGive me thy lips!â he criedâand then his mind Suffered with truth. He said, âMy soul was blind!â âAnd mine,â she said, âtill love disclosed the light.â He fell beside her, âSpeak!â he cried, âfor me, For me the lovelessâwhere is hope?â And she Soothed him as tho' a child who wept for fright. AT DAYBREAK I marked the hours beat by beat And felt the silent night depart: I held her, dead against my heart, Beside the loud, incessant street. Across the daylight drenched with rain I heard the world's familiar strife, My fingers held the pulse of life That ran the shaking scale of pain. Her body, bruised with love's embrace, Grew cold, and where her lips were red The dawn disclosed them grey and dead: Her eyes were dumbâI kissed her face! I kissed her tacit face and laid My cheek on hers and caught her hand, And guessed if God would understand And find the joy of sin repaid! Beside the loud, incessant street I kissed her mouth and held her bound Between my violent arms and found Her mouth intolerably sweet. I held her close, Ah! close to me And kissed the scarlet ring that clasped Her throat, where all my fingers grasped And crushed her life out utterly. I kissed her lips, her cheek, her hand, My mouth was bitter salt with tears, And she was dead.âIf God appears I wondered, will He understand? THE FINAL WORD Hear me! I say to youââThis love of ours Can never be forgiven; nevermore Shall I, in peace and silence, pass my door, Sad with October sun and scattered flowers, Unhaunted of thy memory as before. âNothing is virgin where thy feet have trod The byways of my inmost heart, and where My Soul stretched flowers to catch the skyward air, Thy hands have sown with chaff the fields of God. I know thy love is loveless as despair. âI thrilled in soul, God knows my body fired, Kindling thy perfect body, for the food Whose sweetness proved pain sweet and evil good, Till Life could no more bear what life desired, Until the lips of life were crushed to blood. âNow there is no forgiveness. Go or stayâ I cannot care, my love has been so great! I am too tired now to love or hate; While hour by hour I see, and day by day Life's tears roll down the marble face of fate!â TO C. L. G. The old days come near to me like dead women with pale and tender hands, The gold of their hair shakes down about my face, And the light of their eyes is tawny and sad like the light of large, calm sunsets, And their silence seems as a fragment of eternity. The old days come near to me and thy presence is ever among them, The presence of thy childhood fresh and dear and dead, Thine infancy and mine! Linked in a living memory, sad as love and death are sad. THE SONG OF MAN O come out with me to the New Gods, I have fathomed the lies of the old, And the pillars of Paradise crumble and the ashes of Hell are grown cold. I have striven and lived and remembered thro' the range of the numberless years, Until strange as a dawn in the midnight the goal of my seeking appears! I have dared in the spirit's conception, I have shaped with the might of my hands, Were the dreams of my ecstasy mortal? Yet godlike I wrought their commands! In the twilight of temples I builded, by the flames of the altars I fed, I have trembled and wondered and worshipped, yea, bled as the sacrifice bled! I have blinded the Soul's aspiration with torture and triumph and pain, I have died for a word, for an idol, for an idol, a word I have slain, In the fear of a merciless master I have bent like a slave to the rod, I have turned in my anger and questioned of God and the judgments of God. I have minted in marble and music the gold of the heart of my youth, And a maiden's desire has brought me the feast of the fruit of her mouth. I have folded my love as a mantle over limbs that were naked for this, I have broken my heart on a lute-string, and bartered my soul for a kiss. I have lived with my boys and my women for lust and the laughter of lust Till the Love-Goddess, mortal in marble, was shattered to shards in the dust, And when Life unrelenting renewed me and the soul of me suffered for food, I have waked to a new revelation, I have canted of evil and good. I have damned and divided in judgment, I have 'stablished the bounds of my blame, I have tempted the soul with a vision, I have menaced the flesh with a flame, Till the voice of my God in his anger was like thunder of wind on the sea, Till I cowered and sinned and was secret, till I longed and was feared to be free. Till, too weak to face God in his heaven, too timid to dare him in hell, I defiled him with empty observance and I cheapened his name to a spell; With a blasphemy cynic with safety, with a cowardice born of my greeds, With the slime of respectable falsehood, I fashioned a God to my needs. I have lied in my soul as I muttered the prayers of the priests that I paid, I have lied in my heart as I sold it, I have lied for my heart was afraid, I have lied to the priests and the people, I have lied to my body and soul All the lies that the meanest of sins pays the meanest of virtues for toll! Then I sickened of lies and discovered in breathless amazementâat last Soul and Body, to-day and to-morrow released from the ghosts of the pastâ That, washed clear with the tears of my manhood, song-bright with the poems of my youth, Wonder-wide with long dreams and desires, my vision was trained for the Truth! Yea! the silence of time and its changes have left not a God that was mine, Yea! my fashions of faith have been faithless, yea! my heart has been drained of its wine, Yea! the lips of my women have withered, and for gold I have minted my blood, But at least I have learned thro' the ages all the lies of the world and of God! From the Syrian glades where the perfect, pale woman grew mortal for love, From the vortex of chaos with darkness shed under and round and above, In the depths of the twilight of Asia, in the myriad ways I have trod, I have tried all the fashions of living and served all the phases of God. I have merged in the spirit of Brahma, I have prayed by the stream and the tree, I have seen how She rose as a portent from the bitter, blue ways of the sea, In the name of the wise Galilean, by the sign of a merciful God, I have plundered, enslaved, and smeared over the sin with the silence of blood. My blood from the altars of Ishtar has flowed to the foot of the Cross, It has dripped from the dewlaps of Seket and Venus has laughed at my loss, I have burned in the gardens of Nero, I have died in the circus at Rome, And the wine of God's mercy I prayed for was meagre and bitter as foam. I have served all the alien masters still-born from my folly and fears, I have laughed till I wept in derision, I have wept till I laughed at my tears, And I cry, âThro' the range of creation and time I have tested the whole,â Then come out with me to the New Gods, the Great Gods, Body and Soul! âTo the Gods who are sure and sufficient, who are free and more fatal than Fate, Who can tally the love of a virgin or the heart of a man in his hate, Who are wise with a perfect remembrance, who reject not a creed nor a crime, Who compassionate all, who interpret the ways and the wonders of Time! âWho have builded and broken all laws of the Heaven and Earth, who are free, Who have lifted the seals from the sunrise, made pregnant the womb of the sea, Who have scattered the phantoms of heaven, wrecked the thrones of the world and their spell, Who have sown and reaped harvest of flowers in the fire-waste deserts of hell! âFor my God is the friend that I cherish, and my God is the woman I love, My God is the Spring on the hillsides, the Sea and the marvel thereof, My God is the justice of sunlight unhindered by power or pelf, And vast beyond all and inclusive of all things, my God is Myself!â CAIN Humana ante oculos foede cum vita jaceret In terris oppressa gravi sub religione Quae caput a caeli regionibus ostendebat Horribili super aspectu mortalibus instans, Primum ... homo mortalis tollere contra Est oculos ausus primusque obsistere contra, Quem neque fama deum nec fulmina nec minitanti Murmure compressit caelum, sed eo magis acrem Inritat animi virtutem, effringere ut arta Naturae primus portarum claustra cupiret. Ergo vivida vis animi pervicit, et extra Processit longe flammantia moenia mundi Atque omne immensum peragravit mente animoque, Unde refert nobis victor quid possit oriri, Quid nequeat, finita potestas denique cuique Quanam sit ratione atque alte terminus haerens. Quare religio pedibus subiecta vicissim Opteritur, nos exaequat victoria caelo. Lucr. Lib. i. 62â79. TO THE DEATHLESS MEMORY OF JESUS OF NAZARETH SEER AND SAYER OF TRUTH WHO WAS BELIEVED ONLY BY THE POOR AND OUTCAST, WHO WAS RECOGNIZED BY ALL REPUTABLE AND RESPECTABLE PEOPLE AS THE AVOWED ENEMY OF LAW, ORDER AND RELIGION, AND WHO WAS AT LAST BROUGHT TO HIS DEATH BY THE PRIESTHOOD OF THE ORTHODOX CHURCH THROUGH THE OPERATION OF THE ESTABLISHED COURTS OF SOCIAL JUSTICE, THIS POEM IS INSCRIBED WITH MEASURELESS LOVE. CHARACTERS OF THE DRAMA: Adam Eve Cain Abel The Voice of God ACT I GENESIS CHAPTER II 16. And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: 17. But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die. CHAPTER III 1. Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? 2. And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: 3. But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. 4. And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: 5. For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. 22. And the Lord God said, Behold, THE MAN IS BECOME AS ONE OF US, TO KNOW GOOD AND EVIL: and now lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever: 23. Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden to till the ground from whence he was taken. CHAPTER IV 1. And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the Lord. 2. And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. A vast, naked plain. Mountains in the remote background. In the foreground a rude tent of skins. The dark twilight of the first flush of dawn. No sound or motion is anywhere in the world. Time: early spring; the twenty-eighth year since the birth of Cain. Eve appears at the door of the tent and looks forth toward the sunrise. EVE The rapt silence! The dark twilight!âIt dawns! The multitude of the ineffable stars That lamped the viewless parapets of heaven, Melt in the light like pearls in golden wine; The void globe of the calm firmament Glows; the immemorable ecstasy Thrills in the vital fabric of creation, Andâhark!âa bird wakes somewhere in the world! Somewhere a burst seed splits the naked sod, Somewhere a flower folded at evening Petal by petal bares its inmost heart In perfect trust and drinks the dewfall!âLife, O Life, imperishable and resistless! Life, Fragile as joy and free as destiny! O breath of life tender and passionate, Sweet breath of sap and imminent foliage Blown thro' the level ether and low light! From within the tent, the voice of ADAM, talking in his sleep. The voice of ADAM Give me the fruit! How fair it is! It seems As it were a globe of lightâgive me the fruit! His eyes are strange and glad and perilous! Eve, hast thou wondered how his eyes are strange? Nay thenâmy soul is strong and I will eat! Give me the fruit, give me the heritage! Yea! I will wander in the sky-gardens And meet with level eyes the vision of God! Give me the fruit! EVE Adam! The voice of ADAM âthe deed is done! Silence! Silence! The deathless deed is done! See how he stares!âHis coils are flecked with flame, His eyes challenge!âO God! what comes to pass?â A wind of flight stirs in the wings of Peace And peril haunts the glades of Paradiseâ A pause. EVE listens intently. The voice of ADAM My soul cowers!âWhat have I done?âCrouch low, Woman, crouch low! Pray God the night will suddenly Cover us from his ken! Eve! Eve!âHis voice, The voice of God!âJustice, Omnipotent, Justice! The guilt is alien to my soulâ I say not mine, not mine the sin, Lord God! The woman tempted me and I did eat! EVE O vain repentance! ADAM Staggering forth, still unawakened, from the tent. Eve!âUtterly lost! His hand has loosed the four relentless winds Against this delicate toy of His creation, And lifted out of Chaos the elder night, And set against the paths to Paradise Seraphim and the sword of circling flame! And weâwe go beyond! O night and death! O woman, woman, woman,âwhere is Eden? At this point ADAM wakes suddenly. A long pause. Slowly he regains complete consciousness, still shaken and afraid. The lightâthe lifeâEve! EVE Adamâ ADAM Art thou there? EVE Take both my hands, ADAM âthe dream! EVE Ghosts! Ghosts! ADAM The dream! Visions! Visions!âO shield me, take my hands! Let my face lie against thy breast a whileâ I dreamed of Paradise and Godâno more, No more! I am too shaken utterly! Vague am I, vague and desolate as mist! My soul suffersâO heart, how sad it is! Life is too tragic of its memoriesâ Hold meâI need thy tenderness, I need Thy calm and pitiful hands to comfort me. EVE Be still a little, all will be well I know. ADAM Say nothing more, for naught avails me now! There is no other balm but silence. Mine Are woes too real for words, too wild for tears. EVE See out of heaven how there is shed upon thee The light of dawnâ ADAM All other light is lostâ The light of God, the light of happiness!â O memories, dreams!â EVE Vain agonies! ADAM Vain joys, Vain life, vain death,âwhat is not vain and void? The soul dries up with fear to think of it! God knows my dreams are very terrible! God knows there is no laughter in my life, And in my slumbers no forgetfulness! EVE I say, vain agonies! Life cannot be Itself a glad or sad thing; grief and joy Are mere interpretations of the soul, Brief and changeable gloom or splendour shed Down the wide ways of Life's eternal sea! Joy is the temper of heroic mindsâ ADAM Grief is the stern acknowledgment of truth!â Hadst thou my dreams!âO where is Paradise?â EVE Peace, peace, distracted soul!â ADAM No more! No more!â No more the inviolable peace of God, The tideless seas of bright beatitude Spread like the aura of His steadfast soul! No more the innocent communion With Him whose voice pealed thro' the formless void Till star by star the infinite creation Woke like bright echoes on the vacant night! No more the voice of cherubim that seemed A pulse of light in the celestial dome! No more, against the flashing slopes of heaven, Seraphim poised on pinions blind with gold!â Eden no more, the perfect glades no more! EVE I know full well there can be nevermore The joy that wasâto-morrow and to-day Cannot be nourished with past happiness, For past is past.âNot life alone is changed: We are such men and women as we are, Not as we were beneath God's tutelage, When Paradise was a delicate play-garden Where, in contentment of fair things, we lived So childish-glad of his beneficence. Now are we not withholden by God's grace From all mortality; we know at last How we are fashioned of the selfsame clay Whence his creative hands divinely shaped Behemoth and the bird of paradise. On the bare uplands of reality Our feet walk level with the whole of life! Therefore the tender and impermanent joys, The warm, frail happiness of mortal things Are ours at last, our earned inheritance. ADAM They are not mine!âI know not what you mean! I am one man to-day and yesterday: I am that Adam of God's handiwork Who, perfect thro' the paths of Paradise, Walked hand in hand with happiness a while,â Who now is haunted of shrill memories And anxious dreams! EVE Adamâbe resolute! I too have dreamed, I too have memories Of joy and violence and tragedy! Your past is mine, we share to-day. Say this: What was has never been, there yet can be No less than is, nor more than is to come; And life at last, at least is ours! ADAM Is life This desolate sentience, this distressful toil, This pain, this pitiful treasure of mean days? Is life indeed this scant monotony Of being,âthis heart of violent agonies And scared impermanent felicity, This body of labor and lust and terrible tears, This brain where everlasting memory beats Dull as the pulse of a sick artery? Then were it altogether a happy thing If this magnificence of stainless light Were quenched and night were set insuperable Over this theatre of our desolation And life so disinherited of delight Abolished from this perishable dust! If this be life what lovelier word befits The clear and innocent ecstasies of Eden, The candid rapture roused in body and soul When dawn with lifted, fiery finger-tips Kindled the dark and dreamless void of sleep, And once again the vision of Paradise, The endless melody of shallow waters, Perfumes of foliage wet with silver light, The sound of dewfall thro' the fragrant gloom Of windless forests and the cries of birds Scattered upon the spiritual silence Like stars or dewdrops on the twilightâall The miracle of God's sublime creation Returned to consciousness! EVE Ask me no more! Ask me no more!âsuch tears of mine are fallen On the wild harp of memory that now The strings are lax and faint,âthey sing no more! Well do I know the past was otherwise And moreâyet also haply something less! Thought wearies of the eternal task!âat least The austere and passionate life of libertyâ ADAM Is strange to God's beneficent intent And steadfast will! EVE Yet is it come to pass!â The core of truth is darkness to the soul. I cannot tellâI suffer of such things As swell beyond the shape of any words. Only in silence can we bear with fate, And find the joy to live not pitiably Nor infidelâlest all were lost in vain! ADAM In vain! In vain!âthe word rings void as life! In vain the irremediable woe, In vain the exile from God's father-house, In vain the lamentable days and nights Of terrible remembrance and tense dreams!â Vain hopes, vain tears, vain agonies! EVE Be still! The dream has robbed thy soul of fortitude, Swelled thy remorseful heart with futile tears, And crazed thy brain with vain imaginings. I know too well the face of thy despair, Too well!âtherefore be still that I may live! I too have felt the intolerable scorn And borne the task that seemed unbearable. ADAM The scorn of labour and the task of tears, The scorn of memory and the task of life, The scorn of hope, the task of patienceâEve, I wait:âthe end is silence. Look beyond! Death even shall haply ease the exhausted flesh And pour perpetual oblivion, Shadow and senseless silence on the soul! EVE Shadow and silence and oblivionâ Is death indeed so absolute a term? Is death a magic of such sovereign cure? Is death a silence so eventual? It cannot be! If life must find a term Vain is the passionate utterance of life, Vain the sore travail in which my womb conceived The stalwart children of thy generation! It cannot be! What tho' the hand of death Shall smite my mouth with silence utterly And feed spring flowers of my carrion? Yet is eternity within me!âHark! Whispers, whispers of immortality! As it were a shell found inland, so is life Fulfilled with murmurs of an infinite sea! Soul is the Pilgrim of Eternity, And Life and Death in long processional Chequer the pathways of its endless march Like day and night: a strife and then a sleep, Darkness and light, a song, a silenceâso They pass: the Pilgrim and the Path endure! Adam! Adam!âI say thou canst as well Measure the soul in terms of life and death As lay a foot-rule to infinity! ADAM Be still! Here in the vigour of my days I search the paths of time with sleepless eyes: The void prospect of eternity Glitters with ghosts of lunacy and fear! My soul shudders!âI find no goal of light, No guerdon of great deeds nor any hope Save of the ambushed death that chokes with dust The wolves of memory at the heels of life! Death is the almshouse for the wayfarer, The prize, the goal, the journey's end, the sleep! EVE Perchanceâperchanceâwhere's truth? the absolute Is never learned yet faith is justified, The faith of life that is and is to be. Soul wanders blindly in a labyrinth, Grasping for guidance one by one the threads, Sombre or splendid, that at last combine To weave the cosmic tapestry of truth. Perfection lies beyond!âyet momently Visions dawn, vistas of infinite light Openâand close, yet leave their afterglow To guide the wandering of the errant feet Of the earth-children! ADAM Heart, O Heart of passion! O Heart of tears!âcanst thou console thy sorrow With such vain raptures of imagination, And make with fevers of a mind diseased Roseate the unrelenting face of truth? Thy faith is pitiful! EVE Not mine alone!â I learn my secret from the lips of life: Words of my gospel are bird-melodies, Pale lotos ripening in the pond-waters, The hollow murmur of the winds of spring Thro' forests soft with imminent foliage, Rose hyacinth and white anemone And golden crocus, songs and perfumes shed Thro' twilight, and the rush of plunging streams, And sea-storms, and the native, violent lust Of mating animals;âyea, from all acts of life Transpire the faith, the measureless love, the clear Simplicity of all heroic deeds!â Sing, Spirit Divine! O lips of Life Thrilled with immortal whispers, heart, O heart Of Life, sing on!âmy soul shall hear thy voice, Shall sing thy song, O heart of Life! O lips Of Life! and sayâThe crown, the prize, the pÃ¦an Dull the magnificence of noble deeds! Recompense is the measure of mean aims And small achievements: toil may earn a wage And strife a slumber, but the act of life, Like all heroic deeds and spiritual, Is wrought and tested in eternity! Its parturitions prove too pure a faith To ask a goal or seek a prize beyond! ADAM Poor Soul!âmisery and sin have crazed thy brain! Life is no other than a senseless lust: What can the grosser nature signify? Knowledge is God's alone; by His sole grace We read the legend of unchanging truth: Hope in His favour; for the rest, despair! EVE Hope in God's favourâhope of Paradiseâ Hope of what was, of what no more shall be? ADAM âLost, lost beyond recall! EVE âbeyond recall! Therefore not lost in vain! The soul inures To new desires, new hopes, new powers, new truth! O hope no more what was or what shall be!â Lost is God's favour, lost is Paradise, Lost the desire and hope of what has been, And lost is even the blackness of despair Whereof His wrath fulfilled me! ADAM Eveâ EVE I say We knew despair how dire an agony It is, that night beneath the starless shroud Of dark and thunder and whirlwind and shrill cries, Whereunder earth seemed as a shattered ship Derelict on the seas of dissolution!â ADAM When by his wrath was loosed against creation The violence of elemental things!â Woe beyond utterance! EVE Hear me!âsuddenly Forth from the pits of palpable blackness sprang The dawn, and tore apart with hands of flame Night's cere-cloth on its brows!âdelirious, Terrified, fallen,âfree! I glimpsed again The clear skies fresh and spiritual as song, The life-beneficent and tender light, The earth, this earth of graves and growing flowers! Breathless and dumb, with eyes thirsty of vision, I saw the impenetrable dome of night, The walls of dark that seemed immutable, Flicker to flame, while from their ruins fell Embers of twilight thro' the storm-tossed airs! And then, Adam, O then the gates of lightâ Then, as I staredâsprang wide within me: Dawn Broke in my soul! I was ineffably Glad of unutterable things!âit seemed Triumph was won, a miracle was wrought, A deed of love and passionate liberty Accomplished! Scornful of my night's despair, Against the deep skies of eternity The stars of life shone steadfast and the stars Of faith,âthe faith of life! And then, and thenâ Sun rose resplendent, witness to the truth! I knew in that surpassing hour, since day And dark were faithful in their periods, That life and death could not be less nor fail Their full return! ADAM Then life's return is pain!â For all my days are very lamentable, And all my nights that should be smooth and void Are fevered with intolerable visions, And all my dreams of death are dark and dumb, As of a peril and a mystery. Yet am I nowise cringed before my woes! Nay!âtho' my life is bruised with sore affliction And dire repentance blasts my happiness, Tho' in remembrance Paradise forever Blooms with fresh light and flowers ineffable, Clear pieties and peaceful innocence, Against the gloom of this grieved sentience Of violence and starvation, yet I bear, Scornful of tears, the grief and scorn of life! Faith is the stern, austere acknowledgment And dumb obedience to the will of God: Such faith my soul has kept inviolable! What tho' He crush me, is He not the Lord! Therefore my hands have torn the thrifty sod And lured to fruitfulness the fragile seed. I serve and wait; but nowise shall my soul Yield to the lure of perishable joys Nor scarf the eyes of Truth with gossamer Of delicate hope, of fond imaginings. Never within my heart shall cowardice Whore with imagination to achieve A false and unsubstantial happiness. CAIN and ABEL enter unperceived from the tent. I will be stern and just and absolute: Thus only can the soul of man preserve What shreds are left of calm and dignity. Therefore, Woman, I say forbear thy speech!â And Thou, O Lord of Life, Magnificent God, Craftsman of miracles whose labour caused Mighty establishment of heaven and earth, Whose hands shaped chaos and tamed rebellious suns And wrought the hosts of heaven to harmony, Grooved perilous pitfalls for the unresting seas, Lifted these naked uplands of the world, Pillared on high the sapphire dome of heaven And gave fair ordinance to the wayward hoursâ Grant me, O God, to sayââThy will be done!â With level lips, obedient to the last! CAIN Father!âwhat say'st thou? Have I heard aright? Obedient? EVE Cain! ADAM His will be done! ABEL Amen! EVE Cain! Cain! CAIN His will and mine and thine be done!â Amen!â't is well! His will and mine are twain, Yet each may still be free and absolute. Is my life less because you live? am I Weak by your strength, by your hope hopeless? Nay! A myriad lives cannot diminish me, A myriad hearts distrain no love from mine,â My will alone fashions my destinies! Why say'st thou, then, obedient?âGod is God, And Man is Man.âWhy chains when all is free? ADAM Thy dark thought stumbles in impiety. Art thou so blinded from enlightenment? God rules! knowest thou not His secret laws Thro' life and death dispose immutably The minnow and Leviathan, the pale Glow-worm and Gold Arcturus with his sons? Child, we are dust, once lifeless, soon to die, Sentient and lonely creatures of his will Cast in the mould of his divinity. CAIN Father! father!âWhat say'st thou?âCan it be That we are creatures of an alien will, The fashioned puppets of a craftsman's hands, The structured dolls of God's imagining? CreaturesâHow then?âis liberty a lie? Are we so basely cheated and contemned? Then are we pitiful spectres of a dream; Then is this azure overarch of heaven Lifted on ghostly wings of phantasy; Then is the day-spring's fire-flushed flood that pours Up the star-shingled beaches of the sky A bright delusion; then beneath the sun Are void phantoms; then is life itself, This passionate life, this imminent creation, Mere vapour on the immeasurable heaven Where dawns the eternal morning of the soul! Nay!âsince we are not men but slaves, and thus Even the high task and ecstasy of love, The austere endurance of great wrongs are vain, And vain all tenderness and sacrifice That swell the soul's horizons,âthen the Soul Itself is naughtâa cause denies the Soul! O father, seest thou not how much is lost? How by God's will all fades to nothingness? What cause is needed why the splendid sun, The delicate moon and all the faultless stars Minister to the world delicious light? What cause is needed why the crusted sod Gives punctual utterance to so fragile flowers? What cause is needed why within me stirs The haughty power and longing of creation, Or thought or spiritual serenity? What cause is needed, what is justified? If cause there be then are we all betrayed, Then may we well despair of life and death! ADAM I hear thy wordsâmadness and blasphemy! God pity me!âfor I thought his justice slept, His vengeance drowsed, with misery satiated. I was the more deceived!âThe poison works: Thou art the child of Woman, the son of sin. Thy crazed words witness:âEve, thy womb is cursed, Hark to thy son! EVE In a low voice Mine! Mine! ADAM Methinks I hear That voice that said, âThou shalt be even as is Almighty God, knowing both Good and Evil!â EVE That voice of passionate poems and grave joysâ Even soâ ADAM It spake as thou, my eldest son! CAIN What have I uttered more or less than truth? Why are your words so strange, your eyes so sad, And sudden panic fallen upon your thoughts?â For love, for justice, simply, as I speak, Deal with me! Judge me not, tho' ignorance Cheats my impetuous soul:âare we not all Like lonely voyagers on uncharted seas Who signal each to each when thro' the gloom Flashes a beacon, or a distant roar Warns where some coast confronts the sombre flood, Perchance the haven of our guideless quest, Perchance a peril and a sepulchre? O you, forbear!âeven tho', lost and blind, I, from the sluggish rear of circumstance, Signal a rushlight for a guiding star To you who lead the intrepid van of hope, Let not your hearts condemn me utterly! Whatever leagues divide us man from man Seem in the endless journey of the soul So brief a distance! Rather, tenderly, Lead me to stand one day where now you stand, To glimpse the light that proves me wrong to-day! ADAM The light is God! Within the soul there dwells Reflected splendour!âHe, the Sun of Heaven, Gives light to all. The dream of liberty Shadows the glass, where God's magnificence Alone should glow, with darkness utterly. When, from the sapphire pinnacles of heaven, Spangled with stars, where sing to pleasure Him Grave angels and the clear-voiced Sons of Song, His eyes look forth, we seem as flickering motes Caught in the stream of his effulgence! CAIN Nay! No height whence the supernal vision falls Can shrink us to a less reality Than what we are, being no less than men! EVE Spirit of Life! Thrilled Heart!âNay, words are vain! The worst shall come inevitably I know. My heart is keen with direful prophecyâ Cain, Cain, my heart aches of your destinies! Clasp me, dear son, in both your arms!âO God! What shall I say? CAIN I ask no eminence, No power, no more than truth!âin very deed What less thing can a man desire than truth? EVE What more thing? ADAM Since the truth is God! CAIN The truth Is mine and yours in measure of our will! ABEL Yours?âMine? CAIN How not, if there is truth at all? The ways are barred to no adventurer, The seas bear up whatever onward keel! ABEL Where? To what end? Lacking God's guidance, where Shall stray such blind and errant enterprise? CAIN Haply thro' all sweet vistas and sublime The ecstatic soul at last goes home to light! ABEL But you? CAIN I walk level with what I am, Negligent of a goal. My feet no less Are stablished where they tread than spreads my soul Her irised wings and lifts her breast of faith Against the eternal skies and shoreless seas, The infinite, fresh, immortal, strange Beyond! So poised, I may be master of no thing That is at all and will be slave to none! If Godâyou sayâassume to tutor me, How shall He ask a less thing than I crave In native aspiration? Rather shall He Lift up his light beyond the utmost stars Fading along the verge of consciousness! Rather than bind me in obedience He shall loose freedom from the parapets Of heaven and spur my soul to range beyond! So, haply, after long discoveries, To walk at last as comrade, hand in hand, And share with Him the infinite vision of truth! ADAM O mortal pride! O madness worse than sin! Pitiful child! Derisive, trifling worm God's foot would crush didst thou deserve so much,â Be silent! lest perchance thy noisy babble Might vex his calm divinity!â EVE Hush!âHush! I know the worst must comeânothing avails, For him my heart foretold catastrophe When, as I watched last night beside his sleep, His brows grew bent in great resolve, his lips Muttered as tho' within his sightless eyes Sate perilous visions or his soul endured Strange visitation of fantastic dreams! Cain!âO my child, I love you utterly! What urge compels you? What magnificence Lifts in your life? What sense of combat swells Your soul with truth, your heart with liberty? CAIN How shall I say?âwithin me all is flowing And vague and boundless and unutterable. Within me joy, heart-deep, heart-warm, and love And power of life are measureless; within Light beats and swells!âI dwell within the soul's Rose-irised mist of everlasting wonder Where life assails me with resistless love! I share with allâand all results for me! For me the day-spring and the dawn of moon, For me the elate, innumerable stars, For me strong seas, for me this earth of gravesâ O earth of tireless conception!âand For me these plains and desolate mountain-peaks, This glad and faithful fellowship of life! These all, all are my passionate lovers! All They seize my sense, they take their will of me, They task me with delicious ecstasies! On towers of naked rock, in deep defiles, Beneath the glittter of tree-leaves wet with light, By streams singing their journey thro' the world, In rainfall, by the roar of distant seas On beach and cliff, by cloud and cataract, I feel a presence and a mystery, A summons of incomparable love, Great indications of eternity, Miracles, vistas, portents, lifted veils, Breathless discoveries and revelations, The lure of open arms, thro' doors ajar Glimpses beyond, voices of grave surmise,â These, all I feel within me and around, Breathe of immortal secrets!âMore, too deep, Too delicate for words, heaves in my breast, Burns in my sense and swells my soul with light! EVE O God, how all my wounded heart resounds! Hush, lest I yield!âNo more!âNo more!âthy words Are wonderful and strange as happiness! The gates spring wide asunder!âHush! No more! Thy dreams, God knows, were otherwise,âthy dreams Were gaunt with pride and prophecy and pain! CAIN Then were my dreams beyond my conscious scope. The spread of earth, the circling deeps of heaven, The interminable sea, resistless love, The passion and miracle of life and death, The immortal whispers from within the soulâ My knowledge finds horizon in these things. ADAM So far, so pitiably art thou strayed from truth, Thou blind and boastful fool! learn this at least: The true horizon of the soul is God! And thou, Eve, Woman, most perilously wandered In weak delusion, now I charge thee speak, Lest thou should'st fall again in deathless sin, Of God and man,âGod's all, man's nothingness! EVE Dear son, we are God's creatures every oneâ CAIN Mother! EVE I'll speak no more! ABEL Haply it is That God inspires his handiwork and sets The pulse of life in cadence with his heart. Haply, dear Cain, the joy, the infinite love, The fire and perfume of divinity, The rapture of concealed infinities Thy soul has garnered round thee and within, Are but the harvest of his seed of grace Sown broadcast over all his huge creation. CAIN Then am I cheated of my heritage! Then all's a dream, a web of foolish lies! Then is the faith that fills the fragile nest And exquisitely brings frail flowers to bud A pitiful derision; then is life A monstrous farce and death a fruitless pang! Then are my manhood and my liberty, My will, my thoughts, the life-sap of my loins, The unborn sons and daughters of my blood Vain hopes and pitiable deceptions, lies Of sense and soul,âAye! then is God himself The showman of a stupid mummeryâ EVE Cain!âCain!âforbear! CAIN Hast thou forgot thy pangs That prove this life was thine that now is mine? Not God's life, thine and mine!âYea! face to face And heart to heart, with deep and fearless eyes, So it is mete that I should speak with God Who speak with no thing on less perfect terms! My life, my love, my cherished liberty, Are mine because whatever is at all Shares in their dispensation.âI will take No joy but all participate, no pang But all endure, no power, no attribute But all possess or shall possess in turn! So is my right inviolable to stand Where now I stand and ask my leave of none! ADAM Enough!âO God, be just yet merciful! Witless he is and sinfulâyet my son! Punish his sin, yet I beseech thee stay The full and righteous measure of thy wrath! And thouâanswer no more!âI'll hear no more! Thou art my son, living in God's defiance, To add a grief more grievous than the rest To all the misery my harsh days must bear! And thou, whose weakness set the term to joy, Thou, by whose sin the worst has come to pass, Beware of what more dire events may chance! And nowâGo forth each one. The daylight liftsâ Somewhere your labour waits you in the world! ACT II GENESIS CHAPTER IV 3. And in process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord. 4. And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering; 5. But unto Cain and to this offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell. 6. And the Lord said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? 7. If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? And if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. ... 8. And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him. A broad level of naked rock at the extreme summit of a high mountain. No vegetation nor any sign of life whatever. At the back the mountain falls away in a sheer precipice. In the immense distance below and beyond stretches a vast panorama of forest, field and stream, warm and tranquil thro' the golden haze of late afternoon. In the foreground is a low platform of stone about twenty feet square with three broad stone steps leading up to it. On the platform stands a sort of sacrificial stone or table of offerings. The splendid light of the low sun inundates the summit of the mountain and lies, windless and warm, across the altar. Time: late afternoon of the same day which dawned in Act I. CAIN enters by a path ascending from the valley. He bears in his hands fruit, grain, and two small jars containing oil and wine. He places his burden on the ground near the raised platform, and, seating himself on a boulder, surveys the immense prospect spread beneath him. CAIN I am gone sky-ward to the uttermostâ Tacit and distant as life's thought of death Earth lies beneath me patterned with sheer hills, Deserts and forest-marches, flashing streams And sea-scapes vast beyond the power of vision. Its charted levels, whelmed beneath the dumb Cycles and tides of lucent sapphire, seem A sea-floor tufted with gigantic weeds, Virgin of tumult or the tread and travel Of restless feet; yet fruitful streams, I know, Go seaward voiced with endless melody, Twilight is plaintive with the cries of birds, Dim forests murmur soft as sleep, and all The myriads of life are musical! No whisper lifts,âthe light is deep and dumb. As one sequestered in the tower of thought I stand aloof from restless strife and sound, Withdrawn beyond the fellowship of life. Solitude, silence and tranquillity, Immensity of elemental things,â Haply in you at last the soul finds room, And liberty and light haply in you! It may be,âaging with the passionate seasons On earth's maternal breast,âthat life becomes Too much a lyric enterprise, too wrought With dreams and great desires and deep surmise, Too dazed with motion and magnificence. There, in the press and pride and longing of life, Haply the captive soul is leashed and lulled; Yet whiles, even in the ruck of the swift hours, Sentient of twilights and infinities! But here is refuge: silence, unperturbed, Broods on these battlements of lifeless stone Reared like an isle from life's tempestuous sea. Regioned in light and loneliness, the soul May, in the all-reflecting glass of truth, Confront with eyes insatiable of light The revelations of eternity. Here might at last divinely be fulfilled All spiritual indications to the soul From rapt communion with the silent stars, That still by night their endless vigil keep On the vague frontiers of infinity. Here might the thought of time, the thought of death, The wonder and desire of deathless things Yield to the soul their last significance. Here might the mystery of God be solved! He pauses, staring before him over the immense prospect where the light deepens. I know at last all shall be lived, enduredâ All shall at last find mansions in the soul; And thenâthen shall the soul be satisfied? O restless voyager, where is thy rest? Is there a haven for thine enterprise, A goal for thine adventure and a term For thine infinity?âImagination, Daring the intervals of pathless gloom From star to star of thought, falls broken-winged! Yet are the days of life occasional Of truth's divine discovery,âand soul Shall at the last accept no less than truth! A pause. CAIN gazes before him, lost in thought. Then, ascending from below, the voice of Abel is heard singing. The voice of ABEL Lord God, my light, my hope, my faith, Craftsman of earth and sea and sky, What power but Thine can justify The ways of life, the pangs of death? Resistless God! before Thy face My spirit bows, I feel Thy will! My heart is meekâO Lord, fulfil My life with Thine exhaustless grace! I put no trust in strength or youth, Or power, or thought, or mighty deeds; I ask of life no more than needs; I know but thisâThy will is Truth! Thy creature needs Thy love and light, Thy servant bows before Thy rod; O guide my steps, Eternal God, And make me perfect in Thy sight! ABEL, bearing in his arms a lamb, enters and appears face to face with CAIN. CAIN AbelâAbelâ ABEL Cainâ CAIN Abelâaloneâ So farâ ABEL My feet have striven to this sheer height Led by the luminous spirit of piety; I bear the innocent firstling of my flocks Here to God's altar as a thanksgiving Of all my heart for his beneficence! My mood perchance is thine: creation stirs To new conception; earth's reviving green Moves the meek heart to praise the Lord of Life With songs and seasonable sacrifice. CAIN Thy mood is alien to my thoughts of God And all my visions of human destiny. I bring no tributeâ ABEL Nay!âa eucharist! Is it not very spacious and most fair This parcel of God's potent handiwork Held by the sons of man in heritage? Is it not generous of all pleasantness And fruitful for the hunger of life's days? Then, to the Heavenly Artisan who severed Darkness from light, shaped systems from the void, Wafted the breath of life thro' lifeless clay,â How else to Him can man glance heavenward Save with mild eyes of adoration? How Climb to his footstool save in grateful praise? CAIN God knows no gratitude of mine shall fail Where such is due. God knows when face to face I meet my creditor, no debt he proves Shall wait for payment. Now, till then, I stand Fettered by no more than my bounds of thought, Slave to such fears and passions as obscure Soul's truth and chill the headlong heart of faith,â Yet, in conception, strong, supreme, and free! ABEL Why has this violence of self, this stern Defiance diseased thy soul with doubt and pride? The days of life bring one by one their treasure Of simple toil and simple happinessâ Desires, right deeds, endurance, joy and pain, With over all the shelter of God's wise will! Forego thy search: God is a mystery. Now, while the last light lingers heavenward, Let me fulfill my sacrifice: my soul Lies on God's breast,âmy trust is all in Him. ABEL ascends the steps to the raised platform, still carrying the lamb in his arms. He sets the lamb down and heaps some fuel on the sacrificial stone. Then he stands before it facing the deep light of sunset. CAIN to himself as he watches Abel His face is young and tranquil as a child's: All seems surpassing well with him,âhis eyes Shine with calm rapture, innocent of thought. Meek trust, simplicity and tendernessâ I must believe his soul is satisfied,â Filled with a crust!âand I who starve, who starve! O tireless voyager! O soul of me! Captain, my soul!âshall we not better rest? See, where a mansion in the House of Life Waits our repentance, and a candle burns Still thro' the casementâyea, tho' faint and far, The firelight of contentment lures us back! Shall we not better pause, return,âforget Our desperate quest beyond the heedless stars? Shall we not better live forevermore Passionless by the threshold, lulled in sleep, Like children sheltered in the Father-house? ABEL The golden sandals of reluctant day Climb the broad shoulders of the heavenward hills. Earth fills with darkness like a shallow bowl And sleep weighs down the weary lids of life. O peace of God, vigil of God's great love, I feel you now, in vast serenity, Brood like a benediction on the world! CAIN still to himself No more the ecstasy and the pangs of thought, No more the tempest's threat, the perilous plunge And shoreless vision of blind uncharted seas Where soul must wander years and lives and Ã¦ons Seeking the undiscoverable truth! Captain, my soul,âshall we not better rest? ABEL strikes fire and lights the fuel upon the altar. He throws on the flames myrrh and frankincense; a dense smoke arises. Then he raises the lamb in his arms and at the same moment draws a knife from his belt. ABEL Being whose thoughts are destiny: whose power Chains the rebellious, tames the passionate; Whose justice spares the suppliant soul and damns The soul of pride,âAlmighty God, to Thee Ascend my pÃ¦an and prayer and thanksgiving! Father of Life, accept thy creature; Lord, Master, receive thy faithful servant Abel! I ask with contrite heart and will subdued The dispensation of thy charity! Suffer this fire and incense may be blessed; This living sacrifice be sanctified With thine acceptance! ABEL cuts the throat of the lamb and lets the warm blood pour out on the sacrificial stone. I beseech Thee guard My frailty, fill my heart with thy desire, Fashion my will to thine intention, take Temptation from me of my mortal strength, And pride of thought,âmy hope is all in Thee! ABEL falls on his knees beside the altar and remains lost in rapture. CAIN springs to his feet. CAIN Shine! Shine! passionate light of Liberty! Blow outward winds! lift the wide wings of thought Reckless and blind against the night! and you, Monotonous thunder of the shoreless seas, Sound thro' long vistas to the sleepless soul! Rouse, heart benumbed, the lethargy is passed! Spirit dismayed, the spell is shattered, wake! Athlete of Freedom, rend the silken fetters That well-nigh bound thy nerveless sinews fast! O Heart, how near we stooped to infamy! Now and forever the supreme choice is made, The die is cast! Never shall I behold, Turning a backward glance from truth's endeavour, The firelight of content, the lamp of fear Flickering behind the clouded panes of thought, The guarded threshold of the House of Sleep! Forward I set my steadfast eyes! Haste! haste! Captain, my soul! we shall return no more! Cut the last strands of weakness and despair That bound our vessel to the shores of safety! I hear the singing of all the spacious seas Of truth's supreme adventure and at last Take the deep vistas with a homeless eye! CAIN advances rapidly, seizes the grain, wine and oil which he had deposited on the ground and mounts the steps to the platform. There he pauses a moment, looking down upon ABEL, who is still on his knees in a sort of quiet ecstasy. Man! and so abject! yet my heart is loveâ So young he seems, so tender like a child! Abel! ABEL Who calls me? CAIN Rise! for I am Cain, First of the Sons of Man! ABEL O rouse me not! God's peace enfolds meâ CAIN Rise! ABEL What is thy will? ABEL rises to his feet still a little dazed by the rapture of his meditations. CAIN Knowest thou me? ABEL Why are thine eyes so strange? CAIN Knowest thou me? ABEL Thou art my brother Cainâ CAIN First of the sons of man! ABEL What is thy will? CAIN Abel, as we are men, I love thee! ABEL Cain, As God is Love, I love thee. CAIN All my will Is thy redemptionâ ABEL My redemption? CAIN Man! I will redeem thee from thine abject state, Strike the vile fetters from thy fearful feet, And set thee in the path of liberty! ABEL Liberty? CAIN I have lifted the large light, Near to destruction; it shall shine as fire Flashing by night, and there where nothing was Save darkness where imagined spectres stalked, Visions of God and man's divinity, Grown to perfection thro' ascending lives, Shall smite thy breathless soul with wonder! ABEL Cain! CAIN Liberty!âSee!âGod stands before thee now Real and majestic! Thou shalt understand How much thy cowardice has wronged him; Man, Thou hast defiled his name! Thy prayers invoke Some wrathful demon, not the Soul of Light! Repent thy prayers, thy prayers were blasphemy! ABEL Cain! CAIN Hear meâ ABEL Blasphemy? CAIN God is not Lord Of slaves nor tyrant pleased with abject fears, PÃ¦ans and sacrifice: God sheds his grace And shares his fellowship for men, not slaves! Men who are sinewed with sublime resolve, Whom perfect faith has made insatiable, Whose eyes pursue, star over star, the last Outpost of knowledge in the skies of thought! Pilgrims of pathless lands, whom neither walls Nor slumber nor the arms of love can hold; Mariners who depart on shoreless seas Avid of new horizons in the vast Unknown!âO men, homeless and lonely men, For you, for you the fellowship of God! ABEL Thine is the blasphemy! Beware! The Lord Hath said, âVengeance is mine!â CAIN Thy words are wild. Vengeance? Why vengeance? Shall I dare to fear The Truth?âO man! are we not torch-bearers? ABEL Beware! we are but men and God is God! CAIN What then? Divinity is here, not there! O Soul, God is not otherwise than thou. And thou art God, O soul, spirit divine! Words that defile nor body nor soul of me Defile not God! He is what I shall be, I am what he has been! Hours, days, years, Centuries, cycles, Ã¦ons,âI shall pass At last to where he waits and longs for me! CAIN strides to the altar and pours on the failing fire his oil and wine. At once the fire flames brightly and a dense column of smoke mounts straight into the windless air. Then CAIN scatters his grain upon the altar. Meanwhile ABEL, dazed and scared, shrinks farther and farther away toward the steps. CAIN To You, Spirit Divine! O Soul of Life, Denizen of this tenement! O God, Captain of life's adventure, Self and Soul, Immortal Master of this mortal house! To You, for moments of eternity; To You, for Truth's sublime discoveries; To You, for revelations still to come, Visions unseen, unknown infinities,â To You this invocation and to You This ecstasy and solemn sacrifice! CAIN stands, transported with rapture, his face lifted and flushed with the firelight. Suddenly darkness falls, thunder peals, there comes a violent gust of wind, and the column of smoke from CAIN'S sacrifice is bent and blown straight back in his face. He recoils a step. The voice of GOD Rejected! ABEL shrieks and stumbles backward down the steps of the platform. At the bottom he falls on his knees and bows his head to the ground. ABEL Grace!âForgiveness!âMercy!âMercy! CAIN Give me breath!âI am stunned! The voice of GOD Rejected! ABEL God! O God! My God!âbe merciful! be merciful! CAIN Who cries, âRejected?â ABEL God! The Voice of GOD Rejected! CAIN Speak! Answer!âWho dares reject the soul of Cain? I am the Son of Manâwho dares reject me? ABEL CainâCain! CAIN Who dares reject me? The Voice of GOD I am God! Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? And if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door! Immediately the wind falls, the sudden darkness lifts, disclosing ABEL prostrate on the ground at the foot of the steps leading to the platform, and CAIN standing, erect and menacing, by the sacrificial stone. Below, the immense panorama of the earth is covered with the shadows of early night. The fire on the altar is extinguished and the scene is illumined only by the last dark flush of sunset which still lingers on the summit of the mountain. The deep violet of the skies is spangled with ripe stars. The silence and the stillness are unbroken. CAIN God's voice!âRejected!âCain, the Son of Man, Rejected!âMan, rejected and man's soul Utterly lost from God's acceptance!âThenâ Hope whored with Fancy and begot aâdream! So was my soul deceived!âRejected!âHear me, Infinite, voiceless, elemental airs, Pathless, inviolable firmament! Hear me, ethereal solitudes, untrod Save by the bare and soundless feet of light! Hear me, O cosmic fellowship of stars, Stainless as children's eyes; majestic suns And far-flung systems of coherent orbs! Hear me, O sun, creative lord of light! Hear me, O moon, mistress of chaunting tides! Hear me, dead snows of desolate mountain-peaks, Robing the tragic shapes of cliff and crag! Hear me, resistless sea and fruitful earth, Theatre of life and death!âO earth and sea Of graves and resurrections, toil and sleep! Hear me, O Heart, O passionate Heart of Life! Hear me, Immortal Heart! And hear me, you, All in whose veins the pulse of life abounds! And you, Abel! Abel!âO Son of Man, Hear me! Hear me! Hear me!ânow and forever I make you witness to this monstrous deedâ God has rejected Cain, the Son of Man! ABEL God of stern justice and resistless wrath! CAIN Justice?âNo justice moves this fierce revenge! ABEL God's will is justice!âDesperate rebel, yield! Hast thou not suffered of all thy sinful pride? Shall not the power of God constrain thy heart? Measure thy peril,âbe contrite or despair! CAIN Never! I will not yield nor yet despair! Must we despair?âRespond, rejected Soul! Faith cheated, love deceived, fond hopes betrayed, By God deniedâmust we despair? Respond! Where's justice?âlight?ârefuge?âThought reels! The rod Strikes fire from flintâbeneath the blows of wrath Fierce doubts and perilous questions leap like sparks, Flashing within me! Reckless Soul, respond! Who is the God who dares reject me? Who Art thou, Spirit Divine? ABEL Repent! Repent! Lest worse befall thee! CAIN God rejects me!âNow, As one who falls in fight and then at dawn Wakes on the stricken field as life returns Spent and delirious from the peril of death, And so, nerved with faint hope, numbers his wounds,â So I, from fear and dire amazement roused, Question my peril and count my injuries: How have I suffered? Where have I suffered? Speak! Body and soul seem scathelessâlife remainsâ Where are my wounds?âI feel them not! My strength Is whole! Where are my wounds? Where are my wounds? I swear, I swear nothing is lost!âAll's well! Captain, my soul, despair is not for thee! Thou shalt behold the seals of darkness lift, Weather the wrathful tempest and at last, Resolute, onward, headlong, dazed and scarred, Reel thro' the gates of Truth's enormous dawn! ABEL Madman! Beware!âThy hope is weaved of dreams; Damnable dreams to cheat the will of God; Pitiful dreams, proud dreams, fantastic lies! CAIN Abel! ABEL Repent!âif still repentance serves, Repent!âthe mercy of God is infinite To all who bring his favoured sacrificeâ A contrite, humble and obedient heart! CAIN Truth, not forgiveness, I demand of God, Justice, not mercy, love, not charity! I was not fashioned to bewail my sins, I was not born for safe obedience! I bring not peace among you but a sword! ABEL Cainâfor thy life's sake, Cain, repent! CAIN No more! Silence!âAsk me no more!âI feel at last The breath of light, frail and portentous!âWake! It dawns, rejected Soul!âThe secret yields! I have been stunned! And nowâLight!âNow, suddenly Shadows shall fade, veils liftâI shall discover One of the meanings!âNowâat last, at last, I understand!âCreationâParadiseâ The immortal fruitâMother, thy gorgeous deed! O revelations! O discoveries! Measureless light at last! The truth at last! Enlightenment!âAll's well! The sacred fire Of liberty still burns!âMan is redeemed! ABEL Lost! Lost! Utterly lost, body and soul! Accursed! Accursed! CAIN Now God's dominion ends! ABEL Accursed! Accursed! CAIN Now man's abasement ends! For now the power and wrath and terrour of God Fade like false phantoms in the light,âthe light! God is dethroned and man resumes the crown, Regains the sceptre of divinity! ABEL Pitiful madman! CAIN Peace!âdespair and fear Are ghosts that haunt the night of ignorance; Dwellers in darkness of the immense unknown; Phantoms that lurk where thought's horizons blur, Where the vague shores of knowledge quake to feel Tumult and thunder of the seas beyond! ABEL Merciful God, pity himâhe is mad! Pity and spare him! CAIN Peace!âGod's power is lost! The ghastly tyranny of fear no more Shall bind the spirit of man in servitude! How can our faith be less than perfect now? All that awaits us shall be well, as all That is and has been in surpassing well! Measure thy scope and grasp thy heritage, Captain, my Soul!âPerchance not God alone Shall fade and vanish as the large light expands. It may be, haply, that at last in thine Infinite waking life itself shall prove A passionate dream and death a tranquil sleep! ABEL Silence, distracted soul!âCan God condone When I condemn thee as I must? Thou sayest Such frantic words of peril and deadly sin As no conception of my brain can grasp Nor all my love forgive! CAIN O man, rejoice! Now thou shalt understandâat last, at last, All shall be clear and steadfast in thy soul. Purge from thy brain the sickness of strange fears: My cause is pregnant of new liberties: Hear me in peace and be my justicer. How I have thought ineffably of God And stretched the vistas of all my hopes to him, God knows and thy remembrance certifies. Much I believed that Truth's immortal seed, Lost or unfruitful in the soul of man, Was, in the spirit of God, by love and light, Brought to its perfect flowerâinfinity. God was to me a star of quenchless rays Guiding my soul thro' time from life to life, Training my vision to glimpse eternity! God was to me the breast where all may weep, The eyes where all may find the immortal light, The hand that all may clasp, the heart of hearts, The spirit of passionate faith and liberty,â The tenant of the heavenly father-house, Waiting with arms of welcome wide for all! Such were my visions, such were my thoughts of Godâ Yet God rejects me! See! the monstrous deed Aches for interpretation. What is God, God who rejects so pure an ecstasy? Witness!âthe crucial secret must be solved! Spirit finds answerâthou shalt hear and learn, Partner in man's inheritance with man. God who rejects me and betrays my hope; God who denies me and deceives my faith, Cheats my desire and scorns my exalted love; God, who with peace and pleasure and loveliness, Fashioned the marvellous gardens of Paradise, Sating man's senses to debauch his soul; God, whose despair,âwhen Eve, with sacred thirst, Gathered and shared the fruit whereof all men Must eat who seek the soul's enlightenment,â Drew from his lips the cry: âBehold the man Is even as God, knowing both good and evil!â God, who in passion and fear and frenzy smote Man's disobedience and his dignity; God, who would hold the heart enslaved with fear, Stifle the sacred fire with ignorance, Leash the proud soul with duty and content, Obedience and remorseful cowardice,â God is not liberty but law, not love But mercy, not redemption but despair; Not joy but lethargy and meek content, Not grief's robust acknowledgment of wrong But abject lamentation and remorse, Not justice but forgiveness or revenge, Not strength but safety, not the change of growth, Fluid unrest of free development, But rules and customs and establishments, Limits and liesâthe servitude of man! So even is God and God's significance! But Lo! at last man wakes and stands and strives! Liberty!âLight!âThy deed was not in vain, Mother! Thy womb has not engendered slaves! ABEL, still on his knees, has listened to CAIN with steadily growing terrour. By this time his fear and amazement, his conviction of Cain's utter lunacy, have become, as it were, a shield which neither the shafts of persuasion nor reason nor truth can penetrate. He is, in a word, panic-stricken. Staring at CAIN, he backs away from him on his knees. ABEL almost in whisper Blasphemy! CAIN By the breast that gave thee suck, Abel, my brother, I adjure thee rise! Rise and rejoice! I bring thee liberty; For truth is liberty and nought but truth! Never again thy knees shall cringe; thy heart Never again shall feel the fear of God! Body and Soul are real and perfectârise! ABEL as before Blasphemy! CAIN Lo! men are weâGods in germ! The earth is real, steadfast beneath our feet, The spacious vision of light is in our eyes, And over us the dark void is fathomless. Under the skies' pavilion, gemmed with stars, On earth's exhaustless breast the flesh can feel The chill and challenge and mystic hush of dawn, The careless largess of the luminous days, The vast of night, the fragrant shadows of sleep, The task, the triumph, the constant truth of life, And death's eventual tranquillity! Yea, even when flesh dissolves in final change Still may it feel the growth of flowers and still Serve the insatiable desire of life! While Soul with passionless and immortal eyes, Sleepless and strained to glimpse eternity, Thro' endless time, ascending avatars, Keeps way and vista to the throne of God And thence beyond to new infinities! Finding no goal it shall not reach and pass And no supremacy it may not share! Rise! rise!âOurs is the choice, be ours the will! Body and soul we cannot be denied! ABEL as before So spake the serpent in the golden glades, So spake the Demon in the ears of Eveâ Blasphemy! To CAIN Ask me no more! I'll hear no more! CAIN Abel! ABEL Be still, lest God should strike thee dumb! CAIN Abel! ABEL Silence! No more! My heart is sick, My brain withers!âO God!âDelirious fool, Dost thou not know that should my soul forget The fear, the power, the sovereignty of God, Then would the mercy of God, the might of God Shelter and guide and comfort me no more? CAIN Abel!âart thou so blind, so abject? Man, Truth is thy guide, thy light is liberty! What need of shelter where no harm impends? What need of comfort where no fears assail? Safety alone is perilous and fear Only is fearful! ABEL So was Eve destroyed! CAIN It cannot be thou art so pitiableâ It cannot be! ABEL So was perfection lost! CAIN It cannot be!âWake from thy trance! the flood Of light shall whelm thee suddenly; Truth shall rise, Strange as a distant land-fall made at dawn, Pure and transcendent in thy darkened ken! Where's the disaster, where's the ruinous loss, The peril thy scared imagination fears? Speak! ABEL Art thou mad? If God's protection fails Where is security and rest and peace? Lacking God's grace what more is left for man Than misery, want, alarm, and loneliness? Always the outcast from the favour of God Must feel the agony of a ceaseless dread Of life and death consume his happiness. I shudder in the mere thought! CAIN It cannot be! Turn from thy cowardice and childish fears! For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; But whosoever shall lose his life for truth And liberty, the same shall save his life! What shall it profit thee if thy life is gained And all the splendour of all the world beside If soul is lost? What shall it profit thee To live sheltered in comfort and content, If thou must yield the soul's inheritance To alien government and forego thy crown, Forfeit thy power and pawn thy liberty? Nothing without can harm or comfort thee; Peril and joy come only from within! Thine is the venture!âseek and thou shalt find, Clasped in the soul's horizons, life and death, Divinity and power and destiny; For in thyself superb attainment lies, Fair in the paths of hope, the range of faith! Thou art the way, thou art the wayfarer, Thou art the guide, the goal, the pilgrimage! Seeking and finding in itself alone, Thy soul must bear the labour and tears of life, And feel the passion and gain the glory of love, And find the eternal thought, the perfect faith, The courage of truth's unconquerable hope! All that we know to-day is ours to-day, And all unknown to-morrow shall be ours! ABEL Better that I should leave thee! I can bear No more! My brain shudders to hear thee speak, As God shakes in his wrath, knowing thy soul! Better that I should leave theeâveil on veil, Darkness is fallen between us utterly: Now are we strangers who were joined in love! Better that I should leave thee!âGo thy ways; Gather the harvest that thy sins have sown! I can endure no more! CAIN A heart so tame, A brain so chilled with fear, such vile disgrace, Sorts with the bastard of a soulless slave, Not with an offspring from the womb of Eve! O man!âAbel! ABEL I'll hear no moreâ He turns away. CAIN The truth Shines like a watch-fire and thou wilt not see; Sounds like a clarion and thou wilt not hear! Why art thou deaf and blind? ABEL I'll stay no more! He takes a step as tho' to depart. CAIN What, must I teach at last these lips of mine Kissed by thy lips so oft, to call thee slave, Coward and traitor?âChild of Eve's rebellion, Abel, art thou a man? ABEL turning upon him fiercely A man I am, Of God's creation and the child of God! Much have I heard thy madness rave and rant, Long have I borne thy blasphemies,âbut now, Better that I should leave thee! He turns resolutely to depart. CAIN Abel! Abel! Abel!âThou wearest the semblance of a man,â The speech, the form, the function!âLeave me? Thou? Knowest thou me?âI am thy brother, Cain! How canst thou leave me?âParadise was lost That we might live and reap the harvest of life! How canst thou leave me while the selfsame blood Throbs in our hearts and thrills our limbs with strength? Are we not men together, you and I? Are we not men? ABEL As God is God!âFarewell! Again ABEL takes a step to depart. CAIN Abel! ABEL pursues his way without turning or answering CAIN'S desperate cry. CAIN Must I believe? In bitter truth Art thou so vile, so abject?âThen, farewell! Leave me! my heart is sick to know thy shame! Leave me!âmy soul abhors thine infamy! Leave me! CAIN covers his face with his hands. ABEL Farewell! ABEL moves away. CAIN takes his hands from his eyes and stands, stirless, watching him depart. His face is haggard. CAIN. Weep, for a soul is lost! Weep, for a heart betrays its human trust! Weep, for a traitor's shame! The Son of Man, Who, in the days to come, shall haply be Himself a Father of Men, has turned from truth! Suddenly CAIN'S face changes as a new thought takes possession of him. Himself a fatherâthenâ CAIN, transfigured, overwhelmed by his thought, leaps forward and seizes ABEL violently by the arm. Thou canst not go! Thou canst not go! Thy soul must see the truthâ Orâ His speech stops suddenly. His eyes stare as tho' confronting a dreadful prospect. ABEL Cain!âRelease me! CAIN Nay, thou canst not go! This hour is more momentous than I dreamed! Man, I forgot that not thy paltry fate Nor mine alone must find decision now! Man, what of thy children, what of them? Thou shalt be sire of daughters and strong sons, Passionate men and women!âAbel! Abel! Turn to the ways of light lest they shall be Beggared of all but servitude and shame! ABEL Madman! Release me!âLet me pass! CAIN Be still, Coward, be still! The scales of judgment bear A freight more precious than all thy dreams have guessed! Fool! dost thou think that were 't thyself alone Standing in jeopardy, I should not now Watch thy desertion in a silent scorn, Choked with the horrour of thy great cowardice? Yea, and how gladly! were my heart assured, Losing thee, to forget my love for thee! Man, how I loved thee!âbut no more of thisâ Heart breaks, yet life constrains our service still, And mine is still to sayâThou canst not go! ABEL If reason is still existent in thy brain, Give me the cause of this extremity! CAIN The cause is grave beyond thy power of thought And holds dominion both for thee and me, Who share the selfsame trust and equally Safeguard the sacred heritage of life. We are not merely men but more than men Since we are pregnant of futurity. We are not measured by the fretful years That span our being, since we store the seed Of myriad generations yet unborn. We are the start of young humanities! We are the spring and freshet of mighty streams, That thro' the reach of the unending years, As thro' vast fields where darkness wars with dawn, Shall keep their fruitful and resistless way! We have within us such an utterance As once proclaimed shall peal forevermore, Echoed and multiplied from age to age, Down thro' the endless labyrinth of time! We are the scabbard of a sword of flame, We are the wardens of the House of Life, We are the guardians of a sacred fire, We are the gates of Dawn,âthe First of Men! Such is the cause!âfor this we shall not yield The torch of freedom to the winds of fear, Nor blight the burgeon from the seed of truth With frost of lies or dust of ignorance! Nay, we must shield the torch and guard the flower; We must be perfect in our sacred trust; We must preserve, in strength and faith and love, Our whole inheritance that all may share! Not for the safety of a mean content, Not in the terrour of a wrathful God, Shall we renounce the treasure and the task, Or sell the birthright of the Sons of Man! ABEL Thy cause compels not me! I know full well There shall be shelter upon the breast of God Thro' all of time, for all the Sons of Men Who live obedient to His perfect will! CAIN There shall be chains for slaves and whips for curs,â But we!âAre we not men?âexpress and whole In all the power and faculty of being? Are we not deathless souls? ABEL Release me! CAIN Never! Never shall I release thee till my hand Shatters the shuttered windows of thy soul, And shows thee, tawdry in the great light of truth, This tinsel majesty, this powerless ghost, This mouthing masque thy fears have hailed as God! ABEL Devil!âRelease me! CAIN Abelâ ABEL No, by Heaven, I will not pander to thy lunacy! CAIN Abel, compel me not! I am a man Driven by desperate emergencies! Never, I swear, shalt thou betray thy trust! Nay, thou must here fulfil thy sacred charge, Shatter thy bondage, cleanse thy soul of lies, Nor evermore, diseased with cowardice, Go forth to life! CAIN is suddenly silent. His eyes are caught by the knife which ABEL had used to sacrifice the lamb and which now lies on the platform where he let it fall. CAIN stares at it in a kind of horrible fascination. ABEL, startled by the sudden break in CAIN'S speech, glances up at his face and then follows his eyes. ABEL sees the knife; he sees CAIN'S expression. At once his face is transfigured with terrour. Silently and desperately he struggles to escape. CAIN holds him without removing his eyes from the knife. ABEL O God, protect me! God, My God, protect me! O my God! CAIN Be still! He turns to ABEL and cries out in a terrible voice. Abel! ABEL O God! CAIN as before Abel! ABEL Merciful God, As I have served Thee in humility, Guard and protect me! CAIN as before Abel! Changing to a tone of desperate entreaty. Not for thee, For me 't is fit to make beseeching prayers! Pity me! Spare me! Man, be true to men! Spare me this deed!âSpare me!âI cannot choose! ABEL Save me, Almighty God! Transcendent God, Save me, thy servant, Abel! CAIN Must it be? O generations of my seed unborn, Children of my conception, Sons of Man! Now for your sakes I tear my heart in twain, Ravage the confines of my life and hurl Down from my shattered heavens the light of joy! Yours is this sacrifice,âfor you, for you, For your salvation, for the Soul of Man! AbelâI love thee with a perfect love! ABEL Devil! Release me!âO my God! My God! CAIN So young he is!âSo young!âO bleeding heart! Man can do nothing more for man than this! He puts forth his hand swiftly and grasps the knife. He shudders. How can I do this deed? ABEL Almighty God, Thy slave implores thee!âSave me! Save me! CAIN drives the knife deep into ABEL'S heart. Cain! The knife drops from CAIN'S hand. He stares at the body of ABEL. His face is haggard. CAIN He is dead! I have killed the man I loved, my brother, Abel! Instantly the scene is plunged in total darkness. A tremendous storm rages. Thro' the thunder of the elements is heard the voice of GOD, pealing like a bell. The voice of GOD Cain! Cain! Where is Abel thy brother? Cain! Cain! Where is Abel thy brother? Cain! Cain! Where is Abel thy brother? A flash of lightning reveals CAIN still standing on the platform with ABEL'S body in his arms, heedless of the elements. ACT III GENESIS CHAPTER IV 9. And the Lord said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper? 10. And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground. 11. And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand; 12. When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth. 13. And Cain said unto the Lord, My punishment is greater than I can bear. 14. Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; AND I SHALL BE A FUGITIVE AND A VAGABOND IN THE EARTH; AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS, THAT EVERY ONE THAT FINDETH ME SHALL SLAY ME. 15. And the Lord said unto him, THEREFORE WHOSOEVER SLAYETH Cain, VENGEANCE SHALL BE TAKEN ON HIM SEVENFOLD. And the Lord set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him. 25. And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel whom Cain slew. The same scene as in Act I. Night: a few hours after the close of Act II. The sky is overcast. In the distance are heard from time to time rumours of storm. EVE appears at the door of the tent. She pauses, listening intently. EVE Silence.âHigh in the sunless, starless, changeless, Infinite void and naked visions of sleep, Treble and clear as chimes, a far voice called: âBereavement!â Again she listens intently. Silence.âThe hours with noiseless feet, Vacant and solitary and passionless, Have found me vigilant of the voiceless night. My heart has heard the heart of silence beat; Mine eyes have stared into the dense, dead, dark, Desolate visions of calamity And glimpsed the lurking demon of despair, While in my veins the violent life-blood beat Like muffled thunder! Again she listens. Silenceâand no lightâ NothingâO Lord, how long?âWhere are my sons? Where are my children?âAbel!âCain!âMy sons! Again she listens. SilenceâMy heart will break! My heart will break! The voice of CAIN from without Mother! EVE At last! The voice of CAIN Mother! EVE The voice of Cain! Cain! Is it thou? CAIN entering Mother! CAIN is wild and tragic. EVE stares at him, startled and anxious. EVE What ails thee, child? Speak, dear one, speak! CAIN Mother! EVE My darling, come! Lie on my breastâI love thee, love theeâCome! Weep if thou mustâthe tears will ease thy pain. Come to me, come! CAIN remains stirless, silent, haggard. Cain!âChildâWhat ails thee?âSpeak! Thy face is scared and tragic as my heartâ Why art thou strange? What is thy message? Speak! If irremediable calamity Smites me once more, if fate is pitiless, Still let me know the worst!âit can be never More dire an agony than this suspense! CAIN Mother! The voice of GOD Cain! Cain! Where is Abel thy brother? EVE starts back, panic-stricken. CAIN remains as before. EVE His voice!âHis voice!âGardens of Paradise! Midnight of desolation!âWild despair! Dear God, I thought forgetfulness was earned! But now the mountain, builded from the dust Of all the lonely and lamentable years, Quakes, and the crater's mouth so long time dumb That flowers had rooted in the thrifty sod, Flashes with fire from the volcanic past! Now by His voice, the voice of God, the shroud, Weaved by the patient hands of Time, is rent; The stone is shattered on the sepulchre, And Death, gaunt Captain of a tragic host, Marshals his legions on the fields of thought! His voiceâO Cain, hearest thou the voice of God? CAIN Motherâ EVE His voice!âWhat new catastrophe Impends? The voice of GOD Cain! Cain! Where is Abel thy brother? EVE Abel? CAIN Motherâ EVE Cain! CAIN Hear me! Hear me! EVE Cain! Where is thy brother Abel?âAbel!âAbel! Why art thou here alone? The voice of GOD What hast thou done? CAIN Motherâit must be thou shalt understand! Mother! EVE Where is thy brother Abel? CAIN Dead! The voice of GOD The voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground! EVE Dead?âCain! Your eyes! Answer me face to face! Abel is dead?âMy child is dead?âand youâ Why are you here alone?âAnswer me!âCain, Put both your arms about me pitifully: Mine is the very life thro' all your veins; Body and soul were sacrificed, great woes And dire travail endured that you might live! Close me within your strong embrace, your breast Here on my breast that bled to nourish you, And tell meâCain, my first-born and most lovedâ He is not dead? CAIN Mother! EVE It cannot be! Abel! Abel! Abel! CAIN His ears are deaf, His eyes are blind. Thy heart and mine may break, He shall not care:âthe man is dead. EVE No! No! God pity me! God pity me! CAIN His soul Failed in the test of truth; he could not bear The burden and the power of lifeâand now, Now is he lapsed into oblivion. EVE O son!âAbel!âMy child! CAIN My heart will break! EVE Abel, most young and loveliest child of earth, Last and most tender of the sons of man, Mine was thy life, thy death must now be mine! Come to me, Death, divine and silent Death! Shed from thy noiseless wings eternal sleep, Pour thine elixir thro' the veins of life, Spirit of Death, resistless, secret Death! Since thou hast laid thy finger on his lips Who was my child, thou canst not leave me here Telltale of life's disaster, starved of hope, Curious of nothing in the days to come! Change in thine alchemy the days of life To thine eternity, the fever of life To thy tranquillity, the memories Of life at last to thy forgetfulness! Since thou hast plucked the flower and bruised the bud, Wither the stalk, uproot the parent stem, Scatter thine ashes, blight the wasted sod! Let me not linger with my broken heart To watch with visionless and tearless eyes The desolation of my destiny! Nay, let me perish since my child is deadâ I can endure no more! CAIN Thou canst not die! Not alms but wages life demands of death. Life must be suffered for the sake of life. And thenâMother! thy sons were twain,âO Heart, Wilt thou abandon me? The voice of GOD Cain! Cain! Now art thou cursed from the earth, Which hath opened her mouth To receive thy brother's blood From thy hand! EVE Silence! I sayâSilence!âHis voice has lied! God's voice has lied! But soul is steadfastâCain! So vile a slander fails its damned intent: Not by thy hand! Not by thy hand!âSpeak! Speak! Speak to me! A brief, tense interval of silence. The voice of GOD Cain! Where is thy brother Abel? CAIN in violent outbreak Am I my brother's keeper? Nay, by Heaven! I am the keeper of the gates of life; I guard the treasure of all humanity: Mine, mine is life's inevitable trust, Mine is the sacred heritage of man! Are not the generations stored within me? Shall not the harvest yield as I shall sow? Is not the trust my life was made to keep Vexed by the hand that mars the perfect seed Or robs their birthright from the sons of man? How shall I suffer that such a traitor live When by his life the future world is doomed To stumble in the shadow of ignorance Stung by the lash of self-inflicted fears? Shall I not rather with violence even and death Safeguard the treasure in jeopardy and keep Flawless the sacred seed? What less than all His just inheritance of power and light And liberty can man bequeath to man? Motherâwhen Abel sought to pawn the treasure, Pollute the seed, debase the soul of manâ What could I do but strike the traitor down? EVE Silence! Silence! CAIN Heart breaks but soul is free! EVE Heart breaks! CAIN I loved himâyet he might not live! EVE shrinking suddenly from him Murderer! CAIN Hear meâ EVE Murderer! CAIN Be still! By God rejected, cursed and shunned by man, My heart took refuge in the thought of thee! Wilt thou desert me?âI am Cain, thy son: Thine by the very deed thy heart abhors! Soul of thy soul, flesh of thy flesh I am! EVE Thou liest! My son is dead! CAIN I am thy son! EVE I know thee not!âWhere is thy brother Abel? CAIN He is where all is dumb, deserted, dead; He lies alone, cold on the mountain's peak; His shroud is moonlight; round his lofty bed Great planets veer from verge to verge of heaven, Like ships of light cleaving a shoreless sea; The universal multitude of stars Stare in his sightless eyes; beside his corpse My broken heart, my whole life's happiness, Lie in the still companionship of death! O I have slain him to my misery! EVE To thy damnation hast thou slain a man! CAIN For man's salvation have I slain a man! And now, now as thou art my justicer, Now as my soul lies bare at thy command, Now shalt thou answer, serving truth in turn: Tell me where's Eden? where is Paradise? Where is the loveliness that pleasured thee? Where is God's grace that filled thy delicate days With ripe contentment and surpassing peace? Where are the candid and beneficent joys? Where is the primal innocence of man? EVE I will not speak! CAIN My cause demandsâ EVE No more! Ask me no more! CAIN At last light breaks within you! EVE Silence! Thy words are senseless to my soul. Paradise?âEden?âthey are lost, God knows! Lost beyond hopeâI know not whither nor where. Pure and serene as starlight was my being, Till time and truth, parents of tragedy, Scrawled on the tablets of my virgin heart, As scrawls a stylus on a stainless scroll, The passionate chronicle of life and death. Clear were mine eyes and questionless as flowers Till the flame-flashing sword of Cherubim Blinded my vision to all God's glory and grace. My lips were flushed with laughter and soul slept, Careless of destiny:âbut now mine eyes Are deep with dreams, desires and lamentation; Still on my lips beneath the taste of tears Lingers the fruit's immortal savour; still Soul thrills with revelation!âSense and soul Live and rememberâhow can God forget? And unforgetful how can God forgive, Or teach my feet the paths to Paradise? Eden is lost, the light of grace is quenched, Gone is the primal innocence of man! CAIN Goneâgoneâshuddering, fading, lost, lost, lost: How deep a burial are the seas of time! All that lived once immediate to our souls, All that our lives were governed and pleasured with, Pass and when memory stares with doubtful eyes Well-nigh her scroll is vacant of their names. Eden is goneâremembrance knows not where; Yet, by its loss, was man's existence changed, Man's soul transformed: thy hand that grasped the fruit, Why was it so supremely hazardous? What hope compelled thy venture on the seas, The sullen shattered waters of God's wrath? EVE I served lifeâlife compelled meâlife was born, Born of my deed, and life's creative pangs Lifted my heart, where love leaped like a flame, Beyond the bare desire of happiness. Ask me no more the wherefore of my deeds, Ask me no more!âWhen first my brain conceived Rebellion, and my heart careless of peril Felt the ineffable longing of liberty, How could I then withhold my impassioned hand, Measure my hopes with vile arithmetic Or count the hazard of my enterprise? My compass veered, seeking the pole of truth; Wind smoothed and swelled my lean and wrinkled sails; My hawser snapped:âheadlong I took the seas! When suddenly life demanded utterance Was not the destiny of life within me To make or mar?âDear God, I could not choose! I turned from God, imminent of my sons, And like a priestess at the altar of life Offered the irrevocable sacrifice And grasped the ripe inheritance of man! CAIN Mother of men! EVE Vain beauty of Paradise, Barren desire and search of happiness, Well-nigh of your remembrance is my heart Vacant and vain repentance moves not me. There was a woman innocent in Eden, Glad of her childish laughter and fragile joys, Scatheless of passionate rapture,âshe is dead.â Is dead, and her repentant heart no more Beats in a breast bruised with the lips of children.â The freed slave weeps not for his manacles Nor can a mother's heart repent her sons. CAIN At last, Spirit of Life, maternal Heart! At last still steadfast, still unconquerable, Still undismayed I find you tho' despair Cover you with impenetrable shadow! Mother of Men, Cain is your very son! Your words furnish my deed's apology And plead the justice of my fratricide. My heart leaps to your welcome, all my heart! Mother! EVE Be still! I know not what you mean. I know but thisâAbel, Abel is dead: Dead by the murder of your pitiless hands! Blood-guilt and madness have depraved your sense! Yet was he very gentle and a childâ Why hast thou killed him? CAIN When my brain conceived Rebellion, and my heart careless of peril Felt the ineffable longing of liberty, How could I then withhold my impassioned hand? EVE Why must you turn my words to shameful jest? Why in sheer insult must you mock my grief? CAIN You wrong my soul! Mother, what is within me Seeking translation from my thought to yours Puts in my mouth what words will serve its end. O I am too tragic of all my thoughts and deeds Too strained past life's endurance of despair, Had I the will, to mock your misery! Hear me and let the sword your justice draws Hang on the thread of my relation.âI Share your catastropheâ EVE Say onâGod knows It matters nothing since my son is dead. CAIN Dead!âand my love was only less than yours! Enough!âthere has been too much said of sorrow. Hear me: my tale shall witness what I am. Alone with Abel in the splendour of evening I stood exalted on the mountain's crest, Far in the firmamental solitudes. We saw together the earth, how fair it was, Charted beneath us, and the globe of heaven Poised in august serenity and stained With sapphire, saffron, and vermilion. Heart leaped with wonder! Then was Abel moved, Staining with blood the stone of sacrifice, To fawn on God with such base flatteries As might a slave cringed at his master's feet! Shame scourged my soulâI poured the lustral oil, Spilled the new wine, scattered the tender grain, And sought, mindful of human dignity, God's fellowship that God may share with man. And thenâthenâthenâGod's voice rejected me! Canst thou believe? God's voice rejected me! Even then, then as heart swelled with nameless love, Then as within me a so stainless hope, A faith so perfect filled my being with light, Then as from man to God my soul aspired With power and incommensurable peace,â Then, then God's voice rejected me! My soul Shuddered like to a ship that strikes and drowns; I was dumb; night whelmed me; the world reeled with storm; Chaos was in my brain, and fierce despair Stunned my conception.âThen as one who feels The shapes of nightmare fade in the first light, I felt the ghosts of fear and weak despair Fade in the breath of a stupendous dawn! For in the passion of my peril I sought And found at last who God is, what I am. As daybreak lifted ever a larger light, Then all the pageant of the past unrolled: And I beheld, grave with immortal meaning, Clear in the unconquerable van of thought, The dire, dim legend of man's innocence, The secret of all God's jealous tyranny, The tree which God's commandment strove to keep Inviolateâall the marvel and might of knowledge, The power of life, the glory of rebellion, The fire and love of liberty, the pride Of freedom, poverty, solitude, and pain: All the delight and all the tragedy And all the burden of manhoodâand the soul Won at so huge a cost from Paradise! Shining in the white light of revelation The past stood in my vision and within me The present hour of life flashed like a flame; And far, far in the unfathomable, far beyond To-day or the dumb Ã¦ons of yesterday, I saw the vistas of To-morrow fill With life asking its just inheritance! Mother!âso once for thee magnificently The vision dawned: so even for me it dawned! And I, nobly resolved in equal trust, Master of man's prodigious destinies, Eloquent of august expectancies, Elate desires, faith ineludible,â I turned to Abel, brimmed the bowl of love Deep with new wine of light and gave his soul The lustral cup, the great communion! I cried, âShare with me all the treasure and task!â A brief pause of intense silence. Mother! EVE No!âNo! CAIN As God rejected me, Abel rejected me. I was alone! EVE Aloneâ CAIN Outlawed from man's love and God's mercy,â Yet for the sake of man!âfor Abel chose To take the hire and bondage and forego The inherent spiritual arbitrament Of manhood for the sins and deeds of life. Standing against me by the throne of Heaven, He chose to forfeit all the lustre of living, And thus, beggared of human quality, Barren of sin or virtue, void of truth, Scared at the flashing fire of liberty, To seek contentment at the feet of God. And then, then, as he cursed me turned and fled,â Suddenly as the sea-wind lifts at dawn And shakes the constellated canopy Of heaven and murmurs wandering thro' the silence,â As thou, hesitant ere thy young lips crushed the fruit, I felt the destiny of man within us To make or marâin himâin meâin man! I called, beseeched himâhe was stunned with fear Of God's revenge; he cowered, turned, and fled! And then, just as the all-reviving sun, Even as one who guards a sanctuary, I struck the traitor down!âHe might not live To breed a sickness in humanity And bring pollution to the springs of life. The voice of GOD Cain! Cain! Now art thou cursed from the earth, Which hath opened her mouth To receive thy brother's blood From thy hand! There follows a pause of great silence. CAIN looks at EVE with eyes of anxious expectancy. CAIN Abel is deadâGod speaksâand thou art silent: My punishment is greater than I can bear! EVE the words breaking from her like a cry of pain My son!âMy child! CAIN Mother! EVE O Cain, Cain, Cain! Dear God, can life suffer such monstrous things Nor die delirious of its agonies! This is worst, to understand thee as I do, To love thee living and Abel dead,âand all, All by thy perfect and implacable deed! O God! love is a bitter catastrophe! To understand thee as I do!âBehold, My feet pash in his blood to come to thee! I reach scared hands across his corpse to grasp Thy nervous fingers stained with fratricide, And drowned in the dark tears I weep for him Mine eyes appeal, my voice beseeches thee! Come to me, Child, thou who hast slain my child! Tragic Adventurer, come home to me! ComeâcomeâI crave thee with my sorrow's strength: Here are my arms, here is my breastâI love thee! Light burns my brainâI understandâI knowâ Child, thou hast torn the veils and pitilessly Shown me the inhuman, flawless face of truth. At last I know Life is indomitable, Ruthless because resistless; yea, and feel The irreparable necessity of death,â Tho' Abel lies lifeless beneath the stars! Come home to me,âthy tears shall blend with mine. Weep! Weep! so pitiable is man's destiny! For now, since I have utterly harvested The whole heavy inheritance of sin And sucked the apple of Eden to the core, Now is my knowledge more than I can bear! Bankrupt to pay the dreadful price of truth, I must default all lesser debts of life. O I am broken-souled and solitary! Strong Son of Man, come home, I need thy love! Let us together, voiceless of our woes, Weld heart to broken heart, spirit to spirit, Since not alone can heart or soul endure The inveteracy of life and death and truth! The voice of GOD Cain! Cain! When thou tillest the ground, It shall not henceforth yield to thee her strength; A fugitive and a vagabond Shalt thou be in the earth! A pause. Then suddenly, EVE in a terrible voice Childless! CAIN heedless of her cry; to himself: Destiny! Yea! His voice proclaims What must be so, the sheer inevitable, My deed's fulfilment since the choice is made. I must desire my life lived otherwise To ask new destinies for the man I am. NoâNoâthe price is just:âI choose to pay! For past and future I will be forever A fugitive from fear's safe prison-house, A vagabond of truth's confineless realm, A homeless pilgrim of the Great Idea! EVE Childless!âO God, pity me! God pity me! CAIN Hush! God is powerless and His violent hands Vacant of mercy or vengeance or dominion. Knowledge is freedom: and for this last truth My life has paid with bloodshed and bitter sorrow. Believe! Beseech not! for the threads of fate Escape the violence of God's sheer caprice, And on the warp of nature's tapestry Subtly devise the pattern of men's lives. God is like one who by the wayside stands And points to each the inevitable way That leads him where his will has fixed the goal; Or like a herald on the battlements, Vigilant of the stars processional, Who, when the Virgin and the Huntsman stand Midmost upon their stately journey, calls âMidnight!ââand all the sleeping City of Life Murmurs, âHis word has fixed the vagrant stars And brought to sequence and establishment The mutable multitude of the errant hours!â And even as such a one is powerless, Stretching his debile hands, to leash the Bear, Tether the Lion, bind the Pleiades, Or change the gradual periods of Time, So God is powerless to enact his will, But, watchful from the tower of thought, proclaims The imminent and inexorable truth. Voiced like the thunder, like the thunder he Hurls not the lightning but proclaims its fall. He is the creature of our cowardice, The name by which we conjure, when at last Suddenly revelation racks the soul With prescience of the inexorable truth. I am the Lord of Life, who find my path,â Haply in twilightâyet the day spring flows! Each shall pronounce and bear his doom save God; For, tho' our fears conceive him, he is not. Life shall transpire in his despite and death Minister to the weary wayfarer: The flower shall not be wasted from its bloom Nor winter yield in the creative sod At his command but as their Nature wills. EVE HushâHushâIt matters nothing.âAbel is dead; Thou shalt departâand leave me childless, childless! CAIN Mother, it must be as the soul demands: Justice shall not refrain nor truth relent: What is shall be endured. For life's sole sake Wast thou creative. Ask no more of life Than life, for life has nothing more to giveâ No alms for misery, no wage for toilâ And nothing less in all the days to come. Beauty and happiness are casual gifts, Superfluous splendour of the spendthrift days, Pearls that adorn the sombre robes of life, Gathered at random on the shores of time. The fruit is of thy labour and pain and peril, Yet life that sows shall reap the harvest. So, So and forever we sorrow and serve till life Breaks like a lute-string drawn beyond its strength. What is the love that made thee mother of men But life's imperishable desire for life, The mounting sap, the elemental lust, Blent in thy heart's alembic with the light Of lovelier and still human ecstasies? O Heart, what more or less is love than this? EVE Ask me no more! My brain is dying, my heart Is dying, my body is dying of life's wounds! As me no moreâGod pity me! God pity me! The voice of GOD Cain! Cain! A fugitive and a vagabond Shalt thou be in the earth! EVE Childless! CAIN Nor God, nor life shall pity thee; But truth shall show thee by what light we live When all is lost. EVE I know for you the light Shall lift and revelations wake for you. Yours shall be all the great and lonely joys, The ecstasy of the imperishable thought And breathless visions of truth's impartial fire Dawning on vast horizons of the soul! Your days shall be ascending avatars; You shall transcend the realms of time's control, And pass entire to that eternity Glimpsed by the soul's astronomers whose eyes Catch the brief spendour as the fragments flash Like meteors thro' the stagnant night of life! But I, I who am Eve and mother of men, Robbed by the hands of death and by God's handsâ What is prepared for me? Behold me, Cain: My life is naked, no magnificence Shall lift the darkness from my haunted eyes! Cain, I am childless! CAIN Yet creative still! Still shalt thou suffer and weary for thy children, Tho' truth it is Abel shall come no more At nightfall, tenderly, to comfort thee, And truth it is that in the populous earth I shall be fugitive and vagabond, Hid from God's face and from the face of man; And truth it is that for the sole truth's sake All men who find and know me as I am Shall rise and slay me in a frenzied fear. The voice of GOD Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, Vengeance shall be taken on him seven-fold! EVE Vengeance for Cain? Vengeance, by God's decree, For Cain, Life's Captain, victor of his cause In earth and heaven against God's legionaries? Vengeance for Cain, for Cain the fratricide? A seven-fold vengeance doomed by God's decree On whomsoever shall slay the slayer of man? Verily then the voice of God proclaims, Obedient to the inexorable truth, Not His resistless will but what must be! And yetâwhy vengeance for the death of Cain? Wherefore from all men and above all men Shall Cain be saved? CAIN I am the torch-bearer! EVE Till now my tears have blinded me; at last I see and know,âthou art the Son of Man, Thou art the Saviourâand my son, my son! Love and forgive me! for the blood of Abel Rose, a red mist between thy soul and mine! Now I am weak no more; I say to thee: Go forth, go forth, lonely and godlike man! My heart will follow tho' my feet must stay. Yet in thy solitude shall there be a woman To care for thee thro' the incessant days, To lie beside thee in the desolate nights, To love thee as thy soul shall love the truth! In her thy generation shall conceive Passionate daughters, strong and fierce-eyed sons To lift the light and bear the labour of truth Whereof the spark is mine, the fire is thine! Men of thy seed shall scourge the face of God; Women of her conception shall deride The laws of men! Singly they come forever To scare God in His heavenly palaces, To shake the sleep of the lethargic world, To wreck establishments and bring to scorn Laws and obediences and cast Wrathful derision on the creeds of peace! The fire you bear invincibly shall pass, Imperishably shall burn from hand to hand, From age to ageâno power can quench the flame Flashed from the dawn of soul's eternity!â And nowâGo! Go! Leave me or else I die! Go! while the power is in me,âlest I yield! CAIN Farewell! Woman, the voice of prophecy Speaks in your mouthâthe light shall never die. I love you, love you with a measureless love! EVE Cain!âCain! CAIN Farewell! My will and mine alone Has made me outcast from the laws of men, And from God's laws, and from the homes of men. I am the man I am: no cause but this Has cast me naked and lonely from the pale, To wander, alien in the Academe, Cursed and derided in the market-place, Slandered and scourged before the shrines of God. O I shall weary with all the woes of the world! And when I shall lift up the immortal light Like dawn in the dark places of men's souls, All men shall hail it as a ruinous fire Born for their world's destruction; they shall rise, Nerved with ferocious fear, and hale me forth, Seize me, traduce me, judge me, and condemn,â And press the hemlock to my unshrinking lips Or nail my scourged flesh naked to the cross! EVE Yet shall the great light live! CAIN It shall not die! Farewell! CAIN turns and moves away. The night is ended. On the remote edge of the world, under a line of dark clouds, the young dawn glows, tawny and splendid. CAIN goes forth straight into the dawn. EVE watches him rapt, transfixed, haggard, agonized. His figure grows small in the distance. The dawn greatens. Suddenly from the tent is heard the voice of ADAM, just waking from sleep. The voice of ADAM Eve! EVE shudders and slowly turns her eyes toward the tent. ADAM appears in the door. ADAM Eve!âwhere art thou? EVE with a great cry I am woman! Mother of menâand childless, childless, childless!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME II THE GREAT ADVENTURE THE SOUL'S INHERITANCE AND OTHER POEMS HERAKLES THE GREAT ADVENTURE TO W. S. B. I LIFE [I Pride, power and substance of created things] Pride, power and substance of created things, Gross, vital element of all that is, Womb of interminable pregnancies, Perennial source of earth's resurgent Springsâ O Life! crude matrix that forever clings To thought's clear diamond, dark chrysalis Big with prodigious birth, unsunned abyss Headlong beneath the soul's Icarian wings! When, as my peers before me, I shall fall Shattered with light, and, lost beyond recall, Mix and resolve in thy creative slime,â Thence shall I rise in endless avatars, And still once more, for Truth's eternal stars, Leap from the cloud-capped battlements of Time! II PRIMAVERA Spirit immortal of mortality, Imperishable faith, calm miracle Of resurrection, truth no tongue can tell, No brain conceive,ânow witnessed utterly In this new testament of earth and sea,â To us thy gospel! Where the acorn fell The oak-tree springs: no seed is infidel! Once more, O Wonder, flower and field and tree Reveal thy secret and significance! And we, who share unutterable things And feel the foretaste of eternity, Haply shall learn thy meaning and perchance Set free the soul to lift immortal wings And cross the frontiers of infinity. [III Life gives the pass-key of his treasure-house] Life gives the pass-key of his treasure-house Into our hand, saying, âWhat diadem, What gold of glory, what illustrious gem Man shall desire of me, shall crown his brows!â And nothing of all man's choice Life disallows, Whether of prized or priced or priceless things: By the feast-tables heaped with offerings, âEnter!â he cries to all men, âand carouse!â And thus after our will, in greed and haste, For certain years we choose and use and waste, Suffer and strive:âsave some few restless men Who seek, uncrowned, unfriended, alien And careless of the flushed festivity, The path thro' life and death to liberty! [IV Unspeakable are the felicities] Unspeakable are the felicities Of labour and long endurance for the Truth: Love's sea at flood in the rash heart of Youth, Freedom and spiritual ecstasies! Incredible are the discoveries Of Life's adventure: on the high, outcast, Star-severed pathways Life may stand at last Thrilled witness of the soul's divinities! And always Night beyond!âinfinite, strange, Teeming, inviolate, where the peaks of thought, Flushed by an unseen Dawn, superbly range Down the long frontiers whence the restless soul, Forward, beyond the last and best it sought, Still finds a path, a prospect and a goal! [V We trod into the starlight, into the night] We trod into the starlight, into the night; The ways of our deliverance were not mild: Long had we been contented and beguiled, And long importunate lovers of the light. Long had we sought and scorned the false delight Of perishable things and things defiled,â Reckless at last we passed unreconciled Out thro' the darkness in all men's despite. And much we suffered, and spent our strength and youth On the steep paths, and lived in loneliness, Till, as our life-blood fed the lamp of Truth, Ruin rent down the fortress-walls of Fear, And light was kindled in the blind, austere Ways of the soul's eternal restlessness. [VI Twilight of Truth's unfettered wanderings] Twilight of Truth's unfettered wanderings! Skies of supreme adventure, lightning-crossed! Tho', as we soar alone, perchance, and lost, Strange ethers yield beneath our desperate wings, The diapason of Life's singing strings, Large as the pensive murmur of still seas, May reach us, and of all Truth's galaxies Haply one star console our sufferings. We stand, at least, too far beyond to heed The protest vacant and grandiloquent Of timid, rich and pious men: the event Is ours to win or lose, and ours the faith That he who sows the Truth's immortal seed Shall harvest in the fields of life and death! VII TUCKANUCK 1 Take me away to the sea, O carry me Down to the sea where there is space and light, Where stars abound in the gigantic night, Where soul and flesh are unconstrained and free! Carry me back! for I once more would see The midnight sky's moon-silvered azurite, The calm lagoon at noonday wide and white,â Carry me down! O take me to the sea! O take me hence to the innumerable Deep-rumouring waters! Let me feel the core Of life reÃ«cho like a chambered shell The voice and motion of the immensity! Carry me back!âO Soul, from Life's dark shore Take me away forever to the Sea! [VIII Powerful, patient, vast serenity ] 2 Powerful, patient, vast serenity Of Nature's fathomless tranquillities: Inviolate silence of the starlit skies, Deep respiration of the windless sea: There may we rear the towers of thought in thee, Pluck forth the secret from the Sphinx's eyes, Ransom from countless chance captivities Man's inarticulate divinity! There may we find the faith which dares disown Nothing that is, the faith by which alone We, peradventure, shall be justified; There may the Soul go forth and there return Or here no more, but pass from bourne to bourne, Ever from life to life unsatisfied! [IX Shall we return, return once more and stand ] 3 Shall we return, return once more and stand There where at sunset we may thrill to see The skies flash kindling like the noontide sea, The birds pass seaward from the darkling land? Shall we return and on the stainless sand Hear, as of old, the waves' wild minstrelsy, And feel once more the heart within us free, The soul within us strong to understand?â We shall return! and in the silence find Ever the nameless peace, the calm delight, The spacious meditations of the mind, Wherein, dilate with Truth's unfailing breath, Our souls may witness Life's immortal light Fill the dark chambers of the House of Death. [X There may we learn at daybreak and nightfall, ] 4 There may we learn at daybreak and nightfall, As day and dusk and darkness cover us, With earth and sky and the omniverous Infinite sea of ceaseless flood and fall,â There may we learn how love is spiritual And death divine and life illustrious, There may we find at last the fabulous Truth and compose the soul's high ritual. There may we haply find ourselves, the goal, Ourselves, the source of all enlightenment, And thus discern how earth and sky and sea And love and life and death and destiny Are wrought of one eternal element Quarried in dim deep strata of the Soul. [XI We loved too perfectly for praise ] 5 We loved too perfectly for praise The spread of noon's sun-startled sea, We loved the large tranquillity Of flowing distances and days. In calm, dark sunsets or the blaze Of moonlit waves, the ecstasy And spacious thought of liberty Thrilled us in deep and silent ways. We loved too much for song or speech The stars' exalted loneliness, And in the tacit tenderness Of hearts thrown open each to each We found the perfect peace that brings A foretaste of eternal things. [XII We loved the illimitable night ] 6 We loved the illimitable night, We loved the interminable sea, We loved, on flower and vine and tree, The candid foliage wet with light. We loved the thunder and the might Of mountains and ineffably We loved the power that made us be Lovers of life and life's delight. We loved the innocent joys of earth, The poise and peace of natural things, We loved the miracle of birth; We loved, beyond life's last release, The shadow as of stirless wings, The silence and majestic peace. [XIII We found a symbol and significance ] 7 We found a symbol and significance In day by day the changed and changeless sea, In night by night each glittering galaxy, The cosmic pageant and extravagance. Lost in the devious labyrinth of chance We sought the endless thread of liberty, And in the shadow of the Mystery We watched for light with sleepless vigilance. Yet still how far soever we climbed above The nether levels, always, like a knife, We felt the chill of fear's blind bitter breath: For still a secret crazed the heart of Love, An endless question blurred the eyes of Life, A baffling silence sealed the lips of Death. [XIV How often in the tranquil evenings ] 8 How often in the tranquil evenings, There by the kindled sea's immense unrest, Has love, like music in the human breast, Thrilled us with incommunicable things! How often, as we watched the sea-birds' wings Flash in the sunset on their homeward quest, Have life's large secrets, by the soul confessed, Taught us the pride and peace that freedom brings! How often have we felt the calm of thought Quell the storm-shaken waters of the soul, Till, land-locked by the cliffs of Time, they caught The silent gleam of Truth's unchanging stars, And felt the universal ocean roll, Muffled and vast, on Life's dissolving bars! [XV O South-wind, silvered by the crescent moon ] 9 O South-wind, silvered by the crescent moon, Breathe on my shadowed sail and carry me Homeward across the sunset-coloured sea, The rose and violet of the calm lagoon. There where the high and homeless stars shall soon Thrill the vast darkness singly, silently, Carry me back, O South-wind, tenderly Thro' the gold dusk of closing afternoon. And as thou bear'st me on my homeward way, With what few leaves of Truth's immortal wreath, What spiritual, secret victories, Are mine; so, homeward from life's little day, The golden-winged, star-silvered wind of death Shall take the soul with all its argosies. [XVI In some clear, crystalline, calm-murmuring ] 10 In some clear, crystalline, calm-murmuring Midnight, or when the cloud-sierras rise Massive and flame-swept in the sunset skies, Or in the noonday broad and glittering, We shall return! The endless wind shall bring Sea-perfumes and sea-rumours and the cries Of scattered sea-birds, while our shrunken eyes Grow spacious in the vast horizon's ring. There day by day in high intelligence Of Nature, we shall learn her parable; We shall explore thought's wide circumference; We shall return at last! and find the soul, By indications untransmissible, Always the steadfast centre and the goal! XVII ODYSSEUS He strove with Gods and men in equal mood Of great endurance: not alone his hands Wrought in wild seas and laboured in strange lands, And not alone his patient strength withstood The clashing cliffs and Circe's perilous sands: Eager of some imperishable good He drave new pathways thro' the trackless flood Foreguarded, fearless, free from Fate's commands. How shall our faith discern the truth he sought? We too must watch and wander till our eyes, Turned sky-ward from the topmost tower of thought, Haply shall find the star that marked his goal, The watch-fire of transcendent liberties Lighting the endless spaces of the soul. XVIII KALYPSO Sorceress of his charmed captivity, Of all love's gifts she was munificent; Yet was he unpersuaded to content Incurious of love's warm felicity, Fain of departure on the treacherous sea: Heedless he was whether his life were spent In shipwreck on the cruel element, So he were homeward bound, so he were free! And even as he adventured life and cast Pleasure and passion from his home-sick heart, Still, tho' in exile, mindful of his goal; So, after long enslavements, we, at last Reckless and undissuaded, shall depart, Free and bound outward, homeward to the soul! XIX EGYPT Reliquary Time's vicissitude, Proof of persistent change, and prophecy,â Rapt in thy myths and monuments I see Visions that throng thy soundless solitude: The pageant of a rumouring multitude, The celebration and the mystery Of occult and august Divinity Sculptured in hieratic attitude;â Till I discern across the shadow of years The self-same tragic life and death of men, The passion and the pathos and the tears, The love and labour of humanity: And know at last, tho' Time's abysmal sea Divide us, yet we are not alien! [XX In Time's cathedral Memory, like a ghost] In Time's cathedral Memory, like a ghost Crouched in the narrow twilight of the nave, Fumbles with thin pathetic hands to save Relics of all things lived and loved and lost. Life fares and feasts and Memory counts the cost With unrelenting lips that dare confess Life's secret failures, sins and loneliness And life's exalted hopes, defiled and crossed. Shalt thou endure, O Memory, and thy breath Quicken the dead in thy dominion And fire the peaks of thought we dared to climb, When, in the swift relentless chill of death, The crawling ice-floes of oblivion Strangle thy passage thro' the seas of Time? [XXI O Memory, Mistress of the heart's despair] O Memory, Mistress of the heart's despair, Spirit of solitude and silent tears, Pilgrim thro' twilights of departed years Peopled with ghosts of all that once we wereâ Pale vampire of the graves of Time, forbear! Suffer the dead to rest! each ghost appears Desolate in thy darkened atmospheres, And joy is bitter and pain is perfect there. Thine are the days gone irretrievably:â Forbear, O Memory, for the heart will break! Unless the Soul shall, peradventure, wake Wonderfully, and, elate with mystic powers, Rend as with lightnings of eternity The graves of the interminable hours! [XXII. Days that have been and nevermore shall be] Days that have been and nevermore shall be, Children of Time the sword of Time has slain, Great hours of life when heart and soul were fain Of Love's pure fire and Truth's eternity,â Now, on the marches of that dim domain And desolate sunset-land of Memory, Ye rise like tortured ghosts and silently Walk in the sombre twilights of the brain. And we, like pilgrims on the path of Time Who find no rest nor any dwelling-place, We follow blindly in Life's retinue, While, like the furies of Orestes' crime, The spectral hosts of Memory on our trace Innumerably assemble and pursue. XXIII QUESTIONS Curious of life and love and death they stand Outward along the shadowy verge of thought; Rebels and deicides, they rise unsought And spare no creed and yield to no command. Even tho' at last we seem to understand, Yet, when our eyes grow sphered to the new light, We find them, outposts in the forward night, Their eyes still restless with the same demand. On all the heights and at the farthest goal Set by the seers and christs of yesterday They watch and wait and ask the onward way; They storm the citadels of faith and youth, And, gazing always for the stars of Truth, Crowd in the glimmering windows of the Soul. XXIV TO NIGHT Thou canst console our sad humanity With dreams of unimagined loveliness, Or cast the shadow of forgetfulness Over the haggard eyes of memory. The deep unrest of man's infinity Thou canst appease, for all thy stars confess The living soul's imprisoned loneliness, And heart finds liberty alone in thee. Thou shalt complete us all who love and learn The secret of thy silences, till we Arise regenerate from the throes of strife, And in thine all-receptive peace discern The ineffable presence of eternity Waiting forever at the gates of life. [XXV Thus were our lives resolved! âThe Dawn,â we said] Thus were our lives resolved! âThe Dawn,â we said, âIs somewhere since the light is everywhere; Pinnacled in the universal air The tower of thought, we must believe, shines red!â By blind belief at all adventure led, Thus were our lives resolved at last to dare. Also we knew that up the endless stair Socrates and some few were gone ahead. But when at length we climbed into the light, In wild alarm we saw how far it springs Across death's void impassable atmosphere,â Then, as our great resolve grew sick with fear, We felt the freedom and the infinite Ambition of the soul's expanded wings! II LOVE TO HER [I O sea, nature's eternal palimpsest,] O sea, nature's eternal palimpsest, O stars that dawn, as memories one by one Break on the dark void of oblivion, O poem of love that fills the fragile nest,â Whisper to me! Stir me to great unrest, O passionate chaunt! Immortal antiphon, Proud pÃ¦an of life that peals from sun to sun, From flower to flower, from human breast to breast, Sound in my soul! and thou, O heart, resound, O lips, proclaim! for where her lips have clung There must the lyric pulse beat tense and strong; And where she lives with love must life abound With music unimagined and unsung To mend Truth's ravelled tapestry of song! [II She is the sea's star-smitten amethyst;] She is the sea's star-smitten amethyst; She is the light of long, incredible Sunsets; she is the myth and miracle Of love and Love is life's protagonist. She is the soul and tragic heart of youth; She is the dreams and raptures that foretell, In legend, lyric, poem and parable, The spacious and supreme vision of Truth. In life's last desolation and distress She is the touch that sets the Door ajar; She is the peace, she is the passionless Chill wonder of the Night's infinite breath; She is the nameless light, the mystic star In the illimitable skies of Death. [III Thunder, like thunder of the wind-scourged sea,] Thunder, like thunder of the wind-scourged sea, Of shouting multitudes and smitten lyres, The perfumed smoke of sacrificial fires, The palm, the pÃ¦an, and the ecstasy That once confessed thy deep divinity Are gone: the music fails, the rapture tires,â But still heart burns, soul reaches, sense desires For thee, only for thee and all for thee! For thou art She, indubitably She, The dear dream-woman, fatal and unknown, Lilith and Helen and Eurydice; And for thy sake man laughed at God's decree, And brought the haughty towers of Ilium down, And trod the pits of Hell because of thee. [IV Her soul is free from Time's fantastic trance:] Her soul is free from Time's fantastic trance: No infidelity has vexed her eyes Where burns the light of spiritual skies Deep and unshaken by the winds of chance. Her beauty gives a new significance To life, and new desires and dignities, And exaltation of new stars that rise Over the dark ways of deliverance. Love is her captive and her minister; The golden shadow of the wings of love Lies warm and tranquil on her naked breast: She is the World's Desire, the shrine whereof Life is the pilgrim, and in quest of her All men have striven and suffered without rest! [V Her days are like the white processional] Her days are like the white processional Of sacred virgins who, transfused with bliss, Moved round the altars of Hermopolis With equal pace and measured interval. For, like the God of Gods, possessed of all The mighty meaning of the Mysteries, She over-sees the endless theories Of Time from summits clear and spiritual. And I, beside her shrine, with bated breath, Far in her eyes' profound horizons see Ever the pulse, the ebb, the upward roll Of light,âthe day of life, the night of death, Passing beneath the altars whence her soul Watches in undisturbed divinity. [VI Her hair is hued like shadow where light is] Her hair is hued like shadow where light is Tragic and tense and tranquil, and her eyes Burn in their depths the splendour of such skies As sunset kindled over Naukratis. It may be, when the walls and towers of This Stood in magnificence and rang with cries Of myriads in their flashing panoplies, She shone with the ImmortalsâGod! we miss The secret of life's lost divinity! The days, like Sphinxes, one by one repeat Their silent question and devour us! How shall we learn the answer? How shall we Scathless endure the sacred flame that beat And brake the desperate wings of Icarus? [VII I give my whole life for her dwelling-place] I give my whole life for her dwelling-place, And all my days are mansions made for her, And all my heart is like a harp-player Singing with eyes insatiate of her face. And she, for the same love's sake, in the trace Of my dark journey follows everywhere, And from the labour of truth and the despair She can console me in her deep embrace. For Love has made her body of his delight And of his sacred frenzy, and his light Is calm and ardent in her perfect eyes; And Love has shared his faith and liberty Between us, who are blent inseparably In the communion of his mysteries. [VIII She moulded life, with hands subtle and wise,] She moulded life, with hands subtle and wise, Into the faultless fashion of a vase Carved as of emerald or chrysoprase, And bossed with mythic shapes of Paradise. And brimmed it was with fire of sunset skies, And deep sea-amethyst, and crystalline, Calm starlight, all distilled into a wine Clear and perturbed with splendour like her eyes. And, as we slaked the thirst that gave no rest By day or night, with solemn ecstasy We knew such vineyards of the soul were pressed To yield this very heart's-blood of our love, That from our hands the cup, once drained thereof, Must fall and shatter irretrievably. [IX That day of the innumerable days] That day of the innumerable days Was like a gate set open secretly, Where the swift sense of immortality Drave us from Time's interminable ways. Clear as a song's inviolable phrase, Tender as sunset on a windless sea, Our sudden hearts yielded ineffably, Our eyes drank deep of Truth's eternal rays. We saw how blind and aimless on and on Time journeys, while the ripened harvests stand Of Truth and Liberty on either hand; And so we reaped and made the sacred bread And poured the wine of Love's communion: And there that day the starving soul was fed. [X In the shadow and glamour of the ways] In the shadow and glamour of the ways, With a passion more mighty than we were, With the strength of desire, we followed where We found Love's light that leads and never stays. And yet not thus, alone for what repays The passion that is life for best and worst, The desire that is hunger, that is thirst, We wrought Love's labour of all our nights and days. Nay, not alone the great hilarity Of Love's brimmed cup and Life's high festival Gave us good warrant of the quest: thereof Were we resolved, because, for one and all Of Love's true partisans, we seemed to see The Truth alive in the deep heart of Love! [XI My lips were bruised against her lips, my eyes] My lips were bruised against her lips, my eyes Drowned in her eyes as in a star-lit sea; My life sang brokenly to her, and she Trembled with inarticulate replies. I felt the rapture that in Paradise Woke in their hearts, who, heedless of the cost, Yielded to love; like waters tempest-tossed, I felt her breast beneath me fall and rise. And when at last our hands and eyes and lips Severed, still, deep in life's undying heart, We felt the birth of poems, the springs of song; And saw, by winds of music borne along, Our souls go forth on love's high seas, like ships Making Truth's voyage without helm or chart. [XII Her breast is perfumed and profound as sleep] Her breast is perfumed and profound as sleep; Her fervent, mythic face is clear and fair And pale as light; thro' all her sombre hair The tragic splendours of the sunset creep. And now for me her soul and senses keep Incessant vigil, and because we share The journey she will neither ask nor care Whether the ways of love be smooth or steep. Her eyes that watch for mine are starred and strange As tho' there lightened on her inward sight New vistas of the soul's unfettered range; As tho' she saw, across the passive night, On far horizons of the seas of change, By Love's decree made manifest, the Light! [XIII We shared the silent faith and truth of things] We shared the silent faith and truth of things! Her life seemed all in all to sing to me, And mine replied in clear antiphony, Wild as the music of wind-smitten strings. Hers was the mood of one who subtly sings In low, long sunsets by a windless sea; Far in her languid eyes I seemed to see The flash of unimagined lightenings. And when against her breast I felt the core Of life grow eager, while within her kiss Trembled the broken rhythm of her blood, I cried, âO slay thy worshippers, O God Of Love! for life must be forevermore After this joy a lesser joy than this!â [XIV My lips shut hard against her lyric throat] My lips shut hard against her lyric throat; Her hands were tense, her pulses tremulous: Life burned and languished while I held her thus; The feet of Time grew soundless and remote. Glitters of Truth's consummate splendour smote Our eyes with fire, and music, over us, Like spheres of crystal clear and marvellous, Fell thro' the faultless silence note by note. When life and time drave us once more apart, Life seemed a hollow shell of irised pearl Filled with the song-pulse of her gorgeous heart; And Time an eyeless ghost who, thro' the night Where stars burn and dawn lifts and lightnings whirl, Strove to constrain me from the paths of light. [XV She stood in the weird moonlight of a dream] She stood in the weird moonlight of a dream, And in the light there was incredible Silence, and on her lips no syllable Of any speech, and in her eyes no gleam. And by her still white feet the narrow stream Paused in its flood, forgetful of the sea, In shining silence, and it seemed to me That silence quelled the stars and reigned supreme! And terribly I felt there was no stir But only silence in the heart of her, And silence in her soul!âThen was I hurled Back into life, and woke, and knew that she, In moonlit silence, somewhere in the world Waited alone and motionless for me. [XVI Her eyes are spacious as the starlight is] Her eyes are spacious as the starlight is; Her brows are clear and pale as porphyry; Her breasts are hueless as young ivory, Save where they crimson, wounded by a kiss. Her beauty wears the mood of Nemesis; She is aloof from Time and Memory; Her hands were shaped for love, and utterly Her lip's deep curve was carved and stained for this. I will alone, in silence, go to her And feel beneath my kiss her pulses stir, And in her hair the perfume of Love's breath; And she will understand and bear with me The joy of life, the pain, the mystery; The thought, the fear, the loneliness of death. [XVII We strayed in Time's dream-haunted night] We strayed in Time's dream-haunted night And watched the voiceless stars of thought That thro' the warp of darkness wrought Their frail and faithful threads of light. But when life's passion blurred our sight, We cried, âIt dawns! Desire has brought That guide our souls have vainly sought For life, the way-worn eremite!â Yet from the dazzled eyes of youth The fire, subdued to sunset, cleared At last, and we were left with truth: For there, above the sunset's bars, Still changeless and on high, appeared The boundless night, the steadfast stars. [XVIII We loved the moon in strange sweet ways] We loved the moon in strange sweet ways, The moon that loved Endymion; We loved the stars that one by one Swelled thro' the sunset's golden haze. We loved the skies of chrysoprase, Pale violet and vermillion,â The skies that soon must yield the sun; We loved our proud, impassioned days. We knew the gain of love is love, We knew mere life is happiness, We knew nor grief nor death can prove That love is lost or life is less:â We guessed the vaster scope thereof, Closed in the cosmic consciousness. [XIX She said: âHeart breaksâyet, strangely, into song] She said: âHeart breaksâyet, strangely, into song! Then, when I leave thee, is there nothing lost? God knows, in your account and mine, the cost, Tho' all of life must pay and life be long, Is not too much! yet day by day the strong Monotony may blunt the edge of pain And leave us joyless, till we wake again To find our lives have done the Truth much wrong. Nay! for the present and ineffable flame That kindles at the core of life, shall last Beyond remembrance! Time shall never tame The Truth, but like a pillared watch-fire It still shall cheer our pilgrimage and cast New light to guide the quest of soul's desire!â [XX When she returns to me, when there is sound] When she returns to me, when there is sound And motion of her, and perfume of her, And light and laughter of her eyes that were The stars whither my homeless life was bound,â When she returns and all my days resound With Love's clear voice, who is her chorister, And all my heart is shaken with the stir Of Love's wide wings, and all my life is crowned With her and her delight and her desire, And all the night long, strong and swift as fire, Her deep caress responds to my embrace,â When she returns what shall I offer thee, Upon thine altars in thy dwelling-place, O God of Love, when she returns to me? [XXI What save her memory has Time left to me] What save her memory has Time left to me? The memory of the twilight of her hair, The memory of her breast, profound and bare, And of her mouth the dazzled memory! For Memory, in the paradise that we Seemed in Love's morning of the world to share, Wanders alone, and, thro' the stagnant air, Shows her small light in the obscurity. And Memory too shall perish, as the stream Of time flows ceaseless and resistless on! Yet, when again Love makes our twain souls one, May we not glimpse, thro' life's dissolving dream, Rays of imperishable light that seem Dawn in the dark depths of oblivion. [XXII Remembrance is a desolate loneliness] Remembrance is a desolate loneliness: Alone we watch the light of life's lost days Fade, strange and spectral, in the soundless ways Of immemorial time, forever less. The lustre of her living loveliness, Soft as a song's most tense and tender phrase, Seems like a windless sunset's golden haze, Arched by the nightfall of forgetfulness. Gone is the perfume of her naked breast, Gone are her hands' caress, her lips' desire: And in the House where once the feast was spread, The chambers garnished for a nobler guest, Amid the scattered ashes of Love's fire, Pale Memory crouches, weeping o'er the dead. [XXIII I know in some far, fabled place] I know in some far, fabled place, Some land of old, immortal things, The thrilled remembrance of our springs Returns with spring to vex her peace. Hearkening with pale impassioned face As Life's faint fingers sweep the strings, She hears an inward voice that sings The Love too strong for Time and Space. She knows, how much soever the loss Of days unshared is loss indeed, Yet stars shine up the endless sky, That bear, from heart to heart across, Still the foreverlasting need, The love too greatly lived to die! [XXIV I thought she came in hushed and secret wise] I thought she came in hushed and secret wise And stood in silence close beside me here, Mantled in some gold-glimmering atmosphere, Deep as the light of sunset-splendid skies. Then, with her breast's smooth curve, her lucent eyes, Haunted with visions of the lonely soul, Her high white face, she seemed the mythic goal Of some fantastic, fabled enterprise. Then, till my thirst was quenched, my hunger fed, I seemed, with hands that clung and lips that kissed, To hold and to possess her utterly; While all her passion and beauty were to me The lustral wine, the sacramental bread Laid on Love's altar for Life's eucharist! [XXV Vainly the days return, in vain by night] Vainly the days return, in vain by night,â Since thou art gone!âthe stars stand choir-wise; Gaunt as a moonlit road the future lies,â Since thou hast left me!âto the verge of sight. Since thou art gone there is no more delight Of life, since thou hast left me! and the skies Of love are dark, since now between our eyes Kindles no more the imperishable light. Thus are the Gods revenged for what we won Of the celestial fire! The forward way, Our way, as must be, goes superbly on, Heedless of our disaster. Night and day Flash up the abyss where one eternal ray Falls from one steadfast starâperchance a sun! [XXVI She said: âI know the miracle is this] She said: âI know the miracle is this, This pause and foretaste of eternity: Time was for us and time returns; but we To-day guess something, for life's chrysalis, In one transcendent metamorphosis, Shatters, and wings flash sky-ward, and we see Suddenlyâstars!âand now no less can be Declared of life than what the secret is! Yet time returns, and death perchance is long And time eternal,âbut the stars that throng Our skies of silence live beyond control Of death and time, for, guessing at the goal Of truth, we rise, thro' ringing spheres of song, And find them glittering steadfast in the soul!â III DEATH TRUMBULL STICKNEY OCTOBER 11TH MCMIV ??? ??? ????? ???????? ?????? ?????????????. ???? ??? ?? ?????? ??????? ?? ?????? ?????????? ????? ??????? ???????? ??? ??? ???? ????????, ? ?, ??? ??? ?????? ??? ??? ?????, ?? ????? ??? ???????? ????????. ???????? ??????. [I The House of Life has many mansions, where] The House of Life has many mansions, where, Like men dream-haunted in unquiet sleep, We seek and strive and suffer, laugh and weep, And fear the Truth, and mask the soul's despair. And much in festival, and much in prayer And sorrow and hysteric thanks-givings, And more in labour for little and low things Our life's brief interval is wasted there. And only when magnificently some one Of all the dreaming myriads, patiently Shapes the great key and slants the secret door,â As he departs we feel the blinding sun, The pealing song, and know his soul is free, Bound in the dream of life and death no more. [II âHe sought, believed, dared, found and bore away] âHe sought, believed, dared, found and bore away The light. The deed, the deathless deed was done! What mattered it that then Deukalion Was filled with wrath, resentment and dismay? What tho' God's bird, relentless, day by day Tore his immortal heart, and God's high sun Blistered his eyes?âthe man endured and won!â He saidâand smiled in his tremendous way. And then I knew how fiercely and alone The Titan had withstood resistless things And let the soul's accomplishment atone! Had climbed blind pathways thro' the strangling night, And, with the courage of his sufferings, Had seized and kept, for life and death, the Light! [III âNothing is spared,â he said, ânothing is lost] âNothing is spared,â he said, ânothing is lost! Life, from the House of Death, returns again; There is salvation of the parcelled grain, And certain harvest where the seed is tossed. Life never dies, and life the Truth has cost, And love and lonely labours of the brain! Therefore the light of Truth shall most remain After the night-fall and the night are crossed!â And thus he stared with high expectancy Into the terrible, blind vacancy, Until, across the stricken field of Death, His eyes seemed darkly to discern a goal,â And we beheld the daybreak's boundless breath Glimmer against the windows of his soul. [IV âThat we, however least, however less] âThat we, however least, however less Than Time's recorded heroes who have bled And burned and lived and died for Truth,â he said, âMay still, in proof of all our lives profess, Join with their great companionship, to press In ways where none who are not free may tread,â We must endure to die! and, being dead, To live in death's transcendent loneliness!â And thus thereafter we beheld him live, Rapt in the faith of those who most believe, Who most are curious and unsatisfied; Till, to the summits and the silences, Where all the Mighty stand with Socrates, We saw him rise transfigured as he died! [V He felt the blind, lost loneliness increase] He felt the blind, lost loneliness increase As life compelled him to the final test. He said: âThe refuge of defeat is rest; A soul's dishonour is the price of peace! From star to star the flight shall never cease; The Truth, perforce, is long and last and best: Thro' life and death, with bruised, defenceless breast, We seek the sunrise of the soul's release!â And so he lived and almost died and died: The night, the silence and the solitude Left him magnificent and unsubdued;â And we, who kept the vigil by his side, Saw, when at last the door was opened wide, Flash in his eyes the Dawn his soul pursued. [VI He said: âWhat death leaves derelict is dead] He said: âWhat death leaves derelict is dead: Thus may we circumscribe mortality! Yet in the last release, when all is free To the free soul, who shall escape?â he said, âHaste, lest we sleep, lest we be comforted, Lest we forget! for we must learn to be Visionaries of Truth's eternity, Star-gazers constant and unsatiated.â Thus we beheld him, steadfast and sublime, Passing alone in eminent, strange ways Of great adventure thro' the massive night; Until at last, after prodigious days, Outcast over the precipice of Time, His eyes, triumphant, cried: âThe Light! The Light!â [VII âWe serve no God, nor in the retinue] âWe serve no God, nor in the retinue Of creed or faction are we crowned and fed! Therefore no less than our belief,â he said, âNo less than all that we were faithful to, No less than capital and revenue Of all we won of Truth's inheritance, No less than our achieved significance, No less than all! in justice is our due!â And then, before he left us, day by day, And when his dumb, deserted body lay Folded in death's impenetrable cloak, By many a sign and proof no tongue can tell, We knew the Justice that he dared invoke Was swift and sure and indefectible! [VIII I well remember how one yesterday] I well remember how one yesterday Of all our lives' intense communion, He said, âIn Death's austere dominion Only the coin of Truth's device can pay The price of liberty!âWhat alien way Might chance direct us, when oblivion Sets us adrift from all we were and won? Or take us from ourselves whither away? Therefore must we, for our deliverance, Levy on life the toll of truth!â he cried. And so he lived indeedâbut when he died, Beyond all proof I seemed to understand That he, from Death's outstretched and friendly hand, Received his ransom and recognizance. [IX âAt least,â he said, âwe spent with Socrates] âAt least,â he said, âwe spent with Socrates Some memorable days, and in our youth Were curious and respectful of the Truth, Thrilled with perfections and discoveries. And with the everlasting mysteries We were irreverent and unsatisfied,â And so we are!â he said. And when he died His eyes were deep with strange immensities. And all his words came back to me again Like stars after a storm. I saw the light And trembled, for I knew the man had won In solitude and darkness and great pain;â But when he leaped headlong into the Night, He met the dawn of an eternal Sun! [X He said: âWe are the Great Adventurers,] He said: âWe are the Great Adventurers, This is the Great Adventure: thus to be Alive and, on the universal sea Of being, lone yet dauntless mariners. In the rapt outlook of astronomers To rise thro' constellated gyres of thought; To fall with shattered pinions, overwrought With flight, like unrecorded Lucifers:â Thus to receive identity, and thus Return at last to the dark element,â This is the Great Adventure!â All of us, Who saw his dead, deep-visioned eyes, could see, After the Great Adventure, immanent, Splendid and strange, the Great Discovery! [XI Above his heart the rose is red] Above his heart the rose is red, The rose above his head is white, The crocus glows with golden light, The Spring returnsâand he is dead! We hark in vain to hear his tread, We reach to clasp his hand in vain; Tho' life and love return again We can no more be comforted. With tearless eyes we kept steadfast His vigil we were sworn to keep: But, when he left us, and at last We saw him pass beyond the Door, And knew he could return no more, We wept aloud as children weep. [XII We knew he lived alone with loneliness] We knew he lived alone with loneliness Day after day. We did what men could do: Men could do nothing,âor, at most, a few Moments persuade him to forgetfulness. We often smiledâperhaps in sheer excess, Perhaps because we found him smiling too. We never wept, and he divinely knew The love that gave us strength, nevertheless. In solitude as tho' in dungeon walls His soul was held sequestered and confined. We always wondered how it was he bore The tense intolerable intervals Wherein he waited, steadfast, breathless, blind, To hear the hand of Death unlock the door. [XIII In silence, solitude and stern surmise] In silence, solitude and stern surmise His faith was tried and proved commensurate With life and death. The stone-blind eyes of Fate Perpetually stared into his eyes, Yet to the hazard of the enterprise He brought his soul, expectant and elate, And challenged, like a champion at the Gate, Death's undissuadable austerities. And thus, full-armed in all that Truth reprieves From dissolution, he beheld the breath Of daybreak flush his thought's exalted ways, While, like Dodona's sad, prophetic leaves, Round him the scant, supreme, momentous days Trembled and murmured in the wind of Death. [XIV At last the light leaped in his patient eyes] At last the light leaped in his patient eyes! And he, transfigured by the breathless sense Of an eventual magnificence, At last forbore life's small felicities. Then, as beneath Death's starred and silent skies His life's large sunset lingered, calm and tense, His faith revealed, in days of dark suspense, Proof of the soul's immortal destinies. Yet, when at last the heights he dared to climb Sphered him in solitudes no tongue can tell, Then, tho' we knew not all our love could share With him the last adventure, as he fell We leaned over the parapets of Time And saw strange splendours in the abysmal air! [XV With life and lips he said tremendous things] With life and lips he said tremendous things! Yet, when he died, I most recalled the smile Which day by day he gave us to beguile The crude disaster of our sufferings. He knew what we believed or half-believed: How from the Lakes of Hell the fabled springs Rise to his lips who most divinely sings, Who, tried in truth, has most superbly lived. Therefore his calm lips smiled because he stood, And we beheld him stand, in loneliness, Lost in the shadow of Eternity; Therefore at last his eyes revealed the mood, Thro' mortal passion and sublime distress, Of one reborn into divinity! [XVI Times were when, reeling on his eminence] Times were when, reeling on his eminence, He seemed to doubt the event:âif, after all, His strength could well endure what must befall And hold his breath in anguish and suspense. And we, who watched with every fibre tense, There, so to speak, within his sight and call, At every such momentous interval, Measured the man's surpassing excellence. And when, crouched silent by the silent gate, We saw him pass within, alone with Fate, We seemed to hear, as thro' the closing door, The shouting of star-choirs, and to see The sunrise flash against his brows that wore The glory and the gold of victory! [XVII I saw that day in his dead eyes] I saw that day in his dead eyes The light that suffers no eclipse, I felt the chill on his dead lips Of shoreless seas and starlit skies. I knew he lives indeed who dies A champion in the lists of Truth, I knew the days of all his youth Were tournaments and victories! And yet once more heart-brokenly I kissed his lips and clasped his hand And suffered darkly, humanly; Till, there beside his corpse and me, I almost seemed to see him stand, Deadâand alive, triumphant, free! [XVIII There moved a Presence always by his side] There moved a Presence always by his side, With eyes of pleasure and passion and wild tears, And on her lips the murmur of many years, And in her hair the chaplets of a bride; And with him, hour by hour, came one beside, Scatheless of Time and Time's vicissitude, Whose lips, perforce of endless solitude, Were silent and whose eyes were blind and wide. But when he died came One who wore a wreath Of star-light, and with fingers calm and bland Smoothed from his brows the trace of mortal pain; And of the two who stood on either hand, âThis one is Life,â he said, âand this is Death, And I am Love and Lord over these twain!â [XIX Because for some tremendous cause he chose] Because for some tremendous cause he chose To meet his life's supreme catastrophe In silence, and with grave serenity To bear alone the last, remorseless woes, We turned the tide of dreadful tears that rose High on the shores of Life, resolved to be True to his tragic, tense tranquillity; And day by day we often smiledâGod knows! But, when at last he died and we were left Utterly, irretrievably bereft, Blear-eyed with vigil by the Great Abyss, We found no tears because the man was dead,â But there beside his corpse!âGod knowsâinstead We shared with him unutterable bliss! [XX All thro' the night most strange it was to see] All thro' the night most strange it was to see, Vigilant of him as he lay there, dead, The eyes of Love singing beside his bed, Clear as the dawn-stars singing over-sea. At last Love turned his eyes to mine, and said, âLove is the Lord of Life, and I am he! Walk in my ways and thy despair shall be A dungeon whence the captive soul has fled!â Then I beheld how all unscathed he passed, With high, calm face and eyes unterrified, The destined Door of all that perisheth; So, as I caught his hand and held it fast, âWhither thou goest I will go!â I cried, âO Lord of Life, O Lord of Life and Death!â [XXI The stately silence, the perpetual peace] The stately silence, the perpetual peace Of death's inscrutable, divine event Lay on his body like a sacrament, In calm assurance of the soul's release. Gone forth on the great ways that never cease With all the Mighty and Magnificent Whose souls like his were strangers to content, We knew he voyaged for Truth's Golden Fleece. And we, who, day by day and hand in hand, Had fared with him in close community Of high endeavour to the treacherous sand Edging Life's continent, we turned our eyes Seaward, and there, far forth, we seemed to see, Full-sailed and outward-bound, his Argosies! [XXII We said no word of all men use to say] We said no word of all men use to say, But, when the childish jargon of the priest And all the stale formalities had ceased, We laid him in the earth and went away. Mysteriously thereafter all that day We felt, like adepts at a sacred feast, Rapt in austere rejoicing, and released From all dark bounds of life's dim-vistaed way. And all that night about me in the gloom I felt great consummations and the stir Of high events, and in the dawn's first breath I saw a presence by the empty tomb, Who said, âI am the Great Deliverer! I am the Life!ââI looked, and it was Death! [XXIII We bore the chill, persistent dread] We bore the chill, persistent dread Here in the long, tree-shaded way; And here the things we could not say Were more, I know, than man has said. These are the paths that felt his tread, This is the bench where sunset lay So large and tranquil day by day,â And I return, and he is dead! And I must bear to feel the breath Of desolation thrill and swell My broken heart's discordant strings! While he, who bore life's utmost things,â In the immensity of Death, With him it is not less than well! XXIV DAYS Still on his grave, relentless, one by one, They fall as fell the mystic, Sibylline, Sad leaves, and still the Meaning's secret sign Dies undeciphered with each dying sun. How shall the burning heart of Truth be won? Whence shall the light of revelation shine? When shall the mind's discernment grow divine? Where shall the soul's immortal deeds be done? What were the incommunicable things Whereof his dying eyes were undismayed? What were the words that stirred his strangling breath? Sharply the Night's impenetrable wings Covered his eyes, and on his lips was laid The inveterate taciturnity of Death! [XXV O Memory, Lord of broken and broadcast] O Memory, Lord of broken and broadcast Fragments of life, like scattered Cyclades Set in the dark, illimitable seas Of Time, still twilight-silvered and steadfast:â Wayfarer in the devastated past, Ghoul of the great necropolis of Time, Where Life and Death and all things, in the lime Of long oblivion, are consumed at last:â Salvage the shattered drift, the tempest-tossed Derelicts of his shipwrecked life's dead days! Treasure of his loved voice an echoed phrase! And set, O Memory, in thy stagnant skies The Dawn reflected in his dying eyes, Herald of victory when all was lost! [XXVI It is not that we loved him, as in sooth] It is not that we loved him, as in sooth Beyond all words we loved and love him still; It is not that he seemed so to fulfil Ineffably the very spirit of Truth; It is not, day by day, in the uncouth Brutality of death, his calm control, Courage and tenderness of heart and soul; It is not pity even of his mere youth;â God knows these were alone sufficient cause! Yet it is not for all these things that we Now keep sure faith with things transcendent, true And untransmissible:âit is because, Even in the presence of the Mystery, He knew!âit is because we knew he knew! THE SOUL'S INHERITANCE AND OTHER POEMS THE SOUL'S INHERITANCE Poem delivered before the Phi Beta Kappa Society, Cambridge, 1906 I 1 Magnificent presence of the living Truthâ We know not when thy swift, serene, strong flame Shall violate our sanctuaries of sleep! We know not when, from carnal lethargies And trivial pastimes and derisive dreams Of ineffectual felicities, Irresolutions and timidities And temperate ambitions, we shall wake To find our safe exclusions overborne, The pale of our defence invaded, all Our precincts of secure retreat destroyed; To feel the dark enchantments yield; to hear Thy trumpets blowing in our citadels, The shouting of thy liege-men on the hillsides, And in our ears thy far and forward call; To lift at last unconquerable eyes Suddenly to the challenge of the sunrise, And feel thereafter always by thy light Delivered from the mean distrust of death, The tyranny of time, the brief content Of all achievement and prosperity Less than perfection, and at last resolved To illustrate in thought and word and deed, In life and death, the utmost that we are!â We know not when or where or in what wise Thou shalt appear, imperishable Truth, Spirit of Liberty!âbut well we know That life and death are only thine adventure. And well we know the time of revelation Is always nowâeternity is now! The place of miracles is always hereâ Infinity is here! Then here and now, And in thy name, O latent Truth within us, In thought and word and deed, in life and death, Let us report and celebrate the soul! 2 Let us report and celebrate the soul, In thought and word and deed, in life and death! Then may we feel, perchance, the God within us, Whose worship waits and who has slept so long, Revive at last, athletic and superb, Stand forth from custom, creed and circumstance, Reclaim his high, inherent liberties, And stem the rush of the resistless hours,â Till, for a spacious interval, we see The veils of darkness and deception fall And leave us, eager of our enterprise, Transparent to our own reality, Against the thrilled, tremendous heart of time! ... Then shall it come to passâas we report The soul and celebrate the soul in life And deathâthat hardly and mysteriously The stubborn prison-walls of ignorance Shall yield beneath our blind, insistent hands, And, bruised with misadventures in the dark, We shall achieve the soul's advance, and stand Bathed in the light remedial, and behold The broad, released, bright waters of the soul, Sun-dazzled and resistless, rush away Forever and forever to the sea! ... 3 O to report, to celebrate the soul! O to proclaim ourselves and all we are, In thought and word and deed, in life and death! O to depart, avid of explorations, Winged and resolved, curious, in time and spaceâ There to retrieve the soul's inheritance, There to report and celebrate the soul! O to confess at last who is the Lord!â To find at last, beyond to-day, in all The innumerable yesterdays of time, The onward, latent, long millenniums, A rumour of us and a recollection!â To learn at last that always for the soul, In the dark earth and the deep sea, throughout Chill ethers and the pale star multitudes, The path leads homeward and the place is home!â To know at last that never and nowhere The soul is stranger, never and nowhere Without recognizance and habitation!â To learn, to know, to realize utterly That time and space are phases of the soul! ... O let us perfectly report the soul And celebrate the soul, until at last No time, no space, no state is vacant of us!â Until at last the sense revives within us Of indissoluble identity With sun and earth and beast, with man and God!â Until at last, from granite, schist and shard, From senseless jellies and brute envelopes, We mark our stages of deliverance, The age-long, upward levels of our flight,â And feel the restless, resolute, firm soul, Conscious and lord of life after so long, Still by the insatiable impulse driven, Transgress the forms and infidelities, The calculations and economies, That prove our insufficiency!âuntil At last we share the ancient and divine Companionship of peril and perfection With all who once bore witness to the truth, And were compounded of the celestial fire!â Then shall we stand, central and self-assured, To labour in the austere fraternity Of Gods and Saviours, till our lives record, As theirs,âour deaths, as theirs, declare the soul! Then may we learn at last that here and now The very light is parcelled in our vision, Wherewith Father Prometheus disclosed The kindled soul's transcendent regency; That here and now, in free communion, We break the bread of life and speak the word Of life, as when the veiled respondents sang Clear, at Eleusis, in the sacred gloom; That here and now, no less for each of us, That inward voice, cogent as revelation, That trance of truth's sublime discovery, Which in the soul of Socrates wrought out Gold from the gross ore of humanity, Still speak, still hold, still work their alchemy; That here and now, and in the soul's advance, And by the soul's perfection, we may feel The thought of Buddha in our mortal brain, The human heart of Jesus in our breast, And in our will the strength of Herakles! ... 4 O to report, to celebrate the soul, Equal at last and forward with the Captains, On the long frontiers where the twilight dies!â There with uplifted voices that shall sound, Sound and resound amid the loud and long Vociferations of the embattled souls, There to report the soulâin the broad dusk Of hesitation, in the immeasurable UnknownâO there to celebrate the soul! There to resume the retrospect, to find, Up the bright courses of the stairs of thought, The traces of our perilous ambition! There to endure the prospect, and, at last, In the proud might of the soul's will, to bear The peril as of intense emergencies, The storm and strength as of gigantic wings, The glare as of deep-driven lightnings,âall The multitudinous menace of the night! Importunate and undissuadable, There, for the sole sake of the endless voyage, There to stand out over the utmost verge, Where the mist drives and the night overwhelms! ... There in our skies the stars of revelation; There in our hearts the burning lamp of love; There in our sense the rhythm and amplitude And startled splendour of the seas of song;â And there at lastâour own infinity, Our own eternity still unappeased!â There, for ourselves, for freedom, truth, perfection, There to report and celebrate the soul! ... II Strangely, inviolably aloof, alone, Once shall it hardly come to pass that we, As with his Cross, as up his Calvary, Burdened and blind, ascend and share his throne And perfectly, as with our lives, atone For the heart's triumph, for the soul's victory!â Yet may we seem thereafter, dead as he, To lie within life's sepulchre of stone ... But he is risen, the Lord is risen!âand thus, Thus may he rise, the Lord may rise in us, Who sleeps, who is not dead, who lives alway! And all who come love-kindled to the tomb, Shall find, as Mary found, an empty room, And meet the Lord, alive and on his way! ... III âI am the Way, the Life, the Truth!â he said.â Deep in the soul of every man alway There is a voice that says, âI am the Way; I am the Life, the Truth, the Living Bread!â And whoso hearkens he is comforted: Well he discerns the Paraclete is there, The Soul of Truth, the Christ, the Comforter, Who, tho' the mortal dies, is never dead. He is within us all, whom we have sought: The Way, the Life, the Truth, the Paraclete, The soul, who ranges with resplendent feet, Silent and swift, from peak to peak of thought; He is the Lord for whom the task is wrought; He is the Lover whom we haste to meet! ... IV âAsk what you will, it shall not be denied; Knock, and the secret door shall stand ajar; Seek, and however much the way is far, Yet shall the Bridegroom find, who seeks the Bride!ââ He knows how much the truth is justified, Who is not unambitious as we are; He finds, beyond the star we seek, a star, Beyond our dreams, a soul unsatisfied. He knows, and That within us more than we Shall learn, how much we leave the best undone; How little there is end or rest or peace; And how the Asker and the Alms are one; How whoso knocks brings welcome and release; And how the search is the discovery! ... PILGRIMS Poem delivered at the annual dinner of the New England Society, New York, December, 1906 I 1 Pilgrims!âThe choir of their adventured days Sounds to the living, inward ear, and tho' Their eyes are quenched, their lips are dumb with dust, Yet, in imperishable communion, Clear thro' the soundless retrospect of time, Well may our spirits now to theirs respond. For we who, in their stead, bear up the fire, Bear on the torch of life's inherent faith And inconsiderate will, may well discern, Illustrious in their lives, the Pilgrim Soul Of Man on its eternal pilgrimage. ... Yes, for their deeds bear witness! Yes, for they, Lit by some spark of the Promethean fire, Publish their own recognizance,âafford Proof of the Lord's dominion in his house,â And by the old, the indefectible signs Show how they earned their stern and splendid name! O hearts of perished men, how shall we learn Your secret, save as all your acts record What angers vexed you and what loves fulfilled? And well we know of these most arduous men, At least, that here, across the bitter sea, They rashly ventured into peril and exile Not for renown or power or merchandise,â Not for the world's remembrance or reward! Rather they went abroad with the new Gods Of their deliverance, for in new, clear wise Their hearts received the old, austere, divine, Tremendous guidance of the Cloud and Flame Which lead the spirit out of bondage, move Thro' waste and sea to bring the Pilgrim home. Theirs was no profitable enterprise Of traffic or of conquering caravels; Rather their ships were ventured as the soul Of man goes forth on life's storm-shadowed sea, To find that better place where dreams come true Of God's fresh purpose in the heart, and where Liberty prospers in the wilderness! ... 2 O let us now return in thought and love To these rebellious men!âthat here and now Their stern remembrance in the House of Life May rouse at last the Lord of Life from sleep: Lest we grow tired and tame and temperate; Lest we grow stable, settled and secure; Lest we no longer hear the voice, discern The light that made them Pilgrims; lest our minds Scant the truth's welcome; lest our hearts forego The labour and liberality of love; Lest we forget that still the Pilgrimage Fills the long prospect of the Pilgrim Soul! We are the Pilgrims!âShall we less deserve, Than they deserved, that stern and splendid name? Or, less than they, afford the rightful Heir His incommensurable heritage? Rather, as now the light of truth expands In statelier vistas to the inward eye;â Rather, as now, with more perfected faith And more religious ecstasy, we learn That life and destiny and death and time And God and all the long captivities, Creeds and enslavements of the mind of man, Which tamed the heart and set, on every hand, Brief bounds to life's insatiable hope, Are but the myths and symbols of the spirit, Garments outworn and mansions long outgrown;â Therefore, as truth is merciless and just And perfect as each one of us must be, Inexorably and with deliberate feet Let us of these and all dead dreams and things Tread down the dust into the common way, That man may liberally advance!âfor thus May we with haughtier strength and hardihood Send forth the vagrant and victorious soul From dreams and desolate insanities And gross deceptions of the solid world, Into the shining night, on to the Road! ... Well may we know it lies before us still, Who are the Pilgrims, as it stretched for them Whose pilgrimage is done!âthe self-same road, Hazardous, hard, unknown, which leads afar, Thro' lusts and lies, thro' laws and governments, Thro' settled customs and established creeds,â Thro' all substantial things and sensible forms. And well for us if we may find it out, And walk thereon our spiritual way Forward to real achievements and progressions,â Pilgrims, as once they were, in high resolve Launched on the Pilgrimage that once was theirs! ... II They are gone. ... They have all left us, one by one: Swiftly, with undissuadable strong tread, Cuirassed in song, with wisdom helmeted, They are gone before us, into the dark, alone ... Upward their wings rush radiant to the sun; Sea-ward the ships of their emprise are sped; Onward their star-light of desire is shed; Their trumpet-call is forward;âthey are gone! Let us take thought and go!âwe know not why Nor whence nor whereâlet us take wings and fly! Let us take ship and sail, take heart and dare! Let us deserve at last, as they have done, To say of all men living and dead who share The soul's supreme adventure,âWe are gone! ... III Let us go hence!âhowever dark the way, Let us at all adventure hasten hence! Too well we know what secret excellence, Real and unrealized, brooks no more delay Of who would make love perfect, and display In life the spirit's true magnificence ... Haste!âlest we lose the clear, ambitious sense Of what is ours to gain and to gainsay. Let us go hence, lest dreadfully we dieâ Die at the core of life where love is great, Where thought is grave, audacious and serene ... Thither and hence all vast achievements lie, There where the truth's transcendent virtues wait Up the dark distance, radiant tho' unseen! ... IV O great departures from the thrift and care Of a less love, of a less truth than we Can hardly, in the last extremity Of all our powers, believe that we may share!â Nobler prosperities, that wait us where We goâif we have strength and will to be Mariners of whatever wreck-strewn sea, Waifs on whatever ways shall take us there!â O great departures!âO prosperities!â Ventures and consummations!âyou are hence: Hence from the safe denials and pieties Which life is eased and ruined and pleasured of!â For the strong heart conceives no bounds of love, The soul no measure of magnificence! ... LIFE IN LOVE I 1 Clear and profound and dark as well-water, Grave eyes transfused with gold, you were not blind;â You were not numb, brave breathless heart of joys, Proud heart of mercies and mysterious tears,â You were not faithless, when the shrine lay bare And there was splendour in the sanctuary, As momently between us, from afar, White thro' the mist, rose-hued as with the young Life-blood of love's desire, soul signed to soul! ... You were not blind, wild eyes whose glance disclosed Love's power and purpose which no tongue can tell; Loosed and abandoned heart, which, swift as fire, Seized the soul's heritage, you were not numb, When first we saw the spirit and the source Of life's pure essence, like a light revealed Within us, radiant and alone;âwhen first We knew the whole and best of love remained, Sphered in the new transcendency of life Beyond us, like a still unravished bride;â When first we felt, in one another's arms,â Strange and extreme to us, almost as death,â The tragic sense of solitude;âwhen first We were with love togetherâyet alone! Grave eyes, brave heart, in vain, it seemed in vain We saw, we dared, we were not faithless then, We were not weak.âYea, love itself seemed vain That one first day of wonder and no words! For, hour by hour and all the new day long, And hour by hour and all the thrilled night thro', And while your hands clung and your lips assured, And while my life-blood thundered on your breast, We were aloneâtogether, yet alone! ... 2 So was it shown to us as in a vision, That day;âand once again, that sleepless night, As in a trance we seemed to go afar From love's inveterate violence of being, From life's incessant uproar, and, alone, Pause in the thrilled tranquillities of thought. ... There, with the pulse still rhythmic in our hearts Of love's wild music, and the flush still warm About us, of the senses' leaping flame, We heard the more ineffable songâas yet Wordless and distant to the inward carâ; We saw the lordlier lightâas yet pearl-hued Thro' the fresh twilights which precede the dawnâ; We felt the loftier hope, the larger whole, The lovelier rapture of that deeper sense Of life, which of the spirit's utmost strength Alone,âwith vast completions and austere Beginnings and perceptions clear and new, Valid and delicate as truth must beâ Conceived in secret, is matured and born. And thenâand all at firstâand in the new Anguish of solitudeâand from the far, Still, spiritual mansionâours at last!â, The life we long had lived and shared appeared Vague and fantastic thro' the friendless dark,â As something somewhere for a little while On the immense horizons, like a dream On the remote and restless marge of sleep,â Like the dull rumour and the distant flare, To one who dwells by a deserted sea, Of some tumultuous city on the verge. ... Yes! ... we discerned, in the full, first, strange hour, How much our lives had been a blinded sense Of twilight, brief and brave and treacherous,â A clashing sound of song and lamentation,â A tragic spectacle of men and things Innumerable and hurried and estranged, And all phantasmal, and remote to us, And insignificant,âlike some confused And shouted tidings, borne by false reports And faithless messengers, to where the Lord Still in dark chambers stayed and slept unknown. ... Then, with a deeper meaning, beautiful And tender, in our hearts revived once more Love, and the free hilarities of all The young earth-children in the rain-swept Spring, And the tremendous tears that rise like rain Blown from the dark, unplumbed, adventurous seas Of spiritual solitudeâto fall Like a confession in the dust of death. ... And thenâand thenâas wonderfully we Received the secret, and our sight, at last, Cleared with the vigil, and our hearts grew calm,â Turning, we saw in one another's eyes, Silent as star-light, silver-clear as song, The light from peak to peak beacon afar Thro' darkness ..., and our hearts kindled anew, And love matured and strengthened to endure The labour and achieve the heritage. ... 3 For then not yours alone and mine alone,â Darling, we knew at last!âbut ours and love's Was the supreme and sacred bestâthe soul's Perfect inheritance; and hand in hand, Ambitiously, we took the high resolve: Knowing no beauty of our lives was lost, No passion scanted, no desire, no joy, Withered or dispossessed, if all, at last, Was with the one perfection kindled thro',â If, for love's pleasure and communion, Spirit and sense and heart and mind together, Inseparable and single, all at once Thrilled to the deeper sense of life, and proved All valid, all victorious, all redeemed! ... Then haste was in our hearts lest we should live Leaving the best unsharedâlest we should die Dreadfully twain, before the task was done! ... âHaste! There is haste,â we cried, âfor time is now And brief; and love's far prospect goes away Down the free high-road of the perfect quest ... And it may well be long! ...ââYes! long indeed, We thoughtâwho knew how much the heart is frail, How dark the venture and how far the goalâ, Well may it be, in truth it shall be long, It shall be gradual and austere to bring The wild wild love into the soul's dominion; It shall be strange and splendid to prepare The House of song and fire and festival, His House at last, his lord-ship, for the Lord; It shall be wholly arduous and divine And feasible to lock the lips of Pan With the tremendous silences of truth, And task his strong lascivious limbs with toil: To force true service from the ancient foe, And lay strict burdens on the winged steed; And it shall be a triumph and ecstasy To drive love's lightnings up the sullen night,â To fashion of the fire that lurks and leaps And sings and kindles in the source of life A lamp to guide us in the spirit's peril! ... So, in life's haste and in love's jeopardy, Were we resolved, however hard and long It well might be, and we however weak, To lay, with hands of longing and control, The soul's strong harness on the mighty beast, So he might labour for usâuntil at last We, of his strength, were lifted and unbound ... 4 Soft, sombre hairâstrange sweetness of my Loveâ Clear, rose-pale, sensuous lips, and white, small breasts Set spaciously asunderâ, not in vain, Not for the moment's rapture are you fair! Deeper than life, and nobler far than joy, In you previsioned, may the mind discern, The heart receive interpretationsâsigns Soon to reveal the secretâ, as we stand, Like exiles who return from very far, Where the calm light lies warm along the threshold, And the soul's silence in the shining house Welcomes with love the glad wayfarer home! ... Homeâto the soul! My Darlingânow, indeed, More than the promise is fulfilled, we know! ... For we have been, in many a night and day, Perfect to one another; we have loved, And felt the imperishable hours bring forth Beauty, and delicate intensities And amplitudes of being, and liberties, And rapt persuasions of the living truth. ... And we have lived and loved by noon and night, Seeming transfigured ...; and the loveliness Of earth and sea and sky has been to us More spacious and sublimesâa more serene And spiritual rapture! ... Yes!âand life Is, in its sensuous strength, a sacred thing To us; and all its large hilarities, Flushed youth and sexual impulse in the blood, The flowing and abundant natural heart's Affections, and the mind's far gyres of thought, Yield to the spirit and the finer sense And understanding, patiently matured, And stedfast longing and adventurous mind, Treasures of theirs beyond our partial dreams ... Home, to the soul! ... My Darling, still and still The quest is oursâthe quest, in sense and soul! ... Still is the way before us, and the power Within us, and the longing unassuaged,â Darling!âand still between us life and love! ... II That day we saw the sunlight dawn and die, The twilight close, the dusk grow deep and still, The red moon rise, the white moon climb the hill, And darkness fill the caverns of the sky... That night we saw the storm-strewn beaches lie Endless and pale, the midnight stare with stars, The ocean flash like countless scimitars,â And felt the feet of time go soundless by... That day! That night!âWe saw the harvest rise, Of truth's immortal seed, and yield its grain, Where thro' the soul's starved acres love had passed... We were like mariners whose sleepless eyes Have sought on each horizon's verge in vain Their landfallâand who come to port at last! ... III That day love stood like sunrise at the goal; The labyrinth of life seemed filled with light; And, as we passed, a splendour calm and bright Wreathed for the brows of death an aureole. Swiftly, we saw dissolve from pole to pole Wide gyres of indistinguishable night, Till, grave with raptures of austere delight, We stood in the vast day-break of the soul! ... Then, as in memory's spectral afterglow, Life seemed a rumour of far things, a tale Told in a ghostly twilight, long ago ... And Love, whose guidance we had shared so long, Paused on the verge of death's inviolate pale With lips of silence and with eyes of song ... IV That night of spiritual silences We found love's inmost silence, where the days Are silent, where the perishable phrase Of song is silent, and where silence is Like light along majestic distances Opened before the soul's unswerving gaze ... Where life is silent, and the blatant ways Of life, and life's divine uncertainties ... There we beheld the dark enigmas yield In silence, and in silence truth appear, Stainless as star-light on a silver shield ... And still we felt, as in transcendent skies Beyond the mind's last outpost, calm and clear, Silence and glittering tranquillities. ... LOVE IN LIFE I Beauty and Truth are like a stedfast shore Bathed in tranquillities of boundless light; Veiled in the stainless garments of the night, Gemmed with the glory of eternal stars; And there, enisled above the reach and roar And windy wreck of Time's abysmal sea, Life, like Odysseus worn with works and wars, Love, like the Nymph Kalypso, half-divine, Meet and commune, transfuse and intertwine, Thro' mortal hours of immortality. ... So has it been for usâas it shall be Still and hereafter so! But now, once more,â Now, while the powers of life and love are whole And perfect to their inmost core,â Now, one by one and all inexorably The imperishable hours are spent, The hours of new, renewed abandonment, Of life's surrender, soul and sense, Of love's possession, sense and soul; And while our spirits yield and yearn, And while the heart lies naked still And still the fain, flushed senses thrill, The swift and ceaseless tides return To bear life's restless venture hence. ... Now, thereforeânow, Belovedâmy Darling, now While still the golden and transparent glow Of the inextinguishable desire Colours thy pale and perfumed loveliness,â Now while love's assignation still is sweet In the high, bridal mansions of the heart,â Veiled and voluptuous and discreet, With eyes still open to their depths of fire, Still rash, still languid with love's long caress, Once more, with me, Beloved, rise up, depart!â Once more, Pass from the shadowed door! ... Winged with the Spirit; robed in light and song Born of the purest ecstasies which throng The unutterable heart transfused with love; Let us return, transfigured from above, As thro' love's lingering sunset's golden haze To life's familiar, tried and transient ways. ... Let us, as many a time before, Together, while the great lights wane, Traverse the sombre corridor, And by the steep, dark, silent stair Descend together from the secret room Where, thinly, in the perfumed air, Pale thro' the curtained window-pane, The veiled light falls along the breathing bed. ... While quietly overhead Round the low, narrow cornice grows the gloom. ... Let us return! This hour of life is dead: Love and the Truth's eternities remain! Hither and hence the ways of love are sane, Splendid and sane and secret to the end! Therefore with Love, as freely with a friend, Hence from the heart's invincible regency, From sanctuary, From this clear Eden, this sequestered place, The breathless, long desire, the brief embrace, The eyes that lighten and the lips that burn, Let us return! ... Life sounds its thunder-call!â Fearless, Beloved, as lovers let us go, Radiant with love's resplendent after-glow, Down from the garden and the festival; Down from the pleasaunce and the shadowed wall; Down from the vineyard by the shining shore; Down to the storm-swept stream of life once more! Come!âfor our lives shall not be less, Since Love goes with us side by side, Borne forth on Time's tremendous tide, Than in this Paradise of love's excess And incommunicable happiness. ... Therefore, receptive, ardent, bold, Let us go down, go forth, and fare: As, garmented in sunset-gold, Winged with the midnight's moonless air, Hazardous men go down in ships To the inhospitable seas. ... Swift and responsive on our lips, Life's large hilarities resound; Clear in our eyes and hearts abound The light no loveless vision sees, The joy no loveless heart can share; And, in the rumouring street below, Life's human currents rise and flowâ Whither or whence we neither know nor care! Only our hearts rejoice as now we goâ Lovers, alone, togetherâdown, This first of nightfall, to the sleepless town, The streaming thoroughfare! ... O my Beloved, how sweet it is, How dear and human, strange and sweet, Free and afoot a night like this, To wander forth; to feel again The mighty murmur and multitude of men; To see, in fire and smoke, the street, Strident as Hell's remorseless gorge, Furious with faces, disappear Between the endless lamps alight, Into the sunset flaming like a forge!â While, interfused with the gold atmosphere, Quietly falls, this end of afternoon, The grey, great shadow of night, Whereunder shines the round, red, murky moon, Like a low lantern, watchful and withheld Under the cloak of a conspirator ... The street is like a flaring corridor In some fantastic, harlot's house of song And wine and women and wantonness and wrong! ... And sweet it is to understand The rash desire, the thrilled delight, And by the restless charm compelled To feel our eager lives impelled With life's strong stream, and hand in hand To wander in the lessening light. ... O sweet it is, O wild and sweet, To feel the young heart's vagrancies Resume dominion!âwhile the night comes down, Dressed in her smoke-begrimed, star-spangled gown, Like a procuress, witching, old and wise: The silent, sinister, discreet Accomplice of the brawling, bawdy street, Who shelters and secludes from sight The dreams, desires and deeds that shrink from lightâ Exquisite, rash, lascivious privacies; The eyes of lust, the virgin's startled eyes; The assassin's knife, the victim's broken breath; The pain of poverty, disease and death;â The heart's supreme, inviolate secrecies! ... Yea, Loveâhow free, how intimate, how sweet, How vagrant and voluptuous, arm in arm, At dark to wander in the city street!â As lovers whose desires fulfil Of life and love the secret will, To pass, to pause, to swiftly lean In shadowed porticoes, to kiss With wilful lips, abandoned, eager, warm; With eyes unseeing and hands that clasp unseen;â To share our secret, and because of this Feel our two lives miraculously one, Our hearts disclosed in rapt communion! ... O Love, how sweet to fold our solitude About us like a mantle, and pass on Loved and companioned thro' the multitude! ... How sweet to have no heed or care Whither we go or whence we come, Since truth is ours to do and dare, And all the labyrinthine ways Of human life are the soul's thoroughfare, And all the spacious nights and flowing days Are as pavilions where the heart goes home To loveâthe perfect love we share! The soul is here, the soul is there; Hither or hence the heart is fain; The truth is hard and high and sane In every time and everywhere: And we as lovers well may feel The lustrous eyes of love reveal The free, unutterable, just And secret spiritual trust That truth is possible, that we Shall yet be perfect as we must! Love dares not dream of less than this; No less can life believe or be; The smiles and frowns of Lachesis, Who sits with fortune on her knee, Are to the spirit vain and vile. For always, when and where, we are,â Here in the street where mile on mile, In hope and fear, the captives press; There in the sacred, secret room Where life is love's and loveliness,â The human soul's transcendent doom Is ours alone to make or mar! Ourselves are all, and all we know: And therefore, strictly as the cost Of life to us is high or low, The game is won, the game is lost; Since always by how much we give Of life and love and thought and power and faith, By so much and no less we love and live, Find and possess the soul, And, reassured of life, confront the goal, Fearful of no betrayal after death. ... Darlingâthe street is endless ... and the night Eternal ... and the sacred, secret room Is always furnished in the heart and fair!â Love's bridal chamber is adorned, and there The Paranymph, arrayed in golden light, Waits for the Bridegroom in the quiet gloom. ... Still in the bridal chamberâstill alone, The Bridegroom and the Paranymphâwith love, With life and love together:âeven so Let us begone!âand we are gone, and go Into the street ... into the night ... Where the stars rise and life's dark waters flow ... Where, gyre on gyre and row on row, Shine, inextinguishably bright, The lamps that Truth, the eternal Lamplighter, Kindles above The brawling, bawdy street of life, To guide the spiritual Wayfarer ... Lovers we are! As lovers going home,â Home to the heart with love's high secret rife; Home to the spirit's thrilled eternity;â Come, let us go! The best is ours to be! Body and soul together, Darling, come! ... II I saw her shining garments cling Around her like a moon-lit mist; Her eyes were clear as amethyst; Her hair was like a sea-bird's wing Dark in the gold of evening; And in the hushed room's narrow space The light lay mild across her face: She seemed as one about to sing. ... She sang notâand without a stir Time passed between us; and the light Abounded, and the strength of love: The light, the life, the strength whereof The truth is nurtured ... while the night Darkened and the stars lightened over her. ... III Her voice is pure and grave as song; Her lips are flushed as sunset skies; The power, the myth, the mysteries Of life and death in silence throng The secret of her silences; Her face is sumptuous and strong, And twilights far within prolong The spacious glory of her eyes. Her heart is like a place of power, A pale of peace, a precinct of Passion and all-consuming love ... Her thought is like a lofty tower; Her soul is like a Bride therein, Whom only truth and love shall win. IV I saw her sandals of grave gold Move on the marble, soft as light; Her motion was like birds in flight; The bountiful, the new, the old Deep secret that no tongue has told Was born of herâas is the white First flame of day-break from the night, As song-birds wake, as flowers unfold. And then I kissed her sandals of Grave gold, and kissed her hands and mouth; And knew how more serene than song, How spacious and how strong is Love!â Spacious as thought is of the truth; Strong as the conscious soul is strong! ... UNISON I 1 Thronged with the unpetitionable truth, Which from the love-surrendered and one heart Shone in the spirit's starred tranquillity, Hued with deep light the soaring wings of song, And thro' the labyrinthine flesh transfused, Subtile as fire, the elemental blood, We felt the indefectible prodigy Of life respond to our prodigious lives, While, with an eye new-opened to discern Meaning and revelation, we beheld The immemorial loveliness of earth! ... The mountain rose in power beneath our feet, Vestured in basalt and the endless grass; Crested with forest swelled the distant hills, Whence towering unalterable amid Spacious serenities of sky and sun Rose the ranged peaks of naked stone. ... Below, Gold lightnings kindled on the leaping stream, And over nurtured fields and pasturage Coloured new harvests and perennial bloom,â While over all, like benediction, lay Calm azure of the immeasurable skies And stintless gold of the down-pouring sun! ... And we, in that exceeding hour, were not Passionless or insensible! The voice Of the united being of the world, Life's unison and love's antiphonal, Sang like an ocean to the inward ear; Beneath earth's bridal garments, gemmed with light, Enwreathed with flowers, and perfumed with the faint Measureless motion of sun-sweetened airs, The invariable beauty, like the clear Transfiguration of a dream, appeared To the dazed vision of the inward eye,â While in the spirit and the sense we took Our lover's will of the consenting bride! ... Thus to our eager and initiate senseâ In love and the sole spirit's truth conjoined,â Yielding her violated privacies, Nature revealed her nuptial nakedness; And we, against our human breast of love, Held the one heart of life, and felt our hearts, Filled with its mighty pulse, thunder to song! ... So, in the mind's resolvent unity, All powers and phases of the natural world Showed the one urge within, and we discerned In the rich tissue of apparent things The secret sense which is not theirs but ours;â So, of the sunlight and the mystic dust, The flowering hills, the open face of heaven, We phrased the full heart's wordless harmonies;â And so, to us, in liberty and light, Seemed the scarped summits of abiding stone Like the pure pinnacles of thought that rise In the clear aether of the mind's starred heaven! ... 2 O life's exceeding hour of strength and grace, Of gentleness and passion, when, like gods, We walked in native virtue, and, at ease, Fashioned in beauty our apparent lives!â When, interfused, the heart's persuasive trust, In spirit and the enraptured sense contrived Of our two beings one communion, And life's ephemeral metamorphoses Yielded their secret and were one and ours! ... Then was it well with us!âand so, in truth, So is it always with us, if we knew!â So are we always kinsmen of the sod And leagued with skies and mountains! Truth is one In the wide purpose of the spirit's life; And love's fount flows forever! ... And so it is That when at last the liberated heart, With love or the rapt spirit's strength fulfilled, Gives what so long its senseless thrift withheld, We feel the mind's immortal pregnancies Come perfectly to birth, and haply see, Clear in the freshening light, the pure gold's gleam Shine in the spirit's inmost treasuries! ... And so are we delivered! ... So it is, As by the wind of loosed, uplifted wings Or the strong, tender touch of a loved hand, On secret chambers of the heart and mind Some unsuspected door is set ajar, And all at once we feel the thrill and tone Of a great music, and the lyric cry Of phrased, puissant voices, sweet with song, Where, in life's holiest sanctuary, unknown, Unsought, inviolable, Olympian, The grave Gods feast together, and take no wrong Of the frail, feeble things we are and do! And thusâYea, thus indeedâthus perfectlyâ We are advised how dull we are and blind; How with contracted powers our lives are waste; How we are bound like slaves, like victims scourged; And how in shame, damnation and defeat The brief times of our being are passed away, Which well might be, in each momentous hour, Valid with victory and phrased in song, Fragrant with love, and with the natural truth Of the pure spirit freed and sanctifiedâ As one exceeding hour was once to us:â To us who were, from love-surrendered hearts, Thronged with the unpetitionable truth! ... II Breathless and unforeseen, it comes!âthe hour When, on the breast of the Beloved, we feel Almost the secret sense of life reveal Its meaning, and the source of life its power;â When, as in some vast sunrise, like a flower, Our soul stands open and our eyes unseal, While all that fear and ignorance conceal Seems in perfection life's predestined dower. Then, as it were against the inward ear, We hold in silence, like a chambered shell, The dazed one human heart ... and seem to hear Forever and forever rise and swell And fail and fall on Death's eventual shore, Tragic and vast, life's inarticulate roar! ... III Love gave us sanctuary!âand sense and speech Of what we were at last, at most, at best; Love gave us strength and faith to manifest The soul's majestic virtues each to each. We learned from love, what love alone can teach, How love is dying in hearts that long for rest; Love showed us how man's life is lordliest; Love put the stars of thought within our reach ... Love gave us guidance, and our right of way Into his Paradise: and there, alone, We were with love together day by day; Till we, in silence, breathless at the goal, Free of each other, burned and blent to one, Shared the last loneliest secret of the soul. ... IV Earth, sea and sky are not as once they were To us: there is no aspect of all things, No pulse of heart or brain, no whisperings Of truth's grave music to the inward ear, Unaltered or unglorified: the mere Being of life, intense as song-swept strings, Is like a breathless sense of soaring wings Loosed in the spirit's boundless atmosphere! ... We are not as we were! Our feet have ranged The summits of imperishable hours; Life is a lordlier hope; and we, estranged In secret and at heart from all control, Walk in the wide new futures of the soul, Charged as with incommensurable powers! ... STRENGTH AND SOLITUDE I 1 Sun, moon and starsâinviolate firmamentâ Phases of earth's inveterate alchemy Of life and deathâprofound tranquillities, Thunders and trepidations of the seaâ How often have you been to man in spirit A liberation and an ecstasy! How often has the soul gone forth with you, As, with the tide, a stranded caravel Issues by noble estuaries, impelled By streaming winds and led by the low sun, Into the light, into the infinite spaces! ... How often has the majesty and silence Of starlight, or the clear crying of birds At dawn, or the vast violet skies of evening, Befriended us with spacious influences, Composed the mind in quiet exaltation, And, thro' the shining fabric of the soul's Inconstant vision of eternal things, Strained and refined the clouded wine of life! How often has the sound and spectacle And splendour of the universal being Affected and admonished us to know In all the common ways and days of life The immanence of spiritual rapture; And given us liberty at last to learn What correspondence and complicities Involve the soul with sun and moon and stars, With sky and earth and sea and countless forms, Passions and appetites and dissolutions, Powers and faiths and pregnancies of life! 2 We have laid down our ear to the dumb sodâ We who are man and mortal as all things, And more and yet not otherwise than theyâ We have laid down our ear and heard the earth Of graves and the innumerable grass Whisper to us ... and we have heard the sea, Delicate and enormous, shout aloud And murmur in the midnight and the moonrise Vastly and with a tired and tragic voice. ... And we have heard the sunrise singing like A lyre of gold, and clear and faint and far, Star-choirs in the cosmic atmospheres! ... And, hearing, we have caught out of the one Immeasurable voice from every hand Our own soul's secret,âwe have felt, when all Our whole life's strength seemed one, and all our heart Was of one ecstasy, within ourselves These diverse voices blent into one tone Of the one Truth, one phrase of the one Song Everywhere singing for our audience! ... Yea, and of all this music of all things, Surely we too, hearing, and very fain Of the full import, which is ours, may yet At last, at leastâif nothing moreâdiscern How much and ever and all in all the soul Is everywhere for everyone of us Immediate and importunate!âhow much, In the pure purpose of the heart, the proud Desire of the indomitable mind,â Tho' the shrill chatter of our wasting lives Leaves us at last weak love and spent resolveâ The truth is arduous and discoverable!â And O how much on every hand, how much, When the rare hour of sight and insight comes,â Tho' it reveal to us how we are not At best empowered and daring for great deeds,â The broadcast very light of liberation Flares in the narrow vistas of our vision, Shines in the windows of our prison-house, Flushed and persuasive and unquenchable! ... O let us hear and see and feel and know That nature, which is ours, that even we, We too, whose lives have left their utmost strength Unused,âwe too, who have not truly known Nor arduously doubted, but instead Basely believed what seemed and was not true, May yet, at last, for the soul's sake, discern How all the meaning and the mystery Go hand in hand and commonly along The thronged and trampled avenues of life And death,âhow always and how much, Whether in nature's elemental being, Whether in labours of the lonely mind, Whether in love fulfilled, or life's gross toil And long-deferred perfection, by the soul We are invaded and possessed and graced! O let us, to the body and blood of life, And to the heart and soul of what we are, So animate and kindle that at last, Welcomed, restored, reminded to ourselves, We too may seem to pass beyond the veil, Threadbare with light,âbeyond the place of passions, And, on the threshold of the Sanctuary, Hear the last questions answered in the silence! ... 3 Yet, in that very moment when we dream Of the soul's inmost self as one fulfilled, Full well we know the end is not,ânor is there Ever an end more absolute than now! There is a strength and solitude within us That will not let us rest! ... and well we know That freshly and forever they shall return, The unanswered question and the pregnant doubt; And we, have we the passion and the power, We shall emerge from where we entered in, Deeming the goal was near, and pass beyondâ There to discern perfections unachieved, There to reanimate to truths unknown And liberties we dare not specify! ... Had we the strength!âHave we perhaps the strength, Who have all else beside? Are we not men? Is not the Universe our dwelling-place? And therefore perfectly in truth for us Is not the utmost wholly possible? ... O, with the baffled and the resolute Vanguard of liberal humanity,â O to so purge our lives of the mild hours, Our hearts of humble longings and meek hopes, Our minds of customs and credulities, That we may find the days wholly fulfilled And lightened of the Spiritâall the days And all things and ourselves, rich and revealed In the majestic meanings and the might And passion and pure purpose of the soul! ... O to be with Themâwith their lives who lived In truth, and with their hearts which knew no ease, And with their souls which could not be denied! ... O to be with Them!âLet us be with Them! Yea, we are more sufficient than we seem, We who stand out in the forefront of time, Last of the living generations, set With sleepless eyes on the last verge of thought. ... For we alone, bravely and all in all, We have usurped God's ancient heritage: And where He died we hear a single voice Of one who wakes into the world's dominionâ Our own voice singing where His choirs are mute: A voice of challenge and of celebration; A voice of love, puissant and serene; A voice that rings up the long road, and breaks, Where the Night closes like a dead man's lips, The inert, dark, dreadful taciturnities. ... A voice which the sad silence of spent things Out of the Past,âwhich all the harsh and high Clamour of life's huge process in the world, Threatens, it may be, but shall not subdue In anyone of all the least of us, If we but rouse in our whole living strength, As Jesus, once, and Socrates, to dare And live and doubt and die for the sole Truth! ... II Thought's holy place is like a sepulchre; The wine of love's communion cup is spilled; The House of Life is like a tavern filled With harlots, slaves and strangers, and the stir Of dancing feet before the flute-player, Of shallow voices shrill and counterfeit: And there the smoky lamps of lust are lit, And faith is frail, and truth is sinister ... Yet, in the sacred chambers of the mind, He lies as in his grave who is the Lord ... No rumours vex him, and his eyes are blind As death, and he is deadâlike Lazarus! What Christ shall resurrect him with a word? ... What Saviour bring him back to being thus? ... III We, who are spent with weakness, wrath and lust; We, who endure such vile captivities; We, who descend by desolate degrees The steep dark way, till dust returns to dust;â We, who are pure, exalted and august; We, who are Jesus, who are Socrates, Who are compact of sacred mysteries, Who are the very soul, loving and just:â Sheltered in life's deserted House, we seem Abject and senseless, like poor beasts who lair In some vast palace where death's darkness creeps Silently down to where we crouch, from where, Perfect and solitary and supreme, Heedless and motionless, the Master sleeps. ... IV Truly there is no law but truth; there is No judge but justice. They who use the sword Shall perish by the sword, for no reward Is there but virtue, nor shall evil miss The strict revenge of its calamities, Since in and of ourselves, perforce, are scored Exact effects for every deed and word,â Nor life, nor death forego the least of this! Nothing effects our destinies save we: Ours is the seed we sow, the fruit we reapâ Yea, and the heart's one flame of ecstasy, And the soul's vigil we are sworn to keep, And life's low average of strife and sleep, And, O, the best we are and dare not be! ... THE NOCTAMBULIST I That night of tempest and tremendous gloom, Across the table, for (it seemed to us) An age of silence, in the dim-lit room, Tenantless of all humans save ourselves, Yet seeming haunted, as old taverns are, With the spent mirth of unremembered men,â He mused at us. ... And then, âI know! ...â he said, âI know! ... O Youth! ... I too have seen the world At sunrise, candid as the candid dew; And felt, responsive to the cosmic life, My senses kindle and my veins abound,â My life leap forward like an eager flame! I know! ... It all returns to thrill me thro' To-night:âhow much upon the virgin mind Often the truth lies lettered plain and large, When, on the face of things, the flushed new sense Finds revelations which our faith receives, Till the whole meaning, from the spectacle Of earth and sea and sky,âour hearts attuned,â Smiles out under the sun! I know to-nightâ Catching your eyes beyond the candle-flameâ With joy, and not without a kind of sad Compassion, and the weariness of one Who has been all the rounds of repetition, How much you take it all for granted! Yes! ... And that's perhaps prosperity, as you Esteem itâchiming in your singing tones With the world's coarse appraisal. Now, at least, You feel man's life sufficient, and your strength Surpassing the whole task! You look abroad, And see the new adventure wait for you, Splendid with wars and victories;âfor you Trust the masqued face of Destiny. But Iâ I've turned the Cosmos inside out!â he said; And on his lips the shadow of a smile Looked hardly human: â... Inside out!â he said. And we said nothing; we discerned a vague, Certain and incommunicable sense That we, in his inscrutable regard, Were but as phases of some general dark, In which his life was spent, staring for stars. ... Then we remembered how it sometimes chanced That he would sit and talk, over his wine, Of his adventures; so we held our peace, And saw the candle-flame burn up before His solitary eyes, and could not smile At recollection of his trivial phrase, As still he smiled,âtill, âI have been,â he said, âSince I was young like youâas once I was!â Round and about this little, day-lit world, And drained its springs of wisdom!âAnd to you, Who'll not believe me,âsince no man is spared His journey round the world, and from the Springs No drop can pass to quench another's thirst,â I'll tell the ancient, ill-considered truth: Wisdom's a shallow source, and all the world Is near and small! Yes! the one soul within Contains them all and yearns unsatisfied! ... Yet, I believe, you realize, at the least, That ignorance can only be the bliss Of fools, and foolsâWell, you are not so tame! You'll make the journey,âfor at last by these Peripatetics one may chance to learn What knowledge is,âand thenâand thenâat last Bounding the Lord's domain on every hand,â As here the unconquered darkness circumscribes Our candle's humble regency of light,â There are the Frontiers!â In his eyes there shone Perilous ecstasies. ... He paused; and we Saw the mild radiance slumber in his wine, Sweet as stored sun-light from the vine-clad hills, And felt our hearts beat high, as tho' we shared His solitude, and in the ambient dark Stared with his star-lit vision. ... âYes,â he said, âThere are the frontiers,âfar for you, and near About me hour by hour; and all between Is the old, same adventure of the mind, Seeking, with no suspicion how the end Will cheat its longing and deride its hope, Ever its long-accumulating spoil, Its hard-won, hazardous inheritance. Yes!âI have stood in the beginning, where You stand; and gone the journey you shall go; Wrought the same tasks, and battled with the Godsâ As all we must!âand loved, as all we may, With the old, pagan ecstasy! My sense Was not less foolish nor less keen than yours Of freedom measured as my will should choose: So, in my scorn and strength and pride, I choseâ Heedless of all save just the mind's conceived Perfection, and the heart's imagined bestâ Life's lordliest liberties:âchose Loveâchose Truthâ Chose to respond in all my works and days To powers transcendent, which I knew not of! ... So, witless, wilful, wonder-struck with life, I captained all my voyage with ambition Nothing could satiateâas the failure proves! Yes, I was young, I grant you!âAh, but what If now, despite all wisdom and the years, Youth's first resolve, in life and spirit still Held stedfast unto death? I ask you, then Might not the heart within me, greatly glad,â Almost with pride, as one who sees the gold Of day-break glinting in his sunset skies,â Revive its by-gones? Yes! I feel anewâ The young heart's blood afire in every veinâ What love was once (who know what love can be To the whole man matured!), when IâI too, Flame-fed with passion in the moonless night, Watched to descry one casement thrust aside, To hear one voice make music of my name; Or felt the silken whisper of one robe, The beating of one heart, one eager tread Come to my assignation in the dusk! ... Yes! ... and I feel anew the splendid zest Of youth's brave service in truth's ancient cause,â When, with the self-same thunders that you use, Edged with a witâat no time Greek!âI too Most pleasurably assailed and tumbled down, With a fine sense of conquest and release, The poor, one, old, enfeebled, cheerless God Left to us of our much be-Deitied And more be-Devilled past! And much beside I well recall; and if I smile, it is The smile we give to childrenânot in scorn! Rather be sure I know there are those things We do in youth, and may not choose but do: Old battles fought again, old voyages Renewed, and old discoveries re-made, And much brave marching in well-trodden ways,â All with a freshness beautifully ours! Youth has its spacious leisures, when the brave, Superfluous, necessary things are done; When worlds are conquered; when the old vain Gods Must fall again; when in the very face Of multitudes we revolutionize! And all's well done, I doubt not;âtho' the times Of life may well seem all too brief to waste! But this comes later, whenâwe learn!âas learn We must, if we go forward still from strength To strength incessantly,âto wage no more With phantoms of the past fortunate wars; To die no longer on the barricades For the true faith; to spend no more the rich And insufficient days and powers of life Striving to shape the world and force the facts, Tame the strong heart and stultify the soul, To fit some creed, some purpose, some design Ingeniously contrived to spare the weak, Protect the timid and delude the fools,â Who feel no deep, inspired response to life's Whole power and peril;âand to beautify By nice discrimination,âto explain By phrase and fraud and fancy,âto reform By dint of gross damnations and a most Robust stupidity! The time must come When we can deal in partialities No more, if truth shall prosper: for we stand Awfully face to face with just the whole Secretâour unrestricted Universe, Spirit and sense! ... And then, abruptly then, Swift as a passion, brutal as a blow, The Dark shuts down! ... and, desolate amid Fair ruined dreams and strangled ecstasies And lights we saw as stars, suddenly quenched, We stand upon the Frontiers, and confront The illimitable Night! ... And, O, the truth Is terrible within us!âfor at last We touch our boundsâwe fill, in every gyre, In all its pearly mansions, wondrously, Up from what blind beginnings, long-evolvedâ The unfinished shell of our humanity; And feel the sunless, soulless, shoreless sea Immeasurably about us ... and we knowâ Walled round and prisoned in the senseless darkâ How little we are free! ...â He smiled no more. His lean hands closed together, and the light Waned in the silence like a dying song. ... Our minds seemed sleepless as a star, our hearts Yearned to his meaning, and our eyes discerned The plain lights lessen and his face grow far. ... Then, as it seemed out of the dark, he saidâ âThe Night is best!âfor only when we fill The total measure of our human ken, And feel in every exercise of being The bondage of our fixed infirmities, Are we assured that we, in every cell And nerve, respond to all life's whole appeal, Known and unknown, in sense and heart and brain; And, utterly at last in unison,â Beast, man and God, their several strengths as one,â Meet the whole issue as a true whole man! Only the Night is bestâthe Night wherein Our eyes, long-used and wearied with the gross World's inconsiderable spectacle, Grow spacious, and, no longer blind with sun, See, in the incommensurable dark, Sudden as song, above, beyond usâstars! ...â He paused; and then, across the table's space, Gazed, as it were to fix us, each in turn; And, with a smile that failed to cheer us, saidâ âI'm a Noctambulist!âfor in the Dark Journeys are endless; and the virtue is Of life's pure essence, which we term the soul, To find small profit in appointed ends, And weary of a measurable world. My feet have tried all paths that man has trod, And all lead out thro' twilights, and beyond, Where man has never trodâand where I go! ... And life and love and death and thought and truth Seem strange and new to me,âwho yet have been Round and about this little, day-lit world, And drained its springs of wisdom,âas to you They do not seem, in youth's fresh hour of faith! For the reality is all my care! Little I heed, in splendour or dismay, How men perambulate their common streets, Drifted and driven, caused and causeless things; Or drench the highways of their huddled marchâ Forced by essential powers they only serveâ With sweat and blood and tears. They go their rounds, Caged and constricted, forced and overborne, And all unconscious of their servitude And dark confinements,âhelpless, pitiable And insignificant; yet all their boast Is freedom, and their faith is liberty. But he alone is freeâat least in some Measure he may be free!âwho takes the Dark's Uncharted venture with a homeless eye! ...â In the strict silence while he spoke no more We heard the tumult of our hearts, and feared Almost as men fear death, and knew not why We feared ... until at last, while at the closed Windows the wind cried like a frenzied soul, He said, âI too have tried, of mortal life, The daily brief excursions! Now I watch You turn and turn in the same beaten track Of brief desires and strict necessities, While from the thronged vast circus round about Stare down upon you all the eyes of the world Which crowns the victor and the vanquished scorns And thus, or well or ill, you run your race, Going no-whither tho' the prize be won ... I know!âI ran once!âand at last o'er-ran My shadow!âYes!âand so, abruptly paused, Torn with tremendous laughter and wild tears, Feeling truth's silent and relentless scorn, Flame-edged, of all I was and all my deeds; And set upon by the derisive shout And fear and anger of the world, I broke The circus walls, and hastily passed on, And found the Darkness everywhere, and saw, Thereafter, certain stars! ... And now, at least, I go no more the dull, determined rounds, Like a tame squirrel whirling in its cage! I'm a Noctambulist: and in the Night The star-traced, trackless ways return no more. ... Thus have I learned that only in the dark The freedom and the kingdom of the spirit Are ours to seek; and I have felt the one Utterly loosed and loving woman's heart, There where the twilights failed and night came on, Thrill to life's inmost secret on my breast ... And I have known the whole of life and been The whole of man! The Night is best!âfor here, Here where the world throngs and the day-light falls, Here show the Marches and no Stars are seen! ...â He rose, and we, who watched his face, discerned The passion! ... Swiftly he resumed his cloakâ And he was gone! ... and thro' the open door Bellowed the tempest, and the star-less dark Over our one, quenched candle reigned supreme! ... II We heard his footfall on the vacant stair The whole night long. We lay awake in bed And heard him climb;âbut those who slept instead Smiled and assured us that he was not there. We had our own important things to care Aboutâplace, profit and the daily bread; And then the street so thundered in one's head ... And often life 's a commonplace affair! Yet then we heard him!âwe not they were right: We heard himâYes! tho' now we sleep by night Almost as soundly as we sleep by day, We waked, we heard him, heardâand nothing more. ... For we, inert as they who heard not, lay Damned and dishonoured as he passed our door! III Recreants un-armoured for a hopeless war, We made with life the needful compromise: Yet, tho' we were not great or good or wise, We knew that he was not as all men are! ... The meaning of the things he said was far To us, and in the darkness of his skies, Save as the light was mirrored in his eyes, I think we never saw a single star ... Yet, in the vexed and vital years of youth, At night, alone, with all our bargains made, We found his smile intolerable as truth; For we, sered soul-deep by that scorn of his, Felt in ourselves his ancient, undismayed, Inexorable incredulities! ... IV âOnly the Dark! ... Only the Mystery! ...â He said. âOnly beyond, above, before! ... OnlyâO Captives of the wave-walled shore!â Only the incommensurable sea! ... Only, for eyes that all too wisely see The sun at midday, and are blind therefore, Only the Darkâwhere, lambent to the core, Gyre the great stars' deepening galaxy! ... Only of ignorance the ancient wrong; Only of life the viewless counterpart; Only of truth the secret undivined; Onlyânew ranges for the feet of song, New loves of the inextinguishable heart, New powers of the imperishable mind! ...â FAITH I There's a star overseas like a dew-drop new-hung on a bud that uncloses; There's a fire in the turrets of heaven; there's a flush on the breast of the sea; And the gates of the sun-rise are filled with a flame as of myriad roses, That kindles ineffable vistas, a world re-created for me. There's a hill in its vestment of dew-fall that kneels like a priest to the altar; Low bird-cries resound in the silence, frail tendrils reach forth to the light; The fields flower-breasted are fragrant, and fresh the faint breezes that falter:â Life's faith in the future is perfect, life's dream of eternity bright! ... If ours were the faith of the petals unfolding, the nest and its treasure,â The faith all revealed and illumined, the faith that alone makes us free,â What divine understanding were ours of the sun-light that flows without measure, Of the silver of moon-light that rings down the resonant floor of the sea! ... What divine understanding for life; for the world how majestic a meaning; What truths by the way-side; in martyrdom, poverty, pain, what delight; What poems in the midnight; what visions revealed that the darkness was screening, As like fire-tinged incense the dawn-mists flush deep round the knees of the night! ... O, beware! for the safety we cherish is false:âwe are blind! we are soothless!â Have we learned how the fields are made fruitful? Are we aimed to life's ultimate goal?â O for faith to accept for our lives not an ecstasy less, not a truth less, Than the world and the senses afford us, than are sphered in the scope of the soul! ... II To-day the Lord sleeps in the House of Life ... Round him the dark is dumb, deserted, deep; And all the haste we make, the feast we keep, The law we serve with cross and cord and knife, The Gods we supplicate, the tears we weep, The crowns we win as victors in the strife, The forms and fears with which our days are rife, Like vague, fantastic dreams perturb his sleep ... He sleeps and dreams to-day and yesterday.â When shall he wake, and in his eyes the breath Of day-break burn with truth's eternal beams? When shall he wake? ... We ask in wild dismay!â Haste! lest he sleep, as now he sleeps and dreams, Dreamless to-morrow in the House of Death! ... III Yet, as the truth's new testament contrives, Daily within the meditative mind, Orbits of light where thought before was blind, And where was doubt supreme imperatives;â So, in the high adventure of our lives, As we are real, receptive, unresigned, Seeking the Lord, we shall not fail to find: Till strength by strength his regency revives ... Then shall his will and work alone be done In all we do; his voice alone resound In all we say; and he alone confoundâ Imperishable when all else perisheth!â With eyes of daring and dominion, The void, vast vision of the Sphinx of Death! ... IV Hourly to find perfection in all things, And in ourselves perfection;âday by day, Greatly adventured on the endless way, To realize truth's inspired imaginings;â To beat up the wide skies of thought on wings Radiant with sunrise;âto depart away Into the future with the great grave gay Passionate heart of life that loves and sings;â This is the soul's desire!âthe secret aim Of life's dim aspiration, from the sod Thro' countless forms, thro' beast and man and God!â This is the mind's pure ecstasy; and this Is love, which kindles to a single flame Life's immemorial validities! THE CITY I Wherever man has loved and lived, Has starved his soul or slaked his lust, Has trusted and betrayed his trust, Has wept, rejoiced, blasphemed, believed; Wherever in the senseless dust His wearied, hasty feet have trod; Wherever he has dreamed of God And dared believe that Time was just; Wherever, heedless to discern And careless of the soul's concern, Man's avid heart has coveted The little of his daily need,â Thrones, powers, dominions, riches, bread;â While, overgrown with tare and weed, The fruit of Truth's eternal seed Was left to rot unharvested; Wherever man has heard, instead Of thought's serene, grave, inward voice, The world's persuasion, loud and sweet, And made with all the world his choice To traffic in the common street, To live as all men must who live For what reward the world can give, To wander aimless here and there On life's familiar thoroughfare Where the Innumerable pass, Whose days are waste as withered grass, In fear and hope, in storm and stress, From nothingness to nothingness; Wherever man has been steadfast And, patient as the truth must be, Fulfilled his human works and days, Or, blind with secret ecstasy, Has fled from death, and fled in vain, By vagrant, dark, eccentric ways Which led no-whither first and last; Wherever man, diseased, insane, Delirious, drunk in heart or brain, Has ravened like a raging beast, Has strayed or stayed, has been, has ceased, Inglorious and irresolute; Wherever man was mild and mute, Was loud and fierce, was sane and strong; Wherever man has blown life's lute And phrased the harmony of things, Or touched the harp of love to song And learned to use the voice that sings; Wherever, in whatever days, Majestic, mighty, mad or mean, Man's human being once has been Or being once has ceased to be;â There, interlocked inseparably, Diverse yet single near and far, There is the City!âwhere the ways And byways of the City are. II There is the City!âvast, sublime, Serene, discordant, sordid, small,â Hither and hence in space and time The self-same City, all in all, Is here and there, is first and last! There where the twilights fail and fall; There in the wide and wasted Past When Time was vacant, vague and vast; There where the light of truth is least, Where life, transcendent of the beast, Was first in man's resemblance cast; There where in jungle, waste and fen, Coeval with the birth of man, The byways and the ways began, There is the Cityâthere and then! And there and thence the City is: Where near and far the countless ways Record in each evolving phase Man's endless metamorphosis; Thence from the sunless depths below, Hither by ways we know not of Of life necessity and love, The long, hard, human high-ways come; And whence they come and where they go,â There at the dark circumference, There is the City, there and thence;â Here where we live and make our home, Here is the City!âhere and now: Here where the dull and aimless plow Of gross desire and bitter need Furrows the barren fields where chance Has sown the seed of circumstance Whereof the fruit is Destiny; Here where the thrifty soil that teems With good grain waste and many a weed Starves at its root the Sacred Tree Of Knowledge; here where Love dies young, Where Truth's stern secrets find no tongue, Where the mind's weakness and the heart's despair Brim the deep bowl of human ignorance With the mandragora of dreams; Here in the loud, long thoroughfare Made straight and smooth by countless feet; Here in the mean, familiar street Where, in the Spirit's jeopardy, Men wake and sleep and take no care Of why or whither, whence or where:â Here is the City!âhere are we! ... Here is the CityâHere! ... But there, There where the brave are gone before, There where the lamps of Truth and Love Shine steadfast at the Secret Door, Is not the City!âthere above, And there beyond and forward there; There where the high-ways hasten hence; There, up the steep and star-lit stair, Where they are gone, the Gods we did not know! Have we not seen them, heard them go In virtue and beneficence, The Bearers of the Sacred Flame? Who thro' the long, primeval twilights came, And thro' these purlieus where we are, Led by a faith, a song, a star, Passed on to where the summits kindle, where The living light grows large and lovelier, And where the eye long used to vigil may Discern, ineffable and far away, Tranquil as Truth's transcendent love, Spacious and excellently fair, Rise, pure as diamond, Poised in the sun-swept silence far beyond And far above, Where at its heart the City is, The still, clear marbles of the calm Acropolis! III There is the City!âthither let us go! We have too long lived out our times in vain! Let us depart! What profit shall we gain If, when the labour of all our days is done, Ourselves are vanquished and the world is won? Let us depart! for well we know Life wills us forward to a better place Than this cramped room of weakness and disgrace, And forward all the song-voiced trumpets blow Their challenge to the rising sun! Forward the thoroughfares of thought go hence From excellence to excellence, And have we will to walk thereon, Hence, as they lead us, we may go! Hence as they lead us, They are gone, Those hardy exiles who with eager feet Fare forward up the shining street; And as They neither rest nor sleep But Truth's eternal vigil keep In strength and silenceâso must we! For there, and always forward there, There is the City, where the soul Is free in Truth's divine control And native to the lucent air! Let us depart!âtho' there above It well may be the ways are steep The great lights far, the darkness deep, The Soul has no concern thereof,â Whose longing is all thither and all hence, Whose will is unappeased to make its home Not in these purlieus of the City where The sunless hovels of man's indigence Crowd meanly on the sordid thoroughfare, But there where thought's immeasurable dome Kindles and clears and is fulfilled with light! For there by day the lordly sun Of all the heart's surpassing love Moves in his azure calm immensities; For there by night The stars of Truth are one by one, Like silver syllables of song, Uttered in thought's tense taciturnities, And forward, all the large night long, In stately constellations move; For there the Parapets and Palaces, Resplendent in their ordered distances,â The lofty Towers, the shining Dome Of the Spirit's Fatherhouse, of Home, Rise radiant in the lucent, free, Fabulous spaces of eternity; And on the ramparts, all day long, Clear-eyed and calm and vigilant, The mind's supreme tranquillities Brood on the soul's infinities Till all we are and all that is Is sacred and significant;â And there and then at last we may stand up and sing, Rise up with the rose-coloured dawn on either wing, And with a voice exceeding sweet and strong Phrase in the heart's antiphonies of song The soul's clear chaunt of challenge and reprieve,â And perfectly, at last, and wisely live! For, builded solely from its base for this, There, perfect at the core, man's City is! LOWER NEW YORK BEFORE DAWN Time has no spectacle more stern and strange; Life has no sleep so dense as that which lies On walls and windows blank as sightless eyes, On court and prison, warehouse and exchange. Earth has no silence such as fills the range Of streets left bare beneath the haughty skies:â Of unremembered human miseries Churned without purpose in the trough of change. For here where day by day the tide-race rolls Of sordid greed and passions mean and blind, Here is a vast necropolis of souls! And life that waits as with suspended breath, Weary and still, here seems more dead than death, Aimless and empty as an idiot's mind. AT DAWN Here is the dawn a hopeless thing to see: Sordid and pale as is the face of one Who sinks exhausted in oblivion After a night of deep debauchery. Here, as the light reveals relentlessly All that the soul has lost and greed has won, Scarce we believe that somewhere now the sun Dawns overseas in stainless majesty. Yet the day comes!âghastly and harsh and thin Down the cold street; and now, from far away, We hear a vast and sullen rumour run, As of the tides of ocean turning in. ... And know, for yet another human day, The world's dull, dreadful labour is begun! [We have loathed him, we have loved him, we have lived for him and died for him] I We have loathed him, we have loved him, we have lived for him and died for him; We have agonized and wearied in the travail of his birth; We have lured him and procured him, we have sinned for him and lied for him, And known what he was worth to usâand known what he was worth! We have never dared to trust him, never dared to tell the truth to him: We have done the work and waited; we have borne the pain and smiled; We have been despair and evil, virtue, aspiration, youth to him; We have cheated him and charmed him, for we knew he was a child! We were never what he thought us, never what he said we seemed to him; And of course we never told him, and of course we never cared: We have been the thing he loved, the strength he lacked, the dreams he dreamed to him, And for what his love conceived us he has worked and sung and dared. And our hearts have bled and broken, and our fleshâGod knows!âhas burned for him: In despair and pain and passion we have loved himâas we must! For his children and his labour we have schemed for him and yearned for him, Believed his boast and soothed his tears, assuaged and shared his lust. We have loved him without reason, without stint, without surcease of him; We have feared his wrath and weakness, feared his madness, feared his fears; We have tamed him and caressed him, and our lives have had no peace of him: For his Gods and greeds and glories cost our blood and sweat and tears! ... He has made us to his pleasure: we have had the senseless worst of him; We have made him to our purpose, then and now and still the same! And as wife and slave and mistress, now adored and now accursed of him, We have bought, seduced, compelled him to our sacred single aim. Yes, we triumph! He is ours!âBut ours, we know, is not the whole of him! Weak and stupid, vain or vicious, we possess, who care and can; But we learn, when he escapes in truth and spirit all control of him, That while we are always woman, he is lessâand more than man! ... SUN, MOON AND STARS I THE SUN Source, strength and splendour of the dawn and day; Lord of the noon and of the afternoon; Soul of the sunset; master of the moon;â We are thy creatures! ... who shall pass away From grief and joy, from labour and love and play,â The will that strives, the hopes that weary and swoon:â For these are life and life shall leave us soonâ Thy life incarnate in our mortal clay. Yet is it conscious of some nobler end, In us transfigured, than to live and die Blind and enslaved: in ways unknown to thee, In free communion with a lover or friend, In thought's perfection, we exemplify What more than life thy life has come to be! II THE MOON Moon of our nights of youth, grave ardent gold Majestic mistress of the yearning sea; Moon of our young love's blinding ecstasy; Moon of mused secrets that no tongue has told;â Moon of our first fine midnights, pure and cold, ... When, with the stir of God's nativity Within us, we discerned the Mystery And guessed what death might give and life withhold! Moon of impassioned vigil in the high Spacious tranquillities of earth and sky, As, then, we saw thy light in darkness move Like guidance on the immeasurable seas, So, now, we see the full-orbed moon of love Move on the soul's more vast immensities! ... III THE STARS They saw the self-same stars we see to-night At Ur, Nippur, Mosul and Ispahan, And where the Tigris and Euphrates ran, And where Bagdad displayed the Caliph's might. The Jew, the swart Arabian robed in white, The Kurd, the camel and the caravan Passed on their way from Cairo to Sistan, Led thro' the trackless deserts by their light. They saw the self-same stars as we:âperchance They felt as we the self-same rapt surmise Of life and death! ... until they saw as we,â Thrilled with the soul's supreme significance,â Strange constellations dawn within their eyes, Wrought on the shadow of eternity! ... ILION I They turned into the day-break, and the light Lay level in their eyes. They held the free Fortunate wind across the blue bland sea: Of all their lives the flame burned wild and bright. Clear as the eyes of Helen shone by night The lordly stars, which spelled their destiny; The sun's perennial splendour seemed to be Gold as the hair of Helen in their sight. But Agamemnon, saviour of the fleet, Only forever saw, with haunted eyes, Iphigeneia bleeding at his feet; And, in prophetic rapture, felt, too late, Fierce as the eyes of Clytemnestra's hate, Burst from his palsied tongue death's strangling cries! ... II Crying, she woke, with fate's relentless hand Cold at her heart; and, breathless with despair, She saw the great gaunt galleys, and the flare Of camp-fires kindling on the Trojan strand. And Menelaus!âshe beheld him stand With ravaged eyes that could not cease to stare. ... She heard, borne up the windy Ilian air, The lyric language of the Fatherland. Then, with a roar as when the storm-wind blows, The innumerable alien city rose, And thronged the ramparts,âwhere, amid the gloom, The inviolate victim of God's thwarted lust, Cassandra, robed in mourning, crowned with dust, Wailed in deaf ears the inexorable doom! III He saw Scamander crawl in fire and blood, Stagnant with slain, beneath the burning wall. Seaward he drove! But still, tho' like a pall, Darkly, where once the rumouring city stood, He felt Death's immemorial silence brood; Shrill in his blood-sick heart he heard, withal, The shriek of Hecuba, the frenzied call Of Hector's Bride, bereft of motherhood! And still of Helen his only visions were! Her eyes of wonder, and her endless hair, Lightening like sunrise! ... still he felt, for her His wrath had branded with a harlot's shame, Leap in his heart the blind consuming flame Of love imperishable and love's despair! HERAKLES â... Amphitryon, banished from Tiryns, established himself at Thebes. Herakles, brought up in that city and skilful in physical exercises, surpassed all other men in the strength of his body and the greatness of his soul. He was scarcely adolescent when he delivered Thebes [from the tyranny of Erginus and the Minyans], and thus paid his debt of gratitude to his country. ... The fame of this exploit spread through the whole of Greece, and every one admired it as a prodigy. Creon, the King, himself impressed by the courage of the young man, gave him his daughter Megara in marriage; and, treating him like his own son, confided to him the government of his kingdom. But Eurystheus, King of Argos, jealous of the growth of the power of Herakles, summoned him to appear before him, and ordered him to perform his labours. At first Herakles refused, but Zeus commanded him to obey Eurystheus. Herakles went to Delphi, and, having consulted the oracle, he was told that the Gods ordered him to perform the twelve labours, and that, after their completion, he would receive immortality. âOn receiving this command, Herakles fell into great distress [of mind] ... he was seized with a frenzy. ... Madness took possession of his sick mind ... in one of his ecstasies of fury, ... Herakles pierced with arrows the children which he had had by Megara. ... Having recovered from his madness and become aware of his error, he was greatly afflicted by the excess of his misfortune ... he remained quietly withdrawn in his house for a long time, avoiding all human society. Time having calmed his grief, Herakles went to Eurystheus, determined to affront every peril [and perform the labours]. ... âZeus kept Prometheus chained for having given fire to mankind, and caused his heart to be devoured by an eagle. Herakles, seeing that Prometheus was punished only for having done good to men, ... saved the common benefactor.â Diodorus Siculus, IV, 10â11, and 15.

Sunset. The Agora is empty except for the WOMAN, who is seated on a bench against the wall of a house, and the POET, who stands before her, facing the sunset. The POET The birds go home at sunset, and my heart Goes home. The day closes its tired wings, And in the violet evening there are stars And silence ..... And the best there was to do, The best of us we left undone to-day, Now like a warrior worn with doubtful wars, Waits for the morrow, heart-sick yet resolved. The sense of life is secret and serene At twilight, and the flame of lifeâ The WOMAN Is love! The POET turns as tho' suddenly recalled to a sense of her presence, and looks at her for a moment in silence. The POET Of old your eyes persuade the heart like peril ..... You are the Siren of the seas of life. What stately ships, full-sailed for Paradise, Captained by young, superb adventurers, Haughty in hope, impassioned in resolve, Thrilled with a mystic wonder in the mind, Drawn from their course, lie shipwrecked on your shores!â What is your wish with me? I saw your eyes Call to my heart across the crowded square. Now in the sunset all the crowd is gone. We are alone. Why did you summon me? A moment's pause. The WOMAN You are but newly come into the city? The POET Since yesterday. The WOMAN What race and place are yours? The POET In Athens was I born, and there my youth Was spent, and there, if home there be, is home. The WOMAN Why are you come to Thebes? What hope of good, What fear of ill impels your feet so far? The POET My hope is nameless, and the ills I dread Are housed within me!âbut the restless mind While there is life, affords us no reprieve; The impatient heart, eagerly and beyond The daybreak and the dark, drives us afar Over strange oceans and unvisited lands ..... The WOMAN The impatient heart!âO Heart of man that yearns After the Stranger Woman of young dreams! ..... The POET I know! I know!âyoung dreams! ..... But mine are old, Tragic and old, divine and real as life, And dwell within me like a visitation Of Truth's unconquerable and mystic hope Whereof no part is the flushed heart's desire. What tho'âas inwardly my blood believesâ You were the Stranger Womanâ The WOMAN I am She! And anciently and now I am the one Inveterate quest of life's dream-haunted days. In myriad ways you seek me, and you find Me!âtho' you think to find a lordlier thing. Yet, tho' you find me, you shall know me not, And I am strange to you forever! The POET To me Nothing of you is strangeâunless your name! I have had many lives before, where you Were something more to me than life itself; And after all my youth's vexed years with you, I know you and your secretâand the soul Within you, dark and undivined, I know! I am so long possessed of you I seem To have you as I have the voice of song, Clear in my heart and brain. There is no phrase Of laughter or desire or lamentation In all the tones and tremors of your voice, Various as wind, no silver gayeties, No cries, tense and tear-laden, strange to me. There is no perfume, bounty, brilliancy Or pleasure of your body, nor the least Stir of your subtle silks I know not of. I know the grave, smooth silence of your brows; And when your lips are eloquent and flushed With hunger and with thirst of love, I know you! I know the swift, sweet motion of your hands When they are fain of touch and tenderness ..... And I have long explored and learned to know The deep, dark twilights of your eyes and hair, The young, pale profile of your breastsâand how You are all warm and lustrous and superb! Neither within the house of ivory, The house of rose and pearl, am I a stranger: Your thought is in my brain, your mighty heart Is in my heart,âyour soul is in my soul! I know the chaste reluctance and the wild Appeal of the indomitable desire When life is given entire as love will! ..... And I have seen and celebrate in you The patient, tender truth and trust and care, The soul's perfection breathing into life Thro' love's obscure and elemental ways ..... The WOMAN You love me! I am she! I am the quest, I am the goal!âYou love me! The POET I have learned How, in the last fulfilment of the spirit, There is a nobler end for life than love, There is a nobler end for love than you! The WOMAN You have not well beheld me, who I am,â The Stranger Woman, even the truth of dreams, Splendid and strong and secret ..... The POET Fairer still Is the celestial bride, and statelier! ..... I have so greatly loved you that my love Is grown out of its childhood, which you are, To more than you can welcomeâmore than all Your love and you can freely welcome home! I am alone and silent after all; For none receive me now, none love me now ..... Time was when you received me, when your heart Was radiant and a refuge to me!âthen I uttered and was heard!âand I devised To set the sunset-coloured gem of song Upon your brows, to make your raiment of The unquiet silver of calm, moonlit seas, To give you sandals hued like flowers, and fill Your eyes with daybreak, and transfuse your hair With forest-twilights when the leaves are young And it is morning! ..... Then I said the new, The utmost things, and all things of you; kissed The wine-cup and your lipsâstraitly to feel The sacred frenzy shake this heart that bears The sacred flame, until I sang to you The wonder-song of the primeval earthâ How Eros was first-born of all the Gods, And first made Chaos pregnant of the world. O there was that to rouse me in a woman!â The beauty that is wanton as life is; The candour that is crystal-clear as stars; The love that has no other end but life, The life that has no other end but love; And all she is not, and the secrecy She is,âand life's lost wisdom, pure of thought, Which rises in her from what sunless springs! .. But now the ecstasies of thought advance The torch beyond the precincts of your love, Beyond the human pale of your dominion. The WOMAN So does life weary when its youth is spentâ And you count weariness a kind of wisdom! O you are wiseâin words! You are a poet! The cheat is not too plain. Yet one discerns How you are chafed and sharpened with desire! The thrill strikes thro'âand you make poems of it, Since there's imagination left at least To prove us how we are not respectable And give to lust a lyric rapture:âYes! Tamed tho' he be, the animal will sing! The POET The animal will sing and drink and lust And lie with you and love youâas a beast Can love! ..... for these and all hilarities Of the hot blood are still and anciently The sameâthey share their excellence with you! It is alone the spirit which is chaste; Which is austere and high; which is not eased By all old pious and pleasurable things; Which is athirst for news!âand in the search Is ventured out of your horizons, far Gone past you and beyond you, to return No more ..... whether the quest prove real or vain! I guess myself is more than you suppose, And excellent even beyond my dreams!â Who shall instruct me further what I am And shame my aspiration by their own? Not you, indeed! I know your message to me. You tell me nothing: for it is not I, The lyric voice, the florid animal, The lover, who is yoursâas he must be Who asks neither advancement nor the news! The WOMAN What are you more than sense and sentiment, Like other men? I have known men enough!â And many men your betters, and some men Strained to a singular high attitude Like yours,âand I have found where lust was laired In all of them! You leave me undeceived: The brute nurses his passions at your breast, And at the heart of your humanity There is the weak, wild longing of all men Merely for love and life's companioned joys And the mild fruit of happiness. The POET Not I Am minded any more for facile things. For the indwelling God stirs in his sleep Within me, seeing in dreams the early light Of dawn blur the blind casement of his room ..... The WOMAN Poor windy man, so grandly, with God's name, Mystic and eloquent! O you are desolate As a dead mind! I may not well believe Laughter stirs nowhere in youâas in me It leaps to shatter down your dreams ..... The POET Of all Sad things I least can laugh with you. Despise, Pity me as you will, yet so it is: I have not any sense of humour in me! I was not once so naked to the truth, So daring and defenceless; I was keen- Sighted to see the humour of the thing And none outlaughed me!âbut at last I felt Something more terrible than ridicule Strangely and stern as justice in myself! Then your alert and cherished humour-sense Sickened and all died out in me, died utterly Away ..... and left me with an abject smile, Which, like a threadbare cloak, can scarce afford Decent concealment to me from the world,â And something that still serves for laughter when The wine is in me! ..... But my secret is That I am serious! You will think me mad! But there have lightened to my inward eye Spacious and radiant serenities Wherein there is a voice calling me on! ..... My heart is shaken with the power of it! Before my citadel it sounds a challenge To wake the audacious virtues of the soul, Which are themselves their own sole arbiter!â Therefore I can no longer laugh with you. I am too tensely nerved with expectation Still to discern and celebrate the joke, And sort my mood with yours. A moment's pause. And so all's said, And I will leave you with your life, your love, Your laughterâwhich I neither serve nor share. Night has fallen. The POET pauses a moment and then starts to go. The WOMAN rises suddenly and prepares to follow him. The WOMAN It shall not beâI will not leave you now. A moment's silence while the POET looks at her intently. The POET Why do you follow me? The WOMAN I have no light. The POET And have I any you are witness of?â You know not what I am nor where I go. The WOMAN I have discerned that you are something more Than other men, to me. You give my life Serious, at last, and strange significance. And there is latent in your words to me Expression of supreme and secret things, Phrases of song that bring a high, swift sense Of flight and of adventure to the soul! And what I have received of other men You give me notâthe love, the lust, the gold, Which are a woman's price to the whole world. O, I am curious of the fellowship Of one who will not love me lest he lose The marriage-kiss of the celestial bride,â Lest being my master he is not his own, And gaining me he lose himself thereby. Therefore I will not leave youâfor a little ..... It may be I shall one day touch the term And find the worth of words, as now I am Not curious of love nor eager any more. Then I shall leave you ..... and go on with life, Satiated anew and hungry as of old! The POET Hungry?âfor news! for news! ..... You know it too, The hunger and the thirst that drive us on, As once the gad-fly drove across the world The paranymph of God, delirious Io? You know the hunger?âthen we'll go together, Whither we cannot tell, nor to what end! End of the First Scene. SECOND SCENE A later hour of the same night as in the first scene. A feast in the palace of CREON. About the feast-table are CREON, HERAKLES, AMPHITRYON, ALCMENA, MEGARA, IOLAUS, and other men and women of noble Theban families. A HERALD stands behind the King's chair. The feast is served by slaves and the door guarded by soldiers. CREON to the HERALD The feast is ended. Call for silence! The HERALD Silence! Silence! The King will speak! There is silence. Then is heard a murmur as of a great throng outside the palace. A moment's pause. CREON Hearken! ..... To-night There is a rumour in my porticoes Of multitudes. It is my people. I Have called them, and this hour would straitly speak With them and you. I have not lightly caused Assemblage of yourselves and all the sons Of Cadmus, for with news of great concern To all my people am I charged to-night. To the guards Therefore set open wide the doors and bid My Thebans enter! I have words to say And deeds to do that must not longer wait. The doors are thrown open and the people enter without confusion. Gradually the entire hall is completely filled. When they are all entered and silence is reÃ«stablished, CREON without rising; in an even, clear, quiet voice Children of CadmusâThebansâCitizensâ My people!âHear me for your own concern! And rest assured I treat to-night with you No less a matter than the commonwealth. Yet I beseech you to be patient with me Also for some small business of my ownâ Some phrases of a life's apology That I've matured with life itself for you, And now at last have ordered and preparedâ Briefly, at least, and cheerfully!âto suit Your understandingâand my own as well! A moment's pause. I am your King; and I am oldâand wise! For wisdomâwhen the latter end of life Becomes indeed a luminous and large Tranquillity, as of some afternoon Of Autumn and calm weather by the seaâ Inures at lastâafter so many years! ..... At least there is a fine unfettered sense Of liberality which leads me on To say that I am wiseâand you will judge And disapprove me if you must! You may Believe me that I know what must be done While there is hope and Fortune's face is toward;â And I can now afford your censure! Yes, I can afford at last expensive things Which cost a man the kingdoms of the world And all their glory! I have lived my life; And there is nothing now can make it worth My while to shirk by any cant or creed, Enthusiasm or expectancy, Silence or sentiment, the free, extreme Analysis, the unrelenting, clear, Calm vision of a disenchanted mind. You cannot bribe me now by any threat Or ruin to my life's high edifice, Or any dazzled prospect of ambitionâ Hope or desire that it may one day grow Statelier and all my dreams come true of it!â To keep the old, pathetic, pitiable Conspiracy of silence and pretence That barely saves the faith on which you build! I know that you must build while there is hope Of profit, while the Bride is beautiful, While Fortune's prize, in whatsoever coin The world receives, inflames you to the task; And while you build you cannot help but say Your architecture is the noblest artâ The only art that life can labour at! You see the torch of life held high and bright Over my disillusion, and your hearts Are sad for meâbut I rejoice with you! For I have builtâand care not very much What happens! I am patient of all fools Who leave the why unasked; and I am mild With knaves, who teach the bawdy, blatant beast Pious and pleasant ways,âfor I am old And unimpassioned and contemplative. I think, despite these sceptical strange words, You will respect me,âfor I am your King, And I have proved myself among you all An architect. Therefore you will not say, âThis is the voice of failure!ââyet I know That you will find some other things to say Not half so true! For when a man is old, He knows, at least, how utterly himself Has failed! But say what things of me you willâ And be assured I sympathize! Indeed, A voice like mine is no-wise terrible, As might be the tremendous voice of truth, Should it find speech that you could understand! Yet it may vex and dreadfully distress Reflective menâif such indeed there be Among you allâand therefore be assured I sympathize! A moment's pause. And so I give you thanks ..... And take my leave. I think you almost guess The public business which is your concernâ And mine, since I concern the state and you. Briefly 't is mete that I advise you of it: I am your Kingâand will be so no more! Take leave of me, my people! for at last I have divined a man more apt than I To wage your wars and guide your policies.â A moment's pause. The King rises. All those seated at table follow his example. To him, Children of Cadmus, O my people, I yield your government, as I bequeath, When I am dead, my crown and realm to him! His praise is in your hearts; and by my will, And with your leave and loving welcome, he Shall be your Lord and govern in my place, Who slew Erginus and delivered Thebesâ My grandsons' father and in love my sonâ Herakles! The HERALD Hail! All hail to Herakles! A storm of enthusiasm breaks out among the people. When it has subsided and quiet is restored, all eyes turn to HERAKLES. A moment of silence. Then he begins to speak, finding his words with excitement and difficulty. HERAKLES Children of Cadmus!âYou have heard the Kingâ You know his willâbut mine you shall not know Till all is known and there is Justice in me! ..... Justiceâand Truth! ..... Nothing is yet resolvedâ Nothing! ..... And who can tell what Truth shall be? The adventurer departs; the tidal drift Clutches his keel; his eyes are dazed and dark; Strange are his dreams;âand the discovery Is far! ..... But should I find myself, be sure That I will be a guide unto you all! ..... A moment's pause. I'll say no more!âNothing is yet resolved ..... A moment of silence. At last the people applaud. Then, at a sign from the King, the doors are again thrown open and the citizens pass out. The King remains standing after they are gone. MEGARA, ALCMENA, AMPHITRYON, IOLAUS and the other guests at the feast surround HERAKLES, pouring forth congratulations and applause. HERAKLES, deeply moved, withdraws violently from the embraces of his family and the acclamations of his friends and, turning toward the King, breaks silence with profound passion. HERAKLES Is this your wisdom, Sire? and is it wise, Lightly, and thus with calm complacency, Now to believe that I, that Herakles Should hold himself so cheaply as your price? How have you come to think me, whom you love And praise, so vain a thing and spiritless, That I, like any rash, rapacious man, Should seize this brief preferment and renown And block with brilliant insufficiencies The fair-way of ambition?âBy the Gods, How pitiable a thing is man's regard! Since you, who count yourself matured in truth, Can guess no nobler destiny for man Than all his life to be as you have been, Public and proud, constrained and crafty-wise, As fortune served and chance was bountiful:â Himself, the while, illiberal and unknown, Captive and undelivered and deceived! Turning to the others And you! I marvel who it is you name, With tears and praise and passion, Herakles! By God! What gives you leave to think of me So meanly, and rejoice to see me sold Like any common man for a small thing? Have I not loved you all, incessantly Loved you and lived with you?âyet in despite Of all love's witness and the test of time You dare to hold me in so little honour That you have thought me apt to be content In these safe human mediocritiesâ That you have deemed my hope so temperate, For what I am, as fortune and renown Or all the world's casual supremacies! For my whole life long, with my whole heart's love, I have been with youâand you have not known me! ALCMENA What ails you, child? ..... My child! I love you, know youâ You are my son! HERAKLES My self is yet unborn, Which was not when your womb conceived and bore! AMPHITRYON What rage is this? Implore the King's forgiveness! Pray to the Gods who have shown favour to you! HERAKLES turning to the King Sire, I will not serve the Gods or you! Sire, I will not rule by grace of God Or by your grace! I will be Lord of none, And thus unto myself be Lord and Law!â No longer speaking directly to the King You think to bribe and browbeat Herakles, Force his desire and cheat his hope:âat last Learn from my lips that I will not be less In hope or longing than a man must be! I, with the soul's immortal thirst to slake, How shall I down into the shallow stream Where beasts and many men have drunk together And left foul waters strangled in their course? Nay, by this cup I am not comforted, I am not stayed!âRather, I swear to you Thirst shall consume me unappeased until I fill my pitcher at the living source, The secret, spiritual springs that rise, Radiant and crystalline in the deep light, Far on the utmost heights unvisited! You know me notâand scarce have I begun To know myself! Yet this at least I know: The life-lust and the florid animal Which laughs and longs, is pleasured and distressedâ The heart that feels and feigns, that faints and dreams, That sorrows and is gladâthe facile brain That schemes and lies and is alert to seize Success and is ambitious of no more Than serviceable ingenuity Can aptly compassâthat supremely serves To methodize the waste of the world's work To profitable order and endow Life's labour with a seeming worth and endâ These are not I! CREON Your pardon!âand be sure I have no angered heart nor outraged pride To vex you with!âI pray you answer me One idle question:âafter all, what else Is there of you save life and heart and brain? You are what feels and thinks and is. What else Is Herakles?âare you? HERAKLES I am what knows! I am myself, that knowsâand shall be known! ..... End of the Second Scene. THIRD SCENE Later of the same night as in the first two scenes. It is a clear, calm night of moon and stars. A public street near the city wall. At regular intervals the wall is rendered accessible by flights of narrow stone steps. The inner face of the wall is in a deep shadow which stretches out almost to the street. HERAKLES appears, emerging from the shadow, as he climbs the nearest flight of steps. He reaches the top of the wall and pauses a moment in silence. HERAKLES I know them now ..... but me they shall not know, Even at last! My youth was spent with them; They were my most familiar and my friendsâ My lovers and the lights of welcome to me ..... Yet they discerned me not, they knew not me! ..... And never shall they know what I become! Death is between us now: my youth is dead, And I am dying! ..... and I shall be reborn Beyond their understanding and their love ..... Even now I was a very stranger to them! How shall it be when all myself has been Is passed away and I am born again? ..... I dare not yet believe how utterly I shall be loveless thenâeven when love is A better thing to give, and, to receive, A more exalted thing! ..... Then I shall know, And be unknown; I shall be friendless then However I am heart-sick and alone!â O tender twilights of the days gone by, Peopled with those we loved and leave behind!â O secret, great departures, shared by none, Cheered by no friendly voices from the shore, No lamps set seaward for the ship's return!â O irremediable solitude Of him who sails, adrift and harbourless, Far out into the distance and the dawn!â Speak to my heartâwhen shall my lover come? Where is my friend? and how shall I be known? And who shall know me? ..... When the Child is born, The desolate immortal Child, I know That in the night of his tremendous birth, And in the dreadful solitude, he wails And wonders and is no-wise comforted! Shall none receive the Child? Am I at once The knower and the known? Is there no light From soul to soul, no love from heart to heart Can span the abyss and flame across the cold, Dark, dreadful spaces of my isolation? ..... I need assurance, now since love has failed So far, and life has so far failed to prove Myself or make me manifest to men. Who shall assure me and bear witness to me? Whence shall the signalâas from star to star Rings the clear cry of the celestial choirâ Sound thro' the tragic taciturnities Of solitude, to me? ..... to me at last!â Love to the Lover, welcome to the Friend, Raptures of recognition to the Lord! ..... HERAKLES pauses a moment; then turns and slowly goes back down the steps by which he ascended. As he descends he becomes gradually engulfed in the deep shadow. Before he reaches the ground, the POET and the WOMAN appear ascending to the wall by another flight of steps, some distance away. They reach the top and pause a moment gazing over the landscape. When at last they begin to speak, the sound of their voices causes HERAKLES to stop; and he continues to stand attentive and stirless in the shadow of the wall. The POET ..... Where is Endymion? The moon replies, Hence is my lover! ..... and the heart cries, Hence! ..... And hence the soul discerns the perfect friend! ..... They lure us hence, the patient hills and fields; The streams persuade us henceâhence to the sea, Where as of old the mythos of the life Of man enacts its endless destiny, And vast horizons indicate the soul! ..... Hence is the furtherance of hopeâ The WOMAN The song You lately sang cries to the spirit, Hence! Sing me the song again, for I would learn The words and have it in my heart alway. The POET I made it on a day of happiness, And I am glad to-nightâof life, and you. He sings. He is on the road before us, who is Lord and Life and Lover, He is forward in the fair-way, he is secret, swift and far; And our eyes shall wake to find him and our hungry hearts discover, As he leads us, where we follow; as he loves us, what we are! Where the winds are shouting seaward, where the sea is streaming onward, Where the Voice calls down to find us, fearless on the starlit way, We who watch shall make the land-fall as the ship drives shoreward, sunward, Where the mountains rise resplendent, rose-wreathed in the dawn of day! There his heart shall be our father-house, his arms receive and hold us;â As he knows us we are equal; as he trusts us we are free! We shall learn surpassing secrets that no lips but his have told us, We shall find in his embrace ourselves transformed to more than we! And thereafter in his house shall he alone be Lord and Master; Life shall yield to his dominion; they shall serve who once were proud; We shall go with him together up the pathway fast and faster; We shall see the stars surround us as his eyes dissolve the cloud! We shall see the skies stand open; we shall hear the stars in chorus; From the shining peaks of thought his voice shall answer, pure and high; And the spacious gates of light shall stand asunder full before us; And, as all alone we enter, we shall know the Lord is I! The WOMAN How mystic, mad and possible it seems, How like a clearance of life's tangled skein, To dream, to say, to sing, âI am the Lord!â Poet! you know me better than myself ..... The POET My poems are made of more than all I know ..... A moment of silence. The WOMAN Shall we go farther on?âno matter where, So we go on ..... The POET How the heart melts with song! ..... How the brain reels in the storm-wind of thought! ..... Come, let us go! The light is there ..... The POET and the WOMAN turn and go down the wall, away from the spot where HERAKLES is standing. The two figures seem to disappear in the distance. HERAKLES emerging from the shadow into the moonlit street The light!â There where my dreams discern an excellence Unrealized, which I amâwhither I go! ..... I have but matched the beast with other beasts, The man with other men; and when my strength, Impatient and unused, challenged me on, I have but guessed that haply, with the Gods At strife, God was within me, to defy Their curse and prove their equal and prevail! Now let me learn to say, I am the Lord! Since in the forward vistas of my hope, There is the Lord, the Saviourâthere am I! For thus I am assured my end is not Where the world ends and humble hopes go home; Where men are crowned and beasts are satiated!â Too well I know that I contain them allâ The serpent, wolf and jackal, ape and cur, Lion and hog:âof old the beasts are laired In life's primeval wilderness, the dark, Trackless and devil-haunted waste within me! ..... Yet, in the mind's rapt outlook, I discern That in the jungle is the Householder, Whose patient labour has made room and home And let the light into his dwelling-place! Now, while he sleeps, it may be, in his stead Garrulous ghosts and fauns infest the gloom And in his name accomplish shameful deeds, Shallow and eloquent sincerities, Profession of all faiths that falsify, And threadbare fashions of a masqueradeâ While from the teeming dark they snarl and whine, Chatter and roar and laugh, gibber and grin With greedy eyes and fangsâthe beasts, the beasts Who harbour where his realm is unreclaimed! ..... Yet I believe he shall not sleep alway! Nay, he shall wake and witnessâand suspect Himself is otherwise than all of these! ..... O he shall stake his life upon that vision! And he shall wonderfully at last contrive To bring the outlawed beasts into dominion And hold them captiveâhaving levelled down The dark recesses where they crouched untamed! He shall dispel the spectres, and return The jungle to a fruitful harvest-field!â And thenâO then, after the victory, He shall go forth in power and look abroad Over the spacious acres of the soul, All drowned in azure and tranquillity, Where, all bearing his harness and subdued, The mighty beasts labour and drive afar The ploughshare of his will, and spread the seed, And reap the harvestâand proclaim the Lord In word and deed, and celebrate the Lord! ..... Then shall he know the Lord is I! and feel That ecstasy of knowledge which is truth, Which is religion, which is self and soul! ..... The voice of IOLAUS calling in the near distance Answer me, Lord! ..... Where art thou? ..... Speak to me! ..... IOLAUS appears. Lord, is it thou? ..... HERAKLES He saidâthe Lord is I! End of the Third Scene. FOURTH SCENE Toward midnight of the same night as in the first three scenes. Street before the house of HERAKLES. MEGARA and the THREE SONS OF HERAKLES are in the house. The voice of MEGARA low and sweet from within the house The rose-wreathed lattice opens wide, Beyond, the night is calm and deep;â My little doves lie fast asleep Like lilies fallen side by side. They laid them down at evening; Their eyes were clear as moonlit dew; Across their brows the sunset threw The golden shadow of its wing. HERAKLES and IOLAUS enter slowly. They pause and listen. They kissed my face, with tender words; Their eyelids closed as flowers close; In dreamless, motionless repose They fell asleep like tired birds. HERAKLES Iolaus..... IOLAUS Lord? HERAKLES So Pyrrha in the dark Sang to the children of Deukalion..... So long as there is life it shall not cease, It shall not change, this tender lullaby, This ancient minstrelsy of motherhood. Wherever there is human happiness Or human grief or life's immortal will, The inviolate serenities of night Shall hear the woman singing to her sons, Her little dovesâmy children, Iolaus! Who shall be men, as they shall wake from sleep, Radiant in the morning, and the might Of manhood! ..... The voice of MEGARA as before My children sleep, whose lives fulfil The soul's tranquillity and trust; While clothed in life's immortal dust The patient earth lies dark and still. No rumour rises from the street; The stars in silence dawn and die; The moon goes up the violet sky And treads the sea with silver feet; And calm as inward joy, and deep, Moonlight and starlight flood the room Where close beside me in the gloom Softly my little children sleep. All night they lie against my breast And sleep, whose dream of life begins: Before the time of strife and sins, Of tears and truth, they take their rest. HERAKLES ..... They take their rest! ..... Iolaus! Iolaus! What of the soul? Can you not feelâas I To-night bore witness to you allâthat we, Who seem to wake in the large light of life So sensibly, in pure reality Lie in the shadow of sleep, lie prone and still On the parental breast of life like children, And take our rest?..... IOLAUS Yet we have witness, Lord, Who have so wrought in the substantial world,â Yet we have witness that we wake indeed: Is not Erginus slain, Orchomenos Razed and enslaved, and Heraklesâ HERAKLES Enough!â Not by the world's coarse manifest I am! To me no voice but mine can testify: The violence and the glare of deeds and things Report me in no wise:âmyself alone Proves and reveals myself: no other sign Is there at all of me save only I! Have I not ceaselessly been here and there, Come hither and gone hence, ambitiously And humanly lived out my works and days? Have I not gone abroad seeking the soul In vast and various venture, and returned Weary and without wisdom after all? When have I known myself, who know the world? When have I felt, in trial or victory, The choir, the torch, the festival of truth Gladden the soul's inviolate dwelling-place? ..... Now am I no more eager of many things; Neither am I much curious of proof, Save as some still conviction, secretly Wakes in the inmost mind and justifies New lights, new values, new coherencies, New strengths and virtues up the endless scale. For well I know how anciently and long The massive Sphinx has stood as now it stands, A veiled, portentous shape of shadow and silence, Against the nightfall in the mind's dark highway; And well I know that, anciently as now, To the inscrutable mystery of being There is no voice shall answer save the clear Silences singing in the awakened soul! ..... IOLAUS There is no voice shall answer! ..... Is there more Of man's inheritance than all we know? Are we not merely men who labour and live In the plain light, in the gross world; who rest By night; who fall asleep at last in death; Who feel, invincibly, darkly over us, The harsh dominion of the inconstant Gods? HERAKLES Nay! We are adepts of a mystery! ..... The secret is at handâhow shall we sleep? We are as men in awful expectation Before the threshold of a sanctuary,â Whose eyes grow sometimes clear in the long vigil, Whose hearts grow sometimes mild, till they discern The glamour of a glory on the veil, The murmur of a music thro' the portalâ The secret, incommunicable signs Of the God's radiant presence in his house! The voice of MEGARA as before My little doves, the nest is warmâ Lie close! the dawn shall come too soon. Sleep, in the quiet of the moon! Sleep, in the hollow of my arm! For yesterday is all we are, To-morrow all we yet shall be; The end is where no eye can see..... We only know the way is far! We only know men grow and grieve And die..... And death is strange and sore! O sleep, my darlings, sleep!âbefore The time returns to wakeâto live! A moment of silence. HERAKLES The ancient, patient, perfect love of women! ..... The service and the sacrifice of life To life! ..... But to what end of life? ..... Her voice Is clear and quiet as moonlit well-water In a vessel of shining silver..... This is home! A moment of silence. IOLAUS Let us enter, Lord. HERAKLES I shall not sleep to-night. I know not how it is, there is within me To-night a stern, unquiet intensity, The strangeness of a secret unrevealedâ Almost, it seems, a fear of what I am! ..... I am as some itinerant by night, Ignorant of his purpose and his path, Curious of both, vigilant, fearful, fain, Sleepless and sightless till the dawn is there! ..... I shall not stay or sleep. No more to me The rash and resolute activities Of manhood sound to-night their martial challenge Into the bright arena of the world. I am this hour inviolably alone, And like a stranger in my solitude..... A glitter of far lights is in my brain, And in my heart something that is not hope, And in my life a hushed suspense..... To-night, Beyond the threshold and the fire-light, Beyond the brief, familiar place of being, Held by the narrow candle-flame of life Against the invasive, dark, immense unknown, I am abroad! ..... The heart's unrest is nameless And absolute the mind's uncertainties! Ask me not whither, where or why I go: The spacious night surrounds me, and my spirit Ranges magnificently unappeased! ..... IOLAUS Why must you go abroad seeking a dream When here at home all is so bountiful? Here the King's daughter croons your sons asleep; Here Creon has given over to your hands His kingship by your mighty hands secured; Here in all Greece your name is glorious, Your deeds extolled, your worth proclaimed in praise;â Here your estate is grown so high and splendid That hardly can the range of man's ambition Compass a nobler destiny than yours! HERAKLES So is the range of man's ambition brief And scanted of his true divinity! IOLAUS Why is your speech so strange to-night? HERAKLES 'T is I Am strange! ..... And now I think my heart would break To hear her sing again, to feel once more The tenderness and the tranquillity And sweetness of her love,âthe delicate Freshness of life's warm wonder in my house. Come, let us go!âI shall not rest to-night. IOLAUS Where shall I follow, since you will not sleep? HERAKLES Let us go down into the human city, Iolaus, where men and women with their sins Stray in the festive street; where harp-players And harlots and young men sit in the taverns, And feel, all night until the daybreak stands Pale and relentless in the waking world, Life's wanton weed grow rankly in their souls! Let us go down into the human city And see how men and women love and live, Whose feet go forward to the sepulchre, Whose hearts are sick with tender syllables Unspoken, and desires unsatisfied, And liberalities no heart receives..... Let us go down!âperchance they wait us there, The meaning and the sign!âlet us go down! End of the Fourth Scene. FIFTH SCENE Before dawn of the next day. A street before a tavern. At intervals is heard the sound of music and voices and occasional bursts of laughter from within. HERAKLES and IOLAUS enter. IOLAUS Now nothing more is left to seek or see. Let us return. We have been long abroad; We have been up and down the sleepless city And far afield from where is happiness..... Let us return. HERAKLES Here's still a last, least place Where laughter is, where there is light and wine And song..... IOLAUS And this is last, of all: beyond, The lampless thoroughfare goes far away Into the darkness, past the city wall. Here we are come to the road's end. The earth Lies out beyond, spacious and tranquil, where The moonlight, like the nimbus that surrounds A sage in meditation, quietly And vastly and serenely luminous, Lies, pale as dreams are pale, over the world! ..... Laughter is heard within the tavern. Then there is a moment of silence. HERAKLES Hark! ..... How serene is silence! ..... How austere! .... How spacious! ..... And how small and sad a thing Is laughterâand how sometimes terrible! ..... There is no rumour save the sound of mirth When souls are lost! ..... I know not how it seems To you, but I believe the Minotaur Kept out of sight and sound like a good fellow, And there was laughter in the labyrinth, And it was pleasant for them who were lostâ Lost without hope, nor any vision of hope, Nor any faith to vex them with ambition! Hark! ..... How they laugh and sing and take no heed, The boys, the panders, and the singing-women, The harlot and her ruffian!âAnd ourselves, Iolaus, ourselves, who keep so delicate, Who live so chaste and privateâwho are we, Who fill with rumour as of a festival The public precincts of the House of Life?â Who vex the soul with gilt caparisons And go in power and pride and policy, Panders to profit and the world's applause, About the brilliant business of the world? Are we not of this ribald company, These toilers for the selfsame prize as we, Only of less profession and renownâ These merrymakers in the labyrinth, Who singing sit beside the sallow tapers, Derelict, dispossessed, delinquent,âdead? Why so we are, by God!âking, soldier, priest, Cut-purse and prostituteâin fact the same Poor men and women, all of usâso kin, So far adrift, so dark, so solitary! ..... Then let's within and claim our fellowship! They are of usâand they shall not be denied! IOLAUS Nay, we have seen to-night too much of this. Let us return! The street and the night end. Let us returnâmy heart is sick for home! ..... HERAKLES O we are very far from where is home To that within us which is comfortlessâ The heart that is not patient of our thrift; The soul that is not pleasured as we are In safe, substantial mediocrity! To-night, in street and tavern, anxiously, Like children fatherless and dispossessed, We were come out to seek our heritage; We were come out to seek for more than all Our lives have variously informed us of, And more than all we know!âWhat rest is there, Or where shall we go home, who have not found Ourselves or what is ours? Whither away And in what casement stands the lamp for us Who drift as might a helmless derelict, Errant with wind and tide over dark seas? This shall we hardly learn at last to know; And hardly shall our hearts receive the sign, Our eyes find fire along the forward way, Till that reprieve of freedom, peace and power When we have saved the grain and strawed the chaff With a most jealous fan throughout the ripe Acreage of the spirit's harvest-field! ..... Truly I am not now as once I was, Replete, exultant, proved, resistless, proud, When all the Sons of Cadmus hailed me victor! Rather my joy is quelled of all my deeds; For worth is of myself, and I have none..... Yet do they rate me by no means, whose choice And crown proclaim me Lord! It well may be You doubt me. True, I know not what it meansâ And all is doubt! ..... Yet there is born within me To-night a sense of outcast solitude, The darkness of a flame-rent thunder-cloud, And peril and devastation in my brain,â While in my heart, like devious, distant fire, The thread of hope leads thro' the labyrinth! ..... What is the whole of lifeâwhen dreams come true; When faith is realized; when the mind unlocks The treasure-house of truth; when, loosed and winged, Ambition ceases of itself to be So gross, so measured, so commensurate With possible and perishable things? ..... The voice of the WOMAN singing in the tavern I know not why we drink and feast Unless it be to make us laugh, Who waste the grain and store the chaff, Who starve the God and glut the beast! Yet know I not how wine can make, Of all sad things, a woman smile; For what is wine to so beguile The heart that bleeds and will not break? I know but thisâwe cannot bear The truth that laughter hides so well! ..... And all the damned dead souls in Hell Scream with eternal laughter there! A rumour of voices in the tavern. IOLAUS Poor wanton wretch!âGod pity her! HERAKLES Not so! Bravely she sings her heart out, and in tune, And strictly to the measure of its truth. She knows the cost of some thingsâand their worth! And briefly she has made a song of how Her life is bankrupt for some scraps of tinsel. No God is wise enough to pity her, Nor sad enough! Her tragedy is yours And mine;âO verily this alone is all Life's tragedy, that in the strict account Of truth we findâwhose lives were cheaply sold At the world's price in chaplet, coin or crownâ Such meagre profit, such tremendous loss! And be assured it is not pitiable To sing one's heart out, as she sings, of it: Bravely, and not too sadlyâand in tune! The rumour of voices is renewed in the tavern. Then silence. A pause. The voice of the POET singing in the tavern I know not what it is appears To us so worth the tragic task:â I know beneath his ribald masque Man's sightless face is grey with tears! I know not why it is we dread To lie in death's embrace, alone:â I know that he receives a stone Who asks with all his love for bread! I know not how, I know not why We save the hope that naught fulfils:â I know that life constrains and kills The dying soul that will not die! ..... The rumour of voices breaks out in the tavern, louder than before. HERAKLES Hearken! ..... and hear the voice of human woe, Crying aloud and crude and comfortless! Hark, from the cheated and distempered mind, This harsh and ancient outburst of despair Proclaim we are all perdurable men And perjured souls and hearts that still conserve A pitiable efficiency of pain! Then question of yourself, and you shall find His voice is mine and yoursâif we could sing! In each of us the serpent of despair Sleepsâor is roused and strikes his poisoned fangs Deep in the heart and brain, till one must die, The serpent or the soul,âunless we charm Serpent and soul with song! For song alone Makes tolerable to us the acrid lees, When time and truth have trod life's wine-press out, Which, undiluted, in thought's crystal cup, Are of too cogent anguish to the soul. He charms who is not strong enough to slay! He sings who is not brave enough to know, And in himself feel truth exemplified! Thus, I believe, the tragic poet sings Because he fails to do a better thing: Up from the ruins of his failure starts The phÅnix-bird of song:âhe knows the while How far aloft God's eagle eyes the sun! ..... Had we the will, the strength, the hardihood To let the light inform us utterly, And so transfuse and interchange with all Gross elements that we were born again, Perfect and true;âhad we the stern resolve And power and passion of our sacred cause To bear the pangs of childbirth to the end, And die to live;âin such comparison What were a life's magnificence of song? ..... God is within the soulâand who has been A little toward Him, sings! There is no more To do for one who leaves the best undone..... The poet wakes, indeed,âbut merely sings! Yet therefore is he more than other men; For they come hardly into wakefulness, And briefly, and in terror and great pain, Soon to relapse, latent and lost in sleep..... Are we not all, in silence and alone, Sepulchred living under dreams and dust? ..... And if at last we dreadfully revive, Straitened and gagged in death's caparisons, Within the unspeakable solitude and dense Silence and brutal blackness of the grave, 'T is but to glimpse the shining star of hope With false persuasion of transcendent joyâ And then, as faith's uplifted face dislimns, To die immobile in the narrow night, Our hearts constricted with a frenzied fear Of death's deceit,âwith life's supreme appeal! The poet singsâand lives! And I believe, Should one audacious rebelâeven the soul's Championâwho was not eased with poems, essay His strength against the terror and the tomb, It might be they should wonderfully yield! Yea! till he went his way from us,âperchance To prove the Saviour of us, on his way! A rumour of voices; then loud applause in the tavern. A chorus of MEN and WOMEN singing in the tavern Dionysos! God begot thee, woman bore thee, Dionysos! Now before thee Dance the MÃ¦nads who adore thee, Who are of thy fellowship! Every heart is frenzied for thee, Dionysos! every lip Glisters with the wine we pour thee, Crimson as the sacred stain When the sacrifice is slainâ Dionysos! Wild laughter and applause within the tavern. IOLAUS Let us go hence, go hence! Behold, the night Grows pale and passive as a sick man's face At daybreak as he lies asleep. It dawns. The livid light comes down the dreadful street Timidly as a tired vagrant child, And stand between us here before the tavern, Naked and shivering in its threadbare dress. HERAKLES When shall it be that somewhere in the soul, Beyond our life's horizons, dark with dreams, The Child of Light shall rise from sleep and stand Radiantly in the silent place of peace? ..... When shall it be that he shall venture down The strange, remote, dark thoroughfares of thought, And stand with shining feet before the tavern, Where all night long his servants brawl and feast, In pale and passionless severity? ..... When shall it be his presence shall eclipse The flickering, brief, clandestine candle-light That lust has kindled in the House of Life? ..... When shall he enter by the dolorous door Of love and faith, where death at last comes in, And bind the slaves by his resistless will, Who made his house a place of harlotry And lies and lamentations and vain deeds And vice and violence and vociferation? ..... When shall he rise from sleep and go abroad? ..... We know not whenâyet surely they shall know Who keep his vigil! And, within that hour, At last the slaves' ignoble revelry, Their spectral humours and hilarities Shall shudder and be still!âand they shall learn How little is the Lord indeed from home! And men shall witness and the Gods shall know That he is risenâthe grave and gracious Lord Is risen, and on his way! And they shall see His light go forward, and about his feet The flowers of spiritual trust and truth Wake in the silent meadows deep in dusk Beside the stream-course of the spirit's life! And they shall hear his voice, serene as stars, Strengthen to song, like scattered birds who wake Crying in wet tree-twilights, as with hands Lustrous and loving he dilates the gloom With muffled splendour; while, superbly winged, The deep-eyed virtues of the soul's perfection Rise like essential perfumes, sweet and strong! ..... The voice of the POET singing in the tavern Her eyes were dark as violet; Her face was white as sunburnt sand..... Because we could not understand, Love turned and left us, hand in handâ Her lips surrendered, red and wet! I saw in the dishevelled dress Only her pale, abandoned loveliness! The voice of the WOMAN singing in the tavern He laid his brows against my breast; He kissed my breast with lips of flame; His voice made music of my name; And in the sunless house of shame Between his arms he held me pressed!â He knew not what it was to me, Or what to him, thereafter, love might be! The voice of the POET as before I felt her heart beat hard and high; I saw her eyes grow blurred and blind;â There came a mist across my mind..... Her hair fell round me soft as wind And lustrous as a moonlit sky..... For pleasure of her was my breath Broken, as one who labours near to death! ..... The voice of the WOMAN as before The desolation; the despair; The hope; the love; the will to be Spendthrift of the heart's treasury; The soul's inviolate chastity Were all of me he could not share! He asked no more of love than this; He gave no better than a harlot's kiss! The voice of the POET as before I held her all the dumb night long, And still at daybreak she was there, When, groping thro' the dark, dense air, The dawn's chill fingers touched her bare Pale body, clear and smooth as song! ..... The stealthy light fell, grey as dust, Silently in the sordid place of lust! The voice of the WOMAN as before Love cannot enter by the door Where lust comes fierce and florid in! They play no game that love can win, Who stake the outlawed coins of sin,â Yet love can lose one heart the more! For truth lies deep beneath the lie; And Death has digged no grave where souls can die! The voice of the POET as before And silently I went my way; The heart within me wailed and wept! ..... I would have kissed her as she sleptâ And dared not! Like a thief I crept Scared and alone into the day..... And Love walked on with bleeding feet, Heart-sick beside me in the dreadful street! The voice of the WOMAN as before Quenched is the flame in us whereof Love's sacred lamp is lit; and we Are captives as damned souls must be; And hence from Hell shall none go free Whose lives have lost the key of love!â Who neither asked nor sought nor knocked, To them alone Truth's treasure-house is locked! A confused tumult of voices in the tavern, which gradually subsides until at last there is silence. IOLAUS ..... On broken heartstrings is their music made To hear them laugh and sing I half believe, As you declare, that laughter broke their hearts..... And they have fashioned of all shattered things The phrase of an incomparable grief, And called it songâwhich is indeed a cry Something more strangely sad than any tears. O come with me to the still house of joy!â There is a sorrow in the vacant street, And even the light is like a lamentation..... He pauses. HERAKLES neither speaks nor stirs. My heart is sad and strangeâlet us return! There is a kind of judgment in the lightâ Something austere and chaste and pitiless, Dealing impartial justice to us all..... Let us returnâfor God's sake let us go! I can no longer bear to hear them sing! HERAKLES Harkâthere is silence! Harkâand you shall hear, Vast and inviolate, while they seem to sing, The inveterate silence of the sepulchreâ Where he is lying inert as dead men lie, Who is the deathless holy spirit of manâ Massively overwhelm their melody! There is a sound, a semblance as of song, A quiver of rhythmic motion in the air..... But then and still thereafter there is silence, Strictly distinguished to the inward ear. Harkâand your soul shall hear it as I do! They sing notâneither can they sing at all, Who are as we in bondage to this world! Their music is a shallow counterfeit, The unsubstantial echo of a voice;â Not the phrased splendour of essential song Rumoured along the surface of the soul's Deep seas of elemental harmony! ..... Hearken within yourself! Hearken within, And hear how still, how gaunt and dumb it is! ..... O there is silence, silence in us all! We are some handfuls of gross clay assembled, Wherein there is a tremor and a tone, A pitiable vibration which is song As men rate song in their discordant lives..... And far within is silence!âOtherwise, Otherwise is the full free voice of man, The one true voice, our own voice!âwhen there is No silence by the altar any more; When there, in strength and in tranquillity, The hieratic, consecrated soul Intones its canticle of self-reprieve, And all its powers and liberties proclaim The chaunt of the divine awakening! ..... The tavern door opens. A little crowd of men and women stumble noisily into the street. Among them are the POET and the WOMAN. They all pause uncertainly, staring vaguely about them. A MAN Here's the damned daylight back again..... A HARLOT God's name, How cold it is! The POET As chill and chaste as death! A MAN Let's go back! There's no hospitality And nothing comfortable in all this world Save, there within, the wine and candle-light. The POET Save drunkenness and dark!âIs there not death? Poor ghost! Poor tomb-dweller!âIs there not death? A MAN I would to God there were deathâfor all poets! And silence for all singers, save of some Small mirthful songs of bawdry and pleasant things..... A HARLOT Truth is, Stranger, your songs are keen as pain. A MAN His songs are seriousâand most damnable! Wine brings susceptibilityâand dawn's A desperate hour, when a mere song's grief May tragically rouse the heart to tears And vain misgivings..... A HARLOT As for me, I love To weep when there is music. Give me songs Of noble sentiment. Tears ease the heartâ A MAN No tearful wench for me, nor tearful song! Poets and whining womenâdamn such fools! Gay hearts, gay women, gay good-fellowship, Wine and gay musicâso a man is pleased! The POET Eyes of the deathless Gods, look down, look down! Behold this tragic masque of marionettes! ..... And laugh because we weep, and laugh the more Because we laughâand lie, and dare not live In the confession of reality! A MAN Damn you, be silent! and deliver us Of all your tedious solemnities! Already you have robbed the night of mirth, And now, despite the wine, nothing is left But daylight and despondency..... The WOMAN In truth I'll not believe a poet could so far Vex and subdue your wanton hearts with words. Are you not men of business and affairs, Hard men of worldly practice and the world? And he'sâmerely a voice! and such a voice As you shall hardly hear or understand! Nay, lads, I'll not believe you're out of tune With laughter for a song's worth of strange words! Even a poor wench can laugh!âThe end of mirth Comes only when the cheerless heart is cracked And the frail spark of life flutters and fails! ..... The POET ..... Comes only when we learn there is more hope Than life can give; more truth than words can say! A HARLOT Enough! It's bitter cold here in the dawn, And I'll no longer wait and freeze and tire To hear you snarl and curse at one another!â Let's all to bed! A MAN The wench is rightâlet's go! They all start off and move, in a straggling group, toward HERAKLES and IOLAUS, whose forms are hardly distinguishable in the grey twilight. Suddenly one of the women halts. A HARLOT There are strangers hereâyonder! A MAN Two men..... Calling Who's there? HERAKLES takes a step forward. A moment of silence. A MAN Your pardon! ..... If a man may question you, My Lord, and since we chance to meetâwho are you? A moment of silence. HERAKLES scans the faces before him almost anxiously. HERAKLES I am a man who seeksâand has not found; Who asksâand is not answered; who has knocked Yet none has opened to him the secret door. Do you bring newsâand welcomeâand the alms? The WOMAN separates herself from the group and draws nearer to HERAKLES. A HARLOT What says he? A MAN I can hardly tell..... A MAN He seems In some delusionâ The POET Then perhaps he's drunk!â Are we not all at dawn a little drunk? The WOMAN Be still! ..... The POET What now? Why do you stare and stare? ..... I say his wine has been to many a man Persuasion of delirious things and words, And specious dreams of what It's all about..... The WOMAN Be still! Look in his eyes! ..... The POET to HERAKLES Your pardon, Sir! The wench has drunk her shareâ He turns to the WOMAN. The sight of her thrills and startles him. His whole mood and manner change. He draws close to her and speaks to her alone. Tell me the news: Is it the Secret?âSpeak! The WOMAN speaking as tho' entranced ..... There is within His eyes a candid infancy of lightâ A birth of splendourâand a mystery! A vigilâand a voice!âthe light that leads, Convinces and absolvesâlike sunlight! Far, Far in his eyes it dawns! ..... I seem to see So far withinâso far! His eyes are like Some sudden window, opening in the night..... Thence may the soul stare skywardâto the stars! Look in his eyes, if you have will to see! All other eyes of men are closed and dark. Look in his eyes!âO, God's within, I know! There, in the utmost distance, there is God! ..... There is the light of God, splendid and strange! ..... HERAKLES with passion Are you the herald and the messenger? The POET Herald of hope and messenger of news! ..... HERAKLES heedless of all save the WOMAN Is there indeed light in the windowâlight To prove the Lord is in his house and wakes, Who has slept overlong? You say the light Is lit, the sign is there to show he wakes At lastâand feels across his solemn brows The rose-winged wind of venture and vast skies, And in the chamber where he darkly slept, Gradual and pale, the calm, sane light of dawn? ..... The WOMAN Yours is the sign! You are the light! HERAKLES At last! ..... How I have sought you! O is it you indeed? And do you bring me news at last and welcomeâ News of myself and welcome to the Lord? O can I rest assured that even now The Lord wakes in his chamber silently, And like a stranger and athirst for love, And all aflame to know and to be known? ..... Know you indeed the Lord? and is he there, The one true perfect friend, who is most friendless;â The matchless lover, whose love none receives, And who is loved of none? Look in my eyes! Tell me the light is thereâthat I am He! ..... The WOMAN .... You are the strength, the light, the life,âthe Lord! What shall I do that I may love you? The POET Speak! Have you the strength? Have you the lightâthe life? HERAKLES speaking to the WOMAN alone Only believe and all shall yet be well! Love and believe! I have no more than faith To guide me, and no more to comfort me Than love,âand mine is still the greater need! Mine is the greater need, for mine, at last, Mine is the greater strength! The strength is thereâ The secret strength I almost fear to feel! Measureless is the strength and mercilessâ And like a child whose eyes are vague with sleep, Haunted with dreams and dazed with real light;â Whose mind, with dark pre-natal memories, Is still perplexed, and hardly yet evolved From ancient error and the brutal grasp Of fear, force, falsehood, destiny, and death;â Who is not yet self-realized, self-assured, Conscious and calm in thought, in aim, in will. Yet, as I must believe, do you believe, And all shall come to pass, and all be well! ..... The WOMAN I love and I believe! I see the light; I feel the strength that will not stay or spare; I know the Lord; I know that he shall come To bring me the good news! HERAKLES O be assured Of victory! I love you! I shall come Again to you ..... Be faithful till I come! A MAN What do they say? A HARLOT He bids her âBe thou faithful Until I come!â All laugh except HERAKLES, the WOMAN, and the POET, who remain thrilled, startled, and absorbed. The POET I scarce believeâand yet He spoke as one having authority, Having the truth's commandment clear as light And blind as light and undissuadable;â Being in strength creative as a God! How shall I know? ..... The WOMAN conscious only of HERAKLES You will not leave meânow? HERAKLES I leave with you one who is more than Iâ Even the soulâeven the Spirit of Truth! ..... He shall be with you always to the end, Who is the guide, the way, the comforter! I may not rest: I love you and must go. He shall bear witness in my stead. At last I shall return:âand let there be a light, His light undimmed to guide me to his house! Be faithfulâlest he fall again on sleep! The WOMAN I cannot leave you! Lord, I will not stay Where you are not!âYou are the way, the life; You are the truth! HERAKLES I shall perchance be true At last and perfect! ..... Now, there is within me Labour and violence, ruin and redemption. My soul is an invaded citadel, A precinct where contending armies wait, Fierce and resolved,âthe death-grip is still toward! ..... And if I win at all it shall be hard! This very hour all is in jeopardy:â The dark whirls in my vision even now; And like the rumour of resurgent tides I hear the ancient curse of error cry Up well-worn estuaries of the shaken mind! ..... Suddenly voices are heard crying in the distance, and a confused rumour as of some great commotion in the city. IOLAUS Lord!âdo you hear? Some mischief is afoot! The city cries as with a single voice!â What can it be? Some great event has chanced..... I'll find the cause of this and come again. IOLAUS hastens away. HERAKLES ..... What great event concerns me save the soul? And none cry in the Agora because The soul of man at last comes to its own! Again from the city rises a vast rumour of voices. Hark! ..... In my heart I hear their cries resound! They are my soldiers and my people! Hark! ..... There in this hour my plumed battalions wait Their leader, and my citizens their King. They know not and they will not understand Whither away I am gone on so far Without them,âI, who shall not now return! ..... The die is cast, and, come what may, I take The bounty of ambitious destinies To be my birthright, nor shall Gods or men Force and delude me from my utmost goal! Again is heard the voice of a distant multitude. The POET How they cry out upon us,âall the world! HERAKLES ..... Crying in vain!âO let me stay no more! For still my heart, to hear the voice of the worldâ My world of youth and conquest and renownâ Crying upon me, suffers and is not strong, As the great heart of perfect love must be! O, lest the good great moment, lest the vision, Lest the redemption, now at last begun, Suffer some wrong by reason of the heart's Weakness and all my life's remembered joys, Let me go forth away from them, away From all that was and is, to what shall beâ Which, in this primal morning of the soul, Thro' widening gateways of deliverance, With endless promise cheers the forward way! ..... The WOMAN Suffer me, and constrain me not to be Without you! There is place for me to follow Where you may go..... HERAKLES There are no followers Nor captains on the soul's eternal quest! The POET Yet, if the torch go forward in your hand, Shall not its splendour serve to guide us on? Well may we question, who have sought so long, Where you will go and whither is the way. HERAKLES Mine is my way and yours must be your own. Ask me no more, nor wonder if my words Are strict and sternâ The POET I know the truth is hard, Neither compassionate of any grief Or hope or weakness or imperfect joys. But to that soul which bears the truth, in chief, Truth is relentless! And I say to you That if you have not now already paid Abundantly the incalculable cost, Then you shall pay even to the uttermost! HERAKLES What is the price of truth? The POET What is the truth?â There is the question! HERAKLES He shall answer it, And only he who earns the right to say, âI am the Truth!ââfor he alone is true. I stand in the beginning, and the way Is hardly to be seen before my feet, Which they must tread wherever it may go! ..... Ask me no questions, therefore, of the end. The WOMAN I am not curious, and I have no thought Of mercy, and I have no other way Than your way, Lord! ..... HERAKLES O sacred human heart! Come with me if you will, as best you may. You are my witness how the sepulchre Was rent and in his shroud the Sleeper stirred; And how the prison door stood wide ajar While momently, at least, lay out in light The prospect of the soul's prosperities!â You are my witness, and my heart wills well That you, O Heart of faith! should share with me Truth's gospel and the soul's new testament;â Till, at the last, the Sleeper's dreams are done, And he is waked and risen and on his way! ..... IOLAUS appears, coming in great haste. IOLAUS Lord! Lord! ..... I bring you newsâ HERAKLES Who brings me news Is welcome, if his news be news indeed!â You all who have been with me in this hour, You know how rashly I am hazarded, As yet with no least knowledge of the way, Into the free, far spaces of the soul! I go because the wind is in my sailsâ But chartless, helmless, on a shadowed sea;â And haply I shall find the fabulous Fair Paradise of truth, and hand in hand With the grave Gods walk perfectly at last! ..... And haply I may shipwreck on the shores Of circumstance and dark necessities! ..... Only the strength within me is assured,â The strength of Herakles! All else is doubt ..... And O my spirit is fain of news! IOLAUS The King Demands your presence in the Agora. A MAN to his companions The King? ..... He said the King! A HARLOT in an awed voice What man is this? HERAKLES The King?âNo public cares concern me now. What will the King with me? IOLAUS I know but this: An embassy comes hither from Eurystheus, Sovereign of Argos. Heedless of the King, They will not speak at his command; instead They say their message is alone for you. HERAKLES Go on before me, I will shortly come; Leave me, for I have need to be alone. The WOMAN Lord..... HERAKLES For a little, leave me, I will come. This much is certain, that I will be free! And therefore I will come to bid farewell To rank and power and every servitude. I will not heed the cost of what may bring Deliverance. Leave me! I will shortly comeâ And find you there where the world waits for me! ..... After a moment of hesitation they all depart: the POET first, then the WOMAN and IOLAUS; lastly the little crowd from the tavern. As these last are leaving they pause a moment to look at HERAKLES. A MAN My Lord, forgive me if I question youâ What is your name? HERAKLES Men call me Herakles. The men and women depart, leaving HERAKLES alone. End of the Fifth Scene. SIXTH SCENE This scene immediately follows the preceding in time. The sun is only just risen. Thebes. Before the house of HERAKLES. MEGARA stands upon the threshold of the open door. MEGARA The golden wings of light beat up the sky; The stars are set; the dew-fall and the dawn Are everywhere, quiet as benediction; The earth's fresh perfumes, like an incense, rise Into the windless, universal air; And even the old, blank city ways are still And flushed like pathways in love's paradise..... It is morning!âand my lover is not come! A pause. MEGARA sings. She waited in the bride-chamber; Her face was young and clear as light; Her lips were sensuous and bright;â The Bridegroom came not unto her. She kept fresh flowers in the room; Her eyes were spacious as the sea; And thro' the open casement she Kept vigil till her Lord should come. She saw the stars go up the sky; The sunlight and the moonlight were Like crowns and chaplets in her hair;â She would not break her faith to die. She set a signal in the day; She set a beacon in the night; The guarded flame of love burned white And single in her heart alway. She waited in the bride-chamber: Her hair was soft as sleep; her breast Was tranquil, like a place of rest..... The Bridegroom came not unto her. âHis heart,â she said, âis here at home; His love, I know, abides with me; And he would choose his bride to be Prepared and perfect should he come.â She waited in the lonely years; The bride-chamber was all her room; She dreamed not of another doom; She had no thought or time for tears. And when the Bridegroom came at last And found his Bride serene and strong, He said, âBeloved, I tarried long, But now despair and doubt are passed.â She said, âI know not what you mean; I have no part with suffering Or grief or fear; a better thing Life cannot be than mine has been! For I have lived with Truth and Love, And all my life was beautiful And strong and fortunate and full And great and good and glad thereof!â A pause. Friendless he seemedâinimical and strange And splendid, when his angered strength cast down The diadem and scorned the pride of kings! Yet wherefore were his rapture and his rage? Why was he so tremendous and estranged And resolute last night against us all? Where is he nowâand when shall he return..... My heart is like a place of desolation, And like a lost child in a woful place; The jealous depths of love are calm no more, After last night, but shaken and dismayed..... I would to God he were come home to me! She pauses to gaze about her and then returns slowly into the house. A moment after, HERAKLES appears. HERAKLES O bland and tranquil human habitation, Fortunate house of happiness and love, Where love is life and life is love, where truth Is very tender and exquisite as song, And where the meaning of the Mystery Is simply and ineffably revealed!â O treasure-house of kind and serious joys, Hushed, holy house of peace, my house, my home!â I know not in my heart what nameless fear Afflicts me as mine eyes behold you now! Is it perhaps the dread that hence from you Lies the new promise of the forward way, And hence the issue, and the sunrise hence? Yet, in the clear accounting of all things, I have no guess what voyage of the soul Could take me hence from you, O tranquil house!â O mother of my children, O my sons,â My little sons, so fair and young,âfrom you! Is not the best of being here at home?â The candour and the loveliness of life; Beauty and innocence of days; and all The wise, warm, ancient virtues of the heart, And all the peace of the prodigious soul? ..... O Well-beloved, the whole heart's yield of flowers Perfumes the quiet chambers where you sleep! ..... My love is with you, and my dearest thought Is of you, and where you are there am I In spirit and in love! ..... I will not fear! This is the loveliest and most bountiful Of all good fortune of man's mortal life: Surely it shall not for the truth's sake pass Out of the sum of real prosperities! Rather my loved ones and my love shall share, Always with me and to whatever end, The days and ways of the enfranchised soul! A moment's pause. Then he calls: Megara! MEGARA appears in the doorway. MEGARA Herakles!âat last! at last! She runs forward to greet him. My loveâmy dear, dear loveâat last come home! HERAKLES Is not my whole heart always here at home? MEGARA O welcome, welcome!âAs it was with me When I first loved you, so it is to-day! You come to me as after many days, After long, anxious, heart-sick days of doubt..... My heart was like a house of mourning: now There is rejoicing and the sound of song, The light of festival!âThe Well-beloved Returns at last, the Bridegroom is at hand! HERAKLES O come into my arms! I seem to feel Beat in your breast the strong and simple heart, The faithful and inveterate heart of life, Which animates with the bright blood of being The diverse fruit of earth's vast pregnancies! ..... They embrace. A slight pause. Where are my sons? MEGARA They hardly wake from sleep. One called you in the night, speaking your name. HERAKLES My children! ..... And my Love! O Megara, Say that you love me always to the end! MEGARA I love you to whatever end may come, Ever and always and without reprieve! HERAKLES Then, and in silence, hear me to the last. I know how little truth is speakable; And I shall hardly find, for all my pains, Language sufficient to express the soul;â Yet it may be your love shall understand!â Last night you saw me and you heard me speak. Wonder no more because I cast away The crown!âfor even last night I was assured That in the compass of the soul's ambition, In the resources of man's utmost strength, In the dim, secret treasure-house of thought, There were perfections more supreme, desires More absolute, achievements more divine, Than any that the world is witness of! ..... Then did I blindly wreak my inmost will, And had no understanding of my deeds. But in the dawn,âO, in the morning,âthen I found the very truth, as in a vision!â The light!âand I was plainly justified, And perfectly; for this is truth's first lesson, And easiest, and least of price,âthat all Business and pleasure and preferment, fame And government and grandeurs of this world Are but the toys with which the mind of man Beguiles the leisures of its infancy. Who knows the mind's austere maturities, The heart's full-grown intensities;âwho sees The treasures of the Spirit, fabulous Beyond imagination;âI believe Naught else, to him, is profitable at allâ No triumphs, glories, kingdoms, amplitudes Of fortune, pleasures, majesties, dominions! I am but newly waked into the light; My way begins,âmy way, my hope, my hazard. For truly I have found myself at last, And in myself a promise more supreme And an inheritance more bountiful Than thought can understand or faith believe! ..... Self-mastered to some purpose more than mine, In the first morning, with the soul's first-fruits I come to you!âO brave wise heart of love, Surely you shall not fear to share with me The best, hereafter, and the best alone: Love, labour, and the fierce incertitudes! ..... MEGARA Hardly I guess the meaning of your words. And well it may be that in spite of all I shall not understand even at last..... Yet take meâkeep meâlead me to your light! My sons and you and I,âwe are one life, One love, one being,ânaught shall make us twain! HERAKLES I also know not what my words may mean..... I know not what the price of truth may be, Or what the cost of man's perfection is To man, or how the soul is satisfied. I know but this: that ever and evermore I shall not rest! ..... O it may come to pass That if you love me you shall die of itâ As who shall not before the Journey's end? For thus we die to live perpetually! ..... And even it well may be, for all I know, That only in exceeding bitter sorrow Are we so slain and sacrificed and saved!â That all with heavy labour and cruel cost The soul must reap in life's neglected fields The living bread, and in untended vineyards Press from ripe fruit the consecrated wine, Which are its livelihood. Who knows how hard The truth's divine imperatives shall prove? Courage, strong heart! Be sure there is no more That must be done than man at best can do! And if you find yourself, as well you may, Best in the strong sublimity of love,â O then come with me to the perfect end! ..... MEGARA What have I else in all my life to do?â Your spirit is my strength, your heart my refuge! HERAKLES Megara! ..... O it may be we shall win, And come into the heritage! At least We shall go on in the fair-way till death, Serious and stedfast and supremely one! The SONS OF HERAKLES appear in the doorway of the house. MEGARA ..... In the fair-way till death! HERAKLES My Love! He perceives his children, who issue from the doorway. My sons! HERAKLES tenderly embraces the children. A MESSENGER appears. The MESSENGER Herakles!âLord!âThe envoys of Eurystheus, Sovereign of Argos, stand before the Kingâ HERAKLES Why are you come to me? The MESSENGER They will not speak Their master's message save alone to you. Therefore the summons of the King is sent To bid you straightway to the Agora. HERAKLES The Agora! ..... Liberty is beyond! ..... Thro' and beyond my path of freedom leads. He turns to MEGARA and the children. Come, Well-belovedâlet us go down together. For they must take farewell of the rank world Who walk their own ways into Paradise! ..... End of the Sixth Scene. SEVENTH SCENE Early morning. The beginning of this scene and the preceding scene are contemporaneous. Thebes. The Agora. In the Agora are CREON and ALCMENA, seated and surrounded by a body of soldiers. Immediately before the King stands AMPHITRYON; at some distance beyond stand the MESSENGERS OF EURYSTHEUS, three in number. The rest of the Agora is filled by a vast concourse of people. AMPHITRYON They come safe-guarded as Ambassadors, As envoys of Eurystheusâto my son. ALCMENA To Herakles..... AMPHITRYON With insolence and pride They dare recall our kinship and proclaim Herakles subject of the Argive King; Yet sworn to silence save to him they seek, By no persuasions will their lips disclose The serious purpose of their embassage. AMPHITRYON seats himself beside the King. CREON These are strange tidings; and the veil that masques The face of destiny seems dark indeed..... AMPHITRYON I fear their silence and their proud reserve. What can their message be to Herakles? CREON What to their message shall your son reply? Not in the vulgar press of circumstance Is fate concealed, but in the soul of man! And we have seen, last night, into the soul Of Herakles enough, at least, to make The question poignant and the doubt supreme! ALCMENA Last night! ..... I thought a stranger stood before me Clothed in the likeness of my son..... To-day I dare not guess what dark catastrophe The Gods prepare to try his secret strength, To thwart his undivined, misguided will! CREON I fear no secret message, nor the stroke Of adverse fortune, nor the coward heart Or evil purpose of Eurystheus' hate, Nor dark catastrophe;âI fear the man Who struck the crown of kingship from his brows And gave us earnest of the soul's ambition! Man fashions fate after his own design; And in his likeness, as a mirror is, The face of life is featured and expressed; And he deciphers on a vacant page His sense, his story, his significance. Who can predict what Herakles shall see When he lays bare the future's shrouded face? Who can foretell what sense his soul shall find, What stately meaning, what majestic myth, Inscribed on life's familiar palimpsest? ALCMENA He is beyond recognizance! ..... My love's Maternal arms feel vacant of my son! CREON ..... I have played the game out to its mean mild end, And won the world's prize, in a certain measure. Now, being quit with fortune and grown old, I am no longer partisan,âas needs Man must be when his stake is in the game,â But, disabused of life's persuasions, which O'erbalance justice in its own defence, I sit apart in the clear empty light Of wisdom, as in some pale aftermath, And grow, in justice and serenity, Clearly and patiently contemplative. Therefore I find for this emergency Some thoughts which come not all inaptly in To help our understanding of the man Who yesternight was strange unto us all. For I have lately, in the liberal years, Foregone the lore of cheap philosophies Which find an ultimate identity In all the souls and destinies of men. Crowds are but numbers; and at last I see There are not merely players of the game; There is not, high or low, only the one Sensible and substantial prize to which The fiat of the world gives currency,â And which, in various ways, is always won! There is besides the one, estranged, rare man, Whose light of life is splendid in the soul, Burns with a kind of glory in his strength, And gives such special grandeur to ambition, That he will make no terms with fortune, nor Play for whatever prize the game affords. He thinks to vanquish destiny, enforce The Gods, and, by transcendent strength and toil, Earnâwhat alone of all things must be earnedâ The soul's prizeâwhich is always just the soul!â The soul, self-mastered, self-assured, self-known, God-like! and with the deathless Gods co-heir Of truth's ineffable eternities;â The soul, despised, neglected and concealed,â And yet, in truth, as in his raptured mind, Perhaps the great prizeâwhich is always lost! And therefore, wisdom says, no prize at all! But merely, for the common use of life, A fatal lure, a frenzied hope, a dream And madness of imaginative minds..... So is the world's work justified! And last, Now, when the game of life is playedâand lost,â Lost in the main, yet somehow hurried through To the calm, threadbare, tolerable end,â The humour of the thing comes quietly home, As we discern how wise we were to take The loss for grantedâand enjoy the game! We learn our weakness; learn to thank the Gods That we were weak and had no prospect of The prize, no lonely and supreme ambitions; Learn, at the last, on what fantastic terms Life is a conflict, since in fate's despite All men may yet prove victorâsave the strong! The irony, to man's maturer mind, Sorts with his ancient pleasant sense of things. He marks the stress of gross necessities, Immedicable and unalterable, Which shape the trifling destinies of man; He finds an average of circumstance, Equal to all men in the true last test; He learns how much, by temperance and fear, The weak men of the world persuade the Gods; And smiling with a mild and undeceived Despair, he sees the strong men of the soul Enforce the times to their discomfiture, And, of the primal stuff of circumstance, With which the long life of a common man Is very comfortably compromised, Contrive their stately and remorseless ruin! Yes! ..... he discerns, beyond his private fault And failure,âwhen the game is played, and lost,â Where thought turns sick and dizzy and dismayed On the black borders of its own abyss,â How all men living are not ever free, But straitly prisoned in the Mystery, Burdened beneath the universal strength, Merged in the flux of dark infinities..... Which are the Gods!âin whose relentless grasp The strong man strives and strangles and is slain. Then, to his humour, men resemble most Dull creatures who live down at the dense, dark, Fathomless, dumb foundations of the sea,â Who, if they are not pliant, and too weak, Too yielding to resist, are broken and burst, Crushed out of life under the passionless, Insuperable weight of the element In which they live and move and have their being. Are we not justly, then, and terribly Enoughâhowever much we see the joke!â Cautioned to bear with wise humility The utmost rigours of unyielding chance, And meet the serious issues of the soul As I have doneâwith a mild gayety, An unambitious mind and a lax will! So may we prosper to some worldly end; So may we gain assured maturities And aptitudes for a well-ordered life; So, in the lesson of many years, at last, We earn some sense of what the Gods can do, At best or worst, to ruin or redeem. And therefore, by the witness of his words Last night, I find our Herakles imperilled Not by the Gods but by himself alone!â For the strong man no calculus computes, No reason reckons, no arithmetic Demonstrates or foresees by any means. Only we know there is no mortal peril So dire, so desperate as to be strong! AMPHITRYON You are the King! and may, by word and deed, Give aid and counsel to my son. CREON Alas! ..... Who is a King to counsel or advise, To help or hinder, if a man's free will Furthers and guides and justifies his being? The strong receive no help as they are strong; They spare notâand they are not ever spared By Gods or men; the counsel of the wise, The tender tears of love's solicitude, Cannot deter them or persuade them home! Alas! Strength is a hazard none may share, A genius none may caution or advise. The strong man and the humble man are twain By the one real division of men's lives And destinies: there a great gulf is fixed, A dark abyss no rainbow-bridge can span, Between life's level places of brief hopes, Familiar ways, and measurable ends, And the starred skies of thought's imagination. To you my kingship seems a proper prize For life's fulfilment;âbut last night we learned How the ambitious soul scorns to deserve Life's facile, fortunate prosperities. I think to such a one the purpose of His will, the strength that marks his isolation, Are to him as a passionâas a vision Of truth, which gives his strange soul liberty To flame its furtherance thro' the wise world! ..... Vainly for his advantage we discern How, soon or late, with ancient irony, The wise world, sitting at the spectacle, Hails his surrender or his helpless ruin. For when the mad light dawns, the waking soul Endures no lesson save its own, receives No truth save what itself exemplifies! Suddenly the POET and the WOMAN appear in the open space before CREON. They are so self-absorbed that they seem unconscious of the world about them. The POET My heart is nervous like a place of peril..... The WOMAN My heart is quiet like a place of peace. I see the light; I know he is the Lord. The POET Faintly I feel the promise of the Dawn Pale on the prison windows of the soul; And I believe, secluded in his strength, Dazed in his light, it well may be the Lord Is waking in the house of Herakles! ..... Whose faith shall perfectly shine out to help My unbelief? ..... Whose witness is at hand To certify the Truth and prove the Lord? ..... He looks about him and realizes where he is. This is the Agora..... The Kingâthe worldâ The envoys of Eurystheusâall are here! And we are here, who keep his vigil!âand Hither, at last, the man shall grandly come! ..... CREON Stranger, be welcome! By your chance strange words I dare surmise you come from Herakles? The POET turns and faces CREON. The POET After a moment's silence O King!âyou, who are old; whose eyes have seen, Borne on the shoulders of subjected men, The little pageant of the world go by, Pontifical and proud, with Gods and gold And bright caparisons of victoryâ And nothing come of it!âwhose ears have heard, Beyond the high, hard music of the march, Beyond the chorus and the canticles, The strange, strained sob of the great human heart, Crushed and subdued against the iron breast Of life's obscure, supreme necessities,â The wailing and the bitter, broken cry Of souls disconsolate and lives foredoomed To ruin and intolerable wrong From Gods and menâand nothing come of it!â You, who may haply, in your whole long life, Once and at last have dreadfully discerned The infinite, inscrutable darkness Bounding the narrow precincts of the mind, And the old, awful taciturnities, Against whose smooth, impenetrable walls The shouting and the singing voice of life Shatter and die and are not heard beyondâ And nothing come of it!âO you, whose mind Is wise with the long audience and vigil Your life has beenâand nothing come of it!â What is your faith, and what shall be my hope Of Herakles? Is it the very light Of truth, the very strength of the soul's cause, This woman has discerned radiant in him? Is he the very guide our souls have sought Out of the labyrinth? Is he the Saviour?â Give me your faith, for I am sick with doubt..... Are not the dire, dark Gods, the bitter Gods, Ranged, leagued and armoured with the common world Of crowds and Kings to work the man's undoing? Well I discern where the blind, brutal hand Of fortune stretches at him from the shadow..... And soon the stroke shall fall! ..... Is it too soon? Speak!âcan he bear the blow? and is he yet Full-grown in strength, and, like a God, become Invulnerable?âor must he yield at last? Or die far on the frontiers, overwhelmed? ..... Speak! Speak! My spirit is irresolute, Swift and unstable as a wind-swept flame! Give me your faith; the crucial hour is near; He comes! He comes!âand wilful of his cause, Here shall the soul take issue with the world! CREON After a slight pause; in his most temperate tones Stranger, be welcome none the less because You tax the patience of philosophy, And vex a man whose age and whose estate Give him some reason for the world's regard. Patience may suffer; but my sole concern Is with the perfect humour of the thing; And since you variously enhance the joke, Be gladly welcome! I discern in you That taint of a poetic eloquence, Which is perhaps the fashion of your youth, And therefore to be leniently endured, Yet gives a special tinge of irony To the reflective mind which hears you speak. Believe me, you might well be rid of it, And of your flourish and intemperance Of fancy, which the sane sense wearies of. Whatever hazard of man's life is toward, The facts are still sufficient to the end In sight,âand ends invisible are just Mere myth! That you impute to me a faith, And, for yourself, indulge some fervent hope In what vague ventures of the frenzied mind No soothsayer of dreams can clearly tell, Charms meâas youth will charm us!âbut we find A smile to vex down such extravagance! Alas! we have some serious cause to fear That the unhappy mind of Herakles Is raptured and estrangedâresolved to take Some final issues with the Gods and men. But we have seen, what you at last may learn, How such pretensions of the spirit fail,â Whose victory, I take it, is your hope. Life, like a candle in a starless night, Brightens and burns, or flutters and is spent, As man's wise weakness spares the guarded flame, Or man's rash strength resolves in all despite To lift his torch into the spacious winds, To blaze his path across the darknesses, And force the elements to his own undoing..... Only the strong go forwardâand are slain! Only the strong, defenceless, dareâand die! Only the strong, free, fain and fearless,âfail! Remember this! lest a worse thing than mere Passion and ecstasy of poems befall you. The POET Old man, old vain mild phantom of a man!â These many years there is no phrase of all Your cowardly smooth wit, no attitude Of yours I have not learned and wearied of! Poor ancient, philosophic humourist! I know you as you pitiably are: Wise as the world is wise,âand ignorant As only the dull, blatant world can be! Tell me your lies no more, your clever lies! Is there a man so dull he has not felt The countless soldiery of circumstance Charge down out of the dark against us all? Is there a man so blind he has not seen How fearfully the timid citizens Of the wise world that you are master of Armour their nakedness against the foe? Is there a man so false he has not learned How all in vain men dress against the shafts Of truth their shadow-shields, and all in vain Shape for their lives' defence the seeming gold Of faith, the shallow silver of a sane Philosophy,âto fit the cultured mind!â The dull, stern bronze of patient hardihood, Or any base alloy or mean deceit Of weakness and respectability,â However tried and tempered in the forge Of the remembered usage of the world, Fed with felled branches from the tree of time? Is there a man so false and blind and dull He does not know how all confinements yield, All fashions of defence are overborne, When the real truth's Redeemer is at hand,â When, midst the very ruins of the House Of Fear, the mighty soul finds place and room? ..... In the great game where each man's stake is set, They only lose who dare not ever play For the one prize that is not counterfeitâ And they must always lose! Only the strong Go forwardâand are saved! Only the strong, Restless, defenceless, and companionless, Dareâand supremely live! Only the strong, Free, fearless, all-ambitious,âby so much Come to the soul's sublime inheritance! I asked no stale philosophy like yours, Safe and sententious; and I am not apt To take your dreadful humour,âwhich to me Seems like the simper on a dead man's face! Out of my soul's unrest I cried to you! Out of my weakness and my heart's desire I cried for faith, to you who had it not!â For faith that here at last, come to his own, Is the true, brave, divine, enfranchised man! ..... I seek my saviour! I am nothing more Than a great voice crying upon his name, Shouting his welcome,âfor he surely comes! My poems are the pure pÃ¦an of his adventâ And well I know he sleeps within myself! Still, tho' I call him with a constant voice, And, standing heart-sick in the twilight, fill His glimmering casement with free flights of song, He wakes not yet for all that I can do! ..... Therefore, O therefore is my hope alive For the true man in whom the saviour wakes, Who is my equal,âwho is more than I! ..... Till, at his touch, the golden gates of light Sunder!âtill, suddenly, the pregnant soul Wakes in the pangs of God's nativity! ..... CREON Poor mad, mazed, dream-bedevilled, frenzied fool!â 'T is well my anger is no longer rashâ The POET Mad to your sense I may be,âmad almost As God is mad to those who know Him not! ..... Turning to the WOMAN Woman, O Woman! what shall be my hope? Would that my faith were perfect! Overlong My heart has fed with blood the sacred flame; Mine eyes have kept the consecrated vigil;â And almost seemed magnificently at last To witness to the coming of the Lord! ..... O might the tranquil eyes of wisdom read Into the powers and prospects of the soul A larger sense of what is possible Than I have seenâand help my unbelief! The voices of a great multitude sound, crying out in the distance. The VOICES Herakles! Herakles! The POET At last he comes! CREON Comes to relieve our small suspense, to end The prologue and enact theâcomedy! The POET moving swiftly to a position close beside the throne of CREON and addressing him with an earnest intensity Old man, forego your childish pleasantries! Your cap and bells ring sadly out of tune Amid the solemn and celestial choirs Which sound across their clear antiphonies, Now as the Heroâand, it well may be, The Saviourâyea! the truth's Redeemer comes! Put by your mannered, threadbare attitude; Put by your trifling wisdom of the world; Witness and understand! Your eyes and brain May well be clear,âfor age wears out the world In man's regard, like some embroidered silk Worn threadbare in the gradual waste of time, And leaves a calm, transparent vacancy, As of pale light over a hueless sea. Watch! and it may be you shall read the news And see into the secret! ..... The VOICES nearer than before Herakles! Herakles! Herakles! The POET He comes!âO King, He is that man from whose resplendent eyes, But lately, to the woman who had faith, The light of Gods shone out like a strange dawn! ..... The VOICES always nearer Herakles! Herakles! The POET Behold him well! IâI have seen his strength, and half-believed That he is of the few indomitable Whom the Gods hardly bring into dominion By any means!âtill I have seemed to hear Sound in my soul the trumpets of his triumph! ..... The VOICES close at hand Herakles! Herakles! The POET He is at hand! ..... The Bridegroom comes! ..... O Heart! O Paranymph! Let the sealed gates of love stand wide asunder, And all the bounds of faith perish away! And let the winged soul, from its lonely skies, Cry out in joy, claiming the victory! Amid a great roar of welcome from the people and the soldiers, HERAKLES appears in the open space before the King. He is accompanied by MEGARA and his Children, and followed by IOLAUS. He confronts the King and the cheering multitude in silence. Gradually the tumult subsides. Meanwhile the MESSENGERS OF EURYSTHEUS draw near the throne of CREON. AMPHITRYON Welcome, my son! CREON Thrice welcome, Herakles! Messengers are come hither from the King Of Argos, and will speak alone to you. HERAKLES It will not help that I should hear them now. I have renounced all profits and concerns And servitudes of proud and politic men; For, in the strong fulfilment of my vision, I am resolved hereafter to be free! Therefore the envoys of Eurystheus Now may depart in silence: I no more Regard them, and I will not hear them now. I must be diligent about my business, Which brooks no more delay!âAnd know you well, If you behold me now it is because I have one thing in all the world, one thing To all the world, and only one, to say: Farewell! Rumour among the people and soldiers. The King and those about him listen with anxious concern. My heart, this one, brief, utmost time, Returns to where it once went proudly home And daily dwelt,âknowing no better place, No more majestic mansion of desire, No costlier love,âto bid you all farewell! Farewell! I linger but to take my leave Of all I loved; my soul is on its way; I am impatient to begone;âfarewell! Farewell! My road is hence and hard and far; And where it leads me I may haply learn; And whither, if at all, it takes me home! ..... Now I but know I will be free to follow In the steep way, my soul's way, to the lightâ The light which dawns within me! O my friendsâ Kin, soldiers, citizensâbe well assured That even in this mystic and majestic hour The Lord is in my houseâand wakes! ..... At dawn, Solving the heart's incertitudes, one came To witness to the Lord and specify His adventâand he wakesâand all is well! I askedâand bountifully I have received; I soughtâand I have wonderfully found; I knockedâand now the spacious and sudden doors Splendidly open to my furtherance! ..... I must begone! Farewell, at last, farewell! My heart is fain; my will is on the way; And, from the soul's eternal secret source, Issues a strength I hardly dare to feel Within me and upon me!âsuch a strength As drives the ploughshare of its great resolve Across the little limits of this world, And may endure no let of God or man Cast in the fair-way of its rash ambition! ..... CREON Now sounds the dread, mad voice whose sense is peril. The POET Now sounds the trumpet-call of hope, the cry Of the enfranchised, strong, expectant soul! HERAKLES Comrades and friendsâcompanions of my youthâ Lovers of mine, whose love was health and home, Honour and happiness to me,âfarewell! Now may your eyes discern the mystic change! Him you behold is not that Herakles You knew, who armed you from the temple walls, And captained you across the battlefields, In the dark way of death, to victory! I am no more, no more,âO valiant sons Of Cadmus! O my soldiers!âas I was That day we wrapped in winding-sheets of flame Palace and parapet and pinnacle And all the bastioned power of proud Orchomenos! I go away into the light from you; I leave you; I return no more..... And yet You shall remember how it was with us That day the hero and the host returned Full-flushed, in triumph, with the Minyan spoil!â When the pale women caught our dreadful hands, Where the red blood dried black, and wreathed our swordsâ Our sinister, soiled swords of victoryâ With bridal flowers, and kissed our fierce, parched mouths, And, weeping, laughed into our shining eyes With eager lips, song-spent and tremulous! You shall remember!âand I leave with you That Herakles who bids you now farewell! An immense clamour rises from the people. The soldiers, with cries of devotion and dismay, rush forward and surround HERAKLES. They even seize his garments with restraining hands. O manhoodâmemoriesâmood of many days Of well-companioned tasks and victories And exultations and familiar joys, Evoked, impassioned in your hearts and mine!â How shall I bear to say farewell to you? Brothers-in-armsâO comradesâfaithful friendsâ It is not as my heart willsânot my heart Is turned from you-ward!âfor God knows my heart Is yearning and irresolute and aggrieved, And will not leave you, and laments and loves And dares not lose what life has held so dear! Only I know there is no way for me But my way, and no way but yours for you; And all ways of the world are false and blind And barred and bounded to a mean ambition, Which knows no more magnificent prize than mere Exclusive profits and prosperities; And all ways of the soul are ways of truth, Which whoso treads them out shall learn to know What excellence there is within himself Which finds no hope or having tolerable That all men may not share on equal terms! But since, when once revealed, the truth forever Is irremediable; and since I know You will not come with me out of the world; And since I may not go away with you, Back from my prospect and my path;âfarewell! What tho' the strong heart breaks to feel your love? Yet will the soul, the waking soul, be free! ..... Turning swiftly to MEGARA O let us hasten hence! Turning again to the soldiers and people, and speaking as though to all the world Farewell! Farewell!â Now and forevermore! Meanwhile the MESSENGERS OF EURYSTHEUS have approached. Now one of them advances alone toward HERAKLES. The MESSENGER O Herakles, Wise is your purpose now to bid farewell To all the world! HERAKLES Long since I took my leave Of Kings and of the Messengers of Kings. The MESSENGER Wise is your purposeâfor the proud fair days And pleasant ways of life your feet have trod, Are changed and ended to return no more. FarewellâO bid farewell indeed to all These high commandments, riches, fame and friends, Honour and eager glories of the world! FarewellâO bid farewell to happiness; To home and wife and child a last farewell! HERAKLES Rashly you speak of what you know not of. No man alive is justified to say What things are fit for the self-centred soul. I bid farewell to all that is not truth And all enslavements of the soul,âbut love Of two hearts blent together to one end Of ecstasy and truth's eternities, Is a great thoroughfare of liberty Wherein the soul may walk its way well-pleased! I bid farewell to none who go their ways, Strong and resolved, wherever the light is. To you, but not to them whose way is love, Whose love is truth, I bid a last farewell. The MESSENGER Vain are your words, and all your thoughts are vain, And all your hopes! O bid farewell to love, Farewell to friendship and to hope farewell,â Farewell, a long farewell to liberty! No more of all these things your life shall be Made glad and great and good!âno more! no more! But rather inconsolable solitude, Hardship and hunger, shame and ill-report, Vile words and bitter usage of the world, Labour and servitude and sacrifice, Vigil and vagrancy shall be your lot, Your strength's achievement and your life's reward! The POET to the WOMAN, grasping her arm Watch! for the death-grip comes,âmore terrible Than fear can image or despair conceive! ..... Watch! for the dark, fierce, dread, revengeful Gods, Out of the shadow of the Mystery, Launch the lean lightnings of their utmost wrath! HERAKLES Farewell to love? ..... Farewell to liberty? ..... And what of truth? ..... And what of life itself? ..... Enough! Enough! These idle, senseless words Merely perplex my purpose. Go your ways! I have too long delayed to hear you,âgo! The MESSENGER advancing a step toward HERAKLES Born homeless by your sire's misdeeds, outcast And exiled kinsman of the Argive King,â Herakles! Herakles!âby birth, by race, By right his subject,âpause and hear me speak! For I am charged to bear the King's commands To you, his servantâ HERAKLES Silence! By the Godsâ The MESSENGER The Gods enforce you to your Sovereign's will! CREON to the POET See how he glares! The POET His eyes are like a cry Of horror!âlike a stricken, haunted place! ..... HERAKLES to himself ..... Where is the light? ..... the light? ..... To the MESSENGERS, with violence Begone! Begone! I know my lineage; but I have no care Of crowds or crowns or human servitudes! Your King's commands are senseless words to me; Your vain pretensions like an idiot's dream! Enough! Begone! I have my soul to seek, My truth to learn, my liberty to win,â And all my labours are as yet undone! The MESSENGER Where are your labours? HERAKLES Where the light is not To bring the light; and where the way is shut To open out the way; and where the house Is tenantless to rouse the Lord within!â There are my labours and my works are these! The MESSENGER By strict enforcement of Eurystheus' will And stern commandment of the deathless Gods, Yours are the labours of a subject man, Yours are the tasks and toil of servitude! For where Eurystheus bids your strength to serve, There shall your works be done; and all shall reap Plentiful harvests of your sowing, all Shall profit where your single strength has earned! And, from the world's avid and thrifty hand, No wage shall you receive, even at last,â And no thanksgiving..... HERAKLES Silence!â The MESSENGER Herakles! Herakles! by my voice your Sovereign speaks! Teach your rebellious knees to kiss the dust; Learn to obey, and humbly serve his will! HERAKLES Silence! Begone!â To himself What voice of prophecy Cries in my heart? ..... I dare not know the truth, Nor hear the secret answered in my soul! It were too monstrous if the worst were trueâ Too monstrous! I will doubt no moreâand yet Where is the lightâmy light? ..... Where is the voice, The one puissant voice of the soul's song? ..... Why am I left in darkness and alone, Deserted and betrayed? ..... Why do I feel Shudder within me like a dreadful ghost The superstition of a fatal thing? ..... The POET I know the truth, I read the secret now! ..... CREON starting to his feet God! he will yield! ..... AMPHITRYON My son! MEGARA My Herakles! HERAKLES turning upon her You?âYou?â The POET O were he strong enough to yield! The WOMAN throwing herself at the feet of HERAKLES Lord, I believe! HERAKLES Your faith destroys me! The WOMAN Lord!â Lord!âI believe! HERAKLES Then help my unbelief! I dare not realize what the truth may be!â So terrible it is, I half believe There is some passing madness in my mind By which the light is quenched, the voice is quelled! Surely it must be so! I know but this, I cannot see the lightâand suddenly All the serene and mighty symphonies Of heart and brain and being are silent..... The WOMAN Lord! ..... Lord! ..... I believe! HERAKLES ..... The light returnsâthe voice! ..... I dare not understand! ..... I dare not yield! ..... The MESSENGER striking HERAKLES with his staff Down in the dust, and do your master's will! The people and soldiers cry out with a mighty voice. With the swiftness of passion, HERAKLES wrests the staff from the hand of the MESSENGER and strikes him to the ground, where he lies insensible. HERAKLES utterly giving way to anger Intolerable! Intolerable!âBeware, O Gods, O Kings, O men who try me thus! You play like children with a deadly thing! That heart may learn to hate you which should love; That strength may ruin which might best redeem! Turning upon the MESSENGERS who still confront him Back to your kennel and your currish king! I spare your lives which are not worth my pains! Say to Eurystheus I may well return From exile!âand should Herakles return, Not one in Argos would survive to tell The monstrous story of its devastation! ..... I would tear Tiryns from its base and cast Its burned-out ruins on the Argive plain; And in its place I would rear up a tower Of the charred corpses of its citizens, Welded in blood; and on its pinnacle The pale head of Eurystheus should display How he went down to death beneath my hand, Frenzied with fear, forsaken, false, accursed!â Go! while there still is mercy in me, go! A great shout of relief and acclamation rises from the soldiers and people. The POET springs forward and confronts HERAKLES face to face. The POET shouting at HERAKLES Coward and traitor! Traitor!â He is roughly seized by the soldiers; struggling in their grasp, he turns to the WOMAN Mourn! O mourn, Daughter of desolation, mourn your loss! O faithful heart!âWoman!âWe are betrayed! Alas! Alas! He is as one of us, Who all are slaves and dare not undergo The mighty labours of our liberation! He too is abject, feeble, and afraid; He too with mean economy prefers The helot's hovel to the master's house; He too will not afford the price of truth Nor earn the soul's full freedom by his pains! HERAKLES fiercely, but dismayed Whose voice assails me? The POET Mine!âwhich might have sung PÃ¦ans and poems of you in exultation! HERAKLES Now by the Gods you well may die for this! ..... The POET Slay if you will! Yet mind you well that he Who slays himself in spirit and in truth, Has done more murder than a sword can do! I fear you not!âbut fear me well you may, Since I am one whose lips have learned to phrase The truth's tremendous syllables of song! Coward and traitor!âyou have quenched the light Of truth and shut the door of liberty! HERAKLES stands, sobered and dizzy as from a blow. The soldiers begin to drag the POET away; he turns once more to the WOMAN. Daughter of desolation, mourn your loss! Weep, for the Child is slain! He slays the Child, The Child of Light, about whose mystic birth You were the mid-wife and the ministrant! ..... The WOMAN to HERAKLES, with agony Lord, I believe! HERAKLES What faith can make me whole? ..... The POET as he is dragged away by the soldiers Coward and traitor!âTraitor!â His voice is suddenly silenced; he disappears. HERAKLES stands, heedless of everything; silent, sick, uncertain. End of the Seventh Scene. EIGHTH SCENE Later of the same day. An open space before a Temple situated on an acropolis in Thebes. The gay tumult of a public holiday rises from the city, which lies out in panorama not far below. The POET and the WOMAN, alone. The POET We two in all the world have tears for him! ..... Hark! how they make a public festival And cry thanksgiving that the God is slain ..... He pauses. The WOMAN is silent. The rumour from the city sounds louder than before. Yes, they rejoice!âan excellence is lost, And so their triumph is securely won! Hark! how they mock with mirth the soul's defeat, These dreadful, dread majorities of men Who shout into the air and beat their hands At pageants, tragedies, and crucifixions;â Who, when a soul surrenders, sound across Truth's broken harmonies their rank applause! The cries of the multitude sound nearer. Hark! Hark! They comeâwreathed, radiant, unashamed! Their drums sound hither where the mourners sit, Sanctified, silent in their mystic grief, About the gravestone of the earth-born God! And whensoever, from the huddled homes, The congregations and the courts of men, One, rising up from where he sat so long In darkness with the wise men of the world, Finds God incarnate in his inmost soul, And feels across the vision of his eyes The unimagined, strong, seraphic light, And speaks his mystic message thrilled with song,â Then will you hear sound out against the man The world's ironic, base, and vacant voice,â The tuneless tumult of democracies! So, when the soul is crushed, defeated, slain,â O then as now, toward the crystalline Unmindful heaven's serene immensity, From all the nameless numbers of the world Thunder their triumph and their acclamations! ..... A great, gay multitude of men and women, with CREON and AMPHITRYON at their head, appear on their way from the city to the Temple. Not even here is sanctuary..... Behold! They come to thank the Gods that God is slain! CREON, on his way, perceives the POET and pauses. CREON Here 's our poetic, pale enthusiast, Changed from his madness, sobered, let us hope, And somewhat wiser. Ah, how vain were all Our hopes and fears! He merely boasted! What?â Believed his boast, you say?âI grant you! Well, And what of that? True faith 's the only harm! For much as Herakles was crazed by dreams, So in their lives are many men deceived,â And by their disenchantment much matured! Thus we discern when excellence is lost How much is saved,âour hero first of all! And last, but not, good sir, believe me, least, We now may pleasantly observe how well Our sense of humour and our quiet smile Of irony still vindicate their use, And prove life's ablest critics after all! The POET listens with quiet indifference. CREON turns and enters the Temple with AMPHITRYON. The multitude follow. The POET and the WOMAN are left once more alone. The WOMAN I will not now believe that all is lost! ..... The POET Nothing is lost!âfor he was not the Light; He was but one whose strength had momently Uplifted in his hand the kindled torch Whereof the spark lives quenchless in the soul. Fail not in faith because the torch-bearer Is fallen!âthe sacred flame still lives in splendour, Tho' the lax hand let fall the lamp that made To our gross sense the glory visible! ..... The WOMAN I know no light but his, no faith but him. He held the torch up in my darknesses; He gave me light where the long path went on; And where his strength made room, there was my way! ..... Strong and serene as sunrise, I beheld His advent; and, the little while he tarried, The common clay I am of life's admixture Seemed all suffused and interchanged with gold! ..... What shall my life become if he is gone? ..... And what is truth? ..... and why are all the free Fine faculties of the impassioned mind? ..... And wherefore has the heart such wings of faith, Such springs of love, such hardihood of hope, If he is gone?âI will not so believe! He is still forward, still sublime, still strong! ..... The POET Alas! Alas! I dare not hopeâI saw The Spirit labouring in him, as life labours In one who dies too young..... The light was spent; The voice was still! Alas! I know too well The secret signs:âhow often, in my house Daily rekindled, daily have I seen The light dying, dying,âthe sacred flame Burn small into the common day of life! How often IâI also, silently And suddenly have seen those walls, that make The mansion of the Spirit's isolation, Wear thin as light, and, like a prodigy, The dayspring of the soul flush thro'!âtill all This mortal man was like a lantern held Aloft, alight in the vast night of being; And wayfarers might find their way withal! I too have lit my candle at the sun, And made my poems of it till the light failed! ..... Made only poems!âyet more than he shall make, Who is grown dark as any proud glad man; Whose light is quenched in passion and fierce deeds; Whose soul is spent in purchase of this world; Whose strength is small; whose truth is partisan! Alas! Alas! there is no room for hope..... The WOMAN I will not so believe! They are not dark, His eyes, where once my sightless eyes discerned Spacious and grave nativities of light! He is not, in the dust with other men, So all inexpiably and weakly fallen From where he stood, aureoled, invincible! ..... The POET You love him! The WOMAN I? ..... I dared not! Love?âO God! I had not strength enough nor grace of soul Nor grandeur in my heart to love him with! Could I have loved him all might now be well! ..... The POET Can you imagine of the human heart Such prodigies?âthat love could so avail The soul once purposed to the ends of truth, Which fears and palters with the price? ..... Enough! Let us go hence before the worshippers Return to vex our grief and solitude. Let us go hence. The WOMAN ..... and seek for Herakles! The POET and the WOMAN depart. A moment later HERAKLES appears, coming up from the city. He pauses by the Temple steps, gazing abroad over the immense prospect. HERAKLES I dimly see how far perfection is, And what the utmost price of truth must be, And how the strong soul is companionless..... And I am heart-sick in my hour of weakness! I have been much and soon and fiercely tried, And now the process of the pregnant past Yields to my sense its stern significance!â I was a tranquil householder, whose house Of life seemed so securely locked and barred That at the feast and in the pleasant mansions How should he fear to find the fatal guestâ The Truth, whose voice sings out the wonder-song Of life and death adventured to one end; Whose eyes are clear, whose brows are pale with stars, Whose nakedness is bright and terrible? ..... Yet, in the rashness of my discontent, My hands, impatient of the tasks and toys, Breached the blind walls of life's secure defence And gave glad welcome to the ambushed foe! Now am I pressed and overborne, as one Beleaguered in a ruined citadel; I am invaded, violated!âall The doors stand open of my dwelling-place; My heart is sacked and spoiled without reprieve, For all may pillage in its treasuries; The feast no more is spread but Truth is there To consecrate the wine of human love And transubstantiate life's daily bread; And in the mansions I can sleep no more Because of one crying âIt is the Dawn!ââ I was a thrifty husbandman who tilled With patient labour life's familiar fields, And gathered in the harvest to his small And well-approved and insufficient needs;â But when the narrow bounty of my tillage No more sufficed to give me nourishment, Eager of more superb prosperities, I drove my ploughshare with a reckless hand, Furrowed the fallow acres of the soul, And in new soil of strange fertilities Cast down the good seed of a great ambition! Now in my soul the ripened harvest stands, Waiting the sickle,âand my hands must reap And earn perfection's lordlier livelihood!â Leaving unsown, unscythed, unharvested, The humble fruit of human happiness Which was the substance of my daily bread, And all my life long made the staff of life. I was a happy lover, innocent And candid in the paradise of love; And love was human and was happinessâ Until I dreamed of the celestial Bride! ..... Then were my heart's inviolate secrecies Disclosedâand I beheld her fabled face! ..... I saw how young she was and beautiful! ..... I knew her love's ineffable ecstasies! ..... And all the lesser loveliness of earth Was in my sight no more desirable. Then, like a bridegroom, heedless on his quest If the dark way be strange and unexplored Or if the bridal chamber have no light, I hastened to my ParamourâI kept Love's secret assignation with my soul! Now of that whispered, dark embrace is born, In the deep womb of thought, a prodigy Whose strength shall dispossess me of this world! ..... CHORUS OF RESPONDENTS from within the Temple We fear Thee and we know Thee not! ..... We know but this, when all is said: That life is false and forfeited, And love foregone and truth forgot To serve Thee whom we dare not trust; While, vexed with very sore distress, We go nowhither in the trampled dust Of life, companioned yet companionless..... Yet still we serve Theeâas we must!â Serve Thee and suffer and atone And daily fear Thee and confess The Kingdom and the Glory and the Power Are only Thineânot ours but Thine alone! For we are meek in spirit, And live like creatures of the transient hour Who dare not strive and suffer to inherit The birthright of the soul,âwho dare not be Perfect as Thou art and, as Thou art, free! No hopes may tempt us; and for us in vain, Globed like a golden lamp suffused in rain, The candid, living fruit upon the tree Of knowledge, and the prime, pressed grapes of love Which brim with sacred wine life's earthen bowl, Ripen in sun-steeped orchards of the soul! ..... We are incurious, pious and afraid And have no care thereof, So the small price of all we lose is paid. Therefore, as Thou art just, Give and forgive!â Forgive our trespasses, and as we humbly live, Give us our daily bread! By Thy small mercies we confirm our trust: And since so much is forfeit that perchance Man might reclaim as his inheritance, Scant not to our desire The mess of pottage that we ask instead! But, in abundant measure, Give us the trifle of our hire,â The pride, the fame, the kingships and the gold, The paltry profit and the hasty pleasure, For which, to further and fulfil The dark stern process of Thy secret will, The soul, the truth, the strength of man are sold! HERAKLES Pathosâhumilityâsurrenderâfear!â Starved, sterile, satisfied, supremely sad Human vociferation and appeal!â O frightened children, crying in the dark!â Be well assured this hour of lamentation, Of weakness and despair shall pass away! Unconquerable is the strength within meâsoon, Soon to revive!âand spares not, neither counts The cost! ..... O I begin to be afraid Of what I am!âfor if I live at all, I must reclaim the Birthright and redeem The Spirit and the Truth from servitude! Servitude?âthen, the labours?âand Eurystheus?â No, by the Gods, it is not to be borne! And in the very thought of that abasement Lies only madness and a black despair! ..... The voice of the POET from below How shall we learn to bear what must be borne? How shall the heart not break when love is lost? How shall life earn enough to pay the cost Of all the tears, the solitude, the scorn? How shall we not be utterly forlorn When they deny us whom we cherished most? When all life was becomes a dreadful ghost, How, from such pangs of death, is life reborn?â How shall we live at all? ..... Thou canst not say, O Heart, whose voice is lamentation! Where, Where are the nobler virtues that repay, When all is gone that gave us most delight? When shall the soul, from what supernal height, Witness the truth and save us from despair? Before the voice of the POET is still, a very old blind man, lead by a shepherd boy, appears coming up from below. At the same moment CREON and AMPHITRYON, followed by the multitude of worshippers, appear upon the Temple steps. The OLD MAN Is there a man who hears me? If there be, Let him, as one who loves the Delphic God, Straitly direct my stepsâ CREON Teiresias! TEIRESIAS Surely I know the accents of the King..... CREON Servant of Loxias, wherefore art thou come? Thou, in whose sightless eyes the God has fixed The fearful vision of all future things, Speak, if thy words concern the fate of Thebes! TEIRESIAS Creon, I come not in the public cause. Yet, I beseech you, guide me, that the will Of God may be accomplished; and direct My steps, that I may speak, as God commands, His words to Herakles. HERAKLES To Herakles?â What is your message? Speak!âfor be assured If God is I will know His will with me! TEIRESIAS You are that Herakles?âO wretched man! HERAKLES Wretched? ..... TEIRESIAS Most wretched of the sons of men Is he who breaks the bonds of human fate And dares the soul's transcendent destiny! He shall, alone of all men, nevermore Rest and arise refreshed from rest; rejoice, Love, live, and have his happy human being, As a man may, in life's familiar place Where sleep is sweet and toil repaid and tears Consoled and man's imperfect nature soothed And satisfied, man's unambitious mind Content, man's insufficient heart fulfilled! ..... For all his life is lost to save his life; And all he loved is sacrificed and slain To make love pure and perfect in his heart!â Until at last, released from servitude By long, incredible labours and the strength That sleeps not, neither spares, the soul is left Naked with knowledge, where the lapse of time Leaves its eternity unhazarded, Solitary in a waste and desert place,â Where once the friendly cities rose in towers, And, rich with harvests, hills and pleasant gardens, The humble paradise of human life Prospered and heard no tidings of the soul! ..... HERAKLES O breaking heart!âIs there no hope at all Of any tolerable issue? ..... TEIRESIAS Peace! Hear me, for I declare the words of God!â I stood upon the mountain, and the voice Of God spoke in my soul, saying: âIt dawns! ..... My light dawns in the soul of Herakles! ..... Faint and afar his eyes have seen the Light; His heart receives the gracious and divine Nativity, and radiant is his mind With rapture, and he hails the light with joy! He feels a splendour in his strength; he sees Burn with clear flame the torch of his resolve; The door of his deliverance stands wide Asunder in the vista of his vision; His hope is on the way; his faith is full; His winged ambition soars into the sun! .....â HERAKLES So, in the Dawn of Light, it was with me! ..... TEIRESIAS The voice of God spoke in my soul, saying: âMan is not saved because he sees the truth: He must be true before his task is done! Dawn crimsons on the mountain crest of thought, While still inert, disfranchised, unredeemed, The substance and the self of human being Lie far below in that sepulchral night, Wherein, like spectres moving in a trance, Like candles briefly kindled and consumed, The countless unambitious multitudes Of mortal men exist at all adventure, Timid and credulous of what they seem, Fostered or blasted by the winds of chance. Therefore, tho' Herakles has seen the Light, The long captivities of ignorance And pain and force and fear constrain his soul: He has not even reckoned with the price, Nor counted with the cost of liberty; He has not learned how much the flame consumes Which purifies,âhow much the light dissolves Which shows the truth,âhow much perfection is, To all imperfect, happy, human things, Ruin and desolation! .....â HERAKLES Desolation..... Ruin..... And then, redemption? ..... TEIRESIAS Hear the voice Of God!âit cries out in my spirit, saying, âMore light! More light! More truth for Herakles!â Light to dissolve, perfection to destroy, Truth to lay waste and ruin and make smooth, Make straight and smooth the pathway of the soul! ..... Haste!âlest the saviour and the soul be lost, Man's birthright forfeit, and the soul's supreme Ambition bartered for a little thing! Haste!âand exhort the man enslaved to wear No more the chains of his captivity! There is no virtue he shall not forego Who fears and palters with the price of truth; There is no excellence or liberation He shall not earn who dares to undergo The mighty labours and the sacrifice Which win the soul's way out of servitude!â HERAKLES Where is the God who bade your steps come hither, Your voice speak out the doom of Herakles? Where is the God?âunless within the soul Of man divinity resides unborn..... Why do you seek to cheat me with a phrase And thwart my understanding with a name? It is your voice I hear and yours alone!â Blind, wretched Soothsayerâwhere is the God? TEIRESIAS Bear with him, Loxias, for his agony Is more than mortal grief! HERAKLES Where is the God? Where is the God?âif God there be at all! CREON Haply at Delphi, in his sacred house. TEIRESIAS God dwells wherever He is well received And welcome in the life and soul of man. HERAKLES Delphi? ..... At Delphi I will seek the God! And if He is, and man may find him out, There will I meet him face to face at last! ..... End of the Eighth Scene. NINTH SCENE Before the Temple of Apollo at Delphi. HERAKLES stands alone near the steps of the Temple. HERAKLES I left them in the quiet houseâmy sons, My woman and my whole heart's happiness! ..... And all my life, and all my self that was The world's great Captain in its little wars, The pride and praise of men, I left behind! Now, standing here by this prophetic shrine, I am alone and exiled and bereaved, I am forsaken, heart-sick, comfortless,â I am resolved to read the riddle out And search the secret till I understand! ..... Lost am Iâlost! I know not where I am; I know not where I go;âbut whence I come I know too well!âO this is all my guidance: The passion to be other than I am And realize self in the strict terms of truth! The light is notâand yet the twilight is About me, glimmering like a moonlit mist..... And like a ghost I walk unreconciled, Dubious and undetermined and forlorn, Fearing the day, yet longing for the light! O promised Dawn!âwhen you are come at last, What shall your light disclose?âsome spectacle Of tragic desolation,âlonely days And loveless nights and long, laborious, Monstrous, intolerable servitudes?â Or shall I stand at once, as I have dreamed, With all I love in the high place of Peace, Dilate as with the Universal being, Filled and fulfilled with your serenities? ..... The great doors of the Temple slowly open. In the dark twilight of His house the shrine of the God and the veil behind it are dimly visible. The PROPHETES appears upon the threshold. HERAKLES turns his face toward him. The PROPHETES What voice of wretchedness and wild unrest Cries out before the House of God? HERAKLES My voice Knew not the tones and tears of grief till now! After a life of strength and high resolve This is my hour of doubt and blind appeal, This is my hour of agony! ..... The PROPHETES The God Knows neither lamentation nor unrest: His calm perfection hears no human voice. HERAKLES There is one voice He shall not choose but hear! The voice of the PYTHIA sounding in ecstasy from behind the veil within the Temple. As she speaks a CHORUS of men and women, worshippers of the God, assemble upon the Temple steps. Before the House of God They grieve and they rejoice Whose utmost light is of the common day, Whose aimless feet along the trampled sod Tread the strait precinct of the public way, Whose lives are like a pageant passing by..... Within the House of God No ear receives their incoherent voice; No eye Is witness to the deeds their days have done! Like mummers at a carnival They flaunt their scant disguise, and one by one Go out into the dark in silence, after all..... The CHORUS Only a windy light no eye perceives; Only a thrill of joy, a pang of grief; Only a voice crying where silence is, Where none respond and the brave song is brief; Only the plaything of blind destinies, Which ends in nothing as it once began;â So is the life of man! The PROPHETES There is no shadow of imperfect things Cast on the glory of God's excellence: Filled with eternal light, His rapt regard Perceives no grieved, importunate human face! HERAKLES There is one face He shall not fail to see! The CHORUS We live upon the threshold of His house, And there like children sport with idle things; We are a voice that weeps, a voice that sings, A hand that traces in the senseless dust The little hazard of our happenings. Ours is a time for turmoil and carouse; Ours is a time for sickness, sleep, and tears, Labour and laughter, love and lust; Ours is a time to come, a time to go! ..... Yet fearfully we feel, dimly we know That all the while we live, thro' all our years, Which run out, futile and disused, before The threshold of His holy House, the door, Dark with the gloom of unfamiliar fears, Behind us, ever and alway, Waits to receive us! ..... Yet we dread To turn our feet from the strait way they tread! Yea! tho' our hearts, unsatisfied, are rife With doubts and questions that will not depart, We dare not ask or seek or knock Or lay strong hands on the unguarded lock. Rather from day to day We cheat the mind with work and dreams and strife, We cheat the love-sick heart With passion and blind love that perisheth,â Until from all our toys we are taken away, And in unspeakable loneliness depart! ..... Then, thro' the door of destiny and death, Which is the door of truth's eternal life, We men, whose times were squandered on the sill Of the soul's dwelling-place,â Who found not virtue, strength, or will To slant the door and meet Him face to face,â Unborn, unwaked, unwise, and comfortless, Pass from life's nothing into nothingness! ..... HERAKLES Children of men, there is one voice of power He shall not choose but hear; one fearless face He shall not fail to see!âMy voice shall call To rouse the Lord; my hand shall slant the door; Mine eyes shall meet Him face to face at last! ..... The PROPHETES None can endure the grandeur of His gaze; None can receive the splendour of His speech! HERAKLES There is one eye His glance shall not confound! There is one soul His speech shall not appeal! The CHORUS Behind us and before us The shadow is, Whose incommensurable silences Never make answer to life's thundered chorus..... And in our hands we bear the little light Of life across the huge and haunted night A windy mile or so; And whence we come and whither we shall go We know not and we fear to know! ..... The voice of the PYTHIA as before Yet may the inward eye perceive, Hardly, and thro' the darkness faint and far, Truth's single, stedfast star; And learn, by vigil, to receive The light; and, careless of the goal, In the divine impatience of the soul, Forfeit all hopes and fears to follow on! ..... Yet may the heart's unuttered love believe That somewhere the majestic sun Of knowledge shines on calm immensities, And drowns in light death's dark infinities! ..... Yet may the restless mind at last devise Some scale and measure for the worth of things, And rise, and valorously depart, Led by the vision of the inward eyes, Flushed with the rapt assurance of the heart, Wearied and scornful of their parleyings, Their dreams and games and profits, who before The threshold of the shadowed door, Build of base earth their human paradise!â Yet may a man, at length, Feel in the secret sources of his strength The power to ask, to seek, to knock, To force, if need be, the unguarded lock, And, in the solitude where none else are, To set the great, dark door ajar, And live, and enter, and with words of power rouse The Master of the House! The CHORUS It may be, as the Spirit saith, That whoso slants the shadowed door, Thereafter, deathless at the core, Pursues his way thro' life and death As one who walks an endless road, Chequered with sun and shade, to some ineffable abode! ..... It may be, as our dreams aver, Beyond the door which none have passed, The asker and the answerer, The seeker and the truth, at last, Are single and supremely one! ..... It may be, when the gate is won, That whose stands within the door Exults with love's transcendent youth In calm eternities of truth Where, as with God's immortal breath, The soul forever and forever quickeneth! ..... But we, whose lives are spent before The threshold of the House of God, We only know it is not thus Ever for one of us! Rather we know not what is worst or best, And we are wearied, and we find no rest,â And there is haply rest beneath the sod! ..... Therefore, as life has taught us, so we deem Time is the little way from birth to death Which flowers and stars and countless men have trod And found no reason of their wretchedness, No pondered justice first or last, No light to guide, no Saviour to redeem! So, in the passion of our heart's distress, Our minds inert, incurious, and afraid, Receive the witness of the woful past And worship at the shrines our fathers made. And well we know, when all is said, Tho' faith and hope caress their dream, That life and death and sorrow and loneliness Do something more to us than merely seem! HERAKLES O Children!âO my frightened Children!âPeace! Children of men, it is not as you deem!â Hear me!âI say life palters with the price Of Truth's for-everlasting gift and grace!â I, in my hour of weakness, I have dealt In mean economies, and sapped my strength, And vexed the soul's resolve with lamentation! I too have feared and suffered!âand even now I am afraidâI sufferâI am not strong! I see before me with a black despair The prospect of my desolation!âYea, And worse, it may be, if the worst come true!â The prospect of a life's intolerable, Infamous servitude! ..... And in my mind There is a kind of madness without name Even to think of it,âand a red mist Of blood drowning the vision of mine eyes! ..... He pauses; then speaks again. As he speaks, he mounts the steps and crosses the threshold of the Temple. Children of men, I bring you somewhat more Than hope! Mine eyes have sundered darknesses..... I have beheld the star of truth and seen The sun of knowledge dawn over the soul..... I have devised ascending gyres of thought, And climbed into the prospect of perfection..... I have turned inward from the spectacle And florid insignificance of what The rank world reckons as the life of man, And set my strength against the shadowed door, And come at last living into his house, And called the Master with a mighty voice! Him will I meet with face to face, and feel His power, and hear His secrets in my ear! ..... And living as I go I shall return, And bring you news and tidings of the Lord! ..... The PROPHETES Forbear! No man may trespass in the House Of God, lest desolation worse than death Leave him bereaved and naked to the soul! Forbear!âInflexible as knowledge is, Calm as perfection, merciless as truth, So is the Godâand no man may endure His real presence and thereafter live! The voice of the PYTHIA as before His Spirit is Like a vase of diamond Brimmed with eternal springs of living light..... His heart of clear religious ecstasies, Tranquil, transfigured, true humanities, In love's grave gardens of divine delight, Feels the immortal heart of life respond..... His thought is spacious and serene And like a consecrated place Where knowledge is the soul of grace, And truth alone is heard and seen..... And who, with undiverted will, As He is perfect dares to be, And, in despite of grief and fear, Has crossed alone the sacred sill,â His voice He shall not choose but hear, His face He shall not fail to see: To him the very God is near!â And, as his soul shall understand, To him the Spirit and the Truth are close at hand! ..... HERAKLES makes a motion to advance into the Temple. The PROPHETES Forbear! HERAKLES Stern guardian of the Sacred Door, I know the shining garments of the soul, Which all must wear who enter in His house, It well may be are robes of hueless flame In which my human being and heart and even This rugged vesture of mortality, Which tempers truth and makes perfection mild, Must perish away and all be quite consumed..... Yet is there that within me which compels, And will not rest, and is resolved to go! While all wait in silence, HERAKLES enters the Temple, approaches the altar, rends the veil, and discloses the PYTHIA seated upon the tripod. He disappears into the darkness of the inner Temple. A moment later he reappears, overthrows the tripod, and comes to the door of the Temple, dragging with him the PYTHIA. He thrusts the PYTHIA forth upon the steps, and himself remains standing within the Temple door. The shrine is empty! Speak, false prophetess! Where is the God? The PYTHIA Where else but in His house! HERAKLES I am alone within the House of God! ..... The PYTHIA in utmost ecstasy Melt in His arms! Resist not! Care not! Strive No more, for He is quiet and merciless; And by His means shall naught grow less, But all that is shall greater grow! ..... For, save with His transcendent life, Within His mansions none may live; And, as He prospers, even so All thoughts and things, transfigured, thrive! His truth is like a shining knife Which slays, in sense and heart and brain, Till what was perishable is slainâ And lives!âtransmuted, born again Dilate with His immortal breath! ..... He keeps no least account with pain, With desolation, tears, and death! Perfect and pure as knowledge is, He has no private end to gain; No covenant, no terms to make; No silences To keep; no death to fear; no heart to break! ..... Man's eyes are clouded with distress; The heart of man is vexed and twain; The mind of man is caged and caught, Nor dares with lifted wings go free;â His eyes are quiet as calm dawns at sea, And single, and His heart is one; His perfect love is pitiless, And asks no less than all that man can give, And will not suffer that man come to naught, And will not punish or forgive; His mind, like some majestic sun, Centres the vast, expanding gyres of thought! ..... Melt in His arms and cease from strife! ..... He wakes! ..... He lives! ..... The Lord has come, And all is glorified thereof! Melt in His arms!âand, for the larger life, Forfeit the life you cherished and the love That once was all your happiness and home! At last the Lord of Love and Life appears, And, in His being's excellence, The little life of hopes and fears, The little love of self and sense Dissolveâexalted to magnificence! HERAKLES to the PYTHIA, almost in appeal Who is the Lordâthe God?âand where is He?â The PYTHIA as before Who asks is answered by His voice; Who dares advance is on the road; Whose soul is free and fain to choose, Has made the truth's transcendent choice; Who seeks the God has found the God; Who knocks is Master of the House! HERAKLES with a great cry Mine is the desolation and the death! The PYTHIA as before Yours is the resurrection and the life! HERAKLES I am the God! The PYTHIA as before There is no God but I!â I am whatever is! I am despair and hope and love and hate, Freedom and fate, Life's plangent cry, Death's stagnant silences! ..... I am the earth and sea and sky, The race, the runner and the goal; I am the part and I the whole;â There is no thought nor thing but I! Children, behold!âthe East is white! I see it dawn across the dark!â I see the daybreak of the light That truth has kindled in the conscious soul! And hark, my Children!âO my Children, hark!â For nearer now, and yet more near, And still afar, and wordless still, I hear The music of the soul's puissant voice Rejoice With festival in the heart and ecstasies For man's deliverance! Therefore cry welcome! for the Master is Come to His own divine inheritance! Cry welcome! for the Lord of all, The Love, the Life, the Strength is comeâ The rightful Heir, the Prodigal, After long exile, now returneth home! The CHORUS Strophe I Truly we care not for the truth, We care not and we dare not care;â But life and love and health and youth, These things, we know, are sweet and fair! Antistrophe I Yet love is false, and life is brief, And youth and health and hope depart, And troubled is the human heart With fear and agony and grief. Strophe II And why life is we dare not ask, And what is death we dare not guess; In doubt, despair, and weariness We shirk the truth's unending task. Antistrophe II It may be that the truth repays Thought's endless toil to reach its goal; It may be God is in the soul, And wakens after many days..... Epode But we have neither part nor lot With truth's far-sought and fabled grace: Wherever is God's dwelling-place, In all our lives we find Him not! HERAKLES Coward and weak and abject! ..... O my Soul!â How long the dark persuasion of my fears Has wrought deception, and consoled the heart With lies of some conceivable escape! ..... How long even I have dreamed false dreams of God, As of some other than the self I know, To whom might meanly, secretly be shifted The endless labour of the soul's perfection, The mystery of being, and the deep, Unuttered meaning of the Universe! ..... Now, self-revealed, at last, and self-confessed The Lord, alone responsible and real, I stand defenceless, sleepless, undeceived,â Naked before the truth!âWhat more is death Than my bereavement and my solitude? What more is death?âand what can death do more Than rob the Spirit of its resting-place, Its refuge of insensibility, And leave it outcast, as my soul is left, Doomed to incessant vigil and unrest? What more is death?âfor what is life, indeed,â The life I lose to gain death's larger life,â With all its needs and greeds and appetites, Its florid hungers, its satieties, Its humble hopes and gross credulities, Than the dark cup of Lethe to the soul?â A prison-house, in whose captivity The soul finds rest and slumber and reprieve? And now, no more! no more!âO nakedness! O desolation! O bereavement!âWhere, Where shall the Spirit now go home to rest From vigil in the twilight of the frontiers,â From the brave light and the persuading darkness, The boundless solitudes and passionless Immensities of the awakened self? ..... Where shall the soul go home? ..... And, even when At last the mind's abysmal darknesses Fill with some huge tranquillity of light, How, in that revelation, shall the soul Find place and reason and the forward path? ..... Where is there rest or comfort any more? And whither shall the tasked adventurer Find respite or reprieve? O nevermore, No-whither shall he find the breast of sleep! And know you well it is a bitter thing To dieâand in the thrilling solitude Of death, to liveâand labour, ever and ever Afoot and sleepless with the vision of truth! Life is a bitter thing to lose, and love And home and wife and child and happiness And rest and the contentment of mild joys And small achievements and brief brilliant glories:â These all are welcome and pleasurable things, And bitter things to lose! ..... And know you well It is a bitter thing to go adrift, Companionless and without pause or end, Into the vast dark spaces of the soul;â To dwell, sense-stripped and naked to the core, In the chill heights of man's divinity! ..... The PYTHIA as before God knows, and I, who dwell with God, I know Truth is a bitter thing to undergo; ..... And life's perfected metamorphosis From man to God shall hardly come to pass Save in exceeding travail and grief and pain. Only in anguish man is born again, Other and more and mightier than he was! ..... Only with strange and tragic ecstasies Of body and being, mind and heart, Life's human chrysalis Is torn asunder, and ruined, and rent apart, To loose man's winged divinity Into the light of truth, the skies of liberty! ..... Yet, tho' the birth-pangs of the soul, Which will live perfectly With labour in its own eternity, Are as the very agony of death,â God knows no fraction of the human whole Is there that wholly perisheth! Rather in his regard, whose human eye, After long vigil in thought's starlit sky, Calmly enspheres the equable and vast Clear circumspection of the eye of God,â Who has gone on his way where none before have trod,â Who, in a single vision, sees at last What was and is and what shall surely be,â Nothing of all man seems to lose is lost When man is slain in God's nativity! O, rather, whoso pays the utmost cost, All things in their degree To him in strict accounting profit most! The CHORUS Strophe I How, when, and wherefore does he profit most Who pays the utmost costâ Tears and blood, Labour and sacrifice, Anguish, bereavement, fear? How does he gain his life whose life is lost? For life is one and must alone suffice; For life is brief and time is like a flood Which no man has withstood; And God is silent, and He is not here To prove such ill things good. Antistrophe I How, why, and wherefore is it manifest How of these worst things can derive the best?â Joy from despair and strength from sacrifice; Freedom and clear tranquillities and faith From doubt and long, enslaved, laborious years; And gain from loss and God from man and life from death? What can be worth to man so great a price? Whence comes his profit when this price is paid? When all is over and done, is sung and said,â When life is waste and barren with blood and tears,â Whence shall the soul receive sufficiently? ..... What shall the soul receive for life's enforced catastrophe? ..... Strophe II There is no answer! God, if God there be, Hears not our voice or hears it silently. There is no answer save the one we give, Who have learned something, since we learn and live, And who are wise at least as men are wise. Have we not seen the glory of the skies, Felt the wide wonder of the shoreless sea,â And made our homes on earth, where we must be Whether we will or no? Have we not learned in bitterness to know It matters nothing what we deem or do, Whether we find the false or seek the true, The profit of our lives is vain and small? Have we not found, whatever price is paid, Man is forever cheated and betrayed?â So shall the soul at last be cheated after all! Antistrophe II Therefore we care not what the soul may gain Or what the soul may lose: Theirs be the doubt, who dream! We take the plain, Hard, certain way, and ask no great reward,â Knowing how much 't is certain, plain, and hard That by no wise invention or device May we in the least measure change or choose What our to-morrow brings. Wisely we ask no more than will suffice For life's least good and lowest reckonings. And thus, tho' we are troubled with many things, Yet to the soul's concern our hearts are cold; Tho' cheaply, day by day, our lives are sold, Yet are we cheerful with a little price. HERAKLES Coward and weak and abject! ..... O my Soul!â O God within meâgrave and perfect Lord Of life!âwhat passions, what rebellious tears, What wild, weak voice of longing and despair Have cried against thee in thy dwelling-place! How have I wronged thy courage, strength, and pride! What lamentable lies have lured my heart! What chill of blind alarm has tamed my blood! What sordid thrift, what weakness, what despair, Have poisoned all my being with lassitude! O human souls, my equals!âWell I know How like a plaintive and impoverished man, How scared and weak with old captivities, You have beheld and heard me!âYet, perchance, It may be even a brave man in his time May shed some tears for a whole high life's ruinâ And take no shame of it! A man may weep! ..... But God is in the soul! He wakes in me, And radiant in the dawn of light, uplifts A mighty voice of ineffable music,âwings Of song that rise where, round the heights of heaven, Cluster the throned beatitudes! ..... Behold! I am resolved to death, to tears and blood, To desolation and intolerable Bereavement,âto the worst that needs must be! And to the best, to new nativities, I am resolved! And I will stand apart, Naked and perfect in my solitude, Aloft in the clear light perpetually,â Having afforded to the uttermost The blood-stained, tear-drenched ransom of the soul! ..... Having by sacrifice, by sacrifice Severed his bondage and redeemed the Godâ The God I am indeed! For man is slain, And in his death is God illustrious, And lives! ..... And I will live, and sternly make The grandeur of my purpose manifest, And take my profit in the treasure-house Of truth, where none may enter save the Soul! ..... End of the Ninth Scene. TENTH SCENE Thebes. Before the house of HERAKLES. Nightfall. ALCMENA and MEGARA are seated by the threshold in the last, low light of sunset. The POET and the WOMAN stand in shadow by the house-wall. The CHORUS OF OLD MEN are seated by the steps of the Temple of Hera, at some distance. ALCMENA My life burns dimly, like a famished lamp Wasting at midnight, for my son's return..... MEGARA My life burns, and my love burns stedfast!âclear And calm and candid as a guarded flame Of assignation and of sacred vigil, Quietly in the casement of his home..... The WOMAN My life burns keenly, like a glutted fire Set at the pier-head by a wind-swept sea To be his land-fall and his harbinger! ..... MEGARA Like flowers unheeded in a desert place, The long days one by one wither away; The long nights, still and stainless, one by one Turn, with the wan, weak daybreak in their hair, Dismantled of its starry diadems, And, chill and livid as a lifeless face, Passâas the vast light strengthens and it dawns! ..... And day and night find me and leave me here, Where, solitary, about the open door, I wait for his return, and keep his house, And give his sons and mine lovingly bread And care and welfare and serenity. Yet, in despite of all I do, my life Seems like a fruitful field unharvested While he is far adventured and in peril About such secret business of the soul..... ALCMENA It is the virtue and necessity Of women, with such courage as we use, Thus, by the threshold and the fire-light, To serve life's large intent, and wait alone, Strong and undaunted, for the man to come, Who is abroad, eager with lusts and dreams And pastimes..... Thus the sane and serious strength Of life's true cause, in us exemplified, Patient in us, prevails and shall prevail. The WOMAN It is the virtue and necessity Of every soul to watch and wait alone, Patient and faithful, till the Saviour comes! ..... The POET Many shall come with gospels of salvation, Mysterious and august; with ecstasies And partial laws and rapt, peculiar creeds. Many shall come, with mystic loves and faiths, With strange conversions and perverted lusts, With formal beauties and facilities. Many shall comeâthe foolish, false and fond, The mystic and the meek shall comeâin vain! And He, at last,âsurely He, too, shall come! And we, who know him not,âwhat secret signs Shall prove him to our sense, shall specify The Knower of the secrets of all hearts, The single Truth Incarnate?âWhen He comes, How shall we know the Saviour?âwe, who learn, With all our pains, such scant and partial things! How shall His advent be revealed? What news, What news for the insatiable generations Eager of thought's transcendent enterpriseâ What tidings of redemption and reprieveâ What chart, what guidance, what discoveryâ What cup brimmed over from the Sacred Fountâ What apple from the gold Hesperidesâ What irrecusable witness shall He bring As earnest that His life has learned and loved And served the soul's austere necessities, And, for the liberal and resplendent Truth, Made an eternal mansion in the Soul? ..... The WOMAN Sternly and curiously of whoso comes, Well may we ask; for He shall surely bring The unimaginable and perfect proof! The POET Not He aloneâwe too must undergo The stringent doubt! Well may we ask, indeed, What tidings of salvation and the soul Has any man after his Great Adventure? ..... Well may we ask!âfor in our several hearts Surely the selfsame question probes us all, We, the Departed, who must soon return To that strange nameless Nothing whence we came..... Shall we return impoverished or, at last, Rich with the truth's serene prosperities? Shall we, to-morrow or to-morrow, turn Into the sunset and the early stars Brows branded with dishonour and defeat, Or, with the sacred monstrance of the soul's Excellent victory, elate and calm? Shall we return from life dismayed and dazed, Or quiet with an exceeding majesty, As God is in His garden of great stars, Where all things, each in its eternal kind, Minister to the welfare of the soul? ..... The WOMAN He is the Son of God; he is gone forth To find his Father in a better place; And he shall come with tidings of salvation And news of great concern for every soul. He is the Saviour: he shall fortify, He shall bear up and nourish and sustain All weakness, fears, and insufficiencesâ All incapacities like mine, and all Scrupulous infidelities like yours. He shall return so free that he shall find In you, in me himself exemplified, And give our wingless, anxious pilgrimage The audacious, free, far furtherance of his wings! ..... The CHORUS from the steps of the Temple Strophe I Verily, Thou and I And all men whatsoever who live and die, We are of one humanity; We are of one supreme infirmity, One gross resemblance, one result, one cause; We are as man has been before, And no man of us all is more, And no man of us all is free And master of the inexorable laws;â And all is always as it was, And so it evermore shall be! ..... We areâwho were not nor shall be again! Yet do we vainly live and vain are we; Vain is contentment and desire is vain And hope is fruitless as a blasted tree; Vain are the powers and labours of the brain; Vain are the pangs that shake the human breast; Vain is the body's brief felicity; Vain was our youth!âand when the sober years Leave us bereft and spent,âwhen more and more We feel, upon life's darkening, lonely shore, Violent and blind, the rising tide of tears,â Vainly we seek for refuge, long for rest! ..... Antistrophe I There is no refuge and no rest for us! Tho' in a myriad tongues and ways The old, wild voice of legend says, âThither He dwelt, and here of old He trod!â Yet does the thought and the desire of God Leave us impartial and incredulous. For we have seen how all things pass In sorrow, infirmity, and pain; How all is dust that comes to dust; How nothing is where nothing was; How thick beneath the pleasant grass Are strewn the corpses of the slain;â And strive however much we will We cannot find God's justice just! How shall we call Him Father still, Our Father, who returns us ill For good, and when we ask for bread Gives us a stone instead? How shall we weep to Him?âHe does not care! How shall we sing to Him?âHe does not hear! How shall we love Him?âfor He is not here! How shall we know if God, indeed, be there? ..... Rather, by God forsaken and forgot, Let us believe, at last, that He is dead, Or never was and now is not! ..... Strophe II Yea! to our sense, in life's fantastic trance, Nothing there is apparent more than blind Chance and mischance..... We drift like derelicts with the aimless wind Across the darkness of our ignorance..... Our lives were kindled like a flame; Nameless out of the nameless dark we came; And like a flame that will no longer burn Into the selfsame darkness we return! ..... Were we not then enraptured and unwise, Should we believe What the soul's secret whisper says, And strive to find, with vision-haunted eyes, Paths into Paradise, Where we might walk with God in all His ways? Shall we not rather patiently perceive, And with an unambitious mind, Man's witness to mankind Touching these matters of the soul's concern? Shall we not rather strive at last to learn How, wisely and ingloriously, to live? For we have seen, since human life began, How inconsiderable is man, How weak his mind's resolve, how brief his love, How vain his strivings and his flights have been, To find the freedom that he knows not of, The light of Truth his eyes have never seen..... Antistrophe II Did not, of old, Bellerophon Drive his winged courser up the stagnant night To find if in God's house there was any light, Or any welcome in God's house?âHe said, âThere, in my Father's house, is home. There, in His love's illimitable dome, Are many mansionsâand I am His son. And on my Father's breast There will I rest; There will I lay down my exhausted head, My broken heart, and there be cheered and stayed There will I walk with God In the calm ways that He is wont to tread, Quiet and undismayed..... There will I live, and live no longer here, Blind and deceived! What else is there to do, When all of life is questioned thro' and thro', Save with a solemn joy to question God and hear The splendour of His speech sing in my ear? ..... I am the Son of God!âand well I know The Son can do no trespass if he go Hardily where his Father's feet have trod. I am the Son of Man!âand I shall be Welcome within the Paradise of God. There shall He bend the Sacred Tree Of Knowledge, and auspiciously Gather the ripened fruit for me, And strike the rock of Death, and spread The waters of eternal life, and break the bread Of Truth's ineffable communion!ââ Thus he believed, and thus alone, Bellerophon, Launched on the quest, superbly rose, and rode All the long lonely way, almost to God's abode! ..... Till, at the threshold of eternity, He turned, and saw, and could not bear to see The veiled and voiceless vacancy of death, The blind abyss of human ignorance, Fathomless and immeasurable beneath! ..... His brain reeled and his heart failed!âSuddenly He knew his own shrill insignificance! Then, from the very sill Of the Unattainable Place, The lightnings of the blind and nameless Will Struck him down headlong thro' uncharted space; Until at lengthâ By the divine, immitigable fire Sapped in his spirit's inmost strength, Seared and corrupted to the core Of love and life and hope and all desireâ He lay dying by the sea's lamentable shore! ..... Thus was it then; with man 't is always thus!â So was it once with Icarus Who eyed the sun, And rashly took unto his spirit wings, And dared into the darkness, up and on, To find the secret and the sense of things, Where, in the eye of God, all stood revealed! ..... But, when the springs of knowledge were unsealed And Truth towered flaming on his sight, His pinions shattered in the lightâ And like an eagle slain in flight, He fell from where day promised and dawn was, Down the deep darkness, smooth and blind as glass, Irretrievably Into the all-receiving sea! ..... Epode Thus was it thenâyea, thus it always is! Man is an eyeless worm whose chrysalis Never, despite his utmost strength, is riven! In no rebirth, no metamorphosis, Is it to man's imperfect nature given To slough his gross humanity, and rise Godlike, and walk with God in Paradiseâ Free as God is, unconquerable and wise! His mind is like a haunted house Where veiled, vain figures walk in sleep; His heart, where death's bereavements weep, Where life's large, florid lusts carouse, Is aimless, like a withered leaf Vexed with love's vital wind of song; The purpose of his soul is long; The days of all his life are brief! And since we know not what is deathâ Since life isâsince the end is nearâ We care not who may come, we hear No longer what the Spirit saith! What tho' the Saviour come?âtho' deep Within the soul,âas well may beâ There where the peaks of thought rise steep And stedfast in eternity, Truth murmurs at its fountain-head?â We care notâfor our faith is dead; We hear notâlest our faith return;â Lest we believe the truthâand learn; Lest we believe the heartâand love; Lest we believe the soulâand dare, And strange disaster come thereof, Of pinions shattered in mid-air, Of ruin and desolation and despair! ..... Rather, since life is fugitive, And truth's assurance none can give, And no redemption makes us free, We care not, hear not, nor believe!â We live as man must always live; We are as man must always be..... The POET It is not, up the shoreless seas of night And thro' far twilights of the Mystery, The rash adventure and the reckless flight Of winged desires and dreams of liberty, Veered to no lodestar at truth's stedfast pole, Which can avail The serious, strong, ambition of the soul. The wings of man's brave ecstasies are frail; The passions native to the human breastâ The secret raptures which persuadeâ The unutterable longings which prevailâ Tried in the truth's tremendous test, Prove weak and daunted and dismayed. There is no swift and violent way, There is no near and friendly goal; There is a certain price to pay And certain profit for the soul, And certain justice!âwhen, at length, Clad in the heart's clear, human flame, Phrased in the mind and conscious of its aim, Man's inmost spiritual strengthâ No more wind-driven and sea-spent On the waste waters of his ignoranceâ Interprets life by his significance, And lives, and earns his true enfranchisement! ..... HERAKLES appears, almost invisible in the closing dusk of nightfall. The POET perceives him, and his song ceases. He leans forward, staring into the darkness. Silence. The POET with a great, sudden gesture toward the figure of HERAKLES Herakles!â HERAKLES intense and motionless It is I! ALCMENA My son!â The WOMAN My Saviour! MEGARA Herakles!â HERAKLES It is I! MEGARA starting toward him My Loveâ HERAKLES Be still! Stand back! Stand back! I know you not! The dark Closes you inâwhile round me and within me Abounds the perfect and perpetual light! Stand back! Be still! I am a soul withdrawnâ Shining and stark! ..... My strength is like a sword, And like a fire, and like a fearful doom! ..... I have stood solitary in the place of Godâ Solitary and august! ..... I know my willâ MEGARA Herakles! Herakles! ALCMENA My son!â HERAKLES Be still! Crowd not upon me, phantoms of the past! I am not whom you deem!âyou love me not!â You know not me!â To MEGARA I am not as I was, When last we felt in one another's breast, Strong at the core, the pulse of life abound! I am a strangerâyou are strange to me! The eyes, the eyes, shining with love upon me,â The thrilled, intense face and the tender word,â The tremulous, great joy of the stretched hands And the surrendered heart hailing me home,â These are no longer mineâmine to receive Or mine to give!âNo more, no more, for me, Is any human welcome in this world! ..... There in the Templeâthere, alone alone, I died! ..... And there I lived againâand thence I comeâand I shall soon depart, aloneâ Alone and nameless! ..... Had you means and will, Well might the Truth be cogent to your sense!â But I am like a pillar of pure flame Whose vision blinds and whose embrace destroys! MEGARA I love you, Herakles. HERAKLES You loved meâloved me When in the plaintive dusk of life I wasâ When I was dark and cold as dust!âI am Incarnate fire! I am the Householder, Who in the House of Life slept overlong And walked asleep in dreams..... And sleeps no more! And dreams no more!âYea! sleeps and dreams no more, Ghosts of a vanished dream! Bear witness, you Who see me; you who know me not, bear witness!â I am the Unknown God! ..... And therefore woe, Woe unto you all who hear me speak, Yet understand no sense of all my words, But love me for the slight glad man I was! Press not so all persuasively upon me, Lest you be rent as a wind-driven cloud! For whoso comes across my purpose or Assails my strength, he is by no means spared! Woe unto you all! ..... Woe unto me, Whom the Truth's justice pardons least of allâ Who am not yet at heart invulnerableâ Who am the Unknown God!âand therefore, therefore The scourge, the victim, and the agonist, The Saviour and the stricken sacrifice! .... The WOMAN The Saviour!â The POET Sacrifice?âthe sacrifice?â What shall I understand? O Messenger, Is Sacrifice your good report, your news Of great concern?âand how, in sacrifice, How is the cost cyphered and signified? HERAKLES Ask me no more! Be still!â The POET O Herakles, Is it the lifelong Labours? O, at last, Is victory prepared? Are you resolved At last to take the soul's task patiently, And rise by sure degrees from servitude In virtue of that work there is to doâ Gradual and long and constant as life isâ By which alone the soul exactly gains Mastery and manumission after all? Are you resolved and launched?âO Herakles, Are you upon the threshold and the path? Is it the start of all prosperities You herald as you say farewell to us?â Who, in the prison-house whence you go free, Having laid down your life for the true cause, Watch you depart into the stern, straight way And years of endless toil, with love and faith And exultation and heart-breaking joy! ..... O strength!âO toil!âO sacrifice!â HERAKLES Be still! Silence! You know me not! You cry aloud To craze me with the past's fantastic fearsâ Frantic insanitiesâEurystheus! ..... Speak No more! I tell you, in the House of God I stood alone, and there the man I was, Florid and perdurable and splendid, diedâ Died to revive!âand paid in sacrifice Once and for all the price of liberty! There is no toil, no servitude, for me! I, who by one preÃ«minence of strength, By one extravagance of sacrifice, Have wrought life's final metamorphosis, And thus become as God is, without bond Or any taint of man's infirmitiesâ What need have I to labour any more? I, who have known myself perfectible, And dared and died, curious of consummationsâ Died to the world, and in the soul revived, Friendless and free, inviolate and divine;â I, who have gone the uttermost way of all Ambition, and resolved a strict farewell To all less things than the one perfect thing;â I, who have seen tremendously across The ruins of my ruthless sacrifice, Thought's stately promise of perfection bear The ripened fruit of its accomplishment;â What labours are there more for me to do? ..... The POET How can the labours cease while life remains? Life is the heart's occasion, and the soul's Supreme emergency! .... HERAKLES to himself O patience, patience, Desperate heart! Patience, distracted brain! Patience!â To the POET O be advised, I say, to silence! Man cannot dream at all what may betide! ..... Even as we speak together, it well may beâ Roused and released by some chance senseless wordâ The universal Will shall strike athwart Your crossed, frail threads of heart-sick human life, And rend them all asunder! ..... O, be sure I am resolved! Surely, if needs must be, I will make life stark naked as a flameâ Yea, void and ruined as a flame-swept place! ..... I say, well may destruction come!âand who, Who else shall perish of it, save they whose hearts Love has made vulnerable? ..... What fumes of blood, What savour of slain men, what reek of carnage God may demand, I know not! ..... MEGARA Herakles! Herakles! HERAKLES Youâbe silent most of all! This is a deadly peril! ..... I know you not! ..... Take away your eyes and your importunate face! You are too curious of meâGo! Go! Go! I say no tongue can tell what may betide..... I am deadâand I have risen from the dead, And come again to you after some days; And I am other than I ever wasâ And you I know not, and I love you not! What tho' you were my dearest of life's best, My love, my wife, the mother of my sons, My very children, innocent and mildâ Natheless I know you and I love you not! O, hark!âhark!âhark!âhow the shrill demon criesâ Naming you with an old, persistent grief, And tremulous, long lamentations! ..... MEGARA Hark!â Hark!âhow the voice of love cries out within you! Hark!âhow the voice of truth and justice criesâ Naming your wife, your mother, and your sons, Who know you, love you, and forsake you notâ And will not be forsaken! Who am I?â Who are my children?âWell you know our worth! Can you bereave them and abandon me? I am no casual woman of your lust; They are no bastards born of harlotry. I am the grave companion of your life; I am your equalâand your sons are mine! We are the candour and the tenderness Of homeâyour home!âand we are yours, are yoursâ And may not thus be outraged and disclaimed! HERAKLES Why will you cry out in the darkness, words I will not hearâO ghosts!âO plaintive ghosts!â Ghosts of the vanished dreamâthe dream of life? Why will you cry out in the darknessâwhen The lightnings are at hand which shall dispel, With fire and devastation and despair, Spectres and plaintive voices and vain things? ..... Beware! lest you may learn how stern and strange And violent is the just clear voice of doom! Beware! Beware! You are the living sign Of an ignoble bondage and a will Too lax with pleasure and emolument To rise to the sheer heights of life's occasion! Therefore beware! be still!âYour voice allures me..... You would betray me..... I will hear no more! MEGARA Verily, in the light of life's real need, Your words say nothing to my sense. I know My worth and yours; I know my sons and yours Sleep in your house, secure in you and me. Look at me well!âfor I have borne your children, And tenderly and with an infinite joyâ In nights of vigil when the exhausted flesh Cried out for rest, and in laborious days Of unremitting care and cheer and loveâ Reared them to life and laughter, liberty And light, and generous grandeurs of the spirit, And exultations of the heart, and strong Joys of the body; and maintained your house; And made my life's concern of them and you! Look at me well!âWill you abandon me? Will you bereave me of my love and joy? Shall I be left defenceless and despised, Haply the prey and victim of chance wars In which I well may come to servitude, Sweat like a harlot in some conqueror's bed, And, in a sheer excess of misery, Die of a vile and self-inflicted death? ..... ALCMENA swiftly enters the house of HERAKLES. HERAKLES I know you now!âI know you as you are! You would betray meâyou would rouse within me Passions and vile estrangements from the soul! ..... But there is of my strength sufficiently Now to withstand youâYea! if needs must beâ ALCMENA reappears, bringing with her the three SONS OF HERAKLES. They go to their mother. HERAKLES almost in frenzy Take away the children!âTake away the children!â MEGARA Yea! These are your sons!âWill you cast off your own? Will you forsake, will you abandon them? What?âshall the sons of Herakles be left Victims to man's injustice and the scorn Of an oppressive, vile, injurious world? What?âshall the sons of Herakles be bowed By shame, by slander outraged, and by greed And violence shorn and spoiled, enslaved or slain? They are the sons of Kings; they are your sons, The sons of Herakles!âShall they be left, Helpless and weak, to lose the throne of Cadmus? O look upon us well, as we stand here! And know our worth and power,âand know your own Heart's longing! ..... HERAKLES ..... vile estrangements! ..... stratagems! Beware! Beware! Would you betray me thus? Know that I will not be seduced, enslaved, Corrupted and made captive by your means!â And take away the children!âtake them from me!â Is there no mercy? ..... Shall it come to this? ..... MEGARA How shall we not withstand you, O my Love, Since you do evil in your heart and lie? Witness!âwe have no selfish will with you, But the pure purpose of life's sacred cause, Here in my sons incarnateâand in me. There is no stronger purpose, and no cause More pure and perfect. Yea! we must prevail, Since, with the strength, in us exemplified, Of all life's cosmic and immutable will, Now we traverse your madness and your wrong! HERAKLES The Lightning falls! ..... Hear you the thunders peal? ..... See you the keen, swift flame striking to slay? ..... Nothing avails! ..... Nothing avails! ..... All's saidâ All's over and said! ..... and one thing is to do, One violent and intolerable deed Of Sacrifice!âtill the white altar glows Crimson and shining in the white, clear light;â Till the salt savour and the fumes of blood Rise in the boundless air's tranquillity;â Till the relentless sleepless Spirit knows There is no human shadow and no bond To dim its Truth, to thwart its Liberty! HERAKLES grasps his great bow and takes an arrow from his quiver. MEGARA Why do you fix me with such bestial eyes Of madness and revenge? With a great cry ..... The children! HERAKLES Death! He fits an arrow to the bow. MEGARA He will destroy the children! The POET He is mad! He is stark mad! He seizes HERAKLES, but is thrown to the ground, where he lies, stunned. MEGARA ..... The children! HERAKLES Death! ALCMENA My boy!â Herakles! MEGARA Herakles!âthe children!â HERAKLES Death! ALCMENA These are your sons, your wifeâ MEGARA âyour little children! Mercy! ..... ALCMENA Have mercy!âHerakles!âMy son!â Oâ MEGARA Spare the children!âSpare the children!â HERAKLES Death! He draws his bow and kills the children one by one as they are crying for mercy. First CHILD Father!âNo! ..... No! ..... Dies. Second CHILD Save me!âMother!â Dies. Third CHILD Father!â Father!â MEGARA throwing herself upon the bodies of her sons My children! ..... O my doves! ..... My Children! ..... HERAKLES Rather rejoice! rejoice! Is not the deed Accomplished? Blood, the blood of Sacrificeâ The dear heart's blood! ..... Behold, these were my children!â These were my little children!âyet I slew And spared not! God is not more pitiless, More perfect and inexorable! ..... Rejoice! These were my children!âand she too shall die As they have died! None shall betray me, none Resist me, none persuade me..... ALCMENA Herakles! MEGARA O my children! ..... O my children! ..... O my children! ..... HERAKLES grasping his sword and rushing upon her Silence! Silence! Silence!âDeath! Death! Death!â O let there be rejoicing, for God's sake! Set the strong hand unto the sword, and slay! ..... And slay! ..... And slay! ..... Suddenly he sways and falls insensible to the ground. ALCMENA .. My boy! ..... My boy! ..... MEGARA ..... My children! End of the Tenth Scene. ELEVENTH SCENE Thebes. Before the house of HERAKLES. Some weeks have elapsed since the close of the preceding scene. MEGARA and ALCMENA sit together near the door of the house. The WOMAN sits upon the steps of the Temple of Hera, at some distance. ALCMENA I, who am almost lifeless as the dead,â Who liveâif this long vigil of despair Is lifeâas he lives who was born my son, Anguished and spent with ecstasy and pain,â Have kept this blasted fragment of my life Day after day by the disused, dumb door, That if he lives and is not dead and dares Return and comes out of his solitude, Damned and defeated, shattered and diseasedâ Who was above all men superb and strong!â He shall not lack the refuge of one heart At least:âand still for him my heart is sanctuary! Where else, indeed, should he find room to weep, Save on this withered breast that gave him suck? What heart should be to him compassionate, Faithful and fond in sickness as in health, If mine were notâof whose essential blood He was compounded and made quick and whole? He is my son!â The WOMAN He is my Saviour! ALCMENA When, When shall he come? No longer, as at first, We hear him, like an inarticulate thing, Dreadfully in the darkness crying aloud..... He is alone and silent..... He is silent..... He is alone..... How is it with him now, There in the desolation of his house? Is he become a speechless idiot Who, gibbering, glares about the vacant rooms, Inhuman, scared, distraught, day after day? ..... Rather, it well may be, the worst and last Ecstasy of the soul's despair is silent! ..... Yet there are times in my exhausted brain, When, with a sense almost of rest and peace, I do believe my boy is dead...... The WOMAN He lives. He shall return. MEGARA My sons shall not return! ..... ALCMENA The maniac and the dead return no more!â Theirs is the better part! MEGARA My boys are dead...... ALCMENA Only dead are fortunate! MEGARA My dovesâ My little children, tender and very youngâ My childrenâO my children!âWhere are they? All desolately dead!âall violently And vilely dead, abominably murdered, Pitiably and strangely slain!âmy brave, my strong, Beautiful children! ..... O my sons! ..... The WOMAN He lives. ALCMENA Happily not! ..... I will believe he lives No more..... MEGARA He cried out like a blood-sick beast, And slew them, one by one!âtheir father slew them! And they are gone, my white and innocent doves!â Gone! ..... gone! ..... I saw the dreadful majesty Of Death smooth their still faces, and their lips Were dumb, and in their eyes there was no light..... He slew themâone by one! ALCMENA ..... and we are left Alive! MEGARA ..... and life shall never cease to be A blasted thing, a bitter broken ruin, An utter and unendurable bereavement! ..... There is no end to the abominable Agony! ..... They are deadâmy sons!âand he, My Herakles, my love,âhe is not dead! He lives and lurks within the empty house, A mouthing idiot, crouching like a beast, Sullen and fierce and frenzied in his lair! ..... ALCMENA Nay, I believe, indeed, my boy is dead, As they are dead, who were well-nigh my childrenâ Happily dead out of this desperate world! Let us believe at least he lives no more; Rather, with joy, let us believe him dead! For then with joy we too might soon depart Where there is no more madness and no pain; Where, in the Silence, God's dominion ends; Where there is sleep which neither wakes nor dreams..... Only the dead are fortunate!âI know Life is an ill no mortal strength can bear! What man could be more mighty than he was? What heart more great? what soul more excellent?â Yet is he failed and fallen and overcome, Body and heart and soul! ..... O fortunate, Fortunate are they who have died so young! At least they shall not fall, like Herakles, Out of a perfect and a prosperous manhood Into foul pits of madness and despair; Nor live to sit, bereft and blind with tears, On the charred ruins of a wasted life, As I doâwho am mother to them all! The WOMAN Herakles! Herakles!âHe shall return! He lives! ALCMENA Be still! MEGARA My sons are dead! ..... ALCMENA My boy Is dead!âAnd I remember, I remember How he was radiant and tender, proud, Passionate, dauntless; how his eyes were grave And clear..... And I remember little things Of him..... And I believe a woman dies When she remembers, as I do, such things, Such simple, poignant, childish memories, Of a dead child! ..... MEGARA ..... She dies, I know she dies! THE POET appears. The POET O theatre of perpetual desolationâ Scene of the soul's last tragedyâwhere death And ruin and dread, inexpiable deeds Conspired with madness to the soul's defeat!â O dumb deserted house of lamentation, Sepulchre of the soul!âand you, and you, Mourners before the sepulchre, poor hearts!â What can console you or redeem you now? Nothing avails, I know, nothing avails! For all is lost: there is no prosperous Expectancy, no refuge any more! ..... Therefore I will not vex you with vain words; I will but weep with you, and thenâfarewell! Farewell, O broken-hearted women, rent And splintered wreckage from the seas of life, Stranded upon the sterile sands of sorrow Beside the bitter, barren fields of death! Here have I nothing more to do but weepâ Therefore I will not stay. Yet, O be sure I understand you with a passionate grief! For IâI too have suffered of these things And shared with you some portion of your pain! ..... Yet will I say farewell, for now the long, Supreme desire, within me, and the faith That will not rest, revive: my soul once more Animates to its own emergency. Life and its endless future enterprise Call me. I feel the longing in my heart Of new departures and the liberty Of open skies, great winds and solitudeâ Of starlight on the mountains and calm seas At sunset and wide mornings of the world! ..... Farewell, O dispossessed and desolate hearts!â He turns his face toward the house of HERAKLES. And you, who filled the measure of my hopes Of man, and roused raptures of emulationâ Farewell! He turns to the WOMAN. But youârise up! Not all is lost! O let the dead bury their dead! ..... Your place And mine are with the living! Come away Out of this charnel-house! Perpetually Of all slain things fresh flowers and fruits are made, When the new mind of man in the new world Of thought's discovery tills virgin fields, And the new future like a harvest blooms..... Now is the ripe occasion. Leave the tears Unshed, the dead unburiedâcome away! We have so very little time to live, To solve the secret and discern the lightâ Such insufficient, fretful hours of dawn And day and dusk in which to hurry on, Home-sick and sick at heart, like strayed, sad children;â And Home is far, and the great Nightfall comes! ..... Rise! Rise! The shattered lamp gives light to none! All is postponed when death and madness come; And we who live, we have no time to wait! We face the Future! ..... He is, with his peers, Drawn down the sunless vortex of the Past..... Bellerophon is fallen; Icarus Is fallen; Phaethon is fallen;âhe Is fallen! Yea, immedicably his heart Is cancered and his soul withered and spent! And there is nothing in an idiot's brain Save the unendurable nothingness of death! ..... The WOMAN rising to her feet He shall return! He lives! He is not mad! He shall returnâ The POET âshattered or mad or dead! The WOMAN I say, he lives! I say, his mind is whole! I tell you he shall come again in power, Stronger and more serene, more sane, more wise, Self-mastered, certain of his path and goal, Radiant and unashamed, inspired, resolved! ..... He shall returnâ The POET You speak fantastic things. There is no hope, no secret that absolves; No mystic resurrection; no rebirth;â That were too terrible! ..... MEGARA Too terrible! ..... Here in his madness he destroyed my sonsâ His children! Here he fellâhe shall not rise! Forever and forever his soul is damned; His life is wasted as spilt wine; his heart Rent like a blasted tree! ..... My desolation Is faultless! ALCMENA He shall never rise from this Abyss, this degradation, this despair..... O, let us all believe that he is dead! I dare not think he lives!âfor then, indeed, Then, if the door were opened, we should see Not him we know, my strong and splendid sonâ Rather God knows what spent, deformed, dread thing, What nameless monsterâ MEGARA âwhat poor beast of prey, Blackened with blood! The POET What crazed, cringed human ruin!â Suddenly the door of the house of HERAKLES opens. HERAKLES stands upon the threshold, calm, grave, erect, and strong. A moment of breathless silence. Then, The WOMAN with a great cry Herakles! Herakles! My Saviour!âSee, My lamp still burns! ..... And now the Bridegroom comesâ At last! ALCMENA rising up, blind with tears My boy!âMy son!âMy Herakles!â The POET Herakles?âHerakles?âWhat miracle?â What alchemy?âHe comes, serene and strong, Mailed in the grave, fine gold of victory! Who can believeâ MEGARA wildly The lie is palpable! Grim and fantastic phantom of the pastâ Herakles?âNo, it must not be! Reply!â What cheat is this?âO what abominable, Cruel, and senseless trickery is this? His ghost returnsâbut where is Herakles? Where is the madman and the murderer? HERAKLES I am the madman; and the murderer I am; and I am Herakles; and I, I am the Resurrection and the Life, I am the Soul, whose inmost virtue is Thus to outlive destruction and return, Valid with Truth's perennial victory!â Thus to survive, despite of life and death, With awful strength, the throes of man's despair, The unremitting madness and defeat And grim disaster of his mortal days!â Thus, with the flame of truth's unfailing lamp, To light aloft its calm, inflexible way, There where his human vision, blind with tears, Sees only, in the nether gulf of grief, Vacancy and the windy darkness!âthus To pass with man thro' all the flames of Hell, Till the crude ore of his humanity, Purged of its dross, refined and purified, Yields, unalloyed, its bright immortal gold!â And thus, in power and splendour and dominion, To rise from man's wild weakness calm and strong; To sing in man's disconsolate heart; to find Faith in man's abject infidelities; To make of man's infirmities the means Of victory; to be imperishable; To realize God in self and strength; to save And serve and striveâtill man is overcome!â Till the immortal energy of Life, Transfigured with its own divine intent, Evolves still further to its perfect end! ..... I am the soulâthe inmost, immanent, Real and essential core of lifeâ MEGARA And I?â I, who have all my life long lived in love And mild beneficent deeds and ways of beingâ I, who am innocent, God knows!âshall I Be as I am, forever a blasted thing, Derelict, wrecked and spent in heart and soul, While you, befouled with blood and infamy, Rise like a God triumphant out of Hell?â Shall I be damned and you be saved?âNo! No! Surely there shall be justice after allâ Justice at least!âsince there is neither love Nor mercy nor compassion in God's heart..... There shall be justice!âjustice!â HERAKLES In the dark, I have endured your anguish; and my heart Is broken; and it breaks again for you! Verily, verily, in my solitude, Mine was a mightier agony than yours!â Were they not mine, the failure and the deed? Therefore I know how mad the truth must seem Now to your sense, as then it seemed to mineâ How mad, how darkâand O, how terrible! ..... MEGARA Justice! ..... There shall be justice! ..... HERAKLES Truth is just. And truth prevails, relentless and revealed Between us:âI, the living; you, the lost..... Only the soul survivesâonly the soul Whose self and substance are the living truth! Therefore am I redeemed. MEGARA O Herakles! ..... HERAKLES Megara!âO my dear, I know, I know! ..... Love was your virtue and your life; and I, Even I have choked the fountains of your being And left your love bereft, and one by one Shattered your heart-stringsâtill at last there is No breath of music in you any more! ..... MEGARA No love, no light, no breath of life, no being!â I am a cracked flask whence the wine of life Is drained away to the least, utmost drop Into the new-turned furrow of their graves! ..... You know not how it is at all with me: I tell you I am dead as a quenched fire; Dead as the dreadful eyes of a slain man; Dead as the blue blank face of a drowned child;â Dead as my sons are dead!âYea, more than they! ..... Deadâdeadâdead to the core! ..... HERAKLES So am I dead.â I, who was once the man you loved and knew! It is not Iâit is the Soul, the Truthâ It is the God who dwells and reigns within meâ God, whom I am when all His work is done!â Who is so sternly indestructible, Who is not ruined and shattered and undone, Poisoned at life's perpetual fountain-head, Damned and abased and irretrievably Crushed and corrupted even to the core of being By this incredible, bestial infamy, My madness fostered and my hands fulfilled! ..... It is not I, it is not Heraklesâ It is the Truth, which has no heart to breakâ Truth, which inures by labour after all!â It is the Soul, whose inmost life and strength Are of so pure and terrible a temper That even against the iron door of Death They are not dulled, and when the stone-blind eyes Of Destiny shed lightnings that consume The very being and heart and mind of man, They are not seared or shaken or appalled! It is the thirst and hunger of the Spirit Which, with a longing so relentless, crave The bread and wine of truth's communion, That, tho' the wine be mixed with blood and tears, The bread with madness poisoned, and despair, They will not be denied to feed the soulâ Which finds its nourishment and lives and thrives And grows out of great error by such means! O verily, verily the human thing I wasâthe man who once was Heraklesâ After this wild, irreparable wrong, This cruel, senseless, irremediable Accident of my own infirmitiesâ Is dead, is damned, is shattered, is destroyed! ..... Know me at last, Megara, Megara! Behold me naked and ruined as I am!â All that makes human life desirable; All that sustains and comforts and consoles; All that the years can give from birth to death Of perishable, profound, pure happiness, And honour, and the clear, sweet, tranquil sense Of innocence, and sane, beneficent deeds;â All, all is lost! ..... Yet when I rose at last, In anguish, from the horror and abysm Of lunacy, scanted, despoiled, bereftâ A shattered, beggared, blasted man!âand cried With a terrible voice for the inevitable Mercy of deathâit came not! ..... and I knew My strength! ..... and clear and grave within, I heard, Thro' the tremendous silence where the dead Cumbered the stricken field of my defeat, The soul's voice sound victoriously! ..... I saw The inscrutable skies of thought stand wide asunder, Splendid with stars! ..... And then I knew, I knew That all was lost!âfor man shall lose his life To gain his lifeâand more than all was found!â Found was the sense and source and strength of life; Found was the way, the light, the truthâthe soul! The POET Who can believeâ HERAKLES Bear witness to the Truth! This is the secret I survive to tell: To him who hath abundance shall be given; From him who hath not shall be taken away Even that which he hath! MEGARA âMy love! ..... My children! ..... HERAKLES Only the soul survivesâand I survive, Hardly and terribly enough! But now, Now with a nameless sense of faith and fear, Of grandeur and dismay and stern resolve, I know I am invulnerableâI know Life shall endure, life shall evolve in me!â In me essential metamorphoses, Phases and transformations of the soul! In me new strengths and new validities! In me conceptions, pangs, and pregnancies, Labours and parturitions, throes of change, Forms and conversions of the element! In me new germs and new survivals, new Mutations, new futurities! In me Perfections, consummations, alchemies! In me new life!âIn me exemplified, New life, more real, self-conscious and divineâ Perfect, immediate and complete at last! I am the Life of life; I am the Soul; I am the strength, the flux, the growth, the trend; I am the future and the hope of man! ..... MEGARA You? ..... And my hope, my future,âwhere are they? ..... The POET I will believe when all is justifiedâ Only when all is served and saved and done. Many shall see, some shall proclaim the truth: Who shall perform the truth? Who shall descend, Wearing undimmed the starlight on his brows, And, with the soul's serene, essential strength, Toil in dark valleys of this human world? Who shall perform the Labours, and in all The days and ways and destinies of life, Bring his perfection perfectly to pass?â What of the Labours, Herakles? CREON and AMPHITRYON appear, followed by soldiers and populace. ALCMENA âThe King! CREON Heraklesâ MEGARA Justice!âJustice!â AMPHITRYON Herakles..... The POET Only the truth is just. The WOMAN He is the Truth. CREON Wisdom is justifiedâ AMPHITRYON My son! ..... HERAKLES The truthâ Only the truth is justified! CREON The truth?â What is the truth? HERAKLES I am the living Truth. CREON turning to the people There is no strength nor power but in God, Children of Cadmus!âWitness and believe! Him you behold is Herakles, the man More than a man in fortune and renown, Virtue and strength, resolve and valiant deeds. You will recall how yesterday he seemed Throned in a splendid, sole preÃ«minence, Pattern of men and favourite of Gods And flower of manhoodâenvied of the world! So was he once superb! ..... Behold him now! There can be now in all the world no man So mean, so warred upon by Destiny, So desperate as to envy Herakles! Children of Cadmus, for that vengeance is Of God and wisdom is denied to manâ For that the strength of Herakles was more Than human, and his virtue and resolve More than the virtue and resolve of menâ For that his soul grew emulous of God And strove with Godâtherefore the hand of God Fired his brain with madness, and he fell!â Fell as a star falls, swiftly, and is spent; Fell beyond all resource or hope..... And now, Children of Cadmus, now behold him well, Infamous, abject, desperate, and say One to another, âThis is Herakles!â ..... HERAKLES Say what you will, you shall not change the truth. CREON Children of Cadmus, witness and believe!â Witness the will of God exemplified; Witness the soul's expectancy reproved; Witness, believe, and learnâas all we must!â Still to walk humbly in the fear of God. So will I doâand strive as best I may To follow in God's ways where they may go. Therefore am I resolvedâseeing, in wrath, The hand of God heavy upon this manâ To cast him forth, unpurified, alone, In the damnation of his monstrous guilt, To wander in perpetual banishment! ..... A brief silence. HERAKLES Children of Cadmus! I have loved the truthâ I have beheld the truthâI am the Truth! Once to the world and you I bade farewell: I was a lover then, and the Beloved, Shining afar, leaned to my soul's embrace!â I was a Seer then, and in mine eyes The visionary light kindled and cleared!â I lovedâI sawâI bade farewellâand yet I could not go!âI merely loved and saw! Love may persuade and light may guide the soul: It is the work we do which shall avail!â Only the workâthe labours of the spirit Wrought in the living substance of the truth! Therefore I could not go when once before, Dazed and deceived, I bade you all farewell. But now, deliberate and determined, now, Sane and serene, I well may take my leave; For now at last I am indeed, indeed, Gone from you all a long and bitter wayâ Stumbled and groped and climbed, with bloody feet And dreadful clutching hands, above you all! ..... It was the rough, dark pathway of my strength Which was not skilled to any other road, Yet did not fail me when my spirit knew Its utmost need, and which survives entire, Inflexible and irresistible, Nourished and nerved to new necessities! I am become the vehicle of life's Infinite aspirationânow at last Shaped to its perfect, true, divine intent..... CREON Silence! Your brain is still diseased and dark. Therefore depart, alone and unabsolved! HERAKLES I ask not absolutionâthere is none! There are no lustral waters in this world Can cleanse me of their blood or take away The stigma of their murder! As I am, So I depart into the future, so I make life's issue of the soul! Behold! I am the Hero and Protagonist Of life, the Pioneer of life's true cause! I am the Sacrifice! My purse must pay The long, incalculable arrears of man's Folly and ignorance and wrath and wrongâ The price of truth, the ransom of the soul! For, as with you and all men, so with me: The life my father and my mother gave me Was all compounded of the sins and woes, Passions and appetites, credulities, Cruelties, lies, hypocrisies of man! So were my home, my happiness, my hope, Builded of frailty and the stuff of dreams..... Therefore they fell! But in the abject dust, See! how the soul's pure gold of truth shines out, More radiant, more resplendent, more revealed In the broad, roofless day of devastation Than ever it was in the kind, tranquil light Of life's content and blind security! And see! O see!âinto the light, the lightâ There where before stood the safe walls of homeâ What liberal, lonely spaces stretch afar, Endless and unrestricted, to persuade The homeless soul to new discoveriesâ New labours! ..... The POET Labours?â HERAKLES I assume the task! Mine are the labours, for the wage is mine! The POET The Laboursâof Eurystheus? HERAKLES They are mine!â Mine are the weakness, ignorance, and lust; Mine is the mean, harsh longing of dominion; Mine are the crime and cowardice of man; Mine is the soul of manâthe self of God! And there shall be no vile or violent thing Left uninformed of my divinity! ..... Therefore the Labours!âfor the soul must strive, The God must serve, until His virtue is, In man's degraded being and abject heart, In man's deformed, incurious, haunted mind, In man's gross greed and dull brutalities, Illustrious and exemplified!âtill truth, Loved and proclaimed, at last is lived and known! Farewell! HERAKLES departs. The people, with gestures of horror, draw aside, as tho' in fear of contamination, to let him pass. The POET At last! ..... At last! ..... ALCMENA My boy! ..... AMPHITRYON My son! ..... MEGARA with a great cry My Herakles! ..... The WOMAN to the POET Haste! Haste! The best begins! He is before usâlet us go! The POET You love The truthâI see the truth.âHe is the Truth! Tho' it avail us nothing, let us go! The POET and the WOMAN turn and depart. End of the Eleventh Scene. TWELFTH SCENE The Caucasus. A lofty mountain-peak rising in pinnacles of naked rock. On a narrow ledge, PROMETHEUS stands erect, chained to the face of the cliff. Before his feet the mountain falls sheerly away to green pastures far below, which slope steeply to a narrow beach of bright sand. The horizon of the sea closes the vast prospect. On either hand the trend of the coast, bordered by mountains, meadow and forest, field and stream, stretches in a vast curve indefinitely outward into the distance. Landward, as far as the eye can reach, rise high mountains clothed with forests and interspersed with fertile valleys. It is a calm, clear evening, about half an hour before sunset. The sun hangs flaming over a windless sea and in a cloudless heaven. The moon just shows over the eastward hills. In the western sky there is one star. The vast figure of the TITAN stands motionless and superb in the full splendour of the setting sun. In the time elapsed between this and the preceding scene, HERAKLES has accomplished all his great Labours except the voyage to the Hesperides. PROMETHEUS The night returnsâand still Prometheus Wears on his limbs the chains He forged in Hell. The night returnsâand soon the Bird of God Returneth ravening to his massacre. The night returnsâand God is in His Heaven, Throned in the world's dominion..... Once again, As when I fared up the prodigious night And seized the Torch out of His Holy House, Round his resplendent Being in Paradise, I seem to feel the everlasting Light Blend with the voice of the invisible choirs Thro' mansions of perennial festival..... The night returnsâand God is in His Heaven, And fear and anger vex the heart of God, Brooding on me and my indomitable Rebellion and the soul's validity; While far below men kindle in their hearths And hearts the Fire I gave, giving them life! These were my works! I have achieved, God knows, Somewhat of everlasting worth and real Significance!âGod knows and life records My hazardous and unalterable deeds! Mine was the cosmic issueâand in me The purpose of the inexorable will Of life, the process of the endless flux, The motion of the universal being, Found its assured, victorious utterance! I was, in the beginning of the world, Where there was only desolation, death, Dismay and darkness,âwhere the lives of men Were vile and violent like the lives of beasts;â And I alone found out the Great Idea, Found the supreme and secret meaning out; And I alone found out the forthright way Of man's deliverance, and restored the light, And made of life a lovely and human thing, And gave the soul divine and pregnant dreams! ..... Man was reborn in me!âand therefore God, Jealous and fearful, came in wrath against me, Binding me captive, whom He could not slay, Here on this cliff, where His malignant hate, Burning thro' Ã¦ons of unrecorded time, Visits me with intolerable wrongs. Yet, tho' I wear His chains, and even now The Eagle wheels aloft, scenting his carnage, Still is my heart's inviolate hope serene And undismayed; still life reveals its trust; Still and forever I keep the Faith, and still Bear and believe the testament of Truth. The victory was mine and mine shall be The victory!âthe first and last and best Are mine! I saved mankind and now, in turn, Man shall conceive, in his maturity, My Saviour and my Comrade and my Lord! Therefore I stand, invincible, and wait, Solitary and august and unafraid, As he must be whose witness to mankind Is of the free divinity of man. Therefore I waitâfor He shall surely come! And when He comes, with gospel on His lips And revelation in His eyes and power And liberty shining in either hand, He shall not find me crushed and overborne!â Rather, safe-guarded by the constancy Of an unwearied spirit and dauntless heart, Shall He, at last, as from a father's hands, Receive the Soul's unconquered citadel! HERAKLES appears somewhat higher up in the mountain. He advances to the sheer edge of the precipice and pauses, gazing out over the world. From where he stands PROMETHEUS is invisible. HERAKLES Hither away are the Hesperidesâ Hither away is hopeâhither away The heart of life yearns unto Paradise! ..... Hither away the insatiable will Of life, grown conscious of its aim, intends New liberations, new supremacies, New powers and new ineffable dominions And new aggrandizements of being and life's New utterance of the soul's new testament! Hither away is the new enterprise Of thought; the endless wind, hither away, Strains out the sails of the mind's caravel;â The stars, the sunrise and the land-fall are Out in the dark ..... beyond ..... hither away! ..... Hither away love is a lovelier thing And of more majesty and mightier: Nerved to the temper of supreme ambitions, Filled with achievement, flushed, immediate, fainâ Yea, all of profit and service to the soul! Hither away is Truth more excellent, Freedom more absolute, conception more Creative, life more ample and lordlier, Knowledge more vastly and serenely sphered In new dilate horizons of calm light, Faith more secure and Justice more divine! Hither away is the New Future!âwhere The harvest of the sowing of spent lives Shall feed new generations, and suffice To sow new fields and ripen and provide The Living Bread of new prosperities..... Hither has labour brought me; and away,â Wise from the past with new proficiencies, Single and resolute and well-matured To new activities, new avatars And new validities,âthe strength of life, Spent all in conscious service to the soul, Shall bring me on ..... and on ..... hither away Into the Kingdom and the Power and the Glory, Into the whole inheritance of man! ..... O not in vain have I been up and down In the whole earth, and seen the imperial East Whose florid cities shine under the sun With banners and dyed raiment and red gold, And in the wide, wild West wandered to where, Round the scarped, savage, wind-swept verge of the world, The heavy headlands stand into the sea! ..... O not in vain, from the Iberian hills To Themiscyra, from the Libyan waste To the Thessalian plain, my feet have trod The sea, the mountain and the wilderness; My strength and skill have brought the outlawed beasts Into subjection, and, with civil arts And fine express proficiencies and grave Liberal manners, cultured and endowed With spirit and substance and significance The shy, fierce lives of vagrant, bestial men! O not in vain I served and sacrificed, Loved and was lonely, and, in mighty works, Extolled the Spirit, and practised and professed Tender and excellent humanities And the victorious virtues of the soul! And not in vain, out of the night of Hell, I drew the Hound of Hell, the ravening Death, Into the light of life, and held him forth Where the soul's sun shed lightnings in his eyes And he was like a thing of little meaning, Powerless and vain and no-wise terribleâ While with my inmost heart I laughed aloud Into the blind and vacant face of Death, And cast him from me, so he fled away Screaming into the darkness whence he came! ..... Nothing is vain of all that I have done! I have prevailed by labours and subdued All that man is below his utmost truth, His inmost virtue, his essential strength, His soul's transcendent, one preÃ«minence! Yea, I have brought into the soul's dominion All that I am!âand in the Master's House There is no strength of all my mortal being That does not serve Him now; there is no aim, There is no secret which He does not know; There is no will save one, which is the Lord's! ..... PROMETHEUS calling with a mighty voice O unutterable ecstasy of hope! ..... O Son of Man! ..... HERAKLES Who calls me? Who is here, Sharing my solitude? PROMETHEUS O Son of Man!â O Herakles!âI am Prometheus! HERAKLES swiftly descending the cliff to where PROMETHEUS stands chained Prometheus!âPrometheus!âTorch-Bearer!â Titan!âMy brother!âO my brother!â PROMETHEUS Hail! Herakles! Herakles! O Son of Man!â O Liberator!âO holy day of triumph!â My brother and my sonâall is fulfilled! Yea, I have kept the faith, and all is well, All is surpassing well! ..... HERAKLES Prometheus!â Friend and Redeemer of the life and soul Of man!âO Torch-Bearer!âreceive from me The love and the thanksgiving of mankind, Who keep and celebrate in sacred trust Your memory, living with the life you gave! Receive out of my heart the love, receive The emulation of humanity, Which is the harvest of your seed!âfor I, I am of you and yours, Prometheus! Yours is the light of life, the light of being, In which I was conceived into this worldâ Father! PROMETHEUS Behold, my light is everywhere! ..... Lightâwhere the sun gorgeously dies away, Aureoled with its own magnificence; Lightâwhere the quiet, interminable sea Shines like a blind and burnished shield of gold; Lightâwhere the sky utters a single star; Lightâwhere the ethereal vesture, pale as mist, Spun of the scant, strange silver of the moon, Hangs on the shoulders of the heaven-ward hills..... See! the whole sphered, smooth skies are like a bowl Carved of a single azurite and brimmed With golden wine, with light!âto slake the thirst Of man's insatiable spirit, and rouse, Far in the depths of his creative mind, Light, the eternal light, which there displays Commensurate splendours and sublimities To these of God's initial ordinance! O Lightâeternal Light! O miracle And benedictionâtranquil, tender majestyâ Spacious and grave serenity of light! O meaning, revelation, breath of lifeâ Interpretation and significance, Prospect and clear persuasion of the truthâ Impalpable essence of the universal beingâ Light!âof the sun, the moon, the starsâthe soul! Here have I stood,âhow long, day after day!â Sole in my strength as in a watch-tower, And seen, abroad over the living world, The punctual sunrise and the stars return, The light return, to me illustrious! Thus have I been assured, and thus received My life's recognizanceâseeing the light Witness my worth and vindicate my deed; Seeing the light perennial, and the lifeâ To me and mine perennial victory! ..... And now, O Son!âO Son of Man!âO strength Born of my strength!âI know not all in vain I nursed mankind with mystic hopes and dreams, And gave, out of God's violated dwelling, Eternal treasures to ephemeral man! I know not all in vain I have endured These violent years and harsh extremities: For you, conceived of my humanity, You are my celebration and my crown, You are my perfect proof! HERAKLES Prometheus!â With all my friendless, childless, desolate, And lonely heart I love you! Let us be, Henceforward and together without end, As brother and brother, blent in perfect love..... O to surrender utterlyâto give, Utterly and at last and all in all, The passionate proud liberality Of the unspared, exultant, eloquent, Abandoned, loosed and loving heart of man! ..... O to commune as equals! O to share The soul that finds no less than life itself, And all of life and love and death and birth And being its special issue!âO my brother, Give me your love and blend your light with mine! What may we not achieve, who have so wrought Apart and lonelyâbeing at last as one: One heart, one soul, one life, one enterprise! Come! let us hence..... PROMETHEUS ..... O to the end of the worldâ O to the end of time and truth, together Let us go hence! ..... I love you, Herakles! He starts toward HERAKLES. The fetters restrain him. HERAKLES Shatter the bonds! Rise from the fetters! Rise! Come!âlet us go in strength, and quietly Blent in one meditation and one vision, Elate, into the future, hand in hand..... Come!âfor the light of life clears and abounds; Come!âthe supreme occasion is prepared; Come!âthe victorious voice of love proclaims The epic grandeur of the soul's ambition! Suffer His chains no more, Prometheus! The hour is nowârise and depart with me! Will you be lax now the great door stands wide Asunder, and salvation is at hand? Where is your faith?âAlas, Prometheus, Where is your strength? ..... PROMETHEUS struggling vainly against the fetters My strength has well sufficed Here to withstand God's grim omnipotence, Day after day, despite what agonies! ..... HERAKLES Shatter the chains! PROMETHEUS still struggling in vain He will not let me go..... Yet, tho' His strength prevails against me thus, He is not now victoriousâI am still Stedfast and undefeated! It is well With me!âfor all the utmost power of God Can rob me of my honour by no means, Nor vex the heart's exultant happiness! HERAKLES Honour and happiness?âO hungry heart, Dreaming of love! O rash, insensate hope Of friendship and of free communion! O stern, relentless solitude!âAlas! Alas, Prometheus, yours are empty words! What is the honour of a captive soul? What is the happiness a heart can feel, Whose love refrains, whose faith falters and fails? PROMETHEUS You speak at ease, knowing no fate like mine: It is a happy and honourable thing Thus to preserve so long inviolate The life where human hope finds sanctuary, And keep aloft the blood-stained banner of man's Rebellion, like a challenge and defiance, Flowing in the free wind of life forever! ..... It is a happy and honourable thing Thus to withstand the very power of God, And bear so long unspeakable agonies! ..... HERAKLES ..... Thus to withstand a phantom, and endure The anguish of a self-inflicted pain?â Honour and happiness are cheaply bought, Yea, for a little price, Prometheus! PROMETHEUS A little price?âthis dire captivity, These tortures, Ã¦ons and Ã¦ons long! ..... HERAKLES The price Is small, since it is insufficient to the cost Of liberty, and has not paid the living wage Of the soul's nurture in the coin of truth. Life you have kept inviolateâand so much, In all your captive and disconsolate years, Was honourably done. What is there more? What have you done with life, Prometheus?â O you have treasured unprofitable things, Lain sick and idle in the lap of dreams, And wasted life and strength in senseless war With vain imaginings! ..... PROMETHEUS Nay, but with the Living God! HERAKLES Who then is God, and what is He? ..... Enough!âI know you, and I know your worth; And I salute you and acknowledge you, Prometheus, and your strong, magnificent deeds. Here I salute and specify in you The long, defiant life, proud and resolved; The dim, strong, spiritual, heroic trust; The courage and the unconquerable will, Which held you stedfast in the urgent fear Of dire, fantastic dreams and spectral things. Yet, in the strict account, nothing is new Since the beginning, when your splendid deed Brought light into the darkness of the world;â And know you well no splendour can suffice Save for the moment's payment and reward! The voice of the POET from far below; sounding clear tho' faint in the distance No single, excellent deed, Born of the spirit's utmost need,â No one magnificent Stress of impassioned virtue, nobly wrought,â No honourable and manly pride Of an eternal conflict, hardly fought,â No desolation where the soul is triedâ No grim captivity where life is spentâ No pain, no sacrifice, No strength, no splendour can alone suffice To pay the constant cost of liberty, The daily wage of truth's enlightenment. Nothing accrues!âOf all the soul has been And learned and done there is no usury, Save as the Light is more before us seen, And the occasion more sufficiently Preparedâmore grandly and more arduously! And, save as we Areâby the endless labours undismayedâ More apt to learn, more eager to become, More prompt to go and more resolved to be Free in the universal truth, which is our home. The living of the soul is daily earned And daily spentâto-day the price is paid; To-day the truth is learned; Yet is the labour by no means gainsaid, For all is partial and provisionalâ Yea, to the end of all! ..... Yea, we shall hear again the forward call To-morrow; and to-morrow we shall wake To find to-morrow's payment still to make; And we shall rise to-morrow and renew The labour; and to-morrow truth shall be As strange and true and splendid as To-day and yesterday it was, The way shall be as endless, we As eager, and the world as new! ..... A moment of silence. HERAKLES It is my poet, singing his soul away..... Hear him, Prometheus, for his songs are soothâ And all shall come to pass! ..... Only, for you All has been long postponed; but now, at last, To-morrow and the labour and the truth Are here at handâand truth is terrible! Courage, O Titan! O Prometheus, Courage, courage!âyou shall more need it now That I am come to strip you of your chains, Your lifelong honour and your happiness, And leave you real and bare in the real world, Than ever when all alone, incessantly, You stood superb against the power of God And took no ease of the remorseless pain..... You shall more need it now to, gloriously, And more magnificently than God, and more With loveliness and with simplicity And the sufficient, quiet, serious strength Which He had not, who thundered and was hidden, Assumeâresume, perhaps, after so long!â Dominion over more than ever He Held under various rule of fear and love. Courage, Strong Heart, courage!âfor now, at last, You shall recover what you gave away Such countless vague millenniums ago:â The Kingdom and the Power and the Glory, The strength, the will, the clear eternities Of truth, the sacred miracles of love, The widening skies, the calm infinities Of libertyâthe inherent heritage of man, So long estranged under God's usurpation! ..... PROMETHEUS I shall recover? ..... My inheritance? ..... Mine? ..... What betides? ..... O what shall come to pass? ..... Where is my victoryâthe full, the flushed And mystic consummation of my dreams? ..... The voice of the POET somewhat nearer Courage! for thus and only thusâ As we are prompt and hazardous, As we are rapt, religious and austereâ We are victorious, And find the strange, steep way, and hear The airs rush into song before our flight, And pass out of the night, Persuaded by a single star, And learn that where the soul's adventures are The truth's discovery is near, And the delight Of liberty, and pÃ¦ans, and pageantries of light! ..... HERAKLES Courage!â PROMETHEUS My strength and courage shall suffice, HERAKLES You shall be more victorious than you dreamed, Prometheus!âfor your victory is truth, Only conceived in the unfettered mind Which, of the gross amorphous element Of life, in its alembic subtly fused And wonderfully transfigured, makes the clear Cogency of the universal laws. Yea, God has long enough stood in the plain, Noble and forthright way of man's ambition, Wielded his regency, and for a mess Of pottage bought his vast inheritance;â And man shall come into his kingdom! ..... God, As truth discerns, is of the infancy Of manâthe primal, dim, projected shape In which his anxious mind figured at large, On the vast shadow of his ignorance, His sense of the inevitable Unknown, The chance, blind sum of nameless energies, Amid whose secret peril he walked in darkness, Bearing the light of life's concentred fire, The pure, fine flame of the self-realized soul, Fearfully on its way, windy with doom..... For thus, in symbols, fables, parables, We are expressed; we hear some vague report Of what we know not, and our minds devise Some image that shall well enough suffice To methodize to thought's austere command, To reason's quiet, inevitable terms, The garbled jargon that the senses speakâ Which are persuaded of the Something there! ..... Thus rose the myth of God, when time was young, When, curious of whatever strictly shaped The horror and hardship of his destiny, Man's fear and ignorance conceived the cause In his own likeness, and believedâand wept! Now we have looked abroad and looked within, Straining the symbol, and we learn to know, Quietly and at last, its secret sense, Shadowed and insufficiently set forth, Is, in the meaning and the truth, ourselves!â We are the Gods! We are the Householders Of heaven and earth and all that in them is! It is your Self, your universe and mine, Prometheusâyours and mine and man's forever! PROMETHEUS Mine is God's burden of the universe? ..... Mine the relentless energies of God, Which lurk beneath this candid and benign Masque of perennial nature, and conspire To compass man's destruction and despair? ..... I am alone? ..... I am responsible? ..... O nothing, nothing of all my dreams comes true! The voice of the POET nearer than before Brave, spiritual, and strong, Let us take wings and will, O Soul! for we, We have too long, too idly and too long, In fate's relentless grip, Lain like a derelict ship Cast from the shining circles of the sea High on the shores of time's captivity. Let us take wings and will!âperchance To-day, the least of life's impartial days, In unpremeditated, common ways, We shall achieve deliveranceâ And wake, and hearken, and hear The rush of the changing tide And the shout of the flood returning, deep and wide, Over the reefs of doubt and fear, Over the shoals of change and chance, Over the shores of timeâand feel, Under our keel, The old ecstatic buoyancy, The strong, smooth, spacious, sun-starred breast of the Sea! ..... HERAKLES Prometheus! Prometheus! Prometheus!â The soul of man can never be enslaved Save by its own infirmities, nor freed Save by its very strength and own resolve And constant vision and supreme endeavour! You will be free? Then, courage, O my brother!â O let the soul stand in the open door Of life and death and knowledge and desire And see the peaks of thought kindle with sunrise! ..... Then shall the soul return to rest no more, Nor harvest dreams in the dark fields of sleep..... Rather the soul shall go with great resolve To dwell at last upon the shining mountains In liberal converse with the eternal stars..... O let the soul feel the unhindered wind Blow out at sunrise to the dazzled sea, Strain in its sails and urge its enterprise! ..... Then shall it tarry in the anchorage, By teeming wharves of vulgar merchandise, No moreâbut rather choose to go abroad Into the great, gold morning, and afar, Where, from new skies, new seas receive the light..... O let the soul, at truth's persuasion, wake And understand!âit shall not then endure To fail and be at peace and profitless: For little glory has it of all this world, And all its strength is nervous and disused In the low, little labours of mankind. It is alone and understood by none; Its speech is not of vain, vile, violent things; But on its lips the dominant, great voice, Which is the one true voice, cries out in song Of Lord-ship and a last deliverance!â It is the soul of manâand can not stay; It is the soul of manâand may not rest; It is the soul of manâand will not fail, And shall not cease to labour evermore, Until at last its own infinity Is in its own perfection all conceived! ..... Prometheus! Prometheus!âGod is dead, And man is overcome!âand you and I And all men whatsoever whose minds report The truth, whose lives exemplify the soulâ We are the Heirs of all the universe, And of ourselves supremely, all in all! Yea!âfor the Lord, who dreamed of regencies Too little perfect and resplendent, and Set over them celestial deputies In His own image, feigned and fabulous, Is come into His kingdom out of sleep! Yea!âfor the hour is come, the Lord is rousedâ And all is His, and all is victory! ..... A scant moment's silence. Then, his voice sounding like a summons: Prometheus!âYou are free!âPrometheus!â PROMETHEUS raises his arms. The fetters fall from his limbs. He takes a step forward to the edge of the precipice. PROMETHEUS Free..... His face turns skyward. In the last, dark flush of the sunset the EAGLE appears, swooping swiftly down. God's winged blood-hound falls to his quarry..... HERAKLES Your eagle comes as a tamed hawk returns..... The EAGLE sweeps down and lights on the shoulder of PROMETHEUS, where it folds its great wings and remains motionless. The voice of the POET close at hand And then!âO then it is, after the deed is done, And the Great Gates stand open, and we are gone, Who shall no more return, Foundered and tempest-driven, As drift and wreckage on the shores of timeâ O then and thus it is we learn How all the soul was skilled to ask is given! And wonderfully and nobly we discern A sense of life transcendent and sublime, A knowledge that we shall by no means miss The love, the grace, the grandeur that we earn! For then and thus it is The soul achieves its metamorphosis, The Sleeper wakes within the House of Dream, And, deep within the vision of his eyes, In the starred, silent heights of heaven The incommensurable night is riven, And in the blinding beam Of dawn across unfathomable skies, His wings flash skyward from their shattered chrysalis! ..... Thus do we end our exile; then it is We find the last release, and rise, Knowing the truth which testifies That pain and time and long captivity And life and death and destined circumstance Are only phases of our ignorance! ..... And thus it is at last that we, After great love and long adjournments, see The pinnacles of thought lighten with songâ And all the spirits of the Free, Calm and majestic, move along In an ascending theory! ..... While we stand with wings and will Nerved to the task before us still; While we watch with stedfast eyes, Clear and valiant as a bell, The flame of thought that never dies; While we explore the secret none can tell; While we prepare, in tense tranquillity, For the inveterate miracle, The soul's perennial truth, the truth's perennial liberty! ..... Ascending from below, the POET and the WOMAN appear, faint and exhausted, on the level where HERAKLES and PROMETHEUS are standing. The WOMAN Herakles! ..... She falls fainting to the ground. The POET Love has spent its strength..... and I Am hardly come so far after my vision..... He falls on his knees beside the WOMAN. HERAKLES O human heart of love!âO Visionary, Filled with the sacred utterance of song!â Welcome! The hour is come and gone. Behold!â Yours is the victory, for man is free! PROMETHEUS Free!âI hear Pyrrha crying in the darkness..... And Epimetheus calls me..... and Pandora Sings in the total night desolate songs And strange, old legends, dim with secrecies..... I see Deukalion's face, fierce and afraid, Staring aloft into the new, bleak light! ..... I was a thing of terror and of tears To themâmore sad and terrible than death!â When, with my hollow reed of the pure flame Of everlasting, living light, I came Among them, flushed, triumphant, fabulous,â Came as the herald of life's endless task, With trumpet-calls and splendid exhortations, Eloquent in my hour of victory! I was a thing of terror and of tears To themâmy turn has come to fear and weep! For now I stand in the beginningâI, Prometheus!âas they stood in the beginningâ Pyrrha, Deukalion, Hellen, mortal men And womenâwith the life they had not asked! ..... I stand in the beginning, stand and weep Here in the new, bleak light of liberty, As once they stood and wept, seeing the light! ..... I stand in the beginningâI, who once Believed fond fancies of the mystic endâ The unimaginable, fantastic, dim Apotheosis of my hopes and dreams! ..... I stand in the beginning! God is dead, And man is overcome, and I am free!â And who am I? ..... And what is liberty? ..... HERAKLES. Liberty is the freedom to become Free..... The POET The soul's long day's work is liberty. HERAKLES turns and begins to ascend the mountain. PROMETHEUS Mine is the long day's work..... Mine is the soul..... Mine is the freedom to be free..... I know At last and without question, suddenly, There is no Power in whose almighty hands I can lay down the burden of this world; And I am all alone and utterly Real and responsible; and now my house Of life is ruined, and I am left alone, Shelterless and at large, like a poor beast..... All that I wasâmy value and my worth, My sense and strengthâis gone! ..... The mind's defiance, The heart's indomitable rebellion, are No more; no more the tortures and the chains; Honour and pride and happiness no more! These were my virtue, these my hope and faith, These were my own, my life's, significance:â They are no more! ..... And in the stead of them, What is my meaning, aim, and end? ..... HERAKLES standing higher in the mountain, in the place where he first appeared To you, As you to Pyrrha and Deukalion, Now I renew, appraised and amplified And more sublime, more glorious, more secure, The one true, perfect, and profitable gift!â All that there is at all I give you!âLo, Yours is the Universe and yours the Soul, And life and labour and liberty are yours To understand and blend them into one! ..... All that there is I give you, and no less, And nothing more!âno phantoms and vain dreams, No spectral fears and false expectancies, No empty honour, no vainglorious joy. These are destroyedâbut not that, in their stead, Other, tho' lordlier, vain imaginings And awful ghosts and unsubstantial things Should fill the shadows whence their shapes are gone;â Rather are they destroyed that in their room The soul of man may go abroad at last, Gravely and quietly, as befits the soul; And freely, masterfully and wisely dwell In the waste, spacious realm, withheld so long! PROMETHEUS I understand at last. The end is come Of all my dreams, for now the new bleak light Of the Beginning is upon mine eyes, And I am wakened! ..... And I understand At last..... And Truth is grave and chaste as deathâ And radiant as life is in its whole strength! So, as I may, I take the stern, great gift: Mine is the Soul, and mine the Universe; Mine is the burden, mine the task. I know The price of Truth, the worth of Liberty. I understand at lastâand now my strength Returns!âWhere are the labours and the life? ..... Where is the conflict? ..... Where the victory? ..... HERAKLES Knowledge alone is victory! When all Is understood, all is subdued, received, Possessed and perfect. For the soul of man Is, in the universe of force and change, Of blind, immeasurable energies, Subtile and secret and supremely one, The sole self-realized power, the single strength Aimed and reflective and perfectible. Therefore alone the mind's conception turns Chaos to cosmos, ignorance to truth, Force to the freedom of articulate lawsâ Giving to phases of the senseless flux, One after one, the soul's identity. Yea, of the soul is all our hope! To know Is truth and freedom!âTherefore, O my Brother, Therefore beyond us, in the vast Unknown, Waiting the power and conquest of the mind, Is the far prospect of our enterprise! ..... And should we come into dominion!âthen, O then, at last, when all is lived and learned, Loved and received in its eternal kindâ When we are Gods and Saviours, every oneâ When in communion and accord we dwell As native in each far, impermanent star, And in the inhospitable vacancies Are welcome and securely domiciledâ When we are strangers nowhere in the earth Or sea, and nowhere in the being of manâ When the long life of all man's endless lives, Its gradual pregnancies, its pangs and throes, Its countless multitudes of perished Gods And outworn forms and spent humanities,â When all the cosmic process of the past Stands in the immediate compass of our mindsâ When all is present to us and all is known, Even to the least, even to the uttermost, Even to the first and lastâwhen, over all, The widening circles of our thought expand To infinite horizons everywhereâ Then, tenoned in our foothold on the still, Supernal, central pinnacle of being, Shall we not look abroad and look within, Over the total Universe, the vast, Complex and vital sum of force and form, And say, in one, sufficient utterance, The single, whole, transcendent Truth,ââI am!â A brief silence. The POET rising to his feet Come! I will lead you down, Prometheus! PROMETHEUS Down..... My Son!âMy Brother!âmust we say farewell? HERAKLES Hither away are the Hesperides..... The POET Come! I will lead you down, Prometheus, down, Where, in reality, in deed, in truth, Your work begins! PROMETHEUS Where does the work begin? HERAKLES There, wheresoever the soul's dominion ends! For a moment no one moves. Then PROMETHEUS slowly gathers the WOMAN in his huge arms, and begins to descend the mountain, the POET leading the way. The last vestige of sunset is gone. The night is calm and perfect. The thin figure of the POET and the vast stature of the TITAN, with the insensible WOMAN upon his breast, and the great EAGLE still perched upon his shoulder, loom vaguely in the still moonlight. HERAKLES stands motionless on his eminence,âclear, strong, and solitary against the stars. The End.</field>
