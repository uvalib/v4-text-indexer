      <field name="fulltext">POEMS. HOPE PROPHESIES TO MAN. See Hope her glittering pinions plume, Joy gushing from her eyes; As though she knew not of man's gloom, Nor ever heard his cries. Not fresher looks the dewy dawn, Awakening perfumed May, And calm, as though could ne'er be drawn Storm's curtain o'er his day. Hope has her throne upon the light, That breaks from out the east; Behind her lowers still the night, Before her night has ceased. Thus riding on the ushering rays, That greet the expectant earth, She shares the glory that displays Each morn at its great birth. With light she comes, and light she brings; Without her what were Morn? Dull are the beams Day 'fore him flings, To those with her are born. The Sun his heavenly task might close, And Earth in darkness grope; For life would sink in torture's throes, Were man bereft of Hope. And she has voices deeper still Than for the single ear,— Voices that tell, with heavenly will, Humanity's career. Who 's blest to hear them, sees arise Such splendors in the van, That, rapt in ecstasy, he cries, Hope prophesies to man. ASPIRATION. Were we what we might be, We 'd not look back with sadness; But the Past as brightly Would shine as present gladness. Were we what we could be, We 'd not look forward fearing; But the Future would be As sunlight warm and cheering. THE MARTYR'S MOTHER. A PASSAGE FROM THE HISTORY OF THE REFORMATION IN FRANCE, AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY. “First strip his shoulders bare, Then through the streets of Meaux Scourge the cursed wretch, who 'd dare More than his priest to know. The scourging done, let the hot brand Hiss on his brow from hangman's hand.” Called priests of Christ were they, The judges who thus spake; So darkened was the day, That with Lord Jesus brake. For Jesus said, “Love one another”; These loved themselves, and cursed their brother. His hands behind him bound, His back the martyr bent; His life-drops on the ground, They marked the path he went. Calmly as earth the wild storm's flashes, Receives his soul the priest-bid lashes. Like bloodhounds on a trail, The yelling multitude, With bitter, mocking hail, His glorious track pursued. The blinded crowd so seldom knows Its benefactors from its foes. But silent was the tear, From bleeding hearts upsent, For the brave teacher dear, Their bondage who had rent. And some, who yet had not the truth, Deep groaned with fructifying ruth. That soul-steeped look,—whence broke it? To his strong heart a balm; That valiant word,—who spoke it? It made his courage calm. So look, so speak, could only one; A mother worthy of the son. Ceases the blood-wet rod; The iron 's in the fire; I' the name of mercy's God, Rome's priests will slake their ire. The headsman's arm is up,—and now The iron 's on the martyr's brow. Like one fierce lightning streak On the black calm of night, On that hushed crowd a shriek Fell with appalling might. “Glory to Jesus Christ,” it cried, “And all his witnesses!” and died. The throng and soldiers melt, Subdued, o'erwhelmed with awe; The priests, e'en they too felt She was above their law. A heart-voice tunes all to its mood, So deep 's our bond of brotherhood. Thus could a mother sing For Christ and Truth that day; She, too, had quelled pain's sting. The awed crowd give her way To her humble hearth, the noble one: In triumph followed her her son. THE LOVED DEPARTED. Solemn as their voices dying, Silent as the graves they lie in, Tender as a mother's yearnings, Secret as a wife's heart-burnings, Sweet as tears of the kind-hearted, Are thoughts of the loved departed. Now their aspects greet us cheerful, Now with something sad or tearful; Still and mystic come their faces, Hallowed by unearthly graces. Welcome aye, whence ever darted, Visions of the dear departed. When least looked for come before us These pure visions, to restore us,— When a sordid passion 's scheming, When with anger eyes are gleaming. Blessed be whatever started Memories of the loved departed. DIDACTIC. Health's temple is the body fair, High miracle of art, A perfect God-built palace, where Strength, Beauty, each, full part From Life may drink, that floweth there, The fountain of the heart. Keep pure and sweet, is Heaven's command, This temple, thus divinely planned. Within this temple is a light, And deep a holy well, Kindled and nourished from the height Whence all beginnings swell. Virtues and powers have they, so bright Their splendors none can tell. If free the intellect and soul, Man is a generous, joyous whole. Let in its might the mind awake, It speaks the eternal law; Like sun-struck mists, Time's trammels break, Pale falsehoods faint with awe; While round them, Love, Truth, Beauty, shake The light from God they draw, That lights to boundless liberty. To earn this freedom, what do we? We blast our bodies with the ills Of vice and ignorance born; Our minds we dwarf, we lame our wills, Till e'en ourselves we scorn; Each one his breast with self o'erfills, Making each one forlorn; And then, when woes thick on us burst, We moan,—“By fate and Heaven we 're curst.” High intellect is lowly used To glut unrighteous needs, Its keenest edges roughly bruised Upon hard, selfish deeds; The soul's warm wants are cold refused, Stinted with meagre creeds; And then, by endless strifes outworn, We wail,—“Poor man was made to mourn.” Disorder, by brute force strong bound, Order and law we call, And 'bout the reeking earthy mound Religion 's made a wall; Thin theologic paps are ground, To sweeten man-mixed gall; And heavenly earth thus made a hell, We 'd save us by the old church-bell! WHY ARE POETS SAD? Saw'st thou e'er the clean proportions, Schemed in fulness of thy soul, Marred to look more like distortions Than the beauty of a whole? Heard'st thou e'er poetic passion, Music-wrought to thrill the heart, Tamed by some insipid fashion, Or by players with false art? Hast thou ever, with the feeling That the ill might have been stayed, Watched a loved one, while was stealing Death upon her like a shade? Who thwartings such as these has had, May know why poets oft are sad. Poets' lives are daily thwartings; In their souls they bear such needs, That to them are ceaseless smartings, What the world calls highest meeds. Music sings in their heart-stirrings, That can find no earthly voice; Life's best actual forms are blurrings, To the beauty of their choice. Man's great sorrows, with heart-feeling, Daily they in secret moan; From their eyes are often stealing For man's woes warm tears unknown. No poet 's he who can be glad, With so much round to make him sad. BURNS. Quivering with strength, from earth he springs; Defiant shouts his strange voice rings. Gazing afar, like some lone tower, His nostrils panting restless power, His big eyes darting eager fire, With rustic hand he strikes his lyre. From the long sleep, so dreamless slept, Scotland, like a roused laggard, leapt. Rolls the clear tide of a new song Through her heart's channels, void so long, High swelling now, with lively beat, To sounds so earnest, stirring, sweet. With quickened pulse each bosom hears, In tones that shift from mirth to tears, And where, too, clarion notes are pealed, Its inmost feeling bright revealed. A nation's face, thus freshly wrought, Beams with a smile of joyful thought. Few years had passed since first was heard That fiery heart's awakening word; Its mighty throb, that warm life sent To million hearts, and with them blent In rapturous unison, is still; Tranquil so soon in Death's pale chill. Wasted; by soul-sprung griefs outworn; By proud heart-struggles inly torn; Disconsolate, despairing, crushed; Before his time in misery hushed; Great Burns went early 'mongst the dead, His eye still gleaming thoughts unsaid. Could he have had but half his due, Had half was felt and done been true, His generous soul had then been soothed, And timelier his last pillow smoothed. Traduced, banned, poor, he died heart-broken,— The noblest Scot that e'er has spoken. He whose large will, if matched with power, Had rained all gifts in ceaseless shower, Who did give gifts but by those given Endowed to bless the earth from Heaven,— Thoughts to enrich all time to come,— Earned his poor bread by gauging rum. A noble man, divinely strung For all the virtues he has sung, Finds wrenched by lies into divorce From good, man's pith, his feelings force; Is driven to the tavern's stench, His brotherly yearnings there to quench. Instead of honor, condescension; Instead of peace, hot, coarse contention; 'Stead of high work fit for great souls, He had the low, slow toil of moles; A victim of the falsehoods strong, That make of men a scrambling throng. Passions in him were lashed to madness, That might have been a well of gladness; Sources of joy turned into sadness, His very goodness into badness: A strong man bound in the world's lies And multiform hypocrisies. IMPROMPTU, ON BEING ASKED FOR A FEW LINES TO ACCOMPANY A CANARY BIRD, SENT AS FROM A LOVER TO HIS MISTRESS. 'T is only song can utter love, Its agonies and blisses; For song, too, springeth from above, Far, far from sin's abysses. Alas for me! I cannot sing, And yet love will be spoken: O, for the poet's golden string! My heart will else be broken. I'll send my bird to speak my part, O, hearken to his singing! And when 't would seem he 'd burst his heart, Think that with mine 't is ringing. O, DREAM NO MORE! O, dream no more of heavens to be! Heaven is, within, around you; Wake from a selfish lethargy, Where misty visions bound you. Cease resting on a joy, to start When first the grave shall press you; The throbbing, living, longing heart Is full of joys to bless you. O, dream no more of hells to be! Hell 's here, around, within you: What are the groans of imagery, To those from earth that din you? Awake, and live; 't is dawn at last: Hark, how your brothers call you. Awake, and love; let go the past, Shake off the hates that thrall you. O, dream no more! rouse up and be: Make Love and Beauty bound you; And so at last humanity Shall grow a heaven around you. TO LITTLE MARY GRIFFIN, GRANDDAUGHTER OF CAPTAIN JAMES LAWRENCE. Sole scion of a noble breed! Thy sparkling, laughing eyes In dearest bosoms throw the seed Of saddest memories. Then quick thy wiles, And roguish smiles, Banish all miseries. Joy-darting life and nimble grace Thy blooming limbs enfold; More thoughts are struggling through thy face, Than thy young eyes can hold. May body's health, And spirit's wealth, Be aye, as now, foretold. Thy merry voice makes glad the air, While through thy tongue Hope sings; And from thy playful tresses fair Joy leaps in sunny rings. Beautiful child! On thee be piled All gifts that goodness brings! Throughout thy grandsire's country wide, Welcomed thou aye wilt be, All hearts, for that brave death he died, Thankful his child to see. May thy grandsire's Soul-lifting fires Shine womanly in thee! INVOCATION. O Thou, who smilest in the Spring's glad bloom! Whose love is dimly seen in good men's deeds! Source of all life! Mysterious, awful Presence! Power beneficent! Pour of thy grace Upon my spirit, that would purely mount. O, multiply in me the blessed moods, When Beauty swathes me in her fiery wings, And from all selfish thoughts upwafts me swift, Through realms of growing light, towards the high centre, Where, in eternal fulgence mild, Truth dwells. FREILIGRATH. Where the old Rhine most proudly shows His beauties and his grandeurs mild, As by St. Goar's walls he flows, And 'neath broad Rheinfels' wreck uppiled,— 'T was there the poet simply dwelt, And simply sang of what he felt. I knew him there, and that sweet spot Lay after in my memory's folds More fragrantly, that 't was my lot To meet there what one glad beholds,— A gentle, modest man, God-gifted, In world's wares low, by worth uplifted. A frugal pension from his king, Enough his bounded wants to sate, Left him all free to roam and sing, Thus duly honored by the state. Thought-breeding spirits, in that land, Are nourished from the public hand. His image lived within my mind, As drew him there his verse and mien; A man, kind, gentle, and refined, A poet, whom 't were hard to wean From quiet thought, and the calm moods Mild natures love in fields and woods. A few years passed;—I was at home. One day, as o'er some British leaves My eye all listlessly did roam, Suddenly to the page it cleaves, Fixed by the poet's name, and reads The story of his Muse and deeds. At first the picture was the same That I had laid within my breast; But soon, strange, startling words there came Of flight, imprisonment, arrest. By dread and wonder overpowered, The tale I tremblingly devoured. With beautiful dilation swelled That stored-up image, as I learned How he his wrath for years had quelled, Had hushed the love wherewith he yearned; Hoping, with loyal, Christian trust, That Prussia's king would yet be just. That tranquil mien, that abstinence From smiting words, from song-winged blows, Was a pure soul's compelled defence. Beneath, a patriot spirit glows, That for one's country all would dare; The stronger, that it could forbear. But when at last, by patient trial, That vulgar king's low mind he knew, That of sweet freedom the denial The king from slavish instincts drew, In stormy verse his ire he sped, And from his home and pension fled. In England now his bread he earns, By daily, common, mindless toil; And sad, and silent, tearful turns His eyes towards his far German soil; Yet thankful, too, that he is saved From those hard tyrants whom he braved. And faded now 's that image meek, Dimmed by the splendors stern, that shine Around the martyr's pallid cheek. The gentle poet of the Rhine His deeds a hero-bard avow; Whom then I loved, I reverence now. Woe to the country such must fly! Its core is foul with cankering blight; Its throne 's a gilded, brazen lie. The poets are a people's light; As were a sunless firmament, Is the cursed land whence they are sent. THE LOST FOUND. Bewail not time that thou hast lost, Or days gone by and wasted; 'T is losing time to be thus tost By memories bitter-tasted. But work the grateful Present so, That some of what thou 'st planted To bounteous strength and fruitage grow And thanks, by brothers chanted. 'T is thus thou 'lt find those lost, sad days, Bereft too of their sorrows; Our past bad debts there 's naught that pays, But gold of rich to-morrows. GIVE! GIVE! The sun gives ever; so the earth, What it can give, so much 't is worth. The ocean gives in many ways,— Gives paths, gives fishes, rivers, bays. So, too, the air, it gives us breath; When it stops giving, comes in death. Give, give, be always giving; Who gives not is not living. The more you give, The more you live. God's love hath in us wealth upheaped; Only by giving is it reaped. The body withers, and the mind, If pent in by a selfish rind. Give strength, give thought, give deeds, give pelf, Give love, give tears, and give thyself. Give, give, be always giving; Who gives not is not living. The more we give, The more we live. AGNES. As birthday I will celebrate The day when first I met her; From that 't is I my true life date, So much to it I'm debtor. My heart I felt not till that day, My head, too, I belied it; For what 's a head, in best array, Without a heart to guide it. O, take my life, but not my love; What were my life without her? No star with its linked sun can move More true than I about her. Darkling I 'd err, were she away; I'm lost, were I to lose her; She is my light, she is my stay, 'Mongst millions I would choose her. I WILL BE FREE. Down! superserviceable knave, That basely yieldest all we crave, False sprite, Self-flattery! Protean imp! though thou canst throw thee Into all guises, now I know thee: Down! down! I will be free. And ye, who bring, so open, bold, Your gifts of power, applause, and gold, To bribe my liberty; Millions you 've chained in hellish fires; Bold as ye be, ye all are liars: Avaunt! I will be free. Ye too, with wiles, and sweets, and charms Full well I know ye and your harms, Ye spawn of luxury! Ye carnal crew! who calls you pleasures Is false, or knows not your false measures Begone! I will be free. Hence all your honors, gawds, and pelf! I'll none of them; I'll be myself, And strive for liberty. My soul! be thou at last uprisen; Life shall no longer be a prison, With death its only key. Spirits of beauty, love, and truth, Potent to give perpetual youth, Come ye and bide with me. In your celestial influence fold me, And with your chastening strength uphold me: God! help me to be free. THE SUFFERINGS OF JESUS. So weak our joys, so poor our lives, That towards thy affluence of soul Human conception vainly strives, Seizing but fragments of the whole. And we are glad; we smile, we laugh; But thou didst weep, didst never smile; And so we deem, that thou didst quaff Of naught but sorrows, deep or vile. In that last awful ghastly scene, Where Sin and Death danced in mad glee, Our weakness makes thy sufferings keen; We groan in fleshly sympathy. O, what to thee were torture's fangs? What death, to thy ecstatic mind? A tranquil dream were death's worst pangs; Thy pain was pity for mankind. Earth's mists to earthly eyes bedim The sun, that calmly glows above; Through mists we see the cross, and Him, Calm with a strong pain-quenching love. Will vanish then our sensual fears, When we shall rise towards his pure living; Sweeter than our best joys were tears Of him, whose life was one long giving. THE BERNESE ALPS AT SUNSET. Ye mighty offspring of the strong young Time! Gigantic brood of earth's primeval travail! Before your silent, beaming majesty, With strange delight, with solemn joy, I gaze, The mind upmounting with your loftiness. Sublimity makes such familiar haunt Among your grandeurs manifold, that Beauty Shrinks modest down, to nestle at your feet. Ye are alone; changeless, where all things change; Motionless 'midst the unceasing flow of life. Scarce do ye bear an earthly stamp, but high Ye lift your speechless, spotless heads, snow-blazoned, 'Bove nether influence; cleaving earthborn clouds, That round your cold sides cling, like living arms Around a corpse, insensate to their touch. A mystery ye are; and from the plane And common of this world sudden ye rear Your giant forms, 'midst time's recurring spans, Fit emblems of eternity. Since first From Zurich's humble hills your image loomed, A heaven-suspended vision, on my sight, Day upon day I 've journeyed towards ye, wondering; Till now I stand, awed, baffled, at your base. Darkness fast fills the earth, but your white peaks Glow in the sunshine. Telegraphs 'twixt worlds! Your sky-ward fronts brighten the sun's last ray, To me a herald from my far-off home. A GORGEOUS SUNSET. As wonderful and fresh to-day Is this magnificent array Of purpled light, as 't were the first That quenched man's beauty-craving thirst. Yet day ne'er died, but its last hour Was soothed by like soft solar shower. It is a promise, daily given, To sickly, sorrowing Earth, by Heaven, That pure and beautiful as this Is yet to be her daily bliss. ECHO FROM ITALY IN 1830. Hark!—'T is past. Whence came that shivering sound? 'T was the blast of tyrants; France is bound. Still lower bend the knee, To deeper slavery, Woe-stricken Italy! Ha!—Again. A crash like deafening thunder! 'T is the chain of bondage rent asunder. Exultant Italy, With clanging symphony, Sends back the maddening cry. Hark!—A shout of hosts comes o'er the sea! 'T is the rout of tyrants; France is free. The shout of victory, Of joy and liberty, Resounds through Italy. REUBEN JAMES. On the deck, blood-soiled, In a death-grip coiled, The captains lay; Decatur up,—below, the Turk. Fierce round them play The Christian sword and Moslem dirk. Above the hero's head A scymitar keen flashes; An instant more, he 's sped: Down the sharp weapon dashes. To ward the blow, To seize the foe, Nor arm nor sword is there; by stands But one poor tar, maimed in both hands. Down sweeps the Turkish glave,— Decatur naught can save. What cannot a brave heart? That tar, with a quick start, Thrusts his young head between: It takes the steel's deep seam. 'T was for a hero by a hero done: Both must be great that deed so great be won. Higher among heroic names Stands thenceforth none than Reuben James. SCENE BEFORE TRIPOLI. [This poem was suggested by one of the many fine passages in Cooper's Naval History of the United States.] A rosier flood of golden light, A livelier gush of melody, Told of a new earth-sent delight For Heaven's ceaseless jubilee. Joys none of purer holier birth Hath Heaven, than noble deeds on earth. Swift now the fire-eyed host Of warriors quit their post, And gathering, With flashing wing, On the deep nether bound of their blest home, Shone like a vast illuminated dome. Like keenest lightning, The broad day brightening, Glittered that army radiant, With bounding gladness jubilant. A myriad throng there mustered, In song-wove circles clustered, Of every age and strand. He who had sought The hero's death; He who had wrought, With gushing breath, To build his fatherland; He whose faint ear, On battle-fields lying, Freedom's glad cheer Had blest in his dying; He whom the might Of duty had lifted, With front upright, By war to be rifted; The hearty ones, whose deaths have been The births of deathless thoughts 'mongst men. With jocund flight, they sped their way Towards Afric's northern shore, where lay, On the black level of a sunless sea, Columbia's fleet, afront of Tripoli. They gathered round one slender bark, They smiled upon her starry banner; Her deadly cargo they did mark, And as the men who were to man her Each freely came with eager will, A joy-born wave of richer light Pulsed through the angelic host a thrill, That flushed them more unearthly bright. Hushed is the fleet; a fearful deed 's to do. All hearts are with that bark and her bold crew. A low “God bless you!”—seizure of the hand,— A manly, tender look,—and the choice band Have parted from their comrades. Fare ye well, Ye brave, with Somers, Wadsworth, Israel! Calmly and silent takes his station each: Only who stay are moved. With warning speech, Decatur, who for self ne'er danger spied, Greets Somers; and stout Preble's bosom sighed, As from his sight quick glided in the gloom The death-fraught vessel, onward to her doom. Through the dark and solemn night, Forth she slid like voiceless sprite. On her deck, so dread and cheerless, Thirteen hearts beat free and fearless. Friends were behind them, foes before; Round and under, War's black thunder Slept till a spark should wake its roar. But Heaven smiled in stars above; And deep within Each heart's full rim Glowed the strong fire of country's love. Hushed deeper is the fleet. All eyes are one; All fastened to the lone “Intrepid's” path. The wind is gauged, the time 't will take to run To the Turk's cruisers, where will burst her wrath. The bold bark's desperate goal she'll quickly gain; The scene fore-paints itself on the strung brain:— See Somers stand, With fire in hand; His comrades ready, No nerve unsteady: The match is lighted; The crew, unfrighted, (Naught of earth could shake them,) To the boats betake them,— Harshly is rent this hopeful dream. Forth from the Moslem fort a stream Gushes of flame; quick then the ear Is filled, too, by the cannoneer. Stream upon stream; with each a mate Of thunder on the air doth grate. Is broke this hot suspense By what o'erwhelmed the sense. One flash, as though all light were spent! One crash, as though a sphere were rent! Trembled the wars-men to their keels; Glared the dark sea, as thing that feels. By that appalling light, each saw His neighbour's visage blanched with awe. The air collapsed, as though a wrench Were made Earth's very life to quench. Silence and Night, as fraught with general death, Rush back, while Turk and Christian hold their breath. More slowly than when Ocean's homeward way Is balked with calms, drag on the minutes now. Keener than the fierce famished shark for prey, Watches each silent ship from stern to prow. Save when impetuous fancy cheats the hope With semblances of sound, nor eye nor ear Can seize on aught within their tensest scope. As hours wear sadly on, night grows more drear. Close to the water's edge the seamen creep, Striving to catch the stroke of muffled oar. The hands that should have pulled them, on the deep, Where Courage keeps his state, will pull no more. Gleams the high rocket; booms the signal gun, Calling to Somers, Wadsworth, Israel. The heavenward gleam points to the path they 've gone; The cannon's helpful roar,—it is their knell. None came to say, how died th' heroic band; And Death and Night the fearful secret kept. Shrieked mothers, sisters, wives, as from that strand Reached the dread tale, and a whole nation wept. Gay as blossoms breeze-borne dancing, Heavenward flew th' angelic host, Swift as sunbeams earthward glancing, Back to their empyreal post. E'er that glare the fleet that daunted Quick was swallowed by the night, They their song of triumph chanted Near th' eternal realms of light. Linked in wreaths 'round heaven's portal, With the lightsome grace of joy, Hung that shining host immortal, Heirs of bliss without alloy. Backward then their vision darting, In the nether darkness met, Just from earth fresh upward starting, What seemed stars in circle set. Upward, upward, surely steering, Sparkling with perennial ray, Thirteen stars, all free careering Upward to the heavenly day. Now they near the blissful portal, Brightening still as they advance; Now the exultant host immortal Close them in with choral dance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPIGRAMS. THE POETASTER. What is he like, a prosy versifier? Like a clipt goose he is, immersed in mire. He could not fly, unclogged by any balk; Behampered thus, he cannot even walk. “GREAT STATESMEN.” Like plummet in mid ocean sounding, Like him who crystals would be rounding, Are they who rule, and fashion laws,— Things that are chiefly made of flaws. And yet, men dub them great; the while Angels or weep, or pitying smile. But why, blind as they are, why rail about them? The world 's so bad, it cannot do without them. ISMS. Say, thoughtless skeptics, ye who doubt The Devil's true existence, What are these isms all about,— What, but to God resistance? God's will is, that we aye should live In union fraternal; But these bring hate, and mankind rive With enmities infernal. From one vile common parent spring All isms with their schism; Born he of Satan's venomed sting,— The monster, Egotism. Through business' wastes and passion's fogs, Men run their petty round; They make one think of little dogs, Their noses to the ground. Philosophers say, in their deep-pondered books, It were well if each man found his level. Sage sirs, this is not quite so good as it looks, For 't would send a whole host to the Devil. Religion 's ever soiled and soiled And by man's foulness hurt; The cleanest thing will be defiled By contact with the dirt. No carpenter so quick with rule, To measure height and length, As is a pert, self-ignorant fool, To gauge a wise man's strength.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SONNETS. ON THE FIFTY-FIFTH SONNET OF SHAKSPEARE. The soul leaps up to hear this mighty sound Of Shakspeare triumphing. With glistening eye, Forward he sent his spirit, to espy Time's gratitude, and catch the far rebound Of fame from worlds unpeopled yet; and, crowned With brightening light through all futurity, His image to behold up-reaching high, 'Mongst the world's benefactors most renowned. Like to the ecstasy, by man unnamed, The spheral music doth to Gods impart, Was the deep joy that thou hast here proclaimed Thy song's eternal echo gave thy heart. O, the world thanks thee that thou 'st let us see, Thou knew'st how great thou wast, how prized to be! TO THE STATUE OF EVE, BY POWERS. Who that has had of beauteous womanhood Translucent visions, in his holiest dreams, Or when the abstracted, waking mind so teems With images of beauty, that 't will brood, In happiest silence, on the fertile mood So deeply, till each outward thing but seems Fantastic, while the flashing, inward gleams Compound a loveliness that would be wooed As a reality,—were such to come Before thee, with a virgin joy, his soul, Like a new spirit in Elysium, Would gush with ecstasy, while from it roll All memories of dreams or inward sight, Paled by the fulgence of thy wondrous light. Florence, February 24th, 1842. TO THE SAME. The Greeks—whose fresh imaginations blent Spirit with form so richly in their youth That Beauty wore the radiant crown of Truth, And ever bodied forth some wise intent Direct from Jove Minerva drew, and rent His mighty brain, to give becoming birth To Wisdom's Goddess, that her peerless worth Might not be marred by dallying passion's vent. Powers is a new Jove; and on his brain What has begot this perfect woman (who Like Pallas shall breed thoughts of purest strain) Is the young life his giant country drew From heaven and her own soul, where no old art Nor chains the soaring mind, nor chills the heart. Florence, March 4th, 1842. TO THE LEGISLATURE OF MARYLAND, DISCUSSING THE RESUMPTION OF PAYMENT. Look in the face of God, who looks at you; And, like a cur before the lion's lair, You'll quake to speechlessness, or you will swear, With soul-drawn valor, that you will be true. But set your thought on high, you'll feel what 's due Unto yourselves and sons. But if you wear An earthward look, you 're lost; and we must bear A load of shame not ages will subdue. Freemen, it is the cause of liberty: The able debtor is the basest slave. O, ward us from a blighting infamy! If the State WILLS, she CAN. He is a knave, Who says she should not, whom we must despise, And scorn, and loathe: who says she cannot, lies. Baltimore, January 31st, 1844.</field>
