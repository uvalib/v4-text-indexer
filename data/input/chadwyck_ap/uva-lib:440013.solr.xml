      <field name="fulltext">LISPINGS OF THE MUSE. JUVENILE POEMS, CHIEFLY WRITTEN AT AND BEFORE THE AGE OF SIXTEEN “He LISP'D IN NUMBERS, FOR THE NUMBERS CAME.” VALEDICTORY. This poem was written at Boston, in 1805, when the author first quitted his home, and the academy in which he had been educated, for New York. The author's father, Mr. William Payne, was the founder and director of the seminary alluded to, which was known by the title of “Berry-Street Academy.” O Time! forgive the infant muse Who dares to sing thy speedy flight, And waft a sigh in silent views To realms of permanent delight! In vain I glance a wistful thought O'er joys too precious to be bought, Where no sad change Can e'er estrange From scenes which erst engaged my feeling heart. With fond remembrance I retrace The years, the months, the weeks, the days, Which “creeping in this petty space,” I've spent in childhood's blithesome maze: Now fled, like Ganges' sacred stream, Or, like a visionary dream; Now here—now gone— Still passing on, Or, like myself—appears but to depart! Friends of my life, and dearest held, My filial vows to you I pay, By love and duty both impell'd While, from your guidance call'd, I stray, With lively gratitude inspired;— May all the bliss to be desired On you descend Till time shall end, And crown the wish convey'd in my adieu! Still, fond rememb'rance, ling'ring, dwells O'er my lov'd ALMA'S nurt'ring shade, And painful recollection swells: The clust'ring branches there display'd, While nursed in Science' lib'ral store, And fed with literary lore— Oh, may they still Thy vot'ries fill, And they, like me, shall own their debt to you. [At the age of thirteen.] EPILOGUE TO THE WANDERER, AN AMERICAN PLAY, ACTED AT THE NEW YORK THEATRE. Written at the age of fourteen, spoken by Mrs. Jones, who performed the part of Julia, the Wanderer. So, then methinks we'll leave, without repining, This sobbing, monkish, methodistic whining: One serious part (at least, if they will tease one) Is quantum sufficit for half the season. Oh, dear! I scarce can force a smile to ask How you approve our author's infant task? If to his “Wanderer” a home you'll give And bid the hope of trembling genius live?— “Pshaw!” cries old ten-per-cent, “don't talk to me Of trembling genius, hope, and— (Hesitating, then with a mimicking flourish,) ti-tum-tee! All stuff and nonsense! If the cash be rare— What, genius, is thy boasted lot?—despair! Though his bold flight reached worlds at every bound, Its end—what is it? two-pence in the pound! The silly wight is left at last to curse His learned noddle, with an empty purse! Give me your plodding man of common sense, Whose wiser study is to soar at pence; Who thinks no style like invoice half so terse is, And contra credit worth a ton of verses! If wits will write, why, let them write, and starve; For me, thank Heav'n! I have my goose to carve, And cellar furnish'd to my heart's desire:— Prithee what more can man or beast require?” This said, he takes his quid, looks wise, and stirs the fire. From judges such as these we gladly turn To eyes that sparkle, and to hearts that burn, That conscious, kindle at Columbia's name, Proud of their country's letters, as her fame! That rear th' exotic, if the flowers be fair, But guard the native plant with tenfold care; Nourish its tendrils like the dew of dawn, And bid it bloom to cheer its parent lawn! Warmed by such favor, Genius learns to rise, Like our own Eagle, a career to run, Free as the air, and brilliant as the sun! A devious “Wanderer” fondly turns to you, To ask indulgence, not to claim a due; And oh, believe her! she would rather roam O'er any wilds, however far from home, Than fail to court, in modest merit's cause, The sanction of your smile—the fame of your applause! FRAGMENT OF POETRY. FOUND AT THE FALLS OF MOUNT IDA, TROY, IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK. Several passages were obliterated, by having been frequently trodden on; and those which remained were traced out with much difficulty. Shunning the noisy haunts of men, He loved to wander here. His friends were few: He cared not for the crowd. He heard, unhurt, The scornful jest of cruel ignorance. The poison'd arrows, which misfortune aim'd, Pierc'd not his heart, in such bold armor clad, That every point was blunted at the blow, And dropp'd unheeded down! Oh! he would gaze, With rapture gaze upon this fairy scene, And he would moralize the opening leaf, And in each little, curious fibre find The noblest tribute to its Maker's praise. He joy'd to mark The silver stream swift gliding twixt the banks, Which seem'd to smile in ecstasy to see Their lovely foliage in the polish'd wave! In silent rapture would he sit and view These distant waters, torn up by the crags, Rippling and sparkling as they sprang in air: Then traced with hasty steps the forest path, Where stream impetuous plunges the abyss; Then rolls along exulting to be free, With roar at which earth trembles. Here he paus'd: For inspiration lived in every wave, And the aw'd soul was mute. Within the cataract where th' embodied stream Leaps the high cliff, with dash of fury foaming, Sleeps the wild spirit of the storm. A cave, Formed by the jutting of that cliff, her cell; The water-sheets, its wall, through which the sun Darts tempered hues of strange and various light; And as the tumult stills,—the waves subside,— And distant echoes die upon the ear,— With printless tread, along its flowery banks, The Muses love to wander, hand in hand— There, as it gently winds among the vales, To trace, through fairy lands, its silver course. Note.—The scenery of the foregoing is described from nature. It is peculiarly picturesque. The jutting out of the top of the precipice throws the wave forward with a magnificent sweep, leaving an immense chasm between the sheet of water and the side of the cliff, to which the Poet cannot help assigning some inhabitant from among the numberless spirits who are always in waiting for appointments of that nature. The author, therefore, put the storm-spirit into it, and hopes she will be pleased with her residence, which certainly possesses great attractions from the rainbow effect of the sunbeams, as they come subdued into moonlight mildness by their passage through the stream. ODE FOR THE THIRTY-FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE. Written as a College Exercise. When erst our Sires their sails unfurl'd, To brave the trackless sea, They boldly sought an unknown world, Determin'd to be free! They saw their homes recede afar, The pale blue hills diverge, And, Liberty their guiding star, They plough'd the swelling surge! No splendid hope their wand'rings cheer'd; No lust of wealth beguiled;— They left the towers that Plenty rear'd To seek the desert wild; The climes where proud luxuriance shone Exchang'd for forests drear; The splendor of a Tyrant's throne For honest Freedom here! Though hungry wolves the nightly prowl Around their log-hut took; Though savages with hideous howl Their wild-wood shelter shook; Though tomahawks around them glared,— To Fear could such hearts yield? No! God, for whom they danger dared, In danger was their shield! When giant Power, with blood-stain'd crest, Here grasp'd his gory lance, And dared the warriors of the West Embattled to advance,— Our young Columbia sprang, alone (In God her only trust), And humbled, with a sling and stone, This monster to the dust! Thus nobly rose our greater Rome, Bright daughter of the skies— Of Liberty the hallow'd home, Whose turrets proudly rise,— Whose sails now whiten every sea, On every wave unfurl'd; Form'd to be happy, great, and free, The Eden of the world! Shall we, the sons of valiant Sires, Such glories tamely stain? Shall these rich vales, these splendid spires, E'er brook a Monarch's reign? No! If the Despot's iron hand Must here a sceptre wave, Raz'd be those glories from the land, And be the land our grave! TO A LADY, WHOSE INFANT DAUGHTER DELPHINE WAS REMARKABLE FOR THE BEAUTY, FIRE, AND INTELLIGENCE OF HER EYES. The Rose, which boasts so rich a dye, And wantonly with Zephyr plays, Woos the delighted traveller's eye, Yet blushes at the traveller's gaze. That Rose, in but a little while, Shall bloom and blush no longer there, Shall pass away, like beauty's smile,— Be pale and cheerless, like Despair. But when another Spring shall rise, Another Rose shall there be found; Another Rose of richer dyes Shall shed a sweeter fragrance round. Thou art that earlier Rose. O! long Be friendship with thy virtues blest! The theme of many a Poet's song; The idol of affection's breast! And, if thy little one confirm The promise of her sparkling eyes, In Delphine we behold the germ Of the next Rose, of richer dyes. O! may this child surpass in worth The bright example thou hast given, Charm the enraptured sons of Earth, Then flourish in the fields of Heaven! MARY. “Ah me! how sweet is Love itself possest, When but Love's shadows are so rich in joy!” Shakspeare. If Reason could the heart control, If Memory from itself could fly, I'd quench the fire that burns my soul, Nor drink the poison from her eye! How often have I vainly sought To guard against Love's madd'ning sway,— But flashing deep into my heart, One glance has swept resolves away! Since Reason, then, can ne'er assuage Presumptuous reveries like mine, Rage on, my soul! still madly rage, And be a fancied Mary thine! Long may the fairy vision spread Its soothing spell around my mind, That joy, itself forever fled, May leave the phantom still behind! And when, at length, this life shall fade, And earthly scenes recede in gloom, My Mary's fondly cherished shade Shall light my passage to the tomb! LINES, ADDRESSED TO MRS. AIR, ON HER DEPARTURE FOR PROVIDENCE; WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BY SOMEBODY ELSE. A very accomplished lady, by the name of Air, residing at Providence, in the State of Rhode Island, was on the eve of departure from Boston, where she had been some months on a visit. A gentleman, celebrated for the frequency and felicity of his puns, was solicited by a friend of this lady to express his admiration in a farewell poem, which was, of course, expected to have been a poem of puns; but the parties were surprised to receive, in place of the expected jeu d'esprit, a grave series of compliments, conveyed in delightful poetry, but not one pun in the whole collection. This incident called forth the following Yes! I am lost! By those bright eyes Entrapp'd before I was aware! Ev'n Hope deserts me! for my sighs Are given to unconscious Air. Like the mild Air which sweetly swells The notes of an Æolian lyre, Whose magic every woe dispels, And fills us with seraphic fire,— This soothing, lovely Air can make The passions bend to her control, And, with ethereal mildness, wake The softest music of the soul! Thy smile (like the pure Air which blows Where spirits of the blest unite), Exhilarating Air! Exhilarating air is Sir Humphry Davy's term for what is called, in the technical phrase of chemistry, gaseous oxyd of nitrogen. When inhaled, it produces the wildest ecstasy. A late writer on the subject poetically imagines that the atmosphere of Heaven is composed of that kind of air. bestows A dear delirium of delight! I live—I move—by means of Air; Yet gentle Air resolves to fly! Oh, stay! protect me from despair; By Air deserted, I must DIE! DERMODY. “Whether by accident or design, I know not, but never were the remains of a Bard deposited in a spot more calculated to inspire a contemplative mind with congenial and interesting feelings.”— Monthly Mirror, London, 1802. If, pensive stranger! in thy breast The flowers of Fancy ever bloom, Come hither, stranger! come and rest Upon this rose-encircled tomb! This tomb, to which at eve retires Neglected Genius:—here, alone, He weeps, despises and admires The wretch whose wrongs describe his own! The aged Minstrel, pausing here, Of many a plaintive lay beguil'd, Laments, with many a tribute tear, The Poet “wonderful and wild.” Could but that Poet swell the song, And now with phrensied touch inspire The harp whose notes he'd once prolong Till his whole soul would be on fire,— Ah! could he touch—the thrilling strain Would wake a kindred ecstasy, And thou wouldst sigh to hear again The lyre of luckless Dermody! And o'er his lov'd remains, which sleep Cold in this dark, sepulchral bed, Then wouldst thou sit, like me, and weep The wild-ey'd Bard of Erin dead! And thou wouldst bathe the flowers that wave, Till ev'ry flow'r that bloom'd before Should, bending, kiss the sacred grave, And bow, and weep, and bloom no more! MAY AND HER PROTÉGÉ. RESPECTFULLY INSCRIBED TO MRS. A. V. H. ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF HER BIRTH IN MAY. BY THE POET-LAUREATE TO HER ROSY-CHEEKED MAJESTY THE RIGHT WORSHIPFUL QUEEN FLORA. The following was dedicated to an English lady who had been twice married. The happiness of the earlier part of her life was blasted by the ill-treatment of a very profligate husband; but her felicity was restored by the second marriage, which was remarkably prosperous. These circumstances will explain some allusions in the poem. My dear Madam,—The inspiration of your birthday sets even me into a humor for rhyming. What a magical day, to inspire me, of all the stupid people in the world! I hope you will not, true woman-like, be vexed at my making May your Queen, instead of making you the Queen of May, as is usual on such occasions. I could not consign you to a better protector than this blooming nymph; and I think it is fully proved in the enumeration of her past bounties, with which I have the honor to accompany my congratulations on the return of this anniversary. Sweet May! thy magic charms inspire Poets, as well as birds, to sing; Each hopes to utter from his lyre The best turn'd compliment to Spring. The flowers which start beneath thy tread, The graces which around thee throng, Have madden'd every Poet's head, Since the first Poet lisp'd in song. But, lovely May! although thy smile Turns deserts into rosy bow'rs; Beams forth such raptures as beguile The wretched of their gloomiest hours; Yet higher joys thy happy dawn, Enchanting month! to me unfurl'd, When, on Amelia's natal morn, Thou, smiling, gav'st her to the world! Yes! at that hour didst thou impart Thy softness to her eye and face, With thine own warmth inspire her heart, And o'er her form diffuse thy grace! When tyranny, neglect, and woe Low'r'd awful o'er thy lovely trust, November would have bid her go, And skulk into a grave accurst:— But taught by thee, Heav'n's darling May, When the black tempest hid the skies, She bow'd to its o'erwhelming sway, Then saw a cloudless sun arise! Yes, lovely May! to thee she owes That conscious purity of soul, Which, though it cannot shield from woes, Spurns their unlimited control! Drear was the past detested hour! Her present bliss by contrast charms— That past, forgotten, through thy pow'r, In a deserving husband's arms! Still o'er her destiny preside, And grant that every future day, Which, gentle month, shall o'er her glide, Be soothing and serene as May! THE TOMB OF GENIUS. Where the chilling north wind howls, Where the weeds so widely wave, Mourn'd by the weeping willow, Wash'd by the beating billow, Lies the youthful Poet's grave. Beneath yon little eminence, Mark'd by the grass-green turf, The winding-sheet his form encloses, On the cold rock his head reposes— Near him foams the troubled surf! “Roars around” his tomb “the ocean,” Pensive sleeps the moonbeam there! Naiads love to wreath his urn— Dryads thither hie to mourn— Fairy music melts in air! O'er his tomb the village virgins Love to drop the tribute-tear; Stealing from the groves around, Soft they tread the hallow'd ground, And scatter wild flow'rs o'er his bier. By the cold earth mantled— All alone— Pale and lifeless lies his form: Batters on his grave the storm: Silent now his tuneful numbers: Here the son of Genius slumbers: Stranger! mark his burial stone! PUZZLE. The following jeu d'esprit was written in the honor of a celebrated lady in Virginia by the name of Mayo, whose virtues, beauty, and accomplishments deserve a higher eulogium from an abler pen. The effort was more immediately prompted by a remark that the name of Mayo was no way susceptible of a pun. The poem was intended to be complete as an independent allegory, and, at the same time, appropriate in every reference to its subject. Fatigu'd and restless, on my bed I languish'd for the dawn of morrow, Till slumber sooth'd my aching head, And lull'd, in fairy dreams, my sorrow. I seem'd in that serene retreat, The Hermitage,—a delightful country residence of the lady, afterwards the wife of General Scott. Which smiles in spite of stormy weather; Where flowers and virtues, clustering, meet, And cheeks and roses blush together: When soon twelve sylph-like forms, I dream'd, Successive on my vision darted, And still the latest comer seem'd Fairer than she who just departed. Yet one there was, whose azure eye A melting, holy, lustre lighted, Which censur'd, while it wak'd, the sigh, And chid the feelings it excited. “Mortal!” a mystic speaker said, “In these the sister months discover:— Select from these the brightest maid,— Prove to the brightest maid a lover.” I heard and felt no longer free! The dream dissolves, the sisters sever, While raptur'd, I exclaim, “With thee, Dear May! O, let me dwell forever!” EPILOGUE. An original play called “Pulaski” was acted at college, and Master Howard Payne, at that time only fourteen years of age, and who sustained the only female character in the play, was appointed to write and pronounce the epilogue. He spoke it in the dress of Lodoiska, who entered hastily as the curtain fell. I haste, kind guests, as you perhaps will say A wretched pleader for a wretched play. Oh, had you seen, repentant for his errors, Our trembling author's frown-subduing terrors, Even if you disapprov'd you would not show it, But spare the work in pity of the poet! But soft a while—let me a moment pause— Speak for myself—and then assert his cause; Tell me, ye beaux, are your affections free? You need not answer, for I plainly see That you're all dying, luckless beaux, for me! Ladies! do you no indignation feel That Lodoiska should your lovers steal? Be calm, dear ladies! set your hearts at rest, You shall retain your beaux, and make them blest! For, lest a late discovery prove inhuman, In time I'll tell them that their fair's—no woman. “No woman!” say you?—gentle folks, don't stare! The transformation is no more than fair! So many women now our breeches wear That we must sport their dresses, or go bare! Says that young lady in the gunboat bonnet, Or seems to say,—“WE, sir,—WE wear the breeches, sir! Fie on it!” Sweet Miss, I ask your pardon, but if you The fact deny, I'll try to prove it true. Are you not soldiers? Fight ye not with—eyes? And many a stout heart carry by surprise? Who can withstand “th' artillery of charms”? The harvest heroes yield—to woman's arms! Are ye not merchants? and to lose vexation Do you not marry upon speculation, And with the highest bidder make a trade On which embargoes can be laid? But, woman-like, my tongue once under weigh From the main point, has gone so far astray That, self-absorb'd, I've quite forgot “Our play.” “Our play!” the critics sneeringly exclaim,— “Our farce” were surely a much fitter name. Remember, critics, what you've seen this night Is but an unfledg'd poet's infant flight; 'Tis yours to tempt him with bright plumes to rise, Spring from the plain, and glitter in the skies; Like our own Eagle, a career to run, Free as the air, and brilliant as the sun. Ye lovely fair! beneath whose guardian eyes The humblest bud of genius never dies, And with your cheering smiles this honest claim,— “The smiles of beauty are the wreaths of fame.” FLATTERY. Lines addressed to a lady who told the author she feared that the attention of the world would spoil him, and unfit him for anything serious. Written in 1806. Oh, Lady! hadst thou ever seen The tear unbidden fill my eye, Or mark'd me in the sportive scene, To half suppress the rising sigh,— Thou wouldst not think that Pleasure's glare Had blinded, and subdu'd my heart, Or planted deep was, rankling there The poison of her glittering dart!— True, fortune on my boyhood smil'd, And much of flatt'ry I have known, Yet Sorrow claims me as her child, And early mark'd me for her own. The joy has burst its prison chains, And rapture started from its sleep, They left me with severer pains, They taught me better how to weep!— Few are the hours which beam like those That I have sweetly spent with you, Which, brilliant 'mid a cloud of woes, In memory still their charms renew! ON THE DEATH OF A LADY FRIEND. Death with reluctant steps, half lingering, hies, And, arm'd with terror, pitying, shakes his spear! He strikes, and as the lovely victim dies, Relenting, mourns her with a silent tear! THE COQUETTE. Oh, tell me, sweet girl, ere we part, If your recent reproofs were sincere, If that anger arose from the heart, Which glowed in those glances severe. Did you mean, love, when lately we met, In earnest to frown thus and fly me? Or, acting for once the coquette, Did you counterfeit rage but to try me? Come! kiss and make up ere we part, And, dearest, I'll strive to amend! For, depriv'd of my home in your heart, Where again shall I find such a friend? ODE TO CLARA. The following was written when Master Payne was twelve years of age, on reading some publications in a New York paper signed “Clara.” How oft have I essay'd in vain To swell the wond'rous wizard song, Yet still the rude and rustic strain Groans on the lyre's unwilling tongue, And hoarsely breathes, as if to chide My erring and presumptuous pride! Oh, Clara! since the muse denies My wild, untutor'd strain to rise With some bewitching melodies, Deign thou, her darling, to inspire My humble harp with hallow'd fire; Teach it the magic of thy lyre, That I may boldly forth and claim Like thee, the choicest gift of fame,— A deathless, great, and glorious name!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POEMS OF LATER DAYS. CANZONET. Thou,—oh, thou hast lov'd me,—dearest! When none other cared for me, When my fortune seem'd severest, Kindest was the smile from thee! Yes,—Ah, Yes! The lorn and lonely Hollow hearts of worldlings shun: Theirs are flowers of day, which only Open when they see the sun! But while theirs were all reposing In the absence of the light, Like the cereus, thine, unclosing, Gave its sweetness to the night. A BIRTHDAY SONG. WRITTEN FOR DR. DRAKE FOR A BIRTHDAY PARTY. Oh! speed the light hours! With fancy's gay flowers Life's dearest socialities gracefully wreathe! Let the shadows of care Meet like mists in the air, While the warmth of thy sweetest kisses we breathe. Oh! fill not the bowl! 'Tis the wine of the soul That must gladden the spirits that mingle to-night: Let it sparkle and dance Like the dazzling expanse Of the wave when the sunbeam has clothed it in light. Oh! spread not the board From luxury's hoard: 'Tis the pure feast of feeling we gather to share,— Ambrosia of Heaven Free, bounteously given,— The East cannot furnish a banquet so fair. Oh! cold is the heart That would scorn to impart Its brightness and glow to the hours as they glide: Then hasten to weave Sweet garlands; they'll leave A beam, as we float, on Time's cold, ebbless tide. STAR-GAZING: AN EXCHANGE OF “IDLE THOUGHTS.” Like thee, I love the stars. In distant climes I've stood alone and watch'd them; and have thought I saw the spirits of departed friends Smile in their loveliness; and then would dream That some, not yet departed but far off, Gazed with me on them; and that I could feel Their glance of kindness in the gentle light Which cast its sweet spell round me. Then there seem'd A music in the sphere, to charm away The serpent sorrows gnawing at my heart, Till, one by one, they dropp'd their demon hold, And left me, all alone with contemplation, Like thee, to love the stars. Like thee, I love the stars. And thou hast made Their radiance dearer yet. The poetry Of thy imaginings, like sunbeams flung Upon the waterfall, has wrapp'd those stars In colors new and beautiful; and now O'er me bring visions of deeper power: They call the mighty from their monuments; They fill the sky with old historic wonders; And, all commingling with the thoughts of her Whose wand has wak'd this witchery, my soul Swells with the blended glories, and I thrill Like thee, to love the stars. Like thee, I love the stars, and yet my fortunes Have often seem'd to tell me, “Do not love them, But give them hate for hate!” They never bless me; They hurl'd me forth on thwarted hopes, false friends, And left me to those triumphs from the little Which make the spirit wither up in scorn,— But I can have no quarrel with them now, Since one has risen o'er me in the west Whose gentle beauty speaks for all the rest. Shine on, sweet star! still let me feel thy light. For, though I know that light is not for me, I would not have thy pity cloud the spell, Whate'er its peril, which has taught me here, In thee, to love the stars. THE WATER-WITCH AND THE PILGRIM. There is a tradition of Correggio, which some Italian poet has wrought into a play, that contains the following singular fancy for its plot. Penniless, he had hurried from his home to the mansion of a rich man with a picture which had been ordered, urging him for immediate compensation. The rich man pompously paid the amount all in coppers, but Correggio, exulting in the good fortune of getting all his pay, accepted the indignity without particular notice, and hastened away with the relief so anxiously sought for. When near his destination, overpowered with fatigue and thirst from the weight of his treasure and the terrible heat of the day, he came to a beautiful pond of water with a natural fountain springing from the side of a brook. The cool, clear, bright waters invited him to partake of the refreshing treasure. He eagerly drank from it, and while he drank, mysterious music came over his ear as from a fairy spirit in the water. For a moment he was fluttered and thought it a warning or a prophecy, but with a light heart he passed on to his home, and the song of the fountain was soon forgotten in his rapture at the bright face and the warm welcome his charming little wife gave on his return. Yet scarcely had he caught her sweet smile when the poison of the icy draught darted through him, and in an instant he remembered the mystic song of the waters, and, as he flung the sack of money before his adored wife, he expired. The following is the substance of the song of which the Italian poet has given the idea. A water-nymph lurks in the cliff's hollow side, And a pilgrim lies faint by the wild, whirling tide; Where, 'midst rainbow and cloud, the lone waterfall springs, And its curtain of foam o'er the haunted cave flings. Hark! the lay Of the Fay! “Come hither, come hither, poor pilgrim to me; From sorrow and sighing thy bosom I'll free; And thou shalt a fairy's blest paramour be! “Plunge, world-weary pilgrim! plunge deep in the wave! Once mine, thou wilt smile as it storms o'er our cave; For never false friend or sad heart-ache may come Through the rush of white waters that curtain our home. And away Shall the spray Wash mortality's clay from the care-canker'd soul; Long dreams of delight o'er thy senses shall roll, And new life wilt thou quaff from the fairy's charm'd bowl.” He struggles to rise as he hears the fond strain, But sinks on the flood's giddy margin again; From her wave-curtained cavern the water-nymph trips, And fatal the goblet she holds to his lips. Quick the thrill Of death's chill Has run through his marrow and curdled his blood; His faint shriek is echoed by cavern and wood, And wildly he plunges beneath the dark flood. His winding-sheet was a whirlpool's white spray, And a bubble bore his last life-breath away; Deep, deep lies the pilgrim beneath the cold stream, And dimly his bones through the clear water gleam. But at night The false sprite In pale moonshine oft glides from her damp-dropping hall, The ghost of the wave-buried pilgrim to call; And they dance, and they shriek o'er the wild waterfall! THE THRONE AND THE COTTAGE. I. There once was a king on his throne of gold seated; His courtiers in smiles were all standing around; They heard him with news of fresh victories greeted; The skies with the joy of his people resound; And all thought this king was most thoroughly blest, Till sadly he sigh'd forth his secret unrest: “How much more delight to my bosom 'twould bring To feel myself happy, than know myself king!” II. “Ah, what, while such power and such treasure possessing,” (A courtier, astonish'd, stept forward and cried,) “Could fortune bestow in exchange for the blessing?” And thus to the courtier the king straight replied: “Health, a cottage, few friends and a heart all my own Were Heav'n, in exchange for the cares of a throne!” “Then, sire, if no longer to empire you cling, Seek these, and be happy, and let me be king!” III. The king gave the courtier his throne and descended; He long'd for delights of retirement to prove, And now for the first time around him there blended The smiles of contentment, and friendship, and love But the courtier soon came to the king in his cot; “Oh, no!” said the king, “I'll no more change my lot! Think not, that, once freed from the diadem's sting, I'll give up my cottage and stoop to be king!” VALENTINE. TO A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG ACTRESS. There is a heart, (I dare not say Where that heart dwells,) whose fondest dream (Though wild and hopeless,) many a day Has been the angel which you seem: And though the world has taught that heart,— (Oh, may such lessons ne'er to thee The world—stern monitor!—impart!) Taught it to seem is not to be; Yet who would not such doubt discard, That see thy loveliness and youth Enshrine the visions of the bard, And turn his poetry to truth? Would that I knew thee! and yet still So strongly do I feel its dangers, The very wish to know thee will Perhaps forever keep us strangers! When once we met, of all who live I thought that there was none but thee Who could a charm to bondage give, Or take the charm from liberty,— And therefore 'tis on such a theme My truant feelings dread to dare, And rather choose of hope to dream Than rashly to ensure despair; For I'm not vain enough to think It were not madness to aspire To charms like thine,—and so I shrink From that which I the most desire— The most desire, though love which seeks By selfishness its truth to prove, Is undeserving thee—and speaks The voice of passions, not of love! Then never shalt thou know whose hand 'Tis now declares the secret feeling Which at once dreads disclosure, and Still finds relief in the revealing! And while, at times, I hope once more That we may meet as once we met,— Grow more acquainted than before, With chances more propitious, yet If ne'er by me to be possess'd, Elsewhere thy love turns,—let it go— Enough for me to know thee blest, And feel thee worthy to be so. HOME, SWEET HOME! [AS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN.] 'Mid pleasures and palaces though we may roam, Be it ever so humble, there's no place like Home! A charm from the skies seems to hallow us there, (Like the love of a mother, Surpassing all other,) Which, seek through the world, is ne'er met with elsewhere. There's a spell in the shade Where our infancy play'd, Even stronger than Time, and more deep than despair! An exile from Home, splendor dazzles in vain! Oh, give me my lowly, thatch'd cottage again! The birds and the lambkins that came at my call,— Those who nam'd me with pride,— Those who play'd by my side,— Give me them! with the innocence dearer than all! The joys of the palaces through which I roam Only swell my heart's anguish—There's no place like Home![The following additional verses to the song of “Home, Sweet Home!” Mr. Payne affixed to the sheet-music, and presented them to Mrs. Bates, in London, a relative of his, and the wife of a rich banker:] To us, in despite of the absence of years, How sweet the remembrance of home still appears; From allurements abroad, which but flatter the eye, The unsatisfied heart turns, and says, with a sigh, “Home, home, sweet, sweet home! There's no place like home! There's no place like home!” Your exile is blest with all fate can bestow; But mine has been checkered with many a woe! Yet, tho' different our fortunes, our thoughts are the same, And both, as we think of Columbia, exclaim, “Home, home, sweet, sweet home! There's no place like home! There's no place like home!” THE LAND OF MY BIRTH. A SONG. I. I've rov'd 'mid the wonders of many a clime, Fair cities, sweet valleys, and mountains sublime, But ne'er saw a clime half so lovely on earth As the land of my first love, the land of my birth! Land of my first love! Oh, land of my birth! Thou, thou art the loveliest land upon earth. II. Far away have I hung on the love of the wise, And bask'd in the sunshine of soul-thrilling eyes, But the land of true wisdom, and beauty, and worth, Is the land of my first love, the land of my birth! Land of my first love! Oh, land of my birth, Thou, thou art the loveliest land upon earth; Land of my first love! sweet land of my birth! III. Still dear and more dear, the more distant thou art, My footsteps have left thee, but never my heart! That magnet still turns from all over the earth To the land of my first love, the land of my birth! The land of my first love, the land of my birth, Thou, thou art the loveliest land upon earth; Land of my first love! blest land of my birth! INCLEDON'S DÉBUT IN AMERICA. The following was written to be sung by Incledon himself. Shield made admirable music for it: whether it was sung or not, I could never learn— J. H. P. Hail Columbia! patriot nation! Star of hope to the opprest! In battle, darting desolation! But in peace, sole ark of rest! Parted far from friends that lov'd him, Torn from children he adores,— Driv'n from those who first approv'd him To the shelter of thy shores— Shores which shar'd his youth's affection!— Hither forc'd in age to roam— Here, the stranger seeks protection! The “Wandering Melodist” “Wandering Melodist” was the title given by Incledon to an entertainment with which he travelled, and in which he was the sole performer. a home! Free as the wave your coast thus dashes, To glory your young eagle springs! But tho' her eye with terror flashes, Comfort dwells beneath her wings! THE WANDERER. The mother of a young lamb died, And left it helpless on the wild. A shepherd found it, 'twas his pride,— He lov'd it almost like a child,— It never left him—'till one day He looked and 'twas no longer there! “My precious lamb is gone astray! In vain I seek her everywhere! She's gone! my lov'd one's gone!” he cried, “My hope is gone, my joy, my pride!” And only Echo's voice replied, “She's gone! she's gone!” But soon the thoughtless truant yearn'd For him she left so desolate, And when the shepherd home return'd, He found her at his cottage gate! The shepherd did not then disdain The lamb he had so loved before, But took it to his heart again, Forgave it, and it stray'd no more! “She's here!” the exulting shepherd cried, “She never more will quit my side!” And both with Echo now replied, “She's here, she's here!” LEARNING, LOVE, AND VICTORY. I. When the Parson woo'd me, then I could never say “Amen!” When the doctor,—what a pill! His addresses made me ill! When the Lawyer,—what a pest! I was—“non inventus est!” But oh! now the soldier comes, With “presented arms” to me, He may—“Hurrah”—“Victory!” II. What girl in the Parson's whine E'er discover'd aught divine? When did the Physician's art Cure the ague of the heart? Or the Lawyer's habeas move Suitors to the court of Love? But when martial steeds are bounding, And the war-like clarion sounding, Who would not “ground arms” like me? To the “Hurrah,” “Victory!” THE LOSS OF THOSE WE LOVE. The pang, of all severest, Is the deep, withering one, that's borne In being torn From those we love the dearest. Some griefs bear consolation! There's none for this,—no, none! It breaks The heart, and makes The world a desolation! A GIRL'S MESSAGE TO HER LOVER. I. Tell him, though fortune dooms that we must part, I cannot make his image leave my heart; Tell him that they may keep me from him,—yet He's with me still, as though we hourly met. II. Wealth and Glories, tell him, all are dim To the sweet sunshine of one thought of him,— And feelings, deeper than the tongue can tell, Have grown even deeper since I sigh'd Farewell! FIRST LOVE. How refin'd the feeling O'er the bosom stealing, A new sense revealing, In the heart's first love! Its soft spell extending, Smiles to all things lending, The whole world seems blending With the heart's first love! If to new themes turning, Soon, such lightness spurning, Stronger grows our yearning For the heart's first love. THE MEETINGS OF LOVERS. Oh, how sweet, how sweet, The rapture felt at last, Wearisome exile past, When lovers meet, when lovers meet! Then love's sorrow fleet! Hours so hard to bear between Are as though they ne'er had been, When lovers meet, when lovers meet! BEAUTY'S GLANCE. WRITTEN FOR AN INTERLUDE. Woe to the heart! when Beauty's eye O'er its unwaken'd pulse first rushes, Kindling wild visions,—like the sky New lighted up by morning's blushes. For storm-clouds may convulse the air, As the uncertain day advances; And Beauty's eye may flash despair On the adorer of its glances. Ne'er did a sigh this bosom swell Till thy enchantments smil'd around it; And, oh! it trembles now to tell Its throb to her whose spell has bound it. But do not, dearest! do not blame This falt'ring utt'rance of a feeling, My tongue has not the strength to name Nor my heart courage for concealing. Cast one—one rapturing glance, to end The doubt I tremble to discover; I must—I must be—more than friend,— And may I not be—more than lover? THE FORSAKEN. A SONG. Scenes of my childhood, the roseate hours, Passed in your shelter, are faded! Gone are the spirits which gladden'd your bowers, Gone with the pleasures they shaded! Farewell! Dove of the ark! to thee Providence gave Rest, once thy pilgrimage ended! Fate, which flings me on the world-troubled wave Dooms me to toss there unfriended! Ah me! Eyes of affection! Life's pathway no more Beams, with your radiance lighted! Hope, Love, and Friendship, which shone there before Leave me to wander benighted! All's dark! SUNRISE. Hail to thee, orb of morning! O'er the darkness breaking, Earth with thy smile adorning, Man to his God awaking; Hail! Hail! may our devotion be Warm as the light we hail in thee! THE CONSOLATION. Comfort, mourner! why despair? Storm like sunshine 's from on high— Tempest only clears the sky— Man is heaven's peculiar care— Heaven brings joy from misery! Comfort, mourner! why despair? Woe a part is of a plan Ending in the bliss of man— Whereof but a little share Our imperfect sight may scan! Comfort, mourner! why despair? All that is disclos'd we find Proveth an All-bounteous mind— Impious is it then to dare Deem what's undisclos'd unkind! Arouse thee! comfort! Learn to bear! No ill is cureless but despair! UNHALLOWED AND VIRTUOUS LOVE. Unhallow'd love's a withering flame Which kills the heart and blasts the name, By its wild flashes risen; While virtuous love, like sunlight showers, But wakes the heart's most lovely flowers And opens them to heaven. THE WORLD. I. Oh! no! I have no wish to try Those heartless mockeries of joy Whose charm is like the serpent's eye, Which only dazzles to destroy! Ne'er let me be among the mad— Nay, worse,—the guilty million hurl'd,— I never yet have known the bad— I never yet have known the world! II. Can the world aught, for what is this Seclusion I should lose, bestow? Our little home is full of bliss, But the great world is full of woe! My humble heart, like yonder vines Around our lowly cottage curl'd, With all I here have known, entwines,— And here, oh, here shall be my world. BEAUTY SLEEPING. Sweet is her sleep! As moonlight that sleeps on the river Where evening's soft sighs scarcely quiver. Sweet is her sleep! The charm of that beautiful face O'er the image of death beams a grace! Sweet is her sleep! The angel of slumber she seems, Reclined in her heaven of dreams! Sweet is her sleep. THE FRIENDLESS ORPHAN GIRL. WORDS TO AN OLD IRISH MELODY. From slumbers that cheer not, with dawn's blush upspringing Woe-worn, I wander o'er mountain and plain, And hear parent birds to their little ones singing Songs of affection in that touching strain, From others Than mothers We seek for in vain! There's many a tie The world may supply, But oh! there's no other The loss of a mother,— Oh, none! Not one! But scenes of endearment which round me are thronging, Bitterly teach me how much I'm alone! A parent's fond care to all beings belonging— Tenderness ever in infancy shown To others By mothers I never have known! There's many a tie The world might supply, But oh! there's no other The loss of a mother,— Oh, none! Not one! THE HARP. Oh, lady! take the harp, And let the silent string, Exulting at thy touch, Around its magic fling! Enshrin'd there, as in thee Enchantments, slumb'ring deep, Await a master-hand To break their bonds of sleep! Thanks, lady! how the harp, By thee awaken'd, beams The light upon despair Of soft Elysian dreams: Could I but thus awake The slumbering thrill in you, The dreams your harp inspires Your smile would render true. PASSION AND PRAYER. The holy prisoner doom'd to bear Demoniac persecution's chain, Hop'd humbly a protection where Sincerity ne'er hopes in vain! Lo! on the darkness of his cell The glory of an angel flash'd! The jailers slept! the fetters fell! The bolted portals open dash'd. Prisoner of passion! if sincere Your trust in Heaven's protection be, An angel will to you appear, And when least look'd for, set you free! THE HOPES OF YOUTH. To youth, exulting, soon delighted, The coming hours, Seen by Hope's April sunshine, lighted, Blooming with flow'rs Ne'er to be blighted! Proudly the barque Sails, when blue skies and blue seas flatter: The storm comes. Hark— A shriek! her sides the wild waves shatter! She's gone!—all's dark. Such are youth's fairy dreams of gladness;— And thus they end In tempests of unlook'd for sadness,— Tortures,—that send The soul to madness! SLANDER DIES IN LIGHT. I. From the coward who stabs in the dark What valor can give us protection? But once let me know Where to fix on my foe, And see how he'll shrink from detection! II. The pride of the forest, whose strength Bends not to the hurricane's fury, May fall by the sting Of the venomous thing Which the least of its small leaves would bring. III. But, drag forth the reptile, he'll writhe, He'll die when the day-beam is brightening, As the mischievous lie Of the imposture shall die In the blaze of Truth's glorious lightning! TO MISS O'NEIL, THE ACTRESS. Written after sleeping in the room she had occupied the night before. Waterford, Ireland, July, 1814. Oh, deep was the gloom which my spirits deprest, Till each object around breath'd the joy of the past; And the charm of that room lull'd my sorrows to rest, As pure as the bosom which beat in it last! Then my proud love exulted. It felt that the hour Which succeeds common pleasure, is shrouded in woe, But gloried in owning the sway of a power Whose remembrance alone can such comfort bestow! 'Twas a feeling extatic, I blest its control; And your image, still beaming on memory's gaze, Sheds a twilight of joy on my desolate soul, More soft, though less dear, than the noon of its blaze! A SONG IN THE OPERA OF CLARI. In the promise of pleasure, the silly believer, Home forsaking, to brave The betraying world's wave, Is soon taught by woe the truth friendship had spoken, And virtue a wreck,—pleasure's promises broken,— Lost at last, the world's scorn by the wily deceiver, Finds out but too late, that where ever we roam,— There's no pleasure abroad, like the pleasure of Home! But droop not, poor castaway! be not dejected! From the tempest-wave spring! To your wreck'd virtue cling! And be certain the angel of mercy takes care Of the virtue, though erring, that will not despair! Yes! though from the world's heartless bosom rejected, From your home upon earth tho' cast houseless to roam, Throw your glance up to Heaven, and be sure of a Home! THE EXILE. A song written at the request of, and set to music composed by, the celebrated Mr. Heinrich. Far from the land which gave him birth, The lonely exile wandering weary, Feels that the loveliest land on earth, When look'd upon thro' tears, looks dreary. For, oh! when Fortune grew unkind, And in the spell of sorrow bound him, There came a shadow o'er his mind, To darken every object round him. But, as often the sunbeam breaks brilliant and warm On the day whose beginning was coldness and storm, Even thus unexpectedly, fortunes more bright, Now light back the exile to home and delight! And though since his escape, he'll oft gaze from the shore On the billows he saw with such terror before, Yet to think of a peril that's happily past, Only heightens the rapture which follows at last. THE GIRL OF MY HEART. There's nothing, there's nothing so lovely that lives As thou art, dear! There's nothing, there's nothing that pleasure gives, And thou art near! When thou art away the world's brightest charms Look—oh, how drear! But a magic spell its form disarms When thou art near! When thou art away, even summer's beams All cold appear! But the coldest winter a summer seems Beside thee, dear! VALENTINE. ADDRESSED TO MISS FOOT, THE CELEBRATED ACTRESS. Though other eyes have warn'd me, Though other lips have charm'd me, Yet transient was their pow'r, Forgotten in an hour! Those brows of thine which darkle O'er eyes which sweetly sparkle With beams from mind of brightness, And heart of jocund lightness;— Have wing'd, like Cupid's bow, With secret shaft a blow Which binds one, thine forever In chains which cannot sever, Ere this, a captive never. Perhaps, in untold anguish That captive long will languish:— Perhaps, a hidden stranger, He'll guard thy youth from danger:— Perhaps, an unseen spirit, He'll climb thy couch at night, And rock himself to rest Upon thy heaving breast, Or drink the sighs which creep Unconscious through thy sleep. And then, like memory's gleams, Glide softly through thy dreams, And catch without control The breathings of a soul So unstain'd in whiteness, Malice hates its brightness! Nymph, by whom all are charmed, Long may'st thou live unharm'd! —Be world and Fortune kind! Be Argus Envy blind,— And every wish enjoy'd, Save that which would discover Thy Valentine and Lover! PRINCE YPSILANTI'S ADDRESS TO THE GREEKS. Ye Greeks, for deeds of glory fam'd, The gods for freedom have proclaim'd The password's Liberty! Convince the foes of human kind Not adamantine chains can bind The men who dare be free! Leonidas, your sire of old, In deeds of arms proud Xerxes told At fam'd Thermopylæ, That he and his brave patriot band Could die to save their native land, Or perish to be free! Immortal honors crown your deeds, To victory Ypsilanti leads— Now strike for Liberty! Teach the oppressors of mankind No manacles on earth can bind The men who dare be free! SCENE FROM AN UNPUBLISHED PLAY. BY JOHN HOWARD PAYNE. Argument. Early in life Bianca of Naples returned the love of the reckless and enthusiastic Hyppolito, but his father thought a wealthier wife might be found, and sent the youth abroad; at sea he was wrecked, but saved by pirates and detained a captive. Being supposed dead by his family and Bianca, she is at length prevailed on to listen to a new suitor. She weds a Spaniard by the name of Alvar, equally a devotee to her and to the fine arts, and who met her when he visited Italy on a tour of taste. Hyppolito, escaping, returns, and hears that his betrothed is lost to him. In madness he pursues her to her dwelling in Barcelona, and, being skilled in the pencil, obtains access to her husband by spreading his fame abroad as an Italian painter of eminence, hurrying through the city. Alvar has seen his sketches, and earnestly desires from him a portrait of Bianca. On a carnival night, when she is masked for the festivities, Hyppolito consents, as a special favor to Don Alvar, to spare an hour for a sitting. His object may be guessed. It is a delirious desire to disclose himself, and carry her away with him in the confusion of the masquerade. The scene here given describes the introduction of the imagined painter. SCENE. An apartment in Don Alvar's palace at Barcelona. Busts—statues—an easel— swing-glass—painting apparatus. Don Alvar enters, leading Bianca, both sumptuously habited in masquerade dresses, Bianca as a Sultana. Hyppolito follows as a painter, completely disguised. He takes his colors and pencils from an attendant. While he arranges them and reconnoitres the room, Alvar and Bianca converse apart at the front. Bianca. (To Alvar aside.) Who is this painter? Were't not well, my lord, That he should come to-morrow, not to-night? His look is strange. You must not leave me here— I know not why—I feel a sudden dread— His countenance is wild—What is his name? Alvar. And why so fanciful, my gentle love? The Signor's name is Manso—known to all As a most famous artist. He has come To Barcelona but this morn; and flies To-morrow—Heav'n knows where!—(to Hyppolito.) Sir, is this place The one that suits your art?—Sit here, Bianca, (Aside to her.) How your hand trembles! I'll stay with you, love! Hyp. (Preparing to paint.) A little from the light—a little more! (Aside.) His glance is keen—those lights will show my face— (He tries to sketch, and stops.) Pray you, my lord, a little farther back— The lights fall on your robe—or, take your place— (—Your pardon, lord)—behind me till the sketch Is made—(he tries, and flings down the pencil in vexation.) Corpo di Giovo, wrong!—This crowd of lights— (Pointing with a fretted gesture to the lamps on the table.) Alv. (To Cariola.) Go—carry off those lamps—their varying blaze Will mar the pencil. Benedetto! Order the train to hold themselves prepared To wait upon your lady to the fête. [Benedetto and other servants go out, carrying the lamps, and leaving but one light beside the casel. Hyppolito paints.] Hyp. Please you, fair lady, cast your eyes above— Ha! so—as if you gazed upon some star! (Looking at her.) Now press your hand—deeply—upon your heart As if you vowed that heart's fidelity And sealed it by your hopes of love in Heaven. Alv. A most romantic painter! But his art Or finds men mad, or makes them so—That touch (Looking at the picture.) Is life—I see the master-hand! How fine The power to fix the hue of beauty's cheek, The sparkling of the diamond eye,—the look That speaks without a tongue, yet speaks the soul Quicker than tongue e'er uttered—Glorious art! That, with the power of miracle, defies The truth of time, the blight of worldly woe, All earthly trouble! On its tablet smiles Beauty unsullied; cheeks unwash'd by tears; Lips that will ne'er grow pale with anxious sighs; Youth, love, and loveliness, alike immortal! (He looks at the picture.) Magnificent! Divine! The artist does you justice, my Bianca. Bian. My lord turn'd flatterer! Nay, I fear I'll shame The Signor Manso's pencil. Hyp. 'Tis but honor'd Too highly in its subject.—Now look down— —Heavens, what a rich possession!—(to her.) But one smile— (As in soliloquy.) The arching of that brow—that dazzling eye— That lip to which the budding of the rose Were colorless and chill—Thou paragon!— Bian. (Aside, agitated at half overhearing him.) What words are those? Some pressure on my soul Tells me there's evil nigh! (Aside to Alvar.) Alvar! My lord! Stay by me.—Will the Signor soon be done?— Alv. Disturb him not, my love. He touches now The finest lines of his most lovely work. (Looking over the sketch.) Bravo, Signor! A Titian were outdone With that delicious coloring. That glow Is worthy the Venetian. Hyp. I was his pupil— An idle one—but worshipped at his feet For some wild years, enamor'd of the fame, The glory that he threw around his land! But, when he died, I hated Venice—fled— And wander'd, on a painter's pilgrimage, To every shrine of loveliness. Bian. (Aside.) He gazes on me strangely. If on earth There's magic in a glance—delusion wild, Or dangerous spell, 'tis in that fiery eye! Would that his work were done!— (To Alvar.) How goes the hour, my lord? Your noble friend Will think his banquet scorn'd by our delay. Hyp. (Gazing on her.) One look—but one look, gentle lady, one And all is finished—Pray you, draw aside That tress which hangs upon your brow like braids Of silk on ivory. (Aside.) There's a living smile! A glance that strikes the soul like sudden flame! Alv. (Gazing on the picture.) It grows in light and beauty, as the sky Before the rosy chariot the morn!— —Signor, your task is finish'd for to-night, And richly finish'd. My lady well reminds me 'twill be late Before we reach our kinsman's.—(To Bianca.) Come, my love! Bian. (Aside.) Thanks, all ye saints that guard the heart from ill! Hyp. One moment more. This must be done to-night, Or may-be never. By to-morrow's dawn I leave the walls of Barcelona. Bian. Nay, Alvar, come—'tis finish'd—lose no time— (Urging him.) We must not fail in courtesy. Alv. (Looking at the picture.) 'Tis beautiful!—(Then turning to Bianca.) Yet still, how feebly art Contends with nature, when that nature's thine! He that can thaw the ice with pictured flame, Or banish darkness by a painted sun, Or fill the summer sky with painted gold, Or shower the spring's sweet lap with painted buds, He may portray the living witchery Of woman in her beauty—but none else! Hyp. Fair lady, look again— Alv. Yes—rest awhile— I will but go a moment, to command That all be ready for our cavalcade. (To Hyppolito.) Signor! the moment you sought is given— I shall return—(to Bianca)—as swift as thoughts of love! [Exit Alvar. Hyp. (Looking after Alvar—aside.) He's gone!—Now, love and vengeance! (Starts up, throws off his disguise, and exclaims,) Bianca! Bian. (Terrified and springing back.) Hyppolito!—</field>
