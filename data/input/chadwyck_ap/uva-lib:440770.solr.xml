      <field name="fulltext">THE SYROPHENICIAN WOMAN Joy to my bosom! rest to my fear! Judea's prophet draweth near! Joy to my bosom! peace to my heart! Sickness and sorrow before him depart! Rack'd with agony and pain, Writhing, long my child has lain; Now the prophet draweth near, All our griefs shall disappear. âLord!â she cried with mournful breath, âSave! Oh, save my child from death!â But as though she was unheard, Jesus answered not a word. With a purpose naught could move, And the seal of woman's love, Down she knelt in anguish wildâ âMaster! save, Oh! save my child!â â'Tis not meet,â the Savior said, âThus to waste the children's bread; I am only sent to seek Israel's lost and scattered sheep.â âTrue,â she said, âOh, gracious Lord, True and faithful is thy word: But the humblest, meanest, may Eat the crumbs they cast away.â âWoman,â said th' astonish'd Lord, âBe it even as thy word! By thy faith that knows no fail, Thou hast ask'd, and shalt prevail.â THE SLAVE MOTHER Heard you that shriek? It rose So wildly on the air, It seemed as if a burden'd heart Was breaking in despair. Saw you those hands so sadly claspedâ The bowed and feeble handâ The shuddering of that fragile formâ That look of grief and dread? Saw you the sad, imploring eye? Its every glance was pain, As if a storm of agony Were sweeping through the brain. She is a mother, pale with fear, Her boy clings to her side, And in her kirtle vainly tries His trembling form to hide. He is not hers, although she bore For him a mother's pains; He is not hers, although her blood Is coursing through his veins! He is not hers, for cruel hands May rudely tear apart The only wreath of household love That binds her breaking heart. His love has been a joyous light That o'er her pathway smiled, A fountain gushing ever new, Amid life's desert wild. His lightest word has been a tone Of music round her heart, Their lives a streamlet blent in oneâ Oh, Father! must they part? They tear him from her circling arms, Her last and fond embrace. Oh! never more may her sad eyes Gaze on his mournful face. No marvel, then, these bitter shrieks Disturb the listening air; She is a mother, and her heart Is breaking in despair. BIBLE DEFENCE OF SLAVERY Take sackcloth of the darkest dye, And shroud the pulpits round! Servants of Him that cannot lie, Sit mourning on the ground. Let holy horror blanch each cheek, Pale every brow with fears: And rocks and stones, if ye could speak, Ye well might melt to tears! Let sorrow breathe in every tone, In every strain ye raise; Insult not God's majestic throne With th' mockery of praise. A reverend man, whose light should be The guide of age and youth, Brings to the shrine of slavery The sacrifice of truth! For the direst wrong of man imposed, Since Sodom's fearful cry, The word of life has been enclosed, To give your God the lie. Oh! when we pray for the heathen lands, And plead for their dark shores, Remember Slavery's cruel hands Make heathens at your doors! ELIZA HARRIS Like a fawn from the arrow, startled and wild, A woman swept by us, bearing a child; In her eyes was the night of a settled despair, And her brow was o'ershaded with anguish and care. She was nearing the riverâin reaching the brink, She heeded no danger, she paused not to think; For she is a motherâher child is a slaveâ And she'll give him his freedom, or find him a grave! It was a vision to haunt us, that innocent faceâ So pale in its aspect, so fair in its grace; As the tramp of the horse and the bay of the hound, With the fetters that gall, were trailing the ground! She was nerv'd by despair, and strengthened by woe, As she leap'd o'er the chasms that yawn'd from below; Death howl'd in the tempest, and rav'd in the blast, But she heard not the sound till the danger was past. Oh! how shall I speak of my proud country's shame Of the stains on her glory, how give them their name? How say that her banner in mockery wavesâ Her star-spangled bannerâo'er millions of slaves? How say that the lawless may torture and chase A woman whose crime is the hue of her face? How the depths of the forest may echo around With the shrieks of despair, and the bay of the hound? With her step on the ice, and her arm on her child, The danger was fearful, the pathway was wild; But, aided by Heaven, she gained a free shore, Where the friends of humanity open'd their door. So fragile and lovely, so fearfully pale, Like a lily that bends to the breath of the gale, Save the heave of her breast, and the sway of her hair, You'd have thought her a statue of fear and despair. In agony close to her bosom she press'd The life of her heart, the child of her breastâ Oh! love from its tenderness gathering might, Had strengthen'd her soul for the dangers of light. But she's free:âyes, free from the land where the slave From the hound of oppression must rest in the grave; Where bondage and torture, where scourges and drains Have plac'd on our banner indelible stains. The bloodhounds have miss'd the scent of her way; The hunter is rifled and foil'd of his prey; Fierce jargon and cursing, with clanking of chains, Make sounds of strange discord on Liberty's plains. With the rapture of love and fulness of bliss, She plac'd on his brow a mother's fond kiss:â Oh! poverty, danger and death she can brave, For the child of her love is no longer a slave! ETHIOPIA Yes! Ethiopia yet shall stretch Her bleeding hands abroad; Her cry of agony shall reach The burning throne of God. The tyrant's yoke from off her neck, His fetters from her soul, The mighty hand of God shall break, And spurn the base control. Redeemed from dust and freed from chains, Her sons shall lift their eyes; From cloud-capt hills and verdant plains Shall shouts of triumph rise. Upon her dark, despairing brow, Shall play a smile of peace; For God shall bend unto her wo, And bid her sorrows cease. 'Neath sheltering vines and stately palms Shall laughing children play, And aged sires with joyous psalms Shall gladden every day. Secure by night, and blest by day, Shall pass her happy hours; Nor human tigers hunt for prey Within her peaceful bowers. Then, Ethiopia! stretch, oh! stretch Thy bleeding hands abroad; Thy cry of agony shall reach And find redress from God. THE DRUNKARD'S CHILD He stood beside his dying child, With a dim and bloodshot eye; They'd won him from the haunts of vice To see his first-born die. He came with a slow and staggering tread, A vague, unmeaning stare, And, reeling, clasped the clammy hand, So deathly pale and fair. In a dark and gloomy chamber, Life ebbing fast away, On a coarse and wretched pallet, The dying sufferer lay: A smile of recognition Lit up the glazing eye; âI'm very glad,â it seemed to say, âYou've come to see me die.â That smile reached to his callous heart, It sealed fountains stirred; He tried to speak, but on his lips Faltered and died each word. And burning tears like rain Poured down his bloated face, Where guilt, remorse and shame Had scathed, and left their trace. âMy father!â said the dying child, (His voice was faint and low,) âOh! clasp me closely to your heart, And kiss me ere I go. Bright angels beckon me away, To the holy city fairâ Oh! tell me, Father, ere I go, Say, will you meet me there?â He clasped him to his throbbing heart, âI will! I will!â he said; His pleading ceasedâthe father held His first-born and his dead! The marble brow, with golden curls, Lay lifeless on his breast; Like sunbeams on the distant clouds Which line the gorgeous west. THE SLAVE AUCTION The sale beganâyoung girls were there, Defenceless in their wretchedness, Whose stifled sobs of deep despair Revealed their anguish and distress. And mothers stood with streaming eyes, And saw their dearest children sold; Unheeded rose their bitter cries, While tyrants bartered them for gold. And woman, with her love and truthâ For these in sable forms may dwellâ Gaz'd on the husband of her youth, With anguish none may paint or tell. And men, whose sole crime was their hue, The impress of their Maker's hand, And frail and shrinking children, too, Were gathered in that mournful band. Ye who have laid your love to rest, And wept above their lifeless clay, Know not the anguish of that breast, Whose lov'd are rudely torn away. Ye may not know how desolate Are bosoms rudely forced to part, And how a dull and heavy weight Will press the life-drops from the heart. THE REVEL âHe knoweth not that the dead are there.â In yonder halls reclining Are forms surpassing fair, And brilliant lights are shining, But, oh! the dead are there! There's music, song and dance, There's banishment of care, And mirth in every glance, But, oh! the dead are there! The wine cup's sparkling glow Blends with the viands rare, There's revelry and show, But still, the dead are there! 'Neath that flow of song and mirth Runs the current of despair, But the simple sons of earth Know not the dead are there! They'll shudder start and tremble, They'll weep in wild despair When the solemn truth breaks on them, That the dead, the dead are there! THAT BLESSED HOPE Oh! crush it not, that hope so blest, Which cheers the fainting heart, And points it to the coming rest, Where sorrow has no part. Tear from my heart each worldly prop, Unbind each earthly string, But to this blest and glorious hope, Oh! let my spirit cling. It cheer'd amid the days of old Each holy patriarch's breast; It was an anchor to their souls, Upon it let me rest. When wandering in dens and caves, In sheep and goat skins dress'd, A peel'd and scatter'd people learned To know this hope was blest. Help me, amidst this world of strife, To long for Christ to reign, That when He brings the crown of life, I may that crown obtain! THE DYING CHRISTIAN The light was faintly streaming Within a darkened room, Where a woman, faint and feeble, Was sinking to the tomb. The silver cord was loosened, We knew that she must die; We read the mournful token In the dimness of her eye. We read it in the radiance That lit her pallid cheek, And the quivering of the feeble lip, Too faint its joys to speak. Like a child oppressed with slumber, She calmly sank to rest, With her trust in her Redeemer, And her heart upon His breast. She faded from our vision, Like a thing of love and light; But we feel she lives for ever, A spirit pure and bright. REPORT I heard, my young friend You were seeking a wife, A woman to make Your companion for life. Now, if you are seeking A wife for your youth, Let this be your aim, thenâ Seek a woman of truth. She may not have talents, With greatness combined, Her gifts may be humble, Of person and mind: But if she be constant, And gentle, and true, Believe me my friend, She's the woman for you! Oh! wed not for beauty, Though fair is the prize; It may pall when you grasp it, And fade in your eyes. Let gold not allure you, Let wealth not attract; With a house full of treasure, A woman may lack. Let her habits be frugal, Her hands not afraid To work in her household Or follow her trade. Let her language be modest, Her actions discreet; Her manners refined, And free from deceit. Now if such you should find, In your journey through life, Just open your mind, And make her your wife. ADVICE TO THE GIRLS Nay, do not blush! I only heard You had a mind to marry; I thought I'd speak a friendly word, So just one moment tarry. Wed not a man whose merit lies In things of outward show, In raven hair or flashing eyes, That please your fancy so. But marry one who's good and kind, And free from all pretence; Who, if without a gifted mind, At least has common sense. SAVED BY FAITH âShe said, if I may but touch his clothes, I shall be whole.â Life to her no brightness brought, Pale and striken was her brow, Till a bright and joyous thought Lit the darkness of her woe. Long had sickness on her preyed, Strength from every nerve had gone; Skill and art could give no aid: Thus her weary life passed on. Like a sad and mournful dream, Daily felt she life depart, Hourly knew the vital stream Left the fountain of her heart. He who lull'd the storm to rest, Cleans'd the lepers, raised the dead, Whilst a crowd around him press'd, Near that suffering one did tread. Nerv'd by blended hope and fear, Reasoned thus her anxious heart; âIf to touch Him I draw near, All my suffering shall depart. âWhile the crowd around him stand, I will touch,â the sufferer said; Forth she reached her timid handâ As she touched her sickness fled. âWho hath touched me?â Jesus cried; âVirtue from my body gone.â From the crowd a voice replied, âWhy inquire in such a throng?â Faint with fear through every limb, Yet too grateful to deny, Tremblingly she knelt to him, âLord!â she answered, âit was I!â Kindly, gently, Jesus saidâ Words like balm unto her soulâ âPeace upon thy life be shed! âChild! thy faith has made thee whole!â DIED OF STARVATION They forced him into prison, Because he begged for bread; âMy wife is starvingâdying!â In vain the poor man plead. See this case, as touchingly related in Oliver Twist, by Dickens. They forced him into prison, Strong bars enclosed the walls, While the rich and proud were feasting Within their sumptuous halls. He'd striven long with anguish, Had wrestled with despair; But his weary heart was breaking 'Neath its crushing load of care. And he prayed them in that prison, âOh, let me seek my wife!â For he knew that want was feeding On the remnant of her life. That night his wife lay moaning Upon her bed in pain; Hunger gnawing at her vitals, Fever scorching through her brain. She wondered at his tarrying, He was not wont to stay; 'Mid hunger, pain and watching, The moments waned away. Sadly crouching by the embers, Her famished children lay; And she longed to gaze upon them, As her spirit passed away. But the embers were too feeble, She could not see each face, So she clasped her arms around themâ 'Twas their mother's last embrace. They loosed him from his prison, As a felon from his chain; Though his strength was hunger bitten, He sought his home again. Just as her spirit linger'd On Time's receding shore, She heard his welcome footstep On the threshold of the door. He was faint and spirit-broken, But, rousing from despair, He clasped her icy fingers, As she breathed her dying prayer. With a gentle smile and blessing, Her spirit winged its flight, As the morn, in all its glory, Bathed the world in dazzling light. There was weeping, bitter weeping, In the chamber of the dead, For well the stricken husband knew She had died for want of bread. A MOTHER'S HEROISM When the noble mother of Lovejoy heard of her son's death, she said, âIt is well! I had rather he should die so than desert his principles.â The murmurs of a distant strife Fell on a mother's ear; Her son had yielded up his life, Mid scenes of wrath and fear. They told her how he'd spent his breath In pleading for the dumb, And how the glorious martyr wreath Her child had nobly won. They told her of his courage high, Mid brutal force and might; How he had nerved himself to die In battling for the right. It seemed as if a fearful storm Swept wildly round her soul; A moment, and her fragile form Bent 'neath its fierce control. From lip and brow the color fledâ But light flashed to her eye: â'Tis well! 'tis well!â the mother said, âThat thus my child should die. â'Tis well that, to his latest breath, He plead for liberty; Truth nerved him for the hour of death, And taught him how to die. âIt taught him how to cast aside Earth's honors and renown; To trample on her fame and pride, And win a martyr's crown.â THE FUGITIVE'S WIFE It was my sad and weary lot To toil in slavery; But one thing cheered my lowly cotâ My husband was with me. One evening, as our children played Around our cabin door, I noticed on his brow a shade I'd never seen before; And in his eyes a gloomy night Of anguish and despair;â I gazed upon their troubled light, To read the meaning there. He strained me to his heaving heartâ My own beat wild with fear; I knew not, but I sadly felt There might be evil near. He vainly strove to cast aside The tears that fell like rain:â Too frail, indeed, is manly pride, To strive with grief and pain. Again he clasped me to his breast, And said that we must part: I tried to speakâbut, oh! it seemed An arrow reached my heart. âBear not,â I cried, âunto your grave, The yoke you've borne from birth; No longer live a helpless slave, The meanest thing on earth!â THE CONTRAST They scorned her for her sinning, Spoke harshly of her fall, Nor let the hand of mercy To break her hated thrall. The dews of meek repentance Stood in her downcast eye: Would no one heed her anguish? All pass her coldly by? From the cold, averted glances Of each reproachful eye, She turned aside, heart-broken, And laid her down to die. And where was he, who sullied Her once unspotted name; Who lured her from life's brightness To agony and shame? Who left her on life's billows, A wrecked and ruined thing; Who brought the winter of despair Upon Hope's blooming spring? Through the halls of wealth and fashion In gaiety and pride, He was leading to the altar A fair and lovely bride! None scorned him for his sinning, Few saw it through his gold; His crimes were only foibles, And these were gently told. Before him rose a vision, A maid of beauty rare; Then a pale, heart-broken woman, The image of despair. Next came a sad procession, With many a sob and tear; A widow'd, childless mother Totter'd by an humble bier. The vision quickly faded, The sad, unwelcome sight; But his lip forgot its laughter, And his eye its careless light. A moment, and the flood-gates Of memory opened wide; And remorseful recollection Flowed like a lava tide. That widow's wail of anguish Seemed strangely blending there, And mid the soft lights floated That image of despair. THE PRODIGAL'S RETURN He cameâa wanderer; years of sin Had blanched his blooming cheek, Telling a tale of strife within, That words might vainly speak. His feet were bare, his garments torn, His brow was deathly white; His heart was bleeding, crushed and worn, His soul had felt a blight. His father saw him; pity swept And yearn'd through every vein; He ran and clasp'd his child, and wept, Murm'ring, âHe lives again!â âFather, I've come, but not to claim Aught from thy love or grace; I come, a child of guilt and shame, To beg a servant's place.â âEnough! enough!â the father said, âBring robes of princely cost!ââ The past with all its shadows fled, For now was found the lost. âPut shoes upon my poor child's feet, With rings his hand adorn, And bid my house his coming greet With music, dance and song.â Oh! Saviour, mid this world of strife, When wayward here we roam, Conduct us to the paths of life, And guide us safely home. Then in thy holy courts above, Thy praise our lips shall sound, While angels join our song of love, That we, the lost are found! EVA'S FAREWELL Farewell, father! I am a dying, Going to the âglory land,â Where the sun is ever shining, And the zephyr's ever bland. Where the living fountains flowing, Quench the pining spirit's thirst; Where the tree of life is growing, Where the crystal fountains burst. Father! hear that music holy Floating from the spirit land! At the pearly gates of glory, Radiant angels waiting stand. Father! kiss your dearest Eva, Press her cold and clammy hand, Ere the glittering hosts receive her, Welcome to their cherub band. THE TENNESSEE HERO âHe had heard his comrades plotting to obtain their liberty, and rather than betray them he received 750 lashes and died.â He stood before the savage throng, The base and coward crew; A tameless light flashed from his eye, His heart beat firm and true. He was the hero of his band, The noblest of them all; Though fetters galled his weary limbs, His spirit spurned their thrall. And towered, in its manly might, Above the murderous crew. Oh! liberty had nerved his heart, And every pulse beat true. âNow tell us,â said the savage troop, âAnd life thy gain shall be! Who are the men that plotting, sayâ âThey must and will be free!ââ Oh, could you have seen the hero then, As his lofty soul arose, And his dauntless eyes defiance flashed On his mean and craven foes! âI know the men who would be free; They are the heroes of your land; But death and torture I defy, Ere I betray that band. âAnd what! oh, what is life to me, Beneath your base control? Nay! do your worst. Ye have no chains To bind my free-born soul.â They brought the hateful lash and scourge, With murder in each eye. But a solemn vow was on his lipsâ He had resolved to die. Yes, rather than betray his trust, He'd meet a death of pain; 'Twas sweeter far to meet it thus Than wear a treason stain! Like storms of wrath, of hate and pain, The blows rained thick and fast; But the monarch soul kept true Till the gates of life were past. And the martyr spirit fled To the throne of God on high, And showed his gaping wounds Before the unslumbering eye. FREE LABOR I wear an easy garment, O'er it no toiling slave Wept tears of hopeless anguish, In his passage to the grave. And from its ample folds Shall rise no cry to God, Upon its warp and woof shall be No stain of tears and blood. Oh, lightly shall it press my form, Unladen with a sigh, I shall not 'mid its rustling hear, Some sad despairing cry. This fabric is too light to bear The weight of bondsmen's tears, I shall not in its texture trace The agony of years. Too light to bear a smother'd sigh, From some lorn woman's heart, Whose only wreath of household love Is rudely torn apart. Then lightly shall it press my form, Unburden'd by a sigh; And from its seams and folds shall rise, No voice to pierce the sky, And witness at the throne of God, In language deep and strong, That I have nerv'd Oppression's hand, For deeds of guilt and wrong. LINES At the Portals of the Future Full of madness, guilt and gloom, Stood the hateful form of Slavery, Crying, âGive, Oh! give me roomâ âRoom to smite the earth with cursing, Room to scatter, rend and slay, From the trembling mother's bosom Room to tear her child away; âRoom to trample on the manhood Of the country far and wide; Room to spread o'er every Eden Slavery's scorching lava-tide.â Pale and trembling stood the Future, Quailing 'neath his frown of hate, As he grasped with bloody clutches The great keys of Doom and Fate. In his hand he held a banner All festooned with blood and tears: 'Twas a fearful ensign, woven With the grief and wrong of years. On his brow he wore a helmet Decked with strange and cruel art; Every jewel was a life-drop Wrung from some poor broken heart. Though her cheek was pale and anxious, Wet, with look and brow sublime, By the pale and trembling Future Stood the Crisis of our time. And from many a throbbing bosom Came the words in fear and gloom, âTell us, oh! thou coming Crisis, What shall be our country's doom? âShall the wings of dark destruction Brood and hover o'er our land, Till we trace the steps of ruin By their blight, from strand to strand?â With a look and voice prophetic Spake the solemn Crisis then: âI have only mapped the future For the erring sons of men. âIf ye strive for Truth and Justice, If ye battle for the Right, Ye shall lay you, hands all strengthened On God's robe of love and light; âBut if ye trample on His children, To his ear will float each groan, Jar the cords that bind them to Him, And they'll vibrate at his throne. âAnd the land that forges fetters, Binds the weak and poor in chains, Must in blood or tears of sorrow Wash away her guilty stains.â THE DISMISSAL OF TYNG âWe have but three words to say, âserved him right.ââ Church Journal (Episcopal) Served him right! How could he dare To touch the idol of our day? What if its shrine be red with blood? Why, let him turn his eyes away. Who dares dispute our right to bind With galling chains the weak and poor? To starve and crush the deathless mind, Or hunt the slave from door to door? Who dares dispute our right to sell The mother from her weeping child? To hush with ruthless stripes and blows Her shrieks and sobs of anguish wild? 'Tis right to plead for heathen lands, To send the Bible to their shores, And then to make, for power and pelf, A race of heathens at our door. What holy horror filled our heartsâ It shook our church from dome to naveâ Our cheeks grew pale with pious dread, To hear him breathe the name of slave. Upon our Zion, fair and strong, His words fell like a fearful blight; We turned him from our silent fold; And this we did to âserve him right.â THE SLAVE MOTHER, a Tale of the Ohio I have but four, the treasures of my soul, They lay like doves around my heart; I tremble lest some cruel hand Should tear my household wreaths apart. My baby girl, with childish glance, Looks curious in my anxious eye, She little knows that for her sake Deep shadows round my spirit lie. My playful boys could I forget, My home might seem a joyous spot, But with their sunshine mirth I blend The darkness of their future lot. And thou my babe, my darling one, My last, my loved, my precious child, Oh! when I think upon thy doom My heart grows faint and then throbs wild. The Ohio's bridged and spanned with ice, The northern star is shining bright, I'll take the nestlings of my heart And search for freedom by its light. Winter and night were on the earth, And feebly moaned the shivering trees, A sigh of winter seemed to run Through every murmur of the breeze. She fled, and with her children all, She reached the stream and crossed it o'er, Bright visions of deliverance came Like dreams of plenty to the poor. Dreams! vain dreams, heroic mother, Give all thy hopes and struggles o'er, The pursuer is on thy track, And the hunter at thy door. Judea's refuge cities had power To shelter, shield and save, E'en Rome had altars, 'neath whose shade Might crouch the wan and weary slave. But Ohio had no sacred fane, To human rights so consecrated, Where thou may'st shield thy hapless ones From their darkly gathering fate. Then, said the mournful mother, If Ohio cannot save, I will do a deed for freedom, Shalt find each child a grave. I will save my precious children From their darkly threatened doom, I will hew their path to freedom Through the portals of the tomb. A moment in the sunlight, She held a glimmering knife, The next moment she had bathed it In the crimson fount of life. They snatched away the fatal knife, Her boys shrieked wild with dread; The baby girl was pale and cold, They raised it up, the child was dead. Sends this deed of fearful daring Through my country's heart no thrill, Do the icy hands of slavery Every pure emotion chill? Oh! if there is any honor, Truth or justice in the land, Will ye not, us men and Christians, On the side of freedom stand? RIZPAH, THE DAUGHTER OF AI Tidings! sad tidings for the daughter of Ai, They are bearing her prince and loved away, Destruction falls like a mournful pall On the fallen house of ill-fated Saul. And Rizpah hears that her loved must die, But she hears it all with a tearless eye; And clasping her hand with grief and dread She meekly bows her queenly head. The blood has left her blanching cheek, Her quivering lips refuse to speak, Oh! grief like hers has learned no toneâ A world of grief is all its own. But the deed is done, and the hand is stay'd That havoc among the brethren made, And Rizpah takes her lowly seat To watch the princely dead at her feet. The jackall crept out with a stealthy tread, To batten and feast on the noble dead; The vulture bore down with a heavy wing To dip his beak in life's stagnant spring. The hyena heard the jackall's howl, And he bounded forth with a sullen growl, When Rizpah's shriek rose on the air Like a tone from the caverns of despair. She sprang from her sad and lowly seat, For a moment her heart forgot to beat, And the blood rushes up to her marble cheek And a flash to her eye so sad and meek. The vulture paused in his downward flight, As she raised her form to its queenly height, The hyena's eye had a horrid glare As he turned again to his desert lair. The jackall slunk back with a quickened tread, From his cowardly search of Rizpah's dead; Unsated he turned from the noble prey, Subdued by the glance of the daughter of Ai. Of grief! that a mother's heart should know, Such a weary weight of consuming wo, For seldom if ever earth has known Such love as the daughter of Ai hath known. RUTH AND NAOMI âTurn my daughters, full of wo, Is my heart so sad and lone? Leave me childrenâI would go To my loved and distant home. âFrom my bosom death has torn Husband, children, all my stay, Left me not a single one, For my life's declining day. âWant and wo surround my way, Grief and famine where I tread; In my native land they say God is giving Jacob bread.â Naomi ceased, her daughters wept, Their yearning hearts were filled; Falling upon her withered neck, Their grief in tears distill'd. Like rain upon a blighted tree, The tears of Orpah fell Kissing the pale and quivering lip, She breathed her sad farewell. But Ruth stood up, on her brow There lay a heavenly calm; And from her lips came, soft and low Words like a holy charm. âI will not leave thee, on thy brow Are lines of sorrow, age and care; They form is bent, thy step is slow, They bosom stricken, lone and sear. âOh! when thy heart and home were glad, I freely shared thy joyous lot; And now that heart is lone and sad, Cease to entreatâI'll leave thee not. âOh! if a lofty palace proud Thy future home shall be; Where sycophants around thee crowd, I'll share that home with thee. âAnd if on earth the humblest spot, Thy future home shall prove; I'll bring into thy lonely lot The wealth of woman's love. âGo where thou wilt, my steps are there, Our path in life is one; Thou hast no lot I will not share, 'Till life itself be done. âMy country and my home for thee, I freely, willingly resign, Thy people shall my people be, Thy God he shall be mine. âThen, mother dear, entreat me not To turn from following thee; My heart is nerved to share thy lot, Whatever that may be.â MOSES A STORY OF THE NILE Chapter I THE PARTING Moses Kind and gracious princess, more than friend, I've come to thank thee for thy goodness, And to breathe into thy generous ears My last and sad farewell. I go to join The fortunes of my race, and to put aside All other bright advantages, save The approval of my conscience and the meed Of rightly doing. Princess What means, my son, this strange election? What wild chimera floats across thy mind? What sudden impulse moves thy soul? Thou who Hast only trod the court of kings, why seek Instead the paths of labor? Thou, whose limbs Have known no other grab than that which well Befits our kingly state, why rather choose The badge of servitude and toil? Moses Let me tell thee, gracious princess; 'tis no Sudden freak nor impulse wild that moves my mind. I feel an earnest purpose binding all My soul until a strong resolve, which bids Me put aside all other ends and aims, Until the hour shall come when Godâthe God Our fathers loved and worshippedâshall break our chains, And lead our willing feet to freedom. Princess Listen to me, Moses: thou art young, And the warm blood of youth flushes thy veins Like generous wine; thou wearest thy manhood Like a crown; but what king e'er cast His diadem in the dust, to be trampled Down by every careless foot? Thou hast Bright dreams and glowing hopes; could'st thou not live Them out as well beneath the radiance Of our throne as in the shadow of those Bondage-darkened huts? Moses Within those darkened huts my mother plies her tasks, My father bends to unrequited toil; And bitter tears moisten the bread my brethren eat. And when I gaze upon their cruel wrongs The very purple on my limbs seems drenched With blood, the warm blood of my own kindred race; And then thy richest viands pall upon my taste, And discord jars in every tone of song. I cannot live in pleasure while they faint In pain. Princess How like a dream the past floats back: it seems But yesterday when I lay tossing upon My couch of pain, a torpor creeping through Each nerve, a fever coursing through my veins. And there I lay, dreaming of lilies fair, Of lotus flowers and past delights, and all The bright, glad hopes, that give to early life Its glow and flush; and thus day after day Dragged its slow length along, until, one morn, The breath of lilies, fainting on the air, Floated into my room, and then I longed once more To gaze upon the Nile, as on the face Of a familiar friend, whose absence long Had made a mournful void within the heart. I summoned to my side my maids, and bade Them place my sandals on my feet, and lead Me to the Nile, where I might bathe my weary Limbs within the cooling flood, and gather Healing from the sacred stream. I sought my favorite haunt, and, bathing, found New tides of vigor coursing through my veins. Refreshed, I sat me down to weave a crown of lotus leaves And lilies fair, and while I sat in a sweet Revery, dreaming of life and hope, I saw A little wicker-basket hidden among The flags and lilies of the Nile, and I called My maidens and said, âNillias and Osiris, Bring me that little ark which floats beside The stream.â They ran and brought me a precious burden. 'Twas an ark woven with rushes and daubed With slime, and in it lay a sleeping child; His little hand amid his clustering curls, And a bright flush upon his glowing cheek. He wakened with a smile, and reached out his hand To meet the welcome of the mother's kiss, When strange faces met his gaze, and he drew back With a grieved, wondering look, while disappointment Shook the quivering lip that missed the mother's Wonted kiss, and the babe lifted his voice and wept. Then my heart yearned towards him, and I resolved That I would brave my father's wrath and save The child; but while I stood gazing upon His wondrous beauty, I saw beside me A Hebrew girl, her eyes bent on me With an eager, questioning look, and drawing Near, she timidly said, âShall I call a nurse?â I bade her go; she soon returned, and with her Came a woman of the Hebrew race, whose Sad, sweet, serious eyes seemed overflowing With a strange and sudden joy. I placed the babe Within her arms and said, âNurse this child for me;â And the babe nestled there like one at home, While o'er the dimples of his face rippled The brightest, sweetest smiles, and I was well Content to leave him in her care; and well Did she perform her part. When many days had Passed she brought the child unto the palace; And one morning, while I sat toying with His curls and listening to the prattle of his Untrained lips, my father, proud and stately, Saw me bending o'er the child and said, âCharmian, whose child is this? who of my lords Calls himself father to this goodly child? He surely must be a happy man.â Then I said, âFather, he is mine. He is a Hebrew child that I have saved from death.â He Suddenly recoiled, as if an adder Had stung him, and said, âCharmian, take that Child hence. How darest thou bring a member Of that mean and servile race within my doors? Nay, rather let me send for Nechos, whose Ready sword shall rid me of his hateful presence.â Then kneeling at his feet, and catching Hold of his royal robes, I said, âNot so, Oh! honored father, he is mine; I snatched Him from the hungry jaws of death, and foiled The greedy crocodile of his prey; he has Eaten bread within thy palace walls, and thy Salt lies upon his fresh young lips; he has A claim upon thy mercy.â âCharmian,â he said âI have decreed that every man child of that Hated race shall die. The oracles have said The pyramids shall wane before their shadow. And from them a star shall rise whose light shall Spread over earth a baleful glow; and this is why I root them from the land; their strength is weakness To my throne. I shut them from the light lest they Bring darkness to my kingdom. Now, Charmian, Give me up the child, and let him die.â Then clasping the child closer to my heart, I said, âThe pathway to his life is through my own; Around that life I throw my heart, a wall Of living, loving clay.â Dark as the thunder Clouds of distant lands became my father's brow, And his eyes flashed with the fierce lightnings Of his wrath; but while I plead, with eager Eyes upturned, I saw a sudden change come Over him; his eyes beamed with unwonted Tenderness, and he said, âCharmian, arise, Thy prayer is granted; just then thy dead mother Came to thine eyes, and the light of Asenath Broke over thy face. Asenath was the light Of my home; the star that faded out too Suddenly from my dwelling, and left my life To darkness, grief and pain, and for her sake, Not thine, I'll spare the child.â And thus I saved Thee twiceâonce from the angry sword and once From the devouring flood. Moses, thou art Doubly mine; as such I claimed thee then, as such I claim thee now. I've nursed no other child Upon my knee, and pressed upon no other Lips the sweetest kisses of my love, and now, With rash and careless hand, thou dost thrust aside that love. There was a painful silence, a silence So hushed and still that you might have almost Heard the hurried breathing of one and the quick Throbbing of the other's heart: for Moses, He was slow of speech, but she was eloquent With words of tenderness and love, and had breathed Her full heart into her lips; but there was Firmness in the young man's choice, and he beat back The opposition of her lips with the calm Grandeur of his will, and again he essayed to speak. Moses Gracious lady, thou remembrest well The Hebrew nurse to whom thou gavest thy foundling. That woman was my mother; from her lips I Learned the grand traditions of our race that float With all their weird and solemn beauty, around Our wrecked and blighted fortunes. How oft! With kindling eye and glowing cheek, forgetful Of the present pain, she would lead us through The distant past: the past, hallowed by deeds Of holy faith and lofty sacrifice. How she would tell us of Abraham, The father of our race, that he dwelt in Ur; Of the Chaldees, and when the Chaldean king Had called him to his sacrifice, that he Had turned from his dumb idols to the living God, and wandered out from kindred, home and race, Led by his faith in God alone; and she would Tell us,â(we were three,) my brother Aaron, The Hebrew girl thou sentest to call a nurse, And I, her last, her loved and precious child; She would tell us that one day our father Abraham heard a voice, bidding him offer Up in sacrifice the only son of his Beautiful and beloved Sarah; that the father's Heart shrank not before the bitter test of faith, But he resolved to give his son to God As a burnt offering upon Moriah's mount; That the uplifted knife glittered in the morning Sun, when, sweeter than the music of a thousand Harps, he heard a voice bidding him to stay his hand, And spare the child; and how his faith, like gold Tried in the fiercest fire, shone brighter through Its fearful test. And then she would tell us Of a promise, handed down from sire to son, That God, the God our fathers loved and worshiped, Would break our chains, and bring to us a great Deliverance; that we should dwell in peace Beneath our vines and palms, our flocks and herds Increase, and joyful children crowd our streets; And then she would lift her eyes unto the far Off hills and tell us of the patriarchs Of our line, who sleep in distant graves within That promised land; and now I feel the hour Draws near which brings deliverance to our race. Princess These are but the dreams of thy young fancy; I cannot comprehend thy choice. I have heard Of men who have waded through slaughter To a throne; of proud ambitions, struggles Fierce and wild for some imagined good; of men Who have even cut in twain the crimson threads That lay between them and a throne; but I Never heard of men resigning ease for toil, The splendor of a palace for the squalor Of a hut, and casting down a diadem To wear a servile badge. Sadly she gazed Upon the fair young face lit with its lofty Faith and high resolvesâthe dark prophetic eyes Which seemed to look beyond the present pain Unto the future greatness of his race. As she stood before him in the warm Loveliness of her ripened womanhood, Her languid eyes glowed with unwonted fire, And the bright tropical blood sent its quick Flushes o'er the olive of her cheek, on which Still lay the lingering roses of her girlhood. Grief, wonder, and surprise flickered like shadows O'er her face as she stood slowly crushing With unconscious hand the golden tassels Of her crimson robe. She had known life only By its brightness, and could not comprehend The grandeur of the young man's choice; but she Felt her admiration glow before the earnest Faith that tore their lives apart and led him To another destiny. She had hoped to see The crown of Egypt on his brow, the sacred Leopard skin adorn his shoulders, and his seat The throne of the proud Pharaoh's; but now her Dream had faded out and left a bitter pang Of anguish in its stead. And thus they parted, She to brood in silence o'er her pain, and he To take his mission from the hands of God And lead his captive race to freedom. With silent lips but aching heart she bowed Her queenly head and let him pass, and he Went forth to share the fortune of his race, Esteeming that as better far than pleasures Bought by sin and gilded o'er with vice. And he had chosen well, for on his brow God poured the chrism of a holy work. And thus anointed he has stood a bright Ensample through the changing centuries of time. Chapter II It was a great change from the splendor, light And pleasure of a palace to the lowly huts Of those who sighed because of cruel bondage. As he passed Into the outer courts of that proud palace, He paused a moment just to gaze upon The scenes 'mid which his early life had passedâ The pleasant haunts amid the fairest flowers,â The fountains tossing on the air their silver sprayâ The statues breathing music soft and low To greet the first faint flushes of the morn,â The obelisks that rose in lofty grandeur From their stony bedsâthe sphynxes gaunt and grim, With unsolved riddles on their lipsâand all The bright creation's painters art and sculptors Skill had gathered in those regal halls, where mirth And dance, and revelry, and song had chased With careless feet the bright and fleeting hours. He was leaving all; but no regrets came Like a shadow o'er his mind, for he had felt The quickening of a higher life, as if his Soul had wings and he were conscious of their growth; And yet there was a tender light in those Dark eyes which looked their parting on the scenes Of beauty, where his life had been a joyous Dream enchanted with delight; but he trampled On each vain regret as on a vanquished foe, And went forth a strong man, girded with lofty Purposes and earnest faith. He journeyed on Till palaces and domes and lofty fanes, And gorgeous temples faded from his sight, And the lowly homes of Goshen came in view. There he saw the women of his race kneading Their tale of bricks; the sons of Abraham Crouching beneath their heavy burdens. He saw The increasing pallor on his sister's cheek, The deepening shadows on his mother's brow, The restless light that glowed in Aaron's eye, As if a hidden fire were smouldering In his brain; and bending o'er his mother In a tender, loving way, he said, âMother, I've come to share the fortunes of my race,â To dwell within these lowly huts,âto wear The badge of servitude and toil, and eat The bitter bread of penury and pain.â A sudden light beamed from his mother's eye, And she said, âHow's this, my son? but yesterday Two Hebrews, journeying from On to Goshen, Told us they had passed the temple of the Sun But dared not enter, only they had heard That it was a great day in On; that thou hadst Forsworn thy kindred, tribe and race; hadst bowed Thy knee to Egypt's vain and heathen worship: Hadst denied the God of Abraham, of Isaac, And of Jacob, and from henceforth wouldst Be engrafted in Pharaoh's regal line, And be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter. When thy father Amram heard the cruel news He bowed his head upon his staff and wept. But I had stronger faith than that. By faith I hid thee when the bloody hands of Pharaoh Were searching 'mid our quivering heart strings, Dooming our sons to death; by faith I wove The rushes of thine ark and laid thee 'mid The flags and lilies of the Nile, and saw The answer to that faith when Pharaoh's daughter Placed thee in my arms, and bade me nurse the child For her: and by that faith sustained, I heard As idle words the cruel news that stabbed Thy father like a sword.â âThe Hebrews did not hear aright; last week There was a great day in On, from Esoan's gate Unto the mighty sea; the princes, lords And chamberlains of Egypt were assembled; The temple of the sun was opened. Isis And Osiris were unveiled before the people. Apis and Orus were crowned with flowers; Golden censers breathed their fragrance on the air; The sacrifice was smoking on the altar; The first fruits of the Nile lay on the tables Of the sun; the music rose in lofty swells, Then sank in cadences so soft and low Till all the air grew tremulous with rapture. The priests of On were there, with sacred palms Within their hands and lotus leaves upon their Brows; Pharaoh and his daughter sat waiting In their regal chairs; all were ready to hear Me bind my soul to Egypt, and to swear Allegiance to her gods. The priests of On Drew near to lay their hands upon my head And bid me swear, âNow, by Osiris, judge Of all the dead, and Isis, mother of us All,â that henceforth I'd forswear my kindred, Tribe and race; would have no other gods Than those of Egypt; would be engrafted Into Pharaoh's royal line, and be called The son of Pharaoh's daughter. Then, mother Dear, I lived the past again. Again I sat Beside thee, my lips apart with childish Wonder, my eyes uplifted to thy Glowing face, and my young soul gathering Inspiration from thy words. Again I heard Thee tell the grand traditions of our race, The blessed hopes and glorious promises That weave their golden threads among the sombre Tissues of our lives, and shimmer still amid The gloom and shadows of our lot. Again I heard thee tell of Abraham, with his constant Faith and earnest trust in God, unto whom The promise came that in his seed should all The nations of the earth be blessed. Of Isaac Blessing with disappointed lips his first born son, From whom the birthright had departed. Of Jacob, With his warm affections and his devious ways, Flying before the wrath of Esau; how he Slumbered in the wild, and saw amid his dreams A ladder reaching to the sky, on which God's Angels did descend, and waking with a solemn Awe o'ershadowing all, his soul exclaimed, âHow Dreadful is this place. Lo! God is here, and I Knew it not.â Of Joseph, once a mighty prince Within this land, who shrank in holy horror From the soft white hand that beckoned him to sin; Whose heart, amid the pleasures, pomp and pride Of Egypt, was ever faithful to his race, And when his life was trembling on its frailest chord He turned his dying eyes to Canaan, and made His brethren swear that they would make his grave Among the patriarchs of his line, because Machpelah's cave, where Abraham bowed before The sons of Heth, and bought a place to lay His loved and cherished dead, was dearer to his Dying heart than the proudest tomb amid The princely dead of Egypt. Then, like the angels, mother dear, who met Our father Jacob on his way, thy words Came back as messengers of light to guide My steps, and I refused to be called the son Of Pharaoh's daughter. I saw the priests of On Grow pale with fear, an ashen terror creeping O'er the Princess' face, while Pharaoh's brow grew Darker than the purple of his cloak. But I Endured, as seeing him who hides his face Behind the brightness of his glory. And thus I left the pomp and pride of Egypt To cast my lot upon the people of my race.â Chapter III FLIGHT INTO MIDIAN The love of Moses for his race soon found A stern expression. Pharaoh was building A pyramid; ambitious, cold and proud, He scrupled not at means to gain his ends. When he feared the growing power of Israel He stained his hands in children's blood, and held A carnival of death in Goshen; but now He wished to hand his name and memory Down unto the distant ages, and instead Of lading that memory with the precious Fragrance of the kindest deeds and words, he Essayed to write it out in stone, as cold And hard, and heartless as himself. And Israel was The fated race to whom the cruel tasks Were given. Day after day a cry of wrong And anguish, some dark deed of woe and crime, Came to the ear of Moses, and he said, âThese reports are ever harrowing my soul; I will go unto the fields where Pharaoh's Officers exact their labors, and see If these things be soâif they smite the feeble At their tasks, and goad the aged on to toils Beyond their strengthâif neither age nor sex Is spared the cruel smiting of their rods.â And Moses went to see his brethren. 'Twas eventide, And the laborers were wending their way Unto their lowly huts. 'Twas a said sight,â The young girls walked without the bounding steps Of youth, with faces prematurely old, As if the rosy hopes and sunny promises Of life had never flushed their cheeks with girlish Joy; and there were men whose faces seemed to say We bear our lot in hopeless pain, we've bent unto Our burdens until our shoulders fit them, And as slaves we crouch beneath our servitude And toil. But there were men whose souls were cast In firmer moulds, men with dark secretive eyes, Which seemed to say, to-day we bide our time, And hide our wrath in every nerve, and only Wait a fitting hour to strike the hands that press Us down. Then came the officers of Pharaoh; They trod as lords, their faces flushed with pride And insolence, watching the laborers Sadly wending their way from toil to rest. And Moses' heart swelled with a mighty pain; sadly Musing, he sought a path that led him From the busy haunts of men. But even there The cruel wrong trod in his footsteps; he heard A heavy groan, then harsh and bitter words, And, looking back, he saw an officer Of Pharaoh smiting with rough and cruel hand An aged man. Then Moses' wrath o'erflowed His lips, and every nerve did tremble With a sense of wrong, and bounding forth he Cried unto the smiter, âStay thy hand; seest thou That aged man? His head is whiter than our Desert sands; his limbs refuse to do thy Bidding because the cruel tasks have drained Away their strength.â The Egyptian raised his eyes With sudden wonder; who was this that dared dispute His power? Only a Hebrew youth. His Proud lip curved in scornful anger, and he Waved a menace with his hand, saying, âBack To the task base slave, nor dare resist the will Of Pharaoh.â Then Moses' wrath o'erleaped the bounds Of prudence, and with a heavy blow he felled The smiter to the earth, and Israel had One tyrant less. Moses saw the mortal paleness Chase the flushes from the Egyptian's face, The whitening lips that breathed no more defiance And the relaxing tension of the well knit limbs. And when he knew that he was dead, he hid Him in the sand and left him to his rest. Another day Moses walked Abroad, and saw two brethren striving For mastery; and then his heart grew full Of tender pity. They were brethren, sharers Of a common wrong; should not their wrongs more Closely bind their hearts, and union, not division, Be their strength? And feeling thus, he said, âYe Are brethren, wherefore do ye strive together?â But they threw back his words in angry tones And asked if he had come to judge them, and would Mete to them the fate of the Egyptians? Then Moses knew the sand had failed to keep His secret, that his life no more was safe In Goshen, and he fled unto the deserts Of Arabia and became a shepherd For the priest of Midian. Chapter IV Men grow strong in action, but in solitude Their thoughts are ripened. Like one who cuts away The bridge on which he has walked in safety To the other side, so Moses cut off all retreat To Pharaoh's throne, and did choose the calling Most hateful to an Egyptian; he became A shepherd, and led his flocks and herds amid The solitude and wilds of Midian, where he Nursed in silent loneliness his earnest faith In God and a constant love for kindred, tribe And race. Years stole o'er him, but they took No atom from his strength, nor laid one heavy weight Upon his shoulders. The down upon his face Had ripened to a heavy beard; the fire That glowed within his youthful eye had deepened To a calm and steady light, and yet his heart Was just as faithful to his race as when he had Stood in Pharaoh's courts and bade farewell Unto his daughter. There was a look of patient waiting on his face, A calm, grand patience, like one who had lifted Up his eyes to God and seen, with meekened face, The wings of some great destiny o'ershadowing All his life with strange and solemn glory. But the hour came when he must pass from thought To action.âwhen the hope of many years Must reach its grand fruition, and Israel's Great deliverance dawn. It happened thus: One day, as Moses led his flocks, he saw A fertile spot skirted by desert sands,â A pleasant place for flocks and herds to nip The tender grass and rest within its shady nooks; And as he paused and turned, he saw a bush with fire Aglow; from root to stem a lambent flame Sent up its jest and sprays of purest light, And yet the bush, with leaves uncrisped, uncurled, Was just as green and fresh as if the breath Of early spring were kissing every leaf. Then Moses said, âI'll turn aside to see This sight,â and as he turned he heard a voice Bidding him lay his sandals by, for Lo! he Stood on holy ground. Then Moses bowed his head Upon his staff and spread his mantle o'er His face, lest he should see the dreadful majesty Of God; and there, upon that lonely spot, By Horeb's mount, his shrinking hands received The burden of his God, which bade him go To Egypt's guilty king, and bid him let The oppressed go free. Commissioned thus He gathered up his flocks and herds and sought The tents of Jethro, and said âI pray thee Let me go and see if yet my kindred live;â And Jethro bade him go in peace, nor sought To throw himself across the purpose of his soul. Yet there was tender parting in that home; There were moistened eyes, and quivering lips, And lingering claspings of the parting hand, as Jethro And his daughters stood within the light of that Clear morn, and gave to Moses and his wife And sons their holy wishes and their sad farewells. For he had been a son and brother in that home Since first with manly courtesy he had filled The empty pails of Reuel's daughters, and found A shelter 'neath his tent when flying from The wrath of Pharaoh. They journeyed on, Moses, Zipporah and sons, she looking back With tender love upon the home she had left, With all its precious memories crowding round Her heart, and he with eager eyes tracking His path across the desert, longing once more To see the long-lost faces of his distant home, The loving eyes so wont to sun him with their Welcome, and the aged hands that laid upon His youthful head their parting blessing. They Journeyed on till morning's flush and noonday Splendor gilded into the softened, mellowed Light of eve, and the purple mists were deep'ning On the cliffs and hills, when Horeb, dual Crowned, arose before him; and there he met His brother Aaron, sent by God to be His spokesman and to bear him company To Pharaoh. Tender and joyous was their greeting. They talked of home and friends until the lighter Rapple of their thoughts in deeper channels flowed; And then they talked of Israel's bondage, And the great deliverance about to dawn Upon the fortunes of their race; and Moses Told him of the burning bush, and how the message Of his God was trembling on his lips. And thus They talked until the risen moon had veiled The mount in soft and silvery light; and then They rested until morn, and rising up, refreshed From sleep, pursued their way until they reached The land of Goshen, and gathered up the elders Of their race, and told them of the message Of their Father's God. Then eager lips caught up The words of hope and passed the joyful news Around, and all the people bowed their heads And lifted up their hearts in thankfulness To God. That same day Moses sought an audience with the king. He found Him on his throne surrounded by the princes Of his court, who bowed in lowly homage At his feet. And Pharaoh heard with curving lip And flushing cheek the message of the Hebrew's God Then asked in cold and scornful tones, âHas Israel a God, and if so where has he dwelt For ages? As the highest priest of Egypt I have prayed to Isis, and the Nile has Overflowed her banks and filled the land With plenty, but these poor slaves have cried unto Their God, they crept in want and sorrow To their graves. Surely, Mizraim's God is strong And Israel's is weak; then wherefore should I heed his voice, or at this bidding break A single yoke?â Thus reasoned that proud king, And turned a deafened ear unto the words Of Moses and his brother, and yet he felt Strangely awed before their presence, because They stood as men who felt the grandeur Of their mission, and thought not of themselves But of their message. Chapter V On the next day Pharaoh called a council Of his mighty men, and before them laid The message of the brethren: then Amorphel, Keeper of the palace and nearest lord Unto the king, arose, and bending low Before the throne, prayed leave to speak a word. Amorphel was a crafty, treacherous man, With oily lips well versed in flattery And curtly speech, a supple reed ready To bend before his royal master's lightest BreathâPharaoh's willing tool. He said âGracious king, thou has been too lenient With these slaves; light as their burdens are, they Fret and chafe beneath them. They are idle And the blood runs riot in their veins. Now If thou would'st have those people dwell in peace, Increase, I pray thee, their tasks and add unto Their burdens; if they faint beneath their added Tasks, they will have less time to plot sedition And revolt.â Then Rhadma, oldest lord in Pharaoh's court, Arose. He was an aged man, whose white And heavy beard hung low upon his breast, Yet there was a hard cold glitter in his eye, And on his face a proud and evil look. He had been a servant to the former king, And wore his signet ring upon his hand. He said, âI know this Moses well. Fourscore Years ago Princess Charmian found him By the Nile and rescued him from death, and did Choose him as her son, and had him versed in all The mysteries and lore of Egypt. But blood Will tell, and this base slave, with servile blood Within his veins, would rather be a servant Than a prince, and so, with rude and reckless hand, He thrust aside the honors of our dear Departed king. Pharaoh was justly wroth, But for his daughter's sake he let the trespass Pass. But one day this Moses slew an Egyptian In his wrath, and then the king did seek his life; But he fled, it is said, unto the deserts Of Arabia, and became a shepherd for the priest Of Midian. But now, instead of leading flocks And herds, he aspires to lead his captive race To freedom. These men mean mischief; sedition And revolt are in their plans. Decree, I pray thee, That these men shall gather their own straw And yet their tale of bricks shall be the same.â And these words pleased Pharaoh well, and all his Lords chimed in with one accord. And Pharaoh Wrote the stern decree and sent it unto Goshenâ That the laborers should gather their own straw, And yet they should not 'minish of their tale of bricks. 'Twas a sad day in Goshen; The king's decree hung like a gloomy pall Around their homes. The people fainted 'neath Their added tasks, then cried unto the king, That he would ease their burdens; but he hissed A taunt into their ears and said, âYe are Idle, and your minds are filled with vain And foolish thoughts; get you unto your tasks, And ye shall not 'minish of your tale of bricks.â And they turned their eyes Reproachfully to Moses and his brother, And laid the cruel blame upon their shoulders. 'Tis an old story now, but then 'twas new Unto the brethren,âhow God's anointed ones Must walk with bleeding feet the paths that turn To lines of living light; how hands that bring Salvation in their palms are pierced with cruel Nails, and lips that quiver first with some great truth Are steeped in bitterness and tears, and brows Now bright beneath the aureola of God, Have bent beneath the thorny crowns of earth. There was no hope for Israel, But they did not see the golden fringes Of their coming morn; they only saw the cold, Grey sky, and fainted 'neath the cheerless gloom. Moses sought again the presence of the king: And Pharaoh's brow grew dark with wrath, And rising up in angry haste, he said Defiantly, âIf thy God be great, show Us some sign or token of his power.â Then Moses threw his rod upon the floor, And it trembled with a sign of life; The dark wood glowed, then changed into a thing Of glistening scales and golden rings, and green And brown and purple stripes; a hissing, hateful Thing, that glared its fiery eye, and darting forth From Moses' side, lay coiled and panting At the monarch's feet. With wonder open-eyed The king gazed on the changed rod, then called For his magiciansâwily men, well versed In sinful loreâand bade them do the same. And they, leagued with the powers of night, did Also change their rods to serpents; then Moses' Serpent darted forth, and with a startling hiss And angry gulp, he swallowed the living things That coiled along his path. And thus did Moses Show that Israel's God had greater power Than those dark sons of night. But not by this alone Did God his mighty power reveal: He changed Their waters; every fountain, well and pool Was red with blood, and lips, all parched with thirst, Shrank back in horror from the crimson draughts. And then the worshiped Nile grew full of life: Millions of frogs swarmed from the streamâthey clogged The pathway of the priests and filled the sacred Fanes, and crowded into Pharaoh's bed, and hopped Into his trays of bread, and slumbered in his Ovens and his pans. There came another plague, of loathsome vermin; They were gray and creeping things, that made Their very clothes alive with dark and sombre Spotsâthings of loathsome in the land, they did Suspend the service of the temple; for no priest Dared to lift his hand to any god with one Of those upon him. And then the sky grew Dark, as if a cloud were passing o'er its Changeless blue; a buzzing sound broke o'er The city, and the land was swarmed with flies. The Murrain laid their cattle low; the hail Cut off the first fruits of the Nile; the locusts With their hungry jaws, destroyed the later crops, And left the ground as brown and bare as if a fire Had scorched it through. Then angry blains And fiery boils did blur the flesh of man And beast; and then for three long days, nor saffron Tint, nor crimson flush, nor soft and silvery light Divided day from morn, nor told the passage Of the hours; men rose not from their seats, but sat In silent awe. That lengthened night lay like a burden On the air,âa darkness one might almost gather In his hand, it was so gross and thick. Then came The last dread plagueâthe death of the first born 'Twas midnight, And a startling shriek rose from each palace, Home and hut of Egypt, save the blood-besprinkled homes Of Goshen; the midnight seemed to shiver with a sense Of dread, as if the mystic angel's wing Had chilled the very air with horror. Death! Death! was everywhereâin every home A corpseâin every heart a bitter woe. There were anxious fingerings for the pulse That ne'er would throb again, and eager listenings For some sound of lifeâa hurrying to and froâ Then burning kisses on the cold lips Of the dead, bitter partings, sad farewells, And mournful sobs and piercing shrieks, And deep and heavy groans throughout the length And breadth of Egypt. 'Twas the last dread plague, But it had snapped in twain the chains on which The rust of ages lay, and Israel was freed; Not only freed, but thrust in eager haste From the land. Trembling men stood by, and longed To see them gather up their flocks and herds, And household goods, and leave the land; because they felt That death stood at their doors as long as Israel Lingered there; and they went forth in haste, To tread the paths of freedom. Chapter VI But Pharaoh was strangely blind, and turning From his first-born and his dead, with Egypt's wail Scarce still upon his ear, he asked which way had Israel gone? They told him that they journeyed Towards the mighty sea, and were encamped Near Baalzephen. Then Pharaoh said, âthe wilderness will hem them in, The mighty sea will roll its barriers in front, And with my chariots and my warlike men I'll bring them back, or mete them out their graves.â Then Pharaoh's officers arose And gathered up the armies of the king And made his chariots ready for pursuit With proud escutcheons blazoned to the sun, In his chariot of ivory, pearl and gold, Pharaoh rolled out of Egypt; and with him Rode his mighty men, their banners floating On the breeze, their spears and armor glittering In the morning light; and Israel saw, With fainting hearts, their old oppressors on their Track: then women wept in hopeless terror; Children hid their faces in their mothers' robes, And strong men bowed their head in agony and dread; And then a bitter, angry murmur rose,â âWere there no graves in Egypt, that thou hast Brought us here to die?â Then Moses lifted up his face, aglow With earnest faith in God, and bade their fainting hearts Be strong and they should his salvation see. âStand still,â said Moses to the fearful throng Whose hearts were fainting in the wild, âStand still.â Ah, that was Moses' word, but higher and greater Came God's watchword for the hour, and not for that Alone, but all the coming hours of time âSpeak ye unto the people and bid them Forward go; stretch thy hand across the waters And smite them with thy rod.â And Moses smote The restless sea; the waves stood up in heaps, Then lay as calm and still as lips that Had tasted death. The secret-loving sea Laid bare her coral caves and iris-tinted Floor; that wall of flood which lined the people's Way was God's own wondrous masonry; The signal pillar sent to guide them through the wild Moved its dark shadow till it fronted Egypt's Camp, but hung in fiery splendor, a light To Israel's path. Madly rushed the hosts Of Pharaoh upon the people's track, when The solemn truth broke on themâthat God For Israel fought. With cheeks in terror Blenching, and eyes astart with fear, âLet Us flee,â they cried, âfrom Israel, for their God Doth fight against us; he is battling on their side.â They had trusted in their chariots, but now That hope was vain; God had loosened every Axle and unfastened every wheel, and each Face did gather blackness and each heart stood still With fear, as the livid lightnings glittered And the thunder roared and muttered on the air, And they saw the dreadful ruin that shuddered O'er their heads, for the waves began to tremble And the wall of flood to bend. Then arose A cry of terror, baffled hate and hopeless dread, A gurgling sound of horror, as âthe waves Came madly dashing, wildly crashing, seeking Out their place again,â and the flower and pride Of Egypt sank as lead within the sea Till the waves threw back their corpses cold and stark Upon the shore, and the song of Israel's Triumph was the requiem of their foes. Oh the grandeur of that triumph; up the cliffs And down the valleys, o'er the dark and restless Sea, rose the people's shout of triumph, going Up in praise to God, and the very air Seemed joyous for the choral song of millions Throbbed upon its viewless wings. Then another song of triumph rose in accents Soft and clear; 'twas the voice of Moses' sister Rising in the tide of song. The warm blood Of her childhood seemed dancing in her veins; The roses of her girlhood were flushing On her cheek, and her eyes flashed out the splendor Of long departed days, for time itself seemed Pausing, and she lived the past again; again The Nile flowed by her; she was watching by the stream, A little ark of rushes where her baby brother lay; The tender tide of rapture swept o'er her soul again She had felt when Pharaoh's daughter had claimed Him as her own, and her mother wept for joy Above her rescued son. Then again she saw His choosing âtwixt Israel's pain and sorrow And Egypt's pomp and pride.â But now he stood Their leader triumphant on that shore, and loud She struck the cymbals as she led the Hebrew women In music, dance and song, as they shouted out Triumphs in sweet and glad refrains. MIRIAM'S SONG A wail in the palace, a wail in the hut, The midnight is shivering with dread, And Egypt wakes up with a shriek and a sob To mourn for her first-born and dead. In the morning glad voices greeted the light, As the Nile with splendor was flushed; At midnight silence had melted their tones, And their music forever is hushed. In the morning the princes of palace and court To the heir of the kingdom bowed down; 'Tis midnight, pallid and stark in his shroud He dreams not of kingdom or crown. As a monument blasted and blighted by God, Through the ages proud Pharaoh shall stand, All seamed with the vengeance and scarred with the wrath That leaped from God's terrible hand. Chapter VII They journeyed on from Zuphim's sea until They reached the sacred mount and heard the solemn Decalogue. The mount was robed in blackness,â Heavy and deep the shadows lay; the thunder Crashed and roared upon the air: the lightning Leaped from crag to crag; God's fearful splendor Flowed around, and Sinai quaked and shuddered To its base, and there did God proclaim Unto their listening ears, the great, the grand, The central and primal truth of all The universeâthe unity of God. Only one God.â This truth received into the world's great life, Not as an idle dreamer's speculative thing, But as a living, vitalizing thought, Should bind us closer to our God and link us With our fellow man, the brothers and co-heirs With Christ, the elder brother of our race. Before this truth let every blade of war Grow dull, and slavery, cowering at the light, Skulk from the homes of men; instead Of war bring peace and freedom, love and joy, And light for man, instead of bondage, whips And chains. Only one God! the strongest hands Should help the weak who bend before the blasts Of life, because if God is only one Then we are the children of his mighty hand, And when we best serve man, we also serve Our God. Let haughty rulers learn that men Of humblest birth and lowliest lot have Rights as sacred and divine as theirs, and they Who fence in leagues of earth by bonds and claims And title deeds, forgetting land and water, Air and light are God's own gifts and heritage For manâwho throw their selfish lives between God's sunshine and the shivering poorâ Have never learned the wondrous depth, nor scaled The glorious height of this great central truth, Around which clusters all the holiest faiths Of earth. The thunder died upon the air, The lightning ceased its livid play, the smoke And darkness died away in clouds, as soft And fair as summer wreaths that lie around The setting sun, and Sinai stood a bare And ragged thing among the sacred scenes Of earth. Chapter VIII It was a weary thing to bear the burden Of that restless and rebellious race. With Sinai's thunders almost crashing in their ears, They made a golden calf, and in the desert Spread an idol's feast, and sung the merry songs They had heard when Mizraim's songs bowed down before Their vain and heathen gods; and thus for many years Did Moses bear the evil manners of his raceâ Their angry murmurs, fierce regrets and strange Forgetfulness of God. Born slaves, they did not love The freedom of the wild more than their pots of flesh. And pleasant savory things once gathered From the gardens of the Nile. If Slavery only laid its weight of chains Upon the weary, aching limbs, e'en then It were a curse; but when it frets through nerve And flesh and eats into the weary soul, Oh then it is a thing for every human Heart to loathe, and this was Israel's fate, For when the chains were shaken from their limbs, They failed to strike the impress from their souls. While he who'd basked beneath the radiance Of a throne, ne'er turned regretful eyes upon The past, nor sighed to grasp again the pleasures Once resigned; but the saddest trial was To see the light and joy fade from their faces When the faithless spies spread through their camp Their ill report; and when the people wept In hopeless unbelief and turned their faces Egyptward, and asked a captain from their bands To lead them back where they might bind anew Their broken chains, when God arose and shut The gates of promise on their lives, and left Their bones to bleach beneath Arabia's desert sands But though they slumbered in the wild, they died With broader freedom on their lips, and for their Little ones did God reserve the heritage So rudely thrust aside. Chapter IX THE DEATH OF MOSES His work was done; his blessing lay Like precious ointment on his people's head, And God's great peace was resting on his soul. His life had been a lengthened sacrifice, A thing of deep devotion to his race, Since first he turned his eyes on Egypt's gild And glow, and clasped their fortunes in his hand And held them with a firm and constant grasp. But now his work was done; his charge was laid In Joshua's hand, and men of younger blood Were destined to possess the land and pass Through Jordan to the other side. He too Had hoped to enter thereâto tread the soil Made sacred by the memories of his Kindred dead, and rest till life's calm close beneath The sheltering vines and stately palms of that Fair land; that hope had colored all his life's Young dreams and sent its mellowed flushes o'er His later years; but God's decree was otherwise. And so he bowed his meekened soul in calm Submission to the word, which bade him climb To Nebo's highest peak and view the pleasant land From Jordan's swells unto the calmer ripples Of the tideless sea, then die with all its Loveliness in sight. As he passed from Moab's grassy vale to climb The rugged mount, the people stood in mournful groups, Some, with quivering lips and tearful eyes, Reaching out unconscious hands, as if to stay His steps and keep him ever at their side, while Others gazed with reverent awe upon The calm and solemn beauty on his aged brow. The look of loving trust and lofty faith Still beaming from an eye that neither care Nor time had dimmed. As he passed upward, tender Blessings, earnest prayers and sad farewells rose On each wave of air, then died in one sweet Murmur of regretful love; and Moses stood Alone on Nebo's mount. Alone! not one Of all that mighty throng who had trod with him In triumph through the parted flood was there. Aaron had died in Hor, with son and brother By his side; and Miriam too was gone. But kindred hands had made her grave, and Kadesh Held her dust. But he was all alone; nor wife Nor child was there to clasp in death his hand, And bind around their bleeding hearts the precious Parting words. And he was not all alone, For God's great presence flowed around his path And stayed him in that solemn hour. He stood upon the highest peak of Nebo, And saw the Jordan chafing through its gorges, Its banks made bright by scarlet blooms And purple blossoms. The placid lakes And emerald meadows, the snowy crest Of distant mountains, the ancient rocks That dripped with honey, the hills all bathed In light and beauty; the shady groves And peaceful vistas, the vines opprest With purple riches, the fig trees fruit-crowned Green and golden, the pomegranates with crimson Blushes, the olives with their darker clusters, Rose before him like a vision, full of beauty And delight. Gazed he on the lovely landscape Till it faded from his view, and the wing Of death's sweet angel hovered o'er the mountain's Crest, and he heard his garments rustle through The watches of the night. Then another, fairer, vision Broke upon his longing gaze; 'twas the land Of crystal fountains, love and beauty, joy And light, for the pearly gates flew open, And his ransomed soul went in. And when morning O'er the mountain fringed each crag and peak with light, Cold and lifeless lay the leader. God had touched His eyes with slumber, giving his beloved sleep. Oh never on that mountain Was seen a lovelier sight Than the troupe of fair young angels That gathered 'round the dead. With gentle hands they bore him That bright and shining train, From Nebo's lonely mountain To sleep in Moab's vale. But they sang no mournful dirges, No solemn requiems said, And the soft wave of their pinions Made music as they trod. But no one heard them passing, None saw their chosen grave; It was the angels secret Where Moses should be laid. And when the grave was finished, They trod with golden sandals Above the sacred spot, And the brightest, fairest flower Sprang up beneath their tread. Nor broken turf, nor hillock Did e'er reveal that grave, And truthful lips have never said We know where he is laid. THE RAGGED STOCKING Do you see this ragged stocking, Here a rent and there a hole? Each thread of this little stocking Is woven around my soul. Do you wish to hear my story? Excuse me, the tears will start, For the sight of this ragged stocking Stirs the fountains of my heart. You say that my home is happy; To me 'tis earth's fairest place, But its sunshine, peace and gladness Back to this stocking I trace. I was once a wretched drunkard; Ah! you start and say not so; But the dreadful depths I've sounded, And I speak of what I know. I was wild and very reckless When I stood on manhood's brink, And joining with pleasure-seekers Learned to revel and drink. Strong drink is a raging demon, In his hands are shame and woe, He mocketh the strength of the mighty And bringeth the strong man low. The light of my home was darkened By the shadow of my sin; And want and woe unbarr'd the door, And suffering entered in. The streets were full one Christmas eve, And alive with girls and boys, Merrily looking through window-panes At bright and beautiful toys. And throngs of parents came to buy The gifts that children prize, And homeward trudged with happy hearts, The love-light in their eyes. I thought of my little Charley At home in his lowly bed, With the shadows around his life, And in shame I bowed my head. I entered my home a sober man, My heart by remorse was wrung, And there in the chimney corner, This little stocking was hung. Faded and worn as you see it; To me 'tis a precious thing, And I never gaze upon it But unbidden tears will spring. I began to search my pockets, But scarcely a dime was there; But scanty as was the pittance, This stocking received its share. For a longing seized upon me To gladden the heart of my boy, And I brought him some cakes and candy, And added a simple toy. Then I knelt by this little stocking And sobbed out an earnest prayer, And arose with strength to wrestle And break from the tempter's snare. And this faded, worn-out stocking, So pitiful once to see, Became the wedge that broke my chain, And a blessing brought to me. Do you marvel then I prize it? When each darn and seam and hole Is linked with my soul's deliverance From the bondage of the bowl? And to-night my wife will tell you, Though I've houses, gold and land, He holds no treasure more precious Than this stocking in my hand. THE FATAL PLEDGE âPledge me with wine,â the maiden cried, Her tones were gay and light; âFrom others you have turned aside, I claim your pledge to-night.â The blood rushed to the young man's cheek, Then left it deadly pale; Beneath the witchery of her smile He felt his courage fail. For many years he'd been a slave To the enchanting bowl, Until he grasped with eager hands The reins of self-control; And struggled with his hated thrall, Until he rent his chain, And strove to stand erect and free, And be a man again. When others came with tempting words He coldly turned aside, But she who held the sparkling cup Was his affianced bride; And like a vision of delight, Bright, beautiful and fair, With thoughtless words she wove for him The meshes of despair. With jeweled hands he took the cup, Nor heard the serpent's hiss; Nor saw beneath the ruby glow The deadly adder's hiss. Like waves that madly, wildly dash, When dykes are overthrown, The barriers of his soul gave way, Each life with wrecks was strewn. And she who might have reached her hand To succor and to save, Soon wept in hopeless agony Above a drunkard's grave. And bore through life a bleeding heart Remembrance of that night, When she had urged the tempted man With wine to make his plight. CHRIST'S ENTRY INTO JERUSALEM He had plunged into our sorrows, And our sin had pierced his heart, As before him loomed death's shadow, And he knew he must depart. But they hailed him as a victor As he into Salem came, And the very children shouted Loud hosannas to his name. But he knew behind that triumph, Rising gladly to the sky, Soon would come the cries of malice: Crucify him! Crucify! Onward rode the blessed Saviour, Conscious of the coming strife Soon to break in storms of hatred Round his dear, devoted life. Ghastly in its fearful anguish Rose the cross before his eyes, But he saw the joy beyond it, And did all the shame despise. Joy to see the cry of scorning Through the ages ever bright, In the cross of shame transfigured To a throne of love and light. Joy to know his soul's deep travail Should not be a thing in vain, And that joy and peace should blossom From his agonizing pain. THE RESURRECTION OF JESUS It was done, the deed of horror; Christ had died upon the cross, And within an upper chamber The disciples mourned their loss. Peter's eyes were full of anguish, Thinking sadly of the trial When his boasted self-reliance Ended in his Lord's denial. Disappointment, deep and heavy, Shrouded every heart with gloom, As the hopes so fondly cherished Died around the garden tomb. And they thought with shame and sorrow How they fled in that dark hour, When they saw their Lord and Master In the clutch of Roman power. We had hoped, they sadly uttered, He would over Israel reign, But to-day he lies sepulchred, And our cherished hopes are vain. In the humble home of Mary Slowly waned the hours away, Till she rose to seek the garden And the place where Jesus lay. Not the cross with all its anguish Could her loving heart restrain, But the tomb she sought was empty, And her heart o'erflowed with pain. To embalm my Lord and Master To this garden I have strayed, But, behold, I miss his body, And I know not where he's laid. Then a wave of strange emotion Swept her soul, as angels said, âWherefore do ye seek the living 'Mid the chambers of the dead?â Unperceived, her Lord stood by her, Silent witness of her grief, Bearing on his lips the tidings Sure to bring a glad relief. But her tear-dimmed eyes were holden Then she heard the Master speak; Thought she, only 'tis the gardener Asking whom her soul did seek. Then a sudden flush of gladness O'er her grief-worn features spread; When she knew the voice of Jesus All her bitter anguish fled. Forth she reached hands in rapture. âTouch me not,â the Saviour said; âTake the message to my brethren, I have risen from the dead. âTake them words of joy and comfort, Which will all their mourning end; To their father and my father, Tell them that I will ascend.â âBrethren, I have seen the Master: He is risen from the dead.â But like words of idle meaning Seemed the glorious words she said. Soon they saw the revelation Which would bid their mourning cease: Christ, the risen, stood before them Breathing words of love and peace. Timid men were changed to heroes, Weakness turned to wondrous might, And the cross became their standard, Luminous with love and light. From that lonely upper chamber, Holding up the rugged cross, With a glad and bold surrender They encountered shame and loss. In these days of doubt and error, In the conflict for the right, May our hearts be ever strengthened By the resurrection's might. SIMON'S COUNTRYMEN They took away his seamless robe, With thorns they crowned his head, As harshly, fiercely cried his foes: âBarabbas in his stead.â The friends he loved unto the end, Who shared his daily bread, Before the storms of wrath and hate Forsook their Lord and fled. To rescue men from death and sin He knew the awful cost, As wearily he bent beneath The burden of the cross. When Pilate had declared his fate, And Jews withheld their aid, Then Simon, the Cyrenean, came: On him the cross was laid. Not his to smite with cruel scorn, Nor mock the dying one, That helpful man came from the land Missed by the ardent sunâ The land within whose sheltering arms The infant Jesus lay When Herod vainly bared his sword And sought the child to slay. Amid the calendar of saints We Simon's name may trace, On history's page thro' every age He bears an honored place. He little knew that cross would change Unto a throne of light; The crown of thorns upon Christ's brow Would be forever bright. Beneath the shadow of that cross Brave men with outstretched hands Have told the wondrous tale of love In distant heathen lands. And yet within our favored land, Where Christian churches rise, The dark-browed sons of Africa Are hated and despised. Can they who speak of Christ as King, And glory in his name, Forget that Simon's countrymen Still bear a cross of shame? Can they forget the cruel scorn Men shower on a race Who treat the hues their father gives As emblems of disgrace? Will they erect to God their fanes And Christ with honor crown, And then with cruel weights of pain The African press down? Oh, Christians, when we faint and bleed In this our native land, Reach out to us when peeled, opprest, A kindly helping hand, And bear aloft that sacred cross, Bright from the distant years, And say for Christ's and Simon's sake, We'll wipe away your tears. For years of sorrow, toil and pain We'll bring you love and light, And in the name of Christ our Lord We'll make your pathway bright. That seamless robe shall yet enfold The children of the sun, Till rich and poor and bond and free In Christ shall all be one. And for his sake from pride and scorn Our spirits shall be free, Till through our souls shall sound the words He did it unto me. DELIVERANCE Rise up! rise up! Oh Israel, Let a spotless lamb be slain; The angel of death will o'er you bend And rend your galling chain. Sprinkle its blood upon the posts And lintels of your door; When the angel sees the crimson spots Unharmed he will pass you o'er. Gather your flocks and herds to-night, Your children by your side; A leader from Arabia comes To be your friend and your guide. With girded loins and sandled feet Await the hour of dread, When Mizraim shall wildly mourn Her first-born and her dead. The sons of Abraham no more Shall crouch 'neath Pharaoh's hand, Trembling with agony and dread. He'll thrust you from the land. And ye shall hold in unborn years A feast to mark this day, When joyfully the fathers rose And cast their chains away. When crimson tints of morning flush The golden gates of day, Or gorgeous hue of even melt In sombre shades away, Then ye shall to your children teach The meaning of this feast, How from the proud oppressor's hand Their fathers were released, And ye shall hold through distant years This feast with glad accord, And children's children yet shall learn To love and trust the Lord. Ages have passed since Israel trod In triumph through the sea, And yet they hold in memory's urn Their first great jubilee, When Moses led the ransomed hosts, And Miriam's song arose, While ruin closed around the path Of their pursuing foes. Shall Israel thro' long varied years These memories cherish yet, And we who lately stood redeemed Our broken chains forget? Should we forget the wondrous change That to our people came, When justice rose and sternly plead Our cause with sword and flame, And led us through the storms of war To freedom's fairer shore, When slavery sank beneath a flood Whose waves were human gore? Oh, youth and maidens of the land, Rise up with one accord, And in the names of Christ go forth To battle for the Lord. Go forth, but not in crimson fields, With fratricidal strife, But in the name of Christ go forth For freedom, love and life. Go forth to follow in his steps, Who came not to destroy, Till wasteds shall blossom as the rose, And deserts sing for joy. SIMON'S FEAST He is coming, she said, to Simon's feast, The prophet of Galilee, Though multitudes around him throng In longing his face to see. He enters the home as Simon's guest, But he gives no welcome kiss; He brings no water to bathe his feetâ Why is Simon so remiss? If a prophet, he will surely know The guilt of my darkened years; With broken heart I'll see his face, And bathe his feet with my tears. No holy rabbi lays his hand In blessing on my head; No loving voice floats o'er the path, The downer path I tread. Unto the Master's side she pressed, A penitent, rail and fair, Rained on his feet a flood of tears, And then wiped them with her hair. Over the face of Simon swept An air of puzzled surprise; Can my guest a holy prophet be, And not this woman despise? Christ saw the thoughts that Simon's heart Had written upon his face, Kindly turned to the sinful one In her sorrow and disgrace. Where Simon only saw the stains, Where sin and shame were rife, Christ looked beneath and saw the perms Or a fair, outflowering life. Like one who breaks a galling chain, And sets a prisoner free, He rent her fetters with the words, âThy sins are forgiven thee.â God be praised for the gracious words Which came through that woman's touch, That souls redeemed thro' God's dear Son May learn to love him so much; That souls once red with guilt and crime May their crimson stains outgrow; The scarlet spots upon their lives Become whiter than driven snow. LINES TO HON. THADDEUS STEVENS Have the bright and glowing visions Faded from thy longing sight, Like the gorgeous tints of ev'n Mingling with the shades of night? Didst thou hope to see thy country Wearing Justice as a crown, Standing foremost 'mid the nations Worthy of the world's renown? Didst thou think the grand fruition Reached the fullness of its time, When the crater of God's judgment Overflowed the nation's crime? That thy people, purged by fire, Would have trod another path, Careful, lest their feet should stumble On the cinders of God's wrath? And again the injured negro Grind the dreadful mills of fate, Pressing out the fearful vintage Of the nation's scorn and hate? Sadder than the crimson shadows Hung for years around our skies, Are the hopes so fondly cherished Fading now before thine eyes. Not in vain has been thy hoping, Though thy fair ideals fade, If, like one of God's tall aloes, Thou art rip'ning in the shade. There is light beyond the darkness, Joy beyond the present pain; There is hope in God's great justice, And the negro's rising brain. Though before the timid counsels Truth and Right may seem to fail. God hath bathed his sword in judgment, And his arm shall yet prevail. AN APPEAL TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE When a dark and fearful strife Raged around the nation's life, And the traitor plunged his steel Where your quivering hearts could feel, When your cause did need a friend, We were faithful to the end. When we stood with bated breath, Facing fiery storms of death, And the war-cloud, red with wrath, Fiercely swept around our path, Did our hearts with terror quail? Or our courage ever fail? When the captive, wanting bread, Sought our poor and lowly shed, And the blood-hounds missed his way, Did we e'er his path betray? Filled we not his heart with trust As we shared with him our crust? With your soldiers, side by side, helped we turn the battle's tide, Till o'er ocean, stream and shore, Waved the rebel flag no more, And above the rescued sod Praises rose to freedom's God. But to-day the traitor stands With crimson on his hands, Scowling 'neath his brow of hate, On our weak and desolate, With the blood-rust on the knife Aimed at the nation's life. Asking you to weakly yield All we won upon the field, To ignore, on land and flood, All the offerings of our blood, And to write above our slain âThey have fought and died in vain.â To your manhood we appeal, Lest the traitor's iron heel Grind and trample in the dust All our new-born hope and trust, And the name of freedom be Linked with bitter mockery. TRUTH A rock, for ages, stern and high, Stood frowning 'gainst the earth and sky, And never bowed his haughty crest With angry storms around him prest. Morn, springing from the arms of night, Had often bathed his brow with light, And kissed the shadows from his face With tender love and gentle grace. Day, pausing at the gates of rest, Smiled on him from the distant West, And from her throne the dark-browed Night Threw round his path her softest light. And yet he stood unmoved and proud, Nor love, nor wrath, his spirit bowed; He bared his brow to every blast And scorned the tempest as it passed. One day a tiny, humble seedâ The keenest eye would hardly heedâ Fell trembling at that stern rock's base, And found a lowly hiding-place. A ray of light, and drop of dew, Came with a message, kind and true; They told her of the world so bright, Its love, its joy, and rosy light, And lured her from her hiding-place, To gaze upon earth's glorious face. So, peeping timid from the ground, She clasped the ancient rock around, And climbing up with childish grace, She held him with a close embrace; Her clinging was a thing of dread; Wher'er she touched a fissure spread, And he who'd breasted many a storm Stood frowning there, a mangled form; A Truth, dropped in the silent earth, May seem a thing of little worth, Till, spreading round some mighty wrong, It saps its pillars proud and strong, And o'er the fallen ruin weaves The brightest blooms and fairest leaves. DEATH OF THE OLD SEA KING 'Twas a fearful nightâthe tempest raved With loud and wrathful pride The storm-king harnessed his lightning steeds And rode on the raging tide. The sea-king lay on his bed of death, Pale mourners around him bent; They knew the wild and fitful life Of their chief was almost spent. His ear was growing dull in death When the angry storm he heard, The sluggish blood in the old man's veins With sudden vigor stirred. âI hear them call,â cried the dying man, His eyes grew full of light; âNow bring me here my warrior robes, My sword and armor bright. âIn the tempest's lull I heard a voice, I knew 'twas Odin's call. The Valkyrs are gathering round my bed To lead me unto his hall. âBear me unto my noblest ship, Light up a funeral pyre; I'll walk to the palace of the braves Through a path of flame and fire.â Oh! wild and bright was the stormy light That flashed from the old man's eye, As they bore him from the couch of death To his battle-ship to die, And lit with many a mournful torch The sea-king's dying bed, And like a banner fair and bright The flames around him spread. But they heard no cry of anguish Break through that fiery wall, With rigid brow and silent lips He was seeking Odin's hall. Through a path of fearful splendor, While strong men held their breath, The brave old man went boldly forth And calmly talked with death. LET THE LIGHT ENTER! The dying words of Goethe âLight! more light! the shadows deepen, And my life is ebbing low, Throw the windows widely open; Light! more light! before I go. âSoftly let the balmy sunshine Play around my dying bed, O'er the dimly lighted valley I with lonely feet must tread. âLight! more light! for Death is weaving Shadows 'round my waning sight, And I fain would gaze upon him Through a stream of earthly light.â Not for greater gifts of genius; Not for thoughts more grandly bright. All the dying poet whispers Is a prayer for light, more light. Heeds he not the gathered laurels, Fading slowly from his sight; All the poet's aspirations Centre in that prayer for light. Gracious Saviour, when life's day-dreams Melt and vanish from the sight, May our dim and longing vision Then be blessed with light, more light. YOUTH IN HEAVEN âIn heaven, the angels are advancing continually to the spring-time of their youth, so that the oldest angel appears the youngest.â Swedenborg Not for them the length'ning shadows, Fallingly coldly 'round our lives; Nearer, nearer, through the ages, Life's new spring for them arrives. Not for them the doubt and anguish Of an old and loveless age; Dropping sadly tears of sorrow, On life's faded, blotted, page. Not for them the hopeless clinging, To life's worn and feeble strands; Till the last has ceased to tremble, In our aged, withered hands. Not for them the mournful dimming Of the weary tear-stained eye, That has seen the sad procession, Of its dearest hopes go by. Never lines of light and darkness Thread the brows forever fair; And the eldest of the angels, Seems the youngest brother there. There the streets of life doth never Cross the mournful plain of death; And the gates of light are ever Closed against its icy breath. DEATH OF ZOMBI The Chief of a Negro Kingdom in South Africa Cruel in vengeance, reckless in wrath, The hunters of men bore down on our path; Inhuman and fierce, the offer they gave Was freedom in death or the life of a slave. The cheek of the mother grew pallid with dread, As the tidings of evil around us were spread, And closer and closer she strained to her heart The children she feared they would sever apart. The brows of our maidens grew gloomy and sad; Hot tears burst from eyes once sparkling and glad. Our young men stood ready to join in the fray, That hung as a pall 'round our people that day. Our leaders gazed angry and stern on the strife, For freedom to them was dearer than life. There was mourning at home and death in the street, For carnage and famine together did meet. The pale lips of hunger were asking for bread, While husbands and fathers lay bleeding and dead. For days we withstood the tempests of wrath, That scattered destruction and death in our path, Till, broken and peeled, we yielded at last, And the glory and strength of our kingdom were past. But Zombi, our leader, and warlike old chief, Gazed down on our woe with anger and grief; The tyrant for him forged fetters in vain, His freedom-girt limbs had worn their last chain. A freeman he'd lived and free he would die. Defiance and daring still flashed from his eye; So he climbed to the verge of a dangerous steep, Resolved from its margin to take a last leap; For a fearful death and a bloody grave Were dearer to him than the life of a slave. Nor went he alone to the mystic landâ There were other warriors in his band, Who rushed with him to Death's dark gate, All wrapped in the shroud of a mournful fate. LINES TO CHARLES SUMNER Thank God that thou hast spoken Words earnest, true and brave, The lightning of thy lips did smite The fetters of the slave. I thought the shadows deepened, Round the pathway of the slave, As one by one his faithful friends Were dropping in the grave. When other hands grew feeble, And loosed their hold on life, Thy words rang like a clarion For freedom's noble strife. Thy words were not soft echoes, Thy tones no syren song; They fell as battle-axes upon our giant wrong. God grant thy words of power May fall as precious seeds, That yet shall leaf and blossom In high and holy deeds. âSIR, WE WOULD SEE JESUSâ We would see Jesus; earth is grand, Glowing out from her Creator's hand. Like one who tracks his steps with light, His footsteps ever greet our sight; The earth below, the sky above, Are full of tokens of his love; But 'mid the fairest scenes we've sighedâ Our hearts are still unsatisfied. We would see Jesus; proud and high Temples and domes have met our eye. We've gazed upon the glorious thought, By earnest hands in marble wrought, And listened where the flying feet Beat time to music, soft and sweet; But bow'rs of ease, and halls of pride, Our yearning hearts ne'er satisfied. We would see Jesus; we have heard Tidings our inmost souls have stirred, How, from their chambers full of night, The darkened eyes receive the light; How, at the music of his voice, The lame do leap, the dumb rejoice. Anxious we'll wait until we've seen The good and gracious Nazarene. THE BRIDE OF DEATH They robed her for another groom, For her bridal couch, prepared the tomb; From the sunny love of her marriage day A stronger rival had won her away; His wooing was like a stern command, And cold was the pressure of his hand. Through her veins he sent an icy thrill, With sudden fear her heart stood still; To his dusty palace the bride he led, Her guests were the pale and silent dead. No eye flashed forth a loving light, To greet the bride as she came in sight, Not one reached out a joyous hand, To welcome her home to the mystic land. Silent she sat in the death still hall, For her bridal robe she wore a pall; Instead of orange-blossoms fair, Willow and cypress wreathed her hair. Though her mother's kiss lay on her cheek, Her lips no answering love could speak, No air of life stirred in her breath, That fair young girl was the bride of death. THANK GOD FOR LITTLE CHILDREN Thank God for little children; Bright flowers by earth's wayside, The dancing, joyous lifeboats Upon life's stormy tide. Thank God for little children; When our skies are cold and gray, They come as sunshine to our hearts, And charm our cares away. I almost think the angels, Who tend life's garden fair, Drop down the sweet wild blossoms That bloom around us here. It seems a breath of heaven Round many a cradle lies, And every little baby Brings a message from the skies. Dear mothers, guard these jewels, As sacred offerings meet, A wealth of household treasures To lay at Jesus' feet. THE DYING FUGITIVE Slowly o'er his darkened features, Stole the warning shades of death; And we knew the shadowing angel Waited for his parting breath. He had started for his freedom; And his heart beat firm and highâ But before he won the guerdon, Came the messageâhe must die. He must die, when just before him, Lay the longed for, precious prizeâ And the hopes that lit him onward, Faded out before his eyes. For a while a fearful madness, Rested on his weary brain; And he thought the hateful tyrant, Had rebound his galling chain. Then he raved in bitter anguishâ âTake me where that good man dwells!â To a name to freedom precious;â Lingered mid life's shattered cells. But as sunshine gently stealing, O'er the storm-cloud's gloomy trackâ Through the tempests of his bosom, Came the light of reason back. And without a sigh or murmur For the home he'd left behind; Calmly yielded he his spirit, To the father of mankind. Thankful that so near to freedom, He with eager steps had trodâ E'er his ransomed spirit rested, On the bosom of his God. BURY ME IN A FREE LAND Make me a grave where'er you will, In a lowly plain, or a lofty hill, Make it among earth's humblest graves, But not in a land where men are slaves. I could not rest if around my grave I heard the steps of a trembling slave: His shadow above my silent tomb Would make it a place of fearful gloom. I could not rest if I heard the tread Of a coffle gang to the shambles led, And the mother's shriek of wild despair Rise like a curse on the trembling air. I could not sleep if I saw the lash Drinking her blood at each fearful gash, And I saw her babes torn from her breast, Like trembling doves from their parent nest. I'd shudder and start if I heard the bay Of blood-hounds seizing their human prey, And I heard the captive plead in vain As they bound afresh his galling chain. If I saw young girls from their mother's arms Bartered and sold for their youthful charms, My eye would flash with a mournful flame, My death-paled cheek grow red with shame. I would sleep, dear friends, where bloated might Can rob no man of his dearest right; My rest shall be calm in any grave Where none can call his brother a slave. I ask no monument, proud and high To arrest the gaze of the passers-by; All that my yearning spirit craves, Is bury me not in a land of slaves. THE FREEDOM BELL Ring, aye, ring the freedom bell, And let its tones be loud and clear; With glad hosannas let it swell Until it reach the Bondman's ear. Through pain that wrings the life apart, And spasms full of deadly strife, And throes that shake the nation's heart, The fainting land renews her life. Where shrieks and groans distract the air, And sods grow red with crimson rain, The ransom'd slave shall kneel in prayer And bury deep his rusty chain. There cheeks now pale with sickening dread, And brows grow dark with cruel wrath, Shall Freedom's banner wide be spread And Hope and Peace attend her path. White-robed and pure her feet shall move O'er rifts of ruin deep and wide; Her hands shall span with lasting love The chasms rent by hate and pride. There waters, blush'd with human gore, Unsullied streams shall purl along; Where crashed the battle's awful roar Shall rise the Freeman's joyful song. Then ring, aye, ring the freedom bell, Proclaiming all the nation free; Let earth with sweet thanksgiving swell And heaven catch up the melody. MARY AT THE FEET OF CHRIST She stood at Jesus' feet, And bathed them with her tears, While o'er her spirit surg'd The guilt and shame of years. Though Simon saw the grief Upon the fair young face, The stern man coldly thought For her this is no place. Her feet have turned aside From paths of truth and right, If Christ a prophet be He'll spurn her from his sight. And silently he watched The child of sin and care, Uncoil upon Christ's feet Her wealth of raven hair. O Life! she sadly thought, I know thy bane and blight, And yet I fain would find The path of peace and right. I've seen the leper cleansed, I've seen the sick made whole, But mine's a deeper woundâ It eats into the soul. And men have trampled down The beauty once their prize, While women pass me by With cold, averted eyes. But now a hope of peace Steals o'er my weary breast, And from these lips of love There comes a sense of rest. The tender, loving Christ Gazed on her tearful eyes, Then saw on Simon's face A look of cold surprise. âSimon,â the Saviour said, âThou wast to me remiss, I came thy guest, but thou Didst give no welcome kiss. âThou broughtest from thy fount No water cool and sweet, But she, with many tears, Hath bent and kissed my feet. âThou pouredst on my head No oil with kindly care, But she anoints my feet, And wipes them with her hair. âI know her steps have strayed, Her sins they many be, But she with love hath bound Her erring heart to me.â How sweetly fell his words Upon her bruised heart, When, like a ghastly train, She felt her sins depart. What music heard on earth, Or rapture moving heaven Were like those precious wordsâ âThy sins were all forgiven!â THE MOTHER'S BLESSING Oh, my soul had grown so weary With its many cares opprest, All my heart's high aspiration Languish'd in a prayer for rest. I was like a lonely stranger Pining in a distant land, Bearing on her lips a language None around her understand. Longing for close communion With some kindred mind and heart, But whose language is a jargon Past her skill, and past her art. God in mercy looked upon me, Saw my fainting, pain and strife, Sent to me a blest evangel, Through the gates of light and life. Then my desert leafed and blossom'd, Beauty decked its deepest wild, Hope and joy, peace and blessing, Met me in my first-born child. When the tiny hands, so feeble, Brought me smiles and joyful tears, Lifted from my life the shadows, That had gathered there for years. God, I thank thee for the blessing That at last has crown'd my life, Soothed its weary, lonely anguish, Stayed its fainting, calm'd its strife. Gracious Parent! guard and shelter In thine arms my darling child Till she treads the streets of jasper, Glorified and undefiled. VASHTI She leaned her head upon her hand And heard the the King's decreeâ âMy lords are feasting in my halls; Bid Vashti come to me. âI've shown the treasures of my house, My costly jewels rare, But with the glory of her eyes No rubies can compare. âAdorn'd and crown'd I'd have her come, With all her queenly grace, And, 'mid my lords and mighty men, Unveil her lovely face. âEach gem that sparkles in my crown, Or glitters on my throne, Grows poor and pale when she appears, My beautiful, my own!â All waiting stood the chamberlains To hear the Queen's reply. They saw her cheek grow deathly pale, But light flash'd to her eye: âGo, tell the King,â she proudly said, âThat I am Persia's Queen, And by his crowds of merry men I never will be seen. âI'll take the crown from off my head And tread it 'neath my feet, Before their rude and careless gaze My shrinking eyes shall meet. âA queen unveil'd before the crowd!â Upon each lip my name!â Why, Persia's women all would blush And weep for Vashti's shame! âGo back!â she cried, and waved her hand, And grief was in her eye: âGo, tell the King,â she sadly said, âThat I would rather die.â They brought her message to the King; Dark flash'd his angry eye; 'Twas as the lightning ere the storm Hath swept in fury by. Then bitterly outspoke the King, Through purple lips of wrathâ âWhat shall be done to her who dares To cross your monarch's path?â Then spoke his wily counsellorsâ âO King of this fair land! From distant Ind to Ethiop, All bow to thy command. âBut if, before thy servant's eyes, This thing they plainly see, That Vashti doth not heed thy will Nor yield herself to thee, âThe women, restive 'neath our rule, Would learn to scorn our name, And from her deed to us would come Reproach and burning shame. âThen, gracious King, sign with thy hand This stern but just decree, That Vashti lay aside her crown, Thy Queen no more to be.â She heard again the King's command, And left her high estate; Strong in her earnest womanhood, She calmly met her fate. And left the palace of the King, Proud of her spotless nameâ A woman who could bend to grief, But would not bow to shame. THE CHANGE The blue sky arching overhead, The green turf 'neath my daily tread, All glorified by freedom's light, Grow fair and lovely to my sight. The very winds that sweep along Seemed burdened with a lovely song, Nor shrieks nor groans of grief or fear, Float on their wings and pain my ear. No more with dull and aching breast, Roused by the hornâI rise from rest. Content and cheerful with my lot, I greet the sun and leave my cot. For darling child and loving wife I toil with newly waken'd life; The light that lingers round her smile The shadows from my soul beguile. The prattle of my darling boy Fills my old heart with untold joy; Before his laughter, mirth and song Fade out long scores of grief and wrong. Oh, never did the world appear So lovely to my eye and ear, 'Till Freedom came, with Joy and Peace, And bade my hateful bondage cease! THE DYING MOTHER Come nearer to me, husband Now the aching leaves my breast, But my eyes are dim and weary, And to-night I fain would rest. Clasp me closer to your bosom Ere I calmly sleep in death; With your arms enfolded round me I would yield my parting breath. Bring me now my darling baby, God's own precious gift of love, Tell her she must meet her mother In the brighter world above. When her little feet grow stronger To walk life's paths untrod, That earnest, true and hopeful, She must lay her hands on God. Tell my other little children They must early seek His face; That His love is a strong tower, And His arms a hiding place. Tell themâbut my voice grows fainterâ Surely, husband, this is deathâ Tell them that their dying mother Bless'd them with her latest breath. WORDS FOR THE HOUR Men of the North! it is no time To quit the battle-field; When danger fronts your rear and van It is no time to yield. No time to bend the battle's crest Before the wily foe, And, ostrich-like, to hide your heads From the impending blow. The minions of a baffled wrong Are marshalling their clan, Rise up, rise up, enchanted North! And strike for God and man. This is no time for careless ease; No time for idle sleep; Go light the fires in every camp, And solemn sentries keep. The foe ye foiled upon the field Has only changed his base; New dangers crowd around you And stare you in the face. O Northern men! within your hands Is held no common trust; Secure the victories won by blood When treason bit the dust. 'Tis yours to banish from the land Oppression's iron rule; And o'er the ruin'd auction-block Erect the common school. To wipe from labor's branded brow The curse that shames the land; And teach the freedman how to wield The ballot in his hand. This is the nation's golden hour, Nerve every heart and hand, To build on Justice, as a rock, The future of the land. True to your trust, oh, never yield One citadel of right! With Truth and Justice clasping hands Ye yet shall win the fight! PRESIDENT LINCOLN'S PROCLAMATION OF FREEDOM It shall flash through the coming ages; It shall light the distant years; And eyes now dim with sorrow Shall be clearer through their tears. It shall flush the mountain ranges; And the valleys shall grow bright; It shall bathe the hills in radiance, And crown their brows with light. It shall flood with golden splendor And the huts of Caroline, And the sun-kissed brow of labor With lustre new shall shine. It shall gild the gloomy prison, Darken'd by the nation's crime, Where the dumb and patient millions Wait the better coming time. By the light that gilds their prison, They shall seize its mould'ring key, And the bolts and bars shall vibrate With the triumphs of the free. Like the dim and ancient chaos, Shrinking from the dawn of light, Oppression, grim and hoary, Shall cower at the sight. And her spawn of lies and malice Shall grovel in the dust, While joy shall thrill the bosoms Of the merciful and just. Though the morning seemed to linger O'er the hill-tops far away, Now the shadows bear the promise Of the quickly coming day. Soon the mists and murky shadows Shall be fringed with crimson light, And the glorious dawn of freedom Break refulgent on the sight. TO A BABE SMILING IN HER SLEEP Tell me, did the angels greet thee? Greet my darling when she smiled? Did they whisper, softly, gently, Pleasant thoughts unto my child? Did they whisper, 'mid thy dreaming, Thoughts that made thy spirit glad? Of the joy-lighted city, Where the heart is never sad? Did they tell thee of the fountains, Clear as crystal, fair as light, And the glory-brightened country, Never shaded by a night? Of life's pure, pellucid river, And the tree whose leaves do yield Healing for the wounded nationsâ Nations smitten, bruised and peeled? Of the city, ruby-founded, Built on gems of flashing light, Paling all earth's lustrous jewels, And the gates of pearly white? Darling, when life's shadows deepen Round thy prison-house of clay, May the footsteps of God's angels Ever linger round thy way. THE ARTIST He stood before his finished work; His heart beat warm and high; But they who gazed upon the youth Knew well that he must die. For many days a fever fierce Had burned into his life; But full of high impassioned art, He bore the fearful strife. And wrought in extacy and hope The image of his brain; He felt the death throes at his heart, But labored through the pain. The statue seemed to glow with lifeâ A costly work of art; For it he paid the fervent blood From his own eager heart. With kindling eye and flushing cheek But slowly laboring breath, He gazed upon his finished work, Then sought his couch of death. And when the plaudits of the crowd Came like the south wind's breath, The dreamy, gifted child of art Had closed his eyes in death. JESUS Come speak to me of Jesus, I love that precious name, Who built a throne of power Upon a cross of shame. Unveil to me the beauty That glorifies his faceâ The fullness of the fatherâ The image of his grace. My soul would run to meet Him; Restrain me not with creeds; For Christ, the hope of glory, Is what my spirit needs. I need the grand attraction, That centres 'round the cross, To change the gilded things of earth, To emptiness and dross. My feet are prone to wander, My eyes to turn aside, And yet I fain would linger, With Christ the crucified. I want a faith that's able To stand each storm and shockâ A faith forever rooted, In Christ the living Rock. FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT Beneath the burden of our joy Tremble, O wires, from East to West! Fashion with words your tongues of fire, To tell the nation's high behest. Outstrip the winds, and leave behind The murmur of the restless waves; Nor tarry with your glorious news, Amid the ocean's coral caves. Ring out! ring out! your sweetest chimes, Ye bells, that call to praise; Let every heart with gladness thrill, And songs of joyful triumph raise. Shake off the dust, O rising race! Crowned as a brother and a man; Justice to-day asserts her claim, And from thy brow fades out the ban. With freedom's chrism upon thy head, Her precious ensign in thy hand, Go place thy once despised name Amid the noblest of the land. A ransomed race! give God the praise, Who let thee through a crimson sea, And 'mid the storm of fire and blood, Turned out the war-cloud's light to thee. RETRIBUTION Judgment slumbered. God in mercy Stayed his strong avenging hand; Sent them priests and sent them prophets, But they would not understand. Judgment lingered; men, grown bolder, Gloried in their shame and guilt; And the blood of God's poor children Was as water freely spilt. Then arose a cry to heaven, Deep and startling, sad and wild, Sadder than the wail of Egypt, Mourning for the first-born child. For the sighing of the needy God at length did bare his hand, And the footsteps of his judgments Echoed through the guilty land. Oh! the terror, grief and anguish; Oh! the bitter, fearful strife, When the judgments of Jehovah Pressed upon the nation's life. And the land did reel and tremble 'Neath the terror of his frown, For its guilt lay heavy on it, Pressing like an iron crown. As a warning to the nations, Bathed in blood and swathed in fire, Lay the once oppressing nation, Smitten by God's fearful ire. THE SIN OF ACHAN Night closed o'er the battl'ing army, But it brought them no success; Victory perched not on their banners; Night was full of weariness. Flushed and hopeful in the morning, Turned they from their leader's side: Routed, smitten and defeated, Came they back at eventide. Then in words of bitter mourning Joshua's voice soon arose: âTell us, O thou God of Jacob, Why this triumph of our foes?â To his pleading came the answer Why the hosts in fear did yield: â'Twas because a fearful trespass 'Mid their tents did lie concealed.â Clear and plain before His vision, With whom darkness is as light, Lay the spoils that guilty Achan Covered from his brethren's sight. From their tents they purged the evil That had ruin round them spread; Then they won the field of battle, Whence they had in terror fled. Through the track of many ages Comes this tale of woe and crime; Let us read it as a lesson And a warning for our time. Oh, for some strong-hearted Joshua! Faithful to his day and time, Who will wholly rid the nation Of her clinging curse and crime. Till she writes on every banner All beneath these folds are free, And the oppressed and groaning millions Shout the nation's Jubilee. LINES TO MILES O'REILEY You've heard no doubt of Irish bulls, And how they blunder, thick and fast; But of all the queer and foolish things, O'Reiley, you have said the last. You say we brought the rebs supplies, And gave them aid amid the fight, And if you must be ruled by rebs, Instead of black you want them white. You blame us that we did not rise, And pluck war from a fiery brand, When Little Mac said if we did, He'd put us down with iron hand. And when we sought to join your ranks, And battle with you, side by side, Did men not curl their lips with scorn, And thrust us back with hateful pride? And when at last we gained the field, Did we not firmly, bravely stand, And help to turn the tide of death, That spread its ruin o'er the land? We hardly think we're worse than those Who kindled up this fearful strife, Because we did not seize the chance To murder helpless babes and wife. And had we struck, with vengeful hand, The rebel where he most could feel, Were you not ready to impale Out hearts upon your Northern steel? O'Reiley, men like you should wear The gift of song, like some bright crown, Nor worse than ruffians of the ring, Strike at a man because he's down. THE LITTLE BUILDERS Ye are builders little builders, Not with mortar, brick and stone, But your work is far more gloriousâ Ye are building freedom's throne. Where the ocean never slumbers Works the coral 'neath the spray, By and by a reef or island Rears its head to greet the day. When the balmy rains and sunshine Scatter treasures o'er the soil, 'Till a place for human footprints, Crown the little builder's toil. When the stately ships sweep o'er them, Cresting all the sea with foam, Little think these patient toilers, They are building man a home. Do you ask me, precious children, How your little hands can build, That you love the name of freedom, But your fingers are unskilled? Not on thrones or in proud temples, Does fair freedom seek her rest; No, her chosen habitations, Are the hearts that love her best. Would you gain the highest freedom? Live for God and man alone, Then each heart in freedom's temple Will be like a living stone. Fill your minds with useful knowledge, Learn to love the true and right; Thus you'll build the throne of freedom, On a pedestal of light. THE DYING CHILD TO HER BLIND FATHER Dear father, I hear a whisper, It tells me that I must go, And my heart returns her answer In throbbings so faint and low. I'm sorry to leave you, father, I know you will miss me so, And the world for you will gather A gloomier shade of woe. You will miss me, dearest father, When the violets wake from sleep, And timidly from their hedges The early snow-drops peep. I shall not be here to gather The flowers by stream and dell, The bright and beautiful flowers, Dear Father, you love so well. You will miss my voice, dear father, From every earthly tone, All the songs that cheered your darkness, And you'll be so sad and lone. I can scarcely rejoice, dear father, In hope of the brighter land, When I know you'll pine in sadness, And miss my guiding hand. You are weeping, dearest father, Your sobs are shaking my soul, But we'll meet again where the shadow And night from your eyes shall roll. And then you will see me, father, With visions undimmed and clear, Your eyes will sparkle with raptureâ You know there's no blindness there. LIGHT IN DARKNESS We've room to build holy altars Where our crumbling idols lay; We've room for heavenly visions, When our earth dreams fade away. Through rifts and rents in our fortune We gaze with blinding tears, Till glimpses of light and beauty Gilded our gloomy fears. An angel stood at our threshold, We thought him a child of night, Till we saw the print of his steps Made lines of living light. We had much the world calls precious; We had heaps of shining dust; We laid his hand on our treasures, And wrote on them moth and rust. But still we had other treasures, That gold was too poor to buy, We clasped them closer and closer, But saw them fade and die. Our spirit grew faint and heavy, Deep shadows lay on our years, Till light from the holy city, Streamed through our mist of tears. And we thanked the chastening angel Who shaded our earthly light For the light and beautiful visions That broke on our clearer sight. Our first view of the Holy City Came through our darken'd years, The songs that lightened our sorrows, We heard 'mid our night of tears. OUR ENGLISH FRIENDS Your land is crowned with regal men, Whose brows ne'er wore a diadem,â The men who, in our hour of need, Reached out their hands and bade God speed. Who watched across the distant strand The anguish of our fainting land, And grandly made our cause their own, Till Slavery tottered on her throne. When Slavery, full of wrath and strife, Was clutching at the Nation's life, How precious were your words of cheer That fell upon the listening ear. And when did fame, with glowing pen, Record the deeds of nobler men,â The men who, facing want and pain, Loved freedom more than paltry gain. O noble men! ye bravely stood True to our country's highest good; May God, who saw your aims and ends, Forever bless our English friends! [I remember, well remember] AUNT CHLOE I remember, well remember, That dark and dreadful day, When they whispered to me, âChloe, Your children's sold away!â It seemed as if a bullet Had shot me through and through, And I felt as if my heart-strings Was breaking right in two. And I says to cousin Milly, âThere must be some mistake; Where's Mistus?â âIn the great house cryingâ Crying like her heart would break. âAnd the lawyer's there with Mistus; Says he's come to 'ministrate, 'Cause when master died he just left Heap of debt on the estate. âAnd I thought 'twould do you good To bid your boys good-byeâ To kiss them both and shake their hands, And have a hearty cry. âOh! Chloe, I knows how you feel, 'Cause I'se been through it all; I thought my poor old heart would break, When master sold my Saul.â Just then I heard the footsteps Of my children at the door, And then I rose right up to meet them, But I fell upon the floor. And I heard poor Jakey saying, âOh, mammy, don't you cry!â And I felt my children kiss me And bid me, both, good-bye. Then I had a mighty sorrow, Though I nursed it all alone; But I wasted to a shadow, And turned to skin and bone. But one day dear uncle Jacob (In heaven he's now a saint) Said, âYour poor heart is in the fire, But child you must not faint.â Then I said to uncle Jacob, If I was good like you, When the heavy trouble dashed me I'd know just what to do. Then he said to me, âPoor Chloe, The way is open wide:â And he told me of the Saviour, And the fountain in His side. Then he said âJust take your burden To the blessed Master's feet; I takes all my troubles, Chloe, Right unto the mercy-seat.â His words waked up my courage, And I began to pray, And I felt my heavy burden Rolling like a stone away. And a something seemed to tell me, You will see your boys againâ And that hope was like a poultice Spread upon a dreadful pain. And it often seemed to whisper, Chloe, trust and never fear; You'll get justice in the kingdom, If you do not get it here. The Deliverance Master only left old Mistus One bright and handsome boy; But she fairly doted on him, He was her pride and joy. We all liked Mister Thomas, He was so kind at heart; And when the young folkes got in scrapes, He always took their part. He kept right on that very way Till he got big and tall, And old Mistus used to chide him And say he'd spile us all. But somehow the farm did prosper When he took things in hand; And though all the servants liked him, He made them understand. One evening Mister Thomas said, âJust bring my easy shoes; I am going to sit by mother, And read her up the news.â Soon I heard him tell old Mistus We're bound to have a fight; But we'll whip the Yankees, mother, We'll whip them sure as night!â Then I saw old Mistus tremble; She gasped and held her breath; And she looked on Mister Thomas With a face as pale as death. âThey are firing on Fort Sumpter; Oh! I wish that I was there!â Why, dear mother! what's the matter? You're the picture of despair.â âI was thinking, dearest Thomas, 'Twould break my very heart If a fierce and dreadful battle Should tear our lives apart.â âNone but cowards, dearest mother, Would skulk unto the rear, When the tyrant's hand is shaking All the heart is holding dear.â I felt sorry for old Mistus; She got too full to speak; But I saw the great big tear-drops A running down her cheek. Mister Thomas too was troubled With choosing on that night, Betwixt staying with his mother And joining in the fight. Soon down into the village came A call for volunteers; Mistus gave up Mister Thomas, With many sighs and tears. His uniform was real handsome; He looked so brave and strong; But somehow I could'nt help thinking His fighting must be wrong. Though the house was very lonesome, I thought 'twould all come right, For I felt somehow or other We was mixed up in that fight. And I said to Uncle Jacob, âHow old Mistus feels the sting, For this parting with your children Is a mighty dreadful thing.â âNever mind,â said Uncle Jacob, âJust wait and watch and pray, For I feel right sure and certain, Slavery's bound to pass away; âBecause I asked the Spirit, If God is good and just, How it happened that the masters Did grind us to the dust. âAnd something reasoned right inside, Such should not always be; And you could not beat it out my head, The Spirit spoke to me.â And his dear old eyes would brighten, And his lips put on a smile, Saying, âPick up faith and courage, And just wait a little while.â Mistus prayed up in the parlor, That the Secesh all might win; We were praying in the cabins, Wanting freedom to begin. Mister Thomas wrote to Mistus, Telling 'bout the Bull's Run fight, That his troops had whipped the Yankees And put them all to flight. Mistus' eyes did fairly glisten; She laughed and praised the South, But I thought some day she'd laugh On tother side her mouth. I used to watch old Mistus' face, And when it looked quite long I would say to Cousin Milly, The battle's going wrong; Not for us, but for the Rebels.â My heart would fairly skip, When Uncle Jacob used to say, âThe North is bound to whip.â And let the fight go as it wouldâ Let North or South prevailâ He always kept his courage up, And never let it fail. And he often used to tell us, âChildren, don't forget to pray; For the darkest time of morning Is just 'fore the break of day.â Well, one morning bright and early We heard the fife and drum, And the booming of the cannonâ The Yankee troops had come. When the word ran through the village, The colored folks are freeâ In the kitchens and the cabins We held a jubilee. When they told us Mister Lincoln Said that slavery was dead, We just poured our prayers and blessings Upon his precious head. We just laughed, and danced, and shouted And prayed, and sang, and cried, And we thought dear Uncle Jacob Would fairly crack his side. But when old Mistus heard it, She groaned and hardly spoke; When she had to lose her servants, Her heart was almost broke. 'Twas a sight to see our people Going out, the troops to meet, Almost dancing to the music, And marching down the street. After years of pain and parting, Our chains was broke in two, And we was so mighty happy, We didn't know what to do. But we soon got used to freedom, Though the way at first was rough; But we weathered through the tempest, For slavery made us tough. But we had one awful sorrow, It almost turned my head, When a mean and wicked cretur Shot Mister Lincoln dead. 'Twas a dreadful solemn morning, I just staggered on my feet; And the women they were crying And screaming in the street. But if many prayers and blessings Could bear him to the throne, I should think when Mister Lincoln died, That heaven just got its own. Then we had another President,â What do you call his name? Well, if the colored folks forget him They would'nt be much to blame. We thought he'd be the Moses Of all the colored race; But when the Rebels pressed us hard He never showed his face. But something must have happened him, Right curi's I'll be bound, 'Cause I heard 'em talking 'bout a circle That he was swinging round. But everything will pass awayâ He went like time and tideâ And when the next election came They let poor Andy slide. But now we have a President, And if I was a man I'd vote for him for breaking up The wicked Ku-Klux Klan. And if any man should ask me If I would sell my vote, I'd tell him I was not the one To change and turn my coat; If freedom seem'd a little rough I'd weather through the gale; And as to buying up my vote, I hadn't it for sale. I do not think I'd ever be As slack as Jonas Handy; Because I heard he sold his vote For just three sticks of candy. But when John Thomas Reeder brought His wife some flour and meat, And told he had sold his vote For something good to eat, You ought to seen Aunt Kitty raise, And heard her blaze away; She gave the meat and flour a toss, And said they should not stay. And I should think he felt quite cheap For voting the wrong side; And when Aunt Kitty scolded him, He just stood up and cried. But the worst fooled man I ever saw, Was when poor David Rand Sold out for flour and sugar; The sugar was mixed with sand. I'll tell you how the thing got out; His wife had company, And she thought the sand was sugar, And served it up for tea. When David sipped and sipped the tea, Somehow it didn't taste right; I guess when he found he was sipping sand He was mad enough to fight. The sugar looked so nice and whiteâ It was spread some inches deepâ But underneath was a lot of sand; Such sugar is mighty cheap. You'd laughed to seen Lucinda Grange Upon her husband's track; When he sold his vote for rations She made him take 'em back. Day after day did Milly Green Just follow after Joe, And told him if he voted wrong To take his rags and go. I think that Samuel Johnson said His side had won the day, Had not we women radicals Just got right in the way. And yet I would not have you think That all our men are shabby; But 'tis said in every flock of sheep There will be one that's scabby. I've heard, before election came They tried to buy John Slade; But he gave them all to understand That he wasn't in that trade. And we've got lots of other men Who rally round the cause, And go for holding up the hands That gave us equal laws, Who know their freedom cost too much Of blood and pain and treasure, For them to fool away their votes For profit or for pleasure. Aunt Chloe's Politics Of course, I don't know very much About these politics, But I think that some who run 'em, Do mighty ugly tricks. I've seen 'em honey-fugle round, And talk so awful sweet, That you'd think them full of kindness As an egg is full of meat. Now I don't believe in looking Honest people in the face, And saying when you're doing wrong, That âI haven't sold my race.â When we want to school our children, If the money isn't there, Whether black or white have took it, The loss we all must share. And this buying up each other Is something worse than mean, Though I thinks a heap of voting, I go for voting clean. Learning to Read Very soon the Yankee teachers Came down and set up school; But, oh! how the Rebs did hate it,â It was agin' their rule. Our masters always tried to hide Book learning from our eyes; Knowledge did'nt agree with slaveryâ 'Twould make us all too wise. But some of us would try to steal A little from the book, And put the words together, And learn by hook or crook. I remember Uncle Caldwell, Who took pot liquor fat And greased the pages of his book, And hid it in his hat. And had his master ever seen The leaves upon his head, He'd have thought them greasy papers, But nothing to be read. And there was Mr. Turner's Ben, Who heard the children spell, And picked the words right up by heart, And learned to read 'em well. Well, the Northern folks kept sending The Yankee teachers down; And they stood right up and helped us, Though Rebs did sneer and frown. And I longed to read my Bible, For precious words it said; But when I begun to learn it, Folks just shook their heads, And said there is no use trying, Oh! Chloe, you're too late; But as I was rising sixty, I had no time to wait. So I got a pair of glasses, And straight to work I went, And never stopped till I could read The hymns and Testament. Then I got a little cabin A place to call my ownâ And I felt as independent As the queen upon her throne. Church Building Uncle Jacob often told us, Since freedom blessed our race We ought all to come together And build a meeting place. So we pinched, and scraped, and spared, A little here and there: Though our wages was but scanty, The church did get a share. And, when the house was finished, Uncle Jacob came to pray; He was looking mighty feeble, And his head was awful gray. But his voice rang like a trumpet; His eyes looked bright and young; And it seemed a mighty power Was resting on his tongue. And he gave us all his blessingâ 'Twas parting words he said, For soon we got the message The dear old man was dead. But I believe he's in the kingdom, For when we shook his hand He said, âChildren, you must meet me Right in the promised land; âFor when I done a moiling And toiling here below, Through the gate into the city Straightway I hope to go.â The Reunion Well, one morning real early I was going down the street, And I heard a stranger asking For Missis Chloe Fleet. There was something in his voice That made me feel quite shaky. And when I looked right in his face, Who should it be but Jakey! I grasped him tight, and took him homeâ What gladness filled my cup! And I laughed, and just rolled over, And laughed, and just give up. âWhere have you been? O Jakey, dear! Why didn't you come before? Oh! when you children went away My heart was awful sore.â âWhy, mammy, I've been on your hunt Since ever I've been free, And I have heard from brother Ben,â He's down in Tennessee. âHe wrote me that he had a wife,â âAnd children?â âYes, he's three.â âYou married, too?â âOh, no, indeed, I thought I'd first get free.â âThen, Jakey, you will stay with me, And comfort my poor heart; Old Mistus got no power now To tear us both apart. âI'm richer now than Mistus, Because I have got my son; And Mister Thomas he is dead, And she's nary one. âYou must write to brother Benny That he must come this fall, And we'll make the cabin bigger, And that will hold us all. âTell him I want to see 'em all Before my life do cease: And then, like good old Simeon, I hope to die in peace.â I THIRST First Voice I thirst, but earth cannot allay The fever coursing through my veins, The healing stream is far awayâ It flows through Salem's lovely plains. The murmurs of its crystal flow Break ever o'er this world of strife; My heart is weary, let me go, To bathe it in the stream of life; For many worn and weary hearts Have bathed in this pure healing stream, And felt their griefs and cares depart, E'en like some sad forgotten dream. Second Voice âThe Word is nigh thee, even in thy heart.â Say not, within thy weary heart, Who shall ascend above, To bring unto thy fever'd lips The fount of joy and love. Nor do thou seek to vainly delve Where death's pale angels tread, To hear the murmur of its flow Around the silent dead. Within, in thee is the living fount, Fed from the springs above; There quench thy thirst till thou shalt bathe In God's own sea of love. THE DYING QUEEN âI would meet death awake.â The strength that bore her on for years Was ebbing fast away, And o'er the pale and life-worn face, Death's solemn shadows lay. With tender love and gentle care, Friends gathered round her bed, And for her sake each footfall hushed The echoes of its tread. They knew the restlessness of death Through every nerve did creep, And carefully they tried to lull The dying queen to sleep. In vain she felt Death's icy hand Her failing heart-strings shake; And, rousing up, she firmly said, âI'd meet my God awake.â Awake, I've met the battle's shock And born the cares of state; Nor shall I take your lethean cup, And slumber at death's gate. Did I not watch with eyes alert, The path where foes did tend; And shall I veil my eyes with sleep, To meet my God and friend? Nay, rather from my weary lids, This heavy slumber shake, That I may pass the mystic vale And meet my God awake. THE JEWISH GRANDFATHER'S STORY Come, gather around me, children, And a story I will tell, How we builded the beautiful templeâ The temple we love so well. I must date my story backward To a distant age and land, When God did break our fathers' chains By his mighty outstretched hand. Our fathers were strangers and captives, Where the ancient Nile doth flow; Smitten by cruel taskmasters, And burdened by toil and woe. As a shepherd, to pastures green Doth lead with care his sheep, So God divided the great Red Sea, And led them through the deep. You've seen me plant a tender vine, And guard it with patient care, Till its roots struck in the mellow earth, And it drank the light and air. So God did plant our chosen race. As vine in this fair land; And we grew and spread a fruitful tree, The planting of his right hand. The time would fail strove I to tell, All the story of our raceâ Or our grand old leader, Moses, And Joshua in his place. Of all our rulers and judges, From Joshua unto Saul, Over whose doomed and guilty head Fell ruin and death's dark pall. Of valiant Jepthath, whose brave heart With sudden grief did bow, When his daughter came with dance and song Unconscious of his vow. Of Gideon, lifting up his voice To him who rules the sky, And wringing out his well drenched fleece When all around was dry. How Deborah, neath her spreading palms, A judge in Israel rose, And wrested victory from the hands Of Jacob's heathen foes. Of Samuel, an upright judge, The last who ruled our tribes, Whose noble life and cleanly hands, Were pure and free from bribes. Of David, with his checkered life Our tuneful minstrel king, Who breathed in sadness and delight, The psalms we love to sing. Of Solomon, whose wandering heart, From Jacob's God did stray, And cast the richest gifts of life, In pleasure's cup away. How aged men advised his son, But found him weak and vain, Until the kingdom from his hands Was rudely rent in twain. Oh! sin and strife are fearful things, They widen as they go, And leave behind them shades of death, And open gates of woe. A trail of guilt, a gloomy line, Ran through our nation's life, And wicked kings provoke our God, And sin and woe were rife. At length, there came a day of doomâ A day of grief and dread; When judgment like a fearful storm Swept o'er our country's head. And we were captives many years, Where Babel's stream doth flow; With harps unstrung, on willows hung, We wept in silent woe. We could not sing the old, sweet songs, Our captors asked to hear; Our hearts were full, how could we sing The songs to us so dear? As one who dreams a mournful dream, Which fades, as wanes the night, So God did change our gloomy lot From darkness into light. Belshazzar in his regal halls, A sumptuous feast did hold; He praised his gods and drank his wine From sacred cups of gold. When dance and song and revelry Had filled with mirth each hall, Belshazzar raised his eyes and saw A writing on the wall. He saw, and horror blanched his cheek, His lips were white with fear; To read the words he quickly called For wise men, far and near. But baffled seers, with anxious doubt Stood silent in the room, When Daniel came, a captive youth, And read the words of doom. That night, within his regal hall, Belshazzar lifeless lay; The Persians grasped his fallen crown And with the Mede held sway. Darius came, and Daniel rose A man of high renown; But wicked courtiers schemed and planned To drag the prophet down. They came as men who wished to place Great honors on their kingâ With flattering lips and oily words, Desired a certain thing. They knew that Daniel, day by day Towards Salem turned his face, And asked the king to sign a law His hands might not erase. That till one moon had waned away, No cherished wish or thing Should any ask of men or Gods, Unless it were the king. But Daniel, full of holy trust, His windows opened wide, Regardless of the king's command, Unto his God he cried. They brought him forth that he might be The hungry lion's meat, Awe struck, the lions turned away And crouched near his feet. The God he served was strong to save His servant in the den; The fate devised for Daniel's life O'er took those scheming men. And Cyrus came, a gracious King, And gave the blest command, That we, the scattered Jews, should build Anew our Fallen land. The men who hated Juda's weal Were filled with bitter rage, And 'gainst the progress of our work Did evil men engage. Sanballet tried to hinder us, And Gashmu uttered lies, But like a thing of joy and light, We saw our temple rise. And from the tower of Hananeel Unto the corner gate, We built the wall and did restore The places desolate. Some mocked us as we labored on And scoffingly did say, âIf but a fox climb on the wall, Their work will give away.â But Nehemiah wrought in hope, Though heathen foes did frown âMy work is great,â he firmly said, âAnd I cannot come down.â And when Shemai counselled him The temple door to close, To hide, lest he should fall a prey Unto his cruel foes. Strong in his faith, he answered, No. He would oppose the tide, Should such as he from danger flee And in the temple hide? We wrought in earnest faith and hope Until we build the wall, And then, unto a joyful feast Did priest and people call. We came to dedicate the wall With sacrifice and joyâ A happy throng, from aged sire Unto the fair-haired boy. Our lips so used to mournful songs, Did joyous laughter fill, And strong men wept with sacred joy To stand on Zion's hill. Mid scoffing foes and evil men, We build our city blest, And 'neath our sheltering vines and palms To-day in peace we rest. OUT IN THE COLD Out in the cold mid the dreary night, Under the eaves of homes so bright; Snowflakes falling o'er mother's grave Will no one rescue, no one save? A child left out in the dark and cold, A lamb not sheltered in any fold, Hearing the wolves of hunger bark, Out in the cold! and out in the dark. Missing to-night the charming bliss That lies in the mother's good-night kiss; And hearing no loving father's prayer, For blessings his children all may share. Creeping away to some wretched den, To sleep mid the curses of drunken men And women, not as God has made, Wretched and ruined, wronged and betrayed. Church of the Lord reach thy arm, And shield the hapless one from harm; Where the waves of sin are dashing wild: Rescue and save the drifting child. Wash from her life guilt's turbid foam, In the fair haven of a home; Tenderly lead the motherless girl Up to the gates of purest pearl. The wandering feet which else had strayed, From thorny paths may yet be stayed; And a crimson track through the cold dark night May exchange to a line of loving light. SAVE THE BOYS Like Dives in the deeps of Hell I cannot break this fearful spell, Nor quench the fires I've madly nursed, Nor cool this dreadful raging thirst. Take back your pledgeâye come too late! Ye cannot save me from my fate, Nor bring me back departed joys; But ye can try to save the boys. Ye bid me break my fiery chain, Arise and be a man again, When every street with snares is spread, And nets of sin where'er I tread. No; I must reap as I did sow. The seeds of sin bring crops of woe; But with my latest breath I'll crave That ye will try the boys to save. These bloodshot eyes were once so bright; This sin-crushed heart was glad and light; But by the wine-cup's ruddy glow I traced a path to shame and woe. A captive to my galling chain, I've tried to rise, but tried in vainâ The cup allures and then destroys. Oh! from its thraldom save the boys. Take from your streets those traps of hell Into whose gilded snares I fell. Oh! freemen, from these foul decoys Arise, and vote to save the boys. Oh! ye who license men to trade In draughts that charm and then degrade, Before ye hear the cry, âToo late,â Oh, save the boys from my sad fate. NOTHING AND SOMETHING âIt is nothing to me,â the beauty said, With a careless toss of her pretty head; âThe man is weak if he can't refrain From the cup you say is fraught with pain.â It was something to her in after years, When her eyes were drenched with burning tears, And she watched in lonely grief and dread, And startled to hear a staggering tread. âIt is nothing to me,â the mother said; âI have no fear that my boy will tread In the downward path of sin and shame, And crush my heart and darken his name.â It was something to her when that only son From the path of right was early won, And madly cast in the flowing bowl A ruined body and sin-wrecked soul. âIt is nothing to me,â the young man cried: In his eye was a flash of scorn and pride; âI heed not the dreadful things ye tell: I can rule myself I know full well.â It was something to him when in prison he lay The victim of drink, life ebbing away; And thought of his wretched child and wife, And the mournful wreck of his wasted life. âIt is nothing to me,â the merchant said, As over his ledger he bent his head; âI'm busy to-day with tare and tret, And I have no time to fume and fret.â It was something to him when over the wire A message came from a funeral pyreâ A drunken conductor had wrecked a train, And his wife and child were among the slain. âIt is nothing to me,â the voter said, âThe party's loss is my greatest dreadâ; Then gave his vote for the liquor trade, Though hearts were crushed and drunkards made. It was something to him in after life, When his daughter became a drunkard's wife And her hungry children cried for bread, And trembled to hear their father's tread. Is it nothing for us to idly sleep While the cohorts of death their vigils keep? To gather the young and thoughtless in, And grind in our midst a grist of sin? It is something, yes, all, for us to stand Clasping by faith our Saviour's hand; To learn to labor, live and fight On the side of God and changeless light. WANDERER'S RETURN My home is so glad, my heart is so light, My wandering boy has returned to-night. He is blighted and bruised, I know, by sin, But I am so glad to welcome him in. The child of my tenderest love and care Has broken away from the tempter's snare; To-night my heart is o'erflowing with joy, I have found again my wandering boy. My heart has been wrung with a thousand fears, Mine eyes been drenched with the bitterest tears; Like shadows that fade are my past alarms, My boy is enclasped in his mother's arms. The streets were not safe for my darling child; Where sin with its evil attractions smiled. But his wandering feet have ceased to roam, And to-night my wayward boy is at homeâ At home with the mother that loves him best, With the hearts that have ached with sad unrest, With the hearts that are thrilling with untold joy Because we have found our wandering boy. In that wretched man so haggard and wild I only behold my returning child, And the blissful tears from my eyes that start Are the overflow of a happy heart. I have trodden the streets in lonely grief, I have sought in prayer for my sole relief; But the depths of my heart to-night are stirred, I know that the mother's prayer has been heard. If the mother-love be so strong and great For her child, sin-weary and desolate, Oh what must the love of the father be For souls who have wandered like you and me! FISHERS OF MEN I had a dream, a varied dream: Before my ravished sight The city of my Lord arose, With all its love and light. The music of a myriad harps Flowed out with sweet accord; And saints were casting down their crowns In homage to our Lord. My heart leaped up with untold joy; Life's toil and pain were o'er; My weary feet at last had found The bright and restful shore. Just as I reached the gates of light, Ready to enter in, From earth arose a fearful cry Of sorrow and of sin. I turned, and saw behind me surge A wild and stormy sea; And drowning men were reaching out Imploring hands to me. And ev'ry lip was blanched with dread And moaning for relief; The music of the golden harps Grew fainter for their grief. Let me return, I quickly said. Close to the pearly gate; My work is with these wretched ones, So wrecked and desolate. An angel smiled and gently said: This is the gate of life, Wilt thou return to earth's sad scenes, Its weariness and strife. To comfort hearts that sigh and break, To dry the falling tear, Wilt thou forego the music sweet Entrancing now thy ear? I must return, I firmly said, The strugglers in that sea Shall not reach out beseeching hands In vain for help to me. I turned to go; but as I turned The gloomy sea grew bright, And from my heart there seemed to flow Ten thousand cords of light. And sin-wrecked men, with eager hands Did grasp each golden cord; And with my heart I drew them on To see my gracious Lord. Again I stood beside the gate. My heart was glad and free; For with me stood a rescued throng The Lord had given me. SIGNING THE PLEDGE Do you see this cupâthis tempting cupâ Its sparkle and its glow? I tell you this cup has brought to me A world of shame and woe. Do you see that woman sad and wan? One day with joy and pride, With orange blossoms in her hair, I claimed her as my bride. And vowed that I would faithful prove Till death our lives should part; I've drenched her soul with floods of grief, And almost crushed her heart. Do you see that gray-haired mother bend Beneath her weight of years? I've filled that aged mother's eyes With many bitter tears. Year after year for me she prays, And tries her child to save; I've almost brought her gray hairs down In sorrow to the grave. Do you see that boy whose wistful eyes Are gazing on my face? I've overshadowed his young life With sorrow and disgrace. He used to greet me with a smile, His heart was light and glad; I've seen him tremble at my voice, I've made that heart so sad. Do you see this pledge I've signed to-night? My mother, wife, and boy Shall read my purpose on that pledge And smile through tears of joy. To know this night, this very night, I cast the wine-cup down, And from the dust of a sinful life Lift up my manhood's crown. The faded face of my young wife With roses yet shall bloom, And joy shall light my mother's eyes On the margin of the tomb. I have vowed to-night my only boy, With brow so fair and mild, Shall not be taunted on the streets, And called a drunkard's child. Never again shall that young face Whiten with grief and dread, Because I've madly staggered home And sold for drink his bread. This strong right arm unnerved by rum Shall battle with my fate; And peace and comfort crown the home By drink made desolate. Like a drowning man, tempest-tossed, Clings to a rocky ledge, With trembling hands I've learned to grasp The gospel and the pledge. A captive bounding from my chain, I've rent each hateful band, And by the help of grace divine A victor hope to stand. THE MARTYR OF ALABAMA (The following news item appeared in the newspapers throughout the country, issue of December 27, 1894: âTim Thompson, a little negro boy, was asked to dance for the amusement of some white toughs. He refused, saying he was a church member. One of the men knocked him down with a club and then danced upon his prostrate form. He then shot the boy in the hip. The boy is dead; his murderer is still at large.â) He lifted up his pleading eyes, And scanned each cruel face, Where cold and brutal cowardice Had left its evil trace. It was when tender memories Round Beth'lem's manger lay, And mothers told their little ones Of Jesu's natal day. And of the Magi from the East Who came their gifts to bring, And bow in rev'rence at the feet Of Salem's new-born King. And how the herald angels sang The choral song of peace, That war should close his wrathful lips, And strife and carnage cease. At such an hour men well may hush Their discord and their strife, And o'er that manger clasp their hands With gifts to brighten life. Alas! that in our favored land, That cruelty and crime Should cast their shadows o'er a day, The fairest pearl of time. A dark-browed boy had drawn anear A band of savage men, Just as a hapless lamb might stray Into a tiger's den. Cruel and dull, they saw in him For sport an evil chance, And then demanded of the child To give to them a dance. âCome dance for usâ the rough men said; âI can't,â the child replied, âI cannot for the dear Lord's sake, Who for my sins once died.â Tho they were strong and he was weak, He wouldn't his Lord deny, His life lay in their cruel hands, But he for Christ could die. Heard they aright? Did that brave child Their mandates dare resist? Did he against their stern commands Have courage to resist? Then recklessly a man(?) arose, And dealt a fearful blow. He crushed the portals of that life, And laid the brave child low. And trampled on his prostrate form, As on a broken toy; Then danced with careless, brutal feet, Upon the murdered boy. Christians! behold that martyred child! His blood cries from the ground; Before the sleepless eye of God, He shows each gaping wound. Oh! Church of Christ arise! arise! Let crimson stain thy hand, When God shall inquisition make For blood shed in the land. Take sackcloth of the darkest hue, And shroud the pulpit round; Servants of him who cannot lie Sit mourning on the ground. Let holy horror blanch each brow, Pale every cheek with fears, And rocks and stones, if ye could speak, Ye well might melt to tears. Through every fane send forth a cry, Of sorrow and regret, Nor in an hour of careless ease Thy brother's wrongs forget. Veil not thine eyes, nor close thy lips, Nor speak with bated breath; This evil shall not always last,â The end of it is death. Avert the doom that crime must bring Upon a guilty land; Strong in the strength that God supplies, For truth and justice stand. For Christless men, with reckless hands, Are sowing around thy path The tempests wild that yet shall break In whirlwinds of God's wrath. THE NIGHT OF DEATH 'Twas a night of dreadful horror,â Death was sweeping through the land; And the wings of dark destruction Were outstretched from strand to strand. Strong men's hearts grew faint with terror, As the tempest and the waves Wrecked their homes and swept them downward, Suddenly to yawning graves. 'Mid the wastes of ruined households, And the tempest's wild alarms, Stood a terror-stricken mother With a child within her arms. Other children huddled 'round her, Each one nestling in her heart; Swift in thought and swift in action, She at least from one must part. Then she said unto her daughter, âStrive to save one child from death.â âWhich one?â said the anxious daughter, As she stood with bated breath. Oh! the anguish of that mother; What despair was in her eye! All her little ones were precious; Which one should she leave to die? Then outspake the brother Bennie: âI will take the little one.â âNo,â exclaimed the anxious mother; âNo, my child, it can't be done.â âSee! my boy, the waves are rising, Save yourself and leave the child!â âI will trust in Christ,â he answered; Grasped the little one and smiled. Through the roar of wind and waters Ever and anon she cried; But throughout the night of terror Never Bennie's voice replied. But above the waves' wild surging He had found a safe retreat, As if God had sent an angel, Just to guide his wandering feet. When the storm had spent its fury, And the sea gave up its dead, She was mourning for her loved ones, Lost amid that night of dread. While her head was bowed in anguish, On her ear there fell a voice, Bringing surcease to her sorrow, Bidding all her heart rejoice. âDidn't I tell you true?â said Bennie, And his eyes were full of light, âWhen I told you God would help me Through the dark and dreadful night?â And he placed the little darling Safe within his mother's arms, Feeling Christ had been his guardian, 'Mid the dangers and alarms. Oh! for faith so firm and precious, In the darkest, saddest night, Till life's gloom-encircled shadows Fade in everlasting light. And upon the mount of vision We our loved and lost shall greet, With earth's wildest storms behind us, And its cares beneath our feet. MOTHER'S TREASURES Two little children sit by my side, I call them Lily and Daffodil; I gaze on them with a mother's pride, One is Edna, the other is Will. Both have eyes of starry light, And laughing lips o'er teeth of pearl. I would not change for a diadem My noble boy and darling girl. To-night my heart o'erflows with joy; I hold them as a sacred trust; I fain would hide them in my heart, Safe from tarnish of moth and rust. What should I ask for my dear boy? The richest gifts of wealth or fame? What for my girl? A loving heart And a fair and spotless name? What for my boy? That he should stand A pillar of strength to the state? What for my girl? That she should be The friend of the poor and desolate? I do not ask they shall never tread With weary feet the paths of pain. I ask that in the darkest hour They may faithful and true remain. I only ask their lives may be Pure as gems in the gates of pearl, Lives to brighten and bless the worldâ This I ask for my boy and girl. I ask to clasp their hands again 'Mid the holy hosts of heaven, Enraptured say: âI am here, oh! God, And the children Thou has given.â THE REFINER'S GOLD He stood before my heart's closed door, And asked to enter in; But I had barred the passage o'er By unbelief and sin. He came with nail-prints in his hands, To set my spirit free; With wounded feet he trod a path To come and sup with me. He found me poor and brought me gold, The fire of love had tried, And garments whitened by his blood, My wretchedness to hide. The glare of life had dimmed my eyes, Its glamour was too bright. He came with ointment in his hands To heal my darkened sight. He knew my heart was tempest-tossed, By care and pain oppressed; He whispered to my burdened heart, Come unto me and rest. He found me weary, faint and worn, On barren mountains cold; With love's constraint he drew me on, To shelter in his fold. Oh! foolish heart, how slow wert thou To welcome thy dear guest, To change thy weariness and care For comfort, peace and rest. Close to his side, oh! may I stay, Just to behold his face, Till I shall wear within my soul The image of his grace. The grace that changes hearts of stone To tenderness and love, And bids us run with willing feet Unto his courts above. A STORY OF THE REBELLION The treacherous sands had caught our boat, And held it with a strong embrace And death at our imprisoned crew Was sternly looking face to face. With anxious hearts, but failing strength, We strove to push the boat from shore; But all in vain, for there we lay With bated breath and useless oar. Around us in a fearful storm The fiery hail fell thick and fast; And we engirded by the sand, Could not return the dreadful blast. When one arose upon whose brow The ardent sun had left his trace; A noble purpose strong and high Uplighting all his dusky face. Perchance within that fateful hour The wrongs of ages thronged apace; But with it came the glorious hope Of swift deliverance to his race. Of galling chains asunder rent, Of severed hearts again made one, Of freedom crowning all the land Through battles gained and victories won. âSome one,â our hero firmly said, âMust die to get us out of this;â Then leaped upon the strand and bared His bosom to the bullets' hiss. âBut ye are soldiers, and can fight, May win in battles yet unfought; I have no offering but my life, And if they kill me it is nought.â With steady hands he grasped the boat, And boldly pushed it from the shore; Then fell by rebel bullets pierced, His life work grandly, nobly o'er. Our boat was rescued from the sands And launched in safety on the tide; But he our comrade good and grand, In our defence had bravely died. BURIAL OF SARAH He stood before the sons of Heth, And bowed his sorrowing head; âI've come,â he said, âto buy a place Where I may lay my dead. âI am a stranger in your land, My home has lost its light; Grant me a place where I may lay My dead away from sight.â Then tenderly the sons of Heth Gazed on the mourner's face, And said, âOh, Prince, amid our dead, Choose thou her resting-place. âThe sepulchres of those we love, We place at thy command; Against the plea thy grief hath made We close not heart nor hand.â The patriarch rose and bowed his head, And said, âOne place I crave; 'Tis at the end of Ephron's field, And called Machpelah's cave. âEntreat him that he sell to me For her last sleep that cave; I do not ask for her I loved The freedom of a grave.â The son of Zohar answered him, âHearken, my lord, to me; Before our sons, the field and cave I freely give to thee.â âI will not take it as a gift,â The grand old man then said; âI pray thee let me buy the place Where I may lay my dead.â And with the promise in his heart, His seed should own that land, He gave the shekels for the field He took from Ephron's hand. And saw afar the glorious day His chosen seed should tread, The soil where he in sorrow lay His loved and cherished dead. GOING EAST She came from the East a fair, young bride, With a light and bounding heart, To find in the distant West a home With her husband to make a start. He builded his cabin far away, Where the prairie flower bloomed wild; Her love made lighter all his toil, And joy and hope around him smiled. She plied her hands to life's homely tasks, And helped to build his fortunes up; While joy and grief, like bitter and sweet, Were mingled and mixed in her cup. He sowed in his fields of golden grain, All the strength of his manly prime; Nor music of bides, nor brooks, nor bees, Was as sweet as the dollar's chime. She toiled and waited through weary years For the fortune that came at length; But toil and care and hope deferred, Had stolen and wasted her strength. The cabin changed to a stately home, Rich carpets were hushing her tread; But light was fading from her eye, And the bloom from her cheek had fled. Her husband was adding field to field, And new wealth to his golden store; And little thought the shadow of death Was entering in at his door. Slower and heavier grew her step, While his gold and his gains increased; But his proud domain had not the charm Of her humble home in the East. He had no line to sound the depths Of her tears repressed and unshed; Nor dreamed 'mid plenty a human heart Could be starving, but not for bread. Within her eye was a restless light, And a yearning that never ceased, A longing to see the dear old home She had a left in the distant East. A longing to clasp her mother's hand, And nestle close to her heart, And to feel the heavy cares of life Like the sun-kissed shadows depart. The hungry heart was stilled at last; Its restless, baffled yearning ceased. A lonely man sat by the bier Of a corpse that was going East. THE HERMIT'S SACRIFICE From Rome's palaces and villas Gaily issued forth a throng; From her humbler habitations Moved a human tide along. Haughty dames and blooming maidens, Men who knew not mercy's sway, Thronged into the Coliseum On that Roman holiday. From the lonely wilds of Asia, From her jungles far away, From the distant torrid regions, Rome had gathered beasts of prey. Lions restless, roaring, rampant, Tigers with their stealthy tread, Leopards bright, and fierce, and fiery, Met in conflict wild and dread. Fierce and fearful was the carnage Of the maddened beasts of prey, As they fought and rent each other Urged by men more fierce than they. Till like muffled thunders breaking On a vast and distant shore, Fainter grew the yells of tigers, And the lions' dreadful roar. On the crimson-stained arena Lay the victims of the fight; Eyes which once had glared with anguish, Lost in death their baleful light. Then uprose the gladiators Armed for conflict unto death, Waiting for the perfect's signal, Cold and stern with bated breath. âAve Caesar, morituri, Te, sulatant,â rose the cry From the lips of men ill-fated, Doomed to suffer and to die. Then began the dreadful contest, Lives like chaff were thrown away, Rome with all her pride and power Butchered for a holiday. Eagerly the crowd were waiting, Loud the clashing sabres rang, When between the gladiators All unarmed a hermit sprang. âCease your bloodshed,â cried the hermit, âOn this carnage place your ban;â But with flashing swords they answered, âBack unto your place, old man.â From their path the gladiators Thrust the strange intruder back, Who between their hosts advancing Calmly parried their attack. All undaunted by their weapons, Stood the old heroic man; While a maddened cry of anger Through the vast assembly ran. âDown with him,â cried out the people, As with thumbs unbent they glared, Till the prefect gave the signal That his life should not be spared. Men grew wild with wrathful passion, When his fearless words were said Cruelly they fiercely showered Stones on his devoted head. Bruised and bleeding fell the hermit, Victor in that hour of strife; Gaining in his death a triumph That he could not win in life. Had he uttered on the forum Struggling thoughts within him born, Men had jeered his words as madness, But his deed they could not scorn. Not in vain had been his courage, Nor for naught his daring deed; From his grave his mangled body Did for wretched captives plead. From that hour Rome, grown more thoughtful, Ceased her sport in human gore; And into her Coliseum Gladiators came no more. SONGS FOR THE PEOPLE Let me make the songs for the people, Songs for the old and young; Songs to stir like a battle-cry Wherever they are sung. Not for the clashing of sabres, Nor carnage nor for strife; But songs to thrill the hearts of men With more abundant life. Let me make the songs for the weary, Amid life's fever and fret, Till hearts shall relax their tension, And careworn brows forget. Let me sing for little children, Before their footsteps stray, Sweet anthems of love and duty, To float o'er life's highway. I would sing for the poor and aged, When shadows dim their sight; Of the bright and restful mansions, Where there shall be no night. Our world, so worn and weary, Needs music, pure and strong, To hush the jangle and discords Of sorrow, pain, and wrong. Music to soothe all its sorrow, Till war and crime shall cease; And the hearts of men grown tender Girdle the world with peace. THEN AND NOW âBuild me a nation,â said the Lord. The distant nations heard the word, âBuild me a nation true and strong, Bar out the old world's hate and wrong;â For men had traced with blood and tears The trail of weary wasting years, And torn and bleeding martyrs trod Through fire and torture up to God. While in the hollow of his hand God hid the secret of our land, Men warred against their fiercest foes, And kingdoms fell and empires rose, Till, weary of the old world strife, Men sought for broader, freer life, And plunged into the ocean's foam To find another, better home. And, like a vision fair and bright, The new world broke upon their sight. Men grasped the prize, grew proud and strong, And cursed the land with crime and wrong. The Indian stood despoiled of lands, The Negro bound with servile hands, Oppressed through weary years of toil. His blood and tears bedewed the soil. Then God arose in dreadful wrath, And judgment streamed around his path; His hand the captive's fetters broke, His lightnings shattered every yoke. As Israel through the Red sea trod, Led by the mighty hand of God, They passed to freedom through a flood, Whose every wave and surge was blood. And slavery, with its crime and shame, Went down in wrath and blood and flame. The land was billowed o'er with graves Where men had lived and died as slaves. Four and thirty yearsâwhat change since then! Beings once chattles now are men; Over the gloom of slavery's night, Has flashed the dawn of freedom's light. To-day no mother with anguish wild Kneels and implores that her darling child Shall not be torn from her bleeding heart, With its quivering tendrils rent apart. The father may sooth his child to sleep, And watch his slumbers calm and deep. No tyrant's tread will disturb his rest Where freedom dwells as a welcome guest. His walls may be bare of pictured grace, His fireside the lowliest place; But the wife and children sheltered there Are his to defend and guard with care. Where haughty tyrants once bore rule Are ballot-box and public school. The old slave-pen of former days Gives place to fanes of prayer and praise. To-night we would bring our meed of praise To noble friends of darker days; The men and women crowned with light, The true and tried in our gloomy night. To Lundy, whose heart was early stirred To speak for freedom an earnest word; To Carrison, valiant, true and strong, Whose face was as flight against our wrong. And Phillips, the peerless, grand and brave, A tower of strength to the outcast slave. Earth has no marble too pure and white To enroll his name in golden light. Our Douglass, too, with his broken chain, Who plead our cause with his broken chain, And helped to hurl from his bloody seat The curse that writhed and died at his feet. And Governor Andrew, who, looking back, Saw none he despised, though poor and black; And Harriet Beecher, whose glowing pen Corroded the chains of fettered men. To-night with greenest laurels we'll crown North Elba's grave where sleeps John Brown, Who made the gallows an altar high, And showed how a brave old man could die. And Lincoln, our martyred President. Who returned to his God with chains he had rent. And Sumner, amid death's icy chill, Leaving to Hoar his Civil Rights Bill. And let us remember old underground, With all her passengers northward bound, The train that ran till it ceased to pay, With all her dividends given away. Nor let it be said that we have forgot The women who stood with Lucretia Mott; Nor her who to the world was known By the simple name of Lucy Stone. A tribute unto a host of others Who knew that men though black were brothers, Who battered against our nation's sin, Whose graves are thick whose rank are thin. Oh, people chastened in the fire, To nobler, grander things aspire; In the new era of your life, Bring love for hate, and peace for strife; Upon your hearts this vow record That ye will build unto the Lord A nobler future, true and grand, To strengthen, crown and bless the land. A higher freedom ye may gain Than that which comes from a riven chain; Freedom your native land to bless, With peace, and love and righteousness, As dreams that are past, a tale all told, Are the days when men were bought and sold; Now God be praised from sea to sea, Our flag floats o'er a country free. MACEO Maceo dead! a thrill of sorrow Through our hearts in sadness ran When we felt in one sad hour That the world had lost a man. He had clasped unto his bosom The sad fortunes of his landâ Held the cause for which he perished With a firm, unfaltering hand. On his lips the name of freedom Fainted with his latest breath. âCuba libreâ was his watchword Passing through the gates of death. With the light of God around us, Why this agony and strife? With the cross of Christ before us, Why this fearful waste of life? Must the pathway unto freedom Ever mark a crimson line, And the eyes of wayward mortals Always close to light divine? Must the heart of fearless valor Fail 'mid crime and cruel wrong, When the world has read of heroes Brave and earnest, true and strong? None to stay the floods of sorrow Sweeping round each war-crushed heart; Men to say to strife and carnageâ From our world henceforth depart. God of peace and God of nations, Haste! oh, haste the glorious day When the reign of our Redeemer O'er the world shall have its sway. When the swords now blood encrusted, Spears that reap the battle field, Shall be charged to higher service, Helping earth reach harvest yield. Where the widow weeps in anguish, And the orphan bows his head, Grant that peace and joy and gladness May like holy angels tread. Pity, oh, our God the sorrow Of thy world from thee astray, Lead us from the paths of madness Unto Christ the living way. Year by year the world grows weary 'Neath its weight of sin and strife, Though the hands once pierced and bleeding Offer more abundant life. May the choral song of angels Heard upon Judea's plain Sound throughout the earth the tidings Of that old and sweet refrain. Till our world, so sad and weary, Finds the balmy rest of peaceâ Peace to silence all her discordsâ Peace till war and crime shall cease. Peace to fall like gentle showers, As on parched flowers dew, Till our hearts proclaim with gladness: Lo, He maketh all things new. ONLY A WORD Only a word, a friendly word, Tender and kind and true; A fainting heart drank in the word, As flowers absorb the dew. Only a word, a faithful word, Feet that had gone astray Were pointed from the trend of death Unto the narrow way. A tender, loving, earnest word, Sown mid prayers and tears May bloom in time and fruitage Throughout eternal years. MY MOTHER'S KISS My mother's kiss, my mother's kiss, I feel its impress now; As in the bright and happy days She pressed it on my brow. You may see it is a fancied thing Within my memory fraught; To me it has a sacred placeâ The treasure house of thought. Again, I feel her fingers glide Amid my clustering hair; I see the love-light in her eyes, When all my life was fair. Again, I hear her gentle voice In warning or in love. How precious was the faith that taught My soul of things above. The music of her voice is stilled. Her lips are paled in death. As precious pearls I'll clasp her words Until my latest breath. The world had scattered round my path Honor and wealth and fame; But naught so precious as the thoughts That gather round her name. And friends have placed upon my brow The laurels of renown; But she first taught me how to wear My manhood as a crown. My hair is silvered o'er with age, I'm longing to depart; To clasp again my mother's hand, And be a child at heart. To roam with her the glory-land Where saints and angels greet; To cast our crowns with songs of love At our Redeemer's feet. A GRAIN OF SAND Do you see this grain of sand Lying loosely in my hand? Do you know to me it brought Just a simple loving thought? When one gazes night by night On the glorious stars of light, Oh how little seems the span Measured round the life of man. Oh! how fleeting are his years With their smiles and their tears; Can it be that God does care For such atoms as we are? Then outspake this grain of sand âI was fashioned by His hand. In the star lit realms of space I was made to have a place. âShould the ocean flood the world, Were its mountains 'gainst me hurled. All the force they could employ Wouldn't a single grain destroy; And if I, a thing so light, Have a place within His sight; You are linked unto his throne Cannot live nor die alone. âIn the everlasting arms Mid life's dangers and alarms Let calm trust your spirit fill; Know He's God, and then be still.â Trustingly I raised my head Hearing what the atom said; Knowing man is greater far Than the brightest sun or star. THE CROCUSES They heard the South wind sighing A murmur of the rain; And they knew that Earth was longing To see them all again. While the snow-drops still were sleeping Beneath the silent sod; They felt their new life pulsing Within the dark, cold clod. Not a daffodil nor daisy Had dared to raise its head; Not a fairhaired dandelion Peeped timid from its bed; Though a tremor of the winter Did shivering through them run; Yet they lifted up their foreheads To greet the vernal sun. And the sunbeams gave them welcome, As did the morning air And scattered o'er their simple robes Rich tints of beauty rare. Soon a host of lovely flowers From vales and woodland burst; But in all that fair procession The crocuses were first. First to weave for Earth a chaplet To crown her dear old head And to beautify the pathway Where winter still did tread. And their loved and white haired mother Smiled sweetly 'neath the tough, When she knew her faithful children Were loving her so much. THE PRESENT AGE Say not the age is hard and coldâ I think it brave and grand; When men of diverse sects and creeds Are clasping hand in hand. The Parsee from his sacred fires Beside the Christian kneels; And clearer light to Islam's eyes The word of Christ reveals. The Brahmin from his distant home Brings thoughts of ancient lore; The Bhuddist breaking bonds of caste Divides mankind no more. The meek-eyed sons of far Cathay Are welcome round the board; Not greed, nor malice drives away These children of our Lord. And Judah from whose trusted hands Came oracles divine; Now sits with those around whose hearts The light of God doth shine. Japan unbars her long sealed gates From islands far away; Her sons are lifting up their eyes To greet the coming day. The Indian child from forests wild Has learned to read and pray; The tomahawk and scalping knife From him have passed away. From centuries of servile toil The Negro finds release, And builds the fanes of prayer and praise Unto the God of Peace. England and Russia face to face With Central Asia meet; And on the far Pacific coast Chinese and natives greet. Crusaders once with sword and shield The Holy Land to save; From Moslem hands did strive to clutch The dear Redeemer's grave. A battle greater, grander far Is for the present age; A crusade for the rights of man To brighten history's page. Where labor faints and bows her head, And want consorts with crime; Or men grown faithless sadly say That evil is the time. There is the field, the vantage ground For every earnest heart; To side with justice, truth and right And act a noble part. To save from ignorance and vice The poorest, humblest child; To make our age the fairest one On which the sun has smiled; To plant the roots of coming years In mercy, love and truth; And bid our weary, saddened earth Again renew her youth. Oh! earnest hearts! toil on in hope, 'Till darkness shrinks from light; To fill the earth with peace and joy, Let youth and age unite; To stay the floods of sin and shame That sweep from shore to shore; And furl the banners strained with blood, 'Till war shall be no more. Blame not the age, nor think it full Of evil and unrest; But say of every other age, âThis one shall be the best.â The age to brighten every path By sin and sorrow trod; For loving hearts to usher in The commonwealth of God. DEDICATION POEM Dedication Poem on the reception of the annex to the home for aged colored people, from the bequest of Mr. Edward T. Parker. Outcast from her home in Syria In the lonely, dreary wild; Heavy hearted, sorrow stricken, Sat a mother and her child. There was not a voice to cheer her Not a soul to share her fate; She was weary, he was fainting, And life seemed so desolate. Far away in sunny Egypt Was lone Hagar's native land; Where the Nile in kingly bounty Scatters bread throughout the land. In the tents of princely Abram She for years had found a home; Till the stern decree of Sarah Sent her forth the wild to roam. Hour by hour she journeyed onward From the shelter of their tent Till her footsteps slowly faltered And the water all was spent; Then she veiled her face in sorrow, Feared her child would die of thirst; Till her eyes with tears so holden Saw a sparkling fountain burst. Oh! how happy was that mother, What a soothing of her pain; When she saw her child reviving, Life rejoicing through each vein. Does not life repeat this story, Tell it over day by day? Of the fountain of refreshment Ever springing by our way. Here is one by which we gather, On this bright and happy day. Just to bask beside a fountain Making gladder life's highway. Bringing unto hearts now aged Who have borne life's burdens long, Such a gift of love and mercy As deserves our sweetest song. Such a gift that even heaven May rejoice with us below, If the pure and holy angels Join us in our joy and woe. May the memory of the giver In this home where age may rest, Float like fragrance through the ages, Ever blessing, ever blest. When the gates of pearl are opened May we there this friend behold Drink with him from living fountains, Walk with him the streets of gold. When life's shattered cords of music Shall again be sweetly sung; Then our hearts with life immortal, Shall be young, forever young. A DOUBLE STANDARD Do you blame me that I loved him? If when standing all alone I cried for bread a careless world Pressed to my lips a stone. Do you blame me that I loved him, That my heart beat glad and free, When he told me in the sweetest tones He loved but only me? Can you blame me that I did not see Beneath his burning kiss The serpent's wiles, nor even hear The deadly adder hiss? Can you blame me that my heart grew cold That the tempted, tempter turned; When he was feted and caressed And I was coldly spurned? Would you blame him, when you draw from me Your dainty robes aside. If he with gilded baits should claim Your fairest as his bride? Would you blame the world if it should press On him a civic crown; And see me struggling in the depth Then harshly press me down? Crime has no sex and yet to-day I wear the brand of shame; Whilst he amid the gay and proud Still bears an honored name. Can you blame me if I've learned to think Your hate of vice a sham, When you so coldly crushed me down And then excused the man? Would you blame me if to-morrow The coroner should say, A wretched girl, outcast, forlorn, Has thrown her life away? Yes, blame me for my downward course, But oh! remember well, Within your homes you press the hand That led me down to hell. I'm glad God's ways are not our ways, He does not see as man, Within His love I know there's room For those whom others ban. I think before His great white throne, His throne of spotless light, That whited sepulchres shall wear The hue of endless night. That I who fell, and he who sinned, Shall reap as we have sown; That each the burden of his loss Must bear and bear alone. No golden weights can turn the scale Of justice in His sight; And what is wrong in woman's life In man's cannot be right. OUR HERO Onward to her destination, O'er the stream the Hannah sped, When a cry of consternation Smote and chilled our hearts with dread. Wildly leaping, madly sweeping, all relentless in their sway, Like a band of cruel demons Flames were closing 'round our way. Oh! the horror of those moments; Flames above and waves belowâ Oh! the agony of ages Crowded in one hour of woe. Fainter grew our hearts with anguish In that hour with peril rife, When we saw the pilot flying, Terror-stricken for his life. Then a man uprose before usâ We had once despised his raceâ But we saw a lofty purpose Lighting up his darkened face. While the flames were madly roaring, With a courage grand and high, Forth he rushed unto our rescue, Strong to suffer, brave to die. Helplessly the host was drifting, Death was staring in each face, When he grasped the fallen rudder, Took the pilot's vacant place. Could he save us? Would he save us? All his hope of life give o'er? Could he hold the fated vessel 'Till she reached the nearer shore? All our hopes and fears were centered 'Round his strong, unfaltering hand; If he failed us we must perish, Perish just in sight of land. Breathlessly we watched and waited While the flames were raging fast; Then our anguish changed to raptureâ We were saved, yes, saved at last. Never strains of sweetest music Brought to me more welcome sound Than the grating of that steamer When her keel had touched the ground. But our faithful martyr hero Through a fiery pathway trod, 'Till he laid his valiant spirit On the bosom of his God. Fame has never crowned a hero On the crimson fields of strife, Greater, nobler, than that pilot Yielding up for us his life. THE DYING BONDMAN Life was trembling, faintly trembling On the bondman's latest breath, And he felt the chilling pressure Of the cold, hard hand of Death. He had been an Afric chieftain, Worn his manhood as a crown; But upon the field of battle Had been fiercely stricken down. He had longed to gain his freedom, Waited, watched and hoped in vain, Till his life was slowly ebbingâ Almost broken was his chain. By his bedside stood the master, Gazing on the dying one, Knowing by the dull grey shadows That life's sands were almost run. âMaster,â said the dying bondman, âHome and friends I soon shall see; But before I reach my country, Master write that I am free; âFor the spirits of my fathers Would shrink back from me in pride, If I told them at our greeting I a slave had lived and died;â âGive to me the precious token, That my kindred dead may seeâ Master! write it, write it quickly! Master! write that I am free!â At his earnest plea the master Wrote for him the glad release, O'er his wan and wasted features Flitted one sweet smile of peace. Eagerly he grasped the writing; âI am free!â at last he said. Backward fell upon the pillow, He was free among the dead. A LITTLE CHILD SHALL LEAD THEM Only a little scrap of blue Preserved with loving care, But earth has not a brilliant hue To me more bright and fair. Strong drink, like a raging demon, Laid on my heart his hand, When my darling joined with others The Loyal Legion The Temperance Band band. But mystic angels called away My loved and precious child, And o'er life's dark and stormy way Swept waves of anguish wild. This badge of the Loyal Legion We placed upon her breast, As she lay in her little coffin Taking her last sweet rest. To wear that badge was a token She earnestly did crave, So we laid it on her bosom To wear it in the grave. Where sorrow would never reach her Nor harsh words smite her ear; Nor her eyes in death dimmed slumber Would ever shed a tear. âWhat means this badge?â said her father, Whom we had tried to save; Who said, when we told her story, âDon't put it in the grave.â We took the badge from her bosom And laid it on a chair; And men by drink deluded Knelt by that badge in prayer. And vowed in that hour of sorrow From drink they would abstain; And this little badge became the wedge Which broke their galling chain. And lifted the gloomy shadows That overspread my life, And flooding my home with gladness, Made me a happy wife. And this is why this scrap of blue Is precious in my sight; It changed my sad and gloomy home From darkness into light. THE SPARROW'S FALL Too frail to soarâa feeble thingâ It fell to earth with fluttering wing; But God, who watches over all, Beheld that little sparrow's fall. 'Twas not a bird with plumage gay, Filling the air with its morning lay; 'Twas not an eagle bold and strong, Borne on the tempest's wing along. Only a brown and weesome thing, With drooping head and listless wing; It could not drift beyond His sight Who marshals the spendid stars of night. Its dying chirp fell on His ears, Who tunes the music of the spheres, Who hears the hungry lion's call, And spreads a table for us all. Its mission of song at last is done, No more will it greet the rising sun; That tiny bird has found a rest More calm than its mother's downy breast. Oh, restless heart, learn thou to trust In God, so tender, strong and just; In whose love and mercy everywhere His humblest children have a share. If in love He numbers ev'ry hair, Whether the strands be dark or fair, Shall we not learn to calmly rest, Like children, on our Father's breast? GOD BLESS OUR NATIVE LAND God bless our native land, Land of the newly free, Oh may she ever stand For truth and liberty. God bless our native land, Where sleep our kindred dead, Let peace at thy command Above their graves be shed. God help our native land, Bring surcease to her strife, And shower from thy hand A more abundant life. God bless our native land, Her homes and children bless, Oh may she ever stand For truth and righteousness. DANDELIONS Welcome children of the Spring, In your garbs of green and gold, Lifting up your sun-crowned heads On the verdant plain and wold. As a bright and joyous troop From the breast of earth ye came Fair and lovely are your cheeks, With sun-kisses all aflame. In the dusty streets and lanes, Where the lowly children play, There as gentle friends ye smile, Making brighter life's highway. Dewdrops and the morning sun, Weave your garments fair and bright, And we welcome you to-day As the children of the light. Children of the earth and sun, We are slow to understand All the richness of the gifts Flowing from our Father's hand. Were our visions clearer far, In this sun-dimmed world of ours, Would we not more thankful be For the love that sends us flowers? Welcome, early visitants, With your sun-crowned golden hair, With your message to our hearts Of our Father's loving care. HOME, SWEET HOME Sharers of a common country, They had met in deadly strife; Men who should have been as brothers Madly sought each other's life. In the silence of the even, When the cannon's lips were dumb, Thoughts of home and all its loved ones To the soldier's heart would come. On the margin of a river, 'Mid the evening's dews and damps, Could be heard the sounds of music Rising from two hostile camps. One was singing of its section Down in Dixie, Dixie's land, And the other of the banner Waved so long from strand to strand. In the land where Dixie's ensign Floated o'er the hopeful slave, Rose the song that freedom's banner, Starry-lighted, long might wave. From the fields of strife and carnage, Gentle thoughts began to roam, And a tender strain of music Rose with words of âHome, Sweet Home.â Then the hearts of strong men melted, For amid our grief and sin Still remains that âtouch of nature,â Telling us we all are kin. In one grand but gentle chorus, Floating to the starry dome, Came the words that brought them nearer, Words that told of âHome, Sweet Home.â For a while, all strife forgotten, They were only brothers then, Joining in the sweet old chorus, Not as soldiers, but as men. Men whose hearts would flow together, Though apart their feet might roam, Found a tie they could not sever, In the mem'ry of each home. Never may the steps of carnage Shake our land from shore to shore, But may mother, home and Heaven, Be our watchwords evermore. THE BUILDING âBuild me a house,â said the Master, âBut not on the shifting sand, Mid the wreck and roar of tempests, A house that will firmly stand. âI will bring thee windows of agates, And gates of carbuncles bright, And thy fairest courts and portals Shall be filled with love and light. âThou shalt build with fadeless rubies, All fashioned around the throne, A house that shall last forever, With Christ as the cornerstone. âIt shall be a royal mansion, A fair and beautiful thing, It will be the presence-chamber Of thy Saviour, Lord and King. âThy house shall be bound with pinions To mansions of rest above, But grace shall forge all the fetters With the links and cords of love. âThou shalt be free in this mansion From sorrow and pain of heart, For the peace of God shall enter, And never again depart.â THE PURE IN HEART SHALL SEE GOD They shall see Him in the crimson flush Of morning's early light, In the drapery of sunset, Around the couch of night. When the clouds drop down their fatness, In the late and early rain, They shall see His glorious footprints On valley, hill and plain. They shall see Him when the cyclone Breathes terror through the land; They shall see Him 'mid the murmurs Of zephyrs soft and bland. They shall see Him when the lips of health, Breath vigor through each nerve, When pestilence clasps hands with death, His purposes to serve. They shall see Him when the trembling earth Is rocking to and fro; They shall see Him in the order The seasons come and go. They shall see Him when the storms of war Sweep wildly through the land; When peace descends like gentle dew They still shall see His hand. They shall see Him in the city Of gems and pearls of light, They shall see Him in his beauty, And walk with Him in white. To living founts their feet shall tend, And Christ shall be their guide, Beloved of God, their rest shall be In safety by His side. HE HAD NOT WHERE TO LAY HIS HEAD The conies had their hiding-place, The wily fox with stealthy tread A covert found, but Christ, the Lord, Had not a place to lay his head. The eagle had an eyrie home, The blithesome bird its quiet rest, But not the humblest spot on earth Was by the Son of God possessed. Princes and kings had palaces, With grandeur could adorn each tomb, For Him who came with love and life, They had no home, they gave no room. The hands whose touch sent thrills of joy Through nerves unstrung and palsied frame, The feet that travelled for our need, Were nailed unto the cross of shame. How dare I murmur at my lot, Or talk of sorrow, pain and loss, When Christ was in a manger laid, And died in anguish on the cross. That homeless one beheld beyond His lonely agonizing pain, A love outflowing from His heart, That all the wandering world would gain. GO WORK IN MY VINEYARD Go work in my vineyard, said the Lord, And gather the bruised grain; But the reapers had left the stubble bare, And I trod the soil in pain. The fields of my Lord are wide and broad, He has pastures fair and green, And vineyards that drink the golden light Which flows from the sun's bright sheen. I heard the joy of the reaper's song, As they gathered golden grain; Then wearily turned unto my task, With a lonely sense of pain. Sadly I turned from the sun's fierce glare, And sought the quiet shade, And over my dim and weary eyes Sleep's peaceful fingers strayed. I dreamed I joined with a restless throng, Eager for pleasure and gain; But ever and anon a stumbler fell, And uttered a cry of pain. But the eager crowd still hurried on, Too busy to pause or heed, When a voice rang sadly through my soul, You must staunch these wounds that bleed. My hands were weak, but I reached them out To feebler ones than mine, And over the shadows of my life Stole the light of a peace divine. Oh! then my task was a sacred thing, How precious it grew in my eyes! 'Twas mine to gather the bruised grain For the âLord of Paradise.â And when the reapers shall lay their grain On the floors of golden light, I feel that mine with its broken sheaves Shall be precious in His sight. Though thorns may often pierce my feet, And the shadows still abide, The mists will vanish before His smile, There will be light at eventide. RENEWAL OF STRENGTH The prison-house in which I live Is falling to decay, But God renews my spirit's strength, Within these walls of clay. For me a dimness slowly creeps Around earth's fairest light, But heaven grows clearer to my view, And fairer to my sight. It may be earth's sweet harmonies Are duller to my ear, But music from my Father's house Begins to float more near. Then let the pillars of my home Crumble and fall away; Lo, God's dear love within my soul Renews it day by day. JAMIE'S PUZZLE There was grief within our household Because of a vacant chair. Our mother, so loved and precious, No longer was sitting there. Our hearts grew heavy with sorrow, Our eyes with tears were blind, And little Jamie was wondering, Why we were left behind. We had told our little darling, Of the land of love and light, Of the saints all crowned with glory, And enrobed in spotless white. We said that our precious mother, Had gone to that land so fair, To dwell with beautiful angels, And to be forever there. But the child was sorely puzzled, Why dear grandmamma should go To dwell in a stranger city, When her children loved her so. But again the mystic angel Came with swift and silent tread, And our sister, Jamie's mother, Was enrolled among the dead. To us the mystery deepened, To Jamie it seemed more clear; Grandma, he said, must be lonesome, And mamma has gone to her. But the question lies unanswered In our little Jamie's mind, Why she should go to our mother, And leave her children behind; To dwell in that lovely city, From all that was dear to part, From children who loved to nestle So closely around her heart. Dear child, like you, we are puzzled, With problems that still remain; But think in the great hereafter Their meaning will all be plain. AN APPEAL TO MY COUNTRY WOMEN You can sigh o'er the sad-eyed Armenian Who weeps in her desolate home. You can mourn o'er the exile of Russia From kindred and friends doomed to roam. You can pity the men who have woven From passion and appetite chains To coil with a terrible tension Around their heartstrings and brains. You can sorrow o'er little children Disinherited from their birth, The wee waifs and toddlers neglected, Robbed of sunshine, music and mirth. For beasts you have gentle compassion; Your mercy and pity they share. For the wretched, outcast and fallen You have tenderness, love and care. But hark! from our Southland are floating Sobs of anguish, murmurs of pain, And women heart-stricken are weeping Over their tortured and their slain. On their brows the sun has left traces; Shrink not from their sorrow in scorn. When they entered the threshold of being The children of a King were born. Each comes as a guest to the table The hands of our God has outspread, To fountains that ever leap upward, To share in the soil we all tread. When we plead for the wrecked and fallen, The exile from far-distant shores, Remember that men are still wasting Life's crimson around our own doors. Have ye not, oh, my favored sisters, Just a plea, a prayer or a tear, For mothers who dwell 'neath the shadows Of agony, hatred and fear? Men may tread down the poor and lowly, May crush them in anger and hate, But surely the mills of God's justice Will grind out the grist of their fate. Oh, people sin-laden and guilty, So lusty and proud in your prime, The sharp sickles of God's retribution Will gather your harvest of crime. Weep not, oh my well-sheltered sisters, Weep not for the Negro alone, But weep for your sons who must gather The crops which their fathers have sown. Go read on the tombstones of nations Of chieftains who masterful trod, The sentence which time has engraven, That they had forgotten their God. 'Tis the judgment of God that men reap The tares which in madness they sow, Sorrow follows the footsteps of crime, And Sin is the consort of Woe. THE LOST BELLS Year after year the artist wrought With earnest, loving care, The music flooding all his soul To pour upon the air. For this no metal was too rare, He counted not the cost; Nor deemed the years in which he toiled As labor vainly lost. When morning flushed with crimson light The golden gates of day, He longed to fill the air with chimes Sweet as a matin's lay. And when the sun was sinking low Within the distant West, He gladly heard the bells he wrought Herald the hour of rest. The music of a thousand harps Could never be so dear As when those solemn chants and thrills Fell on his list'ning ear. He poured his soul into their chimes, And felt his toil repaid; He called them children of his soul, His home a'near them made. But evil days came on apace, War spread his banner wide, And from his village snatched away The artist's love and pride. At dewy morn and stilly eve The chimes no more he heard; With dull and restless agony His spirit's depths was stirred. A weary longing filled his soul, It bound him like a spell; He left his home to seek the chimesâ The chimes he loved so well. Where lofty fanes in grandeur rose, Upon his ear there fell No music like the long lost chimes Of his beloved bell. And thus he wandered year by year. Touched by the hand of time, Seeking to hear with anxious heart Each well remembered chime. And to that worn and weary heart There came a glad surcease; He heard again the dear old chimes, And smiled and uttered peace. âThe chimes! the chimes!â the old man cried, âI hear the tones at lastâ; A sudden rapture filled his heart, And all his cares were past. Yes, peace had come with death's sweet calm, His journeying was o'er, The weary, restless wanderer Had reached the restful shore. It may be that we meet again, Enfolded in the air, The dear old chimes beside the gates Where all is bright and fair; That he who crossed and bowed his head When Angelus was sung In clearer light touched golden harps By angel fingers strung. âDO NOT CHEER, MEN ARE DYING,â SAID CAPT. PHILLIPS, IN THE SPANISH-AMERICAN WAR Do not cheer, for men are dying From their distant homes in pain; And the restless sea is darkened By a flood of crimson rain. Do not cheer, for anxious mothers Wait and watch in lonely dread; Vainly waiting for the footsteps Never more their paths to tread. Do not cheer, while little children Gather round the widowed wife, Wondering why an unknown people Sought their own dear father's life. Do not cheer, for aged fathers Bend above their stoves and weep, While the ocean sings the requiem Where their fallen children sleep. Do not cheer, for lips are paling On which lay the mother's kiss; 'Mid the dreadful roar of battle How that mother's hand they miss! Do not cheer, once joyous maidens, Who the mazy dance did tread, Bow their heads in bitter anguish, Mourning o'er their cherished dead. Do not cheer while maid and matron In this strife must bear a part; While the blow that strikes a soldier Reaches to some woman's heart. Do not cheer till arbitration O'er the nations holds its sway, And the century now closing Ushers in a brighter day. Do not cheer until each nation Sheathes the sword and blunts the spear, And we sing aloud for gladness; Lo, the reign of Christ is here. And the banners of destruction From the battlefield are furled, And the peace of God descending Rests upon a restless world. THE BURDENS OF ALL We may sigh o'er the heavy burdens Of the black, the brown and white; But if we all clasped hands together The burdens would be more light. How to solve life's saddest problems, Its weariness, want and woe, Was answered by One who suffered In Palestine long ago. He gave from his heart this precept, To ease the burdens of men, âAs ye would that others do to you Do ye even so to them.â Life's heavy, wearisome burdens Will change to a gracious trust When men shall learn in the light of God To be merciful and just. Where war has sharpened his weapons, And slavery masterful had, Let white and black and brown unite To build the kingdom of God. And never attempt in madness To build a kingdom or state, Through greed of gold or lust of power, On the crumbling stones of hate. The burdens will always be heavy, The sunshine fade into night, Till mercy and justice shall cement The black, the brown and the white. And earth shall answer with gladness, The herald angel's refrain, When âPeace on earth, good will to menâ Was the burden of their strain. A FAIRER HOPE, A BRIGHTER MORN From the peaceful heights of a higher life I heard your maddening cry of strife; It quivered with anguish, wrath and pain, Like a demon struggling with his chain. A chain of evil, heavy and strong, Rusted with ages of fearful wrong, Encrusted with blood and burning tears, The chain I had worn and dragged for years. It clasped my limbs, but it bound your heart, And formed of your life a fearful part; You sowed the wind, but could not control The tempest wild of a guilty soul. You saw me stand with my broken chain Forged in the furnace of fiery pain, You saw my children around me stand Lovingly clasping my unbound hand. But you remembered my blood and tears 'Mid the weary wasting flight of years, You thought of the rice swamps, lone and dank, When my heart in hopeless anguish sank. You thought of your fields with harvest white, Where I toiled in pain from morn till night; You thought of the days you bought and sold The children I loved, for paltry gold. You thought of our shrieks that rent the airâ Our mourns of anguish and deep despair; With chattering teeth and paling face, You thought of your nation's deep disgrace. You wove from your fears a fearful fate To spring from your seeds of scorn and hate; You imagined the saddest, wildest thing, That time, with revenges fierce, could bring. The cry you thought from a Voodo breast Was the echo of your soul's unrest; When thoughts too sad for fruitless tears Loomed like the ghosts of avenging years. Oh prophet of evil, could not your voice In our new hopes and freedom rejoice? 'Mid the light which streams around our way Was there naught to see but an evil day? Nothing but vengeance, wrath and hate, And the serpent coils of an evil fateâ A fate that shall crush and drag you down; A doom that shall press like an iron crown? A fate that shall crisp and curl your hair And darken your faces now as fair, And send through your veins like a poisoned flood The hated stream of the Negro's blood? A fate to madden the heart and brain You've peopled with phantoms of dread and pain, And fancies wild of your daughter's shriek With Congo kisses upon her cheek? Beyond the mist of your gloomy fears, I see the promise of brighter years, Through the dark I see their golden hem And my heart gives out its glad amen. The banner of Christ was your sacred trust, But you trailed that banner in the dust, And mockingly told us amid our pain The hand of your God had forged our chain. We stumbled and groped through the dreary night Till our fingers touched God's robe of light; And we knew he heard, from his lofty throne, Our saddest cries and faintest moan. The cross you have covered with sin and shame We'll bear aloft in Christ's holy name. Oh, never again may its folds be furled While sorrow and sin enshroud our world! God, to whose fingers thrills each heart beat, Has not sent us to walk with aimless feet, To cower and couch with bated breath From margins of life to shores of death. Higher and better than hate for hate, Like the scorpion fangs that desolate, Is the hope of a brighter, fairer morn And a peace and love that shall yet be born; When the Negro shall hold an honored place, The friend and helper of every race; His mission to build and not destroy, And gladden the world with love and joy. BE ACTIVE Onward, onward, sons of freedom, In the great and glorious strife; You've a high and holy mission On the battle field of life. See oppression's feet of iron Grinds a brother to the ground, And from bleeding heart and bosom Gapeth many a fearful wound. Sit not down with idle pity Gazing on his mighty wrong, Hurl the bloated tyrant from him Say, my brother, oh be strong! See that sad despairing mother Clasp her burning brow in pain, Lay your hands upon her fetters Rend, oh! rend, her galling chain! Here's a pale and trembling maiden, Brutal arms around her thrown, Christian father, save oh! save her By the love you bear your own! Yearly lay a hundred thousand Newborn babes on Moloch's shrine, Crush these gory reeking altars; Christian, let this work be thine. Where the southern roses blossom, Weary lives go out in pain, Dragging to death's shadowy portals Slavery's heavy galling chain. Men of every clime and nation, Every faith, and sect, and creed, Lay aside your idle jangling, Come and staunch the wounds that bleed. On my people's blighted bosom Mountain weights of sorrow lay, Stop not now to ask the question Who shall roll the stone away. Set at work the moral forces That are yours of church and state, Teach them how to war and battle 'Gainst oppression, wrong, and hate. Oh! be faithful! O, be valiant! Trusting not in human might, Know that in the darkest conflict God is on the side of right. âBEHOLD THE LILIES!â Behold the lilies of the field How beautiful and fair; Their fragrance as a breath of heaven Refreshes all the air. No sordid labors bow them down, Nor dull depressing care; They only tell of God's great love, And that is everywhere. The wings of morning are too slow To bear us from His sight; The midnight has no shadows deep To hide from us His light. If not a sparrow falls to earth Unnoticed by His eye, Will He, our Father and our Friend Unheeded pass us by? Shall we not learn from fading flowersâ Frail children of the dustâ To lay our cares before His throne, And in his mercy trust? There's not a care that weights us down, No blinding tears that fall, Nor sorrow piercing to the heart But he beholds them all; And offers us with tender love, Mid dangers and alarms, A refuge for our souls within His everlasting arms. TO BISHOP PAYNE Written for the special celebration of the fortieth anniversary of Daniel A. Payne as bishop of the A. M. E. Church, 1892. The prison house in which you dwell, Is falling to decay. May God renew thy spirit's youth, Within those walls of clay. And while a dimness slowly creeps Around Earth's fairest light, May heaven grow clearer to your view, And fairer to thy sight. And when Earth's sweetest harmonies Grow duller to your ear, May music from your father's house Begin to float more near. Then let the pillars of your home Crumble and fall away. So God's dear love within thy soul Renews it day by day. Until life's toil and pain are o'er, Its sorrow and its night. And on thy raptured gaze shall burst The beatific sight. With saints redeemed and martyrs crowned, And loved ones mayest thou meet; And rest with them thy crown of life, At our Redeemer's feet. âGONE TO GODâ Finished now the weary throbbing, Of a bosom calmed to rest; Laid aside the heavy sorrows, That for years upon it prest. All the thirst for pure affection, All the hunger of the heart; All the vain and tearful cryings, All forever now depart. Clasp the pale and faded fingers, O'er the cold and lifeless form; They shall never shrink and shiver, Homeless in the dark and storm. Press the death-weights calmly, gently, O'er the eyelids in their sleep; Tears shall never tremble from them, They shall never wake to weep. Close the silent lips together, Lips once parted with a sigh; Through their sealed, moveless portals, Ne'er shall float a bitter cry. Bring no bright and blooming flowers, Let no mournful tears be shed, Funeral flowers, tears of sorrow, They are for the cherished dead. She has been a lonely wanderer, Drifting on the world's highway; Grasping with her woman's nature, Feeble reeds to be her stay. God is witness to the anguish, Of a heart that's all alone; Floating blindly on life's current, Only bound unto His throne. But o'er such, Death's solemn angel, Broodeth with a sheltering wing; Till the hopeless hand's grown weary, Cease around earth's toys to cling. Then kind hands will clasp them gently, On the still, unaching breast; Softly treading by, they'll whisper, Of the lone one gone to rest. IN COMMEMORATION OF THE CENTENNIAL OF THE A. M. E. CHURCH A little seed in weakness sown, Fell in the desert dustâ In Allen's hand that seed became A sacred, precious trust. Around it swept the arid airs Of prejudice and hate, And heaven's bright dew upon it fell, And God watched o'er its fate. And Faith and Sacrifice, like rain, Fell softly at its base, Until amid the elder trees, A scion took its place. Now where the broad Atlantic breaks In sprays of crested foam Or, sobbing near our sunset mounts, Is heard Pacific's moanâ From shore to shore its branches spread From snow-clad hills of Maine To where, against our coral reefs, The wild waves dash in vain. Its roots have run beyond the sea To Hayti's sunny strand, And spread its branches far away In Africa's distant land. May every fruit of God's rich grace This tree for men afford, And flourish 'mid the vales of life A planting of the Lord. Beneath its shade may weary hearts Find shelter, love and rest, And with a glad surrender make Our earth more bright and blest. May He who prunes and bears away The branch He cannot own Help this to be a fruitful tree To plant around His throne. LESSONS OF THE STREET Walking through life's dusty highways, Mid the tramp of hurrying feet, We may gather such instruction, From the lessons âof the streetâ. Now a beggar sues for succorâ Nay, repress that look of pride! 'Neath that wrecked and shattered body Doth a human soul reside. Here's a brow that seems to tell you, âI am prematurely old; I have spent my youthful vigor In an eager search for goldâ. On the cheek of yon pale student Is a divorcement most unkindâ 'Tis the cruel separation Of his body from his mind. Here a painted child of shame Flaunts in costly robes of sin, With a reckless mirth that cannot Hide the smoldering fires within. And here's a face so calm and mild, Mid the restless din and strife; It seems to say in every line, âI'm aiming for a higher lifeâ. Just then I caught a mournful glance, As on the human river rushed, A harrowing look which plainly said, âThe music of my life is hushedâ. Look on that face, so deathly pale, Its bloom and flush forever fled; I started, for it seemed to bear A message to the silent dead. Thus hurries on the stream of life, To empty where Death's waters meet; We pass along, we pass awayâ Thus end the lessons of the street. A POEM Composed for the reception tendered the Reverend Henry L. Phillips and wife in celebration of their return from West Indies in 1902 and of his twenty-five years of service as rector of the Church of the Crucifixion, Philadelphia. Over the foaming ocean, Over the restless sea; Back to thy field of labor, We are waiting to welcome thee. Back from the land of flowers, Kissed by the ardent sun; With thy brightest, gladdest welcome, Thy people here are come. In the long, long Lenten season, Ere thy journeyings were o'er; We will not forget the lessons, Taught us by our Brother More. In the work thou placed before, He has laid his earnest heart; So tonight within thy welcome He must surely take a part. Youth and maiden here will greet thee, Who were not confirmed before; Greet thee here tonight as pastor, By the work of Brother More. With the consort of thy bosom, As down the stream of life ye glide; May the love of God surround you With His light at eventide. In the years of early manhood, On thy brow the dews of youth, Thou gaves't to a needed people Many words of love and truth. Now we welcome thee, dear Father, As one who points the way Amid earth's pomps and vanities To Heaven's brighter day. May rich and copious blessing Upon thy life descend, As we greet thee with a welcome, Our Father and our friend. Where sin clasps hand with sorrow, May we thy flock be found; As followers of the Master, Who in his love abound. To strive by high endeavor To make the world more bright; To change life's dull and rugged paths, To lines of living light. With hearts of glad surrender, Not seeking wealth or fame; O Guide and Shepherd teach us To live in Jesus' name. With peace and joy and comfort, May all thy life be blessed; And angels welcome thee at last Within the gates of rest. With all the saints and martyrs, Who tried with pain and might; With bleeding feet the thorny paths, Now luminous with light. Like a holy Benediction, Thy presence may it be; Till in the Holy City Thy flock shall welcome thee. THE SOUL Bring forth the balance, let the weight be gold! We'd know the worth of a deathless soul; Bring rubies and gems from every mine, With the wealth of ocean, land and clime. Bring the joys of the green, green earth, Its playful smiles and careless mirth; The dews of youth and flushes of healthâ Bring! Oh, bring! the wide world's wealth. Bring the rich, rare pearls of thought From the depths of knowledge brought, All that human ken may know, Searching earth and heaven o'er. Bring the fairest rolls of fameâ Rolls unwritten with a deed of shame; Honor's guerdon, victory's crown, Robes of pride, wreaths of renown. We've brought the wealth of ev'ry mine, We've ransacked ocean, land and clime, And caught the joyous smiles away, From the prattling babe to the sire gray. We've wrought the names of the noble dead, With those who in their footsteps tread, Here are wreaths of pride and gems of thought, From the battle-field and study brought. Heap high the gems, pile up the gold, For heavy's the weight of a deathless soulâ Make room for all the wealth of earth, Its honors, joys, and careless mirth. Leave me a niche for the rolls of fameâ Oh, precious, indeed, is a spotless name, For the robes, the wreaths, and gems of thought, Let an empty space in the scales be sought. With care we've adjusted balance and scale, Futile our efforts we've seen them fail; Lighter than dust is the wealth of the earth, Weighted in the scales with immortal worth. Could we drag the sun from his golden car, To lay in this balance with ev'ry star, 'Twould darken the day and obscure the nightâ But the weight of the balance would still be light. TO THE UNION SAVERS OF CLEVELAND Men of Cleveland, had a vulture Sought a timid dove for prey, Would you not, with human pity, Drive the gory bird away? Had you seen a feeble lambkin, Shrinking from a wolf so bold, Would ye not to shield the trembler, In your arms have made its fold? But when she, a hunted sister, Stretched her hands that ye might save, Colder far than Zembla's regions Was the answer that ye gave. On the Union's bloody altar, Was your hapless victim laid; Mercy, truth and justice shuddered, But your hands would give no aid. And ye sent her back to torture, Robbed of freedom and of right. Thrust the wretched, captive stranger, Back to slavery's gloomy night. Back where brutal men may trample, On her honor and her fame; And unto her lips so dusky, Press the cup of woe and shame. There is blood upon your city, Dark and dismal is the strain; And your hands would fail to cleanse it, Though Lake Erie ye should drain. There's a curse upon your Union, Fearful sounds are in the air; As if thunderbolts were framing Answers to the bondsman's prayer. Ye may offer human victims, Like the heathen priests of old; And may barter manly honor For the Union and for gold. But ye can not stay the whirlwind, When the storm begins to break; And your God doth rise in judgment, For the poor and needy's sake. And, your sin-cursed, guilty Union Shall be shaken to its base, Till ye learn that simple justice, Is the right of every race. THE VISION OF THE CZAR OF RUSSIA To the Czar of all the Russians Came a vision bright and fair, The joy of unburdened millions, Floating gladly on the air. The laughter and songs of children, Of maidens, so gay and bright, Of mothers who never would tremble, Where warfare and carnage blight. Instead of the tramp of armies, Was patter of little feet; The blare of bugles and trumpets, Had melted in music sweet. The harvests had ceased to ripen, On fields that were drenched with blood; The seas no more were ensanguined With an awful crimson flood. The peaceful pavements no longer Re-echoed the martial tread; And over the ransomed nations The banner of love was spread. The streams tripped lightly seaward, Unfreighted with human gore; The valleys and hills were brightened, And shuddered with strife no more. There were homes where peace and plenty Around happy hearths did smile; And the touch of baby fingers, Could sorrow and care beguile. The cannon had ceased its bristling, Its mission of death was o'er; And the world so weary of carnage, Learned the art of war was no more. And Earth, once so sorrow laden, Grew daily more fair and bright; Till peace our globe had unfolded, And millions walked in its light. 'Twas a bright and beautiful vision, Of nations disarmed and free; As to heaven across the chorus Of the world's first jubilee. How long shall the vision tarry? How long shall the hours delay, Till war shrinks our saddened Earth, As the darkness shrinks from day? Till barracks shall change to churches, The prison become a school; And over the hearts and homes of men, The peace of our God shall rule? And Earth, like a barque, storm riven, The sport of tempest and tide; Shall find rest and a haven The heart of the Crucified. FOR THE TWENTY-FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE HOME FOR AGED AND INFIRM COLORED PERSONS We come, but not to celebrate Amid the flight and whirl of years, The deeds of heroes, on whose brows Are laurels, drenched with blood and tears. Nor yet to tell of wondrous deeds Performed on fields of bloodless strife; But of the lonely precious things, That bless and beautify our life. And from the annals of the poor We would unfold a shining page; And tell of kindly hands that smoothed The rugged path of faltering age. To shelter those who long have borne Life's chilling storms and searching heat, In restful homes, with love alight What charity more pure and sweet? But not beneath this spacious Home Was laid the first foundation stone, But in the hearts that learned to feel For woman stricken, old and lone. To Hall and Truman, Still and Laing Was given power to aid and bless; And, faithful to her sacred charge, Constant, and helping, stood Ann Jess. May Sarah Pennock, whose kind hand Has often brought the âHomeâ relief Feel life replete with God's great peace; Find light in darkness, joy in grief. Custodian of the Generous purse May Israel Johnson long remainâ And reach at last the happy land, Where faithful service meets its gain. And join again departed forms Of wife and sister passed before; Who gave their treasure to the Lord, By generous gifts unto His poor. And some who met with us erewhile, Have passed unto the other side; Like precious fragrance, may their deeds Within our heart of hearts abide. Year after year, within these walls, Did Dillwyn Parrish faithful stand; Til He âWho gives his loved ones sleepâ Released, in death, his helpful hand. Of those who scattered flowers fair Around the verge of parting life, We would record with grateful words, The names of Stephen Smith and wife. Whose hands, enriched with golden store, Gave of their wealth to build this âHome,â And changed a narrow domicile Into a grand and stately dome. Oh! When our earthly homes shall fail And vanish from our fading sight May friends and patrons meet again In God's fair halls of love and light. Where homeless ones shall never weep, Nor weary aged wanderers roam; But walk amid the golden streets Secure within our Father's home.</field>
