      <field name="fulltext">POEMS AND TWO MEN OF SANDY BAR A Drama I. NATIONAL JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG Have you heard the story that gossips tell Of Burns of Gettysburg?âNo? Ah, well: Brief is the glory that hero earns, Briefer the story of poor John Burns. He was the fellow who won renown,â The only man who did n't back down When the rebels rode through his native town; But held his own in the fight next day, When all his townsfolk ran away. That was in July sixty-three, The very day that General Lee, Flower of Southern chivalry, Baffled and beaten, backward reeled From a stubborn Meade and a barren field. I might tell how but the day before John Burns stood at his cottage door, Looking down the village street, Where, in the shade of his peaceful vine, He heard the low of his gathered kine, And felt their breath with incense sweet; Or I might say, when the sunset burned The old farm gable, he thought it turned The milk that fell like a babbling flood Into the milk-pail red as blood! Or how he fancied the hum of bees Were bullets buzzing among the trees. But all such fanciful thoughts as these Were strange to a practical man like Burns, Who minded only his own concerns, Troubled no more by fancies fine Than one of his calm-eyed, long-tailed kine,â Quite old-fashioned and matter-of-fact, Slow to argue, but quick to act. That was the reason, as some folk say, He fought so well on that terrible day. And it was terrible. On the right Raged for hours the heady fight, Thundered the battery's double bass,â Difficult music for men to face; While on the leftâwhere now the graves Undulate like the living waves That all that day unceasing swept Up to the pits the rebels keptâ Round shot ploughed the upland glades, Sown with bullets, reaped with blades; Shattered fences here and there Tossed their splinters in the air; The very trees were stripped and bare; The barns that once held yellow grain Were heaped with harvests of the slain; The cattle bellowed on the plain, The turkeys screamed with might and main, And brooding barn-fowl left their rest With strange shells bursting in each nest. Just where the tide of battle turns, Erect and lonely stood old John Burns. How do you think the man was dressed? He wore an ancient long buff vest, Yellow as saffron,âbut his best; And buttoned over his manly breast Was a bright blue coat, with a rolling collar, And large gilt buttons,âsize of a dollar,â With tails that the country-folk called âswaller.â He wore a broad-brimmed, bell-crowned hat, White as the locks on which it sat. Never had such a sight been seen For forty years on the village green, Since old John Burns was a country beau, And went to the âquiltingsâ long ago. Close at his elbows all that day, Veterans of the Peninsula, Sunburnt and bearded, charged away; And striplings, downy of lip and chin,â Clerks that the Home Guard mustered in,â Glanced, as they passed, at the hat he wore, Then at the rifle his right hand bore, And hailed him, from out their youthful lore. With scraps of a slangy rÃ©pertoire: âHow are you, White Hat?â âPut her through!â âYour head's level!â and âBully for you!â Called him âDaddy,ââbegged he 'd disclose The name of the tailor who made his clothes, And what was the value he set on those; While Burns, unmindful of jeer and scoff, Stood there picking the rebels off,â With his long brown rifle and bell-crown hat, And the swallow-tails they were laughing at. 'T was but a moment, for that respect Which clothes all courage their voices checked; And something the wildest could understand Spake in the old man's strong right hand, And his corded throat, and the lurking frown Of his eyebrows under his old bell-crown; Until, as they gazed, there crept an awe Through the ranks in whispers, and some men saw, In the antique vestments and long white hair, The Past of the Nation in battle there; And some of the soldiers since declare That the gleam of his old white hat afar, Like the crested plume of the brave Navarre, That day was their oriflamme of war. So raged the battle. You know the rest: How the rebels, beaten and backward pressed, Broke at the final charge and ran. At which John Burnsâa practical manâ Shouldered his rifle, unbent his brows, And then went back to his bees and cows. That is the story of old John Burns; This is the moral the reader learns: In fighting the battle, the question's whether You'll show a hat that's white, or a feather! âHOW ARE YOU, SANITARY?â Down the picket-guarded lane Rolled the comfort-laden wain, Cheered by shouts that shook the plain, Soldier-like and merry: Phrases such as camps may teach, Sabre-cuts of Saxon speech, Such as âBullyâ âThem's the peach!â âWade in, Sanitary!â Right and left the caissons drew As the car went lumbering through, Quick succeeding in review Squadrons military; Sunburnt men with beards like frieze, Smooth-faced boys, and cries like these,â âU. S. San. Com.â âThat's the cheese!â âPass in, Sanitary!â In such cheer it struggled on Till the battle front was won: Then the car, its journey done, Lo! was stationary; And where bullets whistling fly Came the sadder, fainter cry, âHelp us, brothers, ere we die,â Save us, Sanitary!â Such the work. The phantom flies, Wrapped in battle clouds that rise; But the braveâwhose dying eyes, Veiled and visionary, See the jasper gates swung wide, See the parted throng outsideâ Hears the voice to those who ride: âPass in, Sanitary!â BATTLE BUNNY (MALVERN HILL, 1864) âAfter the men were ordered to lie down, a white rabbit, which had been hopping hither and thither over the field swept by grape and musketry, took refuge among the skirmishers, in the breast of a corporal.ââ Report of the Battle of Malvern Hill. Bunny, lying in the grass, Saw the shining column pass; Saw the starry banner fly, Saw the chargers fret and fume, Saw the flapping hat and plume,â Saw them with his moist and shy Most unspeculative eye, Thinking only, in the dew, That it was a fine review. Till a flash, not all of steel, Where the rolling caissons wheel, Brought a rumble and a roar Rolling down that velvet floor, And like blows of autumn flail Sharply threshed the iron hail. Bunny, thrilled by unknown fears, Raised his soft and pointed ears, Mumbled his prehensile lip, Quivered his pulsating hip, As the sharp vindictive yell Rose above the screaming shell; Thought the world and all its men,â All the charging squadrons meant,â All were rabbit-hunters then, All to capture him intent. Bunny was not much to blame: Wiser folk have thought the same,â Wiser folk who think they spy Every ill begins with âI.â Wildly panting here and there. Bunny sought the freer air, Till he hopped below the hill, And saw, lying close and still, Men with muskets in their hands. (Never Bunny understands That hypocrisy of sleep, In the vigils grim they keep, As recumbent on that spot They elude the level shot.) Oneâa grave and quiet man, Thinking of his wife and child Far beyond the Rapidan, Where the Androscoggin smiledâ Felt the little rabbit creep, Nestling by his arm and side, Wakened from strategic sleep, To that soft appeal replied, Drew him to his blackened breast, AndâBut you have guessed the rest. Softly o'er that chosen pair Omnipresent Love and Care Drew a mightier Hand and Arm, Shielding them from every harm; Right and left the bullets waved, Saved the saviour for the saved. Who believes that equal grace God extends in every place, Little difference he scans 'Twixt a rabbit's God and man's. THE REVEILLE Hark! I hear the tramp of thousands, And of armÃ¨d men the hum; Lo! a nation's hosts have gathered Round the quick alarming drum,â Saying, âCome, Freemen, come! Ere your heritage be wasted,â said the quick alarming drum. âLet me of my heart take counsel: War is not of life the sum; Who shall stay and reap the harvest When the autumn days shall come?â But the drum Echoed, âCome! Death shall reap the braver harvest,â said the solemn-sounding drum. âBut when won the coming battle, What of profit springs therefrom? What if conquest, subjugation, Even greater ills become?â But the drum Answered, âCome! You must do the sum to prove it,â said the Yankee answering drum. âWhat if, 'mid the cannons' thunder, Whistling shot and bursting bomb, When my brothers fall around me, Should my heart grow cold and numb?â But the drum Answered, âCome! Better there in death united, than in life a recreant.âCome!â Thus they answered,âhoping, fearing, Some in faith, and doubting some, Till a trumpet-voice proclaiming, Said, âMy chosen people, come!â Then the drum, Lo! was dumb, For the great heart of the nation, throbbing, answered, âLord, we come!â OUR PRIVILEGE Not ours, where battle smoke upcurls, And battle dews lie wet, To meet the charge that treason hurls By sword and bayonet. Not ours to guide the fatal scythe The fleshless Reaper wields; The harvest moon looks calmly down Upon our peaceful fields. The long grass dimples on the hill, The pines sing by the sea, And Plenty, from her golden horn, Is pouring far and free. O brothers by the farther sea! Think still our faith is warm; The same bright flag above us waves That swathed our baby form. The same red blood that dyes your fields Here throbs in patriot pride,â The blood that flowed when Lander fell, And Baker's crimson tide. And thus apart our hearts keep time With every pulse ye feel, And Mercy's ringing gold shall chime With Valor's clashing steel. RELIEVING GUARD THOMAS STARR KING. OBIIT MARCH 4, 1864 Came the relief. âWhat, sentry, ho! How passed the night through thy long waking?â âCold, cheerless, dark,âas may befit The hour before the dawn is breaking.â âNo sight? no sound?â âNo; nothing save The plover from the marshes calling, And in yon western sky, about An hour ago, a star was falling.â âA star? There's nothing strange in that.â âNo, nothing; but, above the thicket, Somehow it seemed to me that God Somewhere had just relieved a picket.â THE GODDESS CONTRIBUTED TO THE FAIR FOR THE LADIES' PATRIOTIC FUND OF THE PACIFIC âWho comes?â The sentry's warning cry Rings sharply on the evening air: Who comes? The challenge: no reply, Yet something motions there. A woman, by those graceful folds; A soldier, by that martial tread: âAdvance three paces. Halt! until Thy name and rank be said.â âMy name? Her name, in ancient song, Who fearless from Olympus came: Look on me! Mortals know me best In battle and in flame.â âEnough! I know that clarion voice; I know that gleaming eye and helm, Those crimson lips,âand in their dew The best blood of the realm.â âThe young, the brave, the good and wise, Have fallen in thy curst embrace: The juices of the grapes of wrath Still stain thy guilty face. âMy brother lies in yonder field, Face downward to the quiet grass: Go back! he cannot see thee now; But here thou shalt not pass.â A crack upon the evening air, A wakened echo from the hill: The watchdog on the distant shore Gives mouth, and all is still. The sentry with his brother lies Face downward on the quiet grass; And by him, in the pale moonshine, A shadow seems to pass. No lance or warlike shield it bears: A helmet in its pitying hands Brings water from the nearest brook, To meet his last demands. Can this be she of haughty mien, The goddess of the sword and shield? Ah, yes! The Grecian poet's myth Sways still each battlefield. For not alone that rugged War Some grace or charm from Beauty gains; But, when the goddess' work is done, The woman's still remains. ON A PEN OF THOMAS STARR KING This is the reed the dead musician dropped, With tuneful magic in its sheath still hidden; The prompt allegro of its music stopped, Its melodies unbidden. But who shall finish the unfinished strain, Or wake the instrument to awe and wonder, And bid the slender barrel breathe again, An organ-pipe of thunder! His pen! what humbler memories cling about Its golden curves! what shapes and laughing graces Slipped from its point, when his full heart went out In smiles and courtly phrases? The truth, half jesting, half in earnest flung; The word of cheer, with recognition in it; The note of alms, whose golden speech outrung The golden gift within it. But all in vain the enchanter's wand we wave: No stroke of ours recalls his magic vision: The incantation that its power gave Sleeps with the dead magician. A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY I read last night of the grand review In Washington's chiefest avenue,â Two hundred thousand men in blue, I think they said was the number,â Till I seemed to hear their trampling feet, The bugle blast and the drum's quick beat, The clatter of hoofs in the stony street, The cheers of people who came to greet, And the thousand details that to repeat Would only my verse encumber,â Till I fell in a reverie, sad and sweet, And then to a fitful slumber. When, lo! in a vision I seemed to stand In the lonely Capitol. On each hand Far stretched the portico, dim and grand Its columns ranged like a martial band Of sheeted spectres, whom some command Had called to a last reviewing. And the streets of the city were white and bare; No footfall echoed across the square; But out of the misty midnight air I heard in the distance a trumpet blare, And the wandering night-winds seemed to bear The sound of a far tattooing. Then I held my breath with fear and dread; For into the square, with a brazen tread, There rode a figure whose stately head O'erlooked the review that morning, That never bowed from its firm-set seat When the living column passed its feet, Yet now rode steadily up the street To the phantom bugle's warning: Till it reached the Capitol square, and wheeled, And there in the moonlight stood revealed A well-known form that in State and field Had led our patriot sires: Whose face was turned to the sleeping camp, Afar through the river's fog and damp, That showed no flicker, nor waning damp, Nor wasted bivouac fires. And I saw a phantom army come, With never a sound of fife or drum, But keeping time to a throbbing hum Of wailing and lamentation: The martyred heroes of Malvern Hill, Of Gettysburg and Chancellorsville, The men whose wasted figures fill The patriot graves of the nation. And there came the nameless dead,âthe men Who perished in fever swamp and fen, The slowly-starved of the prison pen; And, marching beside the others, Came the dusky martyrs of Pillow's fight, With limbs enfranchised and bearing bright; I thoughtâperhaps 't was the pale moonlightâ They looked as white as their brothers! And so all night marched the nation's dead, With never a banner above them spread, Nor a badge, nor a motto brandishÃ¨d; No markâsave the bare uncovered head Of the silent bronze Reviewer; With never an arch save the vaulted sky; With never a flower save those that lie On the distant gravesâfor love could buy No gift that was purer or truer. So all night long swept the strange array, So all night long till the morning gray I watched for one who had passed away; With a reverent awe and wonder,â Till a blue cap waved in the length'ning line, And I knew that one who was kin of mine Had come; and I spakeâand lo! that sign Awakened me from my slumber. THE COPPERHEAD (1864) There is peace in the swamp where the Copperhead sleeps, Where the waters are stagnant, the white vapor creeps, Where the musk of Magnolia hangs thick in the air, And the lilies' phylacteries broaden in prayer. There is peace in the swamp, though the quiet is death, Though the mist is miasma, the upas-tree's breath, Though no echo awakes to the cooing of doves,â There is peace: yes, the peace that the Copperhead loves. Go seek him: he coils in the ooze and the drip, Like a thong idly flung from the slave-driver's whip; But beware the false footstep,âthe stumble that brings A deadlier lash than the overseer swings. Never arrow so true, never bullet so dread, As the straight steady stroke of that hammer-shaped head; Whether slave or proud planter, who braves that dull crest Woe to him who shall trouble the Copperhead's rest! Then why waste your labors, brave hearts and strong men. In tracking a trail to the Copperhead's den? Lay your axe to the cypress, hew open the shade To the free sky and sunshine Jehovah has made; Let the breeze of the North sweep the vapors away, Till the stagnant lake ripples, the freed waters play; And then to your heel can you righteously doom The Copperhead born of its shadow and gloom! A SANITARY MESSAGE Last night, above the whistling wind, I heard the welcome rain,â A fusillade upon the roof, A tattoo on the pane: The keyhole piped; the chimney-top A warlike trumpet blew; Yet, mingling with these sounds of strife, A softer voice stole through. âGive thanks, O brothers!â said the voice, âThat He who sent the rains Hath spared your fields the scarlet dew That drips from patriot veins: I've seen the grass on Eastern graves In brighter verdure rise; But, oh! the rain that gave it life Sprang first from human eyes. âI come to wash away no stain Upon your wasted lea; I raise no banners, save the ones The forest waves to me: Upon the mountain side, where Spring Her farthest picket sets, My reveille awakes a host Of grassy bayonets. âI visit every humble roof; I mingle with the low: Only upon the highest peaks My blessings fall in snow; Until, in tricklings of the stream And drainings of the lea, My unspent bounty comes at last To mingle with the sea.â And thus all night, above the wind, I heard the welcome rain,â A fusillade upon the roof, A tattoo on the pane: The keyhole piped; the chimney-top A warlike trumpet blew; But, mingling with these sounds of strife, This hymn of peace stole through. THE OLD MAJOR EXPLAINS (RE-UNION, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, 12TH MAY, 1871) Well, you see, the fact is, Colonel, I don't know as I can come: For the farm is not half planted, and there's work to do at home; And my leg is getting troublesome,âit laid me up last fall,â And the doctors, they have cut and hacked, and never found the ball. And then, for an old man like me, it's not exactly right, This kind o' playing soldier with no enemy in sight. âThe Union,ââthat was well enough way up to '66; But this âRe-Union,â maybe now it's mixed with politics? No? Well, you understand it best; but then, you see, my lad, I'm deacon now, and some might think that the example's bad. And week from next is Conference. ... You said the twelfth of May? Why, that's the day we broke their line at Spottsylvan-i-a! Hot work; eh, Colonel, was n't it? Ye mind that narrow front: They called it the âDeath-Angleâ! Well, well, my lad, we won't Fight that old battle over now: I only meant to say I really can't engage to come upon the twelfth of May. How's Thompson? What! will he be there? Well, now I want to know! The first man in the rebel works! they called him âSwearing Joe.â A wild young fellow, sir, I fear the rascal was; but thenâ Well, short of heaven, there wa'n't a place he dursn't lead his men. And Dick, you say, is coming too. And Billy? ah! it's true We buried him at Gettysburg: I mind the spot; do you? A little field below the hill,âit must be green this May; Perhaps that's why the fields about bring him to me to-day. Well, well, excuse me, Colonel! but there are some things that drop The tail-board out one's feelings; and the only way's to stop. So they want to see the old man; ah, the rascals! do they, eh? Well, I've business down in Boston about the twelfth of May. CALIFORNIA'S GREETING TO SEWARD (1869) We know him well: no need of praise Or bonfire from the windy hill To light to softer paths and ways The world-worn man we honor still. No need to quote the truths he spoke That burned through years of war and shame, While History carves with surer stroke Across our map his noonday fame. No need to bid him show the scars Of blows dealt by the ScÃ¦an gate, Who lived to pass its shattered bars, And see the foe capitulate: Who lived to turn his slower feet Toward the western setting sun, To see his harvest all complete, His dream fulfilled, his duty done, The one flag streaming from the pole, The one faith borne from sea to sea: For such a triumph, and such goal, Poor must our human greeting be. Ah! rather that the conscious land In simpler ways salute the Man,â The tall pines bowing where they stand, The bared head of El Capitan! The tumult of the waterfalls, Pohono's kerchief in the breeze, The waving from the rocky walls, The stir and rustle of the trees; Till, lapped in sunset skies of hope, In sunset lands by sunset seas, The Young World's Premier treads the slope Of sunset years in calm and peace. THE AGED STRANGER AN INCIDENT OF THE WAR âI was with Grantââthe stranger said; Said the farmer, âSay no more, But rest thee here at my cottage porch, For thy feet are weary and sore.â âI was with Grantââthe stranger said; Said the farmer, âNay, no more,â I prithee sit at my frugal board, And eat of my humble store. âHow fares my boy,âmy soldier boy, Of the old Ninth Army Corps? I warrant he bore him gallantly In the smoke and the battle's roar!â âI know him not,â said the aged man, âAnd, as I remarked before, I was with GrantâââNay, nay, I know,â Said the farmer, âsay no more: âHe fell in battle,âI see, alas! Thou'dst smooth these tidings o'er,â Nay, speak the truth, whatever it be, Though it rend my bosom's core. âHow fell he? With his face to the foe, Upholding the flag he bore? Oh, say not that my boy disgraced The uniform that he wore!â âI cannot tell,â said the aged man, âAnd should have remarked before, That I was with Grant,âin Illinois,â Some three years before the war.â Then the farmer spake him never a word, But beat with his fist full sore That aged man who had worked for Grant Some three years before the war. THE IDYL OF BATTLE HOLLOW (WAR OF THE REBELLION, 1864) No, I won't,âthar, now, so! And it ain't nothin',âno! And thar's nary to tell that you folks yer don't know; And it's âBelle, tell us, do!â and it's âBelle, is it true?â And âWot's this yer yarn of the Major and you?â Till I'm sick of it all,âso I am, but I s'pose Thet is nothin' to you. ... Well, then, listen! yer goes! It was after the fight, and around us all night Thar was poppin' and shootin' a powerful sight; And the niggers had fled, and Aunt Chlo was abed, And Pinky and Milly were hid in the shed: And I ran out at daybreak, and nothin' was nigh But the growlin' of cannon low down in the sky. And I saw not a thing, as I ran to the spring, But a splintered fence rail and a broken-down swing. And a bird said âKerchee!â as it sat on a tree, As if it was lonesome, and glad to see me; And I filled up my pail and was risin' to go, When up comes the Major a-canterin' slow. When he saw me he drew in his reins, and then threw On the gate-post his bridle, andâwhat does he do But come down where I sat; and he lifted his hat, And he saysâwell, thar ain't any need to tell that; 'T was some foolishness, sure, but it 'mounted to this, Thet he asked for a drink, and he wantedâa kiss. Then I said (I was mad), âFor the water, my lad, You're too big and must stoop; for a kiss, it's as bad,â You ain't near big enough.â And I turned in a huff, When that Major he laid his white hand on my cuff, And he says, âYou're a trump! Take my pistol, don't fear! But shoot the next man that insults you, my dear.â Then he stooped to the pool, very quiet and cool, Leavin' me with that pistol stuck there like a fool, When thar flashed on my sight a quick glimmer of light From the top of the little stone fence on the right, And I knew 't was a rifle, and back of it all Rose the face of that bushwhacker, Cherokee Hall! Then I felt in my dread that the moment the head Of the Major was lifted, the Major was dead; And I stood still and white, but Lord! gals, in spite Of my care, that derned pistol went off in my fright! Went offâtrue as gospil!âand, strangest of all, It actooally injured that Cherokee Hall! Thet's allânow, go 'long! Yes, some folks thinks it's wrong, And thar's some wants to know to what side I belong; But I says, âServed him right!â and I go, all my might, In love or in war, for a fair standâup fight; And as for the Majorâsho! gals, don't you know ThetâLord! thar's his step in the garden below. CALDWELL OF SPRINGFIELD (NEW JERSEY, 1780) Here's the spot. Look around you. Above on the height Lay the Hessians encamped. By that church on the right Stood the gaunt Jersey farmers. And here ran a wall,â You may dig anywhere and you'll turn up a ball. Nothing more. Grasses spring, waters run, flowers blow, Pretty much as they did ninety-three years ago. Nothing more, did I say? Stay one moment: you've heard Of Caldwell, the parson, who once preached the word Down at Springfield? What, no? Comeâthat's bad; why, he had All the Jerseys aflame! And they gave him the name Of the ârebel high priest.â He stuck in their gorge, For he loved the Lord Godâand he hated King George! He had cause, you might say! When the Hessians that day Marched up with Knyphausen, they stopped on their way At the âfarms,â where his wife, with a child in her arms, Sat alone in the house. How it happened none knew But Godâand that one of the hireling crew Who fired the shot! Enough!âthere she lay, And Caldwell, the chaplain, her husband, away! Did he preachâdid he pray? Think of him as you stand By the old church to-day,âthink of him and his band Of militant plough boys! See the smoke and the heat Of that reckless advance, of that straggling retreat! Keep the ghost of that wife, foully slain, in your viewâ And what could you, what should you, what would you do? Why, just what he did! They were left in the lurch For the want of more wadding. He ran to the church, Broke the door, stripped the pews, and dashed out in the road With his arms full of hymn-books, and threw down his load At their feet! Then above all the shouting and shots Rang his voice: âPut Watts into 'em! Boys, give 'em Watts!â And they did. That is all. Grasses spring, flowers blow, Pretty much as they did ninety-three years ago. You may dig anywhere and you'll turn up a ballâ But not always a hero like thisâand that's all. POEM DELIVERED ON THE FOURTEENTH ANNIVERSARY OF CALIFORNIA'S ADMISSION INTO THE UNION, SEPTEMBER 9, 1864 We meet in peace, though from our native East The sun that sparkles on our birthday feast Glanced as he rose on fields whose dews were red With darker tints than those Aurora spread. Though shorn his rays, his welcome disk concealed In the dim smoke that veiled each battlefield, Still striving upward, in meridian pride, He climbed the walls that East and West divide,â Saw his bright face flashed back from golden sand, And sapphire seas that lave the Western land. Strange was the contrast that such scenes disclose From his high vantage o'er eternal snows; There War's alarm the brazen trumpet ringsâ Here his love-song the mailed cicala sings; There bayonets glitter through the forest gladesâ Here yellow cornfields stack their peaceful blades; There the deep trench where Valor finds a graveâ Here the long ditch that curbs the peaceful wave; There the bold sapper with his lighted trainâ Here the dark tunnel and its stores of gain; Here the full harvest and the wain's advanceâ There the Grim Reaper and the ambulance. With scenes so adverse, what mysterious bond Links our fair fortunes to the shores beyond? Why come we hereâlast of a scattered foldâ To pour new metal in the broken mould? To yield our tribute, stamped with CÃ¦sar's face, To CÃ¦sar, stricken in the market-place? Ah! love of country is the secret tie That joins these contrasts 'neath one arching sky; Though brighter paths our peaceful steps explore, We meet together at the Nation's door. War winds her horn, and giant cliffs go down Like the high walls that girt the sacred town, And bares the pathway to her throbbing heart, From clustered village and from crowded mart. Part of God's providence it was to found A Nation's bulwark on this chosen ground; Not Jesuit's zeal nor pioneer's unrest Planted these pickets in the distant West, But He who first the Nation's fate forecast Placed here His fountains sealed for ages past, Rock-ribbed and guarded till the coming time Should fit the people for their work sublime; When a new Moses with his rod of steel Smote the tall cliffs with one wide-ringing peal, And the old miracle in record told To the new Nation was revealed in gold. Judge not too idly that our toils are mean, Though no new levies marshal on our green; Nor deem too rashly that our gains are small, Weighed with the prizes for which heroes fall. See, where thick vapor wreathes the battle-line; There Mercy follows with her oil and wine; Or where brown Labor with its peaceful charm Stiffens the sinews of the Nation's arm. What nerves its hands to strike a deadlier blow And hurl its legions on the rebel foe? Lo! for each town new rising o'er our State See the foe's hamlet waste and desolate, While each new factory lifts its chimney tall, Like a fresh mortar trained on Richmond's wall. For this, O brothers, swings the fruitful vine, Spread our broad pastures with their countless kine: For this o'erhead the arching vault springs clear, Sunlit and cloudless for one half the year; For this no snowflake, e'er so lightly pressed, Chills the warm impulse of our mother's breast. Quick to reply, from meadows brown and sere, She thrills responsive to Spring's earliest tear; Breaks into blossom, flings her loveliest rose Ere the white crocus mounts Atlantic snows; And the example of her liberal creed Teaches the lesson that to-day we heed. Thus ours the lot with peaceful, generous hand To spread our bounty o'er the suffering land; As the deep cleft in Mariposa's wall Hurls a vast river splintering in its fall,â Though the rapt soul who stands in awe below Sees but the arching of the promised bow,â Lo! the far streamlet drinks its dews unseen, And the whole valley wakes a brighter green. MISS BLANCHE SAYS And you are the poet, and so you want Somethingâwhat is it?âa theme, a fancy? Something or other the Muse won't grant To your old poetical necromancy; Why, one half you poetsâyou can't denyâ Don't know the Muse when you chance to meet her, But sit in your attics and mope and sigh For a faineant goddess to drop from the sky, When flesh and blood may be standing by Quite at your service, should you but greet her. What if I told you my own romance? Women are poets, if you so take them, One third poet,âthe rest what chance Of man and marriage may choose to make them. Give me ten minutes before you go,â Here at the window we'll sit together, Watching the currents that ebb and flow; Watching the world as it drifts below Up the hot Avenue's dusty glow: Is n't it pleasant, this bright June weather? Well, it was after the war broke out, And I was a schoolgirl fresh from Paris; Papa had contracts, and roamed about, And Iâdid nothingâfor I was an heiress. Picked some lint, now I think; perhaps Knitted some stockingsâa dozen nearly; Havelocks made for the soldiers' caps; Stood at fair-tables and peddled traps Quite at a profit. The âshoulder-strapsâ Thought I was pretty. Ah, thank you! really? Still it was stupid. Rata-tat-tat! Those were the sounds of that battle summer, Till the earth seemed a parchment round and flat, And every footfall the tap of a drummer; And day by day down the Avenue went Cavalry, infantry, all together, Till my pitying angel one day sent My fate in the shape of a regiment, That halted, just as the day was spent, Here at our door in the bright June weather. None of your dandy warriors they,â Men from the West, but where I know not; Haggard and travel-stained, worn and gray, With never a ribbon or lace or bow-knot: And I opened the window, and, leaning there, I felt in their presence the free winds blowing. My neck and shoulders and arms were bare,â I did not dream they might think me fair, But I had some flowers that night in my hair, And here, on my bosom, a red rose glowing. And I looked from the window along the line, Dusty and dirty and grim and solemn, Till an eye like a bayonet flash met mine, And a dark face shone from the darkening column, And a quick flame leaped to my eyes and hair, Till cheeks and shoulders burned all together, And the next I found myself standing there With my eyelids wet and my cheeks less fair, And the rose from my bosom tossed high in air, Like a blood-drop falling on plume and feather. Then I drew back quickly: there came a cheer, A rush of figures, a noise and tussle, And then it was over, and high and clear My red rose bloomed on his gun's black muzzle. Then far in the darkness a sharp voice cried, And slowly and steadily, all together, Shoulder to shoulder and side to side, Rising and falling and swaying wide, But bearing above them the rose, my pride, They marched away in the twilight weather. And I leaned from my window and watched my rose Tossed on the waves of the surging column, Warmed from above in the sunset glows, Borne from below by an impulse solemn. Then I shut the window. I heard no more Of my soldier friend, nor my flower neither, But lived my life as I did before. I did not go as a nurse to the war,â Sick folks to me are a dreadful bore,â So I did n't go to the hospital either. You smile, O poet, and what do you? You lean from your window, and watch life's column Trampling and struggling through dust and dew, Filled with its purposes grave and solemn; And an act, a gesture, a faceâwho knows?â Touches your fancy to thrill and haunt you, And you pluck from your bosom the verse that grows And down it flies like my red, red rose, And you sit and dream as away it goes, And think that your duty is done,ânow don't you? I know your answer. I'm not yet through. Look at this photograph,ââIn the Trenchesâ! That dead man in the coat of blue Holds a withered rose in his hand. That clenches Nothing!âexcept that the sun paints true, And a woman is sometimes prophetic-minded. And that's my romance. And, poet, you Take it and mould it to suit your view; And who knows but you may find it too Come to your heart once more, as mine did. AN ARCTIC VISION Where the short-legged Esquimaux Waddle in the ice and snow, And the playful Polar bear Nips the hunter unaware; Where by day they track the ermine, And by night another vermin,â Segment of the frigid zone, Where the temperature alone Warms on St. Elias' cone; Polar dock, where Nature slips From the ways her icy ships; Land of fox and deer and sable, Shore end of our western cable,â Let the news that flying goes Thrill through all your Arctic floes, And reverberate the boast From the cliffs off Beechey's coast, Till the tidings, circling round Every bay of Norton Sound, Throw the vocal tide-wave back To the isles of Kodiac. Let the stately Polar bears Waltz around the pole in pairs, And the walrus, in his glee, Bare his tusk of ivory; While the bold sea-unicorn Calmly takes an extra horn; All ye Polar skies, reveal your Very rarest of parhelia; Trip it, all ye merry dancers, In the airiest of âLancers;â Slide, ye solemn glaciers, slide, One inch farther to the tide, Nor in rash precipitation Upset Tyndall's calculation. Know you not what fate awaits you, Or to whom the future mates you? All ye icebergs, make salaam,â You belong to Uncle Sam! On the spot where Eugene Sue Led his wretched Wandering Jew, Stands a form whose features strike Russ and Esquimaux alike. He it is whom Skalds of old In their Runic rhymes foretold; Lean of flank and lank of jaw, See the real Northern Thor! See the awful Yankee leering Just across the Straits of Behring; On the drifted snow, too plain, Sinks his fresh tobacco stain, Just beside the deep indenâ Tation of his Number 10. Leaning on his icy hammer Stands the hero of this drama, And above the wild-duck's clamor, In his own peculiar grammar, With its linguistic disguises, Lo! the Arctic prologue rises: âWall, I reckon 't ain't so bad, Seein' ez 't was all they had. True, the Springs are rather late, And early Falls predominate; But the ice-crop's pretty sure, And the air is kind o' pure; 'T ain't so very mean a trade, When the land is all surveyed. There's a right smart chance for fur-chase All along this recent purchase, And, unless the stories fail, Every fish from cod to whale; Rocks, too; mebbe quartz; let's see,â 'T would be strange if there should be,â Seems I've heerd such stories told; Eh!âwhy, bless us,âyes, it's gold!â While the blows are falling thick From his California pick, You may recognize the Thor Of the vision that I saw,â Freed from legendary glamour, See the real magician's hammer. ST. THOMAS (A GEOGRAPHICAL SURVEY, 1868) Very fair and full of promise Lay the island of St. Thomas: Ocean o'er its reefs and bars Hid its elemental scars; Groves of cocoanut and guava Grew above its fields of lava. So the gem of the Antillesâ âIsles of Eden,â where no ill isâ Like a great green turtle slumbered On the sea that it encumbered. Then said William Henry Seward, As he cast his eye to leeward, âQuite important to our commerce Is this island of St. Thomas.â Said the Mountain ranges, âThank'ee, But we cannot stand the Yankee O'er our scars and fissures poring, In our very vitals boring, In our sacred caverns prying, All our secret problems trying,â Digging, blasting, with dynamit Mocking all our thunders! Damn it! Other lands may be more civil; Bust our lava crust if we will!â Said the Sea, its white teeth gnashing Through its coral-reef lips flashing, âShall I let this scheming mortal Shut with stone my shining portal, Curb my tide and check my play, Fence with wharves my shining bay? Rather let me be drawn out In one awful waterspout!â Said the black-browed Hurricane, Brooding down the Spanish Main, âShall I see my forces, zounds! Measured by square inch and pounds, With detectives at my back When I double on my track, And my secret paths made clear, Published o'er the hemisphere To each gaping, prying crew? Shall I? Blow me if I do!â So the Mountains shook and thundered, And the Hurricane came sweeping, And the people stared and wondered As the Sea came on them leaping: Each, according to his promise, Made things lively at St. Thomas. Till one morn, when Mr. Seward Cast his weather eye to leeward, There was not an inch of dry land Left to mark his recent island. Not a flagstaff or a sentry, Not a wharf or port of entry,â Onlyâto cut matters shorterâ Just a patch of muddy water In the open ocean lying, And a gull above it flying. OFF SCARBOROUGH (SEPTEMBER, 1779) I âHave a care!â the bailiffs cried From their cockleshell that lay Off the frigate's yellow side, Tossing on Scarborough Bay, While the forty sail it convoyed on a bowline stretched away. âTake your chicks beneath your wings, And your claws and feathers spread, Ere the hawk upon them springs,â Ere around Flamborough Head Swoops Paul Jones, the Yankee falcon, with his beak and talons red.â II How we laughed!âmy mate and I,â On the âBon Homme Richard'sâ deck, As we saw that convoy fly Like a snow-squall, till each fleck Melted in the twilight shadows of the coast-line, speck by speck; And scuffling back to shore The Scarborough bailiffs sped, As the âRichard,â with a roar Of her cannon round the Head, Crossed her royal yards and signaled to her consort: âChase ahead!â III But the devil seize Landais In that consort ship of France! For the shabby, lubber way That he worked the âAllianceâ In the offing,ânor a broadside fired save to our mischance!â When tumbling to the van, With his battle-lanterns set, Rose the burly Englishman 'Gainst our hull as black as jet,â Rode the yellow-sided âSerapis,â and all alone we met! IV All alone, though far at sea Hung his consort, rounding to; All alone, though on our lee Fought our âPallas,â stanch and true! For the first broadside around us both a smoky circle drew: And, like champions in a ring, There was cleared a little spaceâ Scarce a cable's length to swingâ Ere we grappled in embrace, All the world shut out around us, and we only face to face! V Then awoke all hell below From that broadside, doubly curst, For our long eighteens in row Leaped the first discharge and burst! And on deck our men came pouring, fearing their own guns the worst. And as dumb we lay, till, through Smoke and flame and bitter cry, Hailed the âSerapis:â âHave you Struck your colors?â Our reply, âWe have not yet begun to fight!â went shouting to the sky! VI Roux of Brest, old fisher, lay Like a herring gasping here; Bunker of Nantucket Bay, Blown from out the port, dropped sheer Half a cable's length to leeward; yet we faintly raised a cheer As with his own right hand Our Commodore made fast The foeman's head-gear and The âRichard'sâ mizzen-mast, And in that death-lock clinging held us there from first to last! VII Yet the foeman, gun on gun, Through the âRichardâ tore a road, With his gunners' rammers run Through our ports at every load, Till clear the blue beyond us through our yawning timbers showed. Yet with entrails torn we clung Like the Spartan to our fox, And on deck no coward tongue Wailed the enemy's hard knocks, Nor that all below us trembled like a wreck upon the rocks. VIII Then a thought rose in my brain, As through Channel mists the sun. From our tops a fire like rain Drove below decks every one Of the enemy's ship's company to hide or work a gun: And that thought took shape as I On the âRichard'sâ yard lay out, That a man might do and die, If the doing brought about Freedom for his home and country, and his messmates' cheering shout! IX Then I crept out in the dark Till I hung above the hatch Of the âSerapis,ââa mark For her marksmen!âwith a match And a hand-grenade, but lingered just a moment more to snatch One last look at sea and sky! At the lighthouse on the hill! At the harvest-moon on high! And our pine flag fluttering still! Then turned and down her yawning throat I launched that devil's pill! X Then a blank was all between As the flames around me spun! Had I fired the magazine? Was the victory lost or won? Nor knew I till the fight was o'er but half my work was done: For I lay among the dead In the cockpit of our foe, With a roar above my head,â Till a trampling to and fro, And a lantern showed my mate's face, and I knew what now you know! CADET GREY CANTO I I Act first, scene first. A study. Of a kind Half cell, half salon, opulent yet grave; Rare books, low-shelved, yet far above the mind Of common man to compass or to crave; Some slight relief of pamphlets that inclined The soul at first to trifling, till, dismayed By text and title, it drew back resigned, Nor cared with levity to vex a shade That to itself such perfect concord made. II Some thoughts like these perplexed the patriot brain Of Jones, Lawgiver to the Commonwealth, As on the threshold of this chaste domain He paused expectant, and looked up in stealth To darkened canvases that frowned amain, With stern-eyed Puritans, who first began To spread their roots in Georgius Primus' reign, Nor dropped till now, obedient to some plan, Their century fruit,âthe perfect Boston man. III Somewhere within that Russia-scented gloom A voice catarrhal thrilled the Member's ear: âBrief is our business, Jones. Look round this room! Regard yon portraits! Read their meaning clear! These much proclaim my station. I presume You are our Congressman, before whose wit And sober judgment shall the youth appear Who for West Point is deemed most just and fit To serve his country and to honor it. IV âSuch is my son! Elsewhere perhaps 't were wise Trial competitive should guide your choice. There are some people I can well surmise Themselves must show their merits. History's voice Spares me that trouble: all desert that lies In yonder ancestor of Queen Anne's day, Or yon grave Governor, is all my boy's,â Reverts to him; entailed, as one might say; In brief, result in Winthrop Adams Grey!â V He turned and laid his well-bred hand, and smiled, On the cropped head of one who stood beside. Ah me! in sooth it was no ruddy child Nor brawny youth that thrilled the father's pride; 'T was but a Mind that somehow had beguiled From soulless Matter processes that served For speech and motion and digestion mild, Content if all one moral purpose nerved, Nor recked thereby its spine were somewhat curved. VI He was scarce eighteen. Yet ere he was eight He had despoiled the classics; much he knew Of Sanskrit; not that he placed undue weight On this, but that it helped him with Hebrew, His favorite tongue. He learned, alas! too late, One can't begin too early,âwould regret That boyish whim to ascertain the state Of Venus' atmosphere made him forget That philologic goal on which his soul was set. VII He too had traveled; at the age of ten Found Paris empty, dull except for art And accent. âMabilleâ with its glories then Less than Egyptian âAlmeesâ touched a heart Nothing if not pure classic. If some men Thought him a prig, it vexed not his conceit. But moved his pity, and ofttimes his pen, The better to instruct them, through some sheet Published in Boston, and signed âBeacon Street.â VIII From premises so plain the blind could see But one deduction, and it came next day. In times like these, the very name of G. Speaks volumes,â wrote the Honorable J. Inclosed please find appointment.â Presently Came a reception to which Harvard lent Fourteen professors, and, to give esprit, The Liberal Club some eighteen ladies sent, Five that spoke Greek, and thirteen sentiment. IX Four poets came who loved each other's song, And two philosophers, who thought that they Were in most things impractical and wrong; And two reformers, each in his own way Peculiar,âone who had waxed strong On herbs and water, and such simple fare; Two foreign lions, âRam Seeâ and âChy Long,â And several artists claimed attention there, Based on the fact they had been snubbed elsewhere. X With this indorsement nothing now remained But counsel, Godspeed, and some calm adieux; No foolish tear the father's eyelash stained, And Winthrop's cheek as guiltless shone of dew. A slight publicity, such as obtained In classic Rome, these few last hours attended. The day arrived, the train and depot gained, The mayor's own presence this last act commended The train moved off, and here the first act ended. CANTO II I Where West Point crouches, and with lifted shield Turns the whole river eastward through the pass; Whose jutting crags, half silver, stand revealed Like bossy bucklers of Leonidas; Where buttressed low against the storms that wield Their summer lightnings where her eaglets swarm, By Freedom's cradle Nature's self has steeled Her heart, like Winkelried, and to that storm Of leveled lances bares her bosom warm. II But not to-night. The air and woods are still, The faintest rustle in the trees below, The lowest tremor from the mountain rill, Come to the ear as but the trailing flow Of spirit robes that walk unseen the hill; The moon low sailing o'er the upland farm, The moon low sailing where the waters fill The lozenge lake, beside the banks of balm, Gleams like a chevron on the river's arm. III All space breathes languor: from the hilltop high, Where Putnam's bastion crumbles in the past, To swooning depths where drowsy cannon lie And wide-mouthed mortars gape in slumbers vast; Stroke upon stroke, the far oars glance and die On the hushed bosom of the sleeping stream; Bright for one moment drifts a white sail by, Bright for one moment shows a bayonet gleam Far on the level plain, then passes as a dream. IV Soft down the line of darkened battlements, Bright on each lattice of the barrack walls, Where the low arching sallyport indents, Seen through its gloom beyond, the moonbeam falls. All is repose save where the camping tents Mock the white gravestones farther on, where sound No morning guns for reveille, nor whence No drum-beat calls retreat, but still is ever found Waiting and present on each sentry's round. V Within the camp they lie, the young, the brave, Half knight, half schoolboy, acolytes of fame, Pledged to one altar, and perchance one grave; Bred to fear nothing but reproach and blame, Ascetic dandies o'er whom vestals rave, Clean-limbed young Spartans, disciplined young elves, Taught to destroy, that they may live to save, Students embattled, soldiers at their shelves, Heroes whose conquests are at first themselves. VI Within the camp they lie, in dreams are freed From the grim discipline they learn to love; In dreams no more the sentry's challenge heed, In dreams afar beyond their pickets rove; One treads once more the piny paths that lead To his green mountain home, and pausing hears The cattle call; one treads the tangled weed Of slippery rocks beside Atlantic piers; One smiles in sleep, one wakens wet with tears. VII One scents the breath of jasmine flowers that twine The pillared porches of his Southern home; One hears the coo of pigeons in the pine Of Western woods where he was wont to roam; One sees the sunset fire the distant line Where the long prairie sweeps its levels down; One treads the snow-peaks; one by lamps that shine Down the broad highways of the sea-girt town; And two are missing,âCadets Grey and Brown! VIII Much as I grieve to chronicle the fact, That selfsame truant known as âCadet Greyâ Was the young hero of our moral tract, Shorn of his twofold names on entrance-day. âWinthropâ and âAdamsâ dropped in that one act Of martial curtness, and the roll-call thinned Of his ancestors, he with youthful tact Indulgence claimed, since Winthrop no more sinned, Nor sainted Adams winced when he, plain Grey, was âskinned.â IX He had known trials since we saw him last, By sheer good luck had just escaped rejection, Not for his learning, but that it was cast In a spare frame scarce fit for drill inspection; But when he ope'd his lips a stream so vast Of information flooded each professor, They quite forgot his eyeglass,âsomething past All precedent,âaccepting the transgressor, Weak eyes and all of which he was possessor. X E'en the first day he touched a blackboard's spaceâ So the tradition of his glory lingersâ Two wise professors fainted, each with face White as the chalk within his rapid fingers: All day he ciphered, at such frantic pace, His form was hid in chalk precipitation Of every problem, till they said his case Could meet from them no fair examination Till Congress made a new appropriation. XI Famous in molecules, he demonstrated From the mess hash to many a listening classful; Great as a botanist, he separated Three kinds of âMenthaâ in one julep's glassful; High in astronomy, it has been stated He was the first at West Point to discover Mars' missing satellites, and calculated Their true positions, not the heavens over, But 'neath the window of Miss Kitty Rover. XII Indeed, I fear this novelty celestial That very night was visible and clear; At least two youths of aspect most terrestrial, And clad in uniform, were loitering near A villa's casement, where a gentle vestal Took their impatience somewhat patiently, Knowing the youths were somewhat green and âbestialââ (A certain slang of the Academy, I beg the reader won't refer to me). XIII For when they ceased their ardent strain, Miss Kitty Glowed not with anger nor a kindred flame, But rather flushed with an odd sort of pity, Half matron's kindness, and half coquette's shame; Proud yet quite blameful, when she heard their ditty She gave her soul poetical expression, And being clever too, as she was pretty, From her high casement warbled this confession,â Half provocation and one half repression:â NOT YET Not yet, O friend, not yet! the patient stars Lean from their lattices, content to wait. All is illusion till the morning bars Slip from the levels of the Eastern gate. Night is too young, O friend! day is too near; Wait for the day that maketh all things clear. Not yet, O friend, not yet! Not yet, O love, not yet! all is not true, All is not ever as it seemeth now. Soon shall the river take another blue, Soon dies yon light upon the mountain brow. What lieth dark, O love, bright day will fill; Wait for thy morning, be it good or ill. Not yet, O love, not yet! XIV The strain was finished; softly as the night Her voice died from the window, yet e'en then Fluttered and fell likewise a kerchief white; But that no doubt was accident, for when She sought her couch she deemed her conduct quite Beyond the reach of scandalous commenter,â Washing her hands of either gallant wight, Knowing the moralist might compliment her,â Thus voicing Siren with the words of Mentor. XV She little knew the youths below, who straight Dived for her kerchief, and quite overlooked The pregnant moral she would inculcate; Nor dreamed the less how little Winthrop brooked Her right to doubt his soul's maturer state. Brownâwho was Western, amiable, and newâ Might take the moral and accept his fate; The which he did, but, being stronger too, Took the white kerchief, also, as his due. XVI They did not quarrel, which no doubt seemed queer To those who knew not how their friendship blended Each was opposed, and each the other's peer, Yet each the other in some things transcended. Where Brown lacked culture, brains,âand oft, I fear, Cash in his pocket,âGrey of course supplied him; Where Grey lacked frankness, force, and faith sincere, Brown of his manhood suffered none to chide him, But in his faults stood manfully beside him. XVII In academic walks and studies grave, In the camp drill and martial occupation, They helped each other; but just here I crave Space for the reader's full imagination,â The fact is patent, Grey became a slave! A tool, a fag, a âplebâ! To state it plainer, All that blue blood and ancestry e'er gave Cleaned guns, brought water!âwas, in fact, retainer To Jones, whose uncle was a paper-stainer! XVIII How they bore this at home I cannot say: I only know so runs the gossip's tale. It chanced one day that the paternal Grey Came to West Point that he himself might hail The future hero in some proper way Consistent with his lineage. With him came A judge, a poet, and a brave array Of aunts and uncles, bearing each a name, Eyeglass and respirator with the same. XIX âObserve!â quoth Grey the elder to his friends, âNot in these giddy youths at baseball playing You'll notice Winthrop Adams! Greater ends Than these absorb his leisure. No doubt straying With CÃ¦sar's Commentaries, he attends Some Roman council. Let us ask, however, Yon grimy urchin, who my soul offends By wheeling offal, if he will endeavor To findâWhat! heaven! Winthrop! Oh! no! never!â XX Alas! too true! The last of all the Greys Was âdoing police detail,ââit had come To this; in vain the rare historic bays That crowned the pictured Puritans at home! And yet 't was certain that in grosser ways Of health and physique he was quite improving. Straighter he stood, and had achieved some praise In other exercise, much more behooving A soldier's taste than merely dirt removing. XXI But to resume: we left the youthful pair, Some stanzas back, before a lady's bower; 'T is to be hoped they were no longer there, For stars were pointing to the morning hour. Their escapade discovered, ill 't would fare With our two heroes, derelict of orders; But, like the ghost, they âscent the morning air,â And back again they steal across the borders, Unseen, unheeded, by their martial warders. XXII They got to bed with speed: young Grey to dream Of some vague future with a general's star, And Mistress Kitty basking in its gleam; While Brown, content to worship her afar, Dreamed himself dying by some lonely stream, Having snatched Kitty from eighteen Nez Perces, Till a far bugle, with the morning beam, In his dull ear its fateful song rehearses, Which Winthrop Adams after put to verses. XXIII So passed three years of their novitiate, The first real boyhood Grey had ever known. His youth ran clear,ânot choked like his Cochituate, In civic pipes, but free and pure alone: Yet knew repression, could himself habituate To having mind and body well rubbed down. Could read himself in others, and could situate Themselves in him,âexcept, I grieve to own, He could n't see what Kitty saw in Brown! XXIV At last came graduation; Brown received In the One Hundredth Cavalry commission; Then frolic, flirting, parting,âwhen none grieved Save Brown, who loved our young Academician, And Grey, who felt his friend was still deceived By Mistress Kitty, who with other beauties Graced the occasion, and it was believed Had promised Brown that when he could recruit his Promised command, she'd share with him those duties XXV Howe'er this was I know not; all I know, The night was June's, the moon rode high and clear; â'T was such a night as this,â three years ago, Miss Kitty sang the song that two might hear. There is a walk where trees o'erarching grow, Too wide for one, not wide enough for three (A fact precluding any plural beau), Which quite explained Miss Kitty's company, But not why Grey that favored one should be. XXVI There is a spring, whose limpid waters hide Somewhere within the shadows of that path Called Kosciusko's. There two figures bide,â Grey and Miss Kitty. Surely Nature hath No fairer mirror for a might-be bride Than this same pool that caught our gentle belle To its dark heart one moment. At her side Grey bent. A something trembled o'er the well, Bright, sphericalâa tear? Ah no! a button fell! XXVII âMaterial minds might think that gravitation,â Quoth Grey, âdrew yon metallic spheroid down. The soul poetic views the situation Fraught with more meaning. When thy girlish crown Was mirrored there, there was disintegration Of me, and all my spirit moved to you, Taking the form of slow precipitation!â But here came âTaps,â a start, a smile, adieu! A blush, a sigh, and end of Canto II. BUGLE SONG Fades the light, And afar Goeth day, cometh night; And a star Leadeth all, Speedeth all To their rest! Love, good-night! Must thou go When the day And the light Need thee so,â Needeth all, Heedeth all, That is best? CANTO III I Where the sun sinks through leagues of arid sky, Where the sun dies o'er leagues of arid plain, Where the dead bones of wasted rivers lie, Trailed from their channels in yon mountain chain; Where day by day naught takes the wearied eye But the low-rimming mountains, sharply based On the dead levels, moving far or nigh, As the sick vision wanders o'er the waste, But ever day by day against the sunset traced: II There moving through a poisonous cloud that stings With dust of alkali the trampling band Of Indian ponies, ride on dusky wings The red marauders of the Western land; Heavy with spoil, they seek the trail that brings Their flaunting lances to that sheltered bank Where lie their lodges; and the river sings Forgetful of the plain beyond, that drank Its life blood, where the wasted caravan sank. III They brought with them the thief's ignoble spoil, The beggar's dole, the greed of chiffonnier, The scum of camps, the implements of toil Snatched from dead hands, to rust as useless here; All they could rake or glean from hut or soil Piled their lean ponies, with the jackdaw's greed For vacant glitter. It were scarce a foil To all this tinsel that one feathered reed Bore on its barb two scalps that freshly bleed! IV They brought with them, alas! a wounded foe, Bound hand and foot, yet nursed with cruel care, Lest that in death he might escape one throe They had decreed his living flesh should bear: A youthful officer, by one foul blow Of treachery surprised, yet fighting still Amid his ambushed train, calm as the snow Above him; hopeless, yet content to spill His blood with theirs, and fighting but to kill. V He had fought nobly, and in that brief spell Had won the awe of those rude border men Who gathered round him, and beside him fell In loyal faith and silence, save that when By smoke embarrassed, and near sight as well, He paused to wipe his eyeglass, and decide Its nearer focus, there arose a yell Of approbation, and Bob Barker cried, âWade in, Dundreary!â tossed his cap andâdied. VI Their sole survivor now! his captors bear Him all unconscious, and beside the stream Leave him to rest; meantime the squaws prepare The stake for sacrifice: nor wakes a gleam Of pity in those Furies' eyes that glare Expectant of the torture; yet alway His steadfast spirit shines and mocks them there With peace they know not, till at close of day On his dull ear there thrills a whispered âGrey!â VII He starts! Was it a trick? Had angels kind Touched with compassion some weak woman's breast? Such things he'd read of! Faintly to his mind Came Pocahontas pleading for her guest. But then, this voice, though soft, was still inclined To baritone! A squaw in ragged gown Stood near him, frowning hatred. Was he blind? Whose eye was this beneath that beetling frown? The frown was painted, but that wink meantâBrown! VIII âHush! for your life and mine! the thongs are cut,â He whispers; âin yon thicket stands my horse. One dash!âI follow close, as if to glut My own revenge, yet bar the others' course. Now!â And 't is done. Grey speeds, Brown follows; but Ere yet they reach the shade, Grey, fainting, reels, Yet not before Brown's circling arms close shut His in, uplifting him! Anon he feels A horse beneath him bound, and hears the rattling heels. IX Then rose a yell of baffled hate, and sprang Headlong the savages in swift pursuit; Though speed the fugitives, they hope to hang Hot on their heels, like wolves, with tireless foot. Long is the chase; Brown hears with inward pang The short, hard panting of his gallant steed Beneath its double burden; vainly rang Both voice and spur. The heaving flanks may bleed, Yet comes the sequel that they still must heed! X Brown saw itâreined his steed; dismounting, stood Calm and inflexible. âOld chap! you see There is but one escape. You know it? Good! There is one man to take it. You are he. The horse won't carry double. If he could, 'T would but protract this bother. I shall stay: I've business with these devils, they with me; I will occupy them till you get away. Hush! quick time, forward. There! God bless you, Grey!â XI But as he finished, Grey slipped to his feet, Calm as his ancestors in voice and eye: âYou do forget yourself when you compete With him whose right it is to stay and die: That's not your duty. Please regain your seat; And take my ordersâsince I rank you here!â Mount and rejoin your men, and my defeat Report at quarters. Take this letter; ne'er Give it to aught but her, nor let aught interfere.â XII And, shamed and blushing, Brown the letter took Obediently and placed it in his pocket; Then, drawing forth another, said, âI look For death as you do, wherefore take this locket And letter.â Here his comrade's hand he shook In silence. âShould we both together fall, Some other manââbut here all speech forsook His lips, as ringing cheerily o'er all He heard afar his own dear bugle-call! XIII 'T was his command and succor, but e'en then Grey fainted, with poor Brown, who had forgot He likewise had been wounded, and both men Were picked up quite unconscious of their lot. Long lay they in extremity, and when They both grew stronger, and once more exchanged Old vows and memories, one common âdenâ In hospital was theirs, and free they ranged, Awaiting orders, but no more estranged. XIV And yet 't was strangeânor can I end my tale Without this moral, to be fair and just: They never sought to know why each did fail The prompt fulfillment of the other's trust. It was suggested they could not avail Themselves of either letter, since they were Duly dispatched to their address by mail By Captain X., who knew Miss Rover fair Now meant stout Mistress Bloggs of Blank Blank Square. II. SPANISH IDYLS AND LEGENDS THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO This is the tale that the Chronicle Tells of the wonderful miracle Wrought by the pious Padre Serro, The very reverend Junipero. The heathen stood on his ancient mound, Looking over the desert bound Into the distant, hazy South, Over the dusty and broad champaign, Where, with many a gaping mouth And fissure, cracked by the fervid drouth, For seven months had the wasted plain Known no moisture of dew or rain. The wells were empty and choked with sand; The rivers had perished from the land; Only the sea-fogs to and fro Slipped like ghosts of the streams below. Deep in its bed lay the river's bones, Bleaching in pebbles and milk-white stones, And tracked o'er the desert faint and far, Its ribs shone bright on each sandy bar. Thus they stood as the sun went down Over the foot-hills bare and brown; Thus they looked to the South, wherefrom The pale-face medicine-man should come, Not in anger or in strife, But to bringâso ran the taleâ The welcome springs of eternal life, The living waters that should not fail. Said one, âHe will come like Manitou, Unseen, unheard, in the falling dew.â Said another, âHe will come full soon Out of the round-faced watery moon.â And another said, âHe is here!â and lo, Faltering, staggering, feeble and slow, Out from the desert's blinding heat The Padre dropped at the heathen's feet. They stood and gazed for a little space Down on his pallid and careworn face, And a smile of scorn went round the band As they touched alternate with foot and hand This mortal waif, that the outer space Of dim mysterious sky and sand Flung with so little of Christian grace Down on their barren, sterile strand. Said one to him: âIt seems thy God Is a very pitiful kind of God: He could not shield thine aching eyes From the blowing desert sands that rise, Nor turn aside from thy old gray head The glittering blade that is brandishÃ¨d By the sun He set in the heavens high; He could not moisten thy lips when dry; The desert fire is in thy brain; Thy limbs are racked with the fever-pain; If this be the grace He showeth thee Who art His servant, what may we, Strange to His ways and His commands, Seek at His unforgiving hands?â âDrink but this cup,â said the Padre, straight, âAnd thou shalt know whose mercy bore These aching limbs to your heathen door, And purged my soul of its gross estate. Drink in His name, and thou shalt see The hidden depths of this mystery. Drink!â and he held the cup. One blow From the heathen dashed to the ground below The sacred cup that the Padre bore, And the thirsty soil drank the precious store Of sacramental and holy wine, That emblem and consecrated sign And blessed symbol of blood divine. Then, says the legend (and they who doubt The same as heretics be accurst), From the dry and feverish soil leaped out A living fountain; a well-spring burst Over the dusty and broad champaign, Over the sandy and sterile plain, Till the granite ribs and the milk-white stones That lay in the valleyâthe scattered bonesâ Moved in the river and lived again! Such was the wonderful miracle Wrought by the cup of wine that fell From the hands of the pious Padre Serro, The very reverend Junipero. THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN Of all the fountains that poets sing,â Crystal, thermal, or mineral spring, Ponce de Leon's Fount of Youth, Wells with bottoms of doubtful truth,â In short, of all the springs of Time That ever were flowing in fact or rhyme, That ever were tasted, felt, or seen, There were none like the Spring of San Joaquin. Anno Domini eighteen-seven, Father Dominguez (now in heaven,â Obiit eighteen twenty-seven) Found the spring, and found it, too, By his mule's miraculous cast of a shoe; For his beastâa descendant of Balaam's assâ Stopped on the instant, and would not pass. The Padre thought the omen good, And bent his lips to the trickling flood; Thenâas the Chronicles declare, On the honest faith of a true believerâ His cheeks, though wasted, lank, and bare, Filled like a withered russet pear In the vacuum of a glass receiver, And the snows that seventy winters bring Melted away in that magic spring. Such, at least, was the wondrous news The Padre brought into Santa Cruz. The Church, of course, had its own views Of who were worthiest to use The magic spring; but the prior claim Fell to the aged, sick, and lame. Far and wide the people came; Some from the healthful Aptos Creek Hastened to bring their helpless sick; Even the fishers of rude Soquel Suddenly found they were far from well; The brawny dwellers of San Lorenzo Said, in fact, they had never been so; And all were ailing,âstrange to say,â From Pescadero to Monterey. Over the mountain they poured in, With leathern bottles and bags of skin Through the caÃ±ons a motley throng Trotted, hobbled, and limped along. The Fathers gazed at the moving scene With pious joy and with souls serene; And thenâa result perhaps foreseenâ They laid out the Mission of San Joaquin. Not in the eyes of faith alone The good effects of the water shone; But skins grew rosy, eyes waxed clear, Of rough vaquero and muleteer; Angular forms were rounded out, Limbs grew supple and waists grew stout; And as for the girls,âfor miles about They had no equal! To this day, From Pescadero to Monterey, You'll still find eyes in which are seen The liquid graces of San Joaquin. There is a limit to human bliss, And the Mission of San Joaquin had this; None went abroad to roam or stay But they fell sick in the queerest way,â A singular maladie du pays, With gastric symptoms: so they spent Their days in a sensuous content, Caring little for things unseen Beyond their bowers of living green, Beyond the mountains that lay between The world and the Mission of San Joaquin. Winter passed, and the summer came; The trunks of madroÃ±o, all aflame, Here and there through the underwood Like pillars of fire starkly stood. All of the breezy solitude Was filled with the spicing of pine and bay And resinous odors mixed and blended; And dim and ghostlike, far away, The smoke of the burning woods ascended. Then of a sudden the mountains swam, The rivers piled their floods in a dam, The ridge above Los Gatos Creek Arched its spine in a feline fashion; The forests waltzed till they grew sick, And Nature shook in a speechless passion; And, swallowed up in the earthquake's spleen, The wonderful Spring of San Joaquin Vanished, and never more was seen! Two days passed: the Mission folk Out of their rosy dream awoke; Some of them looked a trifle white, But that, no doubt, was from earthquake fright. Three days: there was sore distress, Headache, nausea, giddiness. Four days: faintings, tenderness Of the mouth and fauces; and in less Than one weekâhere the story closes; We won't continue the prognosisâ Enough that now no trace is seen Of Spring or Mission of San Joaquin. MORAL You see the point? Don't be too quick To break bad habits: better stick, Like the Mission folk, to your arsenic. THE ANGELUS (HEARD AT THE MISSION DOLORES, 1868) Bells of the Past, whose long-forgotten music Still fills the wide expanse, Tingeing the sober twilight of the Present With color of romance! I hear your call, and see the sun descending On rock and wave and sand, As down the coast the Mission voices, blending, Girdle the heathen land. Within the circle of your incantation No blight nor mildew falls; Nor fierce unrest, nor lust, nor low ambition Passes those airy walls. Borne on the swell of your long waves receding, I touch the farther Past; I see the dying glow of Spanish glory, The sunset dream and last! Before me rise the dome-shaped Mission towers, The white Presidio; The swart commander in his leathern jerkin, The priest in stole of snow. Once more I see Portala's cross uplifting Above the setting sun; And past the headland, northward, slowly drifting, The freighted galleon. O solemn bells! whose consecrated masses Recall the faith of old; O tinkling bells! that lulled with twilight music The spiritual fold! Your voices break and falter in the darkness,â Break, falter, and are still; And veiled and mystic, like the Host descending, The sun sinks from the hill! CONCEPCION DE ARGUELLO (PRESIDIO DE SAN FRANCISCO, 1800) I Looking seaward, o'er the sand-hills stands the fortress, old and quaint, By the San Francisco friars lifted to their patron saint,â Sponsor to that wondrous city, now apostate to the creed, On whose youthful walls the Padre saw the angel's golden reed; All its trophies long since scattered, all its blazon brushed away; And the flag that flies above it but a triumph of to-day. Never scar of siege or battle challenges the wandering eye, Never breach of warlike onset holds the curious passer-by; Only one sweet human fancy interweaves its threads of gold With the plain and homespun present, and a love that ne'er grows old; Only one thing holds its crumbling walls above the meaner dust,â Listen to the simple story of a woman's love and trust. II Count von Resanoff, the Russian, envoy of the mighty Czar, Stood beside the deep embrasures, where the brazen cannon are. He with grave provincial magnates long had held serene debate On the Treaty of Alliance and the high affairs of state; He from grave provincial magnates oft had turned to talk apart With the Commandante's daughter on the questions of the heart, Until points of gravest import yielded slowly one by one, And by Love was consummated what Diplomacy begun; Till beside the deep embrasures, where the brazen cannon are, He received the twofold contract for approval of the Czar; Till beside the brazen cannon the betrothÃ¨d bade adieu, And from sallyport and gateway north the Russian eagles flew. III Long beside the deep embrasures, where the brazen cannon are, Did they wait the promised bridegroom and the answer of the Czar; Day by day on wall and bastion beat the hollow, empty breeze,â Day by day the sunlight glittered on the vacant, smiling seas; Week by week the near hills whitened in their dusty leather cloaks,â Week by week the far hills darkened from the fringing plain of oaks; Till the rains came, and far breaking, on the fierce southwester tost, Dashed the whole long coast with color, and then vanished and were lost. So each year the seasons shifted,âwet and warm and drear and dry; Half a year of clouds and flowers, half a year of dust and sky. Still it brought no ship nor message,âbrought no tidings, ill or meet, For the statesmanlike Commander, for the daughter fair and sweet. Yet she heard the varying message, voiceless to all ears beside: âHe will come,â the flowers whispered; âCome no more,â the dry hills sighed. Still she found him with the waters lifted by the morning breeze,â Still she lost him with the folding of the great white-tented seas; Until hollows chased the dimples from her cheeks of olive brown, And at times a swift, shy moisture dragged the long sweet lashes down; Or the small mouth curved and quivered as for some denied caress, And the fair young brow was knitted in an infantine distress. Then the grim Commander, pacing where the brazen cannon are, Comforted the maid with proverbs, wisdom gathered from afar; Bits of ancient observation by his fathers garnered, each As a pebble worn and polished in the current of his speech: ââThose who wait the coming rider travel twice as far as he;â âTired wench and coming butter never did in time agree;â ââHe that getteth himself honey, though a clown, he shall have flies;â âIn the end God grinds the miller;â âIn the dark the mole has eyes;â ââHe whose father is Alcalde of his trial hath no fear,ââ And be sure the Count has reasons that will make his conduct clear.â Then the voice sententious faltered, and the wisdom it would teach Lost itself in fondest trifles of his soft Castilian speech; And on âConcha,â âConchitita,â and âConchitaâ he would dwell With the fond reiteration which the Spaniard knows so well. So with proverbs and caresses, half in faith and half in doubt, Every day some hope was kindled, flickered, faded, and went out. IV Yearly, down the hillside sweeping, came the stately cavalcade, Bringing revel to vaquero, joy and comfort to each maid; Bringing days of formal visit, social feast and rustic sport, Of bull-baiting on the plaza, of love-making in the court. Vainly then at Concha's lattice, vainly as the idle wind, Rose the thin high Spanish tenor that bespoke the youth too kind; Vainly, leaning from their saddles, caballeros, bold and fleet, Plucked for her the buried chicken from beneath their mustang's feet; So in vain the barren hillsides with their gay serapes blazed,â Blazed and vanished in the dust-cloud that their flying hoofs had raised. Then the drum called from the rampart, and once more, with patient mien, The Commander and his daughter each took up the dull routine,â Each took up the petty duties of a life apart and lone, Till the slow years wrought a music in its dreary monotone. V Forty years on wall and bastion swept the hollow idle breeze, Since the Russian eagle fluttered from the California seas; Forty years on wall and bastion wrought its slow but sure decay, And St. George's cross was lifted in the port of Monterey; And the citadel was lighted, and the hall was gayly drest, All to honor Sir George Simpson, famous traveler and guest. Far and near the people gathered to the costly banquet set, And exchanged congratulations with the English baronet; Till, the formal speeches ended, and amidst the laugh and wine, Some one spoke of Concha's lover,âheedless of the warning sign. Quickly then cried Sir George Simpson: âSpeak no ill of him, I pray! He is dead. He died, poor fellow, forty years ago this day,â âDied while speeding home to Russia, falling from a fractious horse. Left a sweetheart, too, they tell me. Married, I suppose, of course! âLives she yet?â A deathlike silence fell on banquet, guests, and hall, And a trembling figure rising fixed the awestruck gaze of all. Two black eyes in darkened orbits gleamed beneath the nun's white hood; Black serge hid the wasted figure, bowed and stricken where it stood. âLives she yet?â Sir George repeated. All were hushed as Concha drew Closer yet her nun's attire. âSeÃ±or, pardon, she died, too!â âFOR THE KINGâ (NORTHERN MEXICO, 1640) As you look from the plaza at Leon west You can see her house, but the view is best From the porch of the church where she lies at rest; Where much of her past still lives, I think, In the scowling brows and sidelong blink Of the worshiping throng that rise or sink To the waxen saints that, yellow and lank, Lean out from their niches, rank on rank, With a bloodless Saviour on either flank; In the gouty pillars, whose cracks begin To show the adobe core within,â A soul of earth in a whitewashed skin. And I think that the moral of all, you'll say, Is the sculptured legend that moulds away On a tomb in the choir: âPor el Rey.â âPor el Rey!â Well, the king is gone Ages ago, and the Hapsburg one Shotâbut the Rock of the Church lives on. âPor el Rey!â What matters, indeed, If king or president succeed To a country haggard with sloth and greed, As long as one granary is fat, And yonder priest, in a shovel hat, Peeps out from the bin like a sleek brown rat? What matters? Naught, if it serves to bring The legend nearer,âno other thing.â We'll spare the moral, âLive the king!â Two hundred years ago, they say, The Viceroy, Marquis of Monte-Rey, Rode with his retinue that way: Grave, as befitted Spain's grandee; Grave, as the substitute should be Of His Most Catholic Majesty; Yet, from his black plume's curving grace To his slim black gauntlet's smaller space, Exquisite as a piece of lace! Two hundred years agoâe'en soâ The Marquis stopped where the lime-trees blow, While Leon's seneschal bent him low, And begged that the Marquis would that night take His humble roof for the royal sake, And then, as the custom demanded, spake The usual wish, that his guest would hold The house, and all that it might enfold, As hisâwith the bride scarce three days old. Be sure that the Marquis, in his place, Replied to all with the measured grace Of chosen speech and unmoved face; Nor raised his head till his black plume swept The hem of the lady's robe, who kept Her place, as her husband backward stept. And then (I know not how nor why) A subtle flame in the lady's eyeâ Unseen by the courtiers standing byâ Burned through his lace and titled wreath, Burned through his body's jeweled sheath, Till it touched the steel of the man beneath! (And yet, mayhap, no more was meant Than to point a well-worn compliment, And the lady's beauty, her worst intent. Howbeit, the Marquis bowed again: âWho rules with awe well serveth Spain, But best whose law is love made plain.â Be sure that night no pillow prest The seneschal, but with the rest Watched, as was due a royal guest,â Watched from the wall till he saw the square Fill with the moonlight, white and bare,â Watched till he saw two shadows fare Out from his garden, where the shade That the old church tower and belfry made Like a benedictory hand was laid. Few words spoke the seneschal as he turned To his nearest sentry: âThese monks have learned That stolen fruit is sweetly earned. âMyself shall punish yon acolyte Who gathers my garden grapes by night; Meanwhile, wait thou till the morning light.â Yet not till the sun was riding high Did the sentry meet his commander's eye, Nor then till the Viceroy stood by. To the lovers of grave formalities No greeting was ever so fine, I wis, As this host's and guest's high courtesies! The seneschal feared, as the wind was west, A blast from Morena had chilled his rest; The Viceroy languidly confest That cares of state, andâhe dared to sayâ Some fears that the King could not repay The thoughtful zeal of his host, some way Had marred his rest. Yet he trusted much None shared his wakefulness; though such Indeed might be! If he dared to touch A theme so fineâthe bride, perchance, Still slept! At least, they missed her glance To give this greeting countenance. Be sure that the seneschal, in turn, Was deeply bowed with the grave concern Of the painful news his guest should learn; âLast night, to her father's dying bed By a priest was the lady summonÃ¨d; Nor know we yet how well she sped, âBut hope for the best.â The grave Viceroy (Though grieved his visit had such alloy) Must still wish the seneschal great joy Of a bride so true to her filial trust! Yet now, as the day waxed on, they must To horse, if they'd 'scape the noonday dust. âNay,â said the seneschal, âat least, To mend the news of this funeral priest, Myself shall ride as your escort east.â The Viceroy bowed. Then turned aside To his nearest follower: âWith me rideâ You and Felipeâon either side. âAnd list! Should anything me befall, Mischance of ambush or musket-ball, Cleave to his saddle yon seneschal! âNo more.â Then gravely in accents clear Took formal leave of his late good cheer; Whiles the seneschal whispered a musketeer, Carelessly stroking his pommel top: âIf from the saddle ye see me drop, Riddle me quickly yon solemn fop!â So these, with many a compliment, Each on his own dark thought intent, With grave politeness onward went, Riding high, and in sight of all, Viceroy, escort, and seneschal, Under the shade of the Almandral; Holding their secret hard and fast, Silent and grave they ride at last Into the dusty traveled Past. Even like this they passed away Two hundred years ago to-day. What of the lady? Who shall say? Do the souls of the dying ever yearn To some favored spot for the dust's return, For the homely peace of the family urn? I know not. Yet did the seneschal, Chancing in after-years to fall Pierced by a Flemish musket-ball, Call to his side a trusty friar, And bid him swear, as his last desire, To bear his corse to San Pedro's choir At Leon, where 'neath a shield azure Should his mortal frame find sepulture: This much, for the pains Christ did endure. Be sure that the friar loyally Fulfilled his trust by land and sea, Till the spires of Leon silently Rose through the green of the Almandral, As if to beckon the seneschal To his kindred dust 'neath the choir wall. I wot that the saints on either side Leaned from their niches open-eyed To see the doors of the church swing wide; That the wounds of the Saviour on either flank Bled fresh, as the mourners, rank by rank, Went by with the coffin, clank on clank. For why? When they raised the marble door Of the tomb, untouched for years before, The friar swooned on the choir floor; For there, in her laces and festal dress, Lay the dead man's wife, her loveliness Scarcely changed by her long duress,â As on the night she had passed away; Only that near her a dagger lay, With the written legend, âPor el Rey.â What was their greeting, the groom and bride, They whom that steel and the years divide? I know not. Here they lie side by side. Side by side! Though the king has his way, Even the dead at last have their day. Make you the moral. âPor el Rey!â RAMON (REFUGIO MINE, NORTHERN MEXICO) Drunk and senseless in his place, Prone and sprawling on his face, More like brute than any man Alive or dead, By his great pump out of gear, Lay the peon engineer, Waking only just to hear, Overhead, Angry tones that called his name, Oaths and cries of bitter blame,â Woke to hear all this, and, waking, turned and fled! âTo the man who'll bring to me,â Cried Intendant Harry Lee,â Harry Lee, the English foreman of the mine,â âBring the sot alive or dead, I will give to him,â he said, âFifteen hundred pesos down, Just to set the rascal's crown Underneath this heel of mine: Since but death Deserves the man whose deed, Be it vice or want of heed, Stops the pumps that give us breath,â Stops the pumps that suck the death From the poisoned lower levels of the mine!â No one answered; for a cry From the shaft rose up on high, And shuffling, scrambling, tumbling from below, Came the miners each, the bolder Mounting on the weaker's shoulder, Grappling, clinging to their hold or Letting go, As the weaker gasped and fell From the ladder to the well,â To the poisoned pit of hell Down below! âTo the man who sets them free,â Cried the foreman, Harry Lee,â Harry Lee, the English foreman of the mine,â âBrings them out and sets them free, I will give that man,â said he, âTwice that sum, who with a rope Face to face with Death shall cope. Let him come who dares to hope!â âHold your peace!â some one replied, Standing by the foreman's side; âThere has one already gone, whoe'er he be!â Then they held their breath with awe, Pulling on the rope, and saw Fainting figures reappear, On the black rope swinging clear, Fastened by some skillful hand from below; Till a score the level gained, And but one alone remained,â He the hero and the last, He whose skillful hand made fast The long line that brought them back to hope and cheer! Haggard, gasping, down dropped he At the feet of Harry Lee,â Harry Lee, the English foreman of the mine. âI have come,â he gasped, âto claim Both rewards. SeÃ±or, my name Is Ramon! I'm the drunken engineer, I'm the coward, SeÃ±orââHere He fell over, by that sign, Dead as stone! DON DIEGO OF THE SOUTH (REFECTORY, MISSION SAN GABRIEL, 1869) Goodâ!said the Padre,âbelieve me still, âDon Giovanni,â or what you will, The type's eternal! We knew him here As Don Diego del Sud. I fear The story's no new one! Will you hear? One of those spirits you can't tell why God has permitted. Therein I Have the advantage, for I hold That wolves are sent to the purest fold, And we'd save the wolf if we'd get the lamb. You're no believer? Good! I am. Well, for some purpose, I grant you dim, The Don loved women, and they loved him. Each thought herself his last love! Worst, Many believed that they were his first! And, such are these creatures since the Fall, The very doubt had a charm for all! You laugh! You are young, but Iâindeed I have no patience ... To proceed:â You saw, as you passed through the upper town, The Eucinal where the road goes down To San Felipe! There one morn They found Diego,âhis mantle torn. And as many holes through his doublet's band As there were wronged husbandsâyou understand! âDying,â so said the gossips. âDeadâ Was what the friars who found him said. May be. Quien sabe? Who else should know? It was a hundred years ago. There was a funeral. Small indeedâ Private. What would you? To proceed:â Scarcely the year had flown. One night The Commandante awoke in fright, Hearing below his casement's bar The well-known twang of the Don's guitar; And rushed to the window, just to see His wife a-swoon on the balcony. One week later, Don Juan Ramirez Found his own daughter, the DoÃ±a Inez, Pale as a ghost, leaning out to hear The song of that phantom cavalier. Even Alcalde Pedro Blas Saw, it was said, through his niece's glass, The shade of Diego twice repass. What these gentlemen each confessed Heaven and the Church only knows. At best The case was a bad one. How to deal With Sin as a Ghost, they could n't but feel Was an awful thing. Till a certain Fray Humbly offered to show the way. And the way was this. Did I say before That the Fray was a stranger? No, SeÃ±or? Strange! very strange! I should have said That the very week that the Don lay dead He came among us. Bread he broke Silent, nor ever to one he spoke. So he had vowed it! Below his brows His face was hidden. There are such vows! Strange! are they not? You do not use Snuff? A bad habit! Well, the views Of the Fray were these: that the penance done By the caballeros was right; but one Was due from the cause, and that, in brief, Was DoÃ±a Dolores Gomez, chief, And Inez, Sanchicha, Concepcion, And Carmen,âwell, half the girls in town On his tablets the Friar had written down. These were to come on a certain day And ask at the hands of the pious Fray For absolution. That done, small fear But the shade of Diego would disappear. They came; each knelt in her turn and place To the pious Fray with his hidden face And voiceless lips, and each again Took back her soul freed from spot or stain, Till the DoÃ±a Inez, with eyes downcast And a tear on their fringes, knelt her last. And thenâperhaps that her voice was low From fear or from shameâthe monks said soâ But the Fray leaned forward, when, presto! all Were thrilled by a scream, and saw her fall Fainting beside the confessional. And so was the ghost of Diego laid As the Fray had said. Never more his shade Was seen at San Gabriel's Mission. Eh! The girl interests you? I dare say! âNothing,â said she, when they brought her toâ âOnly a faintness!â They spoke more true Who said 't was a stubborn soul. But thenâ Women are women, and men are men! So, to return. As I said before, Having got the wolf, by the same high law We saved the lamb in the wolf's own jaw, And that's my moral. The tale, I fear, But poorly told. Yet it strikes me here Is stuff for a moral. What's your view? You smile, Don Pancho. Ah! that's like you! AT THE HACIENDA Know I not whom thou mayst be Carved upon this olive-tree,â âManuela of La Torre,ââ For around on broken walls Summer sun and spring rain falls, And in vain the low wind calls âManuela of La Torre.â Of that song no words remain But the musical refrain,â âManuela of La Torre.â Yet at night, when winds are still, Tinkles on the distant hill A guitar, and words that thrill Tell to me the old, old story,â Old when first thy charms were sung, Old when these old walls were young, âManuela of La Torre.â FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE It was the morning season of the year; It was the morning era of the land; The watercourses rang full loud and clear; Portala's cross stood where Portala's hand Had planted it when Faith was taught by Fear, When monks and missions held the sole command Of all that shore beside the peaceful sea, Where spring-tides beat their long-drawn reveille. Out of the mission of San Luis Rey, All in that brisk, tumultuous spring weather, Rode Friar Pedro, in a pious way, With six dragoons in cuirasses of leather, Each armed alike for either prayer or fray; Handcuffs and missals they had slung together, And as an aid the gospel truth to scatter Each swung a lassoâalias a âriata.â In sooth, that year the harvest had been slack, The crop of converts scarce worth computation; Some souls were lost, whose owners had turned back To save their bodies frequent flagellation; And some preferred the songs of birds, alack! To Latin matins and their souls' salvation, And thought their own wild whoopings were less dreary Than Father Pedro's droning miserere. To bring them back to matins and to prime, To pious works and secular submission, To prove to them that liberty was crime,â This was, in fact, the Padre's present mission; To get new souls perchance at the same time, And bring them to a âsense of their condition,ââ That easy phrase, which, in the past and present, Means making that condition most unpleasant. He saw the glebe land guiltless of a furrow; He saw the wild oats wrestle on the hill; He saw the gopher working in his burrow; He saw the squirrel scampering at his will:â He saw all this, and felt no doubt a thorough And deep conviction of God's goodness; still He failed to see that in His glory He Yet left the humblest of His creatures free. He saw the flapping crow, whose frequent note Voiced the monotony of land and sky, Mocking with graceless wing and rusty coat His priestly presence as he trotted by. He would have cursed the bird by bell and rote, But other game just then was in his eye,â A savage camp, whose occupants preferred Their heathen darkness to the living Word. He rang his bell, and at the martial sound Twelve silver spurs their jingling rowels clashed; Six horses sprang across the level ground As six dragoons in open order dashed; Above their heads the lassos circled round, In every eye a pious fervor flashed; They charged the camp, and in one moment more They lassoed six and reconverted four. The Friar saw the conflict from a knoll, And sang Laus Deo and cheered on his men: âWell thrown, Bautista,âthat's another soul; After him, Gomez,âtry it once again; This way, Felipe,âthere the heathen stole; Bones of St. Francis!âsurely that makes ten; Te Deum laudamusâbut they're very wild; Non nobis Domineâall right, my child!â When at that momentâas the story goesâ A certain squaw, who had her foes eluded, Ran past the Friar, just before his nose. He stared a moment, and in silence brooded; Then in his breast a pious frenzy rose And every other prudent thought excluded; He caught a lasso, and dashed in a canter After that Occidental Atalanta. High o'er his head he swirled the dreadful noose; But, as the practice was quite unfamiliar, His first cast tore Felipe's captive loose, And almost choked Tiburcio Camilla, And might have interfered with that brave youth's Ability to gorge the tough tortilla; But all things come by practice, and at last His flying slip-knot caught the maiden fast. Then rose above the plain a mingled yell Of rage and triumph,âa demoniac whoop: The Padre heard it like a passing knell, And would have loosened his unchristian loop; But the tough raw-hide held the captive well, And held, alas! too well the captor-dupe; For with one bound the savage fled amain, Dragging horse, Friar, down the lonely plain. Down the arroyo, out across the mead, By heath and hollow, sped the flying maid, Dragging behind her still the panting steed And helpless Friar, who in vain essayed To cut the lasso or to check his speed. He felt himself beyond all human aid, And trusted to the saints,âand, for that matter, To some weak spot in Felipe's riata. Alas! the lasso had been duly blessed, And, like baptism, held the flying wretch,â A doctrine that the priest had oft expressed, Which, like the lasso, might be made to stretch, But would not break; so neither could divest Themselves of it, but, like some awful fetch, The holy Friar had to recognize The image of his fate in heathen guise. He saw the glebe land guiltless of a furrow; He saw the wild oats wrestle on the hill; He saw the gopher standing in his burrow; He saw the squirrel scampering at his will:â He saw all this, and felt no doubt how thorough The contrast was to his condition; still The squaw kept onward to the sea, till night And the cold sea-fog hid them both from sight. The morning came above the serried coast, Lighting the snow-peaks with its beacon-fires, Driving before it all the fleet-winged host Of chattering birds above the Mission spires, Filling the land with light and joy, but most The savage woods with all their leafy lyres; In pearly tints and opal flame and fire The morning came, but not the holy Friar. Weeks passed away. In vain the Fathers sought Some trace or token that might tell his story; Some thought him dead, or, like Elijah, caught Up to the heavens in a blaze of glory. In this surmise some miracles were wrought On his account, and souls in purgatory Were thought to profit from his intercession; In brief, his absence made a âdeep impression.â A twelvemonth passed; the welcome Spring once more Made green the hills beside the white-faced Mission, Spread her bright dais by the western shore, And sat enthroned, a most resplendent vision. The heathen converts thronged the chapel door At morning mass, when, says the old tradition, A frightful whoop throughout the church resounded, And to their feet the congregation bounded. A tramp of hoofs upon the beaten course, Then came a sight that made the bravest quail: A phantom Friar on a spectre horse, Dragged by a creature decked with horns and tail. By the lone Mission, with the whirlwind's force, They madly swept, and left a sulphurous trail: And that was all,âenough to tell the story, And leave unblessed those souls in purgatory. And ever after, on that fatal day That Friar Pedro rode abroad lassoing, A ghostly couple came and went away With savage whoop and heathenish hallooing, Which brought discredit on San Luis Rey, And proved the Mission's ruin and undoing; For ere ten years had passed, the squaw and Friar Performed to empty walls and fallen spire. The Mission is no more; upon its walls The golden lizards slip, or breathless pause, Still as the sunshine brokenly that falls Through crannied roof and spider-webs of gauze; No more the bell its solemn warning calls,â A holier silence thrills and overawes; And the sharp lights and shadows of to-day Outline the Mission of San Luis Rey. IN THE MISSION GARDEN (1865) FATHER FELIPE I speak not the English well, but Pachita, She speak for me; is it not so, my Pancha? Eh, little rogue? Come, salute me the stranger Americano. Sir, in my country we say, âWhere the heart is, There live the speech.â Ah! you not understand? So! Pardon an old man,âwhat you call âold fogy,ââ Padre Felipe! Old, SeÃ±or, old! just so old as the Mission. You see that pear-tree? How old you think, SeÃ±or? Fifteen year? Twenty? Ah, SeÃ±or, just fifty Gone since I plant him! You like the wine? It is some at the Mission, Made from the grape of the year eighteen hundred; All the same time when the earthquake he come to San Juan Bautista. But Pancha is twelve, and she is the rose-tree; And I am the olive, and this is the garden: And âPanchaâ we say, but her name is âFrancisca,â Same like her mother. Eh, you knew her? No? Ah! it is a story; But I speak not, like Pachita, the English: So! if I try, you will sit here beside me, And shall not laugh, eh? When the American come to the Mission, Many arrive at the house of Francisca: One,âhe was fine man,âhe buy the cattle Of JosÃ© Castro. So! he came much, and Francisca, she saw him: And it was love,âand a very dry season; And the pears bake on the tree,âand the rain come, But not Francisca. Not for one year; and one night I have walk much Under the olive-tree, when comes Francisca,â Comes to me here, with her child, this Francisca,â Under the olive-tree. Sir, it was sad; ... but I speak not the English; So! ... she stay here, and she wait for her husband: He come no more, and she sleep on the hillside; There stands Pachita. Ah! there's the Angelus. Will you not enter? Or shall you walk in the garden with Pancha? Go, little rogueâst! attend to the stranger! Adios, SeÃ±or. PACHITA (briskly). So, he's been telling that yarn about mother! Bless you! he tells it to every stranger: Folks about yer say the old man's my father; What's your opinion? THE LOST GALLEON As the custom on which the central incident of this legend is based may not be familiar to all readers, I will repeat here that it is the habit of navigators to drop a day from their calendar in crossing westerly the 180th degree of longitude of Greenwich, adding a day in coming east; and that the idea of the lost galleon had an origin as prosaic as the log of the first China Mail Steamer from San Francisco. The explanation of the custom and its astronomical relations belongs rather to the usual text-books than to poetical narration. If any reader thinks I have overdrawn the credulous superstitions of the ancient navigators, I refer him to the veracious statements of Maldonado, De FontÃ©, the later voyages of La Perouse and Anson, and the charts of 1640. In the charts of that day Spanish navigators reckoned longitude E. 360 degrees from the meridian of the Isle of Ferro. For the sake of perspicuity before a modern audience, the more recent meridian of Madrid was substituted. The custom of dropping a day at some arbitrary point in crossing the Pacific westerly, I need not say, remains unaffected by any change of meridian. I know not if any galleon was ever really missing. For two hundred and fifty years an annual trip was made between Acapulco and Manila. It may be some satisfaction to the more severely practical of my readers to know that, according to the best statistics of insurance, the loss during that period would be exactly three vessels and six hundredths of a vessel, which would certainly justify me in this summary disposition of one. In sixteen hundred and forty-one, The regular yearly galleon, Laden with odorous gums and spice, India cottons and India rice, And the richest silks of far Cathay, Was due at Acapulco Bay. Due she was, and overdue,â Galleon, merchandise, and crew, Creeping along through rain and shine, Through the tropics, under the line. The trains were waiting outside the walls, The wives of sailors thronged the town, The traders sat by their empty stalls, And the Viceroy himself came down; The bells in the tower were all a-trip, Te Deums were on each Father's lip, The limes were ripening in the sun For the sick of the coming galleon. All in vain. Weeks passed away, And yet no galleon saw the bay. India goods advanced in price; The Governor missed his favorite spice; The SeÃ±oritas mourned for sandal And the famous cottons of Coromandel; And some for an absent lover lost, And one for a husband,âDoÃ±a Julia, Wife of the captain tempest-tossed, In circumstances so peculiar; Even the Fathers, unawares, Grumbled a little at their prayers; And all along the coast that year Votive candles were scarce and dear. Never a tear bedims the eye That time and patience will not dry; Never a lip is curved with pain That can't be kissed into smiles again; And these same truths, as far as I know, Obtained on the coast of Mexico More than two hundred years ago, In sixteen hundred and fifty-one,â Ten years after the deed was done,â And folks had forgotten the galleon: The divers plunged in the gulf for pearls, White as the teeth of the Indian girls; The traders sat by their full bazaars; The mules with many a weary load, And oxen dragging their creaking cars, Came and went on the mountain road. Where was the galleon all this while? Wrecked on some lonely coral isle, Burnt by the roving sea-marauders, Or sailing north under secret orders? Had she found the Anian passage famed, By lying Maldonado claimed, And sailed through the sixty-fifth degree Direct to the North Atlantic Sea? Or had she found the âRiver of Kings,â Of which De Fonte told such strange things, In sixteen forty? Never a sign, East or west or under the line, They saw of the missing galleon; Never a sail or plank or chip They found of the long-lost treasure-ship, Or enough to build a tale upon. But when she was lost, and where and how, Are the facts we're coming to just now. Take, if you please, the chart of that day, Published at Madrid,âpor el Rey; Look for a spot in the old South Sea, The hundred and eightieth degree Longitude west of Madrid: there, Under the equatorial glare, Just where the east and west are one, You'll find the missing galleon,â You'll find the San Gregorio, yet Riding the seas, with sails all set, Fresh as upon the very day She sailed from Acapulco Bay. How did she get there? What strange spell Kept her two hundred years so well, Free from decay and mortal taint? What but the prayers of a patron saint! A hundred leagues from Manilla town, The San Gregorio's helm came down; Round she went on her heel, and not A cable's length from a galliot That rocked on the waters just abreast Of the galleon's course, which was west-sou'-west. Then said the galleon's commandante, General Pedro Sobriente (That was his rank on land and main, A regular custom of Old Spain), âMy pilot is dead of scurvy: may I ask the longitude, time, and day?â The first two given and compared; The thirdâthe commandante stared! âThe first of June? I make it second.â Said the stranger, âThen you've wrongly reckoned; I make it first: as you came this way, You should have lost, d' ye see, a day; Lost a day, as plainly see, On the hundred and eightieth degree.â âLost a day?â âYes; if not rude, When did you make east longitude?â âOn the ninth of May,âour patron's day.â âOn the ninth?âyou had no ninth of May! Eighth and tenth was there; but stayââ Too late; for the galleon bore away. Lost was the day they should have kept, Lost unheeded and lost unwept; Lost in a way that made search vain, Lost in a trackless and boundless main; Lost like the day of Job's awful curse, In his third chapter, third and fourth verse; Wrecked was their patron's only day,â What would the holy Fathers say? Said the Fray Antonio Estavan, The galleon's chaplain,âa learned man,â âNothing is lost that you can regain; And the way to look for a thing is plain, To go where you lost it, back again. Back with your galleon till you see The hundred and eightieth degree. Wait till the rolling year goes round, And there will the missing day be found; For you'll find, if computation's true, That sailing East will give to you Not only one ninth of May, but two,â One for the good saint's present cheer, And one for the day we lost last year.â Back to the spot sailed the galleon; Where, for a twelvemonth, off and on The hundred and eightieth degree She rose and fell on a tropic sea. But lo! when it came to the ninth of May, All of a sudden becalmed she lay One degree from that fatal spot, Without the power to move a knot; And of course the moment she lost her way, Gone was her chance to save that day. To cut a lengthening story short, She never saved it. Made the sport Of evil spirits and baffling wind, She was always before or just behind, One day too soon or one day too late, And the sun, meanwhile, would never wait. She had two Eighths, as she idly lay, Two Tenths, but never a Ninth of May; And there she rides through two hundred years Of dreary penance and anxious fears; Yet, through the grace of the saint she served, Captain and crew are still preserved. By a computation that still holds good, Made by the Holy Brotherhood, The San Gregorio will cross that line In nineteen hundred and thirty-nine: Just three hundred years to a day From the time she lost the ninth of May. And the folk in Acapulco town, Over the waters looking down, Will see in the glow of the setting sun The sails of the missing galleon, And the royal standard of Philip Rey, The gleaming mast and glistening spar, As she nears the surf of the outer bar. A Te Deum sung on her crowded deck, An odor of spice along the shore, A crash, a cry from a shattered wreck,â And the yearly galleon sails no more In or out of the olden bay; For the blessed patron has found his day. Such is the legend. Hear this truth: Over the trackless past, somewhere, Lie the lost days of our tropic youth, Only regained by faith and prayer, Only recalled by prayer and plaint: Each lost day has its patron saint! III. IN DIALECT âJIMâ Say there! P'r'aps Some on you chaps Might know Jim Wild? Well,âno offense: Thar ain't no sense In gittin' riled! Jim was my chum Up on the Bar: That's why I come Down from up yar, Lookin' for Jim. Thank ye, sir! You Ain't of that crew,â Blest if you are! Money? Not much: That ain't my kind; I ain't no such. Rum? I don't mind, Seein' it's you. Well, this yer Jim,â Did you know him? Jes' 'bout your size; Same kind of eyes;â Well, that is strange: Why, it's two year Since he came here, Sick, for a change. Well, here's to us: Eh? The h? you say! Dead? That little cuss? What makes you star', You over thar? Can't a man drop 's glass in yer shop But you must r'ar? It would n't take D?d much to break You and your bar. Dead! PoorâlittleâJim! Why, thar was me, Jones, and Bob Lee, Harry and Ben,â No-account men: Then to take him! Well, tharâGood-byâ No more, sirâIâ Eh? What's that you say? Why, dern it!âsho!â No? Yes! By Joe! Sold! Sold! Why, you limb, You ornery, Derned old Long-legged Jim. CHIQUITA Beautiful! Sir, you may say so. Thar is n't her match in the county; Is thar, old gal,âChiquita, my darling, my beauty? Feel of that neck, sir,âthar's velvet! Whoa! steady,âah, will you, you vixen! Whoa! I say. Jack, trot her out; let the gentleman look at her paces. Morgan!âshe ain't nothing else, and I've got the papers to prove it. Sired by Chippewa Chief, and twelve hundred dollars won't buy her. Briggs of Tuolumne owned her. Did you know Briggs of Tuolumne? Busted hisself in White Pine, and blew out his brains down in 'Frisco? Hed n't no savey, hed Briggs. Thar, Jack! that'll do,âquit that foolin'! Nothin' to what she kin do, when she's got her work cut out before her. Hosses is hosses, you know, and likewise, too, jockeys is jockeys: And 't ain't ev'ry man as can ride as knows what a hoss has got in him. Know the old ford on the Fork, that nearly got Flanigan's leaders? Nasty in daylight, you bet, and a mighty rough ford in low water! Well, it ain't six weeks ago that me and the Jedge and his nevey Struck for that ford in the night, in the rain, and the water all round us; Up to our flanks in the gulch, and Rattlesnake Creek just a-billin', Not a plank left in the dam, and nary a bridge on the river. I had the gray, and the Jedge had his roan, and his nevey, Chiquita; And after us trundled the rocks jest loosed from the top of the caÃ±on. Lickity, lickity, switch, we came to the ford, and Chiquita Buckled right down to her work, and, afore I could yell to her rider, Took water jest at the ford, and there was the Jedge and me standing, And twelve hundred dollars of hoss-flesh afloat, and a-driftin' to thunder! Would ye b'lieve it? That night, that hoss, that 'ar filly, Chiquita, Walked herself into her stall, and stood there, all quiet and dripping: Clean as a beaver or rat, with nary a buckle of harness, Just as she swam the Fork,âthat hoss, that 'ar filly, Chiquita. That's what I call a hoss! andâWhat did you say?âOh, the nevey? Drownded, I reckon,âleastways, he never kem back to deny it. Ye see the derned fool had no seat, ye could n't have made him a rider; And then, ye know, boys will be boys, and hossesâwell, hosses is hosses! DOW'S FLAT (1856) Dow's Flat. That's its name; And I reckon that you Are a stranger? The same? Well, I thought it was true.â For thar is n't a man on the river as can't spot the place at first view. It was called after Dow,â Which the same was an ass,â And as to the how Thet the thing kem to pass,â Jest tie up your hoss to that buckeye, and sit ye down here in the grass. You see this 'yer Dow Hed the worst kind of luck; He slipped up somehow On each thing thet he struck. Why, ef he'd a straddled thet fence-rail, the derned thing 'd get up and buck. He mined on the bar Till he could n't pay rates; He was smashed by a car When he tunneled with Bates; And right on the top of his trouble kem his wife and five kids from the States. It was rough,âmighty rough; But the boys they stood by, And they brought him the stuff For a house, on the sly; And the old woman,âwell, she did washing, and took on when no one was nigh. But this 'yer luck of Dow's Was so powerful mean That the spring near his house Dried right up on the green; And he sunk forty feet down for water, but nary a drop to be seen. Then the bar petered out, And the boys would n't stay; And the chills got about, And his wife fell away; But Dow in his well kept a peggin' in his usual ridikilous way. One day,âit was June,â And a year ago, jestâ This Dow kem at noon To his work like the rest, With a shovel and pick on his shoulder, and derringer hid in his breast. He goes to the well, And he stands on the brink, And stops for a spell Jest to listen and think: For the sun in his eyes (jest like this, sir!), you see, kinder made the cuss blink. His two ragged gals In the gulch were at play, And a gownd that was Sal's Kinder flapped on a bay: Not much for a man to be leavin', but his all,âas I've heer'd the folks say. AndâThat's a peart hoss Thet you've got,âain't it now? What might be her cost? Eh? Oh!âWell, then, Dowâ Let's see,âwell, that forty-foot grave was n't his, sir, that day, anyhow. For a blow of his pick Sorter caved in the side, And he looked and turned sick, Then he trembled and cried. For you see the dern cuss had struckââWater?ââBeg your parding, young man,âthere you lied! It was gold,âin the quartz, And it ran all alike; And I reckon five oughts Was the worth of that strike; And that house with the coopilow's his'n,âwhich the same is n't bad for a Pike. Thet's why it's Dow's Flat; And the thing of it is That he kinder got that Through sheer contrairiness: For 't was water the derned cuss was seekin', and his luck made him certain to miss. Thet's so! Thar's your way, To the left of yon tree; Butâaâlook h'yur, say? Won't you come up to tea? No? Well, then the next time you're passin'; and ask after Dow,âand thet's me. IN THE TUNNEL Did n't know Flynn,â Flynn of Virginia,â Long as he's been 'yar? Look 'ee here, stranger, Whar hev you been? Here in this tunnel He was my pardner, That same Tom Flynn,â Working together, In wind and weather, Day out and in. Did n't know Flynn! Well, that is queer; Why, it's a sin To think of Tom Flynn,â Tom with his cheer, Tom without fear,â Stranger, look 'yar! Thar in the drift, Back to the wall, He held the timbers Ready to fall; Then in the darkness I heard him call: âRun for your life, Jake! Run for your wife's sake! Don't wait for me.â And that was all Heard in the din, Heard of Tom Flynn,â Flynn of Virginia. That's all about Flynn of Virginia. That lets me out. Here in the damp,â Out of the sun,â That 'ar derned lamp Makes my eyes run. Well, there,âI'm done! But, sir, when you'll Hear the next fool Asking of Flynn,â Flynn of Virginia,â Just you chip in, Say you knew Flynn; Say that you've been 'yar. âCICELYâ (ALKALI STATION) Cicely says you're a poet; maybe,âI ain't much on rhyme: I reckon you'd give me a hundred, and beat me every time. Poetry!âthat's the way some chaps puts up an idee, But I takes mine âstraight without sugar,â and that's what's the matter with me. Poetry!âjust look round you,âalkali, rock, and sage; Sage-brush, rock, and alkali; ain't it a pretty page! Sun in the east at mornin', sun in the west at night, And the shadow of this 'yer station the on'y thing moves in sight. Poetry!âWell nowâPolly! Polly, run to your mam; Run right away, my pooty! By-by! Ain't she a lamb? Poetry!âthat reminds me o' suthin' right in that suit: Jest shet that door thar, will yer?âfor Cicely's ears is cute. Ye noticed Polly,âthe baby? A month afore she was born, Cicelyâmy old womanâwas moody-like and forlorn; Out of her head and crazy, and talked of flowers and trees; Family man yourself, sir? Well, you know what a woman be's. Narvous she was, and restless,âsaid that she âcould n't stay.â Stay!âand the nearest woman seventeen miles away. But I fixed it up with the doctor, and he said he would be on hand, And I kinder stuck by the shanty, and fenced in that bit o' land. One night,âthe tenth of October,âI woke with a chill and a fright, For the door it was standing open, and Cicely warn't in sight, But a note was pinned on the blanket, which it said that she âcould n't stay,â But had gone to visit her neighbor,âseventeen miles away! When and how she stampeded, I did n't wait for to see, For out in the road, next minit, I started as wild as she; Running first this way and that way, like a hound that is off the scent, For there warn't no track in the darkness to tell me the way she went. I've had some mighty mean moments afore I kem to this spot,â Lost on the Plains in '50, drownded almost and shot; But out on this alkali desert, a-hunting a crazy wife, Was ra'ly as on-satis-factory as anything in my life. âCicely! Cicely! Cicely!â I called, and I held my breath, And âCicely!â came from the canyon,âand all was as still as death. And âCicely! Cicely! Cicely!â came from the rocks below, And jest but a whisper of âCicely!â down from them peaks of snow. I ain't what you call religious,âbut I jest looked up to the sky, Andâthis 'yer's to what I'm coming, and maybe ye think I lie: But up away to the east'ard, yaller and big and far, I saw of a suddent rising the singlerist kind of star. Big and yaller and dancing, it seemed to beckon to me: Yaller and big and dancing, such as you never see: Big and yaller and dancing,âI never saw such a star, And I thought of them sharps in the Bible, and I went for it then and thar. Over the brush and bowlders I stumbled and pushed ahead: Keeping the star afore me, I went wherever it led. It might hev been for an hour, when suddent and peart and nigh, Out of the yearth afore me thar riz up a baby's cry. Listen! thar's the same music; but her lungs they are stronger now Than the day I packed her and her mother,âI'm derned if I jest know how. But the doctor kem the next minit, and the joke o' the whole thing is That Cis never knew what happened from that very night to this! But Cicely says you're a poet, and maybe you might, some day, Jest sling her a rhyme 'bout a baby that was born in a curious way, And see what she says; and, old fellow, when you speak of the star, don't tell As how 't was the doctor's lantern,âfor maybe 't won't sound so well. PENELOPE (SIMPSON'S BAR, 1858) So you've kem 'yer agen, And one answer won't do? Well, of all the derned men That I've struck, it is you. O Sal! 'yer's that derned fool from Simpson's, cavortin' round 'yer in the dew. Kem in, ef you will. Thar,âquit! Take a cheer. Not that; you can't fill Them theer cushings this year,â For that cheer was my old man's, Joe Simpson, and they don't make such men about 'yer. He was tall, was my Jack, And as strong as a tree. Thar's his gun on the rack,â Jest you heft it, and see. And you come a courtin' his widder! Lord! where can that critter, Sal, be! You'd fill my Jack's place? And a man of your size,â With no baird to his face, Nor a snap to his eyes, And naryâSho! thar! I was foolin',âI was, Joe, for sartain,âdon't rise. Sit down. Law! why, sho! I'm as weak as a gal. Sal! Don't you go, Joe, Or I'll faint,âsure, I shall. Sit down,âanywheer, where you like, Joe,âin that cheer, if you choose,âLord! where's Sal? PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES (TABLE MOUNTAIN, 1870) Which I wish to remark, And my language is plain, That for ways that are dark And for tricks that are vain, The heathen Chinee is peculiar, Which the same I would rise to explain. Ah Sin was his name; And I shall not deny, In regard to the same, What that name might imply; But his smile it was pensive and childlike, As I frequent remarked to Bill Nye. It was August the third, And quite soft was the skies; Which it might be inferred That Ah Sin was likewise; Yet he played it that day upon William And me in a way I despise. Which we had a small game, And Ah Sin took a hand: It was Euchre. The same He did not understand; But he smiled as he sat by the table, With the smile that was childlike and bland. Yet the cards they were stocked In a way that I grieve, And my feelings were shocked At the state of Nye's sleeve, Which was stuffed full of aces and bowers, And the same with intent to deceive. But the hands that were played By that heathen Chinee, And the points that he made, Were quite frightful to see,â Till at last he put down a right bower, Which the same Nye had dealt unto me. Then I looked up at Nye, And he gazed upon me; And he rose with a sigh, And said, âCan this be? We are ruined by Chinese cheap labor,ââ And he went for that heathen Chinee. In the scene that ensued I did not take a hand, But the floor it was strewed Like the leaves on the strand With the cards that Ah Sin had been hiding, In the game âhe did not understand.â In his sleeves, which were long, He had twenty-four packs,â Which was coming it strong, Yet I state but the facts; And we found on his nails, which were taper, What is frequent in tapers,âthat's wax. Which is why I remark, And my language is plain, That for ways that are dark And for tricks that are vain, The heathen Chinee is peculiar,â Which the same I am free to maintain. THE SOCIETY UPON THE STANISLAUS I reside at Table Mountain, and my name is Truthful James; I am not up to small deceit or any sinful games; And I'll tell in simple language what I know about the row That broke up our Society upon the Stanislow. But first I would remark, that it is not a proper plan For any scientific gent to whale his fellow-man, And, if a member don't agree with his peculiar whim, To lay for that same member for to âput a headâ on him. Now nothing could be finer or more beautiful to see Than the first six months' proceedings of that same Society, Till Brown of Calaveras brought a lot of fossil bones That he found within a tunnel near the tenement of Jones. Then Brown he read a paper, and he reconstructed there, From those same bones, an animal that was extremely rare; And Jones then asked the Chair for a suspension of the rules, Till he could prove that those same bones was one of his lost mules. Then Brown he smiled a bitter smile, and said he was at fault, It seemed he had been trespassing on Jones's family vault; He was a most sarcastic man, this quiet Mr. Brown, And on several occasions he had cleaned out the town. Now I hold it is not decent for a scientific gent To say another is an ass,âat least, to all intent; Nor should the individual who happens to be meant Reply by heaving rocks at him, to any great extent. Then Abner Dean of Angel's raised a point of order, when A chunk of old red sandstone took him in the abdomen, And he smiled a kind of sickly smile, and curled up on the floor, And the subsequent proceedings interested him no more. For, in less time than I write it, every member did engage In a warfare with the remnants of a palÃ¦ozoic age; And the way they heaved those fossils in their anger was a sin, Till the skull of an old mammoth caved the head of Thompson in. And this is all I have to say of these improper games, For I live at Table Mountain, and my name is Truthful James; And I've told in simple language what I know about the row That broke up our Society upon the Stanislow. LUKE (IN THE COLORADO PARK, 1873) Wot's that you're readin'?âa novel? A novel!âwell, darn my skin! You a man grown and bearded and histin' such stuff ez that inâ Stuff about gals and their sweethearts! No wonder you're thin ez a knife. Look at me!âclar two hundredâand never read one in my life! That's my opinion o' novels. And ez to their lyin' round here, They belong to the Jedge's daughterâthe Jedge who came up last year On account of his lungs and the mountains and the balsam o' pine and fir; And his daughterâwell, she read novels, and that's what's the matter with her. Yet she was sweet on the Jedge, and stuck by him day and night, Alone in the cabin up 'yerâtill she grew like a ghost, all white. She wus only a slip of a thing, ez light and ez up and away Ez rifle smoke blown through the woods, but she was n't my kindâno way! Speakin' o' gals, d'ye mind that house ez you rise the hill, A mile and a half from White's, and jist above Mattingly's mill? You do? Well now thar's a gal! What! you saw her? Oh, come now, thar! quit! She was only bedevlin' you boys, for to me she don't cotton one bit. Now she's what I call a galâez pretty and plump ez a quail; Teeth ez white ez a hound's, and they'd go through a ten-penny nail; Eyes that kin snap like a cap. So she asked to know âwhar I was hid?â She did! Oh, it's jist like her sass, for she's peart ez a Katydid. But what was I talking of?âOh! the Jedge and his daughterâshe read Novels the whole day long, and I reckon she read them abed; And sometimes she read them out loud to the Jedge on the porch where he sat, And 't was how âLord Augustusâ said this, and how âLady Blancheâ she said that. But the sickest of all that I heerd was a yarn thet they read 'bout a chap, âLeather-stockingâ by name, and a hunter chock full o' the greenest o' sap; And they asked me to hear, but I says, âMiss Mabel, not any for me; When I likes I kin sling my own lies, and thet chap and I should n't agree.â Yet somehow or other that gal allus said that I brought her to mind Of folks about whom she had read, or suthin belike of thet kind, And thar warn't no end o' the names that she give me thet summer up hereâ âRobin Hood,â âLeather-stocking,â âRob Roy,ââOh, I tell you, the critter was queer! And yet, ef she had n't been spiled, she was harmless enough in her way; She could jabber in French to her dad, and they said that she knew how to play; And she worked me that shot-pouch up thar, which the man does n't live ez kin use; And slippersâyou see 'em down 'yerâez would cradle an Injin's papoose. Yet along o' them novels, you see, she was wastin' and mopin' away, And then she got shy with her tongue, and at last she had nothin' to say; And whenever I happened around, her face it was hid by a book, And it warn't till the day she left that she give me ez much ez a look. And this was the way it was. It was night when I kem up here To say to 'em all âgood-by,â for I reckoned to go for deer At âsun upâ the day they left. So I shook 'em all round by the hand, 'Cept Mabel, and she was sick, ez they give me to understand. But jist ez I passed the house next morning at dawn, some one, Like a little waver o' mist got up on the hill with the sun; Miss Mabel it was, aloneâall wrapped in a mantle o' laceâ And she stood there straight in the road, with a touch o' the sun in her face. And she looked me right in the eyeâI'd seen suthin' like it before When I hunted a wounded doe to the edge o' the Clear Lake Shore, And I had my knee on its neck, and I jist was raisin' my knife, When it give me a look like that, andâwell, it got off with its life. âWe are going to-day,â she said, âand I thought I would say good-by To you in your own house, Lukeâthese woods and the bright blue sky! You've always been kind to us, Luke, and papa has found you still As good as the air he breathes, and wholesome as Laurel Tree Hill. âAnd we'll always think of you, Luke, as the thing we could not take away,â The balsam that dwells in the woods, the rainbow that lives in the spray. And you'll sometimes think of me, Luke, as you know you once used to say, A rifle smoke blown through the woods, a moment, but never to stay.â And then we shook hands. She turned, but a-suddent she tottered and fell, And I caught her sharp by the waist, and held her a minit. Well, It was only a minit, you know, thet ez cold and ez white she lay Ez a snowflake here on my breast, and thenâwell, she melted awayâ And was gone. ... And thar are her books; but I says not any for me; Good enough may be for some, but them and I might n't agree. They spiled a decent gal ez might hev made some chap a wife, And look at me!âclar two hundredâand never read one in my life! âTHE BABES IN THE WOODSâ (BIG PINE FLAT, 1871) âSomething characteristic,â eh? Humph! I reckon you mean by that Something that happened in our way, Here at the crossin' of Big Pine Flat. Times are n't now as they used to be, When gold was flush and the boys were frisky, And a man would pull out his battery For anythingâmaybe the price of whiskey. Nothing of that sort, eh? That's strange! Why, I thought you might be diverted Hearing how Jones of Red Rock Range Drawed his âhint to the unconverted,â And saying, âWhar will you have it?â shot Cherokee Bob at the last debating! What was the question I forgot, But Jones did n't like Bob's way of stating. Nothing of that kind, eh? You mean Something milder? Let's see!âO Joe! Tell to the stranger that little scene Out of the âBabes in the Woods.â You know, âBabesâ was the name that we gave 'em, sir, Two lean lads in their teens, and greener Than even the belt of spruce and fir Where they built their nest, and each day grew leaner. No one knew where they came from. None Cared to ask if they had a mother. Runaway schoolboys, maybe. One Tall and dark as a spruce; the other Blue and gold in the eyes and hair Soft and low in his speech, but rarely Talking with us; and we did n't care To get at their secret at all unfairly. For they were so quiet, so sad and shy, Content to trust each other solely, That somehow we'd always shut one eye, And never seem to observe them wholly As they passed to their work. 'T was a worn-out claim, And it paid them grub. They could live without it, For the boys had a way of leaving game In their tent, and forgetting all about it. Yet no one asked for their secret. Dumb It lay in their big eyes' heavy hollows. It was understood that no one should come To their tent unawares, save the bees and swallows. So they lived alone. Until one warm night I was sitting here at the tent-door,âso, sir! When out of the sunset's rosy light Up rose the Sheriff of Mariposa. I knew at once there was something wrong, For his hand and his voice shook just a little, And there is n't much you can fetch along To make the sinews of Jack Hill brittle. âGo warn the Babes!â he whispered, hoarse; âTell them I'm comingâto get and scurry; For I've got a story that's bad,âand worse, I've got a warrant: Gâd dân it, hurry!â Too late! they had seen him cross the hill; I ran to their tent and found them lying Dead in each other's arms, and still Clasping the drug they had taken flying. And there lay their secret cold and bare, Their life, their trialâthe old, old story! For the sweet blue eyes and the golden hair Was a woman's shame and a woman's glory. âWho were they?â Ask no more, or ask The sun that visits their grave so lightly; Ask of the whispering reeds, or task The mourning crickets that chirrup nightly. All of their life but its love forgot, Everything tender and soft and mystic, These are our Babes in the Woods,âyou've got, Wellâhuman natureâthat's characteristic. THE LATEST CHINESE OUTRAGE It was noon by the sun; we had finished our game, And was passin' remarks goin' back to our claim; Jones was countin' his chips, Smith relievin' his mind Of ideas that a âstraightâ should beat âthree of a kind,â When Johnson of Elko came gallopin' down, With a look on his face 'twixt a grin and a frown, And he calls, âDrop your shovels and face right about, For them Chinees from Murphy's are cleanin' us outâ With their ching-a-ring-chow And their chic-colorow They're bent upon making No slouch of a row.â Then Jonesâmy own pardnerâlooks up with a sigh; âIt's your wash-bill,â sez he, and I answers, âYou lie!â But afore he could draw or the others could arm, Up tumbles the Bates boys, who heard the alarm. And a yell from the hill-top and roar of a gong, Mixed up with remarks like âHi! yi! Chang-a-wong,â And bombs, shells, and crackers, that crashed through the trees, Revealed in their war-togs four hundred Chinees! Four hundred Chinee; We are eight, don't ye see! That made a square fifty To just one o' we. They were dressed in their best, but I grieve that that same Was largely made up of our own, to their shame; And my pardner's best shirt and his trousers were hung On a spear, and above him were tauntingly swung; While that beggar, Chey Lee, like a conjurer sat Pullin' out eggs and chickens from Johnson's best hat; And Bates's game rooster was part of their âloot,â And all of Smith's pigs were skyugled to boot; But the climax was reached and I like to have died When my demijohn, empty, came down the hillside,â Down the hillsideâ What once held the pride Of Robertson County Pitched down the hillside! Then we axed for a parley. When out of the din To the front comes a-rockin' that heathen, Ah Sin! âYou owe flowty dolleeâme washee you camp, You catchee my washeeâme catchee no stamp; One dollar hap dozen, me no catchee yet, Now that flowty dolleeâno hab?âhow can get? Me catchee you piggeeâme sellee for cash, It catchee me liceeâyou catchee no âhash;â Me belly good Sheliffâme lebbee when can, Me allee same halp pin as Melican man! But Melican man He washee him pan On bottom side hillee And catcheeâhow can?â âAre we men?â says Joe Johnson, âand list to this jaw, Without process of warrant or color of law? Are we men orâa-chew!ââhere he gasped in his speech, For a stink-pot had fallen just out of his reach. âShall we stand here as idle, and let Asia pour Her barbaric hordes on this civilized shore? Has the White Man no country? Are we left in the lurch? And likewise what's gone of the Established Church? One man to four hundred is great odds, I own, But this 'yer 's a White ManâI plays it alone!â And he sprang up the hillsideâto stop him none dareâ Till a yell from the top told a âWhite Man was there!â A White Man was there! We prayed he might spare Those misguided heathens The few clothes they wear. They fled, and he followed, but no matter where; They fled to escape him,âthe âWhite Man was there,ââ Till we missed first his voice on the pine-wooded slope, And we knew for the heathen henceforth was no hope; And the yells they grew fainter, when Petersen said, âIt simply was human to bury his dead.â And then, with slow tread, We crept up, in dread, But found nary mortal there, Living or dead. But there was his trail, and the way that they came, And yonder, no doubt, he was bagging his game. When Jones drops his pickaxe, and Thompson says âShoo!â And both of 'em points to a cage of bamboo Hanging down from a tree, with a label that swung Conspicuous, with letters in some foreign tongue, Which, when freely translated, the same did appear Was the Chinese for saying, âA White Man is here!â And as we drew near, In anger and fear, Bound hand and foot, Johnson Looked down with a leer! In his mouth was an opium pipeâwhich was why He leered at us so with a drunken-like eye! They had shaved off his eyebrows, and tacked on a cue, They had painted his face of a coppery hue, And rigged him all up in a heathenish suit, Then softly departed, each man with his âloot.â Yes, every galoot. And Ah Sin, to boot, Had left him there hanging Like ripening fruit. At a mass meeting held up at Murphy's next day There were seventeen speakers and each had his say; There were twelve resolutions that instantly passed, And each resolution was worse than the last; There were fourteen petitions, which, granting the same, Will determine what Governor Murphy's shall name; And the man from our district that goes up next year Goes up on one issueâthat's patent and clear: âCan the work of a mean, Degraded, unclean Believer in Buddha Be held as a lien?â TRUTHFUL JAMES TO THE EDITOR (YREKA, 1873) Which it is not my style To produce needless pain By statements that rile Or that go 'gin the grain, But here's Captain Jack still a-livin', and Nye has no skelp on his brain! On that Caucasian head There is no crown of hair; It has gone, it has fled! And Echo sez âWhere?â And I asks, âIs this Nation a White Man's, and is generally things on the square?â She was known in the camp As âNye's other squaw,â And folks of that stamp Hez no rights in the law, But is treacherous, sinful, and slimy, as Nye might hev well known before. But she said that she knew Where the Injins was hid, And the statement was true, For it seemed that she did, Since she led William where he was covered by seventeen Modocs, andâslid! Then they reached for his hair; But Nye sez, âBy the law Of nations, forbear! I surrendersâno more: And I looks to be treated,âyou hear me?âas a pris'ner, a pris'ner of war!â But Captain Jack rose And he sez, âIt's too thin! Such statements as those It's too late to begin. There's a Modoc indictment agin you, O Paleface, and you're goin' in! âYou stole Schonchin's squaw In the year sixty-two; It was in sixty-four That Long Jack you went through, And you burned Nasty Jim's rancheria, and his wives and his papooses too. âThis gun in my hand Was sold me by you 'Gainst the law of the land, And I grieves it is true!â And he buried his face in his blanket and wept as he hid it from view. âBut you're tried and condemned, And skelping's your doom,â And he paused and he hemmedâ But why this resume? He was skelped 'gainst the custom of nations, and cut off like a rose in its bloom. So I asks without guile, And I trusts not in vain, If this is the style That is going to obtainâ If here's Captain Jack still a-livin', and Nye with no skelp on his brain? AN IDYL OF THE ROAD (SIERRAS, 1876) DRAMATIS PERSONÃ First Tourist Second Tourist âYuba Bill, Driver A Stranger FIRST TOURIST Look how the upland plunges into cover, Green where the pines fade sullenly away. Wonderful those olive depths! and wonderful, moreoverâ SECOND TOURIST The red dust that rises in a suffocating way. FIRST TOURIST Small is the soul that cannot soar above it, Cannot but cling to its ever-kindred clay: Better be yon bird, that seems to breathe and love itâ SECOND TOURIST Doubtless a hawk or some other bird of prey. Were we, like him, as sure of a dinner That on our stomachs would comfortably stay; Or were the fried ham a shade or two just thinner, That must confront us at closing of the day: Then might you sing like Theocritus or Virgil, Then might we each make a metrical essay; But verse just nowâI must protest and urgeâill Fits a digestion by travel led astray. CHORUS OF PASSENGERS Speed, Yuba Bill! oh, speed us to our dinner! Speed to the sunset that beckons far away. SECOND TOURIST William of Yuba, O Son of Nimshi, hearken! Check thy profanity, but not thy chariot's play. Tell us, O William, before the shadows darken, Where, and, oh! how we shall dine? O William, say!

But, meantime, friends, believe me, Nowhere on earth lives a purer woman; nay, If my perceptions do surely not deceive me, She is the lady we have inside to-day.

He was that scarred trunk, and she the vine that sweetly Clothed him with life again, and liftedâ SECOND TOURIST Yes; but pray How know you this? STRANGER She's my wife. YUBA BILL The h?ll you say! THOMPSON OF ANGELS It is the story of Thompsonâof Thompson, the hero of Angels. Frequently drunk was Thompson, but always polite to the stranger; Light and free was the touch of Thompson upon his revolver; Great the mortality incident on that lightness and freedom. Yet not happy or gay was Thompson, the hero of Angels; Often spoke to himself in accents of anguish and sorrow, âWhy do I make the graves of the frivolous youth who in folly Thoughtlessly pass my revolver, forgetting its lightness and freedom? âWhy in my daily walks does the surgeon drop his left eyelid, The undertaker smile, and the sculptor of gravestone marbles Lean on his chisel and gaze? I care not o'er much for attention; Simple am I in my ways, save but for this lightness and freedom.â So spake that pensive manâthis Thompson, the hero of Angels, Bitterly smiled to himself, as he strode through the chapparal musing. âWhy, oh, why?â echoed the pines in the dark olive depth far resounding. âWhy, indeed?â whispered the sage brush that bent 'neath his feet non-elastic. Pleasant indeed was that morn that dawned o'er the bar-room at Angels, Where in their manhood's prime was gathered the pride of the hamlet. Six âtook sugar in theirs,â and nine to the barkeeper lightly Smiled as they said, âWell, Jim, you can give us our regular fusil.â Suddenly as the gray hawk swoops down on the barnyard, alighting Where, pensively picking their corn, the favorite pullets are gathered, So in that festive bar-room dropped Thompson, the hero of Angels, Grasping his weapon dread with his pristine lightness and freedom. Never a word he spoke; divesting himself of his garments, Danced the war-dance of the playful yet truculent Modoc, Uttered a single whoop, and then, in the accents of challenge, Spake: âOh, behold in me a Crested Jay Hawk of the mountain.â Then rose a pallid manâa man sick with fever and ague; Small was he, and his step was tremulous, weak, and uncertain; Slowly a Derringer drew, and covered the person of Thompson; Said in his feeblest pipe, âI'm a Bald-headed Snipe of the Valley.â As on its native plains the kangaroo, startled by hunters, Leaps with successive bounds, and hurries away to the thickets, So leaped the Crested Hawk, and quietly hopping behind him Ran, and occasionally shot, that Bald-headed Snipe of the Valley. Vain at the festive bar still lingered the people of Angels, Hearing afar in the woods the petulant pop of the pistol; Never again returned the Crested Jay Hawk of the mountains, Never again was seen the Bald-headed Snipe of the Valley. Yet in the hamlet of Angels, when truculent speeches are uttered, When bloodshed and life alone will atone for some trifling misstatement, Maidens and men in their prime recall the last hero of Angels, Think of and vainly regret the Bald-headed Snipe of the Valley! THE HAWK'S NEST (SIERRAS) We checked our pace, the red road sharply rounding; We heard the troubled flow Of the dark olive depths of pines resounding A thousand feet below. Above the tumult of the caÃ±on lifted, The gray hawk breathless hung, Or on the hill a wingÃ«d shadow drifted Where furze and thorn-bush clung; Or where half-way the mountain side was furrowed With many a seam and scar; Or some abandoned tunnel dimly burrowed,â A mole-hill seen so far. We looked in silence down across the distant Unfathomable reach: A silence broken by the guide's consistent And realistic speech. âWalker of Murphy's blew a hole through Peters For telling him he lied; Then up and dusted out of South Hornitos Across the Long Divide. âWe ran him out of Strong's, and up through Eden, And 'cross the ford below, And up this caÃ±on (Peters' brother leadin'), And me and Clark and Joe. âHe fou't us game: somehow I disremember Jest how the thing kem round; Some say 't was wadding, some a scattered ember From fires on the ground. âBut in one minute all the hill below him Was just one sheet of flame; Guardin' the crest, Sam Clark and I called to him, And,âwell, the dog was game! âHe made no sign: the fires of hell were round him, The pit of hell below. We sat and waited, but we never found him; And then we turned to go. âAnd thenâyou see that rock that's grown so bristly With chapparal and tanâ Suthin crep' out: it might hev been a grizzly It might hev been a man; âSuthin that howled, and gnashed its teeth, and shouted In smoke and dust and flame; Suthin that sprang into the depths about it, Grizzly or man,âbut game! âThat's all! Well, yes, it does look rather risky, And kinder makes one queer And dizzy looking down. A drop of whiskey Ain't a bad thing right here!â HER LETTER I'm sitting alone by the fire, Dressed just as I came from the dance, In a robe even you would admire,â It cost a cool thousand in France; I'm be-diamonded out of all reason, My hair is done up in a cue: In short, sir, âthe belle of the seasonâ Is wasting an hour upon you. A dozen engagements I've broken; I left in the midst of a set; Likewise a proposal, half spoken, That waitsâon the stairsâfor me yet. They say he'll be rich,âwhen he grows up,â And then he adores me indeed; And you, sir, are turning your nose up, Three thousand miles off, as you read. âAnd how do I like my position?â âAnd what do I think of New York?â âAnd now, in my higher ambition, With whom do I waltz, flirt, or talk?â âAnd is n't it nice to have riches, And diamonds and silks, and all that?â âAnd are n't they a change to the ditches And tunnels of Poverty Flat?â Well, yes,âif you saw us out driving Each day in the Park, four-in-hand. If you saw poor dear mamma contriving To look supernaturally grand,â If you saw papa's picture, as taken By Brady, and tinted at that,â You'd never suspect he sold bacon And flour at Poverty Flat. And yet, just this moment, when sitting In the glare of the grand chandelier,â In the bustle and glitter befitting The âfinest soirÃ©e of the year,ââ In the mists of a gaze de ChambÃ©ry, And the hum of the smallest of talk,â Somehow, Joe, I thought of the âFerry,â And the dance that we had on âThe Fork;â Of Harrison's barn, with its muster Of flags festooned over the wall; Of the candles that shed their soft lustre And tallow on head-dress and shawl; Of the steps that we took to one fiddle, Of the dress of my queer vis-Ã -vis; And how I once went down the middle With the man that shot Sandy McGee; Of the moon that was quietly sleeping On the hill, when the time came to go; Of the few baby peaks that were peeping From under their bedclothes of snow; Of that rideâthat to me was the rarest; Ofâthe something you said at the gate Ah! Joe, then I was n't an heiress To âthe best-paying lead in the State.â Well, well, it's all past; yet it's funny To think, as I stood in the glare Of fashion and beauty and money, That I should be thinking, right there, Of some one who breasted high water, And swam the North Fork, and all that, Just to dance with old Folinsbee's daughter, The Lily of Poverty Flat. But goodness! what nonsense I'm writing! (Mamma says my taste still is low), Instead of my triumphs reciting, I'm spooning on Joseph,âheigh-ho! And I'm to be âfinishedâ by travel,â Whatever's the meaning of that. Oh, why did papa strike pay gravel In drifting on Poverty Flat? Good-night!âhere's the end of my paper; Good-night!âif the longitude please,â For maybe, while wasting my taper, Your sun's climbing over the trees. But know, if you have n't got riches, And are poor, dearest Joe, and all that, That my heart's somewhere there in the ditches, And you've struck it,âon Poverty Flat. HIS ANSWER TO âHER LETTERâ (REPORTED BY TRUTHFUL JAMES) Being asked by an intimate party,â Which the same I would term as a friend,â Though his health it were vain to call hearty, Since the mind to deceit it might lend; For his arm it was broken quite recent, And there's something gone wrong with his lung,â Which is why it is proper and decent I should write what he runs off his tongue. First, he says, Miss, he's read through your letter To the end,âand âthe end came too soon;â That a âslight illness kept him your debtor,â (Which for weeks he was wild as a loon); That âhis spirits are buoyant as yours is;â That with you, Miss, he âchallenges Fate,â (Which the language that invalid uses At times it were vain to relate). And he says âthat the mountains are fairer For once being held in your thought;â That each rock âholds a wealth that is rarer Than ever by gold-seeker sought.â (Which are words he would put in these pages, By a party not given to guile; Though the claim not, at date, paying wages, Might produce in the sinful a smile.) He remembers the ball at the Ferry, And the ride, and the gate, and the vow, And the rose that you gave him,âthat very Same rose he is âtreasuring now.â (Which his blanket he's kicked on his trunk, Miss, And insists on his legs being free; And his language to me from his bunk, Miss, Is frequent and painful and free.) He hopes you are wearing no willows, But are happy and gay all the while; That he knowsâ(which this dodging of pillows Imparts but small ease to the style, And the same you will pardon)âhe knows, Miss, That, though parted by many a mile, âYet, were he lying under the snows, Miss, They'd melt into tears at your smile.â And âyou'll still think of him in your pleasures, In your brief twilight dreams of the past; In this green laurel spray that he treasures,â It was plucked where your parting was last; In this specimen,âbut a small trifle,â It will do for a pin for your shawl.â (Which, the truth not to wickedly stifle, Was his last week's âclean up,ââand his all.) He's asleep, which the same might seem strange, Miss, Were it not that I scorn to deny That I raised his last dose, for a change, Miss, In view that his fever was high; But he lies there quite peaceful and pensive. And now, my respects, Miss, to you; Which my language, although comprehensive, Might seem to be freedom, is true. For I have a small favor to ask you, As concerns a bull-pup, and the same,â If the duty would not overtask you,â You would please to procure for me, game; And send per express to the Flat, Miss,â For they say York is famed for the breed, Which, though words of deceit may be that, Miss, I'll trust to your taste, Miss, indeed. P. S.âWhich this same interfering Into other folks' way I despise; Yet if it so be I was hearing That it's just empty pockets as lies Betwixt you and Joseph, it follers That, having no family claims, Here's my pile, which it's six hundred dollars, As is yours, with respects, Truthful James. âTHE RETURN OF BELISARIUSâ (MUD FLAT, 1860) So you're back from your travels, old fellow, And you left but a twelvemonth ago; You've hobnobbed with Louis Napoleon, Eugenie, and kissed the Pope's toe. By Jove, it is perfectly stunning, Astounding,âand all that, you know; Yes, things are about as you left them In Mud Flat a twelvemonth ago. The boys!âthey're all right,âOh! Dick Ashley. He's buried somewhere in the snow; He was lost on the Summit last winter, And Bob has a hard row to hoe. You know that he's got the consumption? You did n't! Well, come, that's a go; I certainly wrote you at Baden,â Dear me! that was six months ago. I got all your outlandish letters, All stamped by some foreign P. O. I handed myself to Miss Mary That sketch of a famous chÃ¢teau. Tom Saunders is living at 'Frisco,â They say that he cuts quite a show. You did n't meet Euchre-deck Billy Anywhere on your road to Cairo? So you thought of the rusty old cabin, The pines, and the valley below, And heard the North Fork of the Yuba As you stood on the banks of the Po? 'T was just like your romance. old fellow But now there is standing a row Of stores on the site of the cabin That you lived in a twelvemonth ago. But it's jolly to see you, old fellow,â To think it's a twelvemonth ago! And you have seen Louis Napoleon, And look like a Johnny Crapaud. Come in. You will surely see Mary,â You know we are married. What, no?â Oh, ay! I forgot there was something Between you a twelvemonth ago. FURTHER LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES (NYE'S FORD, STANISLAUS, 1870) Do I sleep? do I dream? Do I wonder and doubt? Are things what they seem? Or is visions about? Is our civilization a failure? Or is the Caucasian played out? Which expressions are strong; Yet would feebly imply Some account of a wrongâ Not to call it a lieâ As was worked off on William, my pardner, And the same being W. Nye. He came down to the Ford On the very same day Of that lottery drawned By those sharps at the Bay; And he says to me, âTruthful, how goes it?â I replied, âIt is far, far from gay; âFor the camp has gone wild On this lottery game, And has even beguiled âInjin Dickâ by the same.â Then said Nye to me, âInjins is pizen: But what is his number, eh, James?â I replied, â7, 2, 9, 8, 4, is his hand;â When he started, and drew Out a list, which he scanned; Then he softly went for his revolver With language I cannot command. Then I said, âWilliam Nye!â But he turned upon me, And the look in his eye Was quite painful to see; And he says, âYou mistake; this poor Injin I protects from such sharps as you be!â I was shocked and withdrew; But I grieve to relate, When he next met my view Injin Dick was his mate; And the two around town was a-lying In a frightfully dissolute state. Which the war dance they had Round a tree at the Bend Was a sight that was sad; And it seemed that the end Would not justify the proceedings, As I quiet remarked to a friend. For that Injin he fled The next day to his band; And we found William spread Very loose on the strand, With a peaceful-like smile on his features, And a dollar greenback in his hand; Which the same, when rolled out, We observed, with surprise, Was what he, no doubt, Thought the number and prizeâ Them figures in red in the corner, Which the number of notes specifies. Was it guile, or a dream? Is it Nye that I doubt? Are things what they seem? Or is visions about? Is our civilization a failure? Or is the Caucasian played out? AFTER THE ACCIDENT (MOUTH OF THE SHAFT) What I want is my husband, sir,â And if you're a man, sir, You'll give me an answer,â Where is my Joe? Penrhyn, sir, Joe,â Caernarvonshire. Six months ago Since we came hereâ Eh?âAh, you know! Well, I am quiet And still, But I must stand here, And will! Please, I'll be strong, If you'll just let me wait Inside o' that gate Till the news comes along. âNegligence!ââ That was the cause!â Butchery! Are there no laws,â Laws to protect such as we? Well, then! I won't raise my voice. There, men! I won't make no noise, Only you just let me be. Four, only fourâdid he sayâ Saved! and the other ones?âEh? Why do they call? Why are they all Looking and coming this way? What's that?âa message? I'll take it. I know his wife, sir, I'll break it. âForeman!â Ay, ay! âOut by and by,â Just saved his life. Say to his wife Soon he'll be free.â Will I?âGod bless you! It's me! THE GHOST THAT JIM SAW Why, as to that, said the engineer, Ghosts ain't things we are apt to fear; Spirits don't fool with levers much, And throttle-valves don't take to such; And as for Jim, What happened to him Was one half fact, and t' other half whim! Running one night on the line, he saw A houseâas plain as the moral lawâ Just by the moonlit bank, and thence Came a drunken man with no more sense Than to drop on the rail Flat as a flail, As Jim drove by with the midnight mail. Down went the patentsâsteam reversed. Too late! for there came a âthud.â Jim cursed As the fireman, there in the cab with him, Kinder stared in the face of Jim, And says, âWhat now?â Says Jim, âWhat now! I've just run over a man,âthat's how!â The fireman stared at Jim. They ran Back, but they never found house nor man,â Nary a shadow within a mile. Jim turned pale, but he tried to smile, Then on he tore Ten mile or more, In quicker time than he'd made afore. Would you believe it! the very next night Up rose that house in the moonlight white, Out comes the chap and drops as before, Down goes the brake and the rest encore; And so, in fact, Each night that act Occurred, till folks swore Jim was cracked. Humph! let me see; it's a year now, 'most, That I met Jim, East, and says, âHow's your ghost?â âGone,â says Jim; âand more, it's plain That ghost don't trouble me again. I thought I shook That ghost when I took A place on an Eastern line,âbut look! âWhat should I meet, the first trip out, But the very house we talked about, And the selfsame man! âWell,â says I, âI guess It's time to stop this 'yer foolishness.â So I crammed on steam, When there came a scream From my fireman, that jest broke my dream: ââYou've killed somebody!â Says I, âNot much! I've been thar often, and thar ain't no such, And now I'll prove it!â Back we ran, Andâdarn my skin!âbut thar was a man On the rail, dead, Smashed in the head!â Now I call that meanness!â That's all Jim said. âSEVENTY-NINEâ (MR. INTERVIEWER INTERVIEWED) Know me next time when you see me, won't you, old smarty? Oh, I mean you, old figger-head,âjust the same party! Take out your pensivil, d?n you; sharpen it, do! Any complaints to make? Lots of 'emâone of 'em's you. You! who are you, anyhow, goin' round in that sneakin' way? Never in jail before, was you, old blatherskite, say? Look at it; don't it look pooty? Oh, grin, and be d?d to you, do! But if I had you this side o' that gratin,' I'd just make it lively for you. How did I get in here? Well what 'ud you give to know? 'T was n't by sneakin' round where I had n't no call to go; 'T was n't by hangin' round a-spyin' unfortnet men. Grin! but I'll stop your jaw if ever you do that agen. Why don't you say suthin, blast you? Speak your mind if you dare. Ain't I a bad lot, sonny? Say it, and call it square. Hain't got no tongue, hey, hev ye? Oh, guard! here's a little swell A cussin' and swearin' and yellin', and bribin' me not to tell. There! I thought that 'ud fetch ye! And you want to know my name? âSeventy-nineâ they call me, but that is their little game; For I'm werry highly connected, as a gent, sir, can understand, And my family hold their heads up with the very furst in the land. For 't was all, sir, a put-up job on a pore young man like me; And the jury was bribed a puppos, and at furst they could n't agree; And I sed to the judge, sez I,âOh, grin! it's all right, my son! But you're a werry lively young pup, and you ain't to be played upon! Wot's that you got?âtobacco? I'm cussed but I thought 't was a tract. Thank ye! A chap t' other dayânow, lookee, this is a factâ Slings me a tract on the evils o' keepin' bad company, As if all the saints was howlin' to stay here along o' we. No, I hain't no complaints. Stop, yes; do you see that chap,â Him standin' over there, a-hidin' his eyes in his cap? Well, that man's stumick is weak, and he can't stand the pris'n fare; For the coffee is just half beans, and the sugar it ain't nowhere. Perhaps it's his bringin' up; but he's sickenin' day by day, And he does n't take no food, and I'm seein' him waste away. And it is n't the thing to see; for, whatever he's been and done, Starvation is n't the plan as he's to be saved upon. For he cannot rough it like me; and he has n't the stamps, I guess, To buy him his extry grub outside o' the pris'n mess. And perhaps if a gent like you, with whom I've been sorter free, Wouldâthank you! But, say! look here! Oh, blast it! don't give it to ME! Don't you give it to me; now, don't ye, don't ye, don't! You think it's a put-up job; so I'll thank ye, sir, if you won't. But hand him the stamps yourself: why, he is n't even my pal; And, if it's a comfort to you, why, I don't intend that he shall. THE STAGE-DRIVER'S STORY It was the stage-driver's story, as he stood with his back to the wheelers, Quietly flecking his whip, and turning his quid of tobacco; While on the dusty road, and blent with the rays of the moonlight, We saw the long curl of his lash and the juice of tobacco descending. âDanger! Sir, I believe you,âindeed, I may say, on that subject, You your existence might put to the hazard and turn of a wager. I have seen danger? Oh, no! not me, sir, indeed, I assure you: 'T was only the man with the dog that is sitting alone in yon wagon. âIt was the Geiger Grade, a mile and a half from the summit: Black as your hat was the night, and never a star in the heavens. Thundering down the grade, the gravel and stones we sent flying Over the precipice side,âa thousand feet plumb to the bottom. âHalf-way down the grade I felt, sir, a thrilling and creaking, Then a lurch to one side, as we hung on the bank of the caÃ±on; Then, looking up the road, I saw, in the distance behind me, The off hind wheel of the coach, just loosed from its axle, and following. âOne glance alone I gave, then gathered together my ribbons, Shouted, and flung them, outspread, on the straining necks of my cattle; Screamed at the top of my voice, and lashed the air in my frenzy, While down the Geiger Grade, on three wheels, the vehicle thundered. âSpeed was our only chance, when again came the ominous rattle: Crack, and another wheel slipped away, and was lost in the darkness. Two only now were left; yet such was our fearful momentum, Upright, erect, and sustained on two wheels, the vehicle thundered. âAs some huge boulder, unloosed from its rocky shelf on the mountain, Drives before it the hare and the timorous squirrel, far leaping, So down the Geiger Grade rushed the Pioneer coach, and before it Leaped the wild horses, and shrieked in advance of the danger impending. âBut to be brief in my tale. Again, ere we came to the level, Slipped from its axle a wheel; so that, to be plain in my statement, A matter of twelve hundred yards or more, as the distance may be, We traveled upon one wheel, until we drove up to the station. âThen, sir, we sank in a heap; but, picking myself from the ruins, I heard a noise up the grade; and looking, I saw in the distance The three wheels following still, like moons on the horizon whirling, Till, circling, they gracefully sank on the road at the side of the station. âThis is my story, sir; a trifle, indeed, I assure you. Much more, perchance, might be saidâbut I hold him of all men most lightly Who swerves from the truth in his tale. No, thank youâWell, since you are pressing, Perhaps I don't care if I do: you may give me the same, Jim,âno sugar.â A QUESTION OF PRIVILEGE REPORTED BY TRUTHFUL JAMES It was Andrew Jackson Sutter who, despising Mr. Cutter for remarks he heard him utter in debate upon the floor, Swung him up into the skylight, in the peaceful, pensive twilight, and then keerlessly proceeded, makin' no account what we didâ To wipe up with his person casual dust upon the floor. Now a square fight never frets me, nor unpleasantness upsets me, but the simple thing that gets meânow the job is done and gone, And we've come home free and merry from the peaceful cemetery, leavin' Cutter there with Sutterâthat mebbee just a stutter On the part of Mr. Cutter caused the loss we deeply mourn. Some bashful hesitation, just like spellin' punctooationâmight have worked an aggravation on to Sutter's mournful mind, For the witnesses all vary ez to wot was said and nary a galoot will toot his horn except the way he is inclined. But they all allow that Sutter had begun a kind of mutter, when uprose Mr. Cutter with a sickening kind of ease, And proceeded then to wade in to the subject then prevadin': âIs Profanity degradin'?â in words like unto these: âOnlike the previous speaker, Mr. Sutter of Yreka, he was but a humble seekerâand not like himâa cussââ It was here that Mr. Sutter softly reached for Mr. Cutter, when the latter with a stutter said: âac-customed to discuss.â Then Sutter he rose grimly, and sorter smilin' dimly bowed onto the Chairman primlyâ(just like Cutter ez could be!) Drawled âhe guessed he must fallâbackâasâMr. Cutter owned the packâasâhe just had played theâJackâasââ (here Cutter's gun went crack! as Mr. Sutter gasped and ended) âevery man can see!â But William Henry Pryorâjust in range of Sutter's fireâhere evinced a wild desire to do somebody harm, And in the general scrimmage no one thought if Sutter's âimageâ was a misplaced punctooationâlike the hole in Pryor's arm. For we all waltzed in together, never carin' to ask whether it was Sutter or was Cutter we woz tryin' to abate. But we could n't help perceivin', when we took to inkstand heavin', that the process was relievin' to the sharpness of debate. So we've come home free and merry from the peaceful cemetery, and I make no commentary on these simple childish games; Things is various and humanâand the man ain't born of woman who is free to intermeddle with his pal's intents and aims. THE THOUGHT-READER OF ANGELS REPORTED BY TRUTHFUL JAMES We hev tumbled ez dust Or ez worms of the yearth; Wot we looked for hez bust! We are objects of mirth! They have played usâold Pards of the river!âthey hev played us for all we was worth! Was it euchre or draw Cut us off in our bloom? Was it faro, whose law Is uncertain ez doom? Or an innocent âJack potâ thatâopenedâwas to us ez the jaws of the tomb? It was nary! It kem With some sharps from the States, Ez folks sez, âAll things kem To the fellers ez waits;â And we 'd waited six months for that suthin'âhad me and Bill Nyeâin such straits! And it kem. It was small; It was dream-like and weak; It wore store clothesâthat's all That we knew, so to speak; But it called itself âBillson, Thought-Readerââwhich ain't half a name for its cheek! He could read wot you thought, And he knew wot you did; He could find things untaught, No matter whar hid; And he went to it, blindfold and smiling, being led by the hand like a kid! Then I glanced at Bill Nye, And I sez, without pride, âYou'll excuse us. We've nigh On to nothin' to hide; But if some gent will lend us a twenty, we'll hide it whar folks shall decide.â It was Billson's own self Who forked over the gold, With a smile. âThar's the pelf,â He remarked. âI make bold To advance it, and go twenty better that I'll find it without being told.â Then I passed it to Nye, Who repassed it to me. And we bandaged each eye Of that Billsonâez we Softly dropped that coin in his coat pocket, ez the hull crowd around us could see. That was all. He'd one hand Locked in mine. Then he groped. We could not understand Why that minit Nye sloped, For we knew we'd the dead thing on Billsonâeven more than we dreamed of or hoped. For he stood thar in doubt With his hand to his head, Then he turned, and lit out Through the door where Nye fled, Draggin' me and the rest of us arter, while we larfed till we thought we was dead, Till he overtook Nye And went through him. Words fail For what follers! Kin I Paint our agonized wail Ez he drew from Nye's pocket that twenty wot we'd sworn was in his own coat-tail! And it was! But, when found, It proved bogus and brass! And the question goes round How the thing kem to pass? Or, if passed, woz it passed thar by William; and I listens, and echoes âAlas! âFor the days when the skill Of the keerds was no blind, When no effort of will Could beat four of a kind, When the thing wot you held in your hand, Pard, was worth more than the thing in your mind.â THE SPELLING BEE AT ANGELS (REPORTED BY TRUTHFUL JAMES) Waltz in, waltz in, ye little kids, and gather round my knee, And drop them books and first pot-hooks, and hear a yarn from me. I kin not sling a fairy tale of Jinnys Qy. Genii. fierce and wild, For I hold it is unchristian to deceive a simple child; But as from school yer driftin' by, I thowt ye'd like to hear Of a âSpelling Beeâ at Angels that we organized last year. It warn't made up of gentle kids, of pretty kids, like you, But gents ez hed their reg'lar growth, and some enough for two. There woz Lanky Jim of Sutter's Fork and Bilson of Lagrange, And âPistol Bob,â who wore that day a knife by way of change. You start, you little kids, you think these are not pretty names, But each had a man behind it, andâmy name is Truthful James. There was Poker Dick from Whisky Flat, and Smith of Shooter's Bend, And Brown of Calaverasâwhich I want no better friend; Three-fingered Jackâyes, pretty dears, three fingersâyou have five. Clapp cut off twoâit's sing'lar, too, that Clapp ain't now alive. 'T was very wrong indeed, my dears, and Clapp was much to blame; Likewise was Jack, in after-years, for shootin' of that same. The nights was kinder lengthenin' out, the rains had jest begun, When all the camp came up to Pete's to have their usual fun; But we all sot kinder sad-like around the bar-room stove Till Smith got up, permiskiss-like, and this remark he hove: âThar's a new game down in Frisco, that ez far ez I can see Beats euchre, poker, and van-toon, they calls the âSpellin' Bee.ââ Then Brown of Calaveras simply hitched his chair and spake, âPoker is good enough for me,â and Lanky Jim sez, âShake!â And Bob allowed he warn't proud, but he âmust say right thar That the man who tackled euchre hed his education squar.â This brought up Lenny Fairchild, the schoolmaster, who said He knew the game, and he would give instructions on that head. âFor instance, take some simple word,â sez he, âlike âseparate:â Now who can spell it?â Dog my skin, ef thar was one in eight. This set the boys all wild at once. The chairs was put in row, And at the head was Lanky Jim, and at the foot was Joe, And high upon the bar itself the schoolmaster was raised, And the bar-keep put his glasses down, and sat and silent gazed. The first word out was âparallel,â and seven let it be, Till Joe waltzed in his âdouble lâ betwixt the âaâ and âe;â For since he drilled them Mexicans in San Jacinto's fight Thar warn't no prouder man got up than Pistol Joe that nightâ Till ârhythmâ came! He tried to smile, then said âthey had him there,â And Lanky Jim, with one long stride, got up and took his chair. O little kids, my pretty kids, 't was touchin' to survey These bearded men, with weppings on, like schoolboys at their play. They'd laugh with glee, and shout to see each other lead the van, And Bob sat up as monitor with a cue for a rattan, Till the Chair gave out âincinerate,â and Brown said he'd be durned If any such blamed word as that in school was ever learned. When âphthisisâ came they all sprang up, and vowed the man who rung Another blamed Greek word on them be taken out and hung. As they sat down again I saw in Bilson's eye a flash, And Brown of Calaveras was a-twistin' his mustache, And when at last Brown slipped on âgneiss,â and Bilson took his chair, He dropped some casual words about some folks who dyed their hair. And then the Chair grew very white, and the Chair said he'd adjourn, But Poker Dick remarked that he would wait and get his turn; Then with a tremblin' voice and hand, and with a wanderin' eye, The Chair next offered âeider-duck,â and Dick began with âI,â And Bilson smiledâthen Bilson shrieked! Just how the fight begun I never knowed, for Bilson dropped, and Dick, he moved up one. Then certain gents arose and said âthey'd business down in camp,â And âez the road was rather dark, and ez the night was damp, They'dââhere got up Three-fingered Jack and locked the door and yelled: âNo, not one mother's son goes out till that thar word is spelled!â But while the words were on his lips, he groaned and sank in pain, And sank with Webster on his chest and Worcester on his brain. Below the bar dodged Poker Dick, and tried to look ez he Was huntin' up authorities thet no one else could see; And Brown got down behind the stove, allowin' he âwas cold,â Till it upsot and down his legs the cinders freely rolled, And several gents called âOrder!â till in his simple way Poor Smith began with âO-râââOrââand he was dragged away. O little kids, my pretty kids, down on your knees and pray! You've got your eddication in a peaceful sort of way; And bear in mind thar may be sharps ez slings their spellin' square, But likewise slings their bowie-knives without a thought or care. You wants to know the rest, my dears? Thet's all! In me you see The only gent that lived to tell about the Spellin' Bee! He ceased and passed, that truthful man; the children went their way With downcast heads and downcast heartsâbut not to sport or play. For when at eve the lamps were lit, and supperless to bed Each child was sent, with tasks undone and lessons all unsaid, No man might know the awful woe that thrilled their youthful frames, As they dreamed of Angels Spelling Bee and thought of Truthful James. ARTEMIS IN SIERRA DRAMATIS PERSONÃ Poet. Philosopher. Jones of Mariposa POET Halt! Here we are. Now wheel your mare a trifle Just where you stand; then doff your hat and swear Never yet was scene you might cover with your rifle Half as complete or as marvelously fair. PHILOSOPHER Dropped from Olympus or lifted out of Tempe, Swung like a censer betwixt the earth and sky! He who in Greece sang of flocks and flax and hemp,âhe Here might recall themâsix thousand feet on high! POET Well you may say so. The clamor of the river, Hum of base toil, and man's ignoble strife, Halt far below, where the stifling sunbeams quiver, But never climb to this purer, higher life! Not to this glade, where Jones of Mariposa, Simple and meek as his flocks we're looking at, Tends his soft charge; nor where his daughter Rosaâ (A shot.) Hallo! What's that? PHILOSOPHER Aâsomething thro' my hatâ Bullet, I think. You were speaking of his daughter? POET Yes; butâyour hat you were moving through the leaves; Likely he thought it some eagle bent on slaughter. Lightly he shootsâ(A second shot.) PHILOSOPHER As one readily perceives. Still, he improves! This time your hat has got it, Quite near the band! Eh? Oh, just as you pleaseâ Stop, or go on. POET Perhaps we'd better trot it Down through the hollow, and up among the trees. BOTH Trot, trot, trot, where the bullets cannot follow; Trot down and up again among the laurel trees. PHILOSOPHER Thanks, that is better; now of this shot-dispensing Jones and his girlâyou were sayingâ POET Well, you seeâ Iâhang it all!âOh! what's the use of fencing! Sir, I confess it!âthese shots were meant for me. PHILOSOPHER You! are you mad! POET God knows, I should n't wonder! I love this coy nymph, who, coldlyâas yon peak Shines on the river it feeds, yet keeps asunderâ Long have I worshiped, but never dared to speak. Till she, no doubt, her love no longer hiding, Waked by some chance word her father's jealousy; Slips her disdainâas an avalanche down gliding Sweeps flocks and kin awayâto clear a path for me. Hence his attack. PHILOSOPHER I see. What I admire Chiefly, I think, in your idyl, so to speak, Is the cool modesty that checks your youthful fire,â Absence of self-love and abstinence of cheek! Still, I might mention, I've met the gentle Rosa,â Danced with her thrice, to her father's jealous dread; And, it is possible, she's happened to disclose aâ Ahem! You can fancy why he shoots at me instead. POET You? PHILOSOPHER Me. But kindly take your hand from your revolver I am not cholericâbut accidents may chance. And here's the father, who alone can be the solver Of this twin riddle of the hat and the romance. Enter Jones of Mariposa. POET Speak, shepherdâmine! PHILOSOPHER Hail! Time-and-cartridge waster, Aimless exploder of theories and skill! Whom do you shoot? JONES OF MARIPOSA Well, shootin' ain't my taste, or Ef I shoot anythingâI only shoot to kill. That ain't what's up. I only kem to tell yeâ Sportin' or courtin'âtrot homeward for your life! Gals will be gals, and p'r'aps it's just ez well ye Larned there was one had no wish to beâa wife. POET What? PHILOSOPHER Is this true? JONES OF MARIPOSA I reckon it looks like it. She saw ye comin'. My gun was standin' by; She made a grab, and 'fore I up could strike it, Blazed at ye both! The critter is so shy! POET Who? JONES OF MARIPOSA My darter! PHILOSOPHER Rosa? JONES OF MARIPOSA Same! Good-by! JACK OF THE TULES (SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA) Shrewdly you question, SeÃ±or, and I fancy You are no novice. Confess that to little Of my poor gossip of Mission and Pueblo You are a stranger! Am I not right? Ah! believe me, that ever Since we joined company at the posada I've watched you closely, andâpardon an old priestâ I've caught you smiling! Smiling to hear an old fellow like me talk Gossip of pillage and robbers, and even Air his opinion of law and alcaldes Like any other! Now!âby that twist of the wrist on the bridle, By that straight line from the heel to the shoulder, By that curt speech,ânay! nay! no offense, son,â You are a soldier? No? Then a man of affairs? San Sebastian! 'T would serve me right if I prattled thus wildly Toâsay a sheriff? No?âjust caballero? Well, more's the pity. Ah! what we want here's a man of your presence; Sano, Secreto,âyes, all the four S's, Joined with a boldness and dash, when the time comes, Andâmay I say it?â One not too hard on the poor country people, Peons and silly vaqueros, who, dazzled By reckless skill, and, perchance, reckless largesse, Wink at some queer things. No? You would crush them as well as the robbers,â Root them out, scatter them? Ah! you are bitterâ And yetâquien sabe, perhaps that's the one way To catch their leader. As to myself, now, I'd share your displeasure; For I admit in this Jack of the Tules Certain good points. He still comes to confessionâ You'd âlike to catch himâ? Ah, if you did at such times, you might lead him Home by a thread. Good! Again you are smiling: You have no faith in such shrift, and but little In priest or penitent. Bueno! We take no offense, sir; whatever It please you to say, it becomes us, for Church sake, To bear in peace. Yet, if you were kinderâ And less suspiciousâ I might still prove to you, Jack of the Tules Shames not our teaching; nay, even might show you, Hard by this spot, his old comrade, who, wounded, Lives on his bounty. Ifâah, you listen!âI see I can trust you; Then, on your word as a gentlemanâfollow. Under that sycamore stands the old cabin; There sits his comrade. Eh!âare you mad? You would try to arrest him? You, with a warrant? Oh, well, take the rest of them: Pedro, Bill, Murray, Pat Doolan. Hey!âall of you, Tumble out, d?n it! There!âthat'll do, boys! Stand back! Ease his elbows; Take the gag from his mouth. Good! Now scatter like devils After his posseâfour straggling, four drunkenâ At the posada. Youâhelp me off with these togs, and then vamos! Now, ole Jeff Dobbs!âSheriff, Scout, and Detective! You're so derned 'cute! Kinder sick, ain't ye, bluffing Jack of the Tules! IV. MISCELLANEOUS A GREYPORT LEGEND (1797) They ran through the streets of the seaport town, They peered from the decks of the ships that lay; The cold sea-fog that came whitening down Was never as cold or white as they. âHo, Starbuck and Pinckney and Tenterden! Run for your shallops, gather your men, Scatter your boats on the lower bay.â Good cause for fear! In the thick mid-day The hulk that lay by the rotting pier, Filled with the children in happy play, Parted its moorings and drifted clear, Drifted clear beyond reach or call,â Thirteen children they were in all,â All adrift in the lower bay! Said a hard-faced skipper, âGod help us all! She will not float till the turning tide!â Said his wife, âMy darling will hear my call, Whether in sea or heaven she bide;â And she lifted a quavering voice and high, Wild and strange as a sea-bird's cry, Till they shuddered and wondered at her side. The fog drove down on each laboring crew, Veiled each from each and the sky and shore: There was not a sound but the breath they drew, And the lap of water and creak of oar; And they felt the breath of the downs, fresh blown O'er leagues of clover and cold grav stone, But not from the lips that had gone before. They came no more. But they tell the tale That, when fogs are thick on the harbor reef, The mackerel fishers shorten sailâ For the signal they know will bring relief; For the voices of children, still at play In a phantom hulk that drifts alway Through channels whose waters never fail. It is but a foolish shipman's tale, A theme for a poet's idle page; But still, when the mists of Doubt prevail, And we lie becalmed by the shores of Age, We hear from the misty troubled shore The voice of the children gone before, Drawing the soul to its anchorage. A NEWPORT ROMANCE They say that she died of a broken heart (I tell the tale as 't was told to me); But her spirit lives, and her soul is part Of this sad old house by the sea. Her lover was fickle and fine and French: It was nearly a hundred years ago When he sailed away from her armsâpoor wench!â With the Admiral Rochambeau. I marvel much what periwigged phrase Won the heart of this sentimental Quaker, At what gold-laced speech of those modish days She listenedâthe mischief take her! But she kept the posies of mignonette That he gave; and ever as their bloom failed And faded (though with her tears still wet) Her youth with their own exhaled. Till one night, when the sea-fog wrapped a shroud Round spar and spire and tarn and tree, Her soul went up on that lifted cloud From this sad old house by the sea. And ever since then, when the clock strikes two, She walks unbidden from room to room, And the air is filled that she passes through With a subtle, sad perfume. The delicate odor of mignonette, The ghost of a dead-and-gone bouquet, Is all that tells of her story; yet Could she think of a sweeter way? I sit in the sad old house to-night,â Myself a ghost from a farther sea; And I trust that this Quaker woman might, In courtesy, visit me. For the laugh is fled from porch and lawn, And the bugle died from the fort on the hill, And the twitter of girls on the stairs is gone, And the grand piano is still. Somewhere in the darkness a clock strikes two; And there is no sound in the sad old house, But the long veranda dripping with dew, And in the wainscot a mouse. The light of my study-lamp streams out From the library door, but has gone astray In the depths of the darkened hall. Small doubt But the Quakeress knows the way. Was it the trick of a sense o'erwrought With outward watching and inward fret? But I swear that the air just now was fraught With the odor of mignonette! I open the window, and seem almostâ So still lies the oceanâto hear the beat Of its Great Gulf artery off the coast, And to bask in its tropic heat. In my neighbor's windows the gas-lights flare, As the dancers swing in a waltz of Strauss; And I wonder now could I fit that air To the song of this sad old house. And no odor of mignonette there is, But the breath of morn on the dewy lawn; And mayhap from causes as slight as this The quaint old legend is born. But the soul of that subtle, sad perfume, As the spiced embalmings, they say, outlast The mummy laid in his rocky tomb, Awakens my buried past. And I think of the passion that shook my youth, Of its aimless loves and its idle pains, And am thankful now for the certain truth That only the sweet remains. And I hear no rustle of stiff brocade, And I see no face at my library door; For now that the ghosts of my heart are laid, She is viewless for evermore. But whether she came as a faint perfume, Or whether a spirit in stole of white, I feel, as I pass from the darkened room, She has been with my soul to-night! SAN FRANCISCO (FROM THE SEA) Serene, indifferent of Fate, Thou sittest at the Western Gate; Upon thy height, so lately won, Still slant the banners of the sun; Thou seest the white seas strike their tents, O Warder of two continents! And, scornful of the peace that flies Thy angry winds and sullen skies, Thou drawest all things, small or great, To thee, beside the Western Gate. O lion's whelp, that hidest fast In jungle growth of spire and mast! I know thy cunning and thy greed, Thy hard high lust and willful deed, And all thy glory loves to tell Of specious gifts material. Drop down, O Fleecy Fog, and hide Her skeptic sneer and all her pride! Wrap her, O Fog, in gown and hood Of her Franciscan Brotherhood. Hide me her faults, her sin and blame; With thy gray mantle cloak her shame! So shall she, cowlÃ¨d, sit and pray Till morning bears her sins away. Then rise, O Fleecy Fog, and raise The glory of her coming days; Be as the cloud that flecks the seas Above her smoky argosies; When forms familiar shall give place To stranger speech and newer face; When all her throes and anxious fears Lie hushed in the repose of years; When Art shall raise and Culture lift The sensual joys and meaner thrift, And all fulfilled the vision we Who watch and wait shall never see; Who, in the morning of her race, Toiled fair or meanly in our place, But, yielding to the common lot, Lie unrecorded and forgot. THE MOUNTAIN HEART'S-EASE By scattered rocks and turbid waters shifting, By furrowed glade and dell, To feverish men thy calm, sweet face uplifting, Thou stayest them to tell The delicate thought that cannot find expression, For ruder speech too fair, That, like thy petals, trembles in possession, And scatters on the air. The miner pauses in his rugged labor, And, leaning on his spade, Laughingly calls unto his comrade-neighbor To see thy charms displayed. But in his eyes a mist unwonted rises, And for a moment clear Some sweet home face his foolish thought surprises, And passes in a tear,â Some boyish vision of his Eastern village, Of uneventful toil, Where golden harvests followed quiet tillage Above a peaceful soil. One moment only; for the pick, uplifting, Through root and fibre cleaves, And on the muddy current slowly drifting Are swept by bruisÃ¨d leaves. And yet, O poet, in thy homely fashion, Thy work thou dost fulfill, For on the turbid current of his passion Thy face is shining still! GRIZZLY. Coward,âof heroic size, In whose lazy muscles lies Strength we fear and yet despise; Savage,âwhose relentless tusks Are content with acorn husks; Robber,âwhose exploits ne'er soared O'er the bee's or squirrel's hoard; Whiskered chin and feeble nose, Claws of steel on baby toes,â Here, in solitude and shade, Shambling, shuffling plantigrade, Be thy courses undismayed! Here, where Nature makes thy bed, Let thy rude, half-human tread Point to hidden Indian springs, Lost in ferns and fragrant grasses, Hovered o'er by timid wings, Where the wood-duck lightly passes, Where the wild bee holds her sweets,â Epicurean retreats, Fit for thee, and better than Fearful spoils of dangerous man. In thy fat-jowled deviltry Friar Tuck shall live in thee; Thou mayst levy tithe and dole; Thou shalt spread the woodland cheer, From the pilgrim taking toll; Match thy cunning with his fear; Eat, and drink, and have thy fill; Yet remain an outlaw still! MADRONO Captain of the Western wood, Thou that apest Robin Hood! Green above thy scarlet hose, How thy velvet mantle shows! Never tree like thee arrayed, O thou gallant of the glade! When the fervid August sun Scorches all it looks upon, And the balsam of the pine Drips from stem to needle fine, Round thy compact shade arranged, Not a leaf of thee is changed! When the yellow autumn sun Saddens all it looks upon, Spreads its sackcloth on the hills, Strews its ashes in the rills, Thou thy scarlet hose dost doff, And in limbs of purest buff Challengest the sombre glade For a sylvan masquerade. Where, oh, where, shall he begin Who would paint thee, Harlequin? With thy waxen burnished leaf, With thy branches' red relief, With thy polytinted fruit,â In thy spring or autumn suit,â Where begin, and oh, where end, Thou whose charms all art transcend? COYOTE Blown out of the prairie in twilight and dew, Half bold and half timid, yet lazy all through; Loath ever to leave, and yet fearful to stay, He limps in the clearing, an outcast in gray. A shade on the stubble, a ghost by the wall, Now leaping, now limping, now risking a fall, Lop-eared and large-jointed, but ever alway A thoroughly vagabond outcast in gray. Here, Carlo, old fellow,âhe's one of your kind,â Go, seek him, and bring him in out of the wind. What! snarling, my Carlo! So even dogs may Deny their own kin in the outcast in gray. Well, take what you will,âthough it be on the sly, Marauding or begging,âI shall not ask why, But will call it a dole, just to help on his way A four-footed friar in orders of gray! TO A SEA-BIRD (SANTA CRUZ, 1869) Sauntering hither on listless wings, Careless vagabond of the sea, Little thou heedest the surf that sings, The bar that thunders, the shale that rings,â Give me to keep thy company. Little thou hast, old friend, that's new; Storms and wrecks are old things to thee; Sick am I of these changes, too; Little to care for, little to rue,â I on the shore, and thou on the sea. All of thy wanderings, far and near, Bring thee at last to shore and me; All of my journeyings end them here: This our tether must be our cheer,â I on the shore, and thou on the sea. Lazily rocking on ocean's breast, Something in common, old friend, have we: Thou on the shingle seek'st thy nest, I to the waters look for rest,â I on the shore, and thou on the sea. WHAT THE CHIMNEY SANG Over the chimney the night-wind sang And chanted a melody no one knew; And the Woman stopped, as her babe she tossed, And thought of the one she had long since lost, And said, as her teardrops back she forced, âI hate the wind in the chimney.â Over the chimney the night-wind sang And chanted a melody no one knew; And the Children said, as they closer drew, â'T is some witch that is cleaving the black night through, 'T is is a fairy trumpet that just then blew, And we fear the wind in the chimney.â Over the chimney the night-wind sang And chanted a melody no one knew; And the Man, as he sat on his hearth below, Said to himself, âIt will surely snow, And fuel is dear and wages low, And I'll stop the leak in the chimney.â Over the chimney the night-wind sang And chanted a melody no one knew; But the Poet listened and smiled, for he Was Man and Woman and Child, all three, And said, âIt is God's own harmony, This wind we hear in the chimney.â DICKENS IN CAMP Above the pines the moon was slowly drifting, The river sang below; The dim Sierras, far beyond, uplifting Their minarets of snow. The roaring camp-fire, with rude humor, painted The ruddy tints of health On haggard face and form that drooped and fainted In the fierce race for wealth; Till one arose, and from his pack's scant treasure A hoarded volume drew, And cards were dropped from hands of listless leisure To hear the tale anew. And then, while round them shadows gathered faster, And as the firelight fell, He read aloud the book wherein the Master Had writ of âLittle Nell.â Perhaps 't was boyish fancy,âfor the reader Was youngest of them all,â But, as he read, from clustering pine and cedar A silence seemed to fall; The fir-trees, gathering closer in the shadows, Listened in every spray, While the whole camp with âNellâ on English meadows Wandered and lost their way. And so in mountain solitudesâo'ertaken As by some spell divineâ Their cares dropped from them like the needles shaken From out the gusty pine. Lost is that camp and wasted all its fire; And he who wrought that spell? Ah! towering pine and stately Kentish spire, Ye have one tale to tell! Lost is that camp, but let its fragrant story Blend with the breath that thrills With hop-vine's incense all the pensive glory That fills the Kentish hills. And on that grave where English oak and holly And laurel wreaths entwine, Deem it not all a too presumptuous folly, This spray of Western pine! July, 1870. âTWENTY YEARSâ Beg your pardon, old fellow! I think I was dreaming just now when you spoke. The fact is, the musical clink Of the ice on your wine-goblet's brink A chord of my memory woke. And I stood in the pasture-field where Twenty summers ago I had stood; And I heard in that sound, I declare, The clinking of bells in the air, Of the cows coming home from the wood. Then the apple-bloom shook on the hill; And the mullein-stalks tilted each lance; And the sun behind Rapalye's mill Was my uttermost West, and could thrill Like some fanciful land of romance. Then my friend was a hero, and then My girl was an angel. In fine, I drank buttermilk; for at ten Faith asks less to aid her than when At thirty we doubt over wine. Ah, well, it does seem that I must Have been dreaming just now when you spoke, Or lost, very like, in the dust Of the years that slow fashioned the crust On that bottle whose seal you last broke. Twenty years was its age, did you say? Twenty years? Ah, my friend, it is true! All the dreams that have flown since that day, All the hopes in that time passed away, Old friend, I've been drinking with you! FATE âThe sky is clouded, the rocks are bare, The spray of the tempest is white in air; The winds are out with the waves at play, And I shall not tempt the sea to-day. âThe trail is narrow, the wood is dim, The panther clings to the arching limb; And the lion's whelps are abroad at play, And I shall not join in the chase to-day.â But the ship sailed safely over the sea, And the hunters came from the chase in glee; And the town that was builded upon a rock Was swallowed up in the earthquake shock. GRANDMOTHER TENTERDEN (MASSACHUSETTS SHORE, 1800) I mind it was but yesterday: The sun was dim, the air was chill; Below the town, below the hill, The sails of my son's ship did fill,â My Jacob, who was cast away. He said, âGod keep you, mother dear,â But did not turn to kiss his wife; They had some foolish, idle strife; Her tongue was like a two-edged knife, And he was proud as any peer. Howbeit that night I took no note Of sea nor sky, for all was drear; I marked not that the hills looked near, Nor that the moon, though curved and clear, Through curd-like scud did drive and float. For with my darling went the joy Of autumn woods and meadows brown; I came to hate the little town; It seemed as if the sun went down With him, my only darling boy. It was the middle of the night: The wind, it shifted west-by-south,â It piled high up the harbor mouth; The marshes, black with summer drouth, Were all abroad with sea-foam white. It was the middle of the night: The sea upon the garden leapt, And my son's wife in quiet slept, And I, his mother, waked and wept, When lo! there came a sudden light. And there he stood! His seaman's dress All wet and dripping seemed to be; The pale blue fires of the sea Dripped from his garments constantly,â I could not speak through cowardness. âI come through night and storm,â he said, âThrough storm and night and death,â said he, âTo kiss my wife, if it so be That strife still holds 'twixt her and me, For all beyond is peace,â he said. âThe sea is His, and He who sent The wind and wave can soothe their strife; And brief and foolish is our life.â He stooped and kissed his sleeping wife, Then sighed, and like a dream he went. Now, when my darling kissed not me, But herâhis wifeâwho did not wake, My heart within me seemed to break; I swore a vow, nor thenceforth spake Of what my clearer eyes did see. And when the slow weeks brought him not, Somehow we spake of aught beside: For sheâher hope upheld her pride; And Iâin me all hope had died, And my son passed as if forgot. It was about the next springtide: She pined and faded where she stood, Yet spake no word of ill or good; She had the hard, cold Edwards' blood In all her veinsâand so she died. One time I thought, before she passed, To give her peace; but ere I spake Methought, âHe will be first to break The news in heaven,â and for his sake I held mine back until the last. And here I sit, nor care to roam; I only wait to hear his call. I doubt not that this day next fall Shall see me safe in port, where all And every ship at last comes home. And you have sailed the Spanish Main, And knew my Jacob? ... Eh! Mercy! Ah! God of wisdom! hath the sea Yielded its dead to humble me? My boy! ... My Jacob! ... Turn again! GUILD'S SIGNAL [William Guild was engineer of the train which on the 19th of April, 1873, plunged into Meadow Brook, on the line of the Stonington and Providence Railroad. It was his custom, as often as he passed his home, to whistle an âAll 's wellâ to his wife. He was found, after the disaster, dead, with his hand on the throttle-valve of his engine.] Two low whistles, quaint and clear: That was the signal the engineerâ That was the signal that Guild, 't is saidâ Gave to his wife at Providence, As through the sleeping town, and thence, Out in the night, On to the light, Down past the farms, lying white, he sped! As a husband's greeting, scant, no doubt, Yet to the woman looking out, Watching and waiting, no serenade, Love-song, or midnight roundelay Said what that whistle seemed to say: âTo my trust true, So, love, to you! Working or waiting, good-night!â it said. Brisk young bagmen, tourists fine, Old commuters along the line, Brakemen and porters glanced ahead, Smiled as the signal, sharp, intense, Pierced through the shadows of Providence: âNothing amissâ Nothing!âit is Only Guild calling his wife,â they said. Summer and winter the old refrain Rang o'er the billows of ripening grain, Pierced through the budding boughs o'erhead, Flew down the track when the red leaves burned Like living coals from the engine spurned; Sang as it flew, âTo our trust true, First of all, duty. Good-night!â it said. And then, one night, it was heard no more From Stonington over Rhode Island shore, And the folk in Providence smiled and said As they turned in their beds, âThe engineer Has once forgotten his midnight cheer.â One only knew, To his trust true, Guild lay under his engine, dead. ASPIRING MISS DE LAINE (A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE) Certain facts which serve to explain The physical charms of Miss Addie De Laine, Who, as the common reports obtain, Surpassed in complexion the lily and rose; With a very sweet mouth and a retroussÃ© nose; A figure like Hebe's, or that which revolves In a milliner's window, and partially solves That question which mentor and moralist pains, If grace may exist minus feeling or brains. Of course the young lady had beaux by the score, All that she wanted,âwhat girl could ask more? Lovers that sighed and lovers that swore, Lovers that danced and lovers that played, Men of profession, of leisure, and trade; But one, who was destined to take the high part Of holding that mythical treasure, her heart,â This lover, the wonder and envy of town, Was a practicing chemist, a fellow called Brown. I might here remark that 't was doubted by many, In regard to the heart, if Miss Addie had any; But no one could look in that eloquent face, With its exquisite outline and features of grace, And mark, through the transparent skin, how the tide Ebbed and flowed at the impulse of passion or pride,â None could look, who believed in the blood's circulation As argued by Harvey, but saw confirmation That here, at least, Nature had triumphed o'er art, And as far as complexion went she had a heart. But this par parenthesis. Brown was the man Preferred of all others to carry her fan, Hook her glove, drape her shawl, and do all that a belle May demand of the lover she wants to treat well. Folks wondered and stared that a fellow called Brownâ Abstracted and solemn, in manner a clown, Ill dressed, with a lingering smell of the shopâ Should appear as her escort at party or hop. Some swore he had cooked up some villainous charm, Or love philter, not in the regular Pharmâ AcopÅia, and thus, from pure malice prepense, Had bewitched and bamboozled the young lady's sense; Others thought, with more reason, the secret to lie In a magical wash or indelible dye; While Society, with its censorious eye And judgment impartial, stood ready to damn What was n't improper as being a sham. For a fortnight the townfolk had all been agog With a party, the finest the season had seen, To be given in honor of Miss Pollywog, Who was just coming out as a belle of sixteen. The guests were invited; but one night before A carriage drew up at the modest back door Of Brown's lab'ratory, and, full in the glare Of a big purple bottle, some closely veiled fair Alighted and entered: to make matters plain, Spite of veils and disguises, 't was Addie De Laine. As a bower for true love, 't was hardly the one That a lady would choose to be wooed in or won: No odor of rose or sweet jessamine's sigh Breathed a fragrance to hallow their pledge of troth by, Nor the balm that exhales from the odorous thyme; But the gaseous effusions of chloride of lime, And salts, which your chemist delights to explain As the base of the smell of the rose and the drain. Think of this, O ye lovers of sweetness! and know What you smell when you snuff up Lubin or Pinaud. I pass by the greetings, the transports and bliss, Which of course duly followed a meeting like this, And come down to business,âfor such the intent Of the lady who now o'er the crucible leant, In the glow of a furnace of carbon and lime, Like a fairy called up in the new pantomime,â And give but her words, as she coyly looked down In reply to the questioning glances of Brown: âI am taking the drops, and am using the paste, And the little white powders that had a sweet taste, Which you told me would brighten the glance of my eye, And the depilatory, and also the dye, And I'm charmed with the trial; and now, my dear Brown, I have one other favor,ânow, ducky, don't frown,â Only one, for a chemist and genius like you But a trifle, and one you can easily do. Now listen: to-morrow, you know, is the night Of the birthday soirÃ©e of that Pollywog fright; And I'm to be there, and the dress I shall wear Is too lovely; butâââBut what then, ma chÃ¨re?â Said Brown, as the lady came to a full stop, And glanced round the shelves of the little back shop. âWell, I wantâI want something to fill out the skirt To the proper dimensions, without being girt In a stiff crinoline, or caged in a hoop That shows through one's skirt like the bars of a coop; Something light, that a lady may waltz in, or polk, With a freedom that none but you masculine folk Ever know. For, however poor woman aspires, She's always bound down to the earth by these wires. Are you listening? Nonsense! don't stare like a spoon, Idiotic; some light thing, and spacious, and soonâ Something likeâwell, in factâsomething like a balloon!â Here she paused; and here Brown, overcome by surprise, Gave a doubting assent with still wondering eyes, And the lady departed. But just at the door Something happened,â't is true, it had happened before In this sanctum of science,âa sibilant sound, Like some element just from its trammels unbound, Or two substances that their affinities found. The night of the anxiously looked for soirÃ©e Had come, with its fair ones in gorgeous array; With the rattle of wheels and the tinkle of bells, And the âHow do ye do'sâ and the âHope you are well's; And the crush in the passage, and last lingering look You give as you hang your best hat on the hook; The rush of hot air as the door opens wide; And your entry,âthat blending of self-possessed pride And humility shown in your perfect-bred stare At the folk, as if wondering how they got there; With other tricks worthy of Vanity Fair. Meanwhile, the safe topic, the heat of the room, Already was losing its freshness and bloom; Young people were yawning, and wondering when The dance would come off, and why did n't it then: When a vague expectation was thrilling the crowd, Lo! the door swung its hinges with utterance proud! And Pompey announced, with a trumpet-like strain, The entrance of Brown and Miss Addie De Laine. She entered; but oh! how imperfect the verb To express to the senses her movement superb! To say that she âsailed inâ more clearly might tell Her grace in its buoyant and billowy swell. Her robe was a vague circumambient space, With shadowy boundaries made of point-lace; The rest was but guesswork, and well might defy The power of critical feminine eye To define or describe: 't were as futile to try The gossamer web of the cirrus to trace, Floating far in the blue of a warm summer sky. 'Midst the humming of praises and glances of beaux That greet our fair maiden wherever she goes, Brown slipped like a shadow, grim, silent, and black, With a look of anxiety, close in her track. Once he whispered aside in her delicate ear A sentence of warning,âit might be of fear: âDon't stand in a draught, if you value your life.â (Nothing more,âsuch advice might be given your wife Or your sweetheart, in times of bronchitis and cough, Without mystery, romance, or frivolous scoff.) But hark to the music; the dance has begun. The closely draped windows wide open are flung; The notes of the piccolo, joyous and light, Like bubbles burst forth on the warm summer night. Round about go the dancers; in circles they fly; Trip, trip, go their feet as their skirts eddy by; And swifter and lighter, but somewhat too plain, Whisks the fair circumvolving Miss Addie De Laine. Taglioni and Cerito well might have pined For the vigor and ease that her movements combined; E'en Rigelboche never flung higher her robe In the naughtiest city that's known on the globe. 'T was amazing, 't was scandalous; lost in surprise, Some opened their mouths, and a few shut their eyes. But hark! At the moment Miss Addie De Laine, Circling round at the outer edge of an ellipse Which brought her fair form to the window again, From the arms of her partner incautiously slips! And a shriek fills the air, and the music is still, And the crowd gather round where her partner forlorn Still frenziedly points from the wide window-sill Into space and the night; for Miss Addie was gone! Gone like the bubble that bursts in the sun; Gone like the grain when the reaper is done; Gone like the dew on the fresh morning grass; Gone without parting farewell; and alas! Gone with a flavor of hydrogen gas! When the weather is pleasant, you frequently meet A white-headed man slowly pacing the street; His trembling hand shading his lack-lustre eye, Half blind with continually scanning the sky. Rumor points him as some astronomical sage, Re-perusing by day the celestial page; But the reader, sagacious, will recognize Brown, Trying vainly to conjure his lost sweetheart down, And learn the stern moral this story must teach, That Genius may lift its love out of its reach. A LEGEND OF COLOGNE Above the bones St. Ursula owns, And those of the virgins she chaperons; Above the boats, And the bridge that floats, And the Rhine and the steamers' smoky throats; Above the chimneys and quaint-tiled roofs, Above the clatter of wheels and hoofs; Above Newmarket's open space, Above that consecrated place Where the genuine bones of the Magi seen are, And the dozen shops of the real Farina; Higher than even old Hohestrasse, Whose houses threaten the timid passer,â Above them all, Through scaffolds tall, And spires like delicate limbs in splinters, The great Cologne's Cathedral stones Climb through the storms of eight hundred winters. Unfinished there, In high mid-air The towers halt like a broken prayer; Through years belated, Unconsummated, The hope of its architect quite frustrated. Its very youth They say, forsooth, With a quite improper purpose mated; And every stone With a curse of its own Instead of that sermon Shakespeare stated, Since the day its choir, Which all admire, By Cologne's Archbishop was consecrated. Ah! that was a day, One well might say, To be marked with the largest, whitest stone To be found in the towers of all Cologne! Along the Rhine, From old Rheinstein, The people flowed like their own good wine. From Rudesheim, And Geisenheim, And every spot that is known to rhyme; From the famed Cat's Castle of St. Goarshausen, To the pictured roofs of Assmannshausen, And down the track, From quaint Schwalbach To the clustering tiles of Bacharach; From Bingen, hence To old Coblentz: From every castellated crag, Where the robber chieftains kept their âswag,â The folk flowed in, and Ober-Cassel Shone with the pomp of knight and vassal; And pouring in from near and far, As the Rhine to its bosom draws the Ahr, Or takes the arm of the sober Mosel, So in Cologne, knight, squire, and losel. Choked up the city's gates with men From old St. Stephen to Zint MÃ¤rjen. What had they come to see? Ah me! I fear no glitter of pageantry, Nor sacred zeal For Church's weal, Nor faith in the virgins' bones to heal; Nor childlike trust in frank confession Drew these, who, dyed in deep transgression, Still in each nest On every crest Kept stolen goods in their possession; But only their goÃ»t For something new, More rare than the âroastâ of a wandering Jew; Orâto be exactâ To seeâin factâ A Christian soul, in the very act Of being damned, secundum artem, By the devil, before a soul could part 'em. For a rumor had flown Throughout Cologne That the church, in fact, was the devil's own; That its architect (Being long âsuspectâ) Had confessed to the Bishop that he had wrecked Not only his own soul, but had lost The very first Christian soul that crossed The sacred threshold: and all, in fine, For that very beautiful design Of the wonderful choir They were pleased to admire. And really, he must be allowed to sayâ To speak in a purely business wayâ That, taking the ruling market prices Of souls and churches, in such a crisis It would be shownâ And his Grace must ownâ It was really a bargain for Cologne! Such was the tale That turned cheeks pale With the thought that the enemy might prevail, And the church doors snap With a thunderclap On a Christian soul in that devil's trap. But a wiser few, Who thought that they knew Cologne's Archbishop, replied, âPooh, pooh! Just watch him and wait, And as sure as fate, You'll find that the Bishop will give checkmate.â One here might note How the popular vote, As shown in all legends and anecdote, Declares that a breach Of trust to o'erreach The devil is something quite proper for each. And, really, if you Give the devil his due In spite of the proverbâit's something you'll rue. But to lie and deceive him, To use and to leave him, From Job up to Faust is the way to receive him, Though no one has heard It ever averred That the âFather of Liesâ ever yet broke his word, But has left this position, In every tradition, To be taken alone by the âtruth-lovingâ Christian! Bom! from the tower! It is the hour! The host pours in, in its pomp and power Of banners and pyx, And high crucifix, And crosiers and other processional sticks, And no end of Marys In quaint reliquaries, To gladden the souls of all true antiquaries; And an Osculum Pacis (A myth to the masses Who trusted their bones more to mail and cuirasses)â All borne by the throng Who are marching along To the square of the Dom with processional song, With the flaring of dips, And bending of hips, And the chanting of hundred perfunctory lips; And some good little boys Who had come up from Neuss And the Quirinuskirche to show off their voice: All march to the square Of the great Dom, and there File right and left, leaving alone and quite bare A covered sedan, Containingâso ran The rumorâthe victim to take off the ban. They have left it alone, They have sprinkled each stone Of the porch with a sanctified Eau de Cologne, Guaranteed in this case To disguise every trace Of a sulphurous presence in that sacred place. Two Carmelites stand On the right and left hand Of the covered sedan chair, to wait the command Of the prelate to throw Up the cover and show The form of the victim in terror below. There's a pause and a prayer, Then the signal, and thereâ Is a woman!âby all that is good and is fair! A woman! and known To them allâone must own Too well known to the many, to-day to be shown As a martyr, or e'en As a Christian! A queen Of pleasance and revel, of glitter and sheen; So bad that the worst Of Cologne spake up first, And declared 't was an outrage to suffer one curst, And already a fief Of the Satanic chief, To martyr herself for the Church's relief. But in vain fell their sneer On the mob, who I fear On the whole felt a strong disposition to cheer. A woman! and there She stands in the glare Of the pitiless sun and their pitying stare,â A woman still young, With garments that clung To a figure, though wasted with passion and wrung With remorse and despair, Yet still passing fair, With jewels and gold in her dark shining hair, And cheeks that are faint 'Neath her dyes and her paint. A woman most surelyâbut hardly a saint! She moves. She has gone From their pity and scorn; She has mounted alone The first step of stone, And the high swinging doors she wide open has thrown, Then pauses and turns, As the altar blaze burns On her cheeks, and with one sudden gesture she spurns Archbishop and Prior, Knight, ladye, and friar, And her voice rings out high from the vault of the choir. âO men of Cologne! What I was ye have known; What I am, as I stand here, One knoweth alone. If it be but His will I shall pass from Him still, Lost, curst, and degraded, I reckon no ill; If still by that sign Of His anger divine One soul shall be saved, He hath blessed more than mine. O men of Cologne! Stand forth, if ye own A faith like to this, or more fit to atone, And take ye my place, And God give you grace To stand and confront Him, like me, face to face!â She paused. Yet aloof They all stand. No reproof Breaks the silence that fills the celestial roof. One instantâno moreâ She halts at the door, Then enters! ... A flood from the roof to the floor Fills the church rosy red. She is gone! But instead, Who is this leaning forward with glorified head And hands stretched to save? Sure this is no slave Of the Powers of Darkness, with aspect so brave! They press to the door, But too late! All is o'er. Naught remains but a woman's form prone on the floor But they still see a trace Of that glow in her face That they saw in the light of the altar's high blaze On the image that stands With the babe in its hands Enshrined in the churches of all Christian lands. A Te Deum sung, A censer high swung, With praise, benediction, and incense wide-flung, Proclaim that the curse Is removedâand no worse Is the Dom for the trialâin fact, the reverse; For instead of their losing A soul in abusing The Evil One's faith, they gained one of his choosing. Thus the legend is told: You will find in the old Vaulted aisles of the Dom, stiff in marble or cold In iron and brass, In gown and cuirass, The knights, priests, and bishops who came to that Mass; And high o'er the rest, With her babe at her breast, The image of Mary Madonna the blest. But you look round in vain, On each high pictured pane, For the woman most worthy to walk in her train. Yet, standing to-day O'er the dust and the clay, 'Midst the ghosts of a life that has long passed away, With the slow-sinking sun Looking softly upon That stained-glass procession, I scarce miss the one That it does not reveal, For I know and I feel That these are but shadowsâthe woman was real! THE TALE OF A PONY Name of my heroine, simply âRose;â Surname, tolerable only in prose; Habitat, Paris,âthat is where She resided for change of air; Ãtat twenty; complexion fair; Rich, good looking, and dÃ©bonnaire; Smarter than Jersey lightning. There! That's her photograph, done with care. In Paris, whatever they do besides, Every lady in full dress rides! Moire antiques you never meet Sweeping the filth of a dirty street; But every woman's claim to ton Depends upon The team she drives, whether phaeton, Landau, or britzka. Hence it's plain That Rose, who was of her toilet vain, Should have a team that ought to be Equal to any in all Paris! âBring forth the horse!â The commissaire Bowed, and brought Miss Rose a pair Leading an equipage rich and rare. Why doth that lovely lady stare? Why? The tail of the off gray mare Is bobbed, by all that's good and fair! Like the shaving-brushes that soldiers wear, Scarcely showing as much back hair As Tam O'Shanter's âMeg,ââand there, Lord knows, she'd little enough to spare. That stare and frown the Frenchman knew, But did as well-bred Frenchmen do: Raised his shoulders above his crown, Joined his thumbs with the fingers down, And said, âAh, Heaven!ââthen, âMademoiselle, Delay one minute, and all is well!â He wentâreturned; by what good chance These things are managed so well in France I cannot say, but he made the sale, And the bob-tailed mare had a flowing tail. All that is false in this world below Betrays itself in a love of show; Indignant Nature hides her lash In the purple-black of a dyed mustache; The shallowest fop will trip in French, The would-be critic will misquote Trench; In short, you're always sure to detect A sham in the things folks most affect; Bean-pods are noisiest when dry, And you always wink with your weakest eye: And that's the reason the old gray mare Forever had her tail in the air, With flourishes beyond compare, Though every whisk Incurred the risk Of leaving that sensitive region bare. She did some things that you could n't but feel She would n't have done had her tail been real. Champs ElysÃ©es: time, past five. There go the carriages,âlook alive! Everything that man can drive, Or his inventive skill contrive,â Yankee buggy or English âchay,â Dog-cart, droschky, and smart coupÃ©, A dÃ©sobligeante quite bulky (French idea of a Yankee sulky); Band in the distance playing a march, Footman standing stiff as starch; Savans, lorettes, deputies, Arch- Bishops, and there together range Sous-lieutenants and cent-gardes (strange Way these soldier-chaps make change), Mixed with black-eyed Polish dames, With unpronounceable awful names; Laces tremble and ribbons flout, Coachmen wrangle and gendarmes shoutâ Bless us! what is the row about? Ah! here comes Rosy's new turnout! Smart! You bet your life 't was that! Nifty! (short for magnificat). Mulberry panels,âheraldic spread,â Ebony wheels picked out with red, And two gray mares that were thoroughbred: No wonder that every dandy's head Was turned by the turnout,âand 't was said That Caskowhisky (friend of the Czar), A very good whip (as Russians are), Was tied to Rosy's triumphal car, Entranced, the reader will understand, By âribbonsâ that graced her head and hand. Alas! the hour you think would crown Your highest wishes should let you down! Or Fate should turn, by your own mischance, Your victor's car to an ambulance, From cloudless heavens her lightnings glance! (And these things happen, even in France.) And so Miss Rose, as she trotted by, The cynosure of every eye, Saw to her horror the off mare shy, Flourish her tail so exceedingly high That, disregarding the closest tie, And without giving a reason why, She flung that tail so free and frisky Off in the face of Caskowhisky. Excuses, blushes, smiles: in fine, End of the pony's tail, and mine! ON A CONE OF THE BIG TREES (SEQUOIA GIGANTEA) Brown foundling of the Western wood, Babe of primeval wildernesses! Long on my table thou hast stood Encounters strange and rude caresses; Perchance contented with thy lot, Surroundings new, and curious faces, As though ten centuries were not Imprisoned in thy shining cases. Thou bring'st me back the halcyon days Of grateful rest, the week of leisure, The journey lapped in autumn haze, The sweet fatigue that seemed a pleasure, The morning ride, the noonday halt, The blazing slopes, the red dust rising, And then the dim, brown, columned vault, With its cool, damp, sepulchral spicing. Once more I see the rocking masts That scrape the sky, their only tenant The jay-bird, that in frolic casts From some high yard his broad blue pennant. I see the Indian files that keep Their places in the dusty heather, Their red trunks standing ankle-deep In moccasins of rusty leather. I see all this, and marvel much That thou, sweet woodland waif, art able To keep the company of such As throng thy friend'sâthe poet'sâtable: The latest spawn the press hath cast,â The âmodern Popes,â âthe later Byrons,ââ Why, e'en the best may not outlast Thy poor relationâSempervirens. Thy sire saw the light that shone On Mohammed's uplifted crescent, On many a royal gilded throne And deed forgotten in the present; He saw the age of sacred trees And Druid groves and mystic larches; And saw from forest domes like these The builder bring his Gothic arches. And must thou, foundling, still forego Thy heritage and high ambition, To lie full lowly and full low, Adjusted to thy new condition? Not hidden in the drifted snows, But under ink-drops idly spattered, And leaves ephemeral as those That on thy woodland tomb were scattered? Yet lie thou there, O friend! and speak The moral of thy simple story: Though life is all that thou dost seek, And age alone thy crown of glory, Not thine the only germs that fail The purpose of their high creation, If their poor tenements avail For worldly show and ostentation. LONE MOUNTAIN (CEMETERY, SAN FRANCISCO) This is that hill of awe That Persian Sindbad saw,â The mount magnetic; And on its seaward face, Scattered along its base, The wrecks prophetic. Here come the argosies Blown by each idle breeze, To and fro shifting; Yet to the hill of Fate All drawing, soon or late,â Day by day drifting; Drifting forever here Barks that for many a year Braved wind and weather; Shallops but yesterday Launched on yon shining bay,â Drawn all together. This is the end of all: Sun thyself by the wall, O poorer Hindbad! Envy not Sindbad's fame: Here come alike the same Hindbad and Sindbad. ALNASCHAR Here's yer toy balloons! All sizes! Twenty cents for that. It rises Jest as quick as that 'ere, Miss, Twice as big. Ye see it is Some more fancy. Make it square Fifty for 'em both. That's fair. That's the sixth I've sold since noon. Trade's reviving. Just as soon As this lot's worked off, I'll take Wholesale figgers. Make or break,â That's my motto! Then I'll buy In some first-class lottery One half ticket, numbered rightâ As I dreamed about last night. That'll fetch it. Don't tell me! When a man 's in luck, you see, All things help him. Every chance Hits him like an avalanche. Here's your toy balloons, Miss. Eh? You won't turn your face this way? Mebbe you'll be glad some day. With that clear ten thousand prize This 'yer trade I'll drop, and rise Into wholesale. No! I'll take Stocks in Wall Street. Make or break,â That's my motto! With my luck, Where's the chance of being stuck? Call it sixty thousand, clear, Made in Wall Street in one year. Sixty thousand! Umph! Let's see! Bond and mortgage'll do for me. Good! That gal that passed me by Scornful likeâwhy, mebbe I Some day'll hold in pawnâwhy not?â All her father's prop. She'll spot What's my little game, and see What I'm after's her. He! he! He! He! When she comes to sueâ Let's see! What's the thing to do? Kick her? No! There's the perliss! Sorter throw her off like this. Hello! Stop! Help! Murder! Hey! There's my whole stock got away, Kiting on the house-tops! Lost! All a poor man's fortin! Cost? Twenty dollars! Eh! What's this? Fifty cents! God bless ye, Miss! THE TWO SHIPS As I stand by the cross on the lone mountain's crest, Looking over the ultimate sea, In the gloom of the mountain a ship lies at rest, And one sails away from the lea: One spreads its white wings on a far-reaching track, With pennant and sheet flowing free; One hides in the shadow with sails laid aback,â The ship that is waiting for me! But lo! in the distance the clouds break away, The Gate's glowing portals I see; And I hear from the outgoing ship in the bay The song of the sailors in glee. So I think of the luminous footprints that bore The comfort o'er dark Galilee, And wait for the signal to go to the shore, To the ship that is waiting for me. ADDRESS (OPENING OF THE CALIFORNIA THEATRE, SAN FRANCISCO, JANUARY 19, 1870) Brief words, when actions wait, are well: The prompter's hand is on his bell; The coming heroes, lovers, kings, Are idly lounging at the wings; Behind the curtain's mystic fold The glowing future lies unrolled; And yet, one moment for the Past, One retrospect,âthe first and last. âThe world's a stage,â the Master said. To-night a mightier truth is read: Not in the shifting canvas screen, The flash of gas or tinsel sheen; Not in the skill whose signal calls From empty boards baronial halls; But, fronting sea and curving bay, Behold the players and the play. Ah, friends! beneath your real skies The actor's short-lived triumph dies: On that broad stage of empire won, Whose footlights were the setting sun, Whose flats a distant background rose In trackless peaks of endless snows; Here genius bows, and talent waits To copy that but One creates. Your shifting scenes: the league of sand, An avenue by ocean spanned; The narrow beach of straggling tents, A mile of stately monuments; Your standard, lo! a flag unfurled, Whose clinging folds clasp half the world,â This is your drama, built on facts, With âtwenty years between the acts.â One moment more: if here we raise The oft-sung hymn of local praise, Before the curtain facts must sway; Here waits the moral of your play. Glassed in the poet's thought, you view What money can, yet cannot do; The faith that soars, the deeds that shine, Above the gold that builds the shrine. And oh! when others take our place, And Earth's green curtain hides our face, Ere on the stage, so silent now, The last new hero makes his bow: So may our deeds, recalled once more In Memory's sweet but brief encore, Down all the circling ages run, With the world's plaudit of âWell done!â DOLLY VARDEN Dear Dolly! who does not recall The thrilling page that pictured all Those charms that held our sense in thrall Just as the artist caught her,â As down that English lane she tripped, In bowered chintz, hat sideways tipped, Trim-bodiced, bright-eyed, roguish-lipped,â The locksmith's pretty daughter? Sweet fragment of the Master's art! O simple faith! O rustic heart! O maid that hath no counterpart In life's dry, dog-eared pages! Where shall we find thy like? Ah, stay! Methinks I saw her yesterday In chintz that flowered, as one might say, Perennial for ages. Her father's modest cot was stone, Five stories high; in style and tone Composite, and, I frankly own, Within its walls revealing Some certain novel, strange ideas: A Gothic door with Roman piers, And floors removed some thousand years From their Pompeian ceiling. The small salon where she received Was Louis Quatorze, and relieved By Chinese cabinets, conceived Grotesquely by the heathen; The sofas were a classic sight,â The Roman bench (sedilia hight); The chairs were French in gold and white, And one Elizabethan. And she, the goddess of that shrine, Two ringed fingers placed in mine,â The stones were many carats fine, And of the purest water,â Then dropped a curtsy, far enough To fairly fill her cretonne puff And show the petticoat's rich stuff That her fond parent bought her. Her speech was simple as her dress,â Not French the more, but English less, She loved; yet sometimes, I confess, I scarce could comprehend her. Her manners were quite far from shy. There was a quiet in her eye Appalling to the Hugh who'd try With rudeness to offend her. âBut whence,â I cried, âthis masquerade? Some figure for to-night's charade, A Watteau shepherdess or maid?â She smiled and begged my pardon: âWhy, surely you must know the name,â That woman who was Shakespeare's flame Or Byron's,âwell, it's all the same: Why, Lord! I'm Dolly Varden!â TELEMACHUS VERSUS MENTOR Don't mind me, I beg you, old fellow,âI'll do very well here alone; You must not be kept from your âGermanâ because I've dropped in like a stone. Leave all ceremony behind you, leave all thought of aught but yourself; And leave, if you like, the Madeira, and a dozen cigars on the shelf. As for me, you will say to your hostessâwell, I scarcely need give you a cue. Chant my praise! All will list to Apollo, though Mercury pipe to a few. Say just what you please, my dear boy; there's more eloquence lies in youth's rash Outspoken heart-impulse than ever growled under this grizzling mustache. Go, don the dress coat of our tyrant,âyouth's panoplied armor for fight,â And tie the white neckcloth that rumples, like pleasure, and lasts but a night; And pray the Nine Gods to avert you what time the Three Sisters shall frown, And you'll lose your high-comedy figure, and sit more at ease in your gown. He's off! There's his foot on the staircase. By Jove, what a bound! Really now Did I ever leap like this springald, with Love's chaplet green on my brow? Was I such an ass? No, I fancy. Indeed, I remember quite plain A gravity mixed with my transports, a cheerfulness softened my pain. He's gone! There's the slam of his cab door, there's the clatter of hoofs and the wheels; And while he the light toe is tripping, in this armchair I'll tilt up my heels. He's gone, and for what? For a tremor from a waist like a teetotum spun; For a rosebud that's crumpled by many before it is gathered by one. Is there naught in the halo of youth but the glow of a passionate raceâ 'Midst the cheers and applause of a crowdâto the goal of a beautiful face? A race that is not to the swift, a prize that no merits enforce, But is won by some fainÃ©ant youth, who shall simply walk over the course? Poor boy! shall I shock his conceit? When he talks of her cheek's loveliness, Shall I say 't was the air of the room, and was due to carbonic excess? That when waltzing she drooped on his breast, and the veins of her eyelids grew dim, 'T was oxygen's absence she felt, but never the presence of him? Shall I tell him first love is a fraud, a weakling that's strangled in birth, Recalled with perfunctory tears, but lost in unsanctified mirth? Or shall I go bid him believe in all womankind's charm, and forget In the light ringing laugh of the world the rattlesnake's gay castanet? Shall I tear out a leaf from my heart, from that book that forever is shut On the past? Shall I speak of my first loveâAugustaâmy Lalage? But I forget. Was it really Augusta? No. 'T was Lucy! No. Mary! No. Di! Never mind! they were all first and faithless, and yetâI've forgotten just why. No, no! Let him dream on and ever. Alas! he will waken too soon; And it does n't look well for October to always be preaching at June. Poor boy! All his fond foolish trophies pinned yonderâa bow from her hair, A few billets-doux, invitations, andâwhat's this? My name, I declare! Humph! âYou'll come, for I've got you a prize, with beauty and money no end: You know her, I think; 't was on dit she once was engaged to your friend; But she says that's all over.â Ah, is it? Sweet Ethel! incomparable maid! Orâwhat if the thing were a trick?âthis letter so freely displayed!â My opportune presence! No! nonsense! Will nobody answer the bell? Call a cab! Half past ten. Not too late yet. Oh, Ethel! Why don't you go? Well? âMaster said you would waitââHang your master! âHave I ever a message to send?â Yes tell him I've gone to the German to dance with the friend of his friend. WHAT THE WOLF REALLY SAID TO LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD Wondering maiden, so puzzled and fair, Why dost thou murmur and ponder and stare? âWhy are my eyelids so open and wild?â Only the better to see with, my child! Only the better and clearer to view Cheeks that are rosy and eyes that are blue. Dost thou still wonder, and ask why these arms Fill thy soft bosom with tender alarms, Swaying so wickedly? Are they misplaced Clasping or shielding some delicate waist? Hands whose coarse sinews may fill you with fear Only the better protect you, my dear! Little Red Riding-Hood, when in the street, Why do I press your small hand when we meet? Why, when you timidly offered your cheek, Why did I sigh, and why did n't I speak? Why, well: you seeâif the truth must appearâ I'm not your grandmother, Riding-Hood, dear! HALF AN HOUR BEFORE SUPPER âSo she's here, your unknown Dulcinea, the lady you met on the train, And you really believe she would know you if you were to meet her again?â âOf course,â he replied, âshe would know me; there never was womankind yet Forgot the effect she inspired. She excuses, but does not forget.â âThen you told her your love?â asked the elder. The younger looked up with a smile: âI sat by her side half an hourâwhat else was I doing the while? âWhat, sit by the side of a woman as fair as the sun in the sky, And look somewhere else lest the dazzle flash back from your own to her eye? âNo, I hold that the speech of the tongue be as frank and as bold as the look, And I held up herself to herself,âthat was more than she got from her book.â âYoung blood!â laughed the elder; âno doubt you are voicing the mode of To-Day: But then we old fogies at least gave the lady some chance for delay. âThere's my wife (you must know),âwe first met on the journey from Florence to Rome: It took me three weeks to discover who was she and where was her home; âThree more to be duly presented; three more ere I saw her again; And a year ere my romance began where yours ended that day on the train.â âOh, that was the style of the stage-coach; we travel to-day by express; Forty miles to the hour,â he answered, âwon't admit of a passion that's less.â âBut what if you make a mistake?â quoth the elder. The younger half sighed. âWhat happens when signals are wrong or switches misplaced?â he replied. âVery well, I must bow to your wisdom,â the elder returned, âbut submit Your chances of winning this woman your boldness has bettered no whit. âWhy, you do not at best know her name. And what if I try your ideal With something, if not quite so fair, at least more en rÃ¨gle and real? âLet me find you a partner. Nay, come, I insistâyou shall followâthis way. My dear, will you not add your grace to entreat Mr. Rapid to stay? âMy wife, Mr. RapidâEh, what! Why, he's goneâyet he said he would come. How rude! I don't wonder, my dear, you are properly crimson and dumb!â WHAT THE BULLET SANG O joy of creation To be! O rapture to fly And be free! Be the battle lost or won, Though its smoke shall hide the sun, I shall find my love,âthe one Born for me! I shall know him where he stands, All alone, With the power in his hands Not o'erthrown; I shall know him by his face, By his godlike front and grace; I shall hold him for a space, All my own! It is heâO my love! So bold! It is Iâall thy love Foretold! It is I. O love! what bliss! Dost thou answer to my kiss? O sweetheart! what is this Lieth there so cold? THE OLD CAMP-FIRE Now shift the blanket pad before your saddle back you fling, And draw your cinch up tighter till the sweat drops from the ring: We've a dozen miles to cover ere we reach the next divide. Our limbs are stiffer now than when we first set out to ride, And worse, the horses know it, and feel the leg-grip tire, Since in the days when, long ago, we sought the old camp-fire. Yes, twenty years! Lord! how we'd scent its incense down the trail, Through balm of bay and spice of spruce, when eye and ear would fail, And worn and faint from useless quest we crept, like this, to rest, Or, flushed with luck and youthful hope, we rode, like this, abreast. Ay! straighten up, old friend, and let the mustang think he's nigher, Through looser rein and stirrup strain, the welcome old camp-fire. You know the shout that would ring out before us down the glade, And start the blue jays like a flight of arrows through the shade, And sift the thin pine needles down like slanting, shining rain, And send the squirrels scampering back to their holes again, Until we saw, blue-veiled and dim, or leaping like desire, That flame of twenty years ago, which lit the old camp fire. And then that rest on Nature's breast, when talk had dropped, and slow The night wind went from tree to tree with challenge soft and low! We lay on lazy elbows propped, or stood to stir the flame, Till up the soaring redwood's shaft our shadows danced and came, As if to draw us with the sparks, high o'er its unseen spire, To the five stars that kept their ward above the old camp-fire,â Those picket stars whose tranquil watch half soothed, half shamed our sleep. What recked we then what beasts or men around might lurk or creep? We lay and heard with listless ears the far-off panther's cry, The near coyote's snarling snap, the grizzly's deep-drawn sigh, The brown bear's blundering human tread, the gray wolves' yelping choir Beyond the magic circle drawn around the old camp-fire. And then that morn! Was ever morn so filled with all things new? The light that fell through long brown aisles from out the kindling blue, The creak and yawn of stretching boughs, the jay-bird's early call, The rat-tat-tat of woodpecker that waked the woodland hall, The fainter stir of lower life in fern and brake and brier, Till flashing leaped the torch of Day from last night's old camp-fire! Well, well! we'll see it once again; we should be near it now; It's scarce a mile to where the trail strikes off to skirt the slough, And then the dip to Indian Spring, the wooded rise, andâstrange! Yet here should stand the blasted pine that marked our farther range; And hereâwhat's this? A ragged swale of ruts and stumps and mire! Sure this is not the sacred grove that hid the old camp-fire! Yet here 's the âblazeâ I cut myself, and there's the stumbling ledge, With quartz âoutcropâ that lay atop, now leveled to its edge, And mounds of moss-grown stumps beside the woodman's rotting chips, And gashes in the hillside, that gape with dumb red lips. And yet above the shattered wreck and ruin, curling higherâ Ah yes!âstill lifts the smoke that marked the welcome old camp-fire! Perhaps some friend of twenty years still lingers there to raise To weary hearts and tired eyes that beacon of old days. Perhapsâbut stay; 't is gone! and yet once more it lifts as though To meet our tardy blundering steps, and seems to move, and lo! Whirls by us in a rush of sound,âthe vanished funeral pyre Of hopes and fears that twenty years burned in the old camp-fire! For see, beyond the prospect spreads, with chimney, spire, and roof,â Two iron bands across the trail clank to our mustang's hoof; Above them leap two blackened threads from limb-lopped tree to tree, To where the whitewashed station speeds its message to the sea. Rein in! Rein in! The quest is o'er. The goal of our desire Is but the train whose track has lain across the old camp fire! THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE An empty bench, a sky of grayest etching, A bare, bleak shed in blackest silhouette, Twelve years of platform, and before them stretching Twelve miles of prairie glimmering through the wet. North, south, east, west,âthe same dull gray persistence, The tattered vapors of a vanished train, The narrowing rails that meet to pierce the distance, Or break the columns of the far-off rain. Naught but myself; nor form nor figure breaking The long hushed level and stark shining waste; Nothing that moves to fill the vision aching, When the last shadow fled in sullen haste. Nothing beyond. Ah yes! From out the station A stiff, gaunt figure thrown against the sky, Beckoning me with some wooden salutation Caught from his signals as the train flashed by; Yielding me place beside him with dumb gesture Born of that reticence of sky and air. We sit apart, yet wrapped in that one vesture Of silence, sadness, and unspoken care: Each following his own thought,âaround us darkening The rain-washed boundaries and stretching track,â Each following those dim parallels and hearkening For long-lost voices that will not come back. Until, unasked,âI knew not why or wherefore,â He yielded, bit by bit, his dreary past, Like gathered clouds that seemed to thicken there for Some dull down-dropping of their care at last. Long had he lived there. As a boy had started From the stacked corn the Indian's painted face; Heard the wolves' howl the wearying waste that parted His father's hut from the last camping-place. Nature had mocked him: thrice had claimed the reaping, With scythe of fire, of lands she once had sown; Sent the tornado, round his hearthstone heaping Rafters, dead faces that were like his own. Then came the War Time. When its shadow beckoned He had walked dumbly where the flag had led Through swamp and fen,âunknown, unpraised, unreckoned,â To famine, fever, and a prison bed. Till the storm passed, and the slow tide returning Cast him, a wreck, beneath his native sky; Here, at his watch, gave him the chance of earning Scant means to liveâwho won the right to die. All this I heardâor seemed to hearâhalf blending With the low murmur of the coming breeze, The call of some lost bird, and the unending And tireless sobbing of those grassy seas. Until at last the spell of desolation Broke with a trembling star and far-off cry. The coming train! I glanced around the station All was as empty as the upper sky! Naught but myself; nor form nor figure waking The long hushed level and stark shining waste; Naught but myself, that cry, and the dull shaking Of wheel and axle, stopped in breathless haste! âNow, thenâlook sharp! Eh, what? The Station Master? Thar's none! We stopped here of our own accord. The man got killed in that down-train disaster This time last evening. Right there! All aboard!â THE MISSION BELLS OF MONTEREY O bells that rang, O bells that sang Above the martyrs' wilderness, Till from that reddened coast-line sprang The Gospel seed to cheer and bless, What are your garnered sheaves to-day? O Mission bells! Eleison bells! O Mission bells of Monterey! O bells that crash, O bells that clash Above the chimney-crowded plain, On wall and tower your voices dash, But never with the old refrain; In mart and temple gone astray! Ye dangle bells! Ye jangle bells! Ye wrangle bells of Monterey! O bells that die, so far, so nigh, Come back once more across the sea; Not with the zealot's furious cry, Not with the creed's austerity; Come with His love alone to stay, O Mission bells! Eleison bells! O Mission bells of Monterey! Note. This poem was set to music by Monsieur Charles Gounod. âCROTALUSâ (RATTLESNAKE BAR, SIERRAS) No life in earth, or air, or sky; The sunbeams, broken silently, On the bared rocks around me lie,â Cold rocks with half-warmed lichens scarred, And scales of moss; and scarce a yard Away, one long strip, yellow-barred. Lost in a cleft! 'T is but a stride To reach it, thrust its roots aside, And lift it on thy stick astride! Yet stay! That moment is thy grace! For round thee, thrilling air and space, A chattering terror fills the place! A sound as of dry bones that stir In the Dead Valley! By yon fir The locust stops its noonday whir! The wild bird hears; smote with the sound, As if by bullet brought to ground, On broken wing, dips, wheeling round! The hare, transfixed, with trembling lip, Halts, breathless, on pulsating hip, And palsied tread, and heels that slip. Enough, old friend!â't is thou. Forget My heedless foot, nor longer fret The peace with thy grim castanet! I know thee! Yes! Thou mayst forego That lifted crest; the measured blow Beyond which thy pride scorns to go, Or yet retract! For me no spell Lights those slit orbs, where, some think, dwell Machicolated fires of hell! I only know thee humble, bold, Haughty, with miseries untold, And the old Curse that left thee cold, And drove thee ever to the sun, On blistering rocks; nor made thee shun Our cabin's hearth, when day was done, And the spent ashes warmed thee best; We knew thee,âsilent, joyless guest Of our rude ingle. E'en thy quest Of the rare milk-bowl seemed to be Naught but a brother's poverty, And Spartan taste that kept thee free From lust and rapine. Thou! whose fame Searchest the grass with tongue of flame, Making all creatures seem thy game; When the whole woods before thee run, Asked butâwhen all was said and doneâ To lie, untrodden, in the sun! V. PARODIES BEFORE THE CURTAIN Behind the footlights hangs the rusty baize, A trifle shabby in the upturned blaze Of flaring gas and curious eyes that gaze. The stage, methinks, perhaps is none too wide, And hardly fit for royal Richard's stride, Or Falstaff's bulk, or Denmark's youthful pride. Ah, well! no passion walks its humble boards; O'er it no king nor valiant Hector lords: The simplest skill is all its space affords. The song and jest, the dance and trifling play, The local hit at follies of the day, The trick to pass an idle hour away,â For these no trumpets that announce the Moor, No blast that makes the hero's welcome sure,â A single fiddle in the overture! TO THE PLIOCENE SKULL This extraordinary fossil is in the possession of Prof. Josiah D. Whitney, of the State Geological Survey of California. The poem was based on the following paragraph from the daily press of 1866: âA human skull has been found in California, in the pliocene formation. This skull is the remnant not only of the earliest pioneer of this State, but the oldest known human being. ... The skull was found in a shaft 150 feet deep, two miles from Angels in Calaveras County, by a miner named James Watson, who gave it to Mr. Scribner, a merchant, who gave it to Dr. Jones, who sent it to the State Geological Survey. ... The published volume of the State Survey of the Geology of California states that man existed here contemporaneously with the mastodon, but this fossil proves that he was here before the mastodon was known to exist.â (A GEOLOGICAL ADDRESS) âSpeak, O man, less recent! Fragmentary fossil! Primal pioneer of pliocene formation, Hid in lowest drifts below the earliest stratum Of volcanic tufa! âOlder than the beasts, the oldest PalÃ¦otherium; Older than the trees, the oldest Cryptogami; Older than the hills, those infantile eruptions Of earth's epidermis! âEoâMioâPlioâwhatsoe'er the âceneâ was That those vacant sockets filled with awe and wonder,â Whether shores Devonian or Silurian beaches,â Tell us thy strange story! âOr has the professor slightly antedated By some thousand years thy advent on this planet, Giving thee an air that's somewhat better fitted For cold-blooded creatures? âWert thou true spectator of that mighty forest When above thy head the stately Sigillaria Reared its columned trunks in that remote and distant Carboniferous epoch? âTell us of that scene,âthe dim and watery woodland, Songless, silent, hushed, with never bird or insect, Veiled with spreading fronds and screened with tall club mosses, Lycopodiacea,â âWhen beside thee walked the solemn Plesiosaurus, And around thee crept the festive Ichthyosaurus, While from time to time above thee flew and circled Cheerful Pterodactyls. âTell us of thy food,âthose half-marine refections, Crinoids on the shell and Brachipods au naturel,â Cuttlefish to which the pieuvre of Victor Hugo Seems a periwinkle. âSpeak, thou awful vestige of the earth's creation, Solitary fragment of remains organic! Tell the wondrous secret of thy past existence,â Speak! thou oldest primate!â Even as I gazed, a thrill of the maxilla, And a lateral movement of the condyloid process, With post-pliocene sounds of healthy mastication, Ground the teeth together. And from that imperfect dental exhibition, Stained with express juices of the weed nicotian, Came these hollow accents, blent with softer murmurs Of expectoration: Which my name is Bowers, and my crust was busted Falling down a shaft in Calaveras County; But I'd take it kindly if you'd send the pieces Home to old Missouri!â THE BALLAD OF MR. COOKE (A LEGEND OF THE CLIFF HOUSE, SAN FRANCISCO) Where the sturdy ocean breeze Drives the spray of roaring seas, That the Cliff House balconies Overlook: There, in spite of rain that balked, With his sandals duly chalked, Once upon a tight-rope walked Mr. Cooke. But the jester's lightsome mien, And his spangles and his sheen, All had vanished when the scene He forsook. Yet in some delusive hope, In some vague desire to cope, One still came to view the rope Walked by Cooke. Amid Beauty's bright array, On that strange eventful day, Partly hidden from the spray, In a nook, Stood Florinda Vere de Vere; Who, with wind-disheveled hair, And a rapt, distracted air, Gazed on Cooke. Then she turned, and quickly cried To her lover at her side, While her form with love and pride Wildly shook: âClifford Snook! oh, hear me now! Here I break each plighted vow; There's but one to whom I bow, And that's Cooke!â Haughtily that young man spoke: âI descend from noble folk; âSeven Oaks,â and then âSe'nnoak,â Lastly âSnook,â Is the way my name I trace. Shall a youth of noble race In affairs of love give place To a Cooke?â âClifford Snook, I know thy claim To that lineage and name, And I think I've read the same In Horne Tooke; But I swear, by all divine, Never, never, to be thine, Till thou canst upon yon line Walk like Cooke.â Though to that gymnastic feat He no closer might compete Than to strike a balance-sheet In a book; Yet thenceforward from that day He his figure would display In some wild athletic way, After Cooke. On some household eminence, On a clothes-line or a fence, Over ditches, drains, and thence O'er a brook, He, by high ambition led, Ever walked and balancÃ¨d, Till the people, wondering, said, âHow like Cooke!â Step by step did he proceed, Nerved by valor, not by greed, And at last the crowning deed Undertook. Misty was the midnight air, And the cliff was bleak and bare, When he came to do and dare, Just like Cooke. Through the darkness, o'er the flow, Stretched the line where he should go, Straight across as flies the crow Or the rook. One wild glance around he cast; Then he faced the ocean blast, And he strode the cable last Touched by Cooke. Vainly roared the angry seas, Vainly blew the ocean breeze; But, alas! the walker's knees Had a crook; And before he reached the rock Did they both together knock, And he stumbled with a shockâ Unlike Cooke! Downward dropping in the dark, Like an arrow to its mark, Or a fish-pole when a shark Bites the hook, Dropped the pole he could not save, Dropped the walker, and the wave Swift engulfed the rival brave Of J. Cooke! Came a roar across the sea Of sea-lions in their glee, In a tongue remarkably Like Chinook; And the maddened sea-gull seemed Still to utter, as he screamed, âPerish thus the wretch who deemed Himself Cooke!â But on misty moonlit nights Comes a skeleton in tights, Walks once more the giddy heights He mistook; And unseen to mortal eyes, Purged of grosser earthly ties, Now at last in spirit guise Outdoes Cooke. Still the sturdy ocean breeze Sweeps the spray of roaring seas, Where the Cliff House balconies Overlook; And the maidens in their prime, Reading of this mournful rhyme, Weep where, in the olden time, Walked J. Cooke. THE BALLAD OF THE EMEU Oh, say, have you seen at the Willows so greenâ So charming and rurally trueâ A singular bird, with a manner absurd, Which they call the Australian Emeu? Have you Ever seen this Australian Emeu? It trots all around with its head on the ground, Or erects it quite out of your view; And the ladies all cry, when its figure they spy, âOh! what a sweet pretty Emeu! Oh! do Just look at that lovely Emeu!â One day to this spot, when the weather was hot, Came Matilda Hortense Fortescue; And beside her there came a youth of high name,â Augustus Florell Montague: The two Both loved that wild, foreign Emeu. With two loaves of bread then they fed it, instead Of the flesh of the white Cockatoo, Which once was its food in that wild neighborhood Where ranges the sweet Kangaroo, That too Is game for the famous Emeu! Old saws and gimlets but its appetite whets. Like the world-famous bark of Peru; There's nothing so hard that the bird will discard, And nothing its taste will eschew That you Can give that long-legged Emeu! The time slipped away in this innocent play, When up jumped the bold Montague: âWhere's that specimen pin that I gayly did win In raffle, and gave unto you, Fortescue?â No word spoke the guilty Emeu! âQuick! tell me his name whom thou gavest that same, Ere these hands in thy blood I imbrue!â âNay, dearest,â she cried, as she clung to his side, âI'm innocent as that Emeu!â âAdieu!â He replied, âMiss M. H. Fortescue!â Down she dropped at his feet, all as white as a sheet, As wildly he fled from her view; He thought 't was her sin,âfor he knew not the pin Had been gobbled up by the Emeu; All through The voracity of that Emeu! MRS. JUDGE JENKINS (BEING THE ONLY GENUINE SEQUEL TO âMAUD MULLERâ) Maud Muller all that summer day Raked the meadow sweet with hay; Yet, looking down the distant lane, She hoped the Judge would come again. But when he came, with smile and bow, Maud only blushed, and stammered, âHa-ow?â And spoke of her âpa,â and wondered whether He'd give consent they should wed together. Old Muller burst in tears, and then Begged that the Judge would lend him âten;â For trade was dull, and wages low, And the âcraps,â this year, were somewhat slow. And ere the languid summer died, Sweet Maud became the Judge's bride. But on the day that they were mated, Maud's brother Bob was intoxicated; And Maud's relations, twelve in all, Were very drunk at the Judge's hall And when the summer came again, The young bride bore him babies twain; And the Judge was blest, but thought it strange That bearing children made such a change; For Maud grew broad and red and stout, And the waist that his arm once clasped about Was more than he now could span; and he Sighed as he pondered, ruefully, How that which in Maud was native grace In Mrs. Jenkins was out of place; And thought of the twins, and wished that they Looked less like the men who raked the hay On Muller's farm, and dreamed with pain Of the day he wandered down the lane. And looking down that dreary track, He half regretted that he came back; For, had he waited, he might have wed Some maiden fair and thoroughbred; For there be women fair as she, Whose verbs and nouns do more agree. Alas for maiden! alas for judge! And the sentimental,âthat's one-half âfudge;â For Maud soon thought the Judge a bore, With all his learning and all his lore; And the Judge would have bartered Maud's fair face For more refinement and social grace. If, of all words of tongue and pen, The saddest are, âIt might have been,â More sad are these we daily see: âIt is, but had n't ought to be.â A GEOLOGICAL MADRIGAL I have found out a gift for my fair; I know where the fossils abound, Where the footprints of Aves declare The birds that once walked on the ground. Oh, come, andâin technical speechâ We'll walk this Devonian shore, Or on some Silurian beach We'll wander, my love, evermore. I will show thee the sinuous track By the slow-moving Annelid made, Or the Trilobite that, farther back, In the old Potsdam sandstone was laid; Thou shalt see, in his Jurassic tomb, The Plesiosaurus embalmed; In his Oolitic prime and his bloom, Iguanodon safe and unharmed. You wishedâI remember it well, And I loved you the more for that wishâ For a perfect cystedian shell And a whole holocephalic fish. And oh, if Earth's strata contains In its lowest Silurian drift, Or palÃ¦ozoic remains The same, 't is your lover's free gift! Then come, love, and never say nay, But calm all your maidenly fears; We'll note, love, in one summer's day The record of millions of years; And though the Darwinian plan Your sensitive feelings may shock, We'll find the beginning of man, Our fossil ancestors, in rock! AVITOR (AN AERIAL RETROSPECT) What was it filled my youthful dreams, In place of Greek or Latin themes, Or beauty's wild, bewildering beams? Avitor! What visions and celestial scenes I filled with aerial machines, Montgolfier's and Mr. Green's! Avitor! What fairy tales seemed things of course! The roc that brought Sindbad across, The Calendar's own wingÃ¨d horse! Avitor! How many things I took for facts,â Icarus and his conduct lax, And how he sealed his fate with wax! Avitor! The first balloons I sought to sail, Soap-bubbles fair, but all too frail, Or kites,âbut thereby hangs a tail. Avitor! What made me launch from attic tall A kitten and a parasol, And watch their bitter, frightful fall? Avitor! What youthful dreams of high renown Bade me inflate the parson's gown, That went not up, nor yet came down? Avitor! My first ascent I may not tell; Enough to know that in that well My first high aspirations fell. Avitor! My other failures let me pass: The dire explosions, and, alas! The friends I choked with noxious gas. Avitor! For lo! I see perfected rise The vision of my boyish eyes, The messenger of upper skies. Avitor! THE WILLOWS (AFTER EDGAR ALLAN POE) The skies they were ashen and sober, The streets they were dirty and drear; It was night in the month of October, Of my most immemorial year. Like the skies, I was perfectly sober, As I stopped at the mansion of Shear,â At the Nightingale,âperfectly sober, And the willowy woodland down here. Here, once in an alley Titanic Of Ten-pins, I roamed with my soul,â Of Ten-pins, with Mary, my soul; They were days when my heart was volcanic, And impelled me to frequently roll, And made me resistlessly roll, Till my ten-strikes created a panic In the realms of the Boreal pole,â Till my ten-strikes created a panic With the monkey atop of his pole. I repeat, I was perfectly sober, But my thoughts they were palsied and sear,â My thoughts were decidedly queer; For I knew not the month was October, And I marked not the night of the year; I forgot that sweet morceau of Auber That the band oft performÃ¨d down here, And I mixed the sweet music of Auber With the Nightingale's music by Shear. And now as the night was senescent, And star-dials pointed to morn, And car-drivers hinted of morn, At the end of the path a liquescent And bibulous lustre was born; 'T was made by the bar-keeper present, Who mixÃ¨d a duplicate horn,â His two hands describing a crescent Distinct with a duplicate horn. And I said: âThis looks perfectly regal, For it's warm, and I know I feel dry,â I am confident that I feel dry. We have come past the emeu and eagle, And watched the gay monkey on high; Let us drink to the emeu and eagle, To the swan and the monkey on high,â To the eagle and monkey on high; For this bar-keeper will not inveigle, Bully boy with the vitreous eye,â He surely would never inveigle, Sweet youth with the crystalline eye.â But Mary, uplifting her finger, Said: âSadly this bar I mistrust,â I fear that this bar does not trust. Oh, hasten! oh, let us not linger! Oh, fly,âlet us fly,âere we must!â In terror she cried, letting sink her Parasol till it trailed in the dust; In agony sobbed, letting sink her Parasol till it trailed in the dust,â Till it sorrowfully trailed in the dust. Then I pacified Mary and kissed her, And tempted her into the room, And conquered her scruples and gloom; And we passed to the end of the vista, But were stopped by the warning of doom,â By some words that were warning of doom. And I said, âWhat is written, sweet sister, At the opposite end of the room?â She sobbed, as she answered, âAll liquors Must be paid for ere leaving the room.â Then my heart it grew ashen and sober, As the streets were deserted and drear, For my pockets were empty and drear; And I cried: âIt was surely October, On this very night of last year, That I journeyed, I journeyed down here,â That I brought a fair maiden down here, On this night of all nights in the year? Ah! to me that inscription is clear; Well I know now, I'm perfectly sober, Why no longer they credit me here,â Well I know now that music of Auber, And this Nightingale, kept by one Shear.â NORTH BEACH (AFTER SPENSER) Lo! where the castle of bold Pfeiffer throws Its sullen shadow on the rolling tide,â No more the home where joy and wealth repose, But now where wassailers in cells abide; See yon long quay that stretches far and wide, Well known to citizens as wharf of Meiggs: There each sweet Sabbath walks in maiden pride The pensive Margaret, and brave Pat, whose legs Encased in broadcloth oft keep time with Peg's. Here cometh oft the tender nursery-maid, While in her ear her love his tale doth pour; Meantime her infant doth her charge evade, And rambleth sagely on the sandy shore, Till the sly sea-crab, low in ambush laid, Seizeth his leg and biteth him full sore. Ah me! what sounds the shuddering echoes bore When his small treble mixed with Ocean's roar! Hard by there stands an ancient hostelrie, And at its side a garden, where the bear, The stealthy catamount, and coon agree To work deceit on all who gather there; And when Augustaâthat unconscious fairâ With nuts and apples plieth Bruin free, Lo! the green parrot claweth her back hair, And the gray monkey grabbeth fruits that she On her gay bonnet wears, and laugheth loud in glee! THE LOST TAILS OF MILETUS High on the Thracian hills, half hid in the billows of clover, Thyme, and the asphodel blooms, and lulled by Pactolian streamlet, She of Miletus lay, and beside her an aged satyr Scratched his ear with his hoof, and playfully mumbled his chestnuts. Vainly the MÃ¦nid and the Bassarid gamboled about her, The free-eyed Bacchante sang, and Panâthe renowned, the accomplishedâ Executed his difficult solo. In vain were their gambols and dances; High o'er the Thracian hills rose the voice of the shepherdess, wailing: âAi! for the fleecy flocks, the meek-nosed, the passionless faces: Ai! for the tallow-scented, the straight-tailed, the high-stepping; Ai! for the timid glance, which is that which the rustic, sagacious, Applies to him who loves but may not declare his passion!â Her then Zeus answered slow: âO daughter of song and sorrow, Hapless tender of sheep, arise from thy long lamentation! Since thou canst not trust fate, nor behave as becomes a Greek maiden, Look and behold thy sheep.â And lo! they returned to her tailless! THE RITUALIST (BY A COMMUNICANT OF âST. JAMES'Sâ) He wore, I think, a chasuble, the day when first we met; A stole and snowy alb likewise,âI recollect it yet. He called me âdaughter,â as he raised his jeweled hand to bless; And then, in thrilling undertones, he asked, âWould I confess?â O mother dear! blame not your child, if then on bended knees I dropped, and thought of Abelard, and also Eloise, Or when, beside the altar high, he bowed before the pyx, I envied that seraphic kiss he gave the crucifix. The cruel world may think it wrong, perhaps may deem me weak, And, speaking of that sainted man, may call his conduct âcheek;â And, like that wicked barrister whom Cousin Harry quotes, May term his mixÃ¨d chalice âgrog,â his vestments âpetticoats;â But, whatsoe'er they do or say, I'll build a Christian's hope On incense and on altar-lights, on chasuble and cope. Let others prove, by precedent, the faith that they profess: âHis can't be wrongâ that's symbolized by such becoming dress. A MORAL VINDICATOR If Mr. Jones, Lycurgus B., Had one peculiar quality, 'T was his severe advocacy Of conjugal fidelity. His views of heaven were very free: His views of life were painfully Ridiculous; but fervently He dwelt on marriage sanctity. He frequently went on a spree; But in his wildest revelry, On this especial subject he Betrayed no ambiguity. And though at times Lycurgus B. Did lay his hands not lovingly Upon his wife, the sanctity Of wedlock was his guaranty. But Mrs. Jones declined to see Affairs in the same light as he, And quietly got a decree Divorcing her from that L. B. And what did Jones, Lycurgus B., With his known idiosyncrasy? He smiled,âa bitter smile to see,â And drew the weapon of Bowie. He did what Sickles did to Key,â What Cole on Hiscock wrought, did he; In fact, on persons twenty-three He proved the marriage sanctity. The counselor who took the fee, The witnesses and referee, The judge who granted the decree, Died in that wholesale butchery. And then when Jones, Lycurgus B., Had wiped the weapon of Bowie, Twelve jurymen did instantly Acquit and set Lycurgus free. CALIFORNIA MADRIGAL (ON THE APPROACH OF SPRING) Oh, come, my beloved, from thy winter abode, From thy home on the Yuba, thy ranch overflowed; For the waters have fallen, the winter has fled, And the river once more has returned to its bed. Oh, mark how the spring in its beauty is near! How the fences and tules once more reappear! How soft lies the mud on the banks of yon slough By the hole in the levee the waters broke through! All nature, dear Chloris, is blooming to greet The glance of your eye and the tread of your feet; For the trails are all open, the roads are all free, And the highwayman's whistle is heard on the lea. Again swings the lash on the high mountain trail, And the pipe of the packer is scenting the gale; The oath and the jest ringing high o'er the plain, Where the smut is not always confined to the grain. Once more glares the sunlight on awning and roof, Once more the red clay's pulverized by the hoof, Once more the dust powders the âoutsidesâ with red, Once more at the station the whiskey is spread. Then fly with me, love, ere the summer's begun, And the mercury mounts to one hundred and one; Ere the grass now so green shall be withered and sear, In the spring that obtains but one month in the year. WHAT THE ENGINES SAID (OPENING OF THE PACIFIC RAILROAD) What was it the Engines said, Pilots touching,âhead to head Facing on the single track, Half a world behind each back? This is what the Engines said, Unreported and unread. With a prefatory screech, In a florid Western speech, Said the Engine from the West: âI am from Sierra's crest; And if altitude's a test, Why, I reckon, it's confessed That I've done my level best.â Said the Engine from the East: âThey who work best talk the least. S'pose you whistle down your brakes, What you've done is no great shakes,â Pretty fair,âbut let our meeting Be a different kind of greeting. Let these folks with champagne stuffing, Not their Engines, do the puffing. âListen! Where Atlantic beats Shores of snow and summer heats; Where the Indian autumn skies Paint the woods with wampum dyes,â I have chased the flying sun, Seeing all he looked upon, Blessing all that he has blessed, Nursing in my iron breast All his vivifying heat, All his clouds about my crest; And before my flying feet Every shadow must retreat.â Said the Western Engine, âPhew!â And a long, low whistle blew. âCome, now, really that's the oddest Talk for one so very modest. You brag of your East! You do? Why, I bring the East to you! All the Orient, all Cathay, Find through me the shortest way; And the sun you follow here Rises in my hemisphere. Really,âif one must be rude,â Length, my friend, ain't longitude.â Said the Union: âDon't reflect, or I'll run over some Director.â Said the Central: âI'm Pacific; But, when riled, I'm quite terrific. Yet to-day we shall not quarrel, Just to show these folks this moral, How two Enginesâin their visionâ Once have met without collision.â That is what the Engines said, Unreported and unread; Spoken slightly through the nose, With a whistle at the close. THE LEGENDS OF THE RHINE Beetling walls with ivy grown, Frowning heights of mossy stone; Turret, with its flaunting flag Flung from battlemented crag; Dungeon-keep and fortalice Looking down a precipice O'er the darkly glancing wave By the Lurline-haunted cave; Robber haunt and maiden bower, Home of Love and Crime and Power,â That's the scenery, in fine, Of the Legends of the Rhine. One bold baron, double-dyed Bigamist and parricide, And, as most the stories run, Partner of the Evil One; Injured innocence in white, Fair but idiotic quite, Wringing of her lily hands; Valor fresh from Paynim lands, Abbot ruddy, hermit pale, Minstrel fraught with many a tale,â Are the actors that combine In the Legends of the Rhine. Bell-mouthed flagons round a board; Suits of armor, shield, and sword; Kerchief with its bloody stain; Ghosts of the untimely slain; Thunder-clap and clanking chain; Headsman's block and shining axe; Thumb-screw, crucifixes, racks; Midnight-tolling chapel bell, Heard across the gloomy fell,â These and other pleasant facts Are the properties that shine In the Legends of the Rhine. Maledictions, whispered vows Underneath the linden boughs; Murder, bigamy, and theft; Travelers of goods bereft; Rapine, pillage, arson, spoil,â Everything but honest toil, Are the deeds that best define Every Legend of the Rhine. That Virtue always meets reward, But quicker when it wears a sword; That Providence has special care Of gallant knight and lady fair; That villains, as a thing of course, Are always haunted by remorse,â Is the moral, I opine, Of the Legends of the Rhine. SONGS WITHOUT SENSE FOR THE PARLOR AND PIANO I. THE PERSONIFIED SENTIMENTAL Affection's charm no longer gilds The idol of the shrine; But cold Oblivion seeks to fill Regret's ambrosial wine. Though Friendship's offering buried lies 'Neath cold Aversion's snow, Regard and Faith will ever bloom Perpetually below. I see thee whirl in marble halls, In Pleasure's giddy train; Remorse is never on that brow, Nor Sorrow's mark of pain. Deceit has marked thee for her own: Inconstancy the same; And Ruin wildly sheds its gleam Athwart thy path of shame. II. THE HOMELY PATHETIC The dews are heavy on my brow; My breath comes hard and low; Yet, mother dear, grant one request, Before your boy must go. Oh! lift me ere my spirit sinks, And ere my senses fail, Place me once more, O mother dear. Astride the old fence-rail. The old fence-rail, the old fence-rail! How oft these youthful legs, With Alice' and Ben Bolt's, were hung Across those wooden pegs! 'T was there the nauseating smoke Of my first pipe arose: O mother dear, these agonies Are far less keen than those. I know where lies the hazel dell, Where simple Nellie sleeps; I know the cot of Nettie Moore, And where the willow weeps. I know the brookside and the mill, But all their pathos fails Beside the days when once I sat Astride the old fence-rails. III. SWISS AIR I'm a gay tra, la, la, With my fal, lal, la, la, And my brightâ And my lightâ Tra, la, le. [Repeat.] Then laugh, ha, ha, ha, And ring, ting, ling, ling, And sing fal, la, la, La, la, le. [Repeat.] VI. LITTLE POSTERITY MASTER JOHNNY'S NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR It was spring the first time that I saw her, for her papa and mamma moved in Next door, just as skating was over, and marbles about to begin; For the fence in our back yard was broken, and I saw, as I peeped through the slat, There were âJohnny-jump-upsâ all around her, and I knew it was spring just by that. I never knew whether she saw me, for she did n't say nothing to me, But âMa! here's a slat in the fence broke, and the boy that is next door can see.â But the next day I climbed on our wood-shed, as you know Mamma says I've a right, And she calls out, âWell, peekin' is manners!â and I answered her, âSass is perlite!â But I was n't a bit mad, no, Papa, and to prove it, the very next day, When she ran past our fence in the morning I happened to get in her way,â For you know I am âchunkÃ¨dâ and clumsy, as she says are all boys of my size,â And she nearly upset me, she did, Pa, and laughed till tears came in her eyes. And then we were friends from that moment, for I knew that she told Kitty Sage,â And she was n't a girl that would flatterââthat she thought I was tall for my age.â And I gave her four apples that evening, and took her to ride on my sled, AndââWhat am I telling you this for?â Why, Papa, my neighbor is dead! You don't hear one half I am saying,âI really do think it's too bad! Why, you might have seen crape on her door-knob, and noticed to-day I've been sad. And they've got her a coffin of rosewood, and they say they have dressed her in white, And I've never once looked through the fence, Pa, since she diedâat eleven last night. And Ma says it's decent and proper, as I was her neighbor and friend, That I should go there to the funeral, and she thinks that you ought to attend; But I am so clumsy and awkward, I know I shall be in the way, And suppose they should speak to me, Papa, I would n't know just what to say. So I think I will get up quite early,âI know I sleep late, but I know I'll be sure to wake up if our Bridget pulls the string that I'll tie to my toe; And I'll crawl through the fence, and I'll gather the âJohnny-jump-upsâ as they grew Round her feet the first day that I saw her, and, Papa, I'll give them to you. For you're a big man, and, you know, Pa, can come and go just where you choose, And you'll take the flowers in to her, and surely they'll never refuse; But, Papa, don't say they're from Johnny; they won't understand, don't you see? But just lay them down on her bosom, and, Papa, she'll know they're from Me. MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST My Papa knows you, and he says you're a man who makes reading for books; But I never read nothing you wrote, nor did Papa,âI know by his looks. So I guess you're like me when I talk, and I talk, and I talk all the day, And they only say, âDo stop that child!â or, âNurse, take Miss Edith away.â But Papa said if I was good I could ask youâalone by myselfâ If you would n't write me a book like that little one up on the shelf. I don't mean the pictures, of course, for to make them you've got to be smart; But the reading that runs all around them, you know,âjust the easiest part. You need n't mind what it's about, for no one will see it but me, And Jane,âthat's my nurse,âand John,âhe's the coachman,âjust only us three. You're to write of a bad little girl, that was wicked and bold and all that; And then you're to write, if you please, something goodâvery goodâof a cat! This cat, she was virtuous and meek, and kind to her parents, and mild, And careful and neat in her ways, though her mistress was such a bad child; And hours she would sit and would gaze when her mistressâthat's meâwas so bad, And blink, just as if she would say, âOh, Edith! you make my heart sad.â And yet, you would scarcely believe it, that beautiful, angelic cat Was blamed by the servants for stealing whatever, they said, she'd get at. And when John drank my milk,âdon't you tell me! I know just the way it was done,â They said 't was the cat,âand she sitting and washing her face in the sun! And then there was Dick, my canary. When I left its cage open one day, They all made believe that she ate it, though I know that the bird flew away. And why? Just because she was playing with a feather she found on the floor. As if cats could n't play with a feather without people thinking 't was more! Why, once we were romping together, when I knocked down a vase from the shelf, That cat was as grieved and distressed as if she had done it herself; And she walked away sadly and hid herself, and never came out until tea,â So they say, for they sent me to bed, and she never came even to me. No matter whatever happened, it was laid at the door of that cat. Why, once when I tore my apron,âshe was wrapped in it, and I called âRat!ââ Why, they blamed that on her. I shall neverâno, not to my dying dayâ Forget the pained look that she gave me when they slapped me and took me away. Of course, you know just what comes next, when a child is as lovely as that: She wasted quite slowly away; it was goodness was killing that cat. I know it was nothing she ate, for her taste was exceedingly nice; But they said she stole Bobby's ice cream, and caught a bad cold from the ice. And you'll promise to make me a book like that little one up on the shelf, And you'll call her âNaomi,â because it's a name that she just gave herself; For she'd scratch at my door in the morning, and whenever I'd call out, âWho's there?â She would answer, âNaomi! Naomi!â like a Christian, I vow and declare. And you'll put me and her in a book. And mind, you're to say I was bad; And I might have been badder than that but for the example I had. And you'll say that she was a Maltese, andâwhat's that you asked? âIs she dead?â Why, please, sir, there ain't any cat! You're to make one up out of your head! MISS EDITH MAKES IT PLEASANT FOR BROTHER JACK âCrying!â Of course I am crying, and I guess you would be crying, too, If people were telling such stories as they tell about me, about you. Oh yes, you can laugh if you want to, and smoke as you did n't care how, And get your brains softened like uncle's. Dr. Jones says you're gettin' it now. Why don't you say âStop!â to Miss Ilsey? She cries twice as much as I do, And she's older and cries just from meanness,âfor a ribbon or anything new. Ma says it's her âsensitive nature.â Oh my! No, I sha'n't stop my talk! And I don't want no apples nor candy, and I don't want to go take a walk! I know why you're mad! Yes, I do, now! You think that Miss Ilsey likes you, And I've heard her repeatedly call you the bold-facest boy that she knew; And she'd âlike to know where you learnt manners.â Oh yes! Kick the table,âthat's right! Spill the ink on my dress, and go then round telling Ma that I look like a fright! What stories? Pretend you don't know that they're saying I broke off the match 'Twixt old Money-grubber and Mary, by saying she called him âCrosspatch,â When the only allusion I made him about sister Mary was, she Cared more for his cash than his temper, and you know, Jack, you said that to me. And it's true! But it's me, and I'm scolded, and Pa says if I keep on I might By and by get my name in the papers! Who cares? Why, 't was only last night I was reading how Pa and the sheriff were selling some lots, and it's plain If it's awful to be in the papers, why, Papa would go and complain. You think it ain't true about Ilsey? Well, I guess I know girls, and I say There's nothing I see about Ilsey to show she likes you, anyway! I know what it means when a girl who has called her cat after one boy Goes and changes its name to another's. And she's done itâand I wish you joy! MISS EDITH MAKES ANOTHER FRIEND Oh, you're the girl lives on the corner? Come inâif you want toâcome quick! There's no one but me in the house, and the cookâbut she's only a stick. Don't try the front way, but come over the fenceâthrough the windowâthat's how. Don't mind the big dogâhe won't bite youâjust see him obey me! there, now! What's your name? Mary Ellen? How funny! Mine's Edithâit's nicer, you see; But yours does for you, for you're plainer, though maybe you're gooder than me; For Jack says I'm sometimes a devil, but Jack, of all folks, need n't talk, For I don't call the seamstress an angel till Ma says the poor thing must âwalk.â Come in! It's quite dark in the parlor, for sister will keep the blinds down, For you know her complexion is sallow like yours, but she is n't as brown; Though Jack says that is n't the reason she likes to sit here with Jim Moore. Do you think that he meant that she kissed him? Would youâif your lips was n't sore? If you like, you can try our piano. 'T ain't ours. A man left it here To rent by the month, although Ma says he has n't been paid for a year. Sister playsâoh, such fine variations!âwhy, I once heard a gentleman say That she did n't mind that for the musicâin fact, it was just in her way! Ain't I funny? And yet it's the queerest of all that, whatever I say, One half of the folks die a-laughing, and the rest, they all look t'other way. And some say, âThat child!â Do they ever say that to such people as you? Though maybe you 're naturally silly, and that makes your eyes so askew. Now stopâdon't you dare to be crying! Just as sure as you live, if you do, I'll call in my big dog to bite you, and I'll make my Papa kill you, too! And then where'll you be? So play pretty. There's my doll, and a nice piece of cake. You don't want itâyou think it is poison! Then I'll eat it, dear, just for your sake! WHAT MISS EDITH SAW FROM HER WINDOW Our window's not much, though it fronts on the street; There's a fly in the pane that gets nothin' to eat; But it's curious how people think it's a treat For me to look out of the window! Why, when company comes, and they're all speaking low, With their chairs drawn together, then some one says, âOh! Edith dear!âthat's a good childânow run, love, and go And amuse yourself there at the window!â Or Bobâthat's my brotherâcomes in with his chum, And they whisper and chuckle, the same words will come. And it's âEdith, look here! Oh, I say! what a rum Lot of things you can see from that window!â And yet, as I told you, there's only that fly Buzzing round in the pane, and a bit of blue sky, And the girl in the opposite window, that I Look at when she looks from her window. And yet, I've been thinking I'd so like to see If what goes on behind her, goes on behind me! And then, goodness gracious! what fun it would be For us both as we sit by our window! How we'd know when the parcels were hid in a drawer, Or things taken out that one never sees more; What people come in and go out of the door, That we never see from the window! And that night when the stranger came home with our Jane I might see what I heard then, that sounded so plainâ Like when my wet fingers I rub on the pane (Which they won't let me do on my window). And I'd know why papa shut the door with a slam, And said something funny that sounded like âjam,â And then âEdithâwhere are you?â I said, âHere I am.â âAh, that's right, dear, look out of the window!â They say when I'm grown up these things will appear More plain than they do when I look at them here, But I think I see some things uncommonly clear, As I sit and look down from the window. What things? Oh, the things that I make up, you know, Out of stories I've readâand they all pass below. Ali Baba, the Forty Thieves, all in a row, Go by, as I look from my window. That's only at church time; other days there's no crowd. Don't laugh! See that big man who looked up and bowed? That's our butcherâI call him the Sultan Mahoud When he nods to me here at the window! And that manâhe's our neighborâjust gone for a ride Has three wives in the churchyard that lie side by side. So I call him âBluebeardâ in search of his bride, While I'm Sister Anne at the window. And what do I call you? Well, here's what I do: When my sister expects you, she puts me here, too; But I wait till you enter, to see if it's you, And thenâI just open the window! âDear child!â Yes, that's me! Oh, you ask what that's for? Well, Papa says you're âPoverty's self,â and what's more, I open the window, when you're at the door, To see Love fly out of the window!â ON THE LANDING (AN IDYL OF THE BALUSTERS) Bobby, Ã¦tat. 3Â½. Johnny, Ã¦tat. 4Â½. BOBBY Do you know why they've put us in that back room, Up in the attic, close against the sky, And made believe our nursery's a cloak-room? Do you know why? JOHNNY No more I don't, nor why that Sammy's mother, What Ma thinks horrid, 'cause he bunged my eye, Eats an ice cream, down there, like any other! No more don't I! BOBBY Do you know why Nurse says it is n't manners For you and me to ask folks twice for pie, And no one hits that man with two bananas? Do you know why? JOHNNY No more I don't, nor why that girl, whose dress is Off of her shoulders, don't catch cold and die, When you and me gets croup when we undresses! No more don't I! BOBBY Perhaps she ain't as good as you and I is, And God don't want her up there in the sky, And lets her liveâto come in just when pie isâ Perhaps that's why! JOHNNY Do you know why that man that's got a cropped head Rubbed it just now as if he felt a fly? Could it be, Bobby, something that I dropded? And is that why? BOBBY Good boys behaves, and so they don't get scolded. Nor drop hot milk on folks as they pass by. JOHNNY (piously) Marbles would bounce on Mr. Jones' bald headâ But I sha'n't try! BOBBY Do you know why Aunt Jane is always snarling At you and me because we tells a lie, And she don't slap that man that called her darling? Do you know why? JOHNNY No more I don't, nor why that man with Mamma Just kissed her hand. BOBBY She hurt itâand that's why: He made it well, the very way that Mamma Does do to I. JOHNNY I feel so sleepy. ... Was that Papa kissed us? What made him sigh, and look up to the sky? BOBBY We were n't downstairs, and he and God had missed us, And that was why!</field>

In ways he trod, and treads no more, His footprints linger still, Alike on England's mother-shore, The New World's sunset hill. But ah! the scenes the Boy first saw, The sea Balboa named, The bay which stout old PortolÃ¡ For sweet St. Francis claimed, The great Sierras piercing blue Of sky with snowy crest, He knew and loved them best: they knew, They know, and love him best. They speak of him, the forest trees, Redwood, madroÃ±o, pine,â The Mission Bells,âall these, and these His memory's sacred shrine. Ina Coolbrith. Russian Hill, San Francisco, May, 1913. EARLY POEMS (1857-1865) THE VALENTINE 'T was St. Valentine's day, and he mused in his chair, His feet on the fenderâbut his heart was not there; Thoughts of sweet Angelina, of all girls the best, Fill'd his mind's waking dreams, and a sigh fill'd his breast. What sound breaks the silence?âthe doorbell's loud jingleâ The blood leaves his heart, his cheeks also tingle. He rushed through the doorway, he jumps down the stair, He opens the door, and the postman is there. His ways are not pleasantâhis words are but few; âMr. Jones?â âSo I am!â âHere's a letter for you.â He seized the loved missive, and straightway he fled, With his lips all the way pressed to Washington's head. âOh, my fond Angelina!âdear girl!â thus he cried; â'T is from thee, my own darling, and maybeâmy bride. âBashful girl! did'st thou think thy sweet hand to disguise That no sign might reveal, and thy lover surprise? âBut loveâfancy painterâmore signs doth espy Than the casual observer would idly pass by.â Thus spake he, then tore off the envious seal, And impatiently read. What its contents reveal? âDear Sir:âThe amount that stands charged to your name, You'd oblige us by calling and settling the same!â LINES WRITTEN IN A PRAYER-BOOK The last long knell of the tolling bell Dies out of the belfry's pile, And the rustling skirt and the crinoline's swell Is gone from the echoing aisle, And on saint and on sinner a silence fell, Unbroken by whisper or smile. I cannot pray, for my thoughts still stray From my book, though I seem to con it; She's not over there 'midst beauty's array, For I know the style of her bonnet, Just from Madame Chassez's, with its trimming so gay; And the loveliest roses upon it. She comes! âShe is like to the merchant ships,â For she bringeth her silks âfrom afarâ; She comes! She is here! and my heart's at my lips, And my nerves, how they tremble and jar! For the flounces that catch in the pews and the slips, Her way to salvation doth bar. Oh, let not your judgment, ye saints, be severe, Impute not the fault to her pride, For when angels awhile on the earth reappear, Their limits are not circumscribed; And when woman extendeth the bounds of her sphere, Her influence can't be too wide! LOVE AND PHYSIC A clever man was Dr. Digg; Misfortunes well he bore; He never lost his patience till He had no patients more; And though his practice once was large, It did not swell his gains; The pains he labored for were but The labor for his pains. The âart is long,â his cash got short, And well might Galen dread it, For who will trust a name unknown When merit gets no credit? To marry seemed the only way To ease his mind of trouble; Misfortunes never singly come, And misery made him double. He had a patient, rich and fair, That hearts by scores was breaking, And as he once had felt her wrist, He thought her hand of taking; But what the law makes strangers do, Did strike his comprehension; Who live in these United States, Do first declare intention. And so he called. His beating heart With anxious fears was swelling, And half in habit took her hand And on her tongue was dwelling; But thrice tho' he essayed to speak, He stopp'd, and stuck, and blundered; For say, what mortal could be cool Whose pulse was most a hundred? âMadam,â at last he faltered out,â His love had grown courageous,â âI have discerned a new complaint, I hope to prove contagious; And when the symptoms I relate, And show its diagnosis, Ah, let me hope from those dear lips, Some favorable prognosis. âThis done,â he cries, âlet's tie those ties Which none but death can sever; Since âlike cures like,â I do infer That love cures love, forever.â He pausedâshe blushed; however strange It seems on first perusal, Altho' there was no promise made, She gave him a refusal. Says she, âIf well I understand The sentiments you 're saying, You do propose to take a handâ A game that two are playingâ At whist; one's partner ought to be As silent as a mummy, But in the game of love, I think, I shall not take a dummy. âI cannot marry one who lives By other folks' distresses; The man I marry, I must love, Nor fear his fond caresses; For who, whatever be their sex, However strange the case is, Would like to have a doctor's bill Stuck up into their faces?â Perhaps you think, 'twixt love and rage, He took some deadly potion, Or with his lancet breathed a vein To ease his pulse's motion. To guess the vent of his despair, The wisest one might miss it; He reached his officeâthen and there He charged her for the visit! THE FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH (After Longfellow) Staring sunlight on the lawn, Chequered shadows in the wood; Summer's odors, idly borne, Linger by the trickling flood. Lingering, waiting, long delayed, Till the pure and limpid pool Mirrors, with night's coming shade, Childhood tripping home from school. Tripping down the well-worn track, Zephyrs greet the coming girl, Press the little bonnet back, Nestle in the dewy curl. Robins twittering thro' the leaves, Chirping wren and chattering jay Carol 'neath the verdant eaves; Carols she as sweet as they. Satchel swinging on her arm, On her cheek health's glowing flush, Stands, in all of girlhood's charms, Youth beside the alder-bush. Summers nine had o'er her fled, Left their violets in her eyes, On her cheeks their roses spread, On her lips their balmy sighs. On the grass her bonnet lies, On the grass her satchel flung; Who its secrets may surmise? Rosy fingers grope among Remnants of her dinner thereâ Dinner past, but not forgot; Dimpled hand with tender care Draws the bread and butter out. White and bare that arm and hand, And beneath the rippling stream, Like two pebbles on the strand, White the little ankles gleam. Leaning o'er the waters clear, Looking in the limpid spring Sees she there her cheeks appearâ Sees her blue eyes glistening? Crimson clouds and skies of blue, Morn and eve had mirror'd there; But those eyes and cheeks to view With their tints, might well compare. Breathless lie her lips apart, Motionless her arms incline, Wildly beats that little heartâ Ah! the child was feminine. Yes, the curse of Eve the motherâ Woman's vanityâthe spell On her falls, and eke another, Down the bread and butter fell. On the waters had she cast it: By and by it might be found. Foolish hand forgot to clasp itâ Let it fall upon the ground. Such is fate; and though we mutter, Why and wherefore? none decide. Ever falls one's bread and butter, Always on the buttered side? With her sorrows let us leave herâ Great her fault, let justice own; Great her punishmentânor grieve her With the chastening to come. Learning well this moral lesson: Though our visions still are fair, Humblest things in our possession Greater than illusions are. THE STUDENT'S DREAM âKNOWLEDGE IS POWERâ A student sat in his easy-chair; Around him many a pond'rous tome Of antiquarian lore was there, And the classic wealth of Greece and Rome. The light that swings 'twixt the oaken beams, Around and about him fitfully gleams In a pale prophetic shower; And the line on which he ponders and dreams, Is writtenââKnowledge is Power.â He dreamsâhis vision expansive grows, And on either side the wall recedes, And from out that misty chaos rose A pile of mortgages, bonds, and deeds, And gold in glittering columns heaped. A nation's debt might be reclaimed, A nation's honor be sustained, Or countries might in blood be steeped At the pen-and-ink stroke of this mighty lord Of Mammon, who sat by his treasured hoard. But the vision fled as he raised his head; He shrugged his shoulders, and, muttering, said: âRiches will changeâthey flee in an hour; To know, is eternalââKnowledge is Power.ââ He bow'd his head in his book again, And sighed, but it was not a sigh of pain. Was it an echo that, lingering nigh, Caught and repeated that long-drawn sigh? Or was it the lady sitting by? Oh, she was fair!âher presence there Suddenly, sweetly filled the air Like the scent of some opening flower rare, And Heaven was in her eye; Or such a glimpse as might have slid From under the tenderly guarded lid, Had none been there to spy. In the lap of her satin robe, she bore Of gems and jewels a precious store, For all that lavish wealth might spare, At beauty's shrine but offerings were. But the vision fled as he raised his head; He watched her departing, and sighing, said: âBeauty is boughtâit fades like a flower; Who can buy knowledge?ââKnowledge is Power.ââ In a robe antique, and of mien profound, Came a well-known face his own to greet, And he knew the pale brow that the laurel bound Was the sacred symbol of knowledge meet. In her eyes the ray of a soul divine Glowed like a gem in the pale moonshine With a radiance constant, quiet, and sweet. Her stature was slight, majestic and tall, Yet proudly erect she towered, withal, To homage used, for she knew that all The world was at her feet; Yet a silence kept as the student slept, And nearer she drew; by his side she stept; She spoke, and as clear her accents rung As a silver bell or an angel's tongue. He woke with a start, for his secret heart Felt that which bade all his dreams depart. âNeophyte, dreamer, slumberer, fool! Wouldst measure my power by musty rule? Or, say, dost thou seek what thou 'lt hardly own, The Alchemist's prize, or Philosopher's stone? For 't is not in sophist's or sage's thought, Is the mighty power of knowledge wrought; It is seen in the practiced deed, Not of musty scrolls, but of living men; The hearts, the passions, the motives ye ken, Should thy knowledge be, and its âpowerâ then Can turn them to thy need; For money is mighty, money is power, And beauty is strong in camp and bower; But money's the proof that knowledge is power, And beauty its slave, indeed; And, remember, that knowledge all alone May still be a fatal dower, And the strongest lever the world has known Is where beauty's the might that's to be shown And gold 's the prop that all may own, And âknowledge is the power!ââ THE HOMESTEAD BARN Past dreams of bliss our lives contain, And slight the chords that still retain A heart estranged to joys again, To scenes by memory's silver chain Close-linked, and ever yet apart, That like the vine, whose tendrils young Around some fostering branch have clung, Grown with its growth, as tho' it sprung From one united heart. I think of days long gone before, When, by a spreading sycamore, Stood, in the happy days of yore, Low-roofed, broad-gabled, crannied door, The homestead barn, where free from harm, In shadowy eaves the swallow built, In darkened loft the owlet dwelt; Secure lived innocence and guilt Within its sacred charm. By cobwebbed beams and rafters high I 've sat and watched the April sky, And saw the fleecy cirrus fly, Sunlight and shadow hurrying by, Chased by the glittering rain; Then shrunk to hear the pattering tread Of unseen feet above my head, Filled with a strange and wondering dread, Till sunlight smiled again. And, oh! those long, those summer days, The morning's glow, the noontide's blaze, Or when the just declining rays, Half shorn, mixed with the mellowing haze, And distant hills were veiled in gray; From newmown hay, with odors sweet, I 've watched the lowly bending wheat Droop lower in the yellow heat The lazy, livelong day. Those summer days too quickly fled, And my youth's summers early sped; Yet when my âsereâ of life is shed, I would were mine such harvest spread Within that barn of autumn born, That many a tale of summer told, Where golden corn and pumpkins rolled, And apples, that might scarcely hold The goddess' fabled horn; When springtime brought each feathered pair, When summer came with scented air, When autumn's fruits rolled fresh and fair, Or winter's store brought back the year, The treasured sweets it multiplies; And now at home, at eve appear The homestead barn, to me so dear; I would I read my right as clear âTo mansions in the skies.â TRYSTING âDown at the turn of the road Wait for me, dearest, at eight!â Here, at the turn of the road, I loiter, and linger, and wait. I was here when the flickering day Went out in a lingering flame; I was here in the twilight gray, And the stars have come since I came. From the wooded crest of the hill Orion looks over the lea, And Cetus is glimmering still In a purple and crimson sea. And the Pleiadsâall but the one, Withdrawn in her maidenly shame For the love that a mortal wonâ Are here, and you should be the same. She comes not! I turn to the right, And the white road dips in the gloom; She comes not! the left to my sight Is silent and dark as the tomb. Those tender palms on my eyes? Those slender arms round me thrown? Cupid, you cannot disguise Those rosy lips at my own! Here, at the turn of the road! âForgive me, my love, if I'm late!â Down at the turn of the road, Cupid, oh! who would n't wait? âTHE FOG BELLâ A deep bell is knolling Over the sea, Rolling and tolling Over the sea; Lazily swinging, Steadily bringing Tidings of terror, Danger is bringing, All the while solemnly, Mournfully singing: âFogs on the sand-bank,â Fogs on the deep, Fogs round the gallant ship Stealthily creep; Fogs on the forecastle, Quarter and waist, Fog in the binnacle, Fog in each place; Fog in the country, Fog on the moor, On the green upland, On the white shore; Fog in the marshes, Fog in the brake, Upon the river, Over the lake. Fog in the city, In the broad streetâ There want and luxury Heedlessly meet; Fog in the narrow lane, In the dark wayâ There shines the light of truth Never a ray. Fog in the haunts of crimeâ Vice and despair; Fog in the Justice seat Denser than there; Fog in the capitol, Where in the hall Grave legislators meetâ Fogs over all. Fog in the miser's heart, Dark'ning and drear; Fog that, in pity's eye, Melts to a tear; Things that delusively In the fogs loom, Men still unceasingly Grope for in gloom. Fog in the country, Fog on the deep, Fogs in the city Stealthily creep; Darkness around us, Darker, in sooth, Were there no heavenly Sunlight and truth. âJESSIEâ She is tripping, she is tripping Down the green and shady lane, And each footstep's like the dripping Of the early April rain. As she passes, fragrant grasses, Blooming flowers spring up again Where her dainty footprint presses, As from early April rain. Oh, the blessed, oft caressed, Flowing, glowing, auburn tresses, Or the fairy shape impressed In the gracefullest of dresses; To behold her, is to fold her To your heart in puzzled bliss, Whether still to wish her older Or that she were always this. Gentle Jessie! Heaven bless ye, From your slipper's dainty toe To the jaunty, canty, dressy Little flat's most killing bow! Would kind Heaven power had given Me the proper path to show Those retreating footsteps, even Guiding them the way to go. âDOLORESâ Seville's towers are worn and old; Seville's towers are gray and gold: Saffron, purple, and orange dyes, Meet at the edge of her sunset skies: Bright are Seville's maidens' eyes, Gay the cavalier's guitar: Music, laughter, low replies, Intermingling; and afar, Over the hill, over the dell, Soft and low: Adagio! Comes the knell of the vesper-bell, Solemnly and slow. Hooded nun, at the convent wall, Where the purple vines their tendrils throw, Lingering, looking, wouldst recall Aught of this giddy scene below? Turn that pensive glance on high: Seest thou the floods in yon blessed sky, The shores of those isles of the good and blest, Meeting, mingling, down the west? E'en as thou gazest, lo! they fade: So doth the world from these walls surveyed; Fleeting, false, delusive show; Beauty's form, but hectic's glow. âThe convent-walls are steep and high: Dolores! why are your cheeks so pale? Why do those lashes silent lie Over the orbs they scarce can veil, E'en as the storm-cloud, dim and dark, Shrouding the faint electric spark? Canst thou those languid fires conceal, Which scorched the youth of fair Castile? That tender half-distracted airâ Can that be faith; or is 't despair? That step, now feeble, faltering, slow; Is that the lightly tripping toe That gayly beat the throbbing floor, Or woke the echoing corridor, By purple Tagus' rippling shore, A summer month ago?â Sister, listen, nearer, higher! Voices sweet in the distant choir: âSalve! salve! ave Maria! Virgin, blest with Jesus' love, Turn our thoughts to thee above!â âDolores!â Mark ye that dying fall? âDolores!â Ho there! within the wall: Fly ye! the Ladye Superior call: A nun has fled from the convent wall! ELISE LINES WRITTEN IN AN ALBUM; CIRCA 1858 A roseâthrown on the drifting tide That laughs along the tinkling brook,â Tho' here and there it idly glide, Finds rest within some sheltered nook: And thus some heart tossed on the stream Of timeâimpelled by passion's breeze And folly's breathâmay find a dream Of hopeâupon thy breast,âElise! THE BAILIE O' PERTH (Bret Harte's first dialect poem) The Bailie o' Perth was a blithesome mon, And a blithesome mon was he, And his gude wife lov'd him well and true, And the bailie he lov'd she; Yet mickle or muckle the cause or kind, Whatever the pother be, Be it simple sair or unco deep, The twain could never agree. Syne spake the bailie with blithesome mind, Fair and soft spake he: âTwal lang year hae we married been, Yet we can never agree. Now, my ain sweet love, let us try for aye, Forever and aye to see If for ain blest time in all our life, You and I can ever agree. âNow listen to me: should it chance that ye Were paidlint in the lane, Ye should meet a bonnie buxom lass, And a winsome laddie, twain, Wha wad ye kiss, good dame?â he said, âWha wad ye kiss?â said he; âWad ye kiss the bonnie buxom lass, Or the winsome gay laddie?â âHoot awa, mon! are ye ganging daft? Are ye ganging daft?â said she; âTwal lang year hae we married been, And I have been true to ye; Mon hae never my twa lips touched, Nae mon hae glinted at me.â âBut wha wad ye kiss, good dame?â said he; âI wad kiss the lass,â said she. Out laughed the bailie with muckle glee, For a blithesome mon was he; âTwal lang year hae we married been, And now for ainst we agree; If ye met a lad and a buxom lass Down in the gowans fine, To kiss the lass wad be your choice, And I ken it wad be mine!â QUESTION When I meet her little figure, Simple, guileless little figure, With its graceful crest that tosses Up and down the flowing sea, Does she dream that all above herâ All around herâstill must love her, Just as I do? Does she ever Look at me? When the sunset's flush is on her, Do her fancies ever wander, Do her girlish fancies ever Mingle with the flowing sea? In her tender meditation, In her mystic speculation, Is there any lonely figure Just like me? When she took the flowers I sent herâ Sent in secretâsent in longing; And all, all, except the daisy, Tossed them on the flowing sea; When she placed that happy flower On her bosom's trembling dower, Now I wonder did she ever Think of me? Hush, my heart. She 's coming, coming; Loud above the city's humming, I can hear her footfall's beating, With the ever flowing sea. Rosy redâa flush is on her, As she passesâhave I won her? Eros! help meâI am sinking In the ever flowing sea. LETHE STANZAS FOR MUSIC I Love once sat by a willow shade, That grew by a fabled river; His bow unstrung, by his side he laid, And hung up his classic quiver. Love then cried; âYe who 've sighed, For passion unrequitedâ In this flood Love's young bud, Plungedâis ever blighted!â II There came a maid to the willow shade, Her heart with passion swelling; A hopeless love on her sweet cheek preyed, In her breast a deep grief dwelling. But, oh, think! On the brink, Lingered that sad daughter; While her fair Graces rare, Mirrored back the water. III From her cheeks she parts each tress, Proudly back she threw them; Crimson tints her cheeks confess, As she paused to view them. âIs it meet One so sweet, In that gloomy riverâ Plunge for love? Saints above! Ugh! It makes me shiver!â MIDAS' WOOING Midas woos with coach and pair, Midas woos with princely air, Midas sits within in state, But another 's at the gate. What cares Midas who waits there, Kate 's within and Kate is fair, Young and lively: that is well, Has she got a heart to sell? Kate can sing if she but try, She might, were another by; Katie sings a lover's air, Will she find an echo there? Kate plays best of all the girls, Katie plays the âShower of Pearls,â Some one in that witching hour, Thinks of Jove, and DanaÃ«'s shower. From above the hawthorn bush, Peeps the moon and wakes the thrush, Bird and moon and music grate, Like the hinges on the gate. Midas risesâtakes his cane, âWill be proud to call again.â Off goes Midas. Off goes Kate; Two stand at the garden gate. THE WRECKER (From a Painting) âHo, Mark and Will! What, shirking men! Why do ye loiter along the sand,â Twiddling your thumbs and idling, when So brave a cargo bestrews the land? Lend a hand to this bale of spice Fragrant as breezes from India's shore, And this oaken chest that buried lies I warrant, with dollars a precious store. âYou tell me she was a noble ship! And a noble cargo she cast away; And the Captain thought of a lucky tripâ And the crewâthey all were lost, you say? 'T is a blessed wreck, for I dreamt this night That my daughter Nan, with her looks of grace, She that fled from her father's sight, Stood by my hammock, face to face. âAnd I knew that I yet might hoard and save Enough to follow her some fair day; It was God who sent a barque so braveâ May he shrive the souls that were cast away, Then haste ye, menâwhy do ye stare? Why do ye turn your eyes from mine? Why do you gaze at the open air? At the land, at the beacon and flashing brine!â âMaster! The waves were wild to-night And ran like wolves on the smooth white beach, And broke with a roar on the rocky bight, And swept to the cliffs in their length'ning reach. And she struck, d' ye see, upon âDevils Back,â And in less than the turn of a glass was gone And I heard her spars and timbers crack Over the sea and the whistling storm. âAnd we saw,â'twas Bill and I stood hereâ A great wave come to the lab'ring ship As she thumped and struggled as though in fearâ But it caught her up like a cooper's chip And then there was naught but the boiling surge, And the hissing waterâbut soon to view A speck seemed borne to the glimmery verge Of the rocky bightâand Bill saw it too. âSo we ranâBill and Iâand Bill dashed out With a line that I held, slung around his waist, And thrice he rolled over and bobbed about And thrice he brought up at the selfsame place. He'll tell you so, Master,â't was not his fault, If after he struggled an hour there, He only caught somethingâ't was damp and salt, And dragged it out by its long fair hair. âBut we laid it afterward on the sand, Take my arm, Master, I'll show you what.â They led him down on the cold white sand And up to a quiet and sheltered spot, And there by the billows, and beacon's light, Again he was standing face to face, As he stood in a dream on that stormy night, With his daughter Nan and her look of grace. BY THE SAD SEA WAVES I was walking down on the sands one night With the girl of my choiceâthe woman I loved; And I picked up a shell on the pebbly strand, And thought even thus shall my love be prov'd: âTake this, dearest girl, for 't is like to me,â Said I with a gesture of fond entreat; â'Tis a stranger come from the changing sea To languish and die at thy own dear feet!â She looked in my face in her scornful glee, While her dainty foot beat the cold white sand, âI will take the shell, but not you,â said she; âHe offers his house, you only your hand!â EFFIE This poem originally appeared in the Golden Era. It was later published in St. Nicholas Magazine, with the name changed to Jessie, and afterward set to music under that title by Leopold Damrosch, and also by N. H. Allen. Effie is both young and fair, Dewy eyes and sunny hair; Sunny hair and dewy eyes Are not where her beauty lies. Effie is both fond and true, Heart of gold and will of yew; Will of yew and heart of goldâ Still her charms are scarcely told. If she yet remain unsung, Pretty, constant, docile, young, What remains not here compiled? Effie is a little child! MY SOUL TO THINE A TRANSCENDENTAL VALENTINE Antithesis of Light, which is but gloom, Myself in darkness shrouds; I know not why Thy glances re-illumineâyet of them, One Is ever in my eye! Perchance 't is why I hold this thought most dearâ What is, may still be, what is fixed won't change: The Future and the Past are not as clear As things that are less strange. Who knows what's What, yet says not which is Whichâ He is reticent and precise in speech; The same should tune his thoughts to concert pitch By some deep sounding beach. But he who knoweth Which and what is Whichâ He is not simple nor perchance is dullâ Shall occupy himself a vacant niche In some stupendous Whole. SERENADE (ADAPTED TO THE LATITUDE OF SAN FRANCISCO) âO list, lady, list! while thy lover outside Pours forth those fond accents that thrill thee; O list! both thy doors and thy windows beside For fear that some thorough draught chill thee. The âsweet summer morn'sâ hanging low in the sky, And the fog 's drifting wildly around me; There is damp in my throat, there is sand in my eye, And my old friend Neuralgia has found me. âO list, lady, list! ere this thin searching mist Subdues all my amorous frenzy; The Pleiads' âsoft influenceâ here is, I wist, Replaced by the harsh influenza; And now, lady sweet, I must bid thee âgood-night,â A night that would quench Hymen's torch, love, For a lute by the fire is much more polite, Than a song and catarrh in the porch, love.â THE PRIZE-FIGHTER TO HIS MISTRESS O, believe not the party who says love is bought, Nor lend thy fond âlugâ when his tale he'd begin; But bid him behold thy dear âmugâ on this breast, This âbunch of fivesâ clasping thy own lovely âfin.â Or show him the âhome-brewedâ that flushes thy ânob,â When in thy âjug-handleâ my love I recite, And then if his âgogglesâ are not Cupid's own, He'll reel to his corner at that âdraft at sight.â What âpunishmentâ waits on the cove that deceives, How âsoggyâ the âsmasherâ that gets him so prime, When he âthrows up the spongeâ at the ultimate round, And Eternity callsâand he can't âcome to Time.â Yet, Mary, dear Mary, such love is not mine, But âmawleyâ in âmawleyâ together we'll tread; The âbeltâ for the cestus of Venus I'll change, And know but one âRingââin the ring we are wed. MARY'S ALBUM WRITTEN IN 1863, IN AN ALBUM BELONGING TO CHARLES WARREN STODDARD Sweet Mary, maid of San Andreas, Upon her natal day, Procured an album, double-gilt, Entitled, âThe Bouquet.â But what its purpose was beyond Its name, she could not guess; And so between its gilded leaves The flowers he gave she'd press. Yet blame her not, poetic youth! Nor deem too great the wrong; She knew not Hawthorne's bloom, nor loved Macaulay-flowers of song. Her hymn-book was the total sum Of her poetic lore, And, having read through Dr. Watts, She did not ask for Moore. But when she ope'd her book again, How great was her surprise To find the leaves on either side Stained deep with crimson dyes. And in that roseâhis latest giftâ A shapeless form she views; Its fragrance sped, its beauty fled, And vanished all its dews. O Mary, maid of San Andreas! Too sad was your mistakeâ Yet one, methinks, that wiser folk Are very apt to make. Who 'twixt these leaves would fix the shapes That love and truth assume, Will find they keep, like Mary's rose, The stain, and not the bloom. THE REJECTED STOCKHOLDER A LOCAL MONOLOGUE I thought that I had won her heart, Before assessments came To chill the fever of her blood And check her youthful flame; But ah! 't was not for me, but mine, She spread her female snaresâ I asked for one to share my love, And not to love my shares! I wooed her when the young May moon And tranquil patient stars Their lustre spread, and all the earth Seemed strewn with silver bars; Her praise I whispered to the sky, The free winds spoke her fame, And one locationâall in vainâ I tookâin her sweet name! But now another's offering lies Before that fickle shrine; Another claims her handâhis claim Is worth much more than mine; But though he offers all I lack To make her joy completeâ I would not stand in that man's shoes Unless I had his feet! O, tell me not of golden legs That Kilmanseggs have known; They 're nothing to the silver feet My fickle fair would own. The dream is past; but in these fond Certificates I viewâ Observe, ye credulous, what faith And printers' ink may do. My loving verses she returns Though once she thought them fineâ She 's grown so critical in feet She scans each faulty line. And yet my fate I meekly bear And find relief in sighs; For oh, no Savage rules this breast, Nor Chollar that may rise! Oh, youth, who seekest Fortune's smile, Shun, if thou canst, alway, The woman's wile, the broker's guile, That gild but to betray. So use this world that in the next, When here thy days shall end, Thy last six feet of earth shall yield To thee a dividend! ON A NAUGHTY LITTLE BOY, SLEEPING Just now I missed from hall and stair A joyful treble that had grown As dear to me as that grave tone That tells the world my older care. And little footsteps on the floor Were stayed. I laid aside my pen, Forgot my theme, and listenedâthen Stole softly to the library door. No sight! no sound!âa moment's freak Of fancy thrilled my pulses through: âIfânoââand yet, that fancy drew A father's blood from heart and cheek. And thenâI found him! There he lay, Surprised by sleep, caught in the act, The rosy vandal who had sacked His little town, and thought it play: The shattered vase; the broken jar; A match still smouldering on the floor; The inkstand's purple pool of gore; The chessmen scattered near and far. Strewn leaves of albums lightly pressed This wicked âBaby of the Woodsâ; In fact, of half the household goods This son and heir was seizedâpossessed. Yet all in vain, for sleep had caught The hand that reached, the feet that strayed; And fallen in that ambuscade The victor was himself o'erwrought. What though torn leaves and tattered book Still testified his deep disgrace! I stopped and kissed the inky face, With its demure and calm outlook. Then back I stole, and half beguiled My guilt, in trust that when my sleep Should come, there might be One who'd keep An equal mercy for His child. AT THE SEPULCHRE (Thomas Starr King) SUNDAY, OCTOBER 9, 1864 Here in God's sunshine, peaceful lie, Though not beneath yon arches' swell; One springing roof aloneâthe skyâ Can hold the flock that loved thee well. Yon sacred gates are free to all, Who join in Sabbath praise and prayer; Thy pulpit grave, beside shall call A week-day fold from street and square. Though o'er thy tomb no anthems rise, The world its labor-hymn shall sing, And sliding footsteps drown the sighs Of small-tongued grasses, whispering. And greener yet that spot shall grow, For thy dear dust within it laid, And brighter yet the sunlight glowâ And dim and grateful seem the shade. For when the sun slopes down the west, The shadow of yon sacred wall, Like God's right arm across thy breast Near and protectingly shall fall. And all night long above thy urn The patient stars shall pierce the gloom, Like those eternal lamps that burn And circle round a royal tomb. And those who deemed they knew the best Shall find how foolish was their claimâ And fear thy liberal bounty, lest It clip their dividend of fame. And some of humbler faith shall stand Before thy tomb, and watch its door, Expectant that some angel's hand May roll the stone that lies before. ARCADIA REVISITED Ah, here's the spotâthe very tree Where once I carved an L. and E., Symbolical of her and me Bound in Love's rosy fetters; Since then five weary years are spent, And yet I think we 're both content That in Love's Book we never went Beyond our simple letters. For, looking through the rustling leaves, I see the humble cottage eaves Where now my Em. no longer weaves Her mystic maiden fancies, But milks her cowsâshe called 'em kine In the brave days when she was mineâ But now she 's dropped those phrases fine She borrowed from romances. But here 's the placeâthe very tree Where once I fell on bended knee And breathed my burning vowsâwhile she Stood by in pale pink muslin. I kissed her handâbut why revamp Old feelings now?âthe grass is damp, And what with this rheumatic cramp To kneel now would be puzzling. She walks no more 'neath starlit skies, She calls the evening mists that rise Miasma, and the dew that lies Is damp and cold and shocking. She now wears boots. Five years ago Her skirts she gathered up below; 'T was not from dampness, but to show Her slippers and white stocking. Beneath this shade we used to read âMaud Muller,â and we both agreed The Judge was wrongâbut why proceed? She's married to another! She has not pinedâthat form is stout That once this arm was clasped about, She has two girls; they 're both, no doubt, The image of their mother! She said she loved not âwealth or state,â But most adored the âwise and great,â And gave a look to intimate That this was my complexion; âHer husband should be eyed like Mars,â That's he, there, letting down the bars, In cowhide boots. No doubt her Pa's, But O, not her selection! And yet, am I her young love's dream: The pensive lover that did seem The rightful Prince who should redeem The promise of her fancies? And I that same dyspeptic youth Who rang the chimes on âsoothâ and âtruth,â Minus that cuspidate tooth Whose presence kills romances? O Love, behind yon leafy screen! Why can't all trees be evergreen? Why can't all girls be sweet sixteen, All men but one-and-twenty? Why are the scars that hearts must wear Deeper than those yon tree may bear? And why are lovers now so rare, And married folk so plenty? THE SABBATH BELLS Sunday, July 30, 1865 Ring, Sabbath bells, O softly ring, And with your peaceful accents bring To loving ears a welcome tale Of flowing seas and gentle galeâ Ring! Peal, all ye Sabbath bellsâO peal, And tell the few who watch and kneel Of hidden snares and sunken rocks, Of surges white and sudden shocksâ Peal! Toll, O ye Sabbath bells, and toll Each passing and heroic soul: Toll for the sacrifices sweet, For duty done and work completeâ Toll! Chime, O ye Sabbath bells, O chime! Each man has his appointed time; The worst is but a glad release; Chime, Sabbath bells, a song of Peaceâ Chime! IMPORTANT MEXICAN CORRESPONDENCE AN INTERCEPTED LETTER Dear Trem:â From âorange groves and fields of balmâ These loving lines I send, But first you really ought to know The feelings of your friend. For when it 's winter where you live, The weather here 's like June; The âSeason's Choirâ Thomson sings, In fact, is out of tune. All day at ninety-eight degrees The mercury has stood, Without a figure I may say, I'm âin a melting mood.â The fields are parched and so 's my lipsâ I quaff at every spring; So dry a âsummer,â Trem, my dear, âTwo swallowsâ could not bring. You know âtwo swallows do not make It summerââbut methinks The summer in this latitude Is made of many drinks. The politics, I grieve to say, I find in great confusionâ For like the earth the people have A daily revolution. Their manners to a stranger here, Is stranger yet to see; Last night in going to a ball A ball went into me. I 'm fond of reading, as you know, But then it was a sin To be obliged against my will, To take a Bullet-in. They cried, âDIOS Y LIBERTAD!â And then pitched into me; I hate to hear a sacred name Used with such âliberty.â I should have said to you before, But every method fails, For since they have impressed the men, Of course, they 've stopped the males. âMAD RIVERâ Where the Redwood spires together Pierce the mists in stormy weather, Where the willow's topmost feather Waves the limpid waters o'er; Where the long and sweeping surges Sing their melancholy dirges, There the river just emerges On the sad Pacific's shore. From the headland, high and hoary, From the western promontory, Where the sunset seas of glory Sparkle with an emerald sheen, You may see it slowly twining, In the valley low reclining, Like a fringe of silver shiningâ Edging on a mantle green. You can see its gleaming traces In the valeâthe pleasant places Where, amidst the alder's mazes, There the salmon berries grow, Until faint and fianter growing, In the upland dimly flowing, Where the serried hills are showing, And the shadows come and go. In those days, long gone and over, Ere the restless pale-faced rover Sought the quiet Indian cover, Many, many moons ago, Warrior braves met one another, Not as ally, friend or brother, But the fires of hate to smother In the placid water's flow. All the day they fierce contended, And the battle scarce had ended When the bloody sun descended, And the river bore away All the remnants of that slaughter In a crimson tide, the water, And they call it Patawata, Patawat, a tribe of North American Indians living on lower Mad River, California. Ever since the fatal day. THE PONY EXPRESS (The Pony Express was, at one time, the sole dependence of the Pacific Coast for the latest news from the Atlantic) In times of adventure, of battle and song, When the heralds of victory galloped along, They spurred their faint steeds, lest the tidings too late Might change a day's fortune, a throne, or a state. Though theirs was all honor and gloryâno less Is his, the bold Knight of the Pony Express. No corselet, no vizor, nor helmet he wears, No war-stirring trumpet or banner he bears, But pressing the sinewy flanks of his steed, Behold the fond missives that bid him âGod-speed.â Some ride for ambition, for glory, or less, âFive dollars an ounceâ asks the Pony Express. Trip lightly, trip lightly, just out of the town, Then canter and canter, o'er upland and down, Then trot, pony, trot, over upland and hill, Then gallop, boy, gallop, and galloping still, Till the ring of each horse-hoof, as forward ye press, Is lost in the track of the Pony Express. By marshes and meadow, by river and lake, By upland and lowland, by forest and brake, By dell and by caÃ±on, by bog and by fen, By dingle and hollow, by cliff and by glen, By prairie and desert, and vast wilderness, At morn, noon, and evening, God speed the Express. THE ARGUMENT OE LURLINE Air: âThe Tall Young Oystermanâ Count Rudolph was a noble gent, as lived upon the Rhine, Who spent his money very free in Lager Beer and Wine; The Baron Truenfels, likewise, was neighbor of the same, Which had a rather uppish girlâG. Truenfels by name. Rudolph would wed Miss Truenfels, but was n't it a go? Each thought that t'other had the tin (you know how lovers blow), But when old T. says, âPungle down,â Count Rudolph he says, âStuff; I 've youth and rank, that's more than goldâ; says G., âIt ain't enough. âI wants a diamond thingamyâlikewise a nice trossoo, I wants a kerridge of me own, and so, young man, adooâ; The Baron also cuts up roughâbut Rudolph is content, And merely takes a stiffer horn, observing, âLet her went.â Now just before this jolly row, a gal they called Lurline Was living down at Lurlineburgh, of which she was the Queen; She was a Lady Dashawayâwhen water was on handâ But had some spirits of her own she likewise could command. This girl close by a whirlpool satâthis female named Lurlineâ And played with most exquisite taste upon the tamborine; The way the sailors steered into them whirlpools was a sinâ Young men, beware of sich sirens who thus take fellers in. Now Count Rudolph was wide awake, beyond the power of suction; Which caused Lurline to fall in love and seek an introduction. And when he 's tight, one day, she slips a ring upon his finger; And thus Count Rudolph is bewitched by that bewitching singer. Then straightway in his boat he jumps, which soon begins to sink, While all his brave com-pan-i-ons are yelling on the brink, âYou're half-seas-over now, you fool,âcome back, you'll surely drownâ; Down goes the gallant German gent, a whistling âDerry Down.â Down, down among the oyster-beds, he finds the sweet Lurline, A cutting such a heavy swellâa gorgeous submarine; Her father Rhineberg's very rich, and fellers said, who punned, âHe took deposits from the tars and kept a sinking fund.â Count Rudolph did consent to stay at Rhineberg's flash hotel, And half-made up his mind that with Lurline he 'd ever dwell; âI'm partial to the water-cure and fond of clams,â says he, âBut such as you, Miss Rhineberg, are a subject quite per se.â But suddenly he hears a noise, which made him weaken some The howling of his friends aboveâsays he, âI must go home, Good-bye, Miss R.â âHold up!â says she, we'll do the handsome thing, Pa gives this massy chunk of gold. You keep my magic ring.â So Rudolph takes the ring and gold, and comes home with a rush, And very glad his neighbors was to see him come so flush. And even old Miss Truenfels to welcome him began, And says, âI always thought you was a very nice young man.â Likewise she says, âMy eye,â, and makes believe to faint away, And sich-like gammon. But the Count says, âCome, now, that won't pay! I loves another!â âCruel man! That ring I now diskiverâ Say whose?â âMy gal's!â She snatches it and chucks it in the river. Now one of Lurline's father's help had caught the ring and ran To her and says, âYou see what comes of loving that young man.â Poor Lurline feels somewhat cut upâand to assuage her pain She takes her father's oyster sloop and comes ashore again. 'T was lucky that she did come up, for Rudolph's friends were bent On sharing Rudolph's golden store, without Rudolph's consent; And him they would assassinate, but Lurline she says, âHold!â And waves a wand until they stand like statoos, stiff and cold. They stood like statoos on the bridgeâit was a bridge of sighs; For straightway most unpleasantly the tide began to rise; It rose, but when the river swept away the bridge at last, They found, although the tide was flood, their chances ebbing fast. It rose until the wicked all had found a watery graveâ And then it sank and left Rudolph and neighbors in a cave. Rudolph then marries Miss Lurline; is happy, rich, and able To take the lowest bid to lay the next Atlantic Cable. THE YERBA BUENA When from the distant lands, and burning South, Came Juniperoâthrough the plains of drouth,â Bringing God's promise by the word of mouth, With blistered feet and fever-stricken brain, He sank one night upon the arid plain,â If God so willed itânot to rise again; A heathen convert stood in wonder by; âIf God is Godâthe Father shall not die,â He said. The dying priest made no reply. âThis in His name!â the savage cried, and drew From the parched brook an herb that thereby grew, And rubbed its leaves his dusky fingers through; Then with the bruisÃ¨d stalks he bound straightway The Padre's feet and temples where he lay, And sat him down in faith, to wait till day; When rose the Padreâas the dead may riseâ Reading the story in the convert's eyes, âA miracle! God's herbââthe savage cries. âNot so,â replies the ever humble priest; âGod's loving goodness showeth in the least, Not God's but good be known the herb thou seest!â Then rising up he wandered forth alone; And ever since, where'er its seed be sown, As Yerba Buena is the good herb known. TREASURER A?Y State Treasurer Ashley, of California, in 1863 paid the State's tax to the Government in legal tender notes. Gold, of course, at this time was at a premium, and Ashley had received this Federal tax in gold. The press severely criticized him for the transaction, and upon an attempt to repeat the offense the notes were refused by the United States Treasurer. Air: âA Frog He would A-wooing Goâ Our A?y would a-brokering go, Heigh ho, for A?y! Whether the people would let him or no, Whether they fancied his practices low, Or the economical-comical show Of their State Treasurer A?y. The Federal tax he collected in gold, Heigh ho, for A?y, But straightway the coin and the taxpayers sold, By buying up Treasury notes, so we 're told, At a nice little discountâO, that was a bold Speculation of Treasurer A?y's. Let poor Uncle Samuel do what he may, Heigh ho, for A?y. What does he care what the newspapers say? Let Volunteers starve upon half of their pay, Lord bless usâit 's the economical way Of great State Treasurer A?y. What shall we do with our great financier? Heigh ho, for A?y. He 's rather expensive to keep by the year, As a business transaction 't is certainly clear To get ourselves rid of him no discount 's dear, That exchanges State Treasurer A?y. COLENSO RHYMES FOR ORTHODOX CHILDREN A smart man was Bishop Colensoâ 'T were better he never had been soâ He said, âA queer book Is that same Pentateuch!â Said the clergy, âYou musn't tell men so.â There once was a Bishop of Natal Who made this admission most fatal; He said: âBetween us I fear Exodus Is a pretty tough yarn for Port Natal.â Shall I believe that Noah's Ark Rode on the waters blue? Or must I, with Colenso, say The story is untrue? What then becomes of all my joysâ That ark I loved so wellâ Those tigersâdear to little boysâ Shall they this error swell? There once was a Bishop, and what do you think! He talked with a Zulu, who says with a wink, âFolks say that the Pentateuch 's true.âI deny it.â And never since then has this Bishop been quiet. POEM DELIVERED AT THE PATRIOTIC EXERCISES IN THE METROPOLITAN THEATRE, SAN FRANCISCO, JULY 4, 1863. (Written for the event by the poet of the day, Bret Harte, and read by the Reverend Thomas Sir King.) It's hard, on Independence Day, to find, with Thomas Moore, Your âMinstrel boy,â his harp and song has taken to the warâ To ask some sober citizen to seize the passing time And turn from scanning âsilver feetâ to cesuras of rhyme! But then we need no poet's aid to lift our eyes and look Beyond our Ledger's narrow rim, and post the nation's bookâ To strike our country's balance-sheet, nor shrink in foolish pride Because the ink is black that brings a balance to our side! We 've names enough of rhythmic swell our halting verse to fill, There 's Bennington, and Concord Bridge, and Breed's or Bunker's Hill; There 's Lexington and Valley Forgeâwhose anvils' ringing peal, Beat out on dreary winter nights the Continental steel! There 's Yorktown, Trenton, Stony Point, King's Mill and Brandywine To endâin lieu of rebel's necksâsome patriotic line; There 's SaratogaâMonmouth tooâwho can our limit fix? Enoughâthe total added up is known as Seventy-Six! With themes like these to flush the cheek, and bid the pulses play Amidst the glories of the Past, we gather here to-dayâ The twig our Fathers planted then has grown a spreading tree, Whose branches sift their blossoms white, to-day, on either sea! We 've grown too large, some people thinkâour neighbor, 'cross the wayâ Suggests Division, thoughâjust nowâsubstraction 's more his wayâ (But he 's a Diplomatic friend we neither seek nor fear, Who gives the North his public voiceâthe South his privateer!) No, no, we stand alone to-day, as when, one fierce July, The sinking lion saw new stars flash from the western skyâ To-day, old vows our hearts renewâthese throes that shake the Earth Are but the pangs that usher in the Nation's newer birth! God keep us allâdefend the rightâdraw nearer while we sing The song our country asks to-day, till hills and valleys ring; (But first we'll draw our metre's rein e'er we again begin, As soldiers from their battle front when ranks are closing in.) (The Song) O, God of our countryâif silent we come, With wreaths that are old to thy altar to-day; 'T is but that elsewhere, to the beat of thy drum, Our love pours its roses far redder than they! If the ring of our silver and gold be untrue, And chimes no accord to the clash of thy steel; It changes, dissolving, to fall like the dew, In silence to strengthenâin mercy to heal! Shall the ties that we love by false hands be unbound? Shall we turn away when our brothers appeal To the youngest of allâwho, like Benjamin, found The silver cup hid in his measure of meal? No, Lord, we are oneâwe must come to thy door, As martyrs, togetherâtogether as free; Though the tempest that lashes the rough Plymouth shore Shall mingle its spray with the calm Western sea! Far better the tempest than yon lurid glow That lights, while it mocks, the deep gloom of the skyâ Far better the lightning that smites with one blow, Than the Copperhead's crest as uplifted on high! Let the foe tempt our youth in his treacherous haste, Our blades shall defend the bright colors we bear; As our Cactus protects in the desolate waste, The one tint of Eden that God has left there! Then one ringing cheer for the deed and the dayâ One smile for the presentâone tear for the past; Lord! lend us thine ear when thy servants shall pray, Our future may show how thy mercies still last! SOUTH PARK (SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA, 1864) (After Gray) The foundry tolls the knell of parting day, The weary clerk goes slowly home to tea, The North Beach car rolls onward to the bay, And leaves the world to solitude and me. Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight, And through the Park a solemn hush prevails, Save, in the distance, where some school-boy wight Rattles his hoop-stick on the iron rails; Save, that from yonder jealous-guarded basement Some servant-maid vehement doth complain, Of wicked youths who, playing near her casement, Project their footballs through her window-pane. Can midnight lark or animated âbustâ To these grave scenes bring mirth without alloy? Can shrill street-boys proclaim their vocal trust In John, whose homeward march produces joy? Alas! for them no organ-grinders play, Nor sportive monkey move their blinds genteel; Approach and read, if thou canst read, the lay, Which these grave dwellings through their stones reveal; âHere rests his fame, within yon ring of earth, A soul who strove to benefit mankindâ Of private fortune and of public worth, His tradeâfirst man, then sugar he refined. âLarge was his bounty, and he made his mark; Read here his record free from stains or blots: He gave the public all he hadâhis Park; He sold the publicâall he askedâhis lots!â THE PLAZA (SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA, 1864) (After Sir Walter Scott) If thou wouldst view the Plaza aright, Go visit it by the pale moonlight; For the gay beams of lightsome day Show that the fountain does not play. When the broken benches are hid in shade, With many a vagrant recumbent laid; When the clock on the Monumental tower Tolls to the night the passing hour; When cabman and hackman alternately Entreat and threatenâindulging free In coarse yet forcible imagery; When the scrolls that show thee the playhouse nigh, In monstrous letters do feign and lie, Of âFun divest of Vulgarityâ; When Bella Union is heard to rave O'er the last conundrum the minstrel gave; When the street-boy pausesâintent upon The band at Gilbert's Melodeonâ Then goâbut go alone the while, And view John Bensley's ruined pile, And, home returningâdo not swear If thou hast seen some things more fair. THE FIRST BROOM RANGER [Part of the George B. McClellan torchlight procession in San Francisco, October 11, 1864, consisted of nearly a thousand men carrying brooms, called âBroom Rangers.â They were sympathizers with McClellan in his campaign for President against Abraham Lincoln.] AN OLD STORY WITH A NEW MORAL Once upon the Cornish strand Rose a tide so vast and brimming, That it overflowed the land, And the hamlet set a-swimming. Every cellar was submerged, Yet the tide kept slowly swelling Till the waters broke and surged O'er the threshold of each dwelling. Then it was an ancient crone (True to what tradition taught her) Seized her broom, and, all alone, Set to sweeping out the water. Through that ancient female's room Rolled the mighty ocean past herâ Still the old girl with her broom Only worked and swept the faster. When the people gathered round And in fear and terror sought her, All of that poor dame they found Was her BROOM upon the water. Only with her latest breath Had she ceased her work gigantic: Fairly, squarely met her death, Sweeping out the vast Atlantic. ANSWERING THE BELL A STORY OF THE LATE EARTHQUAKE (SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 8, 1865) At Number Four, had Dennis More A decent situationâ A Celtic youth, who showed, in truth, But little cultivation, And âwore the greenââthe kind, I mean, Not reached by legislation. His knowledge did not go beyond The doorbell he attended, The boots he blackedâthe services On which his place depended; Yet with his humble duties he A certain zeal had blended. One Sunday mornâthe folks were all At church, and no doubt sleeping, While Dennis More at Number Four His household watch was keepingâ When all at once there came a ring That set his pulses leaping. He started to his feet, but ere He took erect position, A certain trembling in his knees Betrayed their weak condition; And looking round, poor Dennis found This fearful exhibition: The kitchen clock that ere the shock The time of day was showing, Had stopped its pendulum, although The clock itself was going; It fellâhe thought the End of Time Had come with no man's knowing. The tumblers tumbled on the shelves, Moved by mysterious forces, The plates were shifted as they are In dinners of twelve courses; And knives went racing for the plate, Just like St. Leger horses. But high above the general crash He heard the doorbell ringing, And staggering to his feet he reached The hall where he saw swinging The study door, and down before Its bookshelves he fell, clinging. One hurried glance he gaveâenough For fatal confirmationâ The very globe upon its stand Still rocked to its foundation, And all the standard volumes seemed In active circulation. The fearful thrill, continuing still, Had loosed âThe Stones of Venice,â The law-books just above his head Ejectment seemed to menaceâ Till down fell âCoke on Littleton,â Followed by âKentâ on Dennis! The very poets were disturbedâ The mild and peaceful Lakers, As though they 'd caught from âAspen Courtâ Some power that made them Shakers; Or, that the âLife of William Pennâ Had turned them all to Quakers. The âTestimony of the Rocks,â In rocking, was appallingâ Thermometer and weather-glass Both side by side were falling; Yet 'midst the jarâa Leyden jarâ He heard the doorbell calling. Half dead, he reached the hall again,â Sometimes on all-fours creeping,â Wide swung the parlor's creaking door, And, through the portals peeping, He saw a Turkish ottoman Like some wild dervish leaping; Four high-backed chairs that waltzed in pairs, Two easy-chairs coquetting; Andâlike some dowager that found A partner hard of gettingâ The piano against the wall Was right and left foot poussetting. Yet, spite of giddy sights and scenes Of books and portraits reeling, To Dennis' brain one thing was plainâ The doorbell still was pealing; He seized the knob expectant of Some frightful form revealing! The hinges swungâthe door was flung Wide open, but no spying Disclosed the hand that rung the bell, Nor anybody trying, Save that a pale-faced man stood near, The walls intently eyeing. One bound gave Dennis to the ground And seized the rash spectatorâ With wicked fingers round his throat He clutched his respirator: âIs thim your Sunday thricks?â he cried, âYe haythen agitator!â âThe earthquake!â gasped the wretch. With scorn Bold Dennis drew his brows down; âThe airthquake, is it?â Then he gave A forcible but coarse nounâ âAnd that 's the wake excuse ye 'd give For ringing master's house down!â MIDSUMMER A SAN FRANCISCO MADRIGAL âThe air Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself Unto our several senses.â Macbeth. Now Cancer holds the fiery sun, And Sirius flames in yonder skies, Midsummer's languid reign's begunâ Arise, my lady sweet, arise; Come forth ere evening's shadows fallâ But, dearest, don't forget thy shawl. For why, methinks these zephyrs bland Are brisk and jocund in their play. These tears, thou may'st not understand, Spring but from joy at such a day; And, dearest, what thou deem'st a frown Is but to keep my beaver down. Now generous Nature kindly sifts Her blessings free from liberal hand: How varied are her graceful gifts; How softâ(yes, dearest, that was sand, A trifleâand by Nature thrown O'er this fresh signatureâher own!) Here let us sit and watch, till morn, The fleecy fog that creeps afar, And, like a poultice, soothes the torn And wind-bruised face of cliff and scar; Nor fear no chill from damp nor dew, Norâ(really! bless my soulâa-tschu!) A sneezeâ't is nothingâwhat of that? Or if I choose, in youthful guise, To chase this lightly flying hat, Instead of painted butterfliesâ 'T is but the latitude, you know, The season givesâwell, well, we'll go. And when once more within our cot, Where sweetly streams the fragrant tea, And buttered muffins crisp and hot, Their welcome spread for you and me; Then, love, by fires that glitter bright, We'll sing Midsummer's soft delight. POEM DELIVERED ON THE OCCASION OF THE LAYING OF THE CORNER-STONE OF THE CALIFORNIA DEAF, DUMB, AND BLIND ASYLUM, SEPTEMBER 26, 1867 Written for this event by Bret Harte and read by John Swett Fair the terrace that o'erlooks Curving bay and sheltered nooks; Groves that break the western blasts, Steepled distance fringed with masts, And the gate that fronts our home With its bars of cold sea-foam. Here no flashing signal falls Over darkened sea and sail; Here no ruddy lighthouse calls White-winged Commerce with its hail; But above the peaceful vale Watchful, silent, calm and pale, Science lifts her beacon walls. Love, alone, the lamp whose beam Shines above the troubled stream; Here shall patience, wise and sweet, Gather round her waiting feet God's unfinished few, whom fate And their failings consecrate; Haply that her skill create What His will left incomplete. Ah, Bethsaida's pool no more Sees the miracles of yore; Faith no more to blinded eyes Brings the light that skill denies; Not again shall part on earth Lips that Nature sealed from birth. Though His face the Master hides, Love eternal still abides Underneath the arching sky, And his hand through Science guides Speechless lip and sightless eye. This is our Bethsaida's pool, This our thaumaturgic school; We, O Lord, more dumb than theseâ Knowing but of bended knees And the sign of claspÃ¨d handsâ Here upon our western sands, By these broad Pacific seas, Through these stones are eloquent, And our feeble, faltering speech Gains what once the pebbles lent On the legendary beach Unto old Demosthenes. PORTALA'S CROSS Pious Portala, journeying by land, Reared high a cross upon the heathen strand, Then far away Dragged his slow caravan to Monterey. The mountains whispered to the valleys, âGood!â The sun, slow sinking in the western flood, Baptized in blood The holy standard of the Brotherhood. The timid fog crept in across the sea, Drew near, embraced it, and streamed far and free, Saying: âO ye Gentiles and Heathen, this is truly He!â All this the Heathen saw; and when once more The holy Fathers touched the lonely shoreâ Then covered o'er With shells and giftsâthe cross their witness bore. CIVIL WAR POEMS 1862â1865 A VOLUNTEER STOCKING With fingers thoroughbred, rosy and fair, She was knitting a stocking for soldiers to wear. But I thought, as through intricate loop and braid Those fingers so willfully flashed and played, Not alone did they catch in their weaving play A woolen thread nor a filament gray, But some subtler fanciesâas maidens best know Were knit in that stocking from heel to toe. Those sweet, tangled fancies, that women so long Have cherished in sorrow, oppression, and wrong; Those poetic impulses, waiting the warm Grasp of Faith but to shapen and give them a form. Thus Valor and Trust, from a chaos so full, Here mixed with the gathering meshes of wool, To be marshaled more firm, as with resolute chin And half-pouting lip she knit them all in, Till the flash of the needle's leaping light Gleamed like those lances, when knight to knight, In the olden joust of Chivalry's might (Thought I), did battle for Love and Right. So she sate, with a drooping head, Knitting,âbut not with a single thread,â Till under the long lash something grew Misty and faint as the mountain's blue, Then droppedâ Like a flash it was gone Caught and absorbed in the woven yarn, A tear,âjust to show that the stocking was done,â And Pity had finished what Trust had begun. THE CONSERVATIVE BRIDGE OF SIGHS (After Hood) Treat her with strategy, Touch her with care, Nor with rash energy Harm one so fair! Respect her sentiments, So truly eloquent, While still consistently Drips from her clothing Loyal bloodâLook at it, Loving not loathing. Make no deep scrutiny Into her mutiny; Rash and undutiful, Past all dishonor, Blight has left on her Only the beautiful. Still for these slips of hers, One of Abe's family Wipe those pale lips of hers, Spitting so clammily; Bring back her chattels, Her fond valued chattels, Where'er they may roam; Hand-cuff 'em, chain 'em, and Send 'em back home. Seek not to damage Her own institution; Tenderly put back The old Constitution. Where the lights quiver, So far down the river, For many a night, In ditches and trenchesâ McClellan's defensesâ The conflict commences, But never a fight! Best they should tarry where Dreadful malaria Racks them with pain; But let no contraband Lend them a helping hand, If you 've a care for The Union again. Perishing gloomily; Spurred by old womanly, Feeble loquacity, Weak incapacity, Gone to its rest. Still pertinacity Says it is best. Should the North rigidly Stiffen too frigidly, Decentlyâkindlyâ Smooth and compose them, And their eyes close them, Staring so blindly, Dreadfully staring Through muddy impurity, As that glance of daring, The soldier despairing, Fixed on Futurity. Thus with such strategy Still the South spare, Nor with rash energy Harm one so fair. Owning the weakness Of her institution, And saving her under The old Constitution. BANKS AND THE SLAVE GIRL [General N. P. Banks, Major-General of Volunteers, Union Army, commanded at the battle of Cedar Mountain, August 9, 1862.] Through shot and shell, one summer's day, We stood the battle's rack, With gaping files and shattered ranks Our men were falling back; When through our lines, a little child Ran down the bloody track. To know if she were bond or free We had no time to spare, Or scan with microscopic eye The texture of her hair; For lo, begrimed with battle smoke, Our men looked scarce as fair. Her name, her home, her master's claim, We could not then decide, Until our Iron Chief rode up Ere we could cheer or chide, And pointing to a howitzer, He grimly bade her âride.â First glancing down that ghastly lane, Where dead and dying lay, Then back at us, and like a flash, We saw his glances say: âThe child is free. Their batteries Have opened her the way!â Perhaps they hadâI said before We could not then decide; For we were sorely pressed that day, And driven back beside, And mayhap in our chieftain's act, Some moral then we spied. THE BATTLE AUTUMN The last high wain of toppling sheaves Goes byâthe farm gate swings to rest; The yellow harvest, and the leaves The red Fruit-Bearers' lips have pressed, Lie trophies piled on Nature's breast! But when the clouds hang dark and low, And bird and bee no longer roamâ And long before the pitying snow To bury the dead leaves shall comeâ We'll call another Harvest Home! We'll call that Harvest, last and best, The Warrior-Reaper, reaps by chance, The broken hopeâthe shattered crestâ The nerveless handâthe quenchÃ¨d glance That heap the creeping ambulance! Swing wide your gatesâthe car rolls on: O Reaper, are your spoils like these? Ah, no! when dragon's teeth are sown, The incense breath of patriot fields O'ertops the languid scents of Peace! Then still keep keen your hooks and scythe, Ye wielders of the peaceful flail, Tho' wintry storms the tree-tops writhe, And scattered leaves ride on the gale, Let not the battle harvest fail. SEMMES! [Captain Raphael Semmes, the noted commander of the Confederate privateer Alabama, on the 7th of December, 1862, captured the steamer Ariel carrying passengers for San Francisco. He allowed the vessel and passengers to proceed unharmed, but compelled the captain to sign a bond to pay two hundred and sixty thousand dollars thirty days after the independence of the Confederate Government. On December 27, the passengers of the Ariel held a meeting in San Francisco and passed a vote of thanks for Semme's gentlemanly conduct while in possession of the vessel.] Confederation Of Free spoliation With Exaltation, I sing of thee! And of thy later, Sweet Peculator, And Depredator Of every sea. When all abuse thee And dare confuse thee, I'll still excuse thee, Though law condemns Thy occupation, This plain narration Bears attestation Of thee, O Semmes! What legendary, Incendiary Accounts that vary Of thee were told; What strange tradition Of man's condition, Through inanition Shut in thy hold. Thy motions elfish, Thy conduct selfish, Like that strange shell-fish who clouds with ink; Yes, like the Cuttle, I hide thy subtle Attempts to scuttle Our ships and sink. Thy frequent dashes, Thy waxed mustaches, Their glory flashes From pole to pole! The British Nation, At every station, Sends invitation For thee to coal. With deprecation And agitation, And consternation, Lest blood be spilt, I view thy meeting, âNo courteous greetingâ Perchance a beating From Vanderbilt! Thy kind attention I duly mention, Though comprehension Doth strangely show That high-toned breeding Tho' strange exceeding, We find proceeding From men termed âLow. Then let us praise thee, And still upraise thee, Until we place thee Beyond all harm, In exaltationâ A-e-rostation And high saltation, From some yardarm. A CAVALRY SONG O, potent in patriot fields, Is the union of swiftness and force; In the uplifted steel, And the prick of the heel, And the long swinging tramp of the horse. O, the Infantry make a brave show, With the squares that no foeman dare cross; But their long files go down, When the rattling hoofs drown Their roulade with the tramp of the horse. O, the Cannoneer's lintstocks are bright, And the throats of their engines are hoarse; But their thunder is dumb When the Cavalry come, With the lightnings that leap from the horse. Then, up in the stirrup and ride! No obstacles checking our course, Till the continent's length Is filled with the strength Of the charging of Liberty's horse! THE WRATH OF McDAWDLE A CONSERVATIVE LEGEND [General George B. McClellan, in 1862, was severely criticized for his tardiness and hesitation. It was claimed that he was over-cautious, that he spent too much time in preparation, and thus gave the enemy the advantage and an opportunity to escape.] McDawdle brooked no spoiler's wrong, Famous in border raid and song, But hearing the tale of outrage told, His heart waxed hot and his eye grew cold, And said, âNow, by my ancestral hall, This day shall McDawdle's vengeance fall!â So he bade them bring him his barbÃ¨d steed, And rode from his castle gate with speed. The high portcullis he paused beside, And said, âWith me shall a Squire ride âWith a fresher lance, lest this should bend To some traitor's breastâwhich saints forfend!â So his Squire beside him armed did go, With an extra lance at his saddle-bow. But when the heavy drawbridge dropped, McDawdle tightened his rein and stopped, And said, âThose spared in the fight, I wist, With gyves should be manacled each wrist.â So they brought him gyves and again he sped While his henchmen held their breath with dread. But when he had passed the castle moat, He checked his steed, and his brow he smote, And said: âBy'r Lady, methinks 'twere well That with me should ride a priest and bell âTo shrive the souls of the men I slay, And mine own, should I fall in this deadly fray.â So they brought him a priest with a bell and book, And again the earth with his gallop shook. When he reached the spot where the caitiffs lay, Lo, the coward knaves had stolen away, Taking the spoil of his goodly land, Dreading the might of his strong right hand. 'T were well for the caitiff knaves that they Had wisely gone from McDawdle's way, Lest he fall upon them with certain death; And psalms went up from each caitiff's breath. And psalms went up from McDawdle's hall, When they saw him ride to the outer wall. And the bard made a song of McDawdle's wrath, And this is the song which that minstrel hath: âYe bold intent doth ye deed surpasse Of ye braggart childe with ee of glasse.â THE COPPERHEAD CONVENTION SACRAMENTO, JULY 8, 1863 There were footprints of blood on the soil of the Free; There were foes in the land where no foeman should be; There were fields devastated and homesteads in flame; And each loyal cheek caught the hue of its shame; War's roses sprang red where each rebel heel setâ When, lo! a convention of Democrats met! And how did they sing the brave song of their clanâ âOf rights that were equalâof freedom for man?â What epithets burned through their pitiless scorn Of âgoverning classes that masters are born?â What epithets! Listen, ye gods, to yon mouth That writhes, as it whispers, âthe glorious South!â But came they in peaceâthose meek lovers of Right, With pistols and bowie-knives tucked out of sight, With real jars of oil for the sore Commonweal That no Ali-Baba assassins concealâ Was it Peaceâor warâwhose fond mercies are such As pluck the weak straw from a drowning man's clutch? We know not their motives. The quick ebbing tide That stranded their chieftain left them at his side; As the wave that retreats from the Seventy-four Leaves the cockle-shells groping their way on the shoreâ So their knell was the boom of the welcoming gun That thundered the tidings that Vicksburg was won! SCHALK! [Emil Schalk, a resident of the United States, was born at Mayence, Germany, 1834, and educated at Paris. He wrote Summary of the Art of War, 1862, Campaigns of 1862, 1863, etc.] What do our successes balk! âWant of simple rules,â says Schalk, âDaily I am shocked to see Utter lack of strategy; While the skill that art combines (Shown in my interior lines) And success that ever dwells In all perfect parallels, Prove to me, beyond a doubt, That you 're twisted right about, And through ignorance of art, Yours is the defensive part; Or, to make my sense complete, In advancing, you retreat. Don't you seeâit 's plain as dayâ That thus far you 've run away, And your siege of New Orleans Simply was defensive means, While your Washington, my friend, You must conquer to defendâ Thus your whole campaign is naught When not logically fought!â Right and Might at times prevail, Lines and figures never fail! So if you'd your battles winâ And would properly beginâ Choose your scientific man, Fight the European plan, And to stop all further talk, Win 'em by the longest Schalk. THE YREKA SERPENT A RHYTHMICAL DIALOGUE [Yreka, July 15, 1863. Two men in coming out of their drift on Cottonwood Creek, some twenty miles from here, a few days ago, saw on the mountain-side a snake, which they say was twenty-four feet long, and as large around as a man's body. They went toward it, when it ran up the mountain. A party is now out looking for the snake.âTelegram in city papers.] STRANGER O excavator of the soil, O miner bold and free! Where is the snakeâthe fearful snakeâthat late appeared to thee? Was it a bona-fide snake, or only some untruth Exploding like that firework so popular with youth? Was it a real Ophidian, or was it simply nil, Of mania a potu bornâSerpent of the Still? Was it an Anaconda huge, or Boa of mighty strength, Or was it but an Adderâin the details of its length? Was it a Pythonâsuch an one as Pliny says for lunch Would take a Roman Phalanx down, as we take Roman punch? Or was it that more modern kind that Holmes' page displays, Whose rattle was the favored toy of âElsie'sâ baby days? What manner of a snake was it? Speak, O mysterious man! Proclaim the species of the snake that past thy tunnel ranâ Its length, its breadth, and whence it came, and whither did it flee; And if extant on Tellus yet, oh, tell us where it be! MINER O stranger in the glossy hat, and eke in store-clothes drest! Thy words a tunnel deep have picked within this flinty breast; I may not rightly call those names thou dost so deftly term, But this I knowâI never yet beheld so gross a worm! My tale begins upon a day I never can forget, The very time those Democrats in Sacramento metâ A July dayâthe heated pines their fragrant sap distilled, When tidings of a victory the hills and valleys thrilled. The mountains laughed to split their sides, the tunnels cracked their jaws; The fir trees rattled down their cones in salvos of applause; The blue-jay screamed till he was blackâwhen lo! as if in pain, A hideous serpent writhed this way from Sacramento's plain. His tail was pointed to the South, his head toward the North, As from the Sacramento's bank he wriggled slowly forth; But when upon the right and left the cheers began to break, And wider, wider spread the newsâstill faster flew the snake! He reached the mountainsâlike a dream he passed before my eyes. O stranger! then it was I knew the secret of his size, It was no single snake I saw; but by yon blessed sun! These eyes beheld two serpents joined and blended into one. Two heads this fearful reptile had; one pointed to the South; The other pointed to the North, a hissing tongue and mouth; But that which pointed to the South was like a turtledove, And dropped from time to time a text of universal love. Its Northern head three sides displayed, and on the first of these I read the legend âSlavery,â and on the second âPeace,â And on the thirdâoh, fearful sight!âthese eyes did plainly see, Deep sunken on its copper front, the capitals âJ. D.â The snake is goneâthe tale is toldâI view in thy affright, O stranger with the troubled brow! thou readst the tale aright; This serpent of protracted lengthâthis awful snake of dreadâ Was of the same convention bornâthe Fusion Copperhead. A FABLE FOR THE TIMES I lay on my back in the scented grass, Drowned in the odors that swept the plain, Watching the reaper's sickle pass Like summer lightning amidst the grain; And I said, â'T is certain that Peace is sweet, And War is cruel and useless toilâ And better the reaper of honest wheat Than the soldier laden with sanguine spoil.â But lo, as I spake, in the upper sky, I heard the tumult of mimic war, And a troop of swallows came whistling by, In chase of a hawk that flew beforeâ Till with baffled wing and beaten crest, That gray guerrilla of raid and wrong, Flew offâand back to each ransomed nest, The heroes came in exultant song. But one, as he neared me, dropped his wing With a weak, uncertain, tremulous beat, As round and round in a narrowing ring, His circuit he 'd double and then repeatâ Till at length he dropped, like lead, in the brake, And I sprang to my feet, but found, alas, He was charmed by a meditative snake That lay near me in the scented grass. THOMAS CARLYLE AND PETER OF THE NORTH The English author, Thomas Carlyle, must have his say upon the civil war in this country. It is very brief, and appears in the August number of Macmillan's Magazine. Here it is:â âILIA AMERICANA IN NUCEâ Peter of the North (to Paul of the South). ââPaul, you unaccountable scoundrel, I find you hire your servants for life, not by the month or year, as I do! You are going straight to hell, youâ!â Paul. ââGood words, Peter! The risk is my own; I am willing to take the risk. Hire your servants by the month or day, and get straight to Heaven, leave me to my own method.â Peter. ââNo, I won't. I will beat your brains out first! (And is trying dreadfully ever since, but cannot yet manage it.â) T. C. May, 1863. âPETER OF THE NORTHâ TO THOMAS CARLYLE It's true that I hire my servant per day, Per month, or per yearâas he chooses; While âPaul of the Southâ takes his bondman for life, Without asking if he refuses, T. C., Without asking if he refuses! But if you are judge of the merits alone, We surely have right to inquire The date of your service with âPaul of the South,â And what is the length of your hire, T. C., And what is the length of your hire! F. B. H. CALIFORNIA TO THE SANITARY COMMISSION WITH A DRAFT FOR âFIFTY THOUSAND,â DECEMBER, 1863 Throughout the long summer our hearts shrank in doubt, As sterile and parched as our plains with the drought, Till your voice on the wings of the winter's first rain Awoke heart and meadow to bounty again. 'T is yours in its freshnessâthe first gift that springs From the soil overarched by these merciful wings, As pure and less cold than the snowflake that flies Over fields that are crimson with War's autumn dyes. We speak not of Glory, we talk not of Fame, We gauge not our bounty to honor or blame; You ride with the battery wrapped in the dun; We creep with the ambulance steadily on. Yet stay but a moment. Our faith is the same, Though warmed in the sunshine, or tried in the flame; Would you say that we shrink, while your courage enduresâ That we offer our draft as an exchange for yours? No, perish the thought! whether sunshine or storm, Though the matrix is broken that moulded our form; When our mills shall run dry, in the stamps that remain, That Strength which bred Mercy shall conquer again! SONG OF THE âCAMANCHEâ O stranger, o'er this sunken wreck Behold no risen glory; No fragments of a battle-deck Invite the poet's story; Fame cannot write my name above With Freedom's fearless fighters; For why? this little lay of mine Belongs to Underwriters. You tell me that by Sumter's walls The monitors are swinging, And harmless from their armor falls The thunderbolts yet ringing; Yet, peaceful here in mud I lie Like any sailor drunken, Dead as a coffin-nail, or as âMy rivet-heads-die-sunken! You say the pirate's stealthy prow This way is slowly turning, From tropic seas, where even now Some luckless prize is burning. Above them gleams the Southern Cross And constellations blinking, While I beneath a Northern sky With Aquila am sinking. O, had I dropped in some deep well Of ocean vast and mighty, Old Neptune might have tolled my bell Along with Amphitrite; Or mermaids from their coral stores Have decked my turret gayly, Instead of filth your city pours From sewers round me daily. Then, stranger, rather let me hide Where river ooze still smothers, If locked in my disgrace abide Some meaner faults of others! Thou hast a paperâtell me quick The worstâthough nothing worse is; I'm libeledâin the Circuit Court, Thank God!âand not in verses. A LAY OF THE LAUNCH (After Tennyson) My heart is wasted with my woe, Camanche; In vain I strove to see the show, Camanche; Divorced from shoreâfrom libels freeâ I came to view thy charms per se; It was no maiden plunge to thee, Camanche. I did not see thee launched at all, Camanche; The crowd was largeâthe gate was small, Camanche. I stood without and cursed my fate, The time, the tide that would not wait, With others who had come too late, Camanche. Why did they send thee off so soon, Camanche? They should have waited until noon, Camanche. O cruel fate, that from my gaze Hid wedges, props, and broken stays, And made thy ways as âsecret ways,â Camanche. I was thine own invited guest, Camanche; I missed the feast, with all the rest, Camanche. I missed the cold tongue, and the flow Of eloquence and Veuve Clicquot; I missed my watch and chain, also, Camanche. For when I strove to reach thy deck, Camanche; A hand was passed around my neck, Camanche; A false, false hand my beaver pressed Upon mine eyes, and from my vest Unhooked my chainâwhy tell the rest? Camanche. My coat was tornâthe best I had, Camanche; I wished I, too, were ironclad, Camanche. They tore my coat and vest of silk, They groaned and cried, âa bilk, a bilk!â Rude boys and others of that ilk, Camanche. Thy yard was full of stumbling blocks, Camanche; That told a sudden fall in stocks, Camanche. I stood where late thy keel had slidâ I did not heed as I was bid, Hence what thy keel had done, I did, Camanche. It was a bitter, frightful fall, Camanche; I slid some thirty feet in all, Camanche. Some thirty feet upon my back I slipped along the slimy track; They cried, âAnother launchâalack!â Camanche. My heart was wasted with my woe, Camanche; I thought that I would homeward go, Camanche. In vain I hailed a crowded car; They answered not my signs afar; O day, cursed by my evil star, Camanche. THE FLAG-STAFF ON SHACKLEFORD ISLAND AN INCIDENT OF THE WAR [The following incident was related in a recent lecture by the Rev. A. L. Stone, Pastor, Park Street Church, Boston: âIn the early part of the war there stood on Shackleford Island, North Carolina, a high flag-staff from which floated the national banner. Of course, the secessionists soon tore this down. But there still surmounted the staff the national eagle. This was too loyal for the traitors, and after a time they succeeded in getting it down or breaking it off. Their work was hardly finished, when lo! the air quivered with the rush of lordly wings, and a majestic eagle swept down and lighted on the staff. In a few minutes the marksmen sent bullet after bullet at the royal mark. In vain. His piercing eye looked at them defiant; he rose, circled round a few feet, and settled again on his perch.â] Piercing the blue of a southern sky, On Shackleford Island a flagstaff rose, And a flag that flew, Loyal and true, Over the heads of disloyal foes. Fluttered the flag in the breezy air; Sullen they gazed, but did not speak, Till the flap of each fold, Like a buffet bold, Crimsoned with shame each traitor's cheek. âDown with the Abolition rag!â Was the cry their hatred found at last; And they tore it down And over the town Trailed the flag they had stripped from the mast. âDown with the Eagleâthe Yankee bird; False in one thing, false in the wholeâ; So they battered down The flag-staff's crownâ The Eagle crest of the liberty pole. Lo! as it dropped, from the upper air Came the rush of wings, and around the base Of the flag-staff played A circling shade, And the real bird swooped to the emblem's place. Vainly, below from the angry mob The curse and the rifle shot went up. Not a feather stirred Of the royal bird In his lonely perch on the flag-staff top. Since that day, on Shackleford Isle, Clothed in beauty the staff is set; Since that day The bird alway Guards the spot that is sacred yet. So, when the Nation's symbols lie Broken, we look through our despair To the sky that brings The rush of wings And the Truth that dwells in the upper air. OF ONE WHO FELL IN BATTLE (H. A. G., JUNE 3, 1864) By smoke-encumbered field and tangled lane, Down roads whose dust was laid with scarlet dew, Past guns dismounted, ragged heaps of slain, Dark moving files, and bright blades glancing through, All day the waves of battle swept the plain Up to the ramparts, where they broke and cast Thy young life quivering down, like foam before the blast. Then sank the tumult. Like an angel's wing, Soft fingers swept thy pulses. The west wind Whispered fond voices, mingling with the ring Of Sabbath bells of Peaceâsuch peace as brave men find, And only look for till the months shall bring Surcease of Wrong, and fail from out the land Bondage and shame, and Freedom's altars stand. THE HERO OF SUGAR PINE âOh, tell me, Sergeant of Battery B, Oh, hero of Sugar Pine! Some glorious deed of the battle-field, Some wonderful feat of thine. âSome skillful move, when the fearful game Of battle and life was played On yon grimy field, whose broken squares In scarlet and black are laid.â âAh, stranger, here at my gun all day, I fought till my final round Was spent, and I had but powder left, And never a shot to be found; âSo I trained my gun on a rebel piece: So true was my range and aim, A shot from his cannon entered mine And finished the load of the same!â âEnough! Oh, Sergeant of Battery B, Oh, hero of Sugar Pine! Alas! I fear that thy cannon's throat Can swallow much more than mine!â ST. VALENTINE IN CAMP We had borne the wintry sieges in our swamp-encircled camp, When a step surprised the sentry in his measured tread and tramp, And across the broad abatis swarmed the skirmishes of spring, And the ivy's scaling ladders on the scarp hung quivering; Till the bold invader's colors shook on every rocky wall, And the buds with wedding carols drowned the bugle's warning call. Then a sudden vision thrilled me, and I seemed to stand again With my hand upon the ploughshare on the far New England plain. Blithely sang the lark above me, and among the gathered kine Sang the milkmaid in the farmyard, sang the song of Valentine; Or across the distant meadow, as of old she seemed to glideâ She whose troth with mine was plighted when we wandered side by side. Where the wanton winds of summer stirred the maple's leafy crown, Or the gusty breath of Autumn shook the rugged walnuts down. But between me and my vision rise the graves upon the hill Where my comrades lie together, and the winds are hushed and still. They to whom the lark's blithe carol, and the songs of love are dead; Vain to them the white encampment of the crocus o'er their head; And my cheek is flushed with crimsonâbetter that a stranger's hand Guide the coulter in the furrow, if mine own shall wield the brand! What to me the rattling walnuts in Love's consecrated shade, Who have heard the bullets dropping in the dusky ambuscade? What to me if greenly flourish newer life within the wood, If the baby leaves are nourished in the dew of brothers' blood? Blithely lift your tuneful voices, blithely sing and merrily Chant your marriage morning pÃ¦ans, O ye birds, but not for me! Till the Nation's dreary winter shall have passed, and time shall bring Through the Autumn's smoke of battle glimpses of the Nation's Spring; Till a people's benediction mingle with the songs above, That shall hail the glad espousals of a long estrangÃ¨d love; Then a symbol of that Union shall my darling fitly wear, Hickory leaves and orange blossoms wreathed together in her hair. SCHEMMELFENNIG [General Alexander Schemmelfennig commanded the forces that first entered Charleston upon its evacuation by the Confederates in 1865.] Brave Teuton, though thy awful name Is one no common rhyme can mimic, Though in despair the trump of Fame Evades thy painful patronymicâ Though orators forego thy praise, And timid bards by tongue or pen ig- Nore theeâthus alone I raise Thy name in song, my Schemmelfennig! What though no hecatombs may swell With mangled forms thy path victorious; Though Charleston to thee bloodless fell, Wert thou less valiant or less glorious? Thou took'st tobaccoâcottonâgrainâ And slavesâthey say a hundred and ten nig- Gers were captives in thy train And swelled thy pomp, my Schemmelfennig! Let Asboth mourn his name unsung, And Schurz his still unwritten story; Let Blenker grieve the silent tongue, And Zagonyi forego his glory; Ye are but paltry farthing lamps, Your lights the fickle marsh or fen ig- Nus fatuus of Southern swamps, Beside the sun of Schemmelfennig! THE VENDUE OF JEFFERSON DAVIS THE CAUSE Of all the tyrants whose actions swell The pages of history, and tell How well they fought, and how brave they fell In battle assault or siege, pell-mell, Or blew up their foes and themselves as well, By way of a general ridding, Commend us to Jefferson D. who spread On the âouter wallâ a flag of red, And called to an auction sale instead The wretches who did his bidding. And yet, so fickle's the human mind, In fact or fiction you'll always find The popular taste is most inclined To the traitor that 's most consistent, And the standard drama declares the fact That he ought to die with his weapon hack't, Or fall on his sword in the final act, As Brutus once did in his tent. Laugh at the principle if you will, One feels a kind of indefinite thrill For the hunted pirate who cowers still O'er his magazine with an iron will And a pistol cocked and loaded, And knows that capture will bring the flash, The swift upheaval, and awful crash, The blinding smoke, and the sullen splash, But never dreamed of selling for cash, As certain people we know did; Alas! that the theory and the rash Example are both exploded. No doubt that Samson essayed to crown In some such manner his life's renown In that final act which they say brought down The house on his last appearance; Or, if further illustrations you lack, I 've been keeping the scorpion figure back, Who, girdled with fire, is never slack In effecting his mortal clearance. But there are skeptical folk who doubt If Jefferson Davis really sold out, On the eve of his final defeat and rout, Such trifles as pots and kettles; Or ever his proud soul stooped so low, While girding his loins for a final blow, To lend himself to a Yankee show, Whose very detail belittles, And call the tale a canardâas near What really is genuine and sincere As the duck of Vaucauson might appear To the one that digests its victuals. But ah! the poet, whose prophet eyes Can look through the battle-clouds that rise, Sees not the traders who sacrifice Such homely trifles as housewives prize, But a symbol of something greaterâ The selling out of a mansion built On the soil where a Nation's blood is spilt, With Fate for an auctioneer, and Guilt Close by, an amazed spectator. To such there comes a terrible awe, To think that the people who gathered saw The mighty arm of some Northern Thor Uplifting the auction hammer, And knocking down with each terrible blow Some things that the catalogue did n't show, In words that the reader will find below Mixed up with the vendor's clamor: THE SALE âGoing, gentlemen!âgoing, gone! The entire furniture, slightly worn, And the family portraits these walls adorn, Well worthy of any man'sâhanging; And some English carpets as good as new, A little down-trodden, but then they'll do If you let Grant shake 'em and put 'em through The usual beating and banging! âWho bids for a genealogical treeâ A beautiful piece of embroidery, A very first family's pedigree? What a chance for our youthful scions! Who bids? As the article 's useless now I'll takeââfive dollars!ââtoo bad, I vow! Well, put it in greenbacks! What name? eh, how? Ah, beg your pardon!ââLord Lyons!â âA family Bible I offer next, Which opens itself at a certain text About Onesimus that once vext The church as a casus belli; And all those passages stricken out Which provoke research in this age of doubt: How much?âAh, thank you?â't is yours, my stout Old CardinalâAntonelli! âNow here 's an article one might skip, But the lot goes togetherâa driver's whip, And, barring some stains on the thong and tip, It 's still in complete preservation: Who bids? where 's the man who 's afraid to speak loud? What, you, little white-coat, just back in the crowd, With the yellow mustachios and bearing so proud! Going, gone!âto the Austrian Legation! âGoing, gentlemenâgoing, gone! The household gods of a man forlorn, For the benefit of the wives that mourn, And of children's children, yet unborn, And of bonds that none shall sever; The house, and all that the house contains, The wandering ghosts and their vengeful manes, The naked walls and their blots and stains, And even the title that now obtains With an U. S. Grant forever!â IN MEMORIAM JEFFERSON DAVIS Repudiator, Speculator, Dictator; Who enjoyed the distinction of being the first And last President of the Southern Confederacy. A Christian and Chivalrous Gentleman, He starved Union Captives in his Prisons, And sanctioned the Massacre of Fort Pillow. But his manners were courtly and elegant, And his State papers models of excellence. He was remarkable for his executive wisdom: To provide material for his forces, He ordered corn to be planted instead of cotton, Which enabled Sherman to march through Georgia. He perpetuated a Slave Empire, Whose bondsmen were guides to the Union Armies. Consistent in his inconsistencies, He connived at the assassination of the only man Who could have saved him from the gallows. The incarnation of dignity and heroism, He was taken disguised in his wife's petticoats, Claiming exemption from capture On the grounds of his femininity. As such, friends, respect his weakness, And that of the few who still admire him. THE LAMENT OF THE BALLAD-WRITER Air: âJust Before the Battle, Motherâ Now the battle's over, Mother, And your tears no longer start, Really, it is my opinion You and I had better part. Farewell, Mother, if forever, Your affection I resign, Gone the days when just your blessing Brought me fifty cents a line. Farewell, O Maternal Fiction! Thou whose far-parental sigh Home has brought the youthful soldier, Time and time again to die. Farewell, Mother, you may never In the future, peaceful years, Bring a sob from private boxesâ Steep a dress-circle in tears. Farewell, O thou gentle sister! Thou, who in my cunning hand, Didst deliver pious sermons, Mild, innocuous, and bland; Never more from thee I'll borrow Moral sentiments to preach, Nor shall âmorrowâ rhyme with âsorrowâ In thy bitter parting speech. Farewell, O devoted Maiden! Thou who for the country, true, Sacrificed not only lover But thy Lindley Murray, too; Incoherent was my logic, Wild and vague thy words I fear, Yet the pit would still encore thee, And the galleries would cheer. Farewell, all ye facile phrases, Gags and sentimental cant! Names that took the place of ideasâ Sherman, Sheridan, and Grant; Gone the days when schoolboy jingles Took the place of manly talk, When the âthought that breathedâ was puffy, And the word that burnedâburnt cork. Just before the battle, Mother, Then my cheapest figure told; While the rebel stood before us, Then my glitter looked like gold. Now this âcruel war is over,â All inflated thought must fall; Mother, dear, your boy must henceforth Write sound sense, or not at all. A THANKSGIVING RETROSPECT Well! Charge your glasses!âSoftly, friends, The toast we drink to-night: âThe vacant chair,â that holds the post Of honor on our right. âThe vacant chairââwhy now so grave Your looks once bright with love? What though our circle narrows here, It widens still above. We drink to him who joins the host That left our hearth beforeâ Dear hands that once have clasped our own Shall touch his on that shore; The grandsire whose unflinching soul Went up from Concord fight, Shall welcome him whose youthful arm Last year struck home for Right! That though he lived where barren hills Were white with winter snows, Where man through stubborn toil alone To higher nature rose: He sleeps where never click of hail Or ice their changes ring, But consonants of Winter yield To open-vowels of Spring. Above him drifts the cotton-bloom Knee-deep above his grave; The shroud that veils his southern bed The north-wind never gave. His sable mourners tread a shore Enfranchised from their toilâ Thank God! (through valor such as his) Our ownâno foreign soil! Then charge your glasses full, and pour A stream as red and free As that which from his youthful veins Was poured for Liberty. To-night no sorrow drown our thanksâ To-morrow tears may fall For him who fills the vacant chair, Yet sleeps near Tybee's wall. LATER POEMS 1871â1902 CHICAGO (THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION OF OCTOBER 8â10, 1871) Blackened and bleeding, helpless, panting, prone, On the charred fragments of her shattered throne Lies she who stood but yesterday alone. Queen of the West! by some enchanter taught To lift the glory of Aladdin's court, Then lose the spell that all that wonder wrought. Like her own prairies by some chance seed sown, Like her own prairies in one brief day grown, Like her own prairies in one fierce night mown. She lifts her voice, and in her pleading call We hear the cry of Macedon to Paulâ The cry for help that makes her kin to all. But haply with wan fingers may she feel The silver cup hid in the proffered mealâ The gifts her kinship and our loves reveal. BILL MASON'S BRIDE Half an hour till train time, sir, An' a fearful dark time, too; Take a look at the switch lights, Tom, Fetch in a stick when you 're through. âOn time?â well, yes, I guess soâ Left the last station all rightâ She'll come round the curve a-flyin'; Bill Mason comes up to-night. You know Bill? No! He 's engineer, Been on the road all his lifeâ I'll never forget the mornin' He married his chuck of a wife. 'T was the summer the mill hands struckâ Just off work, every one; They kicked up a row in the village And killed old Donovan's son. Bill had n't been married mor'n an hour, Up comes a message from Kress, Orderin' Bill to go up there, And bring down the night express. He left his gal in a hurry, And went up on number one, Thinking of nothing but Mary, And the train he had to run. And Mary sat down by the window To wait for the night express; And, sir, if she had n't, 'a' done so, She 'd been a widow, I guess. For it must 'a' been nigh midnight When the mill hands left the Ridgeâ They come downâthe drunken devils!â Tore up a rail from the bridge. But Mary heard 'em a-workin' And guessed there was somethin' wrongâ And in less than fifteen minutes, Bill's train it would be along! She could n't come here to tell us: A mileâit would n't 'a' doneâ So she jest grabbed up a lantern, And made for the bridge alone. Then down came the night express, sir, And Bill was makin' her climb! But Mary held the lantern, A-swingin' it all the time. Well! by Jove! Bill saw the signal, And he stopped the night express, And he found his Mary cryin' On the track, in her weddin' dress; Cryin' an' laughin' for joy, sir, An' holdin' on to the lightâ Hello! here 's the trainâgood-bye, sir, Bill Mason 's on time to-night. DEACON JONES'S EXPERIENCE (ARKANSAS CONFERENCE) 1874 Ye're right when you lays it down, Parson, Thet the flesh is weak and a snare; And to keep yer plow in the furrowâ When yer cattle begins to rareâ Ain't no sure thing. And, between us, The same may be said of prayer. Why, I stood the jokes, on the river, Of the boys, when the critters found Thet I 'd jined the Church, and the snicker Thet, maybe ye mind, went round, The day I set down with the mourners, In the old camp-meetin' ground! I stood all that, and I reckon I might at a pinch stood moreâ For the boys, they represents Bael, And I stands as the Rock of the Law; And it seemed like a moral scrimmage, In holdin' agin their jaw. But thar 's crosses a Christian suffers, As hez n't got that pretenseâ Things with no moral purpose, Things ez hez got no sense; Things ez, somehow, no profit Will cover their first expense. Ez how! I was jest last evenin' Addressin' the Throne of Grace, And mother knelt in the corner, And each of the boys in his placeâ When that sneakin' pup of Keziah's To Jonathan's cat giv chase! I never let on to mind 'em, I never let on to hear; But driv that prayer down the furrow With the cat hidin' under my cheer, And Keziah a-whisperin', âSic her!â And mother a-sayin', âYou dare!â I asked fer a light fer the heathen, To guide on his narrer track, With that dog and that cat jest walzin', And Jonathan's face jest black, When the pup made a rush and the kittenâ Dropped down on the small of my back. Yes, I think, with the Lud's assistance, I might have continered then, If, gettin' her holt, that kitten Hed n't dropped her claws in meâwhen It somehow reached the âOld Adam,â And I jumped to my feet with âAmen.â So, ye 're right when you say it, Parson, Thet the flesh is weak and a snare; And to keep yer plow in the furrowâ When yer cattle begins to rareâ Ain't no sure thing. And, between us, I say it 's jest so with prayer. THE MAY QUEEN (ADAPTED TO A BACKWARD SEASON) If you're waking, call me early, call me early, mother dear, And see that my room is warm, mother, and the fire is burning clear; And tallow my nose once more, mother, once more ere you go away, For I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen o' the May. It froze so hard last night, mother, that really I could n't break The ice in my little pitcher, mother, till I thought the poker to take; You'll find it there on the hearth, motherâbut oh, let that hot brick stay, For I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen o' the May. I shall put on my aqua scutem outside of my sealskin coat, And two or three yards of flannel, dear, will go around my throat; And you'll see that the boneset-tea, mother, is drawn while your child 's away, For I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen o' the May. Little Effie shall go with me, if her nose is fit to be seen; And you shall be there, too, dear mother, to see me made the Queen, Provided the doctor'll let you; and, if it don't rain instead, Little Johnny is to take me a part of the way on his sled. So, if you're waking, call me early, call me early, mother dear, For to-morrow may be the chilliest day of all the glad New-Year; For to-day is the thirtieth, mother, and bless'd if your child can say If she ain't an April Fool, mother, instead of a Queen o' the May. OF WILLIAM FRANCIS BARTLETT DEAD AT PITTSFIELD, MASSACHUSETTS, 1876 O Poor Romancer,âthou whose printed page, Filled with rude speech and ruder forms of strife, Was given to heroes in whose vulgar rage No trace appears of gentler ways and life!â Thou, who wast wont of commoner clay to build Some rough Achilles or some Ajax tall; Thou, whose free brush too oft was wont to gild Some single virtue till it dazzled all;â What right hast thou beside this laureled bier Whereon all manhood liesâwhereon the wreath Of Harvard rests, the civic crown, and here The starry flag, and sword and jeweled sheath? Seest thou these hatchments? Knowest thou this blood Nourished the heroes of Colonial days;â Sent to the dim and savage-haunted wood Those sad-eyed Puritans with hymns of praise? Look round thee! Everywhere is classic ground. There Greylock rears. Beside yon silver âBowlâ Great Hawthorne dwelt, and in its mirror found Those quaint, strange shapes that filled his poet's soul. Still silent, Stranger? Thou, who now and then Touched the too credulous ear with pathos, canst not speak? Hast lost thy ready skill of tongue and pen? What, Jester! Tears upon that painted cheek? Pardon, good friends! I am not here to mar His laureled wreaths with this poor tinseled crown,â This man who taught me how 't was better far To be the poem than to write it down. I bring no lesson. Well have others preached This sword that dealt full many a gallant blow; I come once more to touch the hand that reached Its knightly gauntlet to the vanquished foe. O pale Aristocrat, that liest there, So cold, so silent! Couldst thou not in grace Have borne with us still longer, and so spare The scorn we see in that proud, placid face? âHail and farewell!â So the proud Roman cried O'er his dead hero. âHail,â but not âfarewell.â With each high thought thou walkest side by side; We feel thee, touch thee, know who wrought the spell! THE WANDERINGS OF ULYSSES AS REPORTED BY MARY JONES, MAID TO MRS. GRANT We're here, dear, and what with our glories And honor, you'll know by that sign Why we have n't met Mrs. Sartoris And I have n't written a line; Why, what with Dukes giving receptions, And going in state to Guildhall, You ain't got the faintest conceptions Of what we are doing at all! I 've just took the card of a Countess, I 've said âNot-at-homeâ to an Earl; As for Viscounts and Lords the amount is Too absurd. Why there is n't a girl In Galena who would n't be hating Your friend Mary Jones, who now writes, While behind her this moment, in waiting, Stands the gorgeousest critter in tights. He 's the valet of Viscount Fitz Doosem; He wears eppylets and all that; Has an awful nosegay in his bosom; His legs are uncommonly fat. He called our Ulysses âMy Master,â Just think of it!âbut I stopped that. He tried to be halfway familiar, But I busted the crown of his hat! We're to dine out at Windsor on Friday; We take tea with the Princess next week; Of course I shall make myself tidy And fix myself up, so to speak. âI presume I'm addressing the daughter Of America's late President?â Said a Duke to me last night; you oughter Have seen how he stammered andâwent. The fact is the âhelpâ of this city Ain't got no style, nohow; why, dear, Though I should n't say it, I pity These Grants, for they do act so queer. Why, Grant smoked and drinked with a Marshal, Like a Senator, and Missus G., Well!âthough I'm inclined to be partial, She yawned through a royal levee. Why, only last night, at a supper, He sat there so simple and still, That, had I the pen of aâTupper, I could n't express my shameâtill An Earl, he rose up and says, winking, âYou 're recalling your battles, no doubt?â Says Ulysses, âI only was thinking Of the Stanislaus and the dug-out. âAnd the scow that I ran at Knight's Ferry, And the tolls that I once used to take.â Imagine it, dear! Them 's the very Expression he used. Why, I quake As I think of itâtill a great Duchess Holds out her white hand and says âshakeâ; Or words of that meaning; for such is Them English to folks whom they take. There 's dear Mr. Pierrepont; yet think, love, In spite of his arms and his crest, And his liveriesâall he may prink, love, Don't bring him no nearer the best; For they 're tired of shamming and that thing They 've had for some eight hundred year, And really perhaps it 's a blessing These Grants are uncommonly queer. As for me, dear,âdon't let it go further,â Butâumph!âthere 's the son of a peer Who 's waiting for me till his father Shall give him a thousand a year; Tha castle we'll live in, as I know, Is the size of the White House, my dear, And you'll just tell them folks from Ohio That I think we will settle down here. THAT EBREW JEW There once was a tradesman renowned as a screw Who sold pins and needles and calicoes too, Till he built up a fortuneâthe which as it grew Just ruined small traders the whole city throughâ Yet one thing he knew, Between me and you, There was a distinction 'Twixt Christian and Jew. Till he died in his mansionâa great millionaireâ The owner of thousands; but nothing to spare For the needy and poor who from hunger might drop, And only a pittance to clerks in his shop. But left it all to A Lawyer, who knew A subtile distinction 'Twixt Ebrew and Jew. This man was no trader, but simply a friend Of this Gent who kept shop and who, nearing his end, Handed over a millionâ't was only his due, Who discovered this contrast 'twixt Ebrew and Jew. For he said, âIf you view This case as I do, There is a distinction 'Twixt Ebrew and Jew. âFor the Jew is a man who will make money through His skill, his finesse, and his capital too, And an Ebrew 's a man that we Gentiles can âdo,â So you see there 's a contrast 'twixt Ebrew and Jew. Ebrew and Jew, Jew and Ebrew, There 's a subtile distinction 'Twixt Ebrew and Jew.â So he kept up his business of needles and pins, But always one day he atoned for his sins, But never the same day (for that would n't do), That the Jew faced his God with the awful Ebrew. For this man he knew, Between me and you, There was a distinction 'Twixt Ebrew and Jew. So he sold soda-water and shut up the fount Of a druggist whose creed was the Speech on the Mount; And he trafficked in gaiters and ruined the trade Of a German whose creed was by great Luther made. But always he knew, Between me and you, A subtile distinction 'Twixt Ebrew and Jew. Then he kept a hotelâhere his trouble beganâ In a fashion unknown to his primitive plan; For the rule of this house to his manager ran, âDon't give entertainment to Israelite man.â Yet the manager knew, Between me and you, No other distinction 'Twixt Ebrew and Jew. âYou may give to John Morissey supper and wine, And Madame N. N. to your care I'll resign; You'll see that those Jenkins from Missouri Flat Are properly cared for; but recollect that Never a Jew Who 's not an Ebrew Shall take up his lodgings Here at the Grand U. âYou'll allow Miss McFlimsey her diamonds to wear; You'll permit the Van Dams at the waiters to swear; You'll allow Miss DÃ©colletÃ© to flirt on the stair; But as to an Israeliteâpray have a care; For, between me and you, Though the doctrine is new, There 's a business distinction 'Twixt Ebrew and Jew.â Now, how shall we know? Prophet, tell us, pray do, Where the line of the Hebrew fades into the Jew? Shall we keep out Disraeli and take Rothschild in? Or snub Meyerbeer and think Verdi a sin? What shall we do? O, give us a few Points to distinguish 'Twixt Ebrew and Jew. There was OneâHeaven help us!âwho died in man's place, With thorns on his forehead, but Love in his face: And when âfoxes had holesâ and birds in the air Had their nests in the trees, there was no spot to spare For this âKing of the Jews.â Did the Romans refuse This right to the Ebrews Or only to Jews? THE LEGEND OF GLEN HEAD (RELATED BY A CAUTIOUS OBSERVER) They sayâthough I know not what value to place On the strength of mere local reportâ That this was her homeâthough the tax list gives space, I observe, to no fact of the sort. But here she would sit; on that wheel spin her flax,â I here may remark that her hair Was compared to that staple,âyet as to the facts There is no witness willing to swear. Yet here she would sit, by that window reserved For her vinesâlike a âbower of bloom,â You'll remark I am quotingâthe fact I 've observed Is that plants attract flies to the room. The house and the window, the wheel and the flax Are still in their status preserved,â And yet, what conclusion to draw from these facts, I regret I have never observed. Her parents were lowly, her lover was poor; In brief it appears their sole plea For turning Fitz-William away from her door Was that he was still poorer than she. Yet why worldly wisdom was so cruel then, And perfectly proper to-day, I am quite at a loss to conceive,âbut my pen Is digressing. They drove him away. Yon bracket supported the light she would trim Each night to attract by its gleam, Moth-like, her Fitz-William, who fondly would swim To her sideâseven miles and upstream. I know not how great was the length of his limb Or how strong was her love-taper's glow; But it seems an uncommon long distance to swim And the light of a candle to show. When her parents would send her quite early to bed She would place on yon bench with great care A sandwich, instead of the crumbs that she fed, To her other wild pets that came there. One nightâthough the date is not given, in view Of the fact that no inquest was foundâ A corpse was discoveredâFitz-William's?âa few Have allegedâdrifting out on the Sound. At the news she fell speechless, and, day after day, She sank without protest or moan; Till at last, like a foam-flake, she melted awayâ So 't is said, for her grave is unknown. Twenty years from that day to the village again Came a mariner portly and gray, Who was married at Hempsteadâthe record is plain Of the justiceâon that fatal day. He hired the house, and regretted the fate Of the parties whose legend I 've told. He made some repairs,âfor 't is proper to state That the house was exceedingly old. His name was McCorkleânow, while there is naught To suggest of Fitz-William in that, You'll remember, if living, our Fitz-William ought To have grown somewhat grayer and fat. But this is conjecture. The fact still remains Of the vines and the flax as before. And knowing your weakness I 've taken some pains To present them, my love, nothing more. âKITTY HAWKâ A MARINE DIALOGUE [Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, a small settlement and signal station, was, in November, 1877, the scene of the wreck of the United States man-of-war Huron, and the loss of almost all the crew. The fact that apparently no effort was made at rescue, and the finding for many miles along the shore of the bodies stripped of all valuables, led to considerable comment.] Poet Kitty POET Where the seas worn out with chasing, at thy white feet sink embracing, thou still sittest, coldly facing, Kitty Hawk! Facing, gazing seaward ever, on each weak or strong endeavor, but in grief, or pity, never, Kitty Hawk! Eagles, sea-gulls round thee flying, land birds spent with speed and dying, even Man to thee outcrying, Kitty Hawk! All thou seest, all thou hearest, yet thou carest naught nor fearest, flesh nor fowl to thee is dearest, Kitty Hawk! Art thou human? art thou woman? art thou dead to love and to man more than all relentless, ever? Kitty Hawk! Hast thou wrongs to right, O Kitty? wrongs that move the soul to pity? tell to me thy mournful ditty, Kitty Hawk! Tell me all! how some false lover, vagrant ship-boy, sailor rover, left, bereft thee, threw thee over, Kitty Hawk! For some Antipodean savage, left thy rage the shore to ravage (with a faint idea of salvage), Kitty Hawk! How thy vague but tragic story clothes the sandy promontory, calls in accents monitory, Kitty Hawk! How thy feline appellation, in accipitrine combination, most befits a rhymed narration, Kitty Hawk! KITTY Festive tramp! around me pryingâman with hair unkempt and flyingâyouth with neck and head retractile, Like a clam. Draw within thy soft inclosure, stop this cerebral exposure, for that 's not the kind of hairpin That I am. If you're me apostrophizing, with this attitudinizing, prithee, hasten your uprising, And in time, On this beach, which is the Station's, leave some certain indentationsââfootprintsâ for some sailing brother, Who might rhyme! For my name is Jane Maria, and my father, Kezuriah, though he greatly might admire, All your talk, As one of the town officials, might prefer that his initials should appear, just as he writes themâ K. T. Hawk. MISS EDITH HELPS THINGS ALONG âMy sister'll be down in a minute, and says you're to wait, if you please, And says I might stay till she came, if I 'd promise her never to tease. Nor speak till you spoke to me first. But that 's nonsense, for how would you know What she told me to say, if I did n't? Don't you really and truly think so? âAnd then you 'd feel strange here alone! And you would n't know just where to sit; For that chair is n't strong on its legs, and we never use it a bit. We keep it to match with the sofa. But Jack says it would be like you To flop yourself right down upon it and knock out the very last screw. âS'pose you try? I won't tell. You're afraid to! Oh! you 're afraid they would think it was mean! Well, then, there 's the albumâthat 's pretty, if you 're sure that your fingers are clean. For sister says sometimes I daub it; but she only says that when she 's cross. There 's her picture. You know it? It 's like her; but she ain't as good-looking, of course! âThis is me. It 's the best of 'em all. Now, tell me, you'd never have thought That once I was little as that? It 's the only one that could be boughtâ For that was the message to Pa from the photograph man where I satâ That he would n't print off any more till he first got his money for that. âWhat? Maybe you 're tired of waiting. Why, often she 's longer than this. There 's all her back hair to do up and all of her front curls to friz. But it 's nice to be sitting here talking like grown people, just you and me. Do you think you'll be coming here often? Oh, do! But don't come like Tom Lee. âTom Lee. Her last beau. Why, my goodness! He used to be here day and night, Till the folks thought that he 'd be her husband; and Jack says that gave him a fright. You won't run away, then, as he did? for you 're not a rich man, they say. Pa says you are as poor as a church mouse. Now, are you? And how poor are they? âAin't you glad that you met me? Well, I am; for I know now your hair is n't red. But what there is left of it 's mousy, and not what that naughty Jack said. But there! I must go. Sister 's coming. But I wish I could wait, just to see If she ran up to you and she kissed you in the way that she used to kiss Lee.â THE DEAD POLITICIAN FIFTH WARD ââWho's dead?â Ye want to know Whose is this funeral showâ This A 1 corteg'? Well, it was Jim Adair, And the remains's hair Sported a short edge! âWhen a man dies like Jim, There 's no expense of him We boys are sparing. In life he hated fuss, Butâas he 's left to usâ Them plumes he 's wearing! âAll the boys here, you see, Chock full each carriage! Only one woman. Sheâ Cousin by marriage. âWho was this Jim Adair? Who? Well, you 've got me there! Reckon one of them 'air Fogy âold res'dents!â Who? Why, that corpse you see Ridin' so peacefully, Head o' this jamboreeâ 'Lected three Pres'dents! âWho was he? Ask the boys Who made the biggest noise, Rynders or Jimmy? Who, when his hat he 'd fling, Knew how the âAyesâ would ring, Oh, no! not Jimmy! âWho was he? Ask the Ward Who hed the rules aboard, All parliament'ry? Who ran the delegate, That ran the Empire State, Andâjust as sure as fateâ Ran the whole 'kentry? âWho was he? S'pose you try That chap as wipes his eye In that hack's corner. Ask himâthe only man That agin Jimmy ranâ Now his chief mourner! âWellâthat 's the last o' Jim. Yes, we was proud o' him.â OLD TIME AND NEW (Contributed to the first number of the Time Magazine, April, 1879) How well we know that figure limned On every almanac's first page, The beard unshorn, the hair untrimmed, The gaunt limbs bowed and bent with age; That well-known glass with sands run out, That scythe that he was wont to wield With shriveled arm, which made us doubt His power in Life's harvest field! Ah, him we know! But who comes here Pranked with the fashion of the town? This springald, who in jest or jeer, Tries on old Time's well-frosted crown! Vain is his paint! Youth's freshest down Through penciled wrinkles shows too soon The bright mischievous face of Clown, Beneath the mask of Pantaloon! A doubtful jest, howe'er well played, To mock the show of fleeting breath With youth's light laugh, and masquerade This gaunt stepbrother of grim Death! Is this a moralist to teach The equal fate of small and large? Peace! Yetâone momentâyield him speech Before we give the scamp in charge! âI crave no grace from those who dream Time only was, and from the past Still draw the wisdom that they deem Will only live and only last. Time is not old, as all who 've tried To kill or cheat him must attest; And outward symbols cannot hide The same firm pulse that stirs your breast. âThe old stock properties you preach To truer symbols must pay tithe; M'Cormick's reapers better teach My truths than your old-fashioned scythe. The racing âTimer'sâ slender vane That marks the quarter seconds pass, Marks, too, its moral quite as plain As e'er was drawn in sand through glass. âSo if I bring in comelier dress And newer methods, things less new, I claim that honored name still less To be consistent than be true. If mine be not the face that 's cast In every almanac and rhyme, Look through themâall that there will last You 'll find within these leaves of âTime!ââ UNDER THE GUNS Under the guns of the Fort on the Hill Daisies are blossoming, buttercups fill; Up the gray ramparts the scaling vine flings High its green ladders, and falters and clings Under the guns, Under the guns, Under the guns of the Fort on the Hill. Under the guns of the Fort on the Hill Once shook the earth with the cannonade's thrill, Once trod these buttercups feet that, now still, Lie all at rest in their trench by the mill. Under the guns, Under the guns, Under the guns of the Fort on the Hill. Under the guns of the Fort on the Hill Equal the rain falls on good and on ill. Soft lies the sunshine, still the brook runs, Still toils the Husbandmanâunder the guns, Under the guns, Under the guns, Under the guns of the Fort on the Hill. Under the guns of Thy Fort on the Hill Lord! in Thy mercy we wait on Thy will; Lord! is it War that Thy wisdom best knows, Lord! is it Peace, that Thy goodness still shows, Under the guns, Under the guns, Under the guns of Thy Fort on the Hill? COMPENSATION The Poet sings on the plain, The Trader toils in the mart, One envies the other's gain, One stares at the other's art. Yet each one reaches his goal, And the Critic sneers as they pass, And each of the three in his soul Believes the other an ass. OUR LAUREATE (Contributed to the Holmes number of the Critic, issued on the twenty-ninth of August, 1884âthe seventy-fifth anniversary of the birth of Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes.) One day from groves of pine and palm, The poets of the sky and cover Had come to greet with song and psalm The whip-poor-willâtheir woodland lover. All sang their best, but one clear note That fairly voiced their admiration Was hisâwho only sang by roteâ The mock-bird's modest imitation. So we, who 'd praise the bard who most Is poet of each high occasion, Who 'd laud our laureate, and toast The blithe Toast-Master of the Nation,â To celebrate his fÃªte to-day, In vain each bard his praise rehearses: The best that we can sing or say Is but an echo of his verses. SCOTCH LINES TO A. S. B. (FROM AN UNINTELLIGENT FOREIGNER) We twa hae heard the gowans sing, Sae saft and dour, sae fresh and gey; And paidlet in the brae, in Spring, To scent the new-mown âScots wha hae.â But maist we loo'ed at e'en to chase The pibroch through each wynd and close, Or climb the burn to greet an' face The skeendhus gangin' wi' their Joes. How aft we saidâEh, Sirs!â and âMon!â Likewise âWhatefferââapropos Of nothing. And pinned faith upon âAiblinsââthough why we didna know. We 've heard nae mon say âgowdâ for âgold,â And yet wi' all our tongues up-curled, Weâlike the British drum-beatârolled Our âR'sâ round all the speaking worruld. How like true Scots we didna care A bawbee for the present tense, But said âwe will beâ when we were, 'T was bonnyâbut it wasna sense. And yet, âma frienâ and âtrusty frere,â We'll take a right gude âWillie Waughtâ (Tho' what that may be is not clear, Nor where it can be made or bought). THE ENOCH OF CALAVERAS Well, dog my cats! Say, stranger, You must have traveled far! Just flood your lower level And light a fresh cigar. Don't tell me in this weather, You hoofed it all the way? Well, slice my liver lengthways! Why, stranger, what 's to pay? Huntin' yer wife, you tell me; Well, now, dog-gone my skin! She thought you dead and buried, And then bestowed her fin Upon another fellow! Just put it there, old pard! Some fellows strike the soft things, But you have hit it hard. I'm right onto your feelin's, I know how it would be, If my own shrub slopped over And got away from me. Say, stranger, that old sage hen, That 's cookin' thar inside, Is warranted the finest wool, And just a square yard wide. I would n't hurt yer, pardner, But I tell you, no man Was ever blessed as I am With that old pelican. It 's goin' on some two year Since she was j'ined to me, She was a widder prior, Her name was Sophy Leeâ Good God! old man, what's happened? Her? She? Is that the one? That 's her? Your wife, you tell me? Now reach down for yer gun. I never injured no man, And no man me, but squealed, And any one who takes her Must do it d?d well heeled! Listen? Surely. Certainly I'll let you look at her. Peek through the door, she 's in thar, Is that your furnitur'? Speak, man, quick! You 're mistaken! No! Yours! You recognize My wife, your wife, the same one? The man who says so, lies! Don't mind what I say, pardner, I'm not much on the gush, But the thing comes down on me Like fours upon a flush. If that 's your wifeâholdâsteady! That bottle, now my coat, She'll think me dead as you were. My pipe. Thar. I'm afloat. But let me leave a message. No; tell her that I died: No, no; not that way, either, Just tell her that I cried. It don't rain much. Now, pardner, Be to her what I 've been, Or, by the God that hates you, You'll see me back again! âFREE SILVER AT ANGEL'Sâ I reside at Table Mountain, and my name is Truthful James, I have told the tale of âWilliamâ and of âAh Sin'sâ sinful games; I have yarned of âOur Society,â and certain gents I know, Yet my words were plain and simple, and I never yet was low. Thar is high-toned gents, ink-slingers; thar is folks as will allow Ye can't reel off a story onless they 've taught ye how; Till they get the word they're wantin', they're allus cryin' âWhoa!â All the while their mule is pullin' (that 's their âPegasus,â you know). We ain't built that way at Angel'sâbut why pursue this theme? When things is whirling round us in a wild delusive dream; When âfadsâ on âbikesâ go scorchin' downâto t'other place you know (For I speak in simple languageâand I never yet was low). It was rainin' up at Angel'sâwe war sittin' round the bar, Discussin' of âFree Silverâ that was âgoing soon to par,â And Ah Sin stood thar a-listenin' like a simple guileless child, That hears the Angels singin'âso dreamy like he smiled. But we knew while he was standin' tharâof all that heathen heard And sawâhe never understood a single blessed word; Till Brown of Calaveras, who had waltzed up on his bike, Sez: âWhat is your opinion, John, that this Free Silver 's like?â But Ah Sin said, âNo shabbee,â in his childish, simple way, And Brown he tipped a wink at us and then he had his say: He demonstrated then and thar how silver was as good As goldâif folks war n't blasted fools, and only understood! He showed how we âwere crucified upon a cross of goldâ By millionaires, and banged his fist, until our blood ran cold. He was a most convincin' manâwas Brown in all his ways, And his skill with a revolver, folks had oft remarked with praise. He showed us how the ratio should be as âsixteen to one,â And he sorted out some dollarsâwhile the boys enjoyed the funâ And laid them on the counterâand heaped 'em in a pile, While Ah Sin, he drew nearer with his happy, pensive smile. âThe heathen in his blindness bows down to wood and stone,â Said Brown, âbut this poor heathen won't bow to gold alone; So speak, my poor Mongolian, and show us your idee Of what we call âFree Silverâ and what is meant by âFree.ââ Swift was the smile that stole across that heathen's face! I grieve That swifter was the hand that swept those dollars up his sleeve. âMe shabbee âSilvelâ allee same as Mellican man,â says he; âMe shabbee âFleeâ means âB'longs to none,â so Chinaman catch he!â Now, childlike as his logic was, it did n't justify The way the whole crowd went for him without a reason why; And the language Brown made use of I shall not attempt to show, For my words are plain and simpleâand I never yet was low. Then Abner Dean called âOrder!â and he said âthat it would seem The gentleman from China's deductions were extreme; I move that we should teach him, in a manner that shall strike, The âbi-metallic balanceâ on Mr. Brown's new bike!â Now Dean was scientific,âbut was sinful, too, and gay,â And I hold it most improper for a gent to act that way, And having muddled Ah Sin's brains with that same silver craze, To set him on a bicycleâand he not know its ways They set him on and set him off; it surely seemed a sin To see him waltz from left to right, and wobble out an in, Till his pigtail caught within the wheel and wound up round its rim, And that bicycle got up and rearedâand then crawled over him. âMy poor Mongolian friend,â said Dean, âit 's plain that in your case Your centre point of gravity don't fall within your base. We'll tie the silver in a bag and hang it from your queue, And thenâby scientific lawâyou'll keep your balance true!â They tied that silver to his queue, and it hung down behind, But always straight, no matter which the side Ah Sin inclinedâ For though a sinful sort of manâand lightsome, too, I weenâ He was no slouch in Scienceâwas Mister Abner Dean! And here I would remark how vain are all deceitful tricks,â The boomerang we throw comes back to give us its last licks,â And that same weight on Ah Sin's queue set him up straight and plumb, And he scooted past us down the grade and left us cold and dumb! âCome back! Come back!â we called at last. We heard a shriek of glee, And something sounding strangely like âAll litee! Silvel 's flee!â And saw his feet tucked on the wheelâthe bike go all alone! And break the biggest record Angel's Camp had ever known! He raised the hill without a spill, and still his speed maintained, For why?âhe traveled on the sheer momentum he had gained, And vanished like a meteorâwith his queue stretched in the gale, Or I might say a Cometâtakin' in that silver tail! But not again we saw his faceânor Brown his âSilver Freeâ! And I marvel in my simple mind howe'er these things can be! But I do not reproduce the speech of Brown who saw him go, For my words are pure and simpleâand I never yet was low! âHASTA MAÃANAâ When all's in bud, and the leaf still unfolding, When there are ruby points still on the spray, When that prim school gown your charms are withholding, Then, Manuela, child, well may you say: âHasta MaÃ±ana! Hasta MaÃ±ana! Until to-morrowâamigo, alway.â When, Manuela, white, crimson, and yellow, Peep through green sepals the roses of May, And through black laces the bloom of your face is Fresh as those roses, child, still you may say: Through your mantillaâcoy Manuela! âHasta MaÃ±ana, amigo, alway.â When all 's in bloom, and the rose in its passion Warmed on your bosom would never say nay, Still it is wiseâin your own country fashionâ Under your opening fan, only to say: âHasta MaÃ±ana! Hasta MaÃ±ana! Until to-morrow, amigo, alway.â When all is gray and the roses are scattered, Hearts may have broken that brook no delay, Yet will to-morrow, surcease of sorrow Bring unto eyes and lips that still can say: âHasta MaÃ±ana! Hasta MaÃ±ana! Until to-morrow is best for to-day!â Phrase of Castilian lands! Speech, that in languor Softly procrastinates, for âayeâ or ânay,â From Seville's orange groves to remote Yanguea, Best heard on rosy lipsâlet thy words say: âHasta MaÃ±ana! Hasta MaÃ±ana! Until to-morrow, amigo, alway!â LINES TO A PORTRAIT, BY A SUPERIOR PERSON When I bought you for a song, Years agoâLord knows how long!â I was struckâI may be wrongâ By your features, Andâa something in your air That I could n't quite compare To my other plain or fair Fellow-creatures. In your simple, oval frame You were not well known to fame, But to meâ't was all the sameâ Whoe'er drew you; For your face I can't forget, Though I oftentimes regret That, somehow, I never yet Saw quite through you. Yet each morning, when I rise, I go first to greet your eyes; And, in turn, you scrutinize My presentment. And when shades of evening fall, As you hang upon my wall, You 're the last thing I recall With contentment. It is weakness, yet I know That I never turned to go Anywhere, for weal or woe, But I lingered For one parting, thrilling flash From your eyes, to give that dash To the curl of my mustache, That I fingered. If to some you may seem plain, And when people glance again Where you hang, their lips refrain From confession; Yet they turn in stealth aside, And I note, they try to hide How much they are satisfied In expression. Other faces I have seen; Other forms have come between; Other things I have, I ween, Done and dared for! But our ties they cannot sever, And, though I should say it never, You 're the only one I ever Really cared for! And you'll still be hanging there When we 're both the worse for wear, And the silver 's on my hair And off your backing; Yet my faith shall never pass In my dear old shaving-glass, Till my face and yours, alas! Both are lacking! THE BIRDS OF CIRENCESTER Did I ever tell you, my dears, the way That the birds of CisseterââCisseter!â eh? Well âCiren-cesterââone ought to say, From âCastra,â or âCaster,â As your Latin master. Will further explain to you some day; Though even the wisest err, And Shakespeare writes âCi-cester,â While every visitor Who does n't say âCisseterâ Is in âCiren-cesterâ considered astray. A hundred miles from London townâ Where the river goes curving and broadening down From tree-top to spire, and spire to mast, Till it tumbles outright in the Channel at lastâ A hundred miles from that flat foreshore That the Danes and the Northmen haunt no moreâ There 's a little cup in the Cotswold Hills Which a spring in a meadow bubbles and fills, Spanned by a heron's wingâcrossed by a strideâ Calm and untroubled by dreams of pride, Guiltless of fame or ambition's aims, That is the source of the lordly Thames! Remark here again that custom condemns Both âThamesâ and Thamisâyou must say âTemsâ! But why? no matter!âfrom them you can see Cirencester's tall spires loom up o'er the lea. A. D. Five Hundred and Fifty-two, The Saxon invadersâa terrible crewâ Had forced the lines of the Britons through; And Cirencesterâhalf mud and thatch, Dry and crisp as a tinder match, Was fiercely beleaguered by foes, who 'd catch At any device that could harry and rout The folk that so boldly were holding out. For the streets of the townâas you'll see to-dayâ Were twisted and curved in a curious way That kept the invaders still at bay; And the longest bolt that a Saxon drew Was stopped, ere a dozen of yards it flew, By a turn in the street, and a law so true That even these robbersâof all laws scorners!â Knew you could n't shoot arrows around street corners. So they sat them down on a little knoll, And each man scratched his Saxon poll, And stared at the sky, where, clear and high, The birds of that summer went singing by, As if, in his glee, each motley jester Were mocking the foes of Cirencester, Till the jeering crow and the saucy linnet Seemed all to be saying: âAh! you 're not in it!â High o'er their heads the mavis flew, And the âouzel-cock so black of hueâ; And the âthrostle,â with his ânote so trueâ (You remember what Shakespeare saysâhe knew); And the soaring lark, that kept dropping through Like a bucket spilling in wells of blue; And the merlinâseen on heraldic panesâ With legs as vague as the Queen of Spain's; And the dashing swift that would ricochet From the tufts of grasses before them, yetâ Like bold AntÃ¦usâwould each time bring New life from the earth, barely touched by his wing; And the swallow and martlet that always knew The straightest way home. Here a Saxon churl drew His breathâtapped his foreheadâan idea had got through! So they brought them some nets, which straightway they filled With the swallows and martletsâthe sweet birds who build In the houses of manâall that innocent guild Who sing at their labor on eaves and in thatchâ And they stuck on their feathers a rude lighted match Made of resin and tow. Then they let them all go To be free! As a childlike diversion? Ah, no! To work Cirencester's red ruin and woe. For straight to each nest they flew, in wild quest Of their homes and their fledglingsâthat they loved the best; And straighter than arrow of Saxon e'er sped They shot o'er the curving streets, high overhead, Bringing fire and terror to roof-tree and bed, Till the town broke in flame, wherever they came, To the Briton's red ruinâthe Saxon's red shame! Yet they 're all gone together! To-day you'll dig up From âmoundâ or from âbarrowâ some arrow or cup. Their fame is forgottenâtheir story is endedâ 'Neath the feet of the race they have mixed with and blended. But the birds are unchangedâthe ouzel-cock sings, Still gold on his crest and still black on his wings; And the lark chants on high, as he mounts to the sky, Still brown in his coat and still dim in his eye; While the swallow or martlet is still a free nester In the eaves and the roofs of thrice-built Cirencester. TRUTHFUL JAMES AND THE KLONDIKER We woz sittin' freeâlike ez you and meâin our camp on the Stanislow, Round a roarin' fire of bresh and brier, stirred up by a pitch-pine bough, And Jones of Yolo had finished his solo on Bilson's prospectin' pan, And we all woz gay until Jefferson Clay kem in with a Klondike man. Now I most despise low language and lies, as I used to remark to Nye, But the soul of Truthâthough he was but a youthâlooked out of that stranger's eye, And the things he said I had frequent read in the papers down on âthe Bay,â And the words he choosed woz the kind wot 's used in the best theayter play. He talked of snows, and of whiskey wot froze in the solidest kind of chunk, Which it took just a pound to go fairly around when the boys had a first-class drunk, And of pork that was drilled and with dynamite filled before it would yield to a blow, For things will be strange when thermometers range to sixty degrees below. How they made soup of bootsâwhich the oldest best suitsâand a âfryâ from a dancin' shoe, How in Yukon Valley a corpse de bally might get up a fine âmenoo.â But their regular fare when they'd nothin' to spare and had finished their final mule Was the harness leather which with hides went together, though the last did n't count ez a rule. Now all this seemed true, and quite nateral, too, and then he spoke of the gold, And we all sot up, and refilled his cup, and this is the yarn he told: There was gold in heapsâbut it 's there it keeps, and will keep till the Judgment Day, For it's very rare that a man gets thereâand the man that is there must stay! It's a thousand miles by them Russian isles till you come onto âFort Get Thereâ (Which the same you are not if you'll look at the spot on the mapâthat of gold is bare); Then a river begins that the Amazon skins and the big Mississippi knocks out, For it's seventy miles 'cross its mouth when it smiles, andâyou 've only begun your route. Here Bilson arose with a keerless-like pose and he gazed on that Klondike youth, And he says: âFair sir, do not think I infer that your words are not words of truth, But I 'd simply ask whyâsince that all men must dieâyour sperrit is wanderin' here When at Dawson Cityâthe more's the pityâyou 've been frozen up nigh a year.â âYou need not care, for I never was there,â said that simple Klondike man. âI'm a company floater and business promoter, and this is my little plan: I show you the dangers to which you are strangers, and now for a sum you'll learn What price you expect usâas per this Prospectusâto insure your safe return.â Then Bilson stared, and he almost r'ared, but he spoke in a calm-like tone: âYou'll excuse me for sayin' you 're rather delayin' your chance to insure your own! For we're way worn and weary, your style isn't cheery, we 've had quite enough of your game.â Butâwhat did affect usâhe took that Prospectus and chucked it right into the flame! Then our roarin' fire of bresh and brier flashed up on the Stanislow, And Jefferson Clay went softly away with that youth with a downcast brow, And Jones of Yolo repeated his solo on that still, calm evening air, And we thought with a shiver of Yukon River and the fort that was called âGet There!â UNCLE JUBA âDar was a man in Florida, dey called him âUncle Ju,â De doctor found him proof agin all fevers dat dey knew; De cholera bacillus he would brush away like flies, And yaller fever microbes he would simply jess despise. For he was such a bery seasoned nigger Froo and frooâall froo, Jess de acclimated, vaccinated figger To doâto do. When de sojer boys came marching, dey would shout, âLordy! Here 's de man for Cubaâtrot him out. For even if he cannot pull a trigger Just like youâlike you, He 's a seasoned and an acclimated figure, Dat will doâwill do.â âDe proudest man in Florida dat day was âUncle Ju,â When dey marched him off to Cuba wid de odder boys in blue; He had a brand-new uniform, a red cross on his arm, He said, âDon't mind me, darkies, I can't come to any harm, For de surgeon dat inspected of my figger When on viewâon view, Sez I'm just de kind of acclimated nigger Dat 'ud doâwould do.

THE SWORD OF DON JOSÃ (TOLD AT THE MISSION OF SAN LUIS REY, 1860) Aye, look, there it hangs! You would think 'twas a cross Fairly wrought of old iron. Yet, barring the loss Of some twisted work here that once guarded the hand, You might say 't was the hilt of some cavalier's brand; As it is, of a truth! You are staring, SeÃ±or! At this shrine, at this altar, where never before Hung ex voto so strange; at these walls in decay, All that stands of the Mission of San Luis Rey; At these leagues of wild llano beyond, which still hoard In their heart this poor shrine, and a cavalier's sword! Yes! It hangs there to praise Holy Church and the spell She once broke in her power and glory; as well As that tough blade she snapped in its vengeance, just whenâ But here isâDon Pancho!âa tale for your pen! You accept. Then observe on the blade near its haft The world-renowned stamp of that chief of his craft In Toledo, Sebastian Hernandez. The date You will note: sixteen hundred and seventy-eight! That 's the year, so 't is said, when this story begins And he fashioned that blade for our sorrows and sins. From a baldric of Cordovan leather and steel It trailed in its prime, at the insolent heel Of Don JosÃ© Ramirez, a Toledan knight, Poor in all, so 't was said, but a stomach for fight. And that blade, like himself, was so eager and keen It would glide through a corselet and all else between; And so supple 't would double from point to the hilt, Yet pierce a cuirass like a lance in full tilt; Till 'twixt Master and Sword, there was scarcely a day That both were not drawn in some quarrel or fray. Then Ruy Mendoza, a grandee of Spain, Castellan of Toledo, was called to maintain That such blades should be parted, but JosÃ© replied, âCome and try it!ââwhile Ruy let fall, on his side Certain sneers which too free a translation might mar, Such as âHo! Espadachin!â and âFanfarronear!â Till Don JosÃ© burst out that âthe whole race abhorred,â The line of Mendoza's should âfall by his sword.â The oath of a braggart, you 'd say? Well, in truth, So it seemed, for that oath wrought Ramirez but ruth; And spite of the lightnings that leaped from his blade, Here and there, everywhere, never point yet he made; While the sword of Mendoza, pressing closely but true, At the third and fourth pass ran the challenger through, And he fell. But they say as the proud victor grasped The sword of Ramirez, the dying man gasped, And his white lips repeated the words of his boast: âYeâshallâfallâbyâmyâsword,â as he gave up the ghost. âRetribution?â Quien sabe? The tale 's not yet done. For a twelvemonth scarce passed since that victory won And the sword of Don JosÃ© hung up in the hall Of Mendoza's own castle, a lesson for all Who love brawls to consider, when one summer noon Don Ruy came home just an hour too soon, As some husbands will do when their wives prove untrue, And discovered his own with a lover, who flew From her bower through passage and hall in dismay, With the Don in pursuit, but at last stood at bay In the hall, where they closed in a deadly affray. But here, runs the tale, when the lover's bright blade, Engaging Don Ruy's, showed out âin parade,â The latter drew back with a cry and a start Which threw up his guard, and straightway through his heart Passed the sword of his rival. He fell, but they say He pointed one hand, as his soul was set free, To the blade, and gasped out: â'T is his sword! Ay de mi!â And 't was true! For the lover, unarmed in his flight, Caught up the first weapon that chanced to his sightâ The sword on the wall, JosÃ©'s own fateful brand, Not knowing the curse to be wrought by his hand. So the first victim fell! When Don Luis, the heir Of the luckless Don Ruy, in haste summoned there, Heard the tale, he commanded the sword which had wrought Such mischance to his race to be instantly brought, And in presence of all smote the blade such a blow 'Cross the mail of his knee as should snap it; but, no; For that well-tempered steel, from its point to its heel, Was so supple, it bent in an arc like a wheel, And recoiling, glanced up, to the horror of all, Through the throat of the heir, in his dead father's hall! Next of kin was a soldier, Ramon, who maintained That by boldness alone was security gained, And the curse would be naught to the man who dared trip Through the rest of his life with that sword on his hip, As he should. But, what would you? when he took the field, His troop was surrounded; himself made to yield And deliver his sword! You can fancy the rest When you think of the curse. By the foe sorely pressed In a fight, when released, he fell by that brand Of the Spanish JosÃ©, in some strange Flemish hand! Then the sword disappeared, and with it, it seemed, The race of Mendoza. No man ever dreamed Of a curse lying perdu for centuries; when, Some time in the year eighteen hundred and ten, There died at the Pueblo of San Luis Rey Comandante Mendoza, descended, they say, From those proud hidalgos who brought in their hands No sword, but the cross, to these far heathen lands, And he left but one son, Agustin, to alone Bear the curse of his race (though to him all unknown); A studious youth, quite devout from a child, With no trace of that sin his ancestors defiled. You know the Pueblo? On its outskirts there stood The casa new-built of El Capitan Wood An American trader, who brought from the seas Much wealth and the power to live at his ease. And his casa was filled with the spoils of all climes He had known; silks and china, rare goods of all times. But notably first, 'midst queer idols and charms, Was a rare and historical trophy of arms; And supreme over all, hung the prize of that hoard, An antique and genuine Toledan sword. He had, too, a son, who was playmate and friend To Agustin. Together, their joy was to spend In this house of rare treasures their hours of play; And here it so chanced that an unlucky day The son of the host in adventurous zeal Climbed the wall to examine that queer-looking steel While Agustin looked on. A misstep! A wild cry! And a clutch that tore loose that queer weapon on high, And they both hurtled down on Agustin beneath With his uplifted arms, and his breast a mere sheath For the blade! When, thank God! (and all glory and praise To our blessed San Luis, whose shrine here we raise!) Its point struck the cross ever hung at his neck And shivered like glass! a miraculous wreck! Without splinter or fragment save this near the hilt, And of innocent blood not a drop ever spilt! There 's the tale! Yet not all! though that cross broke the spell It ended the race of Mendoza as well, For that youth was the last of his name! You ask, âHow? Died he too?â Nay, Don Pancho,âhe speaks with you now,â Spared that curse as âAgustin,â his young life he laid, With his vows, on this altar, as âBrother Merced.â And this cross on my breast with this dent, as you see, Hangs but where it hung when that spell was set free!
