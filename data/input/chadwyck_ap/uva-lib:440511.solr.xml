      <field name="fulltext">INDIAN LAMENTS. I. GEEHALE: AN INDIAN LAMENT. The blackbird is singing on Michigan's shore, As sweetly and gaily as ever before, For he knows to his mate he at pleasure can hie, And the dear little brood she is teaching to fly. The sun looks as ruddy, and rises as bright, And reflects o'er our mountains as beamy a light, As it ever reflected, or ever express'd, When my skies were the bluestâmy dreams were the best. The fox and the panther, both beasts of the night, Retire to their dens on the gleaming of light, And they spring with a free and a sorrowless track, For they know that their mates are expecting them back. Each bird and each beast, it is blest in degree, All nature is cheerfulâall happy but me. I will go to my tent, and lie down in despair, I will paint me with black and will sever my hair:â I will sit on the shore where the hurricane blows, And reveal to the god of the tempest my woes:â I will weep for a season, on bitterness fed, For my kindred are gone to the hills of the dead; But they died not by hunger, or ling'ring decay, The steel of the white man hath swept them away. This snake skin, that once I so sacredly wore, I will toss with disdain on the storm-beaten shore, Its charms I no longer obey or invoke, Its spirit hath left me, its spell is now broke. I will raise up my voice to the source of the light, I will dream on the wings of the blue-bird at night, I will speak to the spirits that whisper in leaves, And that minister balm to the bosom that grieves, And will take a new manitoâsuch as shall seem To be kind and propitious in every dream. Oh, then, I shall banish these cankering sighs, And tears shall no longer gush salt from my eyes. I shall wash from my face every peace-colour'd stain, Red, red! shall alone on my visage remain. I will dig up my hatchet and bend my oak bow, By night and by day, I will follow the foe; No lake shall repress meâno mountain oppose, His blood can alone give my spirit repose. They came to my cabin when heaven was black, I heard not their comingâI knew not their track, But I saw by the light of their blazing fusees, They were people engender'd beyond the big seas. My wife and my childrenâoh spare me the tale,â But who is there left, that is kin to Geehale? II. ALGONAC: ON HEARING THE REVEILLE AT THE POST OF ST. MARY'S. From dreams short and broken, prophetic and high, I wake in my cabin to ponder and sigh; I think on the days when, transcendently blest, My forefathers revelled the lords of the west; And fired by ambition or valour severe, They wing'd the dread arrow, or brandish'd the spear. I think how their wisdom, their skill, and their might, Prevail'd in the council, the chase, and the fight; And I sigh to reflect, all deprest and o'ercast, Those ages have vanished, those glories are past. But hark! from yon battlements bristled with steel, What sounds o'er these woodlands so heavily peal? Now rolling, re-doubling, concussive and clear, Now striking in sharp, thrilling notes on the ear; 'Tis the signal of day for the soldier: to him There's a joy in the music no tears ever dim; It speaks to his feelings, his habits, his pride, More keenly than all human language beside. But meâfar, far diff'rent sensations oppress, It strikes on my ear like the note of distress. Ah! how can those sounds please my kindred or me, That remind me my nation no longer is free? My fancy reverts to the moments so bland, When my own native music prevail'd in the land, And my fathers danced blithe on the oak-cover'd hill, Far, far from the white man and all his proud skill. Day breaks in the east, but its glimmer no more Lights hope in our bosoms, or joy on our shore. Ah! why should its beams more illumine the cot, Where the war-song is mute, and the war-dance forgot; Where the bow and the arrow, the spear and the mace, Are no more crown'd with spoils of the war and the chace? Ah! why should not heaven, kind heaven resume Its primitive darkness and shroud me in gloom? Oh! fly, ye bright streaks that bedapple the morn. Nor shine on a mortal so sunk and forlorn. The beauties of day I no longer can see, Nightâmidnight alone, is congenial to me. Ye birds, cease your warblings, my heart cannot bear The charms that once thrill'd it, when fortune was fair, And rous'd to the battle, on call'd to the chace, I rov'd unconfin'd through the regions of space; Track'd the deer to his covert, the wolf to his den, Or mix'd in the fight with the bravest of men. Oh! teach me, ye wise men, who broadly survey The causes that hasten my nation's decay; Come teach me to smile on the beauties that lie In the bright vernal landscapeâthe red evening sky. While goaded by wantâby misfortune opprest, The scorpion, slavery, is gnawing my breast. Wabishkizzi The White Man. may smileâWabishkizzi may say, I will teach you to read ... I will teach you to pray. But say, when our arts, manners, customs are lost, What then shall we cherish ... what then shall we boast? When the war-flag is struck, and the war-drum is still, And the council-fire glimmers no more on the hill, Can we feel any pride, but our forefathers' pride, To live as they lived, and to die as they died? They tell me, that blessings for me are in store, The sage's ... saint's ... poet's ... philosopher's lore; The comforts that labour and science bestow, The loom and the compass, the sickle and plough! But, ah! can they tell me where joy can abide, Without national customs, or national pride? And here my grief presses ... these ramparts so high, White, white as the summer-cloud floats in the sky, These walls but remind me how cruelly cast My own native woods are encompass'd at last. In vain 'tis averr'd , with no hostile design, That in guarding their country, they tranquilize mineâ That they feed and they clothe, as the bleak season shifts, (What noble soul e'er wish'd to live upon gifts!) But whenever I look on those cannon-pierc'd walls, A fearful sensation my bosom appals! Whenever I see, on these once happy grounds, The sentinel pacing his limited rounds; Or borne down the stream, with the evening's low hum, I hear the loud notes of the deep rolling drum; I start from my visionsâI cannot but see, My nation! my nation! no longer is free; That all this long muster of cannon and steel. Though prudence may sanction, deny, or conceal, But gleams o'er the war-path that leads to the grave, Their object to conquer, destroy, or enslave. Thus, rous'd from his slumbers, proud Algonac sung, A wild, native melody dwelt on his tongue; Then he drew up his robe, and reclin'd on the plain, He courted his dreams and his slumbers again. III. THE INDIAN'S FAREWELL TO THE OHIO VALLEY. Adieu to the valleyâadieu to the glen, Where I rov'd in my youth with the bravest of men, The stream and the forest, the path and the shore, Where so oft I have stray'd, but shall wander no more. Loved scenes of my childhoodâloved haunts of my age, Whose sweets could delight me, whose beauties assuage, Ye fade in the distanceâye pass from my view, As mournfully turning, I bid you adieu. The leaves on your forests, so stately and tall, Are turning their hues as they wither and fall; And borne by the winds of the brisk autumn sky, Sere, scattered, and dead o'er the valley they fly. Like these are my peopleâlike these they erst sprung Green, vigorous, blooming, and healthy, and young. But, ah! e'er their pride of maturity came, By chill and bleak winter blasts spoil'd of their fame; Cut down in their greenness, all wild as they rov'd, Ere their minds were expanded, or manners improv'd And now like the autumn-brown foliage dry, Swept off from their nativeâtheir once happy sky. Still press'd by a force, we may vainly deplore, And ne'er, lovely vale, shall I visit you more. Ah! bitter 's the thought when I cast in review The cot and the stream where my breath I first drew, The bank where in childhood I sported and play'd, The wide open lawn, and the nut-yielding shade, The stream where I paddled my buoyant canoe, And the wood where my dart on the panther I drew, The wide grassy heath, where a hunter I stray'd, And the cool gushing fountain o'erhung with a shade. Scenes dear to my mem'ry, as dear to my taste, That cling round my soul, like green spots on the waste. And still when in fancy, I lingering trace, The riper pursuits of my wayfaring race What visions of glory burst in on my sight, The war-path in all its proud blazonry bright. I see in the dark wood, the battle-fire gleam, I hear the proud warrior's soul-startling scream; I see the axe liftedâI hear the drum beat, And the loud-sounding tread of the war-stirring feet, The rush and the volleyâthe crash and the cry, And the trophy triumphantly borne through the sky: Transported, I seem to take part in the strife, And shout with young vigour, and strike with new life. âOnâonward,â I cry; âlet no recreant here âPut hand to his quiver, or staff to his spear; âShout, sons of Jeheelaââtill rous'd to behold, I drop in myself, chilly, feeble and old; And bent o'er my staff with emotion deep felt, Sigh over the valley where heroes once dwelt, And slow up the long winding hill as I tread, My thoughts still revert to my lov'd native shed; Where though poor, I was happy, though ignorant, blest, For my wants were supplied, and my heart was at rest, Once more from this hill-top, sweet valley, adieu! I had hopes ere this tempest so recklessly blew, In thy deep, quiet alcoves, where fancy inspires, To lay down my bones by the side of my sires. But the cry of the stranger rings loud in the blast, And all my domains are allotted and cast, And linger, and falter, and struggle, and sigh, The fiat hath issuedâthe Indian must die. A spirit of ocean, the Englishman came, Borne along in his ships and elate with his fame; But though white was his visage and costly his dress, We perceiv'd on that visage the stain of distress. All humble in manner, entreating and bland, He sat himself down on our wood-cover'd land; But ever increasing in numbersâat length, Hath scal'd yon blue mountains in pride of his strength, Whence spreading with power no force can withstand, His children encompass the ends of the land. Every scene of our triumph, our joy and our woe, They have marr'd with the mattock, or turn'd with the plough. The groves they have fell'd, and the valleys embraced, Nor e'en left my children the wide heathy waste. Where deer once stood drinking, or buffalo low'd, We are tax'd for way tribute The United States government pays a toll for every Indian who crosses the bridges of River aux Ecorces and River Rouge, in Michigan. by river or road, And strange sounding echoes the wide valley fill, The forge and the spindle, the hammer and mill. Oh! vale of my fathers, and thou, noble stream! No more on your banks shall the war-leader dream; Or the hunter reclin'd in his cottage or grove, Taste the sweets of repose, or the pleasures of love. Our strength hath departedâour chieftains are gone, They sleep in their barrows, or hillocks of stone; E'en the graves we so cherish'd, no longer are ours, Death's, death's chilly tempest high over us low'rs. I go where no white man shall chase me away, No avarice covet, no falsehood betray; Where man is no longer a lord or a slave, For I go, sweet reflection! I go to my grave. All lone is the precinct, and shelter'd the spot, Where yet a few years, I shall spread my frail cot, Then lay me down lone in that far western clod, And return to my fathers, my home, and my God. IV. THE WARRIOR'S SOLILOQUY: ON THE PROPOSITION TO REMOVE THE INDIANS WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI. The storm that is rising my fathers foretold: I see the clouds driving, dark, dreary, and cold; I see the red flash, and I hear the deep roar, That warns the lone Indian his reign is no more. No more in wood, council, or fight shall he spring, A warrior, a hunter, a chief, or a king; But, driv'n by the tempest, leave nothing behind But a spirit of freedom no senates could bind. I cast my eyes east, and I cast my eyes west, But in vainâI must go from the land I love best, Like a bark on the brink, or a boat on the shore, Turn'd adrift to the winds without paddle or oar; Fate sits on the billows and beckons me there, And I go with regret, for I go in despair. Our fathers thought little of houses and land, With weariness laboured by oxen or hand; And still, as the sounds of the woodman drew nigh, To deeper recesses prepared them to fly, Leaving sweet sunny valleys, and mountain brooks clear, In far western woods to go hunting the deer; And little bethinking the value of soil, Whether sixpence an acre, or sixpence a mile. But still the cry followed, and still we pursuedâ From valley to valley, from woodland to wood, Till many a weary domain we had cross'dâ Our leaders, our country, our heritance lost! All wild as we wandered, and far as we rov'd, There were, who the forester ardently lov'd. The teacher came to usâthe teacher was poor; He sat himself down by our rude cabin door. He spoke so serenely of mercy and love, And the glories that wait the blest spirit above; So sweetly to heaven he pointed the way, We forgot how to fight as we learned how to pray. We lean'd on our war staffs, and let the deer run, While heark'ning to words thus sublimely begun. But the foe came upon us with faggot and shot, And swept in one ruin, wife, children and cot. Again to the bow and the arrow we flew, Though war-path, or war-song, we scarcely more knew. All vain was the effortâfoes compass'd our kind, The panther before, and the horseman behind. And now that our tribes have been borne in their flight, Far, far from their lov'd native regions of light, Till their tents have encroach'd on the very confines Where the sun's setting ray most effulgently shines; And almost, as we sit in reflection severe, The sounds of the vasty west ocean we hearâ What voice is it utters! what sound's understood, From the halls of the wise, and the land of the good? 'Tis a voice that proclaims, in loud accents of woe, Across yon proud hill-topsââGo, way-farer, go!â Alone in my cottage, with head low reclin'd, And robe drawn around me, I think on my kind; On all they have witness'd, on all they have borne, In corn-cover'd valley, or forest forlorn, I think on the present I think on the past, And oft on the future my vision I cast. Sad, sad is the prospect, and faint is the ray That hope sheds abroad to direct us the way. While Memory, wreathing a garland of woe, Points backward with eyes that incessantly flow. Ah me! when I look on the wearisome road We thoughtlessly entered, and painfully trod, Where we battled or hunted with terror and groans, The path is marked out by our forefather's bones. And when I look forward beyond the big stream, Where bleak barrens rustle, and war-axes gleam, I see the dark cloud that hangs threatening there, Surcharged with vexation, war, want, and despair. But 'tis done! On these fields we no longer can stay; What the war-gun hath left us the plough sweeps away. The Spirit of Hunters with bitterness mourns; No light for her children propitiously burns; The plain that entices her far in the west Is hemm'd round with foes, and in terror possest. We go to those plains, where a few fleeting years Shall close a long race of vexation and tears; And all we shall leave to denote that we e'er Trod war-dance or war-path, hurl'd hatchet or spear, Will be shown in a hillockâperhaps a few stones, The track of our footsteps, our name, and our bones; Whence the trav'ler may go, and exclaim in his pride, They liv'd and they wandered, they wander'd and died! But though they were hapless, our fathers were brave, And scorn'd e'en the earth that was trod by a slave, Resolved to be free, and content with the fare, That freedom supplied without labour or care, All wealth they despised, and held war as the breath That made their lives sweet, and that solac'd their death. Thus I and my kindred, though bidden to go, No sigh, no remonstrance, no tremor shall show. We blanch not at danger, we shrink not at pain; Too poor to entreat, and too proud to complain, Like men we have breasted the storms and the sky, And still, we, like men, shall live freely, or die. 20th October, 1828. V. WYANOC: ON VIEWING THE FALLS OF ST. MARY. St. Mary's falls run swift and strong, and ever as on they go, The waves from shore to shore prolong, a hollow sound of woe, That sound upon mine ear doth write, the note of my tribe's decay, That, like a running stream by night, is rapidly passing away. The storm that o'er it hangs is black, and gathering still apace, And in its cold, unpitying track, shall sweep away my race. They sink ... they pass ... they fly ... they go, like a vapour at morning dawn, Or a flash of light, whose sudden glow, is seen ... admir'd ... and gone! But who their martial dirge shall sing, or wake the funeral song, Or dancing round the burning ring, each choral shout prolong? There were ... there were! but they lie low, and never more shall spring, To wield the lance, or bend the bow ... to revel, fight, or sing! They died ... but if a red man bleeds, or fills the dreamless grave, Shall none repeat his name ... his deeds, or tell that he was brave? Though polish'd not, my falling line, in quiet temperance grew, And glory, pity, love divine, and many a virtue knew; And they were free, and they were bold and they had hearts could feel, And laugh'd at hunger, pain and cold, nor fear'd the foeman's steel. But farewell all! my native woods, repeat this simple verse, Waft far the strain, ye ample floods ... ye woody shores, rehearse. Dear native groves and hills and streams!âmy father's land and mine, Though sunk our sun, there still are gleams, that on my bosom shine. Cold as ye are, with boreal chills, where plenty never smiles, More sweet to me thy fir-clad hills, than India's sunny isles. 'Tis peace that gives a nation rest ... 'tis virtue keeps it free, These still were ours, had heaven blest, or Colon sunk at sea. Oh, I could tell, but 'tis in vain ... and weep, but there's a vow My tribe scorn'd ever to complain, and I disdain it now. VI. AN INDIAN MOTHER'S LAMENT FOR HER CHILD. My son! my son! forever loved and lost, Why hast thou left me on this dreary coast? Oh, ever loved! say whither hast thou flown? To what strange land, and people not thine own? Ah, wretched child! so quickly torn away, So young, so sweet, so innocently gay! Ah, come thou loved one! come to me again, Suppress these tears, and ease this burning pain. Who now shall hold thy weak and tender head, Who bring thee water? who prepare thee bread? Who, when on high careers the icy storm, Spread out thy mossy bed and keep thee warm? Oh, ever loved! that I could more embrace Thy well known form and see thee face to face, That I could press thee to this breaking heart, Fond, lost delight! and neverânever part. Of what avail was all my tender care, The midnight watching and the secret prayer? Of what avail was all my boasted powers, My herbs narcotic and my balmy flowers? Worseâworse than nought, since they were nought to save, And keep thee longer from the dreary grave. Yet why arraign my spirit? why repine? Soon shall this earth-bound shadow follow thine, And we together, those bright fields explore, Where want nor pain shall vex the body more; The troubled soul be crown'd with joy and peace, And taste enjoyments that shall never cease.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MISCELLANIES. LOVE. [Why heaves my breast with troubled sighs] Why heaves my breast with troubled sighs, Foreboding ills which may not rise? Dark clouds may rise, but sink again, And a much brighter sky remain. Oh aid, ye spiritsâye clouds, depart! Or Zhayba, give me back my heart. Long had my sky been clear and blue, As in my dreams I used to view. Lightsome I rose with heart as free, As they that flit from tree to tree. Like you, sweet warblers, I could sing When newly pair'd in early spring. Oh aid, ye spiritsâye clouds, depart, Or Zhayba, give me back my heart. My path was deck'd with flowers sweet, Refresh'd with dew to bear the heatâ The heat of yonder glorious ball, That lights and warms and gladdens all. Oh aid, ye spiritsâye clouds, depart, Or Zhayba, give me back my heart. Alas, my sunny days are past, My sky is black and overcast, My path is chok'd with thorns and reeds, My pleasant flow'rs transform'd to weeds, I'm cross'd by wile, or Moneto, And all my dreams are dreams of woe. Oh aid, ye spiritsâye clouds, depart, Or Zhayba, give me back my heart. No longer can my heart respond To notes, of which 'twas once so fond, No more its throbs a pleasure bring, A joy I knew, but cannot sing. Nor can I rove with step so light Among the flow'rets with delight; For love, alas, has chang'd the scene, I only know such joys have been. Oh aid, ye spiritsâye clouds, depart, Or Zhayba, give me back my heart. I seek the lone, sequestered spot, The silver shoreâthe shady grot, But ah, how vain my footsteps rove, How vain to find a cure for love. Oh aid, ye spirits ... ye clouds, depart, Or Zhayba, give me back my heart. These lines were sketched by a Lady, and retouched, with additional lines, by the author of this little collection. [Sweetheart, dost thou think of me] Sweetheart, dost thou think of me, When beneath the forest tree? Dost thou, in the passing wind, Catch the sighs I've cast behind? Ah, I fear ... I fear ... I fear, Evil bird hath fill'd thine ear. Sweetheart, in the clear blue sky, Canst thou read my constancy, Or, in whispering branches near, Aught from thy true lover hear? Ah, I fear ... I fear ... I fear, Evil bird hath fill'd thine ear. [Ah, when remembrance brings to mind] Ah, when remembrance brings to mind The youth as brave as he was kind, Love, hope, and joy alternate start, And wake a transport in my heart. Oh, the bitterness of mind, To be loved and left behind. And when he bade the sad adieu, He said, âMy love, I'll go with you!â âI'll go with you!â my heart replied, But on my tongue the answer died. Oh, the bitterness of, &amp;c. The kiss he gave ... the look so kind, He cast when leaving me behind, I'll ne'er forget ... oh grief may kill, Brave youth! but I shall love thee still. Oh, the bitterness, &amp;c. [My love is a hunter ... he hunts the fleet deer] My love is a hunter ... he hunts the fleet deer, With fusil or arrow, one half of the year; He hunts the fleet deer, over mountain and lea, But his heart is still panting for love and for me. Oh, blest is the wood-nymph, reclin'd at her ease, As she thinks on her love in her bower of trees. My love is a warriorâwhen warriors go, With fusil or arrow to strike the bold foe, He treads the bright war-path with step bold and free, But still his thoughts wander to love and to me. Oh blest, &amp;c. But hunter or warriorâwhere'er he may go, To track the fleet reindeer, or follow the foe; His heart's warm desire, field and forest still flee, To go hunting his love, and make captive of me. Oh blest. &amp;c. THE CHIPPEWA GIRL. [They tell me the men with a white-white face] They tell me the men with a white-white face, Belong to a purer, nobler race, But why, if they do, and it may be so, Do their tongues cry âyesââand their actions âno?â They tell me, that white is a heavenly hue, And it may be so, but the sky is blue; And the first of menâas our old men say, Had earth-brown skins, and were made of clay. But throughout my life, I've heard it said, There's nothing surpasses a tint of red; Oh, the white's man cheeks look pale and sad, Compared to my beautiful Indian lad. Then let them talk of their race divine Their glittering domes, and sparkling wine; Give me a lodge, like my fathers had, And my tall, straight, beautiful Indian lad. [To rove with the wild bird, and go where we will] To rove with the wild bird, and go where we will, Oh this is the charm of the forest-life still, With our houses of bark and our food on the plain, We are off in an instant, and back there again. No farms can detain usâno chattels prevent, We live not by ploughingâwe live not by rent; Our herds rove the forestâour flocks swim the floods, And we skim the broad waters, and trip through the woods. With ships not of oak wood, nor pitchy, nor strong, We sail along rivers, and sail with a song; We care not for taxesâour laws are but few, And the dart is our sickleâour home the canoe. If enemies press us, or evil feet stray, We seize on our lances and fight them away; And when we have nothing more pressing on hand, We shake the proud rattle, and dance on the land. We read no big volumes, and clearly from this, If truths we don't gather, the errors we miss; Our seers and our chieftains, they tell us what's right, And freely we sing and we dance and we fight. [The lady I saw at the gain-loving town] The lady I saw at the gain-loving town, Looked proudly, I ween, on the Iowa down, But I thought if 'twere not for the power of dress, The odds in our looks would be greatly the less. Though garish and flaunty and lively and bright With ribands and tassels and scarlet and white, My own simple maiden is more to my view, With her beaming dark eyes and her mantle of blue. Oh, damsels of beauty, that dazzle the sight, May be good and be wise and be kind and polite; But my own native lass, to my own humble mind, Is far more engaging and modest and kind. She looks on me proudly, whenever I go, With my new garnish'd robe, and my feathers and bow, And all my ambition, in dresses and styles, Is to copy her neatness, and smile as she smiles. [My love, she gave to me a belt, a belt of texture fine] My love, she gave to me a belt, a belt of texture fine, Of snowy hue, emboss'd with blue, and scarlet porcupine; This tender braid sustain'd the blade, I drew against the foe, And ever prest upon my breast, to mark its ardent glow. And if with art I act my part, and bravely fighting stand, I, in the din, a trophy win, that gains Nemoosha's hand. My love, she is a handsome girl, she has a sparkling eye, And a head of flowing raven hair, and a forehead arched and high, Her teeth are white as cowry shells, brought from the distant sea, And she is tall, and graceful all, and fair as fair can be. And if with art I act my part, and bravely wooing stand, And with address my suit I press, I gain Nemoosha's hand. Oh, I will search the silver brooks for skin of blackest dye, And scale the highest mountain-tops, a warrior's gift to spy; I'll place them where my love shall see, and know my present true, Perhaps when she admires the gift, she'll love the giver too. And if with art I act my part, and bravely wooing stand, I'll gain my love's unsullied heart, and then I'll gain her hand. TO LEELINAU. Let the winds, with dreary sound, Sweep along the frozen ground, While the foliage, sear'd and dry, Flits amid the nether sky; This from my heart no sigh shall ever draw, While rosy health attends my Leelinau. Sheâwho in my bark-built tent, Smiling sits with sweet content Sweeps with boughs my mossy seat, And prepares my mountain-meat. Blow, ye winds! 'tis nature's changeless law, But spare, oh spare my smiling Leelinau. If my lodge, so rude and low, Be envelop'd deep in snow, If the deer, with hunger prest, Fly to yonder distant west; Ah, why should thought becloud, or envy gnaw. While love is left me in my Leelinau? Gloomy storms will cease to howl, And fair skies succeed to foul; Wants will cease, and snows will melt, And reviving spring be felt; But, ah! while here on earth our breath we draw, What can restore to life my Leelinau? AHMO AND OPEETA. Two Indian maids on Huron's dewy shore, The absence of their faithful swains deplore, Each in her hand, to ward the solar rays, A garnished fan of native quills displays. Their long dark locks, with fragrant grass entwined, Float odorous on the gentle western wind. The deer-skin shoe, with painted quills replete, From glowing sands protects their timid feet. Each taper neck seven strings of wampum grace, And each displays the beauteous wrought metass. A leggon. A flowing robe, of peace-denoting blue, Enwraps each form and half conceals from view, Yet half displaysâas every breeze that flies With envious force unfolds its ample size. Anxious they move, with timid steps and slow, And frequent heave the sigh of tender woe, Oft as they pass, they look with tearful eyes, Where distant isles or towering cliffs arise. They search the winding shore ... the breezy steep, And the dark woods where hunted reindeer sleep, But all in vain ... in vain they weep and pray, Far o'er the hills their warlike lovers stray. In vain they fast for two successive days, Refuse the pearly rice and golden maize; But not in vain invoke the muse's aid, The muse till now unknown in Huron's shade. The muse consents, and in untutor'd lays Thus simple maids record their lovers' praise. AHMO. Oft, when the stars shine out and night is mute, My graceful lover blows his sounding fute; Its tender notes pervade my beating veins, And happy thought and sober quiet reigns. OPEETA. At day's decline, Wayoond successful hies, And at my feet he lays the forest's prize, The smoking haunch is soft and kindly spread, And fatty white relieves its warlike red. He tells of rocks and waters he has past, And all the frowning terrors of the waste. I sigh while thus he speaks, for well I know The dreary wood is fill'd with many a woe; But while I sigh, I smile with rapture too, For hunters ever are as brave as true. AHMO. Less skill'd my lover is, the game to take, Along the grassy plain or sounding lake, But when his bleeding country calls to arms, He rushes heedless of its woes and harms; He with the valiant takes his wary stand, And well his eyes delight in dart or brand. The fray dispatch'd, he brings his captive slave, And walks a warrior free, and bold and brave. And when discourse reverts to toils of war, He tells intent of ghastly wound or scar, The while on me his eyes with rapture turn, And through my frame I feel love's passion burn. He takes my fan, he lifts my fallen band, And both seem dearer from his ready hand. Where acts so kindly speak the lover's part, What need of words his feelings to impart? OPEETA. My lover is as skilful as he's tall, And in the sport or dance the pride of all. Once, when the gathered youth, in sports embark, He hurl'd a hatchet nearest to the mark, Through all the crowd approving shouts were rais'd, And I was blithe of heart, and he was prais'd. AHMO. Well do I mind, when single and alone, My warlike lover heaved a giant stone; His powers of strength drew forth the village cries, And grateful shouts were sounded through the skies. OPEETA. The heavy bow my youthful lover drew, And instant to the mark his arrow flew. AHMO. In speech Ontyah, at the council fire, Poured from his soul the counsels of a sire; The wide assembly all his words approv'd, The man was honour'd and the speaker lov'd. WAR CHANT. The birds ... the birds, the warlike birds, are gathering in the sky, I see their talons gleaming brightâI hear their deathful cry. Their cry is e'er for human food, and woeful is their flight, And ere another moon is past, they'll batten on the fight. The bloody limb, The warrior grim, Shall greet the raven's flight; And many a woe, To friend and foe, Spring from the fatal fight. They cross the line ... they cross the line, the birds they cross the line, Foreboding to our foes defeat, all by the prophet's sign; And we will up and follow thence, and we will up and fight, And die as erst our fathers died, combatting for our right. Our fathers' might, Ye bards recite, Raise high the battle cry; For we will go To meet the foe, And like our fathers die. The shout ... the shout, the warlike shout, come let us now prolong, And raise once more, o'er lake and shore, the tributary song. Our noble bands were ever brave, and ever scorn'd to be Where man to man, they could not stand, and greet each other free. Come, let us beat, With sounding feet, The fatal battle ring; And as of old, Like warriors bold, The battle chorus sing. I sigh to go ... I sigh to go, where lives are nobly lost, Where battle clubs are freely cast, and lances freely crost: My body to the birds I give,âmy name shall e'er remain, To teach the foe I scorn'd his bow, and triumph'd over pain! Let fainting hearts Learn woman's arts, Let cowards turn and flee! Vide Burns. But we will die, Like warriors high, Or live like warriors free. ADDRESS OF THE DYING WARRIOR. Ah, cruel's the fate, and most bitter the woe, That dooms me to fall in the land of the foe, And leaves me all wounded and fainting to lie In this dark dreary wood, where no kindred are nigh, To mourn my departure, or light for the brave The watch-fire of death on my desolate grave. Soonâsoon will my body be cast from the eye, And laid in the earth, where I know it must lie; While you, my companions, who watch round my head, With secret sensations of pity and dread, Will return to that landâfairest land of the earth! That witness'd my manhood and gave me my birth; Where in boyhood I roved by the sweet silver shore, But which I am doomed to revisit no more. Ye leave meâye leave meâto moulder away, Far away from my friends, and shut out from the day, Where no youth of my nation my coffin shall spy, With its war-tokens garnish'd, and scaffolded high; But secret and stealthy, with voices supprest, Deep, deep in the earth you will lay me to rest, Where no friend shall re-visitâno foe shall espy The leaf-cover'd sod where my ashes may lie; No slow kindly foot shall return to the spot, No sorrowful hand build the sepulchre-cot; No voice my achievements or virtues repeat, But evil-birds scream, and wild hurricanes beat. But I go to rejoin in the fields of the blest, My forefathers' shades, and be with them at rest; With joy they shall mark my unfetter'd advance, With battled-crown'd garland, and war-gleaming lance; And with pride they shall hail their long-lingering son, To the joys that his fame and his valour have won. Day shuts on my sightâI no longer can see, Those looks that are tenderly cast upon me. Cease, cease your kind effortsâall cares are in vain, Death, death can alone stanch my wounds or my pain. Ah, remember Camudwa was trusty and brave, And visit, my friends, ah, re-visit his grave. Now sinks my low pulse ... the world fades from my view, And my friendsâoh my friends!âhe but whisper'd adieu. INVOCATION AT AN INDIAN ALTAR. Awful Spirit of the sky, Hearken ... hearken to my cry! Thou, who oft by anger driven, Flingst the streaming fire from heaven; And with big and bellowing sound, Layst the smoking pine a-ground. Thou, whom oft my fancy's eye, Hath remark'd in passing by, Sailing on the nether sky: Hearken ... hearken to my cry! Me, a hunter poor and weak, Forced the flying game to seek; Me, a warrior inly blind, Often warring with my kind; Seeking glory with the dart, Or the white man's deadlier art, Oh, direct me and if still, Thy dread purpose I fulfil, Give me strength and courage clear, Still to wield the dart and spear, Still to seek the woodland foe, Panther, wolf, or carcajou; Still to wanderâstill to be, Hunter bold, or warrior free. But if erring, wrong, or lost, Evil step my path hath crost; Lend me thy supernal light, Once again to seek the right. Teach me to forget the ill, And the wiser course to fill; And if they, who read and pray Have the better, happier way, Teach me war and rage to shun, Bow and arrow, lance and gun. Teach me peace and fame to seek, With a spirit bland and meek; And with arts of milder hue, Such as Christian men pursue; Such as heavenly words declare, Hope and faith and love and prayer. Now accept my humble rite, Offered thus by nature's light; Not in temple, where benign Tapers gleam or banners shine; But along this wild-wood lone, On the rude, unchissel'd stone. If thou aught amiss espy, From thy mansions in the sky, Let my purpose most sincere, Hallow offering held so dear; And the incense rise above, Meek memorial of my love.â Of my hopeâthat thou alone Rulest on the silver throne; And my faithâin cot or road That thou only art the God. THE LIGHT OF NATURE. For me, the duck on annual wing, Returns to hail the genial spring, For me, the birds with eager loves Hie gladly to their singing groves; For me the elk of stately make Returns to browse along the lake; And all the tribes of every hue Delight in life and vigour new. I look o'er all the earth and all the skies, And see myself the lord of nature's paradise. The teeming earth with secret powers, Renews her fruits, and spreads her flowers; The grove puts on her green attire, Along the stream the plants aspire; The waters too, from soils below, Smile with the lily's fragrant blow, And sprouting rice-blades peeping through, Where lately pass'd the light canoe. O'er all the scene, I see a bounteous hand, And holy nature renovates the land. The heavens put on their mildest hue, The skies their brightest tints of blue, Day glitters with exceeding light, And beauty fills the throne of night; The moon and stars a silver glow Shed, tremblingly, on all below; While thunder's voice Thunder is always personified in the discourse of the North American Indians. and lightning's play, Far to the south have winged their way. And shall my heart not bow to him alone, Supernal Lord of nature's glorious throne? It shallâit shall!âthe seasons turn, The sun shines out ... the planets burn, And spring and summer softly bring Each varied, rapid, kindly thing; Autumn with colours clothes our woods, And winter comes to chill the floods; All nature tells of changes here, Shall mortal man unchang'd appear? Ah, no! he sickens, like the dying year, And God himself upholds the shining sphere. PRAYER. [Great Father, let piety be our life's measure] Great Father, let piety be our life's measure, Our purest of duties, and truest of pleasure; Bad livingâbad acting, the curse of our lands, Oh, come let us leave, as the Spirit commands. Then blest in our roving, wherever we go, Success shall attend on our camp and our bow; We will live without blame, and will pity our kind, And when we depart, leave a good name behind. The Great Spirit made usâthe Great Spirit knows, Our wants and our weakness, our virtues and woes; But if we forget him, and pray not most true, He will leave us in darkness all life's journey through. Pray comrade ... pray warrior ... pray hunter ... pray chief, 'Tis the only sure mode of our getting relief; He will hearken to bless his poor sons of the wood, And give us a seat in the land of the good. [In the frowning cliff, that high] In the frowning cliff, that high Glooms above the passing eye: Casting spectral shadows tall, Over lower rock and wall: In its morn and sunset glow, I behold a Manito. By the lake, or river lone, In the humble fretted stone, Water-sculptured, and by chance, Cast along the wave's expanse: In its morn and sunset glow, I behold a Manito. In whatever's dark or new, And my senses cannot view, Complex work ... appearance strange, Arts' advance, or nature's change: Fearful e'er of hurt or woe, I behold a Manito. In the motions of the sky, Where the angry lightnings fly, And the thunder, dread and dire, Lifts his mighty voice in fire: Awed with fear of sudden woe, I behold a Manito. Here, my humble voice I lift, Here, I lay my sacred gift; And with heart that bowing prays, Cries of hallelujah raise. Spirit, Father, God, or Jove, Thee I fear, and Thee I love; And if joy betide, or woe, Thou, thou art my Manito. [Heaven may change, and earth may flee] Heaven may change, and earth may flee, But I shall an Indian be, If, to be a convert pure, Mean, my country to abjure; Or those feelings of the heart, Friends and home and peace impart; Or those hopes of justice bright, That no time can change or blight; Or that faith, that actions here, Shall in heaven above appear. But if change may only mean, Manners rude, or rites unclean; Faith defective ... maxims blind, Such as blear the native mind;â If it mean not, to forego Present good for present woe, Banish every view estranged, Change me, for my heart is changed, And begin the sacred vow, For I am a convert now. THE SPECTRE SEER; OR THE WARRIOR'S DREAM. The prophet rose at dead of night, All on the burial hill, And âup! my brethren, rise!â he cried, In accent deep and shrill. He shook his wand and magic bones, He beat his dancing drum, And âho! my brethren, rise!â he cried, âThe hour we hoped has come. âHo! warriors up, and seize your arms, âFor they were laid with ye, âAnd let us to the war again, âAnd battle to be free. âHo! chieftains, lift your idle spears, âAnd stand before your bands; â'Tis yours once more, by lake and shore, âTo rise and take your lands. âUp, up, and arm, the hour is come, âUp, warriors, one and all; âWe'll sweep away the pale-faced race, âOr give them thrall for thrall. âThey tread upon our father's bones, âAnd mix in ditch and wall, âThe dust of warriors once renown'd, âAnd chiefs the pride of all. âRepose no more, for vengeance calls, âFame, duty, honour, love: âWhate'er can fire the soul below, âOr bless in heaven above.â And from their graves the dreamless dead, Arose upon the strand; Each with war-signal on his head, And weapon in his hand. Like gathering clouds the warriors stood, A hundred thousand men; A horrid front to look upon, For blood was in no vein. But banners waved, and lances shook, And frontlets seam'd with red; And giant chiefs moved to and fro, An army of the dead. And ever and anon was heard, The drum and rattle strong; And then arose with hollow sound, The fearful battle song. And slowly now began to move, The rattling foot and lance, Till all that ghastly multitude United in the dance. And âho! my friends,â the prophet cried, âNow let us onward go; âWith shout and songâI give the cry, âI lead you to the foe!â And at that word, a hollow yell, Broke out from every band; That peal'd across the distant vale And shook the solid land. A moment more, and not one soul Of all that fearful throng, Was seen beneath the moon's pale beam, Where late they rais'd the song. Each to his own lone sepulchre, Slid back with viewless trace; And nought but rustling leaf disturb'd The silence of the place. But when the hour of twelve came round, At midnight damp and chill; That seer arose, and all his bands Stood on the burial hill. Old Metacom forsook his rest, And reverend Skenandoah; And Sassacus and Tamenund, And Myontonimoh. And Pontiac the brave was there, And dread Kway Sind the strong, And Logan famed for eloquence, And Wahb Ojeeg for song. And grim Tecumthaâhe was there, Who fought with erring frown; To build one race of white men up, And pull another down. And from the south Capolicon Came flying fast in hate, And Gautimozinâhe stood there, In all his former state. But ever, at the prophet's cry, As that dread shout they gave, Each sunk away invisible, Within his narrow grave. And thus for six lone nights I saw That ghastly wild array; And still at midnight's solemn hour They fled in shouts away. But on the seventh night, the sound That o'er my senses broke, Pealed out so long ... so deep ... so loud, That from my trance I woke. I lay beneath my humble shed, My wife and children round; The wind moaned loudly through the trees, And thunders shook the ground. And still within my ears there rang The sound of shout and drum, And those shrill words the prophet spoke, âAwake, the hour is come!â And I aroseâI could not sleep, For thoughts perplex'd my soul, And sought the village priest's abode My vision to unroll. âMy son,â he said, âthy dream to read, âI've sought the Spirit's view; âWho ne'er doth err by word or sign, âTo those who seek him true. âAnd much it grieves my aged heart, âTo open now to thee, âThe painful scroll of Indian fate âAnd miseries yet to be. âThy dream is power ... that Indian power âWhich once our sons possest, âO'er all the hills and lakes and streams âThat spot the gilded west. âThat power, not Metacom could save, âNot Pontiac restore; âBut year by year, grew less and less, âInstead of more and more. âAnd now 'tis nearly gone, but still âOne woe is left behind; âTo sweep from every eastern hill âThe erring Indian kind. âThey go beyond the endless stream, âThat, sprung from northern skies, âSpreads out its mighty arms supreme, âWhere stormy Mexic lies. âThey go beyond that barrier proud, âTo enter life anew; âBut if in pride or woe, their end âMy ken is not to view. âHope wellâfor hope is still a friend, âAs dear to our poor kind, As those who claim superior wealth, âAnd nobleness of mind. âBut if there is, in race refin'd, âThe nobleness they claim, âThey will respect our free-born kind, âAnd keep our valiant name. â'Tis fame our sages ever sought, âAmid life-thorns and flowers; âAnd though dominion flies our grasp, âStill glory shall be ours. âThe Indian nameâthe Indian name, âThe Indian name shall live, âAnd they who prest us sorest, still. âOur warmest plaudit give. âReturn, my son! thy wifeâthy child, âThy own dear native sod, âStill love:âexert thy earnest force, âAnd leave the rest to God.â</field>
