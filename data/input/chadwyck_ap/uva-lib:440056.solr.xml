      <field name="fulltext">THE EXTINGUISHER. Oh! tales are told and songs are sung Of toilers far and near, The soldier and the fisherman, The plodding muleteer, The lumberman with sounding ax Where northern forests bow, The sailor on his dizzy ropes, The farmer at his ploughâ But no fond bard has sung the praise Or marked the weary way Of him who puts the street-lamps out Before the dawn of day. Who knows at what unchristian hour He leaves his happy sleep? Or does he stay all night awake His lonesome tryst to keep? And does he walk the dismal streets Without a thought of fear, Nor dread to meet a prowling foe, Nor dream of danger near? And does he do his work for love Without a thought of pay, The man who puts the street-lamps out Before the dawn of day? They call the midnight hour the time When cemeteries yawnâ But ah, the fearsome time o' night Is just before the dawnâ The darkest, coldest, dreariest time, When half the world is dumb, When shadows look like spectral shapes, And thieves and burglars comeâ When windows stare like sleepless eyes, And fogs roll up the bayâ Just when he puts the street-lamps out Before the dawn of day. But worse than all the darkest nights Are those when low and late The ghostly moon companions him, And follows like a fate; She waits at corners till he comes, Then flits before he knows, And sends a phantom, black and grim, To track him where he goes; I wonder if he dreads her face, Or likes her pallid ray, This man who puts the street-lamps out Before the dawn of day? The only signs of life he sees But wear a mournful guise; Behind each dim-lit pane, he knows Some sleepless sorrow lies; Some woman tends a suffering child, Or bathes a sick man's head, Or some devoted spirit keeps Its vigil by the deadâ And hails his footstep as the sign Of morn's returning ray, What time he puts the street-lamps out Before the dawn of day. I hear him when the inky skies Pour down their drenching flood, His boots are noisy on the bricks, Or silent in the mud; I hear him in the windy nights When blinds and windows creak, I hear him in the winter-time When storms are wild and bleakâ And yet I never saw the face (Perhaps no mortal mayâ) Of him who puts the street-lamps out Before the dawn of day. THE ADJECTIVE. Where would the force of language be Without the adjective? How could the critic wing his shaft? How could the poet live? How could the novelist portray The creatures of his brain, The beauty of his heroine, The transport of his swain? No more his tide of eloquence The orator could pour, No more the man of science fill His treasuries of lore. The lover's tongue could never tell His passion and despair; Deprived of its superlatives Who would for flattery care? Where would the sting of satire be? The edge and point of wit? How could the stab of censure wound, The dart of sarcasm hit? Biographers would cease to prowl, Historians drop the pen, Paralysis would chill and numb The tongues and minds of men,â The press would lose its voice of might, The pulpit all its power, The sage could not describe a star, The botanist a flower,â So rarely is a period penned, A line or sentence made, Or thought set down, O adjective, Which does not claim thy aid! Yet I for once defy thy might, For mark me, as I live, No stanza of the nine here writ Contains an adjective! ACORN PLANTING. Bury the seed-germs deep, before the snow, No pledge for amber grain or golden ears, But for a fleet of ships, whose hulls shall grow Out of these acorn shellsâin fifty years. Who plants but for a summer-time, has need Of steady faith to rule his doubts and fears; How full of trust the soul that sows the seed Whose harvest ripens not for fifty years! Upon these germs shall Nature's forces wait, Sunlight and dew shall nurse the tender shoots, The landward breezes bring their misty freight, And timely rains refresh the thirsty roots. On the slow marvel of their annual growth Shall fickle skies alternate frown and smile, And richest green and deepest scarlet both In turn make beautiful the desert isle. How will the strong limbs writhe in woe and pain, When winter tempests rise in howling wrath, When roaring waves sweep inward from the main, And sailors' wives turn pale beside the hearth! And when the noble boughs swing wide and high, And the rejoicing trees wax tall and great, Then, on their seeming immortality, Will fall the sudden thunderbolt of fate,â Strong arms will level all their leafy grace, Deft hands will hew and shape,âand spar and mast, Keel, rib and beam and plank will find their place, And lo! the tardy harvest smiles at last! More marvellous than aught in that old tale Of dragons' teeth which sprouted men and spears, The story of the vessels which shall sail Out of these acorn cupsâin fifty years! Perchance some happy trunks, unscathed, may be Spared in their splendid strength and stateliness To greet the morning rising from the sea New, yet the sameâa hundred years from this. The squirrel, wisely lightening toil with mirth, Will frisk and fill his cheeks, upon the bough, Then, chattering, hide his treasures in the earth, In autumn days, a hundred years from now. Shy, sweet-voiced birds will warble in their shade, Far from all human stir and turbulence, And rear their downy offspring unafraidâ The song-birds of a hundred summers hence. But you and I, my friend, who muse and smile Over these fancies,âwe shall be, by then, Bowed, and dim-eyed, and wan;âso little while Makes ships of acorns, and makes wrecks of men! SNOWED IN. All night when the rattling windows ceased a moment to strive and beat, We heard the merciless wind pursue the whisking, whispering sleet, And gazing now with the dawn's first gleam through panes by frost impearled, We see but a waste of whirling white,âwhat has become of the world? We open the outer door to meet a solid, snowy wall, That, uninvited and unannounced, comes tumbling into the hall; The path from door to gateway is as though it had not been; And we are lost to the world to-dayâcut offâleft outâsnowed in! There is no creak of laboring teamsâno jingle of cutter bellsâ No schoolgirl's giggle, and clicking heelsâno schoolboy's senseless yellsâ There is no sound in the whole long street of whistle, or laugh, or talk, But shovel responds to shovel again, along the drifted walk. The snow-birds sit in the leafless tree, and laugh at our sorry plight; Even the postman plays us false, and never comes in sight; The drift grows deeper across the walk, and deeper still by the wall, And the milk-boy slights the waiting can, and the clam-man fails to call. Between the dwarfed and night-capped posts, the useless clothes-lines swingâ And Monday's clothes will go unhung, for who would wash and wring, With drifts hip-high in the drying-yard, and never a soul about To shovel and tread the zigzag paths, and dig the doorsteps out? And hours go by, and still it snows, till the fences stand knee-deep, And ever between the house and street there drifts a higher heap; The empty milk-can on the step is hidden out of sight; We shall have no milk for our frugal toast, no cream for our tea to-night! Snowed in! and we might die to-day, and lie here dead a week, And who would question our whereabouts, or come to ask and seek? Not one would wonder where we 'd gone, or when or how we went, Until the landlord came to bring his monthly bill for rent! SHOVELLING SNOW. A bountiful snowfall, over night, And street and sidewalk are blocked with whiteâ And plied by many a sturdy hand, The sound of the shovel is heard in the landâ Ah, hapless delvers, who rise at six, To excavate for the buried bricks! Alas, the labors of shovel and spade On all the railroads that ever were made, Can never begin with the toilsome woe Of muscle wasted in shovelling snow;â And when all the winter's task is o'er, The world is the same as it was before! In all other digging under the sun, There 's something gained by the labor doneâ A well, a highway, a grave, a ditch, Canal or garden, no matter which; But what is there left to save or show Of a winter's labor in shovelling snow? Ah, struggle for triumph that never is won! What does it come to, when all is done? For after the toiler has blistered his palms, And strained his shoulders and lamed his arms, He has cleared with infinite toil and pain, A place for the snow to fill again! Three undertakings beneath the sun Are never abandoned, and never doneâ Though generations their lives expend, They'll never be finished till time shall end; These three, as many have cause to know, Are house-work, kissing, and shovelling snow. THE SONG OF THE SEASON. Darling, you have taken cold, It is easy to be told,â That 's the sixteenth time to-day You have sneezed that dreadful way! I'll exhibit presently Foot-baths hot, and ginger tea, Else, my darling, you will be Sick as Punch, 't is plain to see. You must take a sweat to-night, And when you are melted quite With the heat and perspira- tion, I cannot choose but sayâ Oh, my darling, mine alone! I am grieved to hear you groan, But this remedy, my own, Is the best prescription known. Darling, we must cure your cold, Or, ere ever you grow old, Rheumatism will rack youâoh, But its twinges torture so! Ah, this weather's wicked will Is enough to make you illâ Yes, my darling, frost and chill Sharpen many a doctor's bill. Let me move your easy chair Farther from this draught of airâ Put your feet up in a row On the nice warm stove-hearth, so; I am fearful you have grown Careless of your health, my own, For you cough, and wheeze, and moan, Like a phthisicky trombone. L'ENVOI. Darling, you have taken cold, That is easy to be told, Sneezing in that dreadful way,â That 's the sixteenth time to-day! THE DERWENT DUCKS. Through the verdurous valleys of Derbyshire Flows the pretty Derwent river, Quiet and serious, slow and clear, While hazel and beech-sprays, drooping near, To its music dance and quiver; Through bosky shadows and banks of moss, Lazily, softly slipping; So narrow its channel that one may toss With little effort, a pebble across, And see where it ceases skipping. Steep hills rise sharply on either hand, And nestling in greenest hollows Clusters of small stone houses stand, Half-burrow, half-nest, like the quaintly-planned Homes of the queer bank-swallows. So old, no doubt they were occupied In the times of torch and martyr; They seem grown into the slope's steep side,â And terraces, narrow and walled, divide The town into definite strata. I doubt if the folk in the upper row Are better than those below it; But if stronger reason for high and low Ever existed, surely no History lives to show it. Beneath, with a look of calm content And a slow and slumberous motion, The quiet tide of the fair Derwent Rolls on, to join with the broader Trent, In its search for the German ocean. Looking down from my ivied nest, In the misty autumn weather, I watched two ducks on the river's breast, Side by side in their peaceful quest Sailing for days together. Their lives so happy and innocent, Into the past have drifted; They have been and are goneâbut where Derwent Lazily eddies in cool content, The secret is still unsifted. They were white and fair as the snow's first flake, And their necks were smooth and supple; (I call them ducks for convenience's sake, But one was a duck, and one a drake, And the two were a pretty couple.) When oft at night through the shadows brown, Of autumn's mild forewarning, I looked from my lofty window down On the mossy roofs of the sleepy town, And bade them adieu till morningâ I saw them dimly, two shapes of snow, On the darkness of the waters, Sailing sociably to and fro, As loth to paddle ashore and go Home to their sleeping quarters. And when, as soon as the daylight came, I looked for them down the river, I found them floating there all the same, As though night were nothing, and time a name, And they had been there forever. (In this dull town, which is sure to be Rainy, foggy or muddy For two whole days out of every three,â There 's really so very little to see That these two lovers became to me A most absorbing study.) At last on a morning chill and gray, One feathery sailor only Breasted the waves at break of day, Floating about in an aimless way, Silent, distraught and lonely. And day after day went by, until A week had dawned and departed, But the lost one came not, and sorrowing still The widower followed his waning will, Languid and heavy-hearted. But one fair morning no eye descried The wanderer unattended; No white neck parted the limpid tide; No fond hearts floated there, side by sideâ The idyl was done and ended! On half my storyâperhaps two-thirdsâ Do doubt and mystery hover, Since what became of those two fond birds I cannot put into fitting words, For I never could discover. Did they die, I wonder and ask in vain, In the under world or the upper? Did they dive, and fail to come up again? Did they sicken and perish, or were they slain For somebody's Sunday supper? I never shall know how their lives were rent And their true hearts reft and broken After their summer of calm contentâ The doom of the ducks on the dim Derwent Must always remain unspoken! HOW STRANGE IT WILL BE. How strange it will be, loveâhow strange, when we two Shall be what all lovers become, When love is no longer absorbingly new;â Not vulgarly faithlessânot really untrue, But cool and accustomed; you, ceasing to woo, Grown thoughtless of me, and I careless of you,â Our pet names grown rusty with nothing to doâ Love's bright web unravelled, and rent, and worn through, And life's loom left emptyâO, hum! Ah, me! How strange it will be! How strange it will be when the witchery goes Which makes me seem lovely to-day; When your thought of me loses its tint-of-the-roseâ When every day serves some new fault to disclose, When you criticise sharply, eyes, chin, mouth and nose, And wonder you could for a moment suppose I was out of the commonplace way; Ah, me! How strange it will be! How strange it will be, loveâhow strange, when we meet With just a chill touch of the hand! When my pulses no longer delightedly beat At the thought of your comingâthe sound of your feet,â When I watch not your going, far down the long street, When your dear, loving voice, now so thrillingly sweet, Grows harsh in reproach or command; Ah, me! How strange it will be! How strange it will be when we willingly stay Divided the weary day through! Or keeping remotely apart as we may, Sit chilly and silent, with nothing to say, Or coolly converse on the news of the day, In a wearisome, old-married-folks sort of way! I shrink from the picture,âdon't you? Ah, me! How strange it will be! Dear love, if our hearts do grow torpid and old, As so many others have doneâ If we let our love perish with hunger and cold, If we dim all life's diamonds, and tarnish its gold, If we choose to live wretched, and die unconsoled, 'T will be strangest of all things that ever were told As happening under the sun! Ah, me! How strange it will be! ISHMAEL DAY. One summer morning, a daring band Of rebels rode into Maryland, Over the prosperous, peaceful farms, Sending terror and strange alarms, The clatter of hoofs and the clang of arms. Fresh from the South where the hungry pine, They ate like Pharaoh's starving kine; They swept the land like devouring surge, And left their path, to its furthest verge, Bare as the track of the locust-scourge. âThe rebels are coming!â far and near Rang the tidings of dread and fear; Some paled and cowered, and sought to hideâ Some stood and waited, in fearless pride, And women shuddered, and children cried. But othersâvipers in human form Stinging the bosom that kept them warm, Welcomed with triumph the thievish band, Hurried to offer the friendly hand, As the rebels rode into Maryland,â Made them merry with food and wine, Clad them in garments rich and fine For rags and hunger to make amends, Flattered them, praised them, with selfish endsâ âLeave us scathless, for we are friends!â Could traitors trust in a traitor? No! Little they favored friend or foe, But gathered the cattle the farms across, Flinging back, with a scornful toss, âIf ye are friends, ye can bear the loss!â Flushed with triumph, and wine, and prey, They neared the dwelling of Ishmael Day, A sturdy veteran, gray and old, With heart of a patriot, firm and bold, Strong and steadfastâunbribed, unsold. And Ishmael Day, his brave head bare, His white locks tossed by the morning air, Fearless of danger, and death, and scars, Went out to raise, by the farm-yard bars, The dear old flag of the stripes and stars. Proudly, steadily up it flew, Gorgeous with crimson, and white, and blue; His withered hand, as he shook it freer, May have trembled, but not with fear, While, shouting, the rebels drew more near. âHalt!â They had seen the hated sign Floating wide from old Ishmael's line. âLower that rag!â was their wrathful cry. âNever!â rang Ishmael Day's reply; âFire, if it please you! I can but die!â One with a loud, defiant laugh, Left his comrades and grasped the staff; âDown!â came the fearless patriot's cry; âDare to lower that flag, and die! One must bleed for itâyou or I!â But caring not for the stern command, He drew the halliards with daring hand. Ping! went the rifle-ball,âdown he came Under the flag he had tried to shame. Old Ishmael Day took careful aim! Hark! an echo! and now again The tramp and tumult of armÃ©d men; And panic-stricken, the lawless band Left their leader upon the sand, And fled in fear out of Maryland. Seventy winters and three had shed Their snowy glories on Ishmael's head; But though cheeks may wither, and locks grow gray, His fame shall be fresh and young alwayâ Honor be to old Ishmael Day! A CAGED LION. He stands behind his iron bars, Untamed, untamable and proud, Disgraced by bondage, seamed by scars, The centre of a taunting crowd. Hunger and blows have vanquished him, Weakened his limbs and dwarfed his size, Yet all his woes have failed to dim The yellow splendor of his eyes,â Which note no face in all the throng, But see across, beyond, afar, The jungle depths, remembered long, And desert palms of Africa. So human souls, enslaved by chance, Deformed by time's remorseless scars, And scourged by cruel circumstance, Behind Fate's hindering prison-bars,â Heedless alike of praise and jeers, Blind to the present's chilly truth, See, through the unfriendly crowd of years, The torrid tropics of their youth! THE LAST VOYAGE. The midnight skies of autumn were brilliant overhead, As up the gleaming Hudson the laden vessel sped; The while with eye unsleeping, and nerves as strong as steel, The brave and faithful pilot kept vigil at the wheel. His home had been the river,âhe loved its ceaseless roar; He knew each mile of channel, each winding curve of shore; Had dared its rocks and shallows, and laughed at landsmen's fears In every wind and weather, for five-and-twenty years. No vapor hid the pole-star, no tempest crossed the night, No mist-wreath veiled the waters, no haze obscured the sight, But on the quiet midnight the bell's alarming note Rang out with sudden clangor, the warning âSlow the boat!â Up sprang the second pilot, with wonder in his eyes; âWhat ho! where is the danger?â he asked in dazed surprise. âThe sky is clear above us, the water deep below; What hidden peril threatens, or wherefore signal so?â The boat slid through the water with smooth and even keel, With grasp unmoved and steady, the old man held the wheel, Nor ever paused or faltered, but raised his eyes to say âA heavy fog has fallenâI cannot see the way!â âNo! look! the night is cloudless, the way is straight and clear; Yonder 's the light at Rhinebeck, and Rondout lies off here.â Still unconvinced, he whispered, his voice grown faint and hoarse, âThe fog is thick and heavy, and we have lost our course!â Awed suddenly to silence, the other took his place; He marked the deathly pallor that touched the old man's face. The pilot's work was ended; it was his time to go Upon that mystic voyage whose port we may not know. His years of patient labor and watchful care were past; A true and faithful servant, and loyal to the last, He felt across his vision death's icy dimness steal, His eye upon the beacon, his hand upon the wheel. Surely some waiting angel, who counts as victories won Long years of earnest labor and duties nobly done, Some just and gentle angel, with forehead like the day, Helped his bewildered spirit to find the shining way! A DEAR LONESOME DAY. I have been searching through every room, Careless of echoes, and silence, and gloom; Upstairs and down, from the roof to the ground, No human being is there to be found! And I exult in an infinite glee,â No living soul in the castle but me! So, jubilate! I turn all the keys,â World, do without me to-day, if you please! I am alone! I can laugh or can cry, Nobody watches or questions me why,â Nobody asks what the matter may be,â Oh, how delightful it is to be free! Talk of society's rarest delights, Sociable mornings and talkative nights,â Willingly, gladly, I fling them away,â Give me myself and a dear lonesome day! I am alone! I can do as I will, Rest or be busy, be noisy or still,â Read, sing, work, study, or string at my ease Verses (don't criticise,âbetter than these. These are the bubbles atop of the wine; Just a relief for this gladness of mine,) Jubilant, joyous, ecstatic, I sayâ I am deliciously lonesome to-day! Tired of the friction of soul against soul,â Who can endure it, and keep his own whole! Tired of all argument, counsel and blame, Tired of my yoke-fellows, tired of my name, Tired of tame questions and tamer replies, Figures, and faces, and voices, and eyes,â Often and often I cordially pray, Give me myself and a dear lonesome day! After so long being worried and whirled In this bewildering cage of the world, Like a poor squirrel made captive, I feel,â Caught from the nut-woods and kept in a wheel. Oh! the broad desertâthe wide lonesome sea Seems a desirable dwelling to me; Not self-sufficient, but weary,âI say Give me myself and a dear lonesome day! Selkirk, ungrateful, irascible elf, Growled, with a whole island all to himself, And in the midst of his numberless farms, Questioned of solitude, âWhere are thy charms?â Stupid old fellow he was, I declare,â I could have answered, if I had been there; And if I err not, with little ado, I could have taught him to value them too! Oh, 't is so rare and delightful to be Careless, unguarded, unwatchful, and free, Not observed, looked at, and marked all the while. So if one will, one may frown, blush, or smile, With the sweet surety that no one will spy, Guess at one's motives, and judge one thereby. Blessings on Fate, let her scowl when she may,â I am deliciously lonesome to-day! WINTER TIME. I cannot touch the cheerful strain My summer used to know, My soul is barren as the plain Beneath December's snow; Its gorgeous hues are dim and pale, Its fountain-voices dumb; Dead blossoms drift before the gale,â My winter time has come. The soaring eagle cannot stay Forever on the wing, The dew-drops cannot shine all day, Nor thrushes always sing. The flowers, in field and garden-plot, Faint as the long days roll; All things seek restâand wherefore not A feeble human soul? You do not chide when Nature's hand, Bidding her toilers cease, Spreads wide across the dreary land White robes of rest and peace; Then do not blame as waste and crime My dead and fruitless hours, For souls must have their winter time As well as streams and flowers. You do not seek anemones In January's dawn, Nor ask for June's sweet harmonies When all the birds are gone; Then do not plead for me to sing A summer melody, When, though the world may call it spring, 'T is winter time with me. GRANDMOTHER'S GARDEN. Grandmother's garden was brave to see, Gorgeous with old-time plants and blooms, All too common and cheap to be Grown in modern parterres and rooms; Old traditional herbs and flowers, Some for pleasure and some for need, Gifted, haply, with wondrous powers,â Root, or petal, or bark, or seed. All old fashions of leaf and root Grew there, cherished for show or use; Currant-bushes with clustered fruit Red as garnets, and full of juice; Tiger-lilies with beaded stalks, Balm, and basil, and bitter rue, Gay nasturtiums and four o'clocksâ Grandmother's garden was fair to view. Pinksâhow rich in their stately prime! Filled the air with a rare delight; Lavender blended with sage and thyme; Lilacs, purple and milky white, Met and mingled and bloomed as one Over the path, they grew so tall; And tulip-torches, in wind and sun, Flamed and flared by the southern wall. Periwinkles with trailing vines, Lordly lilies with creamy tint, Bachelor's buttons and columbines, Proud sweet-williams and odorous mint; Heavy peonies, burning red, Wonders of lush, redundant bloom, Longed for a wider space to spread, And flushed the redder for lack of room. Brilliant asters their prim heads tossed; Dark blue monkshood, and hollyhocks Smiling fearless at autumn's frost, Waved and nodded along the walks; Love-lies-bleeding forever drooped; Disks of sun-flowers, bright and broad, Watched like sentries; and fennel stooped Over immortal Aaron's-rod. Cumfrey, dropping its waxen flowers, Purple gooseberries, over-ripeâ Lady-grass, that I searched for hours, Vainly trying to match a stripe,â Pansies, bordering all the beds, Ladies' delights for the children's sake, Poppies, nodding their sleepy heads, And yellow marigolds wide awake. Morning-glories, whose trumpets rung Resonant with the rifling bees, Daffodils, born when spring was young; Vain narcissus, and gay sweet-peas Clinging close, but with bright wings spread Wide, like butterflies just alight; Gauze-flowers fragile, to sunrise wed, And bashful primrose that bloomed at night. Rich syringas, all honey-sweet, Trim carnations of tenderest pink, Bluebells, spite of the noonday heat Holding dew for the birds to drink: Marjoram, hyssop and caraway, Damask-roses and mignonette; Ah! sometimes at this distant day I can fancy I smell them yet. I have a garden of prouder claims, Full of novelties bright and rare, Modern flowers with stately names Flaunt their wonderful beauty there; Yet in threading its brilliant maze, Oft my heart, with a homesick thrill Whispers, dreaming of early days, âGrandmother's garden was fairer still!â OLD ROSES. There is one I often meet As I pass along the street,â One upon whose furrowed face Three-score years have left their trace, Yet his strong and upright form Has not bowed to wind or storm, Nor his hair, though touched with rime, Fallen beneath the scythe of Time. And I said, the other day, Seeing him across the wayâ Speaking half to one who stood Near me, in a musing moodâ âLo, how lightly, it appears On his forehead fall the years! Youth's unfrozen blood still speaks Eloquently in his cheeks,â âAnd their well-kept ruddiness, Somewhat withered, I confess,â Looks as last year's roses look, Pressed and dried within a book; Still, with all their freshness fled, Keeping all their olden red:â Or, again, it seems to me, As I look more carefully, âLike the wrinkled crimson rind Of the apples which we find, As we peer with curious eyes Into last year's granaries, Or some dusty storehouse, where Hidden from the light and air, They have lain the winter through Losing everything but hue;â âSo, methinks, the withered cheek Of whose rosiness we speak, Keeps, unblanched, the ruddy glow Of the bloom of long ago.â âNay,â spoke one who, waiting, heard Smilingly my every wordâ One whose arch, half-serious eyes Answer ere her voice replies;â âNay,âbethink you,ââthus she said,â âThis is not the lingering red Of his early morning years Which upon his face appears;â â'T is the ruddy sunset gleam Lighting up life's darkening stream, 'T is the slight return which age Makes for youth's lost heritage;â 'T is the light reflected o'er From a brighter, rosier shore; Or, to suit your playful mood With a gay similitude,â âWhen October's yellow hair Brightening all the hazy air, Half disputes her prophecy Of the winter-time to be, You have marked the various hues Which the forest-monarchs choose? You have seen them all arrayed In their robes of light and shade? âWhen the sharp and frosty airs Chill the sweet woods, unawares, And to pallid whiteness bleach All the tresses of the beech, How the elm grows all alight, Sallow with consumptive blightâ And the willow, blanched and sere, Drops its leaves in trembling fear;â âAnd the poplar's faded leaf Quivers with its whispered grief,â While the birch-tree's airy limbs Wave to autumn's funeral-hymnsâ And the oak, with lofty pride Yielding, though unterrified, Tones his glossy greenness down To the dignity of brown;â âBut the maple dons a blush Rosier than the richest flush Which in summer glows and thrills All along the sunrise hills;â Breaking into sudden bloom As from out his sombre tomb Bursts the newborn butterfly Gorgeous with his brilliant dye. âWherefore, trifler, we will say Of the sire across the wayâ He is like the maple tree Growing old so rosilyâ Borrowing nothing from his youthâ Age is wealthier far, in truth; Blooming, when the summer 's past, Brightly, brightlier, to the last!â BED-TIME. The children's bed-time hour struck long ago, But all too short to them the evening seems; They linger by the fire, although they know Their shoes should all be standing in a row, And each bright head be busy with its dreams. They dread the bed's soft chill, the pillow's cold, And make the plea so often made before; With small excuse and pretexts manifold, They stop to hear some well-known story told, Or play, perhaps, some worn-out game once more. Yet in the morning, when the mother's call Rings up the stairway, not a voice replies; Last evening's interests are forgotten all; Each hides his face, or turns it to the wall, Nor once uplifts the lids of sleepy eyes. In vain to tempt them forth to sport and light, The wakening sunbeams through the curtains peep; The world has lost the charm it held last night; Stories, books, games, are all forgotten quite, Nor work nor play is half so sweet as sleep. With shoulders bowed, and aches in every limb, My neighbor stoops beneath his eighty years; Slow is his step, and every sense is dim; How can the world keep any charm for him, Or life be anything but pains and fears? Yet still he grasps it with unyielding hold, And when his hour comes, chooses not to know; Still waits to hear the worn-out stories told, Still counts his gains, still notes the price of gold, And plays the game that tired him long ago. But when he finds, beyond the hap and harm Which ever wait upon this mortal breath, That what he shrunk from, with a vague alarm, Was a kind healer, bringing peace and balmâ He will, mayhap, grow so in love with death, That when the morning-angel's pinions sweep, With wakening touch, across his quiet breast, To rouse him from his slumber soft and deep,â He will but murmur, in his happy sleep, âEven heaven itself is not so sweet as rest!â EYES. In ancient times did valiant minstrel-knight His mistress' visual beauties advertise, Singing their winning radiance lover-wise, Bepraising lavishly their brilliant might, Hoping his skill might win his life's delight; Finding similitudes in morning skies, Likewise in moonlit midnight's duskiest guise. I claim slight kin with singers fierce in fightâ I question thisâif either warbling wight Amid high Chivalry's bright votaries Did, in his rich, inspiring strain, devise This hidden difficulty, which to-night I in this idly-tinkling line compriseâ This simple trifle, bristling thick with Is. AFTERWARD. After all great disturbance falls a calmâ Tornadoes pass, and peaceful rainbows make Heaven fair again, and sea and inland lake Cease raging, and acknowledge beauty's charm, As Nature laughs away all late alarm. Dormant volcanoes, after ages, wake And scare great nations; earthquakes roar and shake, And straightway cease again all jar and harm; And after fate and circumstance have made Disaster, disappointment and despair A heavier load than human heart can bear, Malice and hate at last shall faint and fade, Falsehood's sharp stab shall heal, and faith betrayed Cease paining, after Death has vanquished change and care. POETICAL PATCHWORK. I only know she came and went Lowell. Like troutlets in a pool; Hood. She was a phantom of delight, Wordsworth. And I was like a fool! Eastman. âOne kiss, dear maid,â I said and sighed, Coleridge. âOut of those lips unshorn!â Longfellow. She shook her ringlets round her head, Stoddard. And laughed in merry scorn. Tennyson. Ring out, wild bells, to the wild sky, Tennyson. You hear them, oh my heart? Alice Carey. â'T is twelve at night by the castle clock, Coleridge. Beloved, we must part!â Alice Carey. âCome back, come back,â she cried in grief, Campbell. âMy eyes are dim with tearsâ Bayard Taylor. How shall I live through all the days, Mrs. Osgood. All through a hundred years!â T. S. Perry. 'T was in the prime of summer time Hood. She blest me with her hand, Hoyt. We strayed together, deeply blest, Mrs. Edwards. Into the Dreaming Land. Cornwall. The laughing bridal roses blow Patmore. To dress her dark-brown hair, Bayard Taylor. No maiden may with her compare, Brailsford. Most beautiful, most rare! Read. I clasped it on her sweet cold hand, Browning. The precious golden link, Alex. Smith. I calmed her fears and she was calm,â Coleridge. âDrink, pretty creature, drink!â Wordsworth. And so I won my Genevieve, Coleridge. And walked in Paradise, Hervey. The fairest thing that ever grew Wordsworth. Atween me and the skies! Tennyson. TO THE MOON. Dear pallid vestal, that upbears A cresset tipped with silver fire, At thy behest, earth's fretful cares Abashed by utter peace, retire. Where'er the wretched fall asleep, Wearied at last by life's despair, 'T is sweet that thy pure face will keep Its ever-faithful vigil there! DOCTOR McGEE. In a cosy hotel in great London, G. B., One winter quite lately, Fate chanced to decree I should stay for awhileâand I could but agree. It was not in âthe season,â and consequently There were few fellow-lodgers to speak to, or see. In the coffee-room there (where, quite lucky for me, The guest is by no means restricted from tea, Or chocolate, or milk, but may have them all three, By ringing for Lucy, and biding a weeâ) I noticed one day, on the prim mantel-tree, Between two pink vases of lofty degree,â The servant declared they were âreal Japaneeââ A letter, directed to âDr. McGee, Number sixty-one, Norfolk street, W. C.â In a pretty hand-writing, neat, graceful and free; On the corner was written, as fine as could be, âTo await the arrival of Dr. McGee.â And I absently wondered, while drinking my tea, What manner of man the new-comer would be, Who might drop in, to-morrow, and breakfast with me. But the letter remained thereâtwo days, and then three, A week, two weeks vanished, like foam on the sea, And morn after morn, as I poured out my tea, I glanced at the note on the prim mantel-tree, And pondered and wonderedâand waited to see Why it never was called for by Dr. McGee. Who was he, This Dr. McGee, Who was not where he was expected to be? Was he Doctor of Laws, or a simple M. D.? Or a travelling quack, with extortionate fee? Was he native, or born in some foreign countree? French, Scotch, German, Irish, or wild Cherokee? Or an ill-growing sprig of some noble old tree, With a new name wherever he happened to be? Was he wealthy and gouty, as often we see, Or poor and rheumatic? or youthful, and free From all the sore ailments which time may decree? Was he bluff and big-whiskered, as doctors may be, Or dapper, mild-mannered, and brisk as a flea? Was he curled like Hyperion, or bald as a pea? Would he ever appear and decide it? or be Forever and ever a sealed mystery? Where could he be, Poor Dr. McGee? Had he perished by shipwreck in yonder great sea? Was he ill in some hospital? dying, may be, With no fond friend near to console him, or see That his pillow was smooth, and his breathing-space free, And his medicines given him regularly? It troubled my thoughts, and quite wore upon me, The possible fate of poor Dr. McGee, As day after day came, but never came he. But might it not be That by Fortune's decree, It was joy, and not woe, that kept Dr. McGee? Thus often I mused, in a happier keyâ Perhaps his good star had arisen, and he Of some wealthy nabob was sole legatee, And was counting the worth of an Indian rupee, Or busily reckoning l. s. and d.; Or, as Christmas was coming, and holiday glee Was rife all through England, from centre to sea, Perhaps in some pleasant home drawing-room he Was planning the growth of a tall Christmas-tree, While rosy-cheeked boys and girls, one, two and three Were pulling his whiskers and climbing his knee, Till, entering into their innocent spree, He quite forgot how this poor letter might be Neglected in Norfolk street, W. C. But Christmas departed, with âboxingâ and fee, And the letter that lay on the prim mantel-tree, And that once was as white as the lamb on the leaâ Grew yellow with waitingâas often, ah, me, Befalls those who wait till hope's rosy tints flee. And I left it there still, when I took my last tea, Handed Lucy the coin she expected to see, And paid my last reckoning, and gave up my key, And went to the station at quarter past three. And though I may wander by desert and sea, No matter what marvels may happen to me, I never shall know, wheresoe'er I may be, Who, when, why, or where, about Dr. McGee. A PEWTER TANKARD. William Goold, of Windham, exhibited in the Centennial Department of the Maine State Fair, in 1876, a pewter beer-mug, or tankard, âknown to have been brought from Scotland two hundred years ago.â Two hundred years! oh, grim and ghostly goblet, Why thus torment the thirsty souls of moderns, Moderns who live in times when pewter tankards Linger superfluous? Torn from the land that flows with ale and oat-cake, How in thine age art thou betrayed and stranded Thus high and dry upon the thirsty shores of Maine prohibition! Who would deal out Sebago in a tankard? Or even milkman's milk, pieced out with pump-juice? Pshaw! who would load a cannon with baked apples? Perish the notion! What are the feeble tipples of the present, Hop, pop, root, spruce, and such-like weak devices, By those which, take the centuries together, Thou hast surrounded! Marvellous mug! how many casks and barrels, Yea, more than that, how many hundred hogsheads, Pipes, tuns and what not, hast thou held and carried,â Pale, brown, and home-brewed? Surely they err, who say that drinks convivial Shorten men's lives, and make them weak and shaky; What devotee who pins his faith on water, Reaches thy record? How many hands have grasped thy quaint old handle! How many lips have pressed thy time-worn margin! How many eyes, with foam-drops on their lashes, Looked down thy distance! Thou hast outlived thy natural use and purpose; Ale is a myth, and beer an old tradition; Thou art a phantom, and thine occupation Gone, like Othello's. What is our life? Why do we boast and bluster Even if we count a hundred paltry summers? What are they worth? a trifling pewter tankard Laughs at our utmost. Granite and diamonds shame our short duration, Fine gold outlasts us, and we never wonder, But to be distanced thus by paltry pewter Humbles the proudest. Farewell, old tankard! on the next centennial, Doubtless, some other bard will sing thy praises, Greet thee with eyes and fingers reverential, Even as I do,â Touch thy quaint handle, worn by phantom fingers, Note the small dints along thy battered margin, Then passing on, to die and be forgotten, Leave thee immortal. THE BLIND MAN'S WIFE. She leads him, when the day is fair, Along the smoothest, sunniest street, Choosing the way, with watchful care Before his slow, uncertain feet. She guards him deftly from the throng That crowds before or hastes behind, Guiding him tenderly along Like a lost childâfor he is blind. And day by day, and year by year, She is his staff, his strength, his sightâ The steady planet, shining near, Which cheers and lights his lifelong night. Because she loves him. What beside Could keep her, all the weary days, His helper, savior, slave and guide, Who never thanks her nor repays? Nor slow strong force, nor sudden wrench, Nor both, can such a love discrown, Which many waters cannot quench, Nor floods of hurrying billows drown. He does not see her furrowed face, Her crooked form, her faded hairâ She is to him all bloom and grace, But still more kind than she is fair. Old, feeble, poor, and blind, his whole Of life is darkness, want and pain, Yet rich in that which many a soul More strong and proud, would die to gain. Oh, with a power but faintly told In sweetest tales of prose or rhyme, Love's everlasting arms uphold The heaviest loads of life and time! A CAVALRY PRIVATE. In the green park the grass grows fair and tall, The herbage drips with dew, And from the untrodden places by the wall, The clover lifts pink promise. Seeing all, A starving horse looks through,â A poor gaunt animal, sharp-ribbed and lean, A picture of distressâ On his thin sides are marks where blows have been, And on his shrunken shoulder may be seen The branded signsââU. S.â Sadly he thinks of other summer-tides, When, by the wide barn-doors, The fearless children patted his sleek sides, And chattering merrily of future rides Fed him with apple-cores. No high ambition lured his thoughts away, No dreams of trotting-parks; He only heard the blithesome children sayâ âNext winter he'll be harnessed in the sleigh, And then, oh, then, what larks!â His nerves were living steel;âhis frame replete With lithesomeness and grace;â His bright neck âclothed with thunder,â and his feetâ The very tempest, sweeping fierce and fleet, Could scarce outstrip his pace. Green were the pastures where he used to browse, In youth's elysian prime,â He nipped the pink buds from the apple-boughs Shading some pleasant farm-yard, where the cows Gathered at milking-time,â Lowing responsive to the plaintive bleat Of calves, which waited late, Tethered in tender grass, unmown and sweet, And clover which they had not learned to eat, Inside the orchard gateâ Each pulling wildly at the fettering rope, Stretching his soft neck far, And calling with a sort of piteous hope, For the fair milkmaid's hand the gate to ope, And give him his mamma. There on a low bough hung the milking-stoolâ The throne of innocence;â There, when the summer day grew dusk and cool, The hens repaired, and went to roost by rule, In rows along the fence. Oh, happiness! but on the saddest day That ever gloomed the skies, Some heartless Quarter Master's employÃ© Espied him as he chewed the fragrant hay, And saidââBehold a prize! âThis animal is sound in wind and limb, With every nerve aliveâ Our Uncle Samuel hath need of him; I'll give you, as he seems in extra trim, One hundred twenty-five.â Wherefore he bought and took the horse along, To come alas, no moreâ Leaving the children in a weeping throng, Deploring audibly the bitter wrong, Grouped round the stable door. Gone with his last sweet wisp of home-made hay Depending from his mouthâ Unconscious, as he walks the grassy way, How soon his feet will bruise in fiercest fray, The red fields of the South. Gone with the clover tangled in his mane,â To plough through Southern mud; To make sharp hoof-prints on the battle-plain, To trample madly on the bleeding slain, And bathe his feet in blood. But what a changeâand what a loss! oh, shame! What has he gained therefor? Since in the heyday of his youth, he came, His proud head high, his nostrils breathing flame, Down to the seat of war? His bright, expressive eyes have lost their fire, His humbled head hangs low; His fair and nervous limbs have learned to tire In wading wearily through swamps and mire, Goaded by spur and blow. Oh, battered limbsâoh, dim and hollow eyes, Oh, gaunt and wasted frame! Youth, loved and honoredâage, which all despiseâ Is this the picture held before the eyes Of military fame? âRepublics are ungratefulâ; when, oh, when, Has this been proved a lie? Horses are heroes, too, as well as menâ Why are they used, abused, neglectedâthen Turned in the street to die? The grass waves inaccessible, though nearâ Mocking his longing gazeâ And from the fountain-basin he can hear The tinkling water-drops plash cool and clear, Misting in rainbow sprays. Soon I shall seeâwhen breaks his patient heartâ His gaunt form carried hence, With rigid limbs aimed sky-ward, in a cart, To some grim burial, from the town apart, At government expense! WHAT IS IT? Though I love the charms Of the home-fire bright, I am under arms Both by day and night. Not upon my back Do I bear my loads; Legs I do not lack, Yet avoid the roads. Though I never shun Duty's hard decree, Yet some other one Makes my rounds for me. Kings may standâbut yet A seat is found for me, Though I never sit;â How can these things be? LITTLE LONESOME. She was a timid little maid, Of even harmless things afraid; A hasty word, a sudden stir, A playful touch, would startle her; She feared the lightning, and the rain, The branch that swept against the pane, The ocean's roar, the wind's sad moan, And dreaded to be left alone. And often in her bed at night, She would awake in wild affright, Entreating with appealing tone, âMamma, I cannot stay alone! The shutters groan and rattleâhark! I hear a whisper in the darkâ Oh, come and hold me close and near, Mamma, I am so lonesome here! âThe stars peer in and wink at me; The moon looks ghastly through the tree And shines by fits across the door; The shadows move upon the floor Like living things; the windows creak,â I feel a cold breath on my cheek; The chimney howls, the wind is high, I am so lonesome where I lie!â And then the mother's tender heart Would take the little sufferer's part; Would haste, with reassuring kiss, To soothe her back to quietness; To clasp her fluttering hands, and still The shuddering sob, the nervous thrill, Until her head found happy rest Upon that kind, protecting breast. But others blamed her tenderness, And said, âIndulgence and caress Will harm the child and do her wrong; She never will be brave and strong, If thus you pet her whims and freaks; You should not heed her when she speaksâ Conquer her folly and your own, And let her go to sleep alone.â And so when next she cried at night, Calling in tremulous affright, âMamma, I hear the watch-dogs bark! I am so lonesome in the dark!â The mother heard, with tear-wet face, But closed her lips and kept her place Until the child, too tired to weep Longer, had sobbed herself to sleep. To-night, the eddying snow-flakes whirl Above the sleeping little girl; Her room is dark, her bed is cold, Love cannot warm the frozen mould; Yet still her mother hears the plaint Come through the midnight, far and faint, Half lost amid the tempest's moan,â âMamma, I cannot stay alone! O mamma, come! the wild winds cry, And I am lonesome where I lie!â KNITTING-WORK. I sing in praise of knitting-workâa good old-fashioned theme, Unspoiled as yet by hackneyed phrase, or new-fledged poet's dreamâ Neglected quite, and overlooked, in this progressive day Of bead-work and embroidery, Macrame and crotchet. I grieve to know that young girls now despise the gentle art Which played in ancient housewifery so prominent a partâ I grieve that flimsy fancy-work, of just no use at all, Usurps the place once occupied by knitting-work and ball. Only some good old-fashioned dame, with wrinkled cheek and brow, And kerchief pinned across her breast, like one I'm watching now, With dress of old-time bombazine, and high-crowned muslin cap, Dares flourish an incipient sock above her ancient lap. I mind me of my childish daysâthe vanished heretofore, When I longed to spend the livelong day in playing out-of-door, But, worshipping the practical, my mother made me sit Demurely in my little chair beside her knee, and knit. Knit, till the stated task was doneâand then my work was hid With eager joy and hurried hand, beneath my work-box lidâ And then how gladly forth I sped to join the childish throng, With keener relish for my sport, because deferred so long! I mind me of the evenings since, in girlhood's happy age, Which, knitting-work in hand, I 've passed above a favorite pageâ I almost hear the tinkling sound of needles keeping time To thrilling words of old romance, or poet's ringing rhyme! Once, knitting, thou wert tediousâbut since riper years were mine, I 've met with seamings every way more troublesome than thineâ Found more vexatious wideningsâof care and weariness, And other, sadder, narrowingsâwhere hope grew less and less! A plea for thee, O knitting-workâa warm and earnest plea, For years of gentle intercourse have knit my heart to thee, And often when dim shapes of ill before me darkly rise, I find a sweet nepenthe in thy simple mysteries. A WET WEEK. Rain and drizzle and fog and mist,â Fog and darkness and rainâ Will the shadows lift from the soaking earth, And the sun shine, ever again? Day after day after day after day The clouds roll in and across, As though every mariner out of port Had murdered an albatross. Or as though some pious granger-man, With acres of thirsty grain, Had prayed with too much earnestness For the early and latter rain. For the worst that can befall a man, Be he reckoned with saints or knaves, âAs has proved too true again and againâ Is to give him all he craves. If any one knows the blundering soul Whose prayer was too long and wide, Beg him to open his mouth once more, And pray on the other side. Or if any one knows the fateful bird Who has brought the fog and mist, In spite of Coleridge, or Mr. Bergh, Or any who would resist,â Shoot him with rifle or good cross-bow, Or smite him with fire and sword, And hang him about the stubborn neck Of the obstinate Weather Board! A DECEMBER NIGHT. All day the sky has been one heavy cloud, All day the drops have plashed against the panes, The brimming eaves-spouts gurgled full and loud; And now the night has come, and still it rains. The frosts and rifling winds, those treacherous thieves, Have stripped the shivering branches stark and bare; Beneath, the walks are thick with trodden leaves, Which fill with woodsy odors all the air. Yon street-lamp glows, a disk of luminous fog, Lighting a little space of mud and rain, Where hurrying wayfarer or homeless dog Starts sudden into sight, and fades again. Its faint gleam struggles with the dark, and shows A lonesome door-yard, with its leafless vine, And Monday's luckless washing,ârows on rows Of dripping garments hanging on the line. Along the roadside gutters rush the streams Like turbid rivers in a summer flood; And at the crossings, drivers urge their teams To splash the wroth pedestrian with mud. From far across the harbor, low and faint, A fog-horn's friendly bellow greets the ear; Or some slow, cautious steamer's hoarse complaint, Warning its kindred not to come too near. Small knots of draggled pilgrims stand and wait Upon the muddy curb, and peering far Up street and down in vain, find fault with fate, And sharply blame the dilatory car; Their grouped umbrellas, by the hazy light Obscure and dim, show through the vapors dense Like clumps of toad-stools, born of rain and night, Huddled beside some roadside pasture fence. One ray redeems the dreariness and blight,â The window-light which streams across the square; The light of home,âthe blessed, saving light Which keeps the world from darkness and despair. Ah, happy they who in its warmth abide! Peace sits among them, with her fair wings furled; What care they for this wretched world outside,â This darksome, dismal, drear December world? FESSENDEN'S GARDEN. From this high window, in the twilight dim, I look beyond a lofty garden wall, And see well-ordered walks, and borders trim, With trellised vines and rows of fruit-trees tall. Along the darkling shrubbery where most The garden's olden lord at evening strayed, I half-perceive a silent, stately ghost, Taking dim shape against the denser shade. His footstep makes no rustle in the grass, Nor shakes the tenderest blossom on its stem; The light leaves bend aside to let him pass,â Or is it but the wind that touches them? A statesman, with a grave, reflective air, Once used to walk there, in the shadows sweet; Now the broad apple-trees, his pride and care, Spread their pink carpet wide for alien feet. Beneath those friendly boughs, with thoughts unbent, He found sometimes a respite sweet and brief, Threaded the wandering ways in pleased content, And plucked a flower, or pulled a fragrant leaf;â Twined a stray tendril, lopped a straggling limb, Or raised a spray that drooped across the walk;â Watched unscared birds that shared the shade with him, Saw robins build, or heard the sparrows talk. His native streets now hardly know his name,â And in the world of politics, wherein He toiled so long, and won an honored fame, It is almost as though he had not been. Amid the earnest councils of the land His lofty form, his cold and clear-cut face, His even voice and wise restraining hand Are known no more, and others take his place. Within this haunt of quietude and rest Which for so many years he loved and knew, The bird comes back to build its annual nest, The months return with sun and snow and dew;â Nature lives on, though prince or statesman dies; Thus mockingly these little lives of ours So brief, so transient, seem to emphasize The immortality of birds and flowers! THE BABY'S SMILE. As through the busy street I pass, Often, in sun or rain, I mark some pleasant household group Behind a window-pane; The mother is politely blind, The father does not see, But if a baby face is there, The baby smiles at me. Dear sinless soul of babyhood! She does not coldly wait To ask about my bank-account, Or bonds, or real estate; With small soft face against the pane, And dove-like coo the while, She beckons with her dainty hand, And answers back my smile. She does not scorn my glance because She never heard my name, Nor query of my social place, Nor question whence I came; No tedious rule of etiquette Restrains her loving grace, Or chills the winning smile that lights Her lovely wild-flower face. She knows me by that nameless sense, That wisdom sweet and fine, Which babies have, ere time has spoiled Their innocence divine; That strange, unerring magnetism Which some kind angel sends, By which all sinless things perceive And recognize their friends; The silent sympathy which makes The homeless dog I meet Forget his hungry lonesomeness To fawn about my feet; Which draws the pigeons to my hand, Fearless and trustful still, And makes the social sparrows crowd My friendly window-sill. Ah! though the world seems full, sometimes, Of darkness and of dust, The soul is not quite desolate Which birds and babies trust; Life is not all a wilderness, Made up of grief and guile, While eyes so shadowless and sweet Smile back to eyes that smile! A COUNTRY SCHOOL-HOUSE. I see a picture in the air; A country school-house, low and square, With plain pine desks and dusty floor, And whittlings all about the door; A boyish teacher, young but wise, With gentle face and kindly eyesâ And, faltering through her lessons there, A little girl with yellow hair. How shy she was! what real distress, What conscious sense of awkwardness Burned in quick color on her cheek, When came her dreaded turn to speak! How kind he was! his ready aid Assured her timid soul, and made The path of study plain and sweet Before her hesitating feet. How long, how long ago it seems! Like some fair vision seen in dreams,â That cool bright autumn time of yore, When he, a bashful sophomore, With cheek that changed from pale to red, Taught to a puzzled yellow headâ His youngest pupil, in whose eyes Not Solomon was half so wiseâ Within that country school-room's walls, The mysteries of decimals. Alas, alas! to what intent That labor over rate per cent., And toil at compound interest, By one with nothing to invest? Whose only venture, was, in truth, The vague, sweet hope, the faith of youth, Which early dwindled to its end, Nor paid a single dividend? No school-girl now his peace disturbs By tremulous tilts at nouns and verbsâ Alas, how fast the years have flown! Now he has children of his own, Tall boys in college, girls in trains;â His busy heart no more retains The features of that child of ten, Who made a hero of him then, Than Sandy River keeps, this hour, The face of some wild meadow-flower, Which grew and blossomed, shy and low, Beside it, twenty years ago. Yet it is more than many gain, In this estate of change and pain, To be forever set apart The hero of a thankful heart, Within that temple undefiled, The grateful memory of a child;â To hold, in spite of time and space, So sacred and secure a place As with a truth that naught can dim, Her womanhood still keeps for him. THE SUNSHINE SONG. A little child of three bright years Undimmed by care, unstained by tears,â From whose pure soul was not yet riven The music of its native heaven, Implored and pleaded, oft and long, âO mother, sing the sunshine song!â The mother sang full many an air, The gay, the sad, the sweet, the rare, But none could please the listening child, Who shook her head, and sadly smiled, As one who chides a grievous wrong, âO mother, sing the sunshine song!â âAlas!â the mother's voice replies, While tears drop softly from her eyes,â âI know it not,âI never heard The sunshine song, my singing-bird!â Yet still she pleaded, oft and long, âO mother, sing the sunshine song!â Spring came; and ere its reign was past, The child's sweet life was ebbing fast; And through her long delirious hours Her lispings were of bees and flowers, Mingled and saddened, all night long, With pleadings for the sunshine song. Hours passed; and on her mother's knee The child lay dying; suddenly She clasped her little faded hands,â âO mother, hear!âthose shining bandsâ âThe tune I 've waited for so long,â Mother, they sing the sunshine song!â The lifted hands fell feebly down,â Death's white hand rested like a crown Upon her brow;âin holy grace Her face was an angel's face; And she had joined the seraph-throng Who sing, in heaven, the sunshine song. TO CASCO BAY. Beautiful bay! I gladly fly Down to the shore where your waves beat high,â There 's nobody here but you and me, Nobody here to hear or see, Our only guests are the birds and the wind, The waves before and the cliff behind, And the rocks are steep and hard to climb, So none will intrude on our breathing-time, And all to ourselves we will have the day, Beautiful Casco Bay! Tired of the town, with its selfish hearts, Its vain pretences and ill-played parts, The crush of streets and the strife of marts, The roll of coaches and rattle of carts,â And stifled beneath a worldly crust, Deafened with noise and choked with dust, My heart is a bird in the fowler's trap, Or a butterfly caught in a schoolboy's cap,â And I long to be free, as I am to-day, Beautiful Casco Bay! Come, tell me some of the tales you know, The ocean legends of long ago,â The stories told by in-coming waves, Of wrecking tempests and foamy graves, Of booming billows and shattered ships, And vain prayers strangled on ashy lips;â I 've heard you echo them o'er and o'er, With a mournful wail to the saddened shore, Though now so gladly your waters play, Beautiful Casco Bay! I love your voice as I hear it come Like a chorus grand, through the city's hum, Thrilling the fine electric chain That binds me to Nature's heart, againâ That heart whose current flows wide and far, Whose ceaseless throbbings your billows are,â And my truant soul comes back to me When your leafless forest of masts I see, And I fling my handful of cares away, Beautiful Casco Bay! Adieu! I goâand beneath the roar Of your headlong waves on the rocky shore, In the surf-tossed sea-weed and broken shells, I hear a murmur of soft farewells;â I shall love you still with a worship true, And this wide bright reach of tossing blue, This sparkling plain, where the gazer sees The snowy-white sails blossom out in the breeze, Will live in my heart for many a day, Beautiful Casco Bay! A REBUS. My first soars gladly from the earth, On dawning's dewy wings, Viewing the morning's beamy birth, The star's last glimmerings. One of the few who sing for joy, And are not taught by pain, My first permits no sad alloy, To mingle with his strain. A horseman dashes o'er the plain, With mad and headlong speed;â With nostrils spread, and flying mane, Sweeps on the noble steed; As flies the tempest in its might, As meteors cleave the sky;â My second prompts his foaming flight, And fires his flashing eye. My whole lay trembling on my breast, When summer's morn was bright, But ere the sunset charmed the west, The blue eyes lost their light. I yielded it with fond regret, Ere I had loved it longâ But ah, its spirit lingers yet, In poet's sweetest song! HAUNTED HOUSES. All houses wherein rats and mice abide Are haunted houses. Through the open doors The cunning thieves upon their errands glide, Making a hasty scratching on the floors. We meet them in the chamber, on the stair, Along the passages they come and go; Their twinkling eyes are peering everywhere, As hurriedly they scamper to and fro. The house has far more inmates than the hosts Invited; cellar, pantry, kitchen, hall, Are thronged with nibblers, which the scent of roasts Has tempted from their strongholds in the wall. The stranger at my fireside may not see The forms I seeâand if strange sounds he hear, Ascribes them to the windâbut unto me The real cause is visible and clear. Among the cupboard's spoons and cruet-stands, They keep the revels which the housewife hatesâ From holes unnoticed swarm in thievish bands, And hold high jinks with teacups, bowls and plates. The garret's dusty, dim circumference Is where they most do congregateâfor there Rubbish in piles, and cobwebs dark and dense Shut out intruders and the daylight's glare. Their little lives are kept in equipoise By opposite incentives and desiresâ The struggle of the daring that destroys, And the instinctive cowardice that fears. The perturbations, the perpetual jar Of scampering rodents, bent on robbery, Come from the attic, where by moon and star, They, undiscovered, plan it secretly; And as the moon, from some dark, cavernous cloud, Flings down to us a floating bridge of light, Across whose trembling beams our fancies crowd, Into the vague uncertainty and nightâ So, from the attic story, there descends A flight of stairs, connecting it with this, And racing up and down, my long-tailed friends Affright the night with antics numberless. WOUNDED. June's loving presence fills these green-arched glooms; From broad-leaved branches, drooping cool and low, Drop down the purple-veined catalpa-blooms, Chasing each other lightly to and fro, As dainty as new snow. The great ripe roses nodding by the way, Drunken and drowsy with their own perfume, Heed not that bee and butterfly all day Make in their very hearts a banquet-room, And rob their royal bloom. The chestnut lights her mimic chandeliers, The tulip-tree uplifts her goblets high, The pine and fir shed balmy incense-tears, And the magnolia's thick white petals lie Expiring fragrantly. The silver poplar's pearl-and-emerald sheen Glimmers incessant, shadowing the eaves; The willow's wide, fair fountain-fall of green Whispers like rain; a pulse of gladness heaves The world of waving leaves. In yonder room that fronts the dusty street, Hushed and white-bedded, curtained cool and dim, There lies as brave a heart as ever beat, Bound down and tortured by a shattered limbâ Ah! what is June to him? To him, poor homesick sufferer, how fair Would be this wealth of bloom, this sunny sky, These gushing sparrow-songs, this gracious air! Yet he, with stronger right to all than I, Pines in captivity. With breath of cannon hot upon his brow, In glorious strife it had been sweet to die; But no ennobling purpose fires him now; His soul is nerved by no proud battle-cry To this long agony. What was the boldest charge, the bloodiest fight, The wildest rally over heaps of slain, To this unequal contest, day and night, With the fierce legions of disease and pain, Repulsed so oft in vain? Heroic was the bravery that inspired His heart to daring deeds; but nobler still This bravery of strong patience, which, untired, Waits calmly, while the tedious months fulfil Their work of good or ill. Sacred we hold their names, who in the strife Of righteous warâour nation's noblest sonsâ Have done their work and given up their life Amid the smoke and thunder of the guns, Beloved and honored ones! And thou, brave heart, although no trumpet breath Proclaims thee martyr, yet thy name shall be Hallowed as these; for even more than death O hero, hast thou suffered patiently For right and liberty! A DEMOLISHED HOMESTEAD. We rail at Time for spoiling what we prize, But mild and gradual is his strong control; His rudest touch but charms and sanctifies, His changes bring no shock to sense or soul. Seldom by Time are razed the sacred shrines Of local love and neighborhood renown; Improvement blasts them with her new designs, And Traffic's grasping talons dig them down. Fond, faithful hearts which will not understand The change that wounds and wrongs their constant truth, Grieve that to-day, with sacrilegious hand, Removes the ancient landmarks of their youth. By Trade and Greed our idols are displaced; Not one is safe from their destructive clutch; Rudely they lay our pleasant places waste, Blighting all beauty with their fatal touch. Where once were murmuring depths of waving leaves, A mossy roof, and household love and mirth, The cable creaks, the derrick groans and heaves, The pick-axe quarrels with the unwilling earth: They ruin and uproot all olden grace, All precious memories which our youth has known, Old homes, old treesâand give us in their place Huge heaps of rectilinear brick and stone. Surely the dim and unregarded ghosts Of those who used these pleasant shades to range, Come up at night out of their misty coasts, And wring their spectral hands above the change! HER ANSWER. âI think I have heard you rightly, And this way the matter stands; You aim to become my master, As you are of your gold and landsâ You wish me to fawn and follow, And serve you with fettered handsâ âTo flaunt in your flimsy finery, To starve in your hollow stateâ To enter a life of falsehood Through a false and lying gateâ To dwarf my heart for diamonds, And peril my soul for plate. âA modest and generous offer, Which only a man could make! So this is the burden of duties You wish me to stoop and take? Nor fear that my strength might falter, Nor dread that my heart might break? âYour wife! it were too much honor! Pray, what is your wife to be? The slave of your whim and bounty, The pet of your luxuryâ A careful, obsequious servantâ Is the picture at all like me? âI know how you reckoned your chancesâ Your wooing has shown me thatâ âShe is poorâI will make her wealthyââ Oh, joy to be wondered at! But you are a monstrous camel, While poverty 's only a gnat! âIf women are only insectsâ Poor, insignificant things,â I am not a cricket, that always By the fire-place sits and sings, But a chrysalis, unexpanded, Impatient for promised wings. âThere are various minor trifles Not even your gold can gainâ You cannot imprison the sunlight, You cannot compel the rainâ And I am more wilful than eitherâ You flatter and sue in vain! âAway with your gilded fettersâ They rattle, although they shineâ The goblet of bliss you offer, Smacks strongly of poisoned wine; Your ring is too small for my finger, Your life is too narrow for mine!â HE CAME TOO LATE. He came too late! The toast had dried Before the fire too long,â The cakes were scorched upon the side, And everything was wrong. She scorned to wait till dark for one Who lingered on his way, And so she took her tea alone, And cleared the things away. He came too late! At once he felt The supper hour was o'er;â Indifference in her calm smile dweltâ She closed the cupboard door! The table-cloth was put away, No dishes could he see;â She met him and her words were gay, She never spoke of tea! He came too late! the subtle cords Of patience were unbound,â Not by offence of spoken words, But by the slights that wound. She knew he could say nothing now That could the past repay,â She bade him go and milk the cow, And coldly turned away! He came too late! The fragrant steam Of tea had long since flown, The flies had fallen in the cream, The bread was cold as stone. And when with word and smile he tried His hungry state to prove, She nerved her heart with woman's pride, And never deigned to move! WRITING TO ORDER. âDear friend, if I could only sing like you, My life would be one dream of rare delight; I would not cease my song the whole year through, But keep the sweet verse flowing day and night; Come, weave a poem just for me, to-dayâ Indeed, dear friend, you cannot say me nay!â Write you a poem? is there no escape? Must I sit down and spin a narrow verse As one would measure off a yard of tape? Mark the result! no stanzas could be worse Than these, to which laboriously I bend, Only to pleasure my exacting friend. Say, can you guide the spirits of the air, Or have the rainbow come before the shower? Or tell the clouds what color they shall wear, Or help the gradual budding of a flower? Or call the robins back before they choose, Hurry the sunset, or bring down the dews? Can you command the planets where they roll, Or speak a nebulous world to sudden prime? Or force the tides to own your small control, Or bid a rosebud bloom before its time? Or make the brook run faster at your word, Or regulate the warbling of a bird? Or make the morn unclose her golden bars Before her hour, to let the daylight in? Haste the appointed rising of the stars, Or show them when their annual rounds begin? Or cause the auroral lights to fade or glow, Or tell the meteors which way to go? âNo!â is the wondering answer which you send Back to my queries, with indignant flashâ âRule Nature? no!â But I assure you, friend, He who should dare all this, were not more rash Than you, who would attempt to rule for me The power whose shadowing forth is poesy. For he is wilful as the wandering air;â Ay, as capricious as the winds that blow; Sometimes I seek him vainly everywhereâ Anon he comes, and stays, and will not go; Unwon by prayers, or tears, or love, or gold, Both hard to drive away and hard to hold. Sometimes he comes with airy retinue Of rare conceits, and fancies sweet and strange, And dainty dreamings; and the long hours through, He rings upon my heart their every change, While I walk charmed and haunted all the day, Until the fair enchantment fades away, And he is gone, as lightning leaves the sky; Whither, who knows? I may not call him back, Or if I call, he comes not; I might cry And wring my hands, and drape myself in black, But he would fling defiance from afar; I might as well entreat a shooting star. And days go by, but he is absent still, Perhaps to visit other hearts than mine; No inspirations then my pulses thrill, I cannot braid a verse, or weave a line, Or catch the strain that charmed me while I slept; My soul is silent as a harp unswept. And so I wait. Not now with toil and pain I try to win him back, and plead with him, And blame myself, and bruise my barren brain Against his lordly will or freakish whim,â For I have learned mute patience, knowing when My master pleases, he will come again. So, friend, forgive this stubborn pen of mine, It will not always yield to my behest; The summer firefly can not always shineâ The roses have the winter-time to restâ The sparrow does not warble all the year, And why should I, who have so few to hear? THE FACT AND THE REPORT. A Portland Version of âthe Ring and the Book.â Live fact deadened down, Talked over, bruited abroad, whispered away. Robert Browning. I. THE FACTS IN THE CASE. Bessie, little damsel fair, Whom this truthful tale concerns, With her blondest of blonde hair, Always minding one of Burns' âLassie wi' the lint-white locksââ Bessie, by some oversight, Had an accident, that shocks Pen and paper to recite. One unlucky day last week, She, in playing hide and seek, Climbed the grape-vine lattice-work;â And, to run and reach the goal, Jumped off with a dreadful jerk Fit to sever sense and soul. Landing on the frozen ground In a little aching heap, Presently poor Bessie found She had made a costly leap; Broken by that dreadful hurt, One poor ankle hung inert: Twisted somehow, both the bones Snapped like pipe-stems; and her groans Called her playmates, half afraid And half doubtful, to her aid,â Two of whom, with careful tread, Hopped her slowly home to bed. II. WHAT THE NEIGHBORS SAID. âThere! that child has got a bump! She 's a lively one to jumpâ Climbing wall and fence and roof, Never scared, and tumble-proof; Anybody would have said 'T is a marvel, in its way, That she did not break her head, Or her neck, before to-day.â III. THE RESULTING CIRCUMSTANCES. Bessie, though laid up in splints, Dreaded much the public printsâ Did not wish this mournful tale Carried up and down by mail; âNo,â said Bessie, âhow 't would look! No young lady in a book Breaks her leg while rompingâno, Do not have it published so In the papers' local news!â So her friends, who shared her views, Pitying her bashfulness, Wrote the story out like this: IV. THE NEWSPAPER VERSION. Pretty little Bessie B., Sat one morning quietly Hemming, by her mother's side, Kitchen towels, long and wide, Making labor do for sport, Singing softly âHold the fort.â Ah, 't was an unlucky day! With no warning creak at all, Suddenly her chair gave way, And poor Bessie caught a fall. Down she went, with dreadful jar, And, alas, untoward fate! Tibia and fibula Cracked off short beneath her weight. Now poor Bessie lies and groans, With no color in her cheeks, Kept in bed by broken bones, Caged for six or seven weeks. V. COMMENT OF THE READER. Why should such a lovely child, Meek, industrious, quiet, mild, Sweet, domestic, musical, Suffer from a dreadful fall? Had she been like some we meet, Always romping in the street, Like a tomboy wild and rude, Never trying to be goodâ Been as many others are, Less obedient to her ma, Less deserving of esteem, Less afraid of doing wrong, Less industrious at her seam, Less religious in her song, Less fastidious in her verse, Things could not have happened worse! VI. VERDICT OF THE PUBLIC. Gentlest ways and blondest curls Cannot alter Fate's intents, And the nicest little girls Meet, sometimes, with accidents. MUNJOY HILL. When, years ago, along the hill I wandered, in the twilight still, There, where the waters meet the land, The waves ran lightly up the sand, And old as time, but ever new, Sang their soft songââForever true!â Again I pace, with footsteps slow, The pleasant haunt of long ago, And note how time has wrought its spell On all the scenes beloved so well, Where gradual growth, and loss, and change, Make half the landscape new and strange. Remembered trees no more are seen, New boundaries check the stretches green; New roofs and chimneys sharply rise Against the old familiar skiesâ And nothing, save the constant sea, Remains as then it used to be. The very faces in the street Are changed from those I used to meet; Only the fickle, varying sea Has kept its vow of constancy, And murmurs still, the gloaming through, The same old vowââForever true!â AFTERGLOW. To one abstruse conundrum much serious thought I giveâ Why is it that the good men die, and all the bad ones live? Or why is it we never know our neighbor's rare perfections Till his last will and testament is read to his connections? Ah, then the daily papers spread his virtues all abroad: They say he was âan honest manâthe noblest work of God;â How good he was, how wise he was, how honest in his dealingâ What tenderness of heart he had, and what a depth of feeling! Perhaps the man was one of thoseâah, would that they were fewer! Who all his life ground hard and close the faces of the poor; Who drove his debtors to despair by premature foreclosure, Then paid his pew-rent in advance, with infinite composure. Perhaps he was the lordly âheadâ of some unhappy place Called âhomeâ by use and courtesy, but lacking all its grace; Who held his children criminals for every trifling error, Who pinched his household half to death, and kept his wife in terror. Perhaps he was a lawyer deep, whose quibbling tricks and words Helped base executors to rob poor widows of their thirds; Perhaps a thrifty grocer-man, whose wheedling, false palaver Sold toughest steak for porter-house, and chicory for Java. Perhaps he was a husband who, through all his married life, Regarded honor, faith and truth as dutiesâof his wifeâ And strove his sidewise discipline beyond the grave to carry, By threats to leave her penniless if she should dare remarry. Any of these he might have beenâthe types are nowise rareâ But when he dies, behold, we passed an angel unaware! Since type and tongue proclaim his worth, what cynic shall dispute them? âMany there be who meet the gods,â we read, âbut few salute them!â Why don't the papers say fine things of men before they die, And indicate these saintly souls ere yet they soar on high? Then we might recognize them ere grim death and âcold obstructionâ Have made it quite impossible to get an introduction. Ah, wellâperhaps when I at last beneath my burden faint, I, too, shall win the title of a paragon and saint, And be, when death's cold breath has blown aside life's dust and soiling, A grain of that superior salt which keeps the world from spoiling! MADGE MILLER. Madge Miller, on a summer day, Walked, as usual, her pleasant way. Her dress was tidy, her apron white; Her face was sweet as the morning light. She was a simple village maid Learning a country milliner's trade. Her hands were soft, and her dress was clean, And little she knew what care might mean. She said, âI'll work at my pretty trade, And live a happy and free old maid. âLovers may come and lovers may go, I'll have none of them, no, no, no!â But a suitor came with a tall silk hat; He told her a story worth two of thatâ The same old story by lovers told Since first the earth out of chaos rolledâ (Let us kindly hope, who are old and wise, He did not know he was telling lies.) âMarry me, darling, and you shall be The happiest woman on land or sea. âNo longer then will you have to go To your daily labor through heat or snow. âIt shall be my pleasure, my law, my life, To make you a blest and happy wife. âMarry me, and you never shall know A sorrow or hardship, a care or woe!â She heard the story of promised blissâ She waited, wavered, and answered âYes!â Bright and big was the honey-moon, But clouded by worldly care too soon. For housework led her its weary roundâ Her feet were tethered, her hands were bound. And children came with their shrill demands, And fettered closer her burdened hands. In her husband's house she came to be A servant in all but salary. All her days, whether foul or fair, Were endless circles of work and care; And half her nightsâas up and down She walked the floor in her dressing-gown, Hushing an ailing infant's screams, Lest it should break its father's dreams; Or coaxed and doctored a sobbing child, By the pangs of ear-ache driven wildâ Were seasons of wakeful, nervous dreadâ So if at last o'er her aching head The angel of slumber chanced to stoop, He brought her visions of mumps or croup; And she rose unrested, and went once more Through the dull routine of the day before. Week by week did she drudge and toil And stew and pickle, and roast and boil, And wash the dishes, and rub the knivesâ The lofty mission of duteous wivesâ And scrub, and iron, and sweep, and cook, Her only reading a recipe-book,â And bathe the children, and brush their locks, Button their aprons and pin their frocks, And patch old garments, and darn and mendâ Oh! weary worry that has no end! She lost her airy and sportive ways, The pretty charm of her girlish daysâ For how can a playful fancy rove When one is chained to a cooking-stove? Her face was old ere she reached her prime, Faded and care-worn before its time. Sometimes would her well-kept husband look Up from the page of his paper or book, And note how the bloom had left her face, And a pallid thinness won its placeâ How gray had mixed with her locks of brown, And her forehead gained a growing frown, And say, âShe is ugly, I declareâ I wonder I ever could think her fair!â Season by season, year by year, Did she follow the round of âwoman's sphere,â Nor vexed her husband's days or nights, By any mention of woman's rights, Till she did at lastâtoo sorely triedâ Her life's one selfish deedâshe died. Proud and happy and quite content With the slavish way her days were spent? Feeling, of course, that her life was lost Nobly, in saving a servant's cost? Once, he fancied, her dim ghost spoke Out of its cloud of kitchen smokeâ âWhy did I leave my girlish life To be a dowdy and drudging wife? âI might have followed my tasteful trade, And lived a happy and free old maidâ âOr taught a school, as I had before, Or been a clerk in a dry-goods storeâ âOr reigned a trim, white-handed queen, Over a dutiful sewing-machineâ âAnd earned my living, and some small praise, In any one of these easier ways. âNo other servants than wives, I think, Work for nothing but food and drink, âA prisoning âhomeâ like this I know, And a semi-annual calico. âNo other employer, dame or man, Makes life so hard as a husband can. âAh, me! what curses are on his head Who wooes a woman and does not wed! âO mourning damsels, who pine and cry For fickle lovers, who vow and fly, âHeal your heart-aches, and soothe your woes With the hard-earned wisdom of one who knows: âSmall reason have you to blame or rue The lover who does not marry you! âAh! of all sad thoughts of women or men The saddest is this, âIt need n't have been!ââ TO-MORROW. Oh, when shall we welcome that era of glory Foreshadowed since ages of old, That season so fondly in vision and story By prophet and siren foretold? Our hearts, when with gloomy forebodings grown cold, New hope from the prophecy borrow, For pain shall be solaced and grief be consoled, And life be enjoymentâto-morrow! To-morrow!âto-morrow! Hope's burden is ever âTo-morrow!â That wonderful dawning, oh, when shall we know it? Which dreamers have looked for so long? That jubilee morning by preacher and poet So lauded in sermon and song? When labor and care, with their wearisome throng, Shall vanish with trouble and sorrow, When love shall reign ruler, and right shall be strong, And youth be immortalâto-morrow! To-morrow!âto-morrow! Hope's burden is ever âTo-morrow!â MORNING-GLORIES. O dainty daughters of the dawnâmost delicate of flowers, How fitly do ye come to deck day's most delicious hours! Evoked by morning's earliest breath, your fragile cups unfold Before the light has cleft the sky, or edged the world with gold,â Before luxurious butterflies and moths are yet astir, Before the heedless breeze has snapped the leaf-hung gossamer, While spherÃ©d dew-drops, yet unquaffed by thirsty insect-thieves, Broider with rows of diamonds the edges of the leaves. Ye drink from day's o'erflowing brim, nor ever dream of noon; With bashful nod ye greet the sun, whose flattery scorches soon; Your trumpets trembling to the touch of humming-bird and bee, In tender trepidation sweet, and fair timidity. No flowers in all the garden have so wide a choice of hue, The deepest purple dyes are yoursâthe tenderest tints of blueâ While some are colorless as lightâsome flushed incarnadine, And some are clouded crimson, like a goblet stained with wine. Ye hold not in your calm cool hearts the passion of the rose, Ye do not own the haughty pride the regal lily knows, But ah, no blossom has the charm, the purity of this, Which shrinks before the tenderest love, and dies beneath a kiss. In this wide garden of the world, where he is wise who knows The bramble from the sweet-brier, the nettle from the rose, Some lives there are which seem like these, as sensitive and fair, As far from thought of sin and shame, as free from soil of care. We find sometimes these splendid souls, when all our world is young, When life is crisp with freshness, with unshaken dew-drops hung; They blossom in the cool dim hours, when all is still and fair, But cease and vanish long before the noonday's heat and glare. And if in manhood's dusty time, fatigued with toil and glow, We crave the fresh, young morning-heart which charmed us long ago, We seek in vain the olden ways, the shadows moist and fair, The heart-shaped leaves may linger, but the blossom is not there. LIZZIE. Dear little dark-eyed namesake! The summers are all too few Since she brightened with graceful wearing The name that my childhood knew. I hoped it would crown her with sunshine Fairer than ever smiled; I said it should bring her a blessingâ Dear little dark-eyed child! I said it should bring her a blessingâ Was I wiser than I guessed? Was the blessing a long sweet childhood, And an early and happy rest? For the loving circle that held her Is robbed of its precious pearl; The youngest, the fairest, the darling;â Dear little dark-eyed girl! She stood where the path of childhoodâ A lane through a flowery woodâ Led out to the wide, dim distance Of perilous womanhood;â Woman or angel?âThe future Like a question before her lay; What wonder she paused and faltered, And chose the easier way? Not for her are the crosses And bonds of a woman's life, Nor the burdens and costly blessings Which cling to the name of wife; Nor labor, nor doubt, nor anguish, Nor the great world's dusty whirl; Not one of them touched her garmentâ Dear little dark-eyed girl! Timidly leaning always On the hearts which loved her best, Sheltered from every sorrow, She dwelt in the warm home nest; Never a grief came near her, Nor trial nor loss she bore, And none in the home that holds her, Shall find her forevermore! O fair and fetterless spirit! The name that my childhood knew, Though rarely I hear it spoken, Is sweeter because of you! What matter how little value On earth to the name be given, Since now it is worn by an angel, 'T is tenderly breathed in heaven? BERTIE. All winter, walking up and down, I met him every day, And watched his beauty with delightâ A merry boy at play. His tender face was rosy fair, A winsome face to kiss; âA happy mother she,â I said, âWho owns a child like this!â I was a strangerâstill he learned To know my face at last, And met my greeting with a smile Of welcome as I passed. His curls danced brightly in the wind, His laugh rang sweet and far, His soft brown eyes were frank and clear As babes' or angels' are. One day I did not hear his voice In the accustomed place; I sought in vain his dancing curlsâ I missed his happy face; And yesterday the cruel words I read with bitter pain, Which told me I should never see His lovely eyes again. The street is full of children stillâ They run and laugh and call, But yet I miss the shy sweet face I prized above them all; And I shall walk my morning way Alas, a weary while, Ere I forget the lovely boy Who gave me smile for smile. GRACIE WITH THE GOLDEN HAIR. Is she not exceeding fair, Gracie with the golden hair Floating round her, like the haze Of the Indian summer days? Just a baby undefiled, Dancing, dimpled, darling child! Is she not exceeding fair, Gracie with the golden hair? Two short years hath Gracie stayed In this world of shine and shade, And her life has been as blest As a young bird's in its nest, Shielded safe from want and fear, By the hearts which hold her dear,â Wholly happy, unaware,â Gracie with the golden hair. Never to herself she saith, âWherefore life?â or âWherefore death?â Gracie leaves these queries dread To some graver, older head; Longing for no morrow's rays, Mourning for no yesterdays, She hath neither doubt nor care, Gracie with the golden hair. Yet sometimes a thoughtful shade Falls athwart the little maid, And a tender sadness lies, Deep within her gentle eyes; But she smiles again ere long, Carolling her merriest song, Like a sparrow in the air, Gracie with the golden hair. Gracie hath a cherub face, Full of sweet, unworldly grace; Gracie's eyes are tenderest blue, Limpid as a drop of dew; And her cheek, so pure it shows, Seemeth like a fresh white rose. Is she not exceeding fair, Gracie with the golden hair? And if Gracie, though she seems Like the shapes in holy dreams, Be not quite an angel yet, Wherefore should we feel regret? For our hearts would all be riven, Should she fly away to heaven;â Ah, our souls could never spare Gracie with the golden hair! NED. Who knew of little Ned? Who cared a straw for him, alive or dead? Ned, with his ebon face, A wretched scion of a wretched race, A worthless life gone down Unnoticed, in an over-crowded town. Scanty and poor the food His mother's labor gave her hungry brood, Windowless, dingy, dim, Was the poor hovel which was home to him; Improvidence and chance Ruled there, with poverty and ignorance. Often, as he passed by, I smiled again into his smiling eye, Or gave, to his delight, String for his ball, or paper for his kite, And oftentimes, poor Ned! That which he needed more than playthings,âbread. His poor pretence of dress Was worn and rent to utter raggedness, Yet in the summer street, He played with children gaily dressed and neat, Who did not keep in sight The bridgeless gulf dividing black and white. They shared the self-same plays, Bounding and shouting through the sunny days, Nor ever seemed to care Which dingy hand, if washed, would be most fair; Until the fall of night Ended the games which only ceased with light. They used to find their rest In pleasant homes, with love and plenty blest, Where, all refreshed and soothed, Their tired limbs bathed, their tangled tresses smoothed, They nestled, all the night, In cool, soft beds, with pillows dainty white. But he, poor little Ned, A heap of tattered rags was all his bed; And want and squalor kept Watch in the crowded chamber while he slept,â The atmosphere defiled Poisoning the slumbers of the hapless child. He played the summer through, And autumn came; November rain-storms blew, And in the blasts unkind, Shivering, half-clad, the child grew ill and pined, Forgot his wonted mirth, And cowered all day beside the cheerless hearth. Roundness and smiles forsook His thinning cheek; a suffering, patient look Touched with a piteous grace His wide and wistful eyes, his small, dark face; As ever asking, âWhy? Does life mean only to endureâand die?â Days passed; and now no more He joined the noisy group around the door, Yet ever kept in sight His sorry playthingsâball and hoop and kiteâ Sighing, âAnother day I shall be well enough to go and play.â Alas, poor stricken Ned! All night he shivered in his meagre bed, And weary day by day The fever came and burned his strength away; Fate left him naught to choose; A life so wretched was not much to lose. Even at his poor life's end, He asked for me,âfor I had been his friend; And with the uttered name, His trembling soul wentâwhither?âwhence it came; Some happier sphere to find, Where angels, let us hope, are color-blind. Small is the meed I claim Of worldly gratitude, or praise, or fame, Yet it is something worth, That he, the poorest, humblest of the earth, Passed through death's brief eclipse, Bearing my name upon his grateful lips. Ah, well, what mattered it? This poor, pinched soul which no one prized a whit? One more small life gone down Uncounted, in a sickly southern town; Ah, me! I wonder why A being so forlorn should live and die? WINNIE. In a home-nest of peace and joy, Bright and pleasant as home can be, Lives a merry and sweet-faced boy, Under a broad old apple tree; Searching wide, you will seldom meet Child so blithesome and fair as he, How can he help being pretty and sweet, Dwelling under an apple tree? In the spring when the child goes out, Glad as a bird that winter 's past, Making his flower-beds all about, Liking best what he finished last; Then the tree from each blossomy limb, Heaps its petals about his feet, And like a benison over him Scatters its fragrances, sweet to sweet. He has only to smile and win; Face more lovely was never kissed; Dear blue eyes and a dimpled chin, Curls that dance in a golden mist; Circled ever by tenderest care, Taught and guided by love's decree, How can he help being good and fair, Dwelling under an apple tree? In the summer the dear old tree Spreads above him its cooling shade, Keeping the heat from his cheek while he Playing at toil with rake and spade, Chasing the humming-birds' gleam and dart, Watching the honey-bees drink and doze, Gathers in body and soul and heart, Beauty and health, like an opening rose. In the autumn, before the leaves Lose their greenness, the apples fall, Roll on the roof and bounce from the eaves, Pile on the porch, and rest on the wall; Then he heaps on the grassy ground Rosy pyramids brave to see; How can he help being ruddy and sound, Dwelling under an apple tree? In the winter, when winds are wild, Then, still faithful, the sturdy tree Keeps its watch o'er the darling child, Telling him tales of the May to be; Teaching him faith under stormy skies, Bidding him trust when he cannot see; How can he help being happy and wise, Dwelling under an apple tree? THE SPAN-WORM. A MELANCHOLY MEASURE. Just at the dawn of the heated term, Begins the reign of the measuring worm; From the roadside branches he spins and swings, Hanging and wriggling on gossamer strings; Lengthening slowly the swaying threads, He drops and clings on the passers' heads, And, happy as in his native leaves, Crawls under their collars and up their sleeves,â Or, reaching the ground with a sudden jerk, Collects his wits and begins his work. A singular fondness the creature shows For measuring every step he goes; Stretching at length, he halts and dreams, Then brings together his two extremes, (Like a withered tendril curled and brown, Or a letter U turned upside down,) Then reaching forward his length once more, And doubling up as he did before, He measures the fences, the ground, the wall, Wherever he happens to swing or fall, And seems to add up the distance sped, And keep the reckoning in his head. Think of the labor to count and count, Add all together and keep the amount! Think of his rage, when a footstep's fall Startles and makes him forget it all, And he with wearisome toil and pain, Must measure the space all over again! Most uncivil of engineers, What do you care for tar or tears? In every curtain of leaves you lurk, And ply your dreadful dimension-work; Credulous folly it is to think Of barring your progress with printer's ink; How shall we check, evade or flee Your geometrical industry? When island parties go down the bay, You vex and trouble the happy day; When thirst distresses or hunger mocks The seeker of shells and scaler of rocks, You twist and wriggle and squirm and roll In the tempting midst of his chowder-bowl; Happy he, if its lowest dregs Be not made up of your skin and legs. Geometrid, perform your will; Compass the width of the window-sill, Crawl on the table, if you wish, In butter-cooler and sugar-dish; Measure the pillow-case at night, But keep from the elms your gnawing blight; In the words by George P. Morris sung To the man with a hatchet, when time was young, O worm of the genus PhalÃ¦nidÃ¦, Inch-worm insatiate, spare that tree! THE CATERPILLAR. The caterpillar gnaws his way The mellow summer through, And though he spoils the cabbage-plants, And rasps the rose-buds, too, He has some small redeeming traits, Albeit but a few. With numerous acquaintances, He is not rich in friends; No personal attractiveness To him its glamour lends; About the middle he is brown, And black at both the ends. So, though his foes, the gardeners, May swear about his sins, One beauty of his character Our approbation wins,â The virtue of consistencyâ He ends as he begins! Should lifted foot or hoe approach, To crush him for his crimes, Or should a sudden shower o- vertake him where he climbs, He rolls himself into a ball, And waits for better times. How fortunate, could larger lives But learn this simple featâ Could we achieve, when on our heads Financial tempests beat, The grace and skill which he displays In making both ends meet! He wears his furs all through dog-days, Despite the sultriness, But when the frosty weather comesâ Strange metamorphosis!â He throws his fuzzy coat aside, A naked chrysalis. Because his favorite leaves have lost Their juice and flavoring, He leaves off eating, in a huff, Eschewing everythingâ Gives over crawling, goes to bed, And snoozes there till spring! When Panic fills the stoutest heart With bodings dark and dire, How cheap and pleasant it would be, If we could thus retire And pass the winter, with no need Of food, or clothes, or fire! But while he keeps his humble place Among the creeping things, Threatened by every passer-by With being crushed to strings, Do you suppose the creature dreams About his future wings? And when he spins his snug cocoon, And bids his legs good by, Does he make peace with all the world, And tuck him up to die? Or just intend to sleep awhile, And wake a butterfly? A FAMILIAR ACQUAINTANCE. I speak without a vocal sound, I fly without a wing; I roam the world's wide regions round, And visit clown and king. I'm welcomed by the good and great; I'm trodden in the mire; I kindle high and wise debate, Likewise the kitchen fire. I have more heads than hydras boast, More points than they have scales; More letters than the gray-clad ghost Who carries round the mails; I hold the eye of sage and fop, Of joy and misery, And often, in the grocer's shop, His dabs of starch and tea. I whisper all that may be told, To all who will attend; I point the path to fame and gold As soon to foe as friend; And often with remorseless might I bring to beggary The struggling and too sanguine wight Who made and fostered me. TOBY. He was my fondest friendâand he is deadâ Dead in the vigorous fullness of his prime, Lost to my seeing for all coming time; Now, ere oblivion close above his head, Let me look back across our mingled years, And count how he was worth this heart-ache and these tears. Purer devotion, steadier truth than his, Not even the most exacting heart could crave; Demanding little, all he had, he gave, Nor wronged his love by doubts and jealousies, But kept his constant faith unto the end, Kind, loyal, trusting, brave, a true ideal friend. Envy nor prejudice he never knew, Nor breathed a syllable of wrath or blame, Nor wronged by hint or sneer his neighbor's fame, Nor uttered aught unseemly or untrue; In all his life-time there was never heard From his unsullied lips a base or cruel word. He never joined the venal, sordid race Of politicians, mad with selfish greed; He never did a vile, uncleanly deed By man or woman; envied no one's place, Nor wronged a mortal of a penny's worth; Should he not rank among the rare ones of the earth? He never sought the revels of the gay, Nor strayed where fatal follies spread their snare; He loved the home-light, and the fireside chair, When daytime's crowding cares were shut away, And there, with all he loved in easy reach, He talked with soft brown eyes, more eloquent than speech. Yet scores of wise men argue and declare That this, my friend, was but a pinch of dust; That his warm heart of constancy and trust Has gone out, like a bubble in the air; That his true soul of love and watchful care Is quenched, extinct and lost, and is not, anywhere. âHe had no soul,â they say. What was his power Of love, remembrance, gratitude and faith? Do these not triumph over time and death, And far outlast our life-time's little hour? Affection, changeless though long cycles roll, Integrity and trust,âdo these not make the soul? If these high attributes in sinful men Make up the sum of immortality, Outlive all life and time, and land and sea, Unfading, deathless,âwherefore is it then, They are contemned by church and synagogue, When they inspire and warm the bosom of a dog? If baser spirits last, can it be true, That his dissolved to nothing when he died? Wherever love lives, must not his abide? Where faith dwells, shall his faith not enter too? True hearts are few, and heaven is not so small, O fond and faithful friend, but it can hold them all! I have lost many a friend, but never one So patient, steadfast, and sincere as he, So unforgetful in his constancy; Ah, when at last my long day's work is done, Shall I not find him waiting as of yore, Eager, expectant, glad, to meet me at the door?</field>
