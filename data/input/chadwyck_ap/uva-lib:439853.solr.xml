      <field name="fulltext">THE PARABLE OF ST. CHRISTOPHER. To a king's court a giant came,— “O king, both far and near I seek,” he said, “the greatest king, And thou art he, I hear. “If it please thee, I will abide; To thee my knee shall bend; Only unto the greatest kings Can giants condescend.” Right glad the king the giant took Into his service then, For since Goliath's mighty days No man so big was seen. Well pleased the giant, too, to serve The greatest king on earth; He served him well, in peace, in war, In sorrow, and in mirth, Till came a wandering minstrel by, One day, who played and sang Wild songs, through which the devil's name Profanely, loudly rang. Astonished then the giant saw The king look sore afraid; At mention of the devil's name, The cross's sign he made. “How now, my master! Why dost thou Make on thy breast this sign?” He said. “It is a spell,” replied The king—“a spell divine, “Which shall the devil circumvent, And keep me safe and whole From all the wicked arts he tries To slay my precious soul.” “O, ho, my master! then he is More powerful than thou! They lied who called thee greatest king; I leave thy service now, “And seek the devil; him will I My master call henceforth,” The giant cried, and strode away Contemptuous and wroth. He found the devil soon. I ween The devil waited near, Well pleased to have this mighty man Within his ranks appear. They journeyed on full many a day, And now the giant deemed At last he had a master found, Who was the king he seemed. But lo! one day they came apace To where four roadways met, And at the meeting of the roads A cross of stone was set. The devil trembled and fell back, And said, “We go around.” “Now tell me,” fierce the giant cried, “Why fearest thou this ground?” The devil would not answer. “Then I leave thee, master mine,” The giant said. “Of something wrong This mystery is sign.” Then answered him the fiend, ashamed: “'Twas there Christ Jesus died; Wherever stands a cross like that, I may not, dare not bide.” “Ho, ho!” the giant cried again, Surprised again, perplexed; “Then Jesus is the greatest king,— I seek and serve him next.” The king named Jesus, far and near, The weary giant sought; His name was everywhere proclaimed, His image sold and bought, His power vaunted, and his laws Upheld by sword and fire; But him the giant sought in vain, Until he cried in ire, One winter eve, as late he came Upon a hermit's cell: “Now by my troth, tell me, good saint, Where doth thy master dwell? “For I have sought him far and wide, By leagues of land and sea; I seek to be his servant true, In honest fealty. “I have such strength as kings desire, State to their state to lend; But only to the greatest king Can giants condescend.” Then said the hermit, pale and wan: “Oh, giant man! indeed The King thou seekest doth all kings In glorious power exceed; “But they who see him face to face, In full communion clear, Crowned with his kingdom's splendor bright, Must buy the vision dear. “Dwell here, O brother, and thy lot With ours contented cast, And first, that flesh be well subdued, For days and nights thou'lt fast!” “I fast!” the giant cried, amazed. “Good saint, I'll no such thing. My strength would fail; without that, I Were fit to serve no king!” “Then thou must pray,” the hermit said; “We kneel on yonder stone, And tell these beads, and for each bead A prayer, one by one.” The giant flung the beads away, Laughing in scornful pride, “I will not wear my knees on stones; I know no prayers,” he cried. Then said the hermit, “Giant, since Thou canst not fast nor pray, I know not if our Master will Save thee some other way. “But go down to yon river deep, Where pilgrims daily sink, And build for thee a little hut Close on the river's brink, “And carry travellers back and forth Across the raging stream; Perchance this service to our King A worthy one will seem.” “Now that is good,” the giant cried; “That work I understand; A joyous task 'twill be to bear Poor souls from land to land, “Who, but for me, would sink and drown. Good saint, thou hast at length Made mention of a work which is Fit for a giant's strength.” For many a year, in lowly hut, The giant dwelt content Upon the bank, and back and forth Across the stream he went, And on his giant shoulders bore All travellers who came, By night, by day, or rich or poor, All in King Jesus' name. But much he doubted if the King His work would note or know, And often with a weary heart He waded to and fro. One night, as wrapped in sleep he lay, He sudden heard a call: “Oh, Christopher, come carry me!” He sprang, looked out, but all Was dark and silent on the shore. “It must be that I dreamed,” He said, and laid him down again; But instantly there seemed Again the feeble, distant cry: “Oh, come and carry me!” Again he sprang, and looked; again No living thing could see. The third time came the plaintive voice, Like infant's soft and weak; With lantern strode the giant forth, More carefully to seek. Down on the bank a little child He found,—a piteous sight,— Who, weeping, earnestly implored To cross that very night. With gruff good-will he picked him up, And on his neck to ride, He tossed him, as men play with babes, And plunged into the tide. But as the water closed around His knees, the infant's weight Grew heavier and heavier, Until it was so great The giant scarce could stand upright; His staff shook in his hand, His mighty knees bent under him, He barely reached the land, And, staggering, set the infant down, And turned to scan his face; When, lo! he saw a halo bright Which lit up all the place. Then Christopher fell down afraid At marvel of the thing, And dreamed not that it was the face Of Jesus Christ, his King, Until the infant spoke, and said: “Oh, Christopher, behold! I am the Lord whom thou hast served! Rise up, be glad and bold! “For I have seen and noted well Thy works of charity; And that thou art my servant good, A token thou shalt see. “Plant firmly here upon this bank Thy stalwart staff of pine, And it shall blossom and bear fruit, This very hour, in sign.” Then, vanishing, the infant smiled. The giant, left alone, Saw on the bank, with luscious dates, His stout pine staff bent down. For many a year, St. Christopher Served God in many a land; And master painters drew his face, With loving heart and hand, On altar fronts and church's walls; And peasants used to say, To look on good St. Christopher Brought luck for all the day. I think the lesson is as good To-day as it was then— As good to us called Christians As to the heathen men: The lesson of St. Christopher, Who spent his strength for others, And saved his soul by working hard To help and save his brothers! THE LEGEND OF ST. NICHOLAS. The tales of good St. Nicholas Are known in every clime; Told in painting, and in statues, And in the poet's rhyme. For centuries they've worshipped him, In churches east and west; Of all the saints we read about He is beloved the best. Because he was the saint of all The wretched and the poor, And never sent a little child Unsuccored from his door. In England's isle, alone, to-day, Four hundred churches stand Which bear his name, and keep it well Remembered through the land. And all the little children In England know full well This tale of good St. Nicholas, Which I am now to tell. The sweetest tale, I think, of all The tales they tell of him; I never read it but my eyes With tears begin to swim. There was a heathen king who roved About with cruel bands, And waged a fierce and wicked war On all the Christian lands. And once he took as captive A little fair-haired boy, A Christian merchant's only son, His mother's pride and joy. He decked him in apparel gay, And said, “You're just the age To serve behind my chair at meat, A dainty Christian page.” Oh, with a sore and aching heart The lonely captive child Roamed through the palace, big and grand, And wept and never smiled. And all the heathen jeered at him, And called him Christian dog, And when the king was angry He kicked him like a log, And spat upon his face, and said: “Now by my beard, thy gods Are poor to leave their worshippers At such unequal odds.” One day, just as the cruel king Had sat him down to dine, And in his jewelled cup of gold The page was pouring wine, The little fellow's heart ran o'er In tears he could not stay, For he remembered suddenly, It was the very day On which the yearly feast was kept Of good St Nicholas, And at his home that very hour Were dancing on the grass, With music, and with feasting, all The children of the town. The king looked up, and saw his tears; His face began to frown: “How now, thou dog! thy snivelling tears Are running in my cup; 'Twas not with these, but with good wine, I bade thee fill it up. Why weeps the hound?” The child replied: “I weep, because to-day, In name of good St. Nicholas, All Christian children play; And all my kindred gather home, From greatest unto least, And keep to good St. Nicholas A merry banquet feast.” The heathen king laughed scornfully: “If he be saint indeed, Thy famous great St. Nicholas, Why does he not take heed To thee to-day, and bear thee back To thy own native land? Ha! well I wot, he cannot take One slave from out my hand!” Scarce left the boastful words his tongue When, with astonished eyes, The cruel king a giant form Saw swooping from the skies. A whirlwind shook the palace walls, The doors flew open wide, And lo! the good St. Nicholas Came in with mighty stride. Right past the guards, as they were not, Close to the king's gold chair, With striding steps the good Saint came, And seizing by his hair The frightened little page, he bore Him, in a twinkling, high Above the palace topmost roof, And vanished in the sky. Now at that very hour was spread A banquet rich and dear, Within the little page's home, To which, from far and near, The page's mourning parents called All poor to come and pray With them, to good St. Nicholas, Upon his sacred day. Thinking, perhaps, that he would heal Their anguish and their pain, And at poor people's prayers might give Their child to them again. Now what a sight was there to see, When flying through the air, The Saint came carrying the boy, Still by his curly hair! And set him on his mother's knee, Too frightened yet to stand, And holding still the king's gold cup Fast in his little hand. And what glad sounds were these to hear, What sobs and joyful cries, And calls for good St. Nicholas, To come back from the skies! But swift he soared, and only smiled, And vanished in the blue; Most likely he was hurrying Some other good to do. But I wonder if he did not stop To take a passing look Where still the cruel heathen king In terror crouched and shook; While from the palace all his guards In coward haste had fled, And told the people, in his chair The king was sitting dead. Hurrah for good St. Nicholas! The friend of all the poor, Who never sent a little child Unsuccored from his door. We do not pray to saints to-day, But still we hold them dear, And the stories of their holy lives Are stories good to hear. They are a sort of parable, And if we ponder well, We shall not find it hard to read The lesson which they tell. We do not pray to saints to-day, Yet who knows but they hear Our mention of them, and are glad We hold their memory dear? Hurrah for good St. Nicholas, The friend of all the poor, Who never sent a little child Unsuccored from his door! ST. MARTIN'S CLOAK. St. Martin was a soldier Of Constantine the Great; While yet he was a stripling He bore full armor's weight; He fought right well and valiantly; No worse because he prayed; His comrades sometime scoffed at him, When the cross's sign he made. But they loved him in their hearts, And revered his saintly life, And felt safer with him close to them, In the thickest of the strife. They tell a many tales of him; His generosity; His love for all the poor; his deeds Of gracious charity; Above them all, this one is sweet And wonderful to read, And holds a tender lesson For us to learn and heed. Oh if we lived to-day, as lived Those blessed ancient saints, This world of ours less full would be Of weeping and complaints. One dreadful winter, when the cold Was so bitter that it killed Men on the streets, and, spite of fires, In houses they were chilled, St. Martin went one morning To pass the city's gate, And there he saw a ragged man, Whose pitiable state So moved his heart, that in a trice He drew his good broadsword, And cut his warm fur cloak in two Without a single word, And threw the beggar-man one-half; Then in the other, clad But meagrely, he rode all day Half frozen, but most glad. At night, St. Martin dreamed a dream, Such dreams as angels bring; They led him in his dream to Heaven, To see a wondrous thing. He saw the Good Lord walking Along the golden street, With angels crowding round him, On silver pinions fleet; And lo, upon his shoulders A wrap of fur he bore, The self-same wrap of fur which matched The half St. Martin wore! And turning to the angels, With smile, the Good Lord said, “Now do ye know, my angels, Who thus hath me array'd? My servant Martin hath done this, Though he is unbaptized, And dreameth not his charity By me is known and prized.” The next day, while the vision Glowed within him like a flame, Young Martin sought a holy priest, Who baptized him in God's name. And after that, for thirty years He fought the Emperor's fights As one whose eye and hand are nerved By Heaven's sounds and sights. THE PALACE OF GONDOFORUS. A LEGEND OF ST. THOMAS. When King Gondoforus desired To have a palace built that should Be finer than all palaces Which in the Roman Empire stood, He sent his provost Abanes To search the countries far and wide For builders and for architects, Whose skill and knowledge had been tried. Then God unto St. Thomas said: “Go, Thomas, now, and tell this king That thou wilt build a palace which Immortal fame to him shall bring.” Then to the saint, Gondoforus Gave stores of silver and of gold, And precious stones and jewels rich; Nought did the eager king withhold. “Now see thou build, O saint,” he cried, All proud and arrogant of mien— “Now see thou build right speedily Such palace as was never seen!” Then to far countries journeyed he— Two years and more he staid away; At other sovereigns' palaces All scornful gazing, he would say: “St. Thomas, sent from God, doth build For me a palace. God hath said Its splendor an immortal fame Upon my name and reign shall shed.” Gondoforus returned and sought With eager haste his palace site; The field was bare as when he went, The sod with peaceful daisies white! “What has the man called Thomas done With all my gold?” he hotly cried. “Given it all unto the poor,” The courtiers sneeringly replied. The king, in rage no words could tell, St. Thomas into prison threw, And racked his brains to think what he For fitting punishment could do. That very day, his brother died; His vengeance now must cool and wait; Until a royal tomb was built, The royal corpse must lie in state. Lo! on the fourth day sat erect The royal corpse, and cried aloud, While all the mourners and the guards Fled terror-stricken in a crowd; “O king! O brother! listen now, These four days I in Paradise Have wander'd, and return to tell Thee what I saw with my own eyes. “This man whom thou wouldst torture is God's servant, dear to God's own heart. Behold, the angels showed to me A palace wrought with wondrous art, “Of silver, gold, and precious stones: Most marvellously it did shine; And when I asked whose name it bore, O brother! then they told me thine! “‘St. Thomas this hath built,’ they said, ‘For one Gondoforus, a king.’ ‘It is my brother!’ I exclaimed, And fled to thee the news to bring.” Then fell the royal corpse again Back, silent, solemn in its state; Until the royal tomb was built, The royal corpse must lie and wait. Oh! swift the king the prison doors, With his own hands, did open wide. “Come forth! come forth! O worthy saint!” He, kneeling on the threshold, cried. “The dead from heaven this day hath come, To tell me how in Paradise The palace thou hast built for me Shines beautiful in angels' eyes. “Come forth! come forth! O noble saint! And graciously forgive my sin. As honored guest, my palace gates Oh condescend to enter in!” Then, smiling, said St. Thomas, calm And gracious as an angel might: “O king! didst thou not know that we Build not God's palaces in sight “Of men, nor from the things of earth? All heaven lieth full and fair With palaces which charity Alone can build, alone can share. “Before the world began, were laid Their bright foundations by God's hand, For Charity to build upon, As God and his son Christ had planned. “No other palaces endure; No other riches can remain; No other kingdoms are secure; No other kings eternal reign.” Henceforth the king, Gondoforus, Went on his way, triumphant, glad, Remembering what a palace he Already in the heavens had. No more the Roman emperors With envy could his bosom move. How poor their palaces by side Of one not made with hands, above! His treasures in the good saint's hands He poured, and left for him to use, In adding to that palace fair Such courts and towers as he might choose. And there to-day they dwell, I ween, With other saints and other kings; And roam with hosts of angels bright, From place to place, on shining wings. THE NEST. Under the apple-tree, somebody said, Look at that robin's nest overhead! All of sharp sticks, and of mud and clay— What a rough home for a summer day!” Gaunt stood the apple-tree, gaunt and bare, And creaked in the winds which blustered there. The nest was wet with the April rain; The clay ran down in an ugly stain; Little it looked, I must truly say, Like a lovely home for a summer day. Up in the apple-tree, somebody laughed, “Little you know of the true home-craft. Laugh if you like, at my sticks and clay; They'll make a good home for a summer day. May turns the apple-tree pink and white, Sunny all day, and fragrant all night. My babies will never feel the showers, For rain can't get through these feathers of ours. Sung under my wings they will cuddle and creep, The happiest babies awake or asleep,” Said the robin-mother, flying away After more of the sticks and mud and clay. Under the apple-tree somebody sighed, “Ah me, the blunder of folly and pride! The roughest small house of mud or clay Might be a sweet home for a summer day, Sunny and fragrant all day, all night, With only good cheer for fragrance and light; And the bitterest storms of grief and pain Will beat and break on that home in vain, Where a true-hearted mother broods alway, And makes the whole year like a summer day.” COLORADO SNOW-BIRDS. I'll tell you how the snow-birds come, Here in our Winter days; They make me think of chickens, With their cunning little ways. We go to bed at night, and leave The ground all bare and brown, And not a single snow-bird To be seen in all the town. But when we wake at morning The ground with snow is white, And with the snow, the snow-birds Must have travelled all the night; For the streets and yards are full of them, The dainty little things, With snow-white breasts, and soft brown heads, And speckled russet wings. Not here and there a snow-bird, As we see them at the East, But in great flocks, like grasshoppers, By hundreds, at the least, They push and crowd and jostle, And twitter as they feed, And hardly lift their heads up, For fear to miss a seed. What 'tis they eat, nobody seems To know or understand; The seeds are much too fine to see, All sifted in the sand. But winds last Summer scattered them, All thickly on these plains; The little snow-birds have no barns, But God protects their grains. They let us come quite near them, And show no sign of dread; Then, in a twinkling, the whole flock Will flutter on ahead A step or two, and light, and feed, And look demure and tame, And then fly on again, and stop, As if it were a game. Some flocks count up to thousands, I know, and when they fly, Their tiny wings make rustle, As if a wind went by. They go as quickly as they come, Go in a night or day; Soon as the snow has melted off, The darlings fly away, But come again, again, again, All Winter, with each snow; Brave little armies, through the cold, Swift back and forth they go. I always wondered where they lived In Summer, till last year I stumbled on them in their home, High in the upper air; 'Way up among the clouds it was, A many thousand feet, But on the mountain-side gay flowers Were blooming fresh and sweet. Great pine-trees' swaying branches Gave cool and fragrant shade; And here, we found, the snow-birds Their Summer home had made. “Oh, lucky little snow-birds!” We said, “to know so well, In Summer time and Winter time, Your destined place to dwell— “To journey, nothing doubting, Down to the barren plains, Where harvests are all over, To find your garnered grains! “Oh, precious little snow-birds! If we were half as wise, If we were half as trusting To the Father in the skies,— “He would feed us, though the harvests Had ceased throughout the land, And hold us, all our lifetime, In the hollow of his hand!” “THE PENNY YE MEANT TO GI'E.” There's a funny tale of a stingy man, Who was none too good, but might have been worse, Who went to his church on a Sunday night, And carried along his well-filled purse. When the sexton came with his begging-plate, The church was but dim with the candle's light; The stingy man fumbled all through his purse, And chose a coin by touch and not sight. It's an odd thing now that guineas should be So like unto pennies in shape and size. “I'll give a penny,” the stingy man said; “The poor must not gifts of pennies despise.” The penny fell down with a clatter and ring! And back in his seat leaned the stingy man. “The world is so full of the poor,” he thought, “I can't help them all,—I give what I can.” Ha, ha! how the sexton smiled, to be sure, To see the gold guinea fall in his plate! Ha, ha! how the stingy man's heart was wrung, Perceiving his blunder, but just too late! “No matter,” he said; “in the Lord's account That guinea of gold is set down to me. They lend to Him who give to the poor; It will not so bad an investment be.” “Na, na, mon,” the chuckling sexton cried out, “The Lord is na cheated—He kens thee well; He knew it was only by accident That out o' thy fingers the guinea fell! “He keeps an account, na doubt, for the puir; But in that account He'll set down to thee Na mair o' that golden guinea, my mon, Than the one bare penny ye meant to gi'e!” There's a comfort, too, in the little tale— A serious side as well as a joke; A comfort for all the generous poor, In the comical words the sexton spoke. A comfort to think that the good Lord knows How generous we really desire to be, And will give us credit in His account, For all the pennies we long “to gi'e.” MY BROKEN-WINGED BIRD. For days I have been cherishing A little bird with broken wing. I love it in my heart of hearts; To win its love I try all arts; I call it by each sweet pet name That I can think, its fear to tame. My room is still and bright and warm; The little thing is safe from harm. If I had left it where it lay Fluttering in the wintry day, No mate remaining by its side, Before nightfall it must have died. It sips the drink, it eats the food; Plenty of both, all sweet and good. But all the while my hand it flies, Looks up at me with piteous eyes; From morn till night, restless and swift, Runs to and fro, and tries to lift Itself upon its broken wing, And through the window-pane to spring. Poor little bird! Myself I see From morn till night in watching thee. A Power I cannot understand Is sheltering me with loving hand; It calls me by the dearest name, My love to win, my fear to tame; Each day my daily food provides, And night and day from danger hides Me safe: the food, the warmth, I take, Yet all the while ungrateful make Restless and piteous complaints, And strive to break the kind restraints. Dear little bird, 'twill not be long; Each day thy wing is growing strong; When it is healed, and thou canst fly, My windows will be opened high; And I shall watch with loving eyes To see thee soar in sunny skies. I, too, some day, on healèd wing Set free, shall soar aloft and sing, And in my joy no memory find Of prison-walls I left behind. A SHORT CATECHISM. At sunset of a summer's day, All curled up in a funny heap, Beneath the currant-bushes lay A boy named Willy, half asleep. But peeping through his sleepy eyes He watched all things as if he dreamed, And did not feel the least surprise However strange and queer they seemed. And every creature going by He hailed with questions from the grass, And laughed and called out sleepily, “Unless you answer you can't pass.” “O caterpillar, now tell me Why you roll up so tight and round; You are the drollest thing to see, A hairy marble on the ground.” “I roll me up to save my bones When I fall down; young man, if you Could do the same, the stumps and stones Would never bruise you black and blue.” ‘O spider, tell me why you hide The ropes and ladders which you spin, And keep them all locked up inside Your little body slim and thin.” “I hide my ropes and ladders fine Away from neighbors' thievish greed; If you kept yours as I keep mine, You'd always have one when you need.” “Why do you buzz so, busy bee? Why don't you make your honey still? You move about so boisterously, I'm sure you must much honey spill.” “I buzz and buzz, you silly boy, Because I can work better so; Just as you whistle for pure joy When on the road to school you go.” “O robin, wicked robin, why Did you my mamma's cherries eat? You thought no mortal soul was nigh; But I saw you from bill to feet.” “And I saw you, my fine young lad, And waited till you'd left the tree; I thought when you your fill had had, There would be little left for me!” “O big bull-frogs, why do you make Such ugly noises every night! Nobody can a half-nap take; You make our baby cry with fright.” “O Willy, we suppose the noise Is not a pleasant noise to hear; But we've one hundred little boys,— Frog-boys so cunning and so dear; “And it is not an easy task, You may believe, to put to beds A hundred little frogs who ask All questions which pop in their heads.” BY STAGE TO BOSTON. I have been young, and now I have grown old, But never until yesterday I knew How many living souls a stage can hold, And make the quickest time its journey through. I came upon the stage so suddenly,— And, for a stage, in such a funny place; I stood stock still, surprised as I could be, With blank amazement written in my face. 'Twas just behind old Deacon Thatcher's shed; The wheels in butter-cups sunk to the hubs; The pole stretched over a white clover-bed, And almost into Mrs. Thatcher's tubs. From every window looked out laughing eyes; From every window came a scream and shout; Before, behind, the children swarmed like flies, And madly rocked the old blue stage about. “O ho!” I said, and felt as young as they; “Whose stage is this? To what town does it go? And is there room for me to go to-day? And how much is the fare, I want to know?” As quick as lightning all the children cried: “We go to Boston, and we've got our load; But you can go if you will ride outside; The fare is just a dollar for each rod!” “Oh dear!” said I, “your fare is much too high; The money that I have would not begin”— “Jump on! jump on!” they all began to cry, “We'll take you once for nothing; you are thin!” I knew much better than to spoil their fun; So I went on and found a shady place, And watched, and saw that till the day was done They travelled tireless, at their quickest pace. But all the time I watched I could not win My heart from thinking, while I dreamed and smiled, Of that fair kingdom none can enter in Without becoming first a little child. LIZZY OF LA BOURGET. I tell you the tale as 'twas told to me. 'Tis a tale that I dearly love to tell; The tale of Lizzy of La Bourget, Of faithful Lizzy, who ran so well. This Lizzy of La Bourget was a mare; She was all snow white except two black feet; Her sire was an Arab steed, coal black, Her dam was a Cossack pony fleet. Her Arab blood made her tireless and strong, Her Cossack blood made her loving and true; Oh! Lizzy of La Bourget could love As warmly as human beings do. She followed her peasant master to work, Obeyed at a sign or call of her name; All day she tugged at his cart or plough, And bounding at night she homeward came. She was never groomed, but she shone like silk, And fattened well on the poorest fare; She played with the children like a dog, And the children fed her with her share. When the war broke out and her master went To fight with the French, good Lizzy went too: And many a battle, night and day, She carried him bravely, safely through. But at last there came a turn in the tide, For Lizzy and master, disastrous day; The day on which a battle was fought, A bloody battle at La Bourget. The cavalry regiment, horse and man Were caught in an ambush and hemmed in: The Frenchman captured them every one, And held them, a ransom large to win. The captors were tipsy; 'twas late at night; The foolish men drank because they were glad: Alone, by a half-open casement low, Sat Lizzy's poor master, weary and sad, When, sudden, he heard a sound that he knew; He could not mistake, it was Lizzy's neigh; She had broken loose and was seeking him, Oh, brave, good Lizzy of La Bourget! The captors were tipsy; they did not hear Their prisoner call “Lizzy” in whisper low; They did not notice the joyous neigh: The first they knew, with one ringing blow The casement was burst from its hinges strong, Their prisoner had leaped on his good mare's back; And through the darkness he raced, he flew, With a hundred bullets on his track. No bridle! no spur! But well Lizzy knew The life of her master lay in her speed, She ran like a whirlwind, and paid to the shots No more than to summer raindrops heed. No compass! no guide! Nought knew the Hussar Of right or left in his perilous way; But safe, sure instinct his Lizzy had, She knew the road back to La Bourget. All night and the most of a day she ran, She had no water, she was not fed; And when she arrived at La Bourget, You well may think, she was almost dead. But a shout arose from each man who saw Her dash into camp with her gallant stride, And the General himself came out to see The horse and the master of such a ride. The fight had been fierce, and many men won Great fame in the heat of that bloody day, But long after they are forgotten all, The world will know Lizzy of La Bourget. MY FIRST VOYAGE ROUND THE WORLD Four heads peeped over my shoulder, And four merry voices said, “Oh, Aunty! tell us a story Of some journey you have made.” The lilac-bush at the window Nodded, and whispered: “You know There's that one you took in my shadow Almost thirty years ago.” I nodded back to the lilac, “Good friend, your plumes are as curled As when I took, in their shadow, My first voyage round the world. “But I am so old and weary, I almost forget that sail; If I find I cannot tell it, Will you finish me the tale?” The lilac-bush shook with laughter, And the fragrance floated in; The children crowded up closer, And shouted: “Begin, begin!” “Well, once there was a little girl.” “That's you,” They cried. “Yes, it was I, but 'twill not do For you to interrupt. “One day in June She and her brother took their books at noon And sat down on the grass, where lilacs made A green and purple tent with pleasant shade. They meant to study, but the day was hot; And watching birds and bugs, they soon forgot The lessons, and began to idly trace With pencil-marks the atlas's old face. But presently, with slow and sleepy gait, As if they never heard of being late, Two caterpillars crawled up on the map, And stopped, and snuffed, and made their feelers snap With wisest look, on land and on the sea. ‘Halloo! old fellows,’ cried the boy. ‘You'll be Two travelled worms, and you shall draw our ships. Go faster, now, or you shall feel the whips.’ Just then two dainty apple-blossoms blew Down in their laps: one pink, one white. ‘And you Shall be our ships,’ he cried; ‘one called “The Rose,” The other, “Snow-bird.”’ “Then his sister chose ‘The Rose’ for hers; and with fine silken strings They made the caterpillars, helpless things, Fast to the ships, then watched to see them start. Oh! ne'er before did worms play such a part; Oh! ne'er before such ships go gliding through The seas. Each child a curving stamen picked From out a tiger-lily bud, and pricked The sluggish caterpillars right and left Until they must have been of sense bereft, If any sense they had. “‘Oh! now I know What I will do; for gold and pearls I'll go To Africa; the good “Snow-bird” shall fly Past all these islands,’ said the boy. “‘And I Will carry first a whole ship-load of bread To these poor Irishmen who are half dead With famine,’said the girl; ‘then through the Straits Of old Gibraltar I will seek the gates Of Thebes. Oh, dear! all of the River Nile My caterpillar covers up. Don't smile, Bad boy; yours is as much too big, and more, To get between Madeira and the shore. The open ocean is a better place For ships towed at a caterpillar's pace. I'm going round the world, like Captain Cook: Here is the very track marked out he took.’ ‘And so will I,’ cried he; ‘see who will win: The ship that without cheating first gets in Shall be the champion ship.’ “Then hard and fast The poor worms' legs were pricked. They hurried past Whole continents in seconds. Side by side These funny racers crawled. No time nor tide Made odds to them: they thought but of escape. At last, just as the ‘Snow-bird’ round the Cape Of Good Hope turned, lo! in a fuzzy ball Her caterpillar rolled him up, and no Amount of pricks and shoves could make him go Another step, or straighten out. The race Was over, but ‘The Rose’ kept on apace; Poor caterpillar! patient o'er and o'er Cook's track in seventeen seventy-three and four, Through Artic seas and past firm fields of ice, Past tropic isles, where trade-winds load with spice, He toiled. At last the play grew dull. ‘The Rose’ Went into port; the ‘Snow-bird’ too; then those Young tyrants set their victims free; more dead Than live, the puzzled worms, with feeble tread, Stole off, and ever after were esteemed, No doubt, in their own country, as beseemed Such travellers. “As for the girl and boy, They grew up just like all the rest, through joy And grief, ‘with books, and work, and healthful play;’ But always they remembered well this day; And when they journeyed in good earnest, said, Sometimes with pensive laugh: ‘That trip we made By map, beneath the lilac-bush, was best; No noise, no smoke, no cinders to molest On land; no stormy gales on any sea; Rivers and roads, hotels and harbors free; Each step of that we both remember yet, While last year's jaunts we jumble and forget. Oh! sweet, wise days, when caterpillars made Fast time enough for us 'neath lilac's shade; And fancy was so strong that we took trips Round the whole world in apple-blossom ships.’” Four mouths stretching round my shoulder, Put sweet kisses on my lips; “Oh! Aunty, what funny stories! How jolly about the ships!” And just then a caterpillar, Who had listened to each word, Tumbled down, quite blind with terror, Into the mouth of a bird. And the lilac-bush at the window Nodded at me with a laugh, And whispered: “You're growing so old You've forgotten more than half.”</field>
