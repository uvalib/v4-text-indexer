      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME I A BACKWARD LOOK As I sat smoking, alone, yesterday, And lazily leaning back in my chair, Enjoying myself in a general wayâ Allowing my thoughts a holiday From weariness, toil and care,â My fanciesâdoubtless, for ventilationâ Left ajar the gates of my mind,â And Memory, seeing the situation, Slipped out in the street of âAuld Lang Syne.ââ Wandering ever with tireless feet Through scenes of silence, and jubilee Of long-hushed voices; and faces sweet Were thronging the shadowy side of the street As far as the eye could see; Dreaming again, in anticipation, The same old dreams of our boyhood's days That never come true, from the vague sensation Of walking asleep in the world's strange ways. Away to the house where I was born! And there was the selfsame clock that ticked From the close of dusk to the burst of morn, When life-warm hands plucked the golden corn And helped when the apples were picked. And the âchany dogâ on the mantel-shelf, With the gilded collar and yellow eyes, Looked just as at first, when I hugged myself Sound asleep with the dear surprise. And down to the swing in the locust-tree, Where the grass was worn from the trampled ground, And where âEckâ Skinner, âOldâ Carr, and three Or four such other boys used to be âDoin' sky-scrapers,â or âwhirlin' roundâ: And again Bob climbed for the bluebird's nest, And again âhad showsâ in the buggy-shed Of Guymon's barn, where still, unguessed, The old ghosts romp through the best days dead! And again I gazed from the old schoolroom With a wistful look, of a long June day, When on my cheek was the hectic bloom Caught of Mischief, as I presumeâ He had such a âpartialâ way, It seemed, toward me.âAnd again I thought Of a probable likelihood to be Kept in after schoolâfor a girl was caught Catching a note from me. And down through the woods to the swimming-holeâ Where the big, white, hollow old sycamore grows,â And we never cared when the water was cold, And always âduckedâ the boy that told On the fellow that tied the clothes.â When life went so like a dreamy rhyme, That it seems to me now that then The world was having a jollier time Than it ever will have again. PHILIPER FLASH Young Philiper Flash was a promising lad, His intentions were goodâbut oh, how sad For a person to think How the veriest pink And bloom of perfection may turn out bad. Old Flash himself was a moral man, And prided himself on a moral plan, Of a maxim as old As the calf of gold, Of making that boy do what he was told. And such a good mother had Philiper Flash; Her voice was as soft as the creamy plash Of the milky wave With its musical lave That gushed through the holes of her patent churn-dash;â And the excellent woman loved Philiper so, She could cry sometimes when he stumped his toe,â And she stroked his hair With such motherly care When the dear little angel learned to swear. Old Flash himself would sometimes say That his wife had âsuch a ridiculous way,â She'd humor that child Till he'd soon be sp'iled, And then there'd be the devil to pay!â And the excellent wife, with a martyr's look, Would tell old Flash himself âhe took No notice at all Of the bright-eyed doll Unless when he spanked him for getting a fall!â Young Philiper Flash, as time passed by, Grew into âa boy with a roguish eyeâ: He could smoke a cigar, And seemed by far The most promising youth.ââHe's powerful sly,â Old Flash himself once told a friend, âEvery copper he gets he's sure to spendâ And,â said he, âdon't you know If he keeps on so What a crop of wild oats the boy will grow!â But his dear good mother knew Philiper's ways Soâwell, she managed the money to raise; And old Flash himself Was âlaid on the shelf,â (In the manner of speaking we have nowadays). For âgracious knows, her darling child, If he went without money he'd soon grow wild.â So Philiper Flash With a regular dash âSwung on to the reins,â and went âslingin' the cash.â As old Flash himself, in his office one day, Was shaving notes in a barberous way, At the hour of four Death entered the door And shaved the note on his life, they say. And he had for his grave a magnificent tomb, Though the venturous finger that pointed âGone Home,â Looked white and cold From being so bold, As it feared that a popular lie was told. Young Philiper Flash was a man of style When he first began unpacking the pile Of the dollars and dimes Whose jingling chimes Had clinked to the tune of his father's smile; And he strewed his wealth with such lavish hand, His rakish ways were the talk of the land, And gossipers wise Sat winking their eyes (A certain foreboding of fresh surprise). A âfast young manâ was Philiper Flash, And wore âloud clothesâ and a weak mustache, And âdone the Park,â For an âafternoon lark,â With a very fast horse of âremarkable dash.â And Philiper handled a billiard-cue About as well as the best he knew, And used to say âHe could make it pay By playing two or three games a day.â And Philiper Flash was his mother's joy, He seemed to her the magic alloy That made her glad, When her heart was sad, With the thought that âshe lived for her darling boy.â His dear good mother wasn't aware How her darling boy relished a âtare.ââ She said âone night He gave her a fright By coming home late and acting tight.â Young Philiper Flash, on a winterish day, Was published a bankrupt, so they sayâ And as far as I know I suppose it was so, For matters went on in a singular way; His excellent mother, I think I was told, Died from exposure and want and cold; And Philiper Flash, With a horrible slash, Whacked his jugular open and went to smash. THE SAME OLD STORY The same old story told againâ The maiden droops her head, The ripening glow of her crimson cheek Is answering in her stead. The pleading tone of a trembling voice Is telling her the way He loved her when his heart was young In Youth's sunshiny day: The trembling tongue, the longing tone, Imploringly ask why They can not be as happy now As in the days gone by. And two more hearts, tumultuous With overflowing joy, Are dancing to the music Which that dear, provoking boy Is twanging on his bowstring, As, fluttering his wings, He sends his love-charged arrows While merrily he sings: âHo! ho! my dainty maiden, It surely can not be You are thinking you are master Of your heart, when it is me.â And another gleaming arrow Does the little god's behest, And the dainty little maiden Falls upon her lover's breast. âThe same old story told again,â And listened o'er and o'er, Will still be new, and pleasing, too, Till âTime shall be no more.â TO A BOY WHISTLING The smiling face of a happy boy With its enchanted key Is now unlocking in memory My store of heartiest joy. And my lost life again to-day, In pleasant colors all aglow, From rainbow tints, to pure white snow, Is a panorama sliding away. The whistled air of a simple tune Eddies and whirls my thoughts around, As fairy balloons of thistle-down Sail through the air of June. O happy boy with untaught grace! What is there in the world to give That can buy one hour of the life you live Or the trivial cause of your smiling face! AN OLD FRIEND Hey, Old Midsummer! are you here again, With all your harvest-store of olden joys,â Vast overhanging meadow-lands of rain, And drowsy dawns, and noons when golden grain Nods in the sun, and lazy truant boys Drift ever listlessly adown the day, Too full of joy to rest, and dreams to play. The same old Summer, with the same old smile Beaming upon us in the same old way We knew in childhood! Though a weary while Since that far time, yet memories reconcile The heart with odorous breaths of clover hay; And again I hear the doves, and the sun streams through The old barn door just as it used to do. And so it seems like welcoming a friendâ An old, old friend, upon his coming home From some far countryâcoming home to spend Long, loitering days with me: And I extend My hand in rapturous glee:âAnd so you've come!â Ho, I'm so glad! Come in and take a chair: Well, this is just like old times, I declare! WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING There wasn't two purtier farms in the state Than the couple of which I'm about to relate;â Jinin' each otherâbelongin' to Brown, And jest at the edge of a flourishin' town. Brown was a man, as I understand, That allus had handled a good 'eal o' land, And was sharp as a tack in drivin' a tradeâ For that's the way most of his money was made. And all the grounds and the orchards about His two pet farms was all tricked out With poppies and posies And sweet-smellin' rosies; And hundreds o' kinds Of all sorts o' vines, To tickle the most horticultural minds; And little dwarf trees not as thick as your wrist With ripe apples on 'em as big as your fist: And peaches,âSiberian crabs and pears, And quincesâWell! any fruit any tree bears; And th' purtiest streamâjest a-swimmin' with fish, Andâjest o'most everything heart could wish! The purtiest orch'rdsâI wish you could see How purty they was, fer I know it 'ud be A regular treat!âbut I'll go ahead with My story! A man by the name o' Smithâ (A bad name to rhyme, But I reckon that I'm Not goin' back on a Smith! nary time!) 'At hadn't a soul of kin nor kith, And more money than he knowed what to do with,â So he comes a-ridin' along one day, And he says to Brown, in his offhand wayâ Who was trainin' some newfangled vines round a bay- WinderââHowdy-doâlook-a-hereâsay: What'll you take fer this property here?â I'm talkin' o' leavin' the city this year, And I want to be Where the air is free, And I'll buy this place, if it ain't too dear!ââ Wellâthey grumbled and jawed aroun'â âI don't like to part with the place,â says Brown; âWell,â says Smith, a-jerkin' his head, âThat house yonderâbricks painted redâ Jest like this'nâa purtier viewâ Who is it owns it?â âThat's mine too,â Says Brown, as he winked at a hole in his shoe, âBut I'll tell you right here jest what I kin do:â If you'll pay the figgers I'll sell it to you.â Smith went over and looked at the placeâ Badgered with Brown, and argied the caseâ Thought that Brown's figgers was rather too tall, But, findin' that Brown wasn't goin' to fall, In final agreed, So they drawed up the deed Fer the farm and the fixturesâthe live stock an' all. And so Smith moved from the city as soon As he possibly couldâBut âthe man in the moonâ Knowed more'n Smith o' farmin' pursuits, And jest to convince you, and have no disputes, How little he knowed, I'll tell you his âmode,â As he called it, o' raisin' âthe best that growed,â In the way o' potatoesâ Cucumbersâtomatoes, And squashes as lengthy as young alligators. 'Twas allus a curious thing to me How big a fool a feller kin be When he gits on a farm after leavin' a town!â Expectin' to raise himself up to renown, And reap fer himself agricultural fame, By growin' of squashesâwithout any shameâ As useless and long as a technical name. To make the soil pure, And certainly sure, He plastered the ground with patent manure. He had cultivators, and double-hoss plows, And patent machines fer milkin' his cows; And patent hay-forksâpatent measures and weights, And new patent back-action hinges fer gates, And barn locks and latches, and such little dribs, And patents to keep the rats out o' the cribsâ Reapers and mowers, And patent grain sowers; And drillers And tillers And cucumber hillers, And horries;âand had patent rollers and scrapers, And took about ten agricultural papers. So you can imagine how matters turned out: But Brown didn't have not a shadder o' doubt That Smith didn't know what he was about When he said that âthe old way to farm was played out.â But Smith worked ahead, And when any one said That the old way o' workin' was better instead O' his âmodern idees,â he allus turned red, And wanted to know What made people so Infernally anxious to hear theirselves crow? And guessed that he'd manage to hoe his own row. Brown he come onc't and leant over the fence, And told Smith that he couldn't see any sense In goin' to such a tremendous expense Fer the sake o' such no-account experiments:â âThat'll never make corn! As shore's you're born It'll come out the leetlest end of the horn!â Says Brown, as he pulled off a big roastin'-ear From a stalk of his own That had tribble outgrown Smith's poor yaller shoots, and says he, âLooky here! This corn was raised in the old-fashioned way, And I rather imagine that this corn'll pay Expenses fer raisin' it!âWhat do you say?â Brown got him then to look over his crop.â His luck that season had been tip-top! And you may surmise Smith opened his eyes And let out a look o' the wildest surprise When Brown showed him punkins as big as the lies He was stuffin' him withâabout offers he's had Fer his farm: âI don't want to sell very bad,â He says, but says he, âMr. Smith, you kin see Fer yourself how matters is standin' with me, I understand farmin' and I'd better stay, You know, on my farm;âI'm a-makin' it payâ I oughtn't to grumble!âI reckon I'll clear Away over four thousand dollars this year.â And that was the reason, he made it appear, Why he didn't care about sellin' his farm, And hinted at his havin' done himself harm In sellin' the other, and wanted to know If Smith wouldn't sell back ag'in to him.âSo Smith took the bait, and says he, âMr. Brown, I wouldn't sell out but we might swap aroun'â How'll you trade your place fer mine?â (Purty sharp way o' comin' the shine Over Smith! Wasn't it?) Well, sir, this Brown Played out his hand and brought Smithy downâ Traded with him an', workin' it cute, Raked in two thousand dollars to boot As slick as a whistle, an' that wasn't all,â He managed to trade back ag'in the next fall,â And the nextâand the nextâas long as Smith stayed He reaped with his harvests an annual trade.â Why, I reckon that Brown must 'a' easily madeâ On an averageânearly two thousand a yearâ Together he made over seven thousandâclear.â Till Mr. Smith found he was losin' his health In as big a proportion, almost, as his wealth; So at last he concluded to move back to town, And sold back his farm to this same Mr. Brown At very low figgers, by gittin' it down. Further'n this I have nothin' to say Than merely advisin' the Smiths fer to stay In their grocery stores in flourishin' towns And leave agriculture aloneâand the Browns. A POET'S WOOING I woo'd a woman once, But she was sharper than an eastern wind. âTennyson. âWhat may I do to make you glad, To make you glad and free, Till your light smiles glance And your bright eyes dance Like sunbeams on the sea? Read some rhyme that is blithe and gay Of a bright May morn and a marriage day?â And she sighed in a listless way she had,â âDo not readâit will make me sad!â âWhat shall I do to make you gladâ To make you glad and gay, Till your eyes gleam bright As the stars at night When as light as the light of day?â Sing some song as I twang the strings Of my sweet guitar through its wanderings?â And she sighed in the weary way she had,â âDo not singâit will make me sad!â âWhat can I do to make you gladâ As glad as glad can be, Till your clear eyes seem Like the rays that gleam And glint through a dew-decked tree?â Will it please you, dear, that I now begin A grand old air on my violin?â And she spoke again in the following way,â âYes, oh yes, it would please me, sir; I would be so glad you'd play Some grand old marchâin character,â And then as you march away I will no longer thus be sad, But oh, so gladâso gladâso glad!â MAN'S DEVOTION A lover said, âO Maiden, love me well, For I must go away: And should another ever come to tell Of loveâWhat will you say?â And she let fall a royal robe of hair That folded on his arm And made a golden pillow for her there; Her faceâas bright a charm As ever setting held in kingly crownâ Made answer with a look, And reading it, the lover bended down, And, trusting, âkissed the book.â He took a fond farewell and went away. And slow the time went byâ So wearyâdreary was it, day by day To love, and wait, and sigh. She kissed his pictured face sometimes, and said: âO Lips, so cold and dumb, I would that you would tell me, if not dead, Why, why do you not come?â The picture, smiling, stared her in the face Unmovedâe'en with the touch Of tear-dropsâhersâbejeweling the caseâ 'Twas plainâshe loved him much. And, thus she grew to think of him as gay And joyous all the while, And she was sorrowingââAh, welladay!â But pictures always smile! And yearsâdull yearsâin dull monotony As ever went and came, Still weaving changes on unceasingly, And changing, changed her name. Was she untrue?âShe oftentimes was glad And happy as a wife; But one remembrance oftentimes made sad Her matrimonial life.â Though its few years were hardly noted, when Again her path was strown With thornsâthe roses swept away again, And she again alone! And thenâalas! ah then!âher lover came: âI come to claim you nowâ My Darling, for I know you are the same, And I have kept my vow Through these long, long, long years, and now no more Shall we asundered be!â She staggered back and, sinking to the floor, Cried in her agony: âI have been false!â she moaned, âI am not trueâ I am not worthy now, Nor ever can I be a wife to youâ For I have broke my vow!â And as she kneeled there, sobbing at his feet, He calmly spokeâno sign Betrayed his inward agonyââI count you meet To be a wife of mine!â And raised her up forgiven, though untrue; As fond he gazed on her, She sighed,ââSo happy!â And she never knew He was a widower. A BALLAD WITH A SERIOUS CONCLUSION Crowd about me, little childrenâ Come and cluster 'round my knee While I tell a little story That happened once with me. My father he had gone away A-sailing on the foam, Leaving meâthe merest infantâ And my mother dear at home; For my father was a sailor, And he sailed the ocean o'er For full five years ere yet again He reached his native shore. And I had grown up rugged And healthy day by day, Though I was but a puny babe When father went away. Poor mother she would kiss me And look at me and sigh So strangely, oft I wondered And would ask the reason why. And she would answer sadly, Between her sobs and tears,â âYou look so like your father, Far away so many years!â And then she would caress me And brush my hair away, And tell me not to question, But to run about my play. Thus I went playing thoughtfullyâ For that my mother said,â âYou look so like your father!â Kept ringing in my head. So, ranging once the golden sands That looked out on the sea, I called aloud, âMy father dear, Come back to ma and me!â Then I saw a glancing shadow On the sand, and heard the shriek Of a sea-gull flying seaward, And I heard a gruff voice speak:â âAy, ay, my little shipmate, I thought I heard you hail; Were you trumpeting that sea-gull, Or do you see a sail?â And as rough and gruff a sailor As ever sailed the sea Was standing near grotesquely And leering dreadfully. I replied, though I was frightened âIt was my father dear I was calling for across the seaâ I think he didn't hear.â And then the sailor leered again In such a frightful way, And made so many faces I was little loath to stay: But he started fiercely toward meâ Then made a sudden halt And roared, âI think he heard you!â And turned a somersault. Then a wild fear overcame me, And I flew off like the wind, Shrieking âMother!ââand the sailor Just a little way behind! And then my mother heard me, And I saw her shade her eyes, Looking toward me from the doorway, Transfixed with pale surprise For a momentâthen her features Glowed with all their wonted charms As the sailor overtook me, And I fainted in her arms. When I awoke to reason I shuddered with affright Till I felt my mother's presence With a thrill of wild delightâ Till, amid a shower of kisses Falling glad as summer rain, A muffled thunder rumbled,â âIs he coming 'round again?â Then I shrieked and clung unto her, While her features flushed and burned As she told me it was father From a foreign land returned. I saidâwhen I was calm again, And thoughtfully once more Had dwelt upon my mother's words Of just the day before,â âI don't look like my father, As you told me yesterdayâ I know I don'tâor father Would have run the other way.â THE OLD TIMES WERE THE BEST Friends, my heart is half aweary Of its happiness to-night: Though your songs are gay and cheery, And your spirits feather-light, There's a ghostly music haunting Still the heart of every guest And a voiceless chorus chanting That the Old Times were the best. CHORUS All about is bright and pleasant With the sound of song and jest, Yet a feeling's ever present That the Old Times were the best. A SUMMER AFTERNOON A languid atmosphere, a lazy breeze, With labored respiration, moves the wheat From distant reaches, till the golden seas Break in crisp whispers at my feet. My book, neglected of an idle mind, Hides for a moment from the eyes of men; Or, lightly opened by a critic wind, Affrightedly reviews itself again. Off through the haze that dances in the shine The warm sun showers in the open glade, The forest lies, a silhouette design Dimmed through and through with shade. A dreamy day; and tranquilly I lie At anchor from all storms of mental strain; With absent vision, gazing at the sky, âLike one that hears it rain.â The Katydid, so boisterous last night, Clinging, inverted, in uneasy poise, Beneath a wheat-blade, has forgotten quite If âKaty did or didn'tâ make a noise. The twitter, sometimes, of a wayward bird That checks the song abruptly at the sound, And mildly, chiding echoes that have stirred, Sink into silence, all the more profound. And drowsily I hear the plaintive strain Of some poor dove ... Why, I can scarcely keep My heavy eyelidsâthere it is againâ âCoo-coo!ââI mustn'tââCoo-coo!ââfall asleep! AT LAST A dark, tempestuous night; the stars shut in With shrouds of fog; an inky, jet-black blot The firmament; and where the moon has been An hour agone seems like the darkest spot. The weird windâfurious at its demon gameâ Rattles one's fancy like a window-frame. A care-worn face peers out into the dark, And childish facesâfrightened at the gloomâ Grow awed and vacant as they turn to mark The father's as he passes through the room: The gate latch clatters, and wee baby Bess Whispers, âThe doctor's tummin' now, I dess!â The father turns; a sharp, swift flash of pain Flits o'er his face: âAmanda, child! I said A moment sinceâI see I must againâ Go take your little sisters off to bed! There, Effie, Rose, and Clara mustn't cry!â âI tan't he'p itâI'm fyaid 'at mama'll die!â What are his feelings, when this man alone Sits in the silence, glaring in the grate That sobs and sighs on in an undertone As stoicalâimmovable as Fate, While muffled voices from the sick one's room Come in like heralds of a dreaded doom? The door-latch jingles: in the doorway stands The doctor, while the draft puffs in a breathâ The dead coals leap to life, and clap their hands, The flames flash up. A face as pale as death Turns slowlyâteeth tight clenched, and with a look The doctor, through his specs, reads like a book. âCome, brace up, Mayor!âââLet me know the worst!â âW'y you're the biggest fool I ever sawâ Here, Majorâtake a little brandy firstâ There! She's a boyâI mean he isâhurrah!â âWake up the other girlsâand shout for joyâ Eureka is his nameâI've found A BOY!â FARMER WHIPPLEâBACHELOR It's a mystery to see meâa man o' fifty-four, Who's lived a cross old bachelor fer thirty year' and moreâ A-lookin' glad and smilin'! And they's none o' you can say That you can guess the reason why I feel so good to-day! I must tell you all about it! But I'll have to deviate A little in beginnin', so's to set the matter straight As to how it comes to happen that I never took a wifeâ Kindo' âcrawfishâ from the Present to the Springtime of my life! I was brought up in the country: Of a family of fiveâ Three brothers and a sisterâI'm the only one alive,â Fer they all died little babies; and 'twas one o' Mother's ways, You know, to want a daughter; so she took a girl to raise. The sweetest little thing she was, with rosy cheeks, and fatâ We was little chunks o' shavers then about as high as that! But someway we sort o' suited-like! and Mother she'd declare She never laid her eyes on a more lovin' pair Than we was! So we growed up side by side fer thirteen year', And every hour of it she growed to me more dear!â W'y, even Father's dyin', as he did, I do believe Warn't more affectin' to me than it was to see her grieve! I was then a lad o' twenty; and I felt a flash o' pride In thinkin' all depended on me now to pervide Fer Mother and fer Mary; and I went about the place With sleeves rolled upâand workin', with a mighty smilin' face.â Fer somepin' else was workin'! but not a word I said Of a certain sort o' notion that was runnin' through my head,â âSome day I'd maybe marry, and a brother's love was one Thingâa lover's was another!â was the way the notion run! I remember onc't in harvest, when the âcradle-in'â was done, (When the harvest of my summers mounted up to twenty-one), I was ridin' home with Mary at the closin' o' the dayâ A-chawin' straws and thinkin', in a lover's lazy way! And Mary's cheeks was burnin' like the sunset down the lane: I noticed she was thinkin', too, and ast her to explain. Wellâwhen she turned and kissed me, with her arms around meâlaw! I'd a bigger load o' Heaven than I had a load o' straw! I don't p'tend to learnin', but I'll tell you what's a fac', They's a mighty truthful sayin' somers in a' almanacâ Er somersâ'bout âpuore happinessââperhaps some folks'll laugh At the idyââonly lastin' jest two seconds and a half.ââ But it's jest as true as preachin'!âfer that was a sister's kiss, And a sister's lovin' confidence a-tellin' to me this:â âShe was happy, bein' promised to the son o' Farmer Brown.ââ And my feelin's struck a pardnership with sunset and went down! I don't know how I acted, and I don't know what I said,â Fer my heart seemed jest a-turnin' to an ice-cold lump o' lead; And the hosses kind o' glimmered before me in the road, And the lines fell from my fingersâAnd that was all I knowedâ Ferâwell, I don't know how longâThey's a dim rememberence Of a sound o' snortin' horses, and a stake-and-ridered fence A-whizzin' past, and wheat-sheaves a-dancin' in the air, And Mary screamin' âMurder!â and a-runnin' up to where I was layin' by the roadside, and the wagon upside down A-leanin' on the gate-post, with the wheels a-whirlin' roun'! And I tried to raise and meet her, but I couldn't, with a vague Sort o' notion comin' to me that I had a broken leg. Well, the women nussed me through it; but many a time I'd sigh As I'd keep a-gittin' better instid o' goin' to die, And wonder what was left me worth livin' fer below, When the girl I loved was married to another, don't you know! And my thoughts was as rebellious as the folks was good and kind When Brown and Mary marriedâRailly must 'a' been my mind Was kind o' out o' kilter!âfer I hated Brown, you see, Worse'n pizenâand the feller whittled crutches out fer meâ And done a thousand little ac's o' kindness and respec'â And me a-wishin' all the time that I could break his neck! My relief was like a mourner's when the funeral is done When they moved to Illinois in the Fall o' Forty-one. Then I went to work in airnestâI had nothin' much in view But to drownd out rickollectionsâand it kep' me busy, too! But I slowly thrived and prospered, tel Mother used to say She expected yit to see me a wealthy man some day. Then I'd think how little money was, compared to happinessâ And who'd be left to use it when I died I couldn't guess! But I've still kep' speculatin' and a-gainin' year by year, Tel I'm payin' half the taxes in the county, mighty near! Well!âA year ago er better, a letter comes to hand Astin' how I'd like to dicker fer some Illinois landâ âThe feller that had owned it,â it went ahead to state, âHad jest deceased, insolvent, leavin' chance to speculate,ââ And then it closed by sayin' that I'd âbetter come and see.ââ I'd never been West, anyhowâa'most too wild fer me, I'd allus had a notion; but a lawyer here in town Said I'd find myself mistakend when I come to look around. So I bids good-by to Mother, and I jumps aboard the train, A-thinkin' what I'd bring her when I come back home againâ And ef she'd had an idy what the present was to be, I think it's more'n likely she'd 'a' went along with me! Cars is awful tejus ridin', fer all they go so fast! But finally they called out my stoppin'-place at last: And that night, at the tavern, I dreamp' I was a train O' cars, and skeered at somepin', runnin' down a country lane! Well, in the morning airlyâafter huntin' up the manâ The lawyer who was wantin' to swap the piece o' landâ We started fer the country; and I ast the history Of the farmâits former ownerâand so forth, etcetery! Andâwellâit was interestin'âI su'prised him, I suppose, By the loud and frequent manner in which I blowed my nose!â But his su'prise was greater, and it made him wonder more, When I kissed and hugged the widder when she met us at the door!â It was Mary: ... They's a feelin' a-hidin' down in hereâ Of course I can't explain it, ner ever make it clear.â It was with us in that meetin', I don't want you to fergit! And it makes me kind o'nervous when I think about it yit! I bought that farm, and deeded it, afore I left the town, With âtitle clear to mansions in the skies,â to Mary Brown! And fu'thermore, I took her and the childrenâfer you see, They'd never seed their Grandmaâand I fetched 'em home with me. So now you've got an idy why a man o' fifty-four, Who's lived a cross old bachelor fer thirty year' and more, Is a-lookin' glad and smilin'!âAnd I've jest come into town To git a pair o' license fer to marry Mary Brown. MY JOLLY FRIEND'S SECRET Ah, friend of mine, how goes it Since you've taken you a mate?â Your smile, though, plainly shows it Is a very happy state! Dan Cupid's necromancy! You must sit you down and dine, And lubricate your fancy With a glass or two of wine. And as you have âdeserted,â As my other chums have done, While I laugh alone diverted, As you drop off one by oneâ And I've remained unwedded, Tillâyou seeâlook hereâthat I'm, In a manner, âsnatched bald-headedâ By the sportive hand of Time! I'm an âold 'un!â yes, but wrinkles Are not so plenty, quite, As to cover up the twinkles Of the boyâain't I right? Yet, there are ghosts of kisses Under this mustache of mine My mem'ry only misses When I drown 'em out with wine. From acknowledgment so ample, You would hardly take me for What I amâa perfect sample Of a âjolly bachelorâ; Not a bachelor has being When he laughs at married life But his heart and soul's agreeing That he ought to have a wife! Ah, ha! old chum, this claret, Like Fatima, holds the key Of the old Blue-Beardish garret Of my hidden mystery! Did you say you'd like to listen? Ah, my boy! the âSad No More!â And the tear-drops that will glistenâ Turn the catch upon the door, And sit you down beside me, And put yourself at easeâ I'll trouble you to slide me That wine decanter, please; The path is kind o' mazy Where my fancies have to go, And my heart gets sort o' lazy On the journeyâdon't you know? Let me seeâwhen I was twentyâ It's a lordly age, my boy, When a fellow's money's plenty, And the leisure to enjoyâ And a girlâwith hair as golden Asâthat; and lipsâwellâquite As red as this I'm holdin' Between you and the light. And eyes and a complexionâ Ah, heavens!âle'-me-seeâ Well,âjust in this connection,â Did you lock that door for me? Did I start in recitation My past life to recall? Well, that's an indication I am purty tightâthat's all! THE SPEEDING OF THE KING'S SPITE A kingâestranged from his loving Queen By a foolish royal whimâ Tired and sick of the dull routine Of matters surrounding himâ Issued a mandate in this wise:â âThe dower of my daughter's hand I will give to him who holds this prize, The strangest thing in the land.â But the King, sad sooth! in this grim decree Had a motive low and mean;â 'Twas a royal piece of chicanery To harry and spite the Queen; For King though he was, and beyond compare, He had ruled all things save oneâ Then blamed the Queen that his only heir Was a daughterânot a son. The girl had grown, in the mother's care, Like a bud in the shine and shower That drinks of the wine of the balmy air Till it blooms into matchless flower; Her waist was the rose's stem that bore The flowerâand the flower's perfumeâ That ripens on till it bulges o'er With its wealth of bud and bloom. And she had a loverâlowly sprung,â But a purer, nobler heart Never spake in a courtlier tongue Or wooed with a dearer art: And the fair pair paled at the King's decree; But the smiling Fates contrived To have them wed, in a secrecy That the Queen herself connivedâ While the grim King's heralds scoured the land And the countries roundabout, Shouting aloud, at the King's command, A challenge to knave or lout, Prince or peasant,ââThe mighty King Would have ye understand That he who shows him the strangest thing Shall have his daughter's hand!â And thousands flocked to the royal throne, Bringing a thousand things Strange and curious;âOne, a boneâ The hinge of a fairy's wings; And one, the glass of a mermaid queen, Gemmed with a diamond dew, Where, down in its reflex, dimly seen, Her face smiled out at you. One brought a cluster of some strange date, With a subtle and searching tang That seemed, as you tasted, to penetrate The heart like a serpent's fang; And back you fell for a spell entranced, As cold as a corpse of stone, And heard your brains, as they laughed and danced And talked in an undertone. One brought a bird that could whistle a tune So piercingly pure and sweet, That tears would fall from the eyes of the moon In dewdrops at its feet; And the winds would sigh at the sweet refrain, Till they swooned in an ecstacy, To waken again in a hurricane Of riot and jubilee. One brought a lute that was wrought of a shell Luminous as the shine Of a new-born star in a dewy dell,â And its strings were strands of wine That sprayed at the Fancy's touch and fused, As your listening spirit leant Drunken through with the airs that oozed From the o'ersweet instrument. One brought a tablet of ivory Whereon no thing was writ,â But, at nightâand the dazzled eyes would see Flickering lines o'er it,â And each, as you read from the magic tome, Lightened and died in flame, And the memory held but a golden poem Too beautiful to name. Till it seemed all marvels that ever were known Or dreamed of under the sun Were brought and displayed at the royal throne, And put by, one by one;â Till a graybeard monster came to the Kingâ Haggard and wrinkled and oldâ And spread to his gaze this wondrous thing,â A gossamer veil of gold.â Strangely marvelousâmocking the gaze Like a tangle of bright sunshine, Dipping a million glittering rays In a baptism divine: And a maiden, sheened in this gauze attireâ Sifting a glance of her eyeâ Dazzled men's souls with a fierce desire To kiss and caress her andâdie. And the grim King swore by his royal beard That the veil had won the prize, While the gray old monster blinked and leered With his lashless, red-rimmed eyes, As the fainting form of the princess fell, And the mother's heart went wild, Throbbing and swelling a muffled knell For the dead hopes of her child. But her clouded face with a faint smile shone, As suddenly, through the throng, Pushing his way to the royal throne, A fair youth strode along, While a strange smile hovered about his eyes, As he said to the grim old King:â âThe veil of gold must lose the prize; For I have a stranger thing.â He bent and whispered a sentence brief; But the monarch shook his head, With a look expressive of unbeliefâ âIt can't be so,â he said; âOr give me proof; and I, the King, Give you my daughter's hand,â For certes THAT is a stranger thingâ The strangest thing in the land!â Then the fair youth, turning, caught the Queen In a rapturous caress, While his lithe form towered in lordly mien, As he said in a brief address:â âMy fair bride's mother is this; and, lo, As you stare in your royal awe, By this pure kiss do I proudly show A love for a mother-in-law!â Then a thaw set in the old King's mood, And a sweet Spring freshet came Into his eyes, and his heart renewed Its love for the favored dame: But often he has been heard to declare That âhe never could clearly see How, in the deuce, such a strange affair Could have ended so happily!â JOB WORK âWrite me a rhyme of the present timeâ And the poet took his pen And wrote such lines as the miser minds Hide in the hearts of men. He grew enthused, as the poets used When their fingers kissed the strings Of some sweet lyre, and caught the fire True inspiration brings, And sang the song of a nation's wrongâ Of the patriot's galling chain, And the glad release that the angel, Peace, Has given him again. He sang the lay of religion's sway, Where a hundred creeds clasp hands And shout in glee such a symphony That the whole world understands. He struck the key of monopoly, And sang of her swift decay, And traveled the track of the railway back With a blithesome roundelayâ Of the tranquil bliss of a true love kiss; And painted the picture, too, Of the wedded life, and the patient wife, And the husband fond and true; And sang the joy that a noble boy Brings to a father's soul, Who lets the wine as a mocker shine Stagnated in the bowl. And he stabbed his pen in the ink again, And wrote, with a writhing frown, âThis is the end.â âAnd now, my friend, You may print itâupside down!â PRIVATE THEATRICALS A quite convincing axiom Is, âLife is like a playâ; For, turning back its pages some Few dog-eared years away, I find where I Committed my Love-taleâwith brackets where to sigh. I feel an idle interest To read again the page; I enter, as a lover dressed, At twenty years of age, And play the part With throbbing heart, And all an actor's glowing art. And she who plays my Lady-love Excels!âHer loving glance Has power her audience to moveâ I am her audience.â Her acting tact, To tell the fact, âBrings down the houseâ in every act. And often we defy the curse Of storms and thunder-showers, To meet together and rehearse This little play of oursâ I think, when she âMakes loveâ to me, She kisses very naturally! Yes; it's convincingâratherâ That âLife is like a playâ: I am playing âHeavy Fatherâ In a âScreaming Farceâ to-day, That so âbrings down The house,â I frown, And fain would âring the curtain down.â PLAIN SERMONS I saw a manâand envied him besideâ Because of this world's goods he had great store; But even as I envied him, he died, And left me envious of him no more. I saw another manâand envied stillâ Because he was content with frugal lot; But as I envied him, the rich man's will Bequeathed him all, and envy I forgot. Yet still another man I saw, and he I envied for a calm and tranquil mind That nothing fretted in the least degreeâ Until, alas! I found that he was blind. What vanity is envy! for I find I have been rich in dross of thought, and poor In that I was a fool, and lastly blindâ For never having seen myself before! âTRADIN' JOEâ I'm one o' these cur'ous kind o' chaps You think you know when you don't, perhaps! I hain't no foolâner I don't p'tend To be so smart I could rickommend Myself fer a congressman, my friend!â But I'm kind o' betwixt-and-between, you know,â One o' these fellers 'at folks call âslow.â And I'll say jest here I'm kind o' queer Regardin' things 'at I see and hear,â Fer I'm thick o' hearin' sometimes, and It's hard to git me to understand; But other times it hain't, you bet! Fer I don't sleep with both eyes shet! I've swapped a power in stock, and so The neighbers calls me âTradin' Joeââ And I'm goin' to tell you 'bout a trade,â And one o' the best I ever made: Folks has gone so fur's to say 'At I'm well fixed, in a worldly way, And bein' so, and a widower, It's not su'prisin', as you'll infer, I'm purty handy among the sectâ Widders especially, rickollect! And I won't deny that along o' late I've hankered a heap fer the married stateâ But some way o' 'nother the longer we wait The harder it is to discover a mate. Marshall Thomas,âa friend o' mine, Doin' some in the tradin' line, But a'most too young to know it allâ On'y at picnics er some ball!â Says to me, in a banterin' way, As we was a-loadin' stock one day,â âYou're a-huntin' a wife, and I want you to see My girl's mother, at Kankakee!â She hain't over fortyâgood-lookin' and spry, And jest the woman to fill your eye! And I'm a-goin' there Sund'y,âand now,â says he, âI want to take you along with me; And you marry her, and,â he says, âby 'shaw! You'll hev me fer yer son-in-law!â I studied a while, and says I, âWell, I'll First have to see ef she suits my style; And ef she does, you kin bet your life Your mother-in-law will be my wife!â Well, Sund'y come; and I fixed up someâ Putt on a collarâI did, by gum!â Got down my âplug,â and my satin vestâ (You wouldn't know me to see me dressed!â But any one knows ef you got the clothes You kin go in the crowd wher' the best of 'em goes!) And I greeced my boots, and combed my hair Keerfully over the bald place there; And Marshall Thomas and me that day Eat our dinners with Widder Gray And her girl Han'! Well, jest a glance O' the widder's smilin' countenance, A-cuttin' up chicken and big pot-pies, Would make a man hungry in Paradise! And passin' p'serves and jelly and cake 'At would make an angel's appetite ache!â Pourin' out coffee as yaller as goldâ Twic't as much as the cup could holdâ La! it was rich!âAnd then she'd say, âTake some o' this!â in her coaxin' way, Tell ef I'd been a hoss I'd 'a' foundered, shore, And jest dropped dead on her white-oak floor! Well, the way I talked would 'a' done you good, Ef you'd 'a' been there to 'a' understood; Tel I noticed Hanner and Marshall, they Was a-noticin' me in a cur'ous way; So I says to myse'f, says I, âNow, Joe, The best thing fer you is to jest go slow!â And I simmered down, and let them do The bulk o' the talkin' the evening through. And Marshall was still in a talkative gait When he left, that eveningâtolable late. âHow do you like her?â he says to me; Says I, âShe suits, to a ât-y-Teeâ!â And then I ast how matters stood With him in the opposite neighberhood? âBully!â he says; âI ruther guess I'll finally git her to say the âyes.â I named it to her to-night, and she Kind o' smiled, and said âshe'd seeââ And that's a purty good sign!â says he: âYes,â says I, âyou're ahead o' me!â And then he laughed, and said, âGo in!â And patted me on the shoulder ag'in. Well, ever sense then I've been ridin' a good Deal through the Kankakee neighberhood; And I make it convenient sometimes to stop And hitch a few minutes, and kind o' drop In at the widder's, and talk o' the crop And one thing o' 'nother. And week afore last The notion struck me, as I drove past, I'd stop at the place and state my caseâ Might as well do it at first as last! I felt first-rate; so I hitched at the gate, And went up to the house; and, strange to relate, Marshall Thomas had dropped in, too.â âGlad to see you, sir, how do you do?â He says, says he! Wellâit sounded queer: And when Han' told me to take a cheer, Marshall got up and putt out o' the roomâ And motioned his hand fer the widder to come. I didn't say nothin' fer quite a spell, But thinks I to myse'f, âThere's a dog in the well!â And Han' she smiled so cur'ous at meâ Says I, âWhat's up?â And she says, says she, âMarshall's been at me to marry ag'in, And I told him âno,â jest as you come in.â Well, somepin' o' 'nother in that girl's voice Says to me, âJoseph, here's your choice!â And another minute her guileless breast Was lovin'ly throbbin' ag'in my vest!â And then I kissed her, and heerd a smack Come like a' echo a-flutterin' back, And we looked around, and in full view Marshall was kissin' the widder, too! Well, we all of us laughed, in our glad su'prise, Tel the tears come a-streamin' out of our eyes! And when Marsh said â'Twas the squarest trade That ever me and him had made,â We both shuck hands, 'y jucks! and swore We'd stick together ferevermore. And old Squire Chipman tuck us the trip: And Marshall and me's in pardnership!

I SMOKE MY PIPE I can't extend to every friend In need a helping handâ No matter though I wish it so, 'Tis not as Fortune planned; But haply may I fancy they Are men of different stripe Than others think who hint and wink,â And soâI smoke my pipe! A golden coal to crown the bowlâ My pipe and I alone,â I sit and muse with idler views Perchance than I should own:â It might be worse to own the purse Whose glutted bowels gripe In little qualms of stinted alms; And so I smoke my pipe. And if inclined to moor my mind And cast the anchor Hope, A puff of breath will put to death The morbid misanthrope That lurks insideâas errors hide In standing forms of type To mar at birth some line of worth; And so I smoke my pipe. The subtle stings misfortune flings Can give me little pain When my narcotic spell has wrought This quiet in my brain: When I can waste the past in taste So luscious and so ripe That like an elf I hug myself; And so I smoke my pipe. And wrapped in shrouds of drifting clouds I watch the phantom's flight, Till alien eyes from Paradise Smile on me as I write: And I forgive the wrongs that live, As lightly as I wipe Away the tear that rises here; And so I smoke my pipe. RED RIDING-HOOD Sweet little myth of the nursery storyâ Earliest love of mine infantile breast, Be something tangible, bloom in thy glory Into existence, as thou art addressed! Hasten! appear to me, guileless and goodâ Thou are so dear to me, Red Riding-Hood! Azure-blue eyes, in a marvel of wonder, Over the dawn of a blush breaking out; Sensitive nose, with a little smile under Trying to hide in a blossoming poutâ Couldn't be serious, try as you would, Little mysterious Red Riding-Hood! Hah! little girl, it is desolate, lonely, Out in this gloomy old forest of Life!â Here are not pansies and buttercups onlyâ Brambles and briers as keen as a knife; And a Heart, ravenous, trails in the wood For the meal have he must,âRed Riding-Hood! IF I KNEW WHAT POETS KNOW If I knew what poets know, Would I write a rhyme Of the buds that never blow In the summer-time? Would I sing of golden seeds Springing up in ironweeds? And of rain-drops turned to snow, If I knew what poets know? Did I know what poets do, Would I sing a song Sadder than the pigeon's coo When the days are long? Where I found a heart in pain, I would make it glad again; And the false should be the true, Did I know what poets do. If I knew what poets know, I would find a theme Sweeter than the placid flow Of the fairest dream: I would sing of love that lives On the errors it forgives; And the world would better grow If I knew what poets know. AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE An old sweetheart of mine!âIs this her presence here with me, Or but a vain creation of a lover's memory? A fair, illusive vision that would vanish into air Dared I even touch the silence with the whisper of a prayer? Nay, let me then believe in all the blended false and trueâ The semblance of the old love and the substance of the new,â The then of changeless sunny daysâthe now of shower and shineâ But Love forever smilingâas that old sweetheart of mine. This ever-restful sense of home, though shouts ring in the hall.â The easy chairâthe old book-shelves and prints along the wall; The rare Habanas in their box, or gaunt church-warden-stem That often wags, above the jar, derisively at them. As one who cons at evening o'er an album, all alone, And muses on the faces of the friends that he has known, So I turn the leaves of Fancy, till, in shadowy design, I find the smiling features of an old sweetheart of mine. The lamplight seems to glimmer with a flicker of surprise, As I turn it lowâto rest me of the dazzle in my eyes, And light my pipe in silence, save a sigh that seems to yoke Its fate with my tobacco and to vanish with the smoke. 'Tis a fragrant retrospection,âfor the loving thoughts that start Into being are like perfume from the blossom of the heart; And to dream the old dreams over is a luxury divineâ When my truant fancies wander with that old sweetheart of mine. Though I hear beneath my study, like a fluttering of wings, The voices of my children and the mother as she singsâ I feel no twinge of conscience to deny me any theme When Care has cast her anchor in the harbor of a dreamâ In fact, to speak in earnest, I believe it adds a charm To spice the good a trifle with a little dust of harm,â For I find an extra flavor in Memory's mellow wine That makes me drink the deeper to that old sweetheart of mine. O Childhood-days enchanted! O the magic of the Spring!â With all green boughs to blossom white, and all bluebirds to sing! When all the air, to toss and quaff, made life a jubilee And changed the children's song and laugh to shrieks of ecstasy. With eyes half closed in clouds that ooze from lips that taste, as well, The peppermint and cinnamon, I hear the old School bell, And from âRecessâ romp in again from âBlackman'sâ broken line, To smile, behind my âlesson,â at that old sweetheart of mine. A face of lily-beauty, with a form of airy grace, Floats out of my tobacco as the Genii from the vase; And I thrill beneath the glances of a pair of azure eyes As glowing as the summer and as tender as the skies. I can see the pink sunbonnet and the little checkered dress She wore when first I kissed her and she answered the caress With the written declaration that, âas surely as the vine Grew 'round the stamp,â she loved meâthat old sweetheart of mine. Again I made her presents, in a really helpless way,â The big âRhode Island GreeningââI was hungry, too, that day!â But I follow her from Spelling, with her hand behind herâsoâ And I slip the apple in itâand the Teacher doesn't know! I give my treasures to herâall,âmy pencilâblue-and-red;â And, if little girls played marbles, mine should all be hers, instead! But she gave me her photograph, and printed âEver Thineâ Across the backâin blue-and-redâthat old sweetheart of mine! And again I feel the pressure of her slender little hand, As we used to talk together of the future we had planned,â When I should be a poet, and with nothing else to do But write the tender verses that she set the music to ... When we should live together in a cozy little cot Hid in a nest of roses, with a fairy garden-spot, Where the vines were ever fruited, and the weather ever fine, And the birds were ever singing for that old sweetheart of mine. When I should be her lover forever and a day, And she my faithful sweetheart till the golden hair was gray; And we should be so happy that when either's lips were dumb They would not smile in Heaven till the other's kiss had come. But, ah! my dream is broken by a step upon the stair, And the door is softly opened, andâmy wife is standing there: Yet with eagerness and rapture all my visions I resign,â To greet the living presence of that old sweetheart of mine. SQUIRE HAWKINS'S STORY I hain't no hand at tellin' tales, Er spinnin' yarns, as the sailors say; Someway o' 'nother, language fails To slide fer me in the oily way That lawyers has; and I wisht it would, Fer I've got somepin' that I call good; But bein' only a country squire, I've learned to listen and admire, Ruther preferrin' to be addressed Than talk myse'fâbut I'll do my best:â Old Jeff Thompsonâwell, I'll say, Was the clos'test man I ever saw!â Rich as cream, but the porest pay, And the meanest man to work ferâLa! I've knowed that man to work one âhandââ Fer little er nothin', you understandâ From four o'clock in the morning light Tel eight and nine o'clock at night, And then find fault with his appetite! He'd drive all over the neighberhood To miss the place where a toll-gate stood, And slip in town, by some old road That no two men in the country knowed, With a jag o' wood, and a sack o' wheat, That wouldn't burn and you couldn't eat! And the trades he'd make, 'll I jest de-clare, Was enough to make a preacher swear! And then he'd hitch, and hang about Tel the lights in the toll-gate was blowed out, And then the turnpike he'd turn in And sneak his way back home ag'in! Some folks hint, and I make no doubt, That that's what wore his old wife outâ Toilin' away from day to day And year to year, through heat and cold, Uncomplainin'âthe same old way The martyrs died in the days of old; And a-clingin', too, as the martyrs done, To one fixed faith, and her only one,â Little Patience, the sweetest child That ever wept unrickonciled, Er felt the pain and the ache and sting That only a mother's death can bring. Patience Thompson!âI think that name Must 'a' come from a power above, Fer it seemed to fit her jest the same As a gaiter would, er a fine kid glove! And to see that girl, with all the care Of the household on herâI de-clare It was oudacious, the work she'd do, And the thousand plans that she'd putt through; And sing like a medder-lark all day long, And drowned her cares in the joys o' song; And laugh sometimes tel the farmer's âhand,â Away fur off in the fields, would stand A-listenin', with the plow half drawn, Tel the coaxin' echoes called him on; And the furries seemed, in his dreamy eyes, Like foot-paths a-leadin' to Paradise, As off through the hazy atmosphere The call fer dinner reached his ear. Now love's as cunnin' a little thing As a hummin'-bird upon the wing, And as liable to poke his nose Jest where folks would least suppose,â And more'n likely build his nest Right in the heart you'd leave unguessed, And live and thrive at your expenseâ At least, that's my experience. And old Jeff Thompson often thought, In his se'fish way, that the quiet John Was a stiddy chap, as a farm-hand ought To always be,âfer the airliest dawn Found John busyâand âeasy,â too, Whenever his wages would fall due!â To sum him up with a final touch, He eat so little and worked so much, That old Jeff laughed to hisse'f and said, âHe makes me money and airns his bread!â But John, fer all of his quietude, Would sometimes drap a word er so That none but Patience understood, And none but her was meant to know!â Maybe at meal-times John would say, As the sugar-bowl come down his way, âThanky, no; my coffee's sweet Enough fer me!â with sich conceit, She'd know at once, without no doubt, He meant because she poured it out; And smile and blush, and all sich stuff, And ast ef it was âstrong enough?â And git the answer, neat and trim, âIt couldn't be too âstrongâ fer him!â And so things went fer 'bout a year, Tel John, at last, found pluck to go And pour his tale in the old man's earâ And ef it had been hot lead, I know It couldn't 'a' raised a louder fuss, Ner 'a' riled the old man's temper wuss! He jest lit in, and cussed and swore, And lunged and rared, and ripped and tore, And told John jest to leave his door, And not to darken it no more! But Patience cried, with eyes all wet, âRemember, John, and don't ferget, Whatever comes, I love you yet!â But the old man thought, in his se'fish way, âI'll see her married rich some day; And that,â thinks he, âis money fer meâ And my will's law, as it ought to be!â So when, in the course of a month er so, A widower, with a farm er two, Comes to Jeff's, w'y, the folks, you know, Had to talkâas the folks'll do: It was the talk of the neighberhoodâ Patience and John, and their affairs;â And this old chap with a few gray hairs Had âcut John out,â it was understood. And some folks reckoned âPatience, too, Knowed what she was a-goin' to doâ It was like herâla! indeed!â All she loved was dollars and centsâ Like old Jeffâand they saw no need Fer John to pine at her negligence!â But others said, in a kinder way, They missed the songs she used to singâ They missed the smiles that used to play Over her face, and the laughin' ring Of her glad voiceâthat everything Of her old se'f seemed dead and gone, And this was the ghost that they gazed on! Tel finally it was noised about There was a weddin' soon to be Down at Jeff's; and the âcat was outâ Shore enough!âLl the Jee-mum-nee! It riled me when John told me so,â Fer I was a friend o' John's, you know; And his trimblin' voice jest broke in twoâ As a feller's voice'll sometimes do.â And I says, says I, âEf I know my bizâ And I think I know what jestice is,â I've read some lawâand I'd advise A man like you to wipe his eyes And square his jaws and start ag'in, Fer jestice is a-goin' to win!â And it wasn't long tel his eyes had cleared As blue as the skies, and the sun appeared In the shape of a good old-fashioned smile That I hadn't seen fer a long, long while. So we talked on fer a' hour er more, And sunned ourselves in the open door,â Tel a hoss-and-buggy down the road Come a-drivin' up, that I guess John knowed,â Fer he winked and says, âI'll dessappearâ They'd smell a mice ef they saw me here!â And he thumbled his nose at the old gray mare, And hid hisse'f in the house somewhere. Well.âThe rig drove up: and I raised my head As old Jeff hollered to me and said That âhim and his old friend there had come To see ef the squire was at home.â ... I told 'em âI was; and I aimed to be At every chance of a weddin'-fee!â And then I laughedâand they laughed, too,â Fer that was the object they had in view. âWould I be on hands at eight that night?â They ast; and 's-I, âYou're mighty right, I'll be on hand!â And then I bu'st Out a-laughin' my very wu'st,â And so did they, as they wheeled away And drove to'rds town in a cloud o' dust. Then I shet the door, and me and John Laughed and laughed, and jest laughed on, Tel Mother drapped her specs, and by Jeewhillikers! I thought she'd die!â And she couldn't 'a' told, I'll bet my hat, What on earth she was laughin' at! But all o' the fun o' the tale hain't done!â Fer a drizzlin' rain had jest begun, And a-havin' 'bout four mile' to ride, I jest concluded I'd better light Out fer Jeff's and save my hide,â Fer it was a-goin' to storm, that night! So we went down to the barn, and John Saddled my beast, and I got on; And he told me somepin' to not ferget, And when I left, he was laughin' yet. And, 'proachin' on to my journey's end, The great big draps o' the rain come down, And the thunder growled in a way to lend An awful look to the lowerin' frown The dull sky wore; and the lightnin' glanced Tel my old mare jest more'n pranced, And tossed her head, and bugged her eyes To about four times their natchurl size, As the big black lips of the clouds 'ud drap Out some oath of a thunderclap, And threaten on in an undertone That chilled a feller clean to the bone! But I struck shelter soon enough To save myse'f. And the house was jammed With the women-folks, and the weddin'-stuff:â A great, long table, fairly crammed With big pound-cakesâand chops and steaksâ And roasts and stewsâand stumick-aches Of every fashion, form, and size, From twisters up to punkin-pies! And candies, oranges, and figs, And reezins,âall the âwhilligigsâ And âjim-cracksâ that the law allows On sich occasions!âBobs and bows Of gigglin' girls, with corkscrew curls, And fancy ribbons, reds and blues, And âbeau-ketchersâ and âcurliquesâ To beat the world! And seven o'clock Brought old Jeff;âand broughtâthe groom,â With a sideboard-collar on, and stock That choked him so, he hadn't room To swaller in, er even sneeze, Er clear his th'oat with any ease Er comfortâand a good square cough Would saw his Adam's apple off! But as fer PatienceâMy! Oomh-oomh!â I never saw her look so sweet!â Her face was cream and roses, too; And then them eyes o' heavenly blue Jest made an angel all complete! And when she split 'em up in smiles And splintered 'em around the room, And danced acrost and met the groom, And laughed out loudâIt kind o' spiles My language when I come to thatâ Fer, as she laid away his hat, Thinks I, âThe papers hid inside Of that said hat must make a bride A happy one fer all her life, Er else a wrecked and wretched wife!â And, someway, then, I thought of John,â Then looked towards Patience. ... She was gone!â The door stood open, and the rain Was dashin' in; and sharp and plain Above the storm we heerd a cryâ A ringin', laughin', loud âGood-by!â That died away, as fleet and fast A hoss's hoofs went splashin' past! And that was all. 'Twas done that quick! ... You've heerd o' fellers âlookin' sickâ? I wisht you'd seen the groom jest thenâ I wisht you'd seen them two old men, With starin' eyes that fairly glared At one another, and the scared And empty faces of the crowd,â I wisht you could 'a' been allowed To jest look on and see it all,â And heerd the girls and women bawl And wring their hands; and heerd old Jeff A-cussin' as he swung hisse'f Upon his hoss, who champed his bit As though old Nick had holt of it: And cheek by jowl the two old wrecks Rode off as though they'd break their necks. And as we all stood starin' out Into the night, I felt the brush Of some one's hand, and turned about, And heerd a voice that whispered, âHush!â They're waitin' in the kitchen, and You're wanted. Don't you understand?â Well, ef my memory serves me now, I think I winked.âWell, anyhow, I left the crowd a-gawkin' there, And jest slipped off around to where The back door opened, and went in, And turned and shet the door ag'in, And maybe locked itâcouldn't swear,â A woman's arms around me makes Me liable to make mistakes.â I read a marriage license nex', But as I didn't have my specs I jest inferred it was all right, And tied the knot so mortal-tight That Patience and my old friend John Was safe enough from that time on! Well, now, I might go on and tell How all the joke at last leaked out, And how the youngsters raised the yell And rode the happy groom about Upon their shoulders; how the bride Was kissed a hundred times beside The one I give her,âtel she cried And laughed untel she like to died! I might go on and tell you all About the supperâand the ball.â You'd ought to see me twist my heel Through jest one old Furginny reel Afore you die! er tromp the strings Of some old fiddle tel she sings Some old cowtillion, don't you know, That putts the devil in yer toe! We kep' the dancin' up tel four O'clock, I reckonâmaybe more.â We hardly heerd the thunders roar, Er thought about the storm that blowedâ And them two fellers on the road! Tel all at onc't we heerd the door Bu'st open, and a voice that swore,â And old Jeff Thompson tuck the floor. He shuck hisse'f and looked around Like some old dog about half-drownedâ His hat, I reckon, weighed ten pound To say the least, and I'll say, shore, His overcoat weighed fifty moreâ The wettest man you ever saw, To have so dry a son-in-law! He sized it all; and Patience laid Her hand in John's, and looked afraid, And waited. And a stiller set O' folks, I know, you never met In any court room, where with dread They wait to hear a verdick read. The old man turned his eyes on me: âAnd have you married 'em?â says he. I nodded âYes.â âWell, that'll do,â He says, âand now we're th'ough with you,â You jest clear out, and I decide And promise to be satisfied!â He hadn't nothin' more to say. I saw, of course, how matters lay, And left. But as I rode away I heerd the roosters crow fer day. A COUNTRY PATHWAY I come upon it suddenly, aloneâ A little pathway winding in the weeds That fringe the roadside; and with dreams my own, I wander as it leads. Full wistfully along the slender way, Through summer tan of freckled shade and shine, I take the path that leads me as it mayâ Its every choice is mine. A chipmunk, or a sudden-whirring quail, Is startled by my step as on I fareâ A garter-snake across the dusty trail Glances andâis not there. Above the arching jimson-weeds flare twos And twos of sallow-yellow butterflies, Like blooms of lorn primroses blowing loose When autumn winds arise. The trail dipsâdwindlesâbroadens then, and lifts Itself astride a cross-road dubiously, And, from the fennel marge beyond it, drifts Still onward, beckoning me. And though it needs must lure me mile on mile Out of the public highway, still I go, My thoughts, far in advance in Indian file, Allure me even so. Why, I am as a long-lost boy that went At dusk to bring the cattle to the bars, And was not found again, though Heaven lent His mother all the stars With which to seek him through that awful night. O years of nights as vain!âStars never rise But well might miss their glitter in the light Of tears in mother-eyes! Soâon, with quickened breaths, I follow stillâ My avant-courier must be obeyed! Thus am I led, and thus the path, at will, Invites me to invade A meadow's precincts, where my daring guide Clambers the steps of an old-fashioned stile, And stumbles down again, the other side, To gambol there a while. In pranks of hide-and-seek, as on ahead I see it running, while the clover-stalks Shake rosy fists at me, as though they saidâ âYou dog our country walks âAnd mutilate us with your walking-stick!â We will not suffer tamely what you do, And warn you at your peril,âfor we'll sick Our bumblebees on you!â But I smile back, in airy nonchalance,â The more determined on my wayward quest, As some bright memory a moment dawns A morning in my breastâ Sending a thrill that hurries me along In faulty similes of childish skips, Enthused with lithe contortions of a song Performing on my lips. In wild meanderings o'er pasture wealthâ Erratic wanderings through dead'ning lands, Where sly old brambles, plucking me by stealth, Put berries in my hands: Or the path climbs a boulderâwades a sloughâ Or, rollicking through buttercups and flags, Goes gaily dancing o'er a deep bayou On old tree-trunks and snags: Or, at the creek, leads o'er a limpid pool Upon a bridge the stream itself has made, With some Spring-freshet for the mighty tool That its foundation laid. I pause a moment here to bend and muse, With dreamy eyes, on my reflection, where A boat-backed bug drifts on a helpless cruise, Or wildly oars the air, As, dimly seen, the pirate of the brookâ The pike, whose jaunty hulk denotes his speedâ Swings pivoting about, with wary look Of low and cunning greed. Till, filled with other thought, I turn again To where the pathway enters in a realm Of lordly woodland, under sovereign reign Of towering oak and elm. A puritanic quiet here reviles The almost whispered warble from the hedge, And takes a locust's rasping voice and files The silence to an edge. In such a solitude my somber way Strays like a misanthrope within a gloom Of his own shadowsâtill the perfect day Bursts into sudden bloom, And crowns a long, declining stretch of space, Where King Corn's armies lie with flags unfurled, And where the valley's dint in Nature's face Dimples a smiling world. And lo! through mists that may not be dispelled, I see an old homestead, as in dreams, Where, like a gem in costly setting held, The old log cabin gleams. O darling Pathway! lead me bravely on Adown your valley-way, and run before Among the roses crowding up the lawn And thronging at the door,â And carry up the echo there that shall Arouse the drowsy dog, that he may bay The household out to greet the prodigal That wanders home to-day. THE OLD GUITAR Neglected now is the old guitar And moldering into decay; Fretted with many a rift and scar That the dull dust hides away, While the spider spins a silver star In its silent lips to-day. The keys hold only nerveless stringsâ The sinews of brave old airs Are pulseless now; and the scarf that clings So closely here declares A sad regret in its ravelings And the faded hue it wears. But the old guitar, with a lenient grace, Has cherished a smile for me; And its features hint of a fairer face That comes with a memory Of a flower-and-perfume-haunted place And a moonlit balcony. Music sweeter than words confess, Or the minstrel's powers invent, Thrilled here once at the light caress Of the fairy hands that lent This excuse for the kiss I press On the dear old instrument. The rose of pearl with the jeweled stem Still blooms; and the tiny sets In the circle all are here; the gem In the keys, and the silver frets; But the dainty fingers that danced o'er themâ Alas for the heart's regrets!â Alas for the loosened strings to-day, And the wounds of rift and scar On a worn old heart, with its roundelay Enthralled with a stronger bar That Fate weaves on, through a dull decay Like that of the old guitar! âFRIDAY AFTERNOONâ TO WILLIAM MORRIS PIERSON [1868â1870] Of the wealth of facts and fancies That our memories may recall, The old school-day romances Are the dearest, after all!â When some sweet thought revises The half-forgotten tune That opened âExercisesâ On âFriday Afternoon.â We seem to hear the clicking Of the pencil and the pen, And the solemn, ceaseless ticking Of the timepiece ticking then; And we note the watchful master, As he waves the warning rod, With our own heart beating faster Than the boy's who threw the wad. Some little hand uplifted, And the creaking of a shoe:â A problem left unsifted For the teacher's hand to do: The murmured hum of learningâ And the flutter of a book; The smell of something burning, And the school's inquiring look. The bashful boy in blushes; And the girl, with glancing eyes, Who hides her smiles, and hushes The laugh about to rise,â Then, with a quick invention, Assumes a serious face, To meet the words, âAttenton! Every scholar in his place!â The opening song, page 20.â Ah! dear old âGolden Wreath,â You willed your sweets in plenty; And some who look beneath The leaves of Time will linger, And loving tears will start, As Fancy trails her finger O'er the index of the heart. âGood News from HomeââWe hear it Welling tremulous, yet clear And holy as the spirit Of the song we used to hearâ âGood news for meââ(A throbbing And an aching melody)â âHas come across theââ(sobbing, Yea, and salty) âdark blue sea!â Or the pÃ¦an âScotland's burning!â With its mighty surge and swell Of chorus, still returning To its universal yellâ Till we're almost glad to drop to Something sad and full of painâ And âSkip verse three,â and stop, too, Ere our hearts are broke again. Then âthe big girls'â compositions, With their doubt, and hope, and glow Of heart and face,âconditions Of âthe big boysââeven so,â When themes of âSpring,â and âSummerâ And of âFall,â and âWinter-timeâ Droop our heads and hold us dumber Than the sleigh-bell's fancied chime. Elocutionary scienceâ (Still in changeless infancy!)â With its âCataline's Defiance,â And âThe Banner of the Freeâ: Or, lured from Grandma's attic, A ramshackle ârockerâ there, Adds a skreek of the dramatic To the poet's âOld Arm-Chair.â Or the âSpeech of Loganâ shifts us From the pathos, to the fire; And Tell (with Gessler) lifts us Many noble notches higher.â Till a youngster, far from sunny, With sad eyes of watery blue, Winds up with something âfunny,â Like âCock-a-doodle-do!â Then a dialogueâselected For its realistic worth:â The Cruel Boy detected With a turtle turned to earth Back downward; and, in pleading, The Good Boyâstrangely gay At such a sad proceedingâ Says, âTurn him over, pray!â So the exercises taper Through gradations of delight To the reading of âThe Paper,â Which is entertainingâquite! For it goes ahead and mentions âIf a certain Mr. O. Has serious intentions That he ought to tell her so.â It also âAsks permission To intimate to âJohnâ The dubious condition Of the ground he's standing onâ; And, dropping the suggestion To âmind what he's about,â It stuns him with the question: âDoes his mother know he's out?â And among the contributions To this âAcademic Pressâ Are âVersified Effusionsâ ByââOur lady editressââ Which fact is proudly stated By the Chief of the concern,â âThough the verse communicated Bears the pen-name âFanny Fern.ââ When all has been recited, And the teacher's bell is heard, And visitors, invited, Have dropped a kindly word, A hush of holy feeling Falls down upon us there, As though the day were kneeling, With the twilight for the prayer. Midst the wealth of facts and fancies That our memories may recall, Thus the old school-day romances Are the dearest, after all!â When some sweet thought revises The half-forgotten tune That opened âExcercises,â On âFriday Afternoon.â âJOHNSON'S BOYâ The world is turned ag'in' me, And people says, âThey guess That nothin' else is in me But pure maliciousness!â I git the blame for doin' What other chaps destroy, And I'm a-goin' to ruin Because I'm âJohnson's boy.â That ain't my nameâI'd ruther They'd call me Ike or Patâ But they've forgot the otherâ And so have I, for that! I reckon it's as handy, When Nibsy breaks his toy, Or some one steals his candy, To say 'twas âJohnson's boy!â You can't git any water At the pump, and find the spout So durn chuck-full o' mortar That you have to bore it out; You tackle any scholar In Wisdom's wise employ, And I'll bet you half a dollar He'll say it's âJohnson's boy!â Folks don't know how I suffer In my uncomplainin' wayâ They think I'm gittin' tougher And tougher every day. Last Sunday night, when Flinder Was a-shoutin' out for joy, And some one shook the winder, He prayed for âJohnson's boy.â I'm tired of bein' follered By farmers every day, And then o' bein' collared For coaxin' hounds away; Hounds always plays me doubleâ It's a trick they all enjoyâ To git me into trouble, Because I'm âJohnson's boy.â But if I git to Heaven, I hope the Lord'll see Some boy has been perfect, And lay it on to me; I'll swell the song sonorous, And clap my wings for joy, And sail off on the chorusâ âHurrah for âJohnson's boy!ââ HER BEAUTIFUL HANDS O your handsâthey are strangely fair! Fairâfor the jewels that sparkle there,â Fairâfor the witchery of the spell That ivory keys alone can tell; But when their delicate touches rest Here in my own do I love them best, As I clasp with eager, acquisitive spans My glorious treasure of beautiful hands! Marvelousâwonderfulâbeautiful hands! They can coax roses to bloom in the strands Of your brown tresses; and ribbons will twine, Under mysterious touches of thine, Into such knots as entangle the soul And fetter the heart under such a control As only the strength of my love understandsâ My passionate love for your beautiful hands. As I remember the first fair touch Of those beautiful hands that I love so much, I seem to thrill as I then was thrilled, Kissing the glove that I found unfilledâ When I met your gaze, and the queenly bow, As you said to me, laughingly, âKeep it now!â ... And dazed and alone in a dream I stand, Kissing this ghost of your beautiful hand. When first I loved, in the long ago, And held your hand as I told you soâ Pressed and caressed it and gave it a kiss And said âI could die for a hand like this!â Little I dreamed love's fullness yet Had to ripen when eyes were wet And prayers were vain in their wild demands For one warm touch of your beautiful hands. Beautiful Hands!âO Beautiful Hands! Could you reach out of the alien lands Where you are lingering, and give me, to-night, Only a touchâwere it ever so lightâ My heart were soothed, and my weary brain Would lull itself into rest again; For there is no solace the world commands Like the caress of your beautiful hands. NATURAL PERVERSITIES I am not prone to moralize In scientific doubt On certain facts that Nature tries To puzzle us about,â For I am no philosopher Of wise elucidation, But speak of things as they occur, From simple observation. I notice little thingsâto wit:â I never missed a train Because I didn't run for it; I never knew it rain That my umbrella wasn't lent,â Or, when in my possession, The sun but wore, to all intent, A jocular expression. I never knew a creditor To dun me for a debt But I was âcrampedâ or âbu'stedâ; or I never knew one yet, When I had plenty in my purse, To make the least invasion,â As I, accordingly perverse, Have courted no occasion. Nor do I claim to comprehend What Nature has in view In giving us the very friend To trust we oughtn't to.â But so it is: The trusty gun Disastrously exploded Is always sure to be the one We didn't think was loaded. Our moaning is another's mirth,â And what is worse by half, We say the funniest thing on earth And never raise a laugh: 'Mid friends that love us over well, And sparkling jests and liquor, Our hearts somehow are liable To melt in tears the quicker. We reach the wrong when most we seek The right; in like effect, We stay the strong and not the weakâ Do most when we neglect.â Neglected geniusâtruth be saidâ As wild and quick as tinder, The more you seek to help ahead The more you seem to hinder. I've known the least the greatest, tooâ And, on the selfsame plan, The biggest fool I ever knew Was quite a little man: We find we ought, and then we won'tâ We prove a thing, then doubt it,â Know everything but when we don't Know anything about it. THE SILENT VICTORS May 30, 1878 Dying for victory, cheer on cheer Thundered on his eager ear. âCharles L. Holstein. I Deep, tender, firm and true, the Nation's heart Throbs for her gallant heroes passed away, Who in grim Battle's drama played their part, And slumber here to-day.â Warm hearts that beat their lives out at the shrine Of Freedom, while our country held its breath As brave battalions wheeled themselves in line And marched upon their death: When Freedom's Flag, its natal wounds scarce healed, Was torn from peaceful winds and flung again To shudder in the storm of battle-fieldâ The elements of men,â When every star that glittered was a mark For Treason's ball, and every rippling bar Of red and white was sullied with the dark And purple stain of war: When angry guns, like famished beasts of prey, Were howling o'er their gory feast of lives, And sending dismal echoes far away To mothers, maids, and wives:â The mother, kneeling in the empty night, With pleading hands uplifted for the son Who, even as she prayed, had fought the fightâ The victory had won: The wife, with trembling hand that wrote to say The babe was waiting for the sire's caressâ The letter meeting that upon the way,â The babe was fatherless: The maiden, with her lips, in fancy, pressed Against the brow once dewy with her breath, Now lying numb, unknown, and uncaressed Save by the dews of death. II What meed of tribute can the poet pay The Soldier, but to trail the ivy-vine Of idle rhyme above his grave to-day In epitaph design?â Or wreathe with laurel-words the icy brows That ache no longer with a dream of fame, But, pillowed lowly in the narrow house, Renowned beyond the name. The dewy tear-drops of the night may fall, And tender morning with her shining hand May brush them from the grasses green and tall That undulate the land.â Yet song of Peace nor din of toil and thrift, Nor chanted honors, with the flowers we heap, Can yield us hope the Hero's head to lift Out of its dreamless sleep: The dear old Flag, whose faintest flutter flies A stirring echo through each patriot breast, Can never coax to life the folded eyes That saw its wrongs redressedâ That watched it waver when the fight was hot, And blazed with newer courage to its aid, Regardless of the shower of shell and shot Through which the charge was made;â And when, at last, they saw it plume its wings, Like some proud bird in stormy element, And soar untrammeled on its wanderings, They closed in death, content. III O Mother, you who miss the smiling face Of that dear boy who vanished from your sight, And left you weeping o'er the vacant place He used to fill at night,â Who left you dazed, bewildered, on a day That echoed wild huzzas, and roar of guns That drowned the farewell words you tried to say To incoherent ones;â Be glad and proud you had the life to giveâ Be comforted through all the years to come,â Your country has a longer life to live, Your son a better home. O Widow, weeping o'er the orphaned child, Who only lifts his questioning eyes to send A keener pang to grief unreconciled,â Teach him to comprehend He had a father brave enough to stand Before the fire of Treason's blazing gun, That, dying, he might will the rich old land Of Freedom to his son. And, Maiden, living on through lonely years In fealty to love's enduring ties,â With strong faith gleaming through the tender tears That gather in your eyes, Look up! and own, in gratefulness of prayer, Submission to the will of Heaven's High Host:â I see your Angel-soldier pacing there, Expectant at his post.â I see the rank and file of armies vast, That muster under one supreme control; I hear the trumpet sound the signal-blastâ The calling of the rollâ The grand divisions falling into line And forming, under voice of One alone Who gives command, and joins with tongue divine The hymn that shakes the Throne. IV And thus, in tribute to the forms that rest In their last camping-ground, we strew the bloom And fragrance of the flowers they loved the best, In silence o'er the tomb. With reverent hands we twine the Hero's wreath And clasp it tenderly on stake or stone That stands the sentinel for each beneath Whose glory is our own. While in the violet that greets the sun, We see the azure eye of some lost boy; And in the rose the ruddy cheek of one We kissed in childish joy,â Recalling, haply, when he marched away, He laughed his loudest though his eyes were wet.â The kiss he gave his mother's brow that day Is there and burning yet: And through the storm of grief around her tossed, One ray of saddest comfort she may see,â Four hundred thousand sons like hers were lost To weeping Liberty. But draw aside the drapery of gloom, And let the sunshine chase the clouds away And gild with brighter glory every tomb We decorate to-day: And in the holy silence reigning round, While prayers of perfume bless the atmosphere, Where loyal souls of love and faith are found, Thank God that Peace is here! And let each angry impulse that may start, Be smothered out of every loyal breast; And, rocked within the cradle of the heart, Let every sorrow rest. SCRAPS There's a habit I have nurtured, From the sentimental time When my life was like a story, And my heart a happy rhyme,â Of clipping from the paper, Or magazine, perhaps, The idle songs of dreamers, Which I treasure as my scraps. They hide among my letters, And they find a cozy nest In the bosom of my wrapper, And the pockets of my vest; They clamber in my fingers Till my dreams of wealth relapse In fairer dreams than Fortune's Though I find them only scraps. Sometimes I find, in tatters Like a beggar, form as fair As ever gave to Heaven The treasure of a prayer; And words all dim and faded, And obliterate in part, Grow into fadeless meanings That are printed on the heart. Sometimes a childish jingle Flings an echo, sweet and clear, And thrills me as I listen To the laughs I used to hear; And I catch the gleam of faces, And the glimmer of glad eyes That peep at me expectant O'er the walls of Paradise. O syllables of measure! Though you wheel yourselves in line, And await the further order Of this eager voice of mine; You are powerless to follow O'er the field my fancy maps, So I lead you back to silence Feeling you are only scraps. AUGUST A day of torpor in the sullen heat Of Summer's passion: In the sluggish stream The panting cattle lave their lazy feet, With drowsy eyes, and dream. Long since the winds have died, and in the sky There lives no cloud to hint of Nature's grief; The sun glares ever like an evil eye, And withers flower and leaf. Upon the gleaming harvest-field remote The thresher lies deserted, like some old Dismantled galleon that hangs afloat Upon a sea of gold. The yearning cry of some bewildered bird Above an empty nest, and truant boys Along the river's shady margin heardâ A harmony of noiseâ A melody of wrangling voices blent With liquid laughter, and with rippling calls Of piping lips and thrilling echoes sent To mimic waterfalls. And through the hazy veil the atmosphere Has draped about the gleaming face of Day, The sifted glances of the sun appear In splinterings of spray. The dusty highway, like a cloud of dawn, Trails o'er the hillside, and the passer-by, A tired ghost in misty shroud, toils on His journey to the sky. And down across the valley's drooping sweep, Withdrawn to farthest limit of the glade, The forest stands in silence, drinking deep Its purple wine of shade. The gossamer floats up on phantom wing; The sailor-vision voyages the skies And carries into chaos everything That freights the weary eyes: Till, throbbing on and on, the pulse of heat Increasesâreachesâpasses fever's height, And Day sinks into slumber, cool and sweet, Within the arms of Night. DEAD IN SIGHT OF FAME DiedâEarly morning of September 5, 1876, and in the gleaming dawn of âname and fame,â Hamilton J. Dunbar. Dead! Dead! Dead! We thought him ours alone; And were so proud to see him tread The rounds of fame, and lift his head Where sunlight ever shone; But now our aching eyes are dim, And look through tears in vain for him. Name! Name! Name! It was his diadem; Nor ever tarnish-taint of shame Could dim its lusterâlike a flame Reflected in a gem, He wears it blazing on his brow Within the courts of Heaven now. Tears! Tears! Tears! Like dews upon the leaf That bursts at lastâfrom out the years The blossom of a trust appears That blooms above the grief; And mother, brother, wife and child Will see it and be reconciled. IN THE DARK O in the depths of midnight What fancies haunt the brain! When even the sigh of the sleeper Sounds like a sob of pain. A sense of awe and of wonder I may never well define,â For the thoughts that come in the shadows Never come in the shine. The old clock down in the parlor Like a sleepless mourner grieves, And the seconds drip in the silence As the rain drips from the eaves. And I think of the hands that signal The hours there in the gloom, And wonder what angel watchers Wait in the darkened room. And I think of the smiling faces That used to watch and wait, Till the click of the clock was answered By the click of the opening gate.â They are not there now in the eveningâ Morning or noonânot there; Yet I know that they keep their vigil, And wait for me Somewhere. THE IRON HORSE No song is mine of Arab steedâ My courser is of nobler blood, And cleaner limb and fleeter speed, And greater strength and hardihood Than ever cantered wild and free Across the plains of Araby. Go search the level desert land From Sana on to Samarcandâ Wherever Persian prince has been, Or Dervish, Sheik, or Bedouin, And I defy you there to point Me out a steed the half so fineâ From tip of ear to pastern-jointâ As this old iron horse of mine. You do not know what beauty isâ You do not know what gentleness His answer is to my caress!â Why, look upon this gait of his,â A touch upon his iron reinâ He moves with such a stately grace The sunlight on his burnished mane Is barely shaken in its place; And at a touch he changes pace, And, gliding backward, stops again. And talk of mettleâAh! my friend, Such passion smolders in his breast That when awakened it will send A thrill of rapture wilder than E'er palpitated heart of man When flaming at its mightiest. And there's a fierceness in his ireâ A maddened majesty that leaps Along his veins in blood of fire, Until the path his vision sweeps Spins out behind him like a thread Unraveled from the reel of time, As, wheeling on his course sublime, The earth revolves beneath his tread. Then stretch away, my gallant steed! Thy mission is a noble one: Thou bear'st the father to the son, And sweet relief to bitter need; Thou bear'st the stranger to his friends; Thou bear'st the pilgrim to the shrine, And back again the prayer he sends That God will prosper me and mine,â The star that on thy forehead gleams Has blossomed in our brightest dreams. Then speed thee on thy glorious race! The mother waits thy ringing pace; The father leans an anxious ear The thunder of thy hooves to hear; The lover listens, far away, To catch thy keen exultant neigh; And, where thy breathings roll and rise, The husband strains his eager eyes, And laugh of wife and baby-glee Ring out to greet and welcome thee. Then stretch away! and when at last The master's hand shall gently check Thy mighty speed, and hold thee fast, The world will pat thee on the neck. DEAD LEAVES DAWN As though a gipsy maiden with dim look, Sat crooning by the roadside of the year, So, Autumn, in thy strangeness, thou art here To read dark fortunes for us from the book Of fate; thou flingest in the crinkled brook The trembling maple's gold, and frosty-clear Thy mocking laughter thrills the atmosphere, And drifting on its current calls the rook To other lands. As one who wades, alone, Deep in the dusk, and hears the minor talk Of distant melody, and finds the tone, In some wierd way compelling him to stalk The paths of childhood over,âso I moan, And like a troubled sleeper, groping, walk. DUSK The frightened herds of clouds across the sky Trample the sunshine down, and chase the day Into the dusky forest-lands of gray And somber twilight. Far, and faint, and high The wild goose trails his harrow, with a cry Sad as the wail of some poor castaway Who sees a vessel drifting far astray Of his last hope, and lays him down to die. The children, riotous from school, grow bold And quarrel with the wind, whose angry gust Plucks off the summer hat, and flaps the fold Of many a crimson cloak, and twirls the dust In spiral shapes grotesque, and dims the gold Of gleaming tresses with the blur of rust. NIGHT Funereal Darkness, drear and desolate, Muffles the world. The moaning of the wind Is piteous with sobs of saddest kind; And laughter is a phantom at the gate Of memory. The long-neglected grate Within sprouts into flame and lights the mind With hopes and wishes long ago refined To ashes,âlong departed friends await Our words of welcome: and our lips are dumb And powerless to greet the ones that press Old kisses there. The baby beats its drum, And fancy marches to the dear caress Of mother-arms, and all the gleeful hum Of home intrudes upon our loneliness. OVER THE EYES OF GLADNESS The voice of One hath spoken, And the bended reed is bruisedâ The golden bowl is broken, And the silver cord is loosed. Over the eyes of gladness The lids of sorrow fall, And the light of mirth is darkened Under the funeral pall. The hearts that throbbed with rapture In dreams of the future years, Are wakened from their slumbers, And their visions drowned in tears. Two buds on the bough in the morningâ Twin buds in the smiling sun, But the frost of death has fallen And blighted the bloom of one. One leaf of life still folded Has fallen from the stem, Leaving the symbol teaching There still are two of them,â For thoughâthrough Time's gradations, The living bud may burst,â The withered one is gathered, And blooms in Heaven first. ONLY A DREAM Only a dream! Her head is bent Over the keys of the instrument, While her trembling fingers go astray In the foolish tune she tries to play. He smiles in his heart, though his deep, sad eyes Never change to a glad surprise As he finds the answer he seeks confessed In glowing features, and heaving breast. Only a dream! Though the fÃªte is grand, And a hundred hearts at her command, She takes no part, for her soul is sick Of the Coquette's art and the Serpent's trick,â She someway feels she would like to fling Her sins away as a robe, and spring Up like a lily pure and white, And bloom alone for him to-night. Only a dream That the fancy weaves. The lids unfold like the rose's leaves, And the upraised eyes are moist and mild As the prayerful eyes of a drowsy child. Does she remember the spell they once Wrought in the past a few short months? Haply notâyet her lover's eyes Never change to the glad surprise. Only a dream! He winds her form Close in the coil of his curving arm, And whirls her away in a gust of sound As wild and sweet as the poets found In the paradise where the silken tent Of the Persian blooms in the Orient,â While ever the chords of the music seem Whispering sadly,ââOnly a dream!â OUR LITTLE GIRL Her heart knew naught of sorrow, Nor the vaguest taint of sinâ 'Twas an ever-blooming blossom Of the purity within: And her hands knew only touches Of the mother's gentle care, And the kisses and caresses Through the interludes of prayer. Her baby-feet had journeyed Such a little distance here, They could have found no briers In the path to interfere; The little cross she carried Could not weary her, we know, For it lay as lightly on her As a shadow on the snow. And yet the way before usâ O how empty now and drear!â How ev'n the dews of roses Seem as dripping tears for her! And the song-birds all seem crying, As the winds cry and the rain, All sobbingly,ââWe wantâwe want Our little girl again!â THE FUNNY LITTLE FELLOW 'Twas a Funny Little Fellow Of the very purest type, For he had a heart as mellow As an apple over ripe; And the brightest little twinkle When a funny thing occurred, And the lightest little tinkle Of a laugh you ever heard! His smile was like the glitter Of the sun in tropic lands, And his talk a sweeter twitter Than the swallow understands; Hear him singâand tell a storyâ Snap a jokeâignite a pun,â 'Twas a captureâraptureâglory, An explosionâall in one! Though he hadn't any moneyâ That condiment which tends To make a fellow âhoneyâ For the palate of his friends;â Sweet simples he compoundedâ Sovereign antidotes for sin Or taint,âa faith unbounded That his friends were genuine. He wasn't honored, maybeâ For his songs of praise were slim,â Yet I never knew a baby That wouldn't crow for him; I never knew a mother But urged a kindly claim Upon him as a brother, At the mention of his name. The sick have ceased their sighing, And have even found the grace Of a smile when they were dying As they looked upon his face; And I've seen his eyes of laughter Melt in tears that only ran As though, swift-dancing after, Came the Funny Little Man. He laughed away the sorrow And he laughed away the gloom We are all so prone to borrow From the darkness of the tomb; And he laughed across the ocean Of a happy life, and passed, With a laugh of glad emotion, Into Paradise at last. And I think the Angels knew him, And had gathered to await His coming, and run to him Through the widely opened Gate, With their faces gleaming sunny For his laughter-loving sake, And thinking, âWhat a funny Little Angel he will make!â SONG OF THE NEW YEAR I heard the bells at midnight Ring in the dawning year; And above the clanging chorus Of the song, I seemed to hear A choir of mystic voices Flinging echoes, ringing clear, From a band of angels winging Through the haunted atmosphere: âRing out the shame and sorrow, And the misery and sin, That the dawning of the morrow May in peace be ushered in.â And I thought of all the trials The departed years had cost, And the blooming hopes and pleasures That are withered now and lost; And with joy I drank the music Stealing o'er the feeling there As the spirit song came pealing On the silence everywhere: âRing out the shame and sorrow, And the misery and sin, That the dawning of the morrow May in peace be ushered in.â And I listened as a lover To an utterance that flows In syllables like dewdrops From the red lips of a rose, Till the anthem, fainter growing, Climbing higher, chiming on Up the rounds of happy rhyming, Slowly vanished in the dawn: âRing out the shame and sorrow, And the misery and sin, That the dawning of the morrow May in peace be ushered in.â Then I raised my eyes to Heaven, And with trembling lips I pled For a blessing for the living And a pardon for the dead; And like a ghost of music Slowly whisperedâlowly sungâ Came the echo pure and holy In the happy angel tongue: âRing out the shame and sorrow, And the misery and sin, And the dawn of every morrow Will in peace be ushered in.â A LETTER TO A FRIEND The past is like a story I have listened to in dreams That vanished in the glory Of the Morning's early gleams; Andâat my shadow glancingâ I feel a loss of strength, As the Day of Life advancing Leaves it shorn of half its length. But it's all in vain to worry At the rapid race of Timeâ And he flies in such a flurry When I trip him with a rhyme, I'll bother him no longer Than to thank you for the thought That âmy fame is growing stronger As you really think it ought.â And though I fall below it, I might know as much of mirth To live and die a poet Of unacknowledged worth; For Fame is but a vagrantâ Though a loyal one and brave, And his laurels ne'er so fragrant As when scattered o'er the grave. LINES FOR AN ALBUM I would not trace the hackneyed phrase Of shallow words and empty praise, And prate of âpeaceâ till one might think My foolish pen was drunk with ink. Nor will I here the wish express Of âlasting love and happiness,â And âcloudless skiesââfor after all âInto each life some rain must fall.â âNo. Keep the empty page below, In my remembrance, white as snowâ Nor sigh to know the secret prayer My spirit hand has written there. TO ANNIE When the lids of dusk are falling O'er the dreamy eyes of day, And the whippoorwills are calling, And the lesson laid away,â May Mem'ry soft and tender As the prelude of the night, Bend over you and render As tranquil a delight. FAME I Once, in a dream, I saw a man With haggard face and tangled hair, And eyes that nursed as wild a care As gaunt Starvation ever can; And in his hand he held a wand Whose magic touch gave life and thought Unto a form his fancy wrought And robed with coloring so grand, It seemed the reflex of some child Of Heaven, fair and undefiledâ A face of purity and loveâ To woo him into worlds above: And as I gazed with dazzled eyes, A gleaming smile lit up his lips As his bright soul from its eclipse Went flashing into Paradise. Then tardy Fame came through the door And found a pictureânothing more. II And once I saw a man, alone, In abject poverty, with hand Uplifted o'er a block of stone That took a shape at his command And smiled upon him, fair and goodâ A perfect work of womanhood, Save that the eyes might never weep, Nor weary hands be crossed in sleep, Nor hair that fell from crown to wrist, Be brushed away, caressed and kissed. And as in awe I gazed on her, I saw the sculptor's chisel fallâ I saw him sink, without a moan, Sink lifeless at the feet of stone, And lie there like a worshiper. Fame crossed the threshold of the hall, And found a statueâthat was all. III And once I saw a man who drew A gloom about him like a cloak, And wandered aimlessly. The few Who spoke of him at all, but spoke Disparagingly of a mind The Fates had faultily designed: Too indolent for modern timesâ Too fanciful, and full of whimsâ For, talking to himself in rhymes, And scrawling never-heard-of hymns, The idle life to which he clung Was worthless as the songs he sung! I saw him, in my vision, filled With rapture o'er a spray of bloom The wind threw in his lonely room; And of the sweet perfume it spilled He drank to drunkenness, and flung His long hair back, and laughed and sung And clapped his hands as children do At fairy tales they listen to, While from his flying quill there dripped Such music on his manuscript That he who listens to the words May close his eyes and dream the birds Are twittering on every hand A language he can understand. He journeyed on through life, unknown, Without one friend to call his own; He tired. No kindly hand to press The cooling touch of tenderness Upon his burning brow, nor lift To his parched lips God's freest giftâ No sympathetic sob or sigh Of trembling lipsâno sorrowing eye Looked out through tears to see him die. And Fame her greenest laurels brought To crown a head that heeded not. And this is Fame! A thing, indeed, That only comes when least the need: The wisest minds of every age The book of life from page to page Have searched in vain; each lesson conned Will promise it the page beyondâ Until the last, when dusk of night Falls over it, and reason's light Is smothered by that unknown friend Who signs his nom de plume, The End. AN EMPTY NEST I find an old deserted nest, Half-hidden in the underbrush: A withered leaf, in phantom jest, Has nestled in it like a thrush With weary, palpitating breast. I muse as one in sad surprise Who seeks his childhood's home once more, And finds it in a strange disguise Of vacant rooms and naked floor, With sudden tear-drops in his eyes. An empty nest! It used to bear A happy burden, when the breeze Of summer rocked it, and a pair Of merry tattlers told the trees What treasures they had hidden there. But Fancy, flitting through the gleams Of youth's sunshiny atmosphere, Has fallen in the past, and seems, Like this poor leaflet nestled here,â A phantom guest of empty dreams. MY FATHER'S HALLS My father's halls, so rich and rare, Are desolate and bleak and bare; My father's heart and halls are one, Since I, their life and light, am gone. O, valiant knight, with hand of steel And heart of gold, hear my appeal: Release me from the spoiler's charms, And bear me to my father's arms. THE HARP OF THE MINSTREL The harp of the minstrel has never a tone As sad as the song in his bosom to-night, For the magical touch of his fingers alone Can not waken the echoes that breathe it aright; But oh! as the smile of the moon may impart A sorrow to one in an alien clime, Let the light of the melody fall on the heart, And cadence his grief into musical rhyme. The faces have faded, the eyes have grown dim That once were his passionate love and his pride; And alas! all the smiles that once blossomed for him Have fallen away as the flowers have died. The hands that entwined him the laureate's wreath And crowned him with fame in the long, long ago, Like the laurels are withered and folded beneath The grass and the stubbleâthe frost and the snow. Then sigh, if thou wilt, as the whispering strings Strive ever in vain for the utterance clear, And think of the sorrowful spirit that sings, And jewel the song with the gem of a tear. For the harp of the minstrel has never a tone As sad as the song in his bosom to-night, And the magical touch of his fingers alone Can not waken the echoes that breathe it aright. HONEY DRIPPING FROM THE COMB How slight a thing may set one's fancy drifting Upon the dead sea of the Past!âA viewâ Sometimes an odorâor a rooster lifting A far-off âOoh! ooh-ooh!â And suddenly we find ourselves astray In some wood's-pasture of the Long Agoâ Or idly dream again upon a day Of rest we used to know. I bit an apple but a moment sinceâ A wilted apple that the worm had spurned,â Yet hidden in the taste were happy hints Of good old days returned.â And so my heart, like some enraptured lute, Tinkles a tune so tender and complete, God's blessing must be resting on the fruitâ So bitter, yet so sweet! JOHN WALSH A strange lifeâstrangely passed! We may not read the soul When God has folded up the scroll In death at last. We may notâdare not say of one Whose task of life as well was done As he could do it,ââThis is lost, And prayers may never pay the cost.â Who listens to the song That sings within the breast, Should ever hear the good expressed Above the wrong. And he who leans an eager ear To catch the discord, he will hear The echoes of his own weak heart Beat out the most discordant part. Whose tender heart could build Affection's bower above A heart where baby nests of love Were ever filled,â With upward growth may reach and twine About the children, grown divine, That once were his a time so brief His very joy was more than grief. O SorrowââPeace, be still!â God reads the riddle right; And we who grope in constant night But serve His will; And when sometime the doubt is gone, And darkness blossoms into dawn,â âGod keeps the good,â we then will say: â'Tis but the dross He throws away.â ORLIE WILDE A goddess, with a siren's grace,â A sun-haired girl on a craggy place Above a bay where fish-boats lay Drifting about like birds of prey. Wrought was she of a painter's dream,â Wise only as are artists wise, My artist-friend, Rolf Herschkelhiem, With deep sad eyes of oversize, And face of melancholy guise. I pressed him that he tell to me This masterpiece's history. He turnedâreturnedâand thus beguiled Me with the tale of Orlie Wilde:â âWe artists live ideally: We breed our firmest facts of air; We make our own realityâ We dream a thing and it is so. The fairest scenes we ever see Are mirages of memory; The sweetest thoughts we ever know We plagiarize from Long Ago: And as the girl on canvas there Is marvelously rare and fair, 'Tis only inasmuch as she Is dumb and may not speak to me!â He tapped me with his mahlstickâthen The picture,âand went on again: âOrlie Wilde, the fisher's childâ I see her yet, as fair and mild As ever nursling summer day Dreamed on the bosom of the bay: For I was twenty then, and went Alone and long-hairedâall content With promises of sounding name And fantasies of future fame, And thoughts that now my mind discards As editor a fledgling bard's. âAt evening once I chanced to go, With pencil and portfolio, Adown the street of silver sand That winds beneath this craggy land, To make a sketch of some old scurf Of driftage, nosing through the surf A splintered mast, with knarl and strand Of rigging-rope and tattered threads Of flag and streamer and of sail That fluttered idly in the gale Or whipped themselves to sadder shreds. The while I wrought, half listlessly, On my dismantled subject, came A sea-bird, settling on the same With plaintive moan, as though that he Had lost his mate upon the sea; Andâwith my melancholy trendâ It brought dim dreams half understoodâ It wrought upon my morbid mood,â I thought of my own voyagings That had no endâthat have no end.â And, like the sea-bird, I made moan That I was loveless and alone. And when at last with weary wings It went upon its wanderings, With upturned face I watched its flight Until this picture met my sight: A goddess, with a siren's grace,â A sun-haired girl on a craggy place Above a bay where fish-boats lay Drifting about like birds of prey. âIn airy poise she, gazing, stood A matchless form of womanhood, That brought a thought that if for me Such eyes had sought across the sea, I could have swum the widest tide That ever mariner defied, And, at the shore, could on have gone To that high crag she stood upon, To there entreat and say, âMy Sweet, Behold thy servant at thy feet.â And to my soul I said: âAbove, There stands the idol of thy love!â âIn this rapt, awed, ecstatic state I gazedâtill lo! I was aware A fisherman had joined her thereâ A weary man, with halting gait, Who toiled beneath a basket's weight: Her father, as I guessed, for she Had run to meet him gleefully And ta'en his burden to herself, That perched upon her shoulder's shelf So lightly that she, tripping, neared A jutting crag and disappeared; But she left the echo of a song That thrills me yet, and will as long As I have being! ... ... âEvenings came And went,âbut each the sameâthe same: She watched above, and even so I stood there watching from below; Till, grown so bold at last, I sung,â (What matter now the theme thereof!)â It brought an answer from her tongueâ Faint as the murmur of a dove, Yet all the more the song of love. ... âI turned and looked upon the bay, With palm to foreheadâeyes a-blur In the sea's smileâmeant but for her!â I saw the fish-boats far away In misty distance, lightly drawn In chalk-dots on the horizonâ Looked back at her, long, wistfully,â And, pushing off an empty skiff, I beckoned her to quit the cliff And yield me her rare company Upon a little pleasure-cruise.â She stood, as loathful to refuse, To muse for full a moment's time,â Then answered back in pantomime âShe feared some danger from the sea Were she discovered thus with me.â I motioned then to ask her if I might not join her on the cliff; And back again, with graceful wave Of lifted arm, she answer gave âShe feared some danger from the sea.â âImpatient, piqued, impetuous, I Sprang in the boat, and flung âGood-byâ From pouted mouth with angry hand, And madly pulled away from land With lusty stroke, despite that she Held out her hands entreatingly: And when far out, with covert eye I shoreward glanced, I saw her fly In reckless haste adown the crag, Her hair a-flutter like a flag Of gold that danced across the strand In little mists of silver sand. All curious I, pausing, tried To fancy what it all implied,â When suddenly I found my feet Were wet; and, underneath the seat On which I sat, I heard the sound Of gurgling waters, and I found The boat aleak alarmingly. ... I turned and looked upon the sea, Whose every wave seemed mocking me; I saw the fishers' sails once moreâ In dimmer distance than before; I saw the sea-bird wheeling by, With foolish wish that I could fly: I thought of firm earth, home and friendsâ I thought of everything that tends To drive a man to frenzy and To wholly lose his own command; I thought of all my waywardnessâ Thought of a mother's deep distress; Of youthful follies yet unpurgedâ Sins, as the seas, about me surgedâ Thought of the printer's ready pen To-morrow drowning me again;â A million things without a nameâ I thought of everything butâFame. ... âA memory yet is in my mind, So keenly clear and sharp-defined, I picture every phase and line Of life and death, and neither mine,â While some fair seraph, golden-haired, Bends over me,âwith white arms bared, That strongly plait themselves about My drowning weight and lift me outâ With joy too great for words to state Or tongue to dare articulate! âAnd this seraphic ocean-child And heroine was Orlie Wilde: And thus it was I came to hear Her voice's music in my earâ Ay, thus it was Fate paved the way That I walk desolate to-day!â ... The artist paused and bowed his face Within his palms a little space, While reverently on his form I bent my gaze and marked a storm That shook his frame as wrathfully As some typhoon of agony, And fraught with sobsâthe more profound For that peculiar laughing sound We hear when strong men weep. ... I leant With warmest sympathyâI bent To stroke with soothing hand his brow, He murmuringââ'Tis over now!â And shall I tie the silken thread Of my frail romance?â âYes,â I said.â He faintly smiled; and then, with brow In kneading palm, as one in dreadâ His tasseled cap pushed from his head;â ââHer voice's music,â I repeat,â He said,ââ'twas sweetâO passing sweet!â Though she herself, in uttering Its melody, proved not the thing Of loveliness my dreams made meet For meâthere, yearning, at her feetâ Prone at her feetâa worshiper,â For lo! she spake a tongue,â moaned he, âUnknown to me;âunknown to me As mine to herâas mine to her.â THAT OTHER MAUD MULLER Maud MULLER worked at making hay, And cleared her forty cents a day. Her clothes were coarse, but her health was fine, And so she worked in the sweet sunshine Singing as glad as a bird in May âBarbara Allenâ the livelong day. She often glanced at the far-off town, And wondered if eggs were up or down. And the sweet song died of a strange disease, Leaving a phantom taste of cheese, And an appetite and a nameless ache For soda-water and ginger cake. The Judge rode slowly into viewâ Stopped his horse in the shade and threw His fine-cut out, while the blushing Maud Marveled much at the kind he âchawed.â âHe was dry as a fish,â he said with a wink, âAnd kind o' thought that a good square drink Would brace him up.â So the cup was filled With the crystal wine that old spring spilled; And she gave it him with a sun-browned hand. âThanks,â said the Judge in accents bland; âA thousand thanks! for a sweeter draught, From a fairer handââbut there he laughed. And the sweet girl stood in the sun that day, And raked the Judge instead of the hay. A MAN OF MANY PARTS It was a man of many parts, Who in his coffer mind Had stored the Classics and the Arts And Sciences combined; The purest gems of poesy Came flashing from his penâ The wholesome truths of History He gave his fellow men. He knew the stars from âDogâ to Mars; And he could tell you, too, Their distancesâas though the cars Had often checked him throughâ And time 'twould take to reach the sun, Or by the âMilky Way,â Drop in upon the moon, or run The homeward trip, or stay. With Logic at his fingers' ends, Theology in mind, He often entertained his friends Until they died resigned; And with inquiring mind intent Upon Alchemic arts A dynamite experimentâ A man of many parts! THE FROG Who am I but the Frogâthe Frog! My realm is the dark bayou, And my throne is the muddy and moss-grown log That the poison-vine clings toâ And the blacksnakes slide in the slimy tide Where the ghost of the moon looks blue. What am I but a Kingâa King!â For the royal robes I wearâ A scepter, too, and a signet-ring, As vassals and serfs declare: And a voice, god wot, that is equaled not In the wide world anywhere! I can talk to the Nightâthe Night!â Under her big black wing She tells me the tale of the world outright, And the secret of everything; For she knows you all, from the time you crawl, To the doom that death will bring. The Storm swoops down, and he blowsâand blows,â While I drum on his swollen cheek, And croak in his angered eye that glows With the lurid lightning's streak; While the rushes drown in the watery frown That his bursting passions leak. And I can see through the skyâthe skyâ As clear as a piece of glass; And I can tell you the how and why Of the things that come to passâ And whether the dead are there instead, Or under the graveyard grass. To your Sovereign lord all hailâall hail!â To your Prince on his throne so grim! Let the moon swing low, and the high stars trail Their heads in the dust to him; And the wide world sing: Long live the King, And grace to his royal whim! DEAD SELVES How many of my selves are dead? The ghosts of many haunt me: Lo, The baby in the tiny bed With rockers on, is blanketed And sleeping in the long ago; And so I ask, with shaking head, How many of my selves are dead? A little face with drowsy eyes And lisping lips comes mistily From out the faded past, and tries The prayers a mother breathed with sighs Of anxious care in teaching me; But face and form and prayers have fledâ How many of my selves are dead? The little naked feet that slipped In truant paths, and led the way Through dead'ning pasture-lands, and tripped O'er tangled poison-vines, and dipped In streams forbiddenâwhere are they? In vain I listen for their treadâ How many of my selves are dead? The awkward boy the teacher caught Inditing letters filled with love, Who was compelled, for all he fought, To read aloud each tender thought Of âSugar Lumpâ and âTurtle Dove.â I wonder where he hides his headâ How many of my selves are dead? The earnest features of a youth With manly fringe on lip and chin, With eager tongue to tell the truth, To offer love and life, forsooth, So brave was he to woo and win; A prouder man was never wedâ How many of my selves are dead? The great, strong hands so all-inclined To welcome toil, or smooth the care From mother-brows, or quick to find A leisure-scrap of any kind, To toss the baby in the air, Or clap at babbling things it saidâ How many of my selves are dead? The pact of brawn and scheming brainâ Conspiring in the plots of wealth, Still delving, till the lengthened chain, Unwindlassed in the mines of gain, Recoils with dregs of ruined health And pain and poverty insteadâ How many of my selves are dead? The faltering step, the faded hairâ Head, heart and soul, all echoing With maundering fancies that declare That life and love were never there, Nor ever joy in anything, Nor wounded heart that ever bledâ How many of my selves are dead? So many of my selves are dead, That, bending here above the brink Of my last grave, with dizzy head, I find my spirit comforted, For all the idle things I think: It can but be a peaceful bed, Since all my other selves are dead. A DREAM OF LONG AGO Lying listless in the mosses Underneath a tree that tosses Flakes of sunshine, and embosses Its green shadow with the snowâ Drowsy-eyed, I sink in slumber Born of fancies without numberâ Tangled fancies that encumber Me with dreams of long ago. Ripples of the river singing; And the water-lilies swinging Bells of Parian, and ringing Peals of perfume faint and fine, While old forms and fairy faces Leap from out their hiding-places In the past, with glad embraces Fraught with kisses sweet as wine. Willows dip their slender fingers O'er the little fisher's stringers, While he baits his hook and lingers Till the shadows gather dim; And afar off comes a calling Like the sounds of water falling, With the lazy echoes drawling Messages of haste to him. Little naked feet that tinkle Through the stubble-fields, and twinkle Down the winding road, and sprinkle Little mists of dusty rain, While in pasture-lands the cattle Cease their grazing with a rattle Of the bells whose clappers tattle To their masters down the lane. Trees that hold their tempting treasures O'er the orchard's hedge embrasures, Furnish their forbidden pleasures As in Eden lands of old; And the coming of the master Indicates a like disaster To the frightened heart that faster Beats pulsations manifold. Puckered lips whose pipings tingle In staccato notes that mingle Musically with the jingle- Haunted winds that lightly fan Mellow twilights, crimson-tinted By the sun, and picture-printed Like a book that sweetly hinted Of the Nights Arabian. Porticoes with columns plaited And entwined with vines and freighted With a bloom all radiated With the light of moon and star; Where some tender voice is winging In sad flights of song, and singing To the dancing fingers flinging Dripping from the sweet guitar. Would my dreams were never taken From me: that with faith unshaken I might sleep and never waken On a weary world of woe! Links of love would never sever As I dreamed them, never, never! I would glide along forever Through the dreams of long ago. CRAQUEODOOM The Crankadox leaned o'er the edge of the moon And wistfully gazed on the sea Where the Gryxabodill madly whistled a tune To the air of âTi-fol-de-ding-dee.â The quavering shriek of the Fly-up-the-creek Was fitfully wafted afar To the Queen of the Wunks as she powdered her cheek With the pulverized rays of a star. The Gool closed his ear on the voice of the Grig, And his heart it grew heavy as lead As he marked the Baldekin adjusting his wing On the opposite side of his head, And the air it grew chill as the Gryxabodill Raised his dank, dripping fins to the skies, And plead with the Plunk for the use of her bill To pick the tears out of his eyes. The ghost of the Zhack flitted by in a trance, And the Squidjum hid under a tub As he heard the loud hooves of the Hooken advance With a rub-a-dubâdub-a-dubâdub! And the Crankadox cried, as he lay down and died, âMy fate there is none to bewail,â While the Queen of the Wunks drifted over the tide With a long piece of crape to her tail. JUNE O queenly month of indolent repose! I drink thy breath in sips of rare perfume, As in thy downy lap of clover-bloom I nestle like a drowsy child and doze The lazy hours away. The zephyr throws The shifting shuttle of the Summer's loom And weaves a damask-work of gleam and gloom Before thy listless feet. The lily blows A bugle-call of fragrance o'er the glade; And, wheeling into ranks, with plume and spear, Thy harvest-armies gather on parade; While, faint and far away, yet pure and clear, A voice calls out of alien lands of shade:â All hail the Peerless Goddess of the Year! WASH LOWRY'S REMINISCENCE And you're the poet of this concern? I've seed your name in print A dozen times, but I'll be dern I'd 'a' never 'a' took the hint O' the size you areâfer I'd pictured you A kind of a tallish manâ Dark-complected and sallor too, And on the consumpted plan. 'Stid o' that you're little and small, With a milk-and-water faceâ 'Thout no snap in your eyes at all, Er nothin' to suit the case! Kind o' look like aâI don't knowâ One o' these fair-ground chaps That runs a thingamajig to blow, Er a candy-stand perhaps. 'Ll I've allus thought that poetry Was a sort of aâsome diseaseâ Fer I knowed a poet once, and he Was techy and hard to please, And moody-like, and kind o' sad And didn't seem to mix With other folksâlike his health was bad, Er his liver out o' fix. Used to teach fer a livelihoodâ There's folks in Pipe Crick yit Remembers himâand he was good At cipherin' I'll admitâ And posted up in G'ography But when it comes to tact, And gittin' along with the school, you see, He fizzled, and that's a fact! Boarded with us fer fourteen months And in all that time I'll say We never catched him a-sleepin' once Er idle a single day. But shucks! It made him worse and worse A-writin' rhymes and stuff, And the school committee used to furse 'At the school warn't good enough. He warn't as strict as he ought to been, And never was known to whip, Or even to keep a scholard in At work at his penmanship; 'Stid o' that he'd learn 'em notes, And have 'em every day, Spilin' hymns and a-splittin' th'oats With his âDo-sol-fa-me-ra!â Tel finally it was jest agreed We'd have to let him go, And we all felt badâwe did indeed, When we come to tell him so; Fer I remember, he turned so white, And smiled so sad, somehow, I someway felt it wasn't right, And I'm shore it wasn't now! He hadn't no complaints at allâ He bid the school adieu, And all o' the scholards great and small Was mighty sorry too! And when he closed that afternoon They sung some lines that he Had writ a purpose, to some old tune That suited the case, you see. And then he lingered and delayed And wouldn't go awayâ And shet himself in his room and stayed A-writin' from day to day; And kep' a-gittin' stranger still, And thinner all the time, You know, as any feller will On nothin' else but rhyme. He didn't seem adzactly right, Er like he was crossed in love, He'd work away night after night, And walk the floor above; We'd hear him read and talk, and sing So lonesome-like and low, My woman's cried like ever'thingâ 'Way in the night, you know. And when at last he tuck to bed He'd have his ink and pen; âSo's he could coat the museâ he said, âHe'd die contented thenâ; And jest before he past away He read with dyin' gaze The epitaph that stands to-day To show you where he lays. And ever sence then I've allus thought That poetry's some disease, And them like you that's got it ought To watch their q's and p's; And leave the sweets of rhyme, to sup On the wholesome draughts of toil, And git your health recruited up By plowin' in rougher soil. THE ANCIENT PRINTERMAN âO printerman of sallow face, And look of absent guile, Is it the âcopyâ on your âcaseâ That causes you to smile? Or is it some old treasure scrap You cull from Memory's file? âI fain would guess its mysteryâ For often I can trace A fellow dreamer's history Whene'er it haunts the face; Your fancy's running riot In a retrospective race! âAh, Printerman, you're straying Afar from âstickâ and typeâ Your heart has âgone a-maying,â And you taste old kisses, ripe Again on lips that pucker At your old asthmatic pipe! âYou are dreaming of old pleasures That have faded from your view; And the music-burdened measures Of the laughs you listen to Are now but angel-echoesâ O, have I spoken true?â The ancient Printer hinted With a motion full of grace To where the words were printed On a card above his âcase,ââ âI am deaf and dumb!â I left him With a smile upon his face.

Come to see our big sister!â An' Charley he says 'at you kissed her An' he ketched you, th'uther day!â Didn' you, Charley?âBut we p'omised Belle An' crossed our heart to never to tellâ 'Cause she gived us some o' them-er Chawk'lut-drops 'at you bringed to her!

WHEN MOTHER COMBED MY HAIR When Memory, with gentle hand, Has led me to that foreign land Of childhood days, I long to be Again the boy on bended knee, With head a-bow, and drowsy smile Hid in a mother's lap the while, With tender touch and kindly care, She bends above and combs my hair. Ere threats of Time, or ghosts of cares Had paled it to the hue it wears, Its tangled threads of amber light Fell o'er a forehead, fair and white, That only knew the light caress Of loving hands, or sudden press Of kisses that were sifted there The times when mother combed my hair. But its last gleams of gold have slipped Away; and Sorrow's manuscript Is fashioned of the snowy browâ So lined and underscored now That you, to see it, scarce would guess It e'er had felt the fond caress Of loving lips, or known the care Of those dear hands that combed my hair. I am so tired! Let me be A moment at my mother's knee; One momentâthat I may forget The trials waiting for me yet: One moment free from every painâ O! Mother! Comb my hair again! And I will, oh, so humbly bow, For I've a wife that combs it now. A WRANGDILLION Dexery-tethery! down in the dike, Under the ooze and the slime, Nestles the wraith of a reticent Gryke, Blubbering bubbles of rhyme: Though the reeds touch him and tickle his teethâ Though the Graigroll and the Cheest Pluck at the leaves of his laureate-wreath, Nothing affects him the least. He sinks to the dregs in the dead o' the night, And he shuffles the shadows about As he gathers the stars in a nest of delight And sets there and hatches them out: The Zhederrill peers from his watery mine In scorn with the Will-o'-the-wisp, As he twinkles his eyes in a whisper of shine That ends in a luminous lisp. The Morning is born like a baby of gold, And it lies in a spasm of pink, And rallies the Cheest for the horrible cold He has dragged to the willowy brink, The Gryke blots his tears with a scrap of his grief, And growls at the wary Graigroll As he twunkers a tune on a Tiljicum leaf And hums like a telegraph pole. GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION For the sake of guilty conscience, and the heart that ticks the time Of the clockworks of my nature, I desire to say that I'm A weak and sinful creature, as regards my daily walk The last five years and better. It ain't worth while to talkâ I've been too mean to tell it! I've been so hard, you see, And full of pride, andâonryânow there's the word for meâ Just onryâand to show you, I'll give my history With vital points in question, and I think you'll all agree. I was always stiff and stubborn since I could recollect, And had an awful temper, and never would reflect; And always into troubleâI remember once at school The teacher tried to flog me, and I reversed that rule. O I was bad I tell you! And it's a funny move That a fellow wild as I was could ever fall in love; And it's a funny notion that an animal like me, Under a girl's weak fingers was as tame as tame could be! But it's so, and sets me thinking of the easy way she had Of cooling down my temperâthough I'd be fighting mad. âMy Lion Queenâ I called herâwhen a spell of mine occurred She'd come in a den of feelings and quell them with a word. I'll tell you how she loved meâand what her people thought: When I asked to marry Annie they said âthey reckoned notâ That I cut too many didoes and monkey-shines to suit Their idea of a son-in-law, and I could go, to boot!â I tell you that thing riled me! Why, I felt my face turn white, And my teeth shut like a steel trap, and the fingers of my right Hand pained me with their pressureâall the rest's a mystery Till I heard my Annie sayingââI'm going, too, you see.â We were coming through the gateway, and she wavered for a spell When she heard her mother crying and her raving father yell That she wa'n't no child of his'nâlike an actor in a play We saw at Independence, coming through the other day. Well! that's the way we started. And for days and weeks and months And even years we journeyed on, regretting never once Of starting out together upon the path of lifeâ A kind o' sort o' husband, but a mighty loving wife,â And the cutest little babyâlittle GraceâI see her now A-standin' on the pig-pen as her mother milked the cowâ And I can hear her shoutingâas I stood unloading straw,â âI'm ain't as big as papa, but I'm biggerest'n ma.â Now folks that never married don't seem to understand That a little baby's language is the sweetest ever plannedâ Why, I tell you it's pure music, and I'll just go on to say That I sometimes have a notion that the angels talk that way! There's a chapter in this story I'd be happy to destroy; I could burn it up before you with a mighty sight of joy; But I'll go ahead and give itânot in detail, no, my friend, For it takes five years of reading before you find the end. My Annie's folks relentedâat least, in some degree; They sent one time for Annie, but they didn't send for me. The old man wrote the message with a heart as hot and dry As a furnaceââAnnie Mullen, come and see your mother die.â I saw the slur intendedâwhy I fancied I could see The old man shoot the insult like a poison dart at me; And in that heat of passion I swore an inward oath That if Annie pleased her father she could never please us both. I watched herâdark and sullenâas she hurried on her shawl; I watched herâcalm and cruel, though I saw her tear-drops fall; I watched herâcold and heartless, though I heard her moaning, call For mercy from high Heavenâand I smiled throughout it all. Why even when she kissed me, and her tears were on my brow, As she murmured, âGeorge, forgive meâI must go to mother now!â Such hate there was within me that I answered not at all, But calm, and cold and cruel, I smiled throughout it all. But a shadow in the doorway caught my eye, and then the face Full of innocence and sunshine of little baby Grace. And I snatched her up and kissed her, and I softened through and through For a minute when she told me âI must kiss her muvver too.â I remember, at the starting, how I tried to freeze again As I watched them slowly driving down the little crooked laneâ When Annie shouted something that ended in a cry, And how I tried to whistle and it fizzled in a sigh. I remember running after, with a glimmer in my sightâ Pretending I'd discovered that the traces wasn't right; And the last that I remember, as they disappeared from view, Was little Grace a-calling, âI see papa! Howdy-do!â And left alone to ponder, I again took up my hate For the old man who would chuckle that I was desolate; And I mouthed my wrongs in mutters till my pride called up the pain His last insult had given meâuntil I smiled again Till the wild beast in my nature was raging in the denâ With no one now to quell it, and I wrote a letter then Full of hissing things, and heated with so hot a heat of hate That my pen flashed out black lightning at a most terrific rate. I wrote that âshe had wronged me when she went away from meâ Though to see her dying mother 'twas her father's victory, And a woman that could waver when her husband's pride was rent Was no longer worthy of it.â And I shut the house and went. To tell of my long exile would be of little goodâ Though I couldn't half-way tell it, and I wouldn't if I could! I could tell of Californiaâof a wild and vicious life; Of trackless plains, and mountains, and the Indian's scalping-knife. I could tell of gloomy forests howling wild with threats of death; I could tell of fiery deserts that have scorched me with their breath; I could tell of wretched outcasts by the hundreds, great and small, And could claim the nasty honor of the greatest of them all. I could tell of toil and hardship; and of sickness and disease, And hollow-eyed starvation, but I tell you, friend, that these Are trifles in comparison with what a fellow feels With that bloodhound, Remorsefulness, forever at his heels. I rememberâworn and weary of the long, long years of care, When the frost of time was making early harvest of my hairâ I remember, wrecked and hopeless of a rest beneath the sky, My resolve to quit the country, and to seek the East, and die. I remember my long journey, like a dull, oppressive dream, Across the empty prairies till I caught the distant gleam Of a city in the beauty of its broad and shining stream On whose bosom, flocked together, float the mighty swans of steam. I remember drifting with them till I found myself again In the rush and roar and rattle of the engine and the train; And when from my surroundings something spoke of child and wife, It seemed the train was rumbling through a tunnel in my life. Then I remember somethingâlike a sudden burst of lightâ That don't exactly tell it, but I couldn't tell it rightâ A something clinging to me with its arms around my neckâ A little girl, for instanceâor an angel, I expectâ For she kissed me, cried and called me âher dear papa,â and I felt My heart was pure virgin gold, and just about to meltâ And so it didâit melted in a mist of gleaming rain When she took my hand and whispered, âMy mama's on the train.â There's some things I can dwell on, and get off pretty well, But the balance of this story I know I couldn't tell; So I ain't going to try it, for to tell the reason whyâ I'm so chicken-hearted lately I'd be certain 'most to cry. âTIRED OUTâ âTired out!â Yet face and brow Do not look aweary now, And the eyelids lie like two Pure, white rose-leaves washed with dew. Was her life so hard a task?â Strange that we forget to ask What the lips now dumb for aye Could have told us yesterday! âTired out!â A faded scrawl Pinned upon the ragged shawlâ Nothing else to leave a clue Even of a friend or two, Who might come to fold the hands, Or smooth back the dripping strands Of her tresses, or to wet Them anew with fond regret. âTired out!â We can but guess Of her little happinessâ Long ago, in some fair land, When a lover held her hand In the dream that frees us all, Soon or later, from its thrallâ Be it either false or true, We, at last, must tire, too. HARLIE Fold the little waxen hands Lightly. Let your warmest tears Speak regrets, but never fears,â Heaven understands! Let the sad heart, o'er the tomb, Lift again and burst in bloom Fragrant with a prayer as sweet As the lily at your feet. Bend and kiss the folded eyesâ They are only feigning sleep While their truant glances peep Into Paradise. See, the face, though cold and white, Holds a hint of some delight E'en with Death, whose finger-tips Rest upon the frozen lips. When, within the years to come, Vanished echoes live once moreâ Pattering footsteps on the floor, And the sounds of home,â Let your arms in fancy fold Little Harlie as of oldâ As of old and as he waits At the City's golden gates. SAY SOMETHING TO ME Say something to me! I've waited so longâ Waited and wondered in vain; Only a sentence would fall like a song Over this listening painâ Over a silence that glowers and frowns,â Even my pencil to-night Slips in the dews of my sorrow and wounds Each tender word that I write. Say something to meâif only to tell Me you remember the past; Let the sweet words, like the notes of a bell, Ring out my vigil at last. O it were better, far better than this Doubt and distrust in the breast,â For in the wine of a fanciful kiss I could taste Heaven, andârest. Say something to me! I kneel and I plead, In my wild need, for a word; If my poor heart from this silence were freed, I could soar up like a bird In the glad morning, and twitter and sing, Carol and warble and cry Blithe as the lark as he cruises awing Over the deeps of the sky. LEONAINIE LeonainieâAngels named her; And they took the light Of the laughing stars and framed her In a smile of white; And they made her hair of gloomy Midnight, and her eyes of bloomy Moonshine, and they brought her to me In the solemn night.â In a solemn night of summer, When my heart of gloom Blossomed up to greet the comer Like a rose in bloom; All forebodings that distressed me I forgot as Joy caressed meâ (Lying Joy! that caught and pressed me In the arms of doom!) Only spake the little lisper In the Angel-tongue; Yet I, listening, heard her whisper,â âSongs are only sung Here below that they may grieve youâ Tales but told you to deceive you,â So must Leonainie leave you While her love is young.â Then God smiled and it was morning. Matchless and supreme Heaven's glory seemed adorning Earth with its esteem: Every heart but mine seemed gifted With the voice of prayer, and lifted Where my Leonainie drifted From me like a dream. A TEST OF LOVE âNow who shall say he loves me not.â He wooed her first in an atmosphere Of tender and low-breathed sighs; But the pang of her laugh went cutting clear To the soul of the enterprise; âYou beg so pert for the kiss you seek It reminds me, John,â she said, âOf a poodle pet that jumps to âspeakâ For a crumb or a crust of bread.â And flashing up, with the blush that flushed His face like a tableau-light, Came a bitter threat that his white lips hushed To a chill, hoarse-voiced âGood night!â And again her laugh, like a knell that tolled, And a wide-eyed mock surprise,â âWhy, John,â she said, âyou have taken cold In the chill air of your sighs!â And then he turned, and with teeth tight-clenched, He told her he hated her,â That his love for her from his heart he wrenched Like a corpse from a sepulcher. And then she called him âa ghoul all red With the quintessence of crimesââ âBut I know you love me now,â she said, And kissed him a hundred times. FATHER WILLIAM A NEW VERSION BY LEE O. HARRIS AND JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY âYou are old, Father William, and though one would think All the veins in your body were dry, Yet the end of your nose is red as a pink; I beg your indulgence, but why?â âYou see,â Father William replied, âin my youthâ 'Tis a thing I must ever regretâ It worried me so to keep up with the truth That my nose has a flush on it yet.â âYou are old,â said the youth, âand I grieve to detect A feverish gleam in your eye; Yet I'm willing to give you full time to reflect. Now, pray, can you answer me why?â âAlas,â said the sage, âI was tempted to choose Me a wife in my earlier years, And the grief, when I think that she didn't refuse, Has reddened my eyelids with tears.â âYou are old, Father William,â the young man said, âAnd you never touch wine, you declare, Yet you sleep with your feet at the head of the bed; Now answer me that if you dare.â âIn my youth,â said the sage, âI was told it was true, That the world turned around in the night; I cherished the lesson, my boy, and I knew That at morning my feet would be right.â âYou are old,â said the youth, âand it grieved me to note, As you recently fell through the door, That âfull as a gooseâ had been chalked on your coat; Now answer me that I implore.â âMy boy,â said the sage, âI have answered you fair, While you stuck to the point in dispute, But this is a personal matter, and there Is my answerâthe toe of my boot.â WHAT THE WIND SAID I muse to-day, in a listless way, In the gleam of a summer land; I close my eyes as a lover may At the touch of his sweetheart's hand, And I hear these things in the whisperings Of the zephyrs round me fanned:â I am the Wind, and I rule mankind, And I hold a sovereign reign Over the lands, as God designed, And the waters they contain: Lo! the bound of the wide world round Falleth in my domain! I was born on a stormy morn In a kingdom walled with snow, Whose crystal cities laugh to scorn The proudest the world can show; And the daylight's glare is frozen there In the breath of the blasts that blow. Life to me was a jubilee From the first of my youthful days: Clinking my icy toys with gleeâ Playing my childish plays; Filling my hands with the silver sands To scatter a thousand ways: Chasing the flakes that the Polar shakes From his shaggy coat of white, Or hunting the trace of the track he makes And sweeping it from sight, As he turned to glare from the slippery stair Of the iceberg's farthest height. Till I grew so strong that I strayed ere long From my home of ice and chill; With an eager heart and a merry song I traveled the snows until I heard the thaws in the ice-crag's jaws Crunched with a hungry will; And the angry crash of the waves that dash Themselves on the jaggÃ¨d shore Where the splintered masts of the ice-wrecks flash, And the frightened breakers roar In wild unrest on the ocean's breast For a thousand leagues or more. And the grand old sea invited me With a million beckoning hands, And I spread my wings for a flight as free As ever a sailor plans When his thoughts are wild and his heart beguiled With the dreams of foreign lands. I passed a ship on its homeward trip, With a weary and toil-worn crew; And I kissed their flag with a welcome lip, And so glad a gale I blew That the sailors quaffed their grog and laughed At the work I made them do. I drifted by where sea-groves lie Like brides in the fond caress Of the warm sunshine and the tender skyâ Where the ocean, passionless And tranquil, lies like a child whose eyes Are blurred with drowsiness. I drank the air and the perfume there, And bathed in a fountain's spray; And I smoothed the wings and the plumage rare Of a bird for his roundelay, And fluttered a rag from a signal-crag For a wretched castaway. With a sea-gull resting on my breast, I launched on a madder flight: And I lashed the waves to a wild unrest, And howled with a fierce delight Till the daylight slept; and I wailed and wept Like a fretful babe all night. For I heard the boom of a gun strike doom; And the gleam of a blood-red star Glared at me through the mirk and gloom From the lighthouse tower afar; And I held my breath at the shriek of death That came from the harbor bar. For I am the Wind, and I rule mankind, And I hold a sovereign reign Over the lands, as God designed, And the waters they contain: Lo! the bound of the wide world round Falleth in my domain! I journeyed on, when the night was gone, O'er a coast of oak and pine; And I followed a path that a stream had drawn Through a land of vale and vine, And here and there was a village fair In a nest of shade and shine. I passed o'er lakes where the sunshine shakes And shivers his golden lance On the glittering shield of the wave that breaks Where the fish-boats dip and dance, And the trader sails where the mist unveils The glory of old romance. I joyed to stand where the jeweled hand Of the maiden-morning lies On the tawny brow of the mountain-land. Where the eagle shrieks and cries, And holds his throne to himself alone From the light of human eyes. Adown deep glades where the forest shades Are dim as the dusk of dayâ Where only the foot of the wild beast wades, Or the Indian dares to stray, As the blacksnakes glide through the reeds and hide In the swamp-depths grim and gray. And I turned and fled from the place of dread To the far-off haunts of men. âIn the city's heart is rest,â I said,â But I found it not, and when I saw but care and vice reign there I was filled with wrath again: And I blew a spark in the midnight dark Till it flashed to an angry flame And scarred the sky with a lurid mark As red as the blush of shame: And a hint of hell was the dying yell That up from the ruins came. The bells went wild, and the black smoke piled Its pillars against the night, Till I gathered them, like flocks defiled, And scattered them left and right, While the holocaust's red tresses tossed As a maddened Fury's might. âYe overthrown!â did I jeer and groanâ âHo! who is your master?âsay!â Ye shapes that writhe in the slag and moan Your slow-charred souls awayâ Ye worse than worst of things accurstâ Ye dead leaves of a day!â I am the Wind, and I rule mankind, And I hold a sovereign reign Over the lands, as God designed, And the waters they contain: Lo! the bound of the wide world round Falleth in my domain! I wake, as one from a dream half done, And gaze with a dazzled eye On an autumn leaf like a scrap of sun That the wind goes whirling by, While afar I hear, with a chill of fear, The winter storm-king sigh. MORTON The warm pulse of the nation has grown chill; The muffled heart of Freedom, like a knell, Throbs solemnly for one whose earthly will Wrought every mission well. Whose glowing reason towered above the sea Of dark disaster like a beacon light, And led the Ship of State, unscathed and free, Out of the gulfs of night. When Treason, rabid-mouthed, and fanged with steel, Lay growling o'er the bones of fallen braves, And when beneath the tyrant's iron heel Were ground the hearts of slaves, And War, with all his train of horrors, leapt Across the fortress-walls of Liberty With havoc e'en the marble goddess wept With tears of blood to see. Throughout it all his brave and kingly mind Kept loyal vigil o'er the patriot's vow, And yet the flag he lifted to the wind Is drooping o'er him now. And Peaceâall pallid from the battle-field When first again it hovered o'er the land And found his voice above it like a shield, Had nestled in his hand. O throne of State and gilded Senate hallsâ Though thousands throng your aisles and galleriesâ How empty are ye! and what silence falls On your hilarities! And yet, though great the loss to us appears, The consolation sweetens all our painâ Though hushed the voice, through all the coming years Its echoes will remain. AN AUTUMNAL EXTRAVAGANZA With a sweeter voice than birds Dare to twitter in their sleep, Pipe for me a tune of words, Till my dancing fancies leap Into freedom vaster far Than the realms of Reason are! Sing for me with wilder fire Than the lover ever sung, From the time he twanged the lyre When the world was baby-young. O my maiden Autumn, youâ You have filled me through and through With a passion so intense, All of earthly eloquence Fails, and falls, and swoons away In your presence. Like as one Who essays to look the sun Fairly in the face, I say, Though my eyes you dazzle blind Greater dazzled is my mind. So, my Autumn, let me kneel At your feet and worship you! Be my sweetheart; let me feel Your caress; and tell me too Why your smiles bewilder meâ Glancing into laughter, then Trancing into calm again, Till your meaning drowning lies In the dim depths of your eyes. Let me see the things you see Down the depths of mystery! Blow aside the hazy veil From the daylight of your face With the fragrance-ladened gale Of your spicy breath and chase Every dimple to its place. Lift your gipsy finger-tips To the roses of your lips, And fling down to me a budâ But an unblown kissâbut oneâ It shall blossom in my blood, Even after life is doneâ When I dare to touch the brow Your rare hair is veiling nowâ When the rich, red-golden strands Of the treasure in my hands Shall be all of worldly worth Heaven lifted from the earth, Like a banner to have set On its highest minaret. THE ROSE It tossed its head at the wooing breeze; And the sun, like a bashful swain, Beamed on it through the waving trees With a passion all in vain,â For my rose laughed in a crimson glee, And hid in the leaves in wait for me. The honey-bee came there to sing His love through the languid hours, And vaunt of his hives, as a proud old king Might boast of his palace-towers: But my rose bowed in a mockery, And hid in the leaves in wait for me. The humming-bird, like a courtier gay, Dipped down with a dalliant song, And twanged his wings through the roundelay Of love the whole day long: Yet my rose turned from his minstrelsy And hid in the leaves in wait for me. The firefly came in the twilight dim My red, red rose to wooâ Till quenched was the flame of love in him, And the light of his lantern too, As my rose wept with dewdrops three And hid in the leaves in wait for me. And I said: I will cull my own sweet roseâ Some day I will claim as mine The priceless worth of the flower that knows No change, but a bloom divineâ The bloom of a fadeless constancy That hides in the leaves in wait for me! But time passed by in a strange disguise, And I marked it not, but lay In a lazy dream, with drowsy eyes, Till the summer slipped away, And a chill wind sang in a minor key: âWhere is the rose that waits for thee?â I dream to-day, o'er a purple stain Of bloom on a withered stalk, Pelted down by the autumn rain In the dust of the garden-walk, That an Angel-rose in the world to be Will hide in the leaves in wait for me. THE MERMAN I Who would be A merman gay, Singing alone, Sitting alone, With a mermaid's knee, For instanceâheyâ For a throne? II I would be a merman gay; I would sit and sing the whole day long; I would fill my lungs with the strongest brine, And squirt it up in a spray of song, And soak my head in my liquid voice; I'd curl my tail in curves divine, And let each curve in a kink rejoice. I'd tackle the mermaids under the sea, And yank 'em around till they yanked me, Sportively, sportively; And then we would wiggle away, away, To the pea-green groves on the coast of day, Chasing each other sportively. III There would be neither moon nor star; But the waves would twang like a wet guitarâ Low thunder and thrum in the darkness grumâ Neither moon nor star; We would shriek aloud in the dismal dalesâ Shriek at each other and squawk and squeal, âAll night!â rakishly, rakishly; They would pelt me with oysters and wiggletails, Laughing and clapping their hands at me, âAll night!â prankishly, prankishly; But I would toss them back in mine, Lobsters and turtles of quaint design; Then leaping out in an abrupt way, I'd snatch them bald in my devilish glee, And skip away when they snatched at me, Fiendishly, fiendishly. O, what a jolly life I'd lead, Ah, what a âbang-upâ life indeed! Soft are the mermaids under the seaâ We would live merrily, merrily. THE RAINY MORNING The dawn of the day was dreary, And the lowering clouds o'erhead Wept in a silent sorrow Where the sweet sunshine lay dead; And a wind came out of the eastward Like an endless sigh of pain, And the leaves fell down in the pathway And writhed in the falling rain. I had tried in a brave endeavor To chord my harp with the sun, But the strings would slacken ever, And the task was a weary one: And so, like a child impatient And sick of a discontent, I bowed in a shower of tear-drops And mourned with the instrument. And lo! as I bowed, the splendor Of the sun bent over me, With a touch as warm and tender As a father's hand might be: And, even as I felt its presence, My clouded soul grew bright, And the tears, like the rain of morning, Melted in mists of light. WE ARE NOT ALWAYS GLAD WHEN WE SMILE We are not always glad when we smile: Though we wear a fair face and are gay, And the world we deceive May not ever believe We could laugh in a happier way.â Yet, down in the deeps of the soul, Ofttimes, with our faces aglow, There's an ache and a moan That we know of alone, And as only the hopeless may know. We are not always glad when we smile,â For the heart, in a tempest of pain, May live in the guise Of a smile in the eyes As a rainbow may live in the rain; And the stormiest night of our woe May hang out a radiant star Whose light in the sky Of despair is a lie As black as the thunder-clouds are. We are not always glad when we smile!â But the conscience is quick to record, All the sorrow and sin We are hiding within Is plain in the sight of the Lord: And ever, O ever, till pride And evasion shall cease to defile The sacred recess Of the soul, we confess We are not always glad when we smile. A SUMMER SUNRISE AFTER LEE O. HARRIS The master-hand whose pencils trace This wondrous landscape of the morn, Is but the sun, whose glowing face Reflects the rapture and the grace Of inspiration Heaven-born. And yet with vision-dazzled eyes, I see the lotus-lands of old, Where odorous breezes fall and rise, And mountains, peering in the skies, Stand ankle-deep in lakes of gold. And, spangled with the shine and shade, I see the rivers raveled out In strands of silver, slowly fade In threads of light along the glade Where truant roses hide and pout. The tamarind on gleaming sands Droops drowsily beneath the heat; And bowed as though aweary, stands The stately palm, with lazy hands That fold their shadows round his feet. And mistily, as through a veil, I catch the glances of a sea Of sapphire, dimpled with a gale Toward Colch's blowing, where the sail Of Jason's Argo beckons me. And gazing on and farther yet, I see the isles enchanted, bright With fretted spire and parapet, And gilded mosque and minaret, That glitter in the crimson light. But as I gaze, the city's walls Are keenly smitten with a gleam Of pallid splendor, that appalls The fancy as the ruin falls In ashen embers of a dream. Yet over all the waking earth The tears of night are brushed away, And eyes are lit with love and mirth, And benisons of richest worth Go up to bless the new-born day. DAS KRIST KINDEL I had fed the fire and stirred it, till the sparkles in delight Snapped their saucy little fingers at the chill December night; And in dressing-gown and slippers, I had tilted back âmy throneââ The old split-bottomed rockerâand was musing all alone. I could hear the hungry Winter prowling round the outer door, And the tread of muffled footsteps on the white piazza floor; But the sounds came to me only as the murmur of a stream That mingled with the current of a lazy-flowing dream. Like a fragrant incense rising, curled the smoke of my cigar, With the lamplight gleaming through it like a mist-enfolded star;â And as I gazed, the vapor like a curtain rolled away, With a sound of bells that tinkled, and the clatter of a sleigh. And in a vision, painted like a picture in the air, I saw the elfish figure of a man with frosty hairâ A quaint old man that chuckled with a laugh as he appeared, And with ruddy cheeks like embers in the ashes of his beard. He poised himself grotesquely, in an attitude of mirth, On a damask-covered hassock that was sitting on the hearth; And at a magic signal of his stubby little thumb, I saw the fireplace changing to a bright proscenium. And looking there, I marveled as I saw a mimic stage Alive with little actors of a very tender age; And some so very tiny that they tottered as they walked, And lisped and purled and gurgled like the brooklets, when they talked. And their faces were like lilies, and their eyes like purest dew, And their tresses like the shadows that the shine is woven through; And they each had little burdens, and a little tale to tell Of fairy lore, and giants, and delights delectable. And they mixed and intermingled, weaving melody with joy, Till the magic circle clustered round a blooming baby-boy; And they threw aside their treasures in an ecstacy of glee, And bent, with dazzled faces and with parted lips, to see. 'Twas a wondrous little fellow, with a dainty double-chin, And chubby cheeks, and dimples for the smiles to blossom in; And he looked as ripe and rosy, on his bed of straw and reeds, As a mellow little pippin that had tumbled in the weeds. And I saw the happy mother, and a group surrounding her That knelt with costly presents of frankincense and myrrh; And I thrilled with awe and wonder, as a murmur on the air Came drifting o'er the hearing in a melody of prayer:â By the splendor in the heavens, and the hush upon the sea, And the majesty of silence reigning over Galilee,â We feel Thy kingly presence, and we humbly bow the knee And lift our hearts and voices in gratefulness to Thee. Thy messenger has spoken, and our doubts have fled and gone As the dark and spectral shadows of the night before the dawn; And, in the kindly shelter of the light around us drawn, We would nestle down forever in the breast we lean upon. You have given us a shepherdâYou have given us a guide, And the light of Heaven grew dimmer when You sent him from Your side,â But he comes to lead Thy children where the gates will open wide To welcome his returning when his works are glorified. By the splendor in the heavens, and the hush upon the sea, And the majesty of silence reigning over Galilee,â We feel Thy kingly presence, and we humbly bow the knee And lift our hearts and voices in gratefulness to Thee. Then the vision, slowly failing, with the words of the refrain, Fell swooning in the moonlight through the frosty window-pane; And I heard the clock proclaiming, like an eager sentinel Who brings the world good tidings,ââIt is Christmasâall is well!â AN OLD YEAR'S ADDRESS âI have twankled the strings of the twinkering rain; I have burnished the meteor's mail; I have bridled the wind When he whinnied and whined With a bunch of stars tied to his tail; But my sky-rocket hopes, hanging over the past, Must fuzzle and fazzle and fizzle at last!â I had waded far out in a drizzling dream, And my fancies had spattered my eyes With a vision of dread, With a number ten head, And a form of diminutive sizeâ That wavered and wagged in a singular way As he wound himself up and proceeded to say,â âI have trimmed all my corns with the blade of the moon; I have picked every tooth with a star: And I thrill to recall That I went through it all Like a tune through a tickled guitar. I have ripped up the rainbow and raveled the ends When the sun and myself were particular friends.â And pausing again, and producing a sponge And wiping the tears from his eyes, He sank in a chair With a technical air That he struggled in vain to disguise,â For a sigh that he breathed, as I over him leant, Was haunted and hot with a peppermint scent. âAlas!â he continued in quavering tones As a pang rippled over his face, âThe life was too fast For the pleasure to last In my very unfortunate case; And I'm goingââhe said as he turned to adjust A fuse in his bosom,ââI'm going toâBUST!â I shrieked and awoke with the sullen che-boom Of a five-pounder filling my ears; And a roseate bloom Of a light in the room I saw through the mist of my tears,â But my guest of the night never saw the display, He had fuzzled and fazzled and fizzled away! A NEW YEAR'S PLAINT In words like seeds, I'll wrap me o'er, Like coarsest clothes against the cold; But that large grief which these enfold Is given in outline and no more. âTennyson. The bells that lift their yawning throats And lolling tongues with wrangling cries Flung up in harsh, discordant notes, As though in anger, at the skies,â Are filled with echoings replete, With purest tinkles of delightâ So I would have a something sweet Ring in the song I sing to-night. As when a blotch of ugly guise On some poor artist's naked floor Becomes a picture in his eyes, And he forgets that he is poor,â So I look out upon the night, That ushers in the dawning year, And in a vacant blur of light I see these fantasies appear. I see a home whose windows gleam Like facets of a mighty gem That some poor king's distorted dream Has fastened in his diadem. And I behold a throng that reels In revelry of dance and mirth, With hearts of love beneath their heels, And in their bosoms hearts of earth. O Luxury, as false and grand As in the mystic tales of old, When genii answered man's command, And built of nothing halls of gold! O Banquet, bright with pallid jets, And tropic blooms, and vases caught In palms of naked statuettes, Ye can not color as ye ought! For, crouching in the storm without, I see the figure of a child, In little ragged roundabout, Who stares with eyes that never smiledâ And he, in fancy can but taste The dainties of the kingly fare, And pick the crumbs that go to waste Where none have learned to kneel in prayer. Go, Pride, and throw your goblet downâ The âmerry greetingâ best appears On loving lips that never drown Its worth but in the wine of tears; Go, close your coffers like your hearts, And shut your hearts against the poor, Go, strut through all your pretty parts But take the âWelcomeâ from your door. LUTHER BENSON AFTER READING HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY Poor victim of that vulture curse That hovers o'er the universe, With ready talons quick to strike In every human heart alike, And cruel beak to stab and tear In virtue's vitals everywhere,â You need no sympathy of mine To aid you, for a strength divine Encircles you, and lifts you clear Above this earthly atmosphere. And yet I can but call you poor, As, looking through the open door Of your sad life, I only see A broad landscape of misery, And catch through mists of pitying tears The ruins of your younger years, I see a father's shielding arm Thrown round you in a wild alarmâ Struck down, and powerless to free Or aid you in your agony. I see a happy home grow dark And desolateâthe latest spark Of hope is passing in eclipseâ The prayer upon a mother's lips Has fallen with her latest breath In ashes on the lips of deathâ I see a penitent who reels, And writhes, and clasps his hands, and kneels, And moans for mercy for the sake Of that fond heart he dared to break. And lo! as when in Galilee A voice above the troubled sea Commanded âPeace; be still!â the flood That rolled in tempest-waves of blood Within you, fell in calm so sweet It ripples round the Saviour's feet; And all your noble nature thrilled With brightest hope and faith, and filled Your thirsty soul with joy and peace And praise to Him who gave release. âDREAMâ Because her eyes were far too deep And holy for a laugh to leap Across the brink where sorrow tried To drown within the amber tide; Because the looks, whose ripples kissed The trembling lids through tender mist, Were dazzled with a radiant gleamâ Because of this I called her âDream.â Because the roses growing wild About her features when she smiled Were ever dewed with tears that fell With tenderness ineffable; Because her lips might spill a kiss That, dripping in a world like this, Would tincture death's myrrh-bitter stream To sweetnessâso I called her âDream.â Because I could not understand The magic touches of a hand That seemed, beneath her strange control, To smooth the plumage of the soul And calm it, till, with folded wings, It half forgot its flutterings, And, nestled in her palm, did seem To trill a song that called her âDream.â Because I saw her, in a sleep As dark and desolate and deep And fleeting as the taunting night That flings a vision of delight To some lorn martyr as he lies In slumber ere the day he diesâ Because she vanished like a gleam Of glory, do I call her âDream.â WHEN EVENING SHADOWS FALL When evening shadows fall, She hangs her cares away Like empty garments on the wall That hides her from the day; And while old memories throng, And vanished voices call, She lifts her grateful heart in song When evening shadows fall. Her weary hands forget The burdens of the day. The weight of sorrow and regret In music rolls away; And from the day's dull tomb, That holds her in its thrall, Her soul springs up in lily bloom When evening shadows fall. O weary heart and hand, Go bravely to the strifeâ No victory is half so grand As that which conquers life! One day shall yet be thineâ The day that waits for all Whose prayerful eyes are things divine When evening shadows fall. YLLADMAR Her hair was, oh, so dense a blur Of darkness, midnight envied her; And stars grew dimmer in the skies To see the glory of her eyes; And all the summer rain of light That showered from the moon at night Fell o'er her features as the gloom Of twilight o'er a lily-bloom. The crimson fruitage of her lips Was ripe and lush with sweeter wine Than burgundy or muscadine Or vintage that the burgher sips In some old garden on the Rhine: And I to taste of it could well Believe my heart a crucible Of molten loveâand I could feel The drunken soul within me reel And rock and stagger till it fell. And do you wonder that I bowed Before her splendor as a cloud Of storm the golden-sandaled sun Had set his conquering foot upon? And did she will it, I could lie In writhing rapture down and die A death so full of precious pain I'd waken up to die again. A FANTASY A fantasy that came to me As wild and wantonly designed As ever any dream might be Unraveled from a madman's mind,â A tangle-work of tissue, wrought By cunning of the spider-brain, And woven, in an hour of pain, To trap the giddy flies of thought. I stood beneath a summer moon All swollen to uncanny girth, And hanging, like the sun at noon, Above the center of the earth; But with a sad and sallow light, As it had sickened of the night And fallen in a pallid swoon. Around me I could hear the rush Of sullen winds, and feel the whir Of unseen wings apast me brush Like phantoms round a sepulcher; And, like a carpeting of plush, A lawn unrolled beneath my feet, Bespangled o'er with flowers as sweet To look upon as those that nod Within the garden-fields of God, But odorless as those that blow In ashes in the shades below. And on my hearing fell a storm Of gusty music, sadder yet Than every whimper of regret That sobbing utterance could form, And patched with scraps of sound that seemed Torn out of tunes that demons dreamed, And pitched to such a piercing key, It stabbed the ear with agony; And when at last it lulled and died, I stood aghast and terrified. I shuddered and I shut my eyes, And still could see, and feel aware Some mystic presence waited there; And staring, with a dazed surprise, I saw a creature so divine That never subtle thought of mine May reproduce to inner sight So fair a vision of delight. A syllable of dew that drips From out a lily's laughing lips Could not be sweeter than the word I listened to, yet never heard.â For, oh, the woman hiding there Within the shadows of her hair, Spake to me in an undertone So delicate, my soul alone But understood it as a moan Of some weak melody of wind A heavenward breeze had left behind. A tracery of trees, grotesque Against the sky, behind her seen, Like shapeless shapes of arabesque Wrought in an Oriental screen; And tall, austere and statuesque She loomed before itâe'en as though The spirit-hand of Angelo Had chiseled her to life complete, With chips of moonshine round her feet. And I grew jealous of the dusk, To see it softly touch her face, As lover-like, with fond embrace, It folded round her like a husk: But when the glitter of her hand, Like wasted glory, beckoned me, My eyes grew blurred and dull and dimâ My vision failedâI could not seeâ I could not stirâI could but stand, Till, quivering in every limb, I flung me prone, as though to swim The tide of grass whose waves of green Went rolling ocean-wide between My helpless shipwrecked heart and her Who claimed me for a worshiper. And writhing thus in my despair, I heard a weird, unearthly sound, That seemed to lift me from the ground And hold me floating in the air. I looked, and lo! I saw her bow Above a harp within her hands; A crown of blossoms bound her brow, And on her harp were twisted strands Of silken starlight, rippling o'er With music never heard before By mortal ears; and, at the strain, I felt my Spirit snap its chain And break away,âand I could see It as it turned and fled from me To greet its mistress, where she smiled To see the phantom dancing wild And wizard-like before the spell Her mystic fingers knew so well. A DREAM I dreamed I was a spider; A big, fat, hungry spider; A lusty, rusty spider With a dozen palsied limbs; With a dozen limbs that dangled Where there wretched flies were tangled And their buzzing wings were strangled In the middle of their hymns. And I mocked them like a demonâ A demoniacal demon Who delights to be a demon For the sake of sin alone; And with fondly false embraces Did I weave my mystic laces Round their horror-stricken faces Till I muffled every groan. And I smiled to see them weeping, For to see an insect weeping, Sadly, sorrowfully weeping, Fattens every spider's mirth; And to note a fly's heart quaking, And with anguish ever aching Till you see it slowly breaking Is the sweetest thing on earth. I experienced a pleasure, Such a highly-flavored pleasure, Such intoxicating pleasure, That I drank of it like wine; And my mortal soul engages That no spider on the pages Of the history of ages Felt a rapture more divine. I careened around and caperedâ Madly, mystically caperedâ For three days and nights I capered Round my web in wild delight; Till with fierce ambition burning, And an inward thirst and yearning I hastened my returning With a fiendish appetite. And I found my victims dying, âHa!â they whispered, âwe are dying!â Faintly whispered, âwe are dying, And our earthly course is run.â And the scene was so impressing That I breathed a special blessing, As I killed them with caressing And devoured them one by one. DREAMER, SAY Dreamer, say, will you dream for me A wild sweet dream of a foreign land, Whose border sips of a foaming sea With lips of coral and silver sand; Where warm winds loll on the shady deeps, Or lave themselves in the tearful mist The great wild wave of the breaker weeps O'er crags of opal and amethyst? Dreamer, say, will you dream a dream Of tropic shades in the lands of shine, Where the lily leans o'er an amber stream That flows like a rill of wasted wine,â Where the palm-trees, lifting their shields of green, Parry the shafts of the Indian sun Whose splintering vengeance falls between The reeds below where the waters run? Dreamer, say, will you dream of love That lives in a land of sweet perfume, Where the stars drip down from the skies above In molten spatters of bud and bloom? Where never the weary eyes are wet, And never a sob in the balmy air, And only the laugh of the paroquet Breaks the sleep of the silence there? BRYANT The harp has fallen from the master's hand; Mute is the music, voiceless are the strings, Save such faint discord as the wild wind flings In sad Ãolian murmurs through the land. The tide of melody, whose billows grand Flowed o'er the world in clearest utterings, Now, in receding current, sobs and sings That song we never wholly understand. O, eyes where glorious prophecies belong, And gracious reverence to humbly bow, And kingly spirit, proud, and pure, and strong; O, pallid minstrel with the laureled brow, And lips so long attuned to sacred song, How sweet must be the Heavenly anthem now! BABYHOOD Heigh-ho! Babyhood! Tell me where you linger! Let's toddle home again, for we have gone astray; Take this eager hand of mine and lead me by the finger Back to the lotus-lands of the far-away! Turn back the leaves of life.âDon't read the story.â Let's find the pictures, and fancy all the rest; We can fill the written pages with a brighter glory Than old Time, the story-teller, at his very best. Turn to the brook where the honeysuckle tipping O'er its vase of perfume spills it on the breeze, And the bee and humming-bird in ecstacy are sipping From the fairy flagons of the blooming locust-trees. Turn to the lane where we used to âteeter-totter,â Printing little foot-palms in the mellow moldâ Laughing at the lazy cattle wading in the water Where the ripples dimple round the buttercups of gold; Where the dusky turtle lies basking on the gravel Of the sunny sand-bar in the middle tide, And the ghostly dragon-fly pauses in his travel To rest like a blossom where the water-lily died. Heigh-ho! Babyhood! Tell me where you linger! Let's toddle home again, for we have gone astray; Take this eager hand of mine and lead me by the finger Back to the lotus-lands of the far-away! LIBERTY NEW CASTLE, JULY 4, 1878 I For a hundred years the pulse of time Has throbbed for Liberty; For a hundred years the grand old clime Columbia has been free; For a hundred years our country's love, The Stars and Stripes, has waved above. Away far out on the gulf of yearsâ Misty and faint and white Through the fogs of wrongâa sail appears, And the Mayflower heaves in sight, And drifts again, with its little flock Of a hundred souls, on Plymouth Rock. Do you see them thereâas long, long sinceâ Through the lens of History; Do you see them there as their chieftain prints In the snow his bended knee, And lifts his voice through the wintry blast In thanks for a peaceful home at last? Though the skies are dark and the coast is bleak, And the storm is wild and fierce, Its frozen flake on the upturned cheek Of the Pilgrim melts in tears, And the dawn that springs from the darkness there Is the morning light of an answered prayer. The morning light of the day of Peace That gladdens the aching eyes, And gives to the soul that sweet release That the present verifies,â Nor a snow so deep, nor a wind so chill To quench the flame of a freeman's will! II Days of toil when the bleeding hand Of the pioneer grew numb, When the untilled tracts of the barren land Where the weary ones had come Could offer nought from a fruitful soil To stay the strength of the stranger's toil. Days of pain, when the heart beat low, And the empty hours went by Pitiless, with the wail of woe And the moan of Hunger's cryâ When the trembling hands upraised in prayer Had only the strength to hold them there. Days when the voice of hope had fledâ Days when the eyes grown weak Were folded to, and the tears they shed Were frost on a frozen cheekâ When the storm bent down from the skies and gave A shroud of snow for the Pilgrim's grave. Days at last when the smiling sun Glanced down from a summer sky, And a music rang where the rivers run, And the waves went laughing by; And the rose peeped over the mossy bank While the wild deer stood in the stream and drank. And the birds sang out so loud and good, In a symphony so clear And pure and sweet that the woodman stood With his ax upraised to hear, And to shape the words of the tongue unknown Into a language all his own:â 1 Sing! every bird, to-day Sing for the sky so clear, And the gracious breath of the atmosphere Shall waft our cares away. Sing! sing! for the sunshine free; Sing through the land from sea to sea; Lift each voice in the highest key And sing for Liberty! 2 Sing for the arms that fling Their fetters in the dust And lift their hands in higher trust Unto the one Great King; Sing for the patriot heart and hand; Sing for the country they have planned; Sing that the world may understand This is Freedom's land! 3 Sing in the tones of prayer, Sing till the soaring soul Shall float above the world's control In Freedom everywhere! Sing for the good that is to be, Sing for the eyes that are to see The land where man at last is free, O sing for Liberty! III A holy quiet reigned, save where the hand Of labor sent a murmur through the land, And happy voices in a harmony Taught every lisping breeze a melody. A nest of cabins, where the smoke upcurled A breathing incense to the other world. A land of languor from the sun of noon, That fainted slowly to the pallid moon, Till stars, thick-scattered in the garden-land Of Heaven by the great Jehovah's hand, Had blossomed into light to look upon The dusky warrior with his arrow drawn, As skulking from the covert of the night With serpent cunning and a fiend's delight, With murderous spirit, and a yell of hate The voice of Hell might tremble to translate: When the fond mother's tender lullaby Went quavering in shrieks all suddenly, And baby-lips were dabbled with the stain Of crimson at the bosom of the slain, And peaceful homes and fortunes ruinedâlost In smoldering embers of the holocaust. Yet on and on, through years of gloom and strife, Our country struggled into stronger life; Till colonies, like footprints in the sand, Marked Freedom's pathway winding through the landâ And not the footprints to be swept away Before the storm we hatched in Boston Bay,â But footprints where the path of war begun That led to Bunker Hill and Lexington,â For he who âdared to lead where others dared To followâ found the promise there declared Of Liberty, in blood of Freedom's host Baptized to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost! Oh, there were times when every patriot breast Was riotous with sentiments expressed In tones that swelled in volume till the sound Of lusty war itself was well-nigh drowned. Oh, those were times when happy eyes with tears Brimmed o'er as all the misty doubts and fears Were washed away, and Hope with gracious mien, Reigned from her throne again a sovereign queen. Until at last, upon a day like this When flowers were blushing at the summer's kiss, And when the sky was cloudless as the face Of some sweet infant in its angel grace,â There came a sound of music, thrown afloat Upon the balmy airâa clanging note Reiterated from the brazen throat Of Independence Bell: A sound so sweet, The clamoring throngs of people in the streets Were stilled as at the solemn voice of prayer, And heads were bowed, and lips were moving there That made no soundâuntil the spell had passed, And then, as when all sudden comes the blast Of some tornado, came the cheer on cheer Of every eager voice, while far and near The echoing bells upon the atmosphere Set glorious rumors floating, till the ear Of every listening patriot tingled clear, And thrilled with joy and jubilee to hear. I Stir all your echoes up, O Independence Bell, And pour from your inverted cup The song we love so well. Lift high your happy voice, And swing your iron tongue Till syllables of praise rejoice That never yet were sung. Ring in the gleaming dawn Of FreedomâToll the knell Of Tyranny, and then ring on, O Independence Bell.â Ring on, and drown the moan Above the patriot slain, Till sorrow's voice shall catch the tone And join the glad refrain. Ring out the wounds of wrong And rankle in the breast; Your music like a slumber-song Will lull revenge to rest. Ring out from Occident To Orient, and peal From continent to continent The mighty joy you feel. Ring! Independence Bell! Ring on till worlds to be Shall listen to the tale you tell Of love and Liberty! IV O Libertyâthe dearest word A bleeding country ever heard,â We lay our hopes upon thy shrine And offer up our lives for thine. You gave us many happy years Of peace and plenty ere the tears A mourning country wept were dried Above the graves of those who died Upon thy threshold. And again When newer wars were bred, and men Went marching in the cannon's breath And died for thee and loved the death, While, high above them, gleaming bright, The dear old flag remained in sight, And lighted up their dying eyes With smiles that brightened paradise. O Liberty, it is thy power To gladden us in every hour Of gloom, and lead us by thy hand As little children through a land Of bud and blossom; while the days Are filled with sunshine, and thy praise Is warbled in the roundelays Of joyous birds, and in the song Of waters, murmuring along The paths of peace, whose flowery fringe Has roses finding deeper tinge Of crimson, looking on themselves Reflectedâleaning from the shelves Of cliff and crag and mossy mound Of emerald splendor shadow-drowned.â We hail thy presence, as you come With bugle blast and rolling drum, And booming guns and shouts of glee Commingled in a symphony That thrills the worlds that throng to see The glory of thy pageantry. And with thy praise, we breathe a prayer That God who leaves you in our care May favor us from this day on With thy dear presenceâtill the dawn Of Heaven, breaking on thy face, Lights up thy first abiding place. TOM VAN ARDEN Tom Van Arden, my old friend, Our warm fellowship is one Far too old to comprehend Where its bond was first begun: Mirage-like before my gaze Gleams a land of other days, Where two truant boys, astray, Dream their lazy lives away. There's a vision, in the guise Of Midsummer, where the Past Like a weary beggar lies In the shadow Time has cast; And as blends the bloom of trees With the drowsy hum of bees, Fragrant thoughts and murmurs blend, Tom Van Arden, my old friend. Tom Van Arden, my old friend, All the pleasures we have known Thrill me now as I extend This old hand and grasp your ownâ Feeling, in the rude caress, All affection's tenderness; Feeling, though the touch be rough, Our old souls are soft enough. So we'll make a mellow hour: Fill your pipe, and taste the wineâ Warp your face, if it be sour, I can spare a smile from mine; If it sharpen up your wit, Let me feel the edge of itâ I have eager ears to lend, Tom Van Arden, my old friend. Tom Van Arden, my old friend, Are we âlucky dogs,â indeed? Are we all that we pretend In the jolly life we lead?â Bachelors, we must confess, Boast of âsingle blessednessâ To the world, but not aloneâ Man's best sorrow is his own! And the saddest truth is this,â Life to us has never proved What we tasted in the kiss Of the women we have loved: Vainly we congratulate Our escape from such a fate As their lying lips could send, Tom Van Arden, my old friend! Tom Van Arden, my old friend, Hearts, like fruit upon the stem, Ripen sweetest, I contend, As the frost falls over them: Your regard for me to-day Makes November taste of May, And through every vein of rhyme Pours the blood of summer-time. When our souls are cramped with youth Happiness seems far away In the future, while, in truth. We look back on it to-day Through our tears, nor dare to boast,â âBetter to have loved and lost!â Broken hearts are hard to mend, Tom Van Arden, my old friend. Tom Van Arden, my old friend, I grow prosy, and you tire; Fill the glasses while I bend To prod up the failing fire. ... You are restless:âI presume There's a dampness in the room.â Much of warmth our nature begs, With rheumatics in our legs! ... Humph! the legs we used to fling Limber-jointed in the dance, When we heard the fiddle ring Up the curtain of Romance, And in crowded public halls Played with hearts like jugglers' balls.â Feats of mountebanks, depend!â Tom Van Arden, my old friend. Tom Van Arden, my old friend, Pardon, then, this theme of mine: While the firelight leaps to lend Higher color to the wine,â I propose a health to those Who have homes, and home's repose, Wife- and child-love without end! ...

      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME II T. C. PHILIPS O noble heart, and brave impetuous hand! So all engrossed in work of public weal Thou couldst not pause thy own distress to feel While maladies of Wrong oppressed the land. The hopes that marshaled at thy pen's command To cheer the Right, had not the power to heal The ever-aching wounds thou didst conceal Beneath a front so stoically bland That no one guessed thy inward agony,â Until the Master, leaning from his throne, Heard some soul wailing in an undertone, And bending lower down, discovered thee, And clasped thy weary hand within His own And lifted thee to rest eternally. A DREAM UNFINISHED Only a dream unfinished; only a form at rest With weary hands clasped lightly over a peaceful breast. And the lonesome light of summer through the open doorway falls, But it wakes no laugh in the parlorâno voice in the vacant halls. It throws no spell of music over the slumbrous air; It meets no step on the carpetâno form in the easy chair. It finds no queenly presence blessing the solitude With the gracious benediction of royal womanhood. It finds no willowy figure tilting the cage that swings With the little pale canary that forgets the song he sings. No face at the open window to welcome the fragrant breeze; No touch at the old piano to waken the sleeping keys. The idle book lies open, and the folded leaf is pressed Over the half-told story while death relates the rest. Only a dream unfinished; only a form at rest, With weary hands clasped lightly over a peaceful breast. The light steals into the corner where the darkest shadows are, And sweeps with its golden fingers the strings of the mute guitar. And over the drooping mosses it clambers the rustic stand, And over the ivy's tresses it trails a trembling hand. But it brings no smile from the darknessâit calls no face from the gloomâ No song flows out of the silence that aches in the empty room. And we look in vain for the dawning in the depths of our despair, Where the weary voice goes wailing through the empty aisles of prayer. And the hands reach out through the darkness for the touches we have known When the icy palms lay warmly in the pressure of our own: When the folded eyes were gleaming with a glory God designed To light a way to Heaven by the smiles they left behind. Only a dream unfinished; only a form at rest With weary hands clasped lightly over a peaceful breast. A CHILD'S HOMEâLONG AGO READ AT AN OLD SETTLERS' MEETING AT OAKLAND, INDIANA, AUGUST 3, 1878. The terse old maxim of the poet's pen, âWhat constitutes a state? High-minded men,â Holds such a wealth of truth, when one reflects, It seems more like a sermon than a text. Yet looking dimly backward o'er the years Where first the face of progress, through our tears, Smiles on us, where within the forest gloom The bud of Indiana bursts in bloom; We can but see, from Lake of Michigan, To where Ohio rolls, the work of manâ From where our eastern boundary-line is pressed, To where the Wabash revels on the west; A broad expanse of fair and fertile land, Like some rich landscape, from a master's hand, That in its rustic frame, we well might call The fairest picture on Columbia's wallâ A picture nowâa masterpiece divine, That, ere the artist's hand in its design Had traced this loveliness, was but a blot Of ugly pigment on a barren spotâ A blur of color on a hueless ground Where scarce a hint of beauty could be found. But patiently the hand of labor wrought, And from each touch new inspiration caught; Toiled on through disadvantages untold, And at each onward step found firmer hold, And obstacles that threatened long delay He climbed above and went upon his way, Until at last, exulting, he could see The sweet reward of patient industry; And beauties he had hardly dared to dream, In hill and vale, and cliff and winding stream, Spread out before his vision, till the soul Within him seemed to leap beyond control, And hover over lands the genii made Of sifted sunshine and of dew-washed shade. And who, indeed, that loves his native state, Has not a heart to throb and palpitate With ecstacy, as o'er her wintry past, He sees the sun of summer dawn at last, And catches, through the misty shower of light, Dim glimpses of the orchards' bloom of white, And fields beyond where, waving empty sleeves, The âscarecrowâ beckons to the feathered thieves That perch, and perk their nimble heads away, And flit away with harsh, discordant cry, Or shading with his hand, his dazzled eyes, Looks out across the deadened paradise, Where wild flowers blossom, and the ivy clings, And from the ruined oak the grapevine swings, While high above upon the leafless tree The red-head drummer beats his reveille, And, like an army thronging at the sound, The soldier corn-stalks on their battle-ground March on to harvest victories, and flaunt Their banners o'er the battlements of want! And musing thus to-day, the pioneer Whose brawny arm has grubbed a pathway here, Stands, haply; with his vision backward turned To where the log-heap of the past was burned, And sees again, as in some shadowy dream, The wild deer bending o'er the hidden stream, Or sniffing, with his antlers lifted high, The gawky crane, as he comes trailing by, And drops in shallow tides below to wade On tilting legs through dusky depths of shade, While just across the glossy otter slips Like some wet shadow 'neath the ripple's lips As, drifting from the thicket-hid bayou, The wild duck paddles past his rendezvous, And overhead the beech and sycamore, That lean their giant forms from either shore, Clasp hands and bow their heads, as though to bless In whispered prayer the sleeping wilderness. A scene of such magnificent expanse Of nameless grandeur that the utterance Of even feathered orators is faint. For here the dove's most melancholy plaint Invokes no echo, and the killdeer's call Swoons in the murmur of the waterfall That, faint and far away and undefined, Falls like a ghost of sound upon the mind. The voice of nature's very self drops low, As though she whispered of the long ago, When down the wandering stream the rude canoe Of some lone trapper glided into view, And loitered down the watery path that led Through forest depths that only knew the tread Of savage beasts; and wild barbarians That skulked about with blood upon their hands And murder in their hearts. The light of day Might barely pierce the gloominess that lay Like some dark pall across the water's face, And folded all the land in its embrace; The panther's whimper, and the bear's low growlâ The snake's sharp rattle, and the wolf's wild howl; The owl's grim chuckle, as it rose and fell In alternation with the Indian's yell, Made fitting prelude for the gory plays That were enacted in the early days. But fancy, soaring o'er the storm of grief Like that lone bird that brought the olive leaf, Brings only peaceâan amulet whose spell Works stranger marvels than the tongue can tellâ For o'er the vision, like a mirage, falls The old log cabin with its dingy walls, And crippled chimney with its crutch-like prop Beneath a sagging shoulder at the top: The coonskin battened fast on either sideâ The wisps of leaf-tobaccoââcut-and-driedâ; The yellow strands of quartered apples, hung In rich festoons that tangle in among The morning-glory vines that clamber o'er The little clapboard roof above the door: The old well-sweep that drops a courtesy To every thirsting soul so graciously, The stranger, as he drains the dripping gourd, Intuitively murmurs, âThank the Lord!â Again through mists of memory arise The simple scenes of home before the eyes:â The happy mother, humming, with her wheel, The dear old melodies that used to steal So drowsily upon the summer air, The house-dog hid his bone, forgot his care, And nestled at her feet, to dream, perchance, Some cooling dream of winter-time romance: The square of sunshine through the open door That notched its edge across the puncheon floor, And made a golden coverlet whereon The god of slumber had a picture drawn Of Babyhood, in all the loveliness Of dimpled cheek and limb and linsey dress: The bouogh-filled fireplace, and the mantel wide, Its fire-scorched ankles stretched on either side, Where, perched upon its shoulders 'neath the joist, The old clock hiccoughed, harsh and husky-voiced, And snarled the premonition, dire and dread, When it should hammer Time upon the head: Tomatoes, red and yellow, in a row, Preserved not then for diet, but for show,â Like rare and precious jewels in the rough Whose worth was not appraised at half enough: The jars of jelly, with their dusty tops; The bunch of pennyroyal; the cordial drops; The flask of camphor, and the vial of squills, The box of buttons, garden-seeds, and pills; And, ending all the mantel's bric-Ã -brac, The old, time-honored âFamily Almanack.â And Memory, with a mother's touch of love, Climbs with us to the dusky loft above, Where drowsily we trail our fingers in The mealy treasures of the harvest bin; And, feeling with our hands the open track, We pat the bag of barley on the back; And, groping onward through the mellow gloom, We catch the hidden apple's faint perfume, And, mingling with it, fragrant hints of pear And musky melon ripening somewhere. Again we stretch our limbs upon the bed Where first our simple childish prayers were said; And while, without, the gallant cricket trills A challenge to the solemn whippoorwills, And, filing on the chorus with his glee, The katydid whets all the harmony To feather-edge of incoherent song, We drop asleep, and peacefully along The current of our dreams we glide away To the dim harbor of another day, Where brown toil waits for us, and where labor stands To welcome us with rough and horny hands. And who will mock the rude, unpolished ways That swayed us in the good old-fashioned days When labor wore the badge of manhood, set Upon his tawny brow in pearls of sweat? Who dares to-day to turn a scornful eye On labor in his swarthy majesty? Or wreathe about his lips the sneer of pride Where brawny toil stands towering at his side? By industry alone we gauge the worth Of all the richer nations of the earth; And side by side with honesty and toil Prosperity walks round the furrowed soil That belts the world, and o'er the ocean ledge Tilts up the horn of plenty on its edge. 'Tis not the subject fawning to the king, 'Tis not the citizen, low cowering Before the throne of state.â'Twas God's intent Each man should be a kingâa president; And while through human veins the blood of pride Shall ebb and flow in Labor's rolling tide, The brow of toil shall wear the diadem, And justice gleaming there, the central gem, Shall radiate the time when we shall see Each man rewarded as his works shall be. Thank God for this bright promise! Lift the voice Till all the waiting multitudes rejoice; Reach out across the sea and clap your hands Till voices waken out of foreign lands To join the song, while listening Heaven waits To roll an answering anthem through the gates. [For the Song's sake; even so] For the Song's sake; even so: Humor it, and let it go All untamed and wild of wingâ Leave it ever truanting. Be its flight elusive!âLo, For the Song's sakeâeven so.â Yield it but an ear as kind As thou perkest to the wind. Who will name us what the seas Have sung on for centuries? For the Song's sake! Even soâ Sing, O Seas! and Breezes, blow! Sing! or Wave or Wind or Birdâ Sing! nor ever afterward Clear thy meaning to usâNo!â For the Song's sake. Even so.

Spirkland. Time, Moondawn. Interior Court of Krung. A vast, pendant star burns dimly in dome above throne. Crestillomeem discovered languidly reclining at foot of empty throne, an overturned goblet lying near, as though just drained. The Queen, in seeming dazed, ecstatic state, raptly gazing upward, listening. Swarming forms and features in air above, seen eeriely coming and going, blending and intermingling in domed ceiling-spaces of court. Weird music. Mystic, luminous, beautiful faces detached from swarm, float singly forward,âtremulously, and in succession, poising in mid-air and chanting. First Face And who hath known herâlike as I Have known her?âsince the envying sky Filched from her cheeks its morning hue, And from her eyes its glory, too, Of dazzling shine and diamond-dew. Second Face I knew herâlong and long before High Ão loosed her palm and thought: âWhat awful splendor have I wrought To dazzle earth and Heaven, too!â Third Face I knew herâlong ere Night was o'erâ Ere Ão yet conjectured what To fashion Day ofâay, before He sprinkled stars across the floor Of dark, and swept that form of mine, E'en as a fleck of blinded shine, Back to the black where light was not. Fourth Face Ere day was dreamt, I saw her face Lift from some starry hiding-place Where our old moon was kneeling while She lit its features with her smile. Fifth Face I knew her while these islands yet Were nestlingsâere they feathered wing, Or e'en could gape with them or get Apoise the laziest-ambling breeze, Or cheep, chirp out, or anything! When Time crooned rhymes of nurseries Above themânodded, dozed and slept, And knew it not, till, wakening, The morning stars agreed to sing And Heaven's first tender dews were wept. Sixth Face I knew her when the jealous hands Of Angels set her sculptured form Upon a pedestal of storm And let her to this land with strands Of twisted lightnings. Seventh Face And I heard Her voice ere she could tone a word Of any but the Seraph-tongue.â And O sad-sweeter than all sung- Or word-said things!âto hear her say, Between the tears she dashed away:â âLo, launched from the offended sight Of Ão!âanguish infinite Is ours, O Sisterhood of Sin! Yet is thy service mine by right, And, sweet as I may rule it, thus Shall Sin's myrrh-savor taste to usâ Sin's Empressâlet my reign begin!â Chorus of Swarming Faces We follow thee forever on! Through darkest night and dimmest dawn; Through storm and calmâthrough shower and shine, Hear thou our voices answering thine: We followâcraving but to be Thy followers.âWe follow theeâ We follow, follow, follow thee! We follow ever on and onâ O'er hill and hollow, brake and lawn; Through gruesome vale and dread ravine Where light of day is never seen.â We waver not in loyalty,â Unfaltering we follow theeâ We follow, follow, follow thee! We follow ever on and on! The shroud of night around us drawn, Though wet with mists, is wild-ashine With stars to light that path of thine;â The glowworms, too, befriend usâwe Shall fail not as we follow thee. We follow, follow, follow thee! We follow ever on and on.â The notchÃ¨d reeds we pipe upon Are pithed with music, keener blown And blither where thou leadest loneâ Glad pangs of its ecstatic glee Shall reach thee as we follow thee. We follow, follow, follow thee! We follow ever on and on: We know the ways thy feet have gone,â The grass is greener, and the bloom The roses richer in perfumeâ And the birds of every blooming tree Sing sweeter as we follow thee. We follow, follow, follow thee! We follow ever on and on; For wheresoever thou hast gone We hasten joyous, knowing there Is sweeter sin than otherwhereâ Leave still its latest cup, that we May drain it as we follow thee. We follow, follow, follow thee! [Throughout final stanzas, faces in foreground and forms in background slowly vanish, and voices gradually fail to sheer silence.âCrestillomeem rises and wistfully gazes and listens; then, evidently regaining wonted self, looks to be asssured of being wholly aloneâthen speaks.] Crestillomeem The Throne is throwing wide its gilded arms To welcome me. The Throne of Krung! Ha! ha! Leap up, ye lazy echoes, and laugh loud! For I, Crestillomeem, the Queenâha! ha! Do fling my richest mirth into your mouths That ye may fatten ripe with mockery! I marvel what the kingdom would become Were I not here to nurse it like a babe And dandle it above the reach and clutch Of intermeddlers in the royal line And their attendant serfs. Ho! Jucklet, ho! 'Tis time my knarled warp of nice anatomy Were here, to weave us on upon our mesh Of silken villanies. Ho! Jucklet, ho! [Lifts secret door in pave and drops a star-bud through opening. Enter Jucklet from below.] Jucklet Spang sprit! my gracious Queen! but thou hast scorched My left ear to a cinder! and my head Rings like a ding-dong on the coast of death! For, patient hate! thy hasty signal burst Full in my face as hitherward I came! But though my lug be fried to crisp, and my Singed wig stinks like a little sun-stewed Wunk, I stretch my fragrant presence at thy feet And kiss thy sandal with a blistered lip. Cristillomeem Hold! rare-done fool, lest I may bid the cook To bake thee brown! How fares the King by this? Jucklet Safe couched midmost his lordly hoard of books, I left him sleeping like a quinsied babe Next the guest-chamber of a poor man's house: But ere I came away, to rest mine ears, I salved his welded lids, uncorked his nose, And o'er the odorous blossom of his lips Re-squeezed the tinctured sponge, and felt his pulse Come staggering back to regularity. And four hours hence his Highness will awake And Peace will take a nap! Crestillomeem Ha! What mean you? Jucklet [Ominously] I mean that he suspects our knaveries.â Some covert spy is burrowed in the courtâ Nay, and I pray thee startle not aloud, But mute thy very heart in its out-throb, And let the blanching of thy cheeks but be A whispering sort of pallor! Crestillomeem A spy?âHere? Jucklet Ay, hereâand haply even now. And one Whose unseen eye seems ever focused keen Upon our action, and whose hungering ear Eats every crumb of counsel that we drop In these our secret interviews!âFor heâ The Kingâthrough all his talking-sleep to-day Hath jabbered of intrigue, conspiracyâ Of treachery and hate in fellowship, With dire designs upon his royal bulk, To oust it from the Throne. Crestillomeem He spake my name? Jucklet O Queen, he speaks not ever but thy name Makes melody of every sentence.âYea, He thinks thee even true to him as thou Art fickle, false and subtle! O how blind And lame, and deaf and dumb, and worn and weak, And faint, and sick, and all-commodious His dear love is! In sooth, O wifely one, Thy malleable spouse doth mind me of That pliant hero of the bald old catch âThe Lovely Husband.ââShall I wreak the thing? [Singsâwith much affected gravity and grimace] O a lovely husband he was known, He loved his wife and her a-lone; She reaped the harvest he had sown; She ate the meat; he picked the bone. With mixed admirers every size, She smiled on each without disguise; This lovely husband closed his eyes Lest he might take her by surprise. [Aside, exclamatory] Chorious uproarious! [Then pantomime as though pulling at bell-ropeâ singing in pent, explosive utterance] Trot! Run! Wasn't he a handy hubby? What Fun She could plot and plan! Not One Other such a dandy hubby As this lovely man! Crestillomeem Or talk or tune, wilt thou wind up thy tongue Nor let it tangle in a knot of words! What said the King? Jucklet [With recovered reverence] He said: âCrestillomeemâ O that she knew this thick distress of mine!â Her counsel would anoint me and her voice Would flow in limpid wisdom o'er my woes And, like a love-balm, lave my secret grief And lull my sleepless heart!â [Aside] And so went on, Struggling all maudlin in the wrangled web That well-nigh hath cocooned him! Crestillomeem Did he yield No hint of this mysterious distress He needs must hold sequestered from his Queen? What said he in his talking-sleep by which Some clue were gained of how and when and whence His trouble came? Jucklet In one strange phase he spake As though some sprited lady talked with him.â Full courteously he said: âIn woman's guise Thou comest, yet I think thou art, in sooth, But woman in thy form.âThy words are strange And leave me mystified. I feel the truth Of all thou hast declared, and yet so vague And shadow-like thy meaning is to me, I know not how to act to ward the blow Thou sayest is hanging o'er me even now.â And then, with open hands held pleadingly, He asked, âWho is my foe?ââAnd o'er his face A sudden pallor flashed, like death itself, As though, if answer had been given, it Had fallen like a curse. Crestillomeem I'll stake my soul Thrice over in the grinning teeth of doom, 'Tis Dwainie of the Wunks who peeks and peers With those fine eyes of hers in our affairs And carries Krung, in some disguise, these hints Of our intent! See thou that silence falls Forever on her lips, and that the sight She wastes upon our secret action blurs With gray and grisly scum that shall for aye Conceal us from her gaze while she writhes blind And fangless as the fat worms of the grave! Here! take this tuft of downy druze, and when Thou comest on her, fronting full and fair, Say âSherzham!â thrice, and fluff it in her face. Jucklet Thou knowest scanty magic, O my Queen, But all thou dost is fairly excellentâ An this charm work, thou shalt have fuller faith Than still I must withhold. [Takes charm, with extravagant salutation] Crestillomeem Thou gibing knave! Thou thing! Dost dare to name my sorcery As any trifling gift? Behold what might Be thine an thy deserving wavered not In stable and abiding service to Thy Queen! [She presses suddenly her palm upon his eyes, then lifts her softly opening hand upward, his gaze following, where, slowly shaping in the air above them, appears semblanceâor counterself âof Crestillomeem, clothed in most radiant youth, her maiden-face bent downward to a moonlit sward, where kneels a lover-knight âflawless in manly symmetry and princely beauty,âyet none other than the counter-self of Jucklet, eeriely and with strange sweetness singing, to some curiously tinkling instrument, the praises of its queenly mistress: Jucklet and Crestillomeem transfixed belowâtrancedly gazing on their mystic selves above.] Semblance of Jucklet [Sings] Crestillomeem! Crestillomeem! Soul of my slumber!âDream of my dream! Moonlight may fall not as goldenly fair As falls the gold of thine opulent hairâ Nay, nor the starlight as dazzlingly gleam As gleam thine eyes, 'MeemaâCrestillomeem!â Star of the skies, 'Meemaâ Crestillomeem! Semblance of Crestillomeem [Sings] O Prince divine! O Prince divine! Tempt thou me not with that sweet voice of thine! Though my proud brow bear the blaze of a crown, Lo, at thy feet must its glory bow down, That from the dust thou mayest lift me to shine Heaven'd in thy heart's rapture, O Prince divine!â Queen of thy love ever, O Prince divine! Semblance of Jucklet [Sings] Crestillomeem! Crestillomeem! Our life shall flow as a musical streamâ Windinglyâplacidly on it shall wend, Marged with mazhoora-bloom banks without endâ Word-birds shall call thee and dreamily scream, âWhere dost thou cruise, 'MeemaâCrestillomeem? Whither away, 'Meema?â Crestillomeem!â Duo [Vision and voices gradually failing away] Crestillomeem! Crestillomeem! Soul of my slumber!âDream of my dream! Star of Love's light, 'MeemaâCrestillomeem! Crescent of Night, 'Meema!â Crestillomeem! [With song, vision likewise fails utterly] Crestillomeem [To Jucklet, still trancedly staring upward] How now, thou clabber-brainÃ¨d spudge!â Thou squelk!âthouâ Jucklet Nay O Queen! contort me not To more condensÃ¨d littleness than now My shamÃ¨d frame incurreth on itself, Seeing what might fare with it, didst thou will Kindly to nip it with thy magic here And leave it living in that form i' the air, Forever pranking o'er the daisied sward In wake of sandal-prints that dint the dews As lightly as, in thy late maidenhood, Thine own must needs have done in flighting from The dread encroachments of the King. Crestillomeem Nayâpeace! Jucklet So be it, O sweet Mystic.âBut I crave One service of thy magic yet.âAmphine!â Breed me some special, damnÃ¨d philter for Amphineâthe fair Amphine!âto chuck it him, Some serenade-tide, in a sodden slug O' pastry, 'twixt the door-crack and a screech O' rusty hinges.âHey! Amphine, the fair!â And let me, too, elect his doom, O Queen!â Listed against thee, he, too, doubtless hath Been favored with an outline of our scheme.â And I would kick my soul all over hell If I might juggle his fine figure up In such a shape as mine! Crestillomeem Then this:âWhen thou Canst come upon him bent above a flower, Or any blooming thing, and thou, arear, Shalt reach it first and, thwartwise, touch it fair, And with thy knuckle flick him on the knee,â Thenâhis fine form will shrink and shrivel up As warty as a toad'sâso hideous, Thine own shall seem a marvel of rare grace! Though idly speak'st thou of my mystic skill, 'Twas that which won the King for me;â'twas that Bereft him of his daughter ere we had Been wedded yet a haed:âShe strangely went Astray one moonset from the palace-stepsâ She wentânor yet returned.âWas it not strange?â She would be wedded to an alien prince The morrow midnightâto a prince whose sire I once knew, in lost hours of lute and song, When he was but a princeâI but a mouth For him to lift up sippingly and drain To lees most ultimate of stammering sobs And maudlin wanderings of blinded breath. Jucklet [Aside] Twigg-brebblets! but her Majesty hath speech That doth bejuice all metaphor to drip And spray and mist of sweetness! Crestillomeem [Confusedly] Where was I? O, ay!âThe princess wentâshe strangely went!â E'en as I deemed her lover-princeling would As strangely go, were she not soon restored.â As so he did:âThat airy penalty The jocund Fates provide our love-lorn wights In this glad island: So for thrice three nights They spun the prince his line and marked him pay It out (despite all warnings of his doom) In fast and sleepless search for herâand then They tripped his fumbling feet and he fellâUP!â Up!âas 'tis writâsheer past Heaven's flinching walls And topmost cornices.âUpâup and on!â And, it is grimly guessed of those who thus For such a term bemoan an absent love, And so fall upwise, they must needs fall onâ And on and onâand onâand onâand on! Ha! ha! Jucklet Quahh! but the prince's holden breath Must ache his throat by this! But, O my Queen, What of the princess?âandâ Crestillomeem The princess?âAyâ The princess! Ay, she wentâshe strangely went! And when the dainty vagrant came not backâ Both sire and son in apprehensive throes Of royal griefâthe very Throne befogged In sighs and tears!âwhen all hope waned at last, And all the spies of Spirkland, in her quest, Came straggling empty-handed home again,â Why, then the wise King sleeved his rainy eyes And sagely thought the pretty princess had Strayed to the island's edge and tumbled off. I could have set his mind at ease on thatâ I could have told him,âyea, she tumbled offâ I tumbled her!âand tumbled her so plump, She tumbled in an under-island, then Just slow-unmooring from our own and poised For unknown voyagings of flight afar And all remote of latitudes of ours.â Ay, into that land I tumbled her from which But one charm known to art can tumble her Back into this,âand that charm (guilt be praised!) Is lodged not in the wit nor the desire Of my rare lore. Jucklet Thereinasmuch find joy! But dost thou know that rumors flutter now Among thy subjects of thy sorceries?â The art being banned, thou knowest; or, unhoused, Is unleashed pitilessly by the grim, Facetious body of the dridular Upon the one who fain had loosed the curse On others.âAn my counsel be worth aught, Then have a care thy spells do not revert Upon thyself, nor yet mine own poor hulk O' fearsomeness! Crestillomeem Ha! ha! No vaguest need Of apprehension there!âWhile Krung remainsâ [She abruptly pausesâstartled first, then listening curiously and with awed interest. Voice of exquisite melodiousness and fervor heard singing.] Voice When kings are kings, and kings are menâ And the lonesome rain is raining!â O who shall rule from the red throne then, And who shall covet the scepter whenâ When the winds are all complaining? When men are men, and men are kingsâ And the lonesome rain is raining!â O who shall list as the minstrel sings Of the crown's fiat, or the signet-ring's, When the winds are all complaining? Crestillomeem Whence flows such sweetness, and what voice is that? Jucklet The voice of Spraivoll, an mine ears be whet And honÃ©d o' late honeyÃ©d memories Behaunting the deserted purlieus of The court. Crestillomeem And who is Spraivoll, and what song Is that besung so blinding exquisite Of cadenced mystery? Jucklet SpraivollâO Queen,â Spraivoll The Tune-Fool is she fitly named By those who meet her ere the day long wanes And naught but janiteering sparsely frets The cushioned silences and stagnant dusts Indifferently resuscitated by The drowsy varlets in mock servitude Of so refurbishing the royal halls: She cometh, alien, from Wunklandâso Hath she deposed to divers questioners Who have been smitten of her voiceâas rich In melody as she is poor in mind. She hath been roosting, pitied of the hinds And scullions, round about the palace here For half a node. Crestillomeem And pray, where is she perchedâ This wild-bird woman with her wondrous throat? Jucklet Under some dingy cornice, like enoughâ Though wild-bird she is not, being plumÃ¨d in, Not feathers, but one fustianed stoleâthe like Of which so shameth her fair face one needs Must swear some lusty oaths, but that they shape Themselves full gentlewise in mildest prayer:â Not wild-bird;ânay, nor womanâthough, in truth. She ith a licensed idiot, and drifts About, as restless and as useless, too, As any lazy breeze in summer-time. I'll call her forth to greet your Majesty. Ho! Spraivoll! Ho! my twittering birdster, flit Thou hither. [Enter Spraivollâfrom behind group of statuary âsinging] Spraivoll Ting-aling! Ling-ting! Tingle-tee! The moon spins round and round for me! Wind it up with a golden key. Ting-aling! Ling-ting! Tingle-tee! Crestillomeem Who art thou, and what the strange Elusive beauty and intent of thy Sweet song? What singest thou, vague, mystic-birdâ What doth The Tune-Fool sing? Ay, sing me what. Spraivoll [Singing] What sings the breene on the wertling-vine, And the tweck on the banner-stem? Their song, to me, is the same as mine, As mine is the same to themâto themâ As mine is the same to them. In star-starved glooms where the plustre looms With its slender boughs above, Their song sprays down with the fragrant blooms,â And the song they sing is loveâis loveâ And the song they sing is love. Jucklet Your Majesty may be surprised somewhat, But Spraivoll can not talk,âher only mode Of speech is melody; and thou might'st put The dowered fool a thousand queries, and, In like return, receive a thousand songs, All set to differing tunesâas full of naught As space is full of emptiness. Crestillomeem A fool?â And with a gift so all-divine!âA fool? Jucklet Ay, warranted!âThe Flying Islands all Might flock in mighty counselâmolt, and shake Their loosened feathers, and sort every tuft, Nor ever most minutely quarry there One other Spraivoll, itching with her voice Such favored spot of cuticle as she Alone selects here in our blissful realm. Crestillomeem Out, jester, on thy cumbrous wordiness! Come hither, Tune-Fool, and be not afraid, For I like fools so well I married one: And since thou art a Queen of fools, and he A King, why, I've a mind to bring ye two Together in some wise. Canst use thy song All times in such entrancing spirit one Who lists must so needs list, e'en though the song Go on unceasingly indefinite? Spraivoll [Singing] If one should ask me for a song, Then I should answer, and my tongue Would twitter, trill and troll along Until the song were done. Or should one ask me for my tongue, And I should answer with a song, I'd trill it till the song were sung, And troll it all along. Crestillomeem Thou art indeed a fool, and one, I think, To serve my present purposes. Give ear.â And Jucklet, thou, go to the King and bide His waking: then repeat these words:ââThe Queen Impatiently awaits his Majesty, And craves his presence in the Tower of Stars, That she may there express full tenderly Her great solicitude.â And then, end thus,â âSo much she bade, and drooped her glowing face Deep in the showerings of her golden hair, And with a flashing gesture of her arm Turned all the moonlight pallid, saying âHaste!ââ Jucklet And would it not be well to hang a pearl Or twain upon thy silken lashes? Crestillomeem Go! Jucklet [Exit, singing] This lovely husband's loyal breast Heaved only as she might suggest,â To every whimsy she expressed He proudly bowed and acquiesced. He plotted with her, blithe and gayâ In no flirtation said her nay,â He even took her to the play, Excused himself and came away. Crestillomeem [To Spraivoll] Now, Tune-Fool, junior, let me theme thee for A song:âAn Empress once, with angel in Her face and devil in her heart, had wish To breed confusion to her sovereign lord, And work the downfall of his haughty sonâ The issue of a former marriageâwho Bellowsed her hatred to the whitest heat, For that her own son, by a former lord, Was born a hideous dwarf, and reared aside From the sire's knowing or his princely ownâ That none, in sooth, might ever chance to guess The hapless mother of the hapless child. The Fiends that scar her thus, protect her still With outward beauty of both face and form.â It so is written, and so must remain Till magic greater than their own is found To hurl against her. So is she secure And proof above all fear. Now, listen well!â Her present lord is haunted with a dream, That he is soon to pass, and so prepares (All havoc hath been wrangled with the drugs!) The Throne for the ascension of the son, His cursÃ¨d heir, who still doth baffle all Her arts against him, e'en as though he were Protected by a skill beyond her own. Soh! she, the Queen, doth rule the King in all Save this affectionate perversity Of favor for the son whom he would raise To his own place.âAnd but for this the King Long since had tasted death and kissed his fate As one might kiss a bride! But so his Queen Must needs withhold, not deal, the final blow, She yet doth bind him, spelled, still trusting her; And, by her craft and wanton flatteries, Doth sway his love to every purpose but The one most coveted.âAnd for this end She would make use of thee;âand if thou dost Her will, as her good pleasure shall direct, Why, thou shalt sing at court, in silken tire, Thy brow bound with wild diamonds, and thy hair Sown with such gems as laugh hysteric lights From glittering quespar, guenk and plennocynth,â Ay, even panoplied as might the fair Form of a very princess be, thy voice Shall woo the echoes of the listening Throne. Spraivoll [Crooning abstractedly] And O shall oneâhigh brother of the air, In deeps of spaceâshall he have dream as fair?â And shall that dream be this?âIn some strange place Of long-lost lands he finds her waiting faceâ Comes marveling upon it, unaware, Set moonwise in the midnight of her hair, And is behaunted with old nights of May, So his glad lips do purl a roundelay PurloinÃ¨d from the echo-triller's beak, Seen keenly notching at some star's blanch cheek With its ecstatic twitterings, through dusk And sheen of dewy boughs of bloom and musk. For him, Love, light again the eyes of her That show nor tears nor laughter nor surpriseâ For him undim their glamour and the blur Of dreams drawn from the depths of deepest skies. He doth not know if any lily blows As fair of feature, nor of any rose. Crestillomeem [Aside] O this weird woman! she doth drug mine ears With her uncanny sumptuousness of song! [To Spraivoll] Nay, nay! Give o'er thy tuneful maunderings And mark me further, Tune-Foolâay, and well:â At present doth the King lie in a sleep Drug-wrought and deep as deathâthe after-phase Of an unconscious state, in which each act Of his throughout his waking hours is so Rehearsed, in manner, motion, deed and word, Her spies (the Queen's) that watch him, serving there As guardians o'er his royal slumbers, may Inform her of her lord's most secret thought. And lo, her plans have ripened even now Till, should he come upon this Throne to-night, Where eagerly his counselors will bide His coming,âshe, the Queen, hath reason to Suspect her long-designÃ¨d purposes May fall in jeopardy;âbut if he fail, Through any means, to lend his presence there,â Then, by a wheedled mandate, is his Queen Empowered with all Sovereignty to reign And work the royal purposes instead. Therefore, the Queen hath set an interviewâ A conference to be holden with the King, Which is ordained to fall on noon to-night, Twelve star-twirls ere the nick the Throne convenes.â And with her thou shalt go, and bide in wait Until she signal thee to sing; and then Shalt thou so work upon his mellow mood With that un-Spirkly magic of thy voiceâ So all bedaze his waking thought with dreams,â The Queen may, all unnoticed, slip away, And leave thee singing to a throneless King. Spraivoll [Singing] And who shall sing for the haughty son While the good King droops his head?â And will he dream, when the song is done, That a princess fair lies dead? Crestillomeem The haughty son hath found his âSongââsweet curse!â And may she sing his everlasting dirge! She comes from that near-floating land of thine, Naming herself a princess of that realm So strangely peopled we would fain evade All mergence, and remain as strange to them As they to us. No less this Dwainie hath Most sinuously writhed and lithed her way Into court favor hereâhath glidden past The King's encharmÃ¨d sight and sleeked herself Within the very altars of his houseâ His lineâhis bloodâhis very life:âAMPHINE! Not any Spirkland gentlemaiden might Aspire so high as she hath dared to dare!â For she, with her fair skin and finer ways, And beauty second only to the Queen's, Hath caught the Prince betwixt her mellow palms And stroked him flutterless. Didst ever thou In thy land hear of Dwainie of the Wunks? Spraivoll [Singing] Ay, Dwainie!âMy Dwainie! The lurloo ever sings, A tremor in his flossy crest And in his glossy wings. And Dwainie!âMy Dwainie! The winno-welvers call;â But Dwainie hides in Spirkland And answers not at all. The teeper twitters Dwainie!â The tcheucker on his spray Teeters up and down the wind And will not fly away: And Dwainie!âMy Dwainie! The drowsy oovers drawl;â But Dwainie hides in Spirkland And answers not at all. O Dwainie!âMy Dwainie! The breezes hold their breathâ The stars are pale as blossoms, And the night as still as death: And Dwainie!âMy Dwainie! The fainting echoes fall;â But Dwainie hides in Spirkland And answers not at all. Crestillomeem A melody ecstatic! andâthy words, Although so meaningless, seem something moreâ A vague and shadowy something, eerie-like, That maketh one to shiver over-chilled With curious, creeping sweetnesses of pain And catching breaths that flutter tremulous With sighs that dry the throat out icily.â But save thy music! Come! that I may make Thee ready for thy royal auditor. [Exeunt] End Act I ACT II Scene I. A garden of Krung's Palace, screened from the moon with netted glenk-vines and blooming zhoomer-boughs, all glimmeringly lighted with star-flakes. An arbor, near which is a table spread with a repastâtwo seats, drawn either side. A playing fountain, at marge of which Amphine sits thrumming a trentoraine. Amphine [Improvising] Ah, help me! but her face and brow Are lovelier than lilies are Beneath the light of moon and star That smile as they are smiling nowâ White lilies in a pallid swoon Of sweetest white beneath the moonâ White lilies in a flood of bright Pure lucidness of liquid light Cascading down some plenilune When all the azure overhead Blooms like a dazzling daisy-bed.â So luminous her face and brow, The luster of their glory, shed In memory, even, blinds me now. [Plaintively addressing instrument] O warbling strand of silver, where, O where Hast thou unraveled that sweet voice of thine And left its silken murmurs quavering In limp thrills of delight? O golden wire, Where hast thou spilled thy precious twinkerings?â What thirsty ear hath drained thy melody, And left me but a wild, delirious drop To tincture all my soul with vain desire? [Improvising] Her faceâher browâher hair unfurled!â And O the oval chin below, Carved, like a cunning cameo, With one exquisite dimple, swirled With swimming shine and shade, and whirled The daintiest vortex poets knowâ The sweetest whirlpool ever twirled By Cupid's finger-tip,âand so, The deadliest maelstrom in the world. [PausesâEnter unperceived, Dwainie, behind, in upper bower] Amphine [Again addressing instrument] O Trentoraine! how like an emptiÃ¨d vase Thou artâwhose clustering blooms of song have drooped And faded, one by one, and fallen away And left to me but dry and tuneless stems And crisp and withered tendrils of a voice Whose thrilling tone, now like a throttled sound, Lies stifled, faint, and gasping all in vain For utterance. [Again inmprovising] And O mad wars of blinding blurs And flashings of lance-blades of light, Whet glitteringly athwart the sight That dares confront those eyes of hers! Let any dewdrop soak the hue Of any violet through and through, And then be colorless and dull, Compared with eyes so beautiful! I swear ye that her eyes be bright As noonday, yet as dark as nightâ As bright as be the burnished bars Of rainbows set in sunny skies, And yet as deep and dark, her eyes, And lustrous black as blown-out stars. [PausesâDwainie still unperceived, radiantly smiling and wafting kisses down from trellis-window above] Amphine [Again to instrument] O empty husk of song! If deep within my heart the music thou Hast stored away might find an issuance, A fount of limpid laughter would leap up And gurgle from my lips, and all the winds Would revel with it, riotous with joy; And Dwainie, in her beauty, would lean o'er The battlements of night, and, like the moon, The glory of her face would light the worldâ For I would sing of love. Dwainie And she would hear,â And, reaching overhead among the stars, Would scatter them like daisies at thy feet. Amphine O voice, where art thou floating on the air?â O Seraph-soul, where art thou hovering? Dwainie I hover in the zephyr of thy sighs, And tremble lest thy love for me shall fail To buoy me thus forever on the breath Of such a dream as Heaven envies. Amphine Ah! [Turning, discovers Dwainieâshe still feigning invisibility, while he, with lifted eyes and wistful gaze, preludes with instrumentâthen sings.] Linger, my Dwainie! Dwainie, lily-fair, Stay yet thy step upon the casement-stairâ Poised be thy slipper-tip as is the tine Of some still star.âAh, DwainieâDwainie mine, Yet lingerâlinger there! Thy face, O Dwainie, lily-pure and fair, Gleams i' the dusk, as in thy dusky hair The moony zhoomer glimmers, or the shine Of thy swift smile.âAh, DwainieâDwainie mine, Yet lingerâlinger there! With lifted wrist, whereround the laughing air Hath blown a mist of lawn and clasped it there, Waft finger-thipt adieus that spray the wine Of thy waste kisses toward me, Dwainie mineâ Yet lingerâlinger there! What unloosed splendor is there may compare With thy hand's unfurled glory, anywhere? What glint of dazzling dew or jewel fine May mate thine eyes?âAh, DwainieâDwainie mine! Yet lingerâlinger there! My soul confronts thee: On thy brow and hair It lays its tenderness like palms of prayerâ It touches sacredly those lips of thine And swoons across thy spirit, Dwainie mine, The while thou lingerest there. [Drops trentoraine, and, with open arms, gazes yearningly on Dwainie] Dwainie [Raptly] Thy words do wing my being dovewise! Amphine Then, Thou lovest!âO my homing dove, veer down And nestle in the warm home of my breast! So empty are mine arms, so full my heart, The one must hold thee, or the other burst. Dwainie [Throwing herself in his embrace] Ão's own hand methinks hath flung me here: O hold me that He may not pluck me back! Amphine So closely will I hold thee that not e'en The hand of death shall separate us. Dwainie So May sweet death find us, then, that, woven thus In the corolla of a ripe caress, We may drop lightly, like twin plustre-buds, On Heaven's star-strewn lawn. Amphine So do I pray. But tell me, tender heart, an thou dost love, Where hast thou loitered for so long?âfor thou Didst promise tryst here with me earlier by Some several layodemes which I have told Full chafingly against my finger-tips Till the full complement, save three, are ranged Thy pitiless accusers, claiming, each, So many as their joinÃ¨d number be Shalt thou so many times lift up thy lips For mine's most lingering forgiveness. So, save thee, O my Sweet! and rest thee, I Have ordered merl and viands to be brought For our refreshment here, where, thus alone, I may sip words with thee as well as wine. Why hast thou kept me so athirst?âWhy, I Am jealous of the flattered solitudes In which thou walkest. [They sit at table] Dwainie Nay, I will not tell, Since, an I yielded, countless questions, like In idlest worth, would waste our interview In speculations vain.âLet this suffice:â I stayed to talk with one whom, long ago, I met and knew, and grew to love, forsooth, In dreamy Wunkland.âTalked of mellow nights, And long, long hours of golden olden times When girlish happiness locked hands with me And we went spinning round, with naked feet In swaths of bruisÃ¨d roses ankle-deep; When laughter rang unsilenced, unrebuked, And prayers went unremembered, oozing clean From the drowsed memory, as from the eyes The pure, sweet mother-face that bent above Glimmered and wavered, blurred, bent closer still A timeless instant, like a shadowy flame, Then flickered tremulously o'er the brow And went out in a kiss. Amphine [Kissing her] Not like to this! O blessÃ¨d lips whose kiss alone may be Sweeter than their sweet speech! Speak on, and say Of what else talked thou and thy friend? Dwainie We talked Of all the past, ah me! and all the friends That now await my coming. And we talked Of O so many thingsâso many thingsâ That I but blend them all with dreams of when, With thy warm hand clasped close in this of mine, We cross the floating bridge that soon again Will span the all-unfathomable gulfs Of nether air betwixt this isle of strife And my most glorious realm of changeless peace, Where summer night reigns ever and the moon Hangs ever ripe and lush with radiance Above a land where roses float on wings And fan their fragrance out so lavishly That Heaven hath hint of it, and oft therefrom Sends down to us across the odorous seas Strange argosies of interchanging bud And blossom, spice and balm.âSweetâsweet Beyond all art and wit of uttering. Amphine O Empress of my listening Soul, speak on, And tell me all of that rare land of thine!â For even though I reigned a peerless king Within mine own, methinks I could fling down My scepter, signet, crown and royal might, And so fare down the thornÃ¨d path of life If at its dwindling end my feet might touch Upon the shores of such a land as thou Dost paint for meâthy realm! Tell on of itâ And tell me if thy sister-woman there Is like to theeâYet nay! for an thou didst, These eyes would lose all speech of sight And call not back to thine their utter love. But tell me of thy brothers.âAre they great, And can they grapple Ão's arguments Beyond our skill? or wrest a purpose from The pink side of the moon at Darsten-tide? Or cipher out the problem of blind stars, That ever still do safely grope their way Among the thronging constellations? Dwainie Ay! Ay, they have leaped all earthland barriers In mine own isle of wisdom-working Wunks:â 'Twas Wunkland's son that voyaged round the moon And moored his bark within the molten bays Of bubbling silver: And 'twas Wunkland's son That talked with Marsâunbuckled Saturn's belt And tightened it in squeezure of such facts Therefrom as even he dare not disclose In full till all his followers, as himself, Have grown them wings, and gat them beaks and claws, With plumage all bescienced to withstand All tensest flamesâglaze-throated, too, and lung'd To swallow fiercest-spurted jets and cores Of embered and unquenchable white heat: 'Twas Wunkland's son that alchemized the dews And bred all colored grasses that he wistâ Divorced the airs and mists and caught the trick Of azure-tinting earth as well as sky: 'Twas Wunkland's son that bent the rainbow straight And walked it like a street, and so returned To tell us it was made of hammered shine, Inlaid with strips of selvage from the sun And burnished with the rust of rotten stars: 'Twas Wunkland's son that comprehended first All grosser things, and took our worlds apart And oiled their works with theories that clicked In glib articulation with the pulse And palpitation of the systemed facts.â And, circling ever round the farthest reach Of the remotest welkin of all truths, We stint not our investigations to Our worlds only, but query still beyond.â For now our goolores say, below these isles A million million miles, are other worldsâ Not like to ours, but round, as bubbles are, And, like them, ever reeling on through space, And anchorless through all eternity;â Not like to ours, for our isles, as they note, Are living things that fly about at night, And soar above and cling, throughout the day, Like bats, beneath the bent sills of the skies: And I myself have heard, at dawn of moon, A liquid music filtered through my dreams, As though 'twere myriads of sweet voices, pent In some o'erhanging realm, had spilled themselves In streams of melody that trickled through The chinks and crannies of a crystal pave, Until the wasted juice of harmony, Slow-leaking o'er my senses, laved my soul In ecstacy divine: And afferhaiks, Who scour our coasts on missions for the King, Declare our island's shape is like the zhibb's When lolling in a trance upon the air With open wings upslant and motionless. O such a land it isâso all complete In all wise inhabitants, and knowledge, lore, Arts, sciences, perfected government And kingly wisdom, worth and majestyâ And Artâineffably above all else:â The art of the Romancer,âfabulous Beyond the miracles of strangest fact; The art of Poesy,âthe sanest soul Is made mad with its uttering; the art Of Music,âwords may not e'en whimper what The jewel-sounds of song yield to the sense; And, last,âthe art of Knowing what to Know, And how to zoon straight toward it like a bee, Draining or song or poem as it brims And overruns with raciest spirit-dew.â And, after,âchaos all to sense like thine, Till there, translated, thou shalt know as I. ... So furnished forth in all things lovable Is my Land-Wondrousâay, and thine to be,â O Amphine, love of mine, it lacks but thy Sweet presence to make it a paradise! [Takes up trentoraine] And shall I tell thee of the home that waits For thy glad coming, Amphine?âListen, then! Chant-Recitative A palace veiled in a glimmering dusk; Warm breaths of a tropic air, Drugged with the odorous marzhoo's musk And the sumptuous cyncotwaireâ Where the trembling hands of the lilwing's leaves The winds caress and fawn, While the dreamy starlight idly weaves Designs for the damask lawn. Densed in the depths of a dim eclipse Of palms, in a flowery space, A fountain leaps from the marble lips Of a girl, with a golden vase Held atip on a curving wrist, Drinking the drops that glance Laughingly in the glittering mist Of her crystal utterance. Archways looped o'er blooming walks That lead through gleaming halls; And balconies where the word-bird talks To the tittering waterfalls: And casements, gauzed with the filmy sheen Of a lace that sifts the sight Through a ghost of bloom on the haunted screen That drips with the dews of light. Weird, pale shapes of sculptured stone,â With marble nymphs agaze Ever in fonts of amber, sown With seeds of gold and sprays Of emerald mosses, ever drowned, Where glimpses of shell and gem Peer from the depths, as round and round The nautilus nods at them. Faces blurred in a mazy dance, With a music, wild and sweet, Spinning the threads of the mad romance That tangles the waltzers' feet: Twining arms, and warm, swift thrills That pulse to the melody, Till the soul of the dancer dips and fills In the wells of ecstacy. Eyes that melt in a quivering ore Of love, and the molten kiss Jetted forth of the hearts that pour Their blood in the molds of bliss.â Till, worn to a languor slumber-deep, The soul of the dreamer lifts A silken sail on the gulfs of sleep, And into the darkness drifts. [The instrument falls from her handâAmphine, in stress of passionate delight, embraces her.] Amphine Thou art not all of earth, O angel one! Nor do I far miswonder me an thou Hast peered above the very walls of Heaven! What hast thou seen there?âDidst on Ão bask Thine eyes and clothe Him with new splendorings? And strove He to fling back as bright a smile As thine, the while He beckoned thee within? And, tell me, didst thou meet an angel there A-linger at the gates, nor entering Till I, her brother, joined her? Dwainie Why, hast thou A sister dead?âTruth, I have heard of one Long lost to theeânot dead? Amphine Of her I speak,â And dead, although we know not certainly, We moan us ever it must needs be death Only could hold her from us such long term Of changeless yearning for her glad return. She strayed away from us long, long ago.â O and our memories!âHer wondering eyes That seemed as though they ever looked on things We might not seeâas haply so they did,â For she went from us, all so suddenlyâ So strangely vanished, leaving never trace Of her outgoing, that I ofttimes think Her rapt eyes fell along some certain path Of special glory paven for her feet, And fashioned of Ão's supreme desire That she might bend her steps therein and so Reach Him again, unseen of our mere eyes. My sweet, sweet sister!âlost to brotherâsireâ And, to her heart, one dearer than all else,â Her loverâlost indeed! Dwainie Nay, do not grieve Thee thus, O loving heart! Thy sister yet May come to thee in some glad way the Fates Are fashioning the while thy tear-drops fall! So calm thee, while I speak of thine own self.â For I have listened to a whistling bird That pipes of waiting danger. Didst thou note No strange behavior of thy sire of late? Amphine Ay, he is silent, and he walks as one In some fixed melancholy, or as one Half waking.âEven his worshiped books seem now But things on shelves. Dwainie And doth he counsel not With thee in any wise pertaining to His ailings, or of matters looking toward His future purposes or his intents Regarding thine own future fortunings And his desires and interests therein? What bearing hath he shown of late toward thee By which thou might'st beframe some estimate Of his mind's placid flow or turbulent? And hath he not so spoken thee at times Thou hast been 'wildered of his words, or grieved Of his strange manner? Amphine Once he stayed me on The palace-stair and whispered, âLo, my son, Thy young reign draweth nighâprepare!ââSo passed And vanished as a wraith, so wan he was! Dwainie And didst thou ever reason on this thing, Nor ask thyself what dims thy father's eye And makes a brooding shadow of his form? Amphine Why, there's a household rumor that he dreams Death fareth ever at his side, and soon Shall signal him away.âBut Jucklet saith Crestillomeem hath said the leeches say There is no cause for serious concern; And thus am I assured 'tis nothing more Than childish fancy of mine aging sire,â And so, as now, I laugh, full reverently, And marvel, as I mark his shuffling gait, And his bestrangered air and murmurous lips, As by he glideth to and fro, ha! ha! Ho! ho!âI laugh me many, many timesâ Mind, thou, 'tis reverently I laughâha! ha!â And wonder, as he glideth ghostly-wise, If ever I shall waver as I walk, And stumble o'er my beard, and knit my brows, And o'er the dull mosaics of the pave Play chequers with mine eyes! Ha! ha! Dwainie [Aside] How dareâ How dare I tell him? Yet I mustâI must! Amphine Why, art thou, too, grown childish, that thou canst Find thee waste pleasure talking to thyself And staring frowningly with eyes whose smiles I need so much? Dwainie Nay, rather say, their tears, Poor thoughtless Prince! [Aside] (My magic even now Forecasts his kingly sire's near happening Of nameless hurt and ache and awful stress Of agony supreme, when he shall stare The stark truth in the face!) Amphine What meanest thou? Dwainie What mean I but thy welfare? Why, I mean, One hour agone, the Queen, thy motherâ Amphine Nay, Say only âQueenâ! Dwainie âThe Queen, one hour agoneâ As so I learned from source I need not sayâ Sent message craving audience with the King At noon to-night, within the Tower of Stars.â Thou knowest, only brief space following The time of her pent session thereso set In secret with the King alone, the Throne Is set, too, to convene; and that the King Hath lent his seal unto a mandate that, Should he withhold his presence there, the Queen Shall be empowered to presideâto reignâ Solely endowed to work the royal will In lieu of the good King. Now, therefore, I Have been advised that she, the Queen, by craft Connives to hold him absent purposely, That she may claim the vacancyâfor what Covert design I know not, but I know It augurs peril to you both, as to The Throne's own perpetuity. [Aside] (Again My magic gives me vision terrible:â The Sorceress' legions balk mine own.âThe King Still hers, yet wavering. O save the King, Thou ÃoâRender him to us!) Amphine I feel Thou speakest truth: and yet how know'st thou this? Dwainie Ask me not that; my lips are welded close.â And, more,âsince I have dared to speak, and thou To listen,âJucklet is accessory, And even now is plotting for thy fall. But, Passion of my Soul! think not of me,â For nothing but sheer magic may avail To work me harm;âbut look thou to thyself! For thou art blameless cause of all the hate That rankleth in the bosom of the Queen. So have thine eyes unslumbered ever, that No step may steal behind theeâfor in this Unlooked-of way thine enemy will come: This much I know, but for what fell intent Dare not surmise.âSo look thou, night and day, That none may skulk upon thee in this wise Of dastardly attack. [Aside] (Ha! Sorceress! Thou palest, tossing wild and wantonly The smothering golden tempest of thy hair.â What! lying eyes! ye dare to utter tears? Help! help! Yield us the King!) Amphine And thou, O sweet! How art thou guarded and what shield is thine Of safety? Dwainie Fear not thou for me at all.â Possessed am I of wondrous sorceryâ The gift of Holy Magi at my birth:â Mine enemy must front me in assault And must with mummery of speech assail, And I will know him in first utteranceâ And so may thus disarm him, though he be A giant thrice in vasty form and force. [Singing heard] But, list! what wandering minstrel cometh here In the young night? Voice [In distanceâsinging] The drowsy eyes of the stars grow dim; The wamboo roosts on the rainbow's rim, And the moon is a ghost of shine: The soothing song of the crule is done, But the song of love is a soother one, And the song of love is mine. Then, wake! O wake! For the sweet song's sake, Nor let my heart With the morning break! Amphine Some serenader! Hist! What meaneth he so early, and what thus Within the palace garden-close? Quick; here! He neareth! Soh! Let us conceal ourselves And mark his action, wholly unobserved. [Amphine and Dwainie enter bower] Voice [Drawing nearer] The mist of the morning, chill and gray, Wraps the night in a shroud of spray; The sun is a crimson blot: The moon fades fast, and the stars take wing; The comet's tail is a fleeting thingâ But the tale of love is not. Then, wake! O wake! For the sweet song's sake, Nor let my heart With the morning break! [Enter Jucklet] Jucklet Eex! what a sumptuous darkness is the Nightâ How rich and deep and suave and velvety Its lovely blackness to a soul like mine! Ah, Night! thou densest of all mysteriesâ Thou eeriest of unfathomable delights, Whose soundless sheer inscrutability Is fascination's own ethereal self, Unseen, and yet embodiedâpalpable,â An essence, yet a form of stableness That stays meâweighs me, as a giant palm Were laid on either shoulder.âPeace! I cease Even to strive to grope one further pace, But stand uncovered and with lifted face. O but a glamour of inward light Hath smitten the eyes of my soul to-night! Groping here in the garden-land, I feel my fancy's outheld hand Touch the rim of a realm that seems Like an isle of bloom in a sea of dreams: I stand mazed, dazed and aloneâalone!â My heart beats on in an undertone, And I lean and listen long, and long, And I hold my breath as I hear again The chords of a long-dead trentoraine And the wraith of an old love-song. Low to myself am I whispering:â Glad am I, and the Night knows whyâ Glad am I that the dream came by And found me here as of old when I Was a ruler and a king. Dwainie [To Amphine] What gentle little monster is this dwarfâ Surely not Jucklet of the court? Amphine [Ironically] Ay, ay! But he'll ungentle an thy woman's-heart Yield him but space. Listen: he mouths again. Jucklet It was an age agoâan age Turned down in life like a folded page.â See where the volume falls apart, And the faded book-markâ'tis my heart,â Nor mine alone, but another knit So cunningly in the love of it That you must look, with a shaking head, Nor know the quick one from the dead. Ah! what a broad and sea-like lawn Is the field of love they bloom upon!â Waves of its violet-velvet grass Billowing, with the winds that pass, And breaking in a snow-white foam Of lily-crests on the shores of home. Low to myself am I whispering:â Glad am I, and the Night knows whyâ Glad am I that the dream came by And found me here as of old when I Was a ruler and a king. [Abruptly breaking into impassioned vocal burst] Song Fold me away in your arms, O Nightâ Night, my Night, with your rich black hair!â Tumble it down till my yearning sight And my unkissed lips are hidden quite And my heart is havened there,â Under that mystical dark despairâ Under your rich black hair. Oft have I looked in your eyes, O Nightâ Night, my Night, with your rich black hair!â Looked in your eyes till my face waned white And my heart laid hold of a mad delight That moaned as I held it there Under the deeps of that dark despairâ Under your rich black hair. Just for a kiss of your mouth, O Nightâ Night, my Night, with your rich black hair!â Lo! will I wait as a dead man might Wait for the Judgment's dawning light, With my lips in a frozen prayerâ Under this lovable dark despairâ Under your rich black hair. [With swift change to mood of utter gaiety] Ho! ho! what will my dainty mistress say When I shall stand knee-deep in the wet grass Beneath her lattice, and with upturned eyes And tongue out-lolling like the clapper of A bell, outpour her that? I wonder now If she will not put up her finger thus, And say, âHist! heart of mine! the angels call To thee!â Ho! ho! Or will her blushing face Light up her dim boudoir and, from her glass, Flare back to her a flame upsprouting from The hot-cored socket of a soul whose light She thought long since had guttered out?âHo! ho! Or, haply, will she chastely bend aboveâ A Parian phantomette, with head atip And twinkling fingers dusting down the dews That glitter on the tarapyzma-vines That riot round her casementâgathering Lush blooms to pelt me with while I below All winkingly await the fragrant shower? Ho! ho! how jolly is this thing of love! But how much richer, rarer, jollier Than all the loves is this rare love of mine! Why, my sweet Princess doth not even dream I am her lover,âfor, to here confess, I have a way of wooing all mine own, And waste scant speech in creamy compliment And courtesies all gaumed with winy words.â In sooth, I do not woo at allâI win! How is it now the old duet doth glide Itself full ripplingly adown the grooves Of its quaint melody?âAnd whoso, by The bye, or by the way, or for the nonce, Or, eke ye, peradventure, ever durst Render a duet singly but myself? [Singingâwith grotesque mimicry of two voices] Jucklet's Ostensible Duet How is it you woo?âand now answer me true,â How is it you woo and you win? Why, to answer you true,âthe first thing that you do Is to simply, my dearestâbegin. But how can I begin to woo or to win When I don't know a Win from a Woo? Why, cover your chin with your fan or your fin, And I'll introduce them to you. But what if it drew from my parents a view With my own in no manner akin? No matter!âyour view shall be first of the two,â So I hasten to usher them in. Nay, stay! Shall I grin at the Woo or the Win? And what will he do if I do? Why, the Woo will begin with âHow pleasant it's been!â And the Win with âDelighted with you!â Then supposing he grew very dear to my viewâ I'm speaking, you know, of the Win? Why, then, you should do what he wanted you to,â And now is the time to begin. The time to begin? O then usher him inâ Let him say what he wants me to do. He is here.âHe's a twin of yourself,âI am âWin,â And you are, my darling, my âWooâ! [Capering and courtesying to feigned audience] That song I call most sensible nonsense; And if the fair and peerless Dwainie were But here, with that sweet voice of hers, to take The part of âWoo,â I'd be the happiest âWinâ On this side of futurity! Ho! ho! Dwainie [Aside to Amphine] What means he? Amphine Why, he means that throatless head Of his needs further chucking down betwixt His cloven shoulders! [Starting forwardâDwainie detaining him] Dwainie Nay, thou shalt not stir! See! now the monster hath discovered our Repast. Hold! Let us mark him further. Jucklet [Archly eying viands] What! A roasted wheffle and a toc-spiced whum, Tricked with a larvey and a gherghgling's tail!â And, sprit me! wine enough to swim them in! Now I should like to put a question to The guests; but as there are none, I direct Mine interrogatory to the host. [Bowing to vacancy] Am I behind time?âThen I can but trust My tardy coming may be overlooked In my most active effort to regain A gracious tolerance by service now:â Directing rapt attention to the fact That I have brought mine appetite along, I can but feel, ho! ho! that further words Would be a waste of speech. [Sits at tableâpours out wine, drinks and eats voraciously] There was a time When I was rather backward in my ways In courtly company (as though, forsooth, I felt not, from my very birth, the swish Of royal blood along my veins, though bred Amongst the treacled scullions and the thralls I shot from, like a cork, in youthful years, Into court favor by my wit's sheer stress Of fomentation.âPah! the stench o' toil!) Ay, somehow, as I think, I've all outgrown That coarse, nice age, wherein one makes a meal Of two estardles and a fork of soup. Hey! sanaloo! Lest my starved stomach stand Awe-stricken and aghast, with mouth agape Before the rich profusion of this feast, I lubricate it with a glass of merl And coax it on to more familiar terms Of fellowship with those delectables. [Pours wine and holds up goblet with mock courtliness] Mine host!âThou of the viewless presence and Hush-haunted lip:âThy most imperial, Ethereal, and immaterial health! Live till the sun dries up, and comb thy cares With star-prongs till the comets fizzle out And fade away and fail and are no more! [Drains and refills goblet] And, if thou wilt permit me to observe,â The gleaming shaft of spirit in this wine Goes whistling to its mark, and full and fair Zipps to the target-center of my soul! Why, now am I the veriest gentleman That ever buttered woman with a smile, And let her melt and run and drip and ooze All over and around a wanton heart! And if my mistress bent above me now, In all my hideous deformity, I think she would look over, as it were, The hump upon my back, and so forget The kinks and knuckles of my crooked legs, In this enchanting smile, she needs must leap, Love-dazzled, and fall faint and fluttering Within these yawning, all-devouring arms Of mine! Ho! ho! And yet Crestillomeem Would have me blight my dainty Dwainie with This feather from the Devil's wing!âBut I Am far too full of craft to spoil the eyes That yet shall pour their love like nectar out Into mine own,âand I am far too deep For royal wit to wade my purposes. Dwainie [To Amphine] What can he mean? Amphine [Chafing in suppressed frenzy] Ha! to rush forward and Tear out his tongue and slap it in his face! Dwainie [To Amphine] Nay, nay! Hist what he saith! Jucklet How big a foolâ How all magnificent an idiot Would I be to blight herâ(my peerless one!â My very soul's soul!) as Crestillomeem Doth instigate me to, for her hate's sakeâ And inward jealousy, as well, belike!â Wouldst have my Dwainie blinded to my charmsâ For charms, good sooth, were every several flaw Of my malformÃ¨d outer-self, compared With that his Handsomeness the Prince Amphine Shalt change to at a breath of my puff'd cheek, E'en were it weedy-bearded at the time With such a stubble as a huntsman well Might lose his spaniel in! Ho! ho! Ho! ho! I fear me, O my coy Crestillomeem, Thine ancient coquetry doth challenge still Thine own vain admiration overmuch! I to crush her?âwhen thou, as certainly, Hast armed me to smite down the only bar That lies betwixt her love and mine? Ho! ho! Hey! but the revel I shall riot in Above the beauteous Prince, instantuously Made all abhorrent as a reptiled bulk! Ho! ho! my princely wooer of the fair Rare lady of mine own superior choice! Pah! but my very 'maginings of him RefinÃ¨d to that shamÃ¨d, sickening shape, Do so beloathe me of him there be qualms Expostulating in my forum now! Ho! what unprincifying properties Of medication hath her Majesty Put in my tender charge! Ho! ho! Ho! ho! Ah, Dwainie! sweetest sweet! what shock to thee?â I wonder when she sees the human toad Squat at her feet and cock his filmy eyes Upon her and croak love, if she will not Call me to tweezer him with two long sticks And toss him from her path.âO ho! Ho! ho! Hell bend him o'er some blossom quick, that I May have one brother in the flesh! [Nods drowsily] Dwainie [To Amphine] Ha! See! He groweth drunken.âSoh! Bide yet a spell And I will vex him with my sorcery: Then shall we hence,âfor lo, the node when all Our sublest arts and strategies must needs Be quickened into acts and swift results. Now bide thou here, and in mute silence mark The righteous penalty that hath accrued Upon that dwarfÃ¨d monster. [She stands, still in concealment from the dwarf, her tense gaze fixed upon him as though in mute and painful act of incantation.âJucklet affected drowsilyâyawns and mumbles incoherently âstretches, and gradually sinks at full length on the sward.âDwainie moves forward âAmphine, following, is about to set foot contemptuously on sleeper's breast, but is caught and held away by Dwainie, who imperiously waves him back, and still, in pantomime, commanding, bids him turn and hide his face âAmphine obeying as though unable to do otherwise. Dwainie then unbinds her hair, and throwing it all forward covering her face and bending till it trails the ground, she lifts to the knee her dress, and so walks backward in a circle round the sleeping Jucklet, crooning to herself an incoherent song. Then pausing, letting fall her gown, and rising to full stature, waves her hands above the sleeper's face, and runs to Amphine, who turns about and gazes on her with new wonderment.] Dwainie [To Amphine] Now shalt thou Look on such scaith as thou hath never dreamed. [As she speaks, half averting her face as with melancholy apprehension, chorus of lugubrious voices heard chanting discordantly] Voices When the fat moon smiles, And the comets kiss, And the elves of Spirkland flit The Whanghoo twunkers A tune like this, And the Nightmares champ the bit. [As chorus dies away, a comet, freighted with weird shapes, dips from the night and trails near Jucklet's sleeping figure, while with attendant goblin-forms, two Nightmares, Creech and Gritchfang, alight.âThe comet kisses, switches its tail and disappears, while the two goblins hover buzzingly over Jucklet, who starts wide-eyed and stares fixedly at them, with horribly contorted features.] Creech [To Gritchfang] Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! Flutter your wings like your grandmother does! Tuck in your chin and wheel over and whir-r-r Like a dickerbug fast in the web of the wuhrr! Reel out your tongue, and untangle your toes And rattle your claws o'er the bridge of his nose; Tickle his ears with your feathers and fuzz, And keep up a hum like your grandmother does! [Jucklet moans and clutches at air convulsively] Amphine [Shuddering] Most gruesome sight! See how the poor worm writhes! How must he suffer! Dwainie Ay, but good is meantâ A far voice sings it so. Gritchfang [To Creech] Let me dive deep in his nostriline caves And keep an eye out as to how he behaves: Fasten him down while I put him to rackâ And don't let him flop from the flat of his back! [Shrinks to minute size, while goblin attendants pluck from shrubbery a great lily-shaped flower which they invert funnel-wise, with small end at sleeper's nostrils, hoisting Gritchfang in at top and jostling shape downward gradually from sight, andâremoving flower,âvoice of Gritchfang continues gleefully from within sleeper's head] Ho! I have bored through the floor of his brains, And set them all writhing with torturous pains; And I shriek out the prayer, as I whistle and whiz, I may be the nightmare that my grandmother is! [Reappears, through reversal of flower method, assuming former shape, crosses to Creech, and, joining, the twain dance on sleeper's stomach in broken time to duo] Duo Whing! Whang! So our ancestors sang! And they guzzled hot blood and blew up with a bang!â But they ever tenaciously clung to the rule To only blow up in the hull of a foolâ To fizz and explode like a cast-iron toad In the cavernous depths where his victuals were stowedâ When chances were ripest and thickest and best To burst every buttonhole out of his vest! [They pause, float high above, and fusing together into a great square iron weight drop heavily on chest of sleeper, who moans piteously.] Amphine [Hiding his face] Ah! take me hence! [Dwainie leads him off, looking backward as she goes and waving her hands imploringly to Creech and Gritchfang, reassuming former shapes, in ecstasies of insane delight] Creech [To Gritchfang] Zipp! Zipp! Zipp! Zipp! Sting his tongue raw and unravel his lip! Grope, on the right, down his windpipe, and squeeze His liver as dry as a petrified wheeze! [Gritchfangâas beforeâshrinks and disappears at sleeper's mouth] Throttle his heart till he's black in the face, And bury it down in some desolate place Where only remorse in pent agony lives To dread the advice that your grandmother gives! [The sleeper struggles contortedly, while voice of Gritchfang calls from within] Gritchfang Ho-ho! I have clambered the rungs of his ribs And beriddled his lungs into tatters and dribs; And I turn up the tube of his heart like a hose And squirt all the blood to the end of his nose! I stamp on his stomach and caper and prance, With my tail tossing round like a boomerang-lance! And thus may success ever crown my intent To wander the ways that my grandmother went! [Reappears, falls hysterically in Creech's outstretched arms.âThen dance and duo.] Duo Whing! Whung! So our ancestors sung! And they snorted and pawed, and they hissed and they stung,â Taking special terrific delight in their work On the fools that they found in the lands of the Spirk.â And each little grain of their powders of pain They scraped up and pestled again and againâ Mixed in quadruple doses for gluttons and sots, Till they strangled their dreams with gung-jibbrous knots! [The comet again trails past, upon which the Nightmares leap and disappear. Jucklet staggers to his feet and glares frenziedly aroundâthen starts for opposite exit of cometâis there suddenly confronted with fiend-faces in the air, bewhiskered with ragged purplish flames that flare audibly and huskily in abrupt alternating chill gasps and hot welterings of wind. He starts back from them, reels and falls prostrate, groveling terrifiedly in the dust, and chattering, with eerie music accompanying his broken utterance.] Jucklet Ão! Ão! Ão! Thou dost all things knowâ Waving all claims of mine to dare to pray, Save that I needs must:âLo, What may I pray for? Yea, I have not any way, An Thou gainsayest me a tolerance so.â I dare not pray Forgivenessâtoo great My vast o'ertoppling weight Of sinning; nor can I Pray my Poor soul unscourged to go.â Frame Thou my prayer, Ão! What may I pray for? Dare I shape a prayer, In sooth, For any canceled joy Of my mad youth, Or any bliss my sin's stress did destroy? What may I pray forâWhat?â That the wild clusters of forget-me-not And mignonette And violet Be out of childhood brought, And in mine hard heart set A-blooming now as then?â With all their petals yet Bediamonded with dewsâ Their sweet, sweet scent let loose Full sumptuously again! What may I pray, Ão! For the poor hutchÃ¨d cot Where death sate squat Midst my first memories?âLo! My mother's faceâ(they, whispering, told me so)â That face!âso pinchedly It blanched up, as they lifted meâ Its frozen eyelids would Not part, nor could Be ever wetted open with warm tears. ... Who hears The prayers for all dead-mother-sakes, Ão! Leastwise one mercy:âMay I not have leave to pray All self to pass awayâ Forgetful of all needs mine ownâ Neglectful of all creeds;âalone, Stand fronting Thy high throne and say: To Thee, O Infinite, I pray Shield Thou mine enemy! [Music throughout supplication gradually softens and sweetens into utter gentleness, with scene slow-fading into densest night.] End Act II ACT III Scene I. Court of KrungâRoyal Ministers, Counselors, etc., in session. Crestillomeem, in full blazonry of regal attire, presiding. She signals a Herald at her left, who steps forward. âBlare of trumpets, greeted with ominous murmurings within, blent with tumult from without. Herald Hist, ho! Ay, ay! Ay, ay!âHer Majesty, The All-Glorious and Ever-Gracious Queen, Crestillomeem, to her most loyal, leal And right devoted subjects, greeting sendsâ Proclaiming, in the absence of the King, Her royal presenceâ [Voice of Herald fails abruptlyâutterly.âA breathless hush falls sudden on the court.âA sense oppressiveâominousâaffects the throng. Weird music heard of unseen instruments.] Herald [Huskily striving to be heard] Hist, ho! Ay, ay! Ay, ay!âHer Majesty, The All-Glorious and Ever-Gracious Queen, Crestillomeemâ [The Queen gasps, and clutches at Herald, mutely signing him to silence, her staring eyes fixed on a shadowy figure, mistily developing before her into wraith-like form and likeness of The Tune-Fool, Spraivoll. The shapeâevidently invisible and voiceless to all senses but the Queen'sâwavers vaporishly to and fro before her, moaning and crooning in infinitely sweet-sad minor cadences a mystic song.] Wraith-Song of Spraivoll. I will not hear the dying word Of any friend, nor stroke the wing Of any little wounded bird. ... Love is the deadest thing! I wist not if I see the smile Of prince or wight, in court or lane.â I only know that afterwhile He will not smile again. The summer blossom, at my feet, Swims backward, drowning in the grass.â I will not stay to name it sweetâ Sink out! and let me pass! I have no mind to feel the touch Of gentle hands on brow and hair.â The lack of this once pained me much, And so I have a care. Dead weeds, and husky-rustling leaves That beat the dead boughs where ye cling, And old dead nests beneath the eavesâ Love is the deadest thing! Ah once I fared not all alone; And onceâno matter, rain or snow!â The stars of summer ever shoneâ Because I loved him so! With always tremblings in his hands, And always blushes unaware, And always ripples down the strands Of his long yellow hair. I needs must weep a little space, Remembering his laughing eyes And curving lip, and lifted face Of rapture and surprise. O joy is dead in every part, And life and hope; and so I sing: In all the graveyard of my heart Love is the deadest thing! [With dying away of song, apparition of Spraivoll slowly vanishes. Crestillomeem turns dazedly to throng, and with labored effort strives to reassume imperious mien.âSigns for merl and tremulously drains gobletâsinks back in throne with feigned complacency, mutely waving Herald to proceed.] Herald [Mechanically] Hist, ho! Ay, ay! Ay, ay!âHer Majesty, The All-Glorious and Ever-Gracious Queen, Crestillomeem, to her most loyal, leal And right devoted subjects, greeting sendsâ Proclaiming, in the absence of the King, Her royal presence, as by him empowered To sit and occupy, maintain and hold, And therefrom rule the Throne, in sovereign state, And work the royal willâ[Confusion] Hist, ho! Ay, ay! Ay, ay!âAnd be it known, the King, in view Of his approaching dissolutionâ [Sensation among Counselors, etc., within, and wild tumult without and cries of âLong live the King!â and âTreason!â âIntrigue!â âSorcery!â Crestillomeem, in suppressed ire, waving silence, and Herald striving to be heard.] Herald Hist, ho! Ay, ay! Ay, ay!âThe King, in view Of his approaching dissolution, hath Decreed this instrumentâthis royal scroll [Unrolling and displaying scroll] With royal seal thereunto set by Krung's Most sacred act and signâ [General sensation within, and growing tumult without, with wrangling cries of âPlot!â âTreason!â âConspiracy!â and âDown with the Queenâ âDown with the usurper!â âDown with the Sorceress!â] Crestillomeem [Wildly] Who dares to cry âConspiracy!â Bring me the traitor-knave! [Growing confusion withoutâsound of rioting.â Voice, âLet me be taken! Let me be taken!â Enter Guards, dragging Jucklet forward, wild-eyed and hystericalâthe Queen's gaze fastened on him wonderingly.] Crestillomeem [To Guards] Why bring ye Jucklet hither in this wise? Guard O Queen, 'tis he who cries âConspiracy!â And who incites the mob without with cries Of âPlot!â and âTreason!â Crestillomeem [Starting] Ha! Can this be true? I'll not believe it!âJucklet is my fool, But not so vast a fool that he would tempt His gracious Sovereign's ire. [To Guards] Let him be freed! [Then to Jucklet, with mock service] Stand hither, O my Fool! Jucklet [To Queen] What! I, thy fool? Ho! ho! Thy fool?âho! ho!âWhy, thou art mine! [Confusionâcries of âStrike down the traitor!â Jucklet wrenching himself from grasp of officers] Back, all of ye! I have not waded hell That I should fear your puny enmity! Here will I give ye proof of all I say! [Presses toward throne, wedging his opposers left and rightâCrestillomeem sits as though stricken speechlessâpallid, waving him backâ Jucklet, fairly fronting her, with folded arms âthen to throng continues.] Lo! do I here defy her to lift up Her voice and say that Jucklet speaks a lie. [At sign of Queen, Officers, unperceived by Jucklet, close warily behind him.] And, furtherâI pronounce the document That craven Herald there holds in his hand A forgeryâa trickâand dare the Queen, Here in my listening presence, to command Its further utterance! Crestillomeem [Wildly rising] Hold, hireling!âFool!â The Queen thou dost in thy mad boasts insult Shall utter first thy doom! [Jucklet, seized from behind by Guards, is hurled face upward on the dais at her feet, while a minion, with drawn sword pressed close against his breast, stands over him.] âEre we proceed With graver matters, let this demon-knave Be sent back home to hell. [With awful stress of ire, form quivering, eyes glittering and features twitched and ashen] Give me the sword,â The insult hath been mineâso even shall The vengeance be! [As Crestillomeem seizes sword and bends forward to strike, Jucklet, with superhuman effort, frees his hand, and, with a sudden motion and an incoherent muttering, flings object in his assailant's face,âCrestillomeem staggers backward, dropping sword, and, with arms tossed aloft, shrieks, totters and falls prone upon the pave. In confusion following Jucklet mysteriously vanishes; and as the bewildered Courtiers lift the fallen Queen, a clear, piercing voice of thrilling sweetness is heard singing.] Voice The pride of noon must wither soonâ The dusk of death must fall; Yet out of darkest night the moon Shall blossom over all! [For an instant a dense cloud envelops empty throne âthen gradually lifts, discovering therein Krung seated, in royal panoply and state, with Jucklet in act of presenting scepter to him.â Blare of trumpets, and chorus of Courtiers, Ministers, Heralds, etc.] Chorus All hail! Long live the King! Krung [To throng, with grave salutation] Through Ão's own great providence, and through The intervention of an angel whom I long had deemed forever lost to me, Once more your favored Sovereign, do I greet And tender you my blessing, O most good And faith-abiding subjects of my realm! In common, too, with your long-suffering King, Have ye long suffered, blamelessly as he: Now, therefore, know ye all what, until late, He knew not of himself, and with him share The rapturous assurance that is his,â That, for all time to come, are we restored To the old glory and most regal pride And opulence and splendor of our realm. [Turning with pained features to the strangely stricken Queen] There have been, as ye needs must know, strange spells And wicked sorceries at work within The very dais boundaries of the Throne. Lo! then, behold your harrier and mine, And with me grieve for the self-ruined Queen Who grovels at my feet, blind, speechless, and So stricken with a curse herself designed Should light upon Hope's fairest minister. [Motions attendants, who lead away Crestillomeem âthe King gazing after her, overmastered with stress of his emotions.âHe leans heavily on throne, as though oblivious to all surroundings, and, shaping into speech his varying thought, as in a trance, speaks as though witless of both utterance and auditor.] I loved her.âWhy? I never knew.âPerhaps Because her face was fair; perhaps because Her eyes were blue and wore a weary air;â Perhaps ... perhaps because her limpid face Was eddied with a restless tide, wherein The dimples found no place to anchor and Abide: perhaps because her tresses beat A froth of gold about her throat, and poured In splendor to the feet that ever seemed Afloat. Perhaps because of that wild way Her sudden laughter overleapt propriety; Orâwho will say?âperhaps the way she wept. Ho! have ye seen the swollen heart of summer Tempest, o'er the plain, with throbs of thunder Burst apart and drench the earth with rain? She Wept like that.âAnd to recall, with one wild glance Of memory, our last love-partingâtears And all. ... It thrills and maddens me! And yet My dreams will hold her, flushed from lifted brow To finger-tips, with passion's ripest kisses Crushed and mangled on her lips. ... O woman! while Your face was fair, and heart was pure, and lips Were true, and hope as golden as your hair, I should have strangled you! [As Krung, ceasing to speak, piteously lifts his face, Spraivoll all suddenly appears, in space left vacant by the Queen, and, kneeling, kisses the King's hand.âHe bends in tenderness, kissing her browâthen lifts and seats her at his side. Speaks then to throng.] Good SubjectsâLords: Behold in this sweet woman here my child, Whom, years agone, the cold, despicable Crestillomeemâby baleful, wicked arts And gruesome spells and fearsome witcheriesâ Did spirit off to some strange otherland, Where, happily, a Wunkland Princess found Her, and undid the spell by sorcery More potentâay, Divine, since it works naught But goodâthe gift of Ão, to right wrong. This magic dower the Wunkland Princess hath Enlisted in our restoration here, In secret service, till this joyful hour Of our complete deliverance. Even thus.â Lo, let the peerless Princess now appear! [He lifts scepter, and a gust of melody, divinely beautiful, sweeps through the court.âThe star above the throne loosens and drops slowly downward, bursting like a bubble on the scepter-tip, and, issuing therefrom, Amphine and Dwainie, hand in hand, kneel at the feet of Krung, who bends above them with his blessing, while Jucklet capers wildly round the group.] Jucklet Ho! ho! but I could shriek for very joy! And though my recent rival, fair Amphine, Doth even now bend o'er a blossom, I, Besprit me! have no lingering desire To meddle with it, though with but one eye I slept the while she backward walked around Me in the garden. [Amphine dubiously smilesâJucklet blinks and leersâand Dwainie bites her finger.] Krung Peace! good Jucklet! Peace! For this is not a time for any jest.â Though the old order of our realm hath been Restored, and though restored my very lifeâ Though I have found a daughter,âI have lost A sonâfor Dwainie, with her sorcery, Will, on the morrow, carry him away. 'Tis Ão's largess, as our love is His, And our abiding trust and gratefulness. Curtain WHEN I DO MOCK When I do mock the blackness of the night With my despairâoutweep the very dews And wash my wan cheeks stark of all delight, Denying every counsel of dear use In mine embittered state; with infinite Perversity, mine eyes drink in no sight Of pleasance that nor moon nor stars refuse In silver largess and gold twinklings bright;â I question me what mannered brain is mine That it doth trick me of the very food It panteth forâthe very meat and wine That yet should plump my starvÃ¨d soul with good And comfortable plethora of ease, That I might drowse away such rhymes as these. THE HIGHEST GOOD To attain the highest good Of true man and womanhood, Simply do your honest bestâ God with joy will do the rest. EZRA HOUSE [These lines was writ, in ruther high sperits, jest at the close of what's called the Anti Bellum Days, and more to be a-foolin' than anything else,âthough they is more er less facts in it. But some of the boys, at the time we was all a-singin' it, fer Ezry's benefit, to the old tune of âThe Oak and the Ash and the Bonny Willer Tree,â got it struck off in the weekly, without leave er lisence of mine; and so sence they's allus some of 'em left to rigg me about it yit, I might as well claim the thing right here and now, so here goes. I give it jest as it appeard, fixed up and grammatisized consider'ble, as the editer told me he took the liburty of doin', in that sturling old home paper The Advanceâas sound a paper yit to-day and as stanch and abul as you'll find in a hunderd.] Come listen, good people, while a story I do tell, Of the sad fate of one which I knew so passing well; He enlisted at McCordsville, to battle in the South, And protect his country's union; his name was Ezra House. He was a young school-teacher, and educated high In regards to Ray's arithmetic, and also Algebra: He give good satisfaction, but at his country's call He dropped his position, his Algebra and all. âIt's oh, I'm going to leave you, kind scholars,â he saidâ For he wrote a composition the last day and read; And it brought many tears in the eyes of the school, To say nothing of his sweetheart he was going to leave so soon. âI have many recollections to take with me away, Of the merry transpirations in the schoolroom so gay; And of all that's past and gone I will never regret I went to serve my country at the first of the outset!â He was a good penman, and the lines that he wrote On that sad occasion was too fine for me to quote,â For I was there and heard it, and I ever will recall It brought the happy tears to the eyes of us all. And when he left, his sweetheart she fainted away. And said she could never forget the sad day When her lover so noble, and galliant and gay, Said âFare you well, my true love!â and went marching away. But he hadn't been gone for more than two months, When the sad news comeââhe was in a skirmish once, And a cruel Rebel ball had wounded him full sore In the region of the chin, through the canteen he wore.â But his health recruited up, and his wounds they got well, But whilst he was in battle at Bull Run or Malvern Hill, The news come again, so sorrowful to hearâ âA sliver from a bombshell cut off his right ear.â But he stuck to the boys, and it's often he would write, That âhe wasn't afraid for his country to fight.â But oh, had he returned on a furlough, I believe He would not, to-day, have such cause to grieve. For in another battleâthe name I never heardâ He was guarding the wagons when an accident occurred,â A comrade who was under the influence of drink, Shot him with a musket through the right cheek, I think. But his dear life was spared; but it hadn't been for long, Till a cruel Rebel colonel come riding along, And struck him with his sword, as many do suppose, For his cap-rim was cut off, and also his nose. But Providence, who watches o'er the noble and the brave, Snatched him once more from the jaws of the grave; And just a little while before the close of the war, He sent his picture home to his girl away so far. And she fell into decline, and she wrote in reply, âShe had seen his face again and was ready to dieâ; And she wanted him to promise, when she was in her tomb, He would only visit that by the light of the moon. But he never returned at the close of the war, And the boys that got back said he hadn't the heart; But he got a position in a powder-mill, and said He hoped to meet the doom that his country denied. THE VISION OF RABBI BEN ISAAC For three score years my wandering feet have strayed Along a path wherein no footprint lay Of Him, who of the cross a guide-board made To point me out the way. With open eyes I dreamed that I was deadâ Dead to all outward semblance, though I lay With some old scrap of reason in my head That would not fade away. And peering up in wonderment I saw My floating spirit plume its wings elate, Yet gazing upward with a look of awe, It seemed to hesitate. âGo on!â I called to it. âLeap into space, And sweep a way to glory with thy wings!â âAlas!â it answered back, with troubled face, âThey are such trembling things!â And hovering above me, spread them wide, And all their glossy plumage o'er my eyes Shook out in downy splendor, crimson-dyed With hues of Paradise. âNay, glorious things are they,â I cried amazed, And veiled my vision from their dazzling lightâ âSo, get thee goneâtheir maker must be praisedââ And upward through the night It lifted like a meteor, and sailed Across the gulf of darkness like a flame, While down the smoldering wake behind it trailed The ashes of my name. It called to meânot larger than a flake Of starlight did it glimmer through the gloomâ âPray for me,â fell the voice, âfor Jesus' sake! I see the heavens bloom.â And loathful to myself I whispered then, As wholly from my gaze the glimmer wentâ âO Lord, through Christ, receive my soul, Amen.â And like an instrument Of music in some heavenly tumult tipped, Outpouring the elixir of its voice, Down-showering upon my senses dripped The utterance, âRejoice! âGod listens, for the angels at the door Are swarming out and in and out again, And o'er and round about me evermore They sing âGood will to men!ââ Then suddenly the voice in quaverings Fell wailinglyââAlas! for I alone Of all the glorious throng have tarnished wings That Heaven will not own. âThe angel Truth has pityingly said That every plume impure Christ will condemn, And that the stain self-righteousness is red As blood on all of them.â Then to my soul I cried aloud: âReturn That I may bow my head in holier prayer, And all the recompense of good I earn Shall blossom everywhere.â âNot so.â It answered, as in some surpriseâ âThe angel Faith has whispered âLook above,â And shading with her wings my dazzled eyes, Points out the angel Love, âWho, weeping, bends above me, and her tears Baptize me, and her sister Mercy trips Along the golden clouds, and Christ appears With sorrow on His lipsââ Then silence, and as one who vainly wars With inner strife: âCome back to me!â I cried, And pealing down a pathway of the stars A ringing voice repliedâ âNow is thy soul's probation so complete It may but answer thee with one farewellâ; And, filtered through the gloom, lo! at my feet A snow-white feather fell. DAN PAINE Old friend of mine, whose chiming name Has been the burthen of a rhyme Within my heart since first I came To know thee in thy mellow prime: With warm emotions in my breast That can but coldly be expressed, And hopes and wishes wild and vain, I reach my hand to thee, Dan Paine. In fancy, as I sit alone In gloomy fellowship with care, I hear again thy cheery tone, And wheel for thee an easy chair; And from my hand the pencil fallsâ My book upon the carpet sprawls, As eager soul and heart and brain Leap up to welcome thee, Dan Paine. A something gentle in thy mien, A something tender in thy voice, Has made my trouble so serene, I can but weep, from very choice. And even then my tears, I guess, Hold more of sweet than bitterness, And more of gleaming shine than rain, Because of thy bright smile, Dan Paine. The wrinkles that the years have spun And tangled round thy tawny face, Are kinked with laughter, every one, And fashioned in a mirthful grace. And though the twinkle of thine eyes Is keen as frost when Summer dies, It can not long as frost remain While thy warm soul shines out, Dan Paine. And so I drain a health to thee:â May merry Joy and jolly Mirth Like children clamber on thy knee, And ride thee round the happy earth! And when, at last, the hand of Fate Shall lift the latch of Canaan's gate, And usher me in thy domain, Smile on me just as now, Dan Paine. OLD HEC'S IDOLATRY Heigh-o! our jolly tilts at New World song!â What was the poem indeed! and where the bardâ âStabbing his ink-pot ever, not his heart,â As Hector phrased it contumeliously, Mouthing and munching, at the orchard-stile, A water-cored rambo whose spirted juice Glanced, sprayed and flecked the sunlight as he mouth'd And muncht, and muncht and mouth'd. All loved the man! âOur Hectorâ as his Alma Mater oozed It into utteranceââOld Hecâ said we Who knew him, hide-and-tallow, hoof-and-horn! So he: âO ay! my soul! our New World songâ The tweedle-deedles of our modern schoolâ A school of minnows,ânot one gamy bassâ To hook the angler, not the angler him. Here! all ye little fishes: tweedle-dee! Soh! oneâalong the vasty stream of timeâ Glints to the surface with a gasp,âand, lo, A bubble! and he thinks, âMy eye!âsee there, Ye little fishes,âthere's a song I've sung!â Another gapes: another bubble; then He thinks: âWell, is it not a wondrous art To breathe a great immortal poem like that!â And then anotherâand another stillâ And yet another,âtill from brim to brim The tide is postuled over with a pest Of bubblesâbursting bubbles! Ay! O ay!â So, bluff old Hec. And we, who knew his mood Had ramped its worstâunless we roused it yet To ire's horiffickest insanity By some inane, unguarded reference To âverse beragged in Hoosier dialectââ (A strangely unforgotten coinage of Old Hec's, long years agone)âwe, so, forbore A word, each glimpsing each, as down we sank, Couched limply in the orchard's selvage, whereâ The rambo finished and the soggy core Zippt at a sapphire wasp with waist more slim Than any slender lady's, of old wars, Pent fasting for long sennights in tall towers That overtop the undercringing seasâ With one accordant voice, the while he creased His scroll of manuscript, we said, âGo on.â Then Hector thus: AN IDYL OF THE KING Erewhile, as Autumn, to King Arthur's court Came Raelus, clamoring: âLo, has our house Been sacked and pillaged by a lawless band Of robber knaves, led on by AlstanÃ©s, The Night-Flower named, because of her fair face, All like a lily gleaming in the dusk Of her dark hairâand like a lily brimmed With dewy eyes that drip their limpid smiles Like poison out, for by them has been wro't My elder brother's doom, as much I fear. While three days gone was holden harvest-feast At Lynion Castleâclinging like a gull High up the gray cliffs of Caerleonâ Came, leaf-like lifted from the plain below As by a twisted wind, a rustling pack Of bandit pillagers, with AlstanÃ©s Bright-fluttering like a red leaf in the front. And ere we were aware of fell intentâ Not knowing whether it was friend or foeâ We found us in their toils, and all the house In place of guests held only prisonersâ Save that the host, my brother, wro't upon By the strange beauty of the robber queen, Was left unfettered, but by silken threads Of fine-spun flatteries and wanton smiles Of the enchantress, till her villain thieves Had rifled as they willed and signal given To get to horse again. And so they wentâ Their leader flinging backward, as she rode, A kiss to my mad brotherâmad since then,â For from that sorry hour he but talked Of AlstanÃ©s, and her rare beauty, and Her purityâay, even that he said Was star-white, and should light his life with love Or leave him groping blindly in its quest Thro' all eternity. So, sighing, he Went wandering about till set of sun, Then got to horse, and bade us all farewell; And with his glamoured eyes bent trancedly Upon the tumbled sands that marked the way The robber-woman went, he turned and chased His long black shadow o'er the edge of night.â âSo Raelus, all seemingly befret With such concern as nipped his utterance In scraps of speech: at which Sir Lancelot, Lifting a slow smile to the King, and then Turning his cool eye on the youthââAnd you Would track this siren-robber to her hold And rout her rascal followers, and free Your brother from the meshes of this queen Of heartsâfor there you doubtless think him?â âAy!â Foamed Raelus, cheek flushed and eye aflame,â âSo even have I tracked, and found them, too, And know their burrow, shrouded in a copse, Where, faring in my brother's quest, I heard The nicker of his horse, and followed on, And found him tethered in a thicket wild, As tangled in its tress of leaf and limb As is a madman's hair; and down the path That parted it and ran across a knoll And dipped again, all suddenly I came Upon a cave, wide-yawning 'neath a beard Of tangled moss and vine, whence issuing I heard, blown o'er my senses faint and clear As whiffs of summer wind, my brother's voice Lilting a love-song, with the burden tricked With dainty warblings of a woman's tongue: And even as I listening bent, I heard Such peals of wanton merriment as made My own heart flutter as a bird that beats For freedom at the bars that prison it. So turned I then and fled as one who flies To save himself aloneâforgetful all Of that my dearer selfâmy brother.âO!ââ Breaking as sharply as the icy blade That loosens from the eave to slice the air And splinter into scales of flying frostâ âThy help! Thy help! A dozen goodly knightsâ Ay, even that, if so it be their hearts Are hungry as my own to right the wrong!â So Raelus. And Arthur graciously Gave ear to him, and, patient, heard him thro', And pitied him, and granted all he asked; Then took his hand and held it, saying, âStrong And ever stronger may its grasp be knit About the sword that flashes in the cause Of good.â Thus Raelus, on the morrow's front, Trapped like a knight and shining like a star, Pranced from the archway of the court, and led His glittering lances down the gleaming road That river-like ran winding till it slipped Out of the palace view and spilled their shields Like twinkling bubbles o'er the mountain brim. Then happed it that as Raelus rode, his tongue Kept even pace and cantered ever on Right merrily. His brother, as he said, Had such an idle soul within his breastâ Such shallowness of fancy for his heart To drift about inâthat he well believed Its anchor would lay hold on any smile The lees of womanhood might offer him. As for himself, he loved his brother well, Yet had far liefer see him stark and white In marble death than that his veins should burn With such vitality as spent its flame So garishly it knew no steady blaze, But ever wavered round as veered the wind Of his conceit; for he had made his boastâ Tho' to his own shame did he speak of itâ That with a wink he could buy every smile That virtue owned. So tattled Raelus Till, heated with his theme, he lifted voice And sang the song, âThe Light of Woman's Eyes!â âO bright is gleaming morn on mountain height; And bright the moon, slipt from its sheath of night,â But brighter is the light of woman's eyes. âAnd bright the dewdrop, trembling on the lip Of some red rose, or lily petal-tip, Or lash of pink,âbut brighter woman's eyes. âBright is the firefly's ever-drifting spark That throbs its pulse of light out in the dark; And bright the stars,âbut brighter woman's eyes. âBright morn or even; bright or moon or star, And all the many twinkling lights that are,â O brighter than ye all are woman's eyes.â So Raelus sang.âAnd they who rode with him Bewildered were, and even as he sang Went straggling, twos and threes, and fell behind To whisper wonderingly, âIs he a fool?â And âDoes he waver in his mind?â and âDoes The newness of adventure dazzle him?â So spake they each to each, till far beyond, With but one loathful knight in company, They saw him quit the beaten track, and turn Into the grassy margin of a wood. And loitering, they fell in mocking jest Of their strange leader! âSee! why, see!â said one,â âHe needs no help to fight his hornets' nest, But one brave knight to squire him!ââpointing on To where fared on the two and disappeared. âO ay!â said one, âbelike he is some old War-battered knight of long-forgotten age, That, bursting from his chrysalis, the grave, Comes back to show us tricks we never dreamed!â âOr haply,â said another, with a laugh,â âHe rides ahead to tell them that he comes And shrive them ere his courage catches up.â And merry made they all, and each in turn Filliped a witty pellet at his head: Until, at last, their shadows shrunk away And shortened 'neath them and the hour was noon, They flung them from their horses listlessly Within the grassy margin of the wood Where had passed Raelus an hour agone: And, hungered, spied a rustic; and they sent To have them such refreshment as might be Found at the nearest farm,âwhere, as it chanced, Was had most wholesome meat, and milk, and bread; And honey, too, celled in its fretted vase Of gummy gold and dripping nectar-sweet As dreamed-of kisses from the lips of love; Wine, too, was broughten, rosy as the dawn That ushers in the morning of the heart; And tawny, mellow pear, whose golden ore Fell molten on the tongue and oozed away In creamy and delicious nothingness; And netted melon, musky as the breath Of breezes blown from out the Orient; And purple clusterings of plum and grape, Blurred with a dust dissolving at the touch Like flakes the fairies had snowed over them. And as the idlers basked, with toast and song And graceful dalliance and wanton jest, A sound of trampling hooves and jingling reins Brake sudden, stilled them; and from out a dim Path leading from the bosky wood there came A troop of mounted damsels, nigh a score, Led by a queenly girl, in crimson clad, With lissome figure lithe and willowy, And face as fair and sweet and pure withal As might a maiden lily-blossom be Ere it has learned the sin of perfect bloom: Her hair, blown backward like a silken scarf And fondled by the sun, was glossier And bluer black than any raven's wing. âAnd O!â she laughed, not knowing she was heard By any but her fellows: âMen are fools!â Then drawing rein, and wheeling suddenly, Her charger mincing backward,ââRaelusâ My Raelus is greater than ye all, Since he is such a fool that he forgets He is a man, and lets his tongue of love Run babbling like a silly child's; and, pah! I puff him to the winds like thistle-down!â And, wheeling as she spake, found staring up, Wide-eyed and wondering, a group of knights, Half lifted, as their elbows propped their heads, Half lying; and one, smirker than the rest, Stood bowing very low, with upturned eyes Lit with a twinkling smile: âFair ladyâand Most gracious gentlewomenââseeing that The others drew them back as tho' abashed And veiled their faces with all modesty, Tho' she, their leader, showed not any qualm,â âSince all unwittingly we overheard Your latest speech, and since we know at last âAll men are fools,â right glad indeed am I That such a nest of us remains for you To vanquish with those eyes.â Then, serious, That she nor smiled nor winced, nor anythingâ âYour pardon will be to me as a shower Of gracious rain unto a panting drouth.â So bowed in humblest reverence; at which The damsel, turning to her followers, Laughed musically,ââSee! he proves my words!â Whereat the others joined with inward glee Her pealing mirth; and in the merriment The knights chimed, too, and he, the vanquished one, Till all the wood rang as at hunting-tide When bugle-rumors float about the air And echoes leap and revel in delight. Then spake the vanquished knight, with mental eye Sweeping the vantage-ground that chance had gained,â âYour further pardon, lady: Since the name Of Raelus fell from those lips of thine, We fain would know of him. He led us here, And as he went the way wherefrom your path Emerges, haply you may tell us where He may be found?â âWhat! Raelus?â she cried,â âHe comes with you?âThe brave Sir Raelus?â That mighty champion?âthat gallant knight?â That peerless wonder of all nobleness? Then proud am I to greet ye, knowing that; And, certes, had I known of it ere now, Then had I proffered you more courtesy And told you, ere the asking, that he bides The coming of his friends a league from this, Hard by a reedy mere, where in high tune We left him singing, nigh an hour agone.â Then, as she lightly wheeled her horse about And signal gave to her companions To follow, gaily cried: âTell Raelus His cousin sends to him her sad farewells And fond regrets, and kisses many as His valorous deeds are numbered in her heart.â And with âFair morrow to ye, gentle knights!â Her steed's hooves struck the highway at a bound; And dimly thro' the dust they saw her lead Her fluttering cavalcade as recklessly As might a queen of Araby, fleet-horsed, Skim o'er the level sands of Syria. So vanished. And the knights with one accord Put foot in stirrup, and, with puzzled minds And many-channeled marvelings, filed in The woody path, and fared them on and on Thro' denser glooms, and ways more intricate; Till, mystified at last and wholly lost, They made full halt, and would have turned them back But that a sudden voice brake on their ears All piteous and wailing, as distressed: And, following these cries, they sharply came Upon an open road that circled round A reedy flat and sodden tract of sedge, Moated with stagnant water, crusted thick With slimy moss, wherein were wriggling things Entangled, and blind bubbles bulging up And bursting where from middle way upshot A tree-trunk, with its knarled and warty hands As tho' upheld to clutch at sliding snakes Or nip the wet wings of the dragon-fly. Here gazing, lo! they saw their comrade, he That had gone on with Raelus; and he Was tugging to fling back into its place A heavy log that once had spanned the pool And made a footway to the sedgy flat Whence came the bitter wailing cries they heard. Then hastened they to join him in his task; But, panting, as they asked of Raelus, All winded with his work, yet jollier Than meadow-lark at morn, he sent his voice In such a twittering of merriment, The wail of sorrow died and laughter strewed Its grave with melody. âO Raelus! Rare Raelus!â he cried and clapped his hands, And even in the weeds that edged the pool Fell wrestling with his mirth.ââWhy, Raelus,â He said, when he at last could speak again, âDrew magnet-likeâyou know that talk of his,â And so, adhesive, did I cling, and cling Until I found us in your far advance, And, hidden in the wood, I stayed to say 'Twas better we should bide your coming. âNo.â Then on again; and still a second timeâ âShall we not bide their coming?â âNo!â he said; And on again, until the third; and âNoâ We'll push a little further.â As we did; And, sudden, came upon an open gladeâ There to the northward,âby a thicket bound: Then he dismounted, giving me his rein, And, charging me to keep myself concealed, And if he were not back a certain time To ride for you and search where he had gone, He crossed the opening and passed from sight Within the thicket. I was curious: And so, dismounting, tethered our two steeds And followed him; and, creeping warily, Came on him whereâunseen of himâI saw Him pause before the cave himself described Before us yesternoon. And here he put His fingers to his lips and gave a call Bird-like and quavering: at which a face, As radiant as summer sun at morn, Parted the viny curtains of the cave; And then, a moment later, came in view A woman even fairer than my sight Might understand. âWhat! dare you come again?â As, lifting up her eyes all flashingly, She scorched him with a look of hate.ââBegone! Or have youâtraitor, villain, knave, and cur,â Bro't minions of the law to carry out The vengeance of your whimpering jealousy?â Then Raelus, all cowering before Her queenly anger, faltered: âHear me yet; I do not threaten. But your loveâyour love!â O give me that. I know you pure as dew: Your love! Your love!âThe smile that has gone out And left my soul a midnight of despair!â Your love or life! For I have even now Your stronghold girt about with certain doom If you but waver in your choice.âYour love!â At which, as quick as tho't, leapt on him there A strong man from the covert of the gloom; And others, like to him, from here and there Came skurrying. I, turning, would have fled, But found myself as suddenly beset And tied and tumbled there with Raelus. And him they haltered by his squirming heels Until he did confess such villainy As made me wonder if his wits were soundâ Confessed himself a renegadeâa thiefâ Ay, even one of them, save that he knew Not that nice honor even thieves may claim Among themselves.âAnd so ran on thro' such A catalogue of littlenesses, I For deafest shame had even stopped my ears But that my wrists were lockt. And when he came To his confession of his lie at court, By which was gained our knightly sympathy And valiant service on this fools' crusade, I seemed to feel the redness of my blush Soak thro' my very soul. There I brake in: âFair lady and most gallant,âto my shame Do I admit we have been duped by such An ingrate as this bundled lump of flesh That I am helpless to rise up and spurn: Unbind me, and I promise such amends As knightly hands may deign to wreak upon A thing so vile as he.â Then, laughing, she: âFirst tell me, by your honor, where await Your knightly brothers and my enemies.â To which I answered, truthfully, I knew Not where you lingered, but not close at hand I was assured. Then all abrupt, she turned: âGet every one within! We ride at once!â And scarce a dozen minutes ere they came Outpouring from the cave in such a guise As made me smile from very wonderment.â From head to heel in woman's dress they came, Clad richly, too, and trapped and tricked withal As maidenly, but in the face and hand, As ever damsels flock at holiday. Then were their chargers bro't, caparisoned In keeping; and they mounted, lifting us, Still bounden, with much jest and mockery Of soft caress and wanton blandishments, As tho' they were of sex their dress declared. And so they carried us until they came Upon the road there as it nicks the copse; And so drew rein, dismounted, leaving some To guard their horses; hurried us across This footway to the middle of the flat. Here Raelus was bounden to a tree, Stript to the waist; my fetters cut, and then A long, keen switch put in my hand, and âStrike! Strike as all duty bids youâ said the queen. And so I did, with right good will at first; Till, softened as I heard the wretch's prayers Of anguish, I at last withheld my hand. âWhat tiring?â chirpt the queen: âGive me the stick!â And swish, and swish, and mercy how it rained! Then all the others, forming circlewise, Danced round and round the howling wretch, and jeered And japed at him, and mocked and scoffed at him, And spat upon him. And I turned away And hid my face; then raised it pleadingly: Nor would they listen my appeal for him; But left him so, and thonged and took me back Across the mere, and drew the bridge, that none Might go to him, and carried me with them Far on their way, and freed me once again; And back I turned, tho' loath, to succor him.â And even as he ceased they heard the wail Break out anew, and crossed without a word, And Raelus they found, and without word They loosed him. And he brake away and ran As runs a lie the truth is hard upon. Thus did it fare with Raelus. And they Who knew of it said naught at court of it, Nor from that day spake ever of him once, Nor heard of him again, nor cared to hear. A MOTHER-SONG Mother, O mother! forever I cry for you, Sing the old song I may never forget; Even in slumber I murmur and sigh for you.â Mother, O mother, Sing low, âLittle brother, Sleep, for thy mother bends over thee yet!â Mother, O mother! the years are so lonely, Filled but with weariness, doubt and regret! Can't you come back to meâfor to-night only, Mother, my mother, And sing, âLittle brother, Sleep, for thy mother bends over thee yet!â Mother, O mother! of old I had never One wish denied me, nor trouble to fret; Nowâmust I cry out all vainly forever,â Mother, sweet mother, O sing, âLittle brother, Sleep, for thy mother bends over thee yet!â Mother, O mother! must longing and sorrow Leave me in darkness, with eyes ever wet, And never the hope of a meeting to-morrow? Answer me, mother, And sing, âLittle brother, Sleep, for thy mother bends over thee yet!â THE LOST PATH Alone they walkedâtheir fingers knit together, And swaying listlessly as might a swing Wherein Dan Cupid dangled in the weather Of some sun-flooded afternoon of Spring. Within the clover-fields the tickled cricket Laughed lightly as they loitered down the lane, And from the covert of the hazel-thicket The squirrel peeped and laughed at them again. The bumblebee that tipped the lily-vases Along the roadside in the shadows dim, Went following the blossoms of their faces As though their sweets must needs be shared with him. Between the pasture bars the wondering cattle Stared wistfully, and from their mellow bells Shook out a welcoming whose dreamy rattle Fell swooningly away in faint farewells. And though at last the gloom of night fell o'er them, And folded all the landscape from their eyes, They only knew the dusky path before them Was leading safely on to Paradise. MY BRIDE THAT IS TO BE O soul of mine, look out and see My bride, my bride that is to be!â Reach out with mad, impatient hands, And draw aside futurity As one might draw a veil asideâ And so unveil her where she stands Madonna-like and glorifiedâ The queen of undiscovered lands Of love, to where she beckons meâ My bride, my bride that is to be. The shadow of a willow-tree That wavers on a garden-wall In summer-time may never fall In attitude as gracefully As my fair bride that is to be;â Nor ever Autumn's leaves of brown As lightly flutter to the lawn As fall her fairy-feet upon The path of love she loiters down.â O'er drops of dew she walks, and yet Not one may stain her sandal wetâ Ay, she might dance upon the way Nor crush a single drop to spray, So airy-like she seems to me,â My bride, my bride that is to be. I know not if her eyes are light As summer skies or dark as night,â I only know that they are dim With mystery: In vain I peer To make their hidden meaning clear, While o'er their surface, like a tear That ripples to the silken brim, A look of longing seems to swim All worn and weary-like to me; And then, as suddenly, my sight Is blinded with a smile so bright, Through folded lids I still may see My bride, my bride that is to be. Her face is like a night of June Upon whose brow the crescent-moon Hangs pendent in a diadem Of stars, with envy lighting them.â And, like a wild cascade, her hair Floods neck and shoulder, arm and wrist, Till only through a gleaming mist I seem to see a Siren there, With lips of love and melody And open arms and heaving breast Wherein I fling myself to rest, The while my heart cries hopelessly For my fair bride that is to be. Nay, foolish heart and blinded eyes! My bride hath need of no disguise.â But, rather, let her come to me In such a form as bent above My pillow when, in infancy, I knew not anything but love.â O let her come from out the lands Of Womanhoodânot fairy isles,â And let her come with Woman's hands And Woman's eyes of tears and smiles,â With Woman's hopefulness and grace Of patience lighting up her face: And let her diadem be wrought Of kindly deed and prayerful thought, That ever over all distress May beam the light of cheerfulness.â And let her feet be brave to fare The labyrinths of doubt and care, That, following, my own may find The path to Heaven God designed.â O let her come like this to meâ My brideâmy bride that is to be. LULLABY The maple strews the embers of its leaves O'er the laggard swallows nestled 'neath the eaves; And the moody cricket falters in his cryâBaby-bye!â And the lid of night is falling o'er the skyâBaby-bye!â The lid of night is falling o'er the sky! The rose is lying pallid, and the cup Of the frosted calla-lily folded up; And the breezes through the garden sob and sighâBaby-bye!â O'er the sleeping blooms of Summer where they lieâBaby-bye!â O'er the sleeping blooms of summer where they lie! Yet, BabyâO my Baby, for your sake This heart of mine is ever wide awake, And my love may never droop a drowsy eyeâBaby-bye!â Till your own are wet above me when I dieâBaby-bye!â Till your own are wet above me when I die. THE ROMAUNT OF KING MORDAMEER Ho! did ye hear of Mordameer, The King of Slumberland! A lotus-crown upon his browâ A poppy in his hand, And all the elves that people dreams To bow at his command. His throne is wrought of blackest night, Enriched with rare designs Wherein the blazing comet runs And writhes and wreaths and twines About a crescent angel-face That ever smiling shines. The dais is of woven rays Of starlight fringed with shade, And jeweled o'er with gems of dew, And dyed and interlaid With every gleaming tint and hue Of which the flowers are made. And when the day has died away In darkness o'er the land, The King bends down his dusky face And takes the sleeper's hand, And lightly o'er his folded eyes He waves his magic wand. And lo! within his princely home, Upon his downy bed, With soft and silken coverlets And curtains round him spread, The rich man rolls in troubled sleep, And moans in restless dread: His eyes are closed, yet Mordameer May see their stony stare As plainly fixed in agony As though the orbs were bare And glaring at the wizard throng That fills the empty air:â A thousand shapes, with phantom japes, Dance o'er the sleeper's sight,â With fingers bony-like and lean, And faces pinched and white, And withered cheeks, and sunken eyes With ever-ravening sight. And such the dreams that Mordameer Brings to the child of Pride,â The worn and wasted forms that he Hath stinted and deniedâ Of those who filled his coffers up And empty-handed died. And then again he waves his wand: And from his lair of straw The felon, with his fettered limbs, Starts up with fear and awe, And stares with starting eyes upon A vision of the law: A grim procession passes by, The while he glares in fearâ With faces, from a wanton's smile Down to a demon's leer,â The woman marching at the front, The hangman at the rear. All ways are clear to Mordameer: The ocean knows his tread; His feet are free on land or sea:â Above the sailor's head He hangs a dream of home, and bends Above his cottage-bed: And, nestled in the mother's arms, A child, surpassing fair, In slumber lies, its tiny hands Entangled in her hair, And round its face a smile that moves Its lips as though in prayer. And lo! the good king feasts its eyes With fruits from foreign shores, And pink-lipped shells that ever mock The ocean as it roars; And in the mother's arms he folds The form that she adores. Through all the hovels of the poor He steals with noiseless tread, And presses kisses o'er and o'er Where sorrow's tears are shed, Till old caresses live once more That are forever dead. Above the soldier in his tent Are glorious battles fought; And o'er the prince's velvet couch, And o'er the peasant's cot, And o'er the pallet of disease His wondrous spells are wrought. He bends him o'er the artist's cot, And fills his dazzled mind With airy forms that float about Like clouds in summer wind, O'er landscapes that the angels wrought And God Himself designed. And drifting through the poet's dreams The seraph trails her wings, And fills the chancels of his soul With heavenly whisperings, Till, swooning with delight, he hears The song he never sings. He walks the wide world's every way, This monarch grand and grim; All paths that reach the human heart, However faint and dim, He journeys, for the darkest night Is light as day to him. And thus the lordly Mordameer Rules o'er his mystic realm, With gems from out the star's red core To light his diadem, And kings and emperors to kneel And kiss his garment's hem. For once, upon a night of dreams, Adown the aisles of space I strayed so far that I forgot Mine own abiding-place, And wandered into Slumberland, And met him face to face. DEARTH I hold your trembling hand to-nightâand yet I may not know what wealth of bliss is mine, My heart is such a curious design Of trust and jealousy! Your eyes are wetâ So must I think they jewel some regret,â And lo, the loving arms that round me twine Cling only as the tendrils of a vine Whose fruit has long been gathered: I forget, While crimson clusters of your kisses press Their wine out on my lips, my royal fare Of rapture, since blind fancy needs must guess They once poured out their sweetness otherwhere, With fuller flavoring of happiness Than e'en your broken sobs may now declare. THE SONG I NEVER SING As when in dreams we sometimes hear A melody so faint and fine And musically sweet and clear, It flavors all the atmosphere With harmony divine,â So, often in my waking dreams, I hear a melody that seems Like fairy voices whispering To me the song I never sing. Sometimes when brooding o'er the years My lavish youth has thrown awayâ When all the glowing past appears But as a mirage that my tears Have crumbled to decay,â I thrill to find the ache and pain Of my remorse is stilled again, As, forward bent and listening, I hear the song I never sing. A murmuring of rhythmic words, Adrift on tunes whose currents flow Melodious with the trill of birds, And far-off lowing of the herds In lands of long ago; And every sound the truant loves Comes to me like the coo of doves When first in blooming fields of Spring I heard the song I never sing. The echoes of old voices, wound In limpid streams of laughter where The river Time runs bubble-crowned, And giddy eddies ripple round The lilies growing there; Where roses, bending o'er the brink, Drain their own kisses as they drink, And ivies climb and twine and cling About the song I never sing. An ocean-surge of sound that falls As though a tide of heavenly art Had tempested the gleaming halls And crested o'er the golden walls In showers on my heart. ... Thusâthus, with open arms and eyes Uplifted toward the alien skies, Forgetting every earthly thing, I hear the song I never sing. O nameless lay, sing clear and strong, Pour down thy melody divine Till purifying floods of song Have washed away the stains of wrong That dim this soul of mine! O woo me near and nearer thee, Till my glad lips may catch the key, And, with a voice unwavering, Join in the song I never sing. UNSPOKEN O he can hold her hand, and full and fair Look in her face and fling her smile for smile, And loosen from his lips such words the while As make him wonder how his tongue may dare Such dalliance. And when in wordless prayer His heart lies gasping, he can reconcile His talk to that glib, recitative style The silly gossip chatters everywhere. But O, one utteranceâone stormy word Is fastened down in silence pitiless; No struggling murmur of it ever heardâ No echo welling out of his distress To plead aloud its mission long deferred, And leap up fountain-like in thankfulness. Yet he is bold enough in dreamsâlast night He held her in his arms, and in the strands Of her down-streaming hair he bathed his hands, And fretted it in golden foam as bright And billowy it floated o'er his sight. Her breath was like a breeze of fairy-lands That reels above a bed of bloom and fans Its fragrant life away in sheer delight. So even did he whisper through the sighs That quavered as his spirit stayed to drain The mad intoxication of her eyes; Then felt a pang of pleasure keen as painâ A barb of ecstasy, shot arrow-wise, In such a kiss as cleft his heart in twain. But waking, when the morning of her face Shines full upon him, voiceless has he grown, Save that inanimately mirthful tone That ripples ever on its foolish race And finds nor rest nor joyance in the chase. And so it is a never-ending moan Wails on unheard, unheeded and unknown But by the echoes of its hiding-place. What poverty like this?âto laugh, and sing, And babble like a brook in summer-time; To circle o'er the world on airy wing, Or clamber into Heaven on rounds of rhyme, When in the soul, forever lingering, There lives a love unspeakably sublime. THANKSGIVING DAY AT HUNCHLEY'S If you never heard of Hunchley, I would say in his behalf, He's as jovial a bachelor as ever raised a laugh, And as fond of boon companions, yet withal as tried and true A gentleman of honor as the writer ever knew. And if he has a weakness, as a weakness it depends On a certain strength of kindness he bestows upon his friends; Being simple, undesigning, and of courteous address, All hearts are open to him and his friends are numberless. And this is how it happened some discrepancies befell At the late Thanksgiving dinner which began at his hotel, Where, it seems, the guests invited were selected more to be In keeping with his bounty than the laws of harmony. For there among the number were two rivals of the press, Who had paragraphed each other with prolonged maliciousness, And in their respective columns had a thousand times declared That the other fellow âdaresn't,â when the other fellow dared. And cheek by jowl together were two members of the bar, Politically, legally, and socially at war, Who denounced each other daily, and in every local phrase That could make the matter binding all the balance of their days. Of the medical fraternity (âfraternityâ is good) There were four or five disciples of the healing brotherhoodâ Botanic and eclectic, and some others that persist In orthographic wranglings, such as âhomeopathistâ; And an ordinary actor, and an actor of renown, Whose cue, it seemed, for smiling was the other actor's frown; And the most loquacious author my remembrance can recall, And a little bench-leg poet that couldn't talk at all. In fact the guests assembled, as they gathered round the feast Wore expressions such as savored not of thankfulness the least, And to a close observer were suggestive of the dread And shadowy disaster that was hanging overhead. Now the simple Mr. Hunchley had invited, with the rest, A melancholy pastor, and, in honor of the guest And the notable occasion, he desired a special âgrace,â Which the thankful pastor offered with a very thankless face. And at this unhappy juncture came a journalistic pun, Which the rival designated as a most atrocious one, At which the grim projector, with a covert look of hate, Shook a little dust of âfine-cutâ in the other fellow's plate. And the viands circulated, with a sudden gust of wit From a lawyerâinstituted for the other's benefit,â Then the victim spun a story with exasperating mirth That reflected his opponent as of small judicial worth. Then a medical discussion on the stomach swelled the gale And the literary appetite began to droop and fail; While a sportive reminiscence from the absented-minded host Blanched the features of the pastor to the pallor of a ghost. And a deep sonorous murmur slowly grew, and grew, and grew Till the similes that suited it were singularly few,â For even now at leisure, and with nothing else to do, A task of lesser promise I can say I never knew. I have heard the tread of armies as they marched upon the foe, And, among the Alps, have listened to the avalanche of snow; I have leaned upon Niagara, and heard the wailing tide Where it leaps its awful chasm in unending suicide: I have heard the trampling footsteps of the roaring hurricane As he lashed his tail of lightning, and tossed his shaggy mane; I have heard the cannonading of the devastating storm, And the falling politician howling loudly for reform: But no mystic voice of terror ever bred of Nature's law Could awake the sense of wonder and dismay, and doubt and awe That thrilled my inmost being as the conversation swelled To a mad, chaotic focus in which everybody yelled. There's a vision in my fancy, misty-like and undefined, Of an actor with his collar loose and sticking up behind, And another (though I hesitate to chronicle the fact) Writhing underneath the table in a wild contortion act. There's a shadowy remembrance of a group of three or four Who were seemingly dissecting another on the floor; And the form of Mr. Hunchley dancing round a couple more, And a phantom with a chicken-leg a-breaking for the door. And here my memory waversâI recall the heated breath Of the gentleman who held me with the very grip of death, And as my reeling pencil scrawls the scene of my release I'm as full of glad thanksgiving as my soul is full of peace. But this is how it happened these discrepancies befell At the late Thanksgiving dinner Hunchley gave at his hotel, Where, it seems, the guests invited were selected more to be In keeping with his bounty than the laws of harmony. APART I They stood on either side the gateâ Though fastened with the hands of fate A touch might lift the latch's weight. The moonlight, with a faded grace, Fell o'er the whiteness of her face Like some soiled veil of bridal lace. The fan she held went fluttering About her mouth on restless wing As though it were a wounded thing. And in her breast an ache of dread Held back the word she would have said, And sent a weary sigh instead. II He waited, with his eager eyes Half muffled in a weak disguise Of carelessness and cold surprise. Within his breast he heard the moan: âHow desolate and all alone, And pitiless my heart has grown!â And yet a nameless ache of dread Held back the word he would have said, And sent a weary sigh instead. The long, black shadows of the trees Whose branches wavered in the breeze, Fell o'er them like their destinies. They parted. Yet the wild wind saith That two fair ghosts with failing breath Walk hand in hand the path of death. TOIL He had toiled away for a weary while, Through day's dull glare and night's deep gloom; And many a long and lonesome mile He had paced in the round of his dismal room; He had fared on hungerâhad drunk of pain As the drouthy earth might drink of rain; And the brow he leaned in his trembling palm Throbbed with a misery so intense That never again did it seem that calm Might come to him with the gracious balm Of old-time languor and indolence. And he said, âI will leave the tale half told, And leave the song for the winds to sing; And the penâthat pitiless blade of gold That stabs my heart like a dagger-stingâ I will drive to the hilt through the inkstand's top And spill its blood to the last black drop!â Then he masked his voice with a laugh, and went Out in the world with a lawless graceâ With a brazen lie in his eyes and face Told in a smile of glad content: He roved the round of pleasures through, And tasted each as it pleased him to; He joined old songs, and the clink and din Of the revelers at the banquet hall; And he tripped his feet where the violin Spun its waltz for the carnival; He looked, bedazed, on the luring wile And the siren-light of a woman's smile, And peered in her eyes as a diver might Peer in the sea ere he leaps outright,â Caught his breath, with a glance above, And dropped full-length in the depths of love. 'Tis well if ever the false lights die On the alien coasts where our wreck'd hopes lie! 'Tis well to feel, through the blinding rain, Our outflung hands touch earth again! So the castaway came, safe from doom, Back at last to his lonely room, Filled with its treasure of work to do And radiant with the light and bloom Of the summer sun and his glad soul, too! And sweet as ever the song of birds, Over his work he sand these words:â âO friends are good, with their princely ways, And royal hearts they are goodly things; And fellowship, in the long dark days When the drear soul cowers with drooping wings, Is a thing to yearn for.âMirth is good,â For a ringing laugh is a rhythmic cry Blown like a hail from the Angelhood To the barque of the lone soul drifting by.â Goodly, too, is a mute caress Of woman's hands and their tendernessâ The warm breath wet with the dews of loveâ The vine-like arms, and the fruit thereofâ The touch that thrills, and the kiss that melts,â But Toil is sweeter than all things else.â HIS ROOM I'm home again, my dear old Room, I'm home again, and happy, too, As, peering through the brightening gloom, I find myself alone with you: Though brief my stay, nor far away, I missed youâmissed you night and dayâ As wildly yearned for you as now.â Old Room, how are you, anyhow? My easy chair, with open arms, Awaits me just within the door; The littered carpet's woven charms Have never seemed so bright before,â The old rosettes and mignonettes And ivy-leaves and violets, Look up as pure and fresh of hue As though baptized in morning-dew. Old Room, to me your homely walls Fold round me like the arms of love, And over all my being falls A blessing pure as from aboveâ Even as a nestling child caressed And lulled upon a loving breast, With folded eyes, too glad to weep And yet too sad for dreams or sleep. You've been so kind to me, old Roomâ So patient in your tender care, My drooping heart in fullest bloom Has blossomed for you unaware; And who but you had cared to woo A heart so dark, and heavy too, As in the past you lifted mine From out the shadow to the shine? For I was but a wayward boy When first you gladly welcomed me And taught me work was truer joy Than rioting incessantly: And thus the din that stormed within The old guitar and violin Has fallen in a fainter tone And sweeter, for your sake alone. Though in my absence I have stood In festal halls a favored guest, I missed, in this old quietude, My worthy work and worthy restâ By this I know that long ago You loved me first, and told me so In art's mute eloquence of speech The voice of praise may never reach. For lips and eyes in truth's disguise Confuse the faces of my friends, Till old affection's fondest ties I find unraveling at the ends; But, as I turn to you, and learn To meet my griefs with less concern, Your love seems all I have to keep Me smiling lest I needs must weep. Yet I am happy, and would fain Forget the world and all its woes; So set me to my tasks again, Old Room, and lull me to repose: And as we glide adown the tide Of dreams, forever side by side, I'll hold your hands as lovers do Their sweethearts' and talk love to you. TO LEONAINIE In memory of Leonainie, infant daughter of W. B. and Lotta Titus, these lines are tenderly inscribed. âLeonainie!â angels missed herâ Baby angelsâthey Who behind the stars had kissed her E'er she came away; And their little, wandering faces Drooped o'er Heaven's hiding-places Wither than the lily-vases On the Sabbath day. âLeonainie!â crying, crying, Crying through the night, Till her lisping lips replying, Laughing with delight, Drew us nearer yet, and nearer That we might the better hear her Baby-words, and love her dearer Hearing not aright. Only spake the little lisper In the Angel-tongue, Fainter than a fairy-whisper Murmured in among Dewy blossoms covered over With the fragrant tufts of clover, Where the minstrel honey-rover Twanged his wings and sung. âLeonainie!ââAnd the glimmer Of her starry eyes Faded, and the world grew dimmer E'en as Paradise Blossomed with a glory brighter Than the waning stars, and whiter Than the dying moon, and lighter Than the morning skies. THE SHOWER The landscape, like the awed face of a child Grew curiously blurred; a hush of death Fell on the fields, and in the darkened wild The zephyr held its breath. No wavering glamour-work of light and shade Dappled the shivering surface of the brook; The frightened ripples in their ambuscade Of willows trilled and shook. The sullen day grew darker, and anon Dim flashes of pent anger lit the sky; With rumbling wheels of wrath came rolling on The storm's artillery. The cloud above put on its blackest frown, And then, as with a vengeful cry of pain, The lightning snatched it, ripped and flung it down In raveled shreds of rain: While I, transfigured by some wondrous art, Bowed with the thirsty lilies to the sod, My empty soul brimmed over, and my heart Drenched with the love of God. YE SCHOLAR Ho! ho! Ye Scholar recketh not how lean His lank frame waxeth in ye hectic gloom That smeareth o'er ye dim walls of his room His wavering shadow! Shut is he, I ween, Like as a withered nosegay, in between Ye musty, mildewed leaves of some volume Of ancient lore ye moth and he consume In jointure. Yet a something in his mien Forbids all mockery, though quaint is he, And eke fantastical in form and face As that Old Knight ye Tale of Chivalry Made mad immortally, yet spared ye grace Of some rare virtue which we sigh to see, And pour our laughter out most tenderly. DEATH IS DEAD And did you know our old friend Death is dead? Ah me! he died last night; my ghost was there, And all his phantom-friends from everywhere Were sorrowfully grouped about his bed. âI die; God help the living now!â he said With such a ghastly pathos, I declare The tears oozed from the blind eyes of the air And spattered on his face in gouts of red. And then he smiledâthe dear old bony smile That glittered on us in that crazy whim When first our daring feet leapt the defile Of life and ran so eagerly to him: And so he smiled upon us, even while The kind old sockets grew forever dim. TOM JOHNSON'S QUIT Apassel o' the boys last nightâ An' me amongst 'emâkind o' got To talkin' Temper'nce left an' right, An' workin' up âblue-ribbon,â hot; An' while we was a-countin' jes' How many hed gone into hit An' signed the pledge, some feller says,â âTom Johnson's quit!â We laughed, of courseâ'cause Tom, you know, Has spiled more whisky, boy an' man, And seed more trouble, high an' low, Than any chap but Tom could stand: And so, says I, âHe's too nigh dead Fer Temper'nce to benefit!â The feller sighed ag'in, and saidâ âTom Johnson's quit!â We all liked Tom, an' that was why We sort o' simmered down ag'in, And ast the feller ser'ously Ef he wa'n't tryin' to draw us in: He shuck his headâtuck off his hatâ Helt up his hand an' opened hit, An' says, says he, âI'll swear to thatâ Tom Johnson's quit!â Well, we was stumpt, an' tickled, too,â Because we knowed ef Tom hed signed There wa'n't no man 'at wore the âblueâ 'At was more honester inclined: An' then and there we kind o' riz,â The hull dern gang of us 'at bitâ An' th'owed our hats and let 'er whiz,â âTom Johnson's quit!â I've heerd 'em holler when the balls Was buzzin' 'round us wus'n bees, An' when the ole flag on the walls Was flappin' o'er the enemy's, I've heerd a-many a wild âhoorayâ 'At made my heart git up an' gitâ But Lord!âto hear 'em shout that way!â âTom Johnson's quit!â But when we saw the chap 'at fetched The news wa'n't jinin' in the cheer, But stood there solemn-like, an' reched An' kind o' wiped away a tear, We someway sort o' stilled ag'in, And listenedâI kin hear him yit, His voice a-wobblin' with his chin,â âTom Johnson's quitâ âI hain't a-givin' you no gameâ I wisht I was! ... An hour ago, This operatorâwhat's his nameâ The one 'at works at night, you know?â Went out to flag that Ten Express, And sees a man in front of hit Th'ow up his hands an' staggerâyes,â Tom Johnson's quit!â THE LITTLE DEAD MAN YET NOT SO DEAD AS ANOTHER I It was a little dead man, At peace with all the earth; Yet I never saw a dead man So seeming near to mirth. His hands were meekly hidden, At his very last requestâ The right in his hip pocket, And the other in his vest. His collar was thrown open, And he wore his easy clothesâ Had his ordinary boots on, With rosin on the toes. II And so the little dead man Lay coffined for the tomb. The hearse was at the doorwayâ The mourners in the roomâ When suddenly a stranger, Who had called the day before With a book beneath his elbow, Entered softly at the door, And stood before the mourners In his bold and brazen might, A note-book in the left hand And a pencil in the right. And he turned him to the mourners With a business air, and said: âI must really beg your pardon, But the gentleman that's dead âWas kind enough to tell me, If I'd call around to-day He'd be prepared to listen To all I had to say. âAnd in view of that engagement, I would gently intimate (As it may pitch the funeral Some dozen hours late,) âThat you have my indulgence,â And with eyelids downward thrown, They left the little dead man And the agent all alone. As only stars may lighten Up the grandeur of the plains, And the mountains where the midnight In her mystic beauty reigns, So the stars must shed their glory O'er imagination's vales, And illuminate the story Where the poet's pencil fails. But there was a little dead manâ Ah! so very dead indeed, They fastened down his coffin lid With most judicious speed. And they whose latest office Was to shroud his form from sight, Saw a note-book in the left hand, And a pencil in the right. OLD-FASHIONED ROSES They ain't no style about 'em, And they're sort o' pale and faded Yit the doorway here, without 'em, Would be lonesomer, and shaded With a good 'eal blacker shadder Than the morning-glories makes, And the sunshine would look sadder Fer their good old-fashion' sakes. I like 'em 'cause they kind o' Sort o' make a feller like 'em! And I tell you, when I find a Bunch out whur the sun kin strike 'em, It allus sets me thinkin' O' the ones 'at used to grow And peek in through the chinkin' O' the cabin, don't you know! And then I think o' mother, And how she ust to love 'emâ When they wuzn't any other, 'Less she found 'em up above 'em! And her eyes, afore she shut 'em, Whispered with a smile and said We must pick a bunch and putt 'em In her hand when she wuz dead. But, as I wuz a-sayin', They ain't no style about 'em Very gaudy er displayin', But I wouldn't be without 'em,â 'Cause I'm happier in these posies, And hollyhawks and sich, Than the hummin'-bird 'at noses In the roses of the rich. THE EMPTY SONG âWhat have we but an empty song?â Said the minstrel, as he bent To stay the fingers that trailed along The strings of her instrument. âThe clasp of your hand is warm in mine, And your breath on my brow is wetâ I have drunk of your lips as men drink wine, But my heart is thirsty yet.â The starlight shivered a little space, And the sigh of the wind uprose And blew a cloud o'er the moon's wan face, And swooned back in repose. The years ooze on in a stagnant flood: One drifts as the winds allow; And one writes rhymes with his heart's own blood, But his soul is thirsty now. A ROSE IN OCTOBER An Imitation of Magazine Poetry I I strayed, all alone, where the Autumn Had swept, in her petulant wrath: All the flowers, that had bloomed in the garden, She had gathered, and flung in her path. And I saw the dead face of the lily, Struck down, by the rain and the sleet, And the pink, with her lashes yet weeping, Drooped low in the dust, at my feet. II The leaves on the branches still swinging, Were blanched with the crimson of death; And the vines that still clung to the trellis, Were palsied, and shook at a breath. And I sighed: âSo hath fate, like the Autumn, Swept over my path, till I see, As I walk through life's desolate garden Not a rose is left blooming for me!â III âHeigho!â said a voice of low laughterâ âHow blind are you poets!â And there, At the gate, just in front of me, leaning, Stood Rosalind May, I declare! I stammered, confused, for the moment; But was blest for the rest of my life, For my Rose of October there promised She'd bloom for me aye, asâmy wife. ROMANCIN' I'b'en a-kindo' âmusin',â as the feller says, and I'm About o' the conclusion that they hain't no better time, When you come to cipher on it, than the times we ust to know When we swore our first âdog-gone-itâ sorto' solum-like and low! You git my idy, do you?âLittle tads, you understandâ Jest a-wishin' thue and thue you that you on'y wuz a man.â Yit here I am, this minit, even sixty, to a day, And fergittin' all that's in it, wishin' jest the other way! I hain't no hand to lectur' on the times, er dimonstrate Whare the trouble is, er hector and domineer with Fate,â But when I git so flurried, and so pestered-like and blue, And so rail owdacious worried, let me tell you what I do!â I jest gee-haw the hosses, and onhook the swingle-tree, Whare the hazel-bushes tosses down theyr shadders over me; And I draw my plug o' navy, and I climb the fence, and set Jest a-thinkin' here, i gravy! tel my eyes is wringin'-wet! Tho' I still kin see the trouble o' the presunt, I kin seeâ Kindo' like my sight wuz doubleâall the things that ust to be; And the flutter o' the robin and the teeter o' the wren Sets the willer-branches bobbin' âhowdy-doâ thum Now to Then! The deadnin' and the thicket's jest a-bilin' full of June, Thum the rattle o' the cricket, to the yallar-hammer's tune; And the catbird in the bottom, and the sapsuck on the snag, Seems ef they can'tâod-rot 'em!âjest do nothin' else but brag! They's music in the twitter of the bluebird and the jay, And that sassy little critter jest a-peckin' all the day; They's music in the âflicker,â and they's music in the thrush, And they's music in the snicker o' the chipmunk in the brush! They's music all around me!âAnd I go back, in a dream Sweeter yit than ever found me fast asleep,âand in the stream That ust to split the medder whare the dandylions growed, I stand knee-deep, and redder than the sunset down the road. Then's when I' b'en a-fishin'!âAnd they's other fellers, too, With theyr hick'ry-poles a-swishin' out behind 'em; and a few Little âshinersâ on our stringers, with theyr tails tiptoein' bloom, As we dance 'em in our fingers all the happy jurney home. I kin see us, true to Natur', thum the time we started out, With a biscuit and a 'tater in our little âround-aboutâ!â I kin see our lines a-tanglin', and our elbows in a jam, And our naked legs a-danglin' thum the apern o' the dam. I kin see the honeysuckle climbin' up around the mill, And kin hear the worter chuckle, and the wheel a-growlin' still; And thum the bank below it I kin steal the old canoe, And jest git in and row it like the miller ust to do. W'y, I git my fancy focused on the past so mortul plane I kin even smell the locus'-blossoms bloomin' in the lane; And I hear the cow-bells clinkin' sweeter tunes 'n âMoney-muskâ Fer the lightnin'-bugs a-blinkin' and a-dancin' in the dusk. And when I've kep' on âmusin',â as the feller says, tel I'm Firm-fixed in the conclusion that they hain't no better time, When you come to cipher on it, than the old times,âI de-clare I kin wake and say âdog-gone-it!â jest as soft as any prayer! THE LITTLE OLD POEM THAT NOBODY READS The little old poem that nobody reads Blooms in a crowded space, Like a ground-vine blossom, so low in the weeds That nobody sees its faceâ Unless, perchance, the reader's eye Stares through a yawn, and hurries by, For no one wants, or loves, or heeds The little old poem that nobody reads. The little old poem that nobody reads Was writtenâwhere?âand when? Maybe a hand of goodly deeds Thrilled as it held the pen: Maybe the fountain whence it came Was a heart brimmed o'er with tears of shame, And maybe its creed is the worst of creedsâ The little old poem that nobody reads. But, little old poem that nobody reads, Holding you here above The wound of a heart that warmly bleeds For all that knows not love, I well believe if the old World knew As dear a friend as I find in you, That friend would tell it that all it needs Is the little old poem that nobody reads. A SLEEPING BEAUTY I An alien wind that blew and blew Over the fields where the ripe grain grew, Sending ripples of shine and shade That crept and crouched at her feet and played. The sea-like summer washed the moss Till the sun-drenched lilies hung like floss, Draping the throne of green and gold That lulled her there like a queen of old. II Was it the hum of a bumblebee, Or the long-hushed bugle eerily Winding a call to the daring Prince Lost in the wood long ages since?â A dim old wood, with a palace rare Hidden away in its depths somewhere! Was it the Princess, tranced in sleep, Awaiting her lover's touch to leap Into the arms that bent above?â To thaw his heart with the breath of loveâ And cloy his lips, through her waking tears, With the dead-ripe kiss of a hundred years! III An alien wind that blew and blew.â I had blurred my eyes as the artists do, Coaxing life to a half-sketched face, Or dreaming bloom for a grassy place. The bee droned on in an undertone; And a shadow-bird trailed all alone Across the wheat, while a liquid cry Dripped from above, as it went by. What to her was the far-off whir Of the quail's quick wing or the chipmunk's chirr?â What to her was the shade that slid Over the hill where the reapers hid?â Or what the hunter, with one foot raised, As he turned to goâyet, pausing, gazed? LEEDLE DUTCH BABY Leedle Dutch baby haff come ter town! Jabber und jump till der day gone downâ Jabber und sphlutter und sphlit hees jawsâ Vot a Dutch baby dees Londsmon vas!

LINES ON HEARING A COW BAWL IN A DEEP FIT OF DEJECTION ON THE EVENING OF JULY 3, A. D. 1879 Portentous sound! mysteriously vast And awful in the grandeur of refrain That lifts the listener's hair as it swells past, And pours in turbid currents down the lane. The small boy at the wood-pile, in a dream Slow trails the meat-rind o'er the listless saw; The chickens roosting o'er him on the beam Uplift their drowsy heads with cootered awe. The âgung-oigh!â of the pump is strangely stilled: The smoke-house door bangs once emphatic'ly, Then bangs no more, but leaves the silence filled With one lorn plaint's despotic minstrelsy. Yet I would join thy sorrowing madrigal, Most melancholy cow, and sing of thee Full-hearted through my tears, for, after all, 'Tis very kine in you to sing for me. FRIEND OF A WAYWARD HOUR Friend of a wayward hour, you came Like some good ghost, and went the same; And I within the haunted place Sit smiling on your vanished face, And talking withâyour name. But thrice the pressure of your handâ First hailâcongratulationsâand Your last âGod bless you!â as the train That brought you snatched you back again Into the unknown land. âGod bless me?â Why, your very prayer Was answered ere you asked it there, I knowâfor when you came to lend Me your kind hand, and call me friend, God blessed me unaware. LINES ON RECEIVING A PRESENT FROM AN UNKNOWN FRIEND Thou little naked statuette, With fairy head a-tip, And eyelids ever downward let, And silence on thy lip, Thou comest from a friend unknown, Nor wilt confess, E'en in mute syllables of stone, That friend's address. And so, still pools of gratitude I pour out at thy feet; And could it mirror back thy nude Perfection half as sweet As rests within this heart of mine That friend unknown, Why, smiles would light that face of thine And warm the stone. PAN This Pan is but an idle god, I guess, Since all the fair midsummer of my dreams He loiters listlessly by woody streams, Soaking the lush glooms up with laziness; Or drowsing while the maiden-winds caress Him prankishly, and powder him with gleams Of sifted sunshine. And he ever seems Drugged with a joy unutterableâunless His low pipes whistle hints of it far out Across the ripples to the dragon-fly That, like a wind-born blossom blown about, Drops quiveringly down, as though to dieâ Then lifts and wavers on, as if in doubt Whether to fan his wings or fly without. WHEN OUR BABY DIED When our baby diedâ My Ma she ist cried an' cried! Yes 'n' my Pa he cried, tooâ An' I criedâAn' me an' you.â An' I 'tended like my doll She cried tooâAn' ever'âallâ O ist ever'body cried When our baby died! When our baby diedâ Nen I got to took a ride! An' we all ist rode an' rode Clean to Heav'n where baby goedâ Mighty nigh!âAn' nen Ma she Cried ag'inâan' Paâan' me.â All but ist the Angels cried When our baby died! A FULL HARVEST Seems like a feller'd ort'o jes' to-day Git down and roll and waller, don't you know, In that-air stubble, and flop up and crow, Seein' sich crops! I'll undertake to say There're no wheat's ever turned out thataway Afore this season!âFolks is keerless, though, And too fergitfulâ'caze we'd ort'o show More thankfulness!âJes' looky hyonder, hey?â And watch that little reaper wadin' thue That last old yaller hunk o' harvest-groundâ Jes natchur'ly a-slicin' it in two Like honeycomb, and gaumin' it around The fieldâlike it had nothin' else to do On'y jes' waste it all on me and you! MY BACHELOR CHUM A corpulent man is my bachelor chum, With a neck apoplectic and thickâ An abdomen on him as big as a drum, And a fist big enough for the stick; With a walk that for grace is clear out of the case, And a wobble uncertainâas though His little bow-legs had forgotten the pace That in youth used to favor him so. He is forty, at least; and the top of his head Is a bald and a glittering thing; And his nose and his two chubby cheeks are as red As three rival roses in spring: His mouth is a grin with the corners tucked in, And his laugh is so breezy and bright That it ripples his features and dimples his chin With a billowy look of delight. He is fond of declaring he âdon't care a strawââ That âthe ills of a bachelor's life Are blisses, compared with a mother-in-law, And a boarding-school miss for a wife!â So he smokes and he drinks, and he jokes and he winks, And he dines and he wines, all alone, With a thumb ever ready to snap as he thinks Of the comforts he never has known. But up in his denâ(Ah, my bachelor chum!)â I have sat with him there in the gloom, When the laugh of his lips died away to become But a phantom of mirth in the room. And to look on him there you would love him, for all His ridiculous ways, and be dumb As the little girl-face that smiles down from the wall On the tears of my bachelor chum. TOMMY SMITH Dimple-cheeked and rosy-lipped, With his cap-rim backward tipped, Still in fancy I can see Little Tommy smile on meâ Little Tommy Smith. Little unsung Tommy Smithâ Scarce a name to rhyme it with; Yet most tenderly to me Something sings unceasinglyâ Little Tommy Smith. On the verge of some far land Still forever does he stand, With his cap-rim rakishly Tilted; so he smiles on meâ Little Tommy Smith. Elder-blooms contrast the grace Of the rover's radiant faceâ Whistling back, in mimicry, âOldâBobâWhite!â all liquidlyâ Little Tommy Smith. O my jaunty statuette Of first love, I see you yet, Though you smile so mistily, It is but through tears I see, Little Tommy Smith. But, with crown tipped back behind, And the glad hand of the wind Smoothing back your hair, I see Heaven's best angel smile on me,â Little Tommy Smith. THE LAUGHTER OF THE RAIN The rain sounds like a laugh to meâ A low laugh poured out limpidly. My very soul smiles as I listen to The low, mysterious laughter of the rain, Poured musically over heart and brain Till sodden care, soaked with it through and through, Sinks; and, with wings wet with it as with dew, My spirit flutters up, with every stain Rinsed from its plumage, and as white again As when the old laugh of the rain was new. Then laugh on, happy Rain! laugh louder yet!â Laugh out in torrent-bursts of watery mirth; Unlock thy lips of purple cloud, and let Thy liquid merriment baptize the earth, And wash the sad face of the world, and set The universe to music dripping-wet! ETERNITY O what a weary while it is to stand, Telling the countless ages o'er and o'er, Till all the finger-tips held out before Our dazzled eyes by heaven's starry hand Drop one by one, yet at some dread command Are held again, and counted evermore! How feverish the music seems to pour Along the throbbing veins of anthems grand! And how the cherubim sing on and onâ The seraphim and angelsâstill in whiteâ Still harpingâstill enrapturedâfar withdrawn In hovering armies tranced in endless flight! ... God's mercy! is there never dusk or dawn, Or any crumb of gloom to feed upon? LAST WORDS He left me for a foreign land: I could not even free One little tear to gem the hand That God had given me; For âI will follow soon, my dear,â I laughed with girlish air,â âThe sun that cheers our pathway here Shall beam upon us there!â And so we parted. ... Listen, God!â I may not even free One little tear to dew the sod Where, sleeping peacefully, He waits in foreign landsâmy dear! But prophecy and prayer,â âThe sun that cheers our pathway here Shall beam upon usâthere!â AT BAY Desperate, at last I stand Ready, Fate, with open hand To grasp yours, or to strike Blow for blowâjust as you like. You have dogged me day by dayâ Chased me when a child at play: Even from the mother-nest Pushed me when I needed rest. You have crouched along my track Like a hound, and hurled me back, While your dog's-tongue lapped the blood Of my murdered babyhood. Pitilessly, year by year, From the farthest past to here, You have fallen like a blight On each blossom of delight. You have risen up between Me and every hope serene That has promised rest at last From the trials of the past. You have shut the light of day From my presentâstolen away All my faith in better things Than sheer desperation brings. But as now I come to know That I may no farther go, I have turnedânot to resist, But to greet you hand or fist. A WORN-OUT PENCIL Welladay! Here I lay You at restâall worn away, O my pencil, to the tip Of our old companionship! Memory Sighs to see What you are, and used to be, Looking backward to the time When you wrote your earliest rhyme!â When I sat Filing at Your first point, and dreaming that Your initial song should be Worthy of posterity. With regret I forget If the song be living yet, Yet remember, vaguely now, It was honest, anyhow. You have brought Me a thoughtâ Truer yet was never taught,â That the silent song is best, And the unsung worthiest. So if I, When I die, May as uncomplainingly Drop aside as now you do, Write of me, as I of you:â Here lies one Who begun Life a-singing, heard of none; And he died, satisfied, With his dead songs by his side. GOD BLESS US EVERY ONE âGod bless us every one!â prayed Tiny Tim, Crippled, and dwarfed of body, yet so tall Of soul, we tiptoe earth to look on him, High towering over all. He loved the loveless world, nor dreamed indeed That it, at best, could give to him, the while, But pitying glances, when his only need Was but a cheery smile. And thus he prayed, âGod bless us every one!â Enfolding all the creeds within the span Of his child-heart; and so, despising none, Was nearer saint than man. I like to fancy God, in Paradise, Lifting a finger o'er the rhythmic swing Of chiming harp and song, with eager eyes Turned earthward, listeningâ The Anthem stilledâthe Angels leaning there Above the golden wallsâthe morning sun Of Christmas bursting flower-like with the prayer, âGod bless us every one!â THE TREE-TOAD â'Scur'ous-like,â said the tree-toad, âI've twittered fer rain all day; And I got up soon, And hollered tel noonâ But the sun, hit blazed away, Tel I jest clumb down in a crawfish-hole, Weary at hart, and sick at soul! âDozed away fer an hour, And I tackled the thing ag'in: And I sung, and sung, Tel I knowed my lung Was jest about give in; And then, thinks I, ef hit don't rain now, They's nothin' in singin', anyhow! âOnc't in a while some farmer Would come a-drivin' past; And he'd hear my cry, And stop and sighâ Tel I jest laid back, at last, And I hollered rain tel I thought my th'oat Would bust wide open at ever' note! âBut I fetched her!âO I fetched her!â 'Cause a little while ago, As I kindo' set, With one eye shet, And a-singin' soft and low, A voice drapped down on my fevered brain, A-sayin',ââEf you'll jest hush I'll rain!ââ LAUGHING SONG Sing us something full of laughter; Tune your harp, and twang the strings Till your glad voice, chirping after, Mates the song the robin sings: Loose your lips and let them flutter Like the wings of wanton birds,â Though they naught but laughter utter, Laugh, and we'll not miss the words. Sing in ringing tones that mingle In a melody that flings Joyous echoes in a jingle Sweeter than the minstrel sings: Sing of Winter, Spring or Summer, Clang of war, or low of herds; Trill of cricket, roll of drummerâ Laugh, and we'll not miss the words. Like the lisping laughter glancing From the meadow brooks and springs, Or the river's ripples dancing To the tune the current singsâ Sing of Now, and the Hereafter; Let your glad song, like the birds', Overflow with limpid laughterâ Laugh, and we'll not miss the words. THE WITCH OF ERKMURDEN I Who cantereth forth in the night so lateâ So late in the night, and so nigh the dawn? 'Tis The Witch of Erkmurden who leapeth the gate Of the old churchyard where the three Sprites wait Till the whir of her broom is gone. And who peereth down from the belfry tall, With the ghost-white face and the ghastly stare, With lean hands clinched in the grated wall Where the red vine rasps and the rank leaves fall, And the clock-stroke drowns his prayer? II The wee babe wails, and the storm grows loud, Nor deeper the dark of the night may be, For the lightning's claw, with a great wet cloud, Hath wiped the moon and the wild-eyed crowd Of the stars out wrathfully. Knuckled and kinked as the hunchback shade Of a thorn-tree bendeth the bedlam old Over the couch where the mother-maid, With her prayerful eyes, and the babe are laid, Waiting the doom untold. âMother, O Mother, I only crave Mercy for him and the babeânot me!â âHush! for it maketh my brain to rave Of my two white shrouds, and my one wide grave, And a mound for my children three.â âMother, O Mother, I only pray Pity for him who is son to thee And more than my brother.ââ âWilt hush, I say! Though I meet thee not at the Judgment Day, I will bury my children three!â âThen hark! O Mother, I hear his cryâ Hear his curse from the church-tower now,â âRide thou witch till thy hate shall die, Yet hell as Heaven eternally Be sealed to such as thou!ââ An infant's wailâthen a laugh, god wot, That strangled the echoes of deepest hell; And a thousand shuttles of lightning shot, And the moon bulged out like a great red blot, And a shower of blood-stars fell. III There is one wide grave scooped under the eavesâ Under the eaves as they weep and weep; And, veiled by the mist that the dead storm weaves, The hag bends low, and the earth receives Mother and child asleep. There's the print of the hand at either throat, And the frothy ooze at the lips of each, But both smile up where the new stars float, And the moon sails out like a silver boat Unloosed from a stormy beach. IV Bright was the morn when the sexton gray Twirled the rope of the old church-bell,â But it answered not, and he tugged awayâ And lo, at his feet a dead man layâ Dropped down with a single knell. And the scared wight found, in the lean hand gripped, A scrip which read: âO the grave is wide, But it empty waits, for the low eaves dripped Their prayerful tears, and the three Sprites slipped Away with my babe and bride.â THE BALLAD OF SMILES AND TEARS BY LEE O. HARRIS AND JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY I When the gleeful Spring on dancing feet Pranks the sward of the forest aisles, And the bluebird pipes from his old retreat, O then may the glad face bloom with smiles: But whenever the wind of winter piles The drifting snow on the frozen meres, And the feet are worn with the weary miles, Then hearts that are heavy may melt in tears. II When the soul is brimmed with a joy too sweet To waste like that of a laughing child's, When the lips of love for the first time meet, O then may the glad face bloom with smiles: But whenever the kiss of love defiles, And friendship wanes with the waning years, When faith has perished, and hope beguiles, Then hearts that are heavy may melt in tears. III When the brow is crowned and the song complete, And the minstrel's guerdon reconciles The victor-soul to the heart's defeat, O then may the glad face bloom with smiles: But whenever the world in scorn compiles Its ready pages of scoffs and jeers, And the brain is weary of envy's wiles, Then hearts that are heavy may melt in tears. L'ENVOY When the eyelids droop like a drowsy child's, O then may the glad face bloom with smiles: But whenever the waking is fraught with fears, Then hearts that are heavy may melt in tears. THIS MAN JONES This man Jones was what you'd call A feller 'at had no sand at all; Kind o' consumpted, and undersize, And sallor-complected, with big sad eyes, And a kind-of-a sort-of-a hang-dog style, And a sneakin' sort-of-a half-way smile 'At kind o' give him away to us As a preacher, maybe, er somepin' wuss. Didn't take with the gangâwell, noâ But still we managed to use him, though,â Coddin' the gilly along the rout', And drivin' the stakes 'at he pulled outâ Fer I was one of the bosses then, And of course stood in with the canvasmen; And the way we put up jobs, you know, On this man Jones jes' beat the show! Ust to rattle him scandalous, And keep the feller a-dodgin' us, And a-shyin' round half skeered to death, And afeerd to whimper above his breath; Give him a cussin', and then a kick, And then a kind-of-a backhand lickâ Jes' fer the fun of seein' him climb Around with a head on most the time. But what was the curioust thing to me, Was along o' the partyâlet me see,â Who was our âLion Queenâ last year?â Mamzelle Zanty, or De La Pierre?â Well, no matterâa stunnin' mash, With a red-ripe lip, and a long eyelash, And a figger sich as the angels ownsâ And one too many fer this man Jones. He'd allus wake in the afternoon, As the band waltzed in on the lion-tune, And there, from the time 'at she'd go in Till she'd back out of the cage ag'in, He'd stand, shaky and limber-kneedâ 'Specially when she come to âfeed The beasts raw meat with her naked handââ And all that business, you understand. And it was resky in that denâ Fer I think she juggled three cubs then, And a big âgreenâ lion 'at used to smash Collar-bones fer old Frank Nash; And I reckon now she hain't fergot The afternoon old âNeroâ sot His paws on her!âbut as fer me, It's a sort-of-a mixed-up mystery:â Kind o' remember an awful roar, And see her back fer the bolted doorâ See the cage rockâheerd her call âGod have mercy!â and that was allâ Fer they ain't no livin' man can tell What it's like when a thousand yell In female tones, and a thousand more Howl in bass till their throats is sore! But the keeper said 'at dragged her out, They heerd some feller laugh and shoutâ âSave her! Quick! I've got the cuss!â And yit she waked and smiled on us! And we daren't flinch, fer the doctor said, Seein' as this man Jones was dead, Better to jes' not let her know Nothin' o' that fer a week er so. WAIT We know, O faltering heart, Thy need is great: But weary is the way that leads to art, And all who journey there must bear their partâ Must bear their part, andâwait. The way is wild and steep, And desolate: No flowers blossom there, nor lilies peep Above the walls to warn you, as you weep, With one white whisperââWait.â You will find thorns, alas! And keen as fate: And, reaching from rank fens of withered grass, Briers will clutch your feet, nor let you passâ And you must waitâmust wait. And though with failing sight You see the gate Of Promise locked and barred, with swarthy Night Guarding the golden keys of morning-light,â Press bravely onâand wait. LELLOINE I Tiny queen, Lelloine! Little eyes laugh out between Dimpled fingers that were busy But a weary moment since Mischief-makingâfor she is a Match for Puck, the fairy prince! She must ever be advancing Some new prank; and laughing, dancing, Disappearing at the door, Like a sunbeam leaving shaded All that was so bright beforeâ Like a sunbeam leaving faded Flowers on the floor. O, you joking, dear provoking, Little laughing Lelloine! II Calm, serene, Lelloine! Lying lily-like between The blurred leaves of life and love That our wet eyes bend above, Lisp nor laughter on the lips: Two white rose-leaves now eclipse Such of glances as the chance Dimple dances in advance. Darling! Darling! tell us why You do neither laugh nor cry; Even though you moaned in pain, We could be so glad again! What unchanging smile is this That we shudder so to kiss? Hearts are leaning low to glean All your meaning, Lelloine. A DREAM OF AUTUMN Mellow hazes, lowly trailing Over wood and meadow, veiling Somber skies, with wild fowl sailing Sailor-like to foreign lands; And the north wind overleaping Summer's brink, and flood-like sweeping Wrecks of roses where the weeping- Willows wring their helpless hands. Flared, like Titan torches flinging Flakes of flame and embers, springing From the vale, the trees stand swinging In the moaning atmosphere; While in dead'ning lands the lowing Of the cattle, sadder growing, Fills the sense to overflowing With the sorrow of the year. Sorrowfully, yet the sweeter Sings the brook in rippled meter Under boughs that lithely teeter Lorn birds, answering from the shores Through the viny, shady-shiny Interspaces, shot with tiny Flying motes that fleck the winy Wave-engraven sycamores. Fields of ragged stubble, wrangled With rank weeds, and shocks of tangled Corn, with crests like rent plumes dangled Over Harvest's battle-plain; And the sudden whir and whistle Of the quail that, like a missile, Whizzes over thorn and thistle, And, a missile, drops again. Muffled voices, hid in thickets Where the redbird stops to stick its Ruddy beak betwixt the pickets Of the truant's rustic trap; And the sound of laughter ringing Where, within the wild vine swinging, Climb Bacchante's schoolmates, flinging Purple clusters in her lap. Rich as wine, the sunset flashes Round the tilted world, and dashes Up the sloping West, and splashes Red foam over sky and seaâ Till my dream of Autumn, paling In the splendor all-prevailing, Like a sallow leaf goes sailing Down the silence solemnly. SINCE MY MOTHER DIED Since my mother died, the tone Of my voice has fainter grown, And my words, so strangely few, Are as strange to me as you. Something like a lens is drawn Over all I look upon, And the world is O so wide, Since my mother died. Since my mother died, my face Knows not any resting-place, Save in visions, lightly pressed In its old accustomed rest On her shoulder. But I wake With a never-ending ache In my heart, and naught beside, Since my mother died. Since my mother died, the years Have been dropping like my tears, Till the bloom is washed away From my cheeks, and slow decay Seams the corners of my eyes, Where my childish laughter lies Drowned in tears that never dried Since my mother died. Since my mother died, my feet Falter in the crowded street, With bewildered steps that seem Tangled in some grassy dream, And, in busy haunts of men, Slowly down the past again Do I wander weary-eyed, Since my mother died. Since my mother died, O friends! No one leads me now, or lends Me a kindly word, or touch Of the hands I need so much; No one counsels me, or cares For my trials, doubts, despairs, And the world is O so wide, Since my mother died. BELLS JANGLED I lie low-coiled in a nest of dreams; The lamp gleams dim i' the odorous gloom, And the stars at the casement leak long gleams Of misty light through the haunted room Where I lie low-coiled in dreams. The night winds ooze o'er my dusk-drowned face In a dewy flood that ebbs and flows, Washing a surf of dim white lace Under my throat and the dark red rose In the shade of my dusk-drowned face. There's a silken strand of some strange sound Slipping out of a skein of song: Eerily as a call unwound From a fairy bugle, it slides along In a silken strand of sound. There's the tinkling drip of a faint guitar; There's a gurgling flute, and a blaring horn Blowing bubbles of tune afar O'er the misty heights of the hills of morn, To the drip of a faint guitar. And I dream that I neither sleep nor wakeâ Careless am I if I wake or sleep, For my soul floats out on the waves that break In crests of song on the shoreless deep Where I neither sleep nor wake. DUSK SONGâTHE BEETLE The shrilling locust slowly sheathes His dagger-voice, and creeps away Beneath the brooding leaves where breathes The zephyr of the dying day: One naked star has waded through The purple shallows of the night, And faltering as falls the dew It drips its misty light. O'er garden blooms, On tides of musk, The beetle booms adown the glooms And bumps along the dusk. The katydid is rasping at The silence from the tangled broom: On drunken wings the flitting bat Goes staggering athwart the gloom; The toadstool bulges through the weeds, And lavishly to left and right The fireflies, like golden seeds, Are sown about the night. O'er slumbrous blooms, On floods of musk, The beetle booms adown the glooms And bumps along the dusk. The primrose flares its baby-hands Wide open, as the empty moon, Slow lifted from the underlands, Drifts up the azure-arched lagoon; The shadows on the garden walk Are frayed with rifts of silver light; And, trickling down the poppy-stalk, The dewdrop streaks the night. O'er folded blooms, On swirls of musk, The beetle booms adown the glooms And bumps along the dusk. SLEEP Thou drowsy god, whose blurred eyes, half awink, Muse on me,âdrifting out upon thy dreams, I have my soul as in enchanted streams Where reveling satyrs pipe along the brink, And, tipsy with the melody they drink, Uplift their dangling hooves and down the beams Of sunshine dance like motes. Thy languor seems An ocean-depth of love wherein I sink Like some fond Argonaut, right willingly,â Because of wooing eyes upturned to mine, And siren-arms that coil their sorcery About my neck, with kisses so divine, The heavens reel above me, and the sea Swallows and licks its wet lips over me. MARTHY ELLEN They's nothin' in the name to strike A feller more'n common like! 'Taint liable to git no praise Ner nothin' like it nowadays; An' yit that name o' her'n is jest As purty as the purtiestâ And more'n that, I'm here to say I'll live a-thinkin' thataway And die fer Marthy Ellen! It may be I was prejudust In favor of it from the fustâ 'Cause I kin ricollect jest how We met, and hear her mother now A-callin' of her down the roadâ And, aggervatin' little toad!â I see her now, jest sort o' half- Way disapp'inted, turn and laugh And mock herââMarthy Ellen!â Our people never had no fuss, And yit they never tuck to us; We neighbered back and foreds some; Until they see she liked to come To our houseâand me and her Was jest together ever'whur And all the timeâand when they'd see That I liked her and she liked me, They'd holler âMarthy Ellen!â When we growed up, and they shet down On me and her a-runnin' roun' Together, and her father said He'd never leave her nary red, So he'p him, ef she married me, And so onâand her mother she Jest agged the gyrl, and said she 'lowed She'd ruther see her in her shroud, I writ to Marthy Ellenâ That is, I kind o' tuck my pen In hand, and stated whur and when The undersigned would be that night, With two good hosses, saddled right Fer lively travelin', in case Her folks 'ud like to jine the race. She sent the same note back, and writ âThe rose is red!â right under itâ âYour'n allus, Marthy Ellen.â That's all, I reckonâNothin' more To tell but what you've heerd aforeâ The same old story, sweeter though Fer all the trouble, don't you know. Old-fashioned name! and yit it's jest As purty as the purtiest; And more'n that, I'm here to say I'll live a-thinkin' thataway, And die fer Marthy Ellen! THE LITTLE TOWN O' TAILHOLT You kin boast about yer cities, and their stiddy growth and size, And brag about yer County-seats, and business enterprise, And railroads, and factories, and all sich fooleryâ But the little Town o' Tailholt is big enough fer me! Your kin harp about yer churches, with their steeples in the clouds, And gas about yer graded streets, and blow about yer crowds; You kin talk about yer âtheaters,â and all you've got to seeâ But the little Town o' Tailholt is show enough fer me! They hain't no style in our townâhit's little-like and smallâ They hain't no âchurches,â nuther,âjes' the meetin'-house is all; They's no sidewalks, to speak ofâbut the highway's allus free, And the little Town o' Tailholt is wide enough fer me! Some finds it discommodin'-like, I'm willing to admit To hev but one post-office, and a womern keepin' hit, And the drug-store, and shoe-shop, and grocery, all threeâ But the little Town o' Tailholt is handy 'nough fer me! You kin smile and turn yer nose up, and joke and hev yer fun, And laugh and holler âTail-holts is better holts'n none!â Ef the city suits you better, w'y, hit's where you'd ort'o beâ But the little Town o' Tailholt's good enough fer me! WHERE SHALL WE LAND Where shall we land you, sweet? âSwinburne All listlessly we float Out seaward in the boat That beareth Love. Our sails of purest snow Bend to the blue below And to the blue above. Where shall we land? We drift upon a tide Shoreless on every side, Save where the eye Of Fancy sweeps far lands Shelved slopingly with sands Of gold and porphyry. Where shall we land? The fairy isles we see, Loom up so mistilyâ So vaguely fair, We do not care to break Fresh bubbles in our wake To bend our course for there. Where shall we land? The warm winds of the deep Have lulled our sails to sleep, And so we glide Careless of wave or wind, Or change of any kind, Or turn of any tide. Where shall we land? We droop our dreamy eyes Where our reflection lies Steeped in the sea, And, in an endless fit Of languor, smile on it And its sweet mimicry. Where shall we land? âWhere shall we land?â God's grace! I know not any place So fair as thisâ Swung here between the blue Of sea and sky, with you To ask me, with a kiss, âWhere shall we land?â HOPE Hope, bending o'er me one time, snowed the flakes Of her white touches on my folded sight, And whispered, half rebukingly, âWhat makes My little girl so sorrowful to-night?â O scarce did I unclasp my lids, or lift Their tear-glued fringes, as with blind embrace I caught within my arms the mother-gift, And with wild kisses dappled all her face. That was a baby dream of long ago: My fate is fanged with frost, and tongued with flame: My woman-soul, chased naked through the snow, Stumbles and staggers on without an aim. And yet, here in my agony, sometimes A faint voice reaches down from some far height, And whispers through a glamouring of rhymes,â âWhat makes my little girl so sad to-night?â THE LITTLE TINY KICKSHAW âAnd any little tiny kickshaw. âShakespeare. O the little tiny kickshaw that Mither sent tae me, 'Tis sweeter than the sugar-plum that reepens on the tree, Wi' denty flavorin's o' spice an' musky rosemarie, The little tiny kickshaw that Mither sent tae me. 'Tis luscious wi' the stalen tang o' fruits frae ower the sea, An' e'en its fragrance gars me laugh wi' langin' lip an' ee, Till a' its frazen scheen o' white maun melten hinnie beâ Sae weel I luve the kickshaw that Mither sent tae me. O I luve the tiny kickshaw, an' I smack my lips wi' glee, Aye mickle do I luve the taste o' sic a luxourie, But maist I luve the luvein' han's that could the giftie gie O' the little tiny kickshaw that Mither sent tae me. DEATH Lo, I am dying! And to feel the King Of terrors fasten on me, steeps all sense Of life, and love, and loss, and everything, In such deep calms of restful indolence, His keenest fangs of pain are sweet to me As fusÃ¨d kisses of mad lovers' lips When, flung shut-eyed in spasmed ecstasy, They feel the world spin past them in eclipse, And so thank God with ever-tightening lids! But what I see, the soul of me forbids All utterance of; and what I hear and feel, The rattle in my throat could ill reveal Though it were music to your ears as to Mine own.âPress closerâcloserâI have grown So great, your puny arms about me thrown Seem powerless to hold me here with you;â I slip awayâI waverâandâI fallâ Christ! What a plunge! Where am I dropping? All My breath bursts into dustâI can not cryâ I whirlâI reel and veer up overhead, And drop flat-faced againstâagainstâthe skyâ Soh, bless me! I am dead! TO THE WINE-GOD MERLUS A Toast of Jucklet's Ho ho! thou jolly god, with kinkÃ¨d lips And laughter-streaming eyes, thou liftest up The heart of me like any wassail-cup, And from its teeming brim, in foaming drips, Thou blowest all my cares. I cry to thee, Between the sips:âDrink long and lustily; Drink thou my ripest joys, my richest mirth, My maddest staves of wanton minstrelsy; Drink every song I've tinkered here on earth With any patch of music; drink! and be Thou drainer of my soul, and to the lees Drink all my lover-thrills and ecstasies; And with a final gulpâho! ho!âdrink me, And roll me o'er thy tongue eternally. THE GINOINE AR-TICKLE Talkin' o' poetry,âThere're few men yit 'At's got the stuff b'iled down so's it'll pour Out sorgum-like, and keeps a year and more Jes' sweeter ever' time you tackle it! Why, all the jinglin' truck 'at hes been writ Fer twenty year and better is so pore You cain't find no sap in it any more 'N you'd find juice in puff-balls!âAnd I'd Quit! What people wants is facts, I apperhend; And naked Natur is the thing to give Your writin' bottom, eh? And I contend 'At honest work is allus bound to live. Now them's my views; 'cause you kin recommend Sich poetry as that from end to end. A BRIDE âO I am weary!â she sighed, as her billowy Hair she unloosed in a torrent of gold That rippled and fell o'er a figure as willowy, Graceful and fair as a goddess of old: Over her jewels she flung herself drearily, Crumpled the laces that snowed on her breast, Crushed with her fingers the lily that wearily Clung in her hair like a dove in its nest. âAnd naught but her shadowy form in the mirror To kneel in dumb agony down and weep near her! âWeary?ââof what? Could we fathom the mystery?â Lift up the lashes weighed down by her tears And wash with their dews one white face from her history, Set like a gem in the red rust of years? Nothing will rest herâunless he who died of her Strayed from his grave, and, in place of the groom, Tipping her face, kneeling there by the side of her, Drained the old kiss to the dregs of his doom. âAnd naught but that shadowy form in the mirror To kneel in dumb agony down and weep near her! STANZAS FOR A NEW SONG Whistle us something old, you know! Pucker your lips with the old-time twist, And whistle the jigs of the long ago, Or the old hornpipes that you used to whist. Some old, old tune that we oft averred Was a little the oldest thing we'd heard Since âthe bob-tailed nagâ was a frisky colt, In the babbling days of old âBen Bold.â Whistle us something old and grayâ Some toothless tune of the bygone yearsâ Some bald old song that limps to-day With a walking-stick this vale of tears. Whistle a stave of the good old days, E'er the fur stood up in a thousand ways On the listener's pelt as he ripped and tore, And diddle-dee-blank-blanked Pinafore. CHORUS Whistle us something old, you know! Pucker your lips with the old-time twist, And whistle the jigs of the long ago, Or the old hornpipes that you used to whist. LINES TO AN ONSETTLED YOUNG MAN âO, what is Life at last,â says you, â'At woman-folks and man-folks too, Cain't oncomplainin', worry through? âAn' what is Love, 'at no one yit 'At's monkeyed with it kin forgit, Er gits fat on remember'n hit? âAn' what is Death?ââW'y, looky hyurâ Ef Life an' Love don't suit you, sir, Hit's jes' the thing yer lookin' fer!

LAWYER AND CHILD How large was Alexander, father, That parties designate The historic gentleman as rather Inordinately great? Why, son, to speak with conscientious Regard for history, Waiving all claims, of course, to heights pretentious,â About the size of me. THE LOST KISS I put by the half-written poem, While the pen, idly trailed in my hand, Writes on,ââHad I words to complete it, Who'd read it, or who'd understand?â But the little bare feet on the stairway, And the faint, smothered laugh in the hall, And the eery-low lisp on the silence, Cry up to me over it all. So I gather it upâwhere was broken The tear-faded thread of my theme, Telling how, as one night I sat writing, A fairy broke in on my dream, A little inquisitive fairyâ My own little girl, with the gold Of the sun in her hair, and the dewy Blue eyes of the fairies of old. 'Twas the dear little girl that I scoldedâ For was it a moment like this,â I said, âwhen she knew I was busy, To come romping in for a kiss?â Come rowdying up from her mother, And clamoring there at my knee For âOne 'ittle kiss for my dolly, And one 'ittle uzzer for me!ââ God, pity the heart that repelled her, And the cold hand that turned her away, And take, from the lips that denied her, This answerless prayer of to-day! Take, Lord, from my mem'ry forever That pitiful sob of despair, And the patter and trip of the little bare feet, And the one piercing cry on the stair! I put by the half-written poem, While the pen, idly trailed in my hand, Writes on,ââHad I words to complete it, Who'd read it, or who'd understand?â But the little bare feet on the stairway, And the faint, smothered laugh in the hall, And the eery-low lisp on the silence, Cry up to me over it all. MICHAEL FLYNN AND THE BABY Luk at 'ere, ould baby,âwho Shak's the fist av 'im at you? Who's the spalpeen wid the stim Av his poipe a pokin' 'im? Who's the divil grinnin' 'ere In the eyes av yez, me dear? Arrah! darlint, spake and soy Don't yez know yer feytherâboy? Wheer's the gab yer mither had Whin she blarneyed yer ould dad Wid her tricks and 'ily words Loike the liltin' av the birds? Wheer's the tongue av Michael Flynn, And the capers av the chin He's a-waggin' at yez?âHoy? Don't yez know yer feytherâboy? Arrah! baby, wid the eyes Av the saints in Paradise, And Saint Patrick's own bald pate, Is it yer too howly swate To be changin' words because It's the hod, and not the cross, Ornamints me showlder?âsoy? Don't yez know yer feytherâboy? ON A SPLENDUD MATCH [On the night of the marraige of the foregoin' couple, which shall be nameless here, these lines was ca'mly dashed off in the albun of the happy bride whilse the shivver-ree was goin' on outside the residence.] He was warned aginst the womernâ She was warned aginst the man.â And ef that won't make a weddin', W'y, they's nothin' else that can! THE SINGER While with Ambition's hectic flame He wastes the midnight oil, And dreams, high-throned on heights of fame, To rest him from his toil,â Death's Angel, like a vast eclipse, Above him spreads her wings, And fans the embers of his lips To ashes as he sings. GUINEVERE What is it I am waiting for? My footfall in the corridor Jars upward through the night, and swings The brazen silence till it rings Like any bell. My weak knees faint Before the sad face of my saint, And, 'twixt my lifted eyes and tears, Dim lists of mounted cavaliers Swim past. ... A nodding plume that dips To brush the dead prayers from my lips Like dustâ. God's mercy! rid my sight Of Launcelot, or blind me quite! I know what duty is! Ah, Christ! The memory of our latest tryst Is fanged within my very soul! ... I swear to you, in all control I held myself! ... 'Twas love, I wis, That sprang upon that kiss of his, And drank and drained it to the lees Of three God-shaken destinies. 'Twas love, I tell you, wild, insane, Stark mad and babbling, wanton, vainâ But tell me, Where is Arthur?âor, What is it I am waiting for? THE WEREWIFE She came to me in a dazzling guise Of gleaming tresses and glimmering eyes, With long, limp lashes that drooped and made For their baleful glances bowers of shade; And a face so whiteâso white and sleek That the roses blooming in either cheek Flamed and burned with a crimson glow Redder than ruddiest roses blowâ Redder than blood of the roses know That Autumn spills in the drifted snow. And what could my fluttering, moth-winged soul Do but hover in her control?â With its little, bewildered bead-eyes fixed Where the gold and the white and the crimson mixed? And when the tune of her low laugh went Up from that ivory instrument That you would have called her throat, I swear The notes built nests in her gilded hair, And nestled and whistled and twittered there, And wooed me and won me to my despair. And thus it was that she lured me on, Till the latest gasp of my love was gone, And my soul lay dead, with a loathing face Turned in vain from her dread embrace,â For even its poor dead eyes could see Her sharp teeth sheathed in the flesh of me, And her dripping lips, as she turned to shake The red froth off that her greed did make, As my heart gripped hold of a deathless ache, And the kiss of her stung like the fang of a snake. THE BAN I Strange dreams of what I used to be, And what I dreamed I would be, swim Before my vision, faint and dim As misty distances we see In pictured scenes of fairy lands; And ever on, with empty hands, And eyes that ever lie to me, And smiles that no one understands, I grope adown my destiny. II Some say I waver as I walk Along the crowded thoroughfares; And some leer in my eyes, and talk Of dulness, while I see in theirsâ Like fishes' eyes, alive or deadâ But surfaces of vacancyâ Blank disks that never seem to see, But glint and glow and glare instead. III The ragged shawl I wear is wet With driving, dripping rains, and yet It seems a royal raiment, where, Through twisted torrents of my hair, I see rare gems that gleam and shine Like jewels in a stream of wine; The gaping shoes that clothe my feet Are golden sandals, and the shrine Where courtiers grovel and repeat Vain prayers, and where, in joy thereat, A fair Prince doffs his plumÃ¨d hat, And kneels, and names me all things sweet. IV Sometimes the sun shines, and the lull Of winter noon is like a tune The stars might twinkle to the moon If night were white and beautifulâ For when the clangor of the town And strife of traffic softens down, The wakeful hunger that I nurse, In listening, forgets to curse, Untilâah, joy! with drooping head I drowse, and dream that I am dead And buried safe beyond their eyes Who either pity or despise. AN IDIOT I'm on'y thist a' idiotâ That's what folks calls a feller what Ain't got no mind Of any kind, Ner don't know nothin' he's forgot.â I'm one o' themâBut I know why The bees buzz this way when they fly,â 'Cause honey it gits on their wings. Ain't thumbs and fingers funny things? What's money? Hooh! it's thist a hole Punched in a round thing 'at won't roll 'Cause they's a string Poked through the thing And fastened round your neckâthat's all! Ef I could git my money off, I'd buy whole lots o' whoopin'-cough And give it to the boy next door Who died 'cause he ain't got no more. What is it when you die? I know,â You can't wake up ag'in, ner go To sleep no moreâ Ner kick, ner snore. Ner lay and look and watch it snow; And when folks slaps and pinches youâ You don't keer nothin' what they do. No honey on the angels' wings! Ain't thumbs and fingers funny things? AN ORDER FOR A SONG Make me a song of all good things, And fill it full of murmurings, Of merry voices, such as we Remember in our infancy; But make it tender, for the sake Of hearts that brood and tears that break, And tune it with the harmony, The sighs of sorrow make. Make me a song of summer-time, And pour such music down the rhyme As ripples over gleaming sands And grassy brinks of meadow-lands; But make it very sweet and low, For need of them that sorrow so, Because they reap with empty hands The dreams of long ago. Make me a song of such a tone, That when we croon it all alone, The tears of longing as they drip, Will break in laughter on the lip; And make it, oh, so pure and clear And jubilant that every ear Shall drink its rapture sip by sip, And Heaven lean to hear. THE CONQUEROR He hears the whir of the battle-drum, And the shrill-voiced fife, and the bugle-call, With a thirsty spirit that drinks it all As men might drink the wine poured from Old wicker flagons raimented With the rust and dust of ages dead. He plunges into the crimson sea Of carnage, and with a dauntless pride, He swims, with his good star, side by side, To the blood-sprayed heights of Victory, Where never his glory waxes dim, Though a woman's weak hand conquers him. And high and aloneâas the sculptor makes Him set in stone that the world may seeâ He sits there, crowned eternally, And sheltered under a flag that shakes Her silken stripes and her silver stars Into a tangle of endless wars. AFTER DEATH A FANCY Ah! this delights me more than words could tell,â To just lie stark and still, with folded hands That tremble not at greeting or farewell, Nor fumble foolishly in loosened strands Of woman's hair, nor grip with jealousy To find her face turned elsewhere smilingly. With slumbrous lids, and mouth in mute repose, And lips that yearn no more for any kissâ Though it might drip, as from the red-lipped rose The dewdrop drips, 'twere not so sweet as this Unutterable density of rest That reigns in every vein of brain and breast! And thusâsoaked with still laughter through and throughâ I lie here dreaming of the forms that pass Above my grave, to drop, with tears, a few White flowers that but curdle the green grass;â And if they read such sermons, they could see How I do pity them that pity me. THE MAD LOVER My eyes are feverish and dull; I'm tired, and my throat hurts so! And life has grown so pitifulâ So very pitiful, I know Not any hope of rest or peace, But just to live on, ache by ache, Feeling my heart click on, nor cease, Nor ever wholly break. You smiled so sweetly, Miriam Wayne, I could not help but love your smile, And fair as sunshine after rain It glimmered on me all the while; Why, it did soak as summer light Through all my life, until, indeed, I ripened as an apple might From golden rind to seed. Fate never wrought so pitiless An evil, as when first your eyes Poured back in mine the tenderness That made the world a Paradiseâ For Miriam, remembering The warm white hands that lay in mine Like wisps of sunshine vanishingâ Your kisses, spilled like wine Down over forehead, face and lips, Till I lay drunken with delight From crown of soul to finger-tipsâ ... Shriek, Memory, in mad affright!â Howl at the moon like any hound! Yelp âloveâ and âliarâ every breath, And âHeaven is lost and hell is found!â So moan yourself to death! TO ROBERT BURNS Sweet Singer that I loe the maist O' ony, sin' wi' eager haste I smacket bairn-lips ower the taste O' hinnied sang, I hail thee, though a blessed ghaist In Heaven lang! For, weel I ken, nae cantie phrase, Nor courtly airs, nor lairdly ways, Could gar me freer blame, or praise, Or proffer hand, Where âRantin' Robbieâ and his lays Thegither stand. And sae these hamely lines I send, Wi' jinglin' words at ilka end, In echo o' the sangs that wend Frae thee to me Like simmer-brooks, wi' mony a bend O' wimplin' glee. I fancy, as, wi' dewy een, I part the clouds aboon the scene Where thou wast born, and peer atween, I see nae spot In a' the Hielands half sae green And unforgot! I see nae storied castle-hall, Wi' banners flauntin' ower the wall And serf and page in ready call, Sae grand to me As ane puir cotter's hut, wi' all Its poverty. There where the simple daisy grew Sae bonnie sweet, and modest, too, Thy liltin' filled its wee head fu' O' sic a grace, It aye is weepin' tears o' dew Wi' droopit face. Frae where the heather bluebells fling Their sangs o' fragrance to the Spring, To where the lavrock soars to sing, Still lives thy strain, For a' the birds are twittering Sangs like thine ain. And aye, by light o' sun or moon, By banks o' Ayr, or Bonnie Doon, The waters lilt nae tender tune But sweeter seems Because they poured their limpid rune Through a' thy dreams. Wi' brimmin' lip, and laughin' ee, Thou shookest even Grief wi' glee, Yet had nae niggart sympathy Where Sorrow bowed, But gavest a' thy tears as free As a' thy gowd. And sae it is we loe thy name To see bleeze up wi' sic a flame, That a' pretentious stars o' fame Maun blink asklent, To see how simple worth may shame Their brightest glent. HER VALENTINE Somebody's sent a funny little valentine to me. It's a bunch of baby-roses in a vase of filigree, And hovering above themâjust as cute as he can beâ Is a fairy cupid tangled in a scarf of poetry. And the prankish little fellow looks so knowing in his glee, With his golden bow and arrow, aiming most unerringly At a pair of hearts so labeled that I may read and see That one is meant for âOne Who Loves,â and one is meant for me. But I know the lad who sent it! It's as plain as A-B-C!â For the roses they are blushing, and the vase stands awkwardly, And the little god above itâthough as cute as he can beâ Can not breathe the lightest whisper of his burning love for me. SONGS TUNELESS I He kisses me! Ah, now, at last, He says good night as it should be, His great warm eyes bent yearningly Above my faceâhis arms locked fast About me, and mine own eyes dim With happy tears for love of him. He kisses me! Last night, beneath A swarm of stars, he said I stood His one fair form of womanhood, And springing, shut me in the sheath Of a caress that almost hid Me from the good his kisses did. He kisses me! He kisses me! This is the sweetest song I know, And so I sing it very low And faint, and O so tenderly That, though you listen, none but he May hear it as he kisses me. II âHow can I make you love me more?ââ A thousand times she asks me this, Her lips uplifted with the kiss That I have tasted o'er and o'er, Till now I drain it with no sense Other than utter indolence. âHow can I make you love me more?ââ A thousand times her questioning face Has nestled in its resting-place Unanswered, till, though I adore This thing of being loved, I doubt Not I could get along without. âHow can she make me love her more?ââ Ah! little woman, if, indeed, I might be frank as is the need Of frankness, I would fall before Her very feet, and there confess My love were more if hers were less. III Since I am old I have no care To babble silly tales of when I loved, and lied, as other men Have done, who boasted here and there, They would have died for the fair thing They after murdered, marrying. Since I am old I reason thusâ No thing survives, of all the past, But just regret enough to last Us till the clods have smothered us;â Then, with our dead loves, side by side, We may, perhaps, be satisfied. Since I am old, and strive to blow Alive the embers of my youth And early loves, I find, in sooth, An old man's heart may burn so low, 'Tis better just to calmly sit And rake the ashes over it. SISTER JONES'S CONFESSION I thought the deacon like me, yit I warn't adzackly shore of itâ Fer, mind ye, time and time ag'in, When jiners 'ud be comin' in, I'd seed him shakin' hands as free With all the sistern as with me! But jurin' last Revival, where He called on me to lead in prayer An' kneeled there with me, side by side, A-whisper'n' âhe felt sanctified Jes' tetchin' of my gyarment's hem,ââ That settled things as fur as them- Thare other wimmin was concerned!â Andâwell!âI know I must 'a' turned A dozen colors!âFlurried?âla!â No mortal sinner never saw A gladder widder than the one A-kneelin' there and wonderun' Who'd pray!âSo glad, upon my word, I railly couldn't thank the Lord! THE DEAD JOKE AND THE FUNNY MAN Long years ago, a funny man, Flushed with a strange delight, Sat down and wrote a funny thing All in the solemn night; And as he wrote he clapped his hands And laughed with all his might. For it was such a funny thing, O such a very funny thing, This wonderfully funny thing, He Laughed Outright. And so it was this funny man Printed this funny thingâ Forgot it, too, nor ever thought It worth remembering, Till but a day or two ago. (Ah! what may changes bring!) He found this selfsame funny thing In an exchangeââO funny thing!â He cried, âYou dear old funny thing!â And Sobbed Outright. SLEEP Orphaned, I cry to thee: Sweet Sleep! O kneel and be A mother unto me! Calm thou my childish fears; Foldâfold mine eyelids to, all tenderly, And dry my tears. Come, Sleep, all drowsy-eyed And faint with languor,âslide Thy dim face down beside Mine own, and let me rest And nestle in thy heart, and there abide, A favored guest. Good night to every care, And shadow of despair! Good night to all things where Within is no delight!â Sleep opens her dark arms, and, swooning there, I sob: Good nightâgood night! ONE ANGEL âA homely little woman with big handsâ: 'Twas thus she named herself, and shook her head All solemnly, the day that we were wed, While Iâwell, I laughed lightly as I said,â âNo prince am I astray from fairy lands, O, âhomely little woman with big handsâ!â âMy homely little woman with big handsâ I called her ever after,âfirst, intent On irony and admonition blent; Then out ofâsince she smiledâpure merriment; And lastly, from sheer lack of reprimands. Brave, homely little woman with big hands! My homely little woman with big hands, Somehow, grew almost beautiful to me As time went by. Her features I could see Grow ever fairer; and so tenderly The strong hands clung, their touches were commands, Dear homely little woman with big hands! A homely little woman, with big hands Folded all patiently across her breastâ The plain face fair and beautiful in restâ But O, the lips that answer not when pressed! âMake me,â I cry to God, who understands, âA homely little angel with big hands!â LAUGHTER Within the coziest corner of my dreams He sits, high-throned above all gods that be Portrayed in marble-cold mythology, Since from his joyous eyes a twinkle gleams So warm with life and light it ever seems Spraying in mists of sunshine over me, And mingled with such rippling ecstasy As overleaps his lips in laughing streams. Ho! look on him, and say if he be old Or youthful! Hand in hand with gray old Time He toddled when an infant; and, behold!â He hath not aged, but to the lusty prime Of babyhoodâhis brow a trifle boldâ His hair a raveled nimbus of gray gold. AN INVOCATION Sweet Sleep, with mellow palms trailed listlessly Above mine eyelids, folding out the light Of coming day, and shutting in the night That gave but now such wondrous dreams to meâ Bide with me yet with thy dear sorcery, Until once more I grow forgetful quite Of all the cares that blur my waking sight With dim, regretful tears! I beg of thee To lift again thy wand with magic filled, And filter through my faith the words: Behold, Aladdin, as thou badest me, I build A new dream o'er the ruins of the oldâ Thine all eternal palace, silver-silled, And walled with harps, and roofed with crowns of gold! FROM BELOW In the dim summer night they were leaning alone From the balcony over the walk; He, careless enough, one had guessed by the tone Of his voice and his murmurous talk; And sheâwell, her laugh flowed as sweet to the breeze As the voice of the faint violin That ran, with a ripple of ivory keys, Through the opera warbled within. In the odorous locust-boughs trailed o'er the eaves, The nightingale paused in his tune, And the mute katydid hid away in the leaves That were turned from the smile of the moon: And the man sat alone, with his fingers clenched tight O'er a heart that had failed in its beat, While the passers-by saw but a spatter of light Where he dropped his cigar in the street. GLAMOUR Was it in the misty twilight, or the midnight, or the morning, Or was it in the glare of noon, or dazzle of the day, That, half asleep and half awake, and without word or warning, My fancy, slowly slipping earthly anchor, sailed away? O leave me and my lazy dream a little while together, Blending each within the other as we waken in the dawn, With languid lids anointed by the balmy summer weather As it wells above the casement that our vision swoons upon! Linger with me yet a little, O my lazy dream! nor leave me; Though we hear the swallows twitter, it is only in their sleep: And I want you just to cling to me and love me and deceive me A little ere the morning when I waken but to weep. Ah! dream of mine, I see you growing clearer yet and clearer; Your fairy face comes back again from out the misty past, And your smile shines on before you till, approaching ever nearer, It gilds your grave into a glorious trusting-place at last. And you lean thereâwaiting for meâhere's the dainty rose-leaf letter That you sent me saying, âMeet me here, and share my deep delight, For my love by this long silence is so truer, purer, better, That you will taste of Heaven when you touch my lips to-night.â Was it in the misty twilight, or the midnight, or the morning, Or was it in the glare of noon, or dazzle of the day, That, half asleep and half awake, and without word or warning, My fancy, slowly slipping earthly anchor, sailed away? SILENCE Thousands and thousands of hushed years ago, Out on the edge of Chaos, all alone I stood on peaks of vapor, high upthrown Above a sea that knew nor ebb nor flow, Nor any motion won of winds that blow, Nor any sound of watery wail or moan, Nor lisp of wave, nor wandering undertone Of any tide lost in the night below. So still it was, I mind me, as I laid My thirsty ear against mine own faint sigh To drink of that, I sipped it, half afraid 'Twas but the ghost of a dead voice spilled by The one starved star that tottered through the shade And came tiptoeing toward me down the sky. PUCK O it was Puck! I saw him yesternight Swung up betwixt a phlox-top and the rim Of a low crescent moon that cradled him, Whirring his rakish wings with all his might, And pursing his wee mouth, that dimpled white And red, as though some dagger keen and slim Had stung him there, while ever faint and dim His eery warblings piped his high delight: Till I, grown jubilant, shrill answer made, At which all suddenly he dropped from view; And peering after, 'neath the everglade, What was it, do you think, I saw him do? I saw him peeling dewdrops with a blade Of starshine sharpened on his bat-wing shoe. A MORTUL PRAYER Oh! Thou that veileth from all eyes The glory of Thy face, And setteth throned behind the skies In Thy abiding-place: Though I but dimly reco'nize Thy purposes of grace; And though with weak and wavering Deserts, and vex'd with fears, I lift the hands I can not wring All dry of sorrow's tears, Make puore my prayers that daily wing Theyr way unto Thy ears! Oh! with the hand that tames the flood And smooths the storm to rest, Make ba'mmy dews of all the blood That stormeth in my brest, And so refresh my hart to bud And bloom the loveliest. Lull all the clammer of my soul To silunce; bring release Unto the brane still in controle Of doubts; bid sin to cease, And let the waves of pashun roll And kiss the shores of peace. Make me to love my feller manâ Yea, though his bitterness Doth bite as only adders canâ Let me the fault confess, And go to him and clasp his hand And love him none the less. So keep me, Lord, ferever free From vane concete er whim; And he whose pius eyes can see My faults, however dim,â Oh! let him pray the least fer me, And me the most fer him. A ROUGH SKETCH I caught, for a second, across the crowdâ Just for a second, and barely thatâ A face, pox-pitted and evil-browed, Hid in the shade of a slouch-rim'd hatâ With small gray eyes, of a look as keen As the long, sharp nose that grew between. And I said: 'Tis a sketch of Nature's own, Drawn i' the dark o' the moon, I swear, On a tatter of Fate that the winds have blown Hither and thither and everywhereâ With its keen little sinister eyes of gray, And nose like the beak of a bird of prey! GRANDFATHERS SQUEERS âMy grandfather Squeers,â said The Raggedy Man, As he solemnly lighted his pipe and beganâ âThe most indestructible man, for his years, And the grandest on earth, was my grandfather Squeers! âHe said, when he rounded his threescore-and-ten, âI've the hang of it now and can do it again!â âHe had frozen his heels so repeatedly, he Could tell by them just what the weather would be; âAnd would laugh and declare, âwhile the Almanac would Most falsely prognosticate, he never could!â âSuch a hale constitution had grandfather Squeers That, though he's used ânavyâ for sixty-odd years, âHe still chewed a dime's worth six days of the week, While the seventh he passed with a chew in each cheek. âThen my grandfather Squeers had a singular knack Of sitting around on the small of his back, âWith his legs like a letter Y stretched o'er the grate Wherein 'twas his custom to ex-pec-tor-ate. âHe was fond of tobacco in manifold ways, And would sit on the door-step, of sunshiny days, âAnd smoke leaf-tobacco he'd raised strictly for The pipe he'd used all through the Mexican War.â And The Raggedy Man said, refilling the bowl Of his own pipe and leisurely picking a coal From the stove with his finger and thumb, âYou can see What a tee-nacious habit he's fastened on me! âAnd my grandfather Squeers took a special delight In pruning his corns every Saturday night âWith a horn-handled razor, whose edge he excused By saying 'twas one that his grandfather used; âAnd, though deeply etched in the haft of the same Was the ever-euphonious Wostenholm's name, â'Twas my grandfather's custom to boast of the blade As âa Seth Thomas razorâthe best ever made!â âNo Old Settlers' Meeting, or Pioneers' Fair, Was complete without grandfather Squeers in the chair, âTo lead off the program by telling folks how âHe used to shoot deer where the Court-house stands nowââ âHow âhe felt, of a truth, to live over the past, When the country was wild and unbroken and vast, ââThat the little log cabin was just plenty fine For himself, his companion, and fambly of nine!â ââWhen they didn't have even a pump, or a tin, But drunk surface-water, year out and year in, ââFrom the old-fashioned gourd that was sweeter, by odds, Than the goblets of gold at the lips of the gods!ââ Then The Raggedy Man paused to plaintively say It was clockin' along to'rds the close of the dayâ And he'd ought to get back to his work on the lawn,â Then dreamily blubbered his pipe and went on: âHis teeth were imperfectâmy grandfather owned That he couldn't eat oysters unless they were âbonedâ; âAnd his eyes were so weak, and so feeble of sight, He couldn't sleep with them unless, every night, âHe put on his spectaclesâall he possessed,â Three pairsâwith his goggles on top of the rest. âAnd my grandfather always, retiring at night, Blew down the lamp-chimney to put out the light; âThen he'd curl up on edge like a shaving, in bed, And puff and smoke pipes in his sleep, it is said: âAnd would snore oftentimes, as the legends relate, Till his folks were wrought up to a terrible state,â âThen he'd snort, and rear up, and roll over; and there In the subsequent hush they could hear him chew air. âAnd so glaringly bald was the top of his head That many's the time he has musingly said, âAs his eyes journeyed o'er its reflex in the glass,â âI must set out a few signs of Keep Off the Grass!â âSo remarkably deaf was my grandfather Squeers That he had to wear lightning-rods over his ears âTo even hear thunderâand oftentimes then He was forced to request it to thunder again.â MY LADDIE WI' THE BASHFU' GRACE My laddie wi' the bashfu' grace, That darena spak the tender loe That glints o'er a' thy bonny face Like winter sunset on the snow,â Gin ye wad only tak my hand, And ask, wi' pressure fond and true, My heartâmy heart wad understand, And gie its loe to you. But sin' ye winna spak me free, Or darena tak the langin' tip O ain puir finger,âcome to me In mirk o' nicht and touch my lipâ Then a' the glowin' universe Will bloom wi' stars, and flow'rs, and a', And God's ain sel' abide wi' us, Nor ever gang awa'. A TRESS OF HAIR This tress of hair my sweetheart sent to me, And so I bent above it tenderly And kissed the dainty bow That bound the wisp of sunshine, thrilled forsooth, Because her lips had nestled thereâin truth, She told me so. And I remember, reading that, the flush That fevered all my face, and the heart's hush And hurry in my ears; And how the letter trembled and grew blurred Until my eyes could read no other wordâ For happy tears. This tress of hair! Why, I did hug and hold It here against my heart, and call it gold With Heaven's own luster lit; And I did stroke and smooth its gleaming strands, And pet and fondle it with foolish hands, And talk to it! And now I pray God's blessing may alight Upon the orange flowers she wears to-night. Her featuresâkeep them fair, Dear Lord, but let her lips not quite forget The love they kindled once is gilding yet This tress of hair.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME III THE PASSING OF A HEART O touch me with your handsâ For pity's sake! My brow throbs ever on with such an ache As only your cool touch may take away; And so, I pray You, touch me with your hands! Touchâtouch me with your hands.â Smooth back the hair You once caressed, and kissed, and called so fair That I did dream its gold would wear alway, And lo, to-dayâ O touch me with your hands! Just touch me with your hands, And let them press My weary eyelids with the old caress, And lull me till I sleep. Then go your way, That Death may say: He touched her with his hands. AN OLD-TIMER Here where the wayward stream Is restful as a dream, And where the banks o'erlook A pool from out whose deeps My pleased face upward peeps, I cast my hook. Silence and sunshine blent!â A Sabbath-like content Of wood and wave;âa free- Hand landscape grandly wrought Of Summer's brightest thought And mastery.â For here form, light and shade, And colorâall are laid With skill so rarely fine, The eye may even see The ripple tremblingly Lip at the line. I mark the dragon-fly Flit waveringly by In ever-veering flight, Till, in a hush profound, I see him eddy round The âcork,â andâ'light! Ho! with the boy's faith then Brimming my heart again, And knowing, soon or late, The ânibbleâ yet shall roll Its thrills along the pole, Iâbreathlessâwait. ERE I WENT MAD Ere I went madâ O you may never guess what dreams I had! Such hosts of happy things did come to me. One time, it seemed, I knelt at some one's knee, My wee lips threaded with a strand of prayer, With kinks of kisses in it here and there To stay and tangle it the while I knit A mother's long-forgotten name in it. Be sure, I dreamed it all, but I was glad âEre I went mad! Ere I went mad, I dreamed there came to me a fair-faced lad, Who led me by the wrist where blossoms grew In grassy lands, and where the skies were blue As his own eyes. And he did lisp and sing, And weave me wreaths where I sat marveling What little prince it was that crowned me queen And caught my face so cunningly between His dimple-dinted hands, and kept me glad âEre I went mad! Ere I went mad, Not even winter weather made me sad I dreamed, indeed, the skies were ne'er so dull That his smile might not make them beautiful. And now, it seemed, he had grown O so fair And straight and strong that, when he smoothed my hair, I felt as any lily with drooped head That leans, in fields of grain unharvested, By some lithe stalk of barleyâpure and glad âEre I went mad! Ere I went mad, The last of all the happy dreams I had Was of a peerless kingâa conquerorâ Who crowned me with a kiss, and throned me for One hour! Ah, God of Mercy! what a dream To tincture life with! Yet I made no scream As I awakenedâwith these eyes you see, That may not smile till love comes back to me, And lulls me back to those old dreams I had âEre I went mad! OH, HER BEAUTY Oh, her beauty was such that it dazzled my eyes Like a dreamer's, who, gazing in day-dying skies, Sees the snow of the clouds and the gold of the sun And the blue of the heavens all blended in one Indescribable luster of glorious light, Swooning into the moon of a midsummer night. Oh, her beauty was such that I fancied her hair Was a cloud of the tempest, tied up with a glare Of pale purple lightning, that darted and ran Through the coils like the blood in the veins of a man: And from dark silken billows that girdled her free, Her shoulder welled up like the moon from the sea. Oh, her beauty was such, as I knelt, with the tips Of the fingers uplifted she snatched from my lips, And saw the white flood of her wrath as it dashed O'er the features, that one moment later had flashed From my vision forever, I raised not a knee Till I had thanked God for so rescuing me. THE SUMMER-TIME O the Summer-time to-day Makes my words Jes' flip up and fly away Like the birds! â'Tain't no use to try to sing, With yer language on the wing, Jes' too glad fer anything But to stray Where it may Thue the sunny summer weather of the day! Lordy! what a Summer-time Fer to sing! But my words flops out o' rhyme, And they wing Furder yit beyent the view Than the swallers ever flew, Er a mortal wanted toâ 'Less his eye Struck the sky Ez he kind o' sort o' thought he'd like to fly! Ef I could singâsweet and lowâ And my tongue Could twitter, don't you know,â Ez I sung Of the Summer-time, 'y Jings! All the words and birds and things That kin warble, and hes wings, Would jes' swear And declare That they never heerd sich singin' anywhere! SONG OF PARTING Say farewell, and let me go: Shatter every vow! All the future can bestow Will be welcome now! And if this fair hand I touch I have worshiped overmuch, It was my mistakeâand so, Say farewell, and let me go. Say farewell, and let me go: Murmur no regret, Stay your tear-drops ere they flowâ Do not waste them yet! They might pour as pours the rain, And not wash away the pain:â I have tried them and I know.â Say farewell, and let me go. Say farewell, and let me go: Think me not untrueâ True as truth is, even so I am true to you! If the ghost of love may stay Where my fond heart dies to-day, I am with you alwayâso, Say farewell, and let me go. THE WANDERING JEW The stars are failing, and the sky Is like a field of faded flowers The winds on weary wings go by; The moon hides, and the tempest lowers; And still through every clime and age I wander on a pilgrimage That all men know an idle quest, For that the goal I seek isâREST! I hear the voice of summer streams, And, following, I find the brink Of cooling springs, with childish dreams Returning as I bend to drinkâ But suddenly, with startled eyes, My face looks on its grim disguise Of long gray beard; and so, distressed, I hasten on, nor taste of rest. I come upon a merry group Of children in the dusky wood, Who answer back the owlet's whoop, That laughs as it had understood; And I would pause a little space, But that each happy blossom-face Is like to one His hands have blessed Who sent me forth in search of rest. Sometimes I fain would stay my feet In shady lanes, where huddled kine Couch in the grasses cool and sweet, And lift their patient eyes to mine; But I, for thoughts that ever then Go back to Bethlehem again, Must needs fare on my weary quest, And weep for very need of rest. Is there no end? I plead in vain: Lost worlds nor living answer me. Since Pontius Pilate's awful reign Have I not passed eternity? Have I not drunk the fetid breath Of every fevered phase of death, And come unscathed through every pest And scourge and plague that promised rest? Have I not seen the stars go out That shed their light o'er Galilee, And mighty kingdoms tossed about And crumbled clod-like in the sea? Dead ashes of dead ages blow And cover me like drifting snow, And time laughs on as 'twere a jest That I have any need of rest. THE USED-TO-BE Beyond the purple, hazy trees Of summer's utmost boundaries; Beyond the sandsâbeyond the seasâ Beyond the range of eyes like these, And only in the reach of the Enraptured gaze of Memory, There lies a land, long lost to me,â The land of Used-to-be! A land enchantedâsuch as swung In golden seas when sirens clung Along their dripping brinks, and sung To Jason in that mystic tongue That dazed men with its melodyâ O such a land, with such a sea Kissing its shores eternally, Is the fair Used-to-be. A land where music ever girds The air with belts of singing-birds, And sows all sounds with such sweet words, That even in the low of herds A meaning lives so sweet to me, Lost laughter ripples limpidly From lips brimmed over with the glee Of rare old Used-to-be. Lost laughter, and the whistled tunes Of boyhood's mouth of crescent runes, That rounded, through long afternoons, To serenading plenilunesâ When starlight fell so mistily That, peering up from bended knee, I dreamed 'twas bridal drapery Snowed over Used-to-be. O land of love and dreamy thoughts, And shining fields, and shady spots Of coolest, greenest grassy plots, Embossed with wild forget-me-nots!â And all ye blooms that longingly Lift your fair faces up to me Out of the past, I kiss in ye The lips of Used-to-be. AT UTTER LOAF I An afternoon as ripe with heat As might the golden pippin be With mellowness if at my feet It dropped now from the apple-tree My hammock swings in lazily. II The boughs about me spread a shade That shields me from the sun, but weaves With breezy shuttles through the leaves Blue rifts of skies, to gleam and fade Upon the eyes that only see Just of themselves, all drowsily. III Above me drifts the fallen skein Of some tired spider, looped and blown, As fragile as a strand of rain, Across the air, and upward thrown By breaths of hay-fields newly mownâ So glimmering it is and fine, I doubt these drowsy eyes of mine. IV Far-off and faint as voices pent In mines, and heard from underground, Come murmurs as of discontent, And clamorings of sullen sound The city sends me, as, I guess, To vex me, though they do but bless Me in my drowsy fastnesses. V I have no care. I only know My hammock hides and holds me here In lands of shade a prisoner: While lazily the breezes blow Light leaves of sunshine over me, And back and forth and to and fro I swing, enwrapped in some hushed glee, Smiling at all things drowsily. MY OLD FRIEND You've a manner all so mellow, My old friend, That it cheers and warms a fellow, My old friend, Just to meet and greet you, and Feel the pressure of a hand That one may understand, My old friend. Though dimmed in youthful splendor, My old friend, Your smiles are still as tender, My old friend, And your eyes as true a blue As your childhood ever knew, And your laugh as merry, too, My old friend. For though your hair is faded, My old friend, And your step a trifle jaded, My old friend, Old Time, with all his lures In the trophies he secures, Leaves young that heart of yours, My old friend. And so it is you cheer me, My old friend, For to know you and be near you, My old friend, Makes my hopes of clearer light, And my faith of surer sight, And my soul a purer white, My old friend. KISSING THE ROD O heart of mine, we shouldn't Worry so! What we've missed of calm we couldn't Have, you know! What we've met of stormy pain, And of sorrow's driving rain, We can better meet again, If it blow! We have erred in that dark hour We have known, When our tears fell with the shower, All alone!â Were not shine and shower blent As the gracious Master meant?â Let us temper our content With His own. For, we know, not every morrow Can be sad; So, forgetting all the sorrow We have had, Let us fold away our fears, And put by our foolish tears, And through all the coming years Just be glad. THE RIVAL I so loved once, when Death came by I hid Away my face, And all my sweetheart's tresses she undid To make my hiding-place. The dread shade passed me thus unheeding; and I turned me then To calm my loveâkiss down her shielding hand And comfort her again. And lo! she answered not: And she did sit All fixedly, With her fair face and the sweet smile of it, In love with Death, not me. THE LIGHT OF LOVE SONG The clouds have deepened o'er the night Till, through the dark profound, The moon is but a stain of light, And all the stars are drowned; And all the stars are drowned, my love, And all the skies are drear; But what care we for light above, If light of love is here? The wind is like a wounded thing That beats about the gloom With baffled breast and drooping wing, And wail of deepest doom; And wail of deepest doom, my love; But what have we to fear From night, or rain, or winds above, With love and laughter here? LET SOMETHING GOOD BE SAID When over the fair fame of friend or foe The shadow of disgrace shall fall, instead Of words of blame, or proof of thus and so, Let something good be said. Forget not that no fellow-being yet May fall so low but love may lift his head: Even the cheek of shame with tears is wet, If something good be said. No generous heart may vainly turn aside In ways of sympathy; no soul so dead But may awaken strong and glorified, If something good be said. And so I charge ye, by the thorny crown, And by the cross on which the Saviour bled, And by your own soul's hope of fair renown, Let something good be said! THE OLD HAND-ORGAN Harsh-voiced it was, and shrill and high, With hesitating stops and stutters, As though the vagrant melody, Playing so long about the gutters, Had been infected with some low Malignant type of vertigo. A stark-eyed man that stared the sun Square in the face, and without winking; His soldier cap pushed back, and one Scarred hand that grasped the crank, unshrinkingâ But from the jingling discord made By shamefaced pennies as he played. HOME AT NIGHT When chirping crickets fainter cry, And pale stars blossom in the sky, And twilight's gloom has dimmed the bloom And blurred the butterfly: When locust-blossoms fleck the walk, And up the tiger-lily stalk The glowworm crawls and clings and falls And glimmers down the garden-walls: When buzzing things, with double wings Of crisp and raspish flutterings, Go whizzing by so very nigh One thinks of fangs and stings:â O then, within, is stilled the din Of crib she rocks the baby in, And heart and gate and latch's weight Are liftedâand the lips of Kate. A DREAM OF INSPIRATION To loll back, in a misty hammock, swung From tip to tip of a slim crescent moon That gems some royal-purple night of Juneâ To dream of songs that never have been sung Since the first stars were stilled and God was young And Heaven as lonesome as a lonesome tune: To lie thus, lost to earth, with lids aswoon; By curious, cool winds back and forward flung, With fluttering hair, blurred eyes, and utter ease Adrift like lazy blood through every vein; And then,âthe pulse of unvoiced melodies Timing the raptured sense to some refrain That knows nor words, nor rhymes, nor euphonies, Save Fancy's hinted chime of unknown seas. THE PIPER'S SON In olden days there dwelt a piper's son, Hight Thomas, who, belike from indigence, Or utter lack of virtuous preference Of honorable means of thrift, did, one Weak hour of temptationâ(weaker none!)â Put by ye promptings of his better sense, And rashly gat him o'er a neighbor's fence Wherein ye corner was a paling run About a goodly pig; and thence he lured, All surreptitiously, ye hapless beast, And had it slaughtered, salted down, and curedâ Yea, even tricked and garnished for ye feast, Ere yet ye red-eyed Law had him immured, And round and soundly justice-of-ye-peaced. HIS LAST PICTURE The skies have grown troubled and dreary; The clouds gather fold upon fold; The hand of the painter is weary And the pencil has dropped from its hold: The easel still leans in the grasses, And the palette beside on the lawn, But the rain o'er the sketch as it passes Weeps lowâfor the artist is gone. The flowers whose fairy-like features Smiled up in his own as he wrought, And the leaves and the ferns were his teachers, And the tints of the sun what they taught; The low-swinging vines, and the mossesâ The shadow-filled boughs of the trees, And the blossomy spray as it tosses The song of the bird to the breeze. The silent white laugh of the lily He learned; and the smile of the rose Glowed back on his spirit until he Had mastered the blush as it glows; And his pencil has touched and caressed them, And kissed them, through breaths of perfume, To the canvas that yet shall have blessed them With years of unwithering bloom. Then come!âLeave his palette and brushes And easel there, just as his hand Has left them, ere through the dark hushes Of death, to the shadowy land, He wended his way, happy-hearted As when, in his youth, his rapt eyes Swept the pathway of Fame where it started, To where it wound into the skies. A VARIATION I am tired of this! Nothing else but loving! Nothing else but kiss and kiss, Coo, and turtle-doving! Can't you change the order some? Hate me just a littleâcome! Lay aside your âdears,â âDarlings,â âkings,â and âprinces!â Call me knave, and dry your tearsâ Nothing in me winces,â Call me something low and baseâ Something that will suit the case! Wish I had your eyes And their drooping lashes! I would dry their teary lies Up with lightning-flashesâ Make your sobbing lips unsheathe All the glitter of your teeth! Can't you lift one wordâ With some pang of laughterâ Louder than the drowsy bird Crooning 'neath the rafter? Just one bitter word, to shriek Madly at me as I speak! How I hate the fair Beauty of your forehead! How I hate your fragrant hair! How I hate the torrid Touches of your splendid lips, And the kiss that drips and drips! Ah, you pale at last! And your face is lifted Like a white sail to the blast, And your hands are shifted Into fists: and, towering thus, You are simply glorious! Now before me looms Something more than human; Something more than beauty blooms In the wrath of Womanâ Something to bow down before Reverently and adore. THERE IS A NEED There is a need for every ache or pain That falls unto our lot. No heart may bleed That resignation may not heal again And teach usâthere's a need.â There is a need for every tear that drips Adown the face of sorrow. None may heed, But weeping washes whiter on the lips Our prayersâand there's a need. There is a need for weariness and dearth Of all that brings delight. At topmost speed Of pleasure sobs may break amid our mirth Unheardâand there's a need. There is a need for all the growing load Of agony we bear as years succeed; For lo, the Master's footprints in the road Before usâThere's a need. TO A SKULL Turn your face this way; I'm not weary of itâ Every hour of every day More and more I love itâ Grinning in that jolly guise Of bare bones and empty eyes! Was this hollow dome, Where I tap my finger, Once the spirit's narrow homeâ Where you loved to linger, Hiding, as to-day are we, From the selfsame destiny? O'er and o'er again Have I put the queryâ Was existence so in vain That you look so cheery?â Death of such a benefit That you smile, possessing it? Did you throbbing brow Tire of all the flutter Of such fancyings as now You, at last, may utter In that grin so grimly bland Only death can understand? Has the shallow glee Of old dreams of pleasure Left you ever wholly free To float out, at leisure, O'er the shoreless, trackless trance Of unsounded circumstance? Only this I read In your changeless features,â You, at least, have gained a meed Held from living creatures: You have naught to ask.âBeside, You do grin so satisfied! THE VOICES Down in the night I hear them: The Voicesâunknownâunguessed,â That whisper, and lisp, and murmur, And will not let me rest.â Voices that seem to question, In unknown words, of me, Of fabulous ventures, and hopes and dreams Of this and the World to be. Voices of mirth and music, As in sumptuous homes; and sounds Of mourning, as of gathering friends In country burial-grounds. Cadence of maiden voicesâ Their lovers' blent with these; And of little children singing, As under orchard trees. And often, up from the chaos Of my deepest dreams, I hear Sounds of their phantom laughter Filling the atmosphere: They call to me from the darkness; They cry to me from the gloom, Till I start sometimes from my pillow And peer through the haunted room; When the face of the moon at the window Wears a pallor like my own, And seems to be listening with me To the low, mysterious tone,â The low, mysterious clamor Of voices that seem to be Striving in vain to whisper Of secret things to me;â Of a something dread to be warned of; Of a rapture yet withheld; Or hints of the marvelous beauty Of songs unsyllabled. But ever and ever the meaning Falters and fails and dies, And only the silence quavers With the sorrow of my sighs. And I answer:âO Voices, ye may not Make me to understand Till my own voice, mingling with you, Laughs in the Shadow-land. MY HENRY He's jes' a great, big, awk'ard, hulkin' Feller,âhumped, and sort o' sulkin'- Like, and ruther still-appearin'â Kind-as-ef he wuzn't keerin' Whether school helt out er notâ That's my Henry, to a dot!

Don't go much on prophesyin', But last night whilse I wuz fryin' Supper, with that man a-pitchin' Little Marthy round the kitchen, Think-says-I, âThem baby's eyes Is my Henry's, jes' p'cise!â LOVE'S AS BROAD AS LONG Looky here!âyou fellersâyou Poets I'm a-talkin' to,â Allus rhymin', right er wrong, 'Bout your âlittleâ love, and âlongââ 'Pears to me 'at nary one Of you fellers gits much fun Out o' lovin'âtryin' to fit Out some fool-receet fer it!â Love's as broad as long!

Love's as broad as long! LOCKERBIE STREET Such a dear little street it is, nestled away From the noise of the city and heat of the day, In cool shady coverts of whispering trees, With their leaves lifted up to shake hands with the breeze Which in all its wide wanderings never may meet With a resting-place fairer than Lockerbie Street! There is such a relief, from the clangor and din Of the heart of the town, to go loitering in Through the dim, narrow walks, with the sheltering shade Of the trees waving over the long promenade, And littering lightly the ways of our feet With the gold of the sunshine of Lockerbie Street. And the nights that come down the dark pathways of dusk, With the stars in their tresses, and odors of musk In their moon-woven raiments, bespangled with dews, And looped up with lilies for lovers to use In the songs that they sing to the tinkle and beat Of their sweet serenadings through Lockerbie Street. O my Lockerbie Street! You are fair to be seenâ Be it noon of the day, or the rare and serene Afternoon of the nightâyou are one to my heart, And I love you above all the phrases of art, For no language could frame and no lips could repeat My rhyme-haunted raptures of Lockerbie Street. THE OLD, OLD WISH Last night, in some lost mood of meditation, The while my dreamy vision ranged the far Unfathomable arches of creation, I saw a falling star: And as my eyes swept round the path it embered With the swift-dying glory of its glow, With sudden intuition I remembered A wish of long agoâ A wish that, were it madeâso ran the fancy Of credulous young lover and of lassâ As fell a star, by some strange necromancy, Would surely come to pass. And, of itself, the wish, reiterated A thousand times in youth, flashed o'er my brain, And, like the star, as soon obliterated, Dropped into night again. For my old heart had wished for the unending Devotion of a little maid of nineâ And that the girl-heart, with the woman's blending, Might be forever mine. And so it was, with eyelids raised, and weighty With ripest clusterings of sorrow's dew, I cried aloud through Heaven: âO little Katie! When will my wish come true?â A LIFE-LESSON There! little girl; don't cry! They have broken your doll, I know; And your tea-set blue, And your play-house, too, Are things of the long ago; But childish troubles will soon pass by.â There! little girl; don't cry! There! little girl; don't cry! They have broken your slate, I know; And the glad, wild ways Of your schoolgirl days Are things of the long ago; But life and love will soon come by.â There! little girl; don't cry! There! little girl; don't cry! They have broken your heart, I know; And the rainbow gleams Of your youthful dreams Are things of the long ago; But Heaven holds all for which you sigh.â There! little girl; don't cry! A WATER-COLOR Low hidden in among the forest trees An artist's tilted easel, ankle-deep In tousled ferns and mosses, and in these A fluffy water-spaniel, half asleep Beside a sketch-book and a fallen hatâ A little wicker flask tossed into that. A sense of utter carelessness and grace Of pure abandon in the slumb'rous scene,â As if the June, all hoydenish of face, Had romped herself to sleep there on the green, And brink and sagging bridge and sliding stream Were just romantic parcels of her dream. UNKNOWN FRIENDS O friends of mine, whose kindly words come to me Voiced only in lost lisps of ink and pen, If I had power to tell the good you do me, And how the blood you warm goes laughing through me, My tongue would babble baby-talk again. And I would toddle round the world to meet youâ Fall at your feet, and clamber to your knees And with glad, happy hands would reach and greet you, And twine my arms about you, and entreat you For leave to weave a thousand rhymes like theseâ A thousand rhymes enwrought of nought but presses Of cherry-lip and apple-cheek and chin, And pats of honeyed palms, and rare caresses, And all the sweets of which as Fancy guesses She folds away her wings and swoons therein. THE SONG OF YESTERDAY I But yesterday I looked away O'er happy lands, where sunshine lay In golden blots, Inlaid with spots Of shade and wild forget-me-nots. My head was fair With flaxen hair, And fragrant breezes, faint and rare, And, warm with drouth From out the south, Blew all my curls across my mouth. And, cool and sweet, My naked feet Found dewy pathways through the wheat; And out again Where, down the lane, The dust was dimpled with the rain. II But yesterday!â Adream, astray, From morning's red to evening's gray, O'er dales and hills Of daffodils And lorn sweet-fluting whippoorwills. I knew nor cares Nor tears nor prayersâ A mortal god, crowned unawares With sunsetâand A scepter-wand Of apple-blossoms in my hand! The dewy blue Of twilight grew To purple, with a star or two Whose lisping rays Failed in the blaze Of sudden fireflys through the haze. III But yesterday I heard the lay Of summer birds, when I, as they With breast and wing, All quivering With life and love, could only sing. My head was leant Where, with it, blent A maiden's, o'er her instrument; While all the night, From vale to height, Was filled with echoes of delight. And all our dreams Were lit with gleams Of that lost land of reedy streams, Along whose brim Forever swim Pan's lilies, laughing up at him. IV But yesterday! ... O blooms of May, And summer rosesâwhere away? O stars above; And lips of love, And all the honeyed sweets thereof!â O lad and lass, And orchard pass, And briered lane, and daisied grass! O gleam and gloom, And woodland bloom, And breezy breaths of all perfume!â No more for me Or mine shall be Thy rapturesâsave in memory,â No moreâno moreâ Till through the Door Of Glory gleam the days of yore. AN END Go away from meâdo! I am tired of you!â That I loved you last May isn't this season, too; And, you know, every spring there's a new bird to sing In the nest of the old, and a ghost on the wing! Now, don't you assert that I'm simply a flirtâ And it's babyish for you to say that I hurt, And my words are a dart, when they're only a part Of your own fickle nature committed to heart. It was all a mistake, and I don't want to make The silly thing over for your silly sakeâ Though I really once may have been such a dunce As to fancy you loved me, some far-away months. So, go awayâdo! I am tired clean through, And you can't make me even feel sorry for youâ For, with us, every spring there's a new bird to sing In the nest of the old, and a ghost on the wing. HER CHOICE âMy love or hateâchoose which you will,â He says; and o'er the window-sill The rose-bush, jostled by the wind, Rasps at his hands, close-clenched behind, As she makes answer, smiling clear As is the day,ââYour hate, my dear!â An interval of silenceâso Intensely still, the cattle's low Across the field's remotest rim Comes like a near moan up to him, While o'er the open sill once more The rose-bush rasps him as before. Then, with an impulse strange and new To him, he says: â'Tis wise of you To choose thusâfor by such a choice You lose so little, that,ââhis voice Breaks suddenlyâthe rose-bush stirsâ But ah! his hands areâsafe in hers. OUR OWN They walk here with us, hand in hand; We gossip, knee by knee; They tell us all that they have plannedâ Of all their joys to be,â And, laughing, leave us: And, to-day, All desolate we cry Across wide waves of voiceless gravesâ Good-by! Good-by! Good-by! THE DRUM O the drum! There is some Intonation in thy grum Monotony of utterance that strikes the spirit dumb, As we hear Through the clear And unclouded atmosphere, Thy palpitating syllables roll in upon the ear! There's a part Of the art Of thy music-throbbing heart That thrills a something in us that awakens with a start, And in rhyme With the chime And exactitude of time, Goes marching on to glory to thy melody sublime. And the guest Of the breast That thy rolling robs of rest Is a patriotic spirit as a Continental dressed; And he looms From the glooms Of a century of tombs, And the blood he spilled at Lexington in living beauty blooms. And his eyes Wear the guise Of a purpose pure and wise, As the love of them is lifted to a something in the skies That is bright Red and white, With a blur of starry light, As it laughs in silken ripples to the breezes day and night. There are deep Hushes creep O'er the pulses as they leap, As thy tumult, fainter growing, on the silence falls asleep, While the prayer Rising there Wills the sea and earth and air As a heritage to Freedom's sons and daughters everywhere. Then, with sound As profound As the thunderings resound, Come thy wild reverberations in a throe that shakes the ground, And a cry Flung on high, Like the flag it flutters by, Wings rapturously upward till it nestles in the sky. O the drum! There is some Intonation in thy grum Monotony of utterance that strikes the spirit dumb, As we hear, Through the clear And unclouded atmosphere, Thy palpitating syllables roll in upon the ear! A CASE IN P'INT We don't go much on lawin' Here in around the mines?â Well, now, you're jest hurrahin' Like the wind amongst the pines! Of course we allus aim to Give âthe prisonerâ a chanceâ Though sometimes a jury's game to Ring a verdict in advance! What wuz his nameâthis feller 'At stold the Jedge's mare Last spring?âwuz tryin' to sell her Down here at Rip and Tear, When âFaro Billâ dropped on him, And bagged him, sound and good And biznesslike, dog-gone him, As the constable a-could! Well, anyway, his trial Wuz a case in p'int:âHe pled âNot guiltyââa denial 'At his attorney said Could be substantiated On the grounds, 'at when the mare Wuz âstold,â as claimed and stated, The defendant wuzn't square,â But he'd be'n a testifyin', Round the raw edge of a spree At Stutsman's bar, a-tryin' To hold one drink in three, To âJim-jamsâ; and he reckoned 'At his client's moral tone Could not be classed as second To the Jedge'sâer his own. âThat savin'-clause is timely,â Says the Jedge, a-turnin' back To color as sublimely As I've seed him turn a jack.â âBut,â says he to the defendant, âEf you didn't âstealâ the mare I'll ask ef your attendant âPharos William,â didn't swear âYou wuzn't âfullâ when captured?â Then, a-drawin' of his gun, The Jedge went on, enraptured With the trail 'at he'd begun,â âI'll tax your re-collection To enquire ef you know That hoss left my protection On'y jes' five hours ago?â âIn consequence, it follers, No man as drunk as youâ And I'll bet a hundred dollars To the opposition's two!â Could sober to the beauty Of the standerd you present This writin'âhence my duty Plainly isâto circumventââ And afore the jury knowed it, Bang! his gun went!ââAnd I'll ask,â He went on, as he th'owed it Up to finish out his task, âEf it's mortal?ââthen, betrayin' Some emotion, with a bow, He closed by simply sayin'â âYou can take the witness now!â OLE BULL Dead; in Bergen, Norway; August 18, 1880 The minstrel's mystic wand Has fallen from his hand; Stilled is the tuneful shell; The airs he used to play For us but yesterday Have failed and died away In sad farewell. ForgiveâO noble heart, Whose pure and gracious art Enraptured, all these years, Sang sweet, and sweeter yet Above all sounds that fret, And all sobs of regretâ Forgive our tears! Forgive us, weeping thus That thou art gone from usâ Because thy song divine, Too, with the master, gone, Leaves us to listen on In silence till the dawn That now is thine. A WRAITH OF SUMMER-TIME In its color, shade and shine, 'Twas a summer warm as wine, With an effervescent flavoring of flowered bough and vine, And a fragrance and a taste Of ripe roses gone to waste, And a dreamy sense of sun- and moon- and starlight interlaced. 'Twas a summer such as broods O'er enchanted solitudes, Where the hand of Fancy leads us through voluptuary moods, And with lavish love outpours All the wealth of out-of-doors, And woos our feet o'er velvet paths and honeysuckle floors. 'Twas a summer-time long dead,â And its roses, white and red, And its reeds and water-lilies down along the river-bed,â O they all are ghostly thingsâ For the ripple never sings, And the rocking lily never even rustles as it rings! JACK THE GIANT-KILLER Bad Boy's Version Tell you a storyâan' it's a fac':â Wunst wuz a little boy, name wuz Jack, An' he had sword an' buckle an' strap Maked of gold, an' a â'visibul capâ; An' he killed Gi'nts 'at et whole cowsâ Th' horns an' allâan' pigs an' sows! But Jack, his golding sword wuz, oh! So awful sharp 'at he could go An' cut th' ole Gi'nts clean in two 'Fore 'ey knowed what he wuz goin' to do! An' one ole Gi'nt, he had four Heads, an' name wuz âBumbleboreââ An' he wuz feared o' Jackâ'cause he, Jack, he killed sixâfiveâtenâthree, An' all o' th' uther ole Gi'nts but him: An' thay wuz a place Jack haf to swim 'Fore he could git t' ole âBumbleboreââ Nen thay wuz âgriffunsâ at the door: But Jack, he thist plunged in an' swum Clean acrost; an' when he come To th' uther side, he thist put on His â'visibul cap,â an' nen, dog-gone! You couldn't see him at all!âAn' so He slewed the âgriffunsââboff, you know! Nen wuz a horn hunged over his head, High on th' wall, an' words 'at read,â âWhoever kin this trumput blow Shall cause the Gi'nt's overth'ow!â An' Jack, he thist reached up an' blowed The stuffin' out of it! an' th'owed Th' castul gates wide open, an' Nen tuk his gold sword in his han', An' thist marched in t' ole âBumblebore,â An', 'fore he knowed, he put 'bout four Heads on himâan' chopped 'em off, too!â Wisht 'at I'd been Jack!âdon't you? REQUIESCAT Be it life, be it death, there is nearing The dawn of a glorious day, When the murmurs of doubt we are hearing In silence shall dwindle away; And the hush and content that we covetâ The rest that we need, and the sleep That abides with the eyelids that love it, Shall come as we weep. We shall listen no more to the sobbing Of sorrowing lips, and the sound In our pillows at night of the throbbing Of feverish hearts will have found The quiet beyond understanding, The rush and the moan of the rain, That shall beat on the shingles, demanding Admittance in vain. The hand on the dial shall number The hours unmarked; and the bell Shall waken us not from the slumber That knows neither tolling of knell Nor the peals of glad melody showered Like roses of song o'er the pave Where the bride and the groom walk their flowered Green way to the grave. In that dawn, when it breaks, we shall wonder No more why the heavens send back To our prayers but the answer of thunder, And the lightning-scrawl, writ on the black Of the storm in a language no mortal May read till his questioning sight Shall have pierced through the innermost portal Of death to the light. AT SEA Yea, we go down to sea in shipsâ But Hope remains behind, And Love, with laughter on his lips, And Peace, of passive mind; While out across the deeps of night, With lifted sails of prayer, We voyage off in quest of light, Nor find it anywhere. O Thou who wroughtest earth and sea, Yet keepest from our eyes The shores of an eternity In calms of Paradise, Blow back upon our foolish quest With all the driving rain Of blinding tears and wild unrest, And waft us home again! SOMEP'N COMMON-LIKE Somep'n 'at's common-like, and good And plain, and easy understood; Somep'n 'at folks like me and you Kin understand, and relish, too, And find some sermint in 'at hits The spot, and sticks and benefits. We don't need nothin' extry fine; 'Cause, take the run o' minds like mine, And we'll go more on good horse-sense Than all your flowery eloquence; And we'll jedge best of honest acts By Nature's statement of the facts. So when you're wantin' to express Your misery, er happiness, Er anything 'at's wuth the time O' telling in plain talk er rhymeâ Jes' sort o' let your subject run As ef the Lord wuz listenun. BLIND You think it is a sorry thing That I am blind. Your pitying Is welcome to me; yet indeed, I think I have but little need Of it. Though you may marvel much That we, who see by sense of touch And taste and hearing, see things you May never look upon; and true Is it that even in the scent Of blossoms we find something meant No eyes have in their faces read, Or wept to see interpreted. And you might think it strange if now I told you you were smiling. How Do I know that? I hold your handâ Its language I can understandâ Give both to me, and I will show You many other things I know. Listen: We never met before Till now?âWell, you are something lower Than five-feet-eight in height; and you Are slender; and your eyes are blueâ Your mother's eyesâyour mother's hairâ Your mother's likeness everywhere Save in your walkâand that is quite Your father's; nervous.âAm I right? I thought so. And you used to sing, But have neglected everything Of vocalismâthough you may Still thrum on the guitar, and play A little on the violin,â I know that by the callus in The finger-tips of your left handâ And, by the by, though nature planned You as most men, you are, I see, âLeft-handed,â too,âthe mystery Is clear, though,âyour right arm has been Broken, to âbreakâ the left one in. And so, you see, though blind of sight, I still have ways of seeing quite Too well for you to sympathize Excessively, with your good eyes.â Though once, perhaps, to be sincere, Within the whole asylum here, From cupola to basement hall, I was the blindest of them all! Let us move farther down the walkâ The man here waiting hears my talk, And is disturbed; besides, he may Not be quite friendly anyway. In factâ(this will be far enough; Sit down)âthe man just spoken of Was once a friend of mine. He came For treatment here from Burlingameâ A rich though brilliant student there, Who read his eyes out of repair, And groped his way up here, where we Became acquainted, and where he Met one of our girl-teachers, and, If you'll believe me, asked her hand In marriage, though the girl was blind As I amâand the girl declined. Odd, wasn't it? Look, you can see Him waiting there. Fine, isn't he? And handsome, eloquently wide And high of brow, and dignified With every outward grace, his sight Restored to him, clear and bright As day-dawn; waiting, waiting still For the blind girl that never will Be wife of his. How do I know? You will recall a while ago I told you he and I were friends. In all that friendship comprehends, I was his friend, I swear! why, now, Remembering his love, and how His confidence was all my own, I hear, in fancy, the low tone Of his deep voice, so full of pride And passion, yet so pacified With his affliction, that it seems An utterance sent out of dreams Of saddest melody, withal So sorrowfully musical It was, and is, must ever beâ But I'm digressing, pardon me. I knew not anything of love In those days, but of that above All worldly passion,âfor my artâ Music,âand that, with all my heart And soul, blent in a love too great For words of mine to estimate. And though among my pupils she Whose love my friend sought came to me, I only knew her fingers' touch Because they loitered overmuch In simple scales, and needs must be Untangled almost constantly. But she was bright in other ways, And quick of thought; with ready plays Of wit, and with a voice as sweet To listen to as one might meet In any oratorioâ And once I gravely told her so,â And, at my words, her limpid tone Of laughter faltered to a moan, And fell from that into a sigh That quavered all so wearily, That I, without the tear that crept Between the keys, had known she wept; And yet the hand I reached for then She caught away, and laughed again. And when that evening I strolled With my old friend, I, smiling, told Him I believed the girl and he Were matched and mated perfectly: He was so noble; she, so fair Of speech, and womanly of air; He, strong, ambitious; she, as mild And artless even as a child; And with a nature, I was sure, As worshipful as it was pure And sweet, and brimmed with tender things Beyond his rarest fancyings. He stopped me solemnly. He knew, He said, how good, and just, and true Was all I said of her; but as For his own virtues, let them pass, Since they were nothing to the one That he had set his heart upon; For but that morning she had turned Forever from him. Then I learned That for a month he had delayed His going from us, with no aid Of hope to hold him,âmeeting still Her ever-firm denial, till Not even in his new-found sight He found one comfort or delight. And as his voice broke there, I felt The brother-heart within me melt In warm compassion for his own That throbbed so utterly alone. And then a sudden fancy hit Along my brain; and coupling it With a belief that I, indeed, Might help my friend in his great need, I warmly said that I would go Myself, if he decided so, And see her for himâthat I knew My pleadings would be listened to Most seriously, and that she Should love him, listening to me. Go; bless me! And that was the lastâ The last time his warm hand shut fast Within my ownâso empty since, That the remembered finger-prints I've kissed a thousand times, and wet Them with the tears of all regret! I know not how to rightly tell How fared my quest, and what befell Me, coming in the presence of That blind girl, and her blinder love. I know but little else than that Above the chair in which she sat I leantâreached for, and found her hand, And held it for a moment, and Took up the otherâheld them bothâ As might a friend, I will take oath: Spoke leisurely, as might a man Praying for no thing other than He thinks Heaven's justice:âShe was blind, I said, and yet a noble mind Most truly loved her; one whose fond Clear-sighted vision looked beyond The bounds of her infirmity, And saw the woman, perfectly Modeled, and wrought out pure and true And lovable. She quailed, and drew Her hands away, but closer still I caught them. âRack me as you will!â She cried out sharplyââCall me âblindââ Love ever isâI am resigned! Blind is your friend; as blind as he Am Iâbut blindest of the threeâ Yea, blind as deathâyou will not see My love for you is killing me!â There is a memory that may Not ever wholly fade away From out my heart, so bright and fair The light of it still glimmers there. Why, it did seem as though my sight Flamed back upon me, dazzling white And godlike. Not one other word Of hers I listened for or heard, But I saw songs sung in her eyes Till they did swoon up drowning-wise, As my mad lips did strike her own, And we flashed one, and one alone! Ah! was it treachery for me To kneel there, drinking eagerly That torrent-flow of words that swept Out laughingly the tears she wept?â Sweet words! O sweeter far, maybe, Than light of day to those that see,â God knows, who did the rapture send To me, and hold it from my friend. And we were married half a year Ago.âAnd he isâwaiting here, Heedless of thatâor anything, But just that he is lingering To say good-by to her, and bowâ As you may see him doing now,â For there's her footstep in the hall; God bless her!âhelp him!âsave us all! JUST AS OF OLD Just as of old! The world rolls on and on; The day dies into nightânight into dawnâ Dawn into duskâthrough centuries untold.â Just as of old. Time loiters not. The river ever flows, Its brink or white with blossoms or with snows; Its tide or warm with spring or winter cold: Just as of old. Lo! where is the beginning, where the end Of living, loving, longing? Listen, friend!â God answers with a silence of pure goldâ Just as of old. THE PRAYER PERFECT Dear Lord! kind Lord! Gracious Lord! I pray Thou wilt look on all I love, Tenderly to-day! Weed their hearts of weariness; Scatter every care Down a wake of angel-wings Winnowing the air. Bring unto the sorrowing All release from pain; Let the lips of laughter Overflow again; And with all the needy O divide, I pray, This vast treasure of content That is mine to-day! MONSIEUR LE SECRETAIRE [JOHN CLARK RIDPATH] Mon cher Monsieur le Secretaire, Your song flits with me everywhere; It lights on Fancy's prow and sings Me on divinest voyagings: And when my ruler love would fain Be laid upon itâhigh again It mounts, and hugs itself from me With rapturous wingsâstill dwindlinglyâ On!âon! till but a ghost is there Of song, Monsieur le Secretaire! A PHANTOM Little baby, you have wandered far away, And your fairy face comes back to me to-day, But I can not feel the strands Of your tresses, nor the play Of the dainty velvet-touches of your hands. Little baby, you were mine to hug and hold; Now your arms cling not about me as of oldâ O my dream of rest come true, And my richer wealth than gold, And the surest hope of Heaven that I knew! O for the lisp long silent, and the tone Of merriment once mingled with my ownâ For the laughter of your lips, And the kisses plucked and thrown In the lavish wastings of your finger-tips! Little baby, O as then, come back to me, And be again just as you used to be, For this phantom of you stands All too cold and silently, And will not kiss nor touch me with its hands. WHAT REDRESS I pray you, do not use this thing For vengeance; but if questioning What wound, when dealt your humankind, Goes deepest,âsurely he will find Who wrongs you, loving him no lessâ There's nothing hurts like tenderness. A LOST LOVE 'Twas a summer ago when he left me hereâ A summer of smiles, with never a tear Till I said to him, with a sob, my dear,â Good-by, my lover; good-by! For I loved him, O as the stars love night! And my cheeks for him flashed red and white When first he called me his Heart's delight,â Good-by, my lover; good-by! The touch of his hand was a thing divine As he sat with me in the soft moonshine And drank of my love as men drink wine,â Good-by, my lover; good-by! And never a night as I knelt in prayer, In thought as white as our own souls were, But in fancy he came and he kissed me there,â Good-by, my lover; good-by! But nowâah, now! what an empty place My whole heart is!âOf the old embrace And the kiss I loved there lives no traceâ Good-by, my lover; good-by! He sailed not over the stormy sea, And he went not down in the wavesânot heâ But O, he is lostâfor he married meâ Good-by, my lover; good-by! LET US FORGET Let us forget. What matters it that we Once reigned o'er happy realms of long ago, And talked of love, and let our voices low, And ruled for some brief sessions royally? What if we sung, or laughed, or wept maybe? It has availed not anything, and so Let it go by that we may better know How poor a thing is lost to you and me. But yesterday I kissed your lips, and yet Did thrill you not enough to shake the dew From your drenched lidsâand missed, with no regret, Your kiss shot back, with sharp breaths failing you: And so, to-day, while our worn eyes are wet With all this waste of tears, let us forget! THE SHOEMAKER Thou Poet, who like any lark, Dost whet thy beak and trill From misty morn till murky dark, Nor ever pipe thy fill: Hast thou not, in thy cheery note, One poor chirp to conferâ One verseful twitter to devote Unto the Shoe-ma-ker? At early dawn he doth peg in His noble work and brave; And eke from cark and worldly sin He seeketh soles to save; And all day long, with quip and song, Thus stitcheth he the way Our feet may know the right from wrong Nor ever go astray. Soak kip in mind the Shoe-ma-ker, Nor slight his lasting fame: Alway he waxeth tenderer In warmth of our acclaim;â Ay, more than any artisan We glory in his art Who ne'er, to help the under man, Neglects the upper part. But toe the mark for him, and heel Respond to thee in kineâ Or kidâor calf, shouldst thou reveal A taste so superfine: Thus let him jestâjoin in his laughâ Draw on his stock, and be A shoer'd there's no rival half- Sole liberal as he. Then, Poet, hail the Shoe-ma-ker For all his goodly deeds,â Yea, bless him free for booting theeâ The first of all thy needs! And when at last his eyes grow dim, And nerveless drops his clamp, In golden shoon pray think of him Upon his latest tramp. IN THE CORRIDOR Ah! at last alone, love! Now the band may play Till its sweetest tone, love, Swoons and dies away! They who most will miss us We're not caring forâ Who of them could kiss us In the corridor? Had we only known, dear, Ere this long delay, Just how all alone, dear, We might waltz away, Then for hours, like this, love, We are longing for, We'd have still to kiss, love, In the corridor! Nestle in my heart, love; Hug and hold me closeâ Time will come to part, love, Ere a fellow knows; There! the Strauss is endedâ Whirl across the floor, Isn't waltzing splendid In the corridor? SUSPENSE A woman's figure, on a ground of night Inlaid with sallow stars that dimly stare Down in the lonesome eyes, uplifted there As in vague hope some alien lance of light Might pierce their woe. The tears that blind her sightâ The salt and bitter blood of her despairâ Her hands toss back through torrents of her hair And grip toward God with anguish infinite. And O the carven mouth, with all its great Intensity of longing frozen fast In such a smile as well may designate The slowly murdered heart, that, to the last, Conceals each newer wound, and back at Fate Throbs Love's eternal lieââLo, I can wait!â A NONSENSE RHYME Ringlety-jing! And what will we sing? Some little crinkety-crankety thing That rhymes and chimes, And skips, sometimes, As though wound up with a kink in the spring. Grunkety-krung! And chunkety-plung! Sing the song that the bullfrog sung,â A song of the soul Of a mad tadpole That met his fate in a leaky bowl: And it's O for the first false wiggle he made In a sea of pale pink lemonade! And it's O for the thirst Within him pent, And the hopes that burst As his reason wentâ When his strong arm failed and his strength was spent! Sing, O sing Of the things that cling, And the claws that clutch and the fangs that stingâ Till the tadpole's tongue And his tail upflung Quavered and failed with a song unsung! O the dank despair in the rank morass, Where the crawfish crouch in the cringing grass, And the long limp rune of the loon wails on For the mad, sad soul Of a bad tadpole Forever lost and gone! Jinglety-jee! And now we'll see What the last of the lay shall be, As the dismal tip of the tune, O friends, Swoons away and the long tale ends. And it's O and alack! For the tangled legs And the spangled back Of the green grig's eggs, And the unstrung strain Of the strange refrain That the winds wind up like a strand of rain! And it's O, Also, For the ears wreathed low, Like a laurel-wreath on the lifted brow Of the frog that chants of the why and how, And the wherefore too, and the thus and so Of the wail he weaves in a woof of woe! Twangle, then, with your wrangling strings, The tinkling links of a thousand things! And clang the pang of a maddening moan Till the Echo, hid in a land unknown, Shall leap as he hears, and hoot and hoo Like the wretched wraith of a Whoopty-Doo! LOUELLA WAINIE Louella WAINIE! where are you? Do you not hear me as I cry? Dusk is falling; I feel the dew; And the dark will be here by and by: I hear no thing but the owl's hoo-hoo! Louella Wainie! where are you? Hand in hand to the pasture bars We came loitering, Lou and I, Long ere the fireflies coaxed the stars Out of their hiding-place on high. O how sadly the cattle moo! Louella Wainie! where are you? Laughingly we parted hereâ âI will go this way,â said she, âAnd you will go that way, my dearââ Kissing her dainty hand at meâ And the hazels hid her from my view. Louella Wainie! where are you? Is there ever a sadder thing Than to stand on the farther brink Of twilight, hearing the marsh-frogs sing? Nothing could sadder be, I think! And ah! how the night-fog chills one through. Louella Wainie! where are you? Water-lilies and oozy leavesâ Lazy bubbles that bulge and stare Up at the moon through the gloom it weaves Out of the willows waving there! Is it despair I am wading through? Louella Wainie! where are you? Louella Wainie, listen to me, Listen, and send me some reply, For so will I call unceasingly Till death shall answer me by and byâ Answer, and help me to find you too! Louella Wainie! where are you? FOR YOU For you, I could forget the gay Delirium of merriment, And let my laughter die away In endless silence of content. I could forget, for your dear sake, The utter emptiness and ache Of every loss I ever knew.â What could I not forget for you? I could forget the just deserts Of mine own sins, and so erase The tear that burns, the smile that hurts, And all that mars and masks my face. For your fair sake I could forget The bonds of life that chafe and fret, Nor care if death were false or true.â What could I not forget for you? What could I not forget? Ah me! One thing I know would still abide Forever in my memory, Though all of love were lost besideâ I yet would feel how first the wine Of your sweet lips made fools of mine Until they sung, all drunken throughâ âWhat could I not forget for you?â MY FIRST SPECTACLES At first I laughedâfor it was quite An oddity to see My reflex looking from the glass Through spectacles at me. But as I gazed I really found They so improved my sight That many wrinkles in my face Were mixed with my delight; And many streaks of silver, too, Were gleaming in my hair, With quite a hint of baldness that I never dreamed was there. And as I readjusted them And winked in slow surprise, A something like a mist had come Between them and my eyes. And, peering vainly still, the old Optician said to me, The while he took them from my nose And wiped them hastily: âJes' now, of course, your eyes is apt To water someâbut where Is any man's on earth that won't The first he has to wear?â THE TEXT The text: Love thou thy fellow man! He may have sinned;âOne proof indeed, He is thy fellow, reach thy hand And help him in his need! Love thou thy fellow man. He may Have wronged theeâthen, the less excuse Thou hast for wronging him. Obey What he has dared refuse! Love thou thy fellow manâfor, be His life a light or heavy load, No less he needs the love of thee To help him on his road. AN OUT-WORN SAPPHO How tired I am! I sink down all alone Here by the wayside of the Present. Lo, Even as a child I hide my face and moanâ A little girl that may no farther go: The path above me only seems to grow More rugged, climbing still, and ever briered With keener thorns of pain than these below; And O the bleeding feet that falter so And are so very tired! Why, I have journeyed from the far-off Lands Of Babyhoodâwhere baby-lilies blew Their trumpets in mine ears, and filled my hands With treasures of perfume and honey-dew, And where the orchard shadows ever drew Their cool arms round me when my cheeks were fired With too much joy, and lulled mine eyelids to, And only let the starshine trickle through In sprays, when I was tired! Yet I remember, when the butterfly Went flickering about me like a flame That quenched itself in roses suddenly, How oft I wished that I might blaze the same, And in some rose-wreath nestle with my name, While all the world looked on it and admired.â Poor moth!âAlong my wavering flight toward fame The winds drive backward, and my wings are lame And broken, bruised and tired! I hardly know the path from those old times; I know at first it was a smoother one Than this that hurries past me now, and climbs So high, its far cliffs even hide the sun And shroud in gloom my journey scarce begun. I could not do quite all the world requiredâ I could not do quite all I should have done, And in my eagerness I have outrun My strengthâand I am tired. ... Just tired! But when of old I had the stay Of mother-hands, O very sweet indeed It was to dream that all the weary way I should but follow where I now must leadâ For long ago they left me in my need, And, groping on alone, I tripped and mired Among rank grasses where the serpents breed In knotted coils about the feet of speed.â There first it was I tired. And yet I staggered on, and bore my load Right gallantly: The sun, in summer-time, In lazy belts came slipping down the road To woo me on, with many a glimmering rhyme Rained from the golden rim of some fair clime, That, hovering beyond the clouds, inspired My failing heart with fancies so sublime I half forgot my path of dust and grime, Though I was growing tired. And there were many voices cheering me: I listened to sweet praises where the wind Went laughing o'er my shoulders gleefully And scattering my love-songs far behind;â Until, at last, I thought the world so kindâ So rich in all my yearning soul desiredâ So generousâso loyally inclined, I grew to love and trust it. ... I was blindâ Yea, blind as I was tired! And yet one hand held me in creature-touch: And O, how fain it was, how true and strong, How it did hold my heart up like a crutch, Till, in my dreams, I joyed to walk along The toilsome way, contented with a songâ 'Twas all of earthly things I had acquired, And 'twas enough, I feigned, or right or wrong, Since, binding me to manâa mortal thongâ It stayed me, growing tired. ... Yea, I had e'en resigned me to the strait Of earthly rulershipâhad bowed my head Acceptant of the master-mindâthe great One loverâlord of all,âthe perfected Kiss-comrade of my soul;âhad stammering said My prayers to him;âallâall that he desired I rendered sacredly as we were wed.â Nayânay!â'twas but a myth I worshipÃ¨d.â AndâGod of love!âhow tired! For, O my friends, to lose the latest graspâ To feel the last hope slipping from its holdâ To feel the one fond hand within your clasp Fall slack, and loosen with a touch so cold Its pressure may not warm you as of old Before the light of love had thus expiredâ To know your tears are worthless, though they rolled Their torrents out in molten drops of gold.â God's pity! I am tired! And I must rest.âYet do not say âShe died,â In speaking of me, sleeping here alone. I kiss the grassy grave I sink beside, And close mine eyes in slumber all mine own: Hereafter I shall neither sob nor moan Nor murmur one complaint;âall I desired, And failed in life to find, will now be knownâ So let me dream. Good night! And on the stone Say simply: She was tired. WILLIAM BROWN âHe bore the name of William Brownââ His name, at least, did not go down With him that day He went the way Of certain death where duty lay. He looked his fate full in the faceâ He saw his watery resting-place Undaunted, and With firmer hand Held others' hopes in sure command.â The hopes of full three hundred livesâ Aye, babes unborn, and promised wives! âThe odds are dread,â He must have said, âHere, God, is one poor life instead.â No time for praying overmuchâ No time for tears, or woman's touch Of tenderness, Or child's caressâ His last âGod bless them!â stopped at âblessââ Thus man and engine, nerved with steel, Clasped iron hands for woe or weal, And so went down Where dark waves drown All but the name of William Brown. THE NINE LITTLE GOBLINS They all climbed up on a high board-fenceâ Nine little goblins, with green-glass eyesâ Nine little goblins that had no sense, And couldn't tell coppers from cold mince pies; And they all climbed up on the fence, and satâ And I asked them what they were staring at. And the first one said, as he scratched his head With a queer little arm that reached out of his ear And rasped its claws in his hair so redâ âThis is what this little arm is fer!â And he scratched and stared, and the next one said, âHow on earth do you scratch your head?â And he laughed like the screech of a rusty hingeâ Laughed and laughed till his face grew black; And when he choked, with a final twinge Of his stifling laughter, he thumped his back With a fist that grew on the end of his tail Till the breath came back to his lips so pale. And the third little goblin leered round at meâ And there were no lids on his eyes at all,â And he clucked one eye, and he says, says he, âWhat is the style of your socks this fall?â And he clapped his heelsâand I sighed to see That he had hands where his feet should be. Then a bald-faced goblin, gray and grim, Bowed his head, and I saw him slip His eyebrows off, as I looked at him, And paste them over his upper lip; And then he moaned in remorseful painâ âWouldâAh, would I'd me brows again!â And then the whole of the goblin band Rocked on the fence-top to and fro, And clung, in a long row, hand in hand, Singing the songs that they used to knowâ Singing the songs that their grandsires sung In the goo-goo days of the goblin-tongue. And ever they kept their green-glass eyes Fixed on me with a stony stareâ Till my own grew glazed with a dread surmise, And my hat whooped up on my lifted hair, And I felt the heart in my breast snap to, As you've heard the lid of a snuff-box do. And they sang: âYou're asleep! There is no board-fence, And never a goblin with green-glass eyes!â 'Tis only a vision the mind invents After a supper of cold mince pies.â And you're doomed to dream this way,â they said,â âAnd you shan't wake up till you're clean plum dead!â WHY Why are they writtenâall these lovers' rhymes? I catch faint perfumes of the blossoms white That maidens drape their tresses with at night And, through dim smiles of beauty and the din Of the musicians' harp and violin, I hear, enwound and blended with the dance, The voice whose echo is this utterance,â Why are they writtenâall these lovers' rhymes? Why are they writtenâall these lovers' rhymes? I see but vacant windows, curtained o'er With webs whose architects forevermore Race up and down their slender threads to bind The buzzing fly's wings whirless, and to wind The living victim in his winding sheet.â I shudder, and with whispering lips repeat, Why are they writtenâall these lovers' rhymes? Why are they writtenâall these lovers' rhymes? What will you have for answer?âShall I say That he who sings the merriest roundelay Hath neither joy nor hope?âand he who sings The lightest, sweetest, tenderest of things But utters moan on moan of keenest pain, So aches his heart to ask and ask in vain, Why are they writtenâall these lovers' rhymes? THE TOUCH OF LOVING HANDS IMITATED Light falls the rain-drop on the fallen leaf, And light o'er harvest-plain and garnered sheafâ But lightlier falls the touch of loving hands. Light falls the dusk of mild midsummer night, And light the first star's faltering lance of light On glimmering lawns,âbut lightlier loving hands. And light the feathery flake of early snows, Or wisp of thistle-down that no wind blows, And light the dew,âbut lightlier loving hands. Light-falling dusk, or dew, or summer rain, Or down of snow or thistleâall are vain,â Far lightlier falls the touch of loving hands. THE OLD SCHOOL-CHUM He puts the poem by, to say His eyes are not themselves to-day! A sudden glamour o'er his sightâ A something vague, indefiniteâ An oft-recurring blur that blinds The printed meaning of the lines, And leaves the mind all dusk and dim In swimming darknessâstrange to him! It is not childishness, I guess,â Yet something of the tenderness That used to wet his lashes when A boy seems troubling him again;â The old emotion, sweet and wild, That drove him truant when a child, That he might hide the tears that fell Above the lessonââLittle Nell.â And so it is he puts aside The poem he has vainly tried To follow; and, as one who sighs In failure, through a poor disguise Of smiles, he dries his tears, to say His eyes are not themselves to-day. A CUP OF TEA I have sipped, with drooping lashes, Dreamy draughts of Verzenay; I have flourished brandy-smashes In the wildest sort of way; I have joked with âTom and Jerryâ Till âwee hours ayont the twalââ But I've found my tea the very Safest tipple of them all! 'Tis a mystical potation That exceeds in warmth of glow And divine exhilaration All the drugs of long agoâ All of old magicians' potionsâ Of Medea's philtered spellsâ Or of fabled isles and oceans Where the Lotos-eater dwells! Though I've reveled o'er late lunches With blasÃ© dramatic stars, And absorbed their wit and punches And the fumes of their cigarsâ Drank in the latest story, With a cocktail either end,â I have drained a deeper glory In a cup of tea, my friend. Green, Black, Moyune, Formosa, Congou, Amboy, Pingsueyâ No odds the name it knowsâah, Fill a cup of it for me! And, as I clink my china Against your goblet's brim, My tea in steam shall twine a Fragrant laurel round its rim. TO THE SERENADER Tinkle on, O sweet guitar, Let the dancing fingers Loiter where the low notes are Blended with the singer's: Let the midnight pour the moon's Mellow wine of glory Down upon him through the tune's Old romantic story! I am listening, my love, Through the cautious lattice, Wondering why the stars above All are blinking at us; Wondering if his eyes from there Catch the moonbeam's shimmer As it lights the robe I wear With a ghostly glimmer. Lilt thy song, and lute away In the wildest fashion:â Pour thy rippling roundelay O'er the heights of passion!â Flash it down the fretted strings Till thy mad lips, missing All but smothered whisperings, Press this rose I'm kissing. WHAT A DEAD MAN SAID Hear what a dead man said to me. His lips moved not, and the eyelids lay Shut as the leaves of a white rose may Ere the wan bud blooms out perfectly; And the lifeless hands they were stiffly crossed As they always cross them over the breast When the soul goes nude and the corpse is dressed; And over the form, in its long sleep lost, From forehead down to the pointed feet That peaked the foot of the winding-sheet, Pallid patience and perfect rest.â It was the voice of a dream, may be, But it seemed that the dead man said to me: âI, indeed, am the man that died Yesternightâand you weep for this; But, lo, I am with you, side by side, As we have walked when the summer sun Made the smiles of our faces one, And touched our lips with the same warm kiss. Do not doubt that I tell you trueâ I am the man you once called friend, And caught my hand when I came to you, And loosed it only because the end Of the path I walked of a sudden stoppedâ And a dead man's hand must needs be droppedâ And Iâthough it's strange to think so nowâ I have wept, as you weep for me, And pressed hot palms to my aching brow And moaned through the long night ceaselessly. Yet have I lived to forget my pain, As you will live to be glad againâ Though never so glad as this hour am I, Tasting a rapture of delight Vast as the heavens are infinite, And dear as the hour I came to die. Living and loving, I dreamed my cup Brimmed sometimes, and with marvelings I have lifted and tipped it up And drunk to the dregs of all sweet things. Living, 'twas but a dream of blissâ Now I realize all it is; And now my only shadow of grief Is that I may not give relief Unto those living and dreaming on, And woo them graveward, as I have gone, And show death's loveliness,âfor they Shudder and shrink as they walk this way, Never dreaming that all they dread Is their purest delight when dead.â Thus it was, or it seemed to be, That the voice of the dead man spoke to me. A TEST 'Twas a test I designed, in a quiet conceit Of myself, and the thoroughly fixed and complete Satisfaction I felt in the utter control Of the guileless young heart of the girl of my soul. Soâwe parted. I said it were better we shouldâ That she could forget meâI knew that she could; For I never was worthy so tender a heart, And so for her sake it were better to part. She averted her gaze, and she sighed and looked sad As I held out my handâfor the ring that she hadâ With the bitterer speech that I hoped she might be Resigned to look up and be happy with me. 'Twas a test, as I saidâbut God pity your grief, At a moment like this when a smile of relief Shall leap to the lips of the woman you prize, And no mist of distress in her glorious eyes. A SONG FOR CHRISTMAS Chant me a rhyme of Christmasâ Sing me a jovial song,â And though it is filled with laughter, Let it be pure and strong. Let it be clear and ringing, And though it mirthful be, Let a low, sweet voice of pathos Run through the melody. Sing of the hearts brimmed over With the story of the dayâ Of the echo of childish voices That will not die away.â Of the blare of the tasseled bugle, And the timeless clatter and beat Of the drum that throbs to muster Squadrons of scampering feet. But O let your voice fall fainter, Till, blent with a minor tone, You temper your song with the beauty Of the pity Christ hath shown: And sing one verse for the voiceless; And yet, ere the song be done, A verse for the ears that hear not, And a verse for the sightless one: For though it be time for singing A merry Christmas glee, Let a low, sweet voice of pathos Run through the melody. SUN AND RAIN All day the sun and rain have been as friends, Each vying with the other which shall be Most generous in dowering earth and sea With their glad wealth, till each, as it descends, Is mingled with the other, where it blends In one warm, glimmering mist that falls on me As once God's smile fell over Galilee. The lily-cup, filled with it, droops and bends Like some white saint beside a sylvan shrine In silent prayer; the roses at my feet, Baptized with it as with a crimson wine, Gleam radiant in grasses grown so sweet, The blossoms lift, with tenderness divine, Their wet eyes heavenward with these of mine. WITH HER FACE With her face between his hands! Was it any wonder she Stood atiptoe tremblingly? As his lips along the strands Of her hair went lavishing Tides of kisses, such as swing Love's arms to like iron bands.â With her face between his hands! And the handsâthe hands that pressed The glad faceâAh! where are they? Folded limp, and laid away Idly over idle breast? He whose kisses drenched her hair, As he caught and held her there, In Love's alien, lost lands, With her face between his hands? Was it long and long ago, When her face was not as now, Dim with tears? nor wan her brow As a winter-night of snow? Nay, anointing still the strands Of her hair, his kisses flow Flood-wise, as she dreaming stands, With her face between his hands. MY NIGHT Hush! hush! list, heart of mine, and hearken low! You do not guess how tender is the Night, And in what faintest murmurs of delight Her deep, dim-throated utterances flow Across the memories of long-ago! Hark! do your sense catch the exquisite Staccatos of a bird that dreams he sings? Nay, then, you hear not rightly,â'tis a blur Of misty love-notes, laughs and whisperings The Night pours o'er the lips that fondle her, And that faint breeze, filled with all fragrant sighs,â That is her breath that quavers lover-wiseâ O blessed sweetheart, with thy swart, sweet kiss, Baptize me, drown me in black swirls of bliss! THE HOUR BEFORE THE DAWN The hour before the dawn! O ye who grope therein, with fear and dread And agony of soul, be comforted, Knowing, ere long, the darkness will be gone, And down its dusky aisles the light be shed; Therefore, in utter trust, fare onâfare on, This hour before the dawn! THE OLD YEAR AND THE NEW I As one in sorrow looks upon The dead face of a loyal friend, By the dim light of New Year's dawn I saw the Old Year end. Upon the pallid features lay The dear old smileâso warm and bright Ere thus its cheer had died away In ashes of delight. The hands that I had learned to love With strength of passion half divine, Were folded now, all heedless of The emptiness of mine. The eyes that once had shed their bright Sweet looks like sunshine, now were dull, And ever lidded from the light That made them beautiful. II The chimes of bells were in the air, And sounds of mirth in hall and street, With pealing laughter everywhere And throb of dancing feet: The mirth and the convivial din Of revelers in wanton glee, With tunes of harp and violin In tangled harmony. But with a sense of nameless dread, I turned me, from the merry face Of this newcomer, to my dead; And, kneeling there a space, I sobbed aloud, all tearfully:â By this dear face so fixed and cold, O lord, let not this New Year be As happy as the old! GOOD-BY, OLD YEAR Good-by, Old year! Good-by! We have been happyâyou and I; We have been glad in many ways; And now, that you have come to die, Remembering our happy days, 'Tis hard to say, âGood-byâ Good-by, Old Year! Good-by!â Good-by, Old Year! Good-by! We have seen sorrowâyou and Iâ Such hopeless sorrow, grief and care, That now, that you have come to die, Remembering our old despair, 'Tis sweet to say, âGood-byâ Good-by, Old Year! Good-by!â AS CREATED There's a space for good to bloom in Every heart of man or woman,â And however wild or human, Or however brimmed with gall, Never heart may beat without it; And the darkest heart to doubt it Has something good about it After all. SOMEDAY Someday:âSo many tearful eyes Are watching for thy dawning light; So many faces toward the skies Are weary of the night! So many failing prayers that reel And stagger upward through the storm, And yearning hands that reach and feel No pressure true and warm. So many hearts whose crimson wine Is wasted to a purple stain And blurred and streaked with drops of brine Upon the lips of Pain. Oh, come to them!âthese weary ones! Or if thou still must bide a while, Make stronger yet the hope that runs Before thy coming smile: And haste and find them where they waitâ Let summer-winds blow down that way, And all they long for, soon or late, Bring round to them, Someday. FALSE AND TRUE One said: âHere is my hand to lean upon As long as you may need it.â And one said: âBelieve me true to you till I am dead.â And one, whose dainty way it was to fawn About my face, with mellow fingers drawn Most soothingly o'er brow and drooping head, Sighed tremulously: âTill my breath is fled Know I am faithful!â ... Now, all these are gone And many like to themâand yet I make No bitter moan above their grassy gravesâ Alas! they are not dead for me to take Such sorry comfort!âbut my heart behaves Most graciously, since one who never spake A vow is true to me for true love's sake. A BALLAD FROM APRIL I am dazed and bewildered with living A life but an intricate skein Of hopes and despairs and thanksgiving Wound up and unraveled againâ Till it seems, whether waking or sleeping, I am wondering ever the while At a something that smiles when I'm weeping, And a something that weeps when I smile. And I walk through the world as one dreaming Who knows not the night from the day, For I look on the stars that are gleaming, And lo, they have vanished away: And I look on the sweet-summer daylight, And e'en as I gaze it is fled, And, veiled in a cold, misty, gray light, The winter is there in its stead. I feel in my palms the warm fingers Of numberless friendsâand I look, And lo, not a one of them lingers To give back the pleasure he took; And I lift my sad eyes to the faces All tenderly fixed on my own, But they wither away in grimaces That scorn me, and leave me alone. And I turn to the woman that told me Her love would live on until deathâ But her arms they no longer enfold me, Though barely the dew of her breath Is dry on the forehead so pallid That droops like the weariest thing O'er this most inharmonious ballad That ever a sorrow may sing. So I'm dazed and bewildered with living A life but an intricate skein Of hopes and despairs and thanksgiving Wound up and unraveled againâ Till it seems, whether waking or sleeping, I am wondering ever the while At a something that smiles when I'm weeping, And a something that weeps when I smile.

And we love 'em as the bees Loves the blossoms on the trees, A-ridin' and a-rompin' in the breeze! One's got her Mammy's eyesâ Soft and blue as Apurl-skiesâ With the same sort of a smile, likeâYes, and mouth about her size,â Dimples, too, in cheek and chin, 'At my lips jes' wallers in, A-goin' to work, er gittin' home ag'in. And the otherâWell, they say That he's got his Daddy's way O' bein' ruther soberfied, er ruther extry gay,â That he eether cries his best, Er he laughs his howlin'estâ Like all he lacked was buttons and a vest!

O we love 'em as the bees Loves the blossoms on the trees, A-ridin' and a-rompin' in the breeze! THE ORCHARD LANDS OF LONG AGO The orchard lands of Long Ago! O drowsy winds, awake, and blow The snowy blossoms back to me, And all the buds that used to be! Blow back along the grassy ways Of truant feet, and lift the haze Of happy summer from the trees That trail their tresses in the seas Of grain that float and overflow The orchard lands of Long Ago! Blow back the melody that slips In lazy laughter from the lips That marvel much if any kiss Is sweeter than the apple's is. Blow back the twitter of the birdsâ The lisp, the titter, and the words Of merriment that found the shine Of summer-time a glorious wine That drenched the leaves that loved it so, In orchard lands of Long Ago! O memory! alight and sing Where rosy-bellied pippins cling, And golden russets glint and gleam, As, in the old Arabian dream, The fruits of that enchanted tree The glad Aladdin robbed for me! And, drowsy winds, awake and fan My blood as when it overran A heart ripe as the apples grow In orchard lands of Long Ago! BRUDDER SIMS Dah's Brudder Sims! Dast slam yo' Bible shet An' lef' dat man aloneâkase he's de boss Ob all de preachahs ev' I come across!

Her form is shrunken, and a pair Of crutches leaning at her side Are crossed like homely hands in prayer At quiet eventide. Her eyesâtwo lustrous, weary thingsâ Have learned a look that ever aches, Despite the ready jinglings The passer's penny makes. And, noting this, I pause and muse If any precious promise touch This heart that has so much to lose If dreaming overmuchâ And, in a vision, mistily Her future womanhood appears,â A picture framed with agony And drenched with ceaseless tearsâ Where never lover comes to claim The hand outheld so yearninglyâ The laughing babe that lisps her name Is but a fantasy! And, brooding thus, all swift and wild A daring fancy, strangely sweet, Comes o'er me, that the crippled child That crouches at my feetâ Has found her head a resting-place Upon my shoulder, while my kiss Across the pallor of her face Leaves crimson trails of bliss. WHILE THE MUSICIAN PLAYED O it was but a dream I had While the musician played!â And here the sky, and here the glad Old ocean kissed the glade; And here the laughing ripples ran, And here the roses grew That threw a kiss to every man That voyaged with the crew. Our silken sails in lazy folds Drooped in the breathless breeze: As o'er a field of marigolds Our eyes swam o'er the seas; While here the eddies lisped and purled Around the island's rim, And up from out the underworld We saw the mermen swim. And it was dawn and middle-day And midnightâfor the moon On silver rounds across the bay Had climbed the skies of June,â And there the glowing, glorious king Of day ruled o'er his realm, With stars of midnight glittering About his diadem. The sea-gull reeled on languid wing In circles round the mast, We heard the songs the sirens sing As we went sailing past; And up and down the golden sands A thousand fairy throngs Flung at us from their flashing hands The echoes of their songs. O it was but a dream I had While the musician played!â For here the sky, and here the glad Old ocean kissed the glade; And here the laughing ripples ran, And here the roses grew That threw a kiss to every man That voyaged with the crew. FAITH The sea was breaking at my feet, And looking out across the tide, Where placid waves and heaven meet, I thought me of the Other Side. For on the beach on which I stood Were wastes of sands, and wash, and roar, Low clouds, and gloom, and solitude, And wrecks, and ruinsânothing more. âO, tell me if beyond the sea A heavenly port there is!â I cried, And back the echoes laughingly âThere is! there is!â replied. BE OUR FORTUNES AS THEY MAY Be our fortunes as they may, Touched with loss or sorrow, Saddest eyes that weep to-day May be glad to-morrow. Yesterday the rain was here, And the winds were blowingâ Sky and earth and atmosphere Brimmed and overflowing. But to-day the sun is out, And the drear November We were then so vexed about Now we scarce remember. Yesterday you lost a friendâ Bless your heart and love it!â For you scarce could comprehend All the aching of it;â But I sing to you and say: Let the lost friend sorrowâ Here's another come to-day, Others may to-morrow. A HINT OF SPRING 'Twas but a hint of Springâfor still The atmosphere was sharp and chill, Save where the genial sunshine smote The shoulders of my overcoat, And o'er the snow beneath my feet Laid spectral fences down the street. My shadow, even, seemed to be Elate with some new buoyancy, And bowed and bobbed in my advance With trippingest extravagance, And, when the birds chirpt out somewhere, It seemed to wheel with me and stare. Above I heard a rasping stirâ And on a roof the carpenter Was perched, and prodding rusty leaves From out the choked and dripping eavesâ And some one, hammering about, Was taking all the windows out. Old scraps of shingles fell before The noisy mansion's open door; And wrangling children raked the yard, And labored much, and laughed as hard, And fired the burning trash I smelt And sniffed againâso good I felt! LAST NIGHTâAND THIS Last nightâhow deep the darkness was! And well I knew its depths, because I waded it from shore to shore, Thinking to reach the light no more. She would not even touch my hand.â The winds rose and the cedars fanned The moon out, and the stars fled back In heaven and hidâand all was black! But ah! To-night a summons came, Signed with a tear-drop for a name,â For as I wondering kissed it, lo, A line beneath it told me so. And nowâthe moon hangs over me A disk of dazzling brilliancy, And every star-tip stabs my sight With splintered glitterings of light! LITTLE GIRLY-GIRL Little Girly-Girl, of you Still forever I am dreaming.â Laughing eyes of limpid blueâ Tresses glimmering and gleaming Like glad waters running over Shelving shallows, rimmed with clover, Trembling where the eddies whirl, Gurgling, âLittle Girly-Girl!â For your name it came to me Down the brink of brooks that brought it Out of Paradiseâand weâ Love and Iâwe, leaning, caught it From the ripples romping nigh us, And the bubbles bumping by us Over shoals of pebbled pearl, Lilting, âLittle Girly-Girl!â That was long and long ago, But in memory the tender Winds of summer weather blow, And the roses burst in splendor; And the meadow's grassy billows Break in blossoms round the willows Where the currents curve and curl, Calling, âLittle Girly-Girl!â CLOSE THE BOOK Close the book, and leave the tale All unfinished. It is best: Brighter fancy will not fail To relate the rest. We have read it on and on, Till each character, in sooth, By the master-touches drawn, Is a living truth. Leave it so, and let us sit, With the volume laid awayâ Cut no other leaf of it, But as Fancy may.â Then the friends that we have met In its pages will endure, And the villain, even yet, May be white and pure. Close the book, and leave the tale All unfinished. It is best: Brighter fancy will not fail To relate the rest. THE MOTHER SAINTED Fair girl, fond wife, and dear Young mother, sleeping here So quietly,â Tell us what dream is thineâ What miracle divine Is wrought in thee! Onceâwas it yesterday, Or but one hour away?â The folded hands Were quick to greet our ownâ Nowâare they God's alone? Who understands? Who, bending low to fold The fingers as of old In pressure warm, But muses,ââSurely she Will reach one touch to me, And break the charm!â And yet she does not stir;â Such silence lies on her We hear the drip Of tear-drops as we press Our kisses answerless On brow and lip. Not e'en the yearning touch Of lips she loved so much She made their breath One with her own, will she Give answer to and be Wooed back from death. And though he kneel and plead Who was her greatest need, And on her cheek Lay the soft baby-face In its old resting-place, She will not speak. So brave she was, and goodâ In worth of womanhood So like the snowâ She, smiling, gave her life To blend the name of wife With mother.âSo, God sees in her a worth Too great for this dull earth, And, beckoning, stands At Heaven's open gate Where all His angels wait With welcoming hands. Then, like her, reconciled, O parent, husband, child, And mourning friend,â Smile out as smiles the light Of day above the night, Andâwait the end. THE LOST THRILL I grow so weary, someway, of all things That love and loving have vouchsafed to me, Since now all dreamed-of sweets of ecstacy Am I possessed of: The caress that clingsâ The lips that mix with mine with murmurings No language may interpret, and the free, Unfettered brood of kisses, hungrily Feasting in swarms on honeyed blossomings Of passion's fullest flowerâFor yet I miss The essence that alone makes love divineâ The subtle flavoring no tang of this Weak wine of melody may here define:â A something found and lost in the first kiss A lover ever poured through lips of mine. REACH YOUR HAND TO ME Reach your hand to me, my friend, With its heartiest caressâ Sometime there will come an end To its present faithfulnessâ Sometime I may ask in vain For the touch of it again, When between us land or sea Holds it ever back from me. Sometime I may need it so, Groping somewhere in the night, It will seem to me as though Just a touch, however light, Would make all the darkness day, And along some sunny way Lead me through an April-shower Of my tears to this fair hour. O the present is too sweet To go on forever thus! Round the corner of the street Who can say what waits for us?â Meetingâgreeting, night and day, Faring each the selfsame wayâ Still somewhere the path must endâ Reach your hand to me, my friend! WE MUST GET HOME We must get home! How could we stray like this?â So far from home, we know not where it is,â Only in some fair, apple-blossomy place Of children's facesâand the mother's faceâ We dimly dream it, till the vision clears Even in the eyes of fancy, glad with tears. We must get homeâfor we have been away So long, it seems forever and a day! And O so very homesick we have grown, The laughter of the world is like a moan In our tired hearing, and its song as vain,â We must get homeâwe must get home again! We must get home! With heart and soul we yearn To find the long-lost pathway, and return!... The child's shout lifted from the questing band Of old folk, faring weary, hand in hand, But faces brightening, as if clouds at last Were showering sunshine on us as they passed. We must get home: It hurts so, staying here, Where fond hearts must be wept out tear by tear, And where to wear wet lashes means, at best, When most our lack, the least our hope of restâ When most our need of joy, the more our painâ We must get homeâwe must get home again! We must get homeâhome to the simple thingsâ The morning-glories twirling up the strings And bugling color, as they blared in blue- And-white o'er garden-gates we scampered through; The long grape-arbor, with its under-shade Blue as the green and purple overlaid. We must get home: All is so quiet there: The touch of loving hands on brow and hairâ Dim rooms, wherein the sunshine is made mildâ The lost love of the mother and the child Restored in restful lullabies of rain,â We must get homeâwe must get home again! The rows of sweetcorn and the China beans Beyond the lettuce-beds where, towering, leans The giant sunflower in barbaric pride Guarding the barn-door and the lane outside; The honeysuckles, midst the hollyhocks, That clamber almost to the martin-box. We must get home, where, as we nod and drowse, Time humors us and tiptoes through the house, And loves us best when sleeping baby-wise, With dreamsânot tear-dropsâbrimming our clenched eyes,â Pure dreams that know nor taint nor earthly stainâ We must get homeâwe must get home again! We must get home! There only may we find The little playmates that we left behind,â Some racing down the road; some by the brook; Some droning at their desks, with wistful look Across the fields and orchardsâfarther still Where laughs and weeps the old wheel at the mill. We must get home! The willow-whistle's call Trills crisp and liquid as the waterfallâ Mocking the trillers in the cherry-trees And making discord of such rhymes as these, That know nor lilt nor cadence but the birds First warbledâthen all poets afterwards. We must get home; and, unremembering there All gain of all ambition otherwhere, Restâfrom the feverish victory, and the crown Of conquest whose waste glory weighs us down.â Fame's fairest gifts we toss back with disdainâ We must get homeâwe must get home again! We must get home againâwe mustâwe must!â (Our rainy faces pelted in the dust) Creep back from the vain quest through endless strife To find not anywhere in all of life A happier happiness than blest us then. ... We must get homeâwe must get home again! MABEL Sweet little face, so full of slumber nowâ Sweet lips unlifted now with any kissâ Sweet dimpled cheek and chin, and snowy brow,â What quietude is this? O speak! Have you forgotten, yesterday, How gladly you came running to the gate To meet us in the old familiar way, So joyousâso elateâ So filled with wildest glee, yet so serene With innocence of song and childish chat, With all the dear caresses in betweenâ Have you forgotten that? Have you forgotten, knowing gentler charms, The boisterous love of one you ran to greet When you last met, who caught you in his arms And kissed you, in the street? Not very many days have passed since then, And yet between that kiss and him there lies No pathway of returnâunless again, In streets of Paradise, Your eager feet come twinkling down the gold Of some bright thoroughfare ethereal, To meet and greet him there just as of old.â Till then, farewellâfarewell. AT DUSK A something quiet and subdued In all the faces that we meet; A sense of rest, a solitude O'er all the crowded street; The very noises seem to be Crude utterings of harmony, And all we hear, and all we see, Has in it something sweet. Thoughts come to us as from a dream Of some long-vanished yesterday; The voices of the children seem Like ours, when young as they; The hand of Charity extends To meet Misfortune's, where it blends, Veiled by the duskâand oh, my friends, Would it were dusk alway! ANOTHER RIDE FROM GHENT TO AIX We sprang for the side-holtsâmy gripsack and Iâ It dangledâI dangledâwe both dangled by. âGood speed!â cried mine host, as we landed at lastâ âSpeed?â chuckled the watch we went lumbering past; Behind shut the switch, and out through the rear door I glared while we waited a half hour more. I had missed the express that went thundering down Ten minutes before to my next lecture town, And my only hope left was to catch this âwild freight,â Which the landlord remarked was âmost luckily lateâ But the twenty miles distance was easily done, If they run half as fast as they usually run!â Not a word to each otherâwe struck a snail's paceâ Conductor and brakeman ne'er changing a placeâ Save at the next watering-tank, where they all Got outâstrolled aboutâcut their names on the wall, Or listlessly loitered on down to the pile Of sawed wood just beyond us, to doze for a while. 'Twas high noon at starting, but while we drew near âArcadyâ I said, âWe'll not make it, I fear! I must strike Aix by eight, and it's three o'clock now; Let me stoke up that engine, and I'll show you how!â At which the conductor, with patience sublime, Smiled up from his novel with, âPlenty of time!â At âTrask,â as we jolted stock-still as a stone, I heard a cow bawl in a five o'clock tone; And the steam from the saw-mill looked misty and thin, And the snarl of the saw had been stifled within: And a frowzy-haired boy, with a hat full of chips, Came out and stared up with a smile on his lips. At âBooneville,â I groaned, âCan't I telegraph on?â No! Why? â'Cause the telegraph-man had just gone To visit his folks in Almoââand one heard The sharp snap of my teeth through the throat of a word, That I dragged for a mile and a half up the track, And strangled it there, and came skulkingly back. Again we were off. It was twilight, and more, As we rolled o'er a bridge where beneath us the roar Of a river came up with so wooing an air I mechanic'ly strapped myself fast in my chair As a brakeman slid open the door for more light, Saying: âCaptain, brace up, for your town is in sight!â âHow they'll greet me!ââand all in a momentââche-wang!â And the train stopped again, with a bump and a bang. What was it? âThe section-hands, just in advance.â And I spit on my hands, and I rolled up my pants, And I clumb like an imp that the fiends had let loose Up out of the depths of that deadly caboose. I ran the train's lengthâI lept safe to the groundâ And the legend still lives that for five miles around They heard my voice hailing the hand-car that yanked Me aboard at my bidding, and gallantly cranked, As I groveled and clung, with my eyes in eclipse, And a rim of red foam round my rapturous lips. Then I cast loose my ulsterâeach ear-tab let fallâ Kicked off both my shoesâlet go arctics and allâ Stood up with the boysâleanedâpatted each head As it bobbed up and down with the speed that we sped; Clapped my handsâlaughed and sangâany noise, bad or good, Till at length into Aix we rotated and stood. And all I remember is friends flocking round As I unsheathed my head from a hole in the ground; And no voice but was praising that hand-car divine, As I rubbed down its spokes with that lecture of mine, Which (the citizens voted by common consent) Was no more than its due. 'Twas the lecture they meant. THE RIPEST PEACH The ripest peach is highest on the treeâ And so her love, beyond the reach of me, Is dearest in my sight. Sweet breezes, bow Her heart down to me where I worship now! She looms aloft where every eye may see The ripest peach is highest on the tree. Such fruitage as her love I know, alas! I may not reach here from the orchard grass. I drink the sunshine showered past her lips As roses drain the dewdrop as it drips. The ripest peach is highest on the tree, And so mine eyes gaze upward eagerly. Whyâwhy do I not turn away in wrath And pluck some heart here hanging in my path?â Love's lower boughs bend with themâbut, ah me! The ripest peach is highest on the tree! BEDOUIN O love is like an untamed steed!â So hot of heart and wild of speed, And with fierce freedom so in love, The desert is not vast enough, With all its leagues of glimmering sands, To pasture it! Ah, that my hands Were more than human in their strength, That my deft lariat at length Might safely noose this splendid thing That so defies all conquering! Ho! but to see it whirl and reelâ The sands spurt forwardâand to feel The quivering tension of the thong That throned me high, with shriek and song! To grapple tufts of tossing maneâ To spurn it to its feet again, And then, sans saddle, rein or bit, To lash the mad life out of it! A DITTY OF NO TONEâ Piped to the Spirit of John Keats I Would that my lips might pour out in thy praise A fitting melodyâan air sublime,â A song sun-washed and draped in dreamy hazeâ The floss and velvet of luxurious rhyme: A lay wrought of warm languors, and o'er-brimmed With balminess, and fragrance of wild flowers Such as the droning bee ne'er wearies ofâ Such thoughts as might be hymned To thee from this midsummer land of ours Through shower and sunshine, blent for very love. II Deep silences in woody aisles wherethrough Cool paths go loitering, and where the trill Of best-remembered birds hath something new In cadence for the hearingâlingering still Through all the open day that lies beyond; Reaches of pasture-lands, vine-wreathen oaks, Majestic still in pathos of decay;â The roadâthe wayside pond Wherein the dragon-fly an instant soaks His filmy wing-tips ere he flits away. III And I would pluck from out the dank, rich mold, Thick-shaded from the sun of noon, the long Lithe stalks of barley, topped with ruddy gold, And braid them in the meshes of my song; And with them I would tangle wheat and rye, And wisps of greenest grass the katydid E'er crept beneath the blades of, sulkily, As harvest-hands went by; And weave of all, as wildest fancy bid, A crown of mingled song and bloom for thee. THE SPHINX I know all about the Sphinxâ I know even what she thinks, Staring with her stony eyes Up forever at the skies. For last night I dreamed that she Told me all the mysteryâ Why for Ã¦ons mute she sat:â She was just cut out for that! MOTHER GOOSE Dear Mother Goose! most motherly and dear Of all good mothers who have laps wherein We children nestle safest from all sin,â I cuddle to thy bosom, with no fear There to confess that though thy cap be queer, And thy curls gimlety, and thy cheeks thin, And though the winkered mole upon thy chin Tickles thy very nose-tip,âstill to hear The jolly jingles of mine infancy Crooned by thee, makes mine eager arms, as now, To twine about thy neck, full tenderly Drawing the dear old face down, that thy brow May dip into my purest kiss, and be Crowned ever with the baby-love of me. IN THE HEART OF JUNE In the heart of June, love, You and I together, On from dawn till noon, love, Laughing with the weather; Blending both our souls, love, In the selfsame tune, Drinking all life holds, love, In the heart of June. In the heart of June, love, With its golden weather, Underneath the moon, love, You and I together. Ah! how sweet to seem, love, Drugged and half aswoon With this luscious dream, love, In the heart of June. MY BOY You smile and you smoke your cigar, my boy; You walk with a languid swing; You tinkle and tune your guitar, my boy, And lift up your voice and sing; The midnight moon is a friend of yours, And a serenade your joyâ And it's only an age like mine that cures A trouble like yours, my boy! THE ASSASSIN Fling him amongst the cobbles of the street Midmost along a mob's most turbid tide; Stun him with tumult upon every sideâ Wrangling of hoarsened voices that repeat His awful guilt and howl for vengeance meet; Let white-faced women stare, all torrid-eyed, With hair blown forward, and with jaws dropped wide, And some face like his mother's glimmer sweet An instant in the hot core of his eyes. Then snatch him with claw hands, and thong his head That he may look no way but toward the skies That glower lividly and crackle red,â There let some knuckled fist of lightning riseâ Draw backward flickeringly and knock him dead. BECAUSE Why did we meet long years of yore? And why did we strike hands and say: âWe will be friends, and nothing moreâ; Why are we musing thus to-day? Because because was just because, And no one knew just why it was. Why did I say good-by to you? Why did I sail across the main? Why did I love not heaven's own blue Until I touched these shores again? Because because was just because, And you nor I knew why it was. Why are my arms about you now, And happy tears upon your cheek? And why my kisses on your brow? Look up in thankfulness and speak! Because because was just because, And only God knew why it was. PANSIES Pansies! Pansies! How I love you, pansies! Jaunty-faced, laughing-lipped and dewy-eyed with glee; Would my song but blossom out in little five-leaf stanzas As delicate in fancies As your beauty is to me! But my eyes shall smile on you, and my hands infold you, Pet, caress, and lift you to the lips that love you so, That, shut ever in the years that may mildew or mold you, My fancy shall behold you Fair as in the long ago. BABY'S DYING Baby's dying, Do not stirâ Let her spirit lightly float Through the sighing Lips of herâ Still the murmur in the throat; Let the moan of grief be curbedâ Baby must not be disturbed! Baby's dying, Do not stirâ Let her pure life lightly swim Through the sighing Lips of herâ Out from us and up to Himâ Let her leave us with that smileâ Kiss and miss her after while. AN EMPTY GLOVE I An empty gloveâlong withering in the grasp Of Time's cold palm. I lift it to my lips,â And lo, once more I thrill beneath its clasp, In fancy, as with odorous finger-tips It reaches from the years that used to be And proffers back love, life and all, to me. II Ah! beautiful she was beyond belief: Her face was fair and lustrous as the moon's; Her eyesâtoo large for small delight or grief,â The smiles of them were Laughter's afternoons; Their tears were April showers, and their loveâ All sweetest speech swoons ere it speaks thereof. III White-fruited cocoa shown against the shell Were not so white as was her brow below The cloven tresses of the hair that fell Across her neck and shoulders of nude snow; Her cheeksâchaste pallor, with a crimson stainâ Her mouth was like a red rose rinsed with rain. IV And this was she my fancy held as goodâ As fair and lovableâin every wise As peerless in pure worth of womanhood As was her wondrous beauty in men's eyes.â Yet, all alone, I kiss this empty gloveâ The poor husk of the hand I lovedâand love. TO THE CRICKET The chiming seas may clang; and Tubal Cain May clink his tinkling metals as he may; Or Pan may sit and pipe his breath away; Or Orpheus wake his most entrancing strain Till not a note of melody remain!â But thou, O cricket, with thy roundelay, Shalt laugh them all to scorn! So wilt thou, pray Trill me thy glad song o'er and o'er again: I shall not weary; there is purest worth In thy sweet prattle, since it sings the lone Heart home again. Thy warbling hath no dearth Of childish memoriesâno harsher tone Than we might listen to in gentlest mirth, Thou poor plebeian minstrel of the hearth. THE OLD-FASHIONED BIBLE How dear to my heart are the scenes of my childhood That now but in mem'ry I sadly review; The old meeting-house at the edge of the wildwood, The rail fence and horses all tethered thereto; The low, sloping roof, and the bell in the steeple, The doves that came fluttering out overhead As it solemnly gathered the God-fearing people To hear the old Bible my grandfather read. The old-fashioned Bibleâ The dust-covered Bibleâ The leathern-bound Bible my grandfather read. The blessed old volume! The face bent above itâ As now I recall itâis gravely severe, Though the reverent eye that droops downward to love it Makes grander the text through the lens of a tear, And, as down his features it trickles and glistens, The cough of the deacon is stilled, and his head Like a haloÃ©d patriarch's leans as he listens To hear the old Bible my grandfather read. The old-fashioned Bibleâ The dust-covered Bibleâ The leathern-bound Bible my grandfather read. Ah! who shall look backward with scorn and derision And scoff the old book though it uselessly lies In the dust of the past, while this newer revision Lisps on of a hope and a home in the skies? Shall the voice of the Master be stifled and riven? Shall we hear but a tithe of the words He has said, When so long He has, listening, leaned out of Heaven To hear the old Bible my grandfather read? The old-fashioned Bibleâ The dust-covered Bibleâ The leathern-bound Bible my grandfather read. THE LAND OF USED-TO-BE And where's the Land of Used-to-be, does little baby wonder? Oh, we will clap a magic saddle over âPoppie'sâ knee And ride away around the world, and in and out and under The whole of all the golden sunny Summer-time and see. Leisurely and lazy-like we'll jostle on our journey, And let the pony bathe his hooves and cool them in the dew, As he sidles down the shady way, and lags along the ferny And green, grassy edges of the lane we travel through. And then we'll canter on to catch the bauble of the thistle As it bumps among the butterflies and glimmers down the sun, To leave us laughing, all content to hear the robin whistle Or guess what Katydid is saying little Katy's done. And pausing here a minute, where we hear the squirrel chuckle As he darts from out the underbrush and scampers up the tree, We will gather buds and locust-blossoms, leaves and honeysuckle, To wreathe around our foreheads, riding into Used-to-be;â For here's the very rim of it that we go swinging overâ Don't you hear the Fairy bugles, and the tinkle of the bells, And see the baby-bumblebees that tumble in the clover And dangle from the tilted pinks and tipsy pimpernels? And don't you see the merry faces of the daffodillies, And the jolly Johnny-jump-ups, and the buttercups a-glee, And the low, lolling ripples ring around the waterlilies?â All greeting us with laughter, to the Land of Used-to-be! And here among the blossoms of the blooming vines and grasses, With a haze forever hanging in the sky forever blue, And with a breeze from over seas to kiss us as it passes, We will romp around forever as the airy Elfins do! For all the elves of earth and air are swarming here togetherâ The prankish Puck, King Oberon, and Queen Titania too; And dear old Mother Goose herself, as sunny as the weather, Comes dancing down the dewy walks to welcome me and you! JUST TO BE GOOD Just to be goodâ This is enoughâenough! O we who find sin's billows wild and rough, Do we not feel how more than any gold Would be the blameless life we led of old While yet our lips knew but a mother's kiss! Ah! though we miss All else but this, To be good is enough! It is enoughâ Enoughâjust to be good! To lift our hearts where they are understood, To let the thirst for worldly power and place Go unappeased; to smile back in God's face With the glad lips our mothers used to kiss. Ah! though we miss All else but this, To be good is enough! A LOUNGER He leaned against a lamp-post, lost In some mysterious reverie: His head was bowed; his arms were crossed; He yawned, and glanced evasively: Uncrossed his arms, and slowly put Them back again, and scratched his sideâ Shifted his weight from foot to foot, And gazed out no-ward, idle-eyed. Grotesque of form and face and dress, And picturesque in every wayâ A figure that from day to day Drooped with a limper laziness; A figure such as artists lean, In pictures where distress is seen, Against low hovels where we guess No happiness has ever been. MR. WHAT'S-HIS-NAME They called him Mr. What's-his-name: From where he was, or why he came, Or when, or what he found to do, Nobody in the city knew. He lived, it seemed, shut up alone In a low hovel of his own; There cooked his meals and made his bed, Careless of all his neighbors said. His neighbors, too, said many things Expressive of grave wonderings, Since none of them had ever been Within his doors, or peered therein. In fact, grown watchful, they became Assured that Mr. What's-his-name Was up to something wrongâindeed, Small doubt of it, we all agreed. At night were heard strange noises there, When honest people everywhere Had long retired; and his light Was often seen to burn all night. He left his house but seldomâthen Would always hurry back again, As though he feared some stranger's knock, Finding him gone, might burst the lock. Besides, he carried, every day, At the one hour he went away, A basket, with the contents hid Beneath its woven willow lid. And so we grew to greatly blame This wary Mr. What's-his-name, And look on him with such distrust His actions seemed to sanction just. But when he diedâhe died one dayâ Dropped in the street while on his way To that old wretched hut of hisâ You'll think it strangeâperhaps it isâ But when we lifted him, and past The threshold of his home at last, No man of all the crowd but stepped With reverence,âay, quailed and wept! What was it? Just a shriek of pain I pray to never hear againâ A withered woman, old and bowed, That fell and crawled and cried aloudâ And kissed the dead man's matted hairâ Lifted his face and kissed him thereâ Called to him, as she clutched his hand, In words no one could understand. Insane? Yes.âWell, we, searching, found An unsigned letter, in a round Free hand, within the dead man's breast: âLook to my motherâI'm at rest. âYou'll find my money safely hid Under the lining of the lid Of my work-basket. It is hers, And God will bless her ministers!â And some dayâthough he died unknownâ If through the City by the Throne I walk, all cleansed of earthly shame, I'll ask for Mr. What's-his-name. UNCOMFORTED Lelloine! Lelloine! Don't you hear me calling? Calling through the night for you, and calling through the day; Calling when the dawn is here, and when the dusk is fallingâ Calling for my Lelloine the angels lured away! Lelloine! I call and listen, starting from my pillowâ In the hush of midnight, Lelloine! I cry, And o'er the rainy window-pane I hear the weeping willow Trail its dripping leaves like baby-fingers in reply. Lelloine, I miss the glimmer of your glossy tresses, I miss the dainty velvet palms that nestled in my own; And all my mother-soul went out in answerless caresses, And a storm of tears and kisses when you left me here alone. I have prayed, O Lelloine, but Heaven will not hear me, I can not gain one sign from Him who leads you by the hand; And O it seems that ne'er again His mercy will come near meâ That He will never see my need, nor ever understand. Won't you listen, Lelloine?âjust a little leaning O'er the walls of Paradiseâlean and hear my prayer, And interpret death to Him in all its awful meaning, And tell Him you are lonely without your mother there. MY WHITE BREAD Dem good old days done past and gone In old Ca'line wha I wuz bo'n W'en my old Misst'ess she fust sayd, âYo's a-eatin' yo' white braid!â Oh, dem's de times uts done gone by W'en de nights shine cla, an' de coon clim' high, An' I sop my soul in 'possum-pie, Das a-eatin' my white braid! It's dem's de nights ut I cross my legs An' pat de flo' ez I twis' de pegs O' de banjo up twil de gals all sayd, âYo's a-eatin' yo' white braid!â Oh, dem's de times ut I usen fo' to blow On de long reeds cut in de old by-o, An' de frogs jine in like dey glad fo' to know I's a-eatin' my white braid. An' I shet my eyes fo' to conjuh up Dem good ole days ut fills my cup Wid de times ut fust ole Misst'ess sayd, âYo's a-eatin' yo' white braid!â Oh, dem's de dreams ut I fines de best; An' bald an' gray ez a hornet's nest, I drap my head on de good Lord's breast, Says a-eatin' my white braid! HE AND I Just drifting on togetherâ He and Iâ As through the balmy weather Of July Drift two thistle-tufts embedded Each in eachâby zephyrs weddedâ Touring upward, giddy-headed, For the sky. And, veering up and onward, Do we seem Forever drifting dawnward In a dream, Where we meet song-birds that know us, And the winds their kisses blow us, While the years flow far below us Like a stream. And we are happyâveryâ He and Iâ Aye, even glad and merry Though on high The heavens are sometimes shrouded By the midnight storm, and clouded Till the pallid moon is crowded From the sky. My spirit ne'er expresses Any choice But to clothe him with caresses And rejoice; And as he laughs, it is in Such a tone the moonbeams glisten And the stars come out to listen To his voice. And so, whate'er the weather, He and I,â With our lives linked thus together, Float and fly As two thistle-tufts embedded Each in eachâby zephyrs weddedâ Touring upward, giddy-headed, For the sky. FROM A BALLOON Ho! we are loose. Hear how they shout, And how their clamor dwindles out Beneath us to the merest hum Of earthly acclamation. Come, Lean with me here and look belowâ Why, bless you, man! don't tremble so! There is no need of fear, up hereâ Not higher than the buzzard swings About upon the atmosphere, With drowsy eyes and open wings! There, steady, now, and feast your eyes;â See, we are trancedâwe do not rise; It is the earth that sinks from us: But when I first beheld it thus, And felt the breezes downward flow, And heard all noises fail and die, Until but silence and the sky Above, around me, and below,â Why, like you now, I swooned almost, With mingled awe and fear and gleeâ As giddy as an hour-old ghost That stares into eternity. A TWINTORETTE Ho! my little maiden With the glossy tresses, Come thou and dance with me A measure all divine; Let my breast be laden With but thy caressesâ Come thou and glancingly Mate thy face with mine. Thou shalt trill a rondel, While my lips are purling Some dainty twitterings Sweeter than the birds'; And, with arms that fondle Each as we go twirling, We will kiss, with twitterings, Lisps and loving words. WHAT THEY SAID Whispering to themselves apart, They who knew her said of her, âDying of a broken heartâ Death her only comforterâ For the man she loved is deadâ She will follow soon!â they said. Beautiful? Ah! brush the dust From Raphael's fairest face, And restore it, as it must First have smiled back from its place On his easel as he leant Wrapt in awe and wonderment! Why, to kiss the very hem Of the mourning-weeds she wore, Like the winds that rustled them, I had gone the round world o'er; And to touch her hand I swear All things dareless I would dare! But unto themselves apart, Whispering, they said of her, âDying of a broken heartâ Death her only comforterâ For the man she loved is deadâ She will follow soon!â they said. So I mutely turned away, Turned with sorrow and despair, Yearning still from day to day For that woman dying there, Till at last, by longing led, I returned to find herâdead? âDead?ââI know that word would tell Rhyming thereâbut in this case âWedâ rhymes equally as well In the very selfsame placeâ And, in fact, the latter word Is the one she had preferred. Yet unto themselves apart, Whisp'ring they had said of herâ âDying of a broken heartâ Death her only comforterâ For the man she loved is deadâ She will follow soon!â they said. AFTER THE FROST After the frost! O the rose is dead, And the weeds lie pied in the garden-bed, And the peach tree's shade in the wan sunshine, Faint as the veins in these hands of mine, Streaks the gray of the orchard wall Where the vine rasps loose, and the last leaves fall, And the bare boughs writhe, and the winds are lostâ After the frostâthe frost! After the frost! O the weary head And the hands and the heart are quietÃ©d; And the lips we loved are locked at last, And kiss not back, though the rain falls fast And the lashes drip, and the soul makes moan, And on through the dead leaves walks alone Where the bare boughs writhe and the winds are lostâ After the frostâthe frost! CHARLES H. PHILIPS Obit November 5th, 1881 O friend! There is no way To bid farewell to thee! The words that we would say Above thy grave to-day Still falter and delay And fail us utterly. When walking with us here, The hand we loved to press Was gentle, and sincere As thy frank eyes were clear Through every smile and tear Of pleasure and distress. In years, young; yet in thought Mature; thy spirit, free, And fired with fervor caught Of thy proud sire, who fought His way to fame, and taught Its toilsome way to thee. So even thou hast gained The victory God-givenâ Yea, as our cheeks are stained With tears, and our souls pained And mute, thou hast attained Thy high reward in Heaven! WHEN IT RAINS When it rains, and with the rain Never bird has heart to sing, And across the window-pane Is no sunlight glimmering; When the pitiless refrain Brings a tremor to the lips, Our tears are like the rain As it drips, drips, dripsâ Like the sad, unceasing rain as it drips. When the light of heaven's blue Is blurred and blotted quite, And the dreary day to you Is but a long twilight; When it seems that ne'er again Shall the sun break its eclipse, Our tears are like the rain As it drips, drips, dripsâ Like the endless, friendless rain as it drips. When it rains! weary heart, O be of better cheer! The leaden clouds will part, And the morrow will be clear; Take up your load again, With a prayer upon your lips, Thanking Heaven for the rain As it drips, drips, dripsâ With the golden bow of promise as it drips. AN ASSASSIN Cat like he creeps along where ways are dim, From covert unto covert's secrecy; His shadow in the moonlight shrinks from him And crouches warily. He hugs strange envies to his breast, and nurses Wild hatreds, till the murderous hand he grips Falls, quivering with the tension of the curses He launches from his lips. Drenched in his victim's blood he holds high revel; He mocks at justice, and in all men's eyes Insults his Godâand no one but the devil Is sorry when he dies. BEST OF ALL Of all good gifts that the Lord lets fall, Is not silence the best of all? The deep, sweet hush when the song is closed, And every sound but a voiceless ghost; And every sigh, as we listening leant, A breathless quiet of vast content? The laughs we laughed have a purer ring With but their memory echoing; And the joys we voiced, and the words we said, Seem so dearer for being dead. So of all good gifts that the Lord lets fall, Is not silence the best of all? MR. SILBERBERG AND LITTLE JULIUS I like me yet dot leedle chile Vich climb my lap up in to-day, Unt took my cheap cigair avay, Unt laugh unt kiss me, purty-whvile,â Possescially I like dose mout' Vich taste his moder's likeâunt so, Eef my cigair it gone glean out âYust let it go!

THE HEREAFTER Hereafter! O we need not waste Our smiles or tears, whate'er befall: No happiness but holds a taste Of something sweeter, after all;â No depth of agony but feels Some fragment of abiding trust,â Whatever Death unlocks or seals, The mute beyond is just. THE LOVING CUP Tranced in the glamour of a dream Where banquet-lights and fancies gleam, And ripest wit and wine abound, And pledges hale go round and round,â Lo, dazzled with enchanted raysâ As in the golden olden days Sir Galahadâmy eyes swim up To greet your splendor, Loving Cup! What is the secret of your art, Linking together hand and heart Your myriad votaries who do Themselves most honor honoring you? What gracious service have you done To win the name that you have won?â Kissing it back from tuneful lips That sing your praise between the sips! Your spicy breath, O Loving Cup, That, like an incense steaming up, Full-freighted with a fragrance fine As ever swooned on sense of mine, Is rare enough.âBut then, ah me! How rarer every memory That, rising with it, wreathes and blends In forms and faces of my friends! O Loving Cup! in fancy still, I clasp their hands, and feel the thrill Of fellowship that still endures While lips are theirs and wine is yours! And while my memory journeys down The years that lead to Boston Town, Abide where first were rendered up Our mutual loves, O Loving Cup! EROS The storm of love has burst at last Full on me: All the world, before, Was like an alien, unknown shore Along whose verge I laughing passed.â But nowâI laugh not any more,â Bowed with a silence vast in weight As that which falls on one who stands For the first time on ocean sands, Seeing and feeling all the great Awe of the waves as they wash the lands And billow and wallow and undulate. THE QUIET LODGER The man that rooms next door to me: Two weeks ago, this very night, He took possession quietly, As any other lodger mightâ But why the room next mine should so Attract him I was vexed to know,â Because his quietude, in fine, Was far superior to mine. âNow, I like quiet, truth to tell, A tranquil life is sweet to meâ But this,â I sneered, âsuits me too well.â He shuts his door so noiselessly, And glides about so very mute, In each mysterious pursuit, His silence is oppressive, and Too deep for me to understand.â Sometimes, forgetting book or pen, I've found my head in breathless poise Lifted, and dropped in shame again, Hearing some alien ghost of noiseâ Some smothered sound that seemed to be A trunk-lid dropped unguardedly, Or the crisp writhings of some quire Of manuscript thrust in the fire. Then I have climbed, and closed in vain My transom, opening in the hall; Or close against the window-pane Have pressed my fevered face,âbut all The day or night without held not A sight or sound or counter-thought To set my mind one instant free Of this man's silent mastery. And often I have paced the floor With muttering anger, far at night, Hearing, and cursing, o'er and o'er, The muffled noises, and the light And tireless movements of this guest Whose silence raged above my rest Hoarser than howling storms at seaâ The man that rooms next door to me. But twice or thrice, upon the stair, I've seen his faceâmost strangely wan,â Each time upon me unaware He cameâsmooth'd past me, and was gone.â So like a whisper he went by, I listened after, ear and eye, Nor could my chafing fancy tell The meaning of one syllable. Last night I caught him, face to face,â He entering his room, and I Glaring from mine: He paused a space And met my scowl all shrinkingly, But with full gentleness: The key Turned in his doorâand I could see It tremblingly withdrawn and put Inside, and thenâthe door was shut. Then silence. Silence!âwhy, last night The silence was tumultuous, And thundered on till broad daylight;â O never has it stunned me thus!â It rolls, and moans, and mumbles yet.â Ah, God! how loud may silence get When man mocks at a brother man Who answers but as silence can! The silence grew, and grew, and grew, Till at high noon to-day 'twas heard Throughout the house; and men flocked through The echoing halls, with faces blurred With pallor, gloom, and fear, and awe, And shuddering at what they saw,â The quiet lodger, as he lay Stark of the life he cast away. So strange to-nightâthose voices there, Where all so quiet was before: They say the face has not a care Nor sorrow in it any more. ... His latest scrawl:ââForgive meâYou Who prayed, âThey know not what they do!ââ My tears will never let me see This man that rooms next door to me! THE BROOK-SONG Little brook! Little brook! You have such a happy lookâ Such a very merry manner, as you swerve and curve and crookâ And your ripples, one and one, Reach each other's hands and run Like laughing little children in the sun! Little brook, sing to me: Sing about a bumblebee That tumbled from a lily-bell and grumbled mumblingly, Because he wet the film Of his wings, and had to swim, While the water-bugs raced round and laughed at him! Little brookâsing a song Of a leaf that sailed along Down the golden-braided center of your current swift and strong, And a dragon-fly that lit On the tilting rim of it, And rode away and wasn't scared a bit. And singâhow oft in glee Came a truant boy like me, Who loved to lean and listen to your lilting melody, Till the gurgle and refrain Of your music in his brain Wrought a happiness as keen to him as pain. Little brookâlaugh and leap! Do not let the dreamer weep: Sing him all the songs of summer till he sink in softest sleep; And then sing soft and low Through his dreams of long agoâ Sing back to him the rest he used to know! BIN A-FISHIN' W'en de sun's gone down, an' de moon is riz, Bin a-fishin'! Bin a-fishin'! It's I's aguine down wha' the by-o is! Bin a-fishin' all night long! Chorus Bin a-fishin'! Bin a-fishin'!

Chorus UNCLE DAN'L IN TOWN OVER SUNDAY I cain't git used to city waysâ Ner never could, I' bet my hat! Jevver know jes' whur I was raised?â Raised on a farm! D' ever tell you that? Was undoubtatly, I declare! And now, on Sundayâfun to spare Around a farm! Why jes' to set Up on the top three-cornered rail Of Pap's old place, nigh La Fayette, I'd swap my soul off, hide and tail! You fellers in the city here, You don't know nothin'!âS'pose to-day, This clatterin' Sunday, you waked up Without no jinglin'-janglin' bells, Ner rattlin' of the milkman's cup, Ner any swarm of screechin' birds Like these here English swallersâS'pose Ut you could miss all noise like those, And git shet o' thinkin' of 'em afterwerds, And then, in the country, wake and hear Nothin' but silenceâwake and see Nothin' but green woods fur and near?â What sort o' Sunday would that be? ...

To laze around the barn and poke Fer hens' nestsâer git up a match Betwixt the boys, and watch 'em scratch And rassle round, and sweat and swear And quarrel to their hearts' content; And me a-jes' a-settin' there A-hatchin' out more devilment! What sort o' Sunday would that be? ... Wisht I hed you home with me! EMERSON CONCORD, APRIL 27, 1882 What shall we say? In quietude, Within his home, in dreams unguessed, He lies; the grief a nation would Evince must be repressed. Nor meet is it the loud acclaim His countrymen would raiseâthat he Has left the riches of his fame The whole world's legacy. Then, prayerful, let us pause until We find, as grateful spirits can, The way most worthy to fulfil The tribute due the man. Think what were best in his regard Who voyaged life in such a cause: Our simplest faith were best rewardâ Our silence, best applause. YOUR VIOLIN Your violin! Ah me! 'Twas fashioned o'er the sea, In storied Italyâ What matter where? It is its voice that sways And thrills me as it plays The airs of other daysâ The days that were! Then let your magic bow Glide lightly to and fro.â I close my eyes, and so, In vast content, I kiss my hand to you, And to the tunes we knew Of old, as well as to Your instrument! Poured out of some dim dream Of lulling sounds that seem Like ripples of a stream Twanged lightly by The slender, tender hands Of weeping-willow wands That droop where gleaming sands And pebbles lie. A melody that swoons In all the truant tunes Long listless afternoons Lure from the breeze, When woodland boughs are stirred, And moaning doves are heard, And laughter afterward Beneath the trees. Through all the chorusing, I hear on leaves of spring The drip and pattering Of April skies, With echoes faint and sweet As baby-angel feet Might wake along a street Of Paradise. SOLDIERS HERE TO-DAY I Soldiers and saviors of the homes we love; Heroes and patriots who marched away, And who marched back, and who marched on aboveâ Allâall are here to-day! By the dear cause you fought forâyou are here; At summons of bugle, and the drum Whose palpitating syllables were ne'er More musical, you come! Hereâby the stars that bloom in fields of blue, And by the bird above with shielding wings; And by the flag that floats out over you, With silken beckoningsâ Ay, here beneath its folds are gathered all Who warred unscathed for blessings that it gaveâ Still blessed its champion, though it but fall A shadow on his grave! II We greet you, Victors, as in vast array You gather from the scenes of strife and deathâ From spectral fortress-walls where curls away The cannon's latest breath. We greet youâfrom the crumbling battlements Where once again the old flag feels the breeze Stroke out its tattered stripes and smooth its rents With rippling ecstasies. From living tombs where every hope seemed lostâ With famine quarantined by bristling gunsâ The prison-pensâthe guardsâthe âdead-lineâ crossed Byâriddled skeletons! From furrowed plains, sown thick with bursting shellsâ From mountain gorge, and toppling crags o'erheadâ From wards of pestilential hospitals, And trenches of the dead. III In fancy all are here. The night is o'er, And through dissolving mists the morning gleams; And clustered round their hearths we see once more The heroes of our dreams. Strong, tawny faces, some, and some are fair, And some are marked with age's latest prime, And, seer-like, browed and aureoled with hair As hoar as winter-time. The faces of fond lovers, glorifiedâ The faces of the husband and the wifeâ The babe's face nestled at the mother's side, And smiling back at life; A bloom of happiness in every cheekâ A thrill of tingling joy in every veinâ In every soul a rapture they will seek In Heaven, and find again! IV 'Tis not a vision onlyâwe who pay But the poor tribute of our praises here Are equal sharers in the guerdon they Purchased at price so dear. The angel, Peace, o'er all uplifts her hand, Waving the olive, and with heavenly eyes Shedding a light of love o'er sea and land As sunshine from the skiesâ Her figure pedestaled on Freedom's soilâ Her sandals kissed with seas of golden grainâ Queen of a realm of joy-requited toil That glories in her reign. O blessed land of labor and reward! O gracious Ruler, let Thy reign endure; In pruning-hook and plough-share beat the sword, And reap the harvest sure! A WINDY DAY The dawn was a dawn of splendor, And the blue of the morning skies Was as placid and deep and tender As the blue of a baby's eyes; The sunshine flooded the mountain, And flashed over land and sea Like the spray of a glittering fountain.â But the windâthe windâAh me! Like a weird invisible spirit, It swooped in its airy flight; And the earth, as the stress drew near it, Quailed as in mute affright; The grass in the green fields quiveredâ The waves of the smitten brook Chillily shuddered and shivered, And the reeds bowed down and shook. Like a sorrowful miserere It sobbed, and it blew and blew, Till the leaves on the trees looked weary, And my prayers were weary, too; And then, like the sunshine's glimmer That failed in the awful strain, All the hope of my eyes grew dimmer In a spatter of spiteful rain. SHADOW AND SHINE Storms of the winter, and deepening snows, When will you end? I said, For the soul within me was numb with woes, And my heart uncomforted. When will you cease, O dismal days? When will you set me free? For the frozen world and its desolate ways Are all unloved of me! I waited long, but the answer cameâ The kiss of the sunshine lay Warm as a flame on the lips that frame The song in my heart to-day. Blossoms of summer-time waved in the air, Glimmers of sun in the sea; Fair thoughts followed me everywhere, And the world was dear to me. THE OLD SWIMMIN'-HOLE Oh! the old swimmin'-hole! whare the crick so still and deep Looked like a baby-river that was laying half asleep, And the gurgle of the worter round the drift jest below Sounded like the laugh of something we onc't ust to know Before we could remember anything but the eyes Of the angels lookin' out as we left Paradise; But the merry days of youth is beyond our controle, And it's hard to part ferever with the old swimmin'-hole. Oh! the old swimmin'-hole! In the happy days of yore, When I ust to lean above it on the old sickamore, Oh! it showed me a face in its warm sunny tide That gazed back at me so gay and glorified, It made me love myself, as I leaped to caress My shadder smilin' up at me with sich tenderness. But them days is past and gone, and old Time's tuck his toll From the old man come back to the old swimmin'-hole. Oh! the old swimmin'-hole! In the long, lazy days When the humdrum of school made so many run-a-ways, How plesant was the jurney down the old dusty lane, Whare the tracks of our bare feet was all printed so plane You could tell by the dent of the heel and the sole They was lots o' fun on hands at the old swimmin'-hole. But the lost joys is past! Let your tears in sorrow roll Like the rain that ust to dapple up the old swimmin'-hole. Thare the bullrushes growed, and the cattails so tall, And the sunshine and shadder fell over it all; And it mottled the worter with amber and gold Tel the glad lilies rocked in the ripples that rolled; And the snake-feeder's four gauzy wings fluttered by Like the ghost of a daisy dropped out of the sky, Or a wownded apple-blossom in the breeze's controle As it cut acrost some orchurd to'rds the old swimmin'-hole. Oh! the old swimmin'-hole! When I last saw the place, The scenes was all changed, like the change in my face; The bridge of the railroad now crosses the spot Whare the old divin'-log lays sunk and fergot. And I stray down the banks whare the trees ust to beâ But never again will theyr shade shelter me! And I wish in my sorrow I could strip to the soul, And dive off in my grave like the old swimmin'-hole. THOUGHTS FER THE DISCURAGED FARMER The summer winds is sniffin' round the bloomin' locus' trees; And the clover in the pastur is a big day fer the bees, And they been a-swiggin' honey, above board and on the sly, Tel they stutter in theyr buzzin' and stagger as they fly. The flicker on the fence-rail 'pears to jest spit on his wings And roll up his feathers, by the sassy way he sings; And the hoss-fly is a-whettin'-up his forelegs fer biz, And the off-mare is a-switchin' all of her tale they is. You can hear the blackbirds jawin' as they foller up the plowâ Oh, theyr bound to git theyr brekfast, and theyr not a-carin' how; So they quarrel in the furries, and they quarrel on the wingâ But theyr peaceabler in pot-pies than any other thing: And it's when I git my shotgun drawed up in stiddy rest, She's as full of tribbelation as a yeller-jacket's nest; And a few shots before dinner, when the sun's a-shinin' right, Seems to kindo'-sorto' sharpen up a feller's appetite! They's been a heap o' rain, but the sun's out to-day, And the clouds of the wet spell is all cleared away, And the woods is all the greener, and the grass is greener still; It may rain again to-morry, but I don't think it will. Some says the crops is ruined, and the corn's drownded out, And propha-sy the wheat will be a failure, without doubt; But the kind Providence that has never failed us yet, Will be on hands onc't more at the 'leventh hour, I bet! Does the medder-lark complane, as he swims high and dry Through the waves of the wind and the blue of the sky? Does the quail set up and whissel in a disappinted way, Er hang his head in silunce, and sorrow all the day? Is the chipmuck's health a-failin'?âDoes he walk, er does he run? Don't the buzzards ooze around up thare jest like they've allus done? Is they anything the matter with the rooster's lungs er voice? Ort a mortul be complanin' when dumb animals rejoice? Then let us, one and all, be contentud with our lot; The June is here this morning, and the sun is shining hot. Oh! let us fill our harts up with the glory of the day, And banish ev'ry doubt and care and sorrow fur away! Whatever be our station, with Providence fer guide, Sich fine circumstances ort to make us satisfied; Fer the world is full of roses, and the roses full of dew, And the dew is full of heavenly love that drips fer me and you. A GOOD-BY âGood-by, my friend!â He takes her handâ The pressures blend: They understand But vaguely why, with drooping eye, Each moansââGood-by!âGood-by!â âDear friend, good-by!â O she could smile If she might cry A little while!â She says, âI ought to smileâbut Iâ Forgive meâThere!âGood-by!â ââGood-by?â Ah, no: I hate,â says he, âThese âgood-bysâ so!â âAnd I,â says she, âDetest them soâwhy, I should die Were this a real âgood-byâ!â A SUMMER'S DAY The Summer's put the idy in My head that I'm a boy ag'in; And all around's so bright and gay I want to put my team away, And jest git out whare I can lay And soak my hide full of the day! But work is work, and must be doneâ Yit, as I work, I have my fun, Jest fancyin' these furries here Is childhood's paths onc't more so dear:â And so I walk through medder-lands, And country lanes, and swampy trails Whare long bullrushes bresh my hands; And, tilted on the ridered rails Of deadnin' fences, âOld Bob Whiteâ Whissels his name in high delight, And whirs away. I wunder still, Whichever way a boy's feet willâ Whare trees has fell, with tangled tops Whare dead leaves shakes, I stop fer breth, Heerin' the acorn as it dropsâ H'istin' my chin up still as deth, And watchin' clos't, with upturned eyes, The tree whare Mr. Squirrel tries To hide hisse'f above the limb, But lets his own tale tell on him. I wunder on in deeper gloomsâ Git hungry, hearin' female cries From old farmhouses, whare perfumes Of harvest dinners seems to rise And ta'nt a feller, hart and brane, With memories he can't explane. I wunder through the underbresh, Whare pig-tracks, pintin' to'rds the crick, Is picked and printed in the fresh Black bottom-lands, like wimmern pick Theyr pie-crusts with a fork, some way, When bakin' fer camp-meetin' day. I wunder on and on and on, Tel my gray hair and beard is gone, And ev'ry wrinkle on my brow Is rubbed clean out and shaddered now With curls as brown and fare and fine As tenderls of the wild grape-vine That ust to climb the highest tree To keep the ripest ones fer me. I wunder still, and here I am Wadin' the ford below the damâ The worter chucklin' round my knee At hornet-welt and bramble-scratch, And me a-slippin' 'crost to see Ef Tyner's plums is ripe, and size The old man's wortermelon-patch, With juicy mouth and drouthy eyes. Then, after sich a day of mirth And happiness as worlds is wurthâ So tired that Heaven seems nigh about,â The sweetest tiredness on earth Is to git home and flatten outâ So tired you can't lay flat enugh, And sorto' wish that you could spred Out like molasses on the bed, And jest drip off the aidges in The dreams that never comes ag'in. A HYMB OF FAITH O, thou that doth all things devise And fashon fer the best, He'p us who sees with mortul eyes To overlook the rest. They's times, of course, we grope in doubt, And in afflictions sore; So knock the louder, Lord, without, And we'll unlock the door. Make us to feel, when times looks bad And tears in pitty melts, Thou wast the only he'p we had When they was nothin' else. Death comes alike to ev'ry man That ever was borned on earth; Then let us do the best we can To live fer all life's wurth. Ef storms and tempusts dred to see Makes black the heavens ore, They done the same in Galilee Two thousand years before, But after all, the golden sun Poured out its floods on them That watched and waited fer the One Then borned in Bethlyham. Also, the star of holy writ Made noonday of the night, Whilse other stars that looked at it Was envious with delight. The sages then in wurship bowed, From ev'ry clime so fare; O, sinner, think of that glad crowd That congergated thare! They was content to fall in ranks With One that knowed the way From good old Jurden's stormy banks Clean up to Jedgmunt Day. No matter, then, how all is mixed In our near-sighted eyes, All things is fer the best, and fixed Out straight in Paradise. Then take things as God sends 'em here, And, ef we live er die, Be more and more contenteder, Without a-astin' why. O, Thou that doth all things devise And fashon fer the best, He'p us who sees with mortul eyes To overlook the rest. AT BROAD RIPPLE Ah, luxury! Beyond the heat And dust of town, with dangling feet, Astride the rock below the dam, In the cool shadows where the calm Rests on the stream again, and all Is silent save the waterfall,â I bait my hook and cast my line, And feel the best of life is mine. No high ambition may I claimâ I angle not for lordly game Of trout, or bass, or wary breamâ A black perch reaches the extreme Of my desires; and âgoggle-eyesâ Are not a thing that I despise; A sunfish, or a âchub,â or âcatââ A âsilver-sideââyea, even that! In eloquent tranquillity The waters lisp and talk to me. Sometimes, far out, the surface breaks, As some proud bass an instant shakes His glittering armor in the sun, And romping ripples, one by one, Come dallying across the space Where undulates my smiling face. The river's story flowing by, Forever sweet to ear and eye, Forever tenderly begunâ Forever new and never done. Thus lulled and sheltered in a shade Where never feverish cares invade, I bait my hook and cast my line, And feel the best of life is mine. THE COUNTRY EDITOR A thoughtful brow and faceâof sallow hue, But warm with welcome, as we find him there, Throned in his old misnomered âeasy chair,â Scrawling a âleader,â or a book-review; Or staring through the roof for something new With which to lift a wretched rival's hair, Or blow some petty clique in empty air And snap the party-ligaments in two. A man he is deserving well of thee,â So be compassionateâyea, pay thy dues, Nor pamper him with thy spring-poetry, But haul him wood, or something he can use; And promptly act, nor tarry long when he Gnaweth his pen and glareth rabidly. WORTERMELON TIME Old wortermelon time is a-comin' round ag'in, And they ain't no man a-livin' any tickleder'n me, Fer the way I hanker after wortermelons is a sinâ Which is the why and wharefore, as you can plainly see. Oh! it's in the sandy soil wortermelons does the best, And it's thare they'll lay and waller in the sunshine and the dew Tel they wear all the green streaks clean off of theyr breast; And you bet I ain't a-findin' any fault with them; air you? They ain't no better thing in the vegetable line; And they don't need much 'tendin', as ev'ry farmer knows; And when theyr ripe and ready fer to pluck from the vine, I want to say to you theyr the best fruit that grows. It's some likes the yeller-core, and some likes the red, And it's some says âThe Little Californyâ is the best; But the sweetest slice of all I ever wedged in my head, Is the old âEdingburg Mounting-sprout,â of the West. You don't want no punkins nigh your wortermelon vinesâ 'Cause, some-way-another, they'll spile your melons, shore;â I've seed 'em taste like punkins, from the core to the rines, Which may be a fact you have heerd of before. But your melons that's raised right and 'tended to with care, You can walk around amongst 'em with a parent's pride and joy, And thump 'em on the heads with as fatherly a air As ef each one of them was your little girl er boy. I joy in my hart jest to hear that rippin' sound When you split one down the back and jolt the halves in two, And the friends you love the best is gethered all aroundâ And you says unto your sweethart, âOh, here's the core fer you!â And I like to slice 'em up in big pieces fer 'em all, Espeshally the childern, and watch theyr high delight As one by one the rines with theyr pink notches falls, And they holler fer some more, with unquenched appetite. Boys takes to it natchurl, and I like to see 'em eatâ A slice of wortermelon's like a frenchharp in theyr hands, And when they âsawâ it through theyr mouth sich music can't be beatâ 'Cause it's music both the sperit and the stummick understands. Oh, they's more in wortermelons than the purty-colored meat, And the overflowin' sweetness of the worter squshed betwixt The up'ard and the down'ard motions of a feller's teeth, And it's the taste of ripe old age and juicy childhood mixed. Fer I never taste a melon but my thoughts flies away To the summer-time of youth; and again I see the dawn, And the fadin' afternoon of the long summer day, And the dusk and dew a-fallin', and the night a-comin' on. And thare's the corn around us, and the lispin' leaves and trees, And the stars a-peekin' down on us as still as silver mice, And us boys in the wortermelons on our hands and knees, And the new-moon hangin' ore us like a yeller-cored slice. Oh! it's wortermelon time is a-comin' round ag'in, And they ain't no man a-livin' any tickelder'n me, Fer the way I hanker after wortermelons is a sinâ Which is the why and wharefore, as you can plainly see. A SONG OF THE CRUISE O the sun and the rain, and the rain and the sun! There'll be sunshine again when the tempest is done; And the storm will beat back when the shining is past; But in some happy haven we'll anchor at last. Then murmur no more, In lull or in roar, But smile and be brave till the voyage is o'er. O the rain and the sun, and the sun and the rain! When the tempest is done, then the sunshine again; And in rapture we'll ride through the stormiest gales, For God's hand's on the helm and His breath in the sails. Then murmur no more, In lull or in roar, But smile and be brave till the voyage is o'er. MY PHILOSOFY I ain't, ner don't p'tend to be, Much posted on philosofy; But thare is times, when all alone, I work out idees of my own. And of these same thare is a few I'd like to jest refer to youâ Pervidin' that you don't object To listen clos't and rickollect. I allus argy that a man Who does about the best he can Is plenty good enugh to suit This lower mundane instituteâ No matter ef his daily walk Is subject fer his neghbor's talk, And critic-minds of ev'ry whim Jest all git up and go fer him! I knowed a feller onc't that had The yeller-janders mighty bad,â And each and ev'ry friend he'd meet Would stop and give him some receet Fer cuorin' of 'em. But he'd say He kindo' thought they'd go away Without no medicin', and boast That he'd git well without one doste. He kep' a-yellerin' onâand they Perdictin' that he'd die some day Before he knowed it! Tuck his bed, The feller did, and lost his head, And wundered in his mind a spellâ Then rallied, and, at last, got well; But ev'ry friend that said he'd die Went back on him eternally! It's natchurl enugh, I guess, When some gits more and some gits less, Fer them-uns on the slimmest side To claim it ain't a fare divide; And I've knowed some to lay and wait, And git up soon, and set up late, To ketch some feller they could hate Fer goin' at a faster gait. The signs is bad when folks commence A-findin' fault with Providence, And balkin' 'cause the earth don't shake At ev'ry prancin' step they take. No man is grate tel he can see How less than little he would be Ef stripped to self, and stark and bare He hung his sign out anywhare. My doctern is to lay aside Contensions, and be satisfied: Jest do your best, and praise er blame That follers followers that, counts jest the same. I've allus noticed grate success Is mixed with troubles, more er less, And it's the man who does the best That gits more kicks than all the rest. WHEN AGE COMES ON When Age comes on!â The deepening dusk is where the dawn Once glittered splendid, and the dew, In honey-drips from red rose-lips, Was kissed away by me and you.â And now across the frosty lawn Black footprints trail, and Age comes onâ And Age comes on! And biting wild-winds whistle through Our tattered hopesâand Age comes on! When Age comes on!â O tide of raptures, long withdrawn, Flow back in summer floods, and fling Here at our feet our childhood sweet, And all the songs we used to sing! ... Old loves, old friendsâall dead and goneâ Our old faith lostâand Age comes onâ And Age comes on! Poor hearts! have we not anything But longings left when Age comes on? THE CIRCUS-DAY PARADE Oh! the Circus-Day Parade! How the bugles played and played! And how the glossy horses tossed their flossy manes and neighed, As the rattle and the rhyme of the tenor-drummer's time Filled all the hungry hearts of us with melody sublime! How the grand band-wagon shone with a splendor all its own, And glittered with a glory that our dreams had never known! And how the boys behind, high and low of every kind, Marched in unconscious capture, with a rapture undefined! How the horsemen, two and two, with their plumes of white and blue And crimson, gold and purple, nodding by at me and you, Waved the banners that they bore, as the knights in days of yore, Till our glad eyes gleamed and glistened like the spangles that they wore! How the graceless-graceful stride of the elephant was eyed, And the capers of the little horse that cantered at his side! How the shambling camels, tame to the plaudits of their fame, With listless eyes came silent, masticating as they came. How the cages jolted past, with each wagon battened fast, And the mystery within it only hinted of at last From the little grated square in the rear, and nosing there The snout of some strange animal that sniffed the outer air! And, last of all, The Clown, making mirth for all the town, With his lips curved ever upward and his eyebrows ever down, And his chief attention paid to the little mule that played A tattoo on the dashboard with his heels, in the Parade. Oh! the Circus-Day Parade! How the bugles played and played! And how the glossy horses tossed their flossy manes and neighed, As the rattle and the rhyme of the tenor-drummer's time Filled all the hungry hearts of us with melody sublime! WHEN THE FROST IS ON THE PUNKIN When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder's in the shock, And you hear the kyouck and gobble of the struttin' turkey-cock, And the clackin' of the guineys, and the cluckin' of the hens, And the rooster's hallylooyer as he tiptoes on the fence; O, it's then's the times a feller is a-feelin' at his best, With the risin' sun to greet him from a night of peaceful rest, As he leaves the house, bareheaded, and goes out to feed the stock, When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder's in the shock. They's something kindo' harty-like about the atmusfere When the heat of summer's over and the coolin' fall is hereâ Of course we miss the flowers, and the blossums on the trees, And the mumble of the hummin'-birds and buzzin' of the bees; But the air's so appetizin'; and the landscape through the haze Of a crisp and sunny morning of the airly autumn days Is a pictur' that no painter has the colorin' to mockâ When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder's in the shock. The husky, rusty russel of the tossels of the corn, And the raspin' of the tangled leaves, as golden as the morn; The stubble in the furriesâkindo' lonesome-like, but still A-preachin' sermuns to us of the barns they growed to fill; The strawstack in the medder, and the reaper in the shed; The hosses in theyr stalls belowâthe clover over-headâ O, it sets my hart a-clickin' like the tickin' of a clock, When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder's in the shock! Then your apples all is getherd, and the ones a feller keeps Is poured around the celler-floor in red and yeller heaps; And your cider-makin' 's over, and your wimmern-folks is through With their mince and apple-butter, and theyr souse and saussage, too! ... I don't know how to tell itâbut ef sich a thing could be As the Angels wantin' boardin', and they'd call around on meâ I'd want to 'commodate 'emâall the whole-indurin' flockâ When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder's in the shock! THAT NIGHT You and I, and that night, with its perfume and glory!â The scent of the locustsâthe light of the moon; And the violin weaving the waltzers a story, Enmeshing their feet in the weft of the tune, Till their shadows uncertain Reeled round on the curtain, While under the trellis we drank in the June. Soaked through with the midnight the cedars were sleeping, Their shadowy tresses outlined in the bright Crystal, moon-smitten mists, where the fountain's heart, leaping Forever, forever burst, full with delight; And its lisp on my spirit Fell faint as that near it Whose love like a lily bloomed out in the night. O your glove was an odorous sachet of blisses! The breath of your fan was a breeze from Cathay! And the rose at your throat was a nest of spilled kisses!â And the music!âin fancy I hear it to-day, As I sit here, confessing Our secret, and blessing My rival who found us, and waltzed you away. THE BAT I Thou dread, uncanny thing, With fuzzy breast and leathern wing, In mad, zigzagging flight, Notching the dusk, and buffeting The black cheeks of the night, With grim delight! II What witch's hand unhasps Thy keen claw-cornered wings From under the barn roof, and flings Thee forth, with chattering gasps, To scud the air, And nip the ladybug, and tear Her children's hearts out unaware? III The glowworm's glimmer, and the bright, Sad pulsings of the firefly's light, Are banquet lights to thee. O less than bird, and worse than beast, Thou Devil's self, or brat, at least, Grate not thy teeth at me! ON THE DEATH OF LITTLE MAHALA ASHCRAFT âLittle Haly! Little Haly!â cheeps the robin in the tree; âLittle Haly!â sighs the clover, âLittle Haly!â moans the bee; âLittle Haly! Little Haly!â calls the killdeer at twilight; And the katydids and crickets hollers âHaly!â all the night. The sunflowers and the hollyhawks droops over the garden fence; The old path down the garden walks still holds her footprints' dents; And the well-sweep's swingin' bucket seems to wait fer her to come And start it on its wortery errant down the old bee-gum. The beehives all is quiet; and the little Jersey steer, When any one comes nigh it, acts so lonesome-like and queer; And the little Banty chickens kindo' cutters faint and low, Like the hand that now was feedin' 'em was one they didn't know. They's sorrow in the waivin' leaves of all the apple trees; And sorrow in the harvest-sheaves, and sorrow in the breeze; And sorrow in the twitter of the swallers 'round the shed; And all the song her redbird sings is âLittle Haly's dead!â The medder 'pears to miss her, and the pathway through the grass, Whare the dewdrops ust to kiss her little bare feet as she passed; And the old pin in the gate-post seems to kindo'-sorto' doubt That Haly's little sunburnt hands'll ever pull it out. Did her father er her mother ever love her more'n me, Er her sisters er her brother prize her love more tendurly? I questionâand what answer?âonly tears, and tears alone, And ev'ry neghbor's eyes is full o' tear-drops as my own. âLittle Haly! Little Haly!â cheeps the robin in the tree; âLittle Haly!â sighs the clover, âLittle Haly!â moans the bee; âLittle Haly! Little Haly!â calls the killdeer at twilight, And the katydids and crickets hollers âHaly!â all the night. THE MULBERRY TREE O, it's many's the scenes which is dear to my mind As I think of my childhood so long left behind; The home of my birth, with its old puncheon-floor, And the bright morning-glorys that growed round the door; The warped clabboard roof whare the rain it run off Into streams of sweet dreams as I laid in the loft, Countin' all of the joys that was dearest to me, And a-thinkin' the most of the mulberry tree. And to-day as I dream, with both eyes wide-awake, I can see the old tree, and its limbs as they shake, And the long purple berries that rained on the ground Whare the pastur' was bald whare we trommpt it around. And again, peekin' up through the thick leafy shade, I can see the glad smiles of the friends when I strayed With my little bare feet from my own mother's knee To foller them off to the mulberry tree. Leanin' up in the forks, I can see the old rail, And the boy climbin' up it, claw, tooth, and toe-nail, And in fancy can hear, as he spits on his hands, The ring of his laugh and the rip of his pants. But that rail led to glory, as certin and shore As I'll never climb thare by that rout' any moreâ What was all the green lauruls of Fame unto me, With my brows in the boughs of the mulberry tree! Then it's who can fergit the old mulberry tree That he knowed in the days when his thoughts was as free As the flutterin' wings of the birds that flew out Of the tall wavin' tops as the boys come about? O, a crowd of my memories, laughin' and gay, Is a-climbin' the fence of that pastur' to-day, And a-pantin' with joy, as us boys ust to be, They go racin' acrost fer the mulberry tree. AUGUST O mellow month and merry month, Let me make love to you, And follow you around the world As knights their ladies do. I thought your sisters beautiful, Both May and April, too, But April she had rainy eyes, And May had eyes of blue. And JuneâI liked the singing Of her lipsâand liked her smileâ But all her songs were promises Of something, after while; And July's faceâthe lights and shades That may not long beguile With alternations o'er the wheat The dreamer at the stile. But you!âah, you are tropical, Your beauty is so rare; Your eyes are clearer, deeper eyes Than any, anywhere; Mysterious, imperious, Deliriously fair, O listless Andalusian maid, With bangles in your hair! TO MY OLD FRIEND, WILLIAM LEACHMAN Fer forty year and better you have been a friend to me, Through days of sore afflictions and dire adversity, You allus had a kind word of counsul to impart, Which was like a healin' 'intment to the sorrow of my hart. When I buried my first womern, William Leachman, it was you Had the only consolation that I could listen toâ Fer I knowed you had gone through it and had rallied from the blow, And when you said I'd do the same, I knowed you'd ort to know. But that time I'll long remember; how I wundered here and thareâ Through the settin'-room and kitchen, and out in the open airâ And the snowflakes whirlin', whirlin', and the fields a frozen glare, And the neghbors' sleds and wagons congergatin' ev'rywhare. I turned my eyes to'rds heaven, but the sun was hid away; I turned my eyes to'rds earth again, but all was cold and gray; And the clock, like ice a-crackin', clickt the icy hours in twoâ And my eyes'd never thawed out ef it hadn't been fer you! We set thare by the smoke-houseâme and you out thare aloneâ Me a-thinkin'âyou a-talkin' in a soothin' undertoneâ You a-talkin'âme a-thinkin' of the summers long ago, And a-writin' âMarthyâMarthyâ with my finger in the snow! William Leachman, I can see you jest as plane as I could then; And your hand is on my shoulder, and you rouse me up again; And I see the tears a-drippin' from your own eyes, as you say: âBe rickonciled and bear itâwe but linger fer a day!â At the last Old Settlers' Meetin' we went j'intly, you and meâ Your hosses and my wagon, as you wanted it to be; And sence I can remember, from the time we've neghbored here, In all sich friendly actions you have double-done your sheer. It was better than the meetin', too, that nine-mile talk we had Of the times when we first settled here and travel was so bad; When we had to go on hoss-back, and sometimes on âShanks's mare,â And âblazeâ a road fer them behind that had to travel thare. And now we was a-trottin' 'long a level gravel pike, In a big two-hoss road-wagon, jest as easy as you likeâ Two of us on the front seat, and our wimmern-folks behind, A-settin' in theyr Winsor-cheers in perfect peace of mind! And we pinted out old landmarks, nearly faded out of sight:â Thare they ust to rob the stage-coach; thare Gash Morgan had the fight With the old stag-deer that pronged himâhow he battled fer his life, And lived to prove the story by the handle of his knife. Thare the first griss-mill was put up in the Settlement, and we Had tuck our grindin' to it in the Fall of Forty-threeâ When we tuck our rifles with us, techin' elbows all the way, And a-stickin' right together ev'ry minute, night and day. Thare ust to stand the tavern that they called the âTravelers' Rest,â And thare, beyent the covered bridge, âThe Counterfitters' Nestââ Whare they claimed the house was ha'ntedâthat a man was murdered thare, And burried underneath the floor, er 'round the place somewhare. And the old Plank-road they laid along in Fifty-one er twoâ You know we talked about the times when the old road was new: How âUncle Samâ put down that road and never taxed the State Was a problum, don't you rickollect, we couldn't dimonstrate? Ways was devius, William Leachman, that me and you has past; But as I found you true at first, I find you true at last; And, now the time's a-comin' mighty nigh our jurney's end, I want to throw wide open all my soul to you, my friend. With the stren'th of all my bein', and the heat of hart and brane, And ev'ry livin' drop of blood in artery and vane, I love you and respect you, and I venerate your name, Fer the name of William Leachman and True Manhood's jest the same! THE GUIDE IMITATED We rode across the level plainâ Weâmy sagacious guide and I.â He knew the earthâthe airâthe sky; He knew when it would blow or rain, And when the weather would be dry: The bended blades of grass spake out To him when Redskins were about; The wagon tracks would tell him too, The very day that they rolled through: He knew their burdenâwhence they cameâ If any horse along were lame, And what its owner ought to do; He knew when it would snow; he knew, By some strange intuition, when The buffalo would overflow The prairies like a flood, and then Recede in their stampede again. He knew all thingsâyea, he did know The brand of liquor in my flask, And many times did tilt it up, Nor halt or hesitate one whit, Nor pause to slip the silver cup From off its crystal base, nor ask Why I preferred to drink from it. And more and more I plied him, and Did query of him o'er and o'er, And seek to lure from him the lore By which the man did understand These hidden things of sky and land: And, wrought upon, he sudden drew His bridleâwheeled, and caught my handâ Pressed it, as one that loved me true, And bade me listen. ......... There be few Like tales as strange to listen to! He told me allâHow, when a child, The Indians stole himâthere he laughedâ âThey stole me and I stole their craft!â Then slowly winked both eyes, and smiled, And went on ramblingly,ââAnd theyâ They reared me, and I ran awayâ 'Twas winter, and the weather wild; And, caught up in the awful snows That bury wilderness and plain, I struggled on until I froze My feet ere human hands again Were reached to me in my distress,â And lo, since then not any rain May fall upon me anywhere, Nor any cyclone's cussedness Slip up behind me unaware,â Nor any change of cold, or heat, Or blow, or snow, but I do know It's coming, days and days before;â I know it by my frozen feetâ I know it by my itching heels, And by the agony one feels Who knows that scratching nevermore Will bring to him the old and sweet Relief he knew ere thus endowed With knowledge that a certain cloud Will burst with storm on such a day, And when a snow will fall, andânay, I speak not falsely when I say That by my tingling heels and toes I measure time, and can disclose The date of monthâthe weekâand lo, The very day and minuteâyeaâ Look at your watch!âAn hour ago And twenty minutes I did say Unto myself with bitter laugh, âIn less than one hour and a half Will I be drunken!â Is it so?â SUTTER'S CLAIM Say! you feller! Youâ With that spade and the pick!â What do you 'pose to do On this side o' the crick? Goin' to tackle this claim? Well, I reckon You'll let up ag'in, purty quick! No bluff, understand,â But the same has been tried, And the claim never pannedâ Or the fellers has lied,â For they tell of a dozen that tried it, And quit it most onsatisfied. The luck's dead ag'in' it!â The first man I see That stuck a pick in it Proved that thing to me,â For he sort o' took down, and got homesick, And went back whar he'd orto be! Then others they worked it Someâmore or less, But finally shirked it, In grades of distress,â With an eye outâa jaw or skull busted, Or some sort o' seriousness. The last one was pluckyâ He wasn't afeerd, And bragged he was âlucky,â And said that âhe'd heerd A heap of bluff-talk,â and swore awkard He'd work any claim that he keered! Don't you strike nary lick With that pick till I'm through; This-here feller talked slick And as peart-like as you! And he says: âI'll abide here As long as I please!â But he didn't. ... He died hereâ And I'm his disease! DOLORES Lithe-armed, and with satin-soft shoulders As white as the cream-crested wave; With a gaze dazing every beholder's, She holds every gazer a slave: Her hair, a fair haze, is outfloated And flared in the air like a flame; Bare-breasted, bare-browed and bare-throatedâ Too smooth for the soothliest name. She wiles you with wine, and wrings for you Ripe juices of citron and grape; She lifts up her lute and sings for you Till the soul of you seeks no escape; And you revel and reel with mad laughter, And fall at her feet, at her beck, And the scar of her sandal thereafter You wear like a gyve round your neck. MY FIDDLE My fiddle?âWell, I kindo' keep her handy, don't you know! Though I ain't so much inclined to tromp the strings and switch the bow As I was before the timber of my elbows got so dry, And my fingers was more limber-like and caperish and spry; Yit I can plonk and plunk and plink, And tune her up and play, And jest lean back and laugh and wink At ev'ry rainy day! My playin' 's only middlin'âtunes I picked up when a boyâ The kindo'-sorto' fiddlin' that the folks call âcordaroyâ; âThe Old Fat Gal,â and âRye-straw,â and âMy Sailyor's on the Sea,â Is the old cowtillions I âsawâ when the ch'ice is left to me; And so I plunk and plonk and plink, And rosum-up my bow And play the tunes that makes you think The devil's in your toe! I was allus a-romancin', do-less boy, to tell the truth, A-fiddlin' and a-dancin', and a-wastin' of my youth, And a-actin' and a-cuttin'-up all sorts o' silly pranks That wasn't worth a button of anybody's thanks! But they tell me, when I used to plink And plonk and plunk and play, My music seemed to have the kink O' drivin' cares away! That's how this here old fiddle's won my hart's indurin' love! From the strings acrost her middle, to the schreechin' keys aboveâ From her âapern,â over âbridge,â and to the ribbon round her throat, She's a wooin', cooin' pigeon, singin' âLove meâ ev'ry note! And so I pat her neck, and plink Her strings with lovin' hands,â And, list'nin' clos't, I sometimes think She kindo' understands! NORTH AND SOUTH Of the North I wove a dream, All bespangled with the gleam Of the glancing wings of swallows Dipping ripples in a stream, That, like a tide of wine, Wound through lands of shade and shine Where purple grapes hung bursting on the vine. And where orchard-boughs were bent Till their tawny fruitage blent With the golden wake that marked the Way the happy reapers went; Where the dawn died into noon As the May-mists into June, And the dusk fell like a sweet face in a swoon. Of the South I dreamed: And there Came a vision clear and fair As the marvelous enchantments Of the mirage of the air; And I saw the bayou-trees, With their lavish draperies, Hang heavy o'er the moon-washed cypress-knees. Peering from lush fens of rice, I beheld the Negro's eyes, Lit with that old superstition Death itself can not disguise; And I saw the palm-tree nod Like an Oriental god, And the cotton froth and bubble from the pod. And I dreamed that North and South, With a sigh of dew and drouth, Blew each unto the other The salute of lip and mouth; And I wakened, awed and thrilledâ Every doubting murmur stilled In the silence of the dream I found fulfilled. THE DAYS GONE BY O the days gone by! O the days gone by! The apples in the orchard, and the pathway through the rye; The chirrup of the robin, and the whistle of the quail As he piped across the meadows sweet as any nightingale; When the bloom was on the clover, and the blue was in the sky, And my happy heart brimmed over, in the days gone by. In the days gone by, when my naked feet were tripped By the honeysuckle tangles where the water-lilies dipped, And the ripples of the river lipped the moss along the brink Where the placid-eyed and lazy-footed cattle came to drink, And the tilting snipe stood fearless of the truant's wayward cry And the splashing of the swimmer, in the days gone by. O the days gone by! O the days gone by! The music of the laughing lip, the luster of the eye; The childish faith in fairies, and Aladdin's magic ringâ The simple, soul-reposing, glad belief in every thing,â When life was like a story holding neither sob nor sigh, In the golden olden glory of the days gone by. THE CLOVER Some sings of the lilly, and daisy, and rose, And the pansies and pinks that the Summertime throws In the green grassy lap of the medder that lays Blinkin' up at the skyes through the sunshiny days; But what is the lilly and all of the rest Of the flowers, to a man with a hart in his brest That was dipped brimmin' full of the honey and dew Of the sweet clover-blossoms his babyhood knew? I never set eyes on a clover-field now, Er fool round a stable, er climb in the mow, But my childhood comes back jest as clear and as plane As the smell of the clover I'm sniffin' again; And I wunder away in a barefooted dream, Whare I tangle my toes in the blossoms that gleam With the dew of the dawn of the morning of love Ere it wept ore the graves that I'm weepin' above. And so I love cloverâit seems like a part Of the sacerdest sorrows and joys of my hart; And wharever it blossoms, oh, thare let me bow And thank the good God as I'm thankin' Him now; And I pray to Him still fer the stren'th when I die, To go out in the clover and tell it good-by, And lovin'ly nestle my face in its bloom While my soul slips away on a breth of purfume. GEORGE A. CARR O playmate of the far-away And dear delights of Boyhood's day, And friend and comrade true and tried Through length of years of life beside, I bid you thus a fond farewell Too deep for words or tears to tell. But though I lose you, nevermore To greet you at the open door, To grasp your hand or see your smile, I shall be thankful all the while Because your love and loyalty Have made a happier world for me. So rest you, Playmate, in that land Still hidden from us by His hand, Where you may know again in truth All of the glad days of your youthâ As when in days of endless ease We played beneath the apple trees.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME IV THE SOUTH WIND AND THE SUN O the South Wind and the Sun! How each loved the other oneâ Full of fancyâfull of follyâ Full of jollity and fun! How they romped and ran about, Like two boys when school is out, With glowing face, and lisping lip, Low laugh, and lifted shout! And the South Windâhe was dressed With a ribbon round his breast That floated, flapped and fluttered In a riotous unrest, And a drapery of mist From the shoulder and the wrist Flowing backward with the motion Of the waving hand he kissed. And the Sun had on a crown Wrought of gilded thistle-down, And a scarf of velvet vapor, And a raveled-rainbow gown; And his tinsel-tangled hair, Tossed and lost upon the air, Was glossier and flossier Than any anywhere. And the South Wind's eyes were two Little dancing drops of dew, As he puffed his cheeks, and pursed his lips, And blew and blew and blew! And the Sun'sâlike diamond-stone, Brighter yet than ever known, As he knit his brows and held his breath, And shone and shone and shone! And this pair of merry fays Wandered through the summer days; Arm in arm they went together Over heights of morning hazeâ Over slanting slopes of lawn Then went on and on and on, Where the daisies looked like star-tracks Trailing up and down the dawn. And where'er they found the top Of a wheat-stalk droop and lop They chucked it underneath the chin And praised the lavish crop. Till it lifted with the pride Of the heads it grew beside, And then the South Wind and the Sun Went onward satisfied. Over meadow-lands they tripped, Where the dandelions dipped In crimson foam of clover-bloom, And dripped and dripped and dripped; And they clinched the bumble-stings, Gauming honey on their wings, And bundling them in lily-bells, With maudlin murmurings. And the humming-bird, that hung Like a jewel up among The tilted honeysuckle-horns, They mesmerized, and swung In the palpitating air, Drowsed with odors strange and rare, And, with whispered laughter, slipped away, And left him hanging there. And they braided blades of grass Where the truant had to pass; And they wriggled through the rushes And the reeds of the morass, Where they danced, in rapture sweet, O'er the leaves that laid a street Of undulant mosaic for The touches of their feet. By the brook with mossy brink Where the cattle came to drink, They trilled and piped and whistled With the thrush and bobolink, Till the kine, in listless pause, Switched their tails in mute applause, With lifted heads, and dreamy eyes, And bubble-dripping jaws. And where the melons grew, Streaked with yellow, green and blue, These jolly sprites went wandering Through spangled paths of dew; And the melons, here and there, They made love to, everywhere, Turning their pink souls to crimson With caresses fond and fair. Over orchard walls they went, Where the fruited boughs were bent Till they brushed the sward beneath them Where the shine and shadow blent; And the great green pear they shook Till the sallow hue forsook Its features, and the gleam of gold Laughed out in every nook. And they stroked the downy cheek Of the peach, and smoothed it sleek, And flushed it into splendor; And, with many an elfish freak, Gave the russet's rust a wipeâ Prankt the rambo with a stripe, And the wine-sap blushed its reddest As they spanked the pippins ripe. Through the woven ambuscade That the twining vines had made, They found the grapes, in clusters, Drinking up the shine and shadeâ Plumpt, like tiny skins of wine, With a vintage so divine That the tongue of fancy tingled With the tang of muscadine. And the golden-banded bees, Droning o'er the flowery leas, They bridled, reined, and rode away Across the fragrant breeze, Till in hollow oak and elm They had groomed and stabled them In waxen stalls that oozed with dews Of rose and lily-stem. Where the dusty highway leads, High above the wayside weeds, They sowed the air with butterflies Like blooming flower-seeds, Till the dull grasshopper sprung Half a man's height up, and hung Tranced in the heat, with whirring wings, And sung and sung and sung! And they loitered, hand in hand, Where the snipe along the sand Of the river ran to meet them As the ripple meets the land, Till the dragon-fly, in light Gauzy armor, burnished bright, Came tilting down the waters In a wild, bewildered flight. And they heard the killdee's call, And afar, the waterfall, But the rustle of a falling leaf They heard above it all; And the trailing willow crept Deeper in the tide that swept The leafy shallop to the shore, And wept and wept and wept! And the fairy vessel veered From its mooringsâtacked and steered For the center of the currentâ Sailed away and disappeared: And the burthen that it bore From the long-enchanted shoreâ âAlas! the South Wind and the Sun!â I murmur evermore. For the South Wind and the Sun, Each so loves the other one, For all his jolly folly And frivolity and fun, That our love for them they weigh As their fickle fancies may, And when at last we love them most, They laugh and sail away. WHERE-AWAY O the Lands of Where-Away! Tell usâtell usâwhere are they? Through the darkness and the dawn We have journeyed on and onâ From the cradle to the crossâ From possession unto loss.â Seeking still, from day to day, For the Lands of Where-Away. When our baby-feet were first Planted where the daisies burst, And the greenest grasses grew In the fields we wandered through,â On, with childish discontent, Ever on and on we went, Hoping still to pass, some day, O'er the verge of Where-Away. Roses laid their velvet lips On our own, with fragrant sips; But their kisses held us not, All their sweetness we forgot;â Though the brambles in our track Plucked at us to hold us backâ âJust ahead,â we used to say, âLie the Lands of Where-Away.â Children at the pasture-bars, Through the dusk, like glimmering stars, Waved their hands that we should bide With them over eventide: Down the dark their voices failed Falteringly, as they hailed, And died into yesterdayâ Night ahead andâWhere-Away? Twining arms about us thrownâ Warm caresses, all our own, Can but stay us for a spellâ Love hath little new to tell To the soul in need supreme, Aching ever with the dream Of the endless bliss it may Find in Lands of Where-Away! THE SMITTEN PURIST And the Charming Miss Smith's Effect Upon Him Thweet Poethy! let me lithp forthwith, That I may thhing of the name of Smithâ Which name, alath! In Harmony hath No adequate rhyme, letht you grant me thith,â That the thimple thibillant thound of ethâ (Which to thave my thoul, I can not expreth!) Thuth I may thhingingly, Wooingly and winningly Thuâthuâthound in the name of Smith. O give me a name that will rhyme with Smith,â For wild and weird ath the sthrange name ith, I would sthrangle a sthrain And a thad refrain Faint and sthweet ath a whithpered kissth; I would thhing thome thong for the mythtic mitth Who beareth the thingular name of Smithâ The dathzlingly brilli-ant, Rarely rethilliant Apâpupâpellation of Smith! O had I a name that would rhyme with Smithâ Thome rhythmical tincture of rethonant blithâ Thome melody rare Ath the cherubth blare On them little trumpeths they're foolin' withâ I would thit me down, and I'd thhing like thith Of the girl of the thingular name of Smithâ The sthrangely curiouth, Rich and luxuriouth Pupâpatronymic of Smith! CHRISTINE BRAIBRY THE BEAUTIFUL DOLLY WHO COMES FROM TENTOLEENA LAND BRINGING A STRANGE LETTER The Letter This little Dolly's name is Christine Braibry. The terminal of this name is sounded short, as in âlovely.â She was born in Tentoleena Land, where lilies and red roses grow in the air, and humming-birds and butterflies on stalks. You must be kind to Christine, for everything about her in your land will be very strange to her. If she seems to stare in a bewildered way, and will not answer when you ask her why, you must know that she is simply dazed with the wonders that she sees on every hand. It will doubtless be a long, long while before Christine will cease to marvel at the Sunshine of your strange country; for in Tentoleena Land there is never any shine but Moonshine, and sometimes that gets so muddied up with shade it soils the eyesight to gaze at it overmuch. It will be trying, in your land, for Christine to keep silent all the time, for, in your country, Dollies can not walk and talk at all perfectly, because they only think they are dreaming all the time, and they dare not speak for fear their voices will awaken them, and they dare not move for fear of falling out of bed. So, you see, you should be very kind indeed to little Christine Braibry. In Tentoleena Land the Dollies do not sleep long âthey are always the first ones up at Moon-dawnâ for Moon-dawn is the Dollies' morning. Then they go out in the fragrant grasses, where the big, ripe dewdrops growâmuch nicer, purer dew than yours on yours on earth, for in Tentoleena Land they gather it before it has been skimmed, and all the pearly cream that gathers on the surface of the drops they stir up with the rest and bathe in that; and this is why the Dollies always have such delicate complexions. Then, when the baths are over, they dress themselves, and waken their parents, and dress themâ for in Tentoleena Land the parents are the children. Is not that odd? Sometime Christine may get used to your strange land and all the wonders that she sees; and if she ever does, and smiles at you, and pulls your face down close to hers and kisses you, why, that will be the sign by which you'll know she's coming to again and wants to talk; and so the first thing you must ask of her is to sing this little song she made of Tentoleena Land. Only the words of it can be given hereâ(not half the beauty of the dainty song)âfor when you hear it, in the marvelously faint, and low, and sweet, and tender, tinkling tongue of Tentoleena Land, you will indeed be glad that the gracious fairy Fortune ever sent you Christine Braibry. So, since all the sounds in the melodious utterance of Tentoleena Land are so exquisitely, so chastely, rarely beautiful no earthly art may hope to reproduce them, you must, as you here read the words, just shut your eyes and fancy that you hear little Christine Braibry singing this eery song of hers:â CHRISTINE'S SONG Up in Tentoleena Landâ Tentoleena! Tentoleena! All the Dollies, hand in hand, Mina, Nainie, and Serena, Dance the Fairy fancy dances, With glad songs and starry glances, Lisping roundelays; and, after, Bird-like interludes of laughter Strewn and scattered o'er the lawn Their gilt sandals twinkle on Through light mists of silver sandâ Up in Tentoleena Land. Up in Tentoleena Landâ Tentoleena! Tentoleena! Blares the eery Elfin bandâ Trumpet, harp and concertinaâ Larkspur bugleâhoneysuckle Cornet, with a quickstep chuckle In its golden throat; and, maybe, Lilies-of-the-valley they be Baby-silver-bells that chime Musically all the time, Tossed about from hand to handâ Up in Tentoleena Land. Up in Tentoleena Landâ Tentoleena! Tentoleena! Dollies dark, and blond and blandâ Sweet as musk-rose or verbenaâ Sweet as moon-blown daffodillies, Or wave-jostled water-lilies Yearning to'rd the rose-mouths, ready Leaning o'er the river's eddy,â Dance, and glancing fling to you, Through these lines you listen to, Kisses blown from lip and hand Out of Tentoleena Land! DEAR HANDS The touches of her hands are like the fall Of velvet snowflakes; like the touch of down The peach just brushes 'gainst the garden wall; The flossy fondlings of the thistle-wisp Caught in the crinkle of a leaf of brown The blighting frost hath turned from green to crisp. Soft as the falling of the dusk at night, The touches of her hands, and the delightâ The touches of her hands! The touches of her hands are like the dew That falls so softly down no one e'er knew The touch thereof save lovers like to one Astray in lights where ranged Endymion. O rarely soft, the touches of her hands, As drowsy zephyrs in enchanted lands; Or pulse of dying fay; or fairy sighs; Orâin between the midnight and the dawn, When long unrest and tears and fears are goneâ Sleep, smoothing down the lids of weary eyes. WINTER FANCIES I Winter without And warmth within; The winds may shout And the storm begin; The snows may pack At the window-pane, And the skies grow black, And the sun remain Hidden away The livelong dayâ But hereâin here is the warmth of May! II Swoop your spitefulest Up the flue, Wild Windsâdo! What in the world do I care for you? O delightfulest Weather of all, Howl and squall, And shake the trees till the last leaves fall! III The joy one feels, In an easy-chair, Cocking his heels In the dancing air That wreathes the rim of a roaring stove Whose heat loves better than hearts can love, Will not permit The coldest day To drive away The fire in his blood, and the bliss of it! IV Then blow, Winds, blow! And rave and shriek, And snarl and snow, Till your breath grows weakâ While here in my room I'm as snugly shut As a glad little worm In the heart of a nut! âA BRAVE REFRAINâ When snow is here, and the trees look weird, And the knuckled twigs are gloved with frost; When the breath congeals in the drover's beard, And the old pathway to the barn is lost; When the rooster's crow is sad to hear, And the stamp of the stabled horse is vain, And the tone of the cow-bell grieves the earâ O then is the time for a brave refrain! When the gears hang stiff on the harness-peg, And the tallow gleams in frozen streaks; And the old hen stands on a lonesome leg, And the pump sounds hoarse and the handle squeaks; When the wood-pile lies in a shrouded heap, And the frost is scratched from the window-pane And anxious eyes from the inside peepâ O then is the time for a brave refrain! When the ax-helve warms at the chimney-jamb, And hobnailed shoes on the hearth below, And the house-cat curls in a slumber calm, And the eight-day clock ticks loud and slow; When the harsh broom-handle jabs the ceil 'Neath the kitchen-loft, and the drowsy brain Sniffs the breath of the morning mealâ O then is the time for a brave refrain! Envoi When the skillet seethes, and a blubbering hot Tilts the lid of the coffee-pot, And the scent of the buckwheat cake grows plainâ O then is the time for a brave refrain! AS I SIT IN THE SILENCE Many pleasures of Youth have been buoyantly sungâ And, borne on the winds of delight, may they beat With their palpitant wings at the hearts of the Young, And in bosoms of Age find as warm a retreat!â Yet sweetest of all of the musical throng, Though least of the numbers that upward aspire, Is the one rising now into wavering song, As I sit in the silence and gaze in the fire. 'Tis a Winter long dead that beleaguers my door And muffles his steps in the snows of the past: And I see, in the embers I'm dreaming before, Lost faces of love as they looked on me last:â The round, laughing eyes of the desk-mate of old Gleam out for a moment with truant desireâ Then fade and are lost in a City of Gold, As I sit in the silence and gaze in the fire. And then comes the face, peering back in my own, Of a shy little girl, with her lids drooping low, As she faltering tells, in a far-away tone, The ghost of a story of long, long ago.â Then her dewy blue eyes they are lifted again; But I see their glad light slowly fail and expire, As I reach and cry to her in vain, all in vain!â As I sit in the silence and gaze in the fire. Then the face of a Mother looks back, through the mist Of the tears that are welling; and, lucent with light, I see the dear smile of the lips I have kissed As she knelt by my cradle at morning and night; And my arms are outheld, with a yearning too wild For any but God in His love to inspire, As she pleads at the foot of His throne for her child,â As I sit in the silence and gaze in the fire. O pathos of rapture! O glorious pain! My heart is a blossom of joy overrun With a shower of tears, as a lily with rain That weeps in the shadow and laughs in the sun The blight of the frost may descend on the tree, And the leaf and the flower may fall and expire, But ever and ever love blossoms for me, As I sit in the silence and gaze in the fire. LONGFELLOW'S LOVE FOR THE CHILDREN Awake, he loved their voices, And wove them into his rhyme; And the music of their laughter Was with him all the time. Though he knew the tongues of nations, And their meanings all were dear, The prattle and lisp of a little child Was the sweetest for him to hear. A SONG OF LONG AGO A song of Long Ago: Sing it lightlyâsing it lowâ Sing it softlyâlike the lisping of the lips we used to know When our baby-laughter spilled From the glad hearts ever filled With music blithe as robin ever trilled! Let the fragrant summer breeze, And the leaves of locust-trees, And the apple-buds and -blossoms, and the wings of honey-bees, All palpitate with glee, Till the happy harmony Brings back each childish joy to you and me. Let the eyes of fancy turn Where the tumbled pippins burn Like embers in the orchard's lap of tangled grass and fern,â There let the old path wind In and out, and on behind The cider-press that chuckles as we grind. Blend in the song the moan Of the dove that grieves alone, And the wild whir of the locust, and the bumble's drowsy drone; And the low of cows that call Through the pasture-bars when all The landscape fades away at evenfall. Then, far away and clear, Through the dusky atmosphere, Let the wailing of the killdee be the only sound we hear: O sad and sweet and low As the memory may know Is the glad-pathetic song of Long Ago! UNLESS Who has not wanted does not guess What plenty is.âWho has not groped In depths of doubt and hopelessness Has never truly hoped.â Unless, sometimes, a shadow falls Upon his mirth, and veils his sight, And from the darkness drifts the light Of love at intervals. And that most dear of everything, I hold, is love; and who can sit With lightest heart and laugh and sing, Knows not the worth of it.â Unless, in some strange throng, perchance, He feels how thrilling sweet it is, One yearning look that answers hisâ The troth of glance and glance. Who knows not pain, knows not, alas! What pleasure is.âWho knows not of The bitter cup that will not pass, Knows not the taste of love. O souls that thirst, and hearts that fast, And natures faint with famishing, God lift and lead and safely bring You to your own at last! WHEN EARLY MARCH SEEMS MIDDLE MAY When country roads begin to thaw In mottled spots of damp and dust, And fences by the margin draw Along the frosty crust Their graphic silhouettes, I say, The Spring is coming round this way. When morning-time is bright with sun And keen with wind, and both confuse The dancing, glancing eyes of one With tears that ooze and oozeâ And nose-tips weep as well as they, The Spring is coming round this way. When suddenly some shadow-bird Goes wavering beneath the gaze, And through the hedge the moan is heard Of kine that fain would graze In grasses new, I smile and say, The Spring is coming round this way. When knotted horse-tails are untied, And teamsters whistle here and there, And clumsy mitts are laid aside And choppers' hands are bare, And chips are thick where children play, The Spring is coming round this way. When through the twigs the farmer tramps, And troughs are chunked beneath the trees, And fragrant hints of sugar-camps Astray in every breeze,â When early March seems middle May, The Spring is coming round this way. When coughs are changed to laughs, and when Our frowns melt into smiles of glee, And all our blood thaws out again In streams of ecstasy, And poets wreak their roundelay, The Spring is coming round this way. THE MUSKINGUM VALLEY The Muskingum Valley!âHow longin' the gaze A feller throws back on its long summer days, When the smiles of its blossoms and my smiles wuz one- And-the-same, from the rise to the set o' the sun: Wher' the hills sloped as soft as the dawn down to noon, And the river run by like an old fiddle-tune, And the hours glided past as the bubbles 'ud glide, All so loaferin'-like, 'long the path o' the tide. In the Muskingum Valleyâit 'peared like the skies Looked lovin' on me as my own mother's eyes, While the laughin'-sad song of the stream seemed to be Like a lullaby angels was wastin' on meâ Tel, swimmin' the air, like the gossamer's thread, 'Twixt the blue underneath and the blue overhead, My thoughts went astray in that so-to-speak realm Wher' Sleep bared her breast as a piller fer them. In the Muskingum Valley, though far, far a-way, I know that the winter is bleak there to-dayâ No bloom ner perfume on the brambles er treesâ Wher' the buds ust to bloom, now the icicles freeze.â That the grass is all hid 'long the side of the road Wher' the deep snow has drifted and shifted and blowedâ And I feel in my life the same changes is there,â The frost in my heart, and the snow in my hair. But, Muskingum Valley! my memory sees Not the white on the ground, but the green in the treesâ Not the froze'-over gorge, but the current, as clear And warm as the drop that has jes' trickled here; Not the choked-up ravine, and the hills topped with snow, But the grass and the blossoms I knowed long ago When my little bare feet wundered down wher' the stream In the Muskingum Valley flowed on like a dream. SERENADEâTO NORA The moonlight is failin'â The sad stars are palin'â The black wings av night are a-dhroopin' an' trailin'; The wind's miserere Sounds lonesome an' dreary; The katydid's dumb an' the nightingale's weary. Troth, Nora! I'm wadin' The grass an' paradin' The dews at your dure, wid my swate serenadin', Alone and forsaken, Whilst you're never wakin' To tell me you're wid me an' I am mistaken! Don't think that my singin' It's wrong to be flingin' Forninst av the dreams that the Angels are bringin'; For if your pure spirit Might waken and hear it, You'd never be draamin' the Saints could come near it, Then lave off your slaapin'â The pulse av me's laapin' To have the two eyes av yez down on me paapin'. Och, Nora! It's hopin' Your windy ye'll open And light up the night where the heart av me's gropin'. THE LITTLE WHITE HEARSE As the little white hearse went glimmering byâ The man on the coal-cart jerked his lines, And smutted the lid of either eye, And turned and stared at the business signs; And the street-car driver stopped and beat His hands on his shoulders, and gazed up-street Till his eye on the long track reached the skyâ As the little white hearse went glimmering by. As the little white hearse went glimmering byâ A stranger petted a ragged child In the crowded walks, and she knew not why, But he gave her a coin for the way she smiled; And a boot-black thrilled with a pleasure strange As a customer put back his change With a kindly hand and a grateful sigh, As the little white hearse went glimmering by. As the little white hearse went glimmering byâ A man looked out of a window dim, And his cheeks were wet and his heart was dry, For a dead child even was dear to him! And he thought of his empty life, and said:â âLoveless alive, and loveless deadâ Nor wife nor child in earth or sky!â As the little white hearse went glimmering by. A GLIMPSE OF PAN I caught but a glimpse of him. Summer was here, And I strayed from the town and its dust and heat, And walked in a wood, while the noon was near, Where the shadows were cool, and the atmosphere Was misty with fragrances stirred by my feet From surges of blossoms that billowed sheer Of the grasses, green and sweet. And I peered through a vista of leaning trees, Tressed with long tangles of vines that swept To the face of a river, that answered these With vines in the wave like the vines in the breeze, Till the yearning lips of the ripples crept And kissed them, with quavering ecstasies, And wistfully laughed and wept. And there, like a dream in a swoon, I swear I saw Pan lying,âhis limbs in the dew And the shade, and his face in the dazzle and glare Of the glad sunshine; while everywhere, Over, across, and around him blew Filmy dragon-flies hither and there, And little white butterflies, two and two, In eddies of odorous air. THE GREAT GOD PAN What was he doing, the great god Pan? âMrs. Browning O pan is the goodliest god, I wist, Of all the lovable gods that be!â For his two strong hands were the first to twist From the depths of the current, through spatter and mist, The long-hushed reeds that he pressed in glee To his murmurous mouth, as he chuckled and kissed Their souls into melody. And the wanton winds are in love with Pan: They loll in the shade with him day by day; And betimes as beast, and betimes as man, They love him as only the wild winds can,â Or sleeking the coat of his limbs one way, Or brushing his brow with the locks they fan To the airs he loves to play. And he leans by the river, in gloom and gleam, Blowing his reeds as the breezes blowâ His cheeks puffed out, and his eyes in a dream, And his hoof-tips, over the leaves in the stream, Tapping the time of the tunes that flow As sweet as the drowning echoes seem To his rollicking wraith below. HER LIGHT GUITAR She twankled a tune on her light guitarâ A low, sweet jangle of tangled sounds, As blurred as the voices of the fairies are, Dancing in moondawn dales and downs; And the tinkling drip of the strange refrain Ran over the rim of my soul like rain. The great blond moon in the midnight skies Paused and poised o'er the trellis eaves, And the stars, in the light of her upturned eyes, Sifted their love through the rifted leavesâ Glittered and splintered in crystal mist Down the glittering strings that her fingers kissed. O the melody mad! O the tinkle and thrill Of the ecstasy of the exquisite thing! The red rose dropped from the window-sill And lay in a long swoon quivering; While the dying notes of the strain divine Rippled in glee up my spell-bound spine. THE ALL-GOLDEN I Through every happy line I sing I feel the tonic of the Spring. The day is like an old-time face That gleams across some grassy placeâ An old-time faceâan old-time chum Who rises from the grave to come And lure me back along the ways Of time's all-golden yesterdays. Sweet day! to thus remind me of The truant boy I used to loveâ To set, once more, his finger-tips Against the blossom of his lips, And pipe for me the signal known By none but him and me alone! II I see, across the schoolroom floor, The shadow of the open door, And dancing dust and sunshine blent Slanting the way the morning went, And beckoning my thoughts afar Where reeds and running waters are; Where amber-colored bayous glass The half-drown'd weeds and wisps of grass, Where sprawling frogs, in loveless key, Sing on and on incessantly. Against the green wood's dim expanse The cattail tilts its tufted lance, While on its tipâone might declare The white âsnake-feederâ blossomed there! III I catch my breath, as children do In woodland swings when life is new, And all the blood is warm as wine And tingles with a tang divine. My soul soars up the atmosphere And sings aloud where God can hear, And all my being leans intent To mark His smiling wonderment. O gracious dream, and gracious time, And gracious theme, and gracious rhymeâ When buds of Spring begin to blow In blossoms that we used to know And lure us back along the ways Of time's all-golden yesterdays! THE WAY THE BABY CAME O this is the way the baby came: Out of the night as comes the dawn Out of the embers as the flame; Out of the bud the blossom on The apple-bough that blooms the same As in glad summers dead and goneâ With a grace and beauty none could nameâ O this is the way the baby came! THE WAY THE BABY WOKE And this is the way the baby woke: As when in deepest drops of dew The shine and shadows sink and soak, The sweet eyes glimmered through and through; And eddyings and dimples broke About the lips, and no one knew Or could divine the words they spokeâ And this is the way the baby woke. THE WAY THE BABY SLEPT This is the way the baby slept: A mist of tresses backward thrown By quavering sighs where kisses crept With yearnings she had never known: The little hands were closely kept About a lily newly blownâ And God was with her. And we wept.â And this is the way the baby slept. WHEN MAIMIE MARRIED When Maimie married Charley Brown, Joy took possession of the town; The young folks swarmed in happy throngsâ They rang the bellsâthey caroled songsâ They carpeted the steps that led Into the church where they were wed; And up and down the altar-stair They scattered roses everywhere; When, in her orange-blossom crown, Queen Maimie married Charley Brown. So beautiful she was, it seemed Men, looking on her, dreamed they dreamed; And he, the holy man who took Her hand in his, so thrilled and shook, The gargoyles round the ceiling's rim Looked down and leered and grinned at him, Until he half forgot his part Of sanctity, and felt his heart Beat worldward through his sacred gownâ When Maimie married Charley Brown. The bridemaids kissed her, left and rightâ Fond mothers hugged her with delightâ Young men of twenty-seven were seen To blush like lads of seventeen, The while they held her hand to quote Such sentiments as poets wrote.â Yea, all the heads that Homage bends Where bowed to her.âBut O my friends, My hopes went upâmy heart went downâ When Maimie marriedâCharley Brown! HER HAIR The beauty of her hair bewilders meâ Pouring adown the brow, its cloven tide Swirling about the ears on either side And storming round the neck tumultuously: Or like the lights of old antiquity Through mullioned windows, in cathedrals wide, Spilled moltenly o'er figures deified In chastest marble, nude of drapery. And so I love it.âEither unconfined; Or plaited in close braidings manifold; Or smoothly drawn; or indolently twined In careless knots whose coilings come unrolled At any lightest kiss; or by the wind Whipped out in flossy ravelings of gold. A VISION OF SUMMER 'Twas a marvelous vision of Summer.â That morning the dawn was late, And came, like a long dream-ridden guest, Through the gold of the Eastern gate. Languid it came, and halting As one that yawned, half roused, With lifted arms and indolent lids And eyes that drowsed and drowsed. A glimmering haze hung over The face of the smiling air; And the green of the trees and the blue of the leas And the skies gleamed everywhere. And the dewdrops' dazzling jewels, In garlands and diadems, Lightened and twinkled and glanced and shot As the glints of a thousand gems: Emeralds of dew on the grasses; The rose with rubies set; On the lily, diamonds; and amethysts Pale on the violet. And there were the pinks of the fuchsias, And the peony's crimson hue, The lavender of the hollyhocks, And the morning-glory's blue: The purple of the pansy bloom, And the passionate flush of the face Of the velvet-rose; and the thick perfume Of the locust every place. The air and the sun and the shadows Were wedded and made as one; And the winds ran over the meadows As little children run: And the winds poured over the meadows And along the willowy way The river ran, with its ripples shod With the sunshine of the day: O the winds flowed over the meadows In a tide of eddies and calms, And the bared brow felt the touch of it As a sweetheart's tender palms. And the lark went palpitating Up through the glorious skies, His song spilled down from the blue profound As a song from Paradise. And here was the loitering currentâ Stayed by a drift of sedge And sodden logsâscummed thick with the gold Of the pollen from edge to edge. The catbird piped in the hazel, And the harsh kingfisher screamed; And the crane, in amber and oozy swirls, Dozed in the reeds and dreamed. And in through the tumbled driftage And the tangled roots below, The waters warbled and gurgled and lisped Like the lips of long ago. And the senses caught, through the music, Twinkles of dabbling feet, And glimpses of faces in coverts green, And voices faint and sweet. And back from the lands enchanted, Where my earliest mirth was born, The trill of a laugh was blown to me Like the blare of an elfin horn. Again I romped through the clover; And again I lay supine On grassy swards, where the skies, like eyes, Looked lovingly back to mine. And over my vision floated Misty illusive thingsâ Trailing strands of the gossamer On heavenward wanderings: Figures that veered and wavered, Luring the sight, and then Glancing away into nothingness, And blinked into shape again. From out far depths of the forest, Ineffably sad and lorn, Like the yearning cry of a long-lost love, The moan of the dove was borne. And through lush glooms of the thicket The flash of the redbird's wings On branches of star-white blooms that shook And thrilled with its twitterings. Through mossy and viny vistas, Soaked ever with deepest shade, Dimly the dull owl stared and stared From his bosky ambuscade. And up through the rifted tree-tops That signaled the wayward breeze, I saw the hulk of the hawk becalmed Far out on the azure seas. Then sudden an awe fell on me, As the hush of the golden day Rounded to noon, as a May to June That a lover has dreamed away. And I heard, in the breathless silence, And the full, glad light of the sun, The tinkle and drip of a timorous showerâ Ceasing as it begun. And my thoughts, like the leaves and grasses, In a rapture of joy and pain, Seemed fondled and petted and beat upon With a tremulous patter of rain. WHILE CIGARETTES TO ASHES TURN I âHe smokesâand that's enough,â says Maâ âAnd cigarettes, at that!â says Pa. âHe must not call again,â says sheâ âHe shall not call again!â says he. They both glare at me as beforeâ Then quit the room and bang the door,â While I, their wilful daughter, say, âI guess I'll love him, anyway!â II At twilight, in his room, alone, His careless feet inertly thrown Across a chair, my fancy can But worship this most worthless man! I dream what joy it is to set His slow lips round a cigarette, With idle-humored whiff and puffâ Ah! this is innocent enough! To mark the slender fingers raise The waxen match's dainty blaze, Whose chastened light an instant glows On drooping lids and arching nose, Then, in the sudden gloom, instead, A tiny ember, dim and red, Blooms languidly to ripeness, then Fades slowly, and grows ripe again. III I lean back, in my own boudoirâ The door is fast, the sash ajar; And in the dark, I smiling stare At one wide window over there, Where some one, smoking, pinks the gloom, The darling darkness of his room! I push my shutters wider yet, And lo! I light a cigarette; And gleam for gleam, and glow for glow, Each pulse of light a word we know, We talk of love that still will burn While cigarettes to ashes turn. THE LITTLE RED RIBBON The little red ribbon, the ring and the rose! The summer-time comes, and the summer-time goesâ And never a blossom in all of the land As white as the gleam of her beckoning hand! The long winter months, and the glare of the snows; The little red ribbon, the ring and the rose! And never a glimmer of sun in the skies As bright as the light of her glorious eyes! Dreams only are true; but they fade and are goneâ For her face is not here when I waken at dawn; The little red ribbon, the ring and the rose Mine only; hers only the dream and repose. I am weary of waiting, and weary of tears, And my heart wearies, too, all these desolate years, Moaning over the one only song that it knows,â The little red ribbon, the ring and the rose! THE MAN IN THE MOON Said The Raggedy Man, on a hot afternoon: My! Sakes! What a lot o' mistakes Some little folks makes on The Main in the Moon! But people that's be'n up to see him, like me, And calls on him frequent and intimuttly, Might drop a few facts that would interest you Clean! Through!â If you wanted 'em toâ Some actual facts that might interest you! O The Man in the Moon has a crick in his back; Whee! Whimm! Ain't you sorry for him? And a mole on his nose that is purple and black; And his eyes are so weak that they water and run If he dares to dream even he looks at the sun,â So he jes' dreams of stars, as the doctors adviseâ My! Eyes! But isn't he wiseâ To jes' dream of stars, as the doctors advise? And The Man in the Moon has a boil on his earâ Whee! Whing! What a singular thing! I know! but these facts are authentic, my dear,â There's a boil on his ear; and a corn on his chinâ He calls it a dimpleâbut dimples stick inâ Yet it might be a dimple turned over, you know! Whang! Ho! Why, certainly so!â It might be a dimple turned over, you know! And The Man in the Moon has a rheumatic kneeâ Gee! Whizz! What a pity that is! And his toes have worked round where his heels ought to be.â So whenever he wants to go North he goes South, And comes back with porridge-crumbs all round his mouth, And he brushes them off with a Japanese fan, Whing! Whann! What a marvelous man! What a very remarkably marvelous man! And The Man in the Moon, sighed The Raggedy Man, Gits! So! Sullonesome, you know,â Up there by hisse'f sence creation began!â That when I call on him and then come away, He grabs me and holds me and begs me to stay,â TillâWell! if it wasn't fer Jimmy-cum-jim, Dadd! Limb! I'd go pardners with himâ Jes' jump my job here and be pardners with him! A BAREFOOT BOY A barefoot boy! I mark him at his playâ For May is here once more, and so is he,â His dusty trousers, rolled half to the knee, And his bare ankles grimy, too, as they: Cross-hatchings of the nettle, in array Of feverish stripes, hint vividly to me Of woody pathways winding endlessly Along the creek, where even yesterday He plunged his shrinking bodyâgasped and shookâ Yet called the water âwarm,â with never lack Of joy. And so, half enviously I look Upon this graceless barefoot and his track,â His toe stubbedâay, his big toe-nail knocked back Like unto the clasp of an old pocketbook. âTHE PREACHER'S BOYâ I rickollect the little tad, back, years and years agoâ âThe Preacher's Boyâ that every one despised and hated so! A meek-faced little feller, with white eyes and foxy hair, And a look like he expected ser'ous trouble everywhere: A sort o' fixed expression of suspicion in his glance; His bare feet always scratched with briers; and green stains on his pants; Molasses-marks along his sleeves; his cap-rim turned behindâ And so it is âThe Preacher's Boyâ is brought again to mind! My fancy even brings the sly marauder back so plain, I see him jump our garden-fence and slip off down the lane; And I seem to holler at him and git back the old reply: âOh, no: your peaches is too green fer such a worm as I!â Fer he scorned his father's phrasesâevery holy one he hadâ âAs good a man,â folks put it, âas that boy of his was bad!â And again from their old buggy-shed, I hear the ârod unsparedââ Of course that never âspoiled the childâ for which nobody cared! If any neighber ever found his gate without a latch, Or rines around the edges of his watermelon-patch; His pasture-bars left open; or his pump-spout chocked with clay, He'd swear 'twas âthat infernal Preacher's Boy,â right away! When strings was stretched acrost the street at night, and some one got An everlastin' tumble, and his nose broke, like as not, And laid it on âThe Preacher's Boyââno powers, low ner high, Could ever quite substantiate that boy's alibi! And did nobody like the boy?âWell, all the pets in town Would eat out of his fingers; and canaries would come down And leave their swingin' perches and their fish-bone jist to pick The little warty knuckles that the dogs would leap to lick.â No little snarlin', snappin' fiste but what would leave his bone To foller, ef he whistled, in that tantalizin' tone That made a goods-box whittler blasphemeusly protest âHe couldn't tell, 'twixt dog and boy, which one was ornriest!â 'Twas such a little cur as this, onc't, when the crowd was thick Along the streets, a drunken corner-loafer tried to kick, When a sudden foot behind him tripped him up, and falling so He âmarked his man,â and jerked his gunâdrawed up and let 'er go! And the crowd swarmed round the victimâholding close against his breast The little dog unharmed, in arms that still, as they caressed, Grew rigid in their last embrace, as with a smile of joy He recognized the dog was saved. So died âThe Preacher's Boyâ! When it appeared, before the Squire, that fatal pistol-ball Was fired at âa dangerous beast,â and not the boy at all, And the facts set forth established,âit was like-befittin' then To order out a possy of the âcity councilmenâ To kill the dog! But, strange to tell, they searched the country round, And never hide-ner-hair of that âsaidâ dog was ever found! And, somehow, then I sort o' thoughtâand half-way think, to-dayâ The spirit of âThe Preacher's Boyâ had whistled him away. WE TO SIGH INSTEAD OF SING âRain and rain! and rain and rain!â Yesterday we muttered Grimly as the grim refrain That the thunders uttered: All the heavens under cloudâ All the sunshine sleeping; All the grasses limply bowed With their weight of weeping. Sigh and sigh! and sigh and sigh! Never end of sighing; Rain and rain for our replyâ Hopes half drowned and dying; Peering through the window-pane, Naught but endless rainingâ Endless sighing, and, as vain, Endlessly complaining. Shine and shine! and shine and shine! Ah! to-day the splendor!â All this glory yours and mineâ God! but God is tender! We to sigh instead of sing, Yesterday, in sorrow, While the Lord was fashioning This for our To-morrow! NOTHIN' TO SAY Nothin' to say, my daughter! Nothin' at all to say! Gyrls that's in love, I've noticed, giner'ly has their way! Yer mother did, afore you, when her folks objected to meâ Yit here I am and here you air! and yer motherâwhere is she? You look lots like yer mother: purty much same in size; And about the same complected; and favor about the eyes: Like her, too, about livin' here, because she couldn't stay; It'll 'most seem like you was dead like her!âbut I hain't got nothin' to say! She left you her little Bibleâwrit yer name acrost the pageâ And left her ear-bobs fer you, ef ever you come of age; I've alluz kep' 'em and gyuarded 'em, but ef yer goin' awayâ Nothin' to say, my daughter! Nothin' at all to say! You don't rickollect her, I reckon? No: you wasn't a year old then! And now yerâhow old air you? W'y, child, not âtwentyâ! When? And yer nex' birthday's in Aprile? and you want to git married that day? I wisht yer mother was livin'!âbut I hain't got nothin' to say! Twenty year! and as good a gyrl as parent ever found! There's a straw ketched on to yer dress thereâI'll bresh it offâturn round. (Her mother was jes' twenty when us two run away.) Nothin' to say, my daughter! Nothin' at all to say! JACK-IN-THE-BOX Grandfather, musing In childish days! O memory, You bring such curious things to me!â Laughs to the lipâtears to the eye, In looking on the gifts that lie Like broken playthings scattered o'er Imagination's nursery floor! Did these old hands once click the key That let âJack'sâ box-lid upward fly, And that blear-eyed, fur-whiskered elf Leap, as though frightened at himself, And quiveringly lean and stare At me, his jailer, laughing there? A child then! NowâI only know They call me very old; and so They will not let me have my way,â But uselessly I sit all day Here by the chimney-jamb, and poke The lazy fire, and smoke and smoke, And watch the wreaths swoop up the flue, And chuckleâay, I often doâ Seeing again, all vividly, Jack-in-the-box leap, as in glee To see how much he looks like me! .... They talk. I can't hear what they sayâ But I am glad, clean through and through Sometimes, in fancying that they Are saying, âSweet, that fancy strays In age back to our childish days!â THE OLD TRUNDLE-BED O the old trundle-bed where I slept when a boy! What canopied king might not covet the joy? The glory and peace of that slumber of mine, Like a long, gracious rest in the bosom divine: The quaint, homely couch, hidden close from the light, But daintily drawn from its hiding at night. O a nest of delight, from the foot to the head, Was the queer little, dear little, old trundle-bed! O the old trundle-bed, where I wondering saw The stars through the window, and listened with awe To the sigh of the winds as they tremblingly crept Through the trees where the robin so restlessly slept: Where I heard the low, murmurous chirp of the wren, And the katydid listlessly chirrup again, Till my fancies grew faint and were drowsily led Through the maze of the dreams of the old trundle-bed. O the old trundle-bed! O the old trundle-bed! With its plump little pillow, and old-fashioned spread; Its snowy-white sheets, and the blankets above, Smoothed down and tucked round with the touches of love; The voice of my mother to lull me to sleep With the old fairy stories my memories keep Still fresh as the lilies that bloom o'er the head Once bowed o'er my own in the old trundle-bed. MY MARY My Mary, O my Mary! The simmer skies are blue: The dawnin' brings the dazzle, An' the gloamin' brings the dew,â The mirk o' nicht the glory O' the moon, an' kindles, too, The stars that shift aboon the lift.â But naething brings me you! Where is it, O my Mary, Ye are biding a' the while? I ha' wended by your windowâ I ha' waited by the stile, An' up an' down the river I ha' won for mony a mile, Yet never found, adrift or drown'd, Your lang-belated smile. Is it forgot, my Mary, How glad we used to be?â The simmer-time when bonny bloomed The auld trysting-tree,â How there I carved the name for you, An' you the name for me; An' the gloamin' kenned it only When we kissed sae tenderly. Speek ance to me, my Mary!â But whisper in my ear As light as ony sleeper's breath, An' a' my soul will hear; My heart shall stap its beating, An' the soughing atmosphere Be hushed the while I leaning smile An' listen to you, dear! My Mary, O my Mary! The blossoms bring the bees; The sunshine brings the blossoms, An' the leaves on a' the trees; The simmer brings the sunshine An' the fragrance o' the breeze,â But O wi'out you, Mary, I care naething for these! We were sae happy, Mary! O think how ance we saidâ Wad ane o' us gae fickle, Or ane o' us lie dead,â To feel anither's kisses We wad feign the auld instead, An' ken the ither's footsteps In the green grass owerhead. My Mary, O my Mary! Are ye dochter o' the air, That ye vanish aye before me As I follow everywhere?â Or is it ye are only But a mortal, wan wi' care, Sin' I search through a' the kirkyird An' I dinna find ye there? TWO SONNETS TO THE JUNE-BUG I. You make me jes' a little nervouser Than any dog-gone bug I ever see! And you know night's the time to pester meâ When any tetch at all 'll rub the fur Of all my patience back'ards! You're the myrrh And ruburb of my life! A bumblebee Cain't hold a candle to you; and a he Bald hornet, with a laminated spur In his hip-pocket, daresent even cheep When you're around! And, dern ye! you have made Me lose whole ricks and stacks and piles of sleep,â And many of a livelong night I've laid And never shut an eye, hearin' you keep Up that eternal buzzin' serenade! II And I've got up and lit the lamp, and clum On cheers and trunks and wash-stands and bureaus, And all such dangerous articles as those, And biffed at you with brooms, and never come 'In two feet of you,âmaybe skeered you some,â But what does that amount to when it throws A feller out o' balance, and his nose Gits barked ag'inst the mantel, while you hum Fer joy around the room, and churn your head Ag'inst the ceilin', and draw back and butt The plasterin' loose, and dropâbehind the bed, Where never human-bein' ever putt Harm's hand on you, er ever truthful said He'd choked yer dern infernal wizzen shut! ONE AFTERNOON Below, cool grasses: over us The maples waver tremulous. A slender overture above, Low breathing as a sigh of love At first, then gradually strong And stronger: 'tis the locust's song, Swoln midway to a pÃ¦an of glee, And lost in silence dwindlingly. Not utter silence; nay, for hid In ghosts of it, the katydid Chirrs a diluted echo of The loveless song he makes us love. The low boughs are drugged heavily With shade; the poem you read to me Is not more gracious than the trill Of birds that twitter as they will. Half consciously, with upturned eyes, I hear your voiceâI see the skies, Where, o'er bright rifts, the swallows glance Like glad thoughts o'er a countenance; And voices near and far are blent Like sweet chords of some instrument Awakened by the trembling touch Of hands that love it overmuch. Dear heart, let be the book a while! I want your faceâI want your smile! Tell me how gladder now are they Who look on us from Heaven to-day. THE BEAUTIFUL CITY The Beautiful City! Forever Its rapturous praises resound; We fain would behold itâbut never A glimpse of its glory is found: We slacken our lips at the tender White breasts of our mothers to hear Of its marvelous beauty and splendor;â We seeâbut the gleam of a tear! Yet never the story may tire usâ First graven in symbols of stoneâ Rewritten on scrolls of papyrus And parchment, and scattered and blown By the winds of the tongues of all nations, Like a litter of leaves wildly whirled Down the rack of a hundred translations, From the earliest lisp of the world. We compass the earth and the ocean, From the Orient's uttermost light, To where the last ripple in motion Lips hem of the skirt of the night,â But the Beautiful City evades usâ No spire of it glints in the sunâ No glad-bannered battlement shades us When all our long journey is done. Where lies it? We question and listen; We lean from the mountain, or mast, And see but dull earth, or the glisten Of seas inconceivably vast: The dust of the one blurs our vision, The glare of the other our brain, Nor city nor island Elysian In all of the land or the main! We kneel in dim fanes where the thunders Of organs tumultuous roll, And the longing heart listens and wonders, And the eyes look aloft from the soul: But the chanson grows fainter and fainter, Swoons wholly away and is dead; And our eyes only reach where the painter Has dabbled a saint overhead. The Beautiful City! O mortal, Fare hopefully on in thy quest, Pass down through the green grassy portal That leads to the Valley of Rest; There first passed the One who, in pity Of all thy great yearning, awaits To point out the Beautiful City, And loosen the trump at the gates. A LIFE TERM She was false, and he was true,â Thus their lives were rent apart; 'Twas his dagger driven through A mad rival's heart. He was shut away. The moon May not find him; nor the starsâ Nay, nor yet the sun of noon Pierce his prison bars. She was leftâagain to sinâ Mistress of all siren arts: The poor, soulless heroine Of a hundred hearts! Though she dare not think of him Who believed her lies, and so Sent a ghost adown the dim Path she dreads to go,â He, in fancy, smiling, sips Of her kisses, purer yet Than the dew upon the lips Of the violet. McFEETERS' FOURTH It was needless to say 'twas a glorious day, And to boast of it all in that spread-eagle way That our Forefathers had since the hour of the birth Of this most patriotic republic on earth! But 'twas justice, of course, to admit that the sight Of the old Stars-and-Stripes was a thing of delight In the eyes of a fellow, however he tried To look on the day with a dignified pride That meant not to brook any turbulent glee Or riotous flourish of loud jubilee! So argued McFeeters, all grim and severe, Who the long night before, with a feeling of fear, Had slumbered but fitfully, hearing the swish Of the sky-rocket over his roof, with the wish That the boy-fiend who fired it were fast to the end Of the stick to forever and ever ascend! Or to hopelessly ask why the boy with the horn And its horrible havoc had ever been born! Or to wish, in his wakefulness, staring aghast, That this Fourth of July were as dead as the last! So, yesterday morning, McFeeters arose, With a fire in his eyes, and a cold in his nose, And a guttural voice in appropriate key With a temper of gruff as a temper could be. He growled at the servant he met on the stair, Because he was whistling a national air, And he growled at the maid on the balcony, who Stood enrapt with the tune of âThe Red-White-and-Blueâ That a band was discoursing like mad in the street, With drumsticks that banged, and with cymbals that beat. And he growled at his wife, as she buttoned his vest, And applausively pinned a rosette on his breast Of the national colors, and lured from his purse Some change for the boysâfor fire-crakersâor worse; And she pointed with pride to a soldier in blue In a frame on the wall, and the colors there, too; And he felt, as he looked on the features, the glow The painter found there twenty long years ago, And a passionate thrill in his breast, as he felt Instinctively round for the sword in his belt. What was it that hung like a mist o'er the room?â The tumult withoutâand the musicâthe boom Of the cannonâthe blare of the bugle and fife?â No matter!âMcFeeters was kissing his wife, And laughing and crying and waving his hat Like a genuine soldier, and crazy, at that! âWas it needless to say 'twas a glorious day And to boast of it all in that spread-eagle way That our Forefathers had since the hour of the birth Of this most patriotic republic on earth? AT NINETY IN THE SHADE Hot weather? Yes; but really not, Compared with weather twice as hot. Find comfort, then, in arguing thus, And you'll pull through victorious!â For instance, while you gasp and pant And try to cool yourselfâand can'tâ With soda, cream and lemonade, The heat at ninety in the shade,â Just calmly sit and ponder o'er These same degrees, with ninety more On top of them, and so concede The weather now is cold indeed! Thinkâas the perspiration dews Your fevered brow, and seems to ooze From out the ends of every hairâ Whole floods of it, with floods to spareâ Think, I repeat, the while the sweat Pours down your spineâhow hotter yet Just ninety more degrees would be, And bear this ninety patiently! Thinkâas you mop your brow and hair, With sticky feelings everywhereâ How ninety more degrees increase Of heat like this would start the grease; Or, think, as you exhausted stand, A wilted âpalm-leafâ in each handâ When the thermometer has done With ease the lap of ninety-one; O think, I say, what heat might do At one hundred and eighty-twoâ Just twice the heat you now declare, Complainingly, is hard to bear. Or, as you watch the mercury Mount, still elate, one more degree, And doff your collar and cravat, And rig a sponge up in your hat, And ask Tom, Harry, Dick or Jim If this is hot enough for himâ Consider how the sun would pour At one hundred and eighty-fourâ Just twice the heat that seems to be Affecting you unpleasantly, The very hour that you might find As cool as dew, were you inclined. But why proceed when none will heed Advice apportioned to the need? How weather? Yes; but really not, Compared with weather twice as hot! A SUDDEN SHOWER Barefooted boys scud up the street Or skurry under sheltering sheds; And schoolgirl faces, pale and sweet, Gleam from the shawls about their heads. Doors bang; and mother-voices call From alien homes; and rusty gates Are slammed; and high above it all, The thunder grim reverberates. And then, abrupt,âthe rain! the rain!â The earth lies gasping; and the eyes Behind the streaming window-pane Smile at the trouble of the skies. The highway smokes; sharp echoes ring; The cattle bawl and cow-bells clank; And into town comes galloping The farmer's horse, with steaming flank. The swallow dips beneath the eaves And flirts his plumes and folds his wings; And under the Catawba leaves The caterpillar curls and clings. The bumblebee is pelted down The wet stem of the hollyhock; And sullenly, in spattered brown, The cricket leaps the garden-walk. Within, the baby claps his hands And crows with rapture strange and vague; Without, beneath the rose-bush stands A dripping rooster on one leg. GOOD-BY ER HOWDY-DO Say good-by er howdy-doâ What's the odds betwixt the two? Comin'âgoin', ev'ry dayâ Best friends first to go awayâ Grasp of hands you'd ruther hold Than their weight in solid gold Slips their grip while greetin' you.â Say good-by er howdy-do! Howdy-do, and then, good-byâ Mixes jes' like laugh and cry; Deaths and births, and worst and best, Tangled their contrariest; Ev'ry jinglin' weddin'-bell Skeerin' up some funer'l knell.â Here's my song, and there's your sigh.â Howdy-do, and then, good-by! Say good-by er howdy-doâ Jes' the same to me and you; 'Taint worth while to make no fuss, 'Cause the job's put up on us! Some One's runnin' this concern That's got nothin' else to learn: Ef He's willin', we'll pull throughâ Say good-by er howdy-do! WITH THE CURRENT Rarest mood of all the year! Aimless, idle, and contentâ Sky and wave and atmosphere Wholly indolent. Little daughter, loose the band From your tressesâlet them pour Shadow-like o'er arm and hand Idling at the oar. Low and clear, and pure and deep, Ripples of the river singâ Water-lilies, half asleep, Drowsed with listening: Tremulous reflex of skiesâ Skies above and skies below,â Paradise and Paradise Blending even so! Blossoms with their leaves unrolled Laughingly, as they were lips Cleft with ruddy beaten gold Tongues of pollen-tips. Rush and reed, and thorn and vine, Clumped with grasses lithe and tallâ With a web of summer-shine Woven round it all. Back and forth, and to and froâ Flashing scale and wing as one,â Dragon-flies that come and go, Shuttled by the sun. Fairy lilts and lullabies, Fine as fantasy conceives,â Echoes wrought of cricket-cries Sifted through the leaves. O'er the rose, with drowsy buzz, Hangs the bee, and stays his kiss, Even as my fancy does, Gipsy, over this. Let us both be childrenâshare Youth's glad voyage night and day, Drift adown it, half aware, Anywhere we may.â Drift and curve and deviate, Veer and eddy, float and flow, Waver, swerve and undulate, As the bubbles go. WET-WEATHER TALK It hain't no use to grumble and complane; It's jest as cheap and easy to rejoice.â When God sorts out the weather and sends rain, W'y, rain's my choice. Men ginerly, to all intentsâ Although they're apt to grumble someâ Puts most they'r trust in Providence, And takes things as they comeâ That is, the commonality Of men that's lived as long as me Has watched the world enugh to learn They're not the boss of this concern. With some, of course, it's differentâ I've saw young men that knowed it all, And didn't like the way things went On this terrestchul ball;â But all the same, the rain, some way, Rained jest as hard on picnic day; Er, when they railly wanted it, It mayby wouldn't rain a bit! In this existunce, dry and wet Will overtake the best of menâ Some little skift o' clouds'll shet The sun off now and then.â And mayby, whilse you're wundern who You've fool-like lent your umbrell' to, And want itâout'll pop the sun, And you'll be glad you hain't got none! It aggervates the farmers, tooâ They's too much wet, er too much sun, Er work, er waitin' round to do Before the plowin' 's done: And mayby, like as not, the wheat, Jest as it's lookin' hard to beat, Will ketch the stormâand jest about The time the corn's a-jintin' out. These-here cy-clones a-foolin' roundâ And back'ard crops!âand wind and rain!â And yit the corn that's wallerd down May elbow up again!â They hain't no sense, as I can see, Fer mortuls, sich as us, to be A-faultin' Natchur's wise intents, And lockin' horns with Providence! It hain't no use to grumble and complane; It's jest as cheap and easy to rejoice.â When God sorts out the weather and sends rain, W'y, rain's my choice. A POOR MAN'S WEALTH A poor man? Yes, I must confessâ No wealth of gold do I possess; No pastures fine, with grazing kine, Nor fields of waving grain are mine; No foot of fat or fallow land Where rightfully my feet may stand The while I claim it as my ownâ By deed and title, mine alone. Ah, poor indeed! perhaps you sayâ But spare me your compassion, pray!â When I ride notâwith youâI walk In Nature's company, and talk With one who will not slight or slur The child forever dear to herâ And one who answers back, be sure, With smile for smile, though I am poor. And while communing thus, I count An inner wealth of large amount,â The wealth of honest purpose blent With Penury's environment,â The wealth of owing naught to-day But debts that I would gladly pay, With wealth of thanks still unexpressed With cumulative interest.â A wealth of patience and contentâ For all my ways improvident; A faith still fondly exercisedâ For all my plans unrealized; A wealth of promises that still, Howe'er I fail, I hope to fill; A wealth of charity for those Who pity me my ragged clothes. A poor man? Yes, I must confessâ No wealth of gold do I possess; No pastures fine, with grazing kine, Nor fields of waving grain are mine; But ah, my friend! I've wealth, no end! For millionairies might condescend To bend the knee and envy me This opulence of poverty. AUTOGRAPHIC For an Album I feel, if aught I ought to rhyme, I ought 'a' thought a longer time, And ought 'a' caught a higher sense, Of autocratic eloquence. I ought 'a' sought each haughty Muse That taught a thought I ought to use, And fought and fraught, and so devised A poem unmonotonized.â But since all this was vain, I thought I ought to simply say,âI ought To thank you, as I ought to do, And ought to bow my best to you; And ought to trust not to intrude A rudely-wrought-up gratitude, But ought to smile, and ought to laugh, And ought to writeâan autograph. IN SWIMMING-TIME Clouds above, as white as wool, Drifting over skies as blue As the eyes of beautiful Children when they smile at you; Groves of maple, elm, and beech, With the sunshine sifted through Branches, mingling each with each, Dim with shade and bright with dew; Stripling trees, and poplars hoar, Hickory and sycamore, And the drowsy dogwood bowed Where the ripples laugh aloud, And the crooning creek is stirred To a gaiety that now Mates the warble of the bird Teetering on the hazel-bough; Grasses long and fine and fair As your schoolboy sweetheart's hair, Backward roached and twirled and twined By the fingers of the wind. Vines and mosses, interlinked Down dark aisles and deep ravines, Where the stream runs, willow-brinked, Round a bend where some one leans Faint and vague and indistinct As the like reflected thing In the current shimmering. Childish voices farther on, Where the truant stream has gone, Vex the echoes of the wood Till no word is understood, Save that one is well aware Happiness is hiding there. There, in leafy coverts, nude Little bodies poise and leap, Spattering the solitude And the silence everywhereâ Mimic monsters of the deep! Wallowing in sandy shoalsâ Plunging headlong out of sight; And, with spurtings of delight, Clutching hands, and slippery soles, Climbing up the treacherous steep Over which the spring-board spurns Each again as he returns. Ah! the glorious carnival! Purple lips and chattering teethâ Eyes that burnâbut, in beneath, Every care beyond recall, Every task forgotten quiteâ And again, in dreams at night, Dropping, drifting through it all! THE BEST IS GOOD ENOUGH I quarrel not with Destiny, But make the best of everythingâ The best is good enough for me. Leave Discontent alone, and she Will shut her mouth and let you sing. I quarrel not with Destiny. I take some things, or let 'em beâ Good gold has always got the ring; The best is good enough for me. Since Fate insists on secrecy, I have no arguments to bringâ I quarrel not with Destiny. The fellow that goes âhawâ for âgeeâ Will find he hasn't got full swing. The best is good enough for me. One only knows our needs, and He Does all of the distributing. I quarrel not with Destiny: The best is good enough for me. HE CALLED HER IN I He called her in from me and shut the door. And she so loved the sunshine and the sky!â She loved them even better yet than I That ne'er knew dearth of themâmy mother dead, Nature had nursed me in her lap instead: And I had grown a dark and eery child That rarely smiled, Save when, shut all alone in grasses high, Looking straight up in God's great lonesome sky And coaxing Mother to smile back on me. 'Twas lying thus, this fair girl suddenly Came on me, nestled in the fields beside A pleasant-seeming home, with doorway wideâ The sunshine beating in upon the floor Like golden rain.â O sweet, sweet face above me, turn again And leave me! I had cried, but that an ache Within my throat so gripped it I could make No sound but a thick sobbing. Cowering so, I felt her light hand laid Upon my hairâa touch that ne'er before Had tamed me thus, all soothed and unafraidâ It seemed the touch the children used to know When Christ was here, so dear it wasâso dear,â At once I loved her as the leaves love dew In midmost summer when the days are new. Barely an hour I knew her, yet a curl Of silken sunshine did she clip for me Out of the bright May-morning of her hair, And bound and gave it to me laughingly, And caught my hands and called me âLittle girl,â Tiptoeing, as she spoke, to kiss me there! And I stood dazed and dumb for very stress Of my great happiness. She plucked me by the gown, nor saw how mean The raimentâdrew me with her everywhere: Smothered her face in tufts of grasses green: Put up her dainty hands and peeped between Her fingers at the blossomsâcrooned and talked To them in strange, glad whispers, as we walked,â Said this one was her angel motherâthis, Her baby-sisterâcome back, for a kiss, Clean from the Good-World!âsmiled and kissed them, then Closed her soft eyes and kissed them o'er again. And so did she beguile meâso we played,â She was the dazzling ShineâI, the dark Shadeâ And we did mingle like to these, and thus, Together, made The perfect summer, pure and glorious. So blent we, till a harsh voice broke upon Our happiness.âShe, startled as a fawn, Cried, âOh, 'tis Father!ââall the blossoms gone From out her cheeks as those from out her grasp.â Harsher the voice came:âShe could only gasp Affrightedly, âGood-by!âgood-by! good-by!â And lo, I stood alone, with that harsh cry Ringing a new and unknown sense of shame Through soul and frame, And, with wet eyes, repeating o'er and o'er,â âHe called her in from me and shut the door!â II He called her in from me and shut the door! And I went wandering alone againâ So lonelyâO so very lonely then, I thought no little sallow star, alone In all a world of twilight, e'er had known Such utter loneliness. But that I wore Above my heart that gleaming tress of hair To lighten up the night of my despair, I think I might have groped into my grave Nor cared to wave To ferns above it with a breath of prayer. And how I hungered for the sweet, sweet face That bent above me in my hiding-place That day amid the grasses there beside Her pleasant home!ââHer pleasant home!â I sighed, Remembering;âthen shut my teeth and feigned The harsh voice calling me,âthen clenched my nails So deeply in my palms, the sharp wounds pained, And tossed my face toward Heaven, as one who pales In splendid martyrdom, with soul serene, As near to God as high the guillotine. And I had envied her? Not thatâO no! But I had longed for some sweet haven so!â Wherein the tempest-beaten heart might ride Sometimes at peaceful anchor, and abide Where those that loved me touched me with their hands, And looked upon me with glad eyes, and slipped Smooth fingers o'er my brow, and lulled the strands Of my wild tresses, as they backward tipped My yearning face and kissed it satisfied. Then bitterly I murmured as before,â âHe called her in from me and shut the door!â III He called her in from me and shut the door! After long struggling with my pride and painâ A weary while it seemed, in which the more I held myself from her, the greater fain Was I to look upon her face again;â At lastâat lastâhalf conscious where my feet Were faring, I stood waist-deep in the sweet Green grasses there where she First came to me.â The very blossoms she had plucked that day, And, at her father's voice, had cast away, Around me lay, Still bright and blooming in these eyes of mine; And as I gathered each one eagerly, I pressed it to my lips and drank the wine Her kisses left there for the honey-bee. Then, after I had laid them with the tress Of her bright hair with lingering tenderness, I, turning, crept on to the hedge that bound Her pleasant-seeming homeâbut all around Was never sign of her!âThe windows all Were blinded; and I heard no rippling fall Of her glad laugh, nor any harsh voice call;â But, clutching to the tangled grasses, caught A sound as though a strong man bowed his head And sobbed aloneâunlovedâuncomforted!â And then straightway before My tearless eyes, all vividly, was wrought A vision that is with me evermore:â A little girl that lies asleep, nor hears Nor heeds not any voice nor fall of tears.â And I sit singing o'er and o'er and o'er,â âGod called her in from him and shut the door!â GIVE ME THE BABY Give me the baby to hold, my dearâ To hold and hug, and to love and kiss. Ah! he will come to me, never a fearâ Come to the nest of a breast like this, As warm for him as his face with cheer. Give me the baby to hold, my dear! Trustfully yield him to my caress. âBother,â you say? What! âa botherâ to me?â To fill up my soul with such happiness As the love of a baby that laughs to be Snuggled away where my heart can hear! Give me the baby to hold, my dear! Ah, but his hands are grimed, you say, And would soil my laces and clutch my hair.â Well, what would pleasure me more, I pray, Than the touch and tug of the wee hands there?â The wee hands there, and the warm face hereâ Give me the baby to hold, my dear! Give me the baby! (Oh, won't you see? ... Somewhere, out where the green of the lawn Is turning to gray, and the maple tree Is weeping its leaves of gold upon A little mound, with a dead rose near. ...) Give me the baby to hold, my dear! AN AUTUMNAL TONIC What mystery is it? The morning as rare As the Indian Summer may bring! A tang in the frost and a spice in the air That no city poet can sing! The crimson and amber and gold of the leaves, As they loosen and flutter and fall In the path of the park, as it rustlingly weaves Its way through the maples and under the eaves Of the sparrows that chatter and call. What hint of delight is it tingles me through?â What vague, indefinable joy? What yearning for something divine that I knew When a wayward and wood-roving boy? Ah-ha! and Oho! but I have it, I sayâ Oh, the mystery brightens at last,â 'Tis the longing and zest of the far, far away, For a bountiful, old-fashioned dinner to-day, With the hale harvest-hands of the past. OUT OF THE HITHERWHERE Out of the hitherwhere into the YONâ The land that the Lord's love rests upon; Where one may rely on the friends he meets, And the smiles that greet him along the streets: Where the mother that left you years ago Will lift the hands that were folded so, And put them about you, with all the love And tenderness you are dreaming of. Out of the hitherwhere into the YONâ Where all of the friends of your youth have gone,â Where the old schoolmate that laughed with you, Will laugh again as he used to do, Running to meet you, with such a face As lights like a moon the wondrous place Where God is living, and glad to live, Since He is the Master and may forgive. Out of the hitherwhere into the YON!â Stay the hopes we are leaning onâ You, Divine, with Your merciful eyes Looking down from the far-away skies,â Smile upon us, and reach and take Our worn souls Home for the old home's sake.â And so Amen,âfor our all seems gone Out of the hitherwhere into the YON. A TINKLE OF BELLS The light of the moon on the white of the snow, And the answering twinkles along the street, And our sleigh flashing by, in the glamour and glow Of the glorious nights of the long ago, When the laugh of her lips rang clear and sweet As the tinkle our horses shook out of the bells And flung and tossed back On our glittering track In a shower of tremulous, murmuring swells Of the echoing, airy, melodious bells!â O the mirth of the bells! And the worth of the bells! Come tinkle again, in this dearth of the bells, The laughter and love that I lack, yearning back For the far-away sound of the bells! Ah! the bells, they were glad in the long ago! And the tinkles they had, they have thrilled me so I have said: âIt is they and her songs and face Make summer for me of the wintriest place!â And nowâbut sobbings and sad farewells, As I peer in the night through the sleeted pane, Hearing a clangor and wrangle of bells, And never a tinkle again! The snow is a-swoon, and the moon dead-white, And the frost is wild in the air to-night! Yet still will I linger and listen and pray Till the sound of her voice shall come this way, With a tinkle of bells, And the lisp-like tread Of the hooves of the sleigh, And the murmurs and swells Of the vows she said. And oh, I shall listen as madmen may, Till the tinkling bells ring down this way!â Till again the grasp of my hand entwines The tensioned loops of the quivering lines, And again we ride in the wake of the pride And the strength of the coursers, side by side, With our faces smitten again by the spray Of the froth of our steeds as we gallop away In affright of the bells, And the might of the bells, And the infinite glee and delight of the bells, As they tinkle and tinkle and tinkle, till they Are heard through the dawn where the mists are drawn, And we canter and gallop and dash away Sheer into The Judgment Day! THE OLD MAN Lo! steadfast and serene, In patient pause between The seen and the unseen, What gentle zephyrs fan Your silken silver hair,â And what diviner air Breathes round you like a prayer, Old Man? Can you, in nearer view Of Glory, pierce the blue Of happy Heaven through; And, listening mutely, can Your senses, dull to us, Hear Angel-voices thus, In chorus gloriousâ Old Man? In your reposeful gaze The dusk of Autumn days Is blent with April haze, As when of old began The bursting of the bud Of rosy babyhoodâ When all the world was good, Old Man. And yet I find a sly Little twinkle in your eye; And your whisperingly shy Little laugh is simply an Internal shout of glee That betrays the fallacy You'd perpetrate on me, Old Man! So just put up the frown That your brows are pulling down! Why, the fleetest boy in town, As he bared his feet and ran, Could read with half a glanceâ And of keen rebuke, perchanceâ Your secret countenance, Old Man! Now, honestly, confess: Is an old man any less Than the little child we bless And caress when we can? Isn't age but just a place Where you mask the childish face To preserve its inner grace, Old Man? Hasn't age a truant day, Just as that you went astray In the wayward, restless way, When, brown with dust and tan, Your roguish face essayed, In solemn masquerade, To hide the smile it made, Old Man? Now, fair, and square, and true, Don't your old soul tremble through, As in youth it used to do When it brimmed and overran With the strange, enchanted sights, And the splendors and delights Of the old âArabian Nights,â Old Man? When, haply, you have fared Where glad Aladdin shared His lamp with you, and dared The Afrite and his clan; And, with him, clambered through The trees where jewels grewâ And filled your pockets, too, Old Man? Or, with Sinbad, at seaâ And in veracity Who has sinned as bad as he, Or would, or will, or can?â Have you listened to his lies, With open mouth and eyes, And learned his art likewise, Old Man? And you need not deny That your eyes were wet as dry, Reading novels on the sly! And review them, if you can And the same warm tears will fallâ Only faster, that is allâ Over Little Nell and Paul, Old Man! Oh, you were a lucky ladâ Just as good as you were bad! And the host of friends you hadâ Charley, Tom, and Dick, and Dan; And the old School-Teacher, too, Though he often censured you; And the girls in pink and blue, Old Man. Andâas often you have leant, In boyish sentiment, To kiss the letter sent By Nelly, Belle, or Nanâ Wherein the rose's hue Was red, the violet blueâ And sugar sweetâand you, Old Man,â So, to-day, as lives the bloom, And the sweetness, and perfume Of the blossoms, I assume, On the same mysterious plan The Master's love assures, That the selfsame boy endures In that hale old heart of yours, Old Man. OUR KIND OF A MAN I The kind of a man for you and me! He faces the world unflinchingly, And smites, as long as the wrong resists, With a knuckled faith and force like fists: He lives the life he is preaching of, And loves where most is the need of love; His voice is clear to the deaf man's ears, And his face sublime through the blind man's tears; The light shines out where the clouds were dim, And the widow's prayer goes up for him; The latch is clicked at the hovel door And the sick man sees the sun once more, And out o'er the barren fields he sees Springing blossoms and waving trees, Feeling as only the dying may, That God's own servant has come that way, Smoothing the path as it still winds on Through the golden gate where his loved have gone. II The kind of a man for me and you! However little of worth we do He credits full, and abides in trust That time will teach us how more is just. He walks abroad, and he meets all kinds Of querulous and uneasy minds, And, sympathizing, he shares the pain Of the doubts that rack us, heart and brain; And, knowing this, as we grasp his hand, We are surely coming to understand! He looks on sin with pitying eyesâ E'en as the Lord, since Paradise,â Else, should we read, Though our sins should glow As scarlet, they shall be white as snow?â And, feeling still, with a grief half glad, That the bad are as good as the good are bad, He strikes straight out for the Rightâand he Is the kind of a man for you and me! THE LITTLE COAT Here's his ragged âroundabout.â Turn the pockets inside out: See; his penknife, lost to use, Rusted shut with apple-juice; Here, with marbles, top and string, Is his deadly âdevil-sling,â With its rubber, limp at last As the sparrows of the past! Beeswaxâbucklesâleather strapsâ Bullets, and a box of caps,â Not a thing of all, I guess, But betrays some waywardnessâ E'en these tickets, blue and red, For the Bible-verses saidâ Such as this his mem'ry kept,â âJesus wept.â Here's a fishing-hook and -line, Tangled up with wire and twine, And dead angleworms, and some Slugs of lead and chewing-gum, Blent with scents that can but come From the oil of rhodium. Hereâa soiled, yet dainty note, That some little sweetheart wrote, DottingââVine grows round the stump,â AndââMy sweetest sugar-lump!â Wrapped in thisâa padlock key Where he's filed a touch-holeâsee! And some powder in a quill Corked up with a liver pill; And a spongy little chunk Of âpunk.â Here's the little coatâbut O Where is he we've censured so? Don't you hear us calling, dear? Back! come back, and never fear.â You may wander where you will, Over orchard, field and hill; You may kill the birds, or do Anything that pleases you! Ah, this empty coat of his! Every tatter worth a kiss; Every stain as pure instead As the white stars overhead: And the pocketsâhomes were they Of the little hands that play Now no moreâbut, absent, thus Beckon us. AN IMPROMPTU ON ROLLER SKATES Rumble, tumble, growl and grate! Skip, and trip, and gravitate! Lunge, and plunge, and thrash the planks With your blameless, shameless shanks: In excruciating pain, Stand upon your head again, And, uncoiling kink by kink, Kick the roof out of the rink! In derisive bursts of mirth, Drop ka-whop and jar the earth! Jolt your lungs down in your socks, Oh! tempestuous equinox Of dismembered legs and arms! Strew your ways with wild alarms; Fameward skoot and ricochet On your glittering vertebrae! ME AND MARY All my feelin's in the Spring Gits so blame contrary, I can't think of anything Only me and Mary! âMe and Mary!â all the time, âMe and Mary!â like a rhyme, Keeps a-dingin' on till I'm Sick o' âMe and Mary!â âMe and Mary! Ef us two Only was togetherâ Playin' like we used to do In the Aprile weather!â All the night and all the day I keep wishin' thataway Till I'm gittin' old and gray Jes' on âMe and Mary!â Muddy yit along the pike Sence the Winter's freezin', And the orchard's back'ard-like Bloomin' out this season; Only heerd one bluebird yitâ Nary robin ner tomtit; What's the how and why of it? 'Spect it's âMe and Mary!â Me and Mary liked the birdsâ That is, Mary sort o' Liked 'em first, and afterwards, W'y, I thought I'd ort 'o. And them birdsâef Mary stood Right here with me, like she shouldâ They'd be singin', them birds would, All fer me and Mary. Birds er not, I'm hopin' some I can git to plowin'! Ef the sun'll only come, And the Lord allowin', Guess to-morry I'll turn in And git down to work ag'in; This here loaferin' won't win, Not fer me and Mary! Fer a man that loves, like me, And's afeard to name it, Till some other feller, he Gits the girlâdad-shame-it! Wet er dry, er cloud er sunâ Winter gone er jes' begunâ Outdoor work fer me er none, No more âMe and Mary!â WRITTEN IN BUNNER'S âAIRS FROM ARCADYâ O ever gracious Airs from Arcady! What lack is there of any jocund thing In glancing wit or glad imagining Capricious fancy may not find in thee?â The laugh of Momus, tempered daintily To lull the ear and lure its listening; The whistled syllables the birds of spring Flaunt ever at our guessings what they be; The wood, the seashore, and the clanging town; The pets of fashion, and the ways of such; The robe de chambre, and the russet gown; The lordling's carriage, and the pilgrim's crutchâ From hale old Chaucer's wholesomeness, clean down To our artistic Dobson's deftest touch! A SONG There is ever a song somewhere, my dear; There is ever a something sings alway: There's the song of the lark when the skies are clear, And the song of the thrush when the skies are gray. The sunshine showers across the grain, And the bluebird trills in the orchard tree; And in and out, when the eaves drip rain, The swallows are twittering ceaselessly. There is ever a song somewhere, my dear, Be the skies above or dark or fair, There is ever a song that our hearts may hearâ There is ever a song somewhere, my dearâ There is ever a song somewhere! There is ever a song somewhere, my dear, In the midnight black, or the midday blue: The robin pipes when the sun is here, And the cricket chirrups the whole night through. The buds may blow, and the fruit may grow, And the autumn leaves drop crisp and sear; But whether the sun, or the rain, or the snow, There is ever a song somewhere, my dear. There is ever a song somewhere, my dear, Be the skies above or dark or fair, There is ever a song that our hearts may hearâ There is ever a song somewhere, my dearâ There is ever a song somewhere! NEVER TALK BACK Never talk back! sich things is repperhensible; A feller only hurts hisse'f that jaws a man that's hot; In a quarrel, ef you'll only keep your mouth shet and act sensible, The man that does the talkin' 'll git worsted every shot! Never talk back to a feller that's abusin' youâ Jes' let him carry on, and rip, and snort, and swear; And when he finds his blamin' and defamin' 's jes' amusin' you, You've got him clean kaflummixed,âand you want to hold him there! Never talk back, and wake up the whole community And call a man a liar, over Law, er Politics.â You can lift and land him furder and with gracefuller impunity With one good jolt of silence than a half a dozen kicks! MY FRIEND âHe is my friend,â I said,â âBe patient!â Overhead The skies were drear and dim; And lo! the thought of him Smiled on my heartâand then The sun shone out again! âHe is my friend!â The words Brought summer and the birds; And all my winter-time Thawed into running rhyme And rippled into song, Warm, tender, brave, and strong. And so it sings to-day.â So may it sing alway! Though waving grasses grow Between, and lilies blow Their trills of perfume clear As laughter to the ear, Let each mute measure end With âStill he is thy friend.â THE LITTLE FAT DOCTOR He seemed so strange to me, every wayâ In manner, and form, and size, From the boy I knew but yesterday,â I could hardly believe my eyes! To hear his name called over there, My memory thrilled with glee And leaped to picture him young and fair In youth, as he used to be. But looking, only as glad eyes can, For the boy I knew of yore, I smiled on a portly little man I had never seen before!â Grave as a judge in courtlinessâ Professor-like and blandâ A little fat doctor and nothing less, With his hat in his kimboed hand. But how we talked old times, and âchaffedâ Each other with âMinnie,â and âJimââ And how the little fat doctor laughed, And how I laughed with him! âAnd it's pleasant,â I thought, âthough I yearn to see The face of the youth that was, To know no boy could smile on me As the little fat doctor does!â THE STRANGE YOUNG MAN 'T was a strange young man of the dreamy times When bards made money, and bankers rhymes; And drones made honeyâand bees made naught; And the bad sung hymns, and the good-folk fought; And the merchants lurked in the shade all day And pitched horseshoes in a listless way! When the ticket-man at the station knew If your trunk would go if you checked it through, And if 2:30 meant half-past two, And what in-the-name-of-the-land to do If a man got left when he oughtn't to: When the cabman wept as he took your fare, And the street-car driver led in prayerâ And the cuss with the dyed mustache was there That rode in town on a âjumperâ-sled, And got whipped twice for the things he said To fellows that told him his hair was red. And the strange young man (of which and whom Our pencil offers to deign presume To treat of now, in the days like these When young men dress as they please to please) Went round in a coat of pale pink-blue, And a snow-white vest of a crimson hue, And trousers purple, and gaiters grayâ All cut, as the French or the Dutch would say,â Laâmacht nichts aus, oderâdÃ©colletÃ©,â Strange not only in dress, but in The dimples he wore in cheek and chinâ All nailed over with scraps of tin, Where he hadn't been shaved as he'd ought o' been;â And his crape cravat, and the shape of that, And the ear-tab over his diamond-pin. And his friends all wondered, and used to say,â âWhat a strange young man! Ah me! Hooray! How sad he seems in his wild delight! And how tickled indeed when he weeps outright! What a comical man when he writhes in pain; And how grieved he grows when he's glad again!â And marveling still to remark new facts, They said, âHow slender and slim he acts! And isn't it odd for a man to wear A thumb-stall over his nose, and pare His finger-nails with a carving-knife, And talk of prunes to the landlord's wife? It is patent to usâand, indeed, no doubt, Though as safely sealed as an oyster-can,â Our interest in him must needs leak out,â Namely, that he is a strange young man!â SCOTTY Scotty's dead.âOf course he is! Jes' that same old luck of his!â Ever sence we went cahoots He's be'n first, you bet yer boots! When our schoolin' first begun, Got two whippin's to my one: Stold and smoked the first cigar: Stood up first before the bar, Takin' whisky-straightâand me Wastin' time on âblackberryâ! Beat me in the Army, too, And clean on the whole way through!â In more scrapes around the camp, And more troubles, on the tramp: Fought and fell there by my side With more bullets in his hide, And more glory in the cause,â That's the kind o' man he was! Luck liked Scotty more'n me.â I got married: Scotty, he Never even would apply Fer the pension-money I Had to beg of âUncle Samââ That's the kind o' cuss I am!â Scotty allus first and bestâ Me the last and ornriest! Yit fer all that's said and doneâ All the battles fought and wonâ We hain't prospered, him ner meâ Both as pore as pore could be,â Though we've allus, up tel now, Stuck together anyhowâ Scotty allus, as I've said, LuckiestâAnd now he's dead! ON THE SUNNY SIDE Hi and whoop-hooray, boys! Sing a song of cheer! Here's a holiday, boys, Lasting half a year! Round the world, and half is Shadow we have tried; Now we're where the laugh is,â On the sunny side! Pigeons coo and mutter, Strutting high aloof Where the sunbeams flutter Through the stable roof. Hear the chickens cheep, boys, And the hen with pride Clucking them to sleep, boys, On the sunny side! Hear the clacking guinea; Hear the cattle moo; Hear the horses whinny, Looking out at you! On the hitching-block, boys, Grandly satisfied, See the old peacock, boys, On the sunny side! Robins in the peach tree; Bluebirds in the pear; Blossoms over each tree In the orchard there! All the world's in joy, boys, Glad and glorified As a romping boy, boys, On the sunny side! Where's a heart as mellowâ Where's a soul as freeâ Where is any fellow We would rather be? Just ourselves or none, boys, World around and wide, Laughing in the sun, boys, On the sunny side! THE HARPER Like a drift of faded blossoms Caught in a slanting rain, His fingers glimpsed down the strings of his harp In a tremulous refrain: Patter and tinkle, and drip and drip! Ah! but the chords were rainy sweet! And I closed my eyes and I bit my lip, As he played there in the street. Patter, and drip, and tinkle! And there was the little bed In the corner of the garret, And the rafters overhead! And there was the little windowâ Tinkle, and drip, and drip!â The rain above, and a mother's love, And God's companionship! THE BLOSSOMS ON THE TREES Blossoms crimson, white, or blue, Purple, pink, and every hue, From sunny skies, to tintings drowned In dusky drops of dew, I praise you all, wherever found, And love you through and through;â But, Blossoms on the Trees, With your breath upon the breeze, There's nothing all the world around As half as sweet as you! Could the rhymder only wring All the sweetness to the lees Of all the kisses clustering In juicy Used-to-bes, To dip his rhymes therein and sing The blossoms on the trees,â âO Blossoms on the Trees,â He would twitter, trill, and coo, âHowever sweet, such songs as these Are not as sweet as you:â For you are blooming melodies The eyes may listen to!â LAUGHTER HOLDING BOTH HIS SIDES Ay, thou varlet! Laugh away! All the world's a holiday! Laugh away, and roar and shout Till thy hoarse tongue lolleth out! Bloat thy cheeks, and bulge thine eyes Unto bursting; pelt thy thighs With thy swollen palms, and roar As thou never hast before! Lustier! wilt thou! peal on peal! Stiflest? Squat and grind thy heelâ Wrestle with thy loins, and then Wheeze thee whiles, and whoop again! IN STATE Is it the martins or katydids?â Early morning or late at night? A dream, belike, kneeling down on the lids Of a dying man's eyesight. Over and over I heard the rainâ Over and over I waked to see The blaze of the lamp as again and again Its stare insulted me. It is not the click of the clock I hearâ It is the pulse of the clock,âand lo! How it throbs and throbs on the quickened ear Of the dead man listening so! I heard them whisper âShe would not come;â But, being dead, I knewâI knew! ... Some hearts they love us alive, and some They love us deadâthey do! And I am deadâand I joy to be,â For here are my folded hands, so cold, And yet blood-warm with the roses she Has given me to hold. Deadâyea, dead!âBut I hear the beat Of her heart, as her warm lips touch my browâ And O how sweetâhow blinding sweet To know that she loves me now! THE DEAD LOVER Time is so long when a man is dead! Some one sews; and the room is made Very clean; and the light is shed Soft through the window-shade. Yesterday I thought: âI know Just how the bells will sound, and how The friends will talk, and the sermon go, And the hearse-horse bow and bow!â This is to-day; and I have no thing To think ofânothing whatever to do But to hear the throb of the pulse of a wing That wants to fly back to you. THE KIND OLD MAN The kind old manâthe mild old manâ Who smiled on the boys at play, Dreaming, perchance, of his own glad youth When he was as blithe and gay! And the larger urchin tossed the ball, And the lesser held the batâ Though the kindly old man's eyes were blurred He could even notice that! But suddenly he was shocked to hear Words that I dare not write, And he hastened, in his kindly way, To curb them as he might! And he said, âTut! tut! you naughty boy With the ball! for shame!â and then, âYou boy with the bat, whack him over the head If he calls you that again!â The kind old manâthe mild old manâ Who gazed on the boys at play, Dreaming, perchance, of his own wild youth When he was as tough as they! A SCRAWL I want to sing somethingâbut this is allâ I try and I try, but the rhymes are dull As though they were damp, and the echoes fall Limp and unlovable. Words will not say what I yearn to sayâ They will not walk as I want them to, But they stumble and fall in the path of the way Of my telling my love for you. Simply take what the scrawl is worthâ Knowing I love you as sun the sod On the ripening side of the great round earth That swings in the smile of God. AWAY I can not say, and I will not say That he is dead.âHe is just way! With a cheery smile, and a wave of the hand, He has wandered into an unknown land, And left us dreaming how very fair It needs must be, since he lingers there. And youâO you, who the wildest yearn For the old-time step and the glad return,â Think of him faring on, as dear In the love of There as the love of Here; And loyal still, as he gave the blows Of his warrior-strength to his country's foes.â Mild and gentle, as he was brave,â When the sweetest love of his life he gave To simple things:âwhere the violets grew Blues as the eyes they were likened to, The touches of his hands have strayed As reverently as his lips have prayed: When the little brown thrush that harshly chirred Was dear to him as the mocking-bird; And he pitied as much as a man in pain A writhing honey-bee wet with rain.â Think of him still as the same, I say: He is not deadâhe is just away! A MONUMENT FOR THE SOLDIERS A monument for the Soldiers! And what will ye build it of? Can ye build it of marble, or brass, or bronze, Outlasting the Soldiers' love? Can ye glorify it with legends As grand as their blood hath writ From the inmost shrine of this land of thine To the outermost verge of it? And the answer came: We would build it Out of our hopes made sure, And out of our purest prayers and tears, And out of our faith secure: We would build it out of the great white truths Their death hath sanctified, And the sculptured forms of the men in arms, And their faces ere they died. And what heroic figures Can the sculptor carve in stone? Can the marble breast be made to bleed, And the marble lips to moan? Can the marble brow be fevered? And the marble eyes be graved To look their last, as the flag floats past, On the country they have saved? And the answer came: The figures Shall all be fair and brave, And, as befitting, as pure and white As the stars above their grave! The marble lips, and breast and brow Whereon the laurel lies, Bequeath us right to guard the flight Of the old flag in the skies! A monument for the Soldiers! Built of a people's love, And blazoned and decked and panoplied With the hearts ye build it of! And see that ye build it stately, In pillar and niche and gate, And high in pose as the souls of those It would commemorate! OUT TO OLD AUNT MARY'S Wasn't it pleasant, O brother mine, In those old days of the lost sunshine Of youthâwhen the Saturday's chores were through, And the âSunday's woodâ in the kitchen, too, And we went visiting, âme and you,â Out to Old Aunt Mary's?â âMe and youââAnd the morning fair, With the dewdrops twinkling everywhere; The scent of the cherry-blossoms blown After us, in the roadway lone, Our capering shadows onward thrownâ Out to Old Aunt Mary's! It all come back so clear to-day! Though I am as bald as you are gray,â Out by the barn-lot and down the lane We patter along in the dust again, As light as the tips of the drops of the rain, Out to Old Aunt Mary's. The few last houses of the town; Then on, up the high creek-bluffs and down; Past the squat toll-gate, with its well-sweep pole; The bridge, and âthe old âbabtizin'-hole,ââ Loitering, awed, o'er pool and shoal, Out to Old Aunt Mary's. We cross the pasture, and through the wood, Where the old gray snag of the poplar stood, Where the hammering âred-headsâ hopped awry, And the buzzard âraisedâ in the âclearingâ-sky And lolled and circled, as we went by Out to Old Aunt Mary's. Or, stayed by the glint of the redbird's wings, Or the glitter of song that the bluebird sings, All hushed we feign to strike strange trails, As the âbig bravesâ do in the Indian tales, Till again our real quest lags and failsâ Out to Old Aunt Mary's.â And the woodland echoes with yells of mirth That make old war-whoops of minor worth! ... Where such heroes of war as we?â With bows and arrows of fantasy, Chasing each other from tree to tree Out to Old Aunt Mary's! And then in the dust of the road again; And the teams we met, and the countrymen; And the long highway, with sunshine spread As thick as butter on country bread, Our cares behind, and our hearts ahead Out to Old Aunt Mary's.â For only, now, at the road's next bend To the right we could make out the gable-end Of the fine old Huston homesteadânot Half a mile from the sacred spot Where dwelt our Saint in her simple cotâ Out to Old Aunt Mary's. Why, I see her now in the open door Where the little gourds grew up the sides and o'er The clapboard roof!âAnd her faceâah, me! Wasn't it good for a boy to seeâ And wasn't it good for a boy to be Out to Old aunt Mary's?â The jellyâthe jam and the marmalade, And the cherry and quince âpreservesâ she made! And the sweet-sour pickles of peach and pear, With cinnamon in 'em, and all things rare!â And the more we ate was the more to spare, Out to Old Aunt Mary's! Ah! was there, ever, so kind a face And gentle as hers, or such a grace Of welcoming, as she cut the cake Or the juicy pies that she joyed to make Just for the visiting children's sakeâ Out to Old Aunt Mary's! The honey, too, in its amber comb One only finds in an old farm-home; And the coffee, fragrant and sweet, and ho! So hot that we gloried to drink it so, With spangles of tears in our eyes, you knowâ Out to Old Aunt Mary's. And the romps we took, in our glad unrest!â Was it the lawn that we loved the best, With its swooping swing in the locust trees, Or was it the grove, with its leafy breeze, Or the dim haymow, with its fragranciesâ Out to Old Aunt Mary's. Far fields, bottom-lands, creek-banksâall, We ranged at will.âWhere the waterfall Laughed all day as it slowly poured Over the dam by the old mill-ford, While the tail-race writhed, and the mill-wheel roaredâ Out to Old Aunt Mary's. But home, with Aunty in nearer call, That was the best place, after all!â The talks on the back porch, in the low Slanting sun and the evening glow, With the voice of counsel that touched us so, Out to Old Aunt Mary's. And then, in the gardenânear the side Where the beehives were and the path was wide,â The apple-houseâlike a fairy cellâ With the little square door we knew so well, And the wealth inside but our tongues could tellâ Out to Old Aunt Mary's. And the old spring-house, in the cool green gloom Of the willow trees,âand the cooler room Where the swinging shelves and the crocks were kept, Where the cream in a golden languor slept, While the waters gurgled and laughed and weptâ Out to Old Aunt Mary's. And as many a time have you and Iâ Barefoot boys in the days gone byâ Knelt, and in tremulous ecstasies Dipped our lips into sweets like these,â Memory now is on her knees Out to Old Aunt Mary's.â For, O my brother so far away, This is to tell youâshe waits to-day To welcome us:âAunt Mary fell Asleep this morning, whispering, âTell The boys to come.â ... And all is well Out to Old Aunt Mary's. IN THE AFTERNOON You in the hammock; and I, near by, Was trying to read, and to swing you, too; And the green of the sward was so kind to the eye, And the shade of the maples so cool and blue, That often I looked from the book to you To say as much, with a sigh. You in the hammock. The book we'd brought From the parlorâto read in the open air,â Something of love and of Launcelot And Guinevere, I believe, was thereâ But the afternoon, it was far more fair Than the poem was, I thought. You in the hammock; and on and on I droned and droned through the rhythmic stuffâ But, with always a half of my vision gone Over the top of the pageâenough To caressingly gaze at you, swathed in the fluff Of your hair and your odorous âlawn.â You in the hammockâand that was a yearâ Fully a year ago, I guessâ And what do we care for their Guinevere And her Launcelot and their lordliness!â You in the hammock still, andâYesâ Kiss me again, my dear! UNINTERPRETED Supinely we lie in the grove's shady greenery, Gazing, all dreamy-eyed, up through the trees,â And as to the sight is the heavenly scenery, So to the hearing the sigh of the breeze. We catch but vague rifts of the blue through the wavering Boughs of the maples; and, like undefined, The whispers and lisps of the leaves, faint and quavering, Meaningless falter and fall on the mind. The vine, with its beauty of blossom, goes rioting Up by the casement, as sweet to the eye As the trill of the robin is restful and quieting Heard in a drowse with the dawn in the sky. And yet we yearn on to learn more of the mysteryâ We see and we hear, but forever remain Mute, blind and deaf to the ultimate history Born of a rose or a patter of rain. BILLY'S ALPHABETICAL ANIMAL SHOW A was an elegant Ape Who tied up his ears with red tape, And wore a long veil Half revealing his tail Which was trimmed with jet bugles and crape. B was a boastful old Bear Who used to say,ââHoomh! I declare I can eatâif you'll get me The children, and let meâ Ten babies, teeth, toe-nails and hair!â C was a Codfish who sighed When snatched from the home of his pride, But could he, embrined, Guess this fragrance behind, How glad he would be to have died! D was a dandified Dog Who said,ââThough it's raining like fog I wear no umbrellah, Me boy, for a fellah Might just as well travel incog!â E was an elderly Eel Who would say,ââWell, I really feelâ As my grandchildren wriggle And shout âI should giggleââ A trifle run down at the heel!â F was a Fowl who conceded Some hens might hatch more eggs than she did,â But she'd children as plenty As eighteen or twenty, And that was quite all that she needed. G was a gluttonous Goat Who, dining one day, table d'hÃ´te, Ordered soup-bone, au fait, And fish, papier-mÃ¢chÃ©, And a filet of Spring overcoat. H was a high-cultured Hound Who could clear forty feet at a bound, And a coon once averred That his howl could be heard For five miles and three-quarters around. I was an Ibex ambitious To dive over chasms auspicious; He would leap down a peak And not light for a week, And swear that the jump was delicious. J was a Jackass who said He had such a bad cold in his head, If it wasn't for leaving The rest of us grieving, He'd really rather be dead. K was a profligate Kite Who would haunt the saloons every night; And often he ust To reel back to his roost Too full to set up on it right. L was a wary old Lynx Who would say,ââDo you know wot I thinks?â I thinks ef you happen To ketch me a-nappin' I'm ready to set up the drinks!â M was a merry old Mole, Who would snooze all day in his hole, Thenâall night, a-rootin' Around and galootin'â He'd sing âJohnny, Fill up the Bowl!â N was a caustical Nautilus Who sneered, âI suppose, when they've caught all us, Like oysters they'll serve us, And can us, preserve us, And barrel, and pickle, and bottle us!â O was an autocrat Owlâ Such a wiseâsuch a wonderful fowl! Why, for all the night through He would hoot and hoo-hoo, And hoot and hoo-hooter and howl! P was a Pelican pet, Who gobbled up all he could get; He could eat on until He was full to the bill, And there he had lodgings to let! Q was a querulous Quail, Who said: âIt will little avail The efforts of those Of my foes who propose To attempt to put salt on my tail!â R was a ring-tailed Raccoon, With eyes of the tinge of the moon, And his nose a blue-black, And the fur on his back A sad sort of sallow maroon. S is a Sculpinâyou'll wish Very much to have one on your dish, Since all his bones grow On the outside, and so He's a very desirable fish. T was a Turtle, of wealth, Who went round with particular stealth, âWhy,â said he, âI'm afraid Of being waylaid When I even walk out for my health!â U was a Unicorn curious, With one horn, of a growth so luxurious, He could level and stab itâ If you didn't grab itâ Clean through you, he was so blamed furious! V was a vagabond Vulture Who said: âI don't want to insult yer, But when you intrude Where in lone solitude I'm a-preyin', you're no man o' culture!â W was a wild Woodchuck, And you just bet that he could âchuckââ He'd eat raw potatoes, Green corn, and tomatoes, And tree roots, and call it all âgood chuck!â X was a kind of X-cuse Of some-sort-o'-thing that got loose Before we could name it, And cage it, and tame it, And bring it in general use. Y is a Yellowbird,âbright As a petrified lump of starlight, Or a handful of lightning- Bugs, squeezed in the tight'ning Pink fist of a boy, at night. Z is the Zebra, of course!â A kind of a clown-of-a-horse,â Each other despising, Yet neither devising A way to obtain a divorce! &amp; here is the famousâwhat-is-it? Walk up, Master Billy, and quiz it: You've seen the rest of 'emâ Ain't this the best of 'em, Right at the end of your visit? THE PIXY PEOPLE It was just a very Merry fairy dream!â All the woods were airy With the gloom and gleam; Crickets in the clover Clattered clear and strong, And the bees droned over Their old honey-song! In the mossy passes, Saucy grasshoppers Leaped about the grasses And the thistle-burs; And the whispered chuckle Of the katydid Shook the honeysuckle- Blossoms where he hid. Through the breezy mazes Of the lazy June, Drowsy with the hazes Of the dreamy noon, Little Pixy people Winged above the walk, Pouring from the steeple Of a mullein-stalk. Oneâa gallant fellowâ Evidently King,â Wore a plume of yellow In a jeweled ring On a pansy bonnet, Gold and white and blue, With the dew still on it, And the fragrance, too. Oneâa dainty lady,â Evidently Queenâ Wore a gown of shady Moonshine and green, With a lace of gleaming Starlight that sent All the dewdrops dreaming Everywhere she went. One wore a waistcoat Of rose-leaves, out and in; And one wore a faced-coat Of tiger-lily-skin; And one wore a neat coat Of palest galingale; And one a tiny street-coat, And one a swallow-tail. And Ho! sang the King of them, And Hey! sang the Queen; And round and round the ring of them Went dancing o'er the green; And Hey! sang the Queen of them, And Ho! sang the Kingâ And all that I had seen of them âWasn't anything! It was just a very Merry fairy dream!â All the woods were airy With the gloom and gleam; Crickets in the clover Clattered clear and strong, And the bees droned over Their old honey-song! THE TOWN KARNTEEL The town Karnteel!âIt's who'll reveal Its praises jushtifiable? For who can sing av anything So lovely and reliable? Whin Summer, Spring, or Winter lies From Malin's Head to Tipperary, There's no such town for interprise Bechuxt Youghal and Londonderry! There's no its likes in Irelandâ For twic't the week, be-gorries! They're playing jigs upon the band, And joomping there in sacksâandâandâ And racing, wid wheelborries! Karnteelâit's there, like any fair, The purty gurrls is plinty, sure!â And, man-alive! at forty-five The legs av me air twinty, sure! I lave me cares, and hoein', too, Behint me, as is sinsible, And it's Karnteel I'm goin' to, To cilebrate in principle! For there's the town av all the land! And twic't the week, be-gorries! They're playing jigs upon the band, And joomping there in sacksâandâandâ And racing, wid wheelborries! And whilst I feel for owld Karnteel That I've no phrases glorious, It stands above the need av love That boasts in voice uproarious!â Lave that for Cork, and Dublin, too, And Armagh and Killarney, thin,â And Karnteel won't be troublin' you Wid any jilous blarney, thin! For there's the town av all the land! Where twic't the week, be-gorries! They're playing jigs upon the band, And joomping there in sacksâandâandâ And racing, wid wheelborries! DONN PIATT OF MAC-O-CHEE I Donn piattâof Mac-o-chee,â Not the one of History, Who, with flaming tongue and pen, Scathes the vanities of men; Not the one whose biting wit Cuts pretense and etches it On the brazen brow that dares Filch the laurel that it wears: Not the Donn Piatt whose praise Echoes in the noisy ways Of the faction, onward led By the statesman!âBut, instead, Give the simple man to me,â Donn Piatt of Mac-o-chee! II Donn Piatt of Mac-o-chee! Branches of the old oak tree, Drape him royally in fine Purple shade and golden shine! Emerald plush of sloping lawn Be the throne he sits upon! And, O Summer Sunset, thou Be his crown, and gild a brow Softly smoothed and soothed and calmed By the breezes, mellow-palmed As Erata's white hand agleam On the forehead of a dream.â So forever rule o'er me, Donn Piatt of Mac-o-chee! III Donn Piatt of Mac-o-chee! Through a lilied memory Plays the wayward little creek Round thy home at hide-and-seekâ As I see and hear it, still Romping round the wooded hill, Till its laugh and babble blends With the silence while it sends Glances back to kiss the sight, In its babyish delight, Ere it strays amid the gloom Of the glens that burst in bloom Of the rarest rhyme for thee, Donn Piatt of Mac-o-chee! IV Donn Piatt of Mac-o-chee! What a darling destiny Has been mineâto meet him thereâ Lolling in an easy chair On the terrace, while he told Reminiscences of oldâ Letting my cigar die out, Hearing poems talked about; And entranced to hear him say Gentle things of Thackeray, Dickens, Hawthorne, and the rest, Known to him as host and guestâ Known to him as he to meâ Donn Piatt of Mac-o-chee! HERR WEISER Herr weiser!âThreescore years and ten,â A hale white rose of his countrymen, Transplanted here in the Hoosier loam, And blossomy as his German homeâ As blossomy and as pure and sweet As the cool green glen of his calm retreat, Far withdrawn from the noisy town Where trade goes clamoring up and down, Whose fret and fever, and stress and strife, May not trouble his tranquil life! Breath of rest, what a balmy gust!â Quit of the city's heat and dust, Jostling down by the winding road, Through the orchard ways of his quaint abode.â Tether the horse, as we onward fare Under the pear trees trailing there, And thumping the wooden bridge at night With lumps of ripeness and lush delight, Till the stream, as it maunders on till dawn, Is powdered and pelted and smiled upon. Herr Weiser, with his wholesome face, And the gentle blue of his eyes, and grace Of unassuming honesty, Be there to welcome you and me! And what though the toil of the farm be stopped And the tireless plans of the place be dropped, While the prayerful master's knees are set In beds of pansy and mignonette And lily and aster and columbine, Offered in love, as yours and mine?â What, but a blessing of kindly thought, Sweet as the breath of forget-me-not!â What, but a spirit of lustrous love White as the aster he bends above!â What, but an odorous memory Of the dear old man, made known to me In days demanding a help like his,â As sweet as the life of the lily isâ As sweet as the soul of a babe, bloom-wise Born of a lily in Paradise. FROM DELPHI TO CAMDEN I From Delphi to Camdenâlittle Hoosier towns,â But here were classic meadows, blooming dales and downs; And here were grassy pastures, dewy as the leas Trampled over by the trains of royal pageantries! And here the winding highway loitered through the shade Of the hazel covert, where, in ambuscade, Loomed the larch and linden, and the greenwood-tree Under which bold Robin Hood loud hallooed to me! Here the stir and riot of the busy day Dwindled to the quiet of the breath of May; Gurgling brooks, and ridges lily-marged and spanned By the rustic bridges found in Wonderland! II From Delphi to Camden,âfrom Camden back again!â And now the night was on us, and the lightning and the rain; And still the way was wondrous with the flash of hill and plain,â The stars like printed asterisksâthe moon a murky stain! And I thought of tragic idyl, and of flight and hot pursuit, And the jingle of the bridle and cuirass and spur on boot, As our horses' hooves struck showers from the flinty boulders set In freshet-ways of writhing reed and drowning violet. And we passed beleaguered castles, with their battlements a-frown; Where a tree fell in the forest was a turret toppled down; While my master and commanderâthe brave knight I galloped with On this reckless road to ruin or to fame wasâDr. Smith! A NOON INTERVAL A deep, delicious hush in earth and skyâ A gracious lullâsince, from its wakening, The morn has been a feverish, restless thing In which the pulse of Summer ran too high And riotous, as though its heart went nigh To bursting with delights past uttering: Now, as an o'erjoyed child may cease to sing All falteringly at play, with drowsy eye Draining the pictures of a fairy tale To brim his dreams withâthere comes o'er the day A loathful silence, wherein all sounds fail Like loitering tones of some faint roundelay ... No wakeful effort longer may availâ The wand waves, and the dozer sinks away. AT MADAME MANICURE'S Daintiest of Manicures! What a cunning hand is yours; And how awkward, rude and great Mine, as you manipulate! Wonderfully cool and calm Are the touches of your palm To my fingers, as they rest In their rosy, cozy nest, While your own, with deftest skill, Dance and caper as they will,â Armed with instruments that seem Gathered from some fairy dreamâ Tiny spears and simitars Such as pixy armorers Might have made for jocund fays To parade on holidays, And flash round in dewy dells, Lopping down the lily-bells; Or in tilting, o'er the leas, At the clumsy bumblebees, Splintering their stings, perchance, As the knights in old romance Snapped the spears of foes that fought In the jousts at Camelot! Smiling? Dainty Manicure?â 'Twould delight me, but that you're Simply smiling, as I see, At my nails and not at me! Haply this is why they glow And light up and twinkle so! JOHN McKEEN John McKeen, in his rusty dress, His loosened collar, and swarthy throat, His face unshaven, and none the less, His hearty laugh and his wholesomeness, And the wealth of a workman's vote! Bring him, O Memory, here once more, And tilt him back in his Windsor chair By the kitchen stove, when the day is o'er And the light of the hearth is across the floor, And the crickets everywhere! And let their voices be gladly blent With a watery jingle of pans and spoons, And a motherly chirrup of sweet content, And neighborly gossip and merriment, And old-time fiddle-tunes! Tick the clock with a wooden sound, And fill the hearing with childish glee Of rhyming riddle, or story found In the Robinson Crusoe, leather-bound Old book of the Used-to-be! John McKeen of the Past! Ah, John, To have grown ambitious in worldly ways!â To have rolled your shirt-sleeves down, to don A broadcloth suit, and, forgetful, gone Out on election days! John, ah, John! did it prove your worth To yield you the office you still maintain?â To fill your pockets, but leave the dearth Of all the happier things on earth To the hunger of heart and brain? Under the dusk of your villa trees, Edging the drives where your blooded span Paw the pebbles and wait your ease,â Where are the children about your knees, And the mirth, and the happy man? The blinds of your mansion are battened to; Your faded wife is a close recluse; And your âfinishedâ daughters will doubtless do Dutifully all that is willed of you, And marry as you shall choose!â But O for the old-home voices, blent With the watery jingle of pans and spoons, And the motherly chirrup of glad content, And neighborly gossip and merriment, And the old-time fiddle-tunes! THE BOY-FRIEND Clarence, my boy-friend, hale and strong! O he is as jolly as he is young; And all of the laughs of the lyre belong To the boy all unsung: So I want to sing something in his behalfâ To clang some chords, for the good it is To know he is near, and to have the laugh Of that wholesome voice of his. I want to tell him in gentler ways Than prose may do, that the arms of rhyme, Warm and tender with tuneful praise, Are about him all the time. I want him to know that the quietest nights We have passed together are yet with me, Roistering over the old delights That were born of his company. I want him to know how my soul esteems The fairy stories of Andersen, And the glad translations of all the themes Of the hearts of boyish men. Want him to know that my fancy flows, With the lilt of a dear old-fashioned tune, Through âLewis Carroll'sâ poemly prose, And the tale of âThe Bold Dragoon.â O this is the Prince that I would singâ Would drape and garnish in velvet line, Since courtlier far than any king Is this brave boy-friend of mine. WHEN BESSIE DIED âIf from your own the dimpled hands had slipped, And ne'er would nestle in your palm again; If the white feet into the grave had trippedââ When Bessie diedâ We braided the brown hair, and tied It just as her own little hands Had fastened back the silken strands A thousand timesâthe crimson bit Of ribbon woven into it That she had worn with childish prideâ Smoothed down the dainty bowâand criedâ When Bessie died. When Bessie diedâ We drew the nursery blinds aside, And, as the morning in the room Burst like a primrose into bloom, Her pet canary's cage we hung Where she might hear him when he sungâ And yet not any note he tried Though she lay listening folded-eyed. When Bessie diedâ We writhed in prayer unsatisfied: We begged of God, and He did smile In silence on us all the while; And we did see Him, through our tears, Enfolding that fair form of hers, She laughing back against His love The kisses we had nothing ofâ And death to us He still denied, When Bessie diedâ When Bessie died. THE RIVALS; OR THE SHOWMAN'S RUSE A TRAGI-COMEDY, IN ONE ACT PERSONS REPRESENTED Billy Miller The Rival Johnny Williams The Rival Tommy Wells Conspirator TimeâNoon. SceneâCountry TownâRear view of the Miller Mansion, showing Barn, with practical loft-window opening on alley-way, with colored-crayon poster on wall beneath, announcing: ââBilly Miller's Big Show and Monstur Circus and Equareum! A shour-bath fer Each and All fer 20 pins. This Afternoon! Don't fer git the Date!â Enter Tommy Wells and Johnny Williams, who gaze a while at poster, Tommy secretly smiling and winking at Billy Miller, concealed at loft-window above. Tommy [To Johnny] Guess 'at Billy hain't got back,â Can't see nothin' through the crackâ Can't hear nothin' neetherâNo! ... Thinks he's got the dandy show, Don't he? Johnny [Scornfully] 'Course! but what I care?â He hain't got no show in there!â What's he got in there but that Old hen, cooped up with a cat An' a turkle, an' that thing 'At he calls his âcircus-ringâ? What a âcircus-ringâ! I'd quit! Bet mine's twic't as big as it! Tommy Yes, but you got no machine W'at you bathe with, painted green, With a string to work it, guess! Johnny [Contemptuously] Folks don't bathe in circuses!â Ladies comes to mine, you bet! I' got seats where girls can set; An' a dressin'-room, an' all, Fixed up in my pony's stallâ Yes, an' I got carpet, too, Fer the tumblers, an' a blue Center-pole! Tommy Well, Billy, he's Got a tight-rope an' trapeze, An' a hoop 'at he jumps through Head-first! Johnny Well, what's that to doâ Lightin' on a pile o' hay? Hain't no actin' thataway! Tommy Don't care what you say, he draws Bigger crowds than you do, 'cause Sence he started up, I know All the fellers says his show Is the best-un! Johnny Yes, an' he Better not tell things on me! His old circus hain't no good!â 'Cause he's got the neighborhood Down on me he thinks 'at I'm Goin' to stand it all the time; Thinks ist 'cause my Pa don't 'low Me to fight, he's got me now, An' can say I lie, an' call Me ist anything at all! Billy Miller thinks I am 'Feard to say 'at he says âdamââ Yes, an' worser ones! an' I'm Goin' to tell his folks sometime!â An' ef he don't shet his head I'll tell worse 'an that he said When he fighted Willie Kingâ An' got licked like ever'thing!â Billy Miller better shin Down his Daddy's lane ag'in, Like a cowardy-calf, an' climb In fer home another time! Betterâ [Here Billy leaps down from the loft upon his unsuspecting victim; and two minutes later, Johnny, with the half of a straw hat, a bleeding nose, and a straight rent across one trousers-knee, makes his ingloriousâexit.] THE CHRIST âFather!â (so The Word) He cried,â âSon of Thine, and yet denied; By my brothers dragged and tried, Scoffed and scourged, and crucified, With a thief on either sideâ Brothers mine, alike belied,â Arms of mercy open wide, Father! Father!â So He died. TO HEAR HER SING To hear her singâto hear her singâ It is to hear the birds of Spring In dewy groves on blooming sprays Pour out their blithest roundelays. It is to hear the robin trill At morning, or the whippoorwill At dusk, when stars are blossomingâ To hear her singâto hear her sing! To hear her singâit is to hear The laugh of childhood ringing clear In woody path or grassy lane Our feet many never fare again. Faint, far away as Memory dwells, It is to hear the village bells At twilight, as the truant hears Them, hastening home, with smiles and tears. Such joy it is to hear her sing, We fall in love with everythingâ The simple things of every day Grow lovelier than words can say. The idle brooks that purl across The gleaming pebbles and the moss We love no less than classic streamsâ The Rhines and Arnos of our dreams. To hear her singâwith folded eyes, It is, beneath Venetian skies, To hear the gondoliers' refrain, Or troubadours of sunny Spain.â To hear the bulbul's voice that shook The throat that trilled for Lalla Rookh: What wonder we in homage bring Our hearts to herâto hear her sing! FROM THE HEADBOARD OF A GRAVE IN PARAGUAY A troth, and a grief, and a blessing, Disguised them and came this way,â And one was a promise, and one was a doubt, And one was a rainy day. And they met betimes with this maiden,â And the promise it spake and lied, And the doubt it gibbered and hugged itself, And the rainy dayâshe died. A CANARY AT THE FARM Folks has be'n to town, and Sahry Fetched 'er home a pet canary,â And of all the blame', contrary, Aggervatin' things alive! I love musicâthat's I love it When it's freeâand plenty of it;â But I kind o' git above it, At a dollar-eighty-five! Reason's plain as I'm a-sayin',â Jes' the idy, now, o' layin' Out yer money, and a-payin' Fer a willer-cage and bird, When the medder-larks is wingin' Round you, and the woods is ringin' With the beautifullest singin' That a mortal ever heard! Sahry's sot, tho'.âSo I tell her He's a purty little feller, With his wings o' creamy-yeller, And his eyes keen as a cat; And the twitter o' the critter 'Pears to absolutely glitter! Guess I'll haf to go and git her A high-priceter cage 'n that! SEPTEMBER DARK I The air falls chill; The whippoorwill Pipes lonesomely behind the hill: The dusk grows dense, The silence tense; And, lo, the katydids commence. II Through shadowy rifts Of woodland, lifts The low, slow moon, and upward drifts, While left and right The fireflies' light Swirls eddying in the skirts of Night. III O Cloudland, gray And level, lay Thy mists across the face of Day! At foot and head, Above the dead, O Dews, weep on uncomforted! ANSELMO Years did I vainly seek the good Lord's grace,â Prayed, fasted, and did penance dire and dread; Did kneel, with bleeding knees and rainy face, And mouth the dust, with ashes on my head; Yea, still with knotted scourge the flesh I flayed, Rent fresh the wounds, and moaned and shrieked insanely; And froth oozed with the pleadings that I made, And yet I prayed on vainly, vainly, vainly! A time, from out of swoon I lifted eye, To find a wretched outcast, gray and grim, Bathing my brow, with many a pitying sigh, And I did pray God's grace might rest on him.â Then, lo! a gentle voice fell on mine earsâ âThou shalt not sob in suppliance hereafter; Take up thy prayers and wring them dry of tears, And lift them, white and pure with love and laughter!â So is it now for all men else I pray; So is it I am blest and glad alway. TIME OF CLEARER TWITTERINGS I Time of crisp and tawny leaves, And of tarnished harvest sheaves, And of dusty grassesâweedsâ Thistles, with their tufted seeds Voyaging the Autumn breeze Like as fairy argosies: Time of quicker flash of wings, And of clearer twitterings In the grove or deeper shade Of the tangled everglade,â Where the spotted water-snake Coils him in the sunniest brake; And the bittern, as in fright, Darts, in sudden, slanting flight, Southward, while the startled crane Films his eyes in dreams again. II Down along the dwindled creek We go loitering. We speak Only with old questionings Of the dear remembered things Of the days of long ago, When the stream seemed thus and so In our boyish eyes:âThe bank Greener then, through rank on rank Of the mottled sycamores, Touching tops across the shores: Here, the hazel thicket stoodâ There, the almost pathless wood Where the shellbark hickory tree Rained its wealth on you and me. Autumn! as you loved us then, Take us to your heart again! III Season halest of the year! How the zestful atmosphere Nettles blood and brain and smites Into life the old delights We have wasted in our youth, And our graver years, forsooth! How again the boyish heart Leaps to see the chipmunk start From the brush and sleek the sun's Very beauty, as he runs! How again a subtle hint Of crushed pennyroyal or mint Sends us on our knees, as when We were truant boys of tenâ Brown marauders of the wood, Merrier than Robin Hood! IV Ah! will any minstrel say, In his sweetest roundelay, What is sweeter, after all, Than black haws, in early Fall?â Fruit so sweet the frost first sat, Dainty-toothed, and nibbled at! And will any poet sing Of a lusher, richer thing Than a ripe May-apple, rolled Like a pulpy lump of gold Under thumb and finger-tips, And poured molten through the lips? Go, ye bards of classic themes, Pipe your songs by classic streams! I would twang the redbird's wings In the thicket while he sings! THE BOYS Where are they?âthe friends of my childhood enchantedâ The clear, laughing eyes looking back in my own, And the warm, chubby fingers my palms have so wanted, As when we raced over Pink pastures of clover, And mocked the quail's whir and the bumblebee's drone? Have the breezes of time blown their blossomy faces Forever adrift down the years that are flown? Am I never to see them romp back to their places, Where over the meadow, In sunshine and shadow, The meadow-larks trill, and the bumblebees drone? Where are they? Ah! dim in the dust lies the clover; The whippoorwill's call has a sorrowful tone, And the dove'sâI have wept at it over and over;â I want the glad luster Of youth, and the cluster Of faces asleep where the bumblebees drone! LINCOLN A peaceful life;âjust toil and restâ All his desire;â To read the books he liked the best Beside the cabin fireâ God's word and man's;âto peer sometimes Above the page, in smoldering gleams, And catch, like far heroic rhymes, The on-march of his dreams. A peaceful life;âto hear the low Of pastured herds, Or woodman's ax that, blow on blow, Fell sweet as rhythmic words. And yet there stirred within his breast A fateful pulse that, like a roll Of drums, made high above his rest A tumult in his soul. A peaceful life! ... They haled him even As One was haled Whose open palms were nailed toward Heaven When prayers nor aught availed. And, lo, he paid the selfsame price To lull a nation's awful strife And will us, through the sacrifice Of self, his peaceful life. THE BLIND GIRL If I might see his face to-day!â He is so happy now!âTo hear His laugh is like a roundelayâ So ringing-sweet and clear! His stepâI heard it long before He bounded through the open door To tell his marriage.âAh! so kindâ So good he is!âAnd Iâso blind! But thus he always came to meâ Me, first of all, he used to bring His sorrow toâhis ecstasyâ His hopes and everything; And if I joyed with him or wept, It was not long the music slept,â And if he sung, or if I playedâ Or both,âwe were the braver made. I grew to know and understand His every word at every call,â The gate-latch hinted, and his hand In mine confessed it all: He need not speak one word to meâ He need not sighâI need not see,â But just the one touch of his palm, And I would answerâsong or psalm. He wanted recognitionânameâ He hungered so for higher things,â The altitudes of power and fame, And all that fortune brings: Till, with his great heart fevered thus, And aching as impetuous, I almost wished sometimes that he Were blind and patient made, like me. But he has won!âI knew he would.â Once in the mighty Eastern mart, I knew his music only could Be sung in every heart! And when he proudly sent me this From out the great metropolis, I bent above the graven score And, weeping, kissed it o'er and o'er.â And yet not blither sing the birds Than this glad melody,âthe tune As sweetly wedded with the words As flowers with middle-June; Had he not told me, I had known It was composed of love aloneâ His love for her.âAnd she can see His happy face eternally!â While IâO God, forgive, I pray!â Forgive me that I did so long To look upon his face to-day!â I know the wish was wrong.â Yea, I am thankful that my sight Is shielded safe from such delight:â I can pray better, with this blur Of blindnessâboth for him and her. THE KING They rode right out of the morning sunâ A glimmering, glittering cavalcade Of knights and ladies, and every one In princely sheen arrayed; And the king of them all, O he rode ahead, With a helmet of gold, and a plume of red That spurted about in the breeze and bled In the bloom of the everglade. And they rode high over the dewy lawn, With brave, glad banners of every hue That rolled in ripples, as they rode on In splendor, two and two; And the tinkling links of the golden reins Of the steeds they rode rang such refrains As the castanets in a dream of Spain's Intensest gold and blue. And they rode and rode; and the steeds they neighed And pranced, and the sun of their glossy hides Flickered and lightened and glanced and played Like the moon on rippling tides; And their manes were silken, and thick and strong, And their tails were flossy, and fetlock-long, And jostled in time to the teeming throng, And their knightly song besides. Clank of scabbard and jingle of spur, And the fluttering sash of the queen went wild In the wind, and the proud king glanced at her As one at a wilful child,â And as knight and lady away they flew, And the banners flapped, and the falcon, too, And the lances flashed and the bugle blew, He kissed his hand and smiled.â And then, like a slanting sunlit shower, The pageant glittered across the plain, And the turf spun back, and the wild-weed flower Was only a crimson stain. And a dreamer's eyes they are downward cast, As he blends these words with the wailing blast: âIt is the King of the Year rides past!â And Autumn is here again. A LIZ-TOWN HUMORIST Settin' round the stove, last night, Down at Wess's store, was me And Mart Strimples, Tunk, and White, And Doc Bills, and two er three Fellers o' the Mudsock tribe No use tryin' to describe! And says Doc, he says, says he,â âTalkin' 'bout good things to eat, Ripe mushmillon's hard to beat!â I chawed on. And Mart he 'lowed Wortermillon beat the mush.â âRed,â he says, âand juicyâHush!â I'll jes' leave it to the crowd!â Then a Mudsock chap, says he,â âPunkin's good enough fer meâ Punkin pies, I mean,â he says,â âThem beats millons!âWhat say, Wess?â I chawed on. And Wess says,ââWell, You jes' fetch that wife of mine All yer wortermillon-rine,â And she'll bile it down a spellâ In with sorghum, I suppose, And what else, Lord only knows!â But I'm here to tell all hands Them p'serves meets my demands!â I chawed on. And White he says,â âWell, I'll jes' stand in with Wessâ I'm no hog!â And Tunk says,ââI Guess I'll pastur' out on pie With the Mudsock boys!â says he; âNow what's yourn?â he says to me: I chawed onâferâquite a spellâ Then I speaks up, slow and dry,â âJes' tobacker!â I-says-I.â And you'd ort o' heerd 'em yell! LIKE HIS MOTHER USED TO MAKE âUncle Jake's Place,â St. Jo, Missouri, 1874. âI was born in Indiany,â says a stranger, lank and slim, As us fellers in the restarunt was kind o' guyin' him, And Uncle Jake was slidin' him another punkin pie And a' extry cup o' coffee, with a twinkle in his eye,â âI was born in Indianyâmore'n forty year' agoâ And I hain't be'n back in twentyâand I'm workin' back'ards slow; But I've et in ever' restarunt 'twixt here and Santy Fee, And I want to state this coffee tastes like gittin' home, to me! âPour us out another, Daddy,â says the feller, warmin' up, A-speakin' 'crost a saucerful, as Uncle tuk his cup,â âWhen I seed yer sign out yander,â he went on, to Uncle Jake,â ââCome in and git some coffee like yer mother used to makeââ I thought of my old mother, and the Posey County farm, And me a little kid ag'in, a-hangin' in her arm, As she set the pot a-bilin', broke the eggs and poured 'em inââ And the feller kind o' halted, with a trimble in his chin: And Uncle Jake he fetched the feller's coffee back, and stood As solemn, fer a minute, as a' undertaker would; Then he sort o' turned and tiptoed to'rds the kitchen doorâand nex', Here comes his old wife out with him, a-rubbin' of her specsâ And she rushes fer the stranger, and she hollers out, âIt's him!â Thank God we've met him comin'!âDon't you know yer mother, Jim?â And the feller, as he grabbed her, says,ââYou bet I hain't forgotâ But,â wipin' of his eyes, says he, âyer coffee's mighty hot!â A GOLDEN WEDDING DECEMBERâ1884 Your Golden Wedding!âfifty years Of comradeship, through smiles and tears! Through summer sun, and winter sleet, You walked the ways with willing feet; For, journeying together thus, Each path held something glorious. No winter wind could blow so chill But found you even warmer still In fervor of affectionâblest In knowing all was for the best; And so, content, you faced the storm And fared on, smiling, arm in arm. By why this moralizing strain Beside a hearth that glows again As on your Wooden wedding-day?â When butter-prints and paddles lay Around in dough-bowls, tubs and churns, And all such âwoodenishâ concerns; And âwoodenishâ they areâfor now Who can afford to keep a cow And pestle some old churn, when you Can buy good butterââgolden,â tooâ Far cheaper than you can afford To make it and neglect the Lord! And round your hearth the faces gleam That may recall, as in a dream, The brightness of a time when Tin Came glittering and clanging in And raising noise enough to seize And settle any swarm of bees! But those were darling times, no doubt,â To see the mother pouring out The âtinsâ of milk, and tilting up The coffee-pot above each cup; Or, with the ladle from the wall, Dipping and serving mush for all. And all the âweddings,â as they came,â The âGlass,â the âChina,ââstill the same You see them, till the last ere this,â The âSilver,ââand your wedded bliss Abated not!âfor love appears Just silvered over with the years:â Silver the grandchild's laugh you hearâ Silver his hopes, and silver-clear Your every prayer for him,âand still Silver your hope, through good and illâ Silver and silver everywhere, Bright as the silver of your hair! But on your Golden Wedding!âNayâ What can I give to you to-day Who am too very poor indeed To offer what I so much need? If gold I gave, I fear, alack! I'd needs provide you gave it back, To stay me, the long years before I'd stacked and heaped five dollars more! And so, in lieuâand little worseâ I proffer you this dross of verseâ The merest tinsel, I admit,â But take itâI have more of it. HIS CHRISTMAS SLED I I watch him with his Christmas sled; He hitches on behind A passing sleigh, with glad hooray, And whistles down the wind; He hears the horses champ their bits, And bells that jingle-jingleâ You Woolly Cap! you Scarlet Mitts! You miniature âKriss Kringleâ! I almost catch your secret joyâ Your chucklings of delight, The while you whiz where glory is Eternally in sight! With you I catch my breath, as swift Your jaunty sled goes gliding O'er glassy track and shallow drift, As I behind were riding! II He winks at twinklings of the frost, And on his airy race, Its tingles beat to redder heat The rapture of his face:â The colder, keener is the air, The less he cares a feather. But, there! he's gone! and I gaze on The wintriest of weather! Ah, Boy! still speeding o'er the track Where none returns again, To sigh for you, or cry for you, Or die for you were vain.â And so, speed on! the while I pray All nipping frosts forsake youâ Ride still ahead of grief, but may All glad things overtake you! A NEW YEAR'S TIME AT WILLARDS'S I THE HIRED MAN TALKS There's old man Willards; an' his wife; An' Marg'etâS'repty's sister;âan' There's meâan' I'm the hired man; An' Tomps McClure, you bet yer life! Well, now, old Willards hain't so bad, Considerin' the chance he's had. Of course, he's rich, an' sleeps an' eats Whenever he's a mind to: Takes An' leans back in the Amen-seats An' thanks the Lord fer all he makes.â That's purty much all folks has got Ag'inst the old man, like as not! But there's his womanâjes' the turn Of them-air two wild girls o' hernâ Marg'et an' S'reptyâallus in Fer any cuttin'-up concernâ Church festibals, an' foolishin' Round Christmas-trees, an' New Year's spreesâ Set up to watch the Old Year go An' New Year comeâsich things as these; An' turkey-dinners, don't you know! S'repty's younger, an' more gay, An' purtier, an' finer dressed Than Marg'et isâbut, lawsy-day! She hain't the independentest!â âTake care!â old Willards used to say, âTake care!âLet Marg'et have her way, An' S'repty, you go off an' play On your melodeum!ââBut, best Of all, comes Tomps! An' I'll be bound, Ef he hain't jes' the beatin'est Young chap in all the country round! Ef you know Tomps you'd like him, shore! They hain't no man on top o' ground Walks into my affections more!â An' all the Settlement'll say That Tomps was liked jes' thataway By ever'body, till he tuk A shine to S'repty Willards.âThen You'd ort 'o see the old man buck An' h'ist hisse'f, an' paw the dirt, An' hint that âcommon workin'-men That didn't want their feelin's hurt 'Ud better hunt fer âcomp'nyâ where The folks was pore an' didn't care!ââ The pine-blank facts is,âthe old man, Last Christmas was a year ago, Found out some presents Tomps had got Fer S'repty, an' hit made him hotâ Set down an' tuk his pen in hand An' writ to Tomps an' told him so On legal cap, in white an' black, An' give him jes' to understand âNo Christmas-gifts o' âlily-whiteâ An' bear's-ile could fix matters right,â An' wropped 'em up an' sent 'em back! Well, S'repty cried an' snuffled round Consid'able. But Marg'et she Toed out another sock, an' wound Her knittin' up, an' drawed the tea, An' then set on the supper-things, An' went up in the loft an' dressedâ An' through it all you'd never guessed What she was up to! An' she brings Her best hat with her an' her shawl, An' gloves, an' redicule, an' all, An' injirubbers, an' comes down An' tells 'em she's a-goin' to town To he'p the Christmas goin's-on Her Church got up. An' go she doesâ The best hosswoman ever was! âAn' what'll WE do while you're gone?â The old man says, a-tryin' to be Agreeable. âOh! you?â says she,â âYou kin jaw S'repty, like you did, An' slander Tomps!â An' off she rid! Now, this is all I'm goin' to tell Of this-here storyâthat is, I Have done my very level best As fur as this, an' here I âdwell,â As auctioneers says, winkin' sly: Hit's old man Willards tells the rest. II THE OLD MAN TALKS Adzackly jes' one year ago, This New Year's day, Tomps comes to meâ In my own house, an' whilse the folks Was gittin' dinner,âan' he pokes His nose right in, an' says, says he: âI got yer noteâan' read it slow! You don't like me, ner I don't you,â He says,ââwe're even there, you know! But you've said, furder, that no gal Of yourn kin marry me, er shall, An' I'd best shet off comin', too!â An' then he says,ââWell, them's YOUR views;â But, havin' talked with S'repty, we Have both agreed to disagree With your peculiar notionsâsome; An', that's the reason, I refuse To quit a-comin' here, but comeâ Not fer to threat, ner raise no skeer An' spile yer turkey-dinner here,â But, jes' fer S'repty's sake, to sheer Yer New Year's. Shall I take a cheer?â Well, blame-don! ef I ever see Sich impidence! I couldn't say Not nary word! But Mother she Sot out a cheer fer Tomps, an' they Shuk hands an' turnt their back on me. Then I rizâmad as mad could be!â But Marg'et says,ââNow, Pap! you set Right where you're settin'!âDon't you fret! An', Tompsâyou warm yer feet!â says she, âAn' throw yer mitts an' comfert on The bed there! Where is S'repty gone?â The cabbage is a-scortchin'! Ma, Stop cryin' there an' stir the slaw!â Well!âwhat was Mother cryin' fer?â I half riz upâbut Marg'et's chin Hit squaredâan' I set down ag'inâ I allus was afeard o' her, I was, by jucks! So there I set, Betwixt a sinkin'-chill an' sweat, An' scuffled with my wrath, an' shet My teeth to mighty tight, you bet! An' yit, fer all that I could do, I eeched to jes' git up an' whet The carvin'-knife a rasp er two On Tomps's ribsâan' so would you!â Fer he had riz an' faced around, An' stood there, smilin', as they brung The turkey in, all stuffed an' brownedâ Too sweet fer nose er tooth er tongue! With sniffs o' sage, an' p'r'aps a dash Of old burnt brandy, steamin'-hot, Mixed kind o' in with apple-mash An' mince-meat, an' the Lord knows what! Nobody was a-talkin' then, To 'filiate my awk'ardnessâ No noise o' any kind but jes' The rattle o' the dishes when They'd fetch 'em in an' set 'em down, An' fix an' change 'em round an' round, Like women doesâtill Mother says,â âVittels is ready; Abner, call Down S'reptyâshe's up-stairs, I guess.ââ And Marg'et she says, âEf you bawl Like that, she'll not come down at all! Besides, we needn't wait till she Gits down! Here, Tomps, set down by me, An' Pap: say grace!â ... Well, there I was!â What could I do! I drapped my head Behind my fists an' groaned, an' said:â âIndulgent Parent! in Thy cause We bow the head an' bend the knee, An' break the bread, an' pour the wine, Feelin'ââ(The stair-door suddently Went bang! an' S'repty flounced by me)â âFeelin',â I says, âthis feast is Thineâ This New Year's feastââan' rap-rap-rap! Went Marg'et's case-knife on her plateâ An' next, I heerd a sasser drap,â Then I looked up, an', strange to state, There S'repty set in Tomps's lapâ An' huggin' him, as shore as fate! An' Mother kissin' him k-slap!â An' Marg'etâshe chips in to drap The ruther peert remark to me:â âThat âgraceâ o' yourn,â she says, âwon't âgeeââ This hain't no âNew Year's feast,ââ says she,â âThis is a' INFAIR-Dinner, Pap!â An' so it was!âbe'n married fer Purt' nigh a week!â'Twas Marg'et planned The whole thing fer 'em, through an' through I'm rickonciled; an', understand, I take things jes' as they occur,â Ef Marg'et liked Tomps, Tomps 'ud do!â But I-says-I, a-holt his hand,â âI'm glad you didn't marry HERâ 'Cause Marg'et's my guardeenâyes-sir!â An' S'repty's good enough fer you!â WHATEVER THE WEATHER MAY BE âWhatever the weather may be,â says heâ âWhatever the weather may be, It's plaze, if ye will, an' I'll say me say,â Supposin' to-day was the winterest day, Wud the weather be changing because ye cried, Or the snow be grass were ye crucified? The best is to make yer own summer,â says he, âWhatever the weather may be,â says heâ âWhatever the weather may be! âWhatever the weather may be,â says heâ âWhatever the weather may be, It's the songs ye sing, an' the smiles ye wear, That's a-makin' the sun shine everywhere; An' the world of gloom is a world of glee, Wid the bird in the bush, an' the bud in the tree, An' the fruit on the stim o' the bough,â says he, âWhatever the weather may be,â says heâ âWhatever the weather may be! âWhatever the weather may be,â says heâ âWhatever the weather may be, Ye can bring the Spring, wid its green an' gold, An' the grass in the grove where the snow lies cold; An' ye'll warm yer back, wid a smiling face, As ye sit at yer heart, like an owld fireplace, An' toast the toes o' yer sowl,â says he, âWhatever the weather may be,â says heâ âWhatever the weather may be!â A LEAVE-TAKING She will not smile; She will not stir; I marvel while I look on her. The lips are chilly And will not speak; The ghost of a lily In either cheek. Her hairâah me! Her hairâher hair! How helplessly My hands go there! But my caresses Meet not hers, O golden tresses That thread my tears! I kiss the eyes On either lid, Where her love lies Forever hid. I cease my weeping And smile and say: I will be sleeping Thus, some day! DOWN ON WRIGGLE CRICK Best time to kill a hog's when he's fat âOld Saw Mostly, folks is law-abidin' Down on Wriggle Crick,â Seein' they's no Squire residin' In our bailywick; No grand juries, no suppeenies, Ner no vested rights to pick Out yer man, jerk up and jail ef He's outragin' Wriggle Crick!

Last year comes along a fellerâ Sharper 'an a lanceâ Stovepipe-hat and silk umbreller, And a boughten all-wool pants,â Tinkerin' of clocks and watches; Says a trial's all he wantsâ And rents out the tavern-office Next to Uncle Johnts.

LORD BACON WRITTEN AS A JOKE AND ASCRIBED TO A VERY PRACTICAL BUSINESS MAN, AMOS J. WALKER Master of masters in the days of yore, When art met insult, with no law's redress; When Law itself insulted Righteousness, And Ignorance thine own scholastic lore, And thou thine own judicial office more,â What master living now canst love thee less, Seeing thou didst thy greatest art repress And leave the years its riches to restore To us, thy long neglectors. Yield us grace To make becoming recompense, and dawn On us thy poet-smile; nor let us trace, In fancy, where the old-world myths have gone, The shade of Shakespeare, with averted face, Withdrawn to uttermost oblivion. MY FIRST WOMERN I buried my first womern In the spring; and in the fall I was married to my second, And hain't settled yit at all!â Fer I'm allus thinkin'âthinkin' Of the first one's peaceful ways, A-bilin' soap and singin' Of the Lord's amazin' grace. And I'm thinkin' of her, constant, Dyin' carpet-chain and stuff, And a-makin' up rag carpets, When the floor was good enough! And I mind her he'p a-feedin' And I riccollect her now A-drappin' corn, and keepin' Clos't behind me and the plow! And I'm allus thinkin' of her Reddin' up around the house; Er cookin' fer the farm-hands; Er a-drivin' up the cows.â And there she lays out yander By the lower medder fence, Where the cows was barely grazin', And they're usin' ever sence. And when I look acrost thereâ Say it's when the clover's ripe, And I'm settin', in the evenin', On the porch here, with my pipe, And the other'n hollers âHenry!ââ W'y they ain't no sadder thing Than to think of my first womern And her funeral last spring Was a year agoâ THE QUEST I am looking for Love. Has he passed this way, With eyes as blue as the skies of May, And a face as fair as the summer dawn?â You answer back, but I wander on,â For you say: âOh, yes; but his eyes were gray, And his face as dim as a rainy day.â Good friends, I query, I search for Love; His eyes are as blue as the skies above, And his smile as bright as the midst of May When the truce-bird pipes: Has he passed this way? And one says: âAy; but his face, alack! Frowned as he passed, and his eyes were black.â O who will tell me of Love? I cry! His eyes are as blue as the mid-May sky, And his face as bright as the morning sun; And you answer and mock me, every one, That his eyes were dark, and his face was wan, And he passed you frowning and wandered on. But stout of heart will I onward fare, Knowing my Love is beyondâsomewhere,â The Love I seek, with the eyes of blue, And the bright, sweet smile unknown of you; And on from the hour his trail is found I shall sing sonnets the whole year round. TO AN IMPORTUNATE GHOST Get gone, thou most uncomfortable ghost! Thou really dost annoy me with thy thin Impalpable transparency of grin; And the vague, shadowy shape of thee almost Hath vexed me beyond boundary and coast Of my broad patience. Stay thy chattering chin, And reel the tauntings of thy vain tongue in, Nor tempt me further with thy vaporish boast That I am helpless to combat thee! Well, Have at thee, then! Yet if a doom most dire Thou wouldst escape, flee whilst thou canst!âRevile Me not, Miasmic Mist!âRank Air! Retire! One instant longer an thou haunt'st me, I'll Inhale thee, O thou wraith despicable! WHO BIDES HIS TIME Who bides his time, and day by day Faces defeat full patiently, And lifts a mirthful roundelay, However poor his fortunes be,â He will not fail in any qualm Of povertyâthe paltry dime It will grow golden in his palm, Who bides his time. Who bides his timeâhe tastes the sweet Of honey in the saltest tear; And though he fares with slowest feet, Joy runs to meet him, drawing near: The birds are heralds of his cause; And, like a never-ending rhyme, The roadsides bloom in his applause, Who bides his time. Who bides his time, and fevers not In the hot race that none achieves, Shall wear cool-wreathen laurel, wrought With crimson berries in the leaves; And he shall reign a goodly king, And sway his hand o'er every clime, With peace writ on his signet-ring, Who bides his time. AS WE READ BURNS Who is speaking? Who has spoken? Whose voice ceasing thus has broken The sweet pathos of our dreams? Sweetest bard of sweetest themes, Pouring in each poet-heart Some rare essence of your art Till it seems your singing lip Kisses every pencil tip! Far across the unknown landsâ Reach of heavenly isle and seaâ How we long to touch the hands You outhold so lovingly! WHEN JUNE IS HERE When June is hereâwhat art have we to sing The whiteness of the lilies 'midst the green Of noon-tranced lawns? or flash of roses seen Like redbirds' wings? or earliest ripening Prince-harvest apples, where the cloyed bees cling Round winy juices oozing down between The peckings of the robin, while we lean In under-grasses, lost in marveling; Or the cool term of morning, and the stir Of odorous breaths from wood and meadow walks; The Bob-white's liquid yodel, and the whir Of sudden flight; and, where the milkmaid talks Across the bars, on tilted barley-stalks The dewdrops' glint in webs of gossamer. AT NOONâAND MIDNIGHT Far in the night, and yet no rest for him! The pillow next his own The wife's sweet face in slumber pressedâyet he awakeâalone! alone! In vain he courted sleep;âone thought would ever in his heart arise,â The harsh words that at noon had brought the teardrops to her eyes. Slowly on lifted arm he raised and listened. All was still as death; He touched her forehead as he gazed, and listened yet, with bated breath: Still silently, as though he prayed, his lips moved lightly as she sleptâ For God was with him, and he laid his face with hers and wept.

THE SPIRITS Father believed in 'em all his lifeâ But Mother, at first, she'd shake her headâ Till after the battle of Champion Hill, When many a flag in the winder-sill Had crape mixed in with the white and red! I used to doubt 'em myself till thenâ But me and Mother was satisfied When Ellen she set, and Father came And rapped âGod Bless You!â and Mother's name, And âThe Flag's up here!â ... And we all just cried. Used to come often, after that, And talk to usâjust as he used to do, Pleasantest kind! And once, for John, He said he was âlonesome, but wouldn't let onâ Fear Mother would worry, and Emmy and Lou.â But Lou was the bravest girl on earthâ For all she never was hale and strong, She'd have her fun!âWith her voice clean lost She'd laugh and joke us that âwhen she crossed To Father, we'd all come taggin' along!â Diedâjust that way! And the raps was thick That night, as they often since occur, Extry loud! And when Lou got back She said it was Father and herâand âwhack!â She tuk the tableâand we knowed her! John and Emmy, in five years more, Both had went.âAnd it seemed like fate,â For the old home it burnt down.âBut Jane And me and Ellen we built again The new house, here, on the old estate. And a happier family I don't know Of anywheresâunless it's them,â Father, with all his love for Lou, And her there with him, and healthy, too, And laughin', with John and little Em. And, first we moved in the new house here, They all dropped in for a long powwow:â âWe like your buildin', of course,â Lou said,â âBut wouldn't swap with you to save your headâ For we live in the ghost of the old house now!â ART AND LOVE He faced his canvas (as a seer whose ken Pierces the crust of this existence through) And smiled beyond on that his genius knew Ere mated with his being. Conscious then Of his high theme alone, he smiled again Straight back upon himself in many a hue And tint, and light and shade, which slowly grew Enfeatured of a fair girl's face, as when First time she smiles for love's sake with no fear. So wrought he, witless that behind him leant A woman, with old features, dim and sear, And glamoured eyes that felt the brimming tear, And with a voice, like some sad instrument, That sighing said, âI'm dead there; love me here!â SONG O I would I had a lover! A lover! a lover! O I would I had a lover With a twinkering guitar, To come beneath my casement Singing âThere is none above her,â While I, leaning, seemed to hover In the scent of his cigar! Then at morn I'd want to meet himâ To meet him! to meet him! O at morn I'd want to meet him, When the mist was in the sky, And the dew along the path I went To casually greet him, And to cavalierly treat him, And regret it by and by. And I'd want to meet his brotherâ His brother! his brother! O I'd want to meet his brother At the german or the play, To pin a rose on his lapel And lightly press the other, And love him like a motherâ While he thought the other way. O I'd pitilessly test him! And test him! and test him! O I'd pitilessly test him Far beyond his own control; And every tantalizing lure With which I could arrest him, I'd loosen to molest him, Till I tried his very soul. But ah, when I relented! Relented, relented! But ah, when I relentedâ When the stars were blurred and dim, And the moon above, with crescent grace, Looked off as I repented, And with rapture half demented, All my heart went out to him! PAP'S OLD SAYIN' Pap had one old-fashioned sayin' That I'll never quite fergitâ And they's seven growed-up childern Of us rickollects it yit!â Settin' round the dinner-table, Talkin' 'bout our friends, perhaps, Er abusin' of our neghbors, I kin hear them words o' Pap'sâ âShet up, and eat yer vittels!â Pap he'd never argy with us, Ner cut any subject short Whilse we all kep' clear o' gossip, And wuz actin' as we ort: But ef we'd git out o' orderâ Like sometimes a fambly is,â Faultin' folks, er one another, Then we'd hear that voice o' hisâ âShet up, and eat yer vittels!â Wuz no hand hisse'f at talkin'â Never hadn't much to say,â Only, as I said, pervidin' When we'd rile him thataway: Then he'd allus lose his temper Spite o' fate, and jerk his head And slam down his case-knife vicious' Whilse he glared around and saidâ âShet up, and eat yer vittels!â Mind last time 'at Pap was ailin' With a misery in his side, And had hobbled in the kitchenâ Jes' the day before he died,â Laury Jane she ups and tells him, âPap, you're pale as pale kin beâ Hain't ye 'feard them-air cowcumbers Hain't good fer ye?â And says he, âShet up, and eat yer vittels!â Well! I've saw a-many a sorrow,â Forty year', through thick and thin; I've got best,âand I've got worsted, Time and time and time ag'in!â But I've met a-many a trouble That I hain't run on to twice, Haltin'-like and thinkin' over Them-air words o' Pap's advice: âShet up, and eat yer vittels!â GRANNY Granny's come to our house, And ho! my lawzy-daisy!

BECALMED I Would that the winds might only blow As they blew in the golden long ago!â Laden with odors of Orient isles Where ever and ever the sunshine smiles, And the bright sands blend with the shady trees, And the lotus blooms in the midst of these. II Warm winds won from the midland vales To where the tress of the Siren trails O'er the flossy tip of the mountain phlox And the bare limbs twined in the crested rocks, High above as the sea-gulls flap Their lopping wings at the thunderclap. III Ah! that the winds might rise and blow The great surge up from the port below, Bloating the sad, lank, silken sails Of the Argo out with the swift, sweet gales That blew from Colchis when Jason had His love's full will and his heart was gladâ When Medea's voice was soft and low. Ah! that the winds might rise and blow! GRIGGSBY'S STATION Pap's got his pattent-right, and rich as all creation; But where's the peace and comfort that we all had before?

FESSLER'S BEES âTalkin' 'bout yer bees,â says Ike, Speakin' slow and ser'ous-like, âD' ever tell you 'bout old âBeeââ Old âBeeâ Fessler?â Ike says-he! âMight call him a bee-expert, When it come to handlin' bees,â Roll the sleeves up of his shirt And wade in amongst the trees Where a swarm 'u'd settle, andâ Blam'dest man on top of dirt!â Rake 'em with his naked hand Right back in the hive ag'in, Jes' as easy as you please!

Never seemed to me su'prisin' 'At the sting o' bees 'uz p'izin! â'Fore he went to Floridy,â Ike says, ânothin' 'bout a bee 'At old Fessler didn't know,â W'y, it jes' 'peared-like 'at he Knowed their language, high and low: Claimed he told jes' by their buzz What their wants and wishes wuz!

KNEE-DEEP IN JUNE I Tell you what I like the bestâ 'Long about knee-deep in June, 'Bout the time strawberries melts On the vine,âsome afternoon Like to jes' git out and rest, And not work at nothin' else!

THE LAW OF THE PERVERSE Where did the custom come from, anywayâ Sending the boys to âplay,â at dinner-time, When we have company? What is there, pray, About the starched, unmalleable guest That, in the host's most genial interest, Finds him first favor on Thanksgiving Day Beside the steaming turkey, with its wings Akimbo over all the savory things It has been stuffed with, yet may never thus Make one poor boy's face glad and glorious! Fancy the exiled boy in the back yard, Ahungered so, that any kind of grub Were welcome, yet with face set stern and hard, Hearing the feasters' mirth and mild hubbub, And wanting to kill something with a club!â Intuitively arguing the unjust Distinction, as he naturally must,â The guest with all the opportunityâ The boy with all the appetite! Ah, me! So is it that, when I, a luckless guest, Am thus arraigned at banquet, I sit grim And sullen, eating nothing with a zest,â With smirking features, yet a soul distressed, Missing the banished boy and envying himâ Ay, longing for a spatter on my vest From his deflecting spoon, and yearning for The wild swoop of his lips insatiate, or His ever-ravenous, marauding eye Fore-eating everything, from soup to pie! OUT OF NAZARETH âHe shall sleep unscathed of thieves Who loves Allah and believes.â Thus heard one who shared the tent, In the far-off Orient, Of the Bedouin ben Ahrzzâ Nobler never loved the stars Through the palm-leaves nigh the dim Dawn his courser neighed to him! He said: âLet the sands be swarmed With such thieves as I, and thou Shalt at morning rise, unharmed, Light as eyelash to the brow Of thy camel, amber-eyed, Ever munching either side, Striding still, with nestled knees, Through the midnight's oases. âWho can rob thee an thou hast More than this that thou hast cast At my feetâthis dust of gold? Simply this and that, all told! Hast thou not a treasure of Such a thing as men call love? âCan the dusky band I lead Rob thee of thy daily need Of a whiter soul, or steal What thy lordly prayers reveal? Who could be enriched of thee By such hoard of poverty As thy niggard hand pretends To dole meâthy worst of friends? Therefore shouldst thou pause to bless One indeed who blesses thee: Robbing thee, I dispossess But myself.âPray thou for me!â âHe shall sleep unscathed of thieves Who loves Allah and believes.â TIME I The ticklingâtickingâticking of the clock!â That vexed me so last night!ââFor though Time keeps Such drowsy watch,â I moaned, âhe never sleeps, But only nods above the world to mock Its restless occupant, then rudely rock It as the cradle of a babe that weeps!â I seemed to see the seconds piled in heaps Like sand about me; and at every shock O' the bell, the pilÃ¨d sands were swirled away As by a desert-storm that swept the earth Stark as a granary floor, whereon the gray And mist-bedrizzled moon amidst the dearth Came crawling, like a sickly child, to lay Its pale face next mine own and weep for day. II Wait for the morning! Ah! we wait indeed For daylight, we who toss about through stress Of vacant-armed desires and emptiness Of all the warm, warm touches that we need, And the warm kisses upon which we feed Our famished lips in fancy! May God bless The starved lips of us with but one caress Warm as the yearning blood our poor hearts bleed! ... A wild prayer!âbite thy pillow, praying soâ Toss this side, and whirl that, and moan for dawn; Let the clock's seconds dribble out their woe And Time be drained of sorrow! Long ago We heard the crowing cock, with answer drawn As hoarsely sad at throat as sobs. ... Pray on! IKE WALTON'S PRAYER I crave, dear Lord, No boundless hoard Of gold and gear, Nor jewels fine, Nor lands, nor kine, Nor treasure-heaps of anything.â Let but a little hut be mine Where at the hearthstone I may hear The cricket sing, And have the shine Of one glad woman's eyes to make, For my poor sake, Our simple home a place divine;â Just the wee cotâthe cricket's chirrâ Love, and the smiling face of her. I pray not for Great riches, nor For vast estates and castle halls,â Give me to hear the bare footfalls Of children o'er An oaken floor New-rinsed with sunshine, or bespread With but the tiny coverlet And pillow for the baby's head; And, pray Thou, may The door stand open and the day Send ever in a gentle breeze, With fragrance from the locust trees, And drowsy moan of doves, and blur Of robin-chirps, and drone of bees, With after-hushes of the stir Of intermingling sounds, and then The goodwife and the smile of her Filling the silences againâ The cricket's call And the wee cot, Dear Lord of all, Deny me not! I pray not that Men tremble at My power of place And lordly sway,â I only pray for simple grace To look my neighbor in the face Full honestly from day to dayâ Yield me his horny palm to hold, And I'll not pray For gold;â The tanned face, garlanded with mirth, It hath the kingliest smile on earth; The swart brow, diamonded with sweat, Hath never need of coronet. And so I reach, Dear Lord, to Thee, And do beseech Thou givest me The wee cot, and the cricket's chirr, Love, and the glad sweet face of her!

      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME V WHAT âOLD SANTAâ OVERHEARD 'Tis said old Santa Claus one time Told this joke on himself in rime: One Christmas in the early din That ever leads the morning in, I heard the happy children shout In rapture at the toys turned out Of bulging little socks and shoesâ A joy at which I could but choose To listen enviously, because I'm always just âOld Santa Claus.â But ere my rising sigh had got To its first quaver of the thought, It broke in laughter as I heard A little voice chirp like a birdâ âOld Santa's mighty good, I know, And awful richâand he can go Down ever' chimbly anywhere In all the world!âBut I don't care. I wouldn't trade with him, and be Old Santa Claus, and him be me, Fer all his toys and thingsâand I Know why and bet you he knows why!â They wuz no Santa Claus when he Wuz ist a little boy like me!â GRANT AT RESTâAUGUST 8, 1885 Sir Launcelot rode overthwart and endlong in a wide forest, and held no path but as wild adventure led him. ... And he returned and came again to his horse, and took off his saddle and his bridle, and let him pasture; and unlaced his helm, and ungirdled his sword, and laid him down to sleep upon his shield before the cross.â Age of Chivalry. What shall we say of the soldier, Grant, His sword put by and his great soul free How shall we cheer him now or chant His requiem befittingly? The fields of his conquest now are seen Ranged no more with his armÃ¨d menâ But the rank and file of the gold and green Of the waving grain is there again. Though his valiant life is a nation's pride, And his death heroic and half divine, And our grief as great as the world is wide, There breaks in speech but a single line:â We loved him living, revere him dead!â A silence then on our lips is laid: We can say no thing that has not been said, Nor pray one prayer that has not been prayed. But a spirit within us speaks: and lo, We lean and listen to wondrous words That have a sound as of winds that blow, And the voice of waters and low of herds; And we hear, as the song flows on serene, The neigh of horses, and then the beat Of hooves that scurry o'er pastures green, And the patter and pad of a boy's bare feet. A brave lad, wearing a manly brow, Knit as with problems of grave dispute, And a face, like the bloom of the orchard bough, Pink and pallid, but resolute; And flushed it grows as the clover-bloom, And fresh it gleams as the morning dew, As he reins his steed where the quick quails boom Up from the grasses he races through. And ho! as he rides what dreams are his? And what have the breezes to suggest?â Do they whisper to him of shells that whiz O'er fields made ruddy with wrongs redressed? Does the hawk above him an Eagle float? Does he thrill and his boyish heart beat high, Hearing the ribbon about his throat Flap as a Flag as the winds go by? And does he dream of the Warrior's fameâ This western boy in his rustic dress? For, in miniature, this is the man that came Riding out of the Wilderness!â The selfsame figureâthe knitted browâ The eyes full steadyâthe lips full muteâ And the face, like the bloom of the orchard bough, Pink and pallid, but resolute. Ay, this is the man, with features grim And stoical as the Sphinx's own, That heard the harsh guns calling him, As musical as the bugle blown, When the sweet spring heavens were clouded o'er With a tempest, glowering and wild, And our country's flag bowed down before Its bursting wrath as a stricken child. Thus, ready mounted and booted and spurred, He loosed his bridle and dashed away!â Like a roll of drums were his hoof-beats heard, Like the shriek of the fife his charger's neigh! And over his shoulder and backward blown, We heard his voice, and we saw the sod Reel, as our wild steeds chased his own As though hurled on by the hand of God! And still, in fancy, we see him ride In the blood-red front of a hundred frays, His face set stolid, but glorified As a knight's of the old Arthurian days: And victor ever as courtly, too, Gently lifting the vanquished foe, And staying him with a hand as true As dealt the deadly avenging blow. So, brighter than all of the cluster of stars Of the flag enshrouding his form to-day, His face shines forth from the grime of wars With a glory that shall not pass away: He rests at last: he has borne his part Of salutes and salvos and cheers on cheersâ But O the sobs of his country's heart, And the driving rain of a nation's tears! ON THE BANKS O' DEER CRICK On the banks o' Deer Crick! There's the place fer me!â Worter slidin' past ye jes' as clair as it kin be:â See yer shadder in it, and the shadder o' the sky, And the shadder o' the buzzard as he goes a-lazin' by; Shadder o' the pizen-vines, and shadder o' the treesâ And I purt' nigh said the shadder o' the sunshine and the breeze! Well!âI never seen the ocean ner I never seen the sea.â On the banks o' Deer Crick's grand enough fer me! On the banks o' Deer Crickâmil'd er two from townâ 'Long up where the mill-race comes a-loafin' down,â Like to git up in thereâ'mongst the sycamoresâ And watch the worter at the dam, a-frothin' as she pours: Crawl out on some old log, with my hook and line, Where the fish is jes' so thick you kin see 'em shine As they flicker round yer bait, coaxin' you to jerk, Tel yer tired ketchin' of 'em, mighty nigh, as work! On the banks o' Deer Crick!âAllus my delight Jes' to be around thereâtake it day er night!â Watch the snipes and killdees foolin' half the dayâ Er these-'ere little worter-bugs skootin' ever' way!â Snake-feeders glancin' round, er dartin' out o' sight; And dewfall, and bullfrogs, and lightnin'-bugs at nightâ Stars up through the tree-topsâer in the crick below,â And smell o' mussrat through the dark clean from the old by-o! Er take a tromp, some Sund'y, say, 'way up to âJohnson's Hole,â And find where he's had a fire, and hid his fishin'-pole: Have yer âdog-legâ with ye, and yer pipe and âcut-and-dryââ Pocketful o' corn-bread, and slug er two o' rye. ... Soak yer hide in sunshine and waller in the shadeâ Like the Good Book tells usââwhere there're none to make afraid!â Well!âI never seen the ocean ner I never seen the sea.â On the banks o' Deer Crick's grand enough fer me! BILLY COULD RIDE I O the way that Billy could ride! You should hear Grandfather tell of the ladâ For Grandfather was a horseman too, Though he couldn't ride now as he used to do, It yet was his glory and boast and pride, That he'd âbackâ Billy for all he hadâ And that's a cool million, I'll say to you!â And you should hear him, with all his praise Of this boy Billy, and his wild ways;â The way that he handled a horse, and the way He rode in town on election dayâ The way he bantered, and gaffed, and guyed, And the ways he swapped, and the ways he lied, And the way he'd laugh at his victims grim, Till half of the time they would laugh with him, Forgetting their anger, and pacifiedâ Seeing the way that Billy could ride! II Billy was born for a horse's back!â That's what Grandfather used to say:â He'd seen him in dresses, a-many a day, On a two-year-old, in the old barn-lot, Prancing around, with the bridle slack, And his two little sunburnt legs outshot So straight from the saddle-seat you'd swear A spirit-level had plumbed him there! And all the neighbors that passed the place Would just haul up in the road and stare To see the little chap's father boost The boy up there on his favorite roost, To canter off, with a laughing face.â Put him up there, he was satisfiedâ And O the way that Billy could ride! III At celebration or barbecueâ And Billy, a boy of fifteen yearsâ Couldn't he cut his didoes there?â What else would you expect him to, On his little mettlesome chestnut mare, With her slender neck, and her pointed ears, And the four little devilish hooves of hers? The âdelegationâ moved too slow For the time that Billy wanted to go! And to see him dashing out of the line At the edge of the road and down the side Of the long procession, all laws defied, And the fife and drums, was a sight divine, To the girls, in their white-and-spangled pride, Wearily waving their scarfs about In the great âBig Wagon,â all gilt without And jolt within, as they lumbered on Into the town where Billy had gone An hour ahead, like a knightly guideâ O but the way that Billy could ride! IV âBilly can ride! Oh, Billy can ride! But what on earth can he do beside?â That's what the farmers used to say, As time went by a year at a stride, And Billy was twenty if he was a day! And many a wise old father's foot Was put right down where it should be put, While many a dutiful daughter sighed In vain for one more glorious ride With the gallant Billy, who none the less Smiled at the old man's selfishness And kissed his daughter, and rode away,â Till one especially rich old chapâ Noted for driving a famous bayâ Gave poor Billy so sharp a rap Regarding HIS daughter, that Billy replied By noising it over the country wide, That the old curmudgeon was simply mad Because he (Billy) undoubtedly had A faster horse than the famous bay, And that was all that he had to say!â Touched his horse in the flankâand zipp!â Talk about horses and horsemanship!â Folks stared after him just wild-eyed. ... Oomh! the way that Billy could ride! V Bang the cymbals! and thump the drum! Stun the guineas! and pound the gong! Mr. Bull, git up and come! And beller and paw for five days long! Whoop and howl till you drown the band That hoots and toots in the âJudges' Stand!â For this is the term of the county fair, And you bet Billy will be there!â And watch him there, old horsemen, all! And judges, you, in your lifted stall! And gamblers, you, as you clap and clack, As the order is heard to clear the track! And watch him, you, by the âFloral Hall,â With sweet face, pink as the parasol You wave as you stand on the buggy-seat!â And you, young man, as you feel her hand Tremble in yours, as there you stand! And watch him, too, you old man gray, With your houses, lands, and your wealth completeâ Not forgetting the famous bay You ride with him in the race to-day!â And lash, as you start there side by side! Lash! for the sake of your bay defied! Lash! for the proof of your boasted pride! Lash! as you'd lash a cur that lied! Lash! but watch him with both eyes wideâ For O the way that Billy can ride. VI Side by side in the open track The horses stoodâsuch a glossy pair!â Trim as sparrows about to flyâ Plumage of mane and song of eye! Ho! They were beautiful!âbay and blackâ The sunshine glittered along each backâ Glanced at the shoulders, and flickered and run In dapples of light that would daze the sun!â The veins of their limbs like tremulous vines The breeze blows through, and the vibrant lines Of their nostrils like to the lips of the cups Of the gods, brimmed over with roseate supsâ From swish of tail to the toss of mane, Pharaoh's favorites lived again!â Lived, and served, and as nobly, too, As they sprang to the race, and onward flew! Ho! but the sight of them side by side!â Their masters' faces seemed glorified As they flashed from viewâin an instant gone, And you saw but their shoulders, as they rode on, Narrowingânarrowingâless and lessâ As you gazed after in breathlessness. VII Shoulder to shoulder, and neck to neckâ And the hearts of the crowd spun round with them As they dwindled away to the selfsame speckâ When suddenâa flashâlike the flash of a gem That had dropped in the dust, while onward came But one wild rider, who homeward 'ed, So mad with delight that he shrieked his nameâ And it was not âBillyââbut all the same, Though far behind, he was far ahead!â As the one rode in on âhis famous bay,â His gray hair streaming beneath his hat, And the wind-blown, upturned brim of that Flat on his foreheadâwas no acclaim,â The crowd was looking the other way! Where, far in the distance, and through the mist Of the dust, you saw where a hand was kissed As in hasty adieuânor was that all, But, fairly and clearly and sharply defined, You saw the black horse, with Billy astride, With a sweet little witch of a woman behind, Gaily waving a pink parasol, And the crowd answered roundly with cheer upon cheer, As the horse lightly wheeled with their manifold weight, And dashed from your gaze through the big lower gate, While back down the track, midst a tumult of jeers, Was seen to rack out, on a âwindedâ bay, An aged parentâamazedâirateâ On a race that might not end for years.â But end it did. ... ââWho WON the race!ââ Grandfather paused, with a graver face,â âWell, Billy wonâbut the reason why, Was the bay was âblowedââand so was I! âFizzles in everything else he's triedâ But O the way that Billy can ride!â DAVE FIELD Let me write you a rune of a rhyme, Dave Field, For the sake of the past we knew, When we were vagrants along the road, Yet glad as the skies were blue; When we struck hands, as in alien lands Old friend to old friend is revealed, And each hears a tongue that he understands, And a laugh that he loves, Dave Field. Ho! let me chant you a stave, Dave Field, Of those indolent days of ours, With our chairs atilt at the wayside inn Or our backs in the woodland flower; With your pipe alit, and the breath of it Like a nimbus about your head, While I sipped, like a monk, of your winy wit, With my matins all unsaid. Let me drone you a dream of the world, Dave Field, And the glory it held for usâ You with your pencil-and-canvas dreams, And I with my pencil thus; Yet with never a thought of the prize we sought, Being at best but a pain, As we looked from the heights and our blurred eyes caught The scenes of our youth again. Oh, let me sing you a song, Dave Field, Jolly and hale, but yet With a quaver of pathos along the lines, And the throb of a vain regret;â A sigh for the dawn long dead and gone, But a laugh for the dawn concealed, As bravely a while we still toil on Toward the topmost heights, Dave Field. WHEN WE THREE MEET When we three meet? Ah! friend of mine Whose verses well and flow as wine,â My thirsting fancy thou dost fill With draughts delicious, sweeter still Since tasted by those lips of thine. I pledge thee, through the chill sunshine Of autmun, with a warmth divine, Thrilled through as only I shall thrill When we three meet. I pledge thee, if we fast or dine, We yet shall loosen, line by line, Old ballads, and the blither trill Of our-time singersâfor there will Be with us all the Muses nine When we three meet. JOSH BILLINGS DEAD IN CALIFORNIA, OCTOBER 15, 1885 Jolly-hearted old Josh Billings, With his wisdom and his wit, And his gravity of presence, And the drollery of it!â Has he left us, and forever?â When so many merry years He has only left us laughingâ And he leaves us now in tears? Has he turned from his âDeer Publik,â With his slyly twinkling eyes Now grown dim and heavy-lidded In despite of sunny skies?â Yet with rugged brow uplifted, And the long hair tossed away, Like an old heroic lion, With a mane of iron-gray. Though we lose him, still we find him In the mirth of every lip, And we fare through all his pages In his glad companionship: His voice is wed with Nature's, Laughing in each woody nook With the chirrup of the robin And the chuckle of the brook. But the childrenâO the children!â They who leaped to his caress, And felt his arms about them, And his love and tenderness,â Whereâwhere will they find comfort As their tears fall like the rain, And they swarm his face with kisses That he answers not again? THE LAND OF THUS-AND-SO âHow would Willie like to go To the Land of Thus-and-So? Everything is proper thereâ All the children comb their hair Smoother than the fur of cats, Or the nap of high silk hats; Every face is clean and white As a lily washed in light; Never vaguest soil or speck Found on forehead, throat or neck; Every little crimpled ear, In and out, as pure and clear As the cherry-blossom's blow In the Land of Thus-and-So. âLittle boys that never fall Down the stairs, or cry at allâ Doing nothing to repent, Watchful and obedient; Never hungry, nor in hasteâ Tidy shoe-strings always laced, Never button rudely torn From its fellows all unworn; Knickerbockers always newâ Ribbon, tie, and collar, too; Little watches, worn like men, Always promptly half past tenâ Just precisely right, you know, For the Land of Thus-and-So! âAnd the little babies there Give no one the slightest careâ Nurse has not a thing to do But be happy and sigh âBoo!â While Mamma just nods, and knows Nothing but to doze and doze: Never litter round the grate; Never lunch or dinner late; Never any household din Peals without or rings withinâ Baby coos nor laughing calls On the stairs or through the hallsâ Just Great Hushes to and fro Pace the Land of Thus-and-So! âOh! the Land of Thus-and-So! Isn't it delightful, though?â âYes,â lisped Willie, answering me Somewhat slow and doubtfullyâ âMust be awful nice, but I Ruther wait till by and by 'Fore I go thereâmaybe when I be dead I'll go there then.â Butââthe troubled little face Closer pressed in my embraceâ âLe's don't never ever go To the Land of Thus-and-So!â THE HOSS The hoss he is a splendud beast; He is man's friend, as heaven desined, And, search the world from west to east, No honester you'll ever find! Some calls the hoss âa pore dumb brute,â And yit, like Him who died fer you, I say, as I theyr charge refute, ââFergive; they know not what they do!ââ No wiser animal makes tracks Upon these earthly shores, and hence Arose the axium, true as facts, Extoled by all, as âGood hoos-sense!â The hoss is strong, and knows his stren'th,â You hitch him up a time er two And lash him, and he'll go his len'th And kick the dashboard out fer you! But, treat him allus good and kind, And never strike him with a stick, Ner aggervate him, and you'll find He'll never do a hostile trick. A hoss whose master tends him right And worters him with daily care, Will do your biddin' with delight, And act as docile as you air. He'll paw and prance to hear your praise, Because he's learnt to love you well; And, though you can't tell what he says, He'll nicker all he wants to tell. He knows you when you slam the gate At early dawn, upon your way Unto the barn, and snorts elate, To git his corn, er oats, er hay. He knows you, as the orphant knows The folks that loves her like theyr own, And raises her and âfindsâ her clothes, And âschoolsâ her tel a womern-grown! I claim no hoss will harm a man, Ner kick, ner run away, cavort, Stump-suck, er balk, er âcatamaran,â Ef you'll jes' treat him as you ort. But when I see the beast abused, And clubbed around as I've saw some, I want to see his owner noosed, And jes' yanked up like Absolum! Of course they's differunce in stock,â A hoss that has a little yeer, And slender build, and shaller hock, Can beat his shadder, mighty near! Whilse one that's thick in neck and chist And big in leg and full in flank, That tries to race, I still insist He'll have to take the second rank. And I have jes' laid back and laughed, And rolled and wallered in the grass At fairs, to see some heavy-draft Lead out at first, yit come in last! Each hoss has his appinted place,â The heavy hoss should plow the soil;â The blooded racer, he must race, And win big wages fer his toil. I never betâner never wrought Upon my feller man to betâ And yit, at times, I've often thought Of my convictions with regret. I bless the hoss from hoof to headâ From head to hoof, and tale to mane!â I bless the hoss, as I have said, From head to hoof, and back again! I love my God the first of all, Then Him that perished on the cross, And next, my wife,âand then I fall Down on my knees and love the hoss. A OLD PLAYED-OUT SONG It's the curiousest thing in creation, Whenever I hear that old song âDo They Miss Me at Home,â I'm so bothered, My life seems as short as it's long!â Fer ev'rything 'pears like adzackly It 'peared in the years past and gone,â When I started out sparkin', at twenty, And had my first neckercher on! Though I'm wrinkelder, older and grayer Right now than my parents was then, You strike up that song âDo They Miss Me,â And I'm jes' a youngster again!â I'm a-standin' back thare in the furries A-wishin' fer evening to come, And a-whisperin' over and over Them words âDo They Miss Me at Home?â You see, Marthy Ellen she sung it The first time I heerd it; and so, As she was my very first sweethart, It reminds me of her, don't you know;â How her face ust to look, in the twilight, As I tuck her to Spellin'; and she Kep' a-hummin' that song tel I ast her, Pine-blank, ef she ever missed me! I can shet my eyes now, as you sing it, And hear her low answerin' words; And then the glad chirp of the crickets, As clear as the twitter of birds; And the dust in the road is like velvet, And the ragweed and fennel and grass Is as sweet as the scene of the lilies Of Eden of old, as we pass. âDo They Miss Me at Home?â Sing it lowerâ And softerâand sweet as the breeze That powdered our path with the snowy White bloom of the old locus' trees! Let the whipperwills he'p you to sing it, And the echoes 'way over the hill, Tel the moon boolges out, in a chorus Of stars, and our voices is still. But, oh! âThey's a chord in the music That's missed when her voice is away!â Though I listen from midnight tel morning, And dawn tel the dusk of the day! And I grope through the dark, lookin' up'ards And on through the heavenly dome, With my longin' soul singin' and sobbin' The words âDo They Miss Me at Home?â LITTLE ORPHANT ANNIE INSCRIBED WITH ALL FAITH AND AFFECTION To all the little children:âThe happy ones; and sad ones; The sober and the silent ones; the boisterous and glad ones; The good onesâYes, the good ones, too; and all the lovely bad ones. Little Orphant Annie's come to our house to stay, An' wash the cups an' saucers up, an' brush the crumbs away, An' shoo the chickens off the porch, an' dust the hearth, an' sweep, An' make the fire, an' bake the bread, an' earn her board-an'-keep; An' all us other childern, when the supper-things is done, We set around the kitchen fire an' has the mostest fun A-list'nin' to the witch-tales 'at Annie tells about, An' the Gobble-uns 'at gits you Ef you Don't Watch Out! Wunst they wuz a little boy wouldn't say his prayers,â An' when he went to bed at night, away up-stairs, His Mammy heerd him holler, an' his Daddy heerd him bawl, An' when they turn't the kivvers down, he wuzn't there at all! An' they seeked him in the rafter-room, an' cubby-hole, an' press, An' seeked him up the chimbly-flue, an' ever'-wheres, I guess; But all they ever found wuz thist his pants an' roundabout:â An' the Gobble-uns 'll git you Ef you Don't Watch Out! An' one time a little girl 'ud allus laugh an' grin, An' make fun of ever' one, an' all her blood-an'-kin; An' wunst, when they was âcompany,â an' ole folks wuz there, She mocked 'em an' shocked 'em, an' said she didn't care! An' thist as she kicked her heels, an' turn't to run an' hide, They wuz two great big Black Things a-standin' by her side, An' they snatched her through the ceilin' 'fore she knowed what she's about! An' the Gobble-uns 'll git you Ef you Don't Watch Out! An' little Orphant Annie says, when the blaze is blue, An' the lamp-wick sputters, an' the wind goes woo-oo! An' you hear the crickets quit, an' the moon is gray, An' the lightnin'-bugs in dew is all squenched away,â You better mind yer parunts, an' yer teachurs fond an' dear, An' churish them 'at loves you, an' dry the orphant's tear, An' he'p the pore an' needy ones 'at clusters all about, Er the Gobble-uns 'll git you Ef you Don't Watch Out! A DOS'T O' BLUES I got no patience with blues at all! And I ust to kind o' talk Ag'inst 'em, and claim, tel along last Fall, They wuz none in the fambly stock; But a nephew of mine, from Eelinoy, That visitud us last year, He kind o' convinct me differunt Whilse he wuz-a-stayin' here. From ev'ry-which-way that blues is from, They'd pester him ev'ry-ways; They'd come to him in the night, and come On Sund'ys, and rainy days; They'd tackle him in corn-plantin' time, And in harvest, and airly Fall,â But a dos't o' blues in the Winter-time, He 'lowed, wuz the worst of all! Said âAll diseases that ever he hadâ The mumps, er the rhumatizâ Er ev'ry-other-day-aigger-bad As ever the blame thing is!â Er a cyarbuncle, say, on the back of his neck, Er a felon on his thumb,â But you keep the blues away from him, And all o' the rest could come!â And he'd moan, âThey's nary a leaf below! Ner a spear o' grass in sight! And the whole wood-pile's clean under snow! And the days is dark as night! You can't go outâner you can't stay inâ Lay downâstand upâner set!â And a tetch o' regular tyfoid-blues Would double him jes' clean shet! I writ his parunts a postal-kyard He could stay tel Spring-time come; And Aprileâfirst, as I rickollectâ Wuz the day we shipped him home! Most o' his relatives, sence then, Has eether give up, er quit, Er jes' died off; but I understand He's the same old color yit! THE TRAIN-MISSER At Union Station 'Ll where in the world my eyes has binâ Ef I hain't missed that train ag'in! Chuff! and whistle! and toot! and ring! But blast and blister the dasted train!â How it does it I can't explain! Git here thirty-five minutes before The durn thing's due!âand, drat the thing! It'll manage to git pastâshore! The more I travel around, the more I got no sense!âTo stand right here And let it beat me! 'Ll ding my melts! I got no gumption, ner nothin' else! Ticket Agent's a dad-burned bore! Sell you a ticket's all they keer!â Ticket Agents ort to all be Prosecutedâand that's jes' what!â How'd I know which train's fer me? And how'd I know which train was not? Goern and comin' and gone astray, And backin' and switchin' ever'-which-way! Ef I could jes' sneak round behind Myse'f, where I could git full swing, I'd lift my coat, and kick, by jing! Till I jes' got jerked up and fined!â Fer here I stood, as a durn fool's apt To, and let that train jes' chuff and choo Right apast meâand mouth jes' gapped Like a blamed old sandwitch warped in two! THE PLAINT HUMAN Season of snows, and season of flowers, Seasons of loss and gain!â Since grief and joy must alike be ours, Why do we still complain? Ever our failing, from sun to sun, O my intolerant brother:â We want just a little too little of one, And much too much of the other.

REGARDIN' TERRY HUT Sence I tuk holt o' Gibbses' Churn And be'n a-handlin' the concern, I've traveled round the grand old State Of Indiany, lots, o' late!â I've canvassed Crawferdsville and sweat Around the town o' Layfayette; I've saw a many a County-seat I ust to think was hard to beat: At constant dreenage and expense I've worked Greencastle and Vincennesâ Drapped out o' Putnam into Clay, Owen, and on down thataway Plum into Knox, on the back-track Fer home ag'inâand glad I'm back!â I've saw these towns, as I sayâbut They's none 'at beats old Terry Hut! It's more'n likely you'll insist I claim this 'cause I'm predjudist, Bein' born'd here in ole Vygo In sight o' Terry Hut;âbut no, Yer clean dead wrong!âand I maintain They's nary drap in ary vein O' mine but what's as free as air To jes' take issue with you there!â 'Cause, boy and man, fer forty year, I've argied ag'inst livin' here, And jawed around and traded lies About our lack o' enterprise, And tuk and turned in and agreed All other towns was in the lead, Whenâdrat my melts!âthey couldn't cut No shine a-tall with Terry Hut! Take, even, statesmanship, and wit, And ginerel git-up-and-git, Old Terry Hut is sound clean through!â Turn old Dick Thompson loose, er Dan Voreheesâand where's they any man Kin even hold a candle to Their eloquence?âAnd where's as clean A fi-nan-seer as Rile' McKeenâ Er puorer, in his daily walk, In railroad er in racin' stock! And there's 'Gene Debsâa man 'at stands And jes' holds out in his two hands As warm a heart as ever beat Betwixt here and the Jedgment Seat!â All these is reasons why I putt Sich bulk o' faith in Terry Hut. So I've come back, with eyes 'at sees My faults, at last,âto make my peace With this old place, and truthful' swearâ Like Gineral Tom Nelson does,â âThey hain't no city anywhere On God's green earth lays over us!â Our city govament is grandâ âNer is they better farmin'-land Sun-kissedââas Tom goes on and saysâ âEr dower'd with sich advantages!â And I've come back, with welcome tread, From journeyin's vain, as I have said, To settle down in ca'm content, And cuss the towns where I have went, And brag on ourn, and boast and strut Around the streets o' Terry Hut! A TALE OF THE AIRLY DAYS Oh! tell me a tale of the airly daysâ Of the times as they ust to be; âPiller of Fi-erâ and âShakespeare's Playsâ Is a'most too deep for me! I want plane facts, and I want plane words, Of the good old-fashioned ways, When speech run free as the songs of birds 'Way back in the airly days. Tell me a tale of the timber-landsâ Of the old-time pioneers; Somepin' a pore man understands With his feelin's 's well as ears. Tell of the old log house,âabout The loft, and the puncheon floreâ The old fi-er-place, with the crane swung out, And the latch-string thrugh the door. Tell of the things jest as they wasâ They don't need no excuse!â Don't tetch 'em up like the poets does, Tel theyr all too fine fer use!â Say they was 'leven in the fambilyâ Two beds, and the chist, below, And the trundle-beds that each helt three, And the clock and the old bureau. Then blow the horn at the old back-door Tel the echoes all halloo, And the childern gethers home onc't more, Jest as they ust to do: Blow fer Pap tel he hears and comes, With Tomps and Elias, too, A-marchin' home, with the fife and drums And the old Red White and Blue! Blow and blow tel the sound draps low As the moan of the whipperwill, And wake up Mother, and Ruth and Jo, All sleepin' at Bethel Hill: Blow and call tel the faces all Shine out in the back-log's blaze, And the shadders dance on the old hewed wall As they did in the airly days. THE ROSSVILLE LECTUR' COURSE [Set down from the real facts of the case that come under notice of the author whilse visitun far distunt relatives who wuz then residin' at Rossville, Mich.] Folks up here at Rossville got up a Lectur' Course:â All the leadin' citizens they wuz out in force; Met and talked at Williamses', and 'greed to meet ag'in; And helt another corkus when the next reports wuz in: Met ag'in at Samuelses'; and met ag'in at Moore's And Johnts putt the shutters up and jest barr'd the doors!â And yit, I'll jest be dagg-don'd! ef't didn't take a week 'Fore we'd settled whare to write to git a man to speak! Found out whare the âBureauâ wuz; and then and thare agreed To strike whilse the iron's hot and foller up the lead.â Simp wuz Secatary; so he tuk his pen in hand, And ast 'em what they'd tax us fer the one on âHoly Landââ âOne of Colonel J. De-Koombs's Abelust and Best Lectur's,â the circ'lar stated, âGive East er West!â Wanted fifty dollars and his kyar-fare to and from, And Simp wuz hence instructed fer to write him not to come. Then we talked and jawed around another week er so, And writ the âBureauâ bout the town a-bein' sorto' slowâ Old-fogey-like, and pore as dirt, and lackin' interprise, And ignornter'n any other, 'cordin' to its size: Tel finully the âBureauâ said they'd send a cheaper man Fer forty dollars, who would give âA Talk About Japanââ âA reg'lar Japanee hise'f,â the pamphlet claimed; and so, Nobody knowed his languige, and of course we let him go! Kindo' then let up a spellâbut rallied onc't ag'in, And writ to price a feller on what's called the âviolinââ A Swede, er Pole, er somepin'âbut no matter what he wuz, Doc Cooper said he'd heerd him, and he wuzn't wuth a kuss! And then we ast fer Swingse's terms; and Cook, and Ingersollâ And blame! ef forty dollars looked like anything at all! And then Burdette, we tried fer him; and Bob he writ to say He wuz busy writin' ortographts and couldn't git away. At lastâalong in Aprileâwe signed to take this-here Bill Nye of Californy, 'at wuz posted to appear âThe Comicalest Funny Man 'at Ever Jammed a Hall!â So we made big preperations, and swep' out the church and all! And night he wuz to lectur', and the neghbors all wuz thare, And strangers packed along the aisles 'at come from ev'rywhare, Committee got a telegrapht the preacher read, 'at runâ âGot off at Rossville, Indiany, 'stid of Michigun.â HER BEAUTIFUL EYES O her beautiful eyes! they are as blue as the dew On the violet's bloom when the morning is new, And the light of their love is the gleam of the sun O'er the meadows of Spring where the quick shadows run: As the morn shifts the mists and the clouds from the skiesâ So I stand in the dawn of her beautiful eyes. And her beautiful eyes are as midday to me, When the lily-bell bends with the weight of the bee, And the throat of the thrush is apulse in the heat, And the senses are drugged with the subtle and sweet And delirious breaths of the air's lullabiesâ So I swoon in the noon of her beautiful eyes. O her beautiful eyes! they have smitten mine own As a glory glanced down from the glare of The Throne; And I reel, and I falter and fall, as afar Fell the shepherds that looked on the mystical Star, And yet dazed in the tidings that bade them ariseâ So I grope through the night of her beautiful eyes. WANT TO BE WHUR MOTHER IS âWant to be whur mother is! Want to be whur mother is!â Jeemses Rivers! won't some one ever shet that how! o' his? That-air yellin' drives me wild! Cain't none of ye stop the child? Want yer Daddy? âNaw.â Gee whizz! âWant to be whur mother is!â âWant to be whur mother is! Want to be whur mother is!â Coax him, Sairy! Mary, sing somepin' fer him! Lift him, Lizâ Bang the clock-bell with the keyâ Er the meat-ax! Gee-mun-nee! Listen to them lungs o' his! âWant to be whur mother is!â âWant to be whur mother is! Want to be whur mother is!â Preacher guess 'll pound all night on that old pulpit o' his; 'Pears to me some wimmin jest Shows religious interest Mostly 'fore their fambly's riz! âWant to be whur mother is!â âWant to be whur mother is! Want to be whur mother is!â Nights like these and whipperwills allus brings that voice of his! Sairy; Mary; 'Lizabeth; Don't set there and ketch yer death In the dewâer rheumatizâ Want to be whur mother is? BABE HERRICK As a rosebud might, in dreams, 'Mid some lilies lie, meseems Thou, pink youngling, on the breast Of thy mother slumberest. TO A JILTED SWAIN Get thee back neglected friends; And repay, as each one lends, Tithes of shallow-sounding glee Or keen-ringing raillery: Get thee from lone vigils; be But in jocund company, Where is laughter and acclaim Boisterous above the name.â Get where sulking husbands sip Ale-house cheer, with pipe at lip; And where Mol the barmaid saith Curst is she that marrieth. KNEELING WITH HERRICK Dear Lord, to Thee my knee is bent.â Give me contentâ Full-pleasured with what comes to me, Whate'er it be: An humble roofâa frugal board, And simple hoard; The wintry fagot piled beside The chimney wide, While the enwreathing flames up-sprout And twine about The brazen dogs that guard my hearth And household worth: Tinge with the embers' ruddy glow The rafters low; And let the sparks snap with delight, As fingers might That mark deft measures of some tune The children croon: Then, with good friends, the rarest few Thou holdest true, Ranged round about the blaze, to share My comfort there,â Give me to claim the service meet That makes each seat A place of honor, and each guest Loved as the rest. IN THE SOUTH There is a princess in the South About whose beauty rumors hum Like honey-bees about the mouth Of roses dewdrops falter from; And O her hair is like the fine Clear amber of a jostled wine In tropic revels; and her eyes Are blue as rifts of Paradise. Such beauty as may none before Kneel daringly, to kiss the tips Of fingers such as knights of yore Had died to lift against their lips: Such eyes as might the eyes of gold Of all the stars of night behold With glittering envy, and so glare In dazzling splendor of despair. So, were I but a minstrel, deft At weaving, with the trembling strings Of my glad harp, the warp and weft Of rondels such as rapture sings,â I'd loop my lyre across my breast, Nor stay me till my knee found rest In midnight banks of bud and flower Beneath my lady's lattice-bower. And there, drenched with the teary dews, I'd woo her with such wondrous art As well might stanch the songs that ooze Out of the mockbird's breaking heart; So light, so tender, and so sweet Should be the words I would repeat, Her casement, on my gradual sight, Would blossom as a lily might. THE HAPPY LITTLE CRIPPLE I'm thist a little crippled boy, an' never goin' to grow An' git a great big man at all!â'cause Aunty told me so. When I was thist a baby onc't I falled out of the bed An' got âThe Curv'ture of the Spineââ'at's what the Doctor said. I never had no Mother nenâfer my Pa runned away An' dassn't come back here no moreâ'cause he was drunk one day An' stobbed a man in thish-ere town, an' couldn't pay his fine! An' nen my Ma she diedâan' I got âCurv'ture of the Spineâ! I'm nine years old! An' you can't guess how much I weigh, I bet!â Last birthday I weighed thirty-three!âAn' I weigh thirty yet! I'm awful little fer my sizeâI'm purt' nigh littler nan Some babies is!âan' neighbers all calls me âThe Little Manâ! An' Doc one time he laughed an' said: âI s'pect, first think you know, You'll have a little spike-tail coat an' travel with a show!â An' nen I laughedâtill I looked round an' Aunty was a-cryin'â Sometimes she acts like that, 'cause I got âCurv'ture of the Spineâ! I setâwhile Aunty's washin'âon my little long-leg stool, An' watch the little boys an' girls a-skippin' by to school; An' I peck on the winder, an' holler out an' say: âWho wants to fight The Little Man 'at dares you all to-day?â An' nen the boys climbs on the fence, an' little girls peeks through, An' they all says: â'Cause you're so big, you think we're 'feard o' you!â An' nen they yell, an' shake their fist at me, like I shake mineâ They're thist in fun, you know, 'cause I got âCurv'ture of the Spineâ! At evening, when the ironin' 's done, an' Aunty's fixed the fire, An' filled an' lit the lamp, an' trimmed the wick an' turned it higher, An' fetched the wood all in fer night, an' locked the kitchen door, An' stuffed the old crack where the wind blows in up through the floorâ She sets the kittle on the coals, an' biles an' makes the tea, An' fries the liver an' the mush, an' cooks a egg fer me; An' sometimesâwhen I cough so hardâher elderberry wine Don't go so bad fer little boys with âCurv'ture of the Spineâ! An' nen when she putts me to bedâan' 'fore she does she's got My blanket-nighty, 'at she maked, all good an' warm an' hot, Hunged on the rocker by the fireâshe sings me hymns, an' tells Me 'bout The Good Manâyes, an' Elves, an' Old Enchanter spells; An' tells me moreâan' moreâan' more!âtel I'm asleep, purt' nighâ Only I thist set up ag'in an' kiss her when she cry, A-tellin' on 'bout some boy's Angel-motherâan' it's mine! ... My Ma's a Angelâbut I'm got âThe Curv'ture of the Spineâ! But Aunty's all so childish-like on my account, you see, I'm most afeard she'll be took downâan' 'at's what bothers me!â 'Cause ef my good old Aunty ever would git sick an' die, I don't know what she'd do in Heavenâtill I come, by an' by: Fer she's so ust to all my ways, an' ever'thing, you know, An' no one there like me, to nurse an' worry over so!â 'Cause all the little childerns there's so straight an' strong an' fine, They's nary angel 'bout the place with âCurv'ture of the Spineâ! HAS SHE FORGOTTEN I Has she forgotten? On this very May We were to meet here, with the birds and bees, As on that Sabbath, underneath the trees We strayed among the tombs, and stripped away The vines from these old granites, cold and grayâ And yet, indeed, not grim enough were they To stay our kisses, smiles and ecstasies, Or closer voice-lost vows and rhapsodies. Has she forgottenâthat the May has won Its promise?âthat the bird-songs from the tree Are sprayed above the grasses as the sun Might jar the dazzling dew down showeringly? Has she forgotten lifeâloveâevery oneâ Has she forgotten meâforgotten me? II Low, low down in the violets I press My lips and whisper to her. Does she hear, And yet hold silence, though I call her dear, Just as of old, save for the tearfulness Of the clenched eyes, and the soul's vast distress? Has she forgotten thus the old caress That made our breath a quickened atmosphere That failed nigh unto swooning with the sheer Delight? Mine arms clutch now this earthen heap Sodden with tears that flow on ceaselessly As autumn rains the long, long, long nights weep In memory of days that used to be,â Has she forgotten these? And, in her sleep, Has she forgotten meâforgotten me? III To-night, against, my pillow, with shut eyes, I mean to weld our facesâthrough the dense Incalculable darkness make pretense That she has risen from her reveries To mate her dreams with mine in marriages Of mellow palms, smooth faces, and tense ease Of every longing nerve of indolence,â Lift from the grave her quiet lips, and stun My senses with her kissesâdraw the glee Of her glad mouth, full blithe and tenderly, Across mine own, forgetful if is done The old love's awful dawn-time when said we, âTo-day is ours!â ... Ah, Heaven! can it be She has forgotten meâforgotten me! ILLILEO Illileo, the moonlight seemed lost across the valesâ The stars but strewed the azure as an armor's scattered scales; The airs of night were quiet as the breath of silken sails, And all your words were sweeter than the notes of nightingales. Illileo Legardi, in the garden there alone, With your figure carved of fervor, as the Psyche carved of stone, There came to me no murmur of the fountain's undertone So mystically, musically mellow as your own. You whispered low, Illileoâso low the leaves were mute, And the echoes faltered breathless in your voice's vain pursuit; And there died the distant dalliance of the serenader's lute: And I held you in my bosom as the husk may hold the fruit. Illileo, I listened. I believed you. In my bliss, What were all the worlds above me since I found you thus in this?â Let them reeling reach to win meâeven Heaven I would miss, Grasping earthward!âI would cling here, though I clung by just a kiss. And blossoms should grow odorlessâand lilies all aghastâ And I said the stars should slacken in their paces through the vast, Ere yet my loyalty should fail enduring to the last.â So vowed I. It is written. It is changeless as the past. Illileo Legardi, in the shade your palace throws Like a cowl about the singer at your gilded porticoes, A moan goes with the music that may vex the high repose Of a heart that fades and crumbles as the crimson of a rose. THE JOLLY MILLER RESTORED ROMAUNT It was a Jolly Miller lived on the River Dee; He looked upon his piller, and there he found a flea: âO Mr. Flea! you have bit me, And you shall shorely die!â So he scrunched his bones ag'inst the stonesâ And there he let him lie! 'Twas then the Jolly Miller he laughed and told his wife, And she laughed fit to kill her, and dropped her carving knife!â âO Mr. Flea!â âHo-ho!â âTee-hee!â They both laughed fit to kill, Until the sound did almost drownd The rumble of the mill! âLaugh on, my Jolly Miller! and Missus Miller, too!â But there's a weeping-willer will soon wave over you!â The voice was all so awful smallâ So very small and slim!â He durst' infer that it was her, Ner her infer 'twas him! That night the Jolly Miller, says he, âIt's, Wifey dear, That cat o' yourn, I'd kill her!âher actions is so queer,â She's rubbin' 'g'inst the grindstone-legs, And yowlin' at the skyâ And I 'low the moon hain't greener Than the yaller of her eye!â And as the Jolly Miller went chuckle-un to bed, Was Somepin' jerked his piller from underneath his head! âO Wife,â says he, on-easi-lee, âFetch here that lantern there!â But Somepin' moans in thunder-tones, âYou tetch it ef you dare!â 'Twas then the Jolly Miller he trimbled and he quailedâ And his wife choked until her breath come back, 'n' she wailed! And âOh!â cried she, âit is the Flea, All white and pale and wannâ He's got you in his clutches, and He's bigger than a man!â âHo! ho! my Jolly Millerâ (fer 'twas the Flea, fer shore!), âI reckon you'll not rack my bones ner scrunch 'em any more!â Then the Flea-Ghost he grabbed him clos't, With many a ghastly smile, And from the door-step stooped and hopped About four hundred mile! HE COMETH IN SWEET SENSE He cometh in sweet sense to thee, Be it or dawn, or noon, or night,â No deepest pain, nor halest glee, But He discerneth it aright. If there be tears bedim thine eyes, His sympathy thou findest plain,â The darkest midnight of the skies He weepeth with the tears of rain. If thou art joyful, He hath had His gracious will, and lo, 'tis well,â As thou art glad, so He is glad, Nor mercy strained one syllable. Wild vows are words, as prayers are words.â God's mercy is not measured by Our poor deservings: He affords To listen, if we laugh or cry. KINGRY'S MILL On old Brandywineâabout Where White's Lots is now laid out, And the old crick narries down To the ditch that splits the town,â Kingry's Mill stood. Hardly see Where the old dam ust to be; Shallor, long, dry trought o' grass Where the old race ust to pass! That's be'n forty years agoâ Forty years o' frost and snowâ Forty years o' shade and shine Sence them boyhood-days o' mine!â All the old landmarks o' town Changed about, er rotted down! Where's the Tanyard? Where's the Still? Tell me where's old Kingry's Mill? Don't seem furder back, to me, I'll be dogg'd! than yisterd'y, Sence us fellers, in bare feet And straw hats, went through the wheat, Cuttin' 'crost the shortest shoot Fer that-air old ellum-root Jest above the mill-damâwhere The blame' cars now crosses there! Through the willers down the crick We could see the old mill stick Its red gable up, as if It jest knowed we'd stol'd the skiff! See the winders in the sun Blink like they wuz wunderun' What the miller ort to do With sich boys as me and you! But old Kingry!âwho could fear That old chap, with all his cheer?â Leanin' at the winder-sill, Er the half-door o' the mill, Swappin' lies, and pokin' fun, 'N' jigglin' like his hoppers doneâ Laughin' grists o' gold and red Right out o' the wagon-bed! What did he keer where we went?â âJest keep out o' devilment, And don't fool around the belts, Bolts, ner burrs, ner nothin' else 'Bout the blame machinery, And that's all I ast!â says-ee. Then we'd climb the stairs, and play In the bran-bins half the day! Rickollect the dusty wall, And the spider-webs, and all! Rickollect the trimblin' spout Where the meal come josslin' outâ Stand and comb yer fingers through The fool-truck an hour er twoâ Felt so sort o' warm-like and Soothin' to a feller's hand! Climb, high up above the stream, And âcoonâ out the wobbly beam And peek down from out the lof' Where the weather-boards was offâ Gee-mun-nee! w'y, it takes grit Even jest to think of it!â Lookin' way down there below On the worter roarin' so! Rickollect the flume, and wheel, And the worter slosh and reel And jest ravel out in froth Flossier'n satin cloth! Rickollect them paddles jest Knock the bubbles galley-west, And plunge under, and come up, Drippin' like a worter-pup! And, to see them old things gone That I onc't was bettin' on, In rale p'int o' fact, I feel Kind o' like that worter-wheel,â Sort o' drippy-like and wet Round the eyesâbut paddlin' yet, And, in mem'ry, loafin' still Down around old Kingry's Mill! THE EARTHQUAKE CHARLESTON, SEPTEMBER 1, 1886 An hour ago the lulling twilight leant Above us like a gentle nurse who slips A slow palm o'er our eyes, in soft eclipse Of feigned slumber of most sweet content. The fragrant zephyrs of the tropic went And came across the senses, like to sips Of lovers' kisses, when upon her lips Silence sets finger in grave merriment. Thenâsuddenâdid the earth moan as it slept, And start as one in evil dreams, and toss Its peopled arms up, as the horror crept, And with vast breast upheaved and rent across, Fling down the storied citadel where wept, And still shall weep, a world above its loss. A FALL-CRICK VIEW OF THE EARTHQUAKE I kin hump my back and take the rain, And I don't keer how she pours; I kin keep kind o' ca'm in a thunder-storm, No matter how loud she roars; I hain't much skeered o' the lightnin', Ner I hain't sich awful shakes Afeard o' cyclonesâbut I don't want none O' yer dad-burned old earthquakes! As long as my legs keeps stiddy, And long as my head keeps plum', And the buildin' stays in the front lot, I still kin whistle, some! But about the time the old clock Flops off'n the mantel-shelf, And the bureau skoots fer the kitchen, I'm a-goin' to skoot, myself! Plague-take! ef you keep me stabled While any earthquakes is around!â I'm jes' like the stock,âI'll beller And break fer the open ground! And I 'low you'd be as nervous And in jes' about my fix, When yer whole farm slides from inunder you, And on'y the mor'gage sticks! Now cars hain't a-goin' to kill you Ef you don't drive 'crost the track; Crediters never'll jerk you up Ef you go and pay 'em back; You kin stand all moral and mundane storms Ef you'll on'y jes' behaveâ But a' EARTHQUAKE:âWell, ef it wanted you It 'ud husk you out o' yer grave! WHEN THE WORLD BU'STS THROUGH Casually Suggested by an Earthquake Where's a boy a-goin', An' what's he goin' to do, An' how's he goin' to do it, When the world bu'sts through? Ma she says âshe can't tell What we're comin' to!â An' Pop says âhe's ist skeered Cleanâplumâthrough!â S'pose we'd be a-playin' Out in the street, An' the ground 'ud split up 'Bout forty feet!â Ma says âshe ist knows We 'ud tumble inâ; An' Pop says âhe bets you Nen we wouldn't grin!â S'pose we'd ist be 'tendin' Like we had a show, Down in the stable Where we mustn't go,â Ma says, âThe earthquake Might make it fallâ; An' Pop says, âMore'n like Swaller barn an' all!â Landy! ef we both wuz Runnin' 'way from school, Out in the shady woods Where it's all so cool!â Ma says âa big tree Might sqush our headâ; An' Pop says, âChop 'em out Bothâkilledâdead!â But where's a boy goin', An' what's he goin' to do, An' how's he goin' to do it, Ef the world bu'sts through? Ma she says âshe can't tell What we're comin' to!â An' Pop says âhe's ist skeered Cleanâplumâthrough!â THE OLD RETIRED SEA-CAPTAIN The old sea-captain has sailed the seas So long, that the waves at mirth, Or the waves gone wild, and the crests of these, Were as near playmates from birth: He has loved both the storm and the calm, because They seemed as his brothers twain,â The flapping sail was his soul's applause, And his rapture, the roaring main. But nowâlike a battered hulk seems he, Cast high on a foreign strand, Though he feels âin port,â as it need must be, And the stay of a daughter's handâ Yet ever the round of the listless hours,â His pipe, in the languid airâ The grass, the trees, and the garden flowers, And the strange earth everywhere! And so betimes he is restless here In this little inland town, With never a wing in the atmosphere But the windmill's, up and down; His daughter's home in this peaceful vale, And his grandchild 'twixt his kneesâ But never the hail of a passing sail, Nor the surge of the angry seas! He quits his pipe, and he snaps its neckâ Would speak, though he coughs instead, Then paces the porch like a quarter-deck With a reeling mast o'erhead! Ho! the old sea-captain's cheeks glow warm, And his eyes gleam grim and weird, As he mutters about, like a thunder-storm, In the cloud of his beetling beard. JIM He was jes' a plain, ever'-day, all-round kind of a jour., Consumpted-lookin'âbut la! The jokeiest, wittiest, story-tellin', song-singin', laughin'est, jolliest Feller you ever saw! Worked at jes' coarse work, but you kin bet he was fine enough in his talk, And his feelin's too! Lordy! ef he was on'y back on his bench ag'in to-day, a-carryin' on Like he ust to do! Any shopmate'll tell you there never was, on top o' dirt, A better feller'n Jim! You want a favor, and couldn't git it anywheres elseâ You could git it o' him! Most free-heartedest man thataway in the world, I guess! Give up ever' nickel he's worthâ And, ef you'd a-wanted it, and named it to him, and it was his, He'd 'a' give you the earth! Allus a-reachin' out, Jim was, and a-he'ppin' some Pore feller on to his feetâ He'd 'a' never 'a' keered how hungry he was hisse'f, So's the feller got somepin' to eat! Didn't make no differ'nce at all to him how he was dressed, He ust to say to me,â âYou togg out a tramp purty comfortable in winter-time, a-huntin' a job, And he'll git along!â says he. Jim didn't have, ner never could git ahead, so overly much O' this world's goods at a time.â 'Fore now I've saw him, more'n onc't, lend a dollar, and haf to, more'n likely, Turn round and borry a dime! Mebby laugh and joke about it hisse'f fer a whileâthen jerk his coat, And kind o' square his chin, Tie on his apern, and squat hisse'f on his old shoe-bench, And go to peggin' ag'in! Patientest feller, too, I reckon, 'at ever jes' natchurly Coughed hisse'f to death! Long enough after his voice was lost he'd laugh in a whisper and say He could git ever'thing but his breathâ âYou fellers,â he'd sort o' twinkle his eyes and say, âIs a-pilin' on to me A mighty big debt fer that-air little weak-chested ghost o' mine to pack Through all Eternity!â Now there was a man 'at jes' 'peared-like, to me, 'At ortn't 'a' never 'a' died! âBut death hain't a-showin' no favors,â the old boss saidâ âOn'y to Jim!â and cried: And Wigger, who puts up the best sewed-work in the shopâ Er the whole blame neighberhood,â He says, âWhen God made Jim, I bet you He didn't do anything else that day But jes' set around and feel good!â OLD OCTOBER Old October's purt' nigh gone, And the frosts is comin' on Little heavier every dayâ Like our hearts is thataway! Leaves is changin' overhead Back from green to gray and red, Brown and yeller, with their stems Loosenin' on the oaks and e'ms; And the balance of the trees Gittin' balder every breezeâ Like the heads we're scratchin' on! Old October's purt' nigh gone. I love Old October so, I can't bear to see her goâ Seems to me like losin' some Old-home relative er chumâ 'Pears like sort o' settin' by Some old friend 'at sigh by sigh Was a-passin' out o' sight Into everlastin' night! Hickernuts a feller hears Rattlin' down is more like tears Drappin' on the leaves belowâ I love Old October so! Can't tell what it is about Old October knocks me out!â I sleep well enough at nightâ And the blamedest appetite Ever mortal man possessed,â Last thing et, it tastes the best!â Warnuts, butternuts, pawpaws, 'Iles and limbers up my jaws Fer raal service, sich as new Pork, spareribs, and sausage, too.â Yit, fer all, they's somepin' 'bout Old October knocks me out! JUDITH O her eyes are amber-fineâ Dark and deep as wells of wine, While her smile is like the noon Splendor of a day of June. If she sorrowâlo! her face It is like a flowery space In bright meadows, overlaid With light clouds and lulled with shade. If she laughâit is the trill Of the wayward whippoorwill Over upland pastures, heard Echoed by the mocking-bird In dim thickets dense with bloom And blurred cloyings of perfume. If she sighâa zephyr swells Over odorous asphodels And wan lilies in lush plots Of moon-drown'd forget-me-nots. Then, the soft touch of her handâ Takes all breath to understand What to liken it thereto!â Never rose-leaf rinsed with dew Might slip soother-suave than slips Her slow palm, the while her lips Swoon through mine, with kiss on kiss Sweet as heated honey is. THE LEGEND GLORIFIED âI deem that God is not disquietedââ This in a mighty poet's rhymes I read; And blazoned so forever doth abide Within my soul the legend glorified. Though awful tempests thunder overhead, I deem that God is not disquieted,â The faith that trembles somewhat yet is sure Through storm and darkness of a way secure. Bleak winters, when the naked spirit hears The break of hearts, through stinging sleet of tears, I deem that God is not disquieted; Against all stresses am I clothed and fed. Nay, even with fixed eyes and broken breath, My feet dip down into the tides of death, Nor any friend be left, nor prayer be said, I deem that God is not disquieted. ON A FLY-LEAF IN JOHN BOYLE O'REILLY'S POEMS Singers there are of courtly themesâ Drapers in verseâwho would dress their rhymes In robes of ermine; and singers of dreams Of gods high-throned in the classic times; Singers of nymphs, in their dim retreats, Satyrs, with scepter and diadem; But the singer who sings as a man's heart beats Well may blush for the rest of them. I like the thrill of such poems as these,â All spirit and fervor of splendid factâ Pulse, and muscle, and arteries Of living, heroic thought and act!â Where every line is a vein of red And rapturous blood all unconfined As it leaps from a heart that has joyed and bled With the rights and the wrongs of all mankind. OLD MAN'S NURSERY RHYME In the jolly winters Of the long-ago, It was not so cold as nowâ Oh! No! No! Then, as I remember, Snowballs to eat Were as good as apples now, And every bit as sweet! In the jolly winters Of the dead-and-gone, Bub was warm as summer, With his red mitts on,â Just in his little waist- And-pants all together, Who ever heard him growl About cold weather? In the jolly winters Of the long-agoâ Was it half so cold as now? Oh! No! No! Who caught his death o' cold, Making prints of men Flat-backed in snow that now's Twice as cold again? In the jolly winters Of the dead-and-gone, Startin' out rabbit-huntin' Early as the dawn,â Who ever froze his fingers, Ears, heels, or toes,â Or'd 'a' cared if he had? Nobody knows! Nights by the kitchen stove, Shellin' white and red Corn in the skillet, and Sleepin' four abed! Ah! the jolly winters Of the long-ago! We were not as old as nowâ Oh! No! No! LEWIS D. HAYES OBIT DECEMBER 28, 1886 In the midmost glee of the Christmas And the mirth of the glad New Year, A guest has turned from the revel, And we sit in silence here. The band chimes on, yet we listen Not to the air's refrain, But over it ever we strive to catch The sound of his voice again;â For the sound of his voice was music, Dearer than any note Shook from the strands of harp-strings, Or poured from the bugle's throat.â A voice of such various ranges, His utterance rang from the height Of every rapture, down to the sobs Of every lost delight. Though he knew Man's force and his purpose, As strong as his strongest peers, He knew, as well, the kindly heart, And the tenderness of tears. So is it the face we remember Shall be always as a child's That, grieved some way to the very soul, Looks bravely up and smiles. O brave it shall look, as it looked its last On the little daughter's faceâ Pictured onlyâagainst the wall, In its old accustomed placeâ Where the last gleam of the lamplight Out of the midnight dim Yielded its grace, and the earliest dawn Gave it again to him. A LOCAL POLITICIAN FROM AWAY BACK Jedge is good at argyin'â No mistake in that! Most folks 'at tackles him He'll skin 'em like a cat! You see, the Jedge is read up, And b'en in politics, Hand-in-glove, you might say, Sence back in '56. Elected to the Shurrif, first, Then elected Clerk; Went into lawin' then, And buckled down to work; Practised three or four terms, Then he run for jedgeâ Speechified a little 'round, And went in like a wedge! Run fer Legislatur' twic'tâ Made her, ever' pop! Keeps on the way he's doin', Don't know where he'll stop! Some thinks he's got his eye On the gov'nership;â Well, ef he tuk the track, Guess he'd make the trip. But I started out to tell yeâ (Now I allus liked the manâ Not fer his politics, But social', understan'!â Fer, 's regards to my views, Political and sich,â When we come together there We're purty ap' to hitch)â Ketched him in at Knox's shop On'y t'other dayâ Gittin' shaved, the Jedge was, Er somepin' thataway.â Well, I tetched him up some On the silver bill:â Jedge says, âI won't discuss it;â I says, âYou will!â I-says-ee, âI reckon You'll concede with me, Coin's the on'y ginuine Money,â I-says-ee; Says I, âWhat's a dollar-bill?â Says I, âWhat's a tenâ Er forty-'leven hunderd of 'em?â Give us specie, then!â I seed I was a-gittin' The Jedge kind o' red Around the gills. He hawked some And cle'red his throat and saidâ âFacts is too complicated 'Bout the bill in view,â Squirmed and told the barber then He wisht he'd hurry through. 'Ll, then, I knowed I had him,â And the crowd around the fire Was all a-winkin' at me, As the barber raised him higherâ Says I, âJedge, what's a dollar?â Er a half-un,â I-says-eeâ âWhat's a quarter?âWhat's a dime?â âWhat's cents?â says he. W'y, I had him fairly b'ilin'! âYou needn't comb my hair,â He says to the barberâ âI want fresh air;â And you'd 'a' died a-laughin' To 'a' seed him grab his hat, As I-says-ee, says I, âJudge, Where you goin' at!â Jedge is good at argyin', By-and-large; and yit Beat him at his own game And he's goin' to git! And yit the Jedge is read up, And b'en in politics, Hand-in-glove, you might say, Sence back in '56. THE MUTE SINGER I The morning sun seemed fair as though It were a great red rose ablow In lavish bloom, With all the air for its perfume,â Yet he who had been wont to sing, Could trill no thing. II Supine, at noon, as he looked up Into the vast inverted cup Of heavenly gold, Brimmed with its marvels manifold, And his eye kindled, and his cheekâ Song could not speak. III Night fell forebodingly; he knew Soon must the rain be falling, too,â And, home, heartsore, A missive met him at the doorâ âThen Song lit on his lips, and he Sang gloriously. THE CYCLONE So lone I stood, the very trees seemed drawn In conference with themselves.âIntenseâintense Seemed everything;âthe summer splendor on The sight,âmagnificence! A babe's life might not lighter fail and die Than failed the sunlight.âThough the hour was noon, The palm of midnight might not lighter lie Upon the brow of June. With eyes upraised, I saw the underwings Of swallowsâgone the instant afterwardâ While from the elms there came strange twitterings, Stilled scarce ere they were heard. The river seemed to shiver; and, far down Its darkened length, I saw the sycamores Lean inward closer, under the vast frown That weighed above the shores. Then was a roar, born of some awful burst! ... And one lay, shrieking, chattering, in my pathâ Flungâhe or Iâout of some space accurst As of Jehovah's wrath: Nor barely had he wreaked his latest prayer, Ere back the noon flashed o'er the ruin done, And, o'er uprooted forests tousled there, The birds sang in the sun. IN DAYS TO COME In days to comeâwhatever ache Of age shall rack our bones, or quake Our slackened thewsâwhatever grip Rheumatic catch us i' the hip,â We, each one, for the other's sake, Will of our very wailings make Such quips of song as well may shake The spasm'd corners from the lipâ In days to come. Ho! ho! how our old hearts shall rake The past up!âhow our dry eyes slake Their sight upon the dewy drip Of juicy-ripe companionship, And blink stars from the blind opaqueâ In days to come. THE STEPMOTHER First she come to our house, Tommy run and hid; And Emily and Bob and me We cried jus' like we did When Mother died,âand we all said 'At we all wisht 'at we was dead! And Nurse she couldn't stop us; And Pa he tried and tried,â We sobbed and shook and wouldn't look, But only cried and cried; And nen some oneâwe couldn't jus' Tell whoâwas cryin' same as us! Our Stepmother! Yes, it was her, Her arms around us allâ 'Cause Tom slid down the banister And peeked in from the hall.â And we all love her, too, because She's purt' nigh good as Mother was! WHEN MY DREAMS COME TRUE I When my dreams come trueâwhen my dreams come trueâ Shall I lean from out my casement, in the starlight and the dew, To listenâsmile and listen to the tinkle of the strings Of the sweet guitar my lover's fingers fondle, as he sings? And as the nude moon slowly, slowly shoulders into view, Shall I vanish from his visionâwhen my dreams come true? When my dreams come trueâshall the simple gown I wear Be changed to softest satin, and my maiden-braided hair Be raveled into flossy mists of rarest, fairest gold, To be minted into kisses, more than any heart can hold?â Or âthe summer of my tressesâ shall my lover liken to âThe fervor of his passionââwhen my dreams come true? II When my dreams come trueâI shall bide among the sheaves Of happy harvest meadows; and the grasses and the leaves Shall lift and lean between me and the splendor of the sun, Till the noon swoons into twilight, and the gleaners' work is doneâ Save that yet an arm shall bind me, even as the reapers do The meanest sheaf of harvestâwhen my dreams come true. When my dreams come true! when my dreams come true! True love in all simplicity is fresh and pure as dew;â The blossom in the blackest mold is kindlier to the eye Than any lily born of pride that looms against the sky: And so it is I know my heart will gladly welcome you, My lowliest of lovers, when my dreams come true. THE CHANT OF THE CROSS-BEARING CHILD I bear dis cross dis many a mile. O de cross-bearin' chileâ De cross-bearin' chile! I bear dis cross 'long many a road Wha' de pink ain't bloom' an' de grass done mowed. O de cross-bearin' chileâ De cross-bearin' chile! Hit's on my conscience all dese days Fo' ter bear de cross 'ut de good Lord lays On my po' soul, an' ter lif my praise O de cross-bearin' chileâ De cross-bearin' chile! I's nigh 'bout weak ez I mos' kin be, Yit de Marstah call an' He say,ââYou's free Fo' ter 'cept dis cross, an' ter cringe yo' knee To no n'er man in de worl' but Me!â O de cross-bearin' chileâ De cross-bearin' chile! Says you guess wrong, ef I let you guessâ Says you 'spec' mo', an'-a you git less:â Says you go eas', says you go wes', An' whense you fine de road 'ut you like bes' You betteh take chice er any er de res'! O de cross-bearin' chileâ De cross-bearin' chile! He build my feet, an' He fix de signs Dat de shoe hit pinch an' de shoe hit bines Ef I on'y w'ah eights an'-a wanter w'ah nines; I hone fo' de rain, an' de sun hit shines, An' whilse I hunt de sun, hit's de rain I fines.â O-a trim my lamp, an'-a gyrd my lines! O de cross-bearin' chileâ De cross-bearin' chile! I wade de wet, an' I walk de dry: I done tromp long, an' I done clim' high; An' I pilgrim on ter de jasper sky, An' I taken de resk fo' ter cas' my eye Wha' de Gate swing wide an' de Lord draw nigh, An' de Trump hit blow, an' I hear de cry,â âYou lay dat cross down by an' by!â O de Cross-bearin' Chileâ De Cross-bearin' Chile!â THREE DEAD FRIENDS Always suddenly they are goneâ The friends we trusted and held secureâ Suddenly we are gazing on, Not a smiling face, but the marble-pure Dead mask of a face that nevermore To a smile of ours will make replyâ The lips close-locked as the eyelids are,â Goneâswift as the flash of the molten ore A meteor pours through a midnight sky, Leaving it blind of a single star. Tell us, O Death, Remorseless Might! What is this old, unescapable ire You wreak on us?âfrom the birth of light Till the world be charred to a core of fire! We do no evil thing to youâ We seek to evade youâthat is allâ That is your willâyou will not be known Of men. What, then, would you have us do?â Cringe, and wait till your vengeance fall, And your graves be fed, and the trumpet blown? You desire no friends; but weâO we Need them so, as we falter here, Fumbling through each new vacancy, As each is stricken that we hold dear. One you struck but a year ago; And one not a month ago; and oneâ (God's vast pity!)âand one lies now Where the widow wails, in her nameless woe, And the soldiers pace, with the sword and gun, Where the comrade sleeps, with the laureled brow. And what did the first?âthat wayward soul, Clothed of sorrow, yet nude of sin, And with all hearts bowed in the strange control Of the heavenly voice of his violin. Why, it was music the way he stood, So grand was the poise of the head and so Full was the figure of majesty!â One heard with the eyes, as a deaf man would, And with all sense brimmed to the overflow With tears of anguish and ecstasy. And what did the girl, with the great warm light Of genius sunning her eyes of blue, With her heart so pure, and her soul so whiteâ What, O Death, did she do to you? Through field and wood as a child she strayed, As Nature, the dear sweet mother led; While from her canvas, mirrored back, Glimmered the stream through the everglade Where the grape-vine trailed from the trees to wed Its likeness of emerald, blue and black. And what did he, who, the last of these, Faced you, with never a fear, O Death? Did you hate him that he loved the breeze, And the morning dews, and the rose's breath? Did you hate him that he answered not Your hate againâbut turned, instead, His only hate on his country's wrongs? Wellâyou possess him, dead!âbut what Of the good he wrought? With laureled head He bides with us in his deeds and songs. Laureled, first, that he bravely fought, And forged a way to our flag's release; Laureled, next, for the harp he taught To wake glad songs in the days of peaceâ Songs of the woodland haunts he held As close in his love as they held their bloom In their inmost bosoms of leaf and vineâ Songs that echoed and pulsed and welled Through the town's pent streets, and the sick child's room, Pure as a shower in soft sunshine. Claim them, Death; yet their fame endures. What friend next will you rend from us In that cold, pitiless way of yours, And leave us a grief more dolorous? Speak to us!âtell us, O Dreadful Power!â Are we to have not a lone friend left?â Since, frozen, sodden, or green the sod, In every second of every hour, Some one, Death, you have thus bereft, Half inaudibly shrieks to God. WHEN SHE COMES HOME When she comes home again! A thousand ways I fashion, to myself, the tenderness Of my glad welcome: I shall trembleâyes; And touch her, as when first in the old days I touched her girlish hand, nor dared upraise Mine eyes, such was my faint heart's sweet distress Then silence: and the perfume of her dress: The room will sway a little, and a haze Cloy eyesightâsoul-sight, evenâfor a space; And tearsâyes; and the ache here in the throat, To know that I so ill deserve the place Her arms make for me; and the sobbing note I stay with kisses, ere the tearful face Again is hidden in the old embrace. LUTHER A. TODD OBIT JULY 27, 1887, KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI Gifted, and loved and praised By every friend; Never a murmur raised Against him, to the end! With tireless interest He wrought as he thought best,â Andâlo, we bend Where now he takes his rest! His heart was loyal, to Its latest thrill, To the home-loves he knewâ And now forever will,â Mother and brotherâthey The first to pass away,â And, lingering still, The sister bowed to-day. Pure as a rose might be, And sweet, and white, His father's memory Was with him day and night:â He spoke of him, as one May now speak of the son,â Sadly and tenderly, Yet as a trump had done. Say, then, of him: He knew Full depths of care And stress of pain, and you Do him scant justice there,â Yet in the lifted face Grief left not any trace, Nor mark unfair, To mar its manly grace. It was as if each day Some new hope dawnedâ Each blessing in delay, To him, was just beyond; Between whiles, waiting, he Drew pictures cunninglyâ Fantasticâfondâ Things that we laughed to see. Sometimes, as we looked on His crayon's work, Some angel-face would dawn Out radiant, from the mirk Of features old and thin, Or jowled with double-chin, And eyes asmirk, And gaping mouths agrin. That humor in his art, Of genius born, Welled warmly from a heart That could not but adorn All things it touched with loveâ The eagle, as the doveâ The burst of mornâ The nightâthe stars above. Sometimes, amid the wild Of faces queer, A mother, with her child Pressed warm and close to her; This, I have thought, somehow, The wife, with head abow, Unreconciled, In the great shadow now. O ye of sobbing breath, Put by all sighs Of anguish at his deathâ Turnâas he turned his eyes, In that last hour, unknown In strange lands, all aloneâ Turn thine eyes toward the skies, And, smiling, cease thy moan. WHEN OLD JACK DIED When Old Jack died, we stayed from school (they said, At home, we needn't go that day), and none Of us ate any breakfastâonly one, And that was Papaâand his eyes were red When he came round where we were, by the shed Where Jack was lying, half-way in the sun And half-way in the shade. When we begun To cry out loud, Pa turned and dropped his head And went away; and Mamma, she went back Into the kitchen. Then, for a long while, All to ourselves, like, we stood there and cried. We thought so many good things of Old Jack, And funny thingsâalthough we didn't smileâ We couldn't only cry when Old Jack died. When Old Jack died, it seemed a human friend Had suddenly gone from us; that some face That we had loved to fondle and embrace From babyhood, no more would condescend To smile on us forever. We might bend With tearful eyes above him, interlace Our chubby fingers o'er him, romp and race, Plead with him, call and coaxâaye, we might send The old halloo up for him, whistle, hist, (If sobs had let us) or, as wildly vain, Snapped thumbs, called âSpeak,â and he had not replied; We might have gone down on our knees and kissed The tousled ears, and yet they must remain Deaf, motionless, we knewâwhen Old Jack died. When Old Jack died, it seemed to us, some way, That all the other dogs in town were pained With our bereavement, and some that were chained, Even, unslipped their collars on that day To visit Jack in state, as though to pay A last, sad tribute there, while neighbors craned Their heads above the high board fence, and deigned To sigh âPoor Dog!â remembering how they Had cuffed him, when alive, perchance, because, For love of them he leaped to lick their handsâ Now, that he could not, were they satisfied? We children thought that, as we crossed his paws, And o'er his grave, 'way down the bottom-lands, Wrote âOur First Love Lies Here,â when Old Jack died. WHEN THE HEARSE COMES BACK A thing 'at's 'bout as tryin' as a healthy man kin meet Is some poor feller's funeral a-joggin' 'long the street: The slow hearse and the hossesâslow enough, to say the least, Fer to even tax the patience of the gentleman deceased! The low scrunch of the gravelâand the slow grind of the wheels,â The low, slow go of ev'ry woe 'at ev'rybody feels! So I ruther like the contrast when I hear the whiplash crack A quickstep fer the hosses, When the Hearse Comes Back! Meet it goin' to'rds the cimet'ry, you'll want to drap yer eyesâ But ef the plumes don't fetch you, it'll ketch you otherwiseâ You'll haf to see the caskit, though you'd ort to look away And 'conomize and save yer sighs fer any other day! Yer sympathizin' won't wake up the sleeper from his restâ Yer tears won't thaw them hands o' his 'at's froze acrost his breast! And this is whyâwhen airth and sky's a-gittin' blurred and blackâ I like the flash and hurry When the Hearse Comes Back! It's not 'cause I don't 'preciate it ain't no time fer jokes, Ner 'cause I' got no common human feelin' fer the folks;â I've went to funerals myse'f, and tuk on some, perhapsâ Fer my heart's 'bout as mal'able as any other chap's,â I've buried father, motherâbut I'll haf to jes' git you To âexcuse me,â as the feller says.âThe p'int I'm drivin' to Is, simply, when we're plum broke down and all knocked out o' whack, It he'ps to shape us up, like, When the Hearse Comes Back! The idy! wadin' round here over shoe-mouth deep in woe, When they's a graded 'pike o' joy and sunshine, don't you know! When evening strikes the pastur', cows'll pull out fer the bars, And skittish-like from out the night'll prance the happy stars. And so when my time comes to die, and I've got ary friend 'At wants expressed my last requestâI'll, mebby, rickommend To drive slow, ef they haf to, goin' 'long the out'ard track, But I'll smile and say, âYou speed 'em When the Hearse Comes Back!â NESSMUK I hail thee, Nessmuk, for the lofty tone Yet simple grace that marks thy poetry! True forester thou art, and still to be, Even in happier fields than thou hast known. Thus, in glad visions, glimpses am I shown Of groves delectableââpreservesâ for theeâ Ranged but by friends of thineâI name thee three:â First, Chaucer, with his bald old pate new-grown With changeless laurel; next, in Lincoln-green, Gold belted, bowed and bugled, Robin Hood; And next, Ike Walton, patient and serene: These three, O Nessmuk, gathered hunter-wise, Are camped on hither slopes of Paradise, To hail thee first and greet thee, as they should. BACK FROM A TWO-YEARS' SENTENCE Back from a two-years' sentence! And though it had been ten, You think, I were scarred no deeper In the eyes of my fellow men. âMy fellow menâ?âsounds like a satire, You thinkâand I so allow, Here in my home since childhood, Yet more than a stranger now! Pardon!âNot wholly a stranger,â For I have a wife and child: That woman has wept for two long years, And yet last night she smiled!â Smiled, as I leapt from the platform Of the midnight train, and thenâ All that I knew was that smile of hers, And our babe in my arms again! Back from a two-years' sentenceâ But I've thought the whole thing through,â A hint of it came when the bars swung back And I looked straight up in the blue Of the blessed skies with my hat off! Oho! I've a wife and child: That woman has wept for two long years, And yet last night she smiled! TO ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON ON HIS FIRST VISIT TO AMERICA Robert LOUIS STEVENSON! Blue the lift and braw the dawn O' yer comin' here amang Strangers wha hae luved ye lang! Strangers tae ye we maun be, Yet tae us ye're kenned a wee By the writin's ye hae done, Robert Louis Stevenson. Syne ye've pit yer pen tae sic' Tales it stabbt us tae the quickâ Whiles o' tropic isles an' seas An' o' gowden treesuriesâ Tales o' deid men's banes; an' tales Swete as sangs o' nightingales When the nune o' mirk's begunâ Robert Louis Stevenson. Sae we hail thee! nane the less For the âburrâ that ye caress Wi' yer denty tongue o' Scots, Makin' words forget-me-nots O' yer bonnie braes that were Sung o' Burns the Poemerâ And that later lavrock, one Robert Louis Stevenson. THEM FLOWERS Take a feller 'at's sick and laid up on the shelf, All shaky, and ga'nted, and poreâ Jes' all so knocked out he can't handle hisself With a stiff upper-lip any more; Shet him up all alone in the gloom of a room As dark as the tomb, and as grim, And then take and send him some roses in bloom, And you can have fun out o' him! You've ketched him 'fore nowâwhen his liver was sound And his appetite notched like a sawâ A-mockin' you, maybe, fer romancin' round With a big posy-bunch in yer paw; But you ketch him, say, when his health is away, And he's flat on his back in distress, And then you kin trot out yer little bokay And not be insulted, I guess! You see, it's like this, what his weaknesses is,â Them flowers makes him think of the days Of his innocent youth, and that mother o' his, And the roses that she us't to raise:â So here, all alone with the roses you sendâ Bein' sick and all trimbly and faint,â My eyes isâmy eyes isâmy eyes isâold friendâ Is a-leakin'âI'm blamed ef they ain't! THE ROBINS' OTHER NAME In the Orchard-Days, when you Children look like blossoms, too; Bessie, with her jaunty ways And trim poise of head and face, Must have looked superior Even to the blossoms,âfor Little Winnie once averred Bessie looked just like the bird Tilted on the topmost spray Of the apple boughs in May, With the redbreast, and the strong, Clear, sweet warble of his song.â âI don't know their name,â Win saidâ âI ist maked a name instead.ââ So forever afterwards We called robins âBessie-birds.â THE RAIN I The rain! the rain! the rain! It gushed from the skies and streamed Like awful tears; and the sick man thought How pitiful it seemed! And he turned his face away And stared at the wall again, His hopes nigh dead and his heart worn out. O the rain! the rain! the rain! II The rain! the rain! the rain! And the broad stream brimmed the shores; And ever the river crept over the reeds And the roots of the sycamores: A corpse swirled by in a drift Where the boat had snapt its chainâ And a hoarse-voiced mother shrieked and raved. O the rain! the rain! the rain! III The rain! the rain! the rain!â Pouring, with never a pause, Over the fields and the green bywaysâ How beautiful it was! And the new-made man and wife Stood at the window-pane Like two glad children kept from school. O the rain! the rain! the rain! TO EDGAR WILSON NYE O âWilliam,â in thy blithe companionship What liberty is mineâwhat sweet release From clamorous strife, and yet what boisterous peace! Ho! ho! it is thy fancy's finger-tip That dints the dimple now, and kinks the lip That scarce may sing, in all this glad increase Of merriment! So, pray-thee, do not cease To cheer me thus;âfor, underneath the quip Of thy droll sorcery, the wrangling fret Of all distress is stilledâno syllable Of sorrow vexeth meâno tear-drops wet My teeming lids save those that leap to tell Thee thou'st a guest that overweepeth, yet Only because thou jokest overwell. A DISCOURAGING MODEL Just the airiest, fairiest slip of a thing, With a Gainsborough hat, like a butterfly's wing, Tilted up at one side with the jauntiest air, And a knot of red roses sewn in under there Where the shadows are lost in her hair. Then a cameo face, carven in on a ground Of that shadowy hair where the roses are wound; And the gleam of a smile, O as fair and as faint And as sweet as the masters of old used to paint Round the lips of their favorite saint! And that lace at her throatâand the fluttering hands Snowing there, with a grace that no art understands, The flakes of their touchesâfirst fluttering at The bowâthen the rosesâthe hairâand then that Little tilt of the Gainsborough hat. Ah, what artist on earth with a model like this, Holding not on his palette the tint of a kiss, Nor a pigment to hint of the hue of her hair Nor the gold of her smileâO what artist could dare To expect a result half so fair? THE SERENADE The midnight is not more bewildering To her drowsed eyes, than, to her ears, the sound Of dim, sweet singing voices, interwound With purl of flute and subtle twang of string, Strained through the lattice, where the roses cling And, with their fragrance, waft the notes around Her haunted senses. Thirsting beyond bound Of her slow-yielding dreams, the lilt and swing Of the mysterious, delirious tune, She drains like some strange opiate, with awed eyes Upraised against her casement, where, aswoon, The stars fail from her sight, and up the skies Of alien azure rolls the full round moon Like some vast bubble blown of summer noon. DOC SIFERS Of all the doctors I could cite you to in this-'ere town Doc Sifers is my favorite, jes' take him up and down! Count in the Bethel Neighberhood, and Rollins, and Big Bear, And Sifers' standin' jes' as good as ary doctor's there! There's old Doc Wick, and Glenn, and Hall, and Wurgler, and McVeigh, But I'll buck Sifers 'g'inst 'em all and down 'em any day! Most old Wick ever knowed, I s'pose, was whisky! Wurglerâwell, He et morphineâef actions shows, and facts' reliable! But Sifersâthough he ain't no sot, he's got his faults; and yit When you git Sifers onc't, you've got a doctor, don't fergit! He ain't much at his office, er his house, er anywhere You'd natchurly think certain fer to ketch the feller there.â But don't blame Doc: he's got all sorts o' cur'ous notionsâas The feller says, his odd-come-shorts, like smart men mostly has. He'll more'n like be potter'n' 'round the Blacksmith Shop; er in Some back lot, spadin' up the ground, er gradin' it ag'in. Er at the work bench, planin' things; er buildin' little traps To ketch birds; galvenizin' rings; er graftin' plums, perhaps. Make anything! good as the best!âa gun-stockâer a flute; He whittled out a set o' chesstmen onc't o' laurel root. Durin' the Armyâgot his trade o' surgeon thereâI own To-day a finger-ring Doc made out of a Sesesh bone! An' glued a fiddle onc't fer meâjes' all so busted you 'D 'a' throwed the thing away, but he fixed her as good as new! And take Doc, now, in ager, say, er biles, er rheumatiz, And all afflictions thataway, and he's the best they is! Er jandersâmilksickâI don't keerâk-yore anything he triesâ A abscess; getherin' in yer yeer; er granilated eyes! There was the Widder Daubenspeck they all give up fer dead; A blame cowbuncle on her neck, and clean out of her head! First had this doctor, what's-his-name, from âPudblesburg,â and then This little red-head, âBurnin' Shameâ they call himâDr. Glenn. And they âconsultedâ on the case, and claimed she'd haf to die,â I jes' was joggin' by the place, and heerd her dorter cry, And stops and calls her to the fence; and I-says-I, âLet me Send Sifersâbet you fifteen cents he'll k-yore her!â âWell,â says she, âLight out!â she says: And, lipp-tee-cut, I loped in town, and rid 'Bout two hours more to find him, but I kussed him when I did! He was down at the Gunsmith Shop a-stuffin' birds! Says he, âMy sulky's broke.â Says I, âYou hop right on and ride with me!â I got him there.ââWell, Aunty, ten days k'yores you,â Sifers said, âBut what's yer idy livin' when yer jes' as good as dead?â And there's Dave Banksâjes' back from war without a scratchâone day Got ketched up in a sickle-bar, a reaper runaway.â His shoulders, arms, and hands and legs jes' sawed in strips! And Jake Dunn starts fer Sifersâfeller begs to shoot him fer God-sake. Doc, 'course, was gone, but he had penned the notice, âAt Big Bearâ Be back to-morry; Gone to 'tend the Bee Convention there.â But Jake, he tracked himârid and rode the whole endurin' night! And 'bout the time the roosters crowed they both hove into sight. Doc had to ampitate, but 'greed to save Dave's arms, and swore He could 'a' saved his legs ef he'd b'en there the day before. Like when his wife's own mother died 'fore Sifers could be found, And all the neighbers fer and wide a' all jes' chasin' round; Tel finallyâI had to laughâit's jes' like Doc, you know,â Was learnin' fer to telegraph, down at the old deepo. But all they're faultin' Sifers fer, there's none of 'em kin say He's biggoty, er keerless, er not posted any way; He ain't built on the common plan of doctors nowadays, He's jes' a great, big, brainy manâthat's where the trouble lays! AFTERWHILES Where are theyâthe Afterwhilesâ Luring us the lengthening miles Of our lives? Where is the dawn With the dew across the lawn Stroked with eager feet the far Way the hills and valleys are? Where the sun that smites the frown Of the eastward-gazer down? Where the rifted wreaths of mist O'er us, tinged with amethyst, Round the mountain's steep defiles? Where are all the afterwhiles? Afterwhileâand we will go Thither, yon, and to and froâ From the stifling city streets To the country's cool retreatsâ From the riot to the rest Where hearts beat the placidest: Afterwhile, and we will fall Under breezy trees, and loll In the shade, with thirsty sight Drinking deep the blue delight Of the skies that will beguile Us as childrenâafterwhile. Afterwhileâand one intends To be gentler to his friends,â To walk with them, in the hush Of still evenings, o'er the plush Of home-leading fields, and stand Long at parting, hand in hand: One, in time, will joy to take New resolves for some one's sake, And wear then the look that lies Clear and pure in other eyesâ He will soothe and reconcile His own conscienceâafterwhile. Afterwhileâwe have in view A far scene to journey to,â Where the old home is, and where The old mother waits us there, Peering, as the time grows late, Down the old path to the gate.â How we'll click the latch that locks In the pinks and hollyhocks, And leap up the path once more Where she waits us at the door!â How we'll greet the dear old smile, And the warm tearsâafterwhile! Ah, the endless afterwhiles!â Leagues on leagues, and miles on miles, In the distance far withdrawn, Stretching on, and on, and on, Till the fancy is footsore And faints in the dust before The last milestone's granite face, Hacked with: Here Beginneth Space. O far glimmering worlds and wings, Mystic smiles and beckonings, Lead us through the shadowy aisles, Out into the afterwhiles. A HOME-MADE FAIRY TALE Bud, come here to your uncle a spell, And I'll tell you something you mustn't tellâ For it's a secret and shore-'nuf true, And maybe I oughtn't to tell it to you!â But out in the garden, under the shade Of the apple trees, where we romped and played Till the moon was up, and you thought I'd gone Fast asleep,âThat was all put on! For I was a-watchin' something queer Goin' on there in the grass, my dear!â 'Way down deep in it, there I see A little dude-Fairy who winked at me, And snapped his fingers, and laughed as low And fine as the whine of a mus-kee-to! I kept stillâwatchin' him closerâand I noticed a little guitar in his hand, Which he leant 'g'inst a little dead beeâand laid His cigarette down on a clean grass-blade, And then climbed up on the shell of a snailâ Carefully dusting his swallowtailâ And pulling up, by a waxed web-thread, This little guitar, you remember, I said! And there he trinkled and trilled a tune,â âMy Love, so Fair, Tans in the Moon!â Till, presently, out of the clover-top He seemed to be singing to, came, k'pop! The purtiest, daintiest Fairy face In all this world, or any place! Then the little ser'nader waved his hand, As much as to say, âWe'll excuse you!â and I heard, as I squinted my eyelids to, A kiss like the drip of a drop of dew! A VOICE FROM THE FARM It is my dream to have you here with me, Out of the heated city's dust and dinâ Here where the colts have room to gambol in, And kine to graze, in clover to the knee. I want to see your wan face happily Lit with the wholesome smiles that have not been In use since the old games you used to win When we pitched horseshoes: And I want to be At utter loaf with you in this dim land Of grove and meadow, while the crickets make Our own talk tedious, and the bat wields His bulky flight, as we cease converse and In a dusk like velvet smoothly take Our way toward home across the dewy fields. THE OLD HOME BY THE MILL This is âThe old Home by the Millââfer we still call it so, Although the old mill, roof and sill, is all gone long ago. The old home, though, and the old folksâthe old spring, and a few Old cattails, weeds and hartychokes, is left to welcome you! Here, Marg'et!âfetch the man a tin to drink out of! Our spring Keeps kindo'-sorto' cavin' in, but don't âtasteâ anything! She's kindo' agin', Marg'et isââthe old processââlike me, All ham-stringed up with rhumatiz, and on in seventy-three. Jest me and Marg'et lives alone hereâlike in long ago; The childern all putt off and gone, and married, don't you know? One's millin' 'way out West somewhare; two other miller-boys In Minnyopolis they air; and one's in Illinoise. The oldest gyrlâthe first that wentâmarried and died right here; The next lives in Winn's Settlementâfer purt' nigh thirty year! And youngest oneâwas allus fer the old home hereâbut no!â Her man turns in and he packs her 'way off to Idyho! I don't miss them like Marg'et doesâ'cause I got her, you see; And when she pines for themâthat's 'cause she's only jest got me! I laugh, and joke her 'bout it all.âBut talkin' sense, I'll say, When she was tuk so bad last Fall, I laughed then t'other way! I hain't so favor'ble impressed 'bout dyin'; but ef I Found I was only second-best when us two come to die, I'd 'dopt the ânew process,â in full, ef Marg'et died, you see,â I'd jest crawl in my grave and pull the green grass over me! THE OLD MAN AND JIM Old man never had much to sayâ 'Ceptin' to Jim,â And Jim was the wildest boy he hadâ And the old man jes' wrapped up in him! Never heerd him speak but once Er twice in my life,âand first time was When the army broke out, and Jim he went, The old man backin' him, fer three months; And all 'at I heerd the old man say Was, jes' as we turned to start away,â âWell, good-by, Jim: Take keer of yourse'f!â 'Peared-like, he was more satisfied Jes' lookin' at Jim And likin' him all to hisse'f-like, see?â 'Cause he was jes' wrapped up in him! And over and over I mind the day The old man come and stood round in the way While we was drillin', a-watchin' Jimâ And down at the deepot a-heerin' him say, âWell, good-by, Jim: Take keer of yourse'f!â Never was nothin' about the farm Disting'ished Jim; Neighbors all ust to wonder why The old man 'peared wrapped up in him: But when Cap. Biggler he writ back 'At Jim was the bravest boy we had In the whole dern rigiment, white er black, And his fightin' good as his farmin' badâ 'At he had led, with a bullet clean Bored through his thigh, and carried the flag Through the bloodiest battle you ever seen,â The old man wound up a letter to him 'At Cap. read to us, 'at said: âTell Jim Good-by, And take keer of hisse'f!â Jim come home jes' long enough To take the whim 'At he'd like to go back in the calveryâ And the old man jes' wrapped up in him! Jim 'lowed 'at he'd had sich luck afore, Guessed he'd tackle her three years more. And the old man give him a colt he'd raised, And follered him over to Camp Ben Wade, And laid around fer a week er so, Watchin' Jim on dress-paradeâ Tel finally he rid away, And last he heerd was the old man say,â âWell, good-by, Jim: Take keer of yourse'f!â Tuk the papers, the old man did, A-watchin' fer Jimâ Fully believin' he'd make his mark Some wayâjes' wrapped up in him!â And many a time the word 'u'd come 'At stirred him up like the tap of a drumâ At Petersburg, fer instunce, where Jim rid right into their cannons there, And tuk 'em, and p'inted 'em t'other way, And socked it home to the boys in gray, As they scooted fer timber, and on and onâ Jim a lieutenant and one arm gone, And the old man's words in his mind all day,â âWell, good-by, Jim: Take keer of yourse'f!â Think of a private, now, perhaps, We'll say like Jim, 'At's clumb clean up to the shoulder-strapsâ And the old man jes' wrapped up in him! Think of himâwith the war plum' through, And the glorious old Red-White-and-Blue A-laughin' the news down over Jim, And the old man, bendin' over himâ The surgeon turnin' away with tears 'At hadn't leaked fer years and years, As the hand of the dyin' boy clung to His father's, the old voice in his ears,â âWell, good-by, Jim: Take keer of yourse'f!â OUR OLD FRIEND NEVERFAIL O it's good to ketch a relative 'at's richer and don't run When you holler out to hold up, and'll joke and have his fun; It's good to hear a man called bad and then find out he's not, Er strike some chap they call lukewarm 'at's really red-hot; It's good to know the Devil's painted jes' a leetle black, And it's good to have most anybody pat you on the back;â But jes' the best thing in the world's our old friend Neverfail, When he wags yer hand as honest as an old dog wags his tail! I like to strike the man I owe the same time I can pay, And take back things I've borried, and su'prise folks thataway; I like to find out that the man I voted fer last fall, That didn't git elected, was a scoundrel after all; I like the man that likes the pore and he'ps 'em when he can; I like to meet a ragged tramp 'at's still a gentleman; But most I likeâwith you, my boyâour old friend Neverfail, When he wags yer hand as honest as an old dog wags his tail! DAN O'SULLIVAN Dan O'SULLIVAN: It's your Lips have kissed âThe Blarney,â sure!â To be trillin' praise av me, Dhrippin' swhate wid poethry!â Not that I'd not have ye singâ Don't lave off for anythingâ Jusht be aisy whilst the fit Av me head shwells up to it! Dade and thrue, I'm not the man, Whilst yer singin', loike ye can, To cry shtop because ye've blesht My songs more than all the resht:â I'll not be the b'y to ax Any shtar to wane or wax, Or ax any clock that's woun' To run up inshtid av down! Whist yez! Dan O'Sullivan!â Him that made the Irishman Mixt the birds in wid the dough, And the dew and mistletoe Wid the whusky in the quare Muggs av usâand here we air, Three parts right, and three parts wrong, Shpiked wid beauty, wit and song! AT âTHE LITERARYâ Folks in town, I reckon, thinks They git all the fun they air Runnin' loose 'round!âbut, 'y jinks! We' got fun, and fun to spare, Right out here amongst the ash And oak timber ever'where! Some folks else kin cut a dash 'Sides town-people, don't fergit!â 'Specially in winter-time, When they's snow, and roads is fit. In them circumstances I'm Resig-nated to my lotâ Which putts me in mind o' what 'S called âThe Literary.â Us folks in the country sees Lots o' fun!âTake spellin'-school; Er ole hoe-down jamborees; Er revivals; er ef you'll Tackle taffy-pullin's you Kin git fun, and quite a few!â Same with huskin's.

But I'll tell you what I jest Think walks over all the restâ Anyway it suits me best,â That's âThe Literary.â First they started itââ'y gee!â Thinks-says-I, âthis settle-ment 'S gittin' too high-toned fer me!â But when all begin to jine, And I heerd Izory went, I jest kind o' drapped in line, Like you've seen some sandy, thin, Scrawny shoat putt fer the crick Down some pig-trail through the thick Spice-bresh, where the whole drove's been 'Bout six weeks 'fore he gits in!â âCan't tell nothin',â I-says-ee, â'Bout it tel you go and see Their blame âLiteraryâ!â Very first night I was there I was 'p'inted to be what They call âCriticââso's a fair And square jedgment could be got On the pieces 'at was read, And on the debate,ââWhich air Most destructive element, Fire er worter?â Then they hed Compositions on âContent,â âDeath,â and âBotanyâ; and Tomps He read one on âDreenin' Swampsâ I p'nounced the boss, and said, âSo fur, 'at's the best thing read In yer âLiteraryâ!â Then they sung someâtel I called Order, and got back ag'in In the critic's cheer, and hauled All o' the p'formers in:â Mandy Brizendine read one I fergit; and Doc's was âThoughtâ; And Sarepty's, hern was âNone Air Denied 'at Knocksâ; and Dautâ Fayette Strawnse's little nieceâ She got up and spoke a piece: Then Izory she read hernâ âBest thing in the whole concern,â I-says-ee; ânow le' 's adjourn This-here âLiteraryâ!â They was some contendin'âyit We broke up in harmony. Road outside as white as grit, And as slick as slick could be!â I'd fetched 'Zory in my sleigh,â And I had a heap to say, Drivin' backâin fact, I driv 'Way around the old north way, Where the Daubenspeckses live. 'Zory allusâ'fore that nightâ Never 'peared to feel jest right In my company.âYou see, On'y thing on earth saved me Was that âLiteraryâ! SHE âDISPLAINSâ IT âHad, too!â âHadn't, neither!â So contended Bess and Mayâ Neighbor children, who were boasting Of their grandmammas, one day. âHad, too!â âHadn't, neither!â All the difference begun By May's saying she'd two grandmasâ While poor Bess had only one. âHad, too!â âHadn't, neither!â Tossing curls, and kinks of friz!â âHow could you have two gran'muvvers When ist one is all they is?â âHad, too!â âHadn't, neither!â 'Cause ef you had two,â said Bess, âYou'd displain it!â Then May answered, âMy gran'mas wuz twins, I guess!â DEAD, MY LORDS Dead, my lords and gentlemen!â Stilled the tongue, and stayed the pen; Cheek unflushed and eye unlitâ Done with life, and glad of it. Curb your praises now as then: Dead, my lords and gentlemen.â What he wrought found its reward In the tolerance of the Lord. Ye who fain had barred his path, Dread ye now this look he hath?â Dead, my lords and gentlemenâ Dare yet not smile back again? Low he lies, yet high and great Looms he, lying thus in state.â How exalted o'er ye when Dead, my lords and gentlemen! A MAN BY THE NAME OF BOLUS A man by the name of Bolusâ(all 'at we'll ever know Of the stranger's name, I reckonâand I'm kind o' glad it's so!)â Got off here, Christmas morning, looked 'round the town, and then Kind o' sized up the folks, I guess, andâwent away again! The fac's is, this man Bolus got ârun in,â Christmas-day; The town turned out to see it, and cheered, and blocked the way; And they dragged him 'fore the Mayorâfer he couldn't er wouldn't walkâ And socked him down fer trialâthough he couldn't er wouldn't talk! Drunk? They was no doubt of it!âW'y, the marshal of the town Laughed and testified 'at he fell up-stairs 'stid o' down! This man by the name of Bolus?âW'y, he even drapped his jaw And snored on through his âhearin'ââdrunk as you ever saw! One feller spit in his boot-leg, and another 'n' drapped a small Little chunk o' ice down his collar,âbut he didn't wake at all! And they all nearly split when his Honor said, in one of his witty ways, To âchalk it down fer him, âCalled awayâbe back in thirty days!ââ That's where this man named Bolus slid, kind o' like in a fit, Flat on the floor; andâdrat my ears! I hear 'em a-laughin' yit! Somebody fetched Doc Sifers from jes' acrost the hallâ And all Doc said was, âMorphine! We're too late!â and that's all! That's how they found his name outâpiece of a letter 'at read: âYour wife has lost her reason, and little Nathan's deadâ Come ef you kin,âfergive herâbut, Bolus, as fer me, This hour I send a bullet through where my heart ort to be!â Man by the name of Bolus!âAs his revilers broke Fer the open air, 'peared-like, to me, I heerd a voice 'at spokeâ Man by the name of Bolus! git up from where you layâ Git up and smile white at 'em, with your hands crossed thataway! THE TRAVELING MAN I Could I pour out the nectar the gods only can, I would fill up my glass to the brim And drink the success of the Traveling Man, And the house represented by him; And could I but tincture the glorious draught With his smiles, as I drank to him then, And the jokes he has told and the laughs he has laughed, I would fill up the goblet againâ And drink to the sweetheart who gave him good-by With a tenderness thrilling him this Very hour, as he thinks of the tear in her eye That salted the sweet of her kiss; To her truest of hearts and her fairest of hands I would drink, with all serious prayers, Since the heart she must trust is a Traveling Man's, And as warm as the ulster he wears. II I would drink to the wife, with the babe on her knee, Who awaits his returning in vainâ Who breaks his brave letters so tremulously And reads them again and again! And I'd drink to the feeble old mother who sits At the warm fireside of her son And murmurs and weeps o'er the stocking she knits, As she thinks of the wandering one. I would drink a long life and a health to the friends Who have met him with smiles and with cheerâ To the generous hand that the landlord extends To the wayfarer journeying here: And I pledge, when he turns from this earthly abode And pays the last fare that he can, Mine Host of the Inn at the End of the Road Will welcome the Traveling Man! THE ABSENCE OF LITTLE WESLEY Sence little Wesley went, the place seems all so strange and stillâ W'y, I miss his yell o' âGran-pap!â as I'd miss the whipperwill! And to think I ust to scold him fer his everlastin' noise, When I on'y rickollect him as the best o' little boys! I wisht a hundred times a day 'at he'd come trompin' in, And all the noise he ever made was twic't as loud ag'in!â It 'u'd seem like some soft music played on some fine insturment, 'Longside o' this loud lonesomeness, sence little Wesley went! Of course the clock don't tick no louder than it ust to doâ Yit now they's times it 'pears like it 'u'd bu'st itse'f in two! And let a rooster, suddent-like, crow som'ers clos't around, And seems's ef, mighty nigh it, it 'u'd lift me off the ground! And same with all the cattle when they bawl around the bars, In the red o' airly morning, er the dusk and dew and stars, When the neighbers' boys 'at passes never stop, but jes' go on, A-whistlin' kind o' to theirse'v'sâsence little Wesley's gone! And then, o' nights, when Mother's settin' up on-common late, A-bilin' pears er somepin', and I set and smoke and wait, Tel the moon out through the winder don't look bigger'n a dime, And things keeps gittin' stillerâstillerâstiller all the time,â I've ketched myse'f a-wishin' likeâas I clumb on the cheer To wind the clock, as I hev done fer more'n fifty yearâ A-wishin' 'at the time hed come fer us to go to bed, With our last prayers, and our last tears, sence little Wesley's dead! WHEN THE GREEN GITS BACK IN THE TREES In spring, when the green gits back in the trees, And the sun comes out and stays, And yer boots pulls on with a good tight squeeze, And you think of yer barefoot days; When you ort to work and you want to not, And you and yer wife agrees It's time to spade up the garden-lot, When the green gits back in the treesâ Well! work is the least o' my idees When the green, you know, gits back in the trees! When the green gits back in the trees, and bees Is a-buzzin' aroun' ag'in In that kind of a lazy go-as-you-please Old gait they bum roun' in; When the groun's all bald whare the hay-rick stood, And the crick's riz, and the breeze Coaxes the bloom in the old dogwood, And the green gits back in the trees,â I like, as I say, in sich scenes as these, The time when the green gits back in the trees! When the whole tail-fethers o' Winter-time Is all pulled out and gone! And the sap it thaws and begins to climb, And the swet it starts out on A feller's forred, a-gittin' down At the old spring on his kneesâ I kindo' like jest a-loaferin' roun' When the green gits back in the treesâ Jest a-potterin' roun' as Iâdurnâpleaseâ When the green, you know, gits back in the trees! HOW IT HAPPENED I got to thinkin' of herâboth her parunts dead and goneâ And all her sisters married off, and none but her and John A-livin' all alone thare in that lonesome sorto' way, And him a blame' old bachelor, confirm'der ev'ry day! I'd knowed 'em all, from childern, and theyr daddy from the time He settled in the neghborhood, and hadn't ary a dime Er dollar, when he married, fer to start housekeepin' on!â So I got to thinkin' of herâboth her parunts dead and gone! I got to thinkin' of her; and a-wundern what she done That all her sisters kep' a-gittin' married, one by one, And her without no chancesâand the best girl of the packâ A' old maid, with her hands, you might say, tied behind her back! And Mother, too, afore she died,âshe ust to jest take on, When none of 'em wuz left, you know, but Evaline and John, And jest declare to goodness 'at the young men must be bline To not see what a wife they'd git ef they got Evaline! I got to thinkin' of her: In my great affliction she Wuz sich a comfert to us, and so kind and neghborly,â She'd come, and leave her housework, fer to he'p out little Jane, And talk of her own mother 'at she'd never see againâ They'd sometimes cry togetherâthough, fer the most part, she Would have the child so rickonciled and happy-like 'at we Felt lonesomer'n ever when she'd putt her bonnet on And say she'd railly haf to be-gittin' back to John! I got to thinkin' of her, as I say,âand more and more I'd think of her dependence, and the burdens 'at she bore,â Her parunts both a-bein' dead, and all her sisters gone And married off, and her a-livin' thare alone with Johnâ You might say jest a-toilin' and a-slavin' out her life Fer a man 'at hadn't pride enugh to git hisse'f a wifeâ 'Less some one married Evaline and packed her off some day!â So I got to thinkin' of herâandâIt happened thataway.

THE WIFE-BLESSED In youth he wrought, with eyes ablur, Lorn-faced and long of hairâ In youthâin youth he painted her A sister of the airâ Could clasp her not, but felt the stir Of pinions everywhere. She lured his gaze, in braver days, And tranced him siren-wise; And he did paint her, through a haze Of sullen paradise, With scars of kisses on her face And embers in her eyes. And nowânor dream nor wild conceitâ Though faltering, as beforeâ Through tears he paints her, as is meet, Tracing the dear face o'er With lilied patience meek and sweet As Mother Mary wore. ROBERT BURNS WILSON What intuition named thee?âThrough what thrill Of the awed soul came the command divine Into the mother-heart, foretelling thine Should palpitate with his whose raptures will Sing on while daisies bloom and lavrocks trill Their undulating ways up through the fine Fair mists of heavenly reaches? Thy pure line Falls as the dew of anthems, quiring still The sweeter since the Scottish singer raised His voice therein, and, quit of every stress Of earthly ache and longing and despair, Knew certainly each simple thing he praised Was no less worthy, for its lowliness, Than any joy of all the glory There. 'MONGST THE HILLS O' SOMERSET 'Mongst the Hills' o' Somerset Wisht I was a-roamin' yet! My feet won't get usen to These low lands I'm trompin' through. Wisht I could go back there, and Stroke the long grass with my hand, Kind o' like my sweetheart's hair Smoothed out underneath it there! Wisht I could set eyes once more On our shadders, on before, Climbin', in the airly dawn, Up the slopes 'at love growed on Natchurl as the violet 'Mongst the Hills o' Somerset! How 't 'u'd rest a man like me Jes' fer 'bout an hour to be Up there where the morning air Could reach out and ketch me there!â Snatch my breath away, and then Rensh and give it back again Fresh as dew, and smellin' of The old pinks I ust to love, And a-flavor'n' ever' breeze With mixt hints o' mulberries And May-apples, from the thick Bottom-lands along the crick Where the fish bit, dry er wet, 'Mongst the Hills o' Somerset! Like a livin' pictur' things All comes back: the bluebird swings In the maple, tongue and bill Trillin' glory fit to kill! In the orchard, jay and bee Ripens the first pears fer me, And the âPrince's Harvestâ they Tumble to me where I lay In the clover, provin' still âA boy's will is the wind's will.â Clean fergot is time, and care, And thick hearin', and gray hairâ But they's nothin' I ferget 'Mongst the Hills o' Somerset! Middle-agedâto be edzact, Very middle-aged, in fact, Yet a-thinkin' back to then, I'm the same wild boy again! There's the dear old home once more, And there's Mother at the doorâ Dead, I know, fer thirty year', Yet she's singin', and I hear; And there's Jo, and Mary Jane, And Pap, comin' up the lane! Dusk's a-fallin'; and the dew, 'Pears like, it's a-fallin' tooâ Dreamin' we're all livin' yet 'Mongst the Hills o' Somerset! A PASSING HAIL Let us rest ourselves a bit! Worry?âWave your hand to itâ Kiss your finger-tips and smile It farewell a little while. Weary of the weary way We have come from Yesterday, Let us fret us not, instead, Of the weary way ahead. Let us pause and catch our breath On the hither side of death, While we see the tender shoots Of the grassesânot the roots,â While we yet look downânot upâ To seek out the buttercup And the daisy where they wave O'er the green home of the grave. Let us launch us smoothly on The soft billows of the lawn, And drift out across the main Of our childish dreams again: Voyage off, beneath the trees, O'er the field's enchanted seas, Where the lilies are our sails, And our sea-gulls, nightingales: Where no wilder storm shall beat Than the wind that waves the wheat, And no tempest-burst above The old laughs we used to love: Lose all troublesâgain release, Languor, and exceeding peace, Cruising idly o'er the vast, Calm mid-ocean of the Past. Let us rest ourselves a bit! Worry?âwave your hand to itâ Kiss your finger-tips, and smile It farewell a little while. âLAST CHRISTMAS WAS A YEAR AGOâ The Old Lady Speaks Last Christmas was a year ago, Says I to David, I-says-I, âWe're goin' to morning-service, so You hitch up right away: I'll try To tell the girls jes' what to do Fer dinner.âWe'll be back by two.â I didn't wait to hear what he Would more'n like say back to me, But banged the stable door and flew Back to the house, jes' plumb chilled through. Cold! Wooh! how cold it was! My-oh! Frost flyin', and the air, you know, âJes' sharp enough,â heerd David swear, âTo shave a man and cut his hair!â And blow and blow! and snow and snow!â Where it had drifted 'long the fence And 'crost the road,âsome places, though, Jes' swep' clean to the gravel, so The goin' was as bad fer sleighs As 'twas fer wagons,âand both ways, 'Twixt snow-drifts and the bare ground, I've Jes' wundered we got thought alive; I hain't saw nothin', 'fore er sence, 'At beat it anywheres, I knowâ Last Christmas was a year ago. And David said, as we set out, 'At Christmas services was 'bout As cold and wuthless kind o' love To offer up as he knowed of; And as fer him, he railly thought 'At the Good Bein' up above Would think more of usâas He oughtâ A-stayin' home on sich a day, And thankin' of Him thataway! And jawed on, in a' undertone, 'Bout leavin' Lide and Jane alone There on the place, and me not there To oversee 'em, and p'pare The stuffin' fer the turkey, and The sass and all, you understand. I've allus managed David by Jes' sayin' nothin'. That was why He'd chased Lide's beau awayâ'cause Lide She'd allus take up Perry's side When David tackled him; and so, Last Christmas was a year ago,â Er ruther, 'bouta week afore,â David and Perry'd quarr'l'd about Some tom-fool argyment, you know, And Pap told him to âJes' git out O' there, and not to come no more, And, when he went, to shet the door!â And as he passed the winder, we Saw Perry, white as white could be, March past, onhitch his hoss, and light A see-gyar, and lope out o' sight. Then Lide she come to me and cried! And I said nothin'âwas no need. And yit, you know, that man jes' got Right out o' there's ef he'd be'n shot, P'tendin' he must go and feed The stock er somepin'. Then I tried To git the pore girl pacified. But, gittin' back toâwhere was we?â Oh, yes!âwhere David lectered me All way to meetin', high and low, Last Christmas was a year ago: Fer all the awful cold, they was A fair attendunce; mostly, though, The crowd was round the stoves, you see, Thawin' their heels and scrougin' us. Ef 't 'adn't be'n fer the old Squire Givin' his seat to us, as in We stomped, a-fairly perishin', And David could 'a' got no fire, He'd jes' 'a' drapped there in his tracks: And Squire, as I was tryin' to yit Make room fer him, says, âNo; the fac's Is, I got to git up and git 'Ithout no preachin'. Jes' got wordâ Trial fer lifeâcan't be deferred!â And out he putt! ...... And all way through The sermontâand a long one, tooâ I couldn't he'p but think o' Squire And us changed round so, and admire His gintle ways,âto give his warm Bench up, and have to face the storm. And when I noticed David he Was needin' jabbin'âI thought best To kind o' sort o' let him rest: 'Peared-like he slep' so peacefully! And then I thought o' home, and how And what the gyrls was doin' now, And kind o' prayed, 'way in my breast, And breshed away a tear er two As David waked, and church was through. By time we'd âhowdyedâ round and shuck Hands with the neighbers, must 'a' tuck A half-hour longer: ever' one A-sayin' âChristmas gift!â afore David er meâso we got none! But David warmed up, more and more, And got so jokey-like, and had His sperits up, and 'peared so glad, I whispered to him, âS'pose you ast A passel of 'em come and eat Their dinners with us. Gyrls's got A full-and-plenty fer the lot And all their kin!â So David passed The invite round: and ever' seat In ever' wagon-bed and sleigh Was jes' packed, as we rode away,â The young folks, mil'd er so along, A-strikin' up a sleighin'-song, Tel David laughed and yelled, you know, And jes' whirped up and sent the snow And gravel flyin' thick and fastâ Last Christmas was a year ago. W'y, that-air seven-mil'd ja'nt we comeâ Jes' seven mil'd scant from church to homeâ It didn't 'pear, that day, to be Much furder railly 'n 'bout three! But I was purty squeamish by The time home hove in sight and I See two vehickles standin' there Already. So says I, âPrepare!â All to myse'f. And presently David he sobered; and says he, âHain't that-air Squire Hanch's old Buggy,â he says, âand claybank mare?â Says I, âLe' 's git in out the coldâ Your company's nigh 'bout froze!â He says, âWhose sleigh's that-air, a-standin' there?â Says I, âIt's no odds whoseâyou jes' Drive to the house and let us out, 'Cause we're jes' freezin', nigh about!â Well, David swung up to the door, And out we piled. And first I heerd Jane's voice, then Lide's,âI thought afore I reached that gyrl I'd jes' die, shore; And when I reached her, wouldn't keered Much ef I had, I was so glad, A-kissin' her through my green veil, And jes' excitin' her so bad, 'At she broke down herse'fâand Jane, She criedâand we all hugged again. And David?âDavid jes' turned pale!â Looked at the gyrls, and then at me, Then at the open doorâand thenâ âIs old Squire Hanch in there?â says he. The old Squire suddently stood in The doorway, with a sneakin' grin. âIs Perry Anders in there, too?â Says David, limberin' all through, As Lide and me both grabbed him, and Perry stepped out and waved his hand And says, âYes, Pap.â And David jes' Stooped and kissed Lide, and says, âI guess Yer mother's much to blame as you. Ef she kin rest him, I kin too!â The dinner we had then hain't no Bit better'n the one to-day 'At we'll have fer 'em! Hear some sleigh A-jinglin' now. David, fer me, I wish you'd jes' go out and see Ef they're in sight yit. It jes' does Me good to think, in times like these, Lide's done so well. And David he's More tractabler'n what he was, Last Christmas was a year ago. LITTLE JOHNTS'S CHRIS'MUS We got it up a-purpose, jes' fer little Johnts, you know; His mother was so pore an' all, an' had to manage so.â Jes' bein' a War-widder, an' her pension mighty slim, She'd take in weavin', er work out, er anything fer him! An' little Johnts was puny-likeâbut, law the nerve he had!â You'd want to kind o' pity him, but couldn't, very bad,â His pants o' army-blanket an' his coat o' faded blue Kep' hintin' of his father like, an' pity wouldn't do! So we collogued together onc't, one winter-time, 'at weâ Jes' me an' Mother an' the girls, and Wilse, John-Jack an' Freeâ Would jine and git up little Johnts, by time 'at Chris'mus come, Some sort o' doin's, don't you know, 'at would su'prise him some. An' so, all on the quiet, Mother she turns in an' gits Some blue-janesâcuts an' makes a suit; an' then sets down and knits A pair o' little galluses to go 'long with the restâ An' putts in a red-flannen back an' buckle on the vest.â The little feller'd be'n so much around our house, you see, An' be'n sich he'p to her an' all, an' handy as could be, 'At Mother couldn't do too much fer little JohntsâNo, sir! She ust to jes' declare 'at âhe was meat-an'-drink to her!â An' Piney, Lide, an' Madeline they watch their chance an' rid To Fountaintown with Lijey's folks; an' bought a book, they did, O' fairy tales, with pictur's in; an' got a little pair O' red-top boots 'at John-Jack said he'd be'n a-pricin' there. An' Lide got him a little sword, an' Madeline, a drum; An' shootin'-crackersâLawzy-day! an' they're so danger-some! An' Piney, ever' time the rest 'ud buy some other toy, She'd take an' turn in then an' buy more candy fer the boy! âWell,â thinks-says-I, when they got back, âyour pocketbooks is dry!ââ But little Johnts was there hisse'f that afternoon, so Iâ Well, all of us kep' mighty mum, tel we got him away By tellin' him to be shore an' come to-morryâChris'mus Dayâ An' fetch his mother 'long with him! An' how he scud acrost The fieldsâhis towhead, in the dusk, jes' like a streak o' frost!â His comfert flutter'n' as he runâan' old Tige, don't you know, A-jumpin' high fer rabbits an' a plowin' up the snow! It must 'a' be'n 'most ten that night afore we got to bedâ With Wilse an' John-Jack he'ppin' us; an' Freeman in the shed, An' Lide out with the lantern while he trimmed the Chris'mus Tree Out of a little scrub-oak-top 'at suited to a âTâ! All night I dreamp' o' hearin' things a-skulkin' round the placeâ An' âOld Kriss,â with his whiskers off, an' freckles on his faceâ An' reindeers, shaped like shavin'-hosses at the cooper-shop, A-stickin' down the chimbly, with their heels out at the top! By time 'at Mother got me up 'twas plum daylight an' moreâ The front yard full o' neighbers all a-crowdin' round the door, With Johnts's mother leadin'; yesâan' little Johnts hisse'f, Set up on Freeman's shoulder, like a jug up on the she'f! Of course I can't describe it when they all got in to where We'd conjered up the Chris'mus Tree an' all the fixin's there!â Fer all the shouts o' laughtureâclappin' hands, an' crackin' jokes, Was heap o' kissin' goin' on amongst the women folks:â Fer, lo-behold-ye! there they had that young-un!âAn' his chin A-wobblin'-like;âan', shore enough, at last he started inâ An'âsich another bellerin', in all my mortal days, I never heerd, er 'spect to hear, in woe's app'inted ways! An' Mother grabs him up an' says: âIt's more'n he can bearâ It's all too suddent fer the child, an' too su'prisin'!âThere!â âOh, no it ain'tââsobbed little JohntsââI ain't su'prisedâbut I'm A-cryin' 'cause I watched you all, an' knowed it all the time!â THAT-AIR YOUNG-UN That-air young-un ust to set By the crick here day by day.â Watch the swallers dip and wet Their slim wings and skoot away; Watch these little snipes along The low banks tilt up and down 'Mongst the reeds, and hear the song Of the bullfrogs croakin' roun': Ust to set here in the sun Watchin' things, and listenun, 'Peared-like, mostly to the roar Of the dam below, er to That-air riffle nigh the shore Jes' acrost from me and you. Ust to watch him from the door Of the mill.â'Ud rigg him out With a fishin'-pole and lineâ Dig worms fer himânigh about Jes' spit on his bait!âbut he Never keered much, 'pearantly, To ketch fish!âHe'd ruther fine Out some sunny place, and set Watchin' things, with droopy head, And âa-listenun,â he saidâ âKind o' listenun above The old crick to what the wet Warter was a-talkin' of!â Jevver hear sich talk as that? Bothered Mother more'n me What the child was cipher'n' at.â Come home onc't and said 'at he Knowed what the snake-feeders thought When they grit their wings; and knowed Turkle-talk, when bubbles riz Over where the old roots growed Where he th'owed them pets o' hisâ Little turripuns he caught In the Country Ditch and packed In his pockets days and days!â Said he knowed what goslin's quackedâ Could tell what the killdees sayes, And grasshoppers, when they lit In the crick and âminniesâ bit Off their legs.ââBut, blame!â sayes he, Sort o' lookin' clean above Mother's head and on through meâ (And them eyes!âI see 'em yet!)â âBlame!â he sayes, âef I kin see, Er make out, jes' what the wet Warter is a-talkin' of!â Made me nervous! Mother, though, Said best not to scold the childâ The Good Bein' knowed.âAnd so We was only rickonciled When he'd be asleep.âAnd then, Time, and time, and time again, We've watched over him, you knowâ Her a-sayin' nothin'âjes' Kind o' smoothin' back his hair, And, all to herse'f, I guess, Studyin' up some kind o' prayer She ain't tried yet.âOnc't she said, Cotin' Scriptur', ââHe,ââ says she, In a solemn whisper, ââHe Givuth His beloved sleep!ââ And jes' then I heerd the rain Strike the shingles, as I turned Res'less to'rds the wall again. Pity strong men dast to weep!â Specially when up above Thrash! the storm comes down, and you Feel the midnight plum soaked through Heart and soul, and wunder, too, What the warter's talkin' of! Found his hat 'way down below Hinchman's Ford.â'Vesâ Anders he Rid and fetched it. Mother she Went wild over that, you knowâ Hugged it! kissed it!âTurribul! My hopes then was all gone too. ... Brung him in, with both hands full O' warter-liliesâ'peared-like new- Bloomed fer himârenched whiter still In the clear rain, mixin' fine And finer in the noon sunshine. ... Winders of the old mill looked On him where the hill-road crooked In on through the open gate. ... Laid him on the old settee On the porch there. Heerd the great Roarin' dam acrostâand we Heerd a crane cry in amongst The sycamoresâand then a dove Cutterin' on the mill-roofâthen Heerd the crick, and thought again, âNow what's it a-talkin' of?â THE PIPES OF PAN The Pipes of Pan! Not idler now are they Than when their cunning fashioner first blew The pith of music from them: Yet for you And me their notes are blown in many a way Lost in our murmurings for that old day That fared so well without us.âWaken to The pipings here at hand:âThe clear halloo Of truant voices, and the roundelay The waters warble in the solitude Of blooming thickets, where the robin's breast Sends up such ecstasy o'er dale and dell Each tree top answers, till in all the wood There lingers not one squirrel in his nest Whetting his hunger on an empty shell. DOWN AROUND THE RIVER Noon-time and June-time, down around the river! Have to furse with Lizey Annâbut lawzy! I fergive her! Drives me off the place, and says 'at all 'at she's a-wishin', Land o' gracious! time'll come I'll git enough o' fishin'! Little Dave, a-choppin' wood, never 'pears to notice; Don't know where she's hid his hat, er keerin' where his coat is,â Specalatin', more'n like, he hain't a-goin' to mind me, And guessin' where, say twelve o'clock, a feller'd likely find me. Noon-time and June-time, down around the river! Clean out o' sight o' home, and skulkin' under kivver Of the sycamores, jack-oaks, and swamp-ash and ellumâ Idies all so jumbled up, you kin hardly tell 'em!â Tired, you know, but lovin' it, smilin' jes' to think 'at Any sweeter tiredness you'd fairly want to drink it.

Hungry, but a-hiddin' it, er jes' a-not a-keerin':â Kingfisher gittin' up and skootin' out o' hearin'; Snipes on the t'other side, where the County Ditch is, Wadin' up and down the aidge like they'd rolled their britches!

Noon-time and June-time down around the river! HIS MOTHER Dead! my wayward boyâmy ownâ Not the Law's! but mineâthe good God's free gift to me alone, Sanctified by motherhood. âBad,â you say: Well, who is not? âBrutalâââwith a heart of stoneââ And âred-handed.ââAh! the hot Blood upon your own! I come not, with downward eyes, To plead for him shamedly,â God did not apologize When he gave the boy to me. Simply, I make ready now For His verdict.âYou prepareâ You have killed us bothâand how Will you face us There? IN BOHEMIA Ha! My dear! I'm back againâ Vender of Bohemia's wares! Lordy! How it pants a man Climbing up those awful stairs! Well, I've made the dealer say Your sketch might sell, anyway! And I've made a publisher Hear my poem, Kate, my dear. In Bohemia, Kate, my dearâ Lodgers in a musty flat On the top floorâliving here Neighborless, and used to that,â Like a nest beneath the eaves, So our little home receives Only guests of chirping cheerâ We'll be happy, Kate, my dear! Under your north light there, you At your easel, with a stain On your nose of Prussian blue, Paint your bits of shine and rain; With my feet thrown up at will O'er my littered window-sill, I write rhymes that ring as clear As your laughter, Kate, my dear. Puff my pipe, and stroke my hairâ Bite my pencil-tip and gaze At you, mutely mooning there O'er your âAprilsâ and your âMaysâ! Equal inspiration in Dimples of your cheek and chin, And the golden atmosphere Of your paintings, Kate, my dear! Trying! Yes, at times it is, To clink happy rhymes, and fling On the canvas scenes of bliss, When we are half famishing!â When your âjerseyâ rips in spots, And your hat's âforget-me-notsâ Have grown tousled, old and searâ It is trying, Kate, my dear! Butâas sureâsome picture sells, Andâsometimesâthe poetryâ Bless us! How the parrot yells His acclaims at you and me! How we revel then in scenes Or high banqueting!âsardinesâ Saladsâolivesâand a sheer Pint of sherry, Kate, my dear! Even now I cross your palm With this great round world of gold!â âTalking wild?â Perhaps I amâ Then, this little five-year-old!â Call it anything you will, So it lifts your face until I may kiss away that tear Ere it drowns me, Kate, my dear. MOON-DROWNED 'Twas the height of the fÃªte when we quitted the riot, And quietly stole to the terrace alone, Where, pale as the lovers that ever swear by it, The moon it gazed down as a god from his throne. We stood there enchanted.âAnd O the delight of The sight of the stars and the moon and the sea, And the infinite skies of that opulent night of Purple and gold and ivory! The lisp of the lip of the ripple just underâ The half-awake nightingale's dream in the yewsâ Came up from the water, and down from the wonder Of shadowy foliage, drowsed with the dews,â Unsteady the firefly's taperâunsteady The poise of the stars, and their light in the tide, As it struggled and writhed in caress of the eddy, As love in the billowy breast of a bride. The far-away lilt of the waltz rippled to us, And through us the exquisite thrill of the air: Like the scent of bruised bloom was her breath, and its dew was Not honier-sweet than her warm kisses were. We stood there enchanted.âAnd O the delight of The sight of the stars and the moon and the sea, And the infinite skies of that opulent night of Purple and gold and ivory!

WAIT FOR THE MORNING Wait for the morning:âIt will come, indeed, As surely as the night hath given need. The yearning eyes, at last, will strain their sight No more unanswered by the morning light; No longer will they vainly strive, through tears, To pierce the darkness of thy doubts and fears, But, bathed in balmy dews and rays of dawn, Will smile with rapture o'er the darkness drawn. Wait for the morning, O thou smitten child, Scorned, scourged and persecuted and reviledâ Athirst and famishing, none pitying thee, Crowned with the twisted thorns of agonyâ No faintest gleam of sunlight through the dense Infinity of gloom to lead thee thence.â Wait for the morning:âIt will come, indeed, As surely as the night hath given need, YOUTH AND AGE When in our blithest youth we sing, We sing our saddestâslack the string Of music into saddest key, And sob, with voices quavering In pangs of melody. When in maturer yearsâ When grown acquaint with sighs and tearsâ Our voices ring a lighter tone, Our perverse harp peals o'er the moanâ A pÃ¦an of hope that lifts and cheers. And last, in age's bleak extreme, With youth, life, love, allâall a dream, What glad songs leap To our glad lipsâwhat raptures gleam In the old eyesâtoo glad to weep. THE POET OF THE FUTURE O the Poet of the Future! He will come to us as comes The beauty of the bugle's voice above the roar of drumsâ The beauty of the bugle's voice above the roar and din Of battle-drums that pulse the time the victor marches in. His hands will hold no harp, in sooth; his lifted brow will bear No coronet of laurelânay, nor symbol anywhere, Save that his palms are brothers to the toiler's at the plow, His face to heaven, and the dew of duty on his brow. He will sing across the meadow,âand the woman at the well Will stay the dripping bucket, with a smile ineffable; And the children in the orchard will gaze wistfully the way The happy songs come to them, with the fragrance of the hay; The barn will neigh in answer, and the pasture-lands behind Will chime with bells, and send responsive lowings down the wind; And all the echoes of the wood will jubilantly call In sweetest mimicry of that one sweet voice of all. O the Poet of the Future! He will come as man to man, With the honest arm of labor, and the honest face of tan, The honest heart of lowliness, the honest soul of love For human-kind and nature-kind about him and above. His hands will hold no harp, in sooth; his lifted brow will bear No coronet of laurelânay, nor symbol anywhere, Save that his palms are brothers to the toiler's at the plow, His face to heaven, and the dew of duty on his brow. NAUGHTY CLAUDE When Little Claude was naughty wunst At dinner-time, an' said He won't say âThank youâ to his Ma, She maked him go to bed An' stay two hours an' not git up,â So when the clock struck Two, Nen Claude says,ââThank you, Mr. Clock, I'm much obleeged to you!â THE ARTEMUS OF MICHIGAN Grand Haven is in Michigan, and in possession, too, Of as many rare attractions as our party ever knew:â The fine hotel, the landlord, and the lordly bill of fare, And the dainty-neat completeness of the pretty waiters there; The touch on the piano in the parlor, and the trill Of the exquisite sopranoâin our fancy singing still; Our cozy room, its comfort, and our thousand grateful thoughts, And at our door the gentle face Of H. Y. Potts! His artless observations, and his drollery of style, Bewildered with that sorrowful serenity of smileâ The eye's elusive twinkle, and the twitching of the lid, Like he didn't go to say it and was sorry that he did. O Artemus of Michigan! so worthy of the name, Our manager indorses it, and Bill Nye does the same,â You tickled our affection in so many tender spots That even Recollection laughs At H. Y. Potts!

Y. Potts! WAITIN' FER THE CAT TO DIE Lawzy! don't I rickollect That-air old swing in the lane! Right and proper, I expect, Old times can't come back again; But I want to state, ef they Could come back, and I could say What my pick 'ud be, i jing!

I'd say, Gimme the old gang O' barefooted, hungry, lean, Ornry boys you want to hang When you're growed up twic't as mean! The old gyarden-patch, the old Truants, and the stuff we stol'd! The old stompin'-groun', where we Wore the grass off, wild and free As the swoop o' the old swing, Where we ust to climb and cling, And twist roun', and fight, and lieâ Waitin' fer the cat to die! 'Pears like I most allus could Swing the highest of the crowdâ Jes' sail up there tel I stood Down-side up, and screech out loud,â Ketch my breath, and jes' drap back Fer to let the old swing slack, Yit my towhead dippin' still In the green boughs, and the chill Up my backbone taperin' down, With my shadder on the groun' Slow and slower trailin' byâ Waitin' fer the cat to die! Now my daughter's little Jane's Got a kind o' baby-swing On the porch, so's when it rains She kin play thereâlittle thing! And I'd limped out t'other day With my old cheer thisaway, Swingin' her and rockin' too, Thinkin' how I ust to do At her age, when suddently, âHey, Gran'pap!â she says to me, âWhy you rock so slow?â ... Says I, âWaitin' fer the cat to die!â THE ALL-KIND MOTHER Lo, whatever is at hand Is full meet for the demand: Nature ofttimes giveth best When she seemeth chariest. She hath shapen shower and sun To the need of every oneâ Summer bland and winter drear, Dimpled pool and frozen mere. All thou lackest she hath still Near thy finding and thy fill. Yield her fullest faith, and she Will endow thee royally. Loveless weed and lily fair She attendeth here and thereâ Kindly to the weed as to The lorn lily teared with dew. Each to her hath use as dear As the other; an thou clear Thy cloyed senses thou may'st see Haply all the mystery. Thou shalt see the lily get Its divinest blossom; yet Shall the weed's tip bloom no less With the song-bird's gleefulness. Thou art poor, or thou art richâ Never lightest matter which; All the glad gold of the noon, All the silver of the moon, She doth lavish on thee, while Thou withholdest any smile Of thy gratitude to her, Baser used than usurer. Shame be on thee an thou seek Not her pardon, with hot cheek, And bowed head, and brimming eyes At her merciful âArise!â TO HATTIEâON HER BIRTHDAY WRITTEN IN âA CHILD'S GARDEN OF VERSESâ When your âUncle Jimâ was younger, In the days of childish hunger For the honey of such verses As this little book rehearses In such sweet simplicity,â Just the simple gift that this is Would have brimmed his heart with blisses Sweet as Hattie's sweetest kisses, On her anniversary. DOWN TO THE CAPITAL I'be'n down to the Capital at Washington, D.C., Where Congerss meets and passes on the pensions ort to be Allowed to old one-legged chaps, like me, 'at sence the war Don't wear their pants in pairs at allâand yit how proud we are! Old Flukens, from our deestrick, jes' turned in and tuck and made Me stay with him whilse I was there; and longer 'at I stayed The more I kep' a-wantin' jes' to kind o' git away, And yit a-feelin' sociabler with Flukens ever' day. You see I'd got the idyâand I guess most folks agreesâ 'At men as rich as him, you know, kin do jes' what they please; A man worth stacks o' money, and a Congerssman and all, And livin' in a buildin' bigger'n Masonic Hall! Now mind, I'm not a-faultin' Flukeâhe made his money square: We both was Forty-niners, and both bu'sted gittin' there; I weakened and onwindlassed, and he stuck and stayed and made His millions; don't know what I'm worth untel my pension's paid. But I was goin' to tell youâer a-ruther goin' to try To tell you how he's livin' now: gas burnin' mighty nigh In ever' room about the house; and ever' night, about, Some blame reception goin' on, and money goin' out. They's people there from all the worldâjes' ever' kind 'at lives, Injuns and all! and Senaters, and Ripresentatives; And girls, you know, jes' dressed in gauze and roses, I declare, And even old men shamblin' round and a-waltzin' with 'em there! And bands a-tootin' circus-tunes, 'way in some other room Jes' chokin' full o' hothouse plants and pinies and perfume; And fountains, squirtin' stiddy all the time; and statutes, made Out o' puore marble, 'peared-like, sneakin' round there in the shade. And Fluke he coaxed and begged and pled with me to take a hand And sashay in amongst 'emâcrutch and all, you understand; But when I said how tired I was, and made fer open air, He follered, and tel five o'clock we set a-talkin' there. âMy God!â says heâFluke says to me, âI'm tireder'n you; Don't putt up yer tobacker tel you give a man a chew. Set back a leetle furder in the shadderâthat'll do; I'm tireder'n you, old man; I'm tireder'n you. âYou see that-air old dome,â says he, âhumped up ag'inst the sky? It's grand, first time you see it; but it changes, by and by, And then it stays jes' thatawayâjes' anchored high and dry Betwixt the sky up yender and the achin' of yer eye. âNight's purty; not so purty, though, as what it ust to be When my first wife was livin'. You remember her?â says he. I nodded-like, and Fluke went on, âI wonder now ef she Knows where I amâand what I amâand what I ust to be? âThat band in there!âI ust to think 'at music couldn't wear A feller out the way it does; but that ain't music thereâ That's jes' a' imitation, and like ever'thing, I swear, I hear, er see, er tetch, er taste, er tackle anywhere! âIt's all jes' artificial, this-'ere high-priced life of ours; The theory, it's sweet enough, tel it saps down and sours. They's no home left, ner ties o' home about it. By the powers, The whole thing's artificialer'n artificial flowers! âAnd all I want, and could lay down and sob fer, it to know The homely things of homely life; fer instance, jes' to go And set down by the kitchen stoveâLord! that 'u'd rest me so,â Jes' set there, like I ust to do, and laugh and joke, you know. âJes' set there, like I ust to do,â says Fluke, a-startin' in, 'Peared-like, to say the whole thing over to hisse'f ag'in; Then stopped and turned, and kind o' coughed, and stooped and fumbled fer Somepin' o' 'nuther in the grassâI guess his handkercher. Well, sence I'm back from Washington, where I left Fluke a-still A-leggin' fer me, heart and soul, on that-air pension bill, I've half-way struck the notion, when I think o' wealth and sich, They's nothin' much patheticker'n jes' a-bein' rich! JAP MILLER Jap Miller down at Martinsville's the blamedest feller yit! When he starts in a-talkin' other folks is apt to quit!â 'Pears like that mouth o' his'n wuzn't made fer nothin' else But jes' to argify 'em down and gether in their pelts: He'll talk you down on tariff; er he'll talk you down on tax, And prove the pore man pays 'em allâand them's about the fac's!â Religen, law, er politics, prize-fightin' er baseballâ Jes' tetch Jap up a little and he'll post you 'bout 'em all. And the comicalist feller ever tilted back a cheer And tuk a chaw tobacker kind o' like he didn't keer.â There's where the feller's stren'th lays,âhe's so common-like and plain,â They hain't no dude about old Jap, you bet youânary grain! They 'lected him to Council and it never turned his head, And didn't make no differunce what anybody said,â He didn't dress no finer, ner rag out in fancy clothes; But his voice in Council-meetin's is a turrer to his foes He's fer the pore man ever' time! And in the last campaign He stumped old Morgan County, through the sunshine and the rain, And helt the banner up'ards from a-trailin' in the dust, And cut loose on monopolies and cuss'd and cuss'd and cuss'd! He'd tell some funny story ever' now and then, you know, Tel, blame it! it wuz better'n a Jack-o'-lantern show! And I'd go furder, yit, to-day, to hear old Jap norate Than any high-toned orater 'at ever stumped the State! W'y, that-air blame Jap Miller, with his keen sircastic fun, Has got more friends than ary candidate 'at ever run! Don't matter what his views is, when he states the same to you, They allus coincide with yourn, the same as two and two: You can't take issue with himâer, at least, they hain't no sense In startin' in to down him, so you better not commence.â The best way's jes' to listen, like your humble servant does, And jes' concede Jap Miller is the best man ever wuz! JOHN TARKINGTON JAMESON John Jameson, my jo John! Ye're bonnie wee an' sma'; Your ee's the morning violet, Wi' tremblin' dew an' a'; Your smile's the gowden simmer-sheen, Wi' glintin' pearls aglow Atween the posies o' your lips, John Jameson, my jo! Ye hae the faither's braidth o' brow, An' synes his look benign Whiles he hings musin' ower the burn, Wi' leestless hook an' line; Ye hae the mither's mou' an' cheek An' denty chinâbut O! It's maist ye're like your ain braw sel', John Jameson, my jo! John Jameson, my jo John, Though, wi' sic luvers twain, Ye dance far yont your whustlin' frien' Wha laggart walks his lane,â Be mindet, though he naps his last Whaur kirkyird thistles grow, His ghaist shall caper on wi' you, John Jameson, my jo! HENRY W. GRADY ATLANTA, DECEMBER 23, 1889 True-hearted friend of all true friendliness!â Brother of all true brotherhoods!âThy hand And its late pressure now we understand Most fully, as it falls thus gestureless And Silence lulls thee into sweet excess Of sleep. Sleep thou content!âThy loved Southland Is swept with tears, as rain in sunshine; and Through all the frozen North our eyes confess Like sorrowâseeing still the princely sign Set on thy lifted brow, and the rapt light Of the dark, tender, melancholy eyesâ Thrilled with the music of those lips of thine, And yet the fire thereof that lights the night With the white splendor of thy prophecies. IN THE EVENING I In the evening of our days, When the first far stars above Glimmer dimmer, through the haze, Than the dewy eyes of love, Shall we mournfully revert To the vanished morns and Mays Of our youth, with hearts that hurt,â In the evening of our days? II Shall the hand that holds your own Till the twain are thrilled as now,â Be withheld, or colder grown? Shall my kiss upon your brow Falter from its high estate? And, in all forgetful ways, Shall we sit apart and waitâ In the evening of our days? III Nay, my wifeâmy life!âthe gloom Shall enfold us velvet-wise, And my smile shall be the groom Of the gladness of your eyes: Gently, gently as the dew Mingles with the darkening maze, I shall fall asleep with youâ In the evening of our days. THOUGHTS ON THE LATE WAR I was for Unionâyou, ag'in' it. 'Pears like, to me, each side was winner, Lookin' at now and all 'at's in it. Le' 's go to dinner. Le' 's kind o' jes' set down together And do some pardnership forgittin'â Talk, say, for instunce, 'bout the weather, Or somepin' fittin'. The war, you know, 's all done and ended, And ain't changed no p'ints o' the compass; Both North and South the health's jes' splendid As 'fore the rumpus. The old farms and the old plantations Still ockipies the'r old positions. Le' 's git back to old situations And old ambitions. Le' 's let up on this blame', infernal Tongue-lashin' and lap-jacket vauntin', And git back home to the eternal Ca'm we're a-wantin'. Peace kind o' sort o' suits my dietâ When women does my cookin' for me; Ther' wasn't overly much pie et Durin' the army. THE OLD BAND It's mighty good to git back to the old town, shore, Considerin' I've b'en away twenty year and more. Sence I moved then to Kansas, of course I see a change, A-comin' back, and notice things that's new to me and strange; Especially at evening when yer new band-fellers meet, In fancy uniforms and all, and play out on the streetâ ... What's come of old Bill Lindsey and the Saxhorn fellersâsay? I want to hear the old band play. What's come of Eastman, and Nat Snow? And where's War Barnett at? And Nate and Bony Meek; Bill Hart; Tom Richa'son and that Air brother of him played the drum as twic't as big as Jim; And old Hi Kerns, the carpenterâsay, what's become o' him? I make no doubt yer new band now's a competenter band, And plays their music more by note than what they play by hand, And stylisher and grander tunes; but somehowâanyway, I want to hear the old band play. Sich tunes as âJohn Brown's Bodyâ and âSweet Alice,â don't you know; And âThe Camels Is A-Comin',â and âJohn Anderson, My Joâ; And a dozent others of 'emââNumber Nineâ and âNumber 'Levenâ Was favo-rites that fairly made a feller dream o' Heaven. And when the boys 'u'd saranade, I've laid so still in bed I've even heerd the locus'-blossoms droppin' on the shed When âLilly Dale,â er âHazel Dell,â had sobbed and died awayâ ... I want to hear the old band play. Yer new band ma'by beats it, but the old band's what I saidâ It allus 'peared to kind o' chord with somepin' in my head; And, whilse I'm no musicianer, when my blame' eyes is jes' Nigh drownded out, and Mem'ry squares her jaws and sort o' says She won't ner never will fergit, I want to jes' turn in And take and light right out o' here and git back West ag'in And stay there, when I git there, where I never haf' to say I want to hear the old band play. BY ANY OTHER NAME First the teacher called the roll, Clos't to the beginnin', âAddeliney Bowersox!â Set the school a-grinnin'. Winter-time, and stingin' cold When the session took upâ Cold as we all looked at her, Though she couldn't look up! Total stranger to us, tooâ Country folks ain't allus Nigh so shameful unpolite As some people call us!â But the honest facts is, then, Addeliney Bower- Sox's feelin's was so hurt She cried half an hour! My dest was acrost from hern: Set and watched her tryin' To p'tend she didn't keer, And a kind o' dryin' Up her tears with smilesâtel I Thought, âWell, âAddeliney Bowersoxâ is plain, but she's Purty as a piney!â It's be'n many of a year Sence that most oncommon Cur'ous name o' Bowersox Struck me so abomin- Nubble and outlandish-like!â I changed it to Adde- Liney Daubenspeckâand that Nearly killed her Daddy! LINES FER ISAAC BRADWELL, OF INDANOPLIS, IND., COUNTY-SEAT OF MARION [Writ on the fly-leaf of a volume of the author's poems that come in one of gittin' burnt up in the great Bowen-Merrill's fire of March 17, 1890.] Through fire and flood this book has passed.â Fer what?âI hardly dare to astâ Less'n it's still to pamper me With extry food fer vanity;â Fer, sence it's fell in hands as true As yourn isâand a Hoosier too,â I'm prouder of the book, I jing! Than 'fore they tried to burn the thing! âTHE LITTLE MAN IN THE TIN-SHOPâ When I was a little boy, long ago, And spoke of the theater as the âshow,â The first one that I went to see, Mother's brother it was took meâ (My uncle, of course, though he seemed to be Only a boyâI loved him so!) And ah, how pleasant he made it all! And the things he knew that I should know!â The stage, the âdrop,â and the frescoed wall; The sudden flash of the lights; and oh, The orchestra, with its melody, And the lilt and jingle and jubilee Of âThe Little Man in the Tin-shopâ! For Uncle showed me the âLeaderâ there, With his pale, bleak forehead and long, black hair; Showed me the âSecond,â and â'Cello,â and âBass,â And the âB-Flat,â pouting and puffing his face At the little end of the horn he blew Silvery bubbles of music through; And he coined me names of them, each in turn, Some comical name that I laughed to learn, Clean on down to the last and best,â The lively little man, never at rest, Who hides away at the end of the string, And tinkers and plays on everything,â That's âThe Little Man in the Tin-shopâ! Raking a drum like a rattle of hail, Clinking a cymbal or castanet; Chirping a twitter or sending a wail Through a piccolo that thrills me yet; Reeling ripples of riotous bells, And tipsy tinkles of trianglesâ Wrangled and tangled in skeins of sound Till it seemed that my very soul spun round, As I leaned, in a breathless joy, toward my Radiant uncle, who snapped his eye And said, with the courtliest wave of his hand, âWhy, that little master of all the band Is âThe Little Man in the Tin-shopâ! âAnd I've heard Verdi the Wonderful, And Paganini, and Ole Bull, Mozart, Handel, and Mendelssohn, And fair Parepa, whose matchless tone Karl, her master, with magic bow, Blent with the angels', and held her so Tranced till the rapturous Infiniteâ And I've heard arias, faint and low, From many an operatic light Glimmering on my swimming sight Dimmer and dimmer, until, at last, I still sit, holding my roses fast For âThe Little Man in the Tin-Shop.ââ Oho! my Little Man, joy to youâ And yoursâand theirsâyour lifetime through! Though I've heard melodies, boy and man, Since first âthe showâ of my life began, Never yet have I listened to Sadder, madder or gladder glees Than your unharmonied harmonies; For yours is the music that appeals To all the fervor the boy's heart feelsâ All his glories, his wildest cheers, His bravest hopes, and his brightest tears; And so, with his first bouquet, he kneels To âThe Little Man in the Tin-shop.â A SOUTHERN SINGER WRITTEN IN MADISON CAWEIN'S âLYRICS AND IDYLSâ Herein are blown from out the South Songs blithe as those of Pan's pursed mouthâ As sweet in voice as, in perfume, The night-breath of magnolia-bloom. Such sumptuous languor lures the senseâ Such luxury of indolenceâ The eyes blur as a nymph's might blur, With water-lilies watching her. You waken, thrilling at the trill Of some wild bird that seems to spill The silence full of winy drips Of song that Fancy sips and sips. Betimes, in brambled lanes wherethrough The chipmunk stripes himself from view, You pause to lop a creamy spray Of elder-blossoms by the way. Or where the morning dew is yet Gray on the topmost rail, you set A sudden palm and, vaulting, meet Your vaulting shadow in the wheat. On lordly swards, of suave incline, Entessellate with shade and shine, You shall misdoubt your lowly birth, Clad on as one of princely worth: The falcon on your wrist shall rideâ Your milk-white Arab side by side With one of raven-black.âYou fain Would kiss the hand that holds the rein. Nay, nay, Romancer! Poet! Seer Sing us back homeâfrom there to here: Grant your high grace and wit, but we Most honor your simplicity.â Herein are blown from out the South Songs blithe as those of Pan's pursed mouthâ As sweet in voice as, in perfume, The night-breath of magnolia-bloom. JUNE AT WOODRUFF Out at Woodruff Placeâafar From the city's glare and jar, With the leafy trees, instead Of the awnings, overhead; With the shadows cool and sweet, For the fever of the street; With the silence, like a prayer, Breathing round us everywhere. Gracious anchorage, at last, From the billows of the vast Tide of life that comes and goes, Whence and where nobody knowsâ Moving, like a skeptic's thought, Out of nowhere into naught. Touch and tame us with thy grace, Placid calm of Woodruff Place! Weave a wreath of beechen leaves For the brow that throbs and grieves O'er the ledger, bloody-lined, 'Neath the sunstruck window-blind! Send the breath of woodland bloom Through the sick man's prison-room, Till his old farm-home shall swim Sweet in mind to hearten him! Out at Woodruff Place the Muse Dips her sandal in the dews, Sacredly as night and dawn Baptize lilied grove and lawn: Woody path, or paven wayâ She doth haunt them night and day,â Sun or moonlight through the trees, To her eyes, are melodies. Swinging lanterns, twinkling clear Through night-scenes, are songs to herâ Tinted lilts and choiring hues, Blent with children's glad halloos; Then belated lays that fade Into midnight's serenadeâ Vine-like words and zithern-strings Twined through all her slumberings. BlessÃ¨d be each hearthstone set Neighboring the violet! BlessÃ¨d every roof-tree prayed Over by the beech's shade! BlessÃ¨d doorway, opening where We may look on Natureâthere Hand to hand and face to faceâ Storied realm, or Woodruff Place. IRY AND BILLY AND JO A TINTYPE Iry an' Billy an' Jo!â Iry an' Billy's the boys, An' Jo's their dog, you know,â Their pictur's took all in a row. Bet they kin kick up a noiseâ Iry an' Billy, the boys, An' that-air little dog Jo! Iry's the one 'at stands Up there a-lookin' so mild An' meekâwith his hat in his hands, Like such a 'bediant childâ (Sakes-alive!)âAn' Billy he sets In the cheer an' holds on to Jo an' sweats Hisse'f, a-lookin' so good! Ho-ho! Iry an' Billy an' Jo! Yit the way them boys, you know, Usen to jes' turn in An' fight over that dog Jo Wuz a burnin'-shame-an'-a-sin!â Iry he'd argy 'at, by gee-whizz! That-air little Jo-dog wuz his!â An' Billy he'd claim it wuzn't soâ 'Cause the dog wuz hisn!âAn' at it they'd go, Nip-an'-tugg, tooth-an'-toe-nail, you knowâ Iry an' Billy an' Jo! But their Paâ(He wuz the marshal then)â He 'tended-like 'at he jerked 'em up; An' got a jury o' Brick-yard men An' helt a trial about the pup: An' he says he jes' like to 'a' died When the rest o' us town-boys testifiedâ Regardin', you know, Iry an' Billy an' Jo.â 'Cause we all knowed, when the Gipsies they Camped down here by the crick last Fall, They brung Jo with 'em, 'an' give him away To Iry an' Billy fer nothin' at all!â So the jury fetched in the verdick so Jo he ain't neether o' theirn fer shoreâ He's both their dog, an' jes' no more! An' so They've quit quarrelin' long ago, Iry an' Billy an' Jo. UNCLE SIDNEY'S VIEWS I hold that the true age of wisdom is when We are boys and girls, and not women and men,â When as credulous children we know things because We believe themâhowever averse to the laws. It is faith, then, not science and reason, I say, That is genuine wisdom.âAnd would that to-day We, as then, were as wise and ineffably blest As to live, love and die, and trust God for the rest! So I simply deny the old notion, you know, That the wiser we get as the older we grow!â For in youth all we know we are certain of.âNow The greater our knowledge, the more we allow For skeptical margin.âAnd hence I regret That the world isn't flat, and the sun doesn't set, And we may not go creeping up home, when we die, Through the moon, like a round yellow hole in the sky. BEREAVED Let me come in where you sit weeping,âay, Let me, who have not any child to die, Weep with you for the little one whose love I have known nothing of. The little arms that slowly, slowly loosed Their pressure round your neck; the hands you used To kiss.âSuch armsâsuch hands I never knew. May I not weep with you? Fain would I be of serviceâsay some thing, Between the tears, that would be comforting,â But ah! so sadder than yourselves am I, Who have no child to die. THE RIDER OF THE KNEE Knightly Rider of the Knee Of Proud-prancing Unclery! Gaily mount, and wave the sign Of that mastery of thine. Pat thy steed and turn him free, Knightly Rider of the Knee! Sit thy charger as a throneâ Lash him with thy laugh alone: Sting him only with the spur Of such wit as may occur, Knightly Rider of the Knee, In thy shriek of ecstasy. Would, as now, we might endure, Twain as oneâthou miniature Ruler, at the rein of meâ Knightly Rider of the Knee! THE LITTLE-RED-APPLE TREE The Little-red-apple Tree!â O the Little-red-apple Tree! When I was the little-est bit of a boy And you were a boy with me! The bluebird's flight from the topmost boughs, And the boys up thereâso high That we rocked over the roof of the house And whooped as the winds went by! Hey! The Little-red-apple Tree! With the garden-beds below, And the old grape-arbor so welcomely Hiding the rake and hoe! Hiding, too, as the sun dripped through In spatters of wasted gold, Frank and Amy away from you And me in the days of old! The Little-red-apple Tree!â In the edge of the garden-spot, Where the apples fell so lavishly Into the neighbor's lot;â So do I think of you alway, Brother of mine, as the tree,â Giving the ripest wealth of your love To the world as well as me. Ho! The Little-red-apple Tree! Sweet as its juiciest fruit Spanged on the palate spicily, And rolled o'er the tongue to boot, Is the memory still and the joy Of the Little-red-apple Tree, When I was the little-est bit of a boy And you were a boy with me! UNCLE SIDNEY Sometimes, when I bin bad, An' Pa âcurrecksâ me nen, An' Uncle Sidney he comes here, I'm allus good again; 'Cause Uncle Sidney says, An' takes me up an' smiles,â The goodest mens they is ain't good As baddest little childs! IN THE NIGHT When it's night, and no light, too, Wakin' by yourse'f, With the old clock mockin' you On the mantel-she'f; In the darkâso still and black, You're afeard you'll hear Somepin' awful pop and crack,â âGo to sleep, my dear!â That's what Mother says.âAnd then's When we ain't afeard! Wunder, when we be big mens, Then 'ul we be skeerd?â Some night Mother's goned away, And ist us is here, Will The Good Man wake and say, âGo to sleep, my dearâ? THE DREAM OF THE LITTLE PRINCESS 'Twas a curious dream, good sooth!â The dream of The Little Princess; It seemed a dream, yet a truth, Long years ago in her youth.â It came as a dreamâno less It was not a dream, she says. (She is singing and saying things Musical as the wile Of the eery quaverings That drip from the grievÃ¨d strings Of her lute.âWe weep or smile Even as she, meanwhile.) In a day, long dead and gone, When her castle-turrets threw Their long, sharp shadows on The sward like lances,âwan And lone, she strayed into Strange grounds where lilies grew. There, late in the afternoon, As she sate in the terrace shade, Rav'ling a half-spun tune From a lute like a wee new-moon,â High off was a bugle played, And a sound as of steeds that neighed. And the lute fell from her hands, As her eyes raised, half in doubt, To the arch of the azure lands Where lo! with the fluttering strands Of a rainbow reined about His wrist, rode a horseman out. And The Little Princess was stirred No less at his steeds than him;â A jet-black span of them gird In advance, he bestrode the third; And the troop of them seemed to swim The skies as the Seraphim. Wingless they were, yet so Upborne in their wondrous flightâ As their master bade them go, They dwindled on high; or lo! They curved from their heavenmost height And swooped to her level sight. And the eyes of The Little Princess Grow O so bright as the chants Of the horseman's courtliness,â Saluting her lowâAh, yes! And lifting a voice that haunts Her own song's weird romance. For (she sings) at last he swept As near to her as the tips Of the lilies, that whitely slept, As he leaned o'er one and wept And touched it with his lipsâ Sweeter than honey-drips! And she keeps the lily yetâ As the horseman bade (she says) As he launched, with a wild curvet, His steeds toward the far sunset, Till gulfed in its gorgeousness And lost to The Little Princess: But O my master sweet! He is coming again! (she sings) My Prince of the Coursers fleet, With his bugle's echoings, And the breath of his voice for the wings Of the sandals of his feet! THE SQUIRT-GUN UNCLE MAKED ME Uncle Sidney, when he was here, Maked me a squirt-gun out o' some Elder-bushes 'at growned out near Where wuz the brick-yardâ'way out clear To where the Toll-Gate come! So when we walked back home again, He maked it, out in our woodhouse where Wuz the old work-bench, an' the old jack-plane, An' the old 'poke-shave, an' the tools all lay'n' Ist like he wants 'em there. He sawed it first with the old hand-saw; An' nen he peeled off the bark, an' got Some glass an' scraped it; an' told 'bout Pa, When he wuz a boy an' fooled his Ma, An' the whippin' 'at he caught. Nen Uncle Sidney, he took an' filed A' old arn ramrod; an' one o' the ends He screwed fast into the vise; an' smiled, Thinkin', he said, o' when he wuz a child, 'Fore him an' Pa wuz mens. He punched out the peth, an' nen he putt A plug in the end with a hole notched through; Nen took the old drawey-knife an' cut An' maked a hande 'at shoved clean shut But ist where yer hand held to. An' he wropt th'uther end with some string an' white Piece o' the sleeve of a' old tored shirt; An' nen he showed me to hold it tight, An' suck in the water an' work it right.â An' it 'ud ist squirt an' squirt! THE YOUTHFUL PRESS Little Georgie Tompers, he Printed some fine cards for me; But his press had âJâ for Jamesâ By no means the choice of names.â Yet it's proper, none the less, That his little printing-press Should be taught that James for âJâ Always is the better way. For, if left to its own whim, Next time it might call me âJim,ââ Then The Cultured Press would be Shocked at such a liberty. Therefore, little presses all Should be trained, while they are small, To develop taste in these Truths that shape our destinies. MAX AND JIM Max an' Jim, They're each other's Fat an' slim Little brothers. Max is thin, An' Jim, the fac's is, Fat ag'in As little Max is! Their Pa 'lowed He don't know whuther He's most proud Of one er th'other! Their Ma says They're both so sweetâ'm!â That she guess She'll haf to eat 'em! THE OLD HAYMOW The Old Haymow's the place to play Fer boys, when it's a rainy day! I good 'eal ruther be up there Than down in town, er anywhere! When I play in our stable-loft The good old hay's so dry an' soft, An' feels so fine, an' smells so sweet, I 'most ferget to go an' eat. An' one time onc't I did ferget To go tel dinner was all et,â An' they had shortcakeâan'âBud he Hogged up the piece Ma saved fer me! Nen I won't let him play no more In our haymow where I keep store An' got hen-eggs to sell,âan' shoo The cackle-un old hen out, too! An' nen, when Aunty she was here A-visitun from Rensselaer, An' bringed my little cousin,âhe Can come up there an' play with me. But, after whileâwhen Bud he bets 'At I can't turn no summersetts, I let him come up, ef he can Ac' ha'f-way like a gentleman! GUINEY-PIGS Guiney-pigs is awful cute, With their little trimbly snoot Sniffin' at the pussly that We bring 'em to nibble at. Looks like they're so clean an' white, An' so dainty an' polite, They could eat like you an' me When they's company! Tiltin' down the clover-tops Till they spill, an' overdrops The sweet morning dewâDon't you Think they might have napkins, too? Ef a guiney-pig was big As a shore-an'-certain pig, Nen he wouldn't ac' so fine When he come to dine. Nen he'd chomp his jaws an' eat Things out in the dirty street, Dirt an' all! An' nen lay down In mud-holes an' waller roun'! So the guiney-pigs is best, 'Cause they're nice an' tidiest; They eat 'most like you an' me When they's company! BUSCH AND TOMMY Little Busch and Tommy Haysâ Small the theme, but large the praise,â For two braver brothers, Of such toddling years and size, Bloom of face, and blue of eyes, Never trampled soldier-wise On the rights of mothers! Even boldly facing their Therapeutic father's air Of complex abstraction, But to kindleâkindlier gaze, Wake more smiles and gracious waysâ Ay, nor find in all their days Ampler satisfaction! Hail ye, then, with chirp and cheer, All wan patients, waiting here Bitterer medications!â Busch and Tommy, tone us, too.â How our life-blood leaps anew, Under loving touch of you And your ministrations! THE LUGUBRIOUS WHING-WHANG The rhyme o' The Raggedy Man's at's best Is Tickle me, Love, in these Lonesome Ribs, 'Cause that-un's the strangest of all o' the rest, An' the worst to learn, an' the last one guessed, An' the funniest one, an' the foolishest.â Tickle me, Love, in these Lonesome Ribs! I don't know what in the world it meansâ Tickle me, Love, in these Lonesome Ribs!â An' nen when I tell him I don't, he leans Like he was a-grindin' on some machines An' says: Ef I don't, w'y, I don't know beans! Tickle me, Love, in these Lonesome Ribs! Out on the margin of Moonshine Land, Tickle me, Love, in these Lonesome Ribs! Out where the Whing-Whang loves to stand, Writing his name with his tail in the sand, And swiping it out with his oogerish hand; Tickle me, Love, in these Lonesome Ribs! Is it the gibber of Gungs or Keeks? Tickle me, Love, in these Lonesome Ribs! Or what is the sound that the Whing-Whang seeks?â Crouching low by the winding creeks, And holding his breath for weeks and weeks! Tickle me, Love, in these Lonesome Ribs! Aroint him the wraithest of wraithly things! Tickle me, Love, in these Lonesome Ribs! 'Tis a fair Whing-Whangess, with phosphor rings, And bridal-jewels of fangs and stings; And she sits and as sadly and softly sings As the mildewed whir of her own dead wings,â Tickle me, Dear, Tickle me here, Tickle me, Love, in me Lonesome Ribs! LITTLE MANDY'S CHRISTMAS-TREE Little Mandy and her Ma 'S porest folks you ever saw!â Lived in porest house in town, Where the fence 'uz all tore down. And no front-door steps at allâ Ist a' old box 'g'inst the wall; And no door-knob on the door Outside.âMy! but they 'uz pore!

A FRUIT-PIECE The afternoon of summer folds Its warm arms round the marigolds, And, with its gleaming fingers, pets The watered pinks and violets That from the casement vases spill, Over the cottage window-sill, Their fragrance down the garden walks Where droop the dry-mouthed hollyhocks. How vividly the sunshine scrawls The grape-vine shadows on the walls! How like a truant swings the breeze In high boughs of the apple-trees! The slender âfree-stoneâ lifts aloof, Full languidly above the roof, A hoard of fruitage, stamped with gold And precious mintings manifold. High up, through curled green leaves, a pear Hangs hot with ripeness here and there. Beneath the sagging trellisings, In lush, lack-luster clusterings, Great torpid grapes, all fattened through With moon and sunshine, shade and dew, Until their swollen girths express But forms of limp deliciousnessâ Drugged to an indolence divine With heaven's own sacramental wine.</field>

SONGâFOR NOVEMBER While skies glint bright with bluest light Through clouds that race o'er field and town, And leaves go dancing left and right, And orchard apples tumble down; While schoolgirls sweet, in lane or street, Lean 'gainst the wind and feel and hear Its glad heart like a lover's beat,â So reigns the rapture of the year. Then ho! and hey! and whoop-hooray! Though winter clouds be looming, Remember a November day Is merrier than mildest May With all her blossoms blooming. While birds in scattered flight are blown Aloft and lost in bosky mist, And truant boys scud home alone 'Neath skies of gold and amethyst; While twilight falls, and echo calls Across the haunted atmosphere, With low, sweet laughs at intervals,â So reigns the rapture of the year. Then ho! and hey! and whoop-hooray! Though winter clouds be looming, Remember a November day Is merrier than mildest May With all her blossoms blooming. AT AUNTY'S HOUSE One time, when we'z at Aunty's houseâ 'Way in the country!âwhere They's ist but woodsâan' pigs, an' cowsâ An' all's outdoors an' air!â An' orchurd-swing; an' churry treesâ An' churries in 'em!âYes, an' these- Here redhead birds steals all they please, An' tetch 'em ef you dare!â W'y, wunst, one time, when we wuz there, We et out on the porch!

An' I ist et p'surves an' things 'At Ma don't 'low me toâ An' chickun-gizzurdsâ(don't like wings Like Parunts does! do you?) An' all the time the wind blowed there, An' I could feel it in my hair, An' ist smell clover ever'where!â An' a old redhead flew Purt' nigh wite over my high-chair, When we et on the porch! LIFE AT THE LAKE The green below and the blue above!â The waves caressing the shores they love: Sails in haven, and sails afar And faint as the water-lilies are In inlets haunted of willow wands, Listless lovers, and trailing hands With spray to gem them and tan to glove.â The green below and the blue above. The blue above and the green below! Would that the world were always so!â Always summer and warmth and light, With mirth and melody day and night! Birds in the boughs of the beckoning trees, Chirr of locusts and whiff of breezeâ World-old roses that bud and blow.â The blue above and the green below. The green below and the blue above! Heigh! young hearts and the hopes thereof!â Kate in the hammock, and Tom sprawled on The swardâlike a lover's picture, drawn By the lucky dog himself, with Kate To moon o'er his shoulder and meditate On a fat old purse or a lank young love.â The green below and the blue above. The blue above and the green below! Shadow and sunshine to and fro.â Season for dreamsâwhate'er befall Hero, heroine, hearts and all! Wave or wildwoodâthe blithe bird sings, And the leaf-hid locust whets his wingsâ Just as a thousand years agoâ The blue above and the green below. JOHN BOYLE O'REILLY SEPULTUREâBOSTON, AUGUST 13, 1890 Dead? this peerless man of menâ Patriot, Poet, Citizen!â Dead? and ye weep where he lies Mute, with folded eyes! Courage! All his tears are done; Mark him, dauntless, face the sun! He hath led you.âStill, as true, He is leading you. Folded eyes and folded hands Typify divine commands He is hearkening to, intent Beyond wonderment. 'Tis promotion that has come Thus upon him. Stricken dumb Be your moanings dolorous!

Ere in selfish grief ye sink, Come! catch rapturous breath and thinkâ Think what sweep of wing hath he, Loosed in endless liberty.

IV Guss went out, and come in ag'in And filled a pint and tuk it outâ Stayed quite a spellâthen peeked back in, Half-hid-like where the light wuz dim, And jieuked his head At Tugg and said,â âCome out a minuteâhere's a gent Wants you to take a drink with him.â V WellâTugg laid down his cards and wentâ In fact, we all Got up, you know, Startin' to goâ When in reels Guss ag'inst the wall, As white as snow, Gaspin',ââHe's tuk Tugg!âWher' 's my gun?â And-sir, outside we heerd The hoss snort and kick up his heels Like he wuz skeerd, And then the buggy-wheels Scrapeâand then Tugg's voice hollerum,â âI'm bested!âGood-by, fellers!â...'Peared S' all-fired suddent, Nobody couldn't Jest git it fixed,âtel hoss and man, Buggy and Tugg, off through the dark Went like the devil beatin' tan- Bark!

Confirmed in part, yet somewhat differingâ (Grant that his gracious wraith will pardon me If impious!)âI think a better thing Is: being found out when one strives to be. So, Poet and Romancerâold as young, And wise as artlessâmasterful as mild,â If there be sweet in any song I've sung, 'Twas savored for thy palate, O my Child! For thee the lisping of the children allâ For thee the youthful voices of old yearsâ For thee all chords untamed or musicalâ For thee the laughter, and for thee the tears. And thus, borne to me o'er the seas between Thy land and mine, thy Song of certain wing Circles above me in the âpure sereneâ Of our high heaven's vast o'er-welcoming; While, packeted with joy and thankfulness, And fair hopes many as the stars that shine, And bearing all love's loyal messages, Mine own goes homing back to thee and thine. DECORATION DAY ON THE PLACE It's lonesomeâsorto' lonesome,âit's a Sund'y-day, to me, It 'pears-likeâmore'n any day I nearly ever see!â Yit, with the Stars and Stripes above, a-flutterin' in the air, On ev'ry Soldier's grave I'd love to lay a lily thare. They say, though, Decoration Days is giner'ly observed 'Most ev'rywheresâespeshally by soldier-boys that's served.â But me and Mother's never wentâwe seldom git away,â In p'int o' fact, we're allus home on Decoration Day. They say the old boys marches through the streets in colum's grand, A-follerin' the old war-tunes they're playin' on the bandâ And citizuns all jinin' inâand little children, tooâ All marchin', under shelter of the old Red White and Blue.â With roses! roses! roses!âev'rybody in the town!â And crowds o' little girls in white, jest fairly loaded down!â Oh! don't The Boys know it, from theyr camp acrost the hill?â Don't they see theyr com'ards comin' and the old flag wavin' still? Oh! can't they hear the bugul and the rattle of the drum?â Ain't they no way under heavens they can rickollect us some? Ain't they no way we can coax 'em, through the roses, jest to say They know that ev'ry day on earth's theyr Decoration Day? We've tried thatâme and Mother,âwhare Elias takes his rest, In the orchurdâin his uniform, and hands acrost his brest, And the flag he died fer, smilin' and a-ripplin' in the breeze Above his graveâand over that,âthe robin in the trees! And yit it's lonesomeâlonesome!âIt's a Sund'y-day, to me, It 'pears-likeâmore'n any day I nearly ever see!â Still, with the Stars and Stripes above, a-flutterin' in the air, On ev'ry soldier's grave I'd love to lay a lily thare. TOWN AND COUNTRY They's a prejudice allus 'twixt country and town Which I wisht in my hart wasent so. You take city people, jest square up and down, And they're mighty good people to know: And whare's better people a-livin', to-day, Than us in the country?âYit good As both of us is, we're divorsed, you might say, And won't compermise when we could! Now as nigh into town fer yer Pap, ef you please, Is what's called the sooburbs.âFer thare You'll at least ketch a whiff of the breeze and a sniff Of the breth of wild-flowrs ev'rywhare. They's room fer the childern to play, and grow, tooâ And to roll in the grass, er to climb Up a tree and rob nests, like they ortent to do, But they'll do anyhow ev'ry time! My Son-in-law said, when he lived in the town, He jest natchurly pined, night and day, Fer a sight of the woods, er a acre of ground Whare the trees wasent all cleared away! And he says to me onc't, whilse a-visitin' us On the farm, âIt's not strange, I declare, That we can't coax you folks, without raisin' a fuss, To come to town, visitin' thare!â And says I, âThen git back whare you sorto' belongâ And Madaline, too,âand yer three Little childern,â says I, âthat don't know a birdsong, Ner a hawk from a chicky-dee-dee! Git back,â I-says-I, âto the blue of the sky And the green of the fields, and the shine Of the sun, with a laugh in yer voice and yer eye As harty as Mother's and mine!â Wellâlong-and-short of it,âhe's compermised someâ He's moved in the sooburbs.âAnd now They don't haf to coax, when they want us to come, 'Cause we turn in and go anyhow! Fer thareâwell, they's room fer the songs and purfume Of the grove and the old orchurd-ground, And they's room fer the childern out thare, and they's room Fer theyr Gran'pap to waller 'em round! THE FIRST BLUEBIRD Jest rain and snow! and rain again! And dribble! drip! and blow! Then snow! and thaw! and slush! and thenâ Some more rain and snow! This morning I was 'most afeard To wake upâwhen, I jing! I seen the sunshine out and heerd The first bluebird of Spring!â Mother she'd raised the winder some;â And in acrost the orchurd come, Soft as a' angel's wing, A breezy, treesy, beesy hum, Too sweet for anything! The winter's shroud was rent apartâ The sun bu'st forth in glee,â And when that bluebird sung, my hart Hopped out o' bed with me! LINES TO PERFESSER JOHN CLARK RIDPATH A. M., LL. D. T-Y-TY [Cumposed by A Old Friend of the Fambily sence 'way back in the Forties, when they Settled nigh Fillmore, Putnam County, this State, whare John was borned and growed up, you might say, like the wayside flower.] Your neghbors in the country, whare you come from, hain't fergot!â We knowed you even better than your own-self, like as not. We profissied your runnin'-geers 'ud stand a soggy load And pull her, purty stiddy, up a mighty rocky road: We been a-watchin' your career sence you could write your nameâ But way you writ it first, I'll say, was jest a burnin' shame!â Your âJ.

The likes of you at College! But you went thare. How you paid Your way nobody's astin'âbut you worked,âyou hain't afraid,â Your clothes was, more'n likely, kindo' out o' style, perhaps, And not as snug and warm as some 'at hid the other chaps;â But when it come to Intullectâthey tell me yourn was dressed A leetle mite superber-like than any of the rest! And thare you stayedâand thare you've made your rickord, fare and squareâ Tel now it's Fame 'at writes your name, approvin', ev'rywhareâ Not jibblets of it, nuther,âbut all John Clark Ridpath, set Plum at the dashboard of the whole-endurin' Alfabet!

The first May-morning whispereth Thy gentle name in every breeze That lispeth through the young-leaved trees, New raimented in white and green Of bloom and leaf to crown thee queen;â And, as in odorous chorus, all The orchard-blossoms sweetly call Even as a singing voice that saith, Elizabeth! Elizabeth! II Elizabeth! Lo, lily-fair, In deep, cool shadows of thy hair, Thy face maintaineth its repose.â Is it, O sister of the rose, So better, sweeter, blooming thus Than in this briery world with us?â Where frost o'ertaketh, and the breath Of biting winter harrieth With sleeted rains and blighting snows All fairest bloomsâElizabeth! III Nay, then!âSo reign, Elizabeth, Crowned, in thy May-day realm of death! Put forth the scepter of thy love In every star-tipped blossom of The grassy dais of thy throne! Sadder are we, thus left alone, But gladder they that thrill to see Thy mother's rapture, greeting thee. Bereaved are we by lifeânot deathâ Elizabeth! Elizabeth! SONGS OF A LIFE-TIME MRS.

AN OLD MAN'S MEMORY The delights of our childhood is soon passed away, And our gloryus youth it departs,â And yit, dead and burried, they's blossoms of May Ore theyr medderland graves in our harts. So, friends of my barefooted days on the farm, Whether truant in city er not, God prosper you same as He's prosperin' me, Whilse your past hain't despised er fergot. Oh! they's nothin', at morn, that's as grand unto me As the glorys of Natchur so fare,â With the Spring in the breeze, and the bloom in the trees, And the hum of the bees ev'rywhare!

In the darkness, desolation, and contrition and affright; The awful hush that holds us shut away from all delight: The ever-weary memory that ever weary goes Recounting ever over every aching loss it knowsâ The ever-weary eyelids gasping ever for reposeâ In the dreary, weary watches of the night! Darkâstifling darkâthe watches of the night! With tingling nerves at tension, how the blackness flashes white With spectral visitations smitten past the inner sight!â What shuddering sense of wrongs we've wrought that may not be redressedâ Of tears we did not brush awayâof lips we left unpressed, And hands that we let fall, with all their loyalty unguessed! Ah! the empty, empty watches of the night! What solace in the watches of the night?â What frailest staff of hope to stayâwhat faintest shaft of light? Do we dream, and dare believe it, that by never weight of right Of our own poor weak deservings, we shall win the dawn at lastâ Our famished souls find freedom from this penance for the past, In a faith that leaps and lightens from the gloom that flees aghastâ Shall we survive the watches of the night? One leads us through the watches of the nightâ By the ceaseless intercession of our loved ones lost to sight He is with us through all trials, in His mercy and His might;â With our mothers there about Him, all our sorrow disappears, Till the silence of our sobbing is the prayer the Master hears, And His hand is laid upon us with the tenderness of tears In the waning of the watches of the night. OSCAR C. McCULLOCH INDIANAPOLIS, DECEMBER 12, 1891 What would best please our friend, in token of The sense of our great loss?âOur sighs and tears? Nay, these he fought against through all his years, Heroically voicing, high above Grief's ceaseless minor, moaning like a dove, The pÃ¦an triumphant that the soldier hears, Scaling the walls of death, midst shouts and cheers, The old Flag laughing in his eyes' last love. Nay, then, to pleasure him were it not meet To yield him bravely, as his fate arrives?â Drape him in radiant roses, head and feet, And be partakers, while his work survives, Of his fair fame,âpaying the tribute sweet To all humanityâour nobler lives.

Last I kind o' soothed him, so's He could talk.âAnd what you s'pose Them-air revelations of Poke's was? ...

Right here at home, boys, is the place, I guess, Fer me and you and plain old happiness: We hear the World's lots granderâlikely so,â We'll take the World's word fer it and not go.â We know its ways ain't our waysâso we'll stay Right here at home, boys, where we know the way. Right here at home, boys, where a well-to-do Man's plenty rich enoughâand knows it, too, And's got a' extry dollar, any time, To boost a feller up 'at wants to climb And's got the git-up in him to go in And git there, like he purt' nigh allus kin!

Right here at home, boysâjes' right where we air!â Birds don't sing any sweeter anywhere: Grass don't grow any greener'n she grows Acrost the pastur' where the old path goes,â All things in ear-shot's purty, er in sight, Right here at home, boys, ef we size 'em right. Right here at home, boys, where the old home-place Is sacerd to us as our mother's face, Jes' as we rickollect her, last she smiled And kissed usâdyin' so and rickonciled, Seein' us all at home hereânone astrayâ Right here at home, boys, where she sleeps to-day. LITTLE MARJORIE âWhere is little Marjorie?â There's the robin in the tree, With his gallant call once more From the boughs above the door! There's the bluebird's note, and there Are spring-voices everywhere Calling, calling ceaselesslyâ âWhere is little Marjorie?â And her old playmate, the rain, Calling at the window-pane In soft syllables that win Not her answer from withinâ âWhere is little Marjorie?ââ Or is it the rain, ah me! Or wild gusts of tears that were Calling usânot calling her! âWhere is little Marjorie?â Oh, in high security She is hidden from the reach Of all voices that beseech: She is where no troubled word, Sob or sigh is ever heard, Since God whispered tenderlyâ âWhere is little Marjorie?â KATHLEEN MAVOURNEEN 1892 [Frederick Nicholls Crouch, the Musical Genius and Composer of the world-known air âKathleen Mavourneen,â was, at above date, living, in helpless age, in his adopted country, Americaâa citizen since 1849.] Kathleen MAVOURNEEN! The song is still ringing As fresh and as clear as the trill of the birds; In world-weary hearts it is throbbing and singing In pathos too sweet for the tenderest words. Oh, have we forgotten the one who first breathed it? Oh, have we forgotten his rapturous artâ Our meed to the master whose genius bequeathed it? Oh, why art thou silent, thou Voice of the Heart?â Our meed to the master whose genius bequeathed itâ Oh, why are we silent, Kathleen Mavourneen! Kathleen Mavourneen! Thy lover still lingers; The long night is waning, the stars pale and few; Thy sad serenader, with tremulous fingers, Is bowed with his tears as the lily with dew; The old harp-strings quaver, the old voice is shaking; In sighs and in sobs moans the yearning refrain; The old vision dims, and the old heart is breaking ... Kathleen Mavourneen, inspire us again! The old vision dims, and the old heart is breaking: Oh, why are we silent, Kathleen Mavourneen! OLD JOHN HENRY Old John's jes' made o' the commonest stuffâ Old John Henryâ He's tough, I reckon,âbut none too toughâ Too tough though's better than not enough! Says old John Henry. He does his best, and when his best's bad, He don't fret none, ner he don't git sadâ He simply 'lows it's the best he had: Old John Henry! His doctern's jes' o' the plainest brandâ Old John Henryâ A smilin' face and a hearty hand 'S religen 'at all folks understand, Says old John Henry. He's stove up some with the rhumatiz, And they hain't no shine on them shoes o' his, And his hair hain't cutâbut his eye-teeth is: Old John Henry! He feeds hisse'f when the stock's all fedâ Old John Henryâ And sleeps like a babe when he goes to bedâ And dreams o' Heaven and home-made bread, Says old John Henry. He hain't refined as he'd ort to be To fit the statutes o' poetry, Ner his clothes don't fit himâbut he fits me: Old John Henry! BEING HIS MOTHER Being his mother,âwhen he goes away I would not hold him overlong, and so Sometimes my yielding sight of him grows O So quick of tears, I joy he did not stay To catch the faintest rumor of them! Nay, Leave always his eyes clear and glad, although Mine own, dear Lord, do fill to overflow; Let his remembered features, as I pray, Smile ever on me! Ah! what stress of love Thou givest me to guard with Thee thiswise: Its fullest speech ever to be denied Mine ownâbeing his mother! All thereof Thou knowest only, looking from the skies As when not Christ alone was crucified. GREEN FIELDS AND RUNNING BROOKS Ho! green fields and running brooks! Knotted strings and fishing-hooks Of the truant, stealing down Weedy back-ways of the town. Where the sunshine overlooks, By green fields and running brooks, All intruding guests of chance With a golden tolerance. Cooing doves, or pensive pair Of picnickers, straying thereâ By green fields and running brooks, Sylvan shades and mossy nooks! AndâO Dreamer of the Days, Murmurer of roundelays All unsung of words or books, Sing green fields and running brooks! SOME SCATTERING REMARKS OF BUB'S Wunst I tooked our pepper-box lid An' cut little pie-dough biscuits, I did, An' cooked 'em on our stove one day When our hired girl she said I may. Honey's the goodest thingâOo-ooh! An' blackburry-pies is goodest, too! But wite hot biscuits, ist soakin' wet Wiv tree-mullasus, is goodest yet! Miss Maimie she's my Ma's friend,âan' She's purtiest girl in all the lan'!â An' sweetest smile an' voice an' faceâ An' eyes ist looks like p'serves tas'e'! I ruther go to the Circus-show; But, 'cause my parunts told me so, I ruther go to the Sund'y-school, 'Cause there I learn the goldun rule. Say, Pa,âwhat is the goldun rule 'At's allus at the Sund'y-school? BY HER WHITE BED By her white bed I muse a little space: She fell asleepânot very long ago,â And yet the grass was here and not the snowâ The leaf, the bud, the blossom, andâher face!â Midsummer's heaven above us, and the grace Of Love's own day, from dawn to afterglow; The fireflies' glimmering, and the sweet and low Plaint of the whippoorwills, and every place In thicker twilight for the roses' scent. Then night.âShe sleptâin such tranquillity, I walk atiptoe still, nor dare to weep, Feeling, in all this hush, she rests contentâ That though God stood to wake her for me, she Would mutely plead: âNay, Lord! Let him so sleep.â HOW JOHN QUIT THE FARM Nobody on the old farm here but Mother, me and John, Except, of course, the extry he'p when harvest-time come on,â And then, I want to say to you, we needed he'p about, As you'd admit, ef you'd 'a' seen the way the crops turned out! A better quarter-section ner a richer soil warn't found Than this-here old-home place o' ourn fer fifty miles around!â The house was smallâbut plenty-big we found it from the day That Johnâour only livin' sonâpacked up and went away. You see, we tuk sich pride in Johnâhis mother more'n meâ That's natchurul; but both of us was proud as proud could be; Fer the boy, from a little chap, was most oncommon bright, And seemed in work as well as play to take the same delight. He allus went a-whistlin' round the place, as glad at heart As robins up at five o'clock to git an airly start; And many a time 'fore daylight Mother's waked me up to sayâ âJes' listen, David!âlisten!âJohnny's beat the birds to-day!â High-sperited from boyhood, with a most inquirin' turn,â He wanted to learn ever'thing on earth they was to learn: He'd ast more plaguy questions in a mortal-minute here Than his grandpap in Paradise could answer in a year! And read! w'y, his own mother learnt him how to read and spell; And âThe Childern of the Abbeyââw'y, he knowed that book as well At fifteen as his parents!âand âThe Pilgrim's Progress,â tooâ Jes' knuckled down, the shaver did, and read 'em through and through! At eighteen, Mother 'lowed the boy must have a better chanceâ That we ort to educate him, under any circumstance; And John he j'ned his mother, and they dingdonged and kep' on, Tel I sent him off to school in town, half glad that he was gone. ButâI missed himâw'y, of course I did!âThe Fall and Winter through I never built the kitchen fire, er split a stick in two, Er fed the stock, er butchered, er swung up a gambrel-pin, But what I thought o' John, and wished that he was home ag'in. He'd come, sometimesâon Sund'ys mostâand stay the Sund'y out; And on Thanksgivin'-Day he 'peared to like to be about: But a change was workin' on himâhe was stiller than before, And didn't joke, ner laugh, ner sing and whistle any more. And his talk was all so proper; and I noticed, with a sigh, He was tryin' to raise side-whiskers, and had on a stipÃ¨d tie, And a standin'-collar, ironed up as stiff and slick as bone; And a breastpin, and a watch and chain and plughat of his own. But when Spring-weather opened out, and John was to come home And he'p me through the season, I was glad to see him come; But my happiness, that evening, with the settin' sun went down, When he bragged of âa positionâ that was offered him in town. âBut,â says I, âyou'll not accept it?â âW'y, of course I will,â says he.â âThis drudgin' on a farm,â he says, âis not the life fer me; I've set my stakes up higher,â he continued, light and gay, âAnd town's the place fer me, and I'm a-goin' right away!â And go he did!âhis mother clingin' to him at the gate, A-pleadin' and a-cryin'; but it hadn't any weight. I was tranquiller, and told her 'twarn't no use to worry so, And onclasped her arms from round his neck round mineâand let him go! I felt a little bitter feelin' foolin' round about The aidges of my conscience; but I didn't let it out;â I simply retch out, trimbly-like, and tuk the boy's hand, And though I didn't say a word, I knowed he'd understand. Andâwell!âsence then the old home here was mighty lonesome, shore! With we a-workin' in the field, and Mother at the door, Her face ferever to'rds the town, and fadin' more and moreâ Her only son nine miles away, a-clerkin' in a store! The weeks and months dragged by us; and sometimes the boy would write A letter to his mother, sayin' that his work was light, And not to feel oneasy about his health a bitâ Though his business was confinin', he was gittin' used to it. And sometimes he would write and ast how I was gittin' on, And ef I had to pay out much fer he'p sence he was gone; And how the hogs was doin', and the balance of the stock, And talk on fer a page er two jes' like he used to talk. And he wrote, along 'fore harvest, that he guessed he would git home, Fer business would, of course, be dull in town.âBut didn't come:â We got a postal later, sayin' when they had no trade They filled the time âinvoicin' goods,â and that was why he stayed. And then he quit a-writin' altogether: Not a wordâ Exceptin' what the neighbers brung who'd been to town and heard What store John was clerkin' in, and went round to inquire If they could buy their goods there less and sell their produce higher. And so the Summer faded out, and Autumn wore away, And a keener Winter never fetched around Thanksgivin'-Day! The night before that day of thanks I'll never quite fergit, The wind a-howlin' round the houseâit makes me creepy yit! And there set me and Motherâme a-twistin' at the prongs Of a green scrub-ellum forestick with a vicious pair of tongs, And Mother sayin', âDavid! David!â in a' undertone, As though she thought that I was thinkin' bad-words unbeknown. âI've dressed the turkey, David, fer to-morrow,â Mother said, A-tryin' to wedge some pleasant subject in my stubborn head,â âAnd the mince-meat I'm a-mixin' is perfection mighty nigh; And the pound-cake is delicious-richââ âWho'll eat 'em?â I-says-I. âThe cramberries is drippin'-sweet,â says Mother, runnin' on, P'tendin' not to hear me;ââand somehow I thought of John All the time they was a-jellin'âfer you know they allus was His favoriteâhe likes 'em so!â Says I, âWell, s'pose he does?â âOh, nothin' much!â says Mother, with a quiet sort o' smileâ âThis gentleman behind my cheer may tell you after while!â And as I turnt and looked around, some one riz up and leant And putt his arms round Mother's neck, and laughed in low content. âIt's me,â he saysââyour fool-boy John, come back to shake your hand; Set down with you, and talk with you, and make you understand How dearer yit than all the world is this old home that we Will spend Thanksgivin' in fer lifeâjes' Mother, you and me!â Nobody on the old farm here but Mother, me and John, Except, of course, the extry he'p when harvest-time comes on; And then, I want to say to you, we need sich he'p about, As you'd admit, ef you could see the way the crops turns out! HIS MOTHER'S WAY Tomps 'ud allus haf to say Somepin' 'bout âhis Mother's way.ââ He lived hard-likeânever j'ined Any church of any kind.â âIt was Mother's way,â says he, âTo be good enough fer me And her too,âand cert'inly Lord has heerd her pray!â Propped up on his dyin' bed,â âShore as Heaven's overhead, I'm a-goin' there,â he saidâ âIt was Mother's way.â THE HOOSIER FOLK-CHILD The Hoosier Folk-Childâall unsungâ Unlettered all of mind and tongue; Unmastered, unmolestedâmade Most wholly frank and unafraid: Untaught of any schoolâunvexed Of law or creedâall unperplexedâ Unsermoned, ay, and undefiled, An all imperfect-perfect childâ A type which (Heaven forgive us!) you And I do tardy honor to, And so profane the sanctities Of our most sacred memories. Who, growing thus from boy to man, That dares not be American? Go, Pride, with prudent underbuzzâ Go whistle! as the Folk-Child does. The Hoosier Folk-Child's world is not Much wider than the stable-lot Between the house and highway fence That bounds the home his father rents. His playmates mostly are the ducks And chickens, and the boy that âshucks Corn by the shock,â and talks of town, And whether eggs are âupâ or âdown,â And prophesies in boastful tone Of âowning horses of his own,â And âbeing his own man,â and âwhen He gets to be, what he'll do then.ââ Takes out his jack-knife dreamily And makes the Folk-Child two or three Crude corn-stalk figures,âa wee span Of horses and a little man. The Hoosier Folk-Child's eyes are wise And wide and round as brownies' eyes: The smile they wear is ever blent With all-expectant wonderment,â On homeliest things they bend a look As rapt as o'er a picture-book, And seem to ask, whate'er befall, The happy reason of it all:â Why grass is all so glad a green, And leavesâand what their lispings mean;â Why buds grow on the boughs, and why They burst in blossom by and byâ As though the orchard in the breeze Had shook and popped its pop-corn trees, To lure and whet, as well they might, Some seven-league giant's appetite! The Hoosier Folk-Child's chubby face Has scant refinement, caste or grace,â From crown to chin, and cheek to cheek, It bears the grimy water-streak Of rinsings such as some long rain Might drool across the window-pane Wherethrough he peers, with troubled frown, As some lorn team drives by for town. His brow is elfed with wispish hair, With tangles in it here and there, As though the warlocks snarled it so At midmirk when the moon sagged low, And boughs did toss and skreek and shake, And children moaned themselves awake, With fingers clutched, and starting sight Blind as the blackness of the night! The Hoosier Folk-Child!âRich is he In all the wealth of poverty! He owns nor title nor estate, Nor speech but half articulate,â He owns nor princely robe nor crown;â Yet, draped in patched and faded brown, He owns the bird-songs of the hillsâ The laughter of the April rills; And his are all the diamonds set In Morning's dewy coronet,â And his the Dusk's first minted stars That twinkle through the pasture-bars And litter all the skies at night With glittering scraps of silver light;â The rainbow's bar, from rim to rim, In beaten gold, belongs to him. THEIR SWEET SORROW They meet to say farewell: Their way Of saying this is hard to say.â He holds her hand an instant, wholly Distressedâand she unclasps it slowly. He bends his gaze evasively Over the printed page that she Recurs to, with a new-moon shoulder Glimpsed from the lace-mists that infold her. The clock, beneath its crystal cup, Discreetly clicksââQuick! Act! Speak up!â A tension circles both her slender Wristsâand her raised eyes flash in splendor, Even as he feels his dazzled own.â Then, blindingly, round either thrown, They feel a stress of arms that ever Strain tremblinglyâand âNever! Never!â Is whispered brokenly, with half A sob, like a belated laugh,â While cloyingly their blurred kiss closes,â Sweet as the dew's lip to the rose's. DAWN, NOON AND DEWFALL I Dawn, noon and dewfall! Bluebird and robin Up and at it airly, and the orchard-blossoms bobbin'! Peekin' from the winder, half awake, and wishin' I could go to sleep ag'in as well as go a-fishin'! II On the apern o' the dam, legs a-danglin' over, Drowsy-like with sound o' worter and the smell o' clover: Fish all out a-visitin'â'cept some dratted minnor! Yes, and mill shet down at last and hands is gone to dinner. III Trompin' home acrost the fields: Lightnin'-bugs a-blinkin' In the wheat like sparks o' things feller keeps a-thinkin':â Mother waitin' supper, and the childern there to cherr me; And fiddle on the kitchen wall a-jes' a-eechin' fer me! LONGFELLOW The winds have talked with him confidingly; The trees have whispered to him; and the night Hath held him gently as a mother might, And taught him all sad tones of melody: The mountains have bowed to him; and the sea, In clamorous waves, and murmurs exquisite, Hath told him all her sorrow and delightâ Her legends fairâher darkest mystery. His verse blooms like a flower, night and day; Bees cluster round his rhymes; and twitterings Of lark and swallow, in an endless May, Are mingling with the tender songs he sings.â Nor shall he cease to singâin every lay Of Nature's voice he singsâand will alway. HIS VIGIL Close the book and dim the light, I shall read no more to-night. NoâI am not sleepy, dearâ Do not go: sit by me here In the darkness and the deep Silence of the watch I keep. Something in your presence so Soothes meâas in long ago I first felt your handâas nowâ In the darkness touch my brow: I've no other wish than you Thus should fold mine eyelids to, Saying naught of sigh or tearâ Just as God were sitting here. THE QUARREL They faced each other: Topaz-brown And lambent burned her eyes and shot Sharp flame at his of amethyst.â âI hate you! Go, and be forgot As death forgets!â their glitter hissed (So seemed it) in their hatred. Ho! Dared any mortal front her so?â Tempestuous eyebrows knitted downâ Tense nostril, mouthâno muscle slack,â And blackâthe suffocating blackâ The stifling blackness of her frown! Ah! but the lifted face of her! And the twitched lip and tilted head! Yet he did neither wince nor stir,â Onlyâhis hands clenched; and, instead Of words, he answered with a stare That stammered not in aught it said, As might his voice if trusted there. And whatâwhat spake his steady gaze?â Was there a look that harshly fell To scoff her?âor a syllable Of anger?âor the bitter phrase That myrrhs the honey of love's lips, Or curdles blood as poison-drips? What made their breasts to heave and swell As billows under bows of ships In broken seas on stormy days? We may not knowânor they indeedâ What mercy found them in their need. A sudden sunlight smote the gloom; And round about them swept a breeze, With faint breaths as of clover-bloom; A bird was heard, through drone of bees,â Then, far and clear and eerily, A child's voice from an orchard-treeâ Then laughter, sweet as the perfume Of lilacs, could the hearing see. And heâO Love! he fed thy name On bruisÃ¨d kisses, while her dim Deep eyes, with all their inner flame, Like drowning gems were turned on him. JOHN BROWN Writ in between the lines of his life-deed We trace the sacred service of a heart Answering the Divine command, in every part Bearing on human weal: His love did feed The loveless; and his gentle hands did lead The blind, and lift the weak, and balm the smart Of other wounds than rankled at the dart In his own breast, that gloried thus to bleed. He served the lowliest firstânay, then aloneâ The most despisÃ¨d that e'er wreaked vain breath In cries of suppliance in the reign whereat Red Guilt sate squat upon her spattered throne.â For these doomed there it was he went to death. God! how the merest man loves one like that! GO, WINTER! Go, Winter! Go thy ways! We want again The twitter of the bluebird and the wren; Leaves ever greener growing, and the shine Of Summer's sunânot thine.â Thy sun, which mocks our need of warmth and love And all the heartening fervencies thereof, It scarce hath heat enow to warm our thin Pathetic yearnings in. So get thee from us! We are cold, God wot, Even as thou art.âWe remember not How blithe we hailed thy coming.âThat was O Too longâtoo long ago! Get from us utterly! Ho! Summer then Shall spread her grasses where thy snows have been, And thy last icy footprint melt and mold In her first marigold. THANKSGIVING Let us be thankfulânot alone because Since last our universal thanks were told We have grown greater in the world's applause, And fortune's newer smiles surpass the oldâ But thankful for all things that come as alms From out the open hand of Providence:â The winter clouds and stormsâthe summer calmsâ The sleepless dreadâthe drowse of indolence. Let us be thankfulâthankful for the prayers Whose gracious answers were long, long delayed, That they might fall upon us unawares, And bless us, as in greater need we prayed. Let us be thankful for the loyal hand That love held out in welcome to our own, When love and only love could understand The need of touches we had never known. Let us be thankful for the longing eyes That gave their secret to us as they wept, Yet in return found, with a sweet surprise, Love's touch upon their lids, and, smiling, slept. And let us, too, be thankful that the tears Of sorrow have not all been drained away, That through them still, for all the coming years, We may look on the dead face of To-day. AUTUMN As a harvester, at dusk, Faring down some wooded trail Leading homeward through the musk Of May-apple and papaw, Hazel-bush and spice and haw,â So comes Autumn, swart and hale, Drooped of frame and slow of stride, But withal an air of pride Looming up in stature far Higher than his shoulders are; Weary both in arm and limb, Yet the wholesome heart of him Sheer at rest and satisfied. Greet him as with glee of drums And glad cymbals, as he comes! Robe him fair, O Rain and Shine! He the Emperorâthe Kingâ Royal lord of everything Sagging Plenty's granary floors And out-bulging all her doors; He the god of corn and wine, Honey, milk, and fruit and oilâ Lord of feast, as lord of toilâ Jocund host of yours and mine! Ho! the revel of his laugh!â Half is sound of winds, and half Roar of ruddy blazes drawn Up the throats of chimneys wide, Circling which, from side to side, Facesâlit as by the Dawn, With her highest tintings on Tip of nose, and cheek, and chinâ Smile at some old fairy tale Of enchanted lovers, in Silken gown and coat of mail, With a retinue of elves Merry as their very selves, Trooping ever, hand in hand, Down the dales of Wonderland. Then the glory of his song!â Lifting up his dreamy eyesâ Singing haze across the skies; Singing clouds that trail along Towering tops of trees that seize Tufts of them to stanch the breeze; Singing slanted strands of rain In between the sky and earth, For the lyre to mate the mirth And the might of his refrain: Singing southward-flying birds Down to us, and afterwards Singing them to flight again: Singing blushes to the cheeks Of the leaves upon the treesâ Singing on and changing these Into pallor, slowly wrought, Till the little, moaning creeks Bear them to their last farewell, As Elaine, the lovable, Was borne down to Lancelot.â Singing drip of tears, and then Drying them with smiles again. Singing apple, peach and grape, Into roundest, plumpest shape; Rosy ripeness to the face Of the pippin; and the grace Of the dainty stamen-tip To the huge bulk of the pear, Pendent in the green caress Of the leaves, and glowing through With the tawny laziness Of the gold that Ophir knew,â Haply, too, within its rind Such a cleft as bees may find, Bungling on it half aware, And wherein to see them sip, Fancy lifts an oozy lip, And the singer's falter there. Sweet as swallows swimming through Eddyings of dusk and dew, Singing happy scenes of home Back to sight of eager eyes That have longed for them to come, Till their coming is surprise Uttered only by the rush Of quick tears and prayerful hush: Singing on, in clearer key, Hearty palms of you and me Into grasps that tingle still Rapturous, and ever will! Singing twank and twang of stringsâ Trill of flute and clarinet In a melody that rings Like the tunes we used to play, And our dreams are playing yet! Singing lovers, long astray, Each to each; and, sweeter things,â Singing in their marriage-day, And a banquet holding all These delights for festival. JOHN ALDEN AND PERCILLY We got up a Christmas-doin's Last Christmas Eveâ Kind o' dimonstration 'At I railly believe Give more satisfactionâ Take it up and downâ Than airy intertainment Ever come to town! Railly was a theaterâ That's what it was,â But, bein' in the church, you know, We had a âSanty Clausââ So's to git the old folks To patternize, you see, And back the institootion up Kind o' morally. School-teacher writ the thingâ (Was a friend o' mine) Got it out o' Longfeller's Pome âEvangelineââ Er somersâ'bout the Purituns.â Anyway, the part âJohn Aldenâ fell to meâ And learnt it all by heart! Claircy was âPercillyââ (School-teacher 'lowed Me and her could act them two Best of all the crowd)â Thenâblame' ef he didn't Git her Pap, i jing!â To take the part o' âSanty Claus,â To wind up the thing. Law! the fun o' practisun!â Was a week er two Me and Claircy didn't have Nothin' else to do!â Kep' us jes' a-meetin' round, Kind o' here and there, Ever' night rehearsin'-like, And gaddin' ever'where! Game was wo'th the candle, though!â Christmas Eve at last Rolled around.âAnd 'tendance jes' Couldn't been su'passed!â Neighbers from the country Come from Clay and Rushâ Yes, and 'crost the county-line Clean from Puckerbrush! Meetin'-house jes' trimbled As âOld Santyâ went Round amongst the childern, With their pepperment And sassafrac and wintergreen Candy, and âa ball O' pop-corn,â the preacher 'nounced, âFree fer each and all!â School-teacher suddently Whispered in my ear,â âGuess I got you:âChristmas-gift!â Christmas is here!â I give him a gold pen, And case to hold the thing.â And Claircy whispered, âChristmas-gift!â And I give her a ring. âAnd now,â says I, âjes' watch meâ Christmas-gift,â says I, âI'm a-goin' to git oneâ âSanty'sâ comin' by!ââ Then I rech' and grabbed him: And, as you'll infer, 'Course I got the old man's, And he gimme her! THE RHYMES OF IRONQUILL I've allus heldâtill jest of lateâ That Poetry and me Got on best, not to 'sociateâ That is, most poetry; But t'other day my son-in-law, Miltâbe'n in town to millâ Fetched home a present-like, fer Ma,â The Rhymes of Ironquill. Milt ust to teach; and, 'course, his views Ranks over common sense;â That's biased me, till I refuse 'Most all he rickommends.â But Ma she read and read along And cried, like women will, About that âWasherwoman's Songâ In Rhymes of Ironquill. And then she made me read the thing, And found my specs and all: And I jest leant back thereâi jing!â My cheer ag'inst the wallâ And read and read, and read and read, All to myse'fâontil I lit the lamp and went to bed With Rhymes of Ironquill! I propped myse'f up there, andâdurn!â I never shet an eye Till daylight!âhogged the whole concern Tee-total, mighty nigh!â I'd sigh sometimes, and cry sometimes, Er laugh jest fit to killâ Clean captured-like with them-air rhymes O' that-air Ironquill! Read that-un 'bout old âMarmatonâ 'At hain't be'n ever âsizedâ In Song beforeâand yit's rolled on Jest same as 'postrophized!â Putt me in mind o' our old crick At Freeportâand the millâ And Hinchman's Fordâtill jest homesickâ Them Rhymes of Ironquill! Read that-un, too, 'bout âGame o' Whist,â And likenin' Life to fun Like thatâand playin' out yer fist, However cards is run: And them âTobacker-Stemmers' Songâ They sung with sich a will Down 'mongst the misery and wrongâ In Rhymes of Ironquill. And old John Brown, who broke the sod Of freedom's faller field And sowed his heart there, thankin' God Pore slaves would git the yieldâ Rained his last tears fer them and us To irrigate and till A crop of Song as glorious As Rhymes of Ironquill. Andâsergeant, died there in the War, 'At talked, out of his head ... He went âback to the Violet Star,â I'll betâjest like he said!â Yer Wars kin riddle bone and flesh, And blow out brains, and spill Life-blood,âbut Somepin' lives on, fresh As Rhymes of Ironquill! THE CURSE OF THE WANDERING FOOT All hope of rest withdrawn me! What dread command hath put This awful curse upon meâ The curse of the wandering foot? Forward and backward and thither, And hither and you againâ Wandering ever! And whither? Answer them, God's Amen. The blue skies are far o'er meâ The bleak fields near below: Where the mother that bore me?â Where her grave in the snow?â Glad in her trough of a coffinâ The sad eyes frozen shut That wept so often, often, The curse of the wandering foot! Here in your marts I care not Whatsoever ye think. Good folk many who dare not Give me to eat and drink: Give me to sup of your pityâ Feast me on prayers!âO ye, Met I your Christ in the city, He would fare forth with meâ Forward and onward and thither, And hither again and yon, With milk for our drink together And honey to feed uponâ Nor hope of rest withdrawn us, Since the one Father put The blessÃ¨d curse upon usâ The curse of the wandering foot. AS MY UNCLE UST TO SAY I've thought a power on men and thingsâ As my uncle ust to say,â And ef folks don't work as they pray, i jings! W'y, they ain't no use to pray! Ef you want somepin', and jes' dead-set A-pleadin' fer it with both eyes wet, And tears won't bring it, w'y, you try sweat, As my uncle ust to say. They's some don't know their A, B, C'sâ As my uncle ust to sayâ And yit don't waste no candle-grease, Ner whistle their lives away! But ef they can't write no book, ner rhyme No ringin' song fer to last all time, They can blaze the way fer âthe march sublime,â As my uncle ust to say. Whoever's Foreman of all things here, As my uncle ust to say, He knows each job 'at we're best fit fer, And our round-up, night and day: And a-sizin' His work, east and west, And north and south, and worst and best, I ain't got nothin' to suggest, As my uncle ust to say. WHITTIERâAT NEWBURYPORT SEPTEMBER 7, 1892 Hail to thee, with all good cheer! Though men say thou liest here Dead, And mourn, all uncomforted. By thy faith refining mine, Life still lights those eyes of thine, Clear As the Autumn atmosphere. Ever still thy smile appears As the rainbow of thy tears Bent O'er thy love's vast firmament. Thou endurestâshalt endure, Purely, as thy song is pure. Hear Thus my hail: Good cheer! good cheer! ROSAMOND C. BAILEY Thou brave, good woman! Loved of every one; Not only that in singing thou didst fill Our thirsty hearts with sweetness, trill on trill, Even as a wild bird singing in the sunâ Not only that in all thy carols none But held some tincturing of tears to thrill Our gentler natures, and to quicken still Our human sympathies; but thou hast won Our equal love and reverence because That thou wast ever mindful of the poor, And thou wast ever faithful to thy friends. So, loving, serving all, thy best applause Thy requiemâthe vast throng at the door Of the old church, with mute prayers and amens. TENNYSON ENGLAND, OCTOBER 5, 1892 We of the New World clasp hands with the Old In newer fervor and with firmer hold And nobler fellowship,â O Master Singer, with the finger-tip Of Death laid thus on thy melodious lip! All ages thou hast honored with thine art, And ages yet unborn thou wilt be part Of all songs pure and true! Thine now the universal homage due From Old and New Worldâay, and still The New! MRS. BENJAMIN HARRISON Washington, October 25, 1892 Now utter calm and rest; Hands folded o'er the breast In peace the placidest, All trials past; All fever soothedâall pain Annulled in heart and brain Never to vex againâ She sleeps at last. She sleeps; but O most dear And best beloved of her Ye sleep notânay, nor stir, Save but to bow The closer each to each, With sobs and broken speech, That all in vain beseech Her answer now. And lo! we weep with you, One grief the wide world through: Yet with the faith she knew We see her still, Even as here she stoodâ All that was pure and good And sweet in womanhoodâ God's will her will. THE POEMS HERE AT HOME The Poems here at Home!âWho'll write 'em down, Jes' as they airâin Country and in Town?â Sowed thick as clods is 'crost the fields and lanes, Er these-'ere little hop-toads when it rains!â Who'll âvoiceâ 'em? as I heerd a feller say âAt speechified on Freedom, t'other day, And soared the Eagle tel, it 'peared to me, She wasn't bigger'n a bumblebee! Who'll sort 'em out and set 'em down, says I, 'At's got a stiddy hand enough to try To do 'em jestice 'thout a-foolin' some, And headin' facts off when they want to come?â Who's got the lovin' eye, and heart, and brain To reco'nize 'at nothin's made in vainâ 'At the Good Bein' made the bees and birds And brutes first choice, and us-folks afterwards? What We want, as I sense it, in the line O' poetry is somepin' Yours and Mineâ Somepin' with live stock in it, and out-doors, And old crick-bottoms, snags, and sycamores: Putt weeds inâpizen-vines, and underbresh, As well as johnny-jump-ups, all so fresh And sassy-like!âand groun'-squir'ls,âyes, and âWe,â As sayin' is,ââWe, Us and Company!â Putt in old Nature's sermonts,âthem's the best,â And 'casion'ly hang up a hornets' nest 'At boys 'at's run away from school can git At handy-likeâand let 'em tackle it! Let us be wrought on, of a truth, to feel Our proneness fer to hurt more than we heal, In ministratin' to our vain delightsâ Fergittin' even insec's has their rights! No âLadies' Amaranth,â ner âTreasuryâ bookâ Ner âNight Thoughts,â nutherâner no âLally Rookâ! We want some poetry 'at's to Our taste, Made out o' truck 'at's jes' a-goin' to waste 'Cause smart folks thinks it's altogether too Outrageous commonâ'cept fer me and you!â Which goes to argy, all sich poetry Is 'bliged to rest its hopes on You and Me. LITTLE COUSIN JASPER Little Cousin Jasper, he Don't live in this town, like me,â He lives 'way to Rensselaer, An' ist comes to visit here. He says 'at our court-house square Ain't nigh big as theirn is there!â He says their town's big as four Er five towns like this, an' more! He says ef his folks moved here He'd cry to leave Rensselaerâ 'Cause they's prairies there, an' lakes, An' wile-ducks an' rattlesnakes! Yes, 'n' little Jasper's Pa Shoots most things you ever saw!â Wunst he shot a deer, one day, 'At swummed off an' got away. Little Cousin Jasper went An' camped out wunst in a tent Wiv his Pa, an' helt his gun While he kilt a turrapun. An' when his Ma heerd o' that, An' more things his Pa's bin at, She says, âYes, 'n' he'll git shot 'Fore he's man-grown, like as not!â An' they's mussrats there, an' minks, An' di-dippers, an' chee-winks,â Yes, 'n' cal'mus-root you chew All up an' 't 'on't pizen you!

Yes, 'n' Jasper he says they Got a brass band there, an' play On it, an' march up an' down An' all over round the town! Wisht our town ain't like it is!â Wisht it's ist as big as his! Wisht 'at his folks they'd move here, An' we'd move to Rensselaer! THE DOODLE-BUGS'S CHARM When Uncle Sidney he comes hereâ An' Fred an' me an' Min,â My Ma she says she bet you yet The roof'll tumble in! Fer Uncle he ist romps with us: An' wunst, out in our shed, He telled us 'bout the Doodle-Bugs, An' what they'll do, he said, Ef you'll ist holler âDoodle-Bugs!ââ Out by our garden-bedâ âDoodle-Bugs! Doodle-Bugs! Come up an' git some bread!â Ain't Uncle Sidney funny man?â âHe's childish 'most as meââ My Ma sometimes she tells him thatâ âHe ac's so foolishly!â W'y, wunst, out in our garden-path, Wite by the pie-plant bed, He all sprawled out there in the dirt An' ist scrooched down his head, An' âDoodle! Doodle! Doodle-Bugs!â My Uncle Sidney said,â âDoodle-Bugs! Doodle-Bugs! Come up an' git some bread!â An' nen he showed us little holes All bored there in the ground, An' little weenty heaps o' dust 'At's piled there all around: An' Uncle said, when he's like us, Er purt' nigh big as Fred, That wuz the Doodle-Bugs's Charmâ To call 'em up, he said:â âDoodle!

Come up an' git some bread!â âHOME AG'INâ I'm a-feelin' ruther sad, Fer a father proud and glad As I amâmy only child Home, and all so rickonciled! Feel so strange-like, and don't know What the mischief ails me so! 'Stid o' bad, I ort to be Feelin' good pertickerlyâ Yes, and extry thankful, too, 'Cause my nearest kith-and-kin, My Elviry's schoolin' 's through, And I' got her home ag'inâ Home ag'in with me! Same as ef her mother'd been Livin', I have done my best By the girl, and watchfulest; Nussed herâkeerful' as I couldâ From a baby, day and night,â Drawin' on the neighberhood And the women-folks as light As needsessity 'ud 'lowâ 'Cept in âteethin',â onc't, and fight Through black-measles. Don't know now How we ever saved the child! Doc he'd give her up, and said, As I stood there by the bed Sort o' foolin' with her hair On the hot, wet pillar there, âWuz no use!ââAnd at them-air Very words she waked and smiledâ Yes, and knowed me. And that's where I broke down, and simply jes' Bellered like a boyâI guess!â Women claim I did, but I Allus helt I didn't cry, But wuz laughin',âand I wuz,â Men don't cry like women does! Well, right then and there I felt 'T'uz her mother's doin's, and, Jes' like to myse'f, I knelt Whisperin', âI understand.â ... So I've raised her, you might say, Stric'ly in the narrer way 'At her mother walked thereinâ Not so quite religiously, Yit still strivin'-like to do Ever'thing a father could Do he knowed the mother would Ef she'd livedâAnd now all's through And I' got her home ag'inâ Home ag'in with me! And I' been so lonesome, too, Here o' late, especially,â âOld Aunt Abigail,â you know, Ain't no company;âand so Jes' the hired hand, you seeâ Jonasâlike a relative Moreâsence he come here to live With us, nigh ten year' ago. Still he don't count much, you know, In the way o' companyâ Lonesome, 'peared-like, 'most as me! So, as I say, I' been so Special lonesome-like and blue, With Elviry, like she's been, 'Way so much, last two or three Year'âBut now she's home ag'inâ Home ag'in with me! Driv in fer her yisterday, Me and Jonasâgay and spry,â We jes' cut up, all the way!â Yes, and sung!âtel, blame it! I Keyed my voice up 'bout as high As whenâdays 'at I wuz youngâ âBuckwheat-notesâ wuz all they sung. Jonas bantered me, and 'greed To sing one 'at town-folks sing Down at Split Stump 'er High-Lowâ Some new âballet,â said, 'at he'd Learntâabout âThe Grape-vine Swing.â And when he quit, I begun To chune up my voice and run Through the what's-called âscalesâ and âdo- Sol-me-fa'sâ I ust to knowâ Then let loose old favorite one, âHunters o' Kentucky!â My! Tel I thought the boy would die! And we both laughedâYes, and still Heerd more laughin', top the hill; Fer we'd missed Elviry's train, And she'd lit out 'crost the fields,â Dewdrops dancin' at her heels, And cut up old Smoots's lane So's to meet us. And there in Shadder o' the chinkypin, With a danglin' dogwood-bough Bloomin' 'bove herâSee her now!â Sunshine sort o' flickerin' down And a kind o' laughin' all Round her new red parasol, Tryin' to git at her!âwellâlike I jumped out and showed 'em howâ Yes, and jes' the place to strike That-air mouth o' hernâas sweet As the blossoms breshed her brow Er sweet-williams round her feetâ White and blushy, too, as she âHowdiedâ up to Jonas, and Jieuked her head, and waved her hand. âHey!â says I, as she bounced in The spring-wagon, reachin' back To give me a lift, âwhoop-ee!â I-says-ee, âyou're home ag'inâ Home ag'in with me!â Lord! how wild she wuz, and glad, Gittin' home!âand things she had To inquire about, and talkâ Plowin', plantin' and the stockâ News o' neighberhood; and how Wuz the Deem-girls doin' now, Sence that-air young chicken-hawk They was âtamin'â soared away With their settin'-hen, one day?â (Said she'd got Mame's postal-card 'Bout it, very day 'at she Started home from Bethany.)

W'y, I set There and et, and et, and et!â Jes' et on, tel Jonas he Pushed his chair back, laughed, and says, âI could walk his log!â and we All laughed then, tel 'Viry she Lit the lampâand I give in!â Riz and kissed her: âHeaven bless You!â says Iââyou're home ag'inâ Same old dimple in your chin, Same white apern,â I-says-ee, âSame sweet girl, and good to see As your mother ust to be,â And I' got you home ag'inâ Home ag'in with me!â I turns then to go on by her Through the doorâand see her eyes Both wuz swimmin', and she tries To say somepin'âcan'tâand so Grabs and hugs and lets me go. Noticed Aunty'd made a fire In the settin'-room and gone Back where her p'serves wuz on Bilin' in the kitchen. I Went out on the porch and set, Thinkin'-like.

The sailor he sails the sea: I wish he would capture A little sea-horse And send him home to me. I wish, as he sails Through the tropical gales, He would catch me a sea-bird, too, With its silver wings And the song it sings, And its breast of down and dew! I wish he would catch me a Little mermaid, Some island where he lands, With her dripping curls, And her crown of pearls, And the looking-glass in her hands! Hail! Ho! Sail! Ho! Sail far o'er the fabulous main! And if I were a sailor, I'd sail with you, Though I never sailed back again. THE DEAD WIFE Always I see her in a saintly guise Of lilied raiment, white as her own brow When first I kissed the tear-drops to the eyes That smile forever now. Those gentle eyes!

THREE SINGING FRIENDS I LEE O. HARRIS Schoolmaster and Songmaster! Memory Enshrines thee with an equal love, for thy Duality of gifts,âthy pure and high EndowmentsâLearning rare, and Poesy. These were as mutual handmaids, serving thee, Throughout all seasons of the years gone by, With all enduring joys 'twixt earth and skyâ In turn shared nobly with thy friends and me. Thus is it that thy clear song, ringing on, Is endless inspiration, fresh and free As the old Mays at verge of June sunshine; And musical as then, at dewy dawn, The robin hailed us, and all twinklingly Our one path wandered under wood and vine. II BENJ. S. PARKER Thy rapt song makes of Earth a realm of light And shadow mystical as some dreamland Arched with unfathomed azureâvast and grand With splendor of the morn; or dazzling bright With orient noon; or strewn with stars of night Thick as the daisies blown in grasses fanned By odorous midsummer breezes and Showered over by all bird-songs exquisite. This is thy voice's beatific artâ To make melodious all things below, Calling through them, from far, diviner space, Thy clearer hail to us.âThe faltering heart Thou cheerest; and thy fellow mortal so Fares onward under Heaven with lifted face. III JAMES NEWTON MATTHEWS Bard of our Western world!âits prairies wide, With edging woods, lost creeks and hidden ways; Its isolated farms, with roundelays Of orchard warblers heard on every side; Its cross-road schoolhouse, wherein still abide Thy fondest memories,âsince there thy gaze First fell on classic verse; and thou, in praise Of that, didst find thine own song glorified. So singing, smite the strings and counterchange The lucently melodious drippings of Thy happy harp, from airs of âTempe Vale,â To chirp and trill of lowliest flight and range, In praise of our To-day and home and loveâ Thou meadow-lark no less than nightingale. AT HIS WINTRY TENT SAMUEL RICHARDSâARTISTâDENVER, COLORADO Not only master of his art was he, But master of his spiritâwinged indeed For lordliest height, yet poised for lowliest need Of those, alas! upheld less buoyantly. He gloried even in adversity, And won his country's plaudits, and the meed Of Old World praise, as one loath to succeed While others were denied like victory. Though passed, I count him still my master-friend, Invincible as through his mortal fight,â The laughing light of faith still in his eye As, at his wintry tent, pitched at the end Of life, he gaily called to me âGood night, Old friend, good nightâfor there is no good-by.â UP AND DOWN OLD BRANDYWINE Up and down old Brandywine, In the days 'at's past and goneâ With a dad-burn hook-and-line And a saplin'-poleâi swawn!

The Twilight folds her gloom Full tenderly about the drowsy Day, And all his tinseled hours of light and bloom Like toys are laid away. Sleep! sleep! The noon-sky's airy cloud of white Has deepened wide o'er all the azure plain; And, trailing through the leaves, the skirts of Night Are wet with dews as rain. But rest thou sweetly, smiling in thy dreams, With round fists tossed like roses o'er thy head, And thy tranc'd lips and eyelids kissed with gleams Of rapture perfected. THE CIRCUS PARADE The Circus!âThe Circus!âThe throb of the drums, And the blare of the horns, as the Band-wagon comes; The clash and the clang of the cymbals that beat, As the glittering pageant winds down the long street! In the Circus parade there is glory clean down From the first spangled horse to the mule of the Clown, With the gleam and the glint and the glamour and glare Of the days of enchantment all glimmering there! And there are the banners of silvery fold Caressing the winds with their fringes of gold, And their high-lifted standards, with spear-tips aglow, And the helmeted knights that go riding below. There's the Chariot, wrought of some marvelous shell The Sea gave to Neptune, first washing it well With its fabulous waters of gold, till it gleams Like the galleon rare of an Argonaut's dreams. And the Elephant, too, (with his undulant stride That rocks the high throne of a king in his pride), That in jungles of India shook from his flanks The tigers that leapt from the Jujubee-banks. Here's the long, ever-changing, mysterious line Of the Cages, with hints of their glories divine From the barred little windows, cut high in the rear Where the close-hidden animals' noses appear. Here's the Pyramid-car, with its splendor and flash, And the Goddess on high, in a hot-scarlet sash And a pen-wiper skirt!âO the rarest of sights Is this âQueen of the Airâ in cerulean tights! Then the far-away clash of the cymbals, and then The swoon of the tune ere it wakens again With the capering tones of the gallant cornet That go dancing away in a mad minuet. The Circus!âThe Circus!âThe throb of the drums, And the blare of the horns, as the Band-wagon comes; The clash and the clang of the cymbals that beat, As the glittering pageant winds down the long street. FOLKS AT LONESOMEVILLE Pore-folks lives at Lonesomevilleâ Lawzy! but they're pore Houses with no winders in, And hardly any door: Chimbly all tore down, and no Smoke in that at allâ Ist a stovepipe through a hole In the kitchen wall! Pump 'at's got no handle on; And no wood-shedâAnd, wooh!â Mighty cold there, choppin' wood, Like pore-folks has to do!â Winter-time, and snow and sleet Ist fairly fit to kill!â Hope to goodness Santy Claus Goes to Lonesomeville! THE THREE JOLLY HUNTERS O there were three jolly hunters; And a-hunting they did go, With a spaniel-dog, and a pointer-dog, And a setter-dog also. Looky there! And they hunted and they hal-looed; And the first thing they did find Was a dingling-dangling hornet's-nest A-swinging in the wind. Looky there! And the first one saidââWhat is it?â Said the next, âWe'll punch and seeâ: And the next one said, a mile from there, âI wish we'd let it be!â Looky there! And they hunted and they hal-looed; And the next thing they did raise Was a bobbin' bunny cottontail That vanished from their gaze. Looky there! One said it was a hot baseball, Zipped through the brambly thatch, But the others said 'twas a note by post, Or a telegraph-despatch. Looky there! So they hunted and they hal-looed; And the next thing they did sight Was a great big bulldog chasing them, And a farmer, hollerin' âSkite!â Looky there! And the first one said, âHi-jinktum!â And the next, âHi-jinktum-jee!â And the last one said, âThem very words Had just occurred to me!â Looky there! THE LITTLE DOG-WOGGY A little Dog-Woggy Once walked round the World: So he shut up his house; and, forgetting His two puppy-children Locked in there, he curled Up his tail in pink bombazine netting, And set out To walk round The World. He walked to Chicago, And heard of the Fairâ Walked on to New York, where he never,â In fact, he discovered That many folks there Thought less of Chicago than ever, As he musing- Ly walked round The World. He walked on to Boston, And round Bunker Hill, Bow-wowed, but no citizen heerd himâ Till he ordered his baggage And called for his bill, And then, bless their souls! how they cheered him As he gladly Walked on round The World. He walked and walked on For a year and a dayâ Dropped down at his own door and panted, Till a teamster came driving Along the highway And told him that house there was ha'nted By the two starveâ Dest pups in The World. CHARMS I FOR CORNS AND THINGS Prune your corn in the gray of the morn With a blade that's shaved the dead, And barefoot go and hide it so The rain will rust it red: Dip your foot in the dew and put A print of it on the floor, And stew the fat of a brindle cat, And say this o'er and o'er:â Corny! morny! blady! dead!

THE TRESTLE AND THE BUCK-SAW The Trestle and the Buck-Saw Went out a-walking once, And stayed away and stayed away For days and weeks and months: And when they got back home again, Of all that had occurred, The neighbors said the gossips said They never said a word.

THE GREAT EXPLORER He sailed o'er the weltery watery miles For a tabular year-and-a-day, To the kindless, kinkable Cannibal Isles He sailed and he sailed away! He captured a loon in a wild lagoon, And a yak that weeps and smiles, And a bustard-bird, and a blue baboon, In the kindless Cannibal Isles And wilds Of the kinkable Cannibal Isles. He swiped in bats with his butterfly-net, In the kindless Cannibal Isles And got short-waisted and over-het In the haunts of the crocodiles; And nine or ten little Pigmy Men Of the quaintest shapes and styles He shipped back home to his old Aunt Jenn, From the kindless Cannibal Isles And wilds Of the kinkable Cannibal Isles.

ALBUMANIA Some certain misty yet tenable signs Of the oracular Raggedy Man, Happily found in these fugitive lines Culled from the Album of 'Lizabuth Ann. FRIENDSHIP O friendship, when I muse on you, As thoughtful minds, O Friendship, do, I muse, O Friendship, o'er and o'er, O Friendshipâas I said before. LIFE âWhat is Life?â If the Dead might say, 'Spect they'd answer, under breath, Sorry-like yet a-laughin':âA Poor pale yesterday of Death! LIFE'S HAPPIEST HOURS Best, I guess, Was the old âRecess.ââ 'Way back there's where I'd love to beâ Shet of each lesson and hateful rule, When the whole round World was as sweet to me As the big ripe apple I brung to School. MARION-COUNTY MAN HOMESICK ABROAD I, who had hobnobbed with the shades of kings, And canvassed grasses from old masters' graves, And in cathedrals stood and looked at things In niches, crypts and naves;â My heavy heart was sagging with its woe, Nor Hope to prop it up, nor Promise, nor One woman's handsâand O I wanted so To be felt sorry for! BIRDY! BIRDY! The Redbreast loves the blooming boughâ The Bluebird loves it same as he;â And as they sit and sing there now, So do I sing to theeâ Only, dear heart, unlike the birds, I do not climb a tree To singâ I do not climb a tree.

Cheep! Cheep!â Only in the winter-time Do they ever stop, In the chip-and-splinter-time, When the backlogs pop,â Then it is, the kettle-lids, While the sparkles leap, Lisp like the katydids,â âCheep! Cheep! Cheep!â HOME-MADE RIDDLES ALL BUT THE ANSWERS I No one ever saw it Till I dug it from the ground; I found it when I lost it, And lost it when I found: I washed it, and dressed it, And buried it once moreâ Dug it up, and loved it then Better than before. I was paid for finding itâ I don't know why or how,â But I lost, found, and kept it, And haven't got it now. II Sometimes it's all aloneâ Sometimes in a crowd; It says a thousand bright things, But never talks aloud. Everybody loves it, And likes to have it call. But if you shouldn't happen to, It wouldn't care at all. First you see or hear of it, It's a-singing,âthen You may look and listen, But it never sings again. THE LOVELY CHILD Lilies are both pure and fair, Growing 'midst the roses thereâ Roses, too, both red and pink, Are quite beautiful, I think.

Like a flashing sun-ray, Flitting everywhere: Dangling down the tall weeds And the hollyhocks, And the lordly sunflowers Along the garden-walks. Ho! my gallant Golden-bill, Pecking 'mongst the weeds, You must have for breakfast Golden flower-seeds: Won't you tell a little fellow What you have for tea?â 'Spect a peck o' yellow, mellow Pippin on the tree.

A FEEL IN THE CHRIS'MAS-AIR They's a kind o' feel in the air, to me, When the Chris'mas-times sets in, That's about as much of a mystery As ever I've run ag'in'!â Fer instunce, now, whilse I gain in weight And gineral health, I swear They's a goneness somers I can't quite stateâ A kind o' feel in the air! They's a feel in the Chris'mas-air goes right To the spot where a man lives at!â It gives a feller a' appetiteâ They ain't no doubt about that!â And yit they's somepin'âI don't know whatâ That follers me, here and there, And ha'nts and worries and spares me notâ A kind o' feel in the air!

Is it the racket the childern raise?â W'y, no!âGod bless 'em!âno!â Is it the eyes and the cheeks ablazeâ Like my own wuz, long ago?â Is it the bleat o' the whistle and beat O' the little toy-drum and blare O' the horn?âNo! no!âit is jest the sweetâ The sad-sweet feel in the air.

JORDAN, APRIL 29, 1895 All sudden she hath ceased to sing, Hushed in eternal slumbering, And we make moan that she is dead.â Nay; peace! be comforted. Between her singing and her tears She pauses, listeningâand she hears The Song we can not hear.âAnd thus She mutely pities us. Could she speak out, we doubt not she Would turn to us full tenderly, And in the old melodious voice Say: âWeep not, but rejoice.â Ay, musical as waters run In woodland rills through shade and sun, The sweet voice would flow on and say,â âBe glad with me to-day.â âYour Earth was very dear and fair To meâthe groves and grasses there; The bursting buds and blossomsâO I always loved them so!â âThe very dews within them seemed Reflected by mine eyes and gleamed Adown my cheeks in what you knew As âtears,â and not as dew. âYour birds, too, in the orchard-boughsâ I could not hear them from the house, But I must leave my work and stray Out in the open day âAnd the illimitable range Of their vast freedomâalways strange And new to meâIt pierced my heart With sweetness as a dart!â âThe singing! singing! singing!âAll The trees bloomed blossoms musical That chirped and trilled in colors till My whole soul seemed to fill âTo overflow with music, so That I have found me kneeling low Midst the lush grass, with murmurous words Thanking the flowers and birds. âSo with the ones to me most dearâ I loved them, as I love them Here: Bear with my memory, therefore, As when in days of yore, âO friends of mine, ye praised the note Of some song, quavering from my throat Out of the overstress of love And all the pain thereof. âAnd ye, too, do I love with this Same loveâand Heaven knows all it is,â The birds' song in itâbud and bloomâ The turf, but not the tomb.â Between her singing and her tears She pauses, listeningâand she hears The Song we can not hear.âAnd thus She mutely pities us. THE GREEN GRASS OF OLD IRELAND The green grass av owld Ireland! Whilst I be far away, All fresh an' clean an' jewel-green It's growin' there to-day.

For still the more I'm stoppin' here, The more I'm sore to see The glory av the green grass av owld Ireland. Ten years ye've paid my airnin'sâ I've the l'avin's on the shelf, Though I be here widout a queen An' own meself meself: I'm comin' over steerage, But I'm goin' back firrst-class, Patrollin' av the foremost deck For firrst sight av the grass. God bless yez, free Ameriky! I love yez, dock an' shore! I kem to yez in poverty That's worstin' me no more But most I'm lovin' Erin yet, Wid all her graves, d'ye see, By reason av the green grass av owld Ireland. A PEACE-HYMN OF THE REPUBLIC LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY, SEPTEMBER 12, 1895: TWENTY-NINTH ENCAMPMENT, G. A. R. There's a Voice across the Nation like a mighty ocean-hail, Borne up from out the Southward as the seas before the gale; Its breath is in the streaming Flag and in the flying sailâ As we go sailing on. 'Tis a Voice that we rememberâere its summons soothed as nowâ When it rang in battle-challenge, and we answered vow with vow,â With roar of gun and hiss of sword and crash of prow and prow, As we went sailing on. Our hope sank, even as we saw the sun sink faint and far,â The Ship of State went groping through the blinding smoke of Warâ Through blackest midnight lurching, all uncheered of moon or star, Yet sailingâsailing on. As One who spake the dead awake, with life-blood leaping warmâ Who walked the troubled waters, all unscathed, in mortal form,â We felt our Pilot's presence with His hand upon the storm, As we went sailing on. O Voice of passion lulled to peace, this dawning of To-dayâ O Voices twain now blent as one, ye sing all fears away, Since foe and foe are friends, and lo! the Lord, as glad as they.â He sends us sailing on. MY DANCIN'-DAYS IS OVER What is it in old fiddle-chunes 'at makes me ketch my breath And ripples up my backbone tel I'm tickled most to death?â Kind o' like that sweet-sick feelin', in the long sweep of a swing, The first you ever swung in, with yer first sweetheart, i jing!â Yer first picnicâyer first ice-creamâyer first o' ever'thing 'At happened 'fore yer dancin'-days wuz over! I never understood itâand I s'pose I never can,â But right in town here, yisterd'y I heard a pore blind man A-fiddlin' old âGray EagleââAnd-sir! I jes' stopped my load O' hay and listened at himâyes, and watched the way he âbow'd,ââ And back I went, plum forty year', with boys and girls I knowed And loved, long 'fore my dancin'-days wuz over!â At high noon in yer city,âwith yer blame' Magnetic-Cars A-hummin' and a-screetchin' pastâand bands and G. A. R.'s A-marchin'âand fire-ingines.âAll the noise, the whole street through, Wuz lost on me!âI only heard a whipperwill er two, It 'peared-like, kind o' callin' 'crost the darkness and the dew, Them nights afore my dancin'-days wuz over. 'T'uz Chused'y-night at Wetherell's, er We'n'sd'y-night at Strawn's, Er Fourth-o'-July-night at uther Tomps's house er John's!â With old Lew Church from Sugar Crick, with that old fiddle he Had sawed clean through the Army, from Atlanty to the seaâ And yit he'd fetched her home ag'in, so's he could play fer me Onc't more afore my dancin'-days wuz over! The woods 'at's all be'n cut away wuz growin' same as then; The youngsters all wuz boys ag'in 'at's now all oldish men; And all the girls 'at then wuz girlsâI saw 'em, one and all, As plain as thenâthe middle-sized, the short-and-fat, and tallâ And 'peared-like, I danced âTuckerâ fer 'em up and down the wall Jes' like afore my dancin'-days wuz over! The facts is, I wuz dazed so 'at I clean fergot jes' where I railly wuz,âa-blockin' streets, and still a-standin' there: I heard the po-leece yellin', but my ears wuz kind o' blurredâ My eyes, too, fer the odds o' that,âbekase I thought I heard My wife 'at's dead a-laughin'-like, and jokin', word-fer-word Jes' like afore her dancin'-days wuz over. EUGENE FIELD With gentlest tears, no less than jubilee Of blithest joy, we heard him, and still hear Him singing on, with full voice, pure and clear, Uplifted, as some classic melody In sweetest legends of old minstrelsy; Or, swarming Elfin-like upon the ear, His airy notes make all the atmosphere One blur of bird and bee and lullaby. His tribute:âLuster in the faded bloom Of cheeks of old, old mothers; and the fall Of gracious dews in eyes long dry and dim; And hope in lover's pathways midst perfume Of woodland haunts; andâmeed exceeding all,â The love of little children laurels him. DREAM-MARCH Wasn't it a funny dream!âperfectly bewild'rin'!â Last night, and night before, and night before that, Seemed like I saw the march o' regiments o' children, Marching to the robin's fife and cricket's rat-ta-tat! Lily-banners overhead, with the dew upon 'em, On flashed the little army, as with sword and flame; Like the buzz o' bumble-wings, with the honey on 'em, Came an eery, cheery chant, chiming as it came:â Where go the children? Traveling! Traveling! Where go the children, traveling ahead? Some go to kindergarten; some go to day-school; Some go to night-school; and some go to bed! Smooth roads or rough roads, warm or winter weather, On go the children, towhead and brown, Brave boys and brave girls, rank and file together, Marching out of Morning-Land, over dale and down: Some go a-gipsying out in country placesâ Out through the orchards, with blossoms on the boughs Wild, sweet, and pink and white as their own glad faces; And some go, at evening, calling home the cows. Where go the children? Traveling! Traveling! Where go the children, traveling ahead? Some go to foreign wars, and camps by the firelightâ Some go to glory so; and some go to bed! Some go through grassy lanes leading to the cityâ Thinner grow the green trees and thicker grows the dust; Ever, though, to little people any path is pretty So it leads to newer lands, as they know it must. Some go to singing less; some go to list'ning; Some go to thinking over ever-nobler themes; Some go anhungered, but ever bravely whistling, Turning never home again only in their dreams. Where go the children? Traveling! Traveling! Where go the children, traveling ahead? Some go to conquer things; some go to try them; Some go to dream them; and some go to bed! A CHRISTMAS MEMORY Pa he bringed me here to stay 'Til my Ma she's well.âAn' nen He's go' hitch up, Chris'mus-day, An' come take me back again Wher' my Ma's at! Won't I be Tickled when he comes fer me! My Ma an' my A'nty they 'Uz each-uvver's sisters. Paâ A'nty telled me, th' other day,â He comed here an' married Ma. ...

This-here house o' A'nty's wher' They 'uz bornedâmy Ma an' her!â An' her Ma 'uz my Ma's Ma, An' her Pa 'uz my Ma's Paâ Ain't that funny?âAn' they're dead: An' this-here's âth' ole Homestead.ââ An' my A'nty said, an' cried, It's mine, too, ef my Ma diedâ Don't know what she meanâ'cause my Ma she's nuvver go' to die! When Pa bringed me here 't'uz nightâ 'Way dark night! An' A'nty spread Me a pieceâan' light the light An' say I must go to bed.â I cry not toâbut Pa said, âBe good boy now, like you telled Mommy 'at you're go' to be!â An', when he 'uz kissin' me My good night, his cheek's all wet An' taste salty.âAn' he held Wite close to me an' rocked some An' laughed-likeâ'til A'nty come Git me while he's rockin' yet.

Don't want Santy Clausâner things Any kind he ever brings!â Don't want A'ntyâDon't want Pa!â I ist only want my Ma! TO ALMON KEEFER INSCRIBED IN âTALES OF THE OCEANâ This first book that I ever knew Was read aloud to me by youâ Friend of my boyhood, therefore take It back from me, for old times' sakeâ The selfsame âTalesâ first read to me, Under âthe old sweet apple tree,â Ere I myself could read such great Big words,âbut listening all elate, At your interpreting, until Brain, heart and soul were all athrill With wonder, awe, and sheer excess Of wildest childish happiness. So take the book againâforget All else,âlong years, lost hopes, regret; Sighs for the joys we ne'er attain, Prayers we have lifted all in vain; Tears for the faces seen no more, Once as the roses at the door! Take the enchanted bookâAnd lo, On grassy swards of long ago, Sprawl out again, beneath the shade The breezy old-home orchard made, The veriest barefoot boy indeedâ And I will listen as you read. LITTLE MAID-O'-DREAMS Little Maid-o'-Dreams, with your Eery eyes so clear and pure Gazing, where we fain would see Into far futurity,â Tell us what you there behold, In your visions manifold! What is on beyond our sight, Biding till the morrow's light, Fairer than we see to-day, As our dull eyes only may? Little Maid-o'-Dreams, with face Like as in some woodland place Lifts a lily, chaste and white, From the shadow to the light;â Tell us, by your subtler glance, What strange sorcery enchants You as now,âhere, yet afar As the realms of moon and star?â Have you magic lamp and ring, And genii for vassaling? Little Maid-o'-Dreams, confess You're divine and nothing less,â For with mortal palms, we fear, Yet must pet you, dreaming hereâ Yearning, too, to lift the tips Of your fingers to our lips; Fearful still you may rebel, High and heav'nly oracle! Thus, though all unmeet our kiss, Pardon this!âand this!âand this! Little Maid-o'-Dreams, we call Truce and favor, knowing all!â All your magic is, in truth, Pure foresight and faith of youthâ You're a child, yet even so, You're a sage, in embryoâ Prescient poetâartistâgreat As your dreams anticipate.â Trusting God and Man, you do Just as Heaven inspires you to. EDGAR WILSON NYE FEBRUARY 22, 1896 The saddest silence falls when Laughter lays Finger on lip, and falteringly breaks The glad voice into dying minor shakes And quavers, lorn as airs the wind-harp plays At urge of drearest Winter's bleakest days: A troubled hush, in which all hope forsakes Us, and the yearning upstrained vision aches With tears that drown e'en heaven from our gaze. Such silenceâafter such glad merriment! O prince of halest humor, wit and cheer! Could you yet speak to us, I doubt not we Should catch your voice, still blithely eloquent Above all murmurings of sorrow here, Calling your love back to us laughingly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME VII CASSANDER âCassander! O Cassander!ââher mother's voice seems cle'r As ever, from the old back-porch, a-hollerin' fer herâ Especially in airly Springâlike May, two year' agoâ Last time she hollered fer her,âand Cassander didn't hear! Cassander was so chirpy-like and sociable and free, And good to ever'body, and wuz even good to me Though I wuz jes' a commonâwell, a farm-hand, don't you know, A-workin' on her father's place, as pore as pore could be! Her bein' jes' a' only child, Cassander had her way A good-'eal more'n other girls; and neighbers ust to say She looked most like her Mother, but wuz turned most like her Pap,â Except he had no use fer town-folks thenâner yit to-day! I can't claim she incouraged me: She'd let me drive her in To town sometimes, on Saturd'ys, and fetch her home ag'in, Tel onc't she 'scused âOld Mollâ and me,âand some blame' city-chap, He driv her home, two-forty style, in face o' kith-and-kin. She even tried to make him stay fer supper, but I 'low He must 'a' kind o' 'spicioned some objections.âAnyhow, Her mother callin' at her, whilst her father stood and shook His fist,âthe town-chap turnt his team and made his partin' bow. âCassander! You, Cassander!ââhear her mother jes' as plain, And see Cassander blushin' like the peach tree down the lane, Whilse I sneaked on apast her, with a sort o' hang-dog look, A-feelin' cheap as sorghum and as green as sugarcane! (You see, I'd skooted when she met her town-beauâwhen, in fact, Ef I'd had sense I'd stayed fer her.âBut sense wuz what I lacked! So I'd cut home ahead o' her, so's I could tell 'em what Wuz keepin' her. Andâyou know how a jealous fool'll act!) I past her, I wuz sayin',âbut she never turnt her head; I swallered-like and cle'red my th'oatâbut that wuz all I said; And whilse I hoped fer some word back, it wuzn't what I got.â That girl'll not stay stiller on the day she's layin' dead! Well, that-air silence lasted!âUst to listen ever' day I'd be at work and hear her mother callin' thataway; I'd sight Cassander, mayby, cuttin' home acrost the blue And drizzly fields; but nary answerânary word to say! Putt in about two weeks o' thatâtwo weeks o' rain and mud, Er mostly so: I couldn't plow. The old crick like a flood: And, lonesome as a borried dog, I'd wade them old woods throughâ The dogwood blossoms white as snow, and redbuds red as blood. Last time her mother called herâsich a morning like as now: The robins and the bluebirds, and the blossoms on the boughâ And this wuz yit 'fore brekfust, with the sun out at his best, And hosses kickin' in the barnâand dry enough to plow. âCassander! O Cassander!â ... And her only answerâWhat?â A letter, twisted round the cook-stove damper, smokin'-hot, A-statin': âI wuz married on that day of all the rest, The day my husband fetched me homeâef you ain't all fergot!â âCassander! O Cassander!â seems, allus, 'long in May, I hear her mother callin' herâa-callin', night and dayâ âCassander! O Cassander!â allus callin', as I say, âCassander; O Cassander!â jes' a-callin' thataway. A CHILD-WORLD PROEM The Child-Worldâlong and long since lost to viewâ A Fairy Paradise!â How always fair it was and fresh and newâ How every affluent hour heaped heart and eyes With treasures of surprise! Enchantments tangible: The under-brink Of dawns that launched the sight Up seas of gold: The dewdrop on the pink, With all the green earth in it and blue height Of heavens infinite: The liquid, dripping songs of orchard-birdsâ The wee bass of the bees,â With lucent deeps of silence afterwards; The gay, clandestine whisperings of the breeze And glad leaves of the trees. O Child-World: After this worldâjust as when I found you first sufficed My soulmost needâif I found you again, With all my childish dream so realized, I should not be surprised. THE CHILD-WORLD A child-world, yet a wondrous world no less, To those who knew its boundless happiness. A simple old frame houseâeight rooms in allâ Set just one side the center of a small But very hopeful Indiana town,â The upper story looking squarely down Upon the main street, and the main highway From East to West,âhistoric in its day, Known as The National Roadâold-timers, all Who linger yet, will happily recall It as the scheme and handiwork, as well As property, of âUncle Sam,â and tell Of its importance, âlong and long afore Railroads wuz ever dreamp' of!ââFurthermore, The reminiscent first inhabitants Will make that old road blossom with romance Of snowy caravans, in long parade Of covered vehicles, of every grade From ox-cart of most primitive design, To Conestoga wagons, with their fine Deep-chested six-horse teams, in heavy gear, High hames and chiming bellsâto childish ear And eye entrancing as the glittering train Of some sun-smitten pageant of old Spain. And, in like spirit, haply they will tell You of the roadside forests, and the yell Of âwolfsâ and âpainters,â in the long night-ride, And âscreechin' catamountsâ on every side.â Of stage-coach days, highwaymen, and strange crimes, And yet unriddled mysteries of the times Called âGood Old.â âAnd why âGood Oldâ?â once a rare Old chronicler was asked, who brushed the hair Out of his twinkling eyes and said,ââWell, John, They're âgood old timesâ because they're dead and gone!â The old home site was portioned into three Distinctive lots. The front oneânatively Facing to southward, broad and gaudy-fine With lilac, dahlia, rose, and flowering vineâ The dwelling stood in; and behind that, and Upon the alley north and south, left hand, The old woodhouse,âhalf, trimly stacked with wood, And half, a workshop, where a work-bench stood Steadfastly through all seasons.âOver it, Along the wall, hung compass, brace-and-bit, And square, and drawing-knife, and smoothing-planeâ And a little jack-plane, tooâthe children's vain Possession by pretenseâin fancy they Manipulating it in endless play, Turning out countless curls and loops of bright, Fine satin shavingsâRapture infinite! Shelved quilting-frames; the tool-chest; the old box Of refuse nails and screws; a rough gun-stock's Outline in âcurly mapleâ; and a pair Of clamps and old kraut-cutter hanging there. Some âpatterns,â in thin wood, of shield and scroll, Hung higher, with a neat âcane fishing-poleâ And careful tackleâall securely out Of reach of children, rummaging about. Beside the woodhouse, with broad branches free Yet close above the roof, an apple tree Known as âThe Prince's HarvestââMagic phrase! That was a boy's own tree, in many ways!â Its girth and height meet both for the caress Of his bare legs and his ambitiousness: And then its apples, humoring his whim, Seemed just to fairly hurry ripe for himâ Even in June, impetuous as he, They dropped to meet him, half-way up the tree. And O their bruised sweet faces where they fell!â And ho! the lips that feigned to âkiss them wellâ! âThe Old Sweet-Apple Tree,â a stalwart, stood In fairly sympathetic neighborhood Of this wild princeling with his early gold To toss about so lavishly nor hold In bounteous hoard to overbrim at once All Nature's lap when came the Autumn months. Under the spacious shade of this the eyes Of swinging children saw swift-changing skies Of blue and green, with sunshine shot between, And when âthe old cat diedâ they saw but green. And, then, there was a cherry tree.âWe all And severally will yet recall From our lost youth, in gentlest memory, The blessed factâThere was a cherry tree. There was a cherry tree. Its bloomy snows Cool even now the fevered sight that knows No more its airy visions of pure joyâ As when you were a boy. There was a cherry tree. The Bluejay set His blue against its whiteâO blue as jet He seemed there then!âBut nowâWhoever knew He was so pale a blue! There was a cherry treeâOur child-eyes saw The miracle:âIts pure-white snows did thaw Into a crimson fruitage, far too sweet But for a boy to eat. There was a cherry tree, give thanks and joy!â There was a bloom of snowâThere was a boyâ There was a Bluejay of the realest blueâ And fruit for both of you. Then the old garden, with the apple trees Grouped round the margin, and âa stand of beesâ By the âwhite-winter-pearmainâ; and a row Of currant-bushes; and a quince or so. The old grape-arbor in the center, by The pathway to the stable, with the sty Behind it, and upon it, cootering flocks Of pigeons,âand the cutest âmartin-boxâ!â Made like a sure-enough houseâwith roof, and doors And windows in it, and veranda-floors And balusters all round itâyes, and at Each end a chimneyâpainted red at that And penciled white, to look like little bricks; And, to cap all the builder's cunning tricks, Two tiny little lightning-rods were run Straight up their sides, and twinkled in the sun. Who built it? Nay, no answer but a smile.â It may be you can guess who, after while. Home in his stall, âOld Sorrelâ munched his hay And oats and corn, and switched the flies away, In a repose of patience good to see, And earnest of the gentlest pedigree. With half-pathetic eye sometimes he gazed Upon the gambols of a colt that grazed Around the edges of the lot outside, And kicked at nothing suddenly, and tried To act grown-up and graceful and high-bred, But dropped, k'whop! and scraped the buggy-shed, Leaving a tuft of woolly, foxy hair Under the sharp end of a gate-hinge there. Then, all ignobly scrambling to his feet And whinnying a whinny like a bleat, He would pursue himself around the lot Andâdo the whole thing over, like as not! ... Ah! what a life of constant fear and dread And flop and squawk and flight the chickens led! Above the fences, either side, were seen The neighbor-houses, set in plots of green Dooryards and greener gardens, tree and wall Alike whitewashed, an order in it all: The scythe hooked in the tree-fork; and the spade And hoe and rake and shovel all, when laid Aside, were in their places, ready for The hand of either the possessor or Of any neighbor, welcome to the loan Of any tool he might not chance to own. THE OLD HOME-FOLKS Such was the Child-World of the long agoâ The little world these children used to know:â Johnty, the oldest, and the best, perhaps, Of the five happy little Hoosier chaps Inhabiting this wee world all their own.â Johnty, the leader, with his native tone Of grave commandâa general on parade Whose each punctilious order was obeyed By his proud followers. But Johnty yetâ After all serious dutiesâcould forget The gravity of life to the extent, At times, of kindling much astonishment About him: With a quick, observant eye, And mind and memory, he could supply The tamest incident with liveliest mirth; And at the most unlooked-for times on earth Was wont to break into some travesty On those around himâfeats of mimicry Of this one's trick of gestureâthat one's walkâ Or this one's laughâor that one's funny talk,â The way âthe watermelon-manâ would try His humor on town-folks that wouldn't buy;â How he drove into town at morningâthen At dusk (alas!) how he drove out again. Though these divertisements of Johnty's were Hailed with a hearty glee and relish, there Appeared a sense, on his part, of regretâ A spirit of remorse that would not let Him rest for days thereafter.âSuch times he, As some boy said, âjist got too overly Blame' good fer common boys like us, you know To 'sociate withâ'less'n we 'ud go And jine his church!â Next after Johnty came His little towhead brother, Bud by name.â And O how white his hair wasâand how thick His face with freckles,âand his ears, how quick And curious and intrusive!âAnd how pale The blue of his big eyes;âand how a tale Of Giants, Trolls or Fairies, bulged them still Bigger and bigger!âAnd when âJackâ would kill The old âFour-headed Giant,â Bud's big eyes Were swollen truly into giant-size. And Bud was apt in make-believesâwould hear His Grandma talk or read, with such an ear And memory of both subject and big words, That he would take the book up afterwards And feign to âread aloud,â with such success As caused his truthful elders real distress. But he must have big wordsâthey seemed to give Extremer range to the superlativeâ That was his passion. âMy Gran'ma,â he said, One evening, after listening as she read Some heavy old historical reviewâ With copious explanations thereunto Drawn out by his inquiring turn of mind,â âMy Gran'ma she's read all booksâever' kind They is, 'at tells all 'bout the land an' sea An' Nations of the Earth!âAn' she is the Historicul-est woman ever wuz!â (Forgive the verse's chuckling as it does In its erratic current.âOftentimes The little willowy water-brook of rhymes Must falter in its music, listening to The children laughing as they used to do.) Who shall sing a simple ditty all about the Willow, Dainty-fine and delicate as any bending spray That dandles high the happy bird that flutters there to trill a Tremulously tender song of greeting to the May. Bravest, too, of all the trees!ânone to match your daring,â First of greens to greet the Spring and lead in leafy sheen;â Ay, and you're the lastâalmost into winter wearing Still the leaf of loyaltyâstill the badge of green. Ah, my lovely Willow!âLet the Waters lilt your graces,â They alone with limpid kisses lave your leaves above, Flashing back your sylvan beauty, and in shady places Peering up with glimmering pebbles, like the eyes of love. Next, Maymie, with her hazy cloud of hair, And the blue skies of eyes beneath it there. Her dignified and âlittle ladyâ airs Of never either romping up the stairs Or falling down them; thoughtful every way Of others firstâThe kind of child at play That âgave up,â for the rest, the ripest pear Or peach or apple in the garden there Beneath the trees where swooped the airy swingâ She pushing it, too glad for anything! Or, in the character of hostess, she Would entertain her friends delightfully In her playhouse,âwith strips of carpet laid Along the garden-fence within the shade Of the old apple treesâwhere from next yard Came the two dearest friends in her regard, The little Crawford girls, Ella and Luâ As shy and lovely as the lilies grew In their idyllic home,âyet sometimes they Admitted Bud and Alex to their play, Who did their heavier work and helped them fix To have a âFestibulââand brought the bricks And built the âstove,â with a real fire and all, And stovepipe-joint for chimney, looming tall And wonderfully smokyâeven to Their childish aspirations, as it blew And swooped and swirled about them till their sight Was feverish even as their high delight. Then Alex, with his freckles, and his freaks Of temper, and the peach-bloom of his cheeks, And âamber-colored hairââhis mother said 'Twas that, when others laughed and called it âredâ And Alex threw things at themâtill they'd call A truce, agreeing â't'uzn't red ut-tall!â But Alex was affectionate beyond The average child, and was extremely fond Of the paternal relatives of his, Of whom he once made estimate like this:â âI'm only got two brothers,âbut my Pa He's got most brothers'n you ever saw!â He's got seben brothers!âYes, an' they're all my Seben Uncles!âUncle John, an' Jim,âan' I Got Uncle George, an' Uncle Andy, too, An' Uncle Frank, an' Uncle Joe.âAn' you Know Uncle Mart.âAn', all but him, they're great Big mens!âAn' nen's Aunt Sarahâshe makes eight!â I'm got eight uncles!â'cept Aunt Sarah can't Be ist my uncle 'cause she's ist my a'nt!â Then, next to Alexâand the last indeed Of these five little ones of whom you readâ Was baby Lizzie, with her velvet lisp,â As though her elfin lips had caught some wisp Of floss between them as they strove with speech, Which ever seemed just in, yet out of, reachâ Though what her lips missed, her dark eyes could say With looks that made her meaning clear as day. And, knowing now the children, you must know The father and the mother they loved so:â The father was a swarthy man, black-eyed, Black-haired, and high of forehead; and, beside The slender little mother, seemed in truth A very king of menâsince, from his youth, To his hale manhood nowâ(worthy as then,â A lawyer and a leading citizen Of the proud little town and county-seatâ His hopes his neighbors', and their fealty sweet)â He had known outdoor laborârain and shineâ Bleak Winter, and bland Summerâfoul and fine. So Nature had ennobled him and set Her symbol on him like a coronet: His lifted brow, and frank, reliant faceâ Superior of stature as of grace,â Even the children by the spell were wrought Up to heroics of their simple thought, And saw him, trim of build, and lithe and straight And tall, almost, as at the pasture-gate The towering ironweed the scythe had spared For their sakes, when The Hired Man declared It would grow on till it became a tree, With cocoanuts and monkeys inâmaybe! Yet, though the children, in their pride and awe And admiration of the father, saw A being so exaltedâeven more Like adoration was the love they bore The gentle mother.âHer mild, plaintive face Was purely fair, and haloed with a grace And sweetness luminous when joy made glad Her features with a smile; or saintly sad As twilight, fell the sympathetic gloom Of any childish grief, or as a room Were darkened suddenly, the curtain drawn Across the window and the sunshine gone. Her brow, below her fair hair's glimmering strands, Seemed meetest resting-place for blessing hands Or holiest touches of soft finger-tips And little rose-leaf cheeks and dewy lips. Though heavy household tasks were pitiless, No little waist or coat or checkered dress But knew her needle's deftness; and no skill Matched hers in shaping plait or flounce or frill; Or fashioning, in complicate design, All rich embroideries of leaf and vine, With tiniest twining tendril,âbud and bloom And fruit, so like, one's fancy caught perfume And dainty touch and taste of them, to see Their semblance wrought in such rare verity. Shrined in her sanctity of home and love, And love's fond service and reward thereof, Restore her thus, O blessed Memory!â Throned in her rocking-chair, and on her knee Her sewingâher work-basket on the floor Beside her,âSpring-time through the open door Balmily stealing in and all about The room; the bees' dim hum, and the far shout And laughter of the children at their play, And neighbor children from across the way Calling in gleeful challengeâsave alone One boy whose voice sends back no answering toneâ The boy, prone on the floor, above a book Of pictures, with a rapt, ecstatic lookâ Even as the mother's, by the selfsame spell, Is lifted, with a light ineffableâ As though her senses caught no mortal cry, But heard, instead, some poem going by. The Child-heart is so strange a little thingâ So mildâso timorously shy and small,â When grown-up hearts throb, it goes scampering Behind the wall, nor dares peer out at all!â It is the veriest mouse That hides in any houseâ So wild a little thing is any Child-heart! Child-heart!âmild heart!â Ho, my little wild heart!â Come up here to me out o' the dark, Or let me come to you! So lorn at times the Child-heart needs must be, With never one maturer heart for friend And comrade, whose tear-ripened sympathy And love might lend it comfort to the end,â Whose yearnings, aches and stings, Over poor little things Were pitiful as ever any Child-heart. Child-heart!âmild heart!â Ho, my little wild heart!â Come up here to me out o' the dark, Or let me come to you! Times, too, the little Child-heart must be gladâ Being so young, nor knowing, as we know, The fact from fantasy, the good from bad, The joy from woe, theâall that hurts us so! What wonder then that thus It hides away from us?â So weak a little thing is any Child-heart! Child-heart!âmild heart!â Ho, my little wild heart!â Come up here to me out o' the dark, Or let me come to you! Nay, little Child-heart, you have never need To fear us;âwe are weaker far than youâ 'Tis we who should be fearfulâwe indeed Should hide us, too, as darkly as you do,â Safe, as yourself, withdrawn, Hearing the World roar on Too wilful, woeful, awful for the Child-heart! Child-heart!âmild heart!â Ho, my little wild heart!â Come up here to me out o' the dark, Or let me come to you! The clock chats on confidingly; a rose Taps at the window, as the sunlight throws A brilliant, jostling checkerwork of shine And shadow, like a Persian-loom design, Across the home-made carpetâfades,âand then The dear old colors are themselves again. Sounds drop in visiting from everywhereâ The bluebird's and the robin's trill are there, Their sweet liquidity diluted some By dewy orchard-spaces they have come: Sounds of the town, too, and the great highwayâ The Mover-wagons' rumble, and the neigh Of over-traveled horses, and the bleat Of sheep and low of cattle through the streetâ A Nation's thoroughfare of hopes and fears, First blazed by the heroic pioneers Who gave up old-home idols and set face Toward the unbroken West, to found a race And tame a wilderness now mightier than All peoples and all tracts American. Blent with all outer sounds, the sounds within:â In mild remoteness falls the household din Of porch and kitchen: the dull jar and thump Of churning; and the âglung-glungâ of the pump, With sudden pad and skurry of bare feet Of little outlaws, in from field or street: The clang of kettle,ârasp of damper-ring And bang of cook-stove doorâand everything That jingles in a busy kitchen lifts Its individual wrangling voice and drifts In sweetest tinny, coppery, pewtery tone Of music hungry ear has ever known In wildest famished yearning and conceit Of youth, to just cut loose and eat and eat!â The zest of hunger still incited on To childish desperation by long-drawn Breaths of hot, steaming, wholesome things that stew And blubber, and uptilt the pot-lids, too, Filling the sense with zestful rumors of The dear old-fashioned dinners children love: Redolent savorings of home-cured meats, Potatoes, beans and cabbage; turnips, beets And parsnipsârarest composite entire That ever pushed a mortal child's desire To madness by new-grated fresh, keen, sharp Horseradishâtang that sets the lips awarp And watery, anticipating all The cloyed sweets of the glorious festival.â Still add the cinnamony, spicy scents Of clove, nutmeg, and myriad condiments In like-alluring whiffs that prophesy Of sweltering pudding, cake, and custard-pieâ The swooning-sweet aroma haunting all The houseâup-stairs and downâporch, parlor, hall And sitting-roomâinvading even where The Hired Man sniffs it in the orchard-air, And pauses in his pruning of the trees To note the sun minutely and toâsneeze. Then Cousin Rufus comesâthe children hear His hale voice in the old hall, ringing clear As any bell. Always he came with song Upon his lips and all the happy throng Of echoes following him, even as the crowd Of his admiring little kinsmenâproud To have a cousin grownâand yet as young Of soul and cheery as the songs he sung. He was a student of the lawâintent Soundly to win success, with all it meant; And so he studiedâeven as he played,â With all his heart: And so it was he made His gallant fight for fortuneâthrough all stress Of battle bearing him with cheeriness And wholesome valor. And the children had Another relative who kept them glad And joyous by his very merry waysâ As blithe and sunny as the summer days,â Their father's youngest brotherâUncle Mart. The old âArabian Nightsâ he knew by heartâ âBaron Munchausen,â too; and likewise âThe Swiss Family Robinson.ââAnd when these three Gave out, as he rehearsed them, he could go Straight on in the same lineâa steady flow Of arabesque invention that his good Old mother never clearly understood. He was to be a printerâwanted, though, To be an actor.âBut the world was âshowâ Enough for him,âtheatric, airy, gay,â Each day to him was jolly as a play. And some poetic symptoms, too, in sooth, Were certain.âAnd, from his apprentice youth, He joyed in verse-quotationsâwhich he took Out of the old âType Foundry Specimen Book.â He craved and courted most the favor of The children.âThey were foremost in his love; And pleasing them, he pleased his own boy-heart And kept it young and fresh in every part. So was it he devised for them and wrought To life his quaintest, most romantic thought:â Like some lone castaway in alien seas, He built a house up in the apple trees, Out in the corner of the garden, where No man-devouring native, prowling there, Might pounce upon them in the dead o' nightâ For lo, their little ladder, slim and light, They drew up after them. And it was known That Uncle Mart slipped up sometimes alone And drew the ladder in, to lie and moon Over some novel all the afternoon. And one time Johnty, from the crowd below,â Outraged to find themselves deserted soâ Threw bodily their old black cat up in The airy fastness, with much yowl and din Resulting, while a wild periphery Of cat went circling to another tree, And, in impassioned outburst, Uncle Mart Loomed up, and thus relieved his tragic heart: ââHence, long-tailed, ebon-eyed, nocturnal ranger! What led thee hither 'mongst the types and cases? Didst thou not know that running midnight races O'er standing types was fraught with imminent danger? Did hunger lead theeâdidst thou think to find Some rich old cheese to fill thy hungry maw? Vain hope! for none but literary jaw Can masticate our cookery for the mind!ââ So likewise when, with lordly air and grace, He strode to dinner, with a tragic face With ink-spots on it from the office, he Would aptly quote more âSpecimen-poetryââ Perchance like ââLabor's bread is sweet to eat, (Ahem!) And toothsome is the toiler's meat.ââ Ah, could you see them all, at lull of noon!â A sort of boisterous lull, with clink of spoon And clatter of deflecting knife, and plate Dropped saggingly, with its all-bounteous weight, And dragged in place voraciously; and then Pent exclamations, and the lull again.â The garland of glad faces round the boardâ Each member of the family restored To his or her place, with an extra chair Or two for the chance guests so often there.â The father's farmer-client, brought home from The court room, though he âdidn't want to come Tel he jist saw he hat to!â he'd explain, Invariably, time and time again, To the pleased wife and hostess, as she pressed Another cup of coffee on the guest.â Or there was Johnty's special chum, perchance, Or Bud's, or bothâeach childish countenance Lit with a higher glow of youthful glee, To be together thus unbrokenly,â Jim Offutt, or Eck Skinner, or George Carrâ The very nearest chums of Bud's these are,â So, very probably, one of the three, At least, is there with Bud, or ought to be. Like interchange the town-boys each had knownâ His playmate's dinner better than his ownâ Yet blest that he was ever made to stay At Almon Keefer's, any blessed day, For any meal! ... Visions of biscuits, hot And flaky-perfect, with the golden blot Of molten butter for the center, clear, Through pools of clover-honeyâdear-o-dear!â With creamy milk for its divine âfarewellâ: And then, if any one delectable Might yet exceed in sweetness, O restore The cherry-cobbler of the days of yore Made only by Al Keefer's mother!âWhy, The very thought of it ignites the eye Of memory with raptureâcloys the lip Of longing, till it seems to ooze and drip With veriest juice and stain and overwaste Of that most sweet delirium of taste That ever visited the childish tongue, Or proved, as now, the sweetest thing unsung. Ah, Almon Keefer! what a boy you were, With your back-tilted hat and careless hair, And open, honest, fresh, fair face and eyes With their all-varying looks of pleased surprise And joyous interest in flower and tree, And poising humming-bird, and maundering bee. The fields and woods he knew; the tireless tramp With gun and dog; and the night-fisher's campâ No other boy, save Bee Lineback, had won Such brilliant mastery of rod and gun. Even in his earliest childhood had he shown These traits that marked him as his father's own. Dogs all paid Almon honor and bow-wowed Allegiance, let him come in any crowd Of rabbit-hunting town-boys, even though His own dog âSleuthâ rebuked their acting so With jealous snarls and growlings. But the best Of Almon's virtuesâleading all the restâ Was his great love of books, and skill as well In reading them aloud, and by the spell Thereof enthralling his mute listeners, as They grouped about him in the orchard-grass, Hinging their bare shins in the mottled shine And shade, as they lay prone, or stretched supine Beneath their favorite tree, with dreamy eyes And Argo-fancies voyaging the skies. âTales of the Oceanâ was the name of one Old dog's-eared book that was surpassed by none Of all the glorious list.âIts back was gone, But its vitality went bravely on In such delicious tales of land and sea As may not ever perish utterly. Of still more dubious caste, âJack Sheppardâ drew Full admiration; and âDick Turpin,â too. And, painful as the fact is to convey, In certain lurid tales of their own day, These boys found thieving heroes and outlaws They hailed with equal fervor of applause: âThe League of the Miamiââwhy, the name Alone was fascinatingâis the same, In memory, this venerable hour Of moral wisdom shorn of all its power, As it unblushingly reverts to when The old barn was âthe Cave,â and hears again The signal blown, outside the buggy-shedâ The drowsy guard within uplifts his head, And ââWho goes there?ââ is called, in bated breathâ The challenge answered in a hush of death,â âSh!ââBarney Gray!ââ And then ââWhat do you seek?ââ ââStables of The League!ââ the voice comes spent and weak, For, ha! the Law is on the âChieftain'sâ trailâ Tracked to his very lair!âWell, what avail? The âsecret entranceâ opensâcloses.âSo The âRobber-Captainâ thus outwits his foe; And, safe once more within his âcavern-halls,â He shakes his clenched fist at the warped plankwalls And mutters his defiance through the cracks At the balked Enemy's retreating backs As the loud horde flees pell-mell down the lane, AndâAlmon Keefer is himself again! Excepting few, they were not books indeed Of deep import that Almon chose to read;â Less fact than fiction.âMuch he favored thoseâ If not in poetry, in hectic proseâ That made our native Indian a wild, Feathered and fine-preened hero that a child Could recommend as just about the thing To make a god of, or at least a king. Aside from Almon's own booksâtwo or threeâ His store of lore The Township Library Supplied him weekly: All the books with âor'sâ Subtitledâlured himâafter âIndian Wars,â And âLife of Daniel Boone,âânot to include Some few books spiced with humor,ââRobin Hoodâ And rare âDon Quixote.ââAnd one time he took âDadd's Cattle Doctor.â ... How he hugged the book And hurried homeward, with internal glee And humorous spasms of expectancy!â All this confessionâas he promptly made It, the day later, writhing in the shade Of the old apple tree with Johnty and Bud, Noey Bixler, and The Hired Handâ Was quite as funny as the book was not. ... O Wonderland of wayward Childhood! what An easy, breezy realm of summer calm And dreamy gleam and gloom and bloom and balm Thou art!âThe Lotus-Land the poet sung, It is the Child-World while the heart beats young. ... While the heart beats young!âO the splendor of the Spring, With all her dewy jewels on, is not so fair a thing! The fairest, rarest morning of the blossom-time of May Is not so sweet a season as the season of to-day While Youth's diviner climate folds and holds us, close caressed As we feel our mothers with us by the touch of face and breast;â Our bare feet in the meadows, and our fancies up among The airy clouds of morningâwhile the heart beats young. While the heart beats young and our pulses leap and dance, With every day a holiday and life a glad romance,â We hear the birds with wonder, and with wonder watch their flightâ Standing still the more enchanted, both of hearing and of sight, When they have vanished wholly,âfor, in fancy, wing-to-wing We fly to Heaven with them; and, returning, still we sing The praises of this lower Heaven with tireless voice and tongue, Even as the Master sanctionsâwhile the heart beats young. While the heart beats young!âWhile the heart beats young! O green and gold old Earth of ours, with azure overhung And looped with rainbows!âgrant us yet this grassy lap of thineâ We would be still thy children, through the shower and the shine! So pray we, lisping, whispering, in childish love and trust, With our beseeching hands and faces lifted from the dust By fervor of the poem, all unwritten and unsung, Thou givest us in answer, while the heart beats young. Another hero of those youthful years Returns, as Noey Bixler's name appears. And Noeyâif in any special wayâ Was notably good-natured.âWork or play He entered into with selfsame delightâ A wholesome interest that made him quite As many friends among the old as young,â So everywhere were Noey's praises sung. And he was awkward, fat and overgrown, With a round full-moon face, that fairly shone As though to meet the simile's demand. And, cumbrous though he seemed, both eye and hand Were dowered with the discernment and deft skill Of the true artisan: He shaped at will, In his old father's shop, on rainy days, Little toy-wagons, and curved-runner sleighs; The trimmest bows and arrowsâfashioned, too, Of âseasoned timber,â such as Noey knew How to select, prepare, and then complete, And call his little friends in from the street. âThe very best bow,â Noey used to say, âHain't made o' ash ner hick'ry thataway!â But you git mulberryâthe bearin'-tree, Now mind ye! and you fetch the piece to me, And lemme git it seasoned; then, i gum! I'll make a bow 'at you kin brag on some! Erâef you can't git mulberry,âyou bring Me a' old locus' hitch-post, and, i jing! I'll make a bow o' that 'at common bows Won't dast to pick on ner turn up their nose!â And Noey knew the woods, and all the trees And thickets, plants and myriad mysteries Of swamp and bottom-land. And he knew where The ground-hog hid, and why located there.â He knew all animals that burrowed, swam, Or lived in tree-tops: And, by race and dam, He knew the choicest, safest deeps wherein Fish-traps might flourish nor provoke the sin Of theft in some chance peeking, prying sneak, Or town-boy, prowling up and down the creek. All four-pawed creatures tamableâhe knew Their outer and their inner natures too; While they, in turn, were drawn to him as by Some subtle recognition of a tie Of love, as true as truth from end to end, Between themselves and this strange human friend The same with birdsâhe knew them every one And he could âname them, too, without a gun.â No wonder Johnty loved him, even to The verge of worship.âNoey led him through The art of trapping redbirdsâyes, and taught Him how to keep them when he had them caughtâ What food they needed, and just where to swing The cage, if he expected them to sing. And Bud loved Noey, for the little pair Of stilts he made him; or the stout old hair Trunk Noey put on wheels, and laid a track Of scantling-railroad for it in the back Part of the barn-lot; or the crossbow, made Just like a gun, which deadly weapon laid Against his shoulder as he aimed, andââSping!â He'd hear the rusty old nail zoon and singâ And zip! your Mr. Bluejay's wing would drop A farewell-feather from the old tree-top! And Maymie loved him, for the very small But perfect carriage for her favorite dollâ A lady's carriageânot a baby-cab,â But oil-cloth top, and two seats, lined with drab And trimmed with white lace-paper from a case Of shaving-soap his uncle bought some place At auction once. And Alex loved him yet The best, when Noey brought him, for a pet, A little flying-squirrel, with great eyesâ Big as a child's: And, childlike otherwise, It was at first a timid, tremulous, coy, Retiring little thing that dodged the boy And tried to keep in Noey's pocket;âtill, In time responsive to his patient will, It became wholly docile, and content With its new master, as he came and went,â The squirrel clinging flatly to his breast, Or sometimes scampering its craziest Around his body spirally, and then Down to his very heels and up again. And Little Lizzie loved him, as a bee Loves a great ripe red appleâutterly. For Noey's ruddy morning-face she drew The window-blind, and tapped the window, too; Afar she hailed his coming, as she heard His tuneless whistlingâsweet as any bird It seemed to her, the one lame bar or so Of old âWait for the Wagonââhoarse and low The sound was,âso that, all about the place, Folks joked and said that Noey âwhistled bassââ The light remark originally made By Cousin Rufus, who knew notes, and played The flute with nimble skill, and taste as well, And, critical as he was musical, Regarded Noey's constant whistling thus âPhenomenally unmelodious.â Likewise when Uncle Mart, who shared the love Of jest with Cousin Rufus hand-in-glove, Said âNoey couldn't whistle âBonny Doonâ Even! and, he'd bet, couldn't carry a tune If it had handles to it!â âBut forgive The deviations here so fugitive, And turn again to Little Lizzie, whose High estimate of Noey we shall choose Above all others.âAnd to her he was Particularly lovable because He laid the woodland's harvest at her feet.â He brought her wild strawberries, honey-sweet And dewy-cool, in mats of greenest moss And leaves, all woven over and across With tender, biting âtongue-grass,â and âsheep-sour,â And twin-leaved beech-mast, pranked with bud and flower Of every gipsy-blossom of the wild, Dark, tangled forest, dear to any child.â All these in season. Nor could barren, drear, White and stark-featured Winter interfere With Noey's rare resources: Still the same He blithely whistled through the snow and came Beneath the window with a Fairy sled; And Little Lizzie, bundled heels-and-head, He took on such excursions of delight As even âOld Santyâ with his reindeer might Have envied her! And, later, when the snow Was softening toward Spring-time and the glow Of steady sunshine smote upon it,âthen Came the magician Noey yet againâ While all the children were away a day Or two at Grandma's!âand behold when they Got home once more;âthere, towering taller than The doorwayâstood a mighty, old Snow-Man! A thing of peerless artâa masterpiece Doubtless unmatched by even classic Greece In heyday of Praxiteles.âAlone It loomed in lordly grandeur all its own. And steadfast, too, for weeks and weeks it stood, The admiration of the neighborhood As well as of the children Noey sought Only to honor in the work he wrought. The traveler paid it tribute, as he passed Along the highwayâpaused and, turning, cast A lingering, last lookâas though to take A vivid print of it, for memory's sake, To lighten all the empty, aching miles Beyond with brighter fancies, hopes and smiles. The cynic put aside his biting wit And tacitly declared in praise of it; And even the apprentice-poet of the town Rose to impassioned heights, and then sat down And penned a panegyric scroll of rhyme That made the Snow-Man famous for all time. And though, as now, the ever warmer sun Of summer had so melted and undone The perishable figure thatâalas!â Not even in dwindled white against the grass Was left its latest and minutest ghost, The children yetâmaterially, almostâ Beheld itâcircled round it hand-in- handâ (Or rather round the place it used to stand)â With âRing-a-round-a-rosy! Bottle full O' posy!â and, with shriek and laugh, would pull From seeming contact with itâjust as when It was the real-est of old Snow-Men! Even in such a scene of senseless play The children were surprised one summer day By a strange man who called across the fence, Inquiring for their father's residence; And, being answered that this was the place, Opened the gate, and, with a radiant face, Came in and sat down with them in the shade And waitedâtill the absent father made His noon appearance, with a warmth and zest That told he had no ordinary guest In this man whose low-spoken name he knew At once, demurring as the stranger drew A stuffy note-book out, and turned and set A big fat finger on a page, and let The writing thereon testify instead Of further speech. And as the father read All silently, the curious children took Exacting inventory both of book And man:âHe wore a long-napped white fur hat Pulled firmly on his head, and under that Rather long silvery hair, or iron-grayâ For he was not an old man,âanyway, Not beyond sixty. And he wore a pair Of square-framed spectaclesâor rather there Were two more than a pair,âthe extra two Flared at the corners, at the eyes' side-view, In as redundant vision as the eyes Of grasshoppers or bees or dragon-flies. Later the children heard the father say He was âA Noted Traveler,â and would stay Some days with them.âIn which time host and guest Discussed, alone, in deepest interest, Some vague, mysterious matter that defied The wistful children, loitering outside The spare-room door. There Bud acquired a quite New list of big wordsâsuch as âDisunite,â And âShibboleth,â and âAristocracy,â And âJuggernaut,â and âSquatter Sovereignty,â And âAntislavery,â and âEmancipate,â âIrrepressible Conflict,â and âThe Great Battle of Armageddonââobviously A pamphlet brought from Washington, D. C., And spread among such friends as might occur Of like views with âThe Noted Traveler.â A PROSPECTIVE VISIT While any day was notable and dear That gave the children Noey, history here Records his advent emphasized indeed With sharp italics, as he came to feed The stock one special morning, fair and bright, When Johnty and Bud met him, with delight Unusual even as their extra dressâ Garbed as for holiday, with much excess Of proud self-consciousness and vain conceit In their new finery.âFar up the street They called to Noey, as he came, that they, As promised, both were going back that day To his house with him! And by time that each Had one of Noey's handsâceasing their speech And coyly anxious, in their new attire, To wake the comment of their mute desire,â Noey seemed rendered voiceless. Quite a while They watched him furtively.âHe seemed to smile As though he would conceal it; and they saw Him look away, and his lips purse and draw In curious, twitching spasms, as though he might Be whispering,âwhile in his eye the white Predominated strangely.âThen the spell Gave way, and his pent speech burst audible: âThey wuz two stylish little boys, and they wuz mighty bold ones, Had two new pairs o' britches made out o' their Daddy's old ones!â And at the inspirational outbreak, Both joker and his victims seemed to take An equal share of laughter,âand all through Their morning visit kept recurring to The funny words and jingle of the rhyme That just kept getting funnier all the time. AT NOEY'S HOUSE At Noey's houseâwhen they arrived with himâ How snug seemed everything, and neat and trim: The little picket-fence, and little gateâ Its little pulley, and its little weight,â All glib as clockwork, as it clicked behind Them, on the little red-brick pathway, lined With little paint-keg vases and tea-pots Of wee moss-blossoms and forget-me-nots: And in the windows, either side the door, Were ranged as many little boxes more Of like old-fashioned larkspurs, pinks and moss And fern and phlox; while up and down across Them rioted the morning-glory vines On taut-set cotton strings, whose snowy lines Whipped in and out and under the bright green Like basting-threads; and, here and there between A showy, shiny hollyhock would flare Its pink among the white and purple there.â And still behind the vines, the children saw A strange, bleached, wistful face that seemed to draw A vague, indefinite sympathy. A face It was of some newcomer to the place.â In explanation, Noey, briefly, said That it was âJason,â as he turned and led The little fellows round the house to show Them his menagerie of pets. And so For quite a time the face of the strange guest Was partially forgotten, as they pressed About the squirrel-cage and rousted both The lazy inmates out, though wholly loath To whirl the wheel for them.âAnd then with awe They walked round Noey's big pet owl, and saw Him film his great, clear, liquid eyes and stare And turn and turn and turn his head round there The same way they kept circlingâas though he Could turn it one way thus eternally. Behind the kitchen, then, with special pride Noey stirred up a terrapin inside The rain-barrel where he lived, with three or four Little mud-turtles of a size not more In neat circumference than the tiny toy Dumb-watches worn by every little boy. Then, back of the old shop, beneath the tree Of ârusty-coats,â as Noey called them, he Next took the boys, to show his favorite new Pet coonâpulled rather coyly into view Up through a square hole in the bottom of An old inverted tub he bent above, Yanking a little chain, with âHey! you, sir! Here's comp'ny come to see you, Bolivur!â Explanatory, he went on to say, âI named him Bolivur jes' thisaway,â He looks so round and ovalish and fat, 'Peared-like no other name 'ud fit but that.â Here Noey's father called and sent him on Some errand. âWait,â he saidââI won't be gone A half a' hour.âTake Bud, and go on in Where Jason is, tel I git back ag'in.â Whoever Jason was, they found him there Still at the front-room window.âBy his chair Leaned a new pair of crutches; and from one Knee down, a leg was bandaged.ââJason done That-air with one o' these-'ere tools we call A âshin-hoeââbut a foot-adze mostly all Hardware-store-keepers calls 'em.ââ(Noey made This explanation later.) Jason paid But little notice to the boys as they Came in the room:âAn idle volume lay Upon his lapâthe only book in sightâ And Johnty read the title,ââLight, More Light, There's Danger in the Dark,ââthough first and bestâ In fact, the whole of Jason's interest Seemed centered on a little dogâone pet Of Noey's all uncelebrated yetâ Though Jason, certainly, avowed his worth, And niched him over all the pets on earthâ As the observant Johnty would relate The Jason-episode, and imitate The all-enthusiastic speech and air Of Noey's kinsman and his tribute there:â âThat little dog 'ud scratch at that door And go on a-whinin' two hours before He'd ever let up! There!âJane: Let him in.â (Hah, there, you little rat!) Look at him grin! Come down off o' that!â W'y, look at him! (Drat You! you-rascal-you!)âbring me that hat! Look out!âHe'll snap you!âHe wouldn't let You take it away from him, now you kin bet! That little rascal's jist natchurly mean.â I tell you, I never (Git out!!), never seen A spunkier little rip! (Scratch to git in, And now yer a-scratchin' to git out ag'in! Jane: Let him out.) Now, watch him from here Out through the winder!âYou notice one ear Kind o' inside-out, like he holds it?âWell, He's got a tick in itâI kin tell! Yes, and he's cunnin'â Jist watch him a-runnin', Sidelin'âsee!âlike he ain't âplum'd trueâ And legs don't âtrackâ as they'd ort to do!â Ploughin' his nose through the weedsâi jing! Ain't he jist cuter'n anything! âW'y, that little dog's got grown-people's sense;â See how he gits out under the fence?â And watch him a-whettin' his hind legs 'fore His dead square run of a mile'd er moreâ 'Cause Noey's a-comin', and Trip allus knows When Noey's a-comin'âand off he goes!â Putts out to meet him andâThere they come now! Well-sir! it's raially singalar how That dog kin tell,â But he knows as well When Noey's a-comin' home!âReckon his smell 'Ud carry two mile'd?âYou needn't to smileâ He runs to meet him, ever'-once-'n-a-while, Two mile'd and overâwhen he's slipped away And left him at home here, as he's done to-dayâ 'Thout ever knowin' where Noey wuz goin'â But that little dog allus hits the right way! Hear him a-whinin' and scratchin' ag'in?â (Little tormentin' fice!) Jane: Let him in. ââYou say he ain't there?â Well now, I declare!â Lemme limp out and look! ... I wunder whereâ Heuh, Trip!âHeuh, Trip!âHeuh, Trip! ... Thereâ There he is!âLittle sneak!âWhat-a'-you-'bout?â There he isâquiled up as meek as a mouse, His tail turnt up like a tea-kittle spout, A-sunnin' hiss'f at the side o' the house! Next time you scratch, sir, you'll half to git in, My fine little feller, the best way you kin! âNoey he learns him sich capers!âAnd theyâ Both of 'em's ornrier every day!â Both tantalizin' and meaner'n sinâ Allus aâ(Listen there!)âJane: Let him in. ââOh! yer so innocent! hangin' yer head!â (Drat ye! you'd better git under the bed!) ... Listen at that!â He's tackled the cat!â Hah, there! you little rip! come out o' that!â Git yer blame' little eyes scratched out 'Fore you know what yer talkin' about!â Here! come away from there!â(Let him aloneâ He'll snap you, I tell ye, as quick as a bone!) Hi, Trip!âHey, here!âWhat-a'-you-'bout!â Oo! ouch! 'Ll, I'll be blamed!âBlast ye! Git OUT! ... Oh, it ain't nothin'âjist scratched me, you see.â Hadn't no idy he'd try to bite me! Plague take him!âBet he'll not try that ag'in!â Hear him yelp.â(Pore feller!) Jane: Let him in.â THE LOEHRS AND THE HAMMONDS âHey, Bud! O Bud!â rang out a gleeful call,â âThe Loehrs is come to your house!â And a small But very much elated little chap, In snowy linen suit and tasseled cap, Leaped from the back fence just across the street From Bixlers', and came galloping to meet His equally delighted little pair Of playmates, hurrying out to join him thereâ âThe Loehrs is come!âThe Loehrs is come!â his glee Augmented to a pitch of ecstasy Communicated wildly, till the cry âThe Loehrs is come!â in chorus quavered high And thrilling as some pÃ¦an of challenge or Soul-stirring chant of armied conqueror. And who this avant-courier of âthe Loehrsâ?â This happiest of all boys out o' doorsâ Who but Will Pierson, with his heart's excess Of summer warmth and light and breeziness! âFrom our front winder I 'uz first to see 'Em all a-drivin' into town!â bragged heâ âAn' seen 'em turnin' up the alley where Your folks lives at. An' John an' Jake wuz there Both in the wagon;âyes, an' Willy, too; An' Maryâyes, an' Edithâwith bran-new An' purtiest-trimmed hats 'at ever wuz!â An' Susan, an' Janey.âAn' the Hammond-uz In their fine buggy 'at they're ridin' roun' So much, all over an' aroun' the town An' ever'wheres,âthem city people who's A-visutin' at Loehrs-uz!â Glorious news!â Even more glorious when verified In the boys' welcoming eyes of love and pride, As one by one they greeted their old friends And neighbors.âNor until their earth-life ends Will that bright memory become less bright Or dimmed indeed. ... Again, at candle-light, The faces all are gathered. And how glad The Mother's features, knowing that she had Her dear, sweet Mary Loehr back again.â She always was so proud of her; and then The dear girl, in return, was happy, too, And with a heart as loving, kind and true As that maturer one which seemed to blend As one the love of mother and of friend. From time to time, as hand in hand they sat, The fair girl whispered something low, whereat A tender, wistful look would gather in The mother-eyes; and then there would begin A sudden cheerier talk, directed to The stranger guestsâthe man and woman who, It was explained, were coming now to make Their temporary home in town for sake Of the wife's somewhat failing health. Yes, they Were city people, seeking rest this way, The man said, answering a query made By some well-meaning neighborâwith a shade Of apprehension in the answer. ... No,â They had no children. As he answered so, The man's arm went about his wife, and she Leaned toward him, with her eyes lit prayerfully: Then she aroseâhe followingâand bent Above the little sleeping innocent Within the cradle at the mother's sideâ He patting her, all silent, as she cried.â Though, haply, in the silence that ensued, His musings made melodious interlude. In the warm, health-giving weather My poor pale wife and I Drive up and down the little town And the pleasant roads thereby: Out in the wholesome country We wind, from the main highway, In through the wood's green solitudesâ Fair as the Lord's own Day. We have lived so long together, And joyed and mourned as one, That each with each, with a look for speech, Or a touch, may talk as none But Love's elect may comprehendâ Why, the touch of her hand on mine Speaks volume-wise, and the smile of her eyes, To me, is a song divine. There are many places that lure us:â âThe Old Wood Bridgeâ just west Of town we knowâand the creek below, And the banks the boys love best: And âBeech Grove,â too, on the hilltop; And âThe Haunted Houseâ beyond, With its roof half off, and its old pump-trough Adrift in the roadside pond. We find our way to âThe Marshesââ At least where they used to be; And âThe Old Camp Groundsâ; and âThe Indian Mounds,â And the trunk of âThe Council Treeâ: We have crunched and splashed through âFlint-bed Fordâ; And at âOld Big Bee-gum Springâ We have stayed the cup, half lifted up, Hearing the redbird sing. And then, there is âWesley Chapel,â With its little graveyard, lone At the crossroads there, though the sun sets fair On wild rose, mound and stone. ... A wee bed under the willowsâ My wife's hand on my ownâ And our horse stops, too. ... And we hear the coo Of a dove in undertone. The dusk, the dew, and the silence! âOld Charleyâ turns his head Homeward then by the pike again, Though never a word is saidâ One more stop, and a lingering oneâ After the fields and farms,â At the old Toll-Gate, with the woman await With a little girl in her arms. The silence sankâFloretty came to call The children in the kitchen, where they all Went helter-skeltering with shout and din Enough to drown most sanguine silence in,â For well indeed they knew that summons meant Taffy and pop-cornâso with cheers they went. THE HIRED MAN AND FLORETTY The Hired Man's supper, which he sat before, In near reach of the wood-box, the stove-door And one leaf of the kitchen-table, was Somewhat belated, and in lifted pause His dexterous knife was balancing a bit Of fried mush near the port awaiting it. At the glad children's adventâgladder still To find him thereââJest tickled fit to kill To see ye all!â he said, with unctuous cheer.â âI'm tryin'-like to he'p Floretty here To git things cleared away and give ye room Accordin' to yer stren'th. But I p'sume It's a pore boarder, as the poet says, That quarrels with his victuals, so I guess I'll take another wedge o' that-air cake, Florett', that you're a-learnin' how to bake.â He winked and feigned to swallow painfully.â âJest 'fore ye all come in, Floretty she Was boastin' 'bout her biscuitsâand they air As goodâsometimesâas you'll find anywhere.â But, women gits to braggin' on their bread, I'm s'picious 'bout their pieâas Danty said.â This raillery Floretty strangely seemed To take as compliment, and fairly beamed With pleasure at it all. ââSpeakin' o' breadâ When she come here to live,â The Hired Man said,â âNever be'n out o' Freeport 'fore she come Up here,âof course she needed 'sperience some.â So, one day, when yer Ma was goin' to set The risin' fer some bread, she sent Florett' To borry leaven, 'crost at Ryans'.âSo, She went and asked fer twelve.âShe didn't know, But thought, whatever 'twuz, that she could keep One fer herse'f she said. O she wuz deep!â Some little evidence of favor hailed The Hired Man's humor; but it wholly failed To touch the serious Susan Loehr, whose air And thought rebuked them all to listening there To her brief history of the city man And his pale wifeââA sweeter woman than She ever saw!ââSo Susan testified,â And so attested all the Loehrs beside.â So entertaining was the history, that The Hired Man, in the corner where he sat In quiet sequestration, shelling corn, Ceased wholly, listening, with a face forlorn As Sorrow's own, while Susan, John and Jake Told of these strangers who had come to make Some weeks' stay in the town, in hopes to gain Once more the health the wife had sought in vain: Their doctor, in the city, used to know The LoehrsâDan and Rachelâyears ago,â And so had sent a letter and request For them to take a kindly interest In favoring the couple all they couldâ To find some home-place for them, if they would, Among their friends in town. He ended by A dozen further lines, explaining why His patient must have change of scene and airâ New faces, and the simple friendships there With them, which might, in time, make her forget A grief that kept her ever brooding yet And wholly melancholy and depressed,â Nor yet could she find sleep by night nor rest By day, for thinkingâthinkingâthinking still Upon a grief beyond the doctor's skill,â The death of her one little girl. âPore thing!â Floretty sighed, and with the turkey-wing Brushed off the stove-hearth softly, and peered in The kettle of molasses, with her thin Voice wandering into song unconsciouslyâ In purest, if most witless, sympathy.â ââThen sleep no more: Around thy heart Some ten-der dream may i-dlee play, But mid night song, With mad-jick art, Will chase that dree muh-way!ââ âThat-air besetment of Floretty's,â said The Hired Man,ââsingin'âshe inhairited,â Her father wuz addictedâsame as herâ To singin'âyes, and played the dulcimer! Butâgittin' back,âI s'pose yer talkin' 'bout Them Hammondses. Well, Hammond he gits out Pattents on thingsâinventions-like, I'm toldâ And's got more money'n a house could hold! And yit he can't git up no pattent-right To do away with dyin'.âAnd he might Be worth a million, but he couldn't find Nobody sellin' health of any kind! ... But they's no thing onhandier fer me To use than other people's misery.â Floretty, hand me that-air skillet there And lemme git 'er het up, so's them-air Childern kin have their pop-corn.â It was good To hear him now, and so the children stood Closer about him, waiting. âThings to eat,â The Hired Man went on, â'smighty hard to beat! Now, when I wuz a boy, we wuz so pore, My parunts couldn't 'ford pop-corn no more To pamper me with;âso, I hat to go Without pop-cornâsometimes a year er so!â And suffer'n' saints! how hungry I would git Fer jest one other chanceâlike thisâat it! Many and many a time I've dreamp', at night, About pop-corn,âall bu'sted open white, And hot, you knowâand jest enough o' salt And butter on it fer to find no faultâ Oomh!âWell! as I was goin' on to say,â After a-dreamin' of it thataway, Then havin' to wake up and find it's all A dream, and hain't got no pop-corn at-tall, Ner hain't had noneâI'd think, âWell, where's the use!â And jest lay back and sob the plaster'n' loose! And I have prayed, whatever happened, it 'Ud eether be pop-corn er death! ... And yit I've noticedâmore'n likely so have youâ That things don't happen when you want 'em to.â And thus he ran on artlessly, with speech And work in equal exercise, till each Tureen and bowl brimmed white. And then he greased The saucers ready for the wax, and seized The fragrant-steaming kettle, at a sign Made by Floretty; and, each child in line, He led out to the pumpâwhere, in the dim New coolness of the night, quite near to him He felt Floretty's presence, fresh and sweet As ... dewy night-air after kitchen-heat. There, still, with loud delight of laugh and jest, They plied their subtle alchemy with zestâ Till, sudden, high above their tumult, welled Out of the sitting-room a song which held Them stilled in some strange rapture, listening To the sweet blur of voices chorusing:â ââWhen twilight approaches the season That ever is sacred to song, Does some one repeat my name over, And sigh that I tarry so long? And is there a chord in the music That's missed when my voice is away?â And a chord in each heart that awakens Regret at my wearisome stay-ayâ Regret at my wearisome stay.ââ All to himself, The Hired Man thoughtââOf course They'll sing Floretty homesick!â ... O strange source Of ecstasy! O mystery of Song!â To hear the dear old utterance flow along:â ââDo they set me a chair near the table When evening's home-pleasures are nigh?â When the candles are lit in the parlor, And the stars in the calm azure sky.ââ ... Just then the moonlight sliced the porch slantwise, And flashed in misty spangles in the eyes Floretty clenched, while through the darkâI jing!â A voice asked, âWhere's that song âyou'd learn to sing Ef I sent you the ballat?ââwhich I done Last I was home at Freeport.âS'pose you run And git itâand we'll all go in to where They'll know the notes and sing it fer ye there.â And up the darkness of the old stairway Floretty fled, without a word to sayâ Save to herself some whisper muffled by Her apron, as she wiped her lashes dry. Returning, with a letter, which she laid Upon the kitchen-table while she made A hasty crock of âfloat,ââpoured thence into A deep glass dish of iridescent hue And glint and sparkle, with an overflow Of froth to crown it, foaming white as snow.â And thenâpound-cake, and jelly-cake as rare, For its delicious complement,âwith air Of Hebe mortalized, she led her van Of votaries, rounded by The Hired Man. THE EVENING COMPANY Within the sitting-room, the company Had been increased in number. Two or three Young couples had been added: Emma King, Ella and Mary Mathersâall could sing Like veritable angelsâLydia Martin, too, And Nelly Millikan.âWhat songs they knew! ââEver of theeâwherever I may be, Fondly I'm drea-m-ing ever of thee!ââ And with their gracious voices blend the grace Of Warsaw Barnett's tenor; and the bass Unfathomed of Wick ChapmanâFancy still Can feel, as well as hear it, thrill on thrill, Vibrating plainly down the backs of chairs And through the wall and up the old hall-stairs.â Indeed, young Chapman's voice especially Attracted Mr. Hammond.âFor, said he, Waiving the most Elysian sweetness of The ladies' voicesâaltitudes above The man's for sweetness;âbutâas contrast, would Not Mr. Chapman be so very good As, just now, to oblige all withâin fact, Some sort of jolly song,âto counteract In part, at least, the sad, pathetic trend Of music generally. Which wish our friend âThe Noted Travelerâ made second to With heartinessâand so each, in review, Joined inâuntil the radiant basso cleared His wholly unobstructed throat and peered Intently at the ceilingâvoice and eye As opposite indeed as earth and sky.â Thus he uplifted his vast bass and let It roam at large the memories booming yet: ââOld Simon the Cellarer keeps a rare store Of Malmsey and Malvoi-sie, Of Cyprus, and who can say how many more?â But a chary old soul is he-e-eeâ A chary old so-u-l is he! Of hock and Canary he never doth fail; And all the year round, there is brewing of ale;â Yet he never aileth, he quaintly doth say, While he keeps to his sober six flagons a day.ââ ... And then the chorusâthe men's voices all Warred in itâlike a German Carnival.â Even Mrs. Hammond smiled, as in her youth, Hearing her husband.âAnd in veriest truth âThe Noted Traveler'sâ ever-present hat Seemed just relaxed a little, after that, As at conclusion of the Bacchic song He stirred his âfloatâ vehemently and long. Then Cousin Rufus with his flute, and art Blown blithely through it from both soul and heartâ Inspired to heights of mastery by the glad, Enthusiastic audience he had In the young ladies of a town that knew No other flutist,ânay, nor wanted to, Since they had heard his âPolly Hopkins Waltz,â Or âRickett's Hornpipe,â with its faultless faults, As rendered solely, he explained, âby ear,â Having but heard it once, Commencement Year, At âOld Ann Arbor.â Little Maymie now Seemed âfriendsâ with Mr. Hammondâanyhow, Was lifted to his lapâwhere settled, she, Enthroned thus, in her dainty majesty, Gained universal audienceâalthough Addressing him alone:ââI'm come to show You my new Red-blue pencil; and she saysââ (Pointing to Mrs. Hammond)ââthat she guess' You'll make a picture fer me.â âAnd what kind Of picture?â Mr. Hammond asked, inclined To serve the child as bidden, folding square The piece of paper she had brought him there,â âI don't know,â Maymie saidââonly ist make A little dirl, like me!â He paused to take A sharp view of the child, and then he drewâ A while with red, and then a while with blueâ The outline of a little girl that stood In converse with a wolf in a great wood; And she had on a hood and cloak of redâ As Maymie watchedââRed Riding-Hood!â she said âAnd who's âRed Riding-Hoodâ?â âW'y, don't you know?â Asked little Maymieâ But the man looked so All uninformed, that little Maymie could But tell him all about Red Riding-Hood. MAYMIE'S STORY OF RED RIDING-HOOD W'y, one time wuz a little-weenty dirl, An' she wuz named Red Riding-Hood, 'cause herâ Her Ma she maked a little red cloak fer her 'At turnt up over her head.âAn' it 'uz all Ist one piece o' red cardinul 'at's like The drate-long stockin's the storekeepers has.â Oh! it 'uz purtiest cloak in all the world An' all this town er anywheres they is!

An' so her Ma fill' little Red Riding-Hood's Nice basket all ist full o' dood things t' eat, An' tell her take 'em to her old Dran'maâ An' not to spill 'em, neeverâ'cause ef she 'Ud stump her toe an' spill 'em, her Dran'ma She'll haf to punish her! An' nenâAn' so Little Red Riding-Hood she p'omised she 'Ud be all careful nen, an' cross' her heart 'At she won't run an' spill 'em all fer sixâ Fiveâtenâtwo-hundred-bushel-dollars-gold! An' nen she kiss' her Ma doo'-by an' went A-skippin' offâaway fur off frough the Big woods, where her Dran'ma she live atâNo!â She didn't do a-skippin', like I said:â She ist went walkin'âcareful-like an' slowâ Ist like a little ladyâwalkin' 'long As all polite an' niceâan' slowâan' straightâ An' turn her toesâist like she's marchin' in The Sund'y-School k-session!

So when Red Riding-Hood Dit to do there, she allus have most funâ When she do frough the drate-big woods, you know.â 'Cause she ain't feard a bit o' anything! An' so she sees the little hoppty-birds 'At's in the trees, an' flyin' all around, An' singin' dlad as ef their parunts said They'll take 'em to the magic-lantern show! An' she 'ud pull the purty flowers an' things A-growin' round the stumps.âAn' she 'ud ketch The purty butterflies, an' drasshoppers, An' stick pins frough 'emâNo!âI ist said that!â 'Cause she's too dood an' kind an' 'bedient To hurt things thataway.âShe'd ketch 'em, though, An' ist play wiv 'em ist a little while, An' nen she'd let 'em fly away, she would, An' ist skip on ad'in to her Dran'ma's. An' so, while she 'uz doin' 'long an' 'long, First thing you know they 'uz a drate-big old Mean wicked Wolf jumped out 'at wanted t' eat Her up, but dassent toâ'cause wite clos't there They wuz a Man a-choppin' wood, an' you Could hear him.âSo the old Wolf he 'uz feard Only to ist be kind to her.âSo he Ist 'tended-like he wuz dood friends to her An' says, âDood morning, little Red Riding-Hood!ââ All ist as kind! An' nen Riding-Hood She say âDood morning,â tooâall kind an' niceâ Ist like her Ma she learn'âNo!âmustn't say âLearn',â 'cause âlearn'â it's unproper.âSo she say It like her Ma she âteachedâher.âAn'âso she Ist says âDood morningâ to the Wolfâ'cause she Don't know ut-tall 'at he's a wicked Wolf An' want to eat her up! Nen old Wolf smile An' say, so kind: âWhere air you doin' at?â Nen little Red Riding-Hood she say: âI'm doin' To my Dran'ma's, 'cause my Ma say I might.â Nen, when she tell him that, the old Wolf he Ist turn an' light out frough the big thick woods, Where she can't see him any more. An' so She think he's went to his houseâbut he hain't,â He's went to her Dran'ma's, to be there firstâ An' ketch her, ef she don't watch mighty sharp What she's about! An' nen when the old Wolf Dit to her Dran'ma's house, he's purty smart,â An' so he 'tend-like he's Red Riding-Hood, An' knock at th' door. An' Riding-Hood's Dran'ma She's sick in bed an' can't come to the door An' open it. So th' old Wolf knock' two times. An' nen Red Riding-Hood's Dran'ma she says, âWho's there?â she says. An' old Wolf 'tends-like he's Little Red Riding-Hood, you know, an' make' His voice soun' ist like hers, an' says: âIt's me, Dran'maâan' I'm Red Riding-Hood an' I'm Ist come to see you.â Nen her old Dran'ma She think it is little Red Riding-Hood, An' so she say: âWell, come in nen an' make You'se'f at home,â she says, â'cause I'm down sick In bed, an' got the 'ralgia, so's I can't Dit up an' let ye in.â An' so th' old Wolf Ist march' in nen an' shet the door ad'in, An' drowl', he did, an' splunge' up on the bed An' et up old Miz Riding-Hood 'fore she Could put her specs on an' see who it wuz.â An' so she never knowed who et her up! An' nen the wicked Wolf he ist put on Her nightcap, an' all covered up in bedâ Like he wuz her, you know. Nen, purty soon Here come along little Red Riding-Hood, An' she knock' at the door. An' old Wolf 'tend- Like he's her Dran'ma; an' he say, âWho's there?â Ist like her Dran'ma say, you know. An' so Little Red Riding-Hood she say: âIt's me, Dran'maâan' I'm Red Riding-Hood an' I'm Ist come to see you.â An' nen old Wolf nen He cough an' say: âWell, come in nen an' make You'se'f at home,â he says, â'cause I'm down sick In bed, an' got the 'ralgia, so's I can't Dit up an' let ye in.â An' so she think It's her Dran'ma a-talkin'.âSo she ist Open' the door an' come in, an' set down Her basket, an' taked off her things, an' bringed A chair an' clumbed up on the bed, wite by The old big Wolf she thinks is her Dran'maâ Only she thinks the old Wolf's dot whole lots More bigger ears, an' lots more whiskers, too, Than her Dran'ma; an' so Red Riding-Hood She's kind o' skeered a little. So she says, âOh, Dran'ma, what big eyes you dot!â An' nen The old Wolf says: âThey're ist big thataway 'Cause I'm so dlad to see you!â Nen she says, âOh, Dran'ma, what a drate-big nose you dot!â Nen th' old Wolf says: âIt's ist big thataway Ist 'cause I smell the dood things 'at you bringed Me in the basket!â An' nen Riding-Hood She says, âOh-me-oh-my! Dran'ma! what big White long sharp teeth you dot!â Nen old Wolf says: âYesâan' they're thatawayââan' drowledâ âThey're thataway,âhe says, âto eat you wiv!â An' nen he ist jump' at her.â But she scream'â An' scream', she did.âSo's 'at the Man 'At wuz a-choppin' wood, you know,âhe hear, An' come a-runnin' in there wiv his ax; An', 'fore the old Wolf know' what he's about, He split his old brains out an' killed him s' quick It make' his head swim!âAn' Red Riding-Hood She wuzn't hurt at all! An' the big Man He tooked her all safe home, he did, an' tell Her Ma she's all right an' ain't hurt at all An' old Wolf's dead an' killedâan' ever'thing!â So her Ma wuz so tickled an' so proud, She gived him all the good things t' eat they wuz 'At's in the basket, an' she tell' him 'at She's much oblige', an' say to âcall ad'in.â An' story's honest truthâan' all so, too! LIMITATIONS OF GENIUS The audience entire seemed pleasedâindeed, Extremely pleased. And little Maymie, freed From her task of instructing, ran to show Her wondrous colored picture to and fro Among the company. âAnd how comes it,â said Some one to Mr. Hammond, âthat, instead Of the inventor's life, you did not choose The artist's?âsince the world can better lose A cutting-box or reaper than it can A noble picture painted by a man Endowed with gifts this drawing would suggestââ Holding the picture up to show the rest. âThere now!â chimed in the wife, her pale face lit Like winter snow with sunrise over it,â âThat's what I'm always asking him.âBut heâ Well, as he's answering you, he answers me,â With that same silent, suffocating smile He's wearing now!â For quite a little while No further speech from any one, although All looked at Mr. Hammond and that slow, Immutable, mild smile of his. And then The encouraged querist asked him yet again Why was it, and et ceteraâwith all The rest, expectant, waiting round the wall,â Until the gentle Mr. Hammond said He'd answer with a âparable,â insteadâ About âa dreamerâ that he used to knowâ âAn artistâââmasterââallâin embryo. MR. HAMMOND'S PARABLE THE DREAMER I He was a Dreamer of the Days: Indolent as a lazy breeze Of midsummer, in idlest ways Lolling about in the shade of trees. The farmer turnedâas he passed him by Under the hillside where he kneeled Plucking a flowerâwith scornful eye And rode ahead in the harvest-field MutteringââLawz! ef that-air shirk Of a boy wuz mine fer a week er so, He'd quit dreamin' and git to work And airn his livin'âerâWell! I know!â And even kindlier rumor said, Tapping with finger a shaking head,â âGot such a curious kind o' wayâ Wouldn't surprise me much, I say!â Lying limp, with upturned gaze Idly dreaming away his days. No companions? Yes, a book Sometimes under his arm he took To read aloud to a lonesome brook. And schoolboys, truant, once had heard A strange voice chanting, faint and dimâ Followed the echoes, and found it him, Perched in a tree-top like a bird, Singing, clean from the highest limb; And, fearful and awed, they all slipped by To wonder in whispers if he could fly. âLet him alone!â his father said When the old schoolmaster came to say, âHe took no part in his books to-dayâ Only the lesson the readers read.â His mind seems sadly going astray!â âLet him alone!â came the mournful tone, And the father's grief in his sad eyes shoneâ Hiding his face in his trembling hand, Moaning, âWould I could understand! But as Heaven wills it I accept Uncomplainingly!â So he wept. Then went âThe Dreamerâ as he willed, As uncontrolled as a light sail filled Flutters about with an empty boat Loosed from its moorings and afloat: Drifted out from the busy quay Of dull school-moorings listlessly; Drifted off on the talking breeze, All alone with his reveries; Drifted on, as his fancies wroughtâ Out on the mighty gulfs of thought. II The farmer came in the evening gray And took the bars of the pasture down; Called to the cows in a coaxing way, âBessâ and âLadyâ and âSpotâ and âBrown,â While each gazed with a wide-eyed stare, As though surprised at his coming thereâ Till another tone, in a higher key, Brought their obeyance loathfully. Then, as he slowly turned and swung The topmost bar to its proper rest, Something fluttered along and clung An instant, shivering at his breastâ A wind-scared fragment of legal cap Which darted again, as he struck his hand On his sounding chest with a sudden slap, And hurried sailing across the land. But as it clung he had caught the glance Of a little penciled countenance, And a glamour of written words; and hence, A minute later, over the fence, âHere and there and gone astray Over the hills and far away,â He chased it into a thicket of trees And took it away from the captious breeze. A scrap of paper with a rhyme Scrawled upon it of summer-time: A pencil-sketch of a dairymaid, Under a farmhouse porch's shade, Working merrily; and was blent With her glad features such sweet content, That a song she sang in the lines below Seemed delightfully apropos:â SONG âWhy do I singâTra-la-la-la-la! Glad as a King?âTra-la-la-la-la! Well, since you ask,â I have such a pleasant task, I can not help but sing! âWhy do I smileâTra-la-la-la-la! Working the while?âTra-la-la-la-la! Work like this is play,â So I'm playing all the dayâ I can not help but smile! âSo, if you pleaseâTra-la-la-la-la! Live at your ease!âTra-la-la-la-la! You've only got to turn, And, you see, it's bound to churnâ It can not help but please!â The farmer pondered and scratched his head, Reading over each mystic word.â âSome o' The Dreamer's work!â he saidâ âAh, here's moreâand name and date In his handwrite'!ââAnd the good man read,â ââPatent applied for, July third, Eighteen hundred and forty-eightâ!â The fragment fell from his nerveless graspâ His awed lips thrilled with the joyous gasp: âI see the p'int to the whole concern,â He's studied out a patent churn!â FLORETTY'S MUSICAL CONTRIBUTION All seemed delighted, though the elders more, Of course, than were the children.âThus, before Much interchange of mirthful compliment, The story-teller said his stories âwentâ (Like a bad candle) best when they went out,â And that some sprightly music, dashed about, Would wholly quench his âglimmer,â and inspire Far brighter lights. And, answering this desire, The flutist opened, in a rapturous strain Of rippling notesâa perfect April-rain Of melody that drenched the senses through;â Thenâgentlerâgentlerâas the dusk sheds dew, It fell, by velvety, staccatoed halts, Swooning away in old âVon Weber's Waltz.â Then the young ladies sang âIsle of the Seaââ In ebb and flow and wave so billowy,â Only with quavering breath and folded eyes The listeners heard, buoyed on the fall and rise Of its insistent and exceeding stress Of sweetness and ecstatic tenderness. ... With lifted finger yet, RemembranceâList!â âBeautiful isle of the sea!â wells in a mist Of tremulous. ... ... After much whispering Among the children, Alex came to bring Some kind of letterâas it seemed to beâ To Cousin Rufus. This he carelessly Unfoldedâreading to himself alone,â But, since its contents became, later, known, And no one âplayed so awful bad,â the same May here be givenâof course without full name, Facsimile, or written kink or curl Or clue. It read:â âWild Roved an indian Girl Brite al Florettyâ deer freind i now take These means to send that Song to you &amp; make my Promus good to you in the Regards Of doing What i Promust afterwards. the notes &amp; Words is both here Printed sos you can git uncle Mart to read you those &amp; cousin Rufus you can git to Play the notes fur you on eny Plezunt day His Legul Work aint Pressing. Ever thine As shore as the Vine doth the Stump intwine thou art my Lump of Sackkerrine Rinaldo Rinaldine the Pirut in Captivity. ... There dropped Another square scrap.âBut the hand was stopped That reached for itâFloretty suddenly Had set a firm foot on her propertyâ Thinking it was the letter, not the song,â But blushing to discover she was wrong, When, with all gravity of face and air, Her precious letter handed to her there By Cousin Rufus left her even more In apprehension than she was before. But, testing his unwavering, kindly eye, She seemed to put her last suspicion by, And, in exchange, handed the song to him.â A page torn from a song-book: Small and dim Both notes and words wereâbut as plain as day They seemed to him, as he began to playâ And plain to all the singers,âas he ran An airy, warbling prelude, then began Singing and swinging in so blithe a strain, That every voice rang in the old refrain: MOUNTAIN MAID'S INVITATION ARRANGED BY J. E. GOULD. [I] Come! come! come! O'er the hills, free from care, In my home true pleasure share; Blossoms sweet, flow'rs most rare, Come where joys are found! Here the sparkling dews of morn Tree and shrub with gems adorn, Jewels bright, gayly worn, Beauty all around! Tra la la la, tra la la! Tra la la la, tra la la! Jewels bright, gayly worn, Beauty all around! II Come! come! come! Not a sigh, not a tear, E'er is found in sadness here; Music soft, breathing near, Charms away each care! Birds, in joyous hours among Hill and dell, with grateful song, Dearest strains here prolong, Vocal all the air! Tra la la la, tra la la! Tra la la la, tra la la! Dearest strains here prolong, Vocal all the air! III Come! come! come! When the day's gently gone, Evening shadows coming on, Then, by love, kindly won, Truest bliss be thine! Ne'er was found a bliss so pure, Never joys so long endure; Who would not love secure? Who would joys decline? Tra la la la, tra la la! Tra la la la, tra la la! Who would not love secure? Who would joys decline? From the beginning of the song, clean through, Floretty's features were a study to The flutist who âread notesâ so readily, Yet read so little of the mystery Of that face of the girl's.âIndeed, one thing Bewildered him quite into worrying, And that was, noticing, throughout it all, The Hired Man shrinking closer to the wall, She ever backing toward him through the throng Of barricading childrenâtill the song Was ended, and at last he saw her near Enough to reach and take him by the ear And pinch it just a pang's worth of her ire And leave it burning like a coal of fire. He noticed, too, in subtle pantomime She seemed to dust him off, from time to time; And when somebody, later, asked if she Had never heard the song beforeââWhat! me?â She saidâthen blushed again and smiled,â âI've knowed that song sence Adam wuz a child!â It's jes' a joke o' this-here man's.âHe's learned To read and write a little, and it's turned His fool-head someâThat's all!â And then some one Of the loud-wrangling boys saidââ'Course they's none No more, these days!âThey's Fairies ust to be, But they're all dead, a hundred years!â said he. âWell, there's where you're mustakened!ââin reply They heard Bud's voice, pitched sharp and thin and high.â âAn' how you goin' to prove it?â âWell, I kin!â Said Bud, with emphasis,ââThey's one lives in Our gardenâand I see 'im wunst, wiv my Own eyesâone time I did.â âOh, what a lie!â ââ'Sh!â âWell, nen,â said the skepticâseeing there The older folks attractedââtell us where You saw him, an' all 'bout him!â âYes, my son.â If you tell âstories,â you may tell us one,â The smiling father said, while Uncle Mart, Behind him, winked at Bud, and pulled apart His nose and chin with comical grimaceâ Then sighed aloud, with sanctimonious face,â ââHow good and comely it is to see Children and parents in friendship agree!ââ You fire away, Bud, on your Fairy taleâ Your Uncle's here to back you!â Somewhat pale, And breathless as to speech, the little man Gathered himself. And thus his story ran. BUD'S FAIRY TALE Some peoples thinks they ain't no Fairies now No more yet!âBut they is, I bet! 'Cause ef They wuzn't Fairies, nen I' like to know Who'd w'ite 'bout Fairies in the books, an' tell What Fairies does, an' how their picture looks, An' all an' ever'thing! W'y, ef they don't Be Fairies any more, nen little boys 'Ud ist sleep when they go to sleep an' won't Have ist no dweams at all,â'cause Fairiesâgood Fairiesâthey're a-purpose to make dweams! But they is Fairiesâan' I know they is! 'Cause one time wunst, when it's all Summer-time, An' don't haf to be no fires in the stove Er fireplace to keep warm wivâner don't haf To wear old scwatchy flannen shirts at all, An' ain't no fweezeâner coldâner snow!âAn'âan' Old skweeky twees got all the gween leaves on An' ist keeps noddin', noddin' all the time, Like they 'uz lazy an' a-twyin' to go To sleep an' couldn't, 'cause the wind won't quit A-blowin' in 'em, an' the birds won't stop A-singin', so's they kin.âBut twees don't sleep, I guess! But little boys sleepsâan' dweams, too.â An' that's a sign they's Fairies. So, one time, When I be'n playin' âStoreâ wunst over in The shed of their old stable, an' Ed Howard He maked me quit a-bein' pardners, 'cause I dwinked the 'tend-like sody-water up An' et the shore-'nuff crackers,âw'y, nen I Clumbed over in our garden where the gwapes Wuz purt' nigh ripe: An' I wuz ist a-layin' There on th' old cwooked seat 'at Pa maked in Our arber,âan' so I 'uz layin' there A-whittlin' beets wiv my new dog-knife, an' A-lookin' wite up thue the twimbly leavesâ An' wuzn't 'sleep at all!âAn'-sir!âfirst thing You know, a little Fairy hopped out there!â A leetle-teenty Fairy!âhope-may-die! An' he look' down at me, he didâan' he Ain't bigger'n a yellerbird!âan' he Say âHowdy-do!â he didâan' I could hear Himâist as plain! Nen I say âHowdy-do!â An' he say âI'm all hunky, Nibsey; how Is your folks comin' on?â An' nen I say âMy name ain't âNibsey,â neeverâmy name's Bud.â An' what's your name?â I says to him. An' he Ist laugh an' say, ââBud's awful funny name!â An' he ist laid back on a big bunch o' gwapes An' laugh' an' laugh', he didâlike somebody 'Uz tick-el-un his feet! An' nen I sayâ âWhat's your name,â nen I say, âafore you bu'st Yo'se'f a-laughin' bout my name?â I says. An' nen he dwy up laughin'âkind o' madâ An' say, âW'y, my name's Squidjicum,â he says. An' nen I laugh an' sayââGee! what a name!â An' when I make fun of his name, like that, He ist git awful mad an' spunky, an' 'Fore you know, he gwabbed holt of a vineâ A big long vine 'at's danglin' up there, an' He ist helt on wite tight to that, an' down He swung quick past my face, he did, an' ist Kicked at me hard's he could! But I'm too quick Fer Mr. Squidjicum! I ist weached out An' ketched him, in my handâan' helt him, too, An' squeezed him, ist like little wobins when They can't fly yet an' git flopped out their nest. An' nen I turn him all wound over, an' Look at him clos't, you knowâwite clos't,âcause ef He is a Fairy, w'y, I want to see The wings he's got.âBut he's dwessed up so fine 'At I can't see no wings.âAn' all the time He's twyin' to kick me yet: An' so I take F'esh holts an' squeeze ag'inâan' harder, too; An' I says, âHold up, Mr. Squidjicum!â You're kickin' the w'ong man!â I says; an' nen I ist squeeze' him, purt' nigh my best, I didâ An' I heerd somepin' bu'st!âAn' nen he cwied An' says, âYou better look out what you're doin'!â You' bu'st my spider-web suspenners, an' You' got my wose-leaf coat all cwinkled up So's I can't go to old Miss Hoodjicum's Tea-party, 's afternoon!â An' nen I saysâ âWho's âold Miss Hoodjicumâ?â I says.

A DELICIOUS INTERRUPTION All were quite gracious in their plaudits of Bud's Fairy; but another stir above That murmur was occasioned by a sweet Young lady-caller, from a neighboring street, Who rose reluctantly to say good night To all the pleasant friends and the delight Experienced,âas she had promised sure To be back home by nine. Then paused, demure, And wondered was it very dark.âOh, no!â She had come by herself and she could go Without an escort. Ah, you sweet girls all! What young gallant but comes at such a call, Your most abject slaves! Why, there were three Young men, and several men of family, Contesting for the honorâwhich at last Was given to Cousin Rufus; and he cast A kingly look behind him, as the pair Vanished with laughter in the darkness there. As order was restored, with everything Suggestive, in its way, of âromancing,â Some one observed that now would be the chance For Noey to relate a circumstance That heâthe very specious rumor wentâ Had been eye-witness of, by accident. Noey turned pippin-crimson; then turned pale As death; then turned to flee, without avail.â âThere! head him off! Now! hold him in his chair!â Tell us the Serenade-tale, now, Noey.âThere!â NOEY'S NIGHT-PIECE âThey ain't much âtaleâ about it!â Noey said.â âK'tawby grapes wuz gittin' good-'n'-red I rickollect; and Tubb Kingry and me 'Ud kind o' browse round town, daytime, to see What neighbers 'peared to have the most to spare 'At wuz git-at-able and no dog there When we come round to git 'em, say 'bout ten O'clock at night, when mostly old folks then Wuz snorin' at each other like they yit Helt some old grudge 'at never slep' a bit. Well, at the Pars'nigeâef ye'll call to mind,â They's 'bout the biggest grape-arber you'll find 'Most anywheres.âAnd mostly there, we knowed They wuz k'tawbies thick as ever growedâ And more'n they'd p'serve.âBesides I've heerd Ma say k'tawby-grape p'serves jes' 'peared A waste o' sugar, anyhow!âAnd so My conscience stayed outside and lemme go With Tubb, one night, the back-way, clean up through That long black arber to the end next to The house, where the k'tawbies, don't you know, Wuz thickest. And 't'uz lucky we went slow,â Fer jes' as we wuz cropin' to'rds the gray- End, like, of the old arberâheerd Tubb say In a skeered whisper, âHold up! They's some one Jes' slippin' in here!âand looks like a gun He's carryin'!â I golly! we both spread Out flat ag'inst the ground! âWhat's that?â Tubb said.â And jes' thenââplink! plunk! plink!â we heerd something Under the back-porch winder.âThen, i jing! Of course we rickollected 'bout the young School-mam 'at wuz a-boardin' there, and sung, And played on the melodium in the choir.â And she 'uz 'bout as purty to admire As any girl in town!âthe fac's is, she Jes' wuz, them times, to a dead certainty, The belle o' this-here bailywick!âButâWell,â I'd best git back to what I'm tryin' to tell:â It wuz some feller come to serenade Miss Wetherell: And there he plunked and played His old guitar, and sung, and kep' his eye Set on her winder, blacker'n the sky!â And black it stayed.âBut mayby she wuz 'way From home, er wore outâbein' Saturday! âIt seemed a good 'eal longer, but I know He sung and plunked there half a' hour er so Afore, it 'peared-like, he could ever git His own free qualified consents to quit And go off 'bout his business. When he went I bet you could 'a' bought him fer a cent! âAnd now, behold ye all!âas Tubb and me Wuz 'bout to raise up,âright in front we see A feller slippin' out the arber, square Smack under that-air little winder where The other feller had been standin'.âAnd The thing he wuz a-carryin' in his hand Wuzn't no gun at all!âit wuz a flute,â And whoop-ee! how it did git up and toot And chirp and warble, tel a mockin'-bird 'Ud dast to never let hisse'f be heerd Ferever, after such miracalous, high Jimcracks and grand skyrootics played there by Yer Cousin Rufus!âYes-sir; it wuz him!â And what's more,âall a-suddent that-air dim Dark winder o' Miss Wetherell's wuz lit Up like a' oyshture-sign, and under it We see him sort o' wet his lips and smile Down 'long his row o' dancin' fingers, while He kind o' stiffened up and kinked his breath And everlastin'ly jes' blowed the peth Out o' that-air old one-keyed flute o' his. And, bless their hearts, that's all the âtaleâ they is!â And even as Noey closed, all radiantly The unconscious hero of the history, Returning, met a perfect driving storm Of welcomeâa reception strangely warm And unaccountable, to him, although Most gratifying,âand he told them so. âI only urge,â he said, âmy right to be Enlightened.â And a voice said: âCertainly:â During your absence we agreed that you Should tell us all a story, old or new, Just in the immediate happy frame of mind We knew you would return in.â So, resigned, The ready flutist tossed his hat asideâ Glanced at the children, smiled, and thus complied. COUSIN RUFUS' STORY My little story, Cousin Rufus said, Is not so much a story as a fact. It is about a certain wilful boyâ An aggrieved, unappreciated boy, Grown to dislike his own home very much, By reason of his parents being not At all up to his rigid standard and Requirements and exactions as a son And disciplinarian. So, sullenly He brooded over his disheartening Environments and limitations, till, At last, well knowing that the outside world Would yield him favors never found at home, He rose determinedly one July dawnâ Even before the call for breakfastâand, Climbing the alley-fence, and bitterly Shaking his clenched fist at the wood-pile, he Evanished down the turnpike.âYes: he had, Once and for all, put into execution His long low-muttered threateningsâHe had Run off!âHe hadâhad run away from home! His parents, at discovery of his flight, Bore up first-rateâespecially his Pa,â Quite possibly recalling his own youth, And therefrom predicating, by high noon, The absent one was very probably Disporting his nude self in the delights Of the old swimmin'-hole, some hundred yards Below the slaughter-house, just east of town. The stoic father, too, in his surmise Was accurateâFor, lo! the boy was there! And there, too, he remained throughout the dayâ Save at one starving interval in which He clad his sunburnt shoulders long enough To shy across a wheat-field, shadow-like, And raid a neighboring orchardâbitterly, And with spasmodic twitchings of the lip, Bethinking him how all the other boys Had homes to go to at the dinner-hourâ While heâalas!âhe had no home!âAt least These very words seemed rising mockingly, Until his every thought smacked raw and sour And green and bitter as the apples he In vain essayed to stay his hunger with. Nor did he join the glad shouts when the boys Returned rejuvenated for the long Wet revel of the feverish afternoon.â Yet, bravely, as his comrades splashed and swam And spluttered, in their weltering merriment, He tried to laugh, too,âbut his voice was hoarse And sounded to him like some other boy's. And then he felt a sudden, poking sort Of sickness at the heart, as though some cold And scaly pain were blindly nosing it Down in the dreggy darkness of his breast. The tensioned pucker of his purple lips Grew ever chillier and yet more tenseâ The central hurt of it slow spreading till It did possess the little face entire. And then there grew to be a knuckled knotâ An aching kind of core within his throatâ An ache, all dry and swallowless, which seemed To ache on just as bad when he'd pretend He didn't notice it as when he did. It was a kind of a conceited painâ An overbearing, self-assertive and Barbaric sort of pain that clean outhurt A boy's capacity for sufferingâ So, many times, the little martyr needs Must turn himself all suddenly and dive From sight of his hilarious playmates and Surreptitiously weep under water. Thus He wrestled with his awful agony Till almost dark; and then, at lastâthen, with The very latest lingering group of his Companions, he moved turgidly toward homeâ Nay, rather oozed that way, so slow he went,â With loathful, hesitating, loitering, Reluctant late-election-returns air, Heightened somewhat by the conscience-made resolve Of chopping a double armful of wood As he went in by rear way of the kitchen. And this resolve he executed;âyet The hired girl made no comment whatsoever But went on washing up the supper-things, Crooning the unutterably sad song, âThen think, Oh, think how lonely this heart must ever be!â Still, with affected carelessness, the boy Ranged through the pantry; but the cupboard-door Was locked. He sighed then like a wet forestick And went out on the porch.âAt least the pump, He prophesied, would meet him kindly and Shake hands with him and welcome his return! And long he held the old tin dipper upâ And oh, how fresh and pure and sweet the draught! Over the upturned brim, with grateful eyes He saw the back-yard, in the gathering night, Vague, dim and lonesome; but it all looked good: The lightning-bugs, against the grape-vines, blinked A sort of sallow gladness over his Home-coming, with this softening of the heart. He did not leave the dipper carelessly In the milk-trough.âNo: he hung it back upon Its old nail thoughtfullyâeven tenderly. All slowly then he turned and sauntered toward The rain-barrel at the corner of the house, And, pausing, peered into it at the few Faint stars reflected there. Thenâmoved by some Strange impulse new to himâhe washed his feet. He then went in the houseâstraight on into The very room where sat his parents by The evening lamp.âThe father all intent Reading his paper, and the mother quite As intent with her sewing. Neither looked Up at his entranceâeven reproachfully,â And neither spoke. The wistful runaway Drew a long, quavering breath, and then sat down Upon the extreme edge of a chair. And all Was very still there for a long, long while.â Yet everything, someway, seemed restful-like And homy and old-fashioned, good and kind, And sort of kin to him!âOnly too still! If somebody would say somethingâjust speakâ Or even rise up suddenly and come And lift him by the ear sheer off his chairâ Or box his jawsâLord bless 'em!âanything!â Was he not there to thankfully accept Any reception from parental source Save this incomprehensible voicelessness? O but the silence held its very breath! If but the ticking clock would only strike And for an instant drown the whispering, Lisping, sifting sound the katydids Made outside in the grassy nowhere! Far Down some back street he heard the faint halloo Of boys at their night-game of âTown-fox,â But now with no desire at all to be Participating in their sport.âNo; no;â Never again in this world would he want To join them there!âhe only wanted just To stay in home of nightsâAlwaysâalwaysâ Forever and a day! He moved; and coughedâ Coughed hoarsely, too, through his rolled tongue; and yet No vaguest of parental notice or Solicitude in answerâno responseâ No wordâno look. O it was deathly still!â So still it was that really he could not Remember any prior silence that At all approached it in profundity And depth and density of utter hush. He felt that he himself must break it: So, Summoning every subtle artifice Of seeming nonchalance and native ease And naturalness of utterance to his aid, And gazing raptly at the house-cat where She lay curled in her wonted corner of The hearth-rug, dozing, he spoke airily And said: âI see you've got the same old cat!â BEWILDERING EMOTIONS The merriment that followed was subduedâ As though the story-teller's attitude Were dual, in a sense, appealing quite As much to sorrow as to mere delight, According, haply, to the listener's bent Either of sad or merry temperament.â âAnd of your two appeals I much prefer The pathos,â said âThe Noted Traveler,ââ âFor should I live to twice my present years, I know I could not quite forget the tears That child-eyes bleed, the little palms nailed wide, And quivering soul and body crucified. ... But, bless them! there are no such children here To-night, thank God!âCome here to me, my dear!â He said to little Alex, in a tone So winning that the sound of it alone Had drawn a child more loathful to his knee:â âAnd, now-sir, I'll agree if you'll agree,â You tell us all a story, and then I Will tell one.â âBut I can't.â âWell, can't you try?â âYes, Mister: he kin tell one. Alex, tell The one, you know, 'at you made up so well, About the Bear. He allus tells that one,â Said Bud,ââHe gits it mixed some 'bout the gun An' ax the Little Boy had, an' apples, too.ââ Then Uncle Mart saidââThere, now! that'll do!â Let Alex tell his story his own way!â And Alex, prompted thus, without delay Began. THE BEAR STORY THAT ALEX âIST MAKED UP HIS-OWN-SE'Fâ W'y, wunst they wuz a Little Boy went out In the woods to shoot a Bear. So, he went out 'Way in the grea'-big woodsâhe did.âAn' he Wuz goin' alongâan' goin' along, you know, An' purty soon he heerd somepin' go âWooh!ââ Ist thatawayââWoo-ooh!â An' he wuz skeered, He wuz. An' so he runned an' clumbed a treeâ A grea'-big tree, he did,âa sicka-more tree. An' nen he heerd it ag'in: an' he looked round, An' 't'uz a Bear!âa grea'-big shore-'nuff Bear!â No: 't'uz two Bears, it wuzâtwo grea'-big Bearsâ One of 'em wuzâist one's a grea'-big Bear.â But they ist boff went âWooh!ââAn' here they come To climb the tree an' git the Little Boy An' eat him up! An' nen the Little Boy He 'uz skeered worse'n ever! An' here come The grea'-big Bear a-climbin' th' tree to git The Little Boy an' eat him upâOh, no!â It 'uzn't the Big Bear 'at clumb the treeâ It 'uz the Little Bear. So here he come Climbin' the treeâan' climbin' the tree! Nen when He git wite clos't to the Little Boy, w'y, nen The Little Boy he ist pulled up his gun An' shot the Bear, he did, an' killed him dead! An' nen the Bear he falled clean on down out The treeâaway clean to the ground, he didâ Spling-splung! he falled plum down, an' killed him, too! An' lit wite side o' where the Big Bear's at. An' nen the Big Bear's awful mad, you bet!â 'Causeâ'cause the Little Boy he shot his gun An' killed the Little Bear.â'Cause the Big Bear Heâhe 'uz the Little Bear's Papa.âAn' so here He come to climb the big old tree an' git The Little Boy an' eat him up! An' when The Little Boy he saw the grea'-big Bear A-comin', he 'uz badder skeered, he wuz, Than any time! An' so he think he'll climb Up higherâ'way up higher in the tree Than the old Bear kin climb, you know.âBut heâ He can't climb higher 'an old Bears kin climb,â 'Cause Bears kin climb up higher in the trees Than any little Boys in all the Wo-r-r-ld! An' so here come the grea'-big Bear, he did,â A'climbin' upâan' up the tree, to git The Little Boy an' eat him up! An' so The Little Boy he clumbed on higher, an' higher, An' higher up the treeâan' higherâan' higherâ An' higher'n iss-here house is!âAn' here come The old Bearâclos'ter to him all the time!â An' nenâfirst thing you know,âwhen th' old Big Bear Wuz wite clos't to himânen the Little Boy Ist jabbed his gun wite in the old Bear's mouf An' shot an' killed him dead!âNo; I fergot,â He didn't shoot the grea'-big Bear at allâ 'Cause they 'uz no load in the gun, you knowâ 'Cause when he shot the Little Bear, w'y, nen No load 'uz any more nen in the gun! But th' Little Boy clumbed higher up, he didâ He clumbed lots higherâan' on up higherâan' higher An' higherâtel he ist can't climb no higher, 'Cause nen the limbs 'uz all so little, 'way Up in the teeny-weeny tip-top of The tree, they'd break down wiv him ef he don't Be keerful! So he stop an' think: An' nen He look aroundâAn' here come the old Bear! An' so the Little Boy make up his mind He's got to ist git out o' there someway!â 'Cause here come the old Bear!âso clos't, his bref's Purt' nigh so's he kin feel how hot it is Ag'inst his bare feetâist like old âRing'sâ bref When he's be'n out a-huntin' an' 's all tired. So when th' old Bear's so clos'tâthe Little Boy Ist gives a grea'-big jump fer 'nother treeâ No!âno, he don't do that!âI tell you what The Little Boy does:âW'y, nenâw'y, heâOh, yes!â The Little Boy he finds a hole up there 'At's in the treeâan' climbs in there an' hidesâ An' nen th' old Bear can't find the Little Boy At all!âbut purty soon the old Bear finds The Little Boy's gun 'at's up thereâ'cause the gun It's too tall to tooked wiv him in the hole. So, when the old Bear find' the gun, he knows The Little Boy's ist hid round somers there,â An' th' old Bear 'gins to snuff an' sniff around, An' sniff an' snuff aroundâso's he kin find Out where the Little Boy's hid at.âAn' nenânenâ Oh, yes!âW'y, purty soon the old Bear climbs 'Way out on a big limbâa grea'-long limb,â An' nen the Little Boy climbs out the hole An' takes his ax an' chops the limb off! ... Nen The old Bear falls k-splunge! clean to the ground, An' bu'st an' kill hisse'f plum dead, he did! An' nen the Little Boy he git his gun An' 'menced a-climbin' down the tree ag'inâ No!âno, he didn't git his gunâ'cause when The Bear falled, nen the gun falled, tooâAn' broked It all to pieces, too!âAn' nicest gun!â His Pa ist buyed it!âAn' the Little Boy Ist cried, he did; an' went on climbin' down The treeâan' climbin' downâan' climbin' down!â An'-sir! when he 'uz purt' nigh down,âw'y, nen The old Bear he jumped up ag'in!âan' he Ain't dead at allâist 'tendin' thataway, So he kin git the Little Boy an' eat Him up! But the Little Boy he 'uz too smart To climb clean down the tree.âAn' the old Bear He can't climb up the tree no moreâ'cause when He fell, he broke one of hisâHe broke all His legs!âan' nen he couldn't climb! But he Ist won't go 'way an' let the Little Boy Come down out of the tree. An' the old Bear Ist growls round there, he doesâist growls an' goes âWooh!âwoo-ooh!â all the time! An' Little Boy He haf to stay up in the treeâall nightâ An' 'thout no supper neever!âOnly they Wuz apples on the tree!âAn' Little Boy Et applesâist all nightâan' criedâan' cried! Nen when 't'uz morning the old Bear went âWooh!â Ag'in, an' try to climb up in the tree An' git the Little BoyâBut he can't Climb t' save his soul, he can't!âAn' oh! he's mad!â He ist tear up the ground an' go âWoo-ooh!â An'âOh, yes!âpurty soon, when morning's come All lightâso's you kin see, you know,âw'y, nen The old Bear finds the Little Boy's gun, you know, 'At's on the ground.â(An' it ain't broke at allâ I ist said that!) An' so the old Bear think He'll take the gun an' shoot the Little Boy:â But Bears they don't know much 'bout shootin' guns: So when he go to shoot the Little Boy, The old Bear got the other end the gun Ag'in' his shoulder, 'stid o' th' other endâ So when he try to shoot the Little Boy, It shot the Bear, it didâan' killed him dead! An' nen the Little Boy clumb down the tree An' chopped his old woolly head off.âYes, an' killed The other Bear ag'in, he didâan' killed All boff the bears, he didâan' tuk 'em home An' cooked 'em, too, an' et 'em! âAn' that's all. THE PATHOS OF APPLAUSE The greeting of the company throughout Was like a jubilee,âthe children's shout And fusillading hand-claps, with great guns And detonations of the older ones, Raged to such tumult of tempestuous joy, It even more alarmed than pleased the boy; Till, with a sudden twitching lip, he slid Down to the floor and dodged across and hid His face against his mother as she raised Him to the shelter of her heart, and praised His story in low whisperings, and smoothed The âamber-colored hair,â and kissed and soothed And lulled him back to sweet tranquillityâ âAn' 'at's a sign 'at you're the Ma fer me!â He lisped, with gurgling ecstasy, and drew Her closer, with shut eyes; and feeling, too, If he could only purr now like a cat, He would undoubtedly be doing that! âAnd nowââthe serious host said, lifting there A hand entreating silence;âânow, aware Of the good promise of our Traveler guest To add some story with and for the rest, I think I favor you, and him as well, Asking a story I have heard him tell, And know its truth, in each minute detail:â Then leaning on his guest's chair, with a hale Hand-pat by way of full endorsement, he Said, âYesâthe Free-Slave storyâcertainly.â The old man, with his waddy note-book out, And glittering spectacles, glanced round about The expectant circle, and still firmer drew His hat on, with a nervous cough or two: And, save at times the big hard words, and tone Of gathering passionâall the speaker's own,â The tale that set each childish heart astir Was thus told by âThe Noted Traveler.â TOLD BY âTHE NOTED TRAVELERâ. Coming, clean from the Maryland-end Of this great National Road of ours, Through your vast West; with the time to spend, Stopping for days in the main towns, where Every citizen seemed a friend, And friends grew thick as the wayside flowers,â I found no thing that I might narrate More singularly strange or queer Than a thing I found in your sister-State Ohio,âat a river-townâdown here In my note-book: Zanesvilleâsituate On the stream Muskingumâbroad and clear, And navigable, through half the year, North, to Coshocton; south, as far As Marietta.âBut these facts are Not of the story, but the scene Of the simple little tale I mean To tell directlyâfrom this, straight through To the end that is best worth listening to: Eastward of Zanesville, two or three Miles from the town, as our stage drove in, I on the driver's seat, and he Pointing out this and that to me,â On beyond usâamong the restâ A grovy slope, and a fluttering throng Of little children, which he âguessedâ Was a picnic, as we caught their thin High laughter, as we drove along, Clearer and clearer. Then suddenly He turned and asked, with a curious grin, What were my views on Slavery? âWhy?â I asked, in return, with a wary eye. âBecause,â he answered, pointing his whip At a little, whitewashed house and shed On the edge of the road by the grove ahead,â âBecause there are two slaves there,â he saidâ âTwo Black slaves that I've passed each trip For eighteen years.âThough they've been set free, They have been slaves ever since!â said he. And, as our horses slowly drew Nearer the little house in view, All briefly I heard the history Of this little old Negro woman and Her husband, house, and scrap of land; How they were slaves and had been made free By their dying master, years ago In old Virginia; and then had come North here into a free Stateâso, Safe forever, to found a homeâ For themselves alone?âfor they left South there Five strong sons, who had, alas! All been sold ere it came to pass This first old master with his last breath Had freed the parents.â(He went to death Agonized and in dire despair That the poor slave children might not share Their parents' freedom. And wildly then He moaned for pardon and died. Amen!) Thus, with their freedom, and little sum Of money left them, these two had come North, full twenty long years ago; And, settling there, they had hopefully Gone to work, in their simple way, Haulingâgardeningâraising sweet Corn, and pop-corn.âBird and bee In the garden-blooms and the apple tree Singing with them throughout the slow Summer's day, with its dust and heatâ The crops that thirst and the rains that fail; Or in Autumn chill, when the clouds hung low, And hand-made hominy might find sale In the near town-market; or baking pies And cakes, to range in alluring show At the little window, where the eyes Of the Movers' children, driving past, Grew fixed, till the big white wagons drew Into a halt that would sometimes last Even the space of an hour or twoâ As the dusty, thirsty travelers made Their noonings there in the beeches' shade By the old black Aunty's spring-house, where, Along with its cooling draughts, were found Jugs of her famous sweet spruce-beer, Served with her gingerbread horses there, While Aunty's snow-white cap bobbed round Till the children's rapture knew no bound, As she sang and danced for them, quavering clear And high the chant of her old slave-daysâ âOh, Lo'd, Jinny! my toes is so', Dancin' on yo' sandy flo'!â Even so had they wrought all ways To earn the pennies, and hoard them, too,â And with what ultimate end in view?â They were saving up money enough to be Able, in time, to buy their own Five children back. Ah! the toil gone through! And the long delays and the heartaches, too, And self-denials that they had known! But the pride and glory that was theirs When they first hitched up their shackly cart For the long, long journey South!âThe start In the first drear light of the chilly dawn, With no friends gathered in grieving throng,â With no farewells and favoring prayers; But, as they creaked and jolted on, Their chiming voices broke in songâ ââHail, all hail! don't you see the stars a-fallin'? Hail, all hail! I'm on my way. Gideon am A healin' ba'mâ I belong to the blood-washed army. Gideon am A healin' ba'mâ On my way!ââ And their return!âwith their oldest boy Along with them! Why, their happiness Spread abroad till it grew a joy UniversalâIt even reached And thrilled the town till the Church was stirred Into suspecting that wrong was wrong!â And it stayed awake as the preacher preached A Real âLoveâ-text that he had not long To ransack for in the Holy Word. And the son, restored, and welcomed so, Found service readily in the town; And, with the parents, sure and slow, He went âsaltin' de cole cash down.â So with the next boyâand each one In turn, till four of the five at last Had been brought back; and, in each case, With steady work and good homes not Far from the parents, they chipped in To the family fund, with an equal grace. Thus they managed and planned and wrought, And the old folks throveâTill the night before They were to start for the lone last son In the rainy dawnâtheir money fast Hid away in the house,âtwo mean, Murderous robbers burst the door. ... Then, in the dark, was a scuffleâa fallâ An old man's gasping cryâand then A woman's fife-like shriek. ... Three men Splashing by on horseback heard The summons: And in an instant all Sprang to their duty, with scarce a word. And they were in timeânot only to save The lives of the old folks, but to bag Both the robbers, and buck-and-gag And land them safe in the county jailâ Or, as Aunty said, with a blended awe And subtlety,ââSafe in de calaboose whah De dawgs cain't bite 'em!â âSo prevail The faithful!âSo had the Lord upheld His servants of both deed and prayer,â His the glory unparalleledâ Theirs the reward,âtheir every son Free, at last, as the parents were! And, as the driver ended there In front of the little house, I said, All fervently, âWell done! well done!â At which he smiled, and turned his head, And pulled on the leader's lines, andââSee!â He said,ââyou can read old Aunty's sign?â And, peering down through these specs of mine On a little, square board-sign, I read: âStop, traveler, if you think it fit, And quench your thirst, for a-fi'-penny-bit.â The rocky spring is very clear, And soon converted into beer.â And, though I read aloud, I could Scarce hear myself for laugh and shout Of childrenâa glad multitude Of little people, swarming out Of the picnic-grounds I spoke about.â And in their rapturous midst, I see Againâthrough mists of memoryâ An old black Negress laughing up At the driver, with her broad lips rolled Back from her teeth, chalk-white, and gums Redder than reddest red-ripe plums. He took from her hand the lifted cup Of clear spring-water, pure and cold, And passed it to me: And I raised my hat And drank to her with a reverence that My conscience knew was justly due The old black face, and the old eyes, tooâ The old black head, with its mossy mat Of hair, set under its cap and frills White as the snows on Alpine hills; Drank to the old black smile, but yet Bright as the sun on the violet,â Drank to the gnarled and knuckled old Black hands whose palms had ached and bled And pitilessly been worn pale And white almost as the palms that hold Slavery's lash while the victim's wail Fails as a crippled prayer might fail.â Ay, with a reverence infinite, I drank to the old black face and headâ The old black breast with its life of lightâ The old black hide with its heart of gold. HEAT-LIGHTNING There was a curious quiet for a space Directly following: and in the face Of one rapt listener pulsed the flush and glow Of the heat-lightning that pent passions throw Long ere the crash of speech.âHe broke the spellâ The host:âThe Traveler's story, told so well, He said, had wakened there within his breast A yearning, as it were, to know the restâ That all unwritten sequence that the Lord Of Righteousness must write with flame and sword, Some awful session of His patient thought. Just then it was, his good old mother caught His blazing eyeâso that its fire became But as an emberâthough it burned the same. It seemed to her, she said, that she had heard It was the Heavenly Parent never erred, And not the earthly one that had such grace: âTherefore, my son,â she said, with lifted face And eyes, âlet no one dare anticipate The Lord's intent. While He waits, we will wait.â And with a gust of reverence genuine Then Uncle Mart was aptly ringing inâ ââIf the darkened heavens lower, Wrap thy cloak around thy form; Though the tempest rise in power, God is mightier than the storm!ââ Which utterance reached the restive children all As something humorous. And then a call For him to tell a story, or to âsay A funny piece.â His face fell right away: He knew no story worthy. Then he must Declaim for them: In that, he could not trust His memory. And then a happy thought Struck some one, who reached in his vest and brought Some scrappy clippings into light and said There was a poem of Uncle Mart's he read Last April in âThe Sentinel.â He had It there in print, and knew all would be glad To hear it rendered by the author. And, All reasons for declining at command Exhausted, the now helpless poet rose And said: âI am discovered, I suppose. Though I have taken all precautions not To sign my name to any verses wrought By my transcendent genius, yet, you see, Fame wrests my secret from me bodily; So I must needs confess I did this deed Of poetry red-handed, nor can plead One whit of unintention in my crimeâ My guilt of rhythm and my glut of rhyme.â ââMÃ¦onides rehearsed a tale of arms, And Naso told of curious metamurphoses; Unnumbered pens have pictured woman's charms, While crazy I've made poetry on purposes!â In other words, I stand convictedâneed I sayâby my own doing, as I read.â UNCLE MART'S POEM THE OLD SNOW-MAN Ho! the old Snow-Man That Noey Bixler made! He looked as fierce and sassy As a soldier on parade!â 'Cause Noey, when he made him, While we all wuz gone, you see, He made him, jist a-purpose, Jist as fierce as he could be!â But when we all got ust to him, Nobody wuz afraid Of the old Snow-Man That Noey Bixler made! 'Cause Noey told us 'bout him And what he made him fer:â He'd come to feed, that morning He found we wuzn't here; And so the notion struck him, When we all come taggin' home 'T'ud s'prise us ef a' old Snow-Man 'Ud meet us when we come! So, when he'd fed the stock, and milked, And be'n back home, and chopped His wood, and et his breakfast, he Jist grabbed his mitts and hopped Right in on that-air old Snow-Man That he laid out he'd make Er bu'st a trace a-tryin'âjist Fer old-acquaintance-sake!â But work like that wuz lots more fun, He said, than when he played! Ho! the old Snow-Man That Noey Bixler made! He started with a big snowball, And rolled it all around; And as he rolled, more snow 'ud stick And pull up off the ground.â He rolled and rolled all round the yardâ 'Cause we could see the track, All wher' the snow come off, you know, And left it wet and black. He got the Snow-Man's legs-part rolledâ In front the kitchen-door,â And then he hat to turn in then And roll and roll some more!â He rolled the yard all round ag'in, And round the house, at thatâ Clean round the house and back to wher' The blame legs-half wuz at! He said he missed his dinner, tooâ Jist clean fergot and stayed There workin'. Oh! the old Snow-Man That Noey Bixler made! And Noey said he hat to hump To git the top-half on The legs-half!âWhen he did, he said, His wind wuz purt' nigh gone.â He said, i jucks! he jist drapped down There on the old porch-floor And panted like a dog!âAnd then He up! and rolled some more!â The last batchâthat wuz fer his head,â Andâtime he'd got it right And clumb and fixed it on, he saidâ He hat to quit fer night!â And then, he said, he'd kep' right on Ef they'd be'n any moon To work by! So he crawled in bedâ And could 'a' slep' tel noon, He wuz so plum wore out! he said,â But it wuz washin'-day, And hat to cut a cord o' wood 'Fore he could git away! But, last, he got to work ag'in,â With spade, and gouge, and hoe, And trowel, tooâ(All tools 'ud do What Noey said, you know!) He cut his eyebrows out like cliffsâ And his cheek-bones and chin Stuck furder outâand his old nose Stuck out as fur-ag'in! He made his eyes o'walnuts, And his whiskers out o' this- Here buggy-cushion stuffin'âmoss, The teacher says it is. And then he made a' old wood' gun, Set keerless-like, you know, Acrost one shoulderâkind o' like Big Foot, er Adam Poeâ Er, mayby, Simon Girty, The dinged old Renegade! Wooh! the old Snow-Man That Noey Bixler made! And there he stood, all fierce and grim, A stern, heroic form: What was the winter blast to him, And what the driving storm?â What wonder that the children pressed Their faces at the pane And scratched away the frost, in pride To look on him again?â What wonder that, with yearning bold, Their all of love and care Went warmest through the keenest cold To that Snow-Man out there! But the old Snow-Manâ What a dubious delight He grew at last when Spring came on And days waxed warm and bright!â Alone he stoodâall kith and kin Of snow and ice were gone;â Alone, with constant tear-drops in His eyes and glittering on His thin, pathetic beard of blackâ Grief in a hopeless cause!â Hopeâhope is for the man that diesâ What for the man that thaws! O Hero of a hero's make!â Let marble melt and fade, But never youâyou old Snow-Man That Noey Bixler made! âLITTLE JACK JANITORâ And there, in that ripe Summer night, once more A wintry coolness through the open door And window seemed to touch each glowing face Refreshingly; and, for a fleeting space, The quickened fancy, through the fragrant air, Saw snowflakes whirling where the rose-leaves were, And sounds of veriest jingling bells again Were heard in tinkling spoons and glasses then. Thus Uncle Mart's old poem sounded young And crisp and fresh and clear as when first sung, Away back in the wakening of Spring, When his rhyme and the robin, chorusing, Rumored, in duo-fanfare, of the soon Invading Johnny-jump-ups, with platoon On platoon of sweet-williams, marshaled fine To bloomÃ¨d blarings of the trumpet-vine. The poet turned to whisperingly confer A moment with âThe Noted Traveler,â Then left the room, tripped up the stairs, and then An instant later reappeared again, Bearing a little, lacquered box, or chest, Which, as all marked with curious interest, He gave to the old Traveler, who in One hand upheld it, pulling back his thin Black luster coat-sleeves, saying he had sent Up for his âMagic Box,â and that he meant To test it thereâespecially to show The Children. âIt is empty now, you know.ââ He thumped it with his knuckles, so they heard The hollow soundââBut lest it be inferred It is not really empty, I will ask Little Jack Janitor, whose pleasant task It is to keep it ship-shape.â Then he tried And rapped the little drawer in the side, And called out sharply, âAre you in there, Jack?â And then a little, squeaky voice came back,â âOf course I'm in hereâain't you got the key Turned on me!â Then the Traveler leisurely Felt through his pockets, and at last took out The smallest key they ever heard about!â It wasn't any longer than a pin: And this at last he managed to fit in The little keyhole, turned it, and then cried, âIs everything swept out clean there inside?â âOpen the drawer and see! Don't talk so much; Or else,â the little voice squeaked, âtalk in Dutchâ You age me, asking questions!â Then the man Looked hurt, so that the little folks began To feel so sorry for him, he put down His face against the box and had to frown.â âCome, sir!â he called,ââno impudence to me!â You've swept out clean?â âOpen the drawer and see!â And so he drew the drawer out: Nothing there But just the empty drawer, stark and bare. He shoved it back again, with a sharp click.â âOuch!â yelled the little voiceââunsnap itâquick!â You've got my nose pinched in the crack!â And then The frightened man drew out the drawer again, The little voice exclaiming, âJee-mun-nee!â Say what you want, but please don't murder me!â âWell, then,â the man said, as he closed the drawer With care, âI want some cotton-batting for My supper! Have you got it?â And inside, All muffled-like, the little voice replied, âOpen the drawer and see!â And, sure enough, He drew it out, filled with the cotton stuff. He then asked for a candle to be brought And held for him; and tuft by tuft he caught And lit the cotton, and, while blazing, took It in his mouth and ate it, with a look Of purest satisfaction. âNow,â said he, âI've eaten the drawer empty, let me see What this is in my mouth:â And with both hands He began drawing from his lips long strands Of narrow silken ribbons, every hue And tint;âand crisp they were and bright and new As if just purchased at some Fancy-Store. âAnd now, Bub, bring your cap,â he said, âbefore Something might happen!â And he stuffed the cap Full of the ribbons. âThere, my little chap, Hold tight to them,â he said, âand take them to The ladies there, for they know what to do With all such rainbow finery!â He smiled Half sadly, as it seemed, to see the child Open his cap first to his mother. ... There Was not a ribbon in it anywhere! âJack Janitor!â the man said sternly through The Magic BoxââJack Janitor, did you Conceal those ribbons anywhere?â âWell, yes,â The little voice pipedââbut you'd never guess The place I hid 'em if you'd guess a year!â âWell, won't you tell me?â âNot until you clear Your mean old conscience,â said the voice, âand make Me first do something for the Children's sake.â âWell, then, fill up the drawer,â the Traveler said, âWith whitest white on earth and reddest red!â Your terms acceptedâAre you satisfied?â âOpen the drawer and see!â the voice replied. âWhy, bless my soul!ââthe man said, as he drew The contents of the drawer into viewâ âIt's level-full of candy!âPass it roundâ Jack Janitor shan't steal that, I'll be bound!ââ He raised and crunched a stick of it, and smacked His lips.ââYes, that is candy, for a fact!â And it's all yours!â And how the children there Lit into it!âO never anywhere Was such a feast of sweetness! âAnd now, then,â The man said, as the empty drawer again Slid to its place, he bending over it,â âNow, then, Jack Janitor, before we quit Our entertainment for the evening, tell Us where you hid the ribbonsâcan't you?â âWell,â The squeaky little voice drawled sleepilyâ âUnder your old hat, maybe.âLook and see!â All carefully the man took off his hat: But there was not a ribbon under that.â He shook his heavy hair, and all in vain The old white hatâthen put it on again: âNow, tell me, honest, Jack, where did you hide The ribbons?â âUnder your hat,â the voice replied.â âMind! I said âunderâ and not âinâ it.âWon't You ever take the hint on earth?âor don't You want to show folks where the ribbon's at?â Law! but I'm sleepy!âUnderâunner yet hat!â Again the old man carefully took off The empty hat, with an embarrassed cough, Saying, all gravely, to the children: âYou Must promise not to laughâyou'll all want toâ When you see where Jack Janitor has dared To hide those ribbonsâwhen he might have spared My feelings.âBut no matter!âKnow the worstâ Here are the ribbons, as I feared at first.ââ And, quick as snap of thumb and finger, there The old man's head had not a sign of hair, And in his lap a wig of iron-gray Lay, stuffed with all that glittering array Of ribbons. ... âTake 'em to the ladiesâYes. Good night to everybody, and God bless The Children.â In a whisper no one missed The Hired Man yawned: âHe's a vantrilloquist.â So gloried all the night. Each trundle-bed And pallet was enchantedâeach child-head Was packed with happy dreams. And long before The dawn's first far-off rooster crowned, the snore Of Uncle Mart was stilled, as round him pressed The bare arms of the wakeful little guest That he had carried home with him. ... âI think,â An awed voice saidââ(No: I don't want a dwink.â Lay still.)âI think âThe Noted Travelerâ he 'S the inscrutibul-est man I ever see!â ST. LIRRIPER When Dickens first dawned on us. ... Hey! to wake On such a morning now, to rise and break Brain-fast on such an appetizing spread As Mrs. Lirriper, the unconscious head And front of kindliest humanityâ With âJemmy Jackman, m'am,â full courteously Saluting âAfter you, m'amâ; and âOur boyââ The Junior Jemmy, with the zest and joy So strangely born out of the hopeless state Of sacred motherhood made violate, Yet glorified by the compassion of The mortal, answering the Immortal love. Writing like this must be, not from the wrist, But from the heart no reader may resist. âTHEM OLD CHEERY WORDSâ Pap he allus ust to say, âChris'mus comes but onc't a year!â Liked to hear him thataway, In his old split-bottomed cheer By the fireplace here at nightâ Wood all in,âand room all bright, Warm and snug, and folks all here: âChris'mus comes but onc't a year!â Me and 'Lize, and Warr'n and Jess And Eldory home fer two Weeks' vacation; and, I guess, Old folks tickled through and through, Same as we was,ââHome onc't more Fer another Chris'musâshore!â Pap 'ud say, and tilt his cheer,â âChris'mus comes but onc't a year!â Mostly Pap was ap' to be Ser'ous in his âdaily walk,â As he called it; giner'ly Was no hand to joke er talk.

Though, of ourselves, all poor are we, And frail and weak of wing, Your height is oursâyour ecstasyâ Your glory, when you sing. Most favored of the gods, and great In gifts beyond our store, We covet not your rich estate, But prize our own the more.â The gods give as but gods may doâ We count our riches thus,â They gave their richest gifts to you, And then gave you to us. HYMN EXULTANT FOR EASTER Voice of Mankind, sing over land and seaâ Sing, in this glorious morn! The long, long night is gone from Calvaryâ The cross, the thong and thorn; The sealed tomb yields up its saintly guest, No longer to be burdened and oppressed. Heart of Mankind, thrill answer to His own, So human, yet divine! For earthly love He left His heavenly throneâ For love like thine and mineâ For love of us, as one might kiss a bride, His lifted lips touched death's, all satisfied. Soul of Mankind, He wakesâHe lives once more! O soul, with heart and voice Sing! sing!âthe stone rolls chorus from the doorâ Our Lord stands forth.âRejoice! Rejoice, O garden-land of song and flowers; Our King returns to us, forever ours! âO LIFE! O BEYOND!â Strangeâstrange, O mortal Life, The perverse gifts that came to me from you! From childhood I have wanted all good things: You gave me few. You gave me faith in Oneâ Divineâabove your own imperious might, O mortal Life, while I but wanted you And your delight. I wanted dancing feet, And flowery, grassy paths by laughing streams; You gave me loitering steps, and eyes all blurred With tears and dreams. I wanted love,âand, lo! As though in mockery, you gave me loss. O'erburdened sore, I wanted rest: you gave The heavier cross. I wanted one poor hut For mine own home, to creep away into: You gave me only lonelier desert lands To journey through. Now, at the last vast verge Of barren age, I stumble, reel, and fling Me down, with strength all spent and heart athirst And famishing. Yea, now, Life, deal me death,â Your worstâyour vaunted worst! ... Across my breast With numb and fumbling hands I gird me for The best.

Fire-and-tow! It's a purty mean world, my lad! It's a purty bad world you've struck, young chapâ It's a purty bad world you've struckâ But study the cards that you hold, you know, And your hopes will sprout and your mustache grow, And your store-clothes likely will change your luck, And you'll rake a rich ladybird into your lap! But nowâDoubt All things out.â It's a purty bad world, young chap! It's a purty good world this is, old manâ It's a purty good world this is! For all its follies and shows and liesâ Its rainy weather, and cheeks likewise, And age, hard-hearin' and rheumatiz.â We're not a-faultin' the Lord's own planâ All things 's jest At their best.â It's a purty good world, old man! ON A YOUTHFUL PORTRAIT OF STEVENSON A face of youth mature; a mouth of tender, Sad, human sympathy, yet something stoic In clasp of lip: wide eyes of calmest splendor, And brow serenely ample and heroic:â The featuresâallâlit with a soul ideal ... O visionary boy! what were you seeing, What hearing, as you stood thus midst the real Ere yet one master-work of yours had being? Is it a foolish fancy that we humorâ Investing daringly with life and spirit This youthful portrait of you ere one rumor Of your great future spoke that men might hear it?â Is it a fancy, or your first of glories, That you were listening, and the camera drew you Hearing the voices of your untold stories And all your lovely poems calling to you? PROEM We found him in that Far-away that yet to us seems nearâ We vagrants of but yesterday when idlest youth was here,â When lightest song and laziest mirth possessed us through and through, And all the dreamy summer-earth seemed drugged with morning dew: When our ambition scarce had shot a stalk or blade indeed: Yours,âchoked as in the garden-spot you still deferred to âweedâ: Mine,âbut a pipe half-cleared of pithâas now it flats and whines In sympathetic cadence with a hiccough in the lines. Ay, even thenâO timely hour!âthe High Gods did confer In our behalf:âAnd, clothed in power, lo, came their Courierâ Not winged with flame nor shod with wind,âbut ambling down the pike, Horseback, with saddle-bags behind, and guise all human-like. And it was given us to see, beneath his rustic rind, A native force and mastery of such inspiring kind, That half unconsciously we made obeisance.âSmiling, thus His soul shone from his eyes and laid its glory over us. Though, faring still that Far-away that yet to us seems near, His form, through mists of yesterday, fades from the vision here, Forever as he rides, it is in retinue divine,â The hearts of all his time are his, with your hale heart and mine. RUBÃIYÃT OF DOC SIFERS I If you don't know Doc Sifers I'll jes' argy, here and now, You've bin a mighty little while about here, anyhow, 'Cause Doc he's rid these roads and woodsâer swum 'em, now and thenâ And practised in this neighberhood sence hain't no tellin' when! II In radius o' fifteen mil'd, all p'ints o' compass round, No man er woman, chick er child, er team, on top o' ground, But knows himâyes, and got respects and likin' fer him, too, Fer all his so-to-speak dee-fects o' genius showin' through! III Some claims he's absent-minded; some has said they wuz afeard To take his powders when he come and dosed 'em out, and 'peared To have his mind on somepin' elseâlike County Ditch, er some New way o' tannin' mussrat-pelts, er makin' butter come. IV He's cur'ousâthey hain't no mistake about it!âbut he's got Enough o' extry brains to make a juryâlike as not. They's no describin' Sifers,âfer, when all is said and done, He's jes' hisse'f Doc Sifersâner they hain't no other one! V Doc's allus sociable, polite, and 'greeable, you'll findâ Pervidin' ef you strike him right and nothin' on his mind,â Like in some hurry, when they've sent fer Sifers quick, you see, To 'tend some sawmill-accident, er picnic jamboree; VI Er when the lightin' 's struck some harebrained harvest-hand; er in Some 'tempt o' suicidin'âwhere they'd ort to try ag'in! I've knowed Doc haul up from a trot and talk a' hour er two When railly he'd a-ort o' not a-stopped fer âHowdy-do!â VII And then, I've met him 'long the road, a-lopin',âstarin' straight Ahead,âand yit he never knowed me when I hollered âYate, Old Saddlebags!â all hearty-like, er âWho you goin' to kill?â And he'd say nothin'âonly hike on faster, starin' still! VIII I'd bin insulted, many a time, ef I jes' wuzn't shore Doc didn't mean a thing. And I'm not tetchy any more Sence that-air day, ef he'd a-jes' a-stopped to jaw with me, They'd bin a little dorter less in my own fambily! IX Times now, at home, when Sifers' name comes up, I jes' let on, You know, 'at I think Doc's to blame, the way he's bin and gone And disapp'inted folksâ'Ll-jee-mun-nee! you'd ort to then Jes' hear my wife light into meââongratefulest o' men!â X 'Mongst all the womenâmild er rough, splendiferous er plain, Er them with sense, er not enough to come in out the rain,â Jes' ever' shape and build and style o' women, fat er slimâ They all like Doc, and got a smile and pleasant word fer him! XI Ner hain't no horse I've ever saw but what'll neigh and try To sidle up to him, and paw, and sense him, ear-and-eye: Then jes' a tetch o' Doc's old pa'm, to pat 'em, er to shove Along their noseâand they're as ca'm as any cooin' dove! XII And same with dogs,âtake any breed, er strain, er pedigree, Er racial caste 'at can't concede no use fer you er me,â They'll putt all predju-dice aside in Doc's case and go in Kahoots with him, as satisfied as he wuz kith-and-kin! XIII And Doc's a wonder, trainin' pets!âHe's got a chicken-hawk, In kind o' half-cage, where he sets out in the gyarden-walk, And got that wild bird trained so tame, he'll loose him, and he'll fly Clean to the woods!âDoc calls his nameâand he'll come, by and by! XIV Some says no money down 'ud buy that bird o' Doc.âNer no Inducement to the bird, says I, 'at he'd let Sifers go! And Doc he say 'at he's contentâlong as a bird o' prey Kin 'bide him, it's a compliment, and takes it thataway. XV But, gittin' back to docterin'âall the sick and in distress, And old and pore, and weak and small, and lone and motherless,â I jes' tell you I 'preciate the man 'at's got the love To âgo ye forth and ministrate!â as Scriptur' tells us of. XVI Dull times, Doc jes' mianders round, in that old rig o' his: And hain't no tellin' where he's bound ner guessin' where he is; He'll drive, they tell, jes' thataway fer maybe six er eight Days at a stretch; and neighbers say he's bin clean round the State. XVII He picked a' old tramp up, one trip, 'bout eighty mil'd from here, And fetched him home and k-yored his hip, and kep' him 'bout a year; And feller saidâin all his ja'nts round this terreschul ball 'At no man wuz a circumstance to Doc!âhe topped 'em all!â XVIII Said, bark o' trees 's a' open book to Doc, and vines and moss He read like writin'âwith a look knowed ever' dot and cross: Said, stars at night wuz jes' as good's a compass: said, he s'pose You couldn't lose Doc in the woods the darkest night that blows! XIX Said, Doc'll tell you, purty clos't, by underbresh and plants, How fur off warter is,âand 'most perdict the sort o' chance You'll have o' findin' fish; and how they're liable to bite, And whether they're a-bitin' now, er only after night. XX And, whilse we're talkin' fish,âI mind they formed a fishin'-crowd (When folks could fish 'thout gittin' fined, and seinin' wuz allowed!) O' leadin' citizens, you know, to go and seine âOld Blueââ But hadn't no big seine, and soâw'y, what wuz they to do? ... XXI And Doc he say he thought 'at he could knit a stitch er twoâ âBring the materials to meâ'at's all I'm astin' you!â And down he setsâsix weeks, i jing! and knits that seine plum doneâ Made corks too, brails and ever'thingâgood as a boughten one! XXII Doc's public speritâwhen the sick's not takin' all his time And he's got some fer politicsâis simple yit sublime:â He'll talk his principlesâand they air honest;âbut the sly Friend strikes him first, election-day, he'd 'commodate, er die! XXIII And yit, though Doc, as all men knows, is square straight up and down, That vote o' his isâwell, I s'poseâthe cheapest one in town;â A fact 'at's sad to verify, as could be done on oathâ I've voted Doc myse'fâAnd I was criminal fer both! XXIV You kin corrupt the ballot-boxâcorrupt yourse'f, as wellâ Corrupt some neighbers,âbut old Doc's as oncorruptible As Holy Writ. So putt a pin right there!âLet Sifers be, I jucks! he wouldn't vote ag'in' his own worst inimy! XXV When Cynthy Eubanks laid so low with fever, and Doc Glenn Told Euby Cynth 'ud haf to goâthey sends fer Sifers then! ... Doc sized the case: âShe's starved,â says he, âfer warterâyes, and meat! The treatment 'at she'll git from me's all she kin drink and eat!â XXVI He orders Euby then to split some wood, and take and build A fire in kitchen-stove, and git a young spring-chicken killed; And jes' whirled in and th'owed his hat and coat there on the bed, And warshed his hands and sailed in that-air kitchen, Euby said, XXVII And biled that chicken-broth, and got that dinnerâall complete And clean and crisp and good and hot as mortal ever eat! And Cynth and Euby both'll say 'at Doc'll git as good Meals-vittles up, jes' any day, as any woman could! XXVIII Time Sister Abbick tuk so bad with striffen o' the lung, P'tracted Meetin', where she had jes' shouted, prayed, and sung All winter long, through snow and thaw,âwhen Sifers come, says he: âNo, M'lissy; don't poke out your raw and cloven tongue at me!â XXIX âI know, without no symptoms but them injarubber-shoes You promised me to never putt a fool-foot in ner use At purril o' your life!â he said. âAnd I won't save you now, Onlessâhere on your dyin' bedâyou consecrate your vow!â XXX Without a-claimin' any creed, Doc's rail religious views Nobody knowsâner got no need o' knowin' whilse he choose To be heerd not of man, ner raise no loud, vain-glorious prayers In crowded marts, er public ways, erâi jucks, anywheres!â XXXI 'Less'n it is away deep down in his own heart, at night, Facin' the storm, when all the town's a-sleepin' snug and tightâ Him splashin' hence from scenes o' pride and sloth and gilded show, To some pore sufferer's bedside o' anguish, don't you know! XXXII Er maybe dead o' winterâmakes no odds to Doc,âhe's got To face the weather ef it takes the hide off! 'cause he'll not Lie out o' goin' and p'tend he's sick hisse'fâlike some 'At I could name 'at folks might send fer and they'd never come! XXXIII Like pore Phin Hooverâwhen he goes to that last dance o' his! That Chris'mus when his feet wuz frozeâand Doc saved all they is Left of 'emââ'Nough,â as Phin say now, âto track me by, and be A advertisement, anyhow, o' what Doc's done fer me!â XXXIV âWhen he comeâknife-and-sawââPhin say, âI knowed, ef I'd the spunk, 'At Doc 'ud fix me up some way, ef nothin' but my trunk Wuz left, he'd fasten casters in, and have me, spick-and-span, A-skootin' round the streets ag'in as spry as any man!â XXXV Doc sees a patient's got to quitâhe'll ease him down serene As dozin' off to sleep, and yit not dope him with morpheen.â He won't tell whatâjes' 'lows 'at he has âairnt the right to sing âO grave, where is thy victery! O death, where is thy sting!ââ XXXVI And, mind ye now!âit's not in scoff and scorn, by long degree, 'At Doc gits things like that-un off: it's jes' his shority And total faith in Life to Come,âw'y, âfrom that Land o' Bliss,â He says, âwe'll haf to chuckle some, a-lookin' back at this!â XXXVII And, still in p'int, I mind, one night o' 'nitiation at Some secert lodge, 'at Doc set right down on 'em, square and flat, When they mixed up some Scriptur' and wuz funnin'-likeâw'y, he Lit in 'em with a rep'imand 'at ripped 'em, A to Z! XXXVIII And onc'tâwhen gineral loafin'-place wuz old Shoe-Shopâand all The gang 'ud git in there and brace their backs ag'inst the wall And settle questions that had went onsettled long enough,â Like âwuz no Heav'nâner no tormentââjes' talkin' awful rough! XXXIX There wuz Sloke Haines and old Ike Knight and Coonrod Simmesâall three Ag'inst the Bible and the Light, and scoutin' Deity. âScience,â says Ike, âit DIMonstratesâit takes nobody's wordâ Scriptur' er not,âit 'vestigates ef sich things could occurred!â XL Well, Doc he heerd this,âhe'd drapped in a minute, fer to git A tore-off heel pegged on ag'in,âand, as he stood on it And stomped and grinned, he says to Ike, âI s'pose now, purty soon Some lightin'-bug, indignant-like, 'll 'vestigate the moon! ... XLI âNo, Ike,â says Doc, âthis world hain't saw no brains like yourn and mine With sense enough to grasp a law 'at takes a brain divine.â I've bared the thoughts of brains in doubt, and felt their finest pulse,â And mortal brains jes' won't turn out omnipotent results!â XLII And Doc he's got respects to spare the rich as well as poreâ Says he, âI'd turn no millionnaire onsheltered from my door.ââ Says he, âWhat's wealth to him in quest o' honest friends to back And love him fer hisse'f?ânot jes' because he's made his jack!â XLIII And childern.âChildern? Lawzy-day! Doc worships 'em!âYou call Round at his house and ast 'em!âthey're a-swarmin' thereâthat's all!â They're in his Lib'ryâin best roomâin kitchenâfur and near,â In office too, and, I p'sume, his operatin'-cheer! XLIV You know they's men 'at bees won't sting?âThey's plaguy few,âBut Doc He's one o' them.âAnd same, i jing! with childern;âthey jes' flock Round Sifers natchurl!âin his lap, and in his pockets, too, And in his old fur mitts and cap, and heart as warm and true! XLV It's cur'ous, too,â'cause Doc hain't got no childern of his ownâ 'Ceptin' the ones he's tuk and brought up, 'at's bin left alone And orphans when their father died, er mother,âand Doc he Has he'pped their dyin' satisfied.ââThe child shall live with me XLVI âAnd Winniferd, my wife,â he'd say, and stop right there, and cle'r His th'oat, and go on thinkin' way some mother-hearts down here Can't never feel their own babe's face a-pressin' 'em, ner make Their naked breasts a restin'-place fer any baby's sake. XLVII Doc's Lib'ryâas he calls it,âwell, they's ha'f-a-dozen she'ves Jam-full o' booksâI couldn't tell how manyâcount yourse'ves! One whole she'f's Works on Medicine! and most the rest's about First Settlement, and Indians in here,â'fore we driv 'em out.â XLVIII And Plutarch's Livesâand life also o' Dan'el Boone, and this- Here Mungo Park, and Adam Poeâjes' all the lives they is! And Doc's got all the novels out,âby Scott and Dickison And Cooper.âAnd, I make no doubt, he's read 'em ever' one! XLIX Onc't, in his office, settin' there, with crowd o'eight er nine Old neighbers with the time to spare, and Doc a-feelin' fine, A man rid up from Rollins, jes' fer Doc to write him out Some blame' p'scriptionâdone, I guess, in minute, nigh about.â L And I says, âDoc, you 'pear so spry, jes' write me that recei't You have fer bein' happy by,âfer that 'ud shorely beat Your medicine!â says I.âAnd quick as s'cat! Doc turned and writ And handed me: âGo he'p the sick, and putt your heart in it.â LI And then, âA-talkin' furder 'bout that line o' thought,â says he, âEf we'll jes' do the work cut out and give' to you and me, We'll lack no joy, ner appetite, ner all we'd ort to eat, And sleep like childern ever' nightâas puore and ca'm and sweet.â LII Doc has bin 'cused o' offishness and lack o' talkin' free And extry friendly; but he says, âI'm 'feard o' talk,â says he,â âI've got,â he says, âa natchurl turn fer talkin' fit to kill.â The best and hardest thing to learn is trick o' keepin' still.â LIII Doc kin smoke, and I s'pose he might drink lickerâjes' fer fun. He says, âYou smoke, you drink all right; but I don'tâneether oneââ Says, âI like whiskyâ'good old rye'âbut like it in its place, Like that-air warter in your eye, er nose there on your face.â LIV Doc's bound to have his joke! The day he got that off on me I jes' had sold a load o' hay at âScofield's Livery,â And tolled Doc in the shed they kep' the hears't in, where I'd hid The stuff 'at got me âout o' step,â as Sifers said it did. LV Doc hain't, to say, no ârollin' stone,â and yit he hain't no hand Fer 'cumulatin'.âHome's his own, and scrap o' farmin'-landâ Enough to keep him out the way when folks is tuk down sick The suddentestâ'most any day they want him 'special quick. LVI And yit Doc loves his practise; ner don't, wilful, want to slight No callâno matter whoâhow fur awayâer day er night.â He loves his workâhe loves his friendsâJune, Winter, Fall, and Spring: His lovin'âfacts isânever ends; he loves jes' ever'thing. ... LVII 'Ceptâkeepin' books. He never sets down no accounts.âHe hates, The worst of all, collectin' debtsâthe worst, the more he waits.â I've knowed him, when at last he had to dun a man, to end By makin' him a loanâand mad he hadn't more to lend. LVIII When Pence's Drug Store ust to be in full blast, they wuz some Doc's patients got things frekantly there, charged to him, i gum!â Doc run a bill there, don't you know, and allus when he squared, He never questioned nothin',âso he had his feelin's spared. LIX Now sich as that, I hold and claim, hain't 'scusableâit's not Perfessional!âIt's jes' a shame 'at Doc hisse'f hain't got No better business-sense! That's why lots 'd respect him more, And not give him the clean go-by fer other doctors. Shore! LX This-here Doc Glenn, fer instance; er this little jack-leg Hall;â They're businessâfolks respects 'em fer their business more'n all They ever knowed, er ever will, 'bout medicine.âYit they Collect their money, k-yore er kill.âThey're business, anyway! LXI You ast Jake Dunn:âhe's worked it out in figgers.âHe kin show Statistics how Doc's airnt about three fortunes in a row,â Ever' ten-year' hand-runnin' straightâthree of 'emâthirty year' 'At Jake kin count and 'lucidate o' Sifer's practise here. LXII YitââPraise the Lord,â says Doc, âwe've got out little home!â says heâ â(It's railly Winniferd's, but what she owns, she sheers with me.) We' got our little gyarden-spot, and peach and apple trees, And stable, too, and chicken-lot, and eighteen hive' o' bees.â LXIII You call it anything you please, but it's witchcraftâthe power 'At Sifers has o' handlin' bees!âHe'll watch 'em by the hourâ Mix right amongst 'em, mad and hot and swarmin'!âyit they won't Sting him, er want toâ'pear to not,âat least I know they don't. LXIV With me and bees they's no p'tense o' socialbilityâ A dad-burn bee 'ud climb a fence to git a whack at me! I s'pose no thing 'at's got a sting is railly satisfied It's sharp enough, ontel, i jing! he's honed it on my hide! LXV And Doc he's allus had a knack inventin' things.âDee-vised A windlass wound its own se'f back as it run down: and s'prised Their new hired girl with clothes-line, too, and clothes-pins, all in one: Purt' nigh all left fer her to do wuz git her primpin' done! LXVI And onc't, I mind, in airly Spring, and tappin' sugar trees, Doc made a dad-burn little thing to sharpen spiles withâthese- Here wood'-spouts 'at the peth's punched out, and driv' in where they bore The auger-holes. He sharpened 'bout a million spiles er more! LXVII And Doc's the first man ever swung a bucket on a tree Instid o' troughs; and first man brung grained sugarâso's 'at he Could use it fer his coffee, and fer cookin', don't you know.â Folks come clean up from Pleasantland 'fore they'd believe it, though! LXVIII And all Doc's stable-doors onlocks and locks theirse'vesâand gates The same way;âall rigged up like clocks, with pulleys, wheels, and weights,â So, 's Doc says, âDrivin' out, er in, they'll open; and they'll then, All quiet-like, shet up ag'in like little gentlemen!â LXIX And Doc 'ud made a mighty good detective.âNeighbers all Will testify to thatâer could, ef they wuz legal call: His theories on any crime is worth your listenin' to.â And he has hit 'em, many a time, long 'fore established true. LXX At this young druggist Wenfield Pence's trial fer his life, On primy faishy evidence o' pizonin' his wife, Doc's testimony saved and cle'red and 'quitted him and freed Him so's he never even 'peared cog-nizant of the deed! LXXI The facts wuzâSifers testified,âat inquest he had found The stummick showed the woman died o' pizon, but had downed The dos't herse'f,âbecause amount and cost o' drug imployed No druggist would, on no account, 'a' lavished and distroyed! LXXII Doc tracked a blame-don burglar down, and nailed the scamp, to boot, But told him ef he'd leave the town he wouldn't prosecute. He traced him by a tied-up thumb-print in fresh putty, where Doc glazed it. Jes' that's how he come to track him to his lair! LXXIII Doc's jes' a leetle too inclined, some thinks, to overlook The criminal and vicious kind we'd ort to bring to book And punish, 'thout no extry show o' sympathizin', where They hain't showed none fer us, you know. But he takes issue there: LXXIV Doc argies 'at âThe Red-eyed Law,â as he says, âort to learn To lay a mighty leenient paw on deeds o' sich concern As only the Good Bein' knows the wherefore of, and spreads His hands above accused and sows His mercies on their heads.â LXXV Doc even holds 'at murder hain't no crime we got a right To hang a man ferâclaims it's taint o' lunacy, er quite.â âHold sich a man responsibul fer murder,â Doc says,ââthen, When he's hung, where's the rope to pull them sound-mind jurymen? LXXVI âIt's in a nutshellâall kin see,â says Doc,ââit's cle'r the Law's As ap' to err as you er me, and kill without a cause: The man most innocent o' sin I've saw, er 'spect to see, Wuz servin' a life-sentence in the penitentchury.â LXXVII And Doc's a whole hand at a fire!âdirectin' how and where To set your ladders, low er higher, and what first duties air,â Like formin' warter-bucket-line; and best man in the town To chop holes in old roofs, and mine defective chimblies down: LXXVIII Er durin' any public crowd, mass-meetin', er big day, Where ladies ortn't be allowed, as I've heerd Sifers say,â When they's a suddent rush somewhere, it's Doc's voice, ca'm and cle'r, Says, âFall back, men, and give her air!âthat's all she's faintin' fer.â LXXIX The sorriest I ever feel fer Doc is when some show Er circus comes to town and he'll not git a chance to go. 'Cause he jes' natchurly delights in circusesâclean down From tumblers, in their spangled tights, to trick-mule and Old Clown. LXXX And ever'body knows it, too, how Doc is, thataway! ... I mind a circus onc't come throughâwuz there myse'f that day.â Ring-master cracked his whip, you know, to start the ridin'âwhen In runs Old Clown and hollers âWhoa!âLadies and gentlemen LXXXI âOf this vast audience, I fain would make inquiry cle'r, And learn, find out, and ascertainâIs Doctor Sifers here?â And when some fool-voice bellers down: âHe is! He's settin' in Full view o' ye!â âThen,â says the Clown, âthe circus may begin!â LXXXII Doc's got a temper; but, he says, he's learnt it which is boss, Yit has to watch it, more er less. ... I never seen him cross But onc't, enough to make him swear;âmilch-cow stepped on his toe, And Doc ripped out âI doggies!ââThere's the only case I know. LXXXIII Doc says that's what your temper's ferâto hold back out o' view, And learn it never to occur on out ahead o' you.â âYou lead the way,â says Sifersââgit your temper back in lineâ And furdest back the best, ef it's as mean a one as mine!â LXXXIV He hates contentionsâcan't abide a wrangle er dispute O' any kind; and he 'ull slide out of a crowd and skoot Up some back-alley 'fore he'll stand and listen to a furse When ary one's got upper-hand and t'other one's got worse. LXXXV Doc says: âI 'spise, when pore and weak and awk'ard talkers fails, To see it's them with hardest cheek and loudest mouth pervails.â A' all-one-sided quarr'l'll make me biassed, mighty near,â 'Cause ginerly the side I take's the one I never hear.â LXXXVI What 'peals to Doc the most and best is âseein' folks agreed, And takin' ekal interest and universal heed O' ever'body else's words and idiesâsame as we Wuz glad and chirpy as the birdsâjes' as we'd ort to be!â LXXXVII And paterotic! Like to git Doc started, full and fair, About the war, and why 't'uz fit, and what wuz 'complished there; âAnd who wuz wrong,â says Doc, âer right, 't'uz waste o' blood and tears, All prophesied in Black and White fer years and years and years!â LXXXVIII And then he'll likely kind o' tetch on old John Brown, and dwell On what his warnin's wuz; and ketch his breath and cough, and tell On down to Lincoln's death. And thenâwell, he jes' chokes and quits With âI must go now, gentlemen!â and grabs his hat, and gits! LXXXIX Doc's own war-rickord wuzn't won so much in line o' fight As line o' work and nussin' done the wownded, day and night.â His wuz the hand, through dark and dawn, 'at bound their wownds, and laid As soft as their own mother's on their forreds when they prayed. ... XC His wuz the face they saw the firstâall dim, but smilin' bright, As they come to and knowed the worst, yit saw the old Red-White- And-Blue where Doc had fixed it where they'd see it wavin' still, Out through the open tent-flap there, er 'crost the winder-sill. XCI And some's a-limpin' round here yitâa-waitin' Last Review,â 'Ud give the pensions 'at they git, and pawn their crutches, too, To he'p Doc out, ef he wuz pressed financial'âsame as he Has allus he'pped them when distressedâner never tuk a fee. XCII Doc never wuz much hand to pay attention to p'tense And fuss-and-feathers and display in men o' prominence: âA railly great man,â Sifers 'lows, âis not the out'ard dressedâ All uniform, salutes and bows, and swellin' out his chest. XCIII âI met a great man onc't,â Doc says, âand shuk his hand,â says he, âAnd he come 'bout in one, I guess, o' disapp'intin' meâ He talked so common-like, and brought his mind so cle'r in view And simple-like, I purt' nigh thought, âI'm best man o' the two!ââ XCIV Yes-sir! Doc's got convictions and old-fashioned kind o' ways And idies 'bout this glorious Land o' Freedom; and he'll raise His hat clean off, no matter where, jes' ever' time he sees The Stars and Stripes a-floatin' there and flappin' in the breeze. XCV And tunes like old âRed-White-and-Blueâ 'll fairly drive him wild, Played on the brass band, marchin' through the streets! Jes' like a child I've saw that man, his smile jes' set, all kind o' pale and white, Bareheaded, and his eyes all wet, yit dancin' with delight! XCVI And yit, that very man we see all trimbly, pale and wann, Give him a case o' surgery, we'll see another man!â We'll do the trimblin' then, and we'll git white around the gillsâ He'll show us nerve o' nerves, and he 'ull show us skill o' skills! XCVII Then you could toot your horns and beat your drums and bang your guns, And wave your flags and march the street, and charge, all Freedom's sons!â And Sifers then, I bet my hat, 'ud never flinch a hair, But, stiddy-handed, 'tend to that pore patient layin' there. XCVIII And Sifers' eye's as stiddy as that hand o' his!âHe'll shoot A' old-style rifle, like he has, and smallest bore, to boot, With any fancy rifles made to-day, er expert shot 'At works at shootin' like a tradeâand all some of 'em's got! XCIX Let 'em go right out in the woods with Doc, and leave their âtrapsâ And blame' glass-balls and queensware-goods, and see how Sifers draps A squirrel out the tallest tree.âAnd 'fore he fires he'll say Jes' where he'll hit himâyes, sir-ee! And he's hit thataway! C Let 'em go out with him, i jucks! with fishin'-pole and gun,â And ekal chances, fish and ducks, and take the rain, er sun, Jes' as it pours, er as it blinds the eyesight; then I guess 'At they'd acknowledge, in their minds, their disadvantages. CI And yit he'd be the last man out to flop his wings and crow Insultin'-like, and strut about above his fallen foe!â No-sir! the hand 'at tuk the wind out o' their sails 'ud be The very first they grabbed, and grinned to feel sich sympathy. CII Doc gits off now and then and takes a huntin'-trip somewhere 'Bout Kankakee, up 'mongst the lakesâsometimes'll drift round there In his canoe a week er two; then paddle clean on back By way o' old Wabash and Blue, with fishâall he kin pack,â CIII And wild ducksâsome with feathers on 'em yit, and stuffed with grass. And neighbersâall knows he's bin goneâcomes round and gits a bassâ A great big double-breasted ârock,â er âblack,â er maybe pair Half fills a' ordinary crock. ... Doc's fish'll give out there CIV Long 'fore his ducks!âBut folks'll smile and blandish him, and make Him tell and tell things!âall the while enjoy 'em jes' fer sake O' pleasin' him; and then turn in and la'nch him from the start A-tellin' all the things ag'in they railly know by heart. CV He's jes' a child, 's what Sifers is! And-sir, I'd ruther see That happy, childish face o' his, and puore simplicity, Than any shape er style er plan o' mortals otherwiseâ With perfect faith in God and man a-shinin' in his eyes. TAMÃM WHERE THE CHILDREN USED TO PLAY The old farm-home is Mother's yet and mine, And filled it is with plenty and to spare,â But we are lonely here in life's decline, Though fortune smiles around us everywhere: We look across the gold Of the harvests, as of oldâ The corn, the fragrant clover, and the hay; But most we turn our gaze, As with eyes of other days, To the orchard where the children used to play. O from our life's full measure And rich hoard of worldly treasure We often turn our weary eyes away, And hand in hand we wander Down the old path winding yonder To the orchard where the children used to play. Our sloping pasture-lands are filled with herds; The barn and granary-bins are bulging o'er; The grove's a paradise of singing birdsâ The woodland brook leaps laughing by the door; Yet lonely, lonely still, Let us prosper as we will, Our old hearts seem so empty every wayâ We can only through a mist See the faces we have kissed In the orchard where the children used to play. O from our life's full measure And rich hoard of worldly treasure We often turn our weary eyes away, And hand in hand we wander Down the old path winding yonder To the orchard where the children used to play. MR. FOLEY'S CHRISTMAS There's nothing sweet in the city But the patient lives of the poor. John Boyle O'Reilly I Since pick av them I'm sore denied 'Twixt play or work, I say, Though it be Christmas, I decide I'll work whilst others play: I'll whustle, too, wid Christmas pride To airn me extry pay.â It's like the job's more glorified That's done a-holiday!

Be wholly good to us, just as of old; As a pleased father, let thine arms infold Us, homed within the haven of thy love, And all the cheer and wholesomeness thereof. Thou lone reality, when O so long Life's unrealities have wrought us wrong: Ambition hath allured us,âfame likewise, And all that promised honor in men's eyes. Throughout the world's evasions, wiles, and shifts, Thou only bidest stable as thy gifts:â A grateful king re-ruleth from thy lap, Crowned with a little tinseled soldier-cap: A mighty generalâa nation's prideâ Thou givest again a rocking-horse to ride, And wildly glad he groweth as the grim Old jurist with the drum thou givest him: The sculptor's chisel, at thy mirth's command, Is as a whistle in his boyish hand; The painter's model fadeth utterly, And there thou standest,âand he painteth thee:â Most like a winter pippin, sound and fine And tingling-red that ripe old face of thine, Set in thy frosty beard of cheek and chin As midst the snows the thaws of spring set in Ho! Santa Clausâour own since Infancyâ Most tangible of all the gods that be!â As first we scampered to theeânow, as then, Take us as children to thy heart again. CHRISTMAS ALONG THE WIRES SceneâHoosier railway station, Washout Glen NightâInterior of Telegraph OfficeâSingle operator's table in some disorderâlunch-basket, litter of books and sheet-musicâa flute and a guitarâ Rather good-looking young man, evidently in charge, talking to commercial traveler. Junction-StationâPilot Knobâ Say âthe operator there Is a girlâwith auburn hair And blue eyes, and purty, too, As they make 'em!ââThat'll do!â They all know her 'long the Lineâ Railroad men, from President Of the road to section-hand!â And she knows usâthe whole mob Of us lightnin'-slingersâShoo!â Brownie's got us all down fine! Though she's business, understand, Brownie she just beats the band! Brownie she's held up that job Five or six years anyhowâ Since her father's death, when all The whole road decided now Was no time for nothin' small,â It was Brownie's job! Since ten Years of age she'd been with him In the office. Now, I guess, She was sixteen, more or lessâ Just a girl, but strong and trim, And as independent, too, And reliable clean through As the old man when he died Two mile' up the track beside His red-light, one icy night When the line broke downâand yet He got there in time, you bet, To shut off a wreck all right! Yes, some life here, and romanceâ Pilot Knob, though, and Roachdale, And this little eight-by-ten Dinky town of Washout Glen Have to pool inhabitants Even for enough young men To fill out a country dance,â All chip in on some joint-date, And whack up and pony down And combine and celebrate,â Say, on Decoration Dayâ Fourth o' JulyâEaster, or Circus-Day, or Christmas, sayâ All three towns, and right-o'-way Fer two extrys,âone from hereâ One down from the Knob. Well, then Roachdale is herself again! Like last Christmas, when all three Towns collogued, and far and near Billed things for a Christmas-Tree At old Roachdale. Now mark here:â I had leave, last Holidays, And was goin' home, you see, Two weeksâand the Company Sent a man to fill my placeâ An old chum of mine, in fact, I'd been coaxin' to arrange Just to have his dressin'-case And his latest music packed And come on here for a change. He'd been here to visit me Once beforeâin summer then,â Come to stay âjust two or three Days,â he saidâand he stayed ten. When he left here thenâWell, he Was clean gone on Brownieâwild And plum silly as a child! NameâMacClintock. Most young men Stood 'way back when Mac was round. Fact is, he was fine, you knowâ Silver-tenor voice that went Up among the stars, and sent The girls back to higher-tone' Dreams than they had ever known! A good-lookerâstylishâslimâ And wore clothes that no man downedâ Yes, and smoked a good cigar And smelt right; and used to blow A smooth fluteâAnd a guitar No man heard till he heard him!â Say, some midnight serenadeâ Oomh! how drippin'-sweet he played! Boys, though, wasn't stuck on Mac So blame' much,âespecially Roachdale operator.âHe Kind o' had the inside-track On all of us, as to who Got most talk from Brownie, when She had nothin' else to do But to buzz us now and then Up and down the wires, you know; And we'd jolly back again 'Bout some danceâand âWould she go With us or her Roachdale beau?â (Boys all called him âRoachyââsee?)â Wire her, âWas she âHappy nowâ?â And âHow's âRoachy,â anyhow?â Or, âSay, Brownie, who's the jay You was stringin' yesterday?â And I've sat here when this key Shot me like a battery, Just 'cause Brownie wired to say That âThat box o' fruit, or flowers, That âI'dâ sent her came O. K.,â To beguile the weary hours Till we met again!ââThen break Short offâfor the Roachdale cuss Callin' her, and on to us. 'Course he'd sent 'emâno mistake! Lord, she kept that man awake! Yet he kept her fooled: His cheek And pure goody-goody gall Hid from herâif not from allâ A quite vivid âyellow streak.ââ Awful' jealous, don't you see?â Felt he had a right to be, Maybe, bein' engaged.âAnd they Were engagedâthat's straight.ââG A!â Telegraphers' abbreviation for âGo ahead.ââ Well: MacClintock when he come Down from York to take this job, And stopped off at Pilot Knob For âinstructions,â there was some Indications of unrest At Roachdale right from the start,â âRoachyâ wasn't awful' smart, Maybe, but he done his bestâ With such brains as he possessed.â Anyway he made one play That was brilliantâof its kindâ And maintained it.âFrom the day That MacClintock took my key And I left on Number Three, âRoachyâ opened up on Mac And just loved him!âpurred and whined 'Cross the wires how tickled he Was to hear that Mac was back, And how glad the girls would be And the young-folks everywhere, As he'd reason to believe,â And how, even then, they were âShapin' things at old Roachdale For a blow-out, Christmas-eve, That would turn all others pale!â First a Christmas-Tree, at old Armory Hall, and then the floor Cleared, andââ âCome in out the cold!â Breaks MacClintockââDon't I know?â Dancin', say, from ten till fourâ Maybe daylight 'fore we go!â With Ben Custer's Band to pour Music out in swirlin' rills And back-tides o' waltz-quadrilles Level with the window-sills!â Roachy, you're a bird!âBut, say,â How am I to get away From the office here?â Well, then âRoachyâ wires him back again:â âThat's O. K.,âI call a man Up from Dunkirk; got it all Fixed.âSo Christmas-eve, you can Collar the seven-thirty train For Roachdaleâthe same that he Comes on.âLeave your office-key In the door: he'll do the rest.â Then âold Roachyâ rattled through A long list of who'd be there,â Boys and girls that Mac knew bestâ One name, though, that had no bare Little mention anywhere! Then he shut off, as he said, For his supper. ... About ten Minutes Mac was called againâ With a click that flushed him red As the signal-flagâand then Came like music in the airâ âYes, and Brownie will be there!â Folks tell me, that Christmas-Tree, Dance and whole blame' jamboree, Looked like it was goin' to be A blood-curdlin' tragedy. People 'long the roads, you knowâ Well, they've had experience With all sorts of accidents, And they've learnt some things,âand so When an accident or wreck Happens, they know some man's âbreakâ Is responsible, and henceâ Wellâthey want to break his neck! So it happened, Christmas-eve, At Roachdale,âMacClintock there Cocked back in the barber-chair At eight-forty, and no train Down yet from the Knob, and it Due at eight-ten sharp. The strain Was a-showin' quite a bit On the general crowd; and when Purty soon the rumor spreadâ Wreck had probably occurredâ Some one said somebody said That he'd heard somebody say, âOperator at the Glen Was to blame for the delayâ Fact is, he had run away From his officeâEven then Was in Roachdaleâthere to be Present at the Christmas-Tree And the âshindigâ afterward, Wreck or no wreck!â ... Mac sat up, Whiter than the shavin'-cup. ... Back of his face in the glass He stared into he could see A big crowd thereâand, alas! Not in all that threatening throng One friend's face of sympathyâ One friend knowin' right from wrong! He got on his feetâerectâ Nervy;âfaced the crowd, and then Said: âI am MacClintock from The Glen-office, and I've come To your Christmas festival By request of one that all Of you honor, gentlemen,â Your most trusted citizenâ Your own operator here At the station-officeâwhere He'll acquit me of neglect, And will make it plain and clear Who the sub. is he sent there To my office at the Glenâ Or, if not one there,âwho then Is indeed the criminal? ... I am going now to call On him.âJoin me, gentlemenâ I insist you come with me.â Well, a sense of some respect Caught 'em,âand they followed, all, Silently, though sullenly. Fortunately, half a square Brought 'em to the station and The crowd there that packed the small Waiting-room on every hand, With a kind o' general stand Round the half-door window through Which âold Roachy,â in full view, Sat there, smilin' in a sick Sort o' way, yet gloryin', too, In the work he had to do. Mac worked closer, breathin' quick At the muttered talk of some Of the toughest of the crowd; Till, above the growl and hum Of the ominous voices, he Heard the click of âRoachy'sâ key,â And his heart beat 'most out 'loud As he heard him wirin':ââYes, Trouble down at Glen, I guess. Glen's fool-operator hereâ What's-his-name?âMacClintock.âFear Mob will hang him.âMob knows he Left his office.âAnd no doubt Wreck there on account of it. People worked-up hereâand shout Now and then to âTake him out!ââ âHang him!ââand so forth.â ... Mac lit Through the half-door window at âRoachy'sâ table like a cat:â He was white, but âRoachy'sâ face Made a brunette out o' his! ... Mac had pinned him in his chair Helplessâand a message there Clickin' back from Pilot Knob.â âTell these people, word-for-word,â Mac says, âwhat this message is!â âTell 'em.âHear me?â âRoachyâ heard And obeyed:âââWe sized your job On MacClintock.âKnob here sent A sub. there.âAnd all O. K. At Glen-office.âTie-up hereâ One hour's waitâall fault of mine. âHang MacClintock,â did you say? âHang MacClintock?ââCertainly,â Hang him on the Christmas-Tree, With a label on for me,â I'll be there on Number Nine.ââ TO THE BOY WITH A COUNTRY DAN WALLINGFORD Dan Wallingford, my jo Dan!â Though but a child in years, Your patriot spirit thrills the land And wakens it to cheers,â You lift the flagâyou roll the drumsâ We hear the bugle blow,â Till all our hearts are one with yours, Dan Wallingford, my jo! AT CROWN HILL Leave him here in the fresh greening grasses and trees And the symbols of love, and the solace of theseâ The saintly white lilies and blossoms he keeps In endless caress as he breathlessly sleeps. The tears of our eyes wrong the scene of his rest, For the sky's at its clearestâthe sun's at its bestâ The earth at its greenestâits wild bud-and-bloom At its sweetestâand sweetest its honey'd perfume. Home! home!âLeave him here in his lordly estate, And with never a tear as we turn from the gate! Turn back to the home that will know him no more,â The vines at the windowâthe sun through the door.â Nor sound of his voice, nor the light of his face! ... But the birds will sing on, and the rose, in his place, Will tenderly smile till we daringly feign He is home with us still, though the tremulous rain Of our tears reappear, and again all is bloom, And all prayerless we sob in the long-darkened room. Heaven portions it thusâthe old mystery dim,â It is midnight to usâit is morning to him. SNOW IN THE AIR Snow is in the airâ Chill in blood and vein,â Winter everywhere Save in heart and brain! Ho! the happy year will be Mimic as we've found it,â Head of itâand you, and meâ With the holly round it! Frost and sleet, alack!â Wind as bleak as wrath Whips our faces back As we foot the path;â But the yearâfrom there to hereâ Copy as we've found it,â Heart upâlike the head, my dear, With the holly round it! THE NAME OF OLD GLORY 1898 I Old Glory! say, who, By the ships and the crew, And the long, blended ranks of the gray and the blue,â Who gave you, Old Glory, the name that you bear With such pride everywhere As you cast yourself free to the rapturous air And leap out full-length, as we're wanting you to?â Who gave you that name, with the ring of the same, And the honor and fame so becoming to you?â Your stripes stroked in ripples of white and of red, With your stars at their glittering best overheadâ By day or by night Their delightfulest light Laughing down from their little square heaven of blue!â Who gave you the name of Old Glory?âsay, whoâ Who gave you the name of Old Glory? The old banner lifted, and faltering then In vague lisps and whispers fell silent again. II Old Glory,âspeak out!âwe are asking about How you happened to âfavorâ a name, so to say, That sounds so familiar and careless and gay As we cheer it and shout in our wild breezy wayâ Weâthe crowd, every man of us, calling you thatâ WeâTom, Dick, and Harryâeach swinging his hat And hurrahing âOld Glory!â like you were our kin, WhenâLord!âwe all know we're as common as sin! And yet it just seems like you humor us all And waft us your thanks, as we hail you and fall Into line, with you over us, waving us on Where our glorified, sanctified betters have gone.â And this is the reason we're wanting to knowâ (And we're wanting it so!â Where our own fathers went we are willing to go.)â Who gave you the name of Old GloryâOho!â Who gave you the name of Old Glory? The old flag unfurled with a billowy thrill For an instant, then wistfully sighed and was still. III Old Glory: the story we're wanting to hear Is what the plain facts of your christening were,â For your nameâjust to hear it, Repeat it, and cheer it, 's a tang to the spirit As salt as a tear;â And seeing you fly, and the boys marching by, There's a shout in the throat and a blur in the eye And an aching to live for you alwaysâor die, If, dying, we still keep you waving on high. And so, by our love For you, floating above, And the scars of all wars and the sorrows thereof, Who gave you the name of Old Glory, and why Are we thrilled at the name of Old Glory? Then the old banner leaped, like a sail in the blast, And fluttered an audible answer at last.â IV And it spake, with a shake of the voice, and it said:â By the driven snow-white and the living blood-red Of my bars, and their heaven of stars overheadâ By the symbol conjoined of them all, skyward cast, As I float from the steeple, or flap at the mast, Or droop o'er the sod where the long grasses nod,â My name is as old as the glory of God. ... So I came by the name of Old Glory. ONE WITH A SONG FRANK L. STANTON He sings: and his song is heard, Pure as a joyous prayer, Because he sings of the simple thingsâ The fields, and the open air, The orchard-bough, and the mocking-bird, And the blossoms everywhere. He sings of a wealth we hold In common ownershipâ The wildwood nook, and the laugh of the brook, And the dewdrop's drip and drip, The love of the lily's heart of gold, And the kiss of the rose's lip. The universal heart Leans listening to his lay That glints and gleams with the glimmering dreams Of children at their playâ A lay as rich with unconscious art As the first song-bird's of May. Ours every rapturous tone Of every song of glee, Because his voice makes native choice Of Nature's harmonyâ So that his singing seems our own, And ours his ecstasy. Steadfastly, bravely glad Above all earthly stress, He lifts his line to heights divine, And, singing, ever says,â This is a better world than badâ God's love is limitless. He sings: and his song is heard, Pure as a joyous prayer, Because he sings of the simple thingsâ The fields, and the open air, The orchard-bough, and the mocking-bird, And the blossoms everywhere. INDIANA Our Landâour Home!âthe common home indeed Of soil-born children and adopted onesâ The stately daughters and the stalwart sons Of Industry:âAll greeting and godspeed! O home to proudly live for, and, if need Be, proudly die for, with the roar of guns Blent with our latest prayer.âSo died men once. ... Lo, Peace! ... As we look on the land They freedâ Its harvests all in ocean-overflow Poured round autumnal coasts in billowy goldâ Its corn and wine and balmÃ¨d fruits and flow'rs,â We know the exaltation that they know Who now, steadfast inheritors, behold The Land Elysian, marveling âThis is ours!â CHRISTMAS AFTERTHOUGHT After a thoughtful, almost painful pause, Bub sighed, âI'm sorry fer old Santy Claus:â They wuz no Santy Claus, ner couldn't be, When he wuz ist a little boy like me!â THE CHRISTMAS LONG AGO Come, sing a hale Heigh-ho For the Christmas long ago!â When the old log-cabin homed us From the night of blinding snow, Where the rarest joy held reign, And the chimney roared amain, With the firelight like a beacon Through the frosty window-pane. Ah! the revel and the din From without and from within, The blend of distant sleigh-bells With the plinking violin; The muffled shrieks and criesâ Then the glowing cheeks and eyesâ The driving storm of greetings, Gusts of kisses and surprise. CLAUDE MATTHEWS Steadfastly from his childhood's earliest hourâ From simplest country life to state and powerâ His worth has known advancement,âeach new height A newer glory in his fellow's sight. So yet his happy fateâthough mute the breath Of thronging multitudes and thundrous cheers,â Faith sees him raised still higher, through our tears, By this divine promotion of his death. THE SERMON OF THE ROSE Wilful we are, in our infirmity Of childish questioning and discontent. Whate'er befalls us is divinely meantâ Thou Truth the clearer for thy mystery! Make us to meet what is or is to be With fervid welcome, knowing it is sent To serve us in some way full excellent, Though we discern it all belatedly. The rose buds, and the rose blooms, and the rose Bows in the dews, and in its fulness, lo, Is in the lover's hand,âthen on the breast Of her he loves,âand there dies.âAnd who knows What fate of all a rose may undergo Is fairest, dearest, sweetest, loveliest? Nay, we are children: we will not mature. A blessed gift must seem a theft; and tears Must storm our eyes when but a joy appears In drear disguise of sorrow; and how poor We seem when we are richest,âmost secure Against all poverty the lifelong years We yet must waste in childish doubts and fears That, in despite of reason, still endure! Alas! the sermon of the rose we will Not wisely ponder; nor the sobs of grief Lulled into sighs of rapture, nor the cry Of fierce defiance that again is still. Be patientâpatient with our frail belief, And stay it yet a little ere we die. O opulent life of ours, though dispossessed Of treasure after treasure! Youth most fair Went first, but left its priceless coil of hairâ Moaned over, sleepless nights, kissed and caressed Through drip and blur of tears the tenderest. And next went Loveâthe ripe rose glowing there, Her very sister! ... It is here, but where Is she, of all the world the first and best? And yet how sweet the sweet earth after rainâ How sweet the sunlight on the garden-wall Across the rosesâand how sweetly flows The limpid yodel of the brook again! And yetâand yet how sweeter, after all, The smoldering sweetness of a dead red rose! THE ONWARD TRAIL MYRON W. REED, DENVER, JANUARY 30, 1899 Just as of old,âwith fearless foot And placid face and resolute, He takes the faint, mysterious trail That leads beyond our earthly hail. We would cry, as in last farewell, But that his hand waves, and a spell Is laid upon our tongues: and thus He takes unworded leave of us. And it is fitting:âAs he fared Here with us, so is he prepared For any fortuning the night May hold for him beyond our sight. The moon and stars they still attend His wandering footsteps to the end,â He did not question, nor will we, Their guidance and security. So, never parting word nor cry:â We feel, with him, that by and by Our onward trails will meet and then Merge and be ever one again. TO LESLEY Burns sang of bonny Lesley As she gaed o'er the border,â Gaed like vain Alexander, To spread her conquests farther. I sing another Lesley, Wee girlie, more alluring, Who stays at home, the wise one, Her conquests there securing. A queen, too, is my Lesley, And gracious, though blood-royal, My heart her throne, her kingdom, And I a subject loyal. Long shall you reign, my Lesley, My pet, my darling dearie, For love, oh, little sweetheart, Grows never old or weary. THE NATURALIST OLIVER DAVIE In gentlest worship has he bowed To Nature. Rescued from the crowd And din of town and thoroughfare, He turns him from all worldly care Unto the sacred fastness of The forests, and the peace and love That breathes there prayer-like in the breeze And coo of doves in dreamful treesâ Their tops in laps of sunshine laid, Their lower boughs all slaked with shade. With head uncovered has he stood, Hearing the Spirit of the Woodâ Hearing aright the Master speak In trill of bird, and warbling creek; In lisp of reeds, or rainy sigh Of grasses as the loon darts byâ Hearing aright the storm and lull, And all earth's voices wonderful,â Even this hail an unknown friend Lifts will he hear and comprehend. HER WAITING FACE In some strange place Of long-lost lands he finds her waiting faceâ Comes marveling upon it, unaware, Set moonwise in the midnight of her hair. EXCEEDING ALL Long life's a lovely thing to know, With lovely health and wealth, forsooth, And lovely name and fameâBut O The loveliness of Youth! A SONG OF THE ROAD O I will walk with you, my lad, whichever way you fare, You'll have me, too, the side o' you, with heart as light as air; No care for where the road you take's a-leadin'âanywhere,â It can but be a joyful ja'nt the whilst you journey there. The road you take's the path o' love, an' that's the bridth o' twoâ And I will walk with you, my ladâO I will walk with you. Ho! I will walk with you, my lad, Be weather black or blue Or roadsides frost or dew, my ladâ O I will walk with you. Ay, glad, my lad, I'll walk with you, whatever winds may blow, Or summer blossoms stay our steps, or blinding drifts of snow; The way that you set face and foot's the way that I will go, And brave I'll be, abreast o' you, the Saints and Angels know! With loyal hand in loyal hand, and one heart made o' two, Through summer's gold, or winter's cold, it's I will walk with you. Sure, I will walk with you, my lad, As love ordains me to,â To Heaven's door, and through, my lad, O I will walk with you. THE ENDURING A misty memoryâfaint, far away And vague and dim as childhood's long-lost dayâ Forever haunts and holds me with a spell Of awe and wonder indefinable:â A grimy old engraving tacked upon A shoe-shop wall.âAn ancient temple, drawn Of crumbling granite, sagging portico, And gray, forbidding gateway, grim as woe; And o'er the portal, cut in antique line, The wordsâcut likewise in this brain of mineâ âWouldst have a friend?âWouldst know what friend is best? Have GOD thy friend: He passeth all the rest.â Again the old shoemaker pounds and pounds Resentfully, as the loud laugh resounds And the coarse jest is bandied round the throng That smokes about the smoldering stove; and long, Tempestuous disputes arise, and thenâ Even as all like discordsâdie again; The while a barefoot boy more gravely heeds The quaint old picture, and tiptoeing reads There in the rainy gloom the legend o'er The lowering portal of the old church doorâ âWouldst have a friend?âWouldst know what friend is best? Have GOD thy friend: He passeth all the rest.â So olderâolderâolder, year by year, The boy has grown, that now, an old man here, He seems a part of Allegory, where He stands before Life as the old print thereâ Still awed, and marveling what light must be Hid by the door that bars Futurity:â Though, ever clearer than with eyes of youth, He reads with his old eyesâand tears forsoothâ âWouldst have a friend?âWouldst know what friends is best? Have GOD thy friend: He passeth all the rest.â A HUMBLE SINGER A modest singer, with meek soul and heart, Sat, yearning that his art Might but inspire and suffer him to sing Even the simplest thing. And as he sang thus humbly, came a Voice:â âAll mankind shall rejoice, Hearing thy pure and simple melody Sing on immortally.â THE NOBLEST SERVICE DR. WYCKLIFFE SMITH, LATE SURGEON 161ST REGIMENT INDIANA VOLUNTEERS, DELPHI, DECEMBER 29, 1899 If all his mourning friends unselfishly Might speak, high over grief, in one accord, What voice of joy were lifted to the Lord For having lent our need such ministry As this man's life has ever proved to be! Yea, even through battle-crash of gun and sword His steadfast step still found the pathway toward The noblest service paid Humanity. O ye to whose rich firesides he has brought A richer light! O watcher at the door Of the lone cabin! O kindred! Comrades!âall! Since universal good he dreamed and wrought, Be brave, to pleasure him, as, on before, He leads us, answering Glory's highest call. OLD MAN WHISKERY-WHEE-KUM-WHEEZE Old Man Whiskery-Whee-Kum-Wheeze Lives 'way up in the leaves o' trees. An' wunst I slipped up-stairs to play In Aunty's room, while she 'uz away; An' I clumbed up in her cushion-chair An' ist peeked out o' the winder there; An' there I sawâwite out in the treesâ Old Man Whiskery-Whee-Kum-Wheeze!

An' see my cup O' locus'-blossoms they've plum filled up?â An' âUm-yum, honey!â wuz last he said, An' waggled his whiskers an' bowed his head; An' I yells, âGimme some, won't you, please, Old Man Whiskery-Whee-Kum-Wheeze?â LITTLE-GIRL-TWO-LITTLE-GIRLS I'm twins, I guess, 'cause my Ma say I'm two little girls. An' one o' me Is Good little girl; an' th' other 'n' she Is Bad little girl as she can be! An' Ma say so, 'most ever' day. An' she's the funniest Ma!

An' she Ain't pop'lar as she ust to be! When 'Pollus Morton speaks, w'y, nen Ist all the other childern knows They're smart as him an' smart-again!â Ef they can't speak an' got fine clo'es, Their Parunts loves 'em more'n 'Poll- Us Morton, Teacher, speech, an' all! A PARENT REPRIMANDED Sometimes I think 'at Parunts does Things ist about as bad as usâ Wite 'fore our vurry eyes, at that!

IN FERVENT PRAISE OF PICNICS Picnics is fun 'at's purty hard to beat. I purt' nigh ruther go to them than eat.â I purt' nigh ruther go to them than go With our Charlotty to the Trick-Dog Show! THE HOME-VOYAGE GENERAL HENRY W. LAWTONâFELL AT SAN MATEO, DECEMBER 19, 1899. IN STATE, INDIANAPOLIS, FEBRUARY 6, 1900 Bear with us, O Great Captain, if our pride Show equal measure with our grief's excess In greeting you in this your helplessness To countermand our vanity or hide Your stern displeasure that we thus had tried To praise you, knowing praise was your distress: But this home-coming swells our hearts no lessâ Because for love of home you proudly died. Lo! then, the cable, fathoms 'neath the keel That shapes your course, is eloquent of you; The old flag, too, at half-mast overheadâ We doubt not that its gale-kissed ripples feel A prouder sense of red and white and blue,â The starsâAh, God, were they interpreted! In strange lands were your latest honors wonâ In strange wilds, with strange dangers all beset; With rain, like tears, the face of day was wet, As rang the ambushed foeman's fateful gun: And as you felt your final duty done, We feel that glory thrills your spirit yet,â When at the front, in swiftest death, you met The patriot's doom and best reward in one. And so the tumult of that island war, At last, for you, is stilled forevermoreâ Its scenes of blood blend white as ocean foam On your rapt vision as you sight afar The sails of peace, and from that alien shore The proud ship bears you on your voyage home. Or rough or smooth the wave, or lowering day Or starlit skyâyou hold, by native right, Your high tranquillityâthe silent might Of the true heroâso you led the way To victory through stormiest battle-fray, Because your followers, high above the fight, Heard your soul's lightest whisper bid them smite For God and man and space to kneel and pray. And thus you cross the seas unto your own Beloved land, convoyed with honors meet, Saluted as your home's first heritageâ Nor salutation from your State alone, But all the States, gathered in mighty fleet, Dip colors as you move to anchorage. TO THE QUIET OBSERVER ERASMUS WILSON, AFTER HIS LONG SILENCE Dear old friend of us all in need Who know the worth of a friend indeed, How rejoiced are we all to learn Of your glad return. We who have missed your voice so longâ Even as March might miss the song Of the sugar-bird in the maples when They're tapped again. Even as the memory of these Blended sweets,âthe sap of the trees And the song of the birds, and the old camp too, We think of you. Hail to you, then, with welcomes deep As grateful hearts may laugh or weep!â You give us not only the bird that sings, But all good things. PROEM TO âHOME-FOLKSâ You Home-Folks:âAid your grateful guestâ Bear with his pondering, wandering ways: When idlest he is busiest, Being a dreamer of the days. Humor his silent, absent moodsâ His restless quests along the shores Of the old creek, wound through the woods, The haws, papaws, and sycamores: The side-path homeâthe back-way past The old pump and the dipper there; The afternoon of dreamy Juneâ The old porch, and the rocking-chair. Yea, bear with him a little spaceâ His heart must smolder on a while Ere yet it flames out in his face A wholly tearless smile. OUR BOYHOOD HAUNTS Ho! I'm going back where We were youngsters.âMeet me there, Dear old barefoot chum, and we Will be as we used to be,â Lawless rangers up and down The old creek beyond the townâ Little sunburnt gods at play, Just as in that far-away:â Water nymphs, all unafraid, Shall smile at us from the brink Of the old mill-race and wade Tow'rd us as we kneeling drink At the spring our boyhood knew, Pure and clear as morning-dew: And, as we are rising there, Doubly dow'r'd to hear and see, We shall thus be made aware Of an eery piping, heard High above the happy bird In the hazel: And then we, Just across the creek, shall see (Hah! the goaty rascal!) Pan Hoof it o'er the sloping green, Mad with his own melody, Ay, and (bless the beasty man!) Stamping from the grassy soil BruisÃ¨d scents of fleur-de-lis, Boneset, mint, and pennyroyal. UNCLE SIDNEY'S LOGIC Pa wunst he scold' an' says to me,â âDon't play so much, but try To study more, and nen you'll be A great man, by an' by.â Nen Uncle Sidneys says, âYou let Him be a boy an' play.â The greatest man on earth, I bet, 'Ud trade with him to-day!â HIS LOVE OF HOME âAs love of native land,â the old man said, âEr stars and stripes a-wavin' overhead, Er nearest kith-and-kin, er daily bread, A Hoosier's love is fer the old homestead.â TO âUNCLE REMUSâ We love your dear old face and voiceâ We're all Miss Sally's Little Boys, Climbin' your knee, In ecstasy, Rejoicin' in your Creeturs' joys And trickery. The Lord who made the day and night, He made the Black man and the White; So, in like view, We hold it true That He hain't got no favoriteâ Onless it's you. THE BALLADE OF THE COMING RAIN When the morning swoons in its highest heat, And the sunshine dims, and no dark shade Streaks the dust of the dazzling street, And the long straw splits in the lemonade; When the circus lags in a sad parade, And the drum throbs dull as a pulse of pain, And the breezeless flags hang limp and frayedâ O then is the time to look for rain. When the man on the watering-cart bumps by, Trilling the air of an old fife-tune, With a dull, soiled smile, and one shut eye, Lost in a dream of the afternoon; When the awning sags like a lank balloon, And a thick sweat stands on the window-pane, And a five-cent fan is a priceless boonâ O then is the time to look for rain. When the goldfish tank is a grimy gray, And the dummy stands at the clothing-store With a cap pulled on in a rakish way, And a rubber-coat with the 'hind before; When the man in the barber chair flops o'er And the chin he wags has a telltale stain, And the bootblack lurks at the open doorâ O then is the time to look for rain. TO THE JUDGE A VOICE FROM THE INTERIOR OF OLD HOOP-POLE TOWNSHIP Friend of my earliest youth, Can't you arrange to come down And visit a fellow out here in the woodsâ Out of the dust of the town? Can't you forget you're a Judge And put by your dolorous frown And tan your wan face in the smile of a friendâ Can't you arrange to come down? Can't you forget for a while The arguments prosy and drear,â To lean at full-length in indefinite rest In the lap of the greenery here? Can't you kick over âthe Bench,â And âhuskâ yourself out of your gown To dangle your legs where the fishing is goodâ Can't you arrange to come down? Bah! for your office of State! And bah! for its technical lore! What does our President, high in his chair, But wish himself low as before! Pick between peasant and king,â Poke your bald head through a crown Or shadow it here with the laurels of Spring!â Can't you arrange to come down? âJudge itâ out here, if you will,â The birds are in session by dawn; You can draw, not complaints, but a sketch of the hill And a breath that your betters have drawn; You can open your heart, like a case, To a jury of kine, white and brown, And their verdict of âMooâ will just satisfy you!â Can't you arrange to come down? Can't you arrange it, old Pard?â Pigeonhole Blackstone and Kent!â Here we have âBreitmann,â and Ward, Twain, Burdette, Nye, and content! Can't you forget you're a Judge And put by your dolorous frown And tan your wan face in the smile of a friendâ Can't you arrange to come down? A WHOLLY UNSCHOLASTIC OPINION Plain hoss-sense in poetry-writin' Would jes' knock sentiment a-kitin'! Mostly poets is all star-gazin' And moanin' and groanin' and paraphrasin'! A SHORT'NIN' BREAD SONGâPIECED OUT Behine de hen-house, on my knees, Thought I hearn a chickin sneezeâ Sneezed so hard wi' de whoopin'-cough I thought he'd sneeze his blame' head off. Chorus Fotch dat dough fum the kitchin-shedâ Rake dem coals out hot an' redâ Putt on de oven an' putt on de led,â Mammy's gwineter cook some short'nin' bread. O I' got a house in Baltimo'â Street-kyars run right by my do'â Street-kyars run right by my gate, Hit's git up soon an' set up late. (Chorus) De raincrow hide in some ole tree An' holler out, all hoarse, at meâ Sayes, âWhen I sing, de rain hit po' So's you ain't 'bleedged to plow no mo'!â (Chorus) Ole man Toad, on High-low Hill, He steal my dram an' drink his fill,â Heels in the path, an' toes in the grassâ Hit ain't de fus' time an' shain't be de las'! (Chorus) When corn-plantin' done come roun', Blackbird own de whole plowed-groun',â Corn in de grain, as I've hearn said, Dat's de blackbird's short'nin' bread. (Chorus) De sweetes' chune what evah I heard Is de sairanade o' de mockin'-bird; Whilse de mou'nfullest an' de least I love Is de Sund'y-song o' de ole woods-dove. (Chorus) I nevah ain't know, outside o' school, A smartah mare dan my ole mule,â I holler âWo,â an' she go âgee,â Des lak, de good Lord chast'nin' me. (Chorus) Hit's no houn'-pup I taken to raise Hain't nevah jes'ly airn' my praise: De mo' cawn-pone I feed dat pup, De mo' he des won't fattnin up. (Chorus) I hangs a hoss-shoe ovah my head, An' I keeps a' ole sieve under de bed, So, quinchiquently, I sleep soun', Wid no ole witches pester'n' roun'. (Chorus) I jine de chu'ch las' Chuesday night, But when Sis' Jane ain't treat me right I 'low her chu'ch ain' none o' mine, So I 'nounce to all I done on-jine. (Chorus) THE UNHEARD I One in the musical throng Stood forth with his violin; And warm was his welcome, and long The later applause and the din.â He had uttered, with masterful skill, A melody hailed of men; And his own blood leapt a-thrill, As they thundered again. II Another stood forth.âAnd a rose Bloomed in her hairâlikewise One at her tremulous throatâ And a rapture bloomed in her eyes. Tempests of cheers upon cheers, Praises to last a life long; Roses in showers of tearsâ All for her song. III One sat apart and alone, Her lips clasped close and straight, Uttering never a tone That the World might hear, elateâ Uttering never a low Murmurous verse nor a part Of the veriest songâBut O The song in her heart! EQUITYâ? The meanest man I ever saw Allus kep' inside o' the law; And ten-times better fellers I've knowed The blame' gran'-jury's sent over the road. MOONSHINER'S SERENADE The night's blind-black, an' I 'low the stars's All skeered at that-air dog's bow-wows! I sensed the woods-road, clumb the bars, An' arrove here, tromplin' over cows. The mist hangs thick enough to cut, But there's her light a-glimmerin' through The mornin'-glories, twisted shutâ An' shorely there's her shadder too! Ho! hit's good night, My Beauty-Bright! The moon cain't match your can'le-lightâ Your can'le-light with you cain't shine, Lau-ree! Lady-love! tiptoe-fine! Oomh! how them roses soaks the air!â Thess drenched with mist an' renched with dew! They's a smell o' plums, too, 'round somewhereâ An' I kin smell ripe apples, too. Mix all them sweet things into one,â Yer roses, fruit, an' flower an' vine, Yit I'll say, âNo, I don't choose none, Ef I kin git that gal of mine!â Ho! hit's good night, My Beauty-Bright! Primp a while, an' blow out the lightâ Putt me in your prayers, an' then I'll be twic't as good-again! IN A BOX I saw them last night in a box at the playâ Old age and young youth side by side.â You might know by the glasses that pointed that way That they wereâa groom and a bride; And you might have known, too, by the face of the groom, And the tilt of his head, and the grim Little smile of his lip, he was proud to presume That we men were all envying him. Well, she was superbâan Elaine in the faceâ A Godiva in figure and mien, With the arm and the wrist of a Parian âGrace,â And the high-lifted brow of a queen; But I thought, in the splendor of wealth and of pride, And her beauty's ostensible prize, I should hardly be glad if she sat by my side With that far-away look in her eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME VIII THE EDGE OF THE WIND Ye stars in ye skies seem twinkling In icicles of light, And ye edge of ye wind cuts keener Than ever ye sword-edge might; Ye footsteps crunch in ye courtway, And ye trough and ye cask go âping!ââ Ye china cracks in ye pantry, And ye crickets cease to sing. THE HIRED MAN'S FAITH IN CHILDREN I believe all childern's good, Ef they're only understood,â Even bad ones, 'pears to me, 'S jes' as good as they kin be! THE LOVELY HUSBAND [I] Oh a love-ly hus-band he was known, He loved his wife and her a-lone; She reaped the harvest he had sown; She ate the meat; he picked the bone. With mixed admirers ev-'ry size, She smiled on each with out disguise; This love-ly hus-band closed his eyes Lest he might take her CHORUS. by sur-prise. Trot! Run! Was-n't he a han-dy hub-by? What Fun She could plot and plan! Not One Oth-er such a dan-dy hub-by As this love-ly man! II He answered at her least command: He fanned her, if she would be fanned; He vanished when she willed it.âAnd He always coughed behind his hand. She held him in such high esteem She let him dope her face with âCream,ââ He'd chink the wrinkles seam-by-seam, And call her âlovely as a dream!âCHORUS Hot Bun! Wasn't he a lovey-dovey? What Fun She could plot and plan! Not One Other such a dovey-lovey As this love-ly man! III Her lightest wishes he foreknew And fell up-stairs to cater to: He never failed to back from view, Nor mispronounced Don't ( ) you âDoan chu.â He only sought to fill such space As her friends left;âhe knew his place:â He praised the form she could not lace.â He praised her face before her face!CHORUS Shot Gun! Wasn't he a lovely fellow? What Fun She could plot and plan! Not One Lonesome little streak of yellow In this love-ly man! THREE SEVERAL BIRDS The Romancer, the Poet, and the Bookman I THE ROMANCER The Romancer's a nightingale,â The moon wanes dewy-dim And all the stars grow faint and pale In listening to him.â To him the plot least plausible Is of the most avail,â He simply masters it because He takes it by the tale. O he's a nightingale,â His theme will never failâ It gains applause of allâbecause He takes it by the tale! The Romancer's a nightingale:â His is the sweetest noteâ The sweetest, woe-begonest wail Poured out of mortal throat: So, glad or sad, he ever draws Our best godspeed and hail; He highest lifts his themeâbecause He takes it by the tale. O he's a nightingale,â His theme will never failâ It gains applause of allâbecause He takes it by the tale! II THE POET The bobolink he sings a single song, Right along,â And the robin sings another, all his ownâ One alone; And the whippoorwill, and bluebird, And the cockadoodle-doo-bird;â But the mocking-bird he sings in every tone Ever known, Or chirrup-note of merriment or moan. So the Poet he's the mocking-bird of men,â He steals his songs and sings them o'er again; And yet beyond believing They're the sweeter for his thieving.â So we'll howl for Mister Mocking-bird And have him out again! It's mighty fond we are of bobolinks, And chewinks; And we dote on dinky robins, quite a fewâ Yes, we do; And we love the dove, and bluebird, And the cockadoodle-doo-bird,â But the mocking-bird's the bird for me and you, Through and through, Since he sings as everybody wants him to. Ho! the Poet he's the mocking-bird of men,â He steals his songs and sings them o'er again; And yet beyond believing They're the sweeter for his thieving.â So we'll howl for Mister Mocking-bird And have him out again! III BOOKMAN'S CATCH The Bookman he's a humming-birdâ His feasts are honey-fine,â (With hi! hilloo! And clover-dew And roses lush and rare!) His roses are the phrase and word Of olden tomes divine; (With hi! and ho! And pinks ablow And posies everywhere!) The Bookman he's a humming-bird,â He steals from song to songâ He scents the ripest-blooming rhyme, And takes his heart along And sacks all sweets of bursting verse And ballads, throng on throng. (With ho! and hey! And brook and brae, And brinks of shade and shine!) A humming-bird the Bookman isâ Though cumbrous, gray and grim,â (With hi! hilloo! And honey-dew And odors musty-rare!) He bends him o'er that page of his As o'er the rose's rim (With hi! and ho! And pinks aglow And roses everywhere!) Ay, he's the featest humming-bird,â On airiest of wings He poises pendent o'er the poem That blossoms as it singsâ God friend him as he dips his beak In such delicious things! (With ho! and hey! And world away And only dreams for him!) THE BED I âThou, of all God's gifts the best, BlessÃ¨d Bed!â I muse, and rest Thinking how it havened me In my dazÃ¨d Infancyâ Ere mine eyes could bear the kind Daylight through the window-blind, Or my lips, in yearning quest, Groping found the mother-breast, Or mine utterance but owned Minor sounds that sobbed and moaned. II Gracious Bed that nestled me Even ere the mother's knee,â Lulling me to slumber ere Conscious of my treasure thereâ Save the tiny palms that kept Fondling, even as I slept, That rare dual-wealth of mine,â Softest pillowâsweetest wine!â Gentlest cheer for mortal guest, And of Love's fare lordliest. III By thy grace, O Bed, the first Blooms of Boyhood-memories burst:â Dreams of riches, swift withdrawn As I, wakening, find the dawn With its glad Spring-face once more Glimmering on me as of yore: Then the bluebird's limpid cry Lulls me like a lullaby, Till falls every failing sense Back to sleep's sheer impotence. IV Or, a truant, home again,â With the moonlight through the pane, And the kiss that ends the prayerâ Then the footsteps down the stair; And the close hush; and far click Of the old clock; and the thick Sweetness of the locust-bloom Drugging all the enchanted room Into darkness fathoms deep As mine own pure childish sleep. V Gift and spell, O Bed, retell Every lovely miracleâ Up from childhood's simplest dream Unto manhood's pride supreme!â Sacredness no words express,â Lo, the young wife's fond caress Of her first-born, while beside Bends the husband, tearful-eyed, Marveling of kiss and prayer Which of these is holier there. VI Trace the vigils through the long, Long nights, when the cricket's song Stunned the sick man's fevered brain, As he tossed and moaned in pain Piteousâtill thou, O Bed, Smoothed the pillows for his head, And thy soothest solace laid Round him, and his fever weighed Into slumber deep and cool, And divinely merciful. VII Thus, O Bed, all gratefully I would ever sing of theeâ Till the final sleep shall fall O'er me, and the crickets call In the grasses where at last I am indolently cast Like a play-worn boy at will.â 'Tis a Bed befriends me stillâ Yea, and Bed, belike, the best, Softest, safest, blessÃ¨dest. HOME-FOLKS Home-folks!âWell, that-air name, to me, Sounds jis the same as poetryâ That is, ef poetry is jis As sweet as I've hearn tell it is! Home-Folksâthey're jis the same as kinâ All brung up, same as we have bin, Without no overpowerin' sense Of their oncommon consequence! They've bin to school, but not to git The habit fastened on 'em yit So as to ever interfere With other work 'at's waitin' here: Home-Folks has crops to plant and plow, Er lives in town and keeps a cow; But whether country-jakes er town-, They know when eggs is up er down! La! can't you spot 'emâwhen you meet 'Em anywheresâin field er street? And can't you see their faces, bright As circus-day, heave into sight? And can't you hear their âHowdy!â clear As a brook's chuckle to the ear, And allus find their laughin' eyes As fresh and clear as morning skies? And can't youâwhen they've gone awayâ Jis feel 'em shakin' hands, all day? And feel, too, you've bin higher raised By sich a meetin'?âGod be praised! Oh, Home-Folks! you're the best of all 'At ranges this terreschul ball,â But, north er south, er east er west, It's home is where you're at your best.â It's homeâit's home your faces shine, In-nunder your own fig and vineâ Your fambly and your neighbers 'bout Ye, and the latch-string hangin' out. Home-Folksâat home,âI know o' one Old feller now 'at hain't got none.â Invite himâhe may hold back someâ But you invite him, and he'll come. AMERICA'S THANKSGIVING 1900 Father all bountiful, in mercy bear With this our universal voice of prayerâ The voice that needs must be Upraised in thanks to Thee, O Father, from Thy children everywhere. A multitudinous voice, wherein we fain Wouldst have Thee hear no lightest sob of painâ No murmur of distress, Nor moan of loneliness, Nor drip of tears, though soft as summer rain. And, Father, give us first to comprehend, No ill can come from Thee; lean Thou and lend Us clearer sight to see Our boundless debt to Thee, Since all thy deeds are blessings, in the end. And let us feel and know that, being Thine, We are inheritors of hearts divine, And hands endowed with skill, And strength to work Thy will, And fashion to fulfilment Thy design. So, let us thank Thee, with all self aside, Nor any lingering taint of mortal pride; As here to Thee we dare Uplift our faltering prayer, Lend it some fervor of the glorified. We thank Thee that our land is loved of Thee The blessÃ¨d home of thrift and industry, With ever-open door Of welcome to the poorâ Thy shielding hand o'er all abidingly. Even thus we thank Thee for the wrong that grew Into a right that heroes battled to, With brothers long estranged, Once more as brothers ranged Beneath the red and white and starry blue. Ay, thanksâthough tremulous the thanks expressedâ Thanks for the battle at its worst, and bestâ For all the clanging fray Whose discord dies away Into a pastoral song of peace and rest. TO EDMUND CLARENCE STEDMAN THE AUTHORS' CLUB RECEPTION, NEW YORK DECEMBER 6, 1900 It is a various tribute you command, O Poet-seer and World-sage in one!â The scholar greets you; and the student; and The stoicâand his visionary son: The painter, harvesting with quiet eye Your features; and the sculptor, dreaming, too, A classic marble figure, lifted high Where Fame's immortal ones are waiting you. The man of letters, with his wistful face; The grizzled scientist; the young A.B.; The true historian, of force and grace; The orator, of pure simplicity; The journalistâthe editor, likewise; The young war-correspondent; and the old War-seasoned general, with sagging eyes, And nerve and hand of steel, and heart of gold. The serious humorist; the blithe divine; The lawyer, with that twinkling look he wears; The bleak-faced man in the dramatic line; The social lionâand the bulls and bears; Theseâthese, and more, O favored guest of all, Have known your benefactions, and are led To pay their worldly homage, and to call Down Heaven's blessings on your honored head. Ideal, to the utmost plea of artâ As real, to labor's most exacting need,â Your dual services of soul and heart Enrich the world alike in dream and deed: For you have brought to us, from out the mine Delved but by genius in scholastic soil, The blended treasures of a wealth divine,â Your peerless gift of songâyour life of toil. WHEN WE FIRST PLAYED âSHOWâ Wasn't it a good time, Long Time Agoâ When we all were little tads And first played âShowâ!â When every newer day Wore as bright a glow As the ones we laughed awayâ Long Time Ago! Calf was in the back-lot; Clover in the red; Bluebird in the pear tree; Pigeons on the shed; Tom a-chargin' twenty pins At the barn; and Dan Spraddled out just like âThe âInjarubberâ-Man!â Me and Bub and Rusty, Eck and Dunk and Sid, âTumblinâ on the sawdust Like the A-rabs did; Jamesy on the slack-rope In a wild retreat, Grappling back, to start againâ When he chalked his feet! Wasn't Eck a wonder, In his stocking-tights? Wasn't Dunkâhis leaping lionâ Chief of all delights? Yes, and wasn't âLittle Mackâ Boss of all the Show,â Both Old Clown and Candy-Butcherâ Long Time Ago! Sid the Bareback-Rider; Andâoh-me-oh-my!â Bub, the spruce Ring-Master, Stepping round so spry!â In his little waist-and-trousers All made in one, Was there a prouder youngster Under the sun! And NOWâwho will tell me,â Where are they all? Dunk's a sanatorium doctor, Up at Waterfall; Sid's a city street-contractor; Tom has fifty clerks; And Jamesy he's the âIron Magnateâ Of âThe Hecla Works.â And Bub's old and bald now, Yet still he hangs on,â Dan and Eck and âLittle Mack,â Long, long gone! But wasn't it a good time, Long Time Agoâ When we all were little tads And first played âShowâ! WILLIAM PINKNEY FISHBACK Say first he loved the dear home-hearts, and then He loved his honest fellow citizenâ He loved and honored him, in any post Of duty where he served mankind the most. All that he asked of him in humblest need Was but to find him striving to succeed; All that he asked of him in highest place Was justice to the lowliest of his race. When he found these conditions, proved and tried, He owned he marveled, but was satisfiedâ Relaxed in vigilance enough to smile And, with his own wit, flay himself a while. Often he liked real angerâas, perchance, The summer skies like storm-clouds and the glance Of lightningâfor the clearer, purer blue Of heaven, and the greener old earth, too. All easy things to do he did with care, Knowing the very common danger there; In noblest conquest of supreme debate The facts are simple as the victory great. That which had been a task to hardiest minds To him was a pleasure, such as finds The captive-truant, doomed to read throughout The one lone book he really cares about. Study revived him: Howsoever dim And deep the problem, 'twas a joy to him To solve it wholly; and he seemed as one Refreshed and rested as the work was done. And he had gathered, from all wealth of lore That time has written, such a treasure-store, His mind held opulenceâhis speech the rare Fair grace of sharing all his riches thereâ Sharing with all, but with the greatest zest Sharing with those who seemed the neediest; The young he ever favored; and through these Shall he live longest in men's memories. A GOOD MAN I A good man never diesâ In worthy deed and prayer And helpful hands, and honest eyes, If smiles or tears be there: Who lives for you and meâ Lives for the world he tries To helpâhe lives eternally. A good man never dies. II Who lives to bravely take His share of toil and stress, And, for his weaker fellows' sake, Makes every burden less,â He may, at last, seem wornâ Lie fallenâhands and eyes Foldedâyet, though we mourn and mourn, A good man never dies. JOHN CLARK RIDPATH To the lorn ones who loved him first and best, And knew his dear love at its tenderest, We seem akinâwe simplest friends who knew His fellowship, of heart and spirit too: We who have known the happy summertide Of his ingenuous nature, glorified With the inspiring smile that ever lit The earnest face and kindly strength of it: His presence, all-commanding, as his thought Into unconscious eloquence was wrought Until the utterance became a spell That awed us as a spoken miracle. Learning, to him was nativeâwas, in truth, The earliest playmate of his lisping youth, Likewise throughout a life of toil and stress, It was as laughter, health and happiness: And so he played with itâjoyed at its callâ Ran rioting with it, forgetting all Delights of childhood, and of age and fame,â A devotee of learning, still the same! In fancy, even now we catch the glance Of the rapt eye and radiant countenance, As when his discourse, like a woodland's stream, Flowed musically on from theme to theme: The skies, the stars, the mountains and the sea, He worshiped as their high divinityâ Nor did his reverent spirit find one thing On earth too lowly for his worshiping. The weed, the rose, the wildwood or the plain, The teeming harvest, or the blighted grain,â Allâall were fashioned beautiful and good, As the soul saw and senses understood. Thus broadly based, his spacious faith and love Enfolded all below as all aboveâ Nay, ev'n if overmuch he loved mankind, He gave his love's vast largess as designed. Therefore, in fondest, faithful service, he Wrought ever bravely for humanityâ Stood, first of heroes for the Right alliedâ Foes, even, grieving, when (for them) he died. This was the man we lovedâare loving yet, And still shall love while longing eyes are wet With selfish tears that well were brushed away, Remembering his smile of yesterday.â For, even as we knew him, smiling still, Somewhere beyond all earthly ache or ill, He waits with the old welcomeâjust as when We met him smiling, we shall meet again. HIS HEART OF CONSTANT YOUTH And I never hear the drums beat that I do not think of him. âMajor Charles L. Holstein Turn through his life, each word and deed Now sacred as it isâ How helped and soothed we are to read A history like his! To turn the years, in far review, And find himâas To-dayâ In orchard-lands of bloom and dew Again a boy at play: The jeweled grassâthe sumptuous trees And flower and fragrance there, With song of birds and drone of bees And Spring-time everywhere: Turn any chapter that we will, Read any page, in sooth, We find his glad heart owning still The freshness of his youth. With such a heart of tender care He loved his own, and thus His home was, to the loved ones there, A temple glorious. And, ever youthful, still his love Enshrined, all manifold, The peopleâall the poor thereof, The helpless and the old. And little childrenâAh! to them His love was as the sun Wrought in a magic diadem That crowned them, every one. And ever young his reverence for The laws: like morning-dew He shone as counsel, orator, And clear logician, too. And, as a boy, his gallant soul Made answer to the trill Of battle-trumpet and the roll Of drums that echo still: His comradesâas his country, dearâ They knew, and ever knew That buoyant, boyish love, sincere As truth itself is true: He marched with them, in tireless trampâ Laughed, cheered and lifted up The battle-chorus, and in camp Shared blanket, pipe and cup. His comrades! ... When you meet again, In anguish though you bow, Remember how he loved you then, And how he loves you now. THE PATHS OF PEACE MAURICE THOMPSONâFEBRUARY 15, 1901 He would have holidayâoutworn, in sooth, Would turn again to seek the old release,â The open fieldsâthe loved haunts of his youthâ The woods, the waters, and the paths of peace. The restâthe recreation he would choose Be his abidingly! Long has he served And greatlyâay, and greatly let us use Our grief, and yield him nobly as deserved. Perchanceâwith subtler senses than our own And love exceeding oursâhe listens thus To ever nearer, clearer pipings blown From out the lost lands of Theocritus. Or haply, he is beckoned from us here, By knight or yeoman of the bosky wood, Or, chained in roses, haled a prisoner Before the blithe Immortal, Robin Hood. Or, mayhap, Chaucer signals, and with him And his rare fellows he goes pilgriming; Or Walton signs him, o'er the morning brim Of misty waters midst the dales of Spring. Ho! wheresoe'er he goes, or whosoe'er He fares with, he has bravely earned the boon. Be his the open, and the glory there Of April-buds, May-blooms and flowers of June! Be his the glittering dawn, the twinkling dew, The breathless pool or gush of laughing streamsâ Be his the triumph of the coming true Of all his loveliest dreams! THE TRIBUTE OF HIS HOME BENJAMIN HARRISONâINDIANAPOLIS, MARCH 14, 1901 Bowed, midst a universal grief that makes Columbia's self a stricken mourner, cast In tears beneath the old Flag at half-mast, A sense of glory rouses us and breaks Like song upon our sorrowing and shakes The dew from our drenched eyes, that smile at last In childish prideâas though the great man passed To his most high reward for our poor sakes. Loved of all menâwe muse,âyet ours he wasâ Choice of the Nation's mighty brotherhoodâ Her soldier, statesman, ruler.âAy, but then, We knew himâlong before the world's applause And afterâas a neighbor, kind and good, Our common friend and fellow citizen. AMERICA BUFFALO, NEW YORK, SEPTEMBER 14, 1901 O Thou, AmericaâMessiah of Nations! I In the need that bows us thus, America! Shape a mighty song for usâ America! Song to whelm a hundred years' Roar of wars and rain of tears 'Neath a world's triumphant cheers: America! America! II Lift the trumpet to thy mouth, America! East and West and North and Southâ America! Call us round the dazzling shrine Of the starry old ensignâ New baptized in blood of thine, America! America! III Dying eyes through pitying mists, America! See the Assassin's shackled wrists, America! Patient eyes that turn their sight From all blackening crime and blight Still toward Heaven's holy lightâ America! America! IV High o'erlooking sea and land, America! Trustfully with outheld hand, America! Thou dost welcome all in quest Of thy freedom, peace and restâ Every exile is thy guest, America! America! V Thine a universal love, America! Thine the cross and crown thereof, America! Aid us, then, to sing thy worth: God hath builded, from thy birth, The first nation of the earthâ America! America! EVEN AS A CHILD CANTON, SEPTEMBER 19, 1901 Even as a child to whom sad neighbors speak In symbol, saying that his father âsleepsââ Who feels their meaning, even as his cheek Feels the first tear-drop as it stings and leapsâ Who keenly knows his loss, and yet denies Its awful importâgrieves unreconciled, Moans, drowsesârouses, with new-drowning eyesâ Even as a child. Even as a child; with empty, aimless hand Clasped sudden to the heart all hope desertsâ With tears that blur all lights on sea or landâ The lip that quivers and the throat that hurts: Even so, the Nation that has known his love Is orphaned now; and, whelmed in anguish wild Knows but its sorrow and the ache thereof, Even as a child. THE HOOSIER IN EXILE The Hoosier in Exileâa toast That by its very sound Moves us, at first, to tears almost, And sympathy profound; But musing for a little space, We lift the glass and smile, And poise it with a royal graceâ The Hoosier in Exile! The Hoosier in Exile, forsooth! For though his steps may roam The earth's remotest bounds, in truth His heart is ever home! O loyal still to every tie Of native fields and streams, His boyhood friends, and paths whereby He finds them in his dreams! Though he may fare the thronging maze Of alien city streets, His thoughts are set in grassy ways And woodlands' cool retreats; Forever, clear and sweet above The traffic's roar and din, In breezy groves he hears the dove, And is at peace within. When newer friends and generous hands Advance him, he returns Due gratefulness, yet, pausing, stands As one who strangely yearns To pay still further thanks, but sighs To think he knows not where, Tillâlike as lifeâwith misty eyes He sees his mother there. The Hoosier in Exile? Ah, well, Accept the phrase, but know The Hoosier heart must ever dwell Where orchard blossoms grow The whitest, apples reddest, and, In cornlands, mile on mile, The old homesteads forever standâ âThe Hoosier in Exile!â THE QUEST OF THE FATHERS What were our Forefathers trying to find When they weighed anchor, that desperate hour They turned from home, and the warning wind Sighed in the sails of the old Mayflower? What sought they that could compensate Their hearts for the loved ones left behindâ The household group at the glowing grate?â What were our Forefathers trying to find? What were they trying to find more dear Than their native land and its annals old,â Its throneâits churchâand its worldly cheerâ Its princely state, and its hoarded gold? What more dear than the mounds of green There o'er the brave sires, slumbering long? What more fair than the rural sceneâ What more sweet than the throstle's song? Faces pallid, but sternly set, Lips locked close, as in voiceless prayer, And eyes with never a tear-drop wetâ Even the tenderest woman's there! But O the light from the soul within, As each spake each with a flashing mindâ As the lightning speaks to its kith and kin! What were our Forefathers trying to find? Argonauts of a godless dayâ Seers of visions, and dreamers vain! Their ship's foot set in a pathless way,â The fogs, the mists, and the blinding rain!â When the gleam of sun, and moon and star Seemed lost so long they were half forgotâ When the fixed eyes found nor near nor far, And the night whelmed all, and the world was not. And yet, befriended in some strange wise, They groped their way in the storm and stress Through whichâthough their look found not the skiesâ The Lord's look found them ne'erthelessâ Found them, yea, in their piteous lot, As they in their faith from the first divinedâ Found them, and favored themâtoo. But whatâ What were our Forefathers trying to find? Numb and agasp, with the frost for breath, They came on a frozen shore, at last, As bleak and drear as the coasts of death,â And yet their psalm o'er the wintry blast Rang glad as though 'twere the chiming mirth Of jubilant children landing thereâ Until o'er all of the icy earth The snows seemed warm, as they knelt in prayer. For, lo! they were close on the trail they sought:â In the sacred soil of the rights of men They marked where the Master-hand had wrought; And there they garnered and sowed again.â Their landâthen ours, as to-day it is, With its flag of heaven's own light designed, And God's vast love o'er all. ... And this Is what our Forefathers were trying to find. TO THE MOTHER The mother-hands no further toil may know; The mother-eyes smile not on you and me; The mother-heart is stilled, alas!âBut O The mother-love abides eternally. NEW YEAR'S NURSERY JINGLE Of all the rhymes of all the climes Of where and when and how, We best and most can boost and boast The Golden Age of NOW!

As to our birthdaysâlet 'em run Until they whir and whiz! Read Robert Louis Stevenson, And hum these lines of his:â âThe eternal dawn, beyond a doubt, Shall break on hill and plain And put all stars and candles out Ere we be young again.â THE SOLDIER THE DEDICATION OF THE SOLDIERS' AND SAILORS' MONUMENT, INDIANAPOLIS, MAY 15, 1902 The Soldier!âmeek the title, yet divine: Therefore, with reverence, as with wild acclaim, We fain would honor in exalted line The glorious lineage of the glorious name: The Soldier.âLo, he ever was and is, Our Country's high custodian, by right Of patriot blood that brims that heart of his With fiercest love, yet honor infinite. The Soldierâwithin whose inviolate care The Nation takes repose,âher inmost fane Of Freedom ever has its guardian there, As have her forts and fleets on land and main: The Heavenward Banner, as its ripples stream In happy winds, or float in languid flow, Through silken meshes ever sifts the gleam Of sunshine on its Sentinel below. The Soldier!âWhy, the very utterance Is musicâas of rallying bugles, blent With blur of drums and cymbals and the chants Of battle-hymns that shake the continent!â The thunder-chorus of a world is stirred To awful, universal jubilee,â Yet ever through it, pure and sweet, are heard The prayers of Womanhood, and Infancy. Even as a fateful tempest sudden loosed Upon our senses, so our thoughts are blown Back where The Soldier battled, nor refused A grave all nameless in a clime unknown.â The Soldierâthough, perchance, worn, old and gray; The Soldierâthough, perchance, the merest lad,â The Soldierâthough he gave his life away, Hearing the shout of âVictory,â was glad; Ay, glad and grateful, that in such a cause His veins were drained at Freedom's holy shrineâ Rechristening the landâas first it was,â His blood poured thus in sacramental sign Of new baptism of the hallowed name âMy Countryâânow on every lip once more And blest of God with still enduring fame.â This thought even then The Soldier gloried o'er. The dying eyes upraised in rapture there,â As, haply, he remembered how a breeze Once swept his boyish brow and tossed his hair, Under the fresh bloom of the orchard-treesâ When his heart hurried, in some wistful haste Of ecstasy, and his quick breath was wild And balmy-sharp and chilly-sweet to taste,â And he towered godlike, though a trembling child! Again, through luminous mists, he saw the skies' Far fields white-tented; and in gray and blue And dazzling gold, he saw vast armies rise And fuse in fireâfrom which, in swiftest view, The Old Flag soared, and friend and foe as one Blent in an instant's vivid mirage. ... Then The eyes closed smiling on the smiling sun That changed the seer to a child again.â And, even so, The Soldier slept.âOur own!â The Soldier of our plaudits, flowers and tears,â O this memorial of bronze and stoneâ His love shall outlast this a thousand years! Yet, as the towering symbol bids us do,â With soul saluting, as salutes the hand, We answer as The Soldier answered to The Captain's high command. A CHRISTMAS GLEE FEIGNED AS FROM ELIZABETHAN COMEDY I With a hey! and a hi! and a hey-ho glee! O a Christmas glass for a sweet-lipped lass To kiss and pass, in her coquetryâ So rare!

NO BOY KNOWS There are many things that boys may knowâ Why this and that are thus and so,â Who made the world in the dark and lit The great sun up to lighten it: Boys know new things every dayâ When they study, or when they play,â When they idle, or sow and reapâ But no boy knows when he goes to sleep. Boys who listenâor should, at least,â May know that the round old earth rolls East;â And know that the ice and the snow and the rainâ Ever repeating their parts againâ Are all just water the sunbeams first Sip from the earth in their endless thirst, And pour again till the low streams leap.â But no boy knows when he goes to sleep. A boy may know what a long, glad while It has been to him since the dawn's first smile, When forth he fared in the realm divine Of brook-laced woodland and spun-sunshine;â He may know each call of his truant mates, And the paths they went,âand the pasture-gates Of the 'cross-lots home through the dusk so deep.â But no boy knows when he goes to sleep. O I have followed me, o'er and o'er, From the flagrant drowse on the parlor-floor, To the pleading voice of the mother when I even doubted I heard it thenâ To the sense of a kiss, and a moonlit room, And dewy odors of locust-bloomâ A sweet white cotâand a cricket's cheep.â But no boy knows when he goes to sleep. HIS PA'S ROMANCE All 'at I ever want to be Is ist to be a man like Pa When he wuz young an' married Ma! Uncle he telled us yisterdy Ist all about it thenâ'cause they, My Pa an' Ma, wuz bofe away To 'tend P'tracted Meetin', where My Pa an' Ma is allus there When all the big âRevivalsâ is, An' âLove-Feasts,â too, an' âClass,â an' âPrayer,â An' when's âComoonian Servicis.â An', yes, an' Uncle said to not To never tell them ner let on Like we knowed now ist how they got First married. Soâwhile they wuz goneâ Uncle he telled us ever'thingâ 'Bout how my Pa wuz ist a pore Farm-boy.âHe says, I tell you what, Your Pa wus pore! But neighbers they All liked himâall but one old man An' his old wife that folks all say Nobody liked, ner never can! Yes, sir! an' Uncle purt' nigh swore About the mean old man an' way He treat' my Pa!â'cause he's a pore Farm-handâbut prouder 'an a kingâ An' ist work' on, he did, an' wore His old patched clo'es, ist anyway, So he saved up his wagesâthen He ist worked on an 'saved some more, An' ist worked on, ist night an' dayâ Till, sir, he save' up nine er ten Er hunnerd dollars! But he keep All still about it, Uncle sayâ But he ist thinksâan' thinks a heap! Though what he wuz a-thinkin', Pa He never tell' a soul but Maâ (Then, course, you know, he wuzn't Pa, An', course, you know, she wuzn't Maâ They wuz ist sweethearts, course you know); 'Cause Ma wuz ist a girl, about Sixteen; an' when my Pa he go A-courtin' her, her Pa an' Maâ The very first they find it outâ Wuz maddest folks you ever saw! 'Cause it wuz her old Ma an' Pa 'At hate' my Pa, an' toss their head, An' ist raise Ned! An' her Pa said He'd ruther see his daughter dead! An' said she's ist a child!âan' so Wuz Pa!âAn' ef he wuz man-grown An' only man on earth below, His daughter shouldn't marry him Ef he's a king an' on his throne! Pa's chances then looked mighty slim Fer certain, Uncle said. But heâ He never told a soul but her What he wuz keepin' quiet fer. Her folks ist lived a mile from where He lived atâan' they drove past there To git to town. An' ever' one An' all the neighbers they liked her An' showed it! But her folksâno, sir!â Nobody liked her parunts none! An' so when they shet down, you know, On Paâan' old man tell' him soâ Pa ist went back to work, an' she Ist waited. An', sir! purty soon Her folks they thought he's turned his eye Some other wayâ'cause by-an'-by They heard he'd rented the old place He worked on. An' one afternoon A neighber, that had bust' a trace, He tell' the old man they wuz signs Around the old place that the young Man wuz a-fixin' up the old Log cabin some, an' he had brung New furnichur from town; an' told How th' old house 'uz whitewashed clean An' sweet wiv morning-glory vines An' hollyhawks all 'round the door An' windersâan' a bran'-new floor In th' old porchâan' wite-new green- An'-red pump in the old sweep-well! An', Uncle said, when he hear tell O' all them things, the old man he Ist grin' an' says, he âreckon' now Some gal, er widder anyhow, That silly boy he's coaxed at last To marry him!â he says, says-ee, âAn' ef he has, âso mote it beâ!â Then went back to the house to tell His wife the news, as he went past The smokehouse, an' then went on in The kitchen, where his daughter she Wuz washin', to tell her, an' grin An' try to worry her a spell! The mean old thing! But Uncle said She ain't cry muchâist pull her old Sunbonnet forrerds on her headâ So's old man he can't see her face At all! An' when he s'pose he scold An' jaw enough, he ist clear' out An' think he's boss of all the place! Then Uncle say, the first you know They's go' to be a Circus-show In town; an' old man think he'll take His wife an' go. An' when she say To take their daughter, too, she shake Her head like she don't want to go; An' when he sees she wants to stay, The old man takes her, anyway! An' so she went! But Uncle he Said she looked mighty sweet that day, Though she wuz pale as she could be, A-speshully a-drivin' by Wite where her beau lived at, you know; But out the corner of his eye The old man watch' her; but she throw Her pairsol 'round so she can't see The house at all! An' then she hear Her Pa an' Ma a-talkin' low An' kind o' laughin'-like; but she Ist set there in the seat behind, P'tendin' like she didn't mind. An', Uncle say, when they got past The young man's place, an' 'pearantly He wuzn't home, but off an' gone To town, the old man turned at last An' talked back to his daughter there, All pleasant-like, from then clean on Till they got into town, an' where The Circus wuz, an' on inside O' that, an' through the crowd, on to The very top seat in the tent Wite next the bandâa-bangin' through A tune 'at bu'st his yeers in two! An' there the old man scrouged an' tried To make his wife set down, an' she A-yellin'! But ist what she meant He couldn't hear, ner couldn't see Till she turned 'round an' pinted. Then He turned an' lookedâan' looked again! ... He ist saw neighbers ever'whereâ But, sir, his daughter wuzn't there! An', Uncle says, he even saw Her beau, you know, he hated so; An' he wuz with some other girl. An' then he heard the Clown âHaw-haw!â An' saw the horses wheel an' whirl Around the ring, an' heard the zipp O' the Ringmaster's long slim whipâ But that whole Circus, Uncle said, Wuz all inside the old man's head! An' Uncle said, he didn't find His daughter all that afternoonâ An' her Ma says she'll lose her mind Ef they don't find her purty soon! But, though they looked all day, an' stayed There fer the night p'formanceânot No use at all!âthey never laid Their eyes on her. An' then they got Their team out, an' the old man shook His fist at all the town, an' then Shook it up at the moon ag'in, An' said his time 'ud come, some day! An' jerked the lines an' driv away. Uncle, he said, he s'pect, that night, The old man's madder yet when they Drive past the young man's place, an' hear A fiddle there, an' see a light Inside, an' shadders light an' gay A-dancin' 'crosst the winder-blinds. An' some young chaps outside yelled, âSay! What 'pears to be the hurryâhey?â But the old man ist whipped the lines An' streaked past like a runaway! An' now you'll be su'prised, I bet!â I hardly ain't quit laughin' yet When Uncle say, that jamboree An' dance an' allâw'y, that's a sign That any old man ort to see, As plain as 8 and 1 makes 9, That they's a weddin' wite inside That very house he's whippin' so To git apast!âAn', sir! the bride There's his own daughter! Yes, an' oh! She's my Ma nowâan' young man she Got married, he's my Pa! Whoop-ee! But Uncle say to not laugh all The laughin' yet, but please save some To kind o' spice up what's to come! Then Uncle say, about next day The neighbers they begin to call An' wish 'em well, an' say how glad An' proud an' tickled ever' way Their friends all isâan' how they had The lovin' prayers of ever' one That had homes of their own! But none Said nothin' 'bout the home that she Had run away from! So she sighed Sometimesâan' wunst she purt' nigh cried Well, Uncle say, her old Pa, he Ist like to died, he wuz so mad! An' her Ma, too! But by-an'-by They cool down some. An', 'bout a week, She want to see her Ma so bad, She think she'll haf to go! An' so She coax him; an' he kiss her cheek An' say, Lord bless her, course they'll go! An', Uncle say, when they're bofe come A-knockin' there at her old homeâ W'y, first he know, the door it flew Open, all quick, an' she's jerked in, An', quicker still, the door's banged to An' locked: an' crosst the winder-sill The old man pokes a shotgun through An' says to git! âYou stold my child,â He says; âan', now she's back, w'y, you Clear out, this minute, er I'll kill You! Yes, an' I 'ull kill her, too, Ef you don't go!â An' then, all wild, His young wife begs him please to go! An' so he turn' an' walk'âall slow An' pale as death, but awful still An' ca'mâback to the gate, an' on Into the road, where he had gone So many times alone, you know! An', Uncle say, a whipperwill Holler so lonesome, as he go On back to'rds home, he say he âspecâ He ist 'ud like to wring its neck! An' I ain't think he's goin' back All by hisse'fâbut Uncle say That's what he does, an' it's a fac'! An' 'pears-like he's goin' back to stayâ 'Cause there he stick', ist thataway, An' don't go nowheres any more, Ner don't nobody ever see Him set his foot outside the doorâ Till 'bout five days, a boy loped down The road, a-comin' past from town, An' he called to him from the gate, An' sent the old man word: He's thought Things over now; an', while he hate To lose his wife, he think she ought To mind her Pa an' Ma an' do Whatever they advise her to. An' sends word, too, to come an' git Her new things an' the furnichur That he had special' bought fer herâ 'Cause, now that they wuz goin' to quit, She's free to ist have all of it;â So, fer his love fer her, he say To come an' git it, wite away. An' spang! that very afternoon, Here come her Maâist 'bout as soon As old man could hitch up an' tell Her âhurry back!â An' 'bout as quick As she's drove there to where my Paâ I mean to where her son-in-lawâ Lives at, he meets her at the door All smilin', though he's awful pale An' trimblyâlike he's ist been sick; He take her in the houseâAn', 'fore She knows it, they's a cellar-door Shet on her, an' she hears the click Of a' old rusty padlock! Then, Uncle, he say, she kind o' stands An' thinksâan' thinksâan' thinks ag'inâ An' mayby thinks of her own child Locked upâlike her! An' Uncle smiled, An' I ist laughed an' clapped my hands! An' there she stayed! An' she can cry Ist all she want! an' yell an' kick To ist her heart's content! an' try To pry out wiv a quiltin'-stick! But Uncle say he guess at last She's 'bout give up, an' holler through The door-crack fer to please to be So kind an' good as send an' tell The old man, like she want him to, To come 'fore night, an' set her free, Erâthey wuz rats down there! An' yell She did, till, Uncle say, it soured The morning's milk in the back yard! But all the answer reached her, where She's skeered so in the dark down there, Wuz ist a mutterin' that she heard,â âI've sent him word!âI've sent him word!â An' shore enough, as Uncle say, He has âsent word!â Well, it's plum night An' all the house is shet up tightâ Only one winder 'bout half-way Raised up, you know; an' ain't no light Inside the whole house, Uncle say. Then, first you know, there where the team Stands hitched yet, there the old man standsâ A' old tin lantern in his hands An' monkey-wrench; an' he don't seem To make things out, a-standin' there. He comes on to the gate an' feels An' fumbles fer the latchâthen hears A voice that chills him to the heelsâ âYou halt! an' stand right where you air!â Then, sir! myâmyâhis son-in-law, There at the winder wiv his gun, He tell the old man what he's done: âYou hold my wife a prisonerâ An' your wife, drat ye! I've got her! An' now, sir,â Uncle say he say, âYou ist turn round an' climb wite in That wagon, an' drive home ag'in An' bring my wife back wite away, An' we'll trade thenâan' not before Will I unlock my cellar-doorâ Not fer your wife's sake ner your own, But my wife's sakeâan' hers alone!â An', Uncle say, it don't sound like It's so, but yet it is!âHe say, From wite then, somepin' seem' to strike The old man's funny-bone some way; An', minute more, that team o' his Went tearin' down the road k'whiz! An' in the same two-forty style Come whizzin' back! An' oh, that-air Sweet girl a-cryin' all the while, Thinkin' about her Ma there, shet In her own daughter's cellar, whereâ Ist week or so she's kep' house thereâ She hadn't time to clean it yet! So when her Pa an' her they git Thereâan' the young man grab' an' kiss An' hug her, till she make him quit An' ask him where her mother is. An' then he smile' an' try to not; Then slow-like find th' old padlock key, An' blow a' oat-hull out of it, An' then stoop down there where he's got Her Ma locked up so keerfullyâ An' where, wite there, he say he thought It ort to been the old manâthough Uncle, he say, he reckon notâ When out she bounced, all tickled so To taste fresh air ag'in an' find Her folks wunst more, an' grab' her child An' cry an' laugh, an' even go An' hug the old man; an' he wind Her in his arms, an' laugh, an' pat Her back, an' say he's riconciled, In such a happy scene as that, To swap his daughter for her Ma, An' have so smart a son-in-law As they had! âYes, an' he's my Pa!â I laugh' an' yell', âHooray-hooraw!â TO JOEL CHANDLER HARRIS You who to the rounded prime Of a life of toil and stress, Still have kept the morning-time Of glad youth in heart and spirit, So your laugh, as children hear it, Seems their own, no less,â Take this book of childish rhymeâ The Book of Joyous Children.

Till Elsie, one time she wuz here An' playin' wiv usâDon't you mind, Old Mister Tree?âan' purty near She scolded us the hardest kind Fer quar'llin' 'bout you thataway, An' say she'll findâef we'll keep stillâ Whose tree you air fer shore, she say, An' settle it fer good, she will! So all keep still: An' nen she gone An' pat the Old Tree, an' says she,â âWhose air you, Tree?â an' nen let on Like she's a-list'nin' to the Tree,â An' nen she say, âIt's settled,â'cause The Old Tree says he's all our treeâ His trunk belongs to bofe your Pas, But shade belongs to you an' me.â EVENSONG Lay away the story,â Though the theme is sweet, There's a lack of something yet, Leaves it incomplete:â There's a nameless yearningâ Strangely undefinedâ For a story sweeter still Than the written kind. Therefore read no longerâ I've no heart to hear But just something you make up, O my mother dear.â With your arms around me, Hold me, folded-eyed,â Only let your voice go onâ I'll be satisfied.

THE LITTLE LADY O the Little Lady's dainty As the picture in a book, And her hands are creamy-whiter Than the water-lilies look; Her laugh's the undrown'd music Of the maddest meadow-brook.â Yet all in vain I praise The Little Lady! Her eyes are blue and dewy As the glimmering Summer-dawn,â Her face is like the eglantine Before the dew is gone; And were that honied mouth of hers A bee's to feast upon, He'd be a bee bewildered, Little Lady! Her brow makes light look sallow; And the sunshine, I declare, Is but a yellow jealousy Awakened by her hairâ For O the dazzling glint of it Nor sight nor soul can bear,â So Love goes groping for The Little Lady. And yet she's neither Nymph nor Fay, Nor yet of Angelkind:â She's but a racing schoolgirl, with Her hair blown out behind And tremblingly unbraided by The fingers of the Wind, As it wildly swoops upon The Little Lady. âCOMPANY MANNERSâ When Bess gave her Dollies a tea, said she,â âIt's unpolite, when they's Company, To say you've drinked two cups, you see,â But say you've drinked a couple of tea.â THE GOOD, OLD-FASHIONED PEOPLE When we hear Uncle Sidney tell About the long-ago An' old, old friends he loved so well When he was youngâMy-oh!â Us childern all wish we'd âaâ bin A-livin' then with Uncle,âso We could a-kind o' happened in On them old friends he used to know!â The good, old-fashioned peopleâ The hale, hard-working peopleâ The kindly country people 'At Uncle used to know! They was God's people, Uncle says, An' gloried in His name, An' worked, without no selfishness, An' loved their neighbers same As they was kin: An' when they biled Their tree-molasses, in the Spring, Er butchered in the Fall, they smiled An' sheered with all jist ever'thing!â The good, old-fashioned peopleâ The hale, hard-working peopleâ The kindly country people 'At Uncle used to know! He tells about 'em, lots o' times, Till we'd all ruther hear About 'em than the Nurs'ry Rhymes Er Fairiesâmighty near!â Only, sometimes, he stops so long An' then talks on so low an' slow, It's purt' nigh sad as any song To listen to him talkin' so Of the good, old-fashioned people The hale, hard-working peopleâ The kindly country people 'At Uncle used to know! THE BEST TIMES When Old Folks they wuz young like us An' little as you an' me,â Them wuz the best times ever wuz Er ever goin' ter be! âHIK-TEE-DIKâ THE WAR-CRY OF BILLY AND BUDDY When two little boysârenowned but for noiseâ Hik-tee-dik! Billy and Buddy!â May hurt a whole school, and the head it employs, Hik-tee-dik! Billy and Buddy! Such loud and hilarious pupils indeed Need learningâand yet something further they need, Though fond hearts that love them may sorrow and bleed. Hik-tee-dik! Billy and Buddy! O the schoolmarm was cool, and in nowise a fool; Hik-tee-dik! Billy and Buddy! And in ruling her ranks it was her rule to rule; Hik-tee-dik! Billy and Buddy! So when these two pupils conspired, every day, Some mad piece of mischief, with whoop and hoo-ray, That hurt yet defied her,âhow happy were they!â Hik-tee-dik! Billy and Buddy! At the ring of the bell they'd rush in with a yellâ Hik-tee-dik! Billy and Buddy! And they'd bang the school-door till the plastering fell, Hik-tee-dik! Billy and Buddy! They'd clinch as they came, and pretend not to see As they knocked her desk overâthen, My! and O-me! How awfully sorry they'd both seem to be! Hik-tee-dik! Billy and Buddy! This trick seemed so neat and so safe a conceit,â Hik-tee-dik! Billy and Buddy!â They played it three timesâthough the third they were beat; Hik-tee-dik! Billy and Buddy! For the teacher, she righted her deskâraised the lid And folded and packed away each little kidâ Closed the incident soâyes, and locked it, she didâ Hik-tee-dik! Billy and Buddy! âOLD BOB WHITEâ Old Bob White's a funny bird!â Funniest you ever heard!â Hear him whistle,ââOldâBobâWhite!â You can hear him, clean from where He's 'way 'crosst the wheat-field there, Whistlin' like he didn't careâ âOldâBobâWhite!â Whistles alluz ist the sameâ So's we son't fergit his name!â Hear him say it?ââOldâBobâWhite!â There! he's whizzed off down the laneâ Gone back where his folks is stayin'â Hear him?âThere he goes again,â âOldâBobâWhite!â A SESSION WITH UNCLE SIDNEY [1869] I ONE OF HIS ANIMAL STORIES Now, Tudens, you sit on this kneeâand 'scuse It having no side-saddle on;âand, Jeems, You sit on thisâand don't you wobble so And chug my old shins with your coppertoes;â And, all the rest of you, range round someway,â Ride on the rockers and hang to the arms Of our old-time split-bottom carryall!â Do anything but squabble for a place, Or push or shove or scrouge, or breathe out loud, Or chew wet, or knead taffy in my beard!â Do anything almostâact anyway,â Only keep still, so I can hear myself Trying to tell you âjust one story more!â One winter afternoon my father, with A whistle to our dog, a shout to usâ His two boysâsix and eight years old we were,â Started off to the woods, a half a mile From home, where he was chopping wood. We raced, We slipped and slid; reaching, at last, the north Side of Tharp's corn-field.âThere we struck what seemed To be a coon-trackâso we all agreed: And father, who was not a hunter, to Our glad surprise, proposed we follow it. The snow was quite five inches deep; and we, Keen on the trail, were soon far in the woods. Our old dog, âRing,â ran nosing the fresh track With whimpering delight, far on ahead. After following the trail more than a mile To northward, through the thickest winter woods We boys had ever seen,âall suddenly He seemed to strike another trail; and then Our joyful attention was drawn to Old âRingââleaping to this side, then to that, Of a big, hollow, old oak tree, which had Been blown down by a storm some years before. Thereâall at onceâout leapt a lean old fox From the black hollow of a big bent limb,â Hey! how he scudded!âbut with our old âRingâ Sharp after himâand father after âRingââ We after father, near as we could hold. And father noticed that the fox kept just About four feet ahead of âRingââjust thatâ No farther, and no nearer! Then he said:â âThere are young foxes in that tree back there, And the mother-fox is drawing âRingâ and us Away from their nest there!â âOh, le' 's go back!â Do le' 's go back!â we little vandals cried,â âLe' 's go back, quick, and find the little thingsâ Please, father!âYes, and take 'em home for petsâ 'Cause âRingâ he'll kill the old fox anyway!â So father turned, at last, and back we went. And then he chopped a hole in the old tree About ten feet along the limb from which The old fox ran: andâBless their little lives!â There, in the hollow of the old tree-trunkâ There, on a bed of warm dry leaves and mossâ There, snug as any bug in any rugâ We foundâoneâtwoâthreeâfour, and, yes-sir, five Wee, weenty-teenty baby-foxes, with Their eyes just barely opened.âCute?âmy-oh!â The cutestâthe most cunning little things Two boys ever saw, in all their lives!â âRaw weather for the little fellows now!â Said father, as though talking to himself,â âRaw weather, and no home now!ââAnd off came His warm old âwaumusâ; and in that he wrapped The helpless little fellows then, and held Them soft and warm against him as he could,â And home we happy children followed him.â Old âRingâ did not reach home till nearly dusk: The mother-fox had led him a long chaseâ âYes, and a fool's chase, too!â he seemed to say, And looked ashamed to hear us praising him But, motherâwell, we could not understand Her acting as she didâand we so pleased! I can see yet the look of pained surprise And deep compassion of her troubled face When father very gently laid his coat, With the young foxes in it, on the hearth Beside her, as she brightened up the fire. She urgedâfor the old fox's sake and theirsâ That they be taken back to the old tree; But fatherâfor our wistful sakes, no doubtâ Said we would keep them, and would try our best To raise them. And at once he set about Building a snug home for the little things Out of an old big bushel-basket, with Its fractured handle and its stoven ribs: So, lining and padding this all cozily, He snuggled in its little tenants, and Called in John Wesley Thomas, our hired man, And gave him in full charge, with much advice Regarding the just care and sustenance of Young foxes.ââJohn,â he said, âyou feed 'em milkâ Warm milk, John Wesley! Yes, and keep 'em by The stoveâand keep your stove a-roarin', too, Both night and day!âAnd keep 'em covered upâ Not smothered, John, but snug and comfortableâ And now, John Wesley Thomas, first and last,â You feed 'em milkâfresh milkâand always warmâ Say five or six or seven times a dayâ Of course we'll grade that by the way they thrive.â But, for all sanguine hope, and care, as well, The little fellows did not thrive at all.â Indeed, with all our care and vigilance, By the third day of their captivity The last survivor of the fated five Squeaked, like some battered little rubber-toy, Jist clean wore out.âAnd that's jist what 'e wuz! Andânights,âthe cry of the mother-fox for her young Was heard, with awe, for long weeks afterward. And we boys, every night, would go to the door And, peering out in the darkness, listening, Could hear the poor fox in the black bleak woods Still calling for her little ones in vain. As, all mutely, we returned to the warm fireside, Mother would say: âHow would you like for me To be out there, this dark night, in the cold woods, Calling for my children?â II UNCLE BRIGHTENS UPâ Uncle he says 'at 'way down in the sea Ever'thing's ist like it used to be:â He says they's mermaids an' mermans, too, An' little merchildern, like me an' youâ Little merboys, with tops an' balls, An' little mergirls, with little merdolls.

I like to watch him when he's lit In top of any tree, 'Cause all birds git wite out of it When he 'lights, an' they see How proud he act,' an' swell an' spread His chest out more an' more, An' raise the feathers on his head Like it's cut pompadore!

SOME SONGS AFTER MASTER-SINGERS I SONG [W.S.] With a hey! and a hi! and a hey-ho rhyme! O the shepherd lad He is ne'er so glad As when he pipes, in the blossom-time, So rare! While Kate picks by, yet looks not there. So rare! so rare! With a hey! and a hi! and a ho! The grasses curdle where the daisies blow! With a hey! and a hi! and a hey-ho vow! Then he sips her face At the sweetest placeâ And ho! how white is the hawthorn now!â So rare!â And the daisied world rocks round them there So rare! so rare! With a hey! and a hi! and a ho! The grasses curdle where the daisies blow! II TO THE CHILD JULIA [R. H.] Little Julia, since that we May not as our elders be, Let us blithely fill the days Of our youth with pleasant plays. First we'll up at earliest dawn, While as yet the dew is on The sooth'd grasses and the pied Blossomings of morningtide; Next, with rinsÃ¨d cheeks that shine As the enamel'd eglantine, We will break our fast on bread With both cream and honey spread; Then, with many a challenge-call, We will romp from house and hall, Gipsying with the birds and bees Of the green-tress'd garden trees. In a bower of leaf and vine Thou shalt be a lady fine Held in duress by the great Giant I shall personate. Next, when many mimics more Like to these we have played o'er, We'll betake us home-along Hand in hand at evensong. III THE DOLLY'S MOTHER [W. W.] A little maid, of summers fourâ Did you compute her years,â And yet how infinitely more To me her age appears: I mark the sweet child's serious air, At her unplayful play,â The tiny doll she mothers there And lulls to sleep away, Growsâ'neath the grave similitudeâ An infant real, to me, And she a saint of motherhood In hale maturity. So, pausing in my lonely round, And all unseen of her, I stand uncoveredâher profound And abject worshiper. IV WIND OF THE SEA [A. T.] Wind of the Sea, come fill my sailâ Lend me the breath of a freshening gale And bear my port-worn ship away! For O the greed of the tedious townâ The shutters up and the shutters down! Wind of the Sea, sweep over the bay And bear me away!âaway! Whither you bear me, Wind of the Sea, Matters never the least to me: Give me your fogs, with the sails adrip, Or the weltering path thro' the starless nightâ On, somewhere, is a new daylight And the cheery glint of another ship As its colors dip and dip! Wind of the Sea, sweep over the bay And bear me away!âaway! V SUBTLETY [R. B.] Whilst little Paul, convalescing, was staying Close indoors, and his boisterous classmates paying Him visits, with fresh school-notes and surprises,â With nettling pride they sprung the word âAthletic,â With much advice and urgings sympathetic Anent âathletic exercises.â Wise as Lad might look, quoth Paul: âI've pondered o'er that âAthletic,â but I mean to take, before that, Downstairic and outdooric exercises.â VI BORN TO THE PURPLE [W. M.] Most-like it was this kingly lad Spake out of the pure joy he had In his child-heart of the wee maid Whose eery beauty sudden laid A spell upon him, and his words Burst as a song of any bird's:â A peerless Princess thou shalt be, Through wit of love's rare sorcery: To crown the crown of thy gold hair Thou shalt have rubies, bleeding there Their crimson splendor midst the marred Pulp of great pearls, and afterward Leaking in fainter ruddy stains Adown thy neck-and-armlet-chains Of turquoise, chrysoprase, and mad Light-frenzied diamonds, dartling glad Swift spirts of shine that interfuse As though with lucent crystal dews That glance and glitter like split rays Of sunshine, born of burgeoning Mays When the first bee tilts down the lip Of the first blossom, and the drip Of blended dew and honey heaves Him blinded midst the underleaves. For raiment, Fays shall weave for theeâ Out of the phosphor of the sea And the frayed floss of starlight, spun With counterwarp of the firm sunâ A vesture of such filmy sheen As, through all ages, never queen Therewith strove truly to make less One fair line of her loveliness. Thus gowned and crowned with gems and gold, Thou shalt, through centuries untold, Rule, ever young and ever fair, As now thou rulest, smiling there. CLIMATIC SORCERY When frost's all on our winder, an' the snow's All out-o'-doors, our âOld-Krissâ-milkman goes A-drivin' round, ist purt' nigh froze to death, With his old white mustache froze full o' breath. But when it's summer an' all warm ag'in, He comes a-whistlin' an' a-drivin' in Our alley, 'thout no coat on, ner ain't cold, Ner his mustache ain't white, ner he ain't old. THE TREASURE OF THE WISE MAN O the night was dark and the night was late, And the robbers came to rob him; And they picked the locks of his palace-gate, The robbers that came to rob himâ They picked the locks of his palace-gate, Seized his jewels and gems of state, His coffers of gold and his priceless plate,â The robbers that came to rob him. But loud laughed he in the morning red!â For of what had the robbers robbed him?â Ho! hidden safe, as he slept in bed, When the robbers came to rob him,â They robbed him not of a golden shred Of the childish dreams in his wise old headâ âAnd they're welcome to all things else,â he said, When the robbers came to rob him. OLD GRANNY DUSK Old Granny Dusk, when the sun goes down, Here she comes into thish-yer town! Out o' the wet black woods an' swamps In she traipses an' trails an' trompsâ With her old sunbonnet all floppy an' brown, An' her cluckety shoes, an' her old black gown, Here she comes into thish-yer town! Old Granny Dusk, when the bats begin To flap around, comes a-trompin' in! An' the katydids they rasp an' whir, An' the lightnin'-bugs all blink at her; An' the old Hop-toad turns in his thumbs, An' the bunglin' June-bug booms an' bums, An' the Bullfrog croaks, âO here she comes!â Old Granny Dusk, though I'm 'feard o' you, Shore-fer-certain I'm sorry, too: 'Cause you look as lonesome an' starved an' sad As a mother 'at's lost ever' child she had.â Yet never a child in thish-yer town Clings at yer hand er yer old black gown, Er kisses the face you're a-bendin' down. FIRE AT NIGHT Fire! Fire! Ring! and ring! Hear the old bell bang and ding! Fire! Fire!

Ain't you 'wake at last!â Hear them horses poundin' pastâ Hear that ladder-wagon grind Round the corner!âand, behind, Hear the hose-cart, turnin' short, And the horses slip and snort, As the engine's clank-and-jar Jolts the whole street, near and far. Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Can't you h'ist that winder higher? La! they've all got past like âscat!â... Night's as black as my old hatâ And it's rainin', too, at that!...

Mamma sits and sews at the window, and Iâ I'm out at the gate when an old man goes byâ Such a lovely old man,âthough I can't tell you why, Unless it's his greeting,ââGood morning! Good morning! good morning!â the old man will say,â âFine bracing weather we're having to-day!â And how's little brotherâ And sisterâand mother?â So dear to each other!â Good morning!â The old man goes by, in his glossy high-hat, And stripe-trousers creased, and all turned-up, at that, And his glancing nose-glassesâand pleasantest eyes, As he smiles on me, always in newer surprise: And though his mustache is as white as the snow, He wears it waxed out and all pointed, you know, And gloves, and high collar and bright, jaunty bow, And stylish umbrella.ââGood morning! Good morning! good morning!â the old man will say,â âFine falling weather we're promised to-day!â And how's little brotherâ And sisterâand mother?â So fond of each other!â Good morning!â It's Christmas!âit's Christmas! and oh, but we're gay!

TWILIGHT STORIES Neither daylight, starlight, moonlight, But a sad-sweet term of some light By the saintly name of Twilight. The Grandma Twilight Stories!âStill, A childish listener, I hear The katydid and whippoorwill, In deepening atmosphere Of velvet dusk, blent with the low Soft music of the voice that sings And tells me tales of long ago And old enchanted things. ... While far fails the last dim daylight, And the fireflies in the Twilight Drift about like flakes of starlight. âGO READ YOUR BOOK!â How many times that grim old phrase Has silenced me, in childish days!â And nowâas then it didâ The phantom admonition, clear And dominant, rings,âand I hear, And do as I am bid. âGo read your book!â my good old sire Commanded, in affected ire, When I, with querying look And speech, dared vex his studious mind With idle words of any kind.â And so I read my book. Though seldom, in that wisest age, Did I discern on Wisdom's page More than the task: That led At least to thinking, and at last To reading less, and not so fast, And longing as I read. And, lo! in gracious time, I grew To love a book all through and through!â With yearning eyes I look On any volume,âold, maybe, Or newâ'tis meat and drink to me.â And so I read my book. Old dog's-eared Readers, scarred and inked With schoolboy hatred, long extinct;â Old Histories that bored Me worst of all the school;âold, worn Arithmetics, frayed, ripped, and tornâ Now Ye are all adored. And likewise I revere and praise My sire, as now, with vainest gaze And hearing, still I look For the old face so grave yet dearâ Nay, still I see, and still I hear! And so I read my book. Next even to my nearest kin,â My wifeâmy children romping in From school to ride my knee,â I love a book, and dispossess My lap of it with loathfulness, For all their love of me. For, grave or gay the book, it takes Me as an equalâcalms, or makes Me, laughing, overlook My little selfâforgetful all Of being so exceeding small. And so I read my book. WHEN UNCLE DOC WAS YOUNG Though Doctor Glenâthe best of menâ Is wrinkled, old, and gray, He'll always smile and stop a while Where little children play: And often then he tells us, when He was a youngster, too, He was as glad and bad a lad As old folks ever knew! As he walks down, no boy in town But sees him half a block, And stops to shout a welcome out With âHere comes Uncle Doc!â Then all the rest, they look their best As he lines up among Us boys of tenâeach thinking then When Uncle Doc was young. We run to him!âThough grave and grim, With voice pitched high and thin, He still reveals the joy he feels In all that he has been: With heart too true, and honest, too, To ever hide a truth, He frankly owns, in laughing tones, He was âa sorry youth!ââ When he was young, he says, he sung And howled his level-best; He says he guyed, and sneaked, and lied, And wrecked the robin's nest.â All this, and worse, will he rehearse, Then smooth his snowy locks And look the saint he says he ain't. ... Them eyes of Uncle Doc's! He says, when heâlike you and meâ Was just too low and mean To slap asleep, he used to weep To find his face was clean: His hair, he said, was just too red To tell with mortal tongueâ âThe Burning Shameâ was his nickname When Uncle Doc was young. THE LISPER Elsie mingus lisps, she does! She lives wite acrosst from us In Miz. Ayers'uz house 'at she Rents part to the Mingusuz.â Yes, an' Elsie plays wiv me.

HER LONESOMENESS When little Elizabeth whispers Her morning-love to me, Each word of the little lisper's, As she clambers on my kneeâ Hugs me and whispers, âMommy, Oh, I'm so glad it's day And the night's all gone away!â How it does thrill and awe me,â âThe night's all gone away!â âSometimes I wake, all listenin',â She sighs, âand all's so still!â The moon and the stars half-glistenin' Over the window-sill:â And I look where the gas's pale light Is all turned down in the hallâ And you ain't here at all!â And oh, how I wish it was daylight! âAnd you ain't here at all! âAnd oh,â she goes eerily whining And laughing, too, as she speaks, âIf only the sun kept shining For weeks and weeks and weeks!â For the world's so dark, without you, And the moon's turned down so lowâ 'Way in the night, you know,â And I get so lonesome about you!â 'Way in the night, you know!â ALMOST BEYOND ENDURANCE I ain't a-goin' to cry no more, no more!

The old days of Morning, With the dew-drench on the flowers And apple-buds and blossoms Of those old days of ours. Then was the real gold Spendthrift Summer flung; Then was the real song Bird or Poet sung! There was never censure then,â Only honest praiseâ And all thing were worthy of it In the old days. There bide the true friendsâ The first and the best; There clings the green grass Close where they rest: Would they were here? No;â Would we were there! ... The old daysâthe lost daysâ How lovely they were! TO A POET ON HIS MARRIAGE MADISON CAWEIN Ever and ever, on and on, From winter dusk, to April dawn, This old enchanted world we range From night to lightâfrom change to changeâ Or path of burs or lily-bells, We walk a world of miracles. The morning evermore must be A newer, purer mysteryâ The dewy grasses, or the bloom Of orchards, or the wood's perfume Of wild sweet-williams, or the wet Blent scent of loam and violet. How wondrous all the ways we fareâ What marvels wait us, unaware! ... But yesterday, with eyes ablur And heart that held no hope of Her, You paced the lone path, but the true That led to where she waited you. LOCKERBIE FAIR O the Lockerbie Fair!âHave you heard of its fame And its fabulous riches, too rare for a name!â The gold of the noon of the June-time refined To the Orient-Night, till the eyes and the mind Are dazed with the sights, in the earth and the air, Of the opulent splendors of Lockerbie Fair. What more fortunate fate might to mortal befall, Midst the midsummer beauty and bloom of it all, Than to glit with the moon o'er the rapturous scene And twink with the stars as they laughingly lean O'er the luminous revel and glamour and glare Fused in one dazzling glory at Lockerbie Fair. The Night, like a queen in her purple and lace, With her diamonded brow, and imperious grace, As she leads her fair votaries, train upon train, A-dance thro' the feasts of this mystic domain To the mandolin's twang, and the warble and blare Of voice, flute and bugle at Lockerbie Fair. All strange, ever-changing, enchanted delights Found now in this newer Arabian Nights,â Where each lovely maid is a Princess, and each Lucky swain an Aladdinâall treasures in reach Of the âlampsâ and the âringsââand with Genii to spare, Simply waiting your orders, at Lockerbie Fair. THE OLD MAN OF THE SEA I'm The Old Man of the SeaâI am!â And this is my secret pride, That I have a hundred shapes, all sham, And a hundred names beside: They have named me âHabit,â and âWay,â forsooth âCapricious,â and âFancy-freeâ;â But to you, O Youth, I confess the truth,â I'm The Old Man of the Sea.

I'm The Old Man of the Sea, yo-ho! So lift up a song with me, As I sit on the throne of your shoulders, alone, I'm The Old Man of the Sea. Tricked in the guise of your best intent, I am your failuresâallâ I am the victories you invent, And your high resolves that fall: I am the vow you are breaking now As the wassail-bowl swings free And the red guilt flushes your cheek and browâ I'm The Old Man of the Sea. I'm The Old Man of the Sea, yo-ho! So lift up a song with me, As I sit on the throne of your shoulders, alone, I'm The Old Man of the Sea. I am your false dreams of success And your mythical future fameâ Your lifelong lies, and your soul's distress And your slowly-dying shame: I'm the chattering half of your latest laugh, And your tongue's last perfidyâ Your doom, your tomb, and your epitaph ... I'm The Old Man of the Sea. I'm The Old Man of the Sea, yo-ho! So lift up a song with me, As I sit on the throne of your shoulders, alone, I'm The Old Man of the Sea. PROSE OR VERSE?

IT'S GOT TO BE âWhen it's got to be,ââlike I always say, As I notice the years whiz past, And know each day is a yesterday, When we size it up, at last,â Same as I said when my boyhood went And I knowed we had to quit,â âIt's got to be, and it's goin' to be!ââ So I said âGood-byâ to it. It's got to be, and it's goin' to be! So at least I always try To kind o' say in a hearty way,â âWell, it's got to be. Good-by!â The time just melts like a late, last snow,â When it's got to be, it melts! But I aim to keep a cheerful mind, Ef I can't keep nothin' else! I knowed, when I come to twenty-one, That I'd soon be twenty-two,â So I waved one hand at the soft young man, And I said, âGood-by to you!â It's got to be, and it's goin' to be! So at least I always try To kind o' say, in a cheerful way,â âWell, it's got to be.âGood-by!â They kep' a-goin', the years and years, Yet still I smiled and smiled,â For I'd said âGood-byâ to my single life, And now had a wife and child: Mother and son and the fatherâone,â Till, last, on her bed of pain, She jes' smiled up, like she always done,â And I said âGood-byâ again. It's got to be, and it's goin' to be! So at least I always try To kind o' say, in a humble way,â âWell, it's got to be. Good-by!â And then my boyâas he growed to be Almost a man in size,â Was more than a pride and joy to me, With his mother's smilin' eyes.â He gimme the slip, when the War broke out, And followed me. And I Never knowed till the first fight's end ... I found him, and then ... âGood-by.â It's got to be, and it's goin' to be! So at least I always try To kind o' say, in a patient way, âWell, it's got to be. Good-by!â I have said, âGood-by!âGood-by!âGood-by!â With my very best good will, All through life from the first,âand I Am a cheerful old man still: But it's got to end, and it's goin' to end! And this is the thing I'll do,â With my last breath I will laugh, O Death, And say âGood-byâ to you! ... It's got to be!

Nay, nay, not even these most stably real Of children are more loved than our idealâ More tangible to the soul's touch and sight Than theseâour children by Divine birthright. ...

Nen Uncle gits the flat-arn out, An', while he's tellin' us all 'bout Old Chris'mus-times when he's a kid, He ist cracked hickernuts, he did, Till they's a crockful, mighty nigh! An' when they're all done by an' by, He raked the red coals out again An' telled me, âFetch that popcorn in, An' old three-leggud skillutâan' The led an' all now, little man,â An' yer old Uncle here 'ull show You how corn's popped, long years ago When me an' Santy Claus wuz boys On Pap's old place in Illinoise!â An' your Pa, too, wuz chums, all through, With Santy!âWisht Pa'd be here, too!â Nen Uncle sigh at Ma, an' she Pat him again, an' say to me An' Etty,ââYou take warning fair!â Don't talk too much, like Uncle there, Ner don't fergit, like him, my dears, That âlittle pitchers has big ears!ââ But Uncle say to her, âClear out!â Yer brother knows what he's about.â You git your Chris'mus-cookin' done Er these pore childern won't have none!â Nen Trip wake' up an' raise', an' nen Turn roun' an' nen lay down again.

But Widder Shelton's little Saul Beats all I know about! He's weakly-likeâin p'int o' health, But strong in word and deed And heart and head, and snap and spunk, And allus in the lead! Comes honest by it, fer his Paâ Afore he passed awayâ He was a leaderâ(Lord, I'd like To hear him preach to-day!) He led his flock; he led in prayer Fer spread o' Peaceâand when Nothin' but War could spread it, he Was first to lead us then! So little Saul has grit to take Things jes' as they occur; And Sister Shelton's proud o' him As he is proud o' her! And when she âgot upââjes' fer him And little playmates allâ A Chris'mus-treeâthey ever'one Was there but little Saul. Pore little chap was sick in bed Next room; and Doc was there, And said the childern might file past, But go right back to where The tree was, in the settin'-room. And Saul jes' laid and smiledâ Ner couldn't nod, ner wave his hand, It hurt soâBless the child! And so they left him there with Docâ And warm tear of his Ma's ... Thenâsudden-likeâhigh over all Their laughture and applauseâ They heerd: âI don't care what you git On yer old Chris'mus-tree, 'Cause I'm got somepin' you all hain'tâ I'm got the pleurisy!â GENERAL LEW WALLACE FEBRUARY 15, 1905 Nay, Death, thou mightiest of all Dread conquerorsâthou dreadest chief,â Thy heavy hand can here but fall Light as the Autumn leaf: As vainly, too, its weight is laid Upon the warrior's knightly sword;â Still through the charge and cannonade It flashes for the Lord. In forumâas in battle-fieldâ His voice rang for the truthâthe rightâ Keyed with the shibboleth that pealed His Soul forth to the fight: The inspiration of his pen Glowed as a star, and lit anew The faces and the hearts of men Watching, the long night through. A destiny ordainedâdivine It seemed to hosts of those who saw His rise since youth and marked the line Of his ascent with awe:â From the now-storied little town That gave him birth and worth, behold, Unto this day of his renown, His sword and word of gold. Serving the Land he loved so wellâ Hailed midsea or in foreign port, Or in strange-bannered citadel Or Oriental Court,â Heâhonored for his Nation's sake, And loved and honored for his ownâ Hath seen his Flag in glory shake Above the Pagan Throne. ON READING DR. HENRY VAN DYKE'S VOLUME OF POEMSâMUSIC Music!âYea, and the airs you playâ Out of the faintest Far-Away And the sweetest, too; and the dearest Here, With its quavering voice but its bravest cheerâ The prayer that aches to be all expressedâ The kiss of love at its tenderest: Musicâmusic, with glad heart-throbs Within it; and music with tears and sobs Shaking it, as the startled soul Is shaken at shriek of the fife and roll Of the drums;âthen as suddenly lulled again With the whisper and lisp of the summer rain: Mist of melodies fragrance-fineâ The bird-song flicked from the eglantine With the dews when the springing bramble throws A rarer drench on its ripest rose, And the wingÃ¨d song soars up and sinks To the dove's dim coo by the river-brinks Where the ripple's voice still laughs along Its glittering path of light and song. Music, O Poet, and all your own By right of capture and that alone,â For in it we hear the harmony Born of the earth and the air and the sea, And over and under it, and all through, We catch the chime of The Anthem, too. HER SMILE OF CHEER AND VOICE OF SONG ANNA HARRIS RANDALL Spring fails, in all its bravery of brilliant gold and green,â The sun, the grass, the leafing tree, and all the dazzling scene Of dewy morningâorchard blooms, And woodland blossoms and perfumes With bird-songs sown between. Yea, since she smiles not any more, so every flowery thing Fades, and the birds seem brooding o'er her silence as they singâ Her smile of cheer and voice of song Seemed so divinely to belong To ever-joyous Spring! Nay, still she smiles.âOur eyes are blurred and see not through our tears: And still her rapturous voice is heard, though not of mortal ears:â Now ever doth she smile and sing Where Heaven's unending Clime of Spring Reclaims those gifts of hers. THINKIN' BACK I've be'n thinkin' back, of late, S'prisin'!âAnd I'm here to state I'm suspicious it's a sign Of age, maybe, er decline Of my faculties,âand yit I'm not feelin' old a bitâ Any more than sixty-four Ain't no young man any more! Thinkin' back's a thing 'at grows On a feller, I supposeâ Older 'at he gits, i jack, More he keeps a-thinkin' back! Old as old men git to be, Er as middle-aged as me, Folks'll find us, eye and mind Fixed on what we've left behindâ Rehabilitatin'-like Them old times we used to hike Out barefooted fer the crick, 'Long 'bout Aprile firstâto pick Out some âwarmestâ place to go In a-swimmin'âOoh! my-oh! Wonder now we hadn't died! Grate horseradish on my hide Jes' a-thinkin' how cold then That-'ere worter must 'a' be'n! Thinkin' backâW'y, goodness me! I kin call their names and see Every little tad I played With, er fought, er was afraid Of, and so made him the best Friend I had of all the rest! Thinkin' back, I even hear Them a-callin', high and clear, Up the crick-banks, where they seem Still hid in thereâlike a dreamâ And me still a-pantin' on The green pathway they have gone! Still they hide, by bend er fordâ Still they hideâbut, thank the Lord (Thinkin' back, as I have said), I hear laughin' on ahead! SIS RAPALYE When rainy-greener shoots the grass And blooms the cherry tree, And children laugh by glittering brooks, Wild with the ecstasy Of bursting Spring, with twittering bird And hum of honey-bee,â âSis Rapalye!â my spirit shouts ... And she is here with me! As laugh the children, so her laugh Haunts all the atmosphere;â Her song is in the brook's refrain; Her glad eyes, flashing clear, Are in the morning dews; her speech Is melody so dear, The bluebird trills,ââSis Rapalye!â I hear!âI hear!âI hear!â Again in races, at âRecess,â I see her braided hair Toss past me as I stay to lift Her straw hat, fallen there; The school-bell sends a vibrant pang My heart can hardly bear.â Yet still she leadsâSis Rapalyeâ And leads me everywhere! Now I am old.âYet she remains The selfsame child of ten.â Gay, gallant little girl, to race On into Heaven then! Yet gallant, gay Sis Rapalyeâ In blossom-time, and when The trees and grasses beckon herâ Comes back to us again. And so, however long since youth Whose raptures wild and free An old man's heart may claim no more,â With more than memory I share the Spring's own joy that brings My boyhood back to me With laughter, blossoms, singing birds And sweet Sis Rapalye. TO BLISS CARMAN He is the morning's poetâ The bard of mount and moor, The minstrel fine of dewy shine, The dawning's troubadour: The brother of the bluebird, 'Mid blossoms, throng on throng, Whose singing calls, o'er orchard walls, Seem glitterings of song. He meets, with brow uncovered, The sunrise through the mist, With raptured eyes that range the skies And seas of amethyst: The brambled rose clings to him; The breezy wood receives Him as the guest she loves the best And laughs through all her leaves: Pan and his nymphs and dryads They hear, in breathless pause, This earth-born wight lilt his delight, And envy him because. ... He is the morning's poetâ The bard of mount and moor, The minstrel fine of dewy shine, The dawning's troubadour. A SONG O' CHEER My Grampa he's a-allus sayin', âSing a song o' cheer!ââ And wunst I says âWhat kind is them?â He says,ââThe kind to hear.â 'Cause they're the songs that Nature sings, In ever' bird that twitters!â âWell, whipperwills and doves,â says I, âHain't over-cheery critters!â âThen don't you sing like them,â he saysâ âNer guinny-hens, my dearâ Ner peafowls nuther (drat the boy!) You sing a song o' cheer!â I can't sing nothin' anyhow; But, comin' home, to'rds night, I kind o' sort o' kep' a-whistlin' âOldâBobâWhite!â CHILD'S CHRISTMAS CAROL Christ used to be like you and me, When just a lad in Galilee,â So when we pray, on Christmas Day, He favors first the prayers we say: Then waste no tear, but pray with cheer, This gladdest day of all the year: O Brother mine of birth Divine, Upon this natal day of Thine Bear with our stress of happiness Nor count our reverence the less Because with glee and jubilee Our hearts go singing up to Thee. I' GOT TO FACE MOTHER TO-DAY! I' got to face Mother to-day, fer a fact!â I' got to face Mother to-day! And jes' how I'll dare to, an' how she will act, Is more than a mortal can say! But I' got to face herâI' got to! And so Here's a' old father clean at the end of his row! And Pink and Wade's gone to the farm fer her nowâ And I'm keepin' house fer 'em hereâ Their purty, new houseâand all paid fer!âBut how Am I goin' to meet her, and clear Uy my actchully he'ppin' 'em both to elope?â ('Cause Mother wuz setâand wuz no other hope!) I don't think it's Wade she's so biased ag'in', But his bizness,âa railroadin' man 'At runs a switch-engine, day out and day in, And's got to make hay while he can,â It's a dangersome job, I'll admit,âbut see what A fine-furnished home 'at he's already got! And PinkâW'y, the girl wuz just pinin' away,â So what could her old father do, When he found her, hid-like, in a loose load of hay, But jes' to drive on clean into The aidge of the city, whereâsingular thing!â Wade switched us away to the Squire, i jing! Nowâa-leavin' me hereâthey're driv off, with a cheer, On their weddin'-tripâwhich is to drive Straight home and tell Mother, and tol her back here And surrender me, dead er alive! So I'm waitin' hereânot so blame' overly gay As I wuz,â'cause I' got to face Mother to-day! NAME US NO NAMES NO MORE Sing, oh, rarest of roundelays!â Sing the hilarity and delight Of our childhood's gurgling, giggling days! When our eyes were as twinkling-keen and bright And our laughs as thick as the stars at night, And our breasts volcanoes of pent hoo-rays! When we grouped together in secret mirth And sniggered at everything on earthâ But specially when strange visitors came And we learned, for instance, that their name was Fishbackâor Mothersheadâor Philpottâ or Dalrympleâor Fullenwiderâor Applewhiteâ or Hunnicutâor Tubbsâor Oldshoe! ââOldshoe!ââjeminy-jee!â thinks weâ âHain't that a funny name!âtee-hee-hee!â Barefoot racers from everywhere, We'd pelt in over the back-porch floor For âthe settin'-room,â and cluster there Like a clot of bees round an apple-core, And sleeve our noses, and pinafore Our smearcase-mouths, and slick our hair, And stare and listen, and try to look Like âAgnesâ does in the old school-book,â Till at last we'd catch the visitor's name,â Reddinhouse, Lippscomb, or Burlingame,â or Winklerâor Smockâor Tutewilerâor Daubenspeckâor Throckmortonâor Rubottom âor Bixlerâ ââBixler!â jeminy-jee!â thinks weâ âHain't that a funny name!âtee-hee-hee!â Peace!âLet be!âFall away!âFetch loose!â We can't have fun as we had fun then!â Shut up, Memory!âwhat's the use?â When the girls and boys of 8 and 10 Are nowâwell, matronly, or old men, And Time has (so to say) âcooked our gooseâ! But ah! if we only could have back The long-lost laughs that we now so lack And so vainly long for,âhowâweâcould Naturely wake up the neigh-ber-hood, over the still heterogenious names ever unrolling from the endless roster of orthographic actualities,âsuch namesâfor further instance of good faithâsimply such names as Vanderlipâor Funkhouserâor Smootâor Galbreathâor Frybargerâor Dinwiddieâor Bouslogâor Puterbaughâor Longneckerâor Hartpenceâor Wigginsâor Pangbornâor Bowersoxâ âBowersoxâ! Gee!âBut alas! now we Taste salt tears in our âtee-hee-heeâ! HENRY IRVING OCTOBER 13, 1905 'Tis Art reclaims him! By those gifts of hers With which so nobly she endowed his mind, He brought back Shakespeare, in quick grief and gleeâ Tasting the world's salt tears and sweet applause,â For, even as through his master's, so there ran Through all his multitudinous characters Kinship and love and honor of mankind. So all mankind shall grace his memory In musing proudly: Great as his genius was, Great likewise was the man. LINCOLNâTHE BOY O simple as the rhymes that tell The simplest tales of youth, Or simple as a miracle Beside the simplest truthâ So simple seems the view we share With our Immortals, sheer From Glory looking down to where They were as children here. Or thus we know, nor doubt it not, The boy he must have been Whose budding heart bloomed with the thought All men are kith and kinâ With love-light in his eyes and shade Of prescient tears:âBecause Only of such a boy were made The loving man he was. NICHOLAS OBERTING A hero of ancient mold is Nicholas Oberting, of Hardentown, Indiana, who, a few days ago, in saving three boys from being gored to death by his infuriated bull, performed a feat of daring comparable only with the valorous deeds of Roman gladiators. ... âIndianapolis Star. Sing! O Voice of Valor, sing!â Sing of Nicholas Oberting! Giant of the strength of ten, Yet the gentlest of all men. He it was that loved the air, And the green fields everywhereâ Loved the meadow slopes and rills, And the cattle on the hillsâ Loved all out-o'-doors, and took Off his hat, with reverent look, As the balmy winds of Spring Waved the peach-bough, blossoming At the orchard edge, where he Paused to mark the minstrelsy Of the daring first redbreast, Whose lilt, at its loveliest, Was not lovelier to hear Than the laughter, ringing near, Of child-voicesâTruants,âthree Little stragglers, he could see, Crossing the near pasture-land Loiteringly, hand in hand, Laughing as they came. ... Untilâ Sudden ran a sickening chill Through the strong man's heart! ... He heard Scarce his own voice, afterward, For the maddened, bellowing roar Of the monster beast that bore Down upon the lads. ... Out rang His quick warning.âThen he sprang Forth to meet them, crying, âRun!â Straight for me!âCome on!âWell done!ââ Praised themâcheered them.ââGood! Hooray! Now, Red-top, you throw away That cap! but don'tââAnd breathless hung The sentence;âfor a root had flung The youngsterâstunnedâprone on the ground ... Thenâmidst a trampling, thund'rous sound, The bellowing beast, with his big bent head, And great horns, white as his eyes were red!â Charged for the lad, as he helpless lay ... There was a leap then; andâthey say (For but one boy had swooned away)â There was the leap and the laugh of a Man ... And the bravest war of the world began: Pinned by the horns in the Hercules grip Of his masterâthe slavering jaws adrip, The foaming, steaming, sweltering, hot- Mouthed monster raged and charged and fought,â But ever the great strong hands were set At their horny leverage, bloody-wet; And ever steadier pressed the hold, And ever the wild eyes wilder rolled As the thick neck turned, and the great hulk grew Like an o'er-fed engine, shuddering throughâ Yet the thick neck turnedâand turnedâand turnedâ Till the raw tongue shot from the throat and burned The live air foul; and the beast lurched dead Crunchingly. ... And the youngster said That the big man just lay there and criedâ He was so sorry and satisfied! RABBIT I s'pose it takes a feller 'at's be'n Raised in a country-town, like me, To 'preciate rabbits! ... Eight er ten Bellerin' boys and two er three Yelpin' dawgs all on the trail O' one little pop-eyed cottontail! 'Bout the first good fall o' snowâ So's you kin track 'em, don't you know, Where they've run,âand one by one Hop 'em up and chase 'em down And prod 'em out of a' old bresh-pile Er a holler log they're a-hidin' roun', Er, way en-nunder the ricked cord-wood Er crosstie-stack by the railroad track 'Bout a mile Out o' sight o' the whole ding town! ... Well! them's times 'at I call good! Rabbits!âw'y, as my thoughts goes back To them old boyhood days o' mine, I kin sic him now and see âOld Jackâ A-plowin' snow in a rabbit-track And a-pitchin' over him, head and heels, Like a blame' hat-rack, As the rabbit turns fer the timber-line Down the County Ditch through the old cornfields. ... Yes, and I'll say right here to you, Rabbits that boys has earnt, like thatâ Skinned and hung fer a night or two On the old back-porch where the pump's done frozeâ Then fried 'bout right, where your brekfust's at, With hot brown gravy and shortenin' bread,â Rabbits, like themâer I ort to 'a' said, I s'pose, Rabbits like those Ain't so p'ticalar pore, I guess, Fer eatin' purposes! A SPRING SONG AND A LATER She sang a song of May for me, Wherein once more I heard The mirth of my glad infancyâ The orchard's earliest birdâ The joyous breeze among the trees New-clad in leaf and bloom, And there the happy honey-bees In dewy gleam and gloom. So purely, sweetly on the sense Of heart and spirit fell Her song of Spring, its influenceâ Still irresistible,â Commands me hereâwith eyes ablurâ To mate her bright refrain, Though I but shed a rhyme for her As dim as Autumn rain. OURS LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY, DECEMBER 8, 1906 READ AT A BANQUET IN HONOR OF HENRY WATTERSON UPON HIS DEPARTURE FOR SPAIN Here where of old was heard The ringing, singing word That orator and bard Alike set free To soar, through heights profound, Our land's remotest bound, Till all is holy ground From sea to seaâ Here still, with voice and pen, One cheers the hopes of men And gives us faith againâ This gifted one We hold here as the guest Most honoredâloved the bestâ Wisest and worthiestâ Our Watterson. His spirit is the Seer'sâ For, though he sees and hears Through human doubts and fears, His heart is one With Earth's and the Divineâ With his home-heartsâand mineâ And the child's heart is thine, Our Watterson! Give us to touch and praise His worth in subtlest ways, Lest even our fondest gaze He fain would shunâ Laugh, though a mist appearsâ The glad wine salt with tearsâ Laugh, as we drain itââHere's Our Watterson!â OLD INDIANY Intended for a Dinner of The Indiana Society of Chicago Old Indiany, 'course we know Is first, and best, and most, also, Of all the States' whole forty-four:â She's first in ever'thing, that's shore!â And best in ever'way as yet Made known to man; and you kin bet She's most, because she won't confess She ever was, or will be, less! And yet, fer all her proud array Of sons, how many gits away!â No doubt about her bein' great But, fellers, she's a leaky State! And them that boasts the most about Her, them's the ones that's dribbled out. Law! jes' to think of all you boys 'Way over here in Illinoise A-celebratin', like ye air, Old Indiany, 'way back there In the dark ages, so to speak, A-prayin' for ye once a week And wonderin' what's a-keepin' you From comin', like you ort to do. You're all a-lookin' well, and like You wasn't âsidin' up the pike,â As the tramp-shoemaker said When âhe sacked the boss and shed The blame town, to hunt fer one Where they didn't work fer fun!â Lookin' extry well, I'd say, Your old home so fur away.â Maybe, though, like the old jour, Fun hain't all yer workin' fer. So you've found a job that pays Better than in them old days You was on The Weekly Press, Heppin' run things, more er less; Er a-learnin' telegraph- Operatin', with a half- Notion of the tinner's trade, Er the dusty man's that laid Out designs on marble and Hacked out little lambs by hand, And chewed finecut as he wrought, âShapin' from his bitter thoughtâ Some squshed mutterings to say,â âYes, hard work, and porer pay!â Er you'd kind o' thought the far- Gazin' kuss that owned a car And took pictures in it, had Jes' the snap you wantedâbad! And you even wondered why He kep' foolin' with his sky- Light the same on shiny days As when rainin'. ('T leaked always.) Wondered what strange things was hid In there when he shet the door And smelt like a burnt drug store Next some orchard-trees, i swan! With whole roasted apples on! That's why Ade is, here of late, Buyin' in the dear old state,â So's to cut it up in plots Of both town and country lots. LONGFELLOW 1807âFEBRUARY 27â1907 O gentlest kinsman of Humanity! Thy love hath touched all hearts, even as thy Song Hath touched all chords of music that belong To the quavering heaven-strung harp of harmony: Thou hast made man to feel and hear and see Divinely;âmade the weak to be the strong; By thy melodious magic, changed the wrong To changeless rightâand joyed and wept as we. Worlds listen, lulled and solaced at the spell That folds and holds usâsoul and body, too,â As though thy songs, as loving arms in stress Of sympathy and trust ineffable, Were thrown about us thus by one who knew Of common human need of kindliness. WITH A CHILD-BOOK TO MASTER PRESTON FROM HIS LONG INVISIBLE PLAYMATE There is LORE of more devices, And ROMANCE that more entices Higher minds and higher prices;â But, for âGiggle-boyâ or âCry-sisâ (With some sniffless interstices) Here's a little tale sufficesâ Sweet as oranges in slices Slobbed in slues o' cream and ices, Tanged with tingling, spangling spices.â Ho! there's no tale half so nice as This Old Tailor and his Mice is! THE DOCTOR He took the suffering human race, He read each wound, each weakness clear; And struck his finger on the place, And said: âThou ailest here, and here!â âMatthew Arnold We may idealize the chief of menâ Idealize the humblest citizen,â Idealize the ruler in his chairâ The poor man, or the poorer millionaire; Idealize the soldierâsailorâor The simple man of peaceâat war with war;â The hero of the sword or fife-and-drum. ... Why not idealize the Doctor some? The Doctor is, by principle, we know, Opposed to sentiment. He veils all show Of feeling, and is proudest when he hides The sympathy which natively abides Within the stoic precincts of a soul Which owns strict duty as its first control, And so must guard the ill, lest worse may come. ... Why not idealize the Doctor some? He is the master of emotionsâhe Is likewise certain of that mastery,â Or dare he face contagion in its ire, Or scathing fever in its leaping fire? He needs must smile upon the ghastly face That yearns up toward him in that warded place Where even the Saint-like Sisters' lips grow dumb. Why not idealize the Doctor some? He wisely hides his heart from you and meâ He hath grown tearless, of necessity,â He knows the sight is clearer, being blind; He knows the cruel knife is very kind; Ofttimes he must be pitiless, for thought Of the remembered wife or child he sought To save through kindness that was overcome. Why not idealize the Doctor some? Bear with him, trustful, in his darkest doubt Of how the mystery of death comes out; He knowsâhe knows,âay, better yet than we, That out of Time must dawn Eternity; He knows his own compassionâwhat he would Give in relief of all ills, if he could.â We wait alike one Master: He will come. Do we idealize the Doctor some? ABE MARTIN Abe Martin!âdad-burn his old picture! P'tends he's a Brown County fixtureâ A kind of a comical mixture Of hoss-sense and no sense at all! His mouth, like his pipe, 's allus goin', And his thoughts, like his whiskers, is flowin', And what he don't know ain't wuth knowin'â From Genesis clean to baseball! The artist, Kin Hubbard, 's so keerless He draws Abe 'most eyeless and earless, But he's never yet pictured him cheerless Er with fun 'at he tries to conceal,â Whuther on to the fence er clean over A-rootin' up ragweed er clover, Skeert stiff at some âRamblerâ er âRoverâ Er newfangled automobeel! It's a purty steep climate old Brown's in; And the rains there his ducks nearly drowns in The old man hisse'f wades his rounds in As ca'm and serene, mighty nigh As the old handsaw-hawg, er the mottled Milch cow, er the old rooster wattled Like the mumps had him 'most so well throttled That it was a pleasure to die. But best of 'em all's the fool-breaks 'at Abe don't see at all, and yit makes 'at Both me and you lays back and shakes at His comic, miraculous cracks Which makes himâclean back of the power Of genius itse'f in its flowerâ This Notable Man of the Hour, Abe Martin, The Joker on Facts. MORNING Breath of Morningâbreath of Mayâ With your zest of yesterday And crisp, balmy freshness, smite Our old hearts with Youth's delight. Tilt the cap of Boyhoodâyea, Where no âforelockâ waves, to-day,â Back, in breezy, cool excess, Stroke it with the old caress. Let us see as we have seenâ Where all paths are dewy-green, And all human-kind are kinâ Let us be as we have been! THE LOVELINESS Ah, what a long and loitering way And ever-lovely way, in truth, We travel on from day to day Out of the realms of youth! How eagerly we onward press The lovely path that lures us still With ever-changing loveliness Of grassy vale and hill: Of groves of May and morning-lands Dew-diamonded and gemmed with bloom; With amber streams and golden sands And aisles of gleam and gloom; Where lovely little Fairy-folk, In careless ambush, pipe and call From tousled ferns 'neath elm and oak By shoal and waterfall: Transparent even as the stream, The gnarlÃ¨d prison-tree reveals Its lovely Dryad in a dream That scarce itself conceals; The sudden redbird trips the sight And tricks the earâor doubtless we With happy palms had clapped the Sprite In new captivity. Onâon, through all the gathering years, Still gleams the loveliness, though seen Through dusks of loss and mists of tears That vainly intervene. Time stints us not of lovely thingsâ Old Age hath still a treasure-store,â The loveliness of songs and wings And voices on before.â Andâloveliness beyond all grace Of lovely words to say or sing,â The loveliness of Hope's fair face Forever brightening. A PARTING GUEST What delightful hosts are theyâ Life and Love! Lingering I turn away, This late hour, yet glad enough They have not withheld from me Their high hospitality. So, with face lit with delight And all gratitude, I stay Yet to press their hands and say, âThanks.âSo fine a time! Good night.â âOUT OF REACHâ You think them âout of reach,â your dead? Nay, by my own dead, I deny Your âout of reach.ââBe comforted: 'Tis not so far to die. O by their dear remembered smiles And outheld hands and welcoming speech, They wait for us, thousands of miles This side of âout of reach.â MY FOE My Foe? You name yourself, then,âI refuse A term so dark to designate you by. To me you are most kind and true; and I Am grateful as the dust is for the dews That brim the dusk, and falter, drip and ooze From the dear darkness of the summer sky. Vex not yourself for lack of moan or cry Of mine. Not any harm, nor ache nor bruise Could reach my soul through any stroke you fain Might launch upon me,âit were as the lance Even of the lightning did it leap to rend A ray of sunshineâ'twould recoil again. So, blessing you, with pitying countenance, I wave a hand to you, my helpless friend. SOME IMITATIONS I POMONA (Madison Cawein) Oh, the golden afternoon!â Like a ripened summer day That had fallen oversoon In the weedy orchard-wayâ As an apple, ripe in June. He had left his fishrod leant O'er the footlog by the springâ Clomb the hill-path's high ascent, Whence a voice, down showering, Lured him, wondering as he went. Not the voice of bee nor bird, Nay, nor voice of man nor child, Nor the creek's shoal-alto heard Blent with warblings sweet and wild Of the midstream, music-stirred. 'Twas a goddess! As the air Swirled to eddying silence, he Glimpsed about him, half aware Of some subtle sorcery Woven round him everywhere. Suavest slopes of pleasaunce, sown With long lines of fruited trees Weighed o'er grasses all unmown But by scythings of the breeze In prone swaths that flashed and shone Like silk locks of Faunus sleeked This, that way, and contrawise, Through whose bredes ambrosial leaked Oily amber sheens and dyes, Starred with petals purple-freaked. Here the bellflower swayed and swung, Greenly belfried high amid Thick leaves in whose covert sung Hermit-thrush, or katydid, Or the glowworm nightly clung. Here the damson, peach and pear; There the plum, in Tyrian tints, Like great grapes in clusters rare; And the metal-heavy quince Like a plummet dangled there. All ethereal, yet all Most material,âa theme Of some fabled festivalâ Save the fair face of his dream Smiling o'er the orchard wall. II THE PASSING OF A ZEPHYR (Sidney Lanier) Up from, and out of, and over the opulent woods and the plains, Lo! I leap nakedly loose, as the nudest of gods might choose, For to dash me away through the morning dews And the rathe Spring rainsâ Pat and pet the little green leaves of the trees and the grass, Till they seem to linger and cling, as I pass, And are touched to delicate contemporaneous tears of the rain and the dew, That lure mine eyes to weeping likewise, and to laughter, too: For I am become as the balmiest, stormiest zephyr of Spring, With manifold beads of the marvelous dew and the rain to string On the bended strands of the blossoms, blown And tossed and tousled and overthrown, And shifted and whirled, and lifted unfurled In the victory of the blossoming Of the flags of the flowery world. Yea, and behold! and a riotous zephyr, at last, I subside; I abate; I pass by; I am past. And the small, hoarse bass of the bumblebee Is my requiem-psalm, And I fling me down to a listless, loitering, long eternity Of amiable calm. III EF UNCLE REMUS PLEASE TER 'SCUSEN ME (Joel Chandler Harris) Dey wunce wuz er time which I gwineter tell you 'bout itâ An' it's easy ter believe it sho'ly ez it is ter doubt it!â So des you pick yer âruthersâ whilse I tell how ole Br'er Rabbit Wunce know de time when he git de fightin' habit. Co'se he ain't no bragger, des a-rippin' an' a-rarin' An' a-darin' all de beestus an' a-des a-double-darin' Sich ez Mr. Jonus Lion, er Sir Mr. Twister Tagger, Er Sister Hisstopottomus, er A'nt Ferjinny Ja'gger! Yit, des de same, he layin' low an' know he got de muscle What sho' ter s'prise mos' any size what crowd 'im fer a tussle.â But speshully he 'spise de Dawg, an' sight er one des make 'im Fergit hisse'f an' run 'em down an' grab 'em up an' shake 'em!â An', mo' 'n dat, ef 'twuzn't fer de Dawg-law den ag'in' it, He'd des a-kilt off ev'y Dawg dat's chasin' him dis minute! IV A RHYME FOR CHRISTMAS If Browning only were here, This yule-ish time o' the yearâ This mule-ish time o' the year, Stubbornly still refusing To add to the rhymes we've been using Since the first Christmas-glee (One might say) chantingly Rendered by rudest hinds Of the pelt-clad shepherding kinds Who didn't know Song from b- U-double-l's-foot!âpah!â (Haply the old Egyptian ptahâ Though I'd hardly wager a baw- Beeâor a bumble, for thatâ And that's flat!) ... But the thing that I want to get at Is a rhyme for Christmasâ Nay! nay! nay! nay! not isthmusâ The t- and the h-sounds covertly are Gnawing the nice auricular Senses until one may hear them gnarâ And the terminal, too, for mas is mus, So that will not do for us. Try for itâsigh for itâcry for itâdie for it! O but if Browning were here to apply for it, He'd rhyme you Christmasâ He'd make a mist pass Overâsomething o' rutherâ Or find you the rhyme's very brother In lovers that kissed fast To baffle the moonâas he'd lose the t-final In fas-t as it blended with to (mark the spinal Elisionâtip-clipt as exquisitely nicely And hyper-exactingly sliced to precisely The extremest technical need): Or he'd twist glass, Or he'd have a kissed lass, Or shake 'neath our noses some great giant fist-massâ No matter! If Robert were here, he could do it, Though it took us till Christmas next year to see through it. V Vaudeville Skits 1 SERENADE AT THE CABIN Oh, my little Sadie Sue, I's a-serenadin' youâ Fer you's de onliest lady-love o' mine; De White Folk's dance done over, I has still a chune er two Below your winder's mohnin'-glory-vine.

No overcoatâner underwear,â Right on de aidge o' winter I's up aginst de wust layout Dey's ever got me inter!â THE ROSE-LADY TO THE ROSES I dream that you are kisses Allah sent In forms material, that all the earth May taste of you and guess of Heaven's worth, Since it can waste such sweetness with content,â Seeing you showered o'er the Battlementâ By Angel-hands plucked ripe from lips of mirth And flung in lavish clusters, yet no dearth Of rapture for the Anthem! ... I have bent Above you, nestled in some low retreat, Pressing your velvet mouths against the dust, And, ever nurturing this old conceit, Have lifted up your lips in perfect trust Against my mouth, nor found them the less sweet For having kissed the dust beneath my feet. A HOOSIER CALENDAR JANUARY Bleak January! Cold as fate, And ever colderâever keenerâ Our very hair cut while we wait By winds that clip it ever cleaner: Cold as a miser's buried gold, Or nether-deeps of old traditionâ âIeems January!â you're a cold Proposition! FEBRUARY You, February,âseem to be Old January's understudy, But play the part too vaudeville-y,â With wind too moist and snow too muddyâ You overfreeze and overthawâ Your âHos'ler Joâ-like recitation But hints that you're, at best, a raw Imitation. MARCH And, March, you've got no friends to spareâ Warm friends, I meanâunless coal-dealers, Or gas-well owners, pipin' where The piper's paidâabove all spielers; You are a month, too, of complex Perversities beyond solutionâ A sort o' âloveliest of your sexâ Institution! APRIL But, April, when you kind o' come A-sa'nterin' down along our roadway, The bars is down, and we're at home, And you're as welcome as a show-day! First thing we know, the sunshine falls Spring-like, and drenches all Creation With that-'ere ba'm the poets calls âInspiration.â MAY And May!âIt's warmin' jest to see The crick thawed clear ag'in and dancin'â 'Pear-like it's tickled 'most as me A-prancin' 'crosst it with my pants on! And then to hear the bluebird whet His old song up and lance it through you, Clean through the boy's heart beatin' yetâ Hallylooya! JUNE Juneâ'Ll, I jest git doped on June!â The trees and grass all at their greenestâ The round earth swung 'twixt sun and moon, Jest at itsâso to sayâserenest:â In country,âstars and whipperwills; In town,âall night the boys invadin' Leadin' citizens' winder-sills, Sair-a-nadin'. JULY Fish still a-bitin'âsome; but 'most Too hot fer anything but layin' Jest do-less like, and watchin' clos't The treetops and the squirrels playin'â Their tail-tips switched 'bove knot and limb, But keepin' most in sequestrationâ Leavin' a big part to the im- Magination. AUGUST Now when it's AugustâI can tell It by a hundred signs and over;â They is a mixed ripe-apple-smell And mashed-down grass and musty clover; Bees is as lazy 'most as meâ Bee-bird eats 'emâgap's his wings out So lazy 'at I don't think he Spits their stings out! SEPTEMBER September, you appeal to all, Both young and old, lordly and lowly; You stuff the haymow, trough and stall, Till horse and cow's as roly-poly As pigs is, slopped on buttermilk And brand, shipstuff and 'tater-peelin'sâ And folks, too, feelin' fine as silk With all their feelin's! OCTOBER If I'd be'n asked for my advice, And thought the thing out, ca'm and soberâ Sizin' the months all once or twice,â I'd la'nch'd the year out with October. ... All Nature then jest veiled and dressed In weddin' gyarments, ornamented With ripe-fruit-gemsâand kissin' jest New-invented! NOVEMBER I'm 'feared November's hopes is few And far between!âCold as a Monday- Washday, er a lodge-man who You' got to pallbear for on Sunday; Colder and colder every dayâ The fixed official time for sighin',â A sinkin' state you jest can't stay In, or die in! DECEMBER Decemberâwhy, of course we grin And bear itâshiverin' every minute, Yet warm from time the month rolls in Till it skites out with Christmas in it; And so, for all its coldest truths And chill, goose-pimpled imperfections, It wads our lank old socks with Youth's Recollections. THE LITTLE WOMAN My little woman, of you I sing With a fervor all divine,â For I know the clasp of the hands that cling So closely here in mine. Though the rosy palms I used to press Are faded and worn with care, And tremulous is the old caress That nestles in my hair,â Your heart to me is a changeless page; I have read it bit by bit, From the dawn of love to the dusk of age,â And the tale is Holy Writ. Fold your eyes,âfor the twilight bends As a mother o'er her childâ Even as when, in the long-lost Then, You bent o'er ours and smiled. ... (Nay, but I spoke all unaware! See! I am kneeling, too, And with mine, dear, is the rose's prayer, With a blur of tears and dew.) But O little woman, I often grieve, As I think of the vanished years And trace the course of the cares that leave Your features dim with tears: I often grieve, for the frowns I wore When the world seemed all untrue,â When my hard, proud heart was sick and sore And would not come to you! I often grieve, as I hold your handâ As I hold your hand to-night,â That it takes so long to understand The lesson of love aright! But sing the song that I taught you once, Dear little woman, as then Away far back in the golden months:â Sing me the song again! For, as under the stars we loved of yore When the nights of love were long, Your poor, pale lips grow glad once more And I kiss them into song:â My little woman's hands are fair As even the moonflowers be When fairies creep in their depths and sleep Till the sun leaps out o' the sea. And O her eyes, they are spheres of lightâ So brighter than stars are they, The brightest day is the darkest night When my little woman's away. For my little woman has ever a tear And a sigh when I am sad; And I have a thousand smiles for her When my little woman is glad. But my little woman is strong and brave, For all of her tears and sighs, Her stanch little heart knows how to behave Whenever the storms arise. My little woman, of you I sing With a fervor all divine,â For I know the clasp of the hands that cling So closely here in mine. WHAT TITLE? What title best befits the man We hold our first American? Or Statesman; Soldier; Hero; Chief, Whose Country is his first belief: Or sanest, safest Leader; or True Patriot; or Orator, Heard still at Inspiration's height, Because he speaks for truth and right; Or shall his people be content With Our Republic's President, Or trust his ringing worth to live In song as Chief Executive? Nayâhis the simplest nameâthough set Upon him like a coronet,â God names our first American The highest, noblest nameâThe Man. YOU MAY NOT REMEMBER In the deep grave's charmÃ¨d chamber, Lying tranced in breathless slumber, You may haply not remember. You may not remember whether It was Spring or Summer weather; But I knowâwe two together At the dim end of the dayâ How the fireflies in the twilight Drifted by like flakes of starlight, Till o'er floods of flashing moonlight They were wave-like swept away. You may not remember any Word of mine of all the many Poured out for you there, though then a Soul inspirÃ¨d spake my love;â But I knewâand still review it, All my passion, as with awe it Welled in speech as from a poet Gifted of the gods above. Sleeping here, this hour I grieve in, You may not remember even Any kiss I still believe in, Or caress of ecstacy,â May not even dreamâO can't you?â That I kneel hereâweep hereâwant youâ Feign me in your grave, to haunt you, Since you come not back to me! Vain! ah, vain is all my yearning As the West's last embers burning Into ashes, slowly turning Ever to a denser gray!â While the fireflies in the twilight Drift about like flakes of starlight, Till o'er wastes of wannest moonlight They are wave-like swept away. THE REST V. K.âNATURALIST He rests at last, as on the mother-breast The playworn child at evening lies at rest,â For he, a buoyant child, in veriest truth, Has looked on life with eyes of changeless youth:â Has loved our green old earth here from the hour Of his first memory of bud and flowerâ Of morning's grassy lawns and dewy trees And orchard-blossoms, singing birds and bees: When all the world about him was a land Elysian, with the mother near at hand: With steadfast gaze of wonder and delight He marked the miracles of day and night:â Beheld the kingly sun, in dazzling reign By day; and, with her glittering, glimmering train Of stars, he saw the queenly moon possess Her throne in midmost midnight's mightiness. All living least of things he ever knew Of mother Earth's he was a brother to: The lone rose by the brookâor, under, where The swaying water-lilies anchored there; His love dipped even to the glossy things That walked the waters and forgot their wings In sheer insanity of some delight Known but to that ecstatic parasite. It was enough, thus childishly to sense All worksâsince worthy of Omnipotenceâ As worshipful: Therefor, as any child, He knelt in tenderness of tears, or smiled His gratefulness, as to a playmate glad To share His pleasures with a poorer lad. And so he lived: And so he died?âAh, no, We'll not believe that till he tells us so. WE MUST BELIEVE Lord, I believe: help Thou mine unbelief. I We must believeâ Being from birth endowed with love and trustâ Born unto loving;âand how simply just That loveâthat faith!âeven in the blossom-face The babe drops dreamward in its resting-place, Intuitively conscious of the sure Awakening to rapture ever pure And sweet and saintly as the mother's own Or the awed father's, as his arms are thrown O'er wife and child, to round about them weave And wind and bind them as one harvest-sheaf Of loveâto cleave to, and forever cleave. ... Lord, I believe: Help Thou mine unbelief. II We must believeâ Impelled since infancy to seek some clear Fulfilment, still withheld all seekers here;â For never have we seen perfection nor The glory we are ever seeking for: But we have seenâall mortal souls as oneâ Have seen its promise, in the morning sunâ Its blest assurance, in the stars of night;â The ever-dawning of the dark to light;â The tears down-falling from all eyes that grieveâ The eyes uplifting from all deeps of grief, Yearning for what at last we shall receive. ... Lord, I believe: Help Thou mine unbelief. III We must believe: For still all unappeased our hunger goes, From life's first waking, to its last repose: The briefest life of any babe, or man Outwearing even the allotted span, Is each a life unfinishedâincomplete: For these, then, of th' outworn, or unworn feet Denied one toddling stepâO there must be Some fair, green, flowery pathway endlessly Winding through lands Elysian! Lord, receive And lead each as Thine Own Childâeven the Chief Of us who didst Immortal life achieve. ... Lord, I believe: Help Thou mine unbelief. THE HIRED MAN'S DOG-STORY Twa dogs that were na thrang at hame Forgather'd ance upon a time. âBurns Dogs, I contend, is jes' about Nigh humanâgit 'em studied out. I hold, like us, they've got their own Reasonin' powers 'at's theirs aloneâ Same as their tricks and habits too, Provin', by lots o' things they do, That instinct's not the only thing That dogs is governed by, i jing!â And I'll say furder, on that line, And prove it, that they's dogs a-plenty Will show intelligence as fine As ary ten men out o' twenty! Jevver investigate the way Sheep-killin' dogs goes at itâhey? Well, you dig up the facts and you Will find, first thing, they's always two Dogs goes together on that spree O' blood and puore dog-deviltry! And, then, they always go at nightâ Mind ye, it's never in daylight, When folks is up and wide awake,â No self-respectin' dogs'll make Mistakes o' judgment on that score,â And I've knowed fifty head or more O' slaughtered sheep found in the lot, Next morning the old farmer got His folks up and went out to feed,â And every livin' soul agreed That all night long they never heerd The bark o' dog ner bleat o' skeered And racin', tromplin' flock o' sheep A-skallyhootin' roun' the pastur', To rouse 'em from their peaceful sleep To that heart-renderin' disaster! Well, now, they's actchul evidence In all these facts set forth; and hence When, by like facts, it has been foun' That these two dogsâcolloguin' roun' At night as thick as thievesâby day Don't go together anyway, And, 'pearantly, hain't never met Each other; and the facts is set On record furder, that these smart Old pards in crime lives miles apartâ Which is a trick o' theirs, to throw Off all suspicion, don't you know!â One's a town-dogâbelongin' to Some good man, maybeâer to you!â And one's a country-dog, er âjay,â As you nickname us thataway. Well, now!âthese is the facts I' got (And, mind ye, these is factsânot guesses) To argy on, concernin' what Fine reasonin' powers dogs p'sesses. My idy is,âthe dog lives in The town, we'll say, runs up ag'in The country-dog, some Saturday, Under a' old farm-wagon, say, Down at the Court-house hitchin'-rack.â Both lifts the bristles on their back And show their teeth and growl as though They meant it pleasant-like and low, In case the fight hangs fire. And they Both wag then in a friendly way, The town-dog sayin':ââSeems to me, Last Dimocratic jubilee, I seen you here in town somewhere?â The country-dog says:â âRight you air!â And right here's where you seen me, too, Under this wagon, watchin' you!â âYes,â says the town-dog,ââand I thought We'd both bear watchin', like as not.â And as he yawns and looks away, The country-dog says, âWhat's your lay?â The town-dog whets his feet a spell And yawns ag'in, and then says,ââWell, Before I answer thatâAin't you A Mill Crick dog, a mile er two From old Chape Clayton's stock-farmâsay?â âWho told you?â says the jay-dogââhey?â And looks up, real su'prised. âI guessed,â The town-dog saysââYou tell the rest,â How's old Chape's mutton, anyhow?â How many of 'em's ready nowâ How many of 'em's ripe enough fer use, And how's the hot, red, rosy juice?â â'Mm!â says the country-dog, âI think I sort o' see a little blink O' what you mean.â And then he stops And turns and looks up street and lops His old wet tongue out, and says he, Lickin' his lips, all slobbery, âAd-drat my melts! you're jes' my man!â I'll trust you, 'cause I know I can!â And then he says, âI'll tell you jes' How things is, and Chape's carelessness About his sheep,âfer instance, say, To-morry Chapes'll all be 'way To Sund'y-meetin'âand ag'in At night.â âAt night? That lets us in!â âBetter the dayâââthe town-dog saysâ ââBetter the deed.â We'll pray; Lord, yes!â May the outpourin' grace be shed Abroad, and all hearts comforted Accordin' to their lights!â says he, âAnd that, of course, means you and me.â And then they both snarled, low and quietâ Swore where they'd meet. And both stood by it! Jes' half-past eight on Sund'y night, Them two dogs meets,âthe town-dog, light O' foot, though five mile' he had spanned O' field, beech-wood and bottom-land. But, as books says,âwe draw a veil Over this chapter of the tale! ... Yit when them two infernal, mean, Low, orn'ry whelps has left the scene O' carnageâchased and putt to death The last pore sheep,âthey've yit got breath Enough to laugh and joke about The fun they've had, while they sneak out The woods-way fer the old crick where They both plunge in and wash their hair And rench their bloody mouths, and grin, As each one skulks off home ag'inâ Jes' innardly too proud and glad To keep theirselves from kind o' struttin', Thinkin' about the fun they'd hadâ When their blame wizzens needed cuttin'! Dogs is deliber't.âThey can bide Their time till s'picions all has died. The country-dog don't 'pear to care Fer town no more,âhe's off somewhere When the folks whistles, as they head The team t'ards town. As I jes' said,â Dogs is deliber't, don't forgit! So this-here dog he's got the grit To jes' deprive hisse'f o' town For 'bout three weeks. But time rolls roun'! ... Same as they first met:âSaturdayâ Same Court-houseâhitch-rackâand same way The team wuz hitchedâsame wagon where The same jay-dog growls under there When same town-dog comes loafin' by, With the most innocentest eye And giner'l meek and lowly style, As though he'd never cracked a smile In all his mortal days!âAnd both Them dogs is strangers, you'd take oath!â Both keeps a-lookin' sharp, to see If folks is watchin'âjes' the way They acted that first Saturday They talked so confidentchully. âWellââsays the town-dog, in a low And careless toneââWell, whatch you know?â ââKnow?ââ says the country-dogââLots more Than some smart people knowsâthat's shore!â And then, in his dog-language, he Explains how slick he had to be When some suspicious folks come roun' A-tryin' to track and run him downâ Like he'd had anything to do With killin' over fifty head O' sheep! âJes' think!âand meââhe said, âAnd me as innocent as you, That very hour, five mile' away In this town like you air to-day!â âAh!â says the town-dog, âthere's the beauty O' bein' prepared for what may be, And washin' when you've done your duty!â No stain o' blood on you er me Ner wool in our teeth!âThen,â says he, âWhen wicked man has wronged us so, We ort to learn to be forgivin'â Half the world, of course, don't know How the other gits its livin'!â PERVERSITY You have more'n likely noticed, When you didn't when you could, That jes' the thing you didn't do Was jes' the thing you should. HER POET-BROTHER Oh! what ef little childerns all Wuz big as parunts is! Nen I'd join pa's Masonic Hall An' wear gold things like his!

THE POOR STUDENT With song elate we celebrate The struggling Student wight, Who seeketh still to pack his pate With treasures erudite; Who keepeth guard and watch and ward O'er every hour of day, Nor less to slight the hours of night, He watchful is alway. Though poor in pence, a wealth of sense He storeth in excessâ With poverty in opulence, His needs wax never less. His goods are few,âa shelf or two Of classics, and a chairâ A banjoâwith a bird's-eye view Of back-lots everywhere. In midnight gloom, shut in his room, His vigils he protracts, E'en to the morning's hectic bloom, Accumulating facts: And yet, despite or wrong or right, He nurtureth a ban,â He hath the stanchless appetite Of any hirÃ¨d man. On Jason's fleece and storied Greece He feeds his hungry mind; Then stuffs himself like a valise With âeatsâ of any kind: With kings he feigns he feasts, and drains The wines of ages goneâ Then husks a herring's cold remains And turns the hydrant on. In Trojan mail he fronts the gale Of ancient battle-rout, When, 'las the hour! his pipe must fail, And his last âsnipeâ smush outâ Nor pauses he, unless it be To quote some cryptic scroll And poise a sardine pensively O'er his immortal soul. UNCLE SIDNEY'S RHYMES Little Rapacity Greed was a glutton: He'd eat any meat, from goose-livers to mutton; All fowl, flesh, or sausage with all savors through itâ You never saw sausage stuffed as he could do it!

Chorus Ho, it's hard times together, We've had 'em, you and I, In all kinds of weather, Let it be wet or dry; But I'm bound to earn my livelihood Or lay me down and die! Poverty compels me To face the snow and sleet,â For pore wife and children Must have a crust to eat.â The sad wail of hunger It would drive me insane, If it wasn't for Blue-Monday When I git to work againe! Chorus Ho, it's hard times together, We've had 'em, you and I, In all kinds of weather, Let it be wet or dry; But I'm bound to earn my livelihood Or lay me down and die!

Lor', Boss! how we love ye For your warm kynd heart! Chorus Ho, it's hard times together, We've had 'em, you and I, In all kinds of weather, Let it be wet or dry; But I'm bound to earn my livelihood Or lay me down and die! THE THOUGHTS OF YOUTH THE BOYS' The lisping maid, In shine and shade Half elfin and half human, We love as suchâ Yet twice as much Will she be loved as woman. THE GIRLS' The boy we see, Of two or threeâ Or even as a baby, We love to kiss For what he is, Yet more for what he may be. O. HENRY WRITTEN IN THE CHARACTER OF SHERRARD PLUMMER O Henry, A frite-chef of all delight!â Of all delectables conglomerate That stay the starved brain and rejuvenate The mental man. Th' esthetic appetiteâ So long anhungered that its âin'ardsâ fight And growl gutwise,âits pangs thou dost abate And all so amiably alleviate, Joy pats its belly as a hobo might Who haply hath attained a cherry pie With no burnt bottom in it, ner no seedsâ Nothin' but crispest crust, and thickness fit, And squshin'âjuicy, and jes' mighty nigh Too dratted drippin'-sweet fer human needs, But fer the sosh of milk that goes with it. WILLIAM McKINLEY CANTON, OHIO, SEPTEMBER 30, 1907 He said: âIt is God's way: His will, not ours be done.â And o'er our land a shadow lay That darkened all the sun. The voice of jubilee That gladdenÃ©d all the air, Fell sudden to a quavering key Of suppliance and prayer. He was our chiefâour guideâ Sprung of our common Earth, From youth's long struggle proved and tried To manhood's highest worth: Through toil, he knew all needs Of all his toiling kindâ The favored striver who succeedsâ The one who falls behind. The boy's young faith he still Retained through years matureâ The faith to labor, hand and will, Nor doubt the harvest sureâ The harvest of man's loveâ A nation's joy that swells To heights of Song, or deeps whereof But sacred silence tells. To him his Country seemed Even as a Mother, where He restedâslept; and once he dreamedâ As on her bosom thereâ And thrilled to hear, within That dream of her, the call Of bugles and the clang and din Of war. ... And o'er it all His rapt eyes caught the bright Old Banner, winging wild And beck'ning him, as to the fight ... Whenâeven as a childâ He wakenedâAnd the dream Was real! And he leapt As led the proud Flag through a gleam Of tears the Mother wept. His was a tender handâ Even as a woman's isâ And yet as fixed, in Right's command, As this bronze hand of his: This was the Soldier braveâ This was the Victor fairâ This is the Hero Heaven gave To glory hereâand There. âMOTHERâ I'm gittin' oldâI know,â It seems so long agoâ So long sence John was here! He went so young!âour Jim 'S as old now 'most as him,â Close on to thirty year'! I know I'm gittin' oldâ I know it by the cold, From time 'at first frost flies.â Seems likeâsence John was hereâ Winters is more severe; And winter I de-spise! And yet it seems, some days, John's here, with his odd ways ... Comes soon-like from the corn- Field, callin' âMotherâ at Meâlike he called me that Even 'fore Jim was born! When Jim comeâLa! how good Was all the neighborhood!â And Doctor!âwhen I heerd Him joke John, kind o' low, And say: Yes, folks could goâ PA needn't be afeard! When Jim come,âJohn says-'eâ A-bendin' over me And baby in the bedâ And jes' us three,âsays-'e âOur little family!â And that was all he said ... And cried jes' like a child!â Kissed me again, and smiled,â 'Cause I was cryin' too. And here I am again A-cryin', same as thenâ Yet happy through and through! The old home's most in mind And joys long left behind ... Jim's little h'istin' crawl Acrost the floor to where John set a-rockin' there ... (I'm gittin' oldâThat's all!) I'm gittin' oldâno doubtâ (Healthy as all git-out!)â But, strangest thing I do,â I cry so easy nowâ I cry jes' anyhow The fool-tears wants me to! But Jim he won't be told 'At âMotherâ 's gittin' old! ... Hugged me, he did, and smiled This morning, and bragged âshoreâ He loved me even more Than when he was a child! That's his way; but ef John Was here now, lookin' on, He'd shorely know and see: âBut, âMother,ââ s'pect he'd say, âS'pose you air gittin' gray, You're younger yet than me!â I'm gittin' old,âbecause Our young days, like they was, Keeps comin' backâso clear, 'At little Jim, once more, Comes h'istin' crost the floor Fer John's old rockin'-cheer! O beautiful!âto be A-gittin' old, like me! ... Hey, Jim! Come in now, Jim! Your supper's ready, dear! (How more, every year, He looks and acts like him!)

Yes, and Old Flag, streamin' clean From the high arch 'bove the scene And each side the Speaker's stand.â And a Brass, and Sheepskin Band, ('Twixt the speeches 'at was made) 'At cut loose and banged and playedâ S'pose, to have the noise all through So's th' crowd could listen to Some real music!âThen Th' Old Glee Club marched out to victory!â And sich singin'!âBoys was jest At their very level-best! ...

Well! that song's a song my soul Jest swings off in, past control!â Allus did and allus will Lift me clair of earthly ill And interrogance and doubt O' what the good Lord's workin' out Anyway er anyhow! ... Shet my eyes and hear it now!â Till, at night, that ship and sea And wet waves jest wallers me Into that same sad yet glad Certainty the Sailor had When waked to his watch and ward By th' lone whisper of the Lordâ Heerd high 'bove the hoarsest roar O' any storm on sea er shore! Time's be'n clockin' on, you know! Sabold, who was first to go, Died back East, in ninety-three, At his old home, Albany: Ward was next to leave usâDied New York. ...

Old Glee Club's be'n meetin' less And less frequenter, I guess, Sence so many's had to goâ And the rest all miss 'em so! Still they's calls they' got to make, Fer old reputation's sake, So to speak; but, 'course, they all Can't jest answer ever' callâ 'Ceptin' Christmas-times, er when Charity calls on 'em then; Andânot chargin' anythingâ W'y, the Boys's jest got to sing! ... Campaign work, and jubilees To wake up the primaries; Loyal LegionsâG. A. R.'sâ Big ReunionsâStripes-and-Stars Fer Schoolhouses ever'whereâ And Church-doin's, here and thereâ And Me-morial Meetin's, when Our War-Gov'ner lives again!

O that sweetest, saddest sound!â âTenting on the old Campground.â ...

Can't Iâmany-a-timeâjest see Them all, like they used to be!â Tarkington, fer instance, clean Outside o' the man you seen, Singin'âtill not only you Heerd his voice but felt it, too, In back of the bench you set InâAnd 'most can feel it yet! Yes, and Will's the last o' five Now that's deadâyet still alive, True as Holy Writ's own word Has be'n spoke and man has heerd! Them was left when Will went on Has met once sence he was goneâ Met jest onceâbut not to sing Ner to practise anything.â Facts is, they jest didn't know Why they was a-meetin' so;â But John Brush he had it done And invited ever' one Of 'em he could find, to call At his office, âMusic Hall,â Four o'clockâone Saturd'y Afternoon.âAnd this was three Er four weeks, mind, sence the day We had laid poor Will away. Mahlon Butler he come past My shop, and I dropped my last And went with him, wonder'n', too, What new joke Brush had in view;â But, when all got there, and one- By-one was give' a seat, and none O' Brush's twinkles seemed in sight, 'N' he looked biz all right, all right,â We sawâwhen he'd locked the doorâ What some of us, years before, Had seen, and long sence fergotâ (Seen but not heerd, like as not.)â How Brush, once when Admiral Brown 'S back here in his old home-town And flags ever'wheresâand Old Glee Club tellin' George to âHold The Fort!â and âWeâ would âmake 'em flee By land and sea,â et cetery,â How Brush had got the Boys to sing A song' in that-there very thing Was on the table there to-dayâ Some kind o' 'phone, you know.âBut say! When John touched it off, and we Heerd it singin'âNo-sir-ee!â Not the machine a-singin'âNo,â Th' Old Glee Club o' long ago! ... There was Sabold's voice againâ 'N' Ward's;âand, sweet as summer-rain, With glad boy-laughture's trills and runs, Ed. Thompson's voice and Tarkington's! ... And ah, to hear them, through the storm Of joy that swayed each listener's formâ Seeming to call, with hail and cheer, From Heaven's high seas down to us here:â âBut who can speak the joy he feels While o'er the foam his vessel reels, And his tired eyelids slumbering fall, He rouses at the welcome call Of âLarboard Watch, Ahoy!ââ And O To hear themâsame as long agoâ The listeners whispered, still as death, With trembling lips and broken breath, As with one voiceâand eyes all wet,â âGod!âGod!âThank God, they're singing yet!â âMONA MACHREEâ Mona Machree, I'm the wanderin' creature now, Over the sea; Slave of no lass, but a lover of Nature now, Careless and free. âT.

SONG DISCORDANT I want to say it, and I will:â You are as sour as you are sweet, And sweeter than the daffodil That blossoms at your feet.â You are as plain as you are fair; And though I hate, I love you still, And soâconfound you, darling! There!â I want to say it, and I will! I want to ask it, and I do Demand of you a perfect trust,â But love me as I want you toâ You must, you minx!âyou must!

So we dined an' wined together, When the Ould Year died, An' agreed on health an' weather, An' the whule wurrld wide, An' says aI,ââaI'm thinkin' very Much it's you aI'd like to marry.â âThen,â says she, âwhy don't you, Larry?â When the Ould Year died. LISPING IN NUMBERS We' got a' Uncle writes poetry-rhymes Fer me an' Eddie to speak, sometimes,â 'Cause he's a poetâan' he gits paid Fer poetry-writin',â'cause that's his trade. An' Eddie says he's goin' to try To be a poet, too, by an' by When he's a man!âan' I 'spect he is, 'Cause on his slate wunst he print' this An' call it âThe Squirl and the Funy Litel Girlâ âA litel girl Whose name wuz Perl Went to the woods to play. The day wuz brite, An' her hart wuz lite As she galy skiped a way. âA queer litel chatter, A soft litel patter, She herd in the top of a tree: The surprizd litel Perl Saw a qute litel squirl, As cuning as cuning cud be. âShe twisted her curl, As she looked at the squirl, An' playfully told it âgood day!â She calld it âBunnyââ Wuzent that funy?

Sprung of our oldest, noblest ancestry, His pride of birth, as lofty as sincere, Held kith and kin, as Country, ever dearâ Such was his sacred faith in you and me. Thus, natively, from youth his work was one Unselfish service in behalf of allâ Home, friends and sharers of his toil and stress; Ay, loving all men and despising none, And swift to answer every righteous call, His life was one long deed of worthiness. The voice of Duty's faintest whisper found Him as alert as at her battle-cryâ When awful War's battalions thundered by, High o'er the havoc still he heard the sound Of mothers' prayers and pleadings all around; And ever the despairing sob and sigh Of stricken wives and orphan children's cry Made all our Land thrice consecrated ground. So rang his âForward!â and so swept his swordâ On!âon!âtill from the fire-and-cloud once more Our proud Flag lifted in the glad sunlight As though the very Ensign of the Lord Unfurled in token that the strife was o'er, And victoryâas everâwith the right. LEE O. HARRIS CHRISTMAS DAYâ1909 O say not he is dead, The friend we honored so; Lift up a grateful voice instead And say: He lives, we knowâ We know it by the light Of his enduring love Of honor, valor, truth and right, And man, and God above. Remember how he drew The child-heart to his own, And taught the parable anew, And reaped as he had sown; Remember with what cheer He filled the little lives, And stayed the sob and dried the tear With mirth that still survives. All duties to his kind It was his joy to fill; With nature gentle and refined, Yet dauntless soul and will, He met the trying need Of every troublous call, Yet high and clear and glad indeed He sung above it all. Ay, listen! Still we hear The patriot song, the lay Of love, the woodland note so dearâ These will not die away. Then say not he is dead, The friend we honor so, But lift a grateful voice instead, And say: He lives, we know. SOMETHING Sitting by the glimmer Of the fire to-night, Though the glowing embers Sparkle with delightâ There's a sense of something, Vaguely understood, Stealing o'er the spirit As a shadow would. Is it that the shutter Shudders in the wind As a lance of moonshine Shivers through the blind? Or the lamplight dancing In pretended glee As the keynote whistles In a minor key? Footsteps on the sidewalk, Crunching through the snow, Seem to whisper something Of the long agoâ And the merry greetings Of the passers-by Seem like truant echoes Coming home to die. I have coaxed my pencil For a smiling face, But the sketch is frowning And devoid of grace; And the airy waltzes Of my violin Die away in dirges Ere I well begin. Lay away the storyâ Though the theme is sweetâ There's a lack of something Makes it incomplete; There's a nameless yearningâ Strangely undefinedâ For a something better Than the common kind. Something! Oh, that something! We may never know Why the soul is haunted Ever thus and so, Till the longing spirit Answers to the call Of the trumpet sounding Something after all. A CHRISTMAS-TIME JINGLE My dears, do you know, one short Christmas ago, There were two little children named Jimpsy and Jo, Who were stolen away by their Uncle that day, Who drove round and carted them off in a sleigh? And the two little chaps, rolled in buffalo wraps, With their eyes in the furs and their hands in their laps, He whizzed down the street, through the snow and the sleet At a gait old Kriss Kringle himself couldn't beat. And their Uncle yelled âHo!â all at once, and then âWhoa! Mr. Horses, this store is where we must go.â And as the sleigh stopped, up the heads popped, And out on the sidewalk the old Uncle hopped. And he took the boys in, with a wink and a grin, And had 'em dressed clean up from toe-tip to chin, Then he bundled 'em back in the sleigh, and currack! Went the whip; and away they all went whizzin' back. And Jimpsy and Jo, when they marched in, you know, There at home, with new suits, both their parents says âOh, What dee-lishamous rare little children you air,â W'y you' got the best Uncle tha' is anywhere!â But their Uncle just pats the boys' heads and says, âRats!â In a whisper to themââParents purr same as catsâ; Then he kissed 'em and rose and fished round in his clothes, And lit his old pipe with the end of his nose. WHEN BABY PLAYED When Baby played, The very household tasks were stayed To listen to her voice:âSecrete, We heard her lisping, low and sweet, Among her many dolls and pets; Or, at her window's mignonettes, Making some butterflyâarrayed In tremulous goldâall unafraidâ When Baby played. When Baby played Amidst the reapers,âwhy, they laid Their work aside, and with loud glee Tossed her among them tenderly; And they did single, from the blur Of tousled grasses, blooms for herâ To wreathe about her throat and wrist, While for the service each was kissed, And on till evensong was made So happier.âWhen Baby played. When Baby played, The lilies down the everglade Grew purerâwhere the waters leapt, The willows laughed instead of wept; And the glad winds went merrying To sway the empty grapevine-swing She needs must leave, in answer to Our call from home at fall of dewâ And mimicking the call we made.â When Baby played,âwhen Baby played. WHEN BABY SLEPT When weenty-teenty Baby slept,â With voices stilled we lightly stepped And knelt beside the rug where she Had fallen in sleep all wearily; And when a dimpled hand would stir, We breathlessly bent over her And kissed the truant strands that swept The tranc'd lids and the dreams that keptâ When Baby blinked her Court and slept. When Baby waived her throne and slept, It seemed the sunshine lightlier crept Along the carpet and the wall, Her playhouse, tea-set, pets and all:â A loud fly hushed its hum and made The faintest Fairy-serenade, That lulled all waking things except The goldfish as he flashed and leaptâ When Baby doffed her crown and slept. When sunset veiled her as she slept, No other sight might intercept Our love-looks, meant for her alone The fairest blossom ever blown In all God's garden-lands below! Our Spirits whispered, Even so, And made high mirth in undertone, In stress of joy all sudden grown A laugh of tears:âfor thus we wept, When Baby donned her dreams, and slept. WHEN BABY WOKE When weenty-teenty Baby woke, It seemed all summer blossoms broke In fragrant laughterâthat the birds, Instead of warbles, sang in words!â Oh, it did seem to us (who, in Our rapture, dappled cheek and chin With our warm kisses) to invoke Our love to break as morning broke!â When wondrous Baby woke. When our enraptured Baby woke,â As when on violets sink and soak The dewdrops of some glorious dawn,â So seemed the eyes we gazed upon; And when they smiled, we, bending lower, Knew never sunlight any more Would be as bright to usâand thus Forever must they shine for us! When Baby dewed her eyes and woke. When Baby danced her eyes and wokeâ The hearts within us, stroke on stroke, Went throbbing like the pulse of some High harmony harp-strings might thrum In halls enchanted of the lore Of Arthur's court in days of yore,â To us she was âa princess fairââ An âElfin QueenâââA ladye rareââ And we but simple-minded folkâ When Baby woke,âwhen Baby woke. A HOBO VOLUNTARY Oh, the hobo's life is a roving life; It robs pretty maids of their heart's delightâ It causes them to weep and it causes them to mourn For the life of a hobo, never to return. The hobo's heart it is light and free, Though it's Sweethearts all, farewell to thee!â Farewell to thee, for it's far away The homeless hobo's footsteps stray. In the morning bright, or the dusk so dim, It's any path is the one for him! He'll take his chances, long or short, For to meet his fate with a valiant heart. Oh, it's beauty mops out the sidetracked-car, And it's beauty-beaut' at the pigs-feet bar; But when his drinks and his eats is made Then the hobo shunts off down the grade. He camps near town, on the old crick-bank, And he cuts his name on the water-tankâ He cuts his name and the hobo sign,â âBound for the land of corn and wine!â He's lonesome-like, so he gits run in, To git the hang o' the world again; But the laundry circles he moves in there Makes him sigh for the country air,â So it's Good-by gals! and he takes his chance And wads hisself through the workhouse-fence; He sheds the town and the railroad, too, And strikes mud roads for a change of view. The jay drives by on his way to town, And looks on the hobo in high scorn, And so likewise does the farmhands stareâ But what the haids does the hobo care! He hits the pike, in the summer's heat Or the winter's cold, with its snow and sleetâ With a boot on one foot, and one shoeâ Or he goes barefoot, if he chooses to. But he likes the best when the day is warm, With his bum prince-albert on his armâ He likes to size up a farmhouse where They haint no man nor bulldog there. Oh, he gits his meals wherever he can, So natchurly he's a handy manâ He's a handy man both day and night, And he's always blest with an appetite! (Oh, it's I like friends that he'ps me through, And the friends also that he'ps you, too,â Oh, I like all friends, 'most every kind But I don't like friends that don't like mine.) There's friends of mine when they gits the hunch Comes a swarmin' in, the blasted bunch,â âClog-step Jonnyâ and âFlat-wheel Billâ And âBrockey Ikeâ from Circleville. With âCooney Wardâ and âSikes the Kidâ And old âPop Lawsonââthe best we hadâ The rankest mug and the worst for lush And the dandiest of the whole blame push. Oh, them's the times I remembers best When I took my chance with all the rest, And hogged fried chicken and roastin' ears, too, And sucked cheroots when the feed was through. Oh, the hobo's way is the railroad line, And it's little he cares for schedule time; Whatever town he's a-striken for Will wait for him till he gits there. And whatever burg that he lands in There's beauties there just thick for himâ There's beauty at âThe Queen's Taste Lunchstand,â sure, Or âThe Last Chance Boardin' Houseâ back door. A tin o' black coffee, and a rhuburb pieâ Be they old and cold as charityâ They're hot-stuff enough for the pore hobo, And it's âThanks, kind lady, for to treat me so!â Then he fills his pipe with a stub cigar And swipes a coal from the kitchen-fire, And the hired girl says, in a smilin' tone,â âIt's good-by, John, if you call that goin'!â Oh, the hobo's life is a roving life, It robs pretty maids of their heart's delightâ It causes them to weep and it causes them to mourn For the life of a hobo, never to return.

PARKER You sang the song of rare delight â'Tis morning and the days are longââ A morning fresh and fair and bright As ever dawned in happy song; A radiant air, and here and there Were singing birds on sprays of bloom, And dewy splendors everywhere, And heavenly breaths of rose perfumeâ All rapturous things were in the song â'Tis morning and the days are long.â O singer of the song divine, Though now you turn your face away With never word for me or mine Nor smile forever and a day, We guess your meaning, and rejoice In what has come to youâthe meed Beyond the search of mortal voice And only in the song indeedâ With you forever, as the song, â'Tis morning and the days are long.â MY CONSCIENCE Sometimes my Conscience says, says he, âDon't you know me?â And I, says I, skeered through and through, âOf course I do. You air a nice chap ever' way, I'm here to say! You make me cryâyou make me pray, And all them good things thatawayâ That is, at night. Where do you stay Durin' the day?â And then my Conscience says, onc't more, âYou know meâshore?â âOh, yes,â says I, a-trimblin' faint, âYou're jes' a saint! Your ways is all so holy-right, I love you better ever' night You come around,âtel' plum daylight, When you air out o' sight!â And then my Conscience sort o' grits His teeth, and spits On his two hands and grabs, of course, Some old remorse, And beats me with the big butt-end O' that thingâtel my clostest friend 'Ud hardly know me. âNow,â says he, âBe keerful as you'd orto be And allus think o' me!â</field>
