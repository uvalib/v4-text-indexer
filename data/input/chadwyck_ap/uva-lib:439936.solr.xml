      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. PARCHMENTS AND PORTRAITS BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION. EXTRACT FROM A LETTER. Where am I? What am I about? you ask, And scold me well that all this summer long I have not written. Let me make amends And cry, Peccavi! (if that makes amends,) Acknowledge all my sins, and, chief of them, Pure laziness, for which full well you know I have so strong a talent that almost It might be called a genius. All these days I have done nothingânothing more at least Than trees and grass and weeds, that simply bask In the warm sunshine, drink the evening's dew, And grow and feed upon the air, unplagued By any thought of work, that fatal gift The Devil forced on man in Paradise. Shame! you will cry, to whom pure laziness Is half a sin, and work the gift of God. And yet, to lie full length upon the grass And let the soul and sense take in the sky While the thoughts wander, drifting here and there Aimless as thistle downs, is what you need; Fallow, dear Frank, long, lazy, fallow times The mind must have, even as the richest soil, Else harvest shows at last a meagre crop. But to cease preaching, which I know you hate, And so do I. Now let me answer you: Where am I? Far away from busy towns, From clack of work, and eager, senseless talk, And noise, and what men call Societyâ Deep in the Apennines, in a convent lone Perched on a high and breezy mountain shelf; A silent, serious, solitary place, Where lazy peace and meditation live, And careless let the worrying world go by. Behind it stretches up a noble grove, Where heavy-foliaged chestnuts, rich in shade, Spread their broad-fingered hands of dark, cool green; And spiny burrs, that soon will drop and burst And in their white cells show their ambered fruit. Here many a day, stretched upon some green knoll, Resting my head upon their tortuous roots, I gaze upon the landscape far below, Or watch the busy life of hurrying ants, Or listen to the song of wandering birds, Idle as I am, with no task to do, Or upward gaze into the world of leaves Fretted against the clear blue sky above, Lulled by the infinite hum of insect life That swarms and wheels and quivers in the sun. A noble life indeed! I hear you sneer. Well, each must live his life. You yours, I mine; You noise, toil, wrestling fierce with life delight, Me self surrender unto nature's moods, The silences in which the spirit grows, But I forget,âI'll preach no more. Besides, You'll never understand. Now to go on With my description of this place. Beyond, Still further back, a forest of dark pines Sloping its jagged spears climbs serried up And crowns with feathered edge the mountain's crest; And here, upon a carpet of soft brown When the whim takes me I for miles can walk. 'T is my cathedral, through whose lofty aisles There steals an ever whispering sigh of prayer. These shelter the old convent from the north When in the winter Boreas storms at it, And raging comes with both hands full of hail, Blowing his trumpets. But 't is summer now, And they are peaceful, fragrant solitudes. Now southward turn your eyes, and look below. There sleeps a vast fair valley, veiled in haze, Through which a silvery river winds its way And flashes in the sunshine. Here and there Are little villages and castled heights And columns faint of upward rising smoke, All noiseless as a picture where the world, Toil as it may, from here looks calm and still. At times a distant contadina's song, The lowing of far herds, the bleat of sheep, The bark of dogs, comes softened up to us: Else, all is silent. O'er the valley's verge, Far-off, the mountains rise against the sky, With purple shadows and stray gleams of sun, Quivering with opal tints and shifting lights, Like the pearl lining of an ocean shell, Or the quick hues that haunt the dove's full neck,â A valley dim and beautiful and faint As the ideal dream of Rasselas! We are too high for vineyards, but below, Mingling among the flattened olives' tops That evenly deploy up many a slope, Trained upon canes they corrugate the ground, Or swing from tree to tree their rich festoons And fill their lucent skins with liquid sun. One vineyard on the right, a half-mile down, This convent owns,âfor how all winter long Would our monks live without their own good wine? Trust them for that, they know when wine is good! And trust them too to choose the best of sites For air, health, light, to found their convent on. Near by, a village hangs upon a cliff, Gray as the cliff itself; and from afar Seems like a cluster of quaint natural rocks Shoveled at random down the mountain side. Above, a ruined castle domineers, Where once great lords and ladies lived and laughed, And fought, loved, danced, long centuries ago, That are but dust nowâand their crumbling courts Where once glad voices rang and pageants passed, Are dreary lairs of vermin and of filth Haunted by hooting owls and silent ghosts. The convent in itself is grim and gray, With solid walls that might resist a siege; Its corners buttressed; all its windows small Save one, high arched, to give the chapel light. This chapel seen within is high, white, chill; Each side the altar a cadaverous saint, And over it, behind the candlesticks, A black madonna wearing on her breast A bleeding heart with circling daggers stabbed. But what of all is mostly prized is kept Behind the altar in a gilded chest: A ghastly mummy of its special saint, Fearful to look upon, but, I am told, Endowed with mighty and miraculous powers. There are some twenty monks here, that is all; Each with his cold bare cell that opens out From a long, whitewashed, sounding corridor, Each with its crucifix and colored print. We all dine in the old refectory,â A spacious room,âand while we take our food A brother, mounted in a pulpit thrust From out the wall, monotonously reads The life of some old saint, or homily. The kitchen is superb, vaulted above, While in the centre, raised above the floor, A sort of quaint and columned temple stands, Where one a whole ox easily could roast. How came I here? you 'll askâno matter howâ I am here. I had certain ways and means, That is my secret, which I shall not tell, The monks are friendly. All of them, of course, Narrow of mind and fixed like flints in chalk In matters of religion, doctrine, faith (Almost in fact as obstinate as you). But all are kindly, some of them, indeed, Gay, jolly, joking; some a little grim; Some, but a very few, and first of all The abbot, studious, learned in their way, Though curiously bounded in their thoughts. Well! here I stay with them, and the days passâ So smoothly pass, I almost think at times I will become a monk, and leave the world To rattle on without me as it will. (Oh! I can hear you say âJust like you too.â) We have a sunny garden cloistered round, Where it is pleasant to pace to and fro Beneath the arches, pondering many things. Fixed in its centre is a great round well O'erarched with iron ribs, whose jangling chains Let down its copper buckets to a vast Deep cistern, where a cold and constant stream, Drawn from a wild gorge in the mountain side, With hollow, soothing gurgle ever pours. Around it spreads the garden, more for use Than beauty planted, yet it has its charm. Here are no rare exotics, all the flowers Are common flowers that own a homely name. Sunny nasturtiums, glowing marigolds, Clustered sweet-williams, plots of pansies sweet, Nodding their faces old in gay mob-caps; Cockscombs with flaming crests, and spicy pinks, Larkspurs with adder-tongues, and roses wild That blossom by the wall, where rooted clings A tortuous fig-tree bulging into fruit, Or a chance caper shoots its plumy flowers. Here, too, are all the herbs: sweet marjoram, Sweet basil, thyme, mint, sage, and slender spires Of fragrant lavender, and malva pale; In the square, central plots, round cabbages Squat on the ground, and artichokes sprawl out, And rank potatoes rear their poison blooms, And flower-de-luces, valued by the monks Not for their splendid flowers, but for their roots. Here, too, tall rows of climbing beans and peas Trail from high poles, and hang their swelling pods, And down the central walk, their broad, round disks Fringed with gold leaves, are stately sunflowers ranged. Before the cloisters stand at intervals Great vases filled with orange-trees, that show Through dark green polished leaves their golden fruit, And with their blossoms fill the fragrant air. Here the monks wander idly up and down, Each with his breviary in his hand, Well-thumbed and greasy, its long ribbon mark With pendant medals hanging from its leaves,â Now reading and now gazing blankly round With wandering eyes, and ever moving lips, And crossing of the breast at intervals, As they recite their daily offices. Great heavens! I wish at times I could believe With blind, dull faith like theirs, and cease to think. For, after all, what do we know at last With all our thinking? And what matters it If two and two make four, or five, or six? Life's sphinx-like riddle all have failed to guess, Alike the wisest sage and veriest fool. When the sun burns too hotly, I retreat To the old library, where all is still,â Nay, almost dead,âits shelves piled up with books Gathered so many a century ago, So old, so void of life, they almost seem Coffins of perished thought, and this lone room The cemetery where they lie at rest. Here shimmers in through dimmed and dusty panes A veiled and shadowy light; the silent air Is musty with the smell of folios huge, Quartos and parchments old and rotting wood; So still, so strangely still, is all the place, One scarce would start to see some peaceful ghost Come stealing softly in and fade away. One constant occupant alone there is Besides the ghosts, who from these folios here Finds nourishment,âthe ever-boring worm. Here I have sat how many a quiet hour! Communing with the dead, whose hoarded thoughts And idle dreams and fancies, swift and fine, Have long outlived the brains that nourished them, And, as it were, across the chasm obscure That yawns between us, stretched my spirit forth To wander with them through far paths of thought And silent ways of vanished centuries. These dead books make no noise, and argue not, As once their authors did, perchance, in life, And if they weary you, you turn from them Without excuse, knowing you wound them not. Here you may read, lay down your book, and dream, Sleep if you will, wake, and then doze again, No one objects, and no one interrupts. Mostly the room is empty, though at times A sandaled monk will slowly shuffle in, At times, the rector from the village near Will enter, lift his black tricornered hat, Salute me, gravely take his pinch of snuff, Wipe with his checkered handkerchief his nose, Then roll it up and fold it to a square, And this accomplished seat himself to read. The droning fly that drums against the pane Makes silence almost silenter. Poor fool! Why does he long for air, for light, for heaven? Why do I ask? Are we not all the same? Who is content in life's most spacious room, Nor beats the window opening to the sky? And beats it like the foolish fly, in vain. The good old abbot, studious in his way, Has taken a fancy to me, as I think, And many a talk we have of men, books, things, The prospects of the harvest and the wine, The weather, Dante, the Atlantic vast, That frightens him in thought, the Pope, the king, Colombo, Vashintoni, Nuova Yorck. Here, as I sat one pleasant summer day When the soft air was fragrant with the breath Of the warm earth, and all its happy flowers That through the casement wafted now and then A whiff that made me lay aside my book And set me dreaming of the days of yore, When you and I were young, and life was new, The old abbot entered and broke up my dream, Offered his usual pinch of snuff, and said, âI see these old books interest you much, But what perhaps may interest you more Are our old manuscripts, and palimpsests, And parchments of the past, that ages gone Our fathers stored away. We ought, in truth, To arrange and catalogue them, for who knows What they may be; but the time lacks, time lacks, Life is so short. Well, well! but with God's aid Later perhaps we may,âwho knows, who knows? âHere, look! They 're in this closet. If you like, Search into them and see what you can find. Once we could boast a rare collection here,â Ages ago,âbut in the unlearned times Our brothers used to cut these parchments up As covers for their sermons, and from some Scraped as they could the ancient writing off (For parchment then was dear) to write upon. Sometimes I fearâor so 't is saidâthey spoiled Old manuscripts for which the world would pay Who knows how much? Well, well! what would you have? We are all mortal men, all make mistakes; So patience, patience! Some may still be left,â And then our brothers meant to do no wrong, So we must pardon them. What would you have? Who knows? their sermons may have saved a soul, And one soul saved is worth a world of books.â So saying, from his desk he took a key, Opened the closet door, and smiling said, âWhat a confusion! Really, on my word, We must find time to put some order here, This is disgraceful! (Here he snuffed again.) Brother Anselmo must be told of this, I'll speak to him to-dayâthis is too bad! But there 's the bell, so I must leave you now. You will not come to prayers with us? ah, well! There is the key, take it and rummage there, And close and lock the closet when you 've done.â So saying, he left me. 'T was as he had said, A dire confusion, parchments sewn, unsewn, Some tied together carelessly, some loose, Tumbled and torn, and scattered here and there, All yellow, grim, defiled, and deep in dust. At first I scarcely liked to take them up, So soiled they were, but putting in my hand I pulled one bundle out and beat it well To free it from it worms, and dust, and filth, Then took it to my table, cut the cord, And set myself to see what I had found. 'T was an odd medley of old manuscripts, Quite unrelated, in no order ranged Of author, age, or subject. Some of these Were palimpsests (so called) of Pagan times, That is, old parchments, whence the ancient text Had been effaced so as to serve again For other writings of a later date. Yet, spite of all, the shadowy early texts Still faintly showed, the ink having sunk so deep It could not utterly be washed away. The later texts were mostly homilies, Or monkish sermons void of interest, But black and clear as all the first were dim; Still, when the new were writ between the lines Of the old texts, even these with patient care One could at times decipher; even at times A practiced eye could read them easily. Besides these palimpsests were manuscripts Of yellowed paper, written out first hand,â More modern far, but yet some centuries old. The greater part were rubbish, such as bills, Convent accounts, receipts, and catalogues, With lame and pompous verses interspersed, Writ in dog-Latin, for the festal day Or funeral day of some old abbot dead. As weak in grammar as profuse in praise, Claiming that all the virtues known to man Had, heaven descended, come to crown his life. Here, too, were letters written as 't would seem By learned men, who to this convent's calm, Tired of the world and all its bustling ways, Had come to rest awhile their weary heads, Or far from noise to ponder, study, write. Some of their manuscripts, forgotten, lost, Or thrown away perhaps, being first drafts (Or so, at least, the erasures seemed to show), Were left behind by them, and still preserved. And these that eyes for centuries had not seen I puzzled out, mostly of little worth, Saving as glimpses into human hearts And hopes and fears that time will never change. Of these old palimpsests and manuscripts But few I could decipher, and of these I send you six to serve as specimens. If they amuse you, I can send you more. Ah, had I only had the luck to find Some of those precious writings lost so long, Sought for so long in vain for many an age: The missing books of Tacitus; the songs Of hapless Sappho; of Euripides, Ãschylus, Sophocles, one single act, One single scene of their lost tragedies; One poem wrecked upon the strand of Time That stirred the heart and soul of ancient days; One letter writ by Egypt's wondrous queen To Antony at Rome, or Pericles To fair Aspasia; or one careless sketch By Zeuxis, Phidias, or Apelles drawn, Or, what I covet even more than these, Stern Agrippina's diary and life, Writ by herself, recording all her thoughts, Deeds, passions,âall the doings of old Rome, Swarming around her, rife with scandals, crimes, Joys, struggles, triumphs,âall the portraits sharp Of men and women as they lived, talked, loved,â Not as in History's limbo they appear, Mere names and ghostlike shadows, but alive, Fierce, restless, human,âwhat a book to find! But no such luck was mineâah, no indeed! Yet, let me not complain; such happy luck Hath never fallen yet on mortal man. I should not dare to let the abbot know What I did find, or even let him guess What dangers in those parchments may be hid. Even these I send would shock the good old man,â Or some at least. How could he ever dream His convent closet held such skeletons? NOTE BY THE EDITOR. This extract from a letter of my friend His brother sent me, with the manuscripts. He had glanced through them hurriedly, he said, Took little interest in them, wondered much At such a waste of time, and made me free To use them as I chose. Not being sure Of my own judgment I have thought it best To print them, as on trial, and invoke The public verdict. I think well of them: His brother thinks them worthless,âwhich is right? PARCHMENTS AND PALIMPSESTS. A ROMAN LAWYER IN JERUSALEM. FIRST CENTURY. [The Case of Judas.] Marcus, abiding in Jerusalem, Greeting to Caius, his best friend, in Rome! Salve! these presents will be borne to you By Lucius, who is wearied with this place, Sated with travel, looks upon the East As simply hatefulâblazing, barren, bleak, And longs again to find himself in Rome. After the tumult of its streets, its trains Of slaves and clients, and its villas cool With marble porticoes beside the sea, And friends and banquets,âmore than all, its games,â This life seems blank and flat. He pants to stand In its vast circus all alive with heads And quivering arms and floating robes,âthe air Thrilled by the roaring fremitus of men,â The sunlit awning heaving overhead, Swollen and strained against its corded veins, And flapping out its hem with loud report,â The wild beasts roaring from the pit below,â The wilder crowd responding from above With one long yell that sends the startled blood With thrill and sudden flush into the cheeks,â A hundred trumpets screaming,âthe dull thump Of horses galloping across the sand,â The clang of scabbards, the sharp clash of steel,â Live swords, that whirl a circle of gray fire,â Brass helmets flashing 'neath their streaming hair,â A universal tumult,âthen a hush Worse that the tumultâall eyes straining down To the arena's pitâall lips set closeâ All muscles strained,âand then that sudden yell, Habet!âThat's Rome, says Lucius: so it is! That is, 't is his Rome,â't is not yours and mine. And yet, great Jupiter, here at my side He stands with face alive as if he saw The games he thus describes, and says, âThat's life! Life! life! my friend, and this is simply death! Ah! for my Rome!â I jot his very words Just as he utters them. I hate these games, And Lucius knows it, yet he will go on, And all against my will he stirs my blood; So I suspend my letter for a while. A walk has calmed meâI begin againâ Letting this last page, since it is written, stand. Lucius is going; you will see him soon In our great Forum, there with him will walk, And hear him rail and rave against the East. I stay behind,âfor these bare silences, These hills that in the sunset melt and burn, This proud, stern people, these dead seas and lakes, These somber cedars, this intense still sky, To me o'erwearied with Life's din and strain, Are grateful as the solemn blank of night After the fierce day's irritant excess; Besides, a deep, absorbing interest Detains me here, fills up my mind, and sways My inmost thoughts,âhas got as 't were a gripe Upon my very life, as strange as new. I scarcely know how well to speak of this, Fearing your raillery at best,âat worst Even your contempt; yet, spite of all, I speak. First, do not deem me to have lost my head, Sun-struck, as that man Paulus was at Rome. No, I am sane as ever, and my pulse Beats even, with no fever in my blood. And yet I half incline to think his words, Wild as they were, were not entirely wild. Nay, shall I dare avow it? I half tend, Here in this place, surrounded by these men,â Despite the jeering natural at first, And then the pressure of my life-long thought Trained up against it,âto excuse his faith, And half admit the Christus he thinks God Was, at the least, a most mysterious man. Bear with me if I now avow so much; When next we meet I will expose my mind, But now the subject I must scarcely touch. How many a time, while sauntering up and down The Forum's space, or pausing 'neath the shade Of some grand temple, arch, or portico, Have we discussed some knotty point of law, Some curious case, whose contradicting facts Looked Janus-faced to innocence and guilt. I see you now arresting me, to note With quiet fervor and uplifted hand Some subtle view or fact by me o'erlooked, And urging me, who always strain my point (Being too much, I know, a partisan), To pause, and press not to the issue so, But more apart, with less impetuous zeal, Survey as from an upper floor the facts. I need you now to rein me in, too quick To ride a whim beyond the term of Truth, For her a case comes up to which in vain I seek the clue: you could clear up my mind; But you are absentâso I send these notes. The case is of one Judas, Simon's son, Iscariot calledâa Jewâand one of those Who followed Christus, held by some a god, But deemed by others to have preached and taught A superstition vile, of which one point Was worship of an ass; but this is false! Judas, his follower, all the sect declare, Bought by a bribe of thirty silver coins, Basely betrayed his master unto death. The question is,âDid Judas, doing this, Act from base motives and commit a crime? Or, all things taken carefully in view, Can he be justified in what he did? Here on the spot, surrounded by the men Who acted in the drama, I have sought To study out this strange and tragic case. Many are dead, as Herod, Caiaphas, And also Pilate,âa most worthy man, Under whose rule, but all without his fault, And, as I fancy, all against his will, Christus was crucified. This I regret: His words with me would have the greatest weight; But Lysias still is living, an old man, The chief of the Centurions, whose report Is to be trusted, as he saw and heard, Not once, but many a time and oft, this man. His look and bearing, Lysias thus describes:â âTall, slender, not erect, a little bent; Brows arched and dark; a high-ridged lofty head; Thin temples, veined and delicate; large eyes, Sad, very serious, seeming as it were To look beyond you, and whene'er he spoke Illumined by an inner lamping light,â At times, too, gleaming with a strange wild fire When taunted by the rabble in the streets; A Jewish face, complexion pale but dark; Thin, high-cut nostrils, quivering constantly; Long nose, full lips, hands tapering, full of veins; His movements nervous: as he walked he seemed Scarcely to heed the persons whom he passed, And for the most part gazed upon the ground; Or lifting up his eyes, seemed as it were To look far through you to some world beyond. âAs for his followers, I knew them allâ A strange, mad set, and full of fancies wildâ John, Peter, Jamesâand Judas, best of allâ All seemed to me good men without offense,â A little crazed,âbut who is wholly sane? They went about and cured the sick and halt, And gave away their money to the poor, And all their talk was charity and peace. If Christus thought and said he was a god, 'T was harmless madness, not deserving death. What most aroused the wealthy Rabbis' rage Was that he set the poor against the rich, And cried that rich men all would go to hell, And, worst of all, roundly denounced the priests, With all their rich phylacteries and robes,â Said they were hypocrites who made long prayers, And robbed poor widows and devoured their means, And were at best but whited sepulchres: And this it was that brought him to the Cross. âThose who went with him and believed in him Were mostly dull, uneducated men, Simple and honest, dazed by what he did, And misconceiving every word he said. He led them with him in a spell-bound awe, And all his cures they called miraculous. They followed him like sheep where'er he went, With feelings mixed of wonder, fear, and love. Yes! I suppose they loved him, though they fled Stricken with fear when we arrested him.â âWhat! allâall fled?â I asked. âDid none remain?â âNot one,â he said, âall left him to his fate. Not one dared own he was a follower,â Not Peter surely, he denied him thrice; No one gave witness for him of them all. Stop! When I say not one of them, I mean No one but Judas,âJudas, whom they call The traitor,âwho betrayed him to his death. He rushed into the council-hall and cried, â'T is I have sinnedâChristus is innocent.ââ And here I come to what of all I 've heard Most touched me,âI for this my letter write. Paulus, you know, had only for this man, This Judas, words of scorn and bitter hate. Mark now the different view that Lysias took! When, urged by me, his story thus he told:â âSome say that Judas was a base, vile man, Who sold his master for the meanest bribe; Others again insist he was most right, Giving to justice one who merely sought To overthrow the Church, subvert the law, And on its ruins build himself a throne. I, knowing Judasâand none better knewâ I, caring nought for Christus more than him, But hating lies, the simple truth will tell. No man can say I ever told a lie; I am too old now to begin. Besides, The truth is truth, and let the truth be told. Judas, I say, alone of all the men Who followed Christus, thought that he was God. Some feared him for his power of miracles; Some were attracted by a sort of spell; Some followed him to hear his sweet, clear voice, And gentle speaking, hearing with their ears, And knowing not the sense of what he said; But one alone believed he was the Lord, The true Messiah of the Jews. That one Was Judas,âhe alone of all the crowd. âHe to betray his master for a bribe! He last of all. I say this friend of mine Was brave when all the rest were cowards there. âHis was a noble nature: frank and bold, Almost to rashness bold, yet sensitive, Who took his dreams for firm realities; Who once believing, all in all believed; Rushing at obstacles and scorning risk, Ready to venture all to gain his end; No compromise or subterfuge for him, His act went from his thought straight to the butt. Yet with this ardent and impatient mood Was joined a visionary mind that took Impressions quick and fine, yet deep as life. Therefore it was that in this subtle soil The master's words took root and grew and flowered. He heard, and followed, and obeyed; his faith Was serious, earnest, realâwinged to fly; He doubted not, like some who walked with him; Desired no first place, as did James and John; Denied him not with Peter: not to him His master said, âAway! thou 'rt an offense; Get thee behind me, Satan!âânot to him, âAm I so long with ye who know me not?â Fixed as a rock, untempted by desires To gain the post of honor when his Lord Should come to ruleâchosen from out the midst Of sixscore men as his apostleâthen Again selected to the place of trust, Unselfish, honest, he among them walked. âThat he was honest, and was so esteemed, Is plain from this,âthey chose him out of all To bear the common purse, and take and pay. John says he was a thief, because he grudged The price that for some ointment once was paid, And urged 't were better given to the poor. But did not Christus ever for the poor Lift up his voice,ââGive all things to the poor; Sell everything and give all to the poor!â And Judas, who believed, not made believe, Used his own words, and Christus, who excused The gift because of love, rebuked him not. I, for my part, see nothing wrong in this. Did he alone of Christus' followers Condemn this gift? ah, no! by all of them It was condemned, all cried indignantly âWhy is this waste?â not Judas more than they. âThief! thief indeed! If Christus was a God Or even a Prophet, or, far less, a man, Endowed with common judgment, insight, mind, He must have known and seen what Judas was, With whom he lived in constant fellowship; And yet he chose him out of all of them To bear the purse and give alms to the poor!â He chose a thief, and none remonstrated, Not even John, for all he now may say.â âBut why, if Judas was a man like this, Frank, noble, honest,ââhere I interposed,â âWhy was it that he thus betrayed his Lord?â âThis question oft did I revolve,â said he, âWhen all the facts were fresh, and oft revolved In later days, and with no change of mind; And this is my solution of the case:â âDaily he heard his master's voice proclaim, âI am the Lord! the Father lives in me! Who knoweth me knows the Eternal God! He who believes in me shall never die! No! he shall see me with my angels come With power and glory here upon the earth To judge the quick and dead! Among you here Some shall not taste of death before I come God's kingdom to establish on the earth!â âWhat meant these words? They seethed in Judas' soul. âHere is my GodâMessias, King of kings, Christus, the Lordâthe Saviour of us all. How long shall he be taunted and reviled, And threatened by this crawling scum of men? Oh, who shall urge the coming of that day When he in majesty shall clothe himself And stand before the astounded world its King?â Long brooding over this inflamed his soul; And, ever rash in schemes as wild in thought, At last he said, âNo longer will I bear This ignominy heaped upon my Lord. No man hath power to harm the Almighty One. Ay, let man's hand be lifted, then, at once, Effulgent like the sun, swift like the sword, The jagged lightning flashes from the cloud, Shall he be manifestâthe living Godâ And prostrate all shall on the earth adore!ââ âThis is a strange solution,â here I cried. âFind you a better, if you can,â said he. âI cannot. Taking all the facts in view, Or rather the reports, the truth of which I cannot vouch,âbut, taking them as facts, I see no other. Strange to you and me Of course it seems, but not so strange to one Like Judas with a mind ideal half, Enthusiastic, visionary, quick To set ablaze, and yet half positive, Fixed, practical, and ever prone to force Mere dreams into the world of acts and facts. âOthers might think the words that Christus used Were vague and wild: to Judas they seemed plain. Christus was God, not man, and being such Must of necessity desire the hour When man should end, and God should be revealed. Judas was sure he had divined this wish, Sure that his own thought Christus had divined, And sure as Christus said, the hour had come. âThis is, at least, the only key I know That fits the wards of this mysterious case.â Here let me interrupt this narrative With comments of my own, and words, acts, facts, Unknown to Lysias, testified by those Who knew, loved, followed Christus, and, 't would seem, Thought him a sort of God. From their reports I take the facts they state, the words they use, Striving to find through this entangled maze, The simple clue of truth, no more, no less. âDivined his thought,â says Lysias. Was his thought So hidden that a sympathetic heart Could not at once divine it? If to some, Wanting the sense to apprehend, his words Seemed riddles hard to guess, to me at least The wonder seems that any could mistake, So clearly, with such iterance, they were said. âDivined his thought.â What was there to divine? What else could mean those sayings strange and strong, So oft repeated? What for instance this? âI to Jerusalem must go, and there Be taken, suffer, and be slain, and then I shall arise triumphant over all. Then you shall see in glory and in power The son with all his Father's angels come.â And then it was, when Peter, answering back, Rebuked him saying, âBe it far from thee, This shall not be unto thee,â he, half vexed To be thus thwarted in his wish, cried out, âGet thee behind me, Satan, thou to me Art an offense.â And so again he said: âI lay my life down, no man taketh it Away from me. I lay it down myself, As I have power to take it up again; And I will lift up all the earth to me.â And yet again: âI go my way, but where You cannot follow,ââand at this his friends Whispered, âWhat means this? Will he kill himself?â 'T is plain at last this one thought haunted him. He longed for sacrifice, as all such souls, Exalted, fired with high ideal thoughts, Long for their martyrdom and cannot rest Till by their death they consecrate their faith. Them the fire burns not, them the wild beasts' fangs Are powerless to torment,âthe torturing rack, The red-hot pincers break and rend in vain. The spirit overpowers and scorns the flesh, And pain is but the promise of reward. Weary of teaching where none understood, Tired of life and all its mean mad strife, Eager he longed to greet the end of all. âI have a baptism and must be baptized Thereunto, and am straitened till 't is done.â Thus cried he, and his words seem plain enough, So plain indeed that some among them deemed He meant to take his life. Some, to avert His purpose, strove like Peter, and in vain. And of the common crowd of followers Many abandoned him as one half mad. But not to press this further and repeat His many other sayings strange and wild, Let these suffice! You will perceive how strong They bear upon the matter to explain The sad mistake of Judas,âif indeed He did mistake,âor show he but obeyed The will of Christus and direct command. You, who have seen how glad some victims go To meet their death,âay, greet and covet it,â Will see that Christus, being, let us say, Inspired,âall men with high and noble thoughts Are what we call inspired,âa prophet tooâ Almost a Godâso deemed at least by some, Even by himself, 't would seem,âlifted at least Above the herd of ignorant wicked men In all his hopes and aims, misunderstood Even by his friends, pursued by enemies, Should weary of the heavy task his God Had laid on him and long to consecrate By sacrifice his life, and end it all. Upon his spirit, in his later years, A change had come. The teaching sweet and calm, The universal love for all mankind, Which in his early years was all in all, Had given way to other thoughts and hopes. No more the simple teacher as of yore, Now, though at times he said he was mere man, At other times he claimed to be a God. The son of God, Messiah of the Jews, The coming one to whom all power was given To judge the quick and dead, who, of himself, In three days' space could hurl their temple down, And build it up,âmere madness as it seemed To those who heard and laughed and pitied him. This overcast his spirit, and at times His words were bitter (as when he denounced The Pharisees and priests), at times his acts (As when he drove from forth the Temple's gates The changers, crying they had made God's house A den of thieves). Through all these later days A spirit ruled him different from the old. Whether he thought, in truth, that he was God, And Death, or what to others seemed the end, Was but the door through which from human life He to a life divine should pass, and man So become God and back to earth return Triumphant, glorious, with angelic hosts,â Or whether Death he deemed would quail and crouch, And powerless at his presence drop its sword And justify his claim to all the world,â Whatever were his thoughts, he longed to try The sharp conclusion, once for all, and prove He was Messiah, God, the King of all. I hazard this. It may be so, at least This way his words would clearly seem to point. If so, then Judas may have shared his thoughts; If not so, ample ground there surely was For misconception without thought of wrong. So much for this; what followed let us see. The records are not clear, but still enough To show the way to truth, for one at least Trained as you are to balance evidence. One thing is amply proved: that he alone, When safe beyond the reach of enemies, Ordained this journey to Jerusalem, Alone decreed the time, place, circumstance, Against his followers' wish when they should meet. Why did he go, unless to brave his foes, To court betrayal, and to seek his death? But be this as it may, thither he went; There in the house appointed met his friends; There, knowing he was sought for by his foes, Sat down with Judas and the rest to sup. And as they supped, he said, âAmong you here Is one that shall betray me.â At these words Did all start up amazed, indignant, each With horror struck, protesting, crying out. Each questioning each? ah, no! each simply said, âLord is it I? Lord is it I?â Yes, all! Ay! every one of them cried, âIs it I?â And he: âThe one who dippeth in his sop With mine into the dish, he is the one That shall betray me.â Judas in the dish Then dipped his sopâor Christus gave it him, And said âNow go! and what thou hast to do Do quickly;â and then Judas rose and went. But ere he rose and left them Christus said, âNow shall the Son of man be glorified!â Strange words, that Judas well might think to mean His master should be glorified through him. Here let us pause and look these simple facts Full in the face. Either the act itself Which Judas was to do was infamous, Or simply right and justified by all. Setting aside all question of mistake, Which was it, that's the question, right or wrong? What was betrayal? merely pointing out The person of their leader, at such time, Such place as he commanded; and what need Even of this? He did not hide himself, He was well known, he daily walked abroad Attended by his followers, preached to crowds, Healed those who sought his healing, openly, Roundly denounced the scribes and Pharisees, Avowed his doctrines and proclaimed his faith. What need of Judas or of any one To point him out, betray him as 't is called? All knew him and could take him when they pleased. Betray indeed! what was there to betray? 'T was but the after tragedy alone That threw a backward, lurid light on it And made this act of Judas seem so vile. Suppose the act was infamous, or, at least, So deemed by any one among the twelve, Is it not clear that none of them had cried âLord is it I?â What! every one of them Imagined he might be the traitor meant And do the very act that now the world Brands as accursÃ«d. No, impossible! Else they were traitors every one of them, Traitors in will and thought, if not in deed. Plainly the act that Judas had to do, Call it by any ugly name you will (Names do not alter acts), to none of them Seemed base, wrong, infamous as now 't is held, Or all alike were base, vile, infamous,â Not Judas only, but the whole of them. Suppose, again, they all were honest men, Devoted to their leader heart and soul, And Judas only vile; that they were shocked At thought of such betrayal, how explain Their questioning, âIs it I?â and how explain Their after silence, with no word to him Of stern remonstrance, friendly counsel, prayers To stay his purpose; failing these, no hand Lifted to hold him, stop him by main force? Not only they did naught by word or act, But Christus' self cried, âWhat thou hast to do, Go and do quickly;â laying as it were Commands upon him thus to go and act. What! Christus urged him on, or let him go To consummate an act of infamy Without one warning word to hold him back? It cannot be. This clearly seems to prove He acted by command. He undertook A duty laid upon him, no vile thought Or wish impelling,âelse had Christus sought To save him, turn his mind away from crime, Remonstrate with him, and not urge him on To his destruction, as it seems he did. Suppose, again, a band of men conjoined For noble purposes and aims like these, Or even a band of foul conspirators, With murder in their minds, or what you will. And suddenly their leader points them out A traitor sitting with them. âThere is he Who will betray me.â Would not all at once Rise and cry out, remonstrate, threaten, pray, Seek every means to break his purpose down, And all these failing, with compelling strength Seize him and bind him, force him to renounce His plotted crime; ay, more, when all else failed Slay him and save their leader by his death? And he, the traitor, would not he cry out, Protest, deny, declare, even though in fact Traitor he meant to be, his innocence? Ay! they were men of peace, preached love, I know, Forgiveness; and to raise a stave, a sword, Was in their estimation wrong. Why, then, Went they out armed? Two swords at least they had, And, later, Peter drew his sword and smote The high priest's servant and cut off his ear. He wore a sword, at least, and he could strike When the occasion called,âthis did not call. They did not understand? a poor excuse! The words were plain, and Judas understood. How? why? he any more than they? 'T would seem that every one among them there Knew the intent of Christus, must have known From all he said before, as well as then. And, knowing it, approved it, or at least, Did not oppose it, but let Judas go. They grieved, indeed! Why did they grieve? at what? The act of Judas, or their Lord's resolve? One moment more, when Judas had gone out, Christus remained with all the rest, and then, What said he to them? Did he once reprove This contemplated crime of Judas? No! Them he reproved, and said, âIf me you loved You would rejoice, because I said I go Unto the Father. 'T is expedient, too, That I should go away, for otherwise The Comforter will never come to you, And he will glorify me when he comes.â And more he said, and every word implied That death he courted, with determined mind. Then they set forth to their accustomed place Beyond the brook of Cedron, as agreed, Decided, fixed upon, as Judas knew. Had Christus then desired to avert his fate, What easier? He had simply not to go To the appointed spot. No one could force His steps to take that path. But his own will Was fixed; there he would go and only there; Once only his high spirit seemed to fail, When, at Gethsemane, he prayed the cup Might pass away from him; then strong again He onward went with firm, unfaltering step. Here I commence the narrative again, So interrupted, and perhaps too long. Still, all this weighs so strongly on the case I could not pass it over. And besides This, Lysias did not know, or scarcely knew, And then by vague report.âNow to resume. âJudas,â says Lysias, âwhen the rest he left, Came straight to where I was with the high priests, Not as a coward, stealing in to do A dastard act, but with an open face, And clear, bold voice, and said, âBehold me here, Judas, a follower of Christus! Come! I will point out my master whom you seek!â And out at once they sent me with my band; And as we went, I said, rebuking him, âHow, Judas, is it you who thus betray The lord and master whom you love, to death?â And, smiling, then he answered, âFear you not; Do you your duty; take no heed of me.â âIs not this vile?â I said; âI had not deemed Such baseness in you.â âThough it seem so now,â Still smiling, he replied, âwait till the end.â Then turning round, as to himself he said, âNow comes the hour that I have prayed to see,â The hour of joy to all who know the truth.â ââIs this man mad?â I thought, and looked at him; And, in the darkness creeping swiftly on, His face was glowing, almost shone, with light; And rapt as if in visionary thought He walked beside me, gazing at the sky. âPassing at last beyond the Cedron brook, We reached a garden, on whose open gate Dark vines were loosely swinging. Here we paused, And lifted up our torches, and behold Against the blank white wall a shadowy group, There waiting motionless, without a word: A moment, and with rapid, nervous step, Judas alone advanced, and as he reached The tallest figure, lifted quick his head; And crying, âMaster! Master!â kissed his cheek. We, knowing it was Christus, forward pressed. Malchus was at my side, when suddenly A sword flashed out from one among them there, And sheared his ear. At once our swords flashed out, But Christus, lifting up his hand, said, âPeace, Sheathe thy sword, PeterâI must drink the cup.â And I cried also, âPeace, and sheathe your swords.â Then on his arm I placed my hand, and said, âIn the law's name.â At this he turned and stood A moment, mute, and then stretched forth his arms Saying as if to justify himself, And show that Judas understood him right, âThink'st thou, if I my Father now beseech, Even now, he will not send to aid me more Than legions twelve of angels? But, if so, How should the Scriptures be fulfilled? I taught Daily within the temple to you all, And yet you took me not! This is your hour. The cup my father gives me I must drink.â âWe took him then and bound his hands with cords, He offering no resistance to our will. This done, I turned, but all the rest had fled, And he alone was left to meet his fate. âMy men I ordered then to take and bear Their prisoner to the city; and at once They moved away. I, seeing not our guide, Cried, âJudas!ââbut no answer; then a groan So sad and deep it startled me. I turned, And there, against the wall, with ghastly face, And eyeballs starting in a frenzied glare, As in a fit, lay Judas; his weak arms Hung lifeless down, his mouth half open twitched. His hands were clutched and clenched into his robes, And now and then his breast heaved with a gasp. Frightened, I dashed some water in his face, Spoke to him, lifted him, and rubbed his hands. At last the sense came back into his eyes, Then with a sudden spasm fled again, And to the ground he dropped. I searched him o'er, Fearing some mortal wound, yet none I found. Then with a gasp again the life returned, And stayed, but still with strong convulsion twitched. âSpeak, Judas! speak!â I cried. âWhat does this mean?â No answer! âSpeak, man!â Then at last he groaned: âGo, leave me! leave me, Lysias. O my God! What have I done? O Christus! Master, Lord, Forgive me, oh, forgive me!â Then a cry Of agony that pierced me to the heart, As groveling on the ground he turned away And hid his face, and shuddered, in his robes. Was this the man whose face an hour ago Shone with a joy so strange? What means it all? Is this a sudden madness? âSpeak!â I cried. âWhat means this, Judas? Be a man and speak!â Yet there he lay, and neither moved nor spoke. I thought that he had fainted, till at last Sudden he turned and grasped my arm, and cried, âSay, Lysias, is this true, or am I mad?â âWhat true?â I said. âTrue that you seized the Lord! You could not seize himâhe is God the Lord! I thought I saw you seize him. Yet I know That was impossible, for he is God! And yet you liveâyou live. He spared you, then. Where am I? What has happened? A black cloud Came o'er me when you laid your hands on him. Where are they all? Where is he? Lysias, speak!â ââJudas,â I said, âwhat folly is all this? Christus my men have bound and borne away; The rest have fled. Rouse now and come with me! My men await me, rouse yourself, and come!â âThrowing his arms up, in a fit he fell, With a loud shriek that pierced the silent night. I could not stay, but, calling instant aid, We bore him quick to the adjacent house, And placing him in kindly charge, I left, Joining my men who stayed for me below. âStraight to the high priest's house we hurried on, And Christus in an inner room we placed, Set at his door a guard, and then came out. After a time there crept into the hall, Where round the blazing coals we sat, a man, Who in the corner crouched. âWhat man are you?â Cried some one; and I, turning, looked at him. 'T was Peter. â'T is a fellow of that band That followed Christus, and believed in him.â â'T is false!â cried Peter; and he cursed and swore, âI know him notâI never saw the man.â But I said nothing. Soon he went away. âThat night I saw not Judas. The next day, Ghastly, clay-white, a shadow of a man, With robes all soiled and torn, and tangled beard, Into the chamber where the council sat Came feebly staggering: scarce should I have known 'T was Judas, with that haggard, blasted face; So had that night's great horror altered him. As one all blindly walking in a dream He to the table cameâagainst it leanedâ Glared wildly round awhile;âthen stretching forth From his torn robes a trembling hand, flung down, As 't were a snake that stung him, a small purse, That broke and scattered its white coins about, And, with a shrill voice, cried, âTake back the purse! 'T was not for that foul dross I did the deedâ 'T was not for thatâoh, horror! not for that! But that I did believe he was the Lord; And that he is the Lord I still believe. But oh, the sin!âthe sin! I have betrayed The innocent blood, and I am lost!âam lost!â So crying, round his face his robes he threw, And blindly rushed away; and we, aghast, Looked round,âand no one for a moment spoke. âSeeing that face, I could but fear the end; For death was in it, looking through his eyes. Nor could I follow to arrest the fate That drove him madly on with scorpion whip. âAt last the duty of the day was done, And night came on. Forth from the gates I went, Anxious, and pained by many a dubious thought, To seek for Judas, and to comfort him. The sky was dark with heavy, lowering clouds; A lifeless, stifling air weighed on the world; A dreadful silence like a nightmare lay Crouched on its bosom, waiting, grim and gray, In horrible suspense of some dread thing. A creeping sense of death, a sickening smell, Infected the dull breathing of the wind. A thrill of ghosts went by me now and then, And made my flesh creep as I wandered on. At last I came to where a cedar stretched Its black arms out beneath a dusky rock, And, passing through its shadow, all at once I started; for against the dubious light A dark and heavy mass, that to and fro Swung slowly with its weight, before me grew. A sick, dread sense came over me; I stoppedâ I could not stir. A cold and clammy sweat Oozed out all over me; and all my limbs, Bending with tremulous weakness like a child's, Gave way beneath me. Then a sense of shame Aroused me. I advanced, stretched forth my hand, And pushed the shapeless mass; and at my touch It yielding swung, the branch above it creaked, And back returning struck against my face. A human body! Was it dead, or not? Swiftly my sword I drew and cut it down, And on the sand all heavily it dropped. I plucked the robes away, exposed the faceâ 'T was Judas, as I feared, cold, stiff, and dead: That suffering heart of his had ceased to beat.â Thus Lysias spoke, and ended. I confess This story of poor Judas touched me much. What horrible revulsions must have passed Across that spirit in those few last hours! What storms, that tore up life even to its roots! Say what you willâgrant all the guiltâand still What pangs of dread remorseâwhat agonies Of desperate repentance, all too late, In that wild interval between the crime And its last sad atonement!âlife, the while, Laden with horror all too great to bear, And pressing madly on to death's abyss: This was no common mind that thus could feelâ No vulgar villain sinning for reward! Was he a villain lost to sense of shame? Ay, so say John and Peter and the rest; And yetâand yet this tale that Lysias tells Weighs with me more the more I ponder it; For thus I put it: Either Judas was, As John affirms, a villain and a thief, A creature lost to shame and base at heart; Or else, which is the view that Lysias takes, He was a rash and visionary man, Whose faith was firm, who had no thought of crime, But whom a terrible mistake drove mad. Take but John's view, and all to me is blind. Call him a villain who, with greed of gain, For thirty silver pieces sold his Lord. Does not the bribe seem all too small and mean? He held the common purse, and, were he thief, Had daily power to steal, and lay aside A secret and accumulating fund; So doing, he had nothing risked of fame, While here he braved the scorn of all the world. Besides, why chose they for their almoner A man so lost to shame, so foul with greed? Or why, from some five-score of trusted men, Choose him as one apostle among twelve? Or why, if he were known to be so vile, (And who can hide his baseness at all times?) Keep him in close communion to the last? Naught in his previous life, or acts, or words, Shows this consummate villain that, full-grown, Leaps all at once to such a height of crime. Again, how comes it that this wretch, whose heart Is cased to shame, flings back the paltry bribe? And, when he knows his master is condemned, Rushes in horror out to seek his death? Whose fingers pointed at him in the crowd? Did all men flee his presence till he found Life too intolerable? Nay; not so! Death came too close upon the heels of crime. He had but done what all his tribe deemed just: All the great massâI mean the upper classâ The Rabbis, all the Pharisees and Priestsâ Ay, and the lower mob as well, who cried, âGive us Barabbas! Christus to the cross!â These men were all of them on Judas' side, And Judas had done naught against the law. Were he this villain, he had but to say, âI followed Christus till I found at last He aimed at power to overthrow the State. I did the duty of an honest man. I traitor!âyou are traitors who reprove.â Besides, such villains scorn the world's reproof. Or he might say: âYou call this act a crime? What crime was it to say I know this man? I said no ill of him. If crime there be, 'T was yours who doomed him unto death, not mine.â A villain was he? So Barabbas was! But did Barabbas go and hang himself, Weary of life,âthe murderer and thief? This coarse and vulgar way will never do. Grant him a villain, all his acts must be Acts of a villain; if you once admit Remorse so bitter that it leads to death, And death so instant on the heels of crime, You grant a spirit sensitive to shame,â So sensitive that life can yield no joys To counterbalance one bad act; but then A nature such as this, though led astray When greatly tempted, is no thorough wretch. Was the temptation great? Could such a bribe Tempt such a nature to a crime like this? I say, to me it simply seems absurd. Peter at least was not so sensitive. He cursed and swore, denying that he knew Who the man Christus was; but after all He only weptâhe never hanged himself. But take the other view that Lysias takes, All is at once consistent, clear, complete. Firm in the faith that Christus was his God, The great Messiah sent to save the world, He, seeking for a sign,ânot for himself, But to show proof to all that he was God,â Conceived this plan, rash if you will, but grand. âThinking him man,â he said, âmere mortal man, They seek to seize him. I will make pretense To take the public bribe and point him out, And they shall go, all armed with swords and staves, Strong with the power of law, to seize on him,â And at their touch he, God himself, shall stand Revealed before them, and their swords shall drop, And prostrate all before him shall adore, And cry, âBehold the Lord and King of all!ââ But when the soldiers laid their hands on him, And bound him as they would a prisoner vile, With taunts, and mockery, and threats of deathâ He all the while submittingâthen his dream Burst into fragments with a crash; aghast The whole world reeled before him; the dread truth Swooped like a sea upon him, bearing down His thoughts in wild confusion. He who dreamed To unbar the gates of glory to his Lord, Oped in their stead the prison's jarring door, And saw above him his dim dream of Love Change to a Fury stained with blood and crime. And then a madness seized him, and remorse With pangs of torture drove him down to death. Conceive with me that sad and suffering heart, If this be true that Lysias saysâConceive! Alas! Orestes, not so sad thy fate, For thee Apollo pardoned, purified,â Thy Furies were appeased, thy peace returned; But Judas perished, tortured unto death, Unpardoned, unappeased, unpurified. And long as Christus shall be known of men His name shall bear the brand of infamy, The curse of generations still unborn. Thus much of him: I leave the question here, Touching on naught beyond, for Lucius waits; I hear him fuming in the courts below, Cursing his servants and Jerusalem, And giving them to the infernal gods. The sun is sinkingâall the sky 's afireâ And vale and mountain glow like molten ore In the intense full splendor of its rays. A half-hour hence all will be dull and gray; And Lucius only waits until the shade Sweeps down the plain, then mounts and makes his way On through the blinding desert to the sea, And thence his galley bears him on to Rome. Salve et vale!âmay good fortune wait On you and all your household! Greet for me Titus and Liviaâin a word, all friends. A JEWISH RABBI IN ROME. WITH A COMMENTARY BY BEN ISRAEL. [Fifteenth Century. Reign of Sixtus IV.] Rabbi Ben Esdra to his dearest friend, Rabbi Ben Israel, greetingâMay the Lord Keep thee in safety! I am still in Rome, And, after months of silence, now redeem My pledge to tell you how this Christian world (Which here I came to study), nearly viewed, Strikes me, a Jew born, and with steady faith In all the Law and Prophets of our land. Still, though a Jew, it is the Truth I seek,â Only the Truth,âand, come from whence it will, I greet it with bent head and reverent heart. I am a seeker;âthough my faith is firm, I will not tie my mind in knots of creeds. No more preamble. I am now in Rome, Where our Jehovah rules not,âbut the man Jesus, whose Life and Fate too well we know, Is made a Godâthe cross on which he died A reverend symbol, and his words the law. His words, what were they? Love, good-will to man. His kingdom? Peace. His precepts? Poverty. Well, are they followed? That's the question now. What fruit have they produced? One moment, first. I think no ill of him. He was sincere, Lofty of thought, a pure idealist, Possessed, indeed, by visionary dreams, But wishing ill to no one, least of all To us, and to our Faith, which was his own. I will not say he was entirely wrong In the strong censures that he laid on us; For we had many faultsâwere, as he said, Only too much like whited sepulchres,â And then, no good man is entirely wrong, And none entirely right. The truth is vast, And never was there Creed embraced it all. Like all enthusiasts he beheld his half, Deemed it the whole, and with excess of zeal Pushed his ideal truth beyond the stretch Of human practice. Most of what he taught The wise and good of old had said before. His healing skill, this sect calls miracles, A hundred others had as well as he; And for that claim his followers set up, And he, perhaps (though here there is much doubt), Asserted of himself, that he was sent Messias, King of kings, to save the world,â This, surely, was no crime deserving death: No mere opinions, void of acts, are crimes. Besides, what sect or creed was ever crushed By cruelty? Our error was perverse, Willful, unwise. Had we but spared his life, He would have passed away as others pass,â Simon and John and Apollonius, Judas of Galilee, and many more. But, no! we lifted him above the rest; Made him conspicuous by his martyrdom; Watered with blood his doctrines; fired the hearts Of those who loved him with intemperate zeal And wild imaginations, till at last They thought they saw him risen from the dead. Our folly (call it by its lightest name) Nourished the seed into this mighty sect, That takes his name and worships him as God. Setting aside the superstitious part, I ask, What were the doctrines that he preached, And that his followers with their lips profess? Love! Peace! Good-will to man! This was the gist Of all he taught. Forgive your enemies! Seek for the lost sheep from the fold that stray! Harm no one! For the prodigal returned Kill the fat calf! Be merciful to all! Who are the enemies, prodigals, lost sheep, To whom these Christians give love, mercy, care? Not we, the Jews, in truth. Is it for us They kill the calf? Are we the enemies That they forgive? Have they good-will for us? Not they! They hold us rather like foul swine,â Abuse us,âlay great burdens on our backs,â Spit on us,âdrive us forth beyond their walls,â Force us all slavish offices to do,â And if we join their sect, scorn us the more. If those are blessÃ«d, as he says, whom men Revile and persecute, most blest are we! Yet was not Jesus, first of all, a Jew,â Even to his death a Jew? Did he renounce His strict faith in the Prophets and the Law? Never! âI come not to destroy,â he said, âThe Law or Prophets, only to fulfill.â So, too, his preaching, whatsoe'er it was, Was to the Jews. The miracles he wrought Were for the Jews alone. âI am not sentââ These are his wordsââbut unto the lost sheep Of Israel's house: my bread is not for dogs.â Who were the dogs to whom he thus refused To lend his healing hand? What had she done Who asked his service that he scorned her thus? She was from Canaan, or a Greekâno Jew; This was her crime. 'T is true that, touched at last By those sad, humble words of hers, âThe dogs May eat the crumbs dropped from the master's board,â He made her an exception to his rule,â But still his rule was this. This his first rule. No? But it was! Remember the rich youth Who prayed to be his follower: âTwo things,â He said, âare needful.â First, that you obey The Law and Prophetsâthat is, are a Jew;â And then the second, that your wealth and goods You sell, and give the proceeds to the poor. First be a Jew, then poor. Renounce all wealth; Keep nothing back. These are conditions prime, Refusing which, your following I reject. I see you gravely shake your head at this; But read the records,âyou will see I'm right. Jesus, let me repeat it yet again, Was first and last a Jew; never renounced This faith of ours; taught in the Synagogue; Quoted the Prophets; reaffirmed the Law; Worked with the Jews, and only healed the Jews, And held all other nations but as dogs. (Commentary by Ben Israel.) I 've read the records carefully again: It goes against my willâstill, I admit, Ben Esdra may be right. Here let me note One case that he perchance has overlookedâ That of the Publican named Zaccheus. This man was rich, and, curious, sought to look On Jesus,âfor this purpose climbed a tree. Jesus, perceiving him, proposed himself To be his guest; at which a murmuring went Among his followers,âfor this wealthy man Was, as they said, a sinner, or no Jew. But I note this, that Zaccheus on the spot Surrendered half his goods unto the poor Ere Jesus went into his house; and then, And not till then, said Jesus,ââOn this house This day salvation cometh, forasmuch As he, too, is a son of Abraham,ââ That is, a Jew. Again, where did he send His twelve disciples (Judas 'mid the rest) To preach the Gospel? To the Gentiles? No! This he forbade,âbut âunto the lost sheep Of Israel's house.â And one case more I note,â That of the woman of Samaria, To whom he said (his followers murmuring That he should speak to her): âSalvation comes But to the Jews.â Doubtless, as well we know, It was unlawful for a Jew to eat And bide with those who were uncircumcised. Upon this point, long after he was dead, Extreme contention 'mid his followers rose, If Gentiles, ere they had been circumcised, Into the Christian faith could be baptized,â Some holding full adherence to the law A prime condition,âsome, that it sufficed If its main principles were recognized: But this I merely note. It seems quite clear That only Jews at first could join the sect. And second (mark this well, and ponder it), He was a Communistâdenied the right Of private wealth; ordained a common purse To be administered for all alike, And all rejected who refused him this. â'T is easier for a camel to pass through A needle's eye,ââthese are his very words,â âThan that a rich man should inherit heaven.â A rich man, mind you, whether good or bad. What was the moral of his parable Of Lazarus and Dives? What offense Did Dives, that in everlasting fire He was condemned to suffer? What good deed Did Lazarus, that he at last should lie On Abraham's bosom in eternal bliss? Nothing! The beggar, Lazarus, was poor; Dives was rich. This was the crime of one, The virtue of the other. Not one hint Of any other reason for the hell Or heaven that he adjudged themânot one word That Dives was not charitable, kind, Generous, a helper of his brother man;â No accusation, save that he was rich. No word that Lazarus, with all his sores, Possessed ONE virtue, save that he was poor. Nay, more: when Dives in his torment sued For mercy, what did Abraham say to him? You for your evil deeds must suffer now? No! but, âYou had the good things on the earth, Lazarus the evil. Therefore, now, to thee Is torment givenâcomfort unto him.â Working to pile up wealth Jesus abhorred. âEach man for all,â he said, âand all for each. Take no thought of to-morrowâfor the day Sufficient will be given. No sparrow falls Save through God's law. The ravens of the air Sow not and reap not, yet God feedeth them. The lilies of the field nor toil nor spin, Yet Solomon was not arrayed like them. Why, then, take thought of raiment and of food? Leave all to God. BlessÃ«d are ye, the poor! God's kingdom shall be yours: but ye, the rich, Woe unto you.â This was his life and text. Once onlyâso the record goesâa rage Seized upon Jesus, when, with whip and thong, The money-changersâall who bought and soldâ He from the precincts of the Temple drove, Saying, â'T is writ, This is the house of prayer, But ye have made it to a den of thieves.â Let this show what he thought of such as these. Those who were with him knew and did his will,â Lived in community of goods, renounced All private wealth. This doctrine, too, they preached After his death; and all who joined their sect Sold their possessions, houses, treasures, lands, And paid the price into the common store, To be administered to each one's need. They did not seek by subterfuge and trick To cling to Mammon while they worshiped God. Here I, Ben Israel, note the curious case Of Ananias and Sapphira, struck By sudden death, because of all their wealth They kept a part back for their private useâ Tempting by this the Lord, as Peter said. But where are the Almighty's lightnings now? What should a Christian do, then, who accepts The doctrines that this master, nay, this God (For so they call him), clearly thus appoints;â Live by them, should he not? Not by blank words Affirm them, but by all his acts and life. First, love to Godâand love to man as well. Then, peace, forgiveness, kindness, poverty. What is the Christian practice? Warâthe sword As arbiter of all disputes of menâ Reprisals,âpersecutions unto death For all who differ from themâPeter's sword That Jesus bade him sheathe,âno simple lives Of frugal fare and pure beneficence, But luxury and imperious tyranny In all high places,âall in earnest strife To pile up wealth for selfish purposes,â Each greedy for himself, the wretched poor Down-trodden, trampled on,âthe Church itself, Splendid with pageant, cruel in its power,â Pride rampant, hissing through a thousand maws,â Power, like a ravening wolf among the lambs, Worrying the weakest,âprayers, lip-deep, no moreâ The devil's work done in the name of God. Such is the spectacle I see in Rome. Among the pomps in which this Christian Church Invests its pageants, oft I think of him Whom they pretend to worship, and his words Come back to me with which he once reproved Our priests of his own days. The world, indeed, Has but one pattern for its worldliness,â Or now, or then, 't is evermore the same. If we of old were stiff-necked in our pride, Desiring power instead of godliness, Avid of pomp,âthese Christians are the same: They will not follow either God or Christ. âThus saith the Lord, Stand in the ways, and see; Ask, where is the good way, and walk therein, And so ye shall find rest unto your souls. But they replied, We will not walk therein.â Thus Jeremiah,âJesus much the same. Long prayers, low bowings in the market-place, Chief seats in synagogues, upper rooms at feasts, Fine linen, costly dresses, pompous rites, Grand ceremonials, purple trailing robes, Embroidered hems, and wide phylacteries,â All this he scorned. Well, still we see the same, For all his scorn, among his followers. His very words describe these cardinals As they were made for them alone,ânot us. Not we alone were whited sepulchres; Robbed widows, orphans, every one for greed: This Church still robs them, wears its purple robes, Prays at the public corners of the streets, Nor even the outside of the platter cleans. And what thinks Jesus of it?âif, indeed, He from beyond can look into their hearts, Who call upon his name and preach of Peace. Foul hypocrites, who feed their hungry flocks With husks of dogmas and dead chaff of talk, And trample virtue down into the mire. I ask myself, Do these men ever think Or weigh their master's teaching, practice, words, That thus by rote, like empty formulas, They gabble them, as senseless parrots talk. Doctrine and life to him were one. To these Doctrine from life is utterly divorced. Whatever Jesus was, this Church, these men, Are none of his,âor ours; his words alone They worship like a fetish, without sense,â His real inner teaching they reject; Nay, are afraid to look it in the face And seek its meaning, lest it come to this, That they must choose between the things he would, And what they covet dearer than their life. Jew as I am, in view of them, at times I long to see some real Christian sect Ready to take the system that he taught, And try it in this world,ânot talking Peace, Good-will to men, Love, Justice, Charity, But living it in very deed,âa sect That should abjure all individual greed, All competition for a selfish end, And joining, make one common purse for all, As Jesus did among his followers. Would it succeed? Ah, you and I are Jews; Jesus has no authority with us. But were we Christians, and not hypocrites,â Did we believe that he was really God, Or even that his mission was divine,â How should we dare to gloss his teachings o'er, And twist his doctrines so that they should fit Our worldly needs, and in the very face Of his plain orders seek some verbal trick To warp them to the life we like to lead! The Eternal One must needs look down and smile At these base wrigglings of his creatures here, Filled with sad pity, too, at their offense,â Seeing them do, with his name on their lips, All he forbids, and dreaming none the less They only shall be saved,âall others damned. Would Jesus' plan succeed?âThe world thus far Has taken another path,âwe most of all,â Believing not in him, nor in his scheme;â But dreamingâshaking, as it were, from me All usages and habits of the world, At times I stretch my mind out in the vague, And seek upon this plan to build a world. No property, but that which all should own With equal rights,âthe product of all work Held for the common good in trust for all; All, to the lowest, to be clothed, fed, housed, Freed from necessity and from the wolf Of hunger, and the pains and pangs of life; Each having claims on all to do the task Best fitted for his powers, tastes, happiness; Each as a duty bound to do his share, And not to be a drone within the hive. What glory might the world then see!âwhat joy! What harmony of work! what large content! What splendid products of joint industry! All toiling with one purpose and one heart; No war, no waste of noble energies,â But smiling peace, the enlarging grace of art; Humanity a column with its base Of solid work, and at its summit crowned With the ideal capital of Love! This is a dream that turns this world of ours Quite upside down;âI'll say no more of it. And yet one word more, lest you deem me fool! Think not I dream: none but a fool could dream Equality of rights,âthat is, the claim To justice, life, food, freedom in the bound Of common benefit, involves the claim To equal virtues, powers, intelligence,â Since God in these unequal shaped us all, And fitted each one for his special end. So should the wise, just, virtuous take the lead, Or all at once is lawless anarchy; For what more fatal, hopeless, than a scheme Where wise and good, and fool and knave alike, Own equal powers and rights in government? But how secure the leadership to those Whom God hath made for leaders? Ah, my friend, That is the question none hath e'er resolved; For liberty, at best a negativeâ Mere freedom from restraintâengenders soon License and tyranny,âdire positives: Just as Aurelius, best of emperors, Begot for son the cruel Commodus. Danger on all sides threatens government. Choose you a king,âthe very best is weak,â And fierce temptation dogs the path of power. Choose you the Demos,âit perchance is worse; For then, as in an agitated sea, The frothiest ever to the surface swims. Caprice, rage, panic, interest, sway the mob; Justice is overstormed, wisdom lies low, And noisy ignorance, swollen by the breath Of blatant demagogues, wrecks the lost state. Why?âBut because the eager lust of men, The godless strife of utter selfishness, Makes of the world a blind and brutal herd, All crowding on, devoid of common aim,â Each goring his own way to make his path. Well, seeing this, and how these blundering schemes Beget a brood of sin and misery, Said Jesus to his followers: All is wrong; Let it be all reversed,âsuch life is hate; But God is love: try love, then, for your scheme, Try God's law;âas the Book of Wisdom saith: âAll hatred stirreth strife; but love hath power To cover up all sins;â and yet again: âHe who his neighbour scorneth, sins; but he Is happy who hath mercy for the poor.â âThe profit of the earth is made for all, And riches breed disease and vanity.â So saith the preacher, just as Jesus said. Nothing was new in Jesus' scheme but this,â To make community a factâno dream. And scarcely this, say I, Ben Israelâ Commenting on this letter. We of old Among the patriarchs ever practiced it. And well it worked, till, into cities packed, Men grew ambitious, greedy, void of God, And then confusion came to one and all. The greed of riches is the curse of man: Virtue and wisdom only, hand in hand, Have any rightful claims to power; the wise, The good, in every age affirm the same,â Solon, Confucius, Plato, Thales, all. âFlee greed, choose equal rights,â Menander says. When Greece made question of her wisest men What is the best form of all government, Thales replied,ââWhere none are over-rich, None over-poor;â and Anacharsis said,â âWhere vice is hatedâvirtue reverenced.â So Pittacus,ââWhere honours are conferred But on the virtuous;â and Solon, too, In thought, if not in words, like Jesus spoke,â âWhere any wrong unto the meanest done Is held to be an injury to all.â So also Solomon,ââRemove me far From vanity and lies; and give to me Nor poverty nor wealth. Blessed is he Who for the poor and needy giveth thought: The Lord shall help him in his time of need.â But new or old, his followers obeyed, Accepting what he taught. Their life was pure,â They craved no gains, abjured all private wealth; Preached poverty, and practiced what they preached; And then, with stealthy step, and half-veiled face, Pride entered, and ambition; and they shaped That fair community into the thing Now called a Church, and on its altar raised The same false idol he had driven forth; And now what is this Church so called of Christ? The last and even the most hideous shape Of tyrannyâthat spawns upon the world As love's true offspring the foul serpent brood Of superstition, bigotry, and hate. Thus looking on, and striving as I can To keep my mind wide open to new thought, I weave my dream of what the world might be,â A vague wild dream, but not without its charm. Since nothing in our Law forbids to us The trial of this scheme, suppose we Jewsâ (Nay, do not smile)âsuppose we very Jews Go on and do even this, the Christians' work: They will not do it,âoh, be sure of that! No more of this: oh, my Jerusalem!â Thou whom again we shall rebuild in powerâ Let Justice be thy strong foundation-stones, And Love the cement that shall knit them close. Firm in our faithâat lastâat last, O Lord! When we have suffered to the bitter end, Thy chosen people Thou wilt lift again, And sweep thy enemies before thy path. Come not to Rome,âit is the sink of vice: Its grandeur is decayed; its splendid days Are faded. Famine, War, and Pestilenceâ Tempest and inundation and fierce hordes Have o'er it swept, with ruin in their track. The herdsman tends his flocks upon the Hill Where Manlius drove the Gauls. The Capitol Scarcely exists in name: its temples proud Are wrecked and ruined. In the Forum herd Horned cattle; and beyond the Flaminian gate, Where once triumphant swarmed the crowds of Rome, Spreads a flat marsh o'ergrown with rustling canes, Where flocks of whirring wild-fowl make their home. Death haunts the temples, once so full of life. Life crowds the tombs where the dead CÃ¦sars lie, And fortifies their wrecks for deadly feud. The arts have perished. Prone upon the earth Lie shattered the proud statues of their gods, While the rude builder breaks them with his pick, Or burns them into lime. The games are o'er; The streets are filled with ruffian soldiery, Quick at a quarrel; and the deadly knife Of treachery stabs the unsuspecting foe. Upon the Castle every week are seen Black corpses, nailed along the outer walls. The city throngs at night with bravos hired, Who after murder find a safe retreat In many a priestly palace. In a word, Rapine and murder, rape and parricide, Ay, ev'ry crime, with or without a name, Ravage the city. Justice, with sad face, Weeping, hath fled, and Mercy's voice is dumb. Is this the reign of Christâor Belial? Yet still I linger here: I scarce know why. There is a charm that, all beyond my will, Allures me, holds me, will not let me go. 'T is not indeed like our Jerusalem; Yet in its age, its sorrows and its wrongs, It is allied to her,âa city sad, That, like a mourner weeping at a tomb, Sits clad in sackcloth, grieving o'er the past, Hoping for nothing, stricken by despair. Sad, lonely stretches compass her about With silence. Wandering here, at every step We stumble o'er some ruin, once the home Of happy life; or pensive, stay our feet To ponder o'er some stern decaying tomb, The haunt of blinking owls. Nor all in vain Doth kindly nature strive to heal the wounds Of Time and human rage: with ivy green, With whispering grasses, reeds, and bright-eyed flowers, Veiling its ruin; and with tremulous songs Of far larks hidden in the deep blue sky, Lifting the thoughts to heaven. Here many a day Alone I stray, and hold communion sad With dreams that wander far on boundless ways Of meditation vague, recalling oft The passages of Prophets in our Land. At times Isaiah seems to speak, and say To Rome, as once unto Jerusalem: âJudah is fallen, ruin hath involved Jerusalem. What mean ye that ye beat My people into pieces? that ye grind The faces of the poor? The Lord shall take The bravery of thy ornaments away; Thy men shall perish by the sword in war; Thy mighty ones shall perish, and thy gates Lament and mourn; and thou, being desolate, Shalt sit upon the ground. Woe unto them That draw iniquity with the weak cords Of vanity, and call the evil good,â Their roots shall be as rottenness, like dust Their blossoms perish,âfor they cast away The Lord's law, and despise his Holy Word.â And then in sorrow for this grievous fate In which we are plunged, I comfort me with thisâ That he, the Eternal One, hath promised us That we at last shall from our sorrows rest, And from our fear, and from our bondage dire, And build again our new Jerusalem. And yet once more. Hear Jeremiah speak âHow doth the city solitary sit That once was filled with people! How is she Become a widow, that among the powers Was great, and princess in the provinces? She weepeth sorely in the night; her tears Are on her cheeks; and of her lovers none Will comfort her.â Ah, my Jerusalem! Thy sister here is Rome, and sins like thee, And she shall suffer also like to thee. As she hath suffered for her heathen pride And worship of false gods, and now is cast Headlong to earth with all her temples proud, So shall she suffer in the time to come For all her violence and worldly lust, And all her utter falseness to her faith. Is there no place upon this wretched earth Where God shall have his own, and peace shall reign? Is there no spot the devil doth not own? Shall we, poor human wretches, ever seek To thwart God's law, and rear up in his stead Base idols, and make covenant with Death? Such thoughts come over me, oppressed and sad, As 'mid Rome's ruined tombs I meditate, Feeling how transient a thing is man, Whose life is but a shadow on the grass That comes and goes, or like a passing wind, Or like a voice that speaks and vanishes. And sitting silent under the blue sky That broods unchanging o'er the change below, Idly I watch the drooping ivy swing Through sunlit loops of arching aqueducts, Printing its wavering shadow on the sward. Or, as my eye runs down their lessening lines, Broken by gaps of time and war, and strung Along the far Campagna's rolling stretch Like vertebrÃ¦ of some huge skeleton, I ponder o'er the past of Rome,âthe pomp, The pride, the power, the ruin,âmasters, slaves, Conquerors, and victims, even the gods themselves, Shattered and fallen and equal in the dustâ And silent Nature calmly moving on, Heedless of them, and what they were or did, As she will be of us, when we are gone. Often, again, with scarce a conscious thought,â My spirit wandering vaguely, who knows where,â I gaze upon the cloud-shades trailing slow O'er the deep chasms of the opaline hills, And drift with them through some abyss of space, And feel the silence sink into my soul. At times a rustling starts me, and I see Some long-haired goat, that, mounting up to crop A wandering spray, peers down through glass-gray eyes, And, pausing, stares at me. At times, again, I hear the thud of hoofs upon the grass, And jangling swords, and voices of command, As some armed troop goes galloping along. And then I hide me, knowing that my tribe Are only recognized to be the butt Of mocking wordsâor scarce more wounding blows. The shepherd, leaning idly on his staff, Alone has kindly words for such as we,â For Nature hath subdued him into calm, Until he almost seems a part of her. I have seen the Pope, whom in their blasphemy They term God's Holiness. A fisherman, Like Peter, was his father; and his son, By mock humility and specious ways Veiling his inward self, inly devoured By lust of place, and luxury, and power, Hath mounted in the end to Peter's chair. Peter was poor and simple at the least,â Honest though ignorant. This Sixtus here, Fourth of his name, his utter opposite,â Luxurious, worldly, fierce, and stained with crime. There are no limits to his low desires,â None to his passions; and he treads us down As if we were the offal of the earth. Last week he gave a banquet that, I think, Poor Peter would have been aghast to see: 'T is said it cost some twenty thousand crowns, Shaming Vitellius with its cost and waste. But this is nothing to his other deeds. Little he thinks of carrying out the dream Of which I just have spoken. No! the poor Starve on black bread, and fester in disease, While thus he lords it in his luxury. Nor are the rich much better off with him: A short month since he pillaged an old manâ The Prince Colonnaâon some poor pretense;â Robbed him of all his plate, robes, tapestries, Tore him with torture, then lopped off his head; And clothed in wretched rags to mock his rank, Sent back in answer to his mother's prayers For his mere lifeâthe mutilated corpse! And this is God's vicegerent on the earthâ The head of what they call the Christian Church! Bad as the Christian's lot is, ours is worse: We are the football and the scorn of all,â Laden with taxes, tributes,âforced to wear An ignominious badge,âbanned from the town, And huddled in the Ghetto's filthy den. No public office may we hold: our oath Avails not in their courts against the word Of any Christian; and now, worse than this, In these last years one degradation more Is cast upon us by this Christian court, Whose creed is, âLove your neighbour as yourself.â We are but beasts that in the Carnival Must race half-naked, clothed but round the loins, A halter on our necks, as we were dogs,â Insulted, hooted, jeered at by the mob. No one of us is free of this,âor old Or young, whatever be our state,â Elder or priest or child,âit matters not. High ladies, cardinals in purple robes, Ay, even the Pope himself, with all his court, Seated on high, in all their pomp and pride, Laugh at us, as we stumble on our course, Pelted with filth, and shake their holy sides, Encouraging the mob that mock at us. But what offends me more than all the rest Is that this usage has debased our tribe,â Bent its proud neck, and forced it to the earth,â Taught us to cringe and whimper, taught us wiles, And driven us at their beck to creep and crawl. We, who were God's own people,âwe must bow Before these Christians: with a smile accept Even their kicks, and humbly give them thanks For our mere life. This stings me to the quick. As for what Christ said, âLove your enemies; Bless them that curse you, and do good to them,ââ This is beyond the power of any manâ Beyond my power at least,âI cursed them all! I stay my pen here,âfor the hot blood boils Within my brain when thinking on these things: I dare not trust myself to write you more. My work is almost done for which I came, And soon I hope to greet your face again, Shaking the dust off from this godless place, With all its rottenness and infamy: Then for my dear Jerusalem again! Greet all my friends,âRebecca, Ishmael, And all your dear ones. Peace be with you all! I count the days till we once more shall meet. A PRIMITIVE CHRISTIAN IN ROME. DEDICATED TO T. G. A. It seems so strange to us of the new faith, Who feel its beauty, joy, and holiness, Rising above this lower Pagan creed, Like morning o'er the dark and dreaming earth; To us who have beheld, known, talked with those Who walked beside our Lord, and heard his voice, And with their own eyes saw his miracles,â To hear these Romans, Marcus, Caiusânay, Even Lucius, who is learned, liberal, trained In every school of thought, deny them all: Calling them mere impostures, or at best, Distortions of the facts, half true, half false, With nothing but the false miraculous! It makes us grieve, as showing how they lack That sense by which alone the natural man, As Paul says, can receive the things of God. But when had any Roman in all time A spiritual sense? 'T is to the East The power of prophecy is given: alone It shapes religions, has the inner sight That through the matter sees the soul beyond, Is through its faith receptive, not its mind, And nearer unto God, as is the child. The West, immersed in things, is as the man, And joys to fashion governments and laws: It orders facts, it thinks, invents, and works, But blind and deaf to spiritual truth Lives in the Present, builds no infinite bridge Into the Future, hopes not, nor divines. At highest, 't is the world's great intellect, Its understanding, brain, and not its soul. Lucius is of the West; he cannot feel Those finer impulses beyond the sense, Those inward yearnings stretching out of sight, Where reason cannot follow, after truth. As far as intellect can lead him on Up the clear path of logic, he will go; The rest is nonsense, and, of course, he likes The well-trod path as being the most safe. And thus he reasons on the miracles:â âOf facts like these, conforming to no law, There are a thousand chances of mistake To one in favour of the apparent facts,â First, self-deception; strong desire to see Begets the power of seeing; from itself The nervously expectant sense projects Its image, its mirage, or hears returned The outward echo of the inward voice; And while the reason and the judgment drowse, The fancy, all alive, sees, hears, accepts. Then come illusions of the senses;âFacts Half seen are wholly false,âscarce facts at all. Let but the fact be strange and new, surprise Destroys the power of scrutiny.âAgain, Wonder, the habitual state of many minds (Those, most of all, religiously inclined), Love of the marvelous, a dread to peer Too keenly into that which wears a garb Of holiness, a proneness to revere What others reverenceâall lead astray. Belief is passive: it receives, accepts; But doubt is active: it disputes, rejects. You think these wonders, facts. You say that Christ Was holy in his aspect, pure in life, And in his perfectness above mankind. I will not question this: I only say He was a man, at best, and not a god. The Jews could not have crucified a god. No, nor a demigod, like Hercules. âObserve, I do not say as others do, That he was wicked in intent, and sought A kingly crown above his wretched tribe. And if he did, I care not. What he said Was well enough, only it was not new. All that is good is found in Socrates, Or Plato, or the old Philosophies. Had he been born in Greece, he might, perhaps, Have graced the train of one of these great men. But in that dismal Syria, 'mid a herd Of ignorant Jews, most of them fishermen, Who worshiped him, he lost all common sense. From what I hear, he grew half-cracked at last, And thought himself a god, and claimed the power Of miracles, like other madmen here. Well, well: he suffered for all that by death, And, I dare say, was better than the most Among that loathsome people. For all that, Touched in his brain he was, you must admit. For what man in his senses ever dreamed He from the dead should rise with pomp and power A kingdom to establish on the earth? âAs for his miracles, I do not doubt That some among that herd of credulous fools, On whom he practiced, thought they saw these things. But who was there with eyes and mind well trained To sift the facts, to judge the evidence, To question, to examine, to record? Not one: the stupid crowd cried âmiracleâ (For everything is miracle to them); The Scribes and Pharisees, the learned men, All stood aloof and scorned him and his works. âAnd were they true, what prove they?âWhy, in Rome These wonder-working magians come by scores, Each with his new inspired theogony, Each with his miracle to prove him God! For instance, there is Judas, whom they call The Gaulonite; and his three sons as well; There is Menander, and Cerinthus too, Theudas, and the greatest two of all, Simon of Gitton, named the Magian, And Apollonius of Tyana. Thousands assert for them, as you for Christ, A supernatural power, a gift divine. What shall I say? All surely are not gods! No! nor a single one. Some, as I hear, Are scholars versed in Egypt's mystic lore, And by the subtle thought of Greece imbued, With minds enriched by travel and strange tongues, And skilled in writing, teaching, prophecy: 'T is even said their prophecies prove true! If so, by chance, by happy guess, no more. Yet if I hold these miracles of theirs As mere delusions (and you say they are), How can you ask me to accept on faith Those Christ (a good man, if you will, but yet An untaught Jew of Galilee) performed, Far out of sight, with none to vouch for them Except a ruck of wretched ignorant Jews? As for their doctrines, systems, forms of faith, There is an Eastern likeness in them all, Simon or Christâ't is nearly the same thing. âAnd so this magian had the power, you think, To drive out shrieking devils from the breasts Of madmen, and compel them by his will To rush into a herd of guiltless swine; Nay, that he cured the sick, and raised the dead, One Lazarus, four days buried, till he stank; Even more, that he could raise himself to life When crucified and dead, and in his tomb; And all because these awe-struck vulgar Jews Saw some one like him, and affirmed 't was he. A woman first, a Mary Magdalene, Set all these stories going. Who was she? A half-mad courtesan, one who had owned Her seven devilsâbut of her the less You say the better. You'll at least admit The kingdom that he promised on the earth, The pomp, the power, the glory, were all trash. He vanished very swiftly out of sight For all his promises, and left the fools Who trusted him to gape and stare to see Some day the heavens open, as he said, And him with angels coming. When he comes Pray give me notice;âI, too, will believe; Till then, excuse me; on such evidence Of such grave portents, I to change my faith! I would not hang a sparrow on it all.â So Lucius thinks, and talks, and never sees How strange a contradiction in him lies; For he believes in all the wildest myths, And miracles, and wonders of his gods, Ay, and his demigods as well, and pays To them his reverential sacrifice. Like a good pagan, he believes them all, Though he admits, of course, he never saw, Nor any eyes of any living man; Though all the evidence is far away, Dimmed and obscured by misty centuries; And though these myths are vouched by writings vague Or by tradition only, differing, too, In each tradition. Yet this faith being fixed, Established by long ages of belief, It must be true; and our good Lucius sees In all these variations proofs of truth. The facts remain, he says, despite them all, Colored by this report or that report, For this is human merelyâonly shows How various minds are variously impressed; One sees the fact as red, one green, one blue, But all this difference proves the existing fact. But when Christ comes within our very reach, And living crowds behold his miracles, Attesting them by strenuous belief, And sudden cries, and life-long change of faith, All are deceived; such strange things cannot be! Yet either they were true or false. If false, How were these crowds impressed to think they saw What never happened? Is not this as strange, As wondrous as the miracles themselves? âTricks, tricks,â he says, âthey only thought they saw; Do not a juggler's tricks deceive us all? I have no faith in Apollonius For all the evidenceâit must be trick. In ancient times the gods came down to man, Assuming human powersâbut that is past; But when a human creature of to-day Assumes their functions, and works miracles Against the laws of nature, and calls up The dead, the best thing is to hold him mad.â No! Lucius will not try the old and new By the same test; a kind of mystery shrouds The ancient fact; the current of belief For generations carries him along. The early faith, stamped on his childish mind, Can never be erasedâ't is deep as life. The priest, the sacrifice, the daily rites, The formula, the fashion, the old use Possess him, coloring all his life and thought; And we, who in the new, pure faith rejoice, Seem to his eyes, at least, but fools misled, Who only seek his gods to overthrow, And to whom ruin in the end must come. We smile in pityâlet us, too, be just. 'T is hard to root up all one's faith at once; All the old feelings, all the happy dreams, All the sweet customs, the long growth of years. The very superstitions of our youth Have fragrance in them. Underneath the words We faltered, clinging to a mother's hand, A dim, sweet music flows. To that old song No new-writ verse will ever run so smooth. We strike his faith, and whoso strikes our faith We hold as foeâand oft lose sight of Truth Defending dogmas, doctrines, formulas, Shells though they be, from which the life has fled. While yet the mind is plastic to a touch, The die of doctrine strikes, deep in, our faith, And age but hardens the impression there. Half our fixed notions are but ancient ruts Of empty words and formulas of thought, Worn in by repetition and long useâ And easy run the wheels within these ruts. He who assails and goads the mind to think, Or starts it from the grooves of prejudice, We call foul names, we hate, we scorn, we fear; He seems at once a foe to man and God. What will he do? Old superstitious props Hold up our lives; if they be stricken down, What shall befall us? Oh! that way lies death! Old miracles, myths, dogmas, all things old, Are reverent for their age. It is the new We have to fear: as if God did not work With fresh abounding power in our own day, In our own souls; as if dead creeds could hold The living spirit, and these pagan husks Forever feed the soul that starves for Truth. I will not say but in old myths resides Something of goodâsome tender living germ Of beauty and delight. Though I renounce Their errors for this higher, holier life That Christ has given; still, 't is sweet to think Of Aphrodite rising from the sea, The incarnate dream of beauty; of the staid, Calm dignity of wisdom bodied forth In grand Minerva; of the gracious joy, The charm of nature, Bacchus represents; Of Flora scattering flowers and breathing spring; Of all those lovely shapes that lurking gleam Through nature's sunny openings. Ah! I know Reason rejects them for a higher thought, And yet, at times, that old sweet faith returns To tempt me back in its poetic train. At times, the one Eternal Father seems So far away, and this fair world that teemed With airy shapes, so void and cold and bare. But this is folly. Yet if in my heart Old superstitions still possess a charm, How harshly blame our Lucius, who remains Fixed in the oldâto whom we only seem Rash innovators, bringing in new gods? Of other stuff is our friend Caius made. The folly of this faith he will admit; âAnd yet,â he says, âthe system stands our stead Despite its folliesâwhy then cast it down? Truth is impossible; we cannot know; The impenetrable veil of destiny Behind our life, before our life is dropped. All is an idle guess, and this mixed creed Of superstitions has its gleams of truth. It served our fathers; if we cast it down Then chaos comes. Thinking results at last In wretchedness. We cannot hope to know. Only the gods know. Man's mind must be fed With superstitions mixed with truth; pure truth Would merely madden; for as we are made Half mind, half matter, so our thoughts must be. Then let our faith stand where it is; the beams Are rotten here and there, but he who mends May topple down the temple on our heads, And leave us godless. Nay, the parasite Of superstition, like the ivy, knits The old wall's crumbling stones. For higher minds A higher truth, a purer faithâbut that Through all these forms, we, who have eyes, can see, The forms themselves the common herd demand. Since all at last is theory, the best Is to be happy, calm, and confident. What is, isâand we cannot alter it. Then plague me not with revelations new. All things are revelations; every creed Comes from above, from God, from all the gods. Pure sunlight blinds the eye, so comes it veiled With soft suffusion in the ambient air; The sun, itself one speckâthe positive Set in an infinite negative of sky, And beauty, offspring of the eternal light, Dimmed to soft hues to suit our mortal sense. âAs for your miracles, I heed them not; For all things, in one sense, are miracles. Who can explain the simplest fact of life, As how we see, or move our hand, or speak, Or how we think, or what is life or death? By dint of daily doing use wears out All strangeness; and with words which but restate And group the facts, we fancy we explain. Our so-called laws of nature are but rules Drawn by experience from recurrent facts, Which every new phenomenon corrects. Cause and effect are only cheating words; We know no causes, we but see effects. Yet, as in one sense all is miracle, So, in another, no such thing exists. The new, the strange, outside the common rule Of man's experience, seems miraculous, For mortal eyes are dim, and short of sight. But could we through this world's phenomena Pierce to the essence and the life of things, All would arrange itself to perfect lawâ No breaches, no exceptions, all pure law.â Our Decimus, who hopes to win the rank Of tribune, takes a somewhat different view. âDon't talk to me,â he says, âof right or wrong, Of true or false; we all must take the world For what it is. Against established things Why run your head, and spoil your chance in life? Christ may have been a god, or he may not, But here in Rome we worship other gods; Better or worse is not the question here. If you would win success, go with the crowd, Nor like a fool against the current strive; What will you gain by warring with the time, And preaching doctrines that the general mind Considers impious? Even were they true, They only raise up foes to tread you down. As for myself, I'm not the babbling fool To utter all I think. I sacrifice With all the rest, perform the common rites, And do the thing that 's deemed respectable; And so I win the favor of all men. What care I if the crowd be right or wrong? I use them just to serve my purposes, As steps whereby to rise to place and power. One should not be the last to leave the old, Nor yet the first to welcome in the new. The popular beliefâthat is my faith; My gods are always on the side that wins.â Marcus, the augur, whose whole life is spent In omens, auguries, and sacrifice, And service at the temple in white robes, So deep is sunken in the pagan rut He cannot start his mind even to think. Our creed to him is rank impiety, Worthy of death. He to the beasts would throw Whoever dares our doctrines to embrace. His faith is absolute; no shade of doubt Has ever crossed him; he is planted there Firm as a tree, or rather, like a wall; A tree lives, grows, but he is simply dead, Stone upon stone, dull, dead, fixed, like a wall. Thus, buttressed up by custom's honoured props, Established in the faith of centuries, Engraved with mystic lines and Orphean hymns, Old saws and sacred lore of ancient priests, An honest, absolute, stolid wall he stands, Firm to uphold the statues of the gods, And shield them from the assaults of impious men. If I beseech him to consider well And reason on his faith, he cries, amazed, âReason! what more fallacious guide than that? Reason! with human reason do you dare To explain the gods, and to assail our faith? They in the days of old revealed themselves, Assumed our shapes, ordained the sacrifice Of blood and wine upon our altars poured, Their power attested by miraculous deeds, And still by omens, portents, auguries, Inform and aid us on our human path. You do not understand them? oh, indeed! And so you summon them before your bar, Bid them explain their doings and their laws, And if they fail to meet your views, why, then You judge them and reject them. Oh, I see! The gods must ask leave to be gods from us, And beg our pardon if by ways obscure, Instead of common human ways, they work, Or else we will arise and get new gods. Oh, Jupiter! who are these impious men? Whence do they come, what do they mean, who thus Set up at Rome their superstitions vile, And with their feeble reason dare oppose The will of heaven? Go, atheist, infidel, Go, and ask pardon of the gods, and learn Obedience, and humility, and fear, Or Jove himself will from his right hand launch His thunderbolt, and sweep you to your fate.â At times, this solid, settled faith of his Shakes me with doubt. For what if he be right, And this new faith that so commends itself To all I am and hope, be, at the worst, Temptation and delusion, shall I set My face against the verdict of the world? Shall not the faith that soothed the dying bed Of Socratesâthe faith that Plato taught And Cicero avowed, suffice for me? Shall I dare question what such minds affirm? âObey! obey!â a voice within me cries ('T is the old echo of my early faith), And then, âArouse!â cries out a stronger voice, âArouse! shake off this torpor! Sink not down In the old creedâeasy because 't is old; In the dead faithâso fixed, because 't is dead.â Let us go in and speak with Paul again. He is so strong, he braces up our faith, And stiffens all the sinews of the mind. PHIDIAS TO PERICLES. So the old crew are at their work again, Spitting their venom-froth of calumny, And Menon's is the voice that now gives cry,â A poor weak tool for those who lurk behind, Hid in the dark to prick him to their work; For who so blind as not to recognize The hand of Cleon, the coarse demagogue, Who rails at all to gain a place himself; And scurrilous Hermippus, and the rest Of that mean pack we know so well of old? 'T is sorry work, for which high-minded men Must feel contempt, or pity at the least. Menon I hoped at first would merely prove An honest tool, bewrayed to a false charge But honest in his purpose, though too free In quick aspersion, taking little heed To seek for truth, and careless where he struck And whom he wounded; but since still he clings To his foul calumny, and stoops to pick Even from the gutter aught that serves his turn, I give him up. Let him go with the rest. Yet those who urge him on I rather scorn; And for this charge now boldly cried at last Into the public ear, I give him thanks. So long as scandal, like a slimy snake, Crawled in the grass, and hissed, and darted out Its poisonous fangs in ambush, none could tell Where it was creeping; now it shows its head, And we may crush it like a noisome thing. High as man stands when at his godlike heights Of valour, honour, justice, and large thought, The noblest shape the gods have ever made, He in his lowest vices is more low Than any wretched reptile on the earth. We do dumb creatures wrong to liken them To some mean talking creatures, who spit forth Their envious venom, and with poisonous tongue Of foul detraction sting their fellow-man. Beasts have not these mean vicesâonly men. You, Pericles, and I, do what we will, Are guilty, both of us, of one offense That envious natures never can forgiveâ The great crime of success. If we were low They would not heed us; but the praise of men Lavished on us in Athens, right or wrong, Rouses their anger. They must pull us down. What can we hope for better than the fate Of Anaxagoras, Miltiades, Themistocles, or any, in a word, Of those who in our Athens here have stood In lofty places? It was crime enough For Aristides to be called âThe Just.â And yet some consolation lies in this: 'T is at the tallest poppies that men strike; 'T is at fruit-bearing trees that they throw stones. There are some natures so perverse, they feed And batten upon offal; unto them Nothing is pure or noble, nothing clean, On which they do not seek to cast a stain. They, like the beetle, burrowing in the dark, Gather 'mid mould and rot their noisome food, And issuing into sunlight roll their ball Of filth before them, deeming it the world; Honour and truth, fair dealing, upright aims, Bare honesty, to them are only shams, Professions, catch-words, that a man may use To gull the world with, not realities. Is there a tree that lifts into the air Its glad green foliage: there like cankered pests These vermin crawl and bite. Is there a fruit That glows and ripens in the summer sun: There speed these wasps to buzz and sting and stain. Whence come into their minds these hints and taunts Of fraudulent and evil practices They cast at other men with such free hands? Are they not germs spontaneously bred Of their own naturesâgerms of evil thoughts, Of possibilities, if not of facts, That in themselves might ripen into deeds? In the clean nature no such growth is bred; What is repulsive to our inner sense We deem impossibilities to all. Let me not be unjust: this paltry few Who in our Athens do their dirty work Are bad exceptions to the better rule Of honest and high-minded men, who scorn Such arts to rise, ungoaded by the spur Of envy, deeming the world wide enough For all like brothers heartily to work. And I would fain believe that even they Who use these arts and spread these calumnies Are troubled by remorse in better hours, And feel the sting of conscience, and abjure These lies that come like curses home to roost. Because we will not strike our hands in theirs, Drink with them, haunt with them the market-place, Use their low practices to court the rich, Hint falsehoods, that we dare not frankly say, Flatter and fawn for favors, sneer at allâ Even those we publicly profess our friendsâ We are aristocrats forsooth; we lift Our heads too high, we are too proud; a thing Which is a shame for one in Athens born. We should be hand and glove with every one. Well! let us own we are too proud, at least, To court low company; too proud to rise By any step that treads a brother down; Too proud to stoop to defamating arts; Too proud to sneer, to crawl, to cringe, to lie! And if in Athens we select our friends, Is this forbidden to a freeman here? So, not content with throwing stones at you, My noble Pericles, they cast at me Their evil scandals. 'T was impiety Because I wrought your figure and mine own Upon Athena's shield; then, worse than this, Our fair Aspasia they aspersed, and slurred My honour and your own, as well as hers. Now, since these shafts have struck not to the white, A grosser scandal, hoping that at last Some mud will stick if but enough be thrown; So Menon cries, âThis sculptor whom you praise Has stolen for his private use the gold The state confided to him, to encrust This statue of Athena.â 'T is a lie! An evil, wicked lie; as well you know, My Pericles. I see it in your smile. Yet, were it not that, with small faith in men Like those that watch us with an evil eye, I feared some accusation like to this (And you yourself forewarned me of the same), I had perchance been reft of all clear proof Against this libel. As it is, I smile. Each dram and scruple of the gold was weighed. 'T is moveable; and in response I say, Let it be taken off and weighed again. If in the balance it be changed a hair, The fault be on my head. It will not change! Thus far, O Pericles, well though I knew Such calumnies were whispered secretly, I would not stoop to answer them, secure In my own honour, scornful of the crew That uttered them, and holding it a loss Of simple dignity to make response. One does not stride forth in the market-place To vaunt one's honesty, or cry aloud âI do not lie and steal, though curs do bark.â But here 's a public charge of theft urged home, With show of false facts and pretended proof, And so I speak; I ask for trial now, Lest to the ignorant, who know me not, Mere silence wear the false mask of consent. But what avails it? Baffled in their aim, They will retire a moment, to return With some new scandal, which will creep and crawl At first in whispers, dark and vague, and then Take shape, grow stronger, and at last lift up Its public hissing head. These cunning lies Will serve their purpose, save to honest men; The noble and the just will stand by me; The envious rabble cherish still the lie. Yes; for a lie will hurry to the bound Of twilight, scattering its noisome seed, Ere tardy Truth can lace its sandals on To start in chase. Besides, great Truth is proud And confident, disdaining to pursue Through secret drains and slums the eager lie That loves a whispered word, a foul surmise, And in reply to Truth's calm honest voice Winks, hints, and shrugs its shoulders with a laugh. Ten thousand ears will hear the audacious lie, One thousand to the refutation list, Ten of ten thousand will believe stern Truth. True, the last ten outweigh, as gold does dross, The other thousands; but one does not like One's clean robes to be smirched by dirt and mud, Even though the mud brush off. Posterity Will do us justice? Yes, perhaps, or no. So long as men are men 't will be the same, Or now, or thousands of long years from now. And it is now we live. Our honest fame, To be enjoyed, must compass us about Like ambient air we breatheâpure, without taint. What matters it, when I am turned to dust, When all emotions, joys, loves, passions, hopes, Are vanished like a breeze that dies away, And all that I am now,âthese hands, this heart, This spirit,ânay, the very friends I own, And all that lent this life its perfect charm, Are past and over; ah! what matters it What in the future men may say or do? Whether, disputing o'er my grave, at last They call me good or bad, honest or vile? What joy can any verdict give me then, When I myself, and all who love me now, And all who hate or envy me as well, Will be but mute insensate dust, whose ear No word of blame can reach, no word of praise? And yet, even then, although it matters not, Truth, standing by my grave, I trust, will say, Honest he was, and faithful to the last, Above low frauds, striving for lofty ends, Obedient to the gods, and friend to man, Doing his work with earnest faith and will; Not vaunting what he did, but knowing well Perfection is impossible in Art; Receiving with humility the praise The world accorded, wishing well to all, And never envious of his brother's fame. There stands Athena, she whom Menon says I did not make, being helped by better men, Whose fame I thus defraud of their just rights By claiming it as mine. What can one say To such a paltry charge of petty fraud? I scorn to answer it; nay, even they Who make it know 't is false as 't is absurd. Speak! my Athena; answer thou for me! She will not answer, yet her silence speaks More eloquent than any words of mine. Look, Pericles! how calm and all unmoved She stands and gazes at us; a half-scorn On those still lips at these poor jealousies, These foolish bickerings and strifes of men. âWhat mean you, that you make this wicked noiseâ (She seems to say), âyou creatures of an hour? Why do you wrangle thus your life away With your sharp lies and envious vanities, Buzzing and stinging a brief moment's space In Time's thin stretch across the Infinite, Whose awful silences shall gulf you all?â Swift evanescent flashes through the dark Across the untroubled patience of the night, And the still, far, unalterable stars. Ye boasters! what is all your vaunted work That with such pride ye build, save that the gods Smile on you and assist you? 'T is not yours, If any good be in it. Bend your hearts Before the Powers august. Strive not to rob Your fellow-mortal of the gift the gods Bestow upon him. Humbly do the work That is appointed, and in confidence Await the end, secure of Nemesis.â MARCUS AURELIUS TO LUCIUS VERUS. DEDICATED TO THE LADY WILLIAM RUSSELL. I have received your letter, read it through With careful thought, and, to confess the truth, I deem it timid to a point beyond What suits an Emperor,âtimid in a way Unsuited to the temper of the time. You say Avidius hates us; does not stint His jests and sneers at what we are and do; Has no respect for the imperial robes; Says you are an old woman, whose bald talk You deem profound philosophy, while I Am merely a debauched and studious fool. You bear him no ill-will for this, you say, (My noble Lucius, this is worthy you!) But then you add you fear he has designs To do us wrong, and beg me to keep watch, Lest he, by all his wealth and power, at last Compass our ruin. But consider thisâ If to Avidius Destiny decree The Empire's purple, all our art is vain! You know the saying of your ancestor, Our austere Trajan, âNever was there prince Who killed his own heir;â no man e'er prevailed Him to o'erthrow whom the immortal gods Had marked as his successor; so, as well, He whom the gods oppose must surely fall, Not through our act, but by his destiny, Caught in the inevitable snare of fate. Again, the traitor or the criminal, Though by the clearest proof convicted, stands As 't were at bay; one weak and friendless man Against the state's compacted law and might, And thus moves pityâseeming, as it were, From that unequal match to suffer wrong. âWretched, indeedâ (as your grandfather said), âThe fate of princes who make good their charge Of purposed murder by their martyrdom, Proving the plot against their life, by death.â Domitian 't was, in truth, who spake these words, Yet rather would I call them Hadrian's, Since tyrants' sayings, true howe'er they be, Have not the weight of good and noble men's. As for Avidius, then, let him work out His secret course, being, as you say he is, Austere in discipline, a leader brave, And one the state cannot afford to lose; Let him continue there upon the edge Of Daphnic luxury, near by Antioch, To rein the army in and hold it firm, Secure that Nemesis awaits on him, As on us all, whate'er we are or do: And for my children's interests, and mine, If they can only be subserved by wrong, Perish my children, rather than through wrong They triumph! If Avidius deserve Better than they, and if through him the state Glory and strength superior may gain, Better he live and win the prize he seeks! Better they die and yield to him the state! Please God, that while the imperial robes I wear No blood be shed for me,âfor I would fain Be called âThe Bloodless,â like our Antonine! And if this man have injured me, and shown Ingratitude, that meanest of all sins, At least he cannot rob me of one boon I hold the greatest given by victory, That of forgiveness. Ever since the Fates Placed me upon the throne, two aims have I Kept fixed before my eyes; and they are these:â Not to revenge me on my enemies, And not to be ungrateful to my friends. GIROLAMO, DETTO IL FIORENTINO, DESPONDS AND ABUSES THE WORLD. âMi dici che sono famoso e che tutti mi lodano. Ah! caro amico mio, qual valore ha ciÃ² che si chiama successo in questo mondo? L'alto frutto che stentiamo tanto a cogliere, che ci lusinga tanto colla sua bella apparenza spesso in bocca sembra insipido, immaturo, od aspro. E poi, la Fama viene troppo tardi! Son vecchio e non mi fido piÃ¹ a belle parole. Grata sarebbe stata la lode del mondo quando ero giovane, m'avrebbe consolato, rinforzato, spronato ad alte imprese, come lo squillo della tromba che eccita al conflitto, che promette vittoria. Ma ora le illusioni, le speranze sono fuggite ed il reverbero della Fama non mi pare che un rumore vano ed insulso. I cari son morti e non possono udirlo; e per me poco me ne curo. Quel che ho fatto, ho fatto e lo conto per poco. Tutte le lusinghe del mondo non cambierebbero il mio giudizio. L'albero ha portato il suo frutto, e buono o cattivo rimane quello che Ã¨.ââ Lettera inedita di Girolamo. Success, ah yes, success, you say I've gained! The world applauds, and yet I only sigh. Its loud applause but feeds my vanity; The jewel that I sought is not attained. Something there was which once the future hadâ A foolish hope, an idle dream, a light That shone before me ever day and nightâ That now is gone, and leaves me poor and sad. 'T was not to win the fickle world's applause: That followed after as effect, not cause; And between that and this you call success How vast a void! Something I dreamed to do, The joy of which should light my being through With a serene interior happiness. So strove I with the toil of brain and heart, Saying, âInto the inner sphere of art When I have pierced and made me master there, The toil all over, I shall stand and bear Sound fruit, sweet blossoms, like a healthy tree That hath the winds of heaven for playmates free, A rest and refuge for the head of care.â What now is come instead? This glorious star Turns out to be a common, vulgar lampâ A false marsh-meteor dancing o'er the damp, Low stretch of blasted life; this godlike Lar A brazen cheat; this fair Hesperian fruit A Dead Sea apple; and the siren's lute Strung to such discord it were better mute. Once by the shore I mused and saw afar A dream-like bark, that o'er the morning sea, Through veiled and violet distances of air, With roseate sails went gliding silently; Freighted with bliss, to some ideal land Its happy peaceful way it seemed to wend. And there I longedâoh, how I longed to be! Now on its filthy deck at last I stand: Oh, dismal disenchantment, bitter end! Soiled are its sails, the sea is rough and high, Foul are the odors, coarse the company; And sick at stomach and at heart I lie, And curse my fate and wish that I could die. The world has cured me of my self-conceit; Its cold rebuffs have brushed away like dust My youth's presumptuous faith and proud self-trust. What do I care if they were all a cheat, Those bright illusions of my early years? While I believed that I was strong, I was; Self-conscious, now, I look around and pause, Hindered in all I do by doubts and fears. Success! Yes, while you stinted me in praise My pride upheld me; to myself I said, âSome time they'll praise me, after I am dead. The work is good, although the world delays; I for the prize can wait.â But now you blow The trumpet in my honour, I bend low, And from my eyes my work's best charm has fled. Once I compared it with the world's neglect, And proudly said, â'Tis better than they see.â Now I behold it tainted with defect In the broad light of what it ought to be. Fame seemed, when out of reach, how sweet and grand! How worthless, now I grasp it in my hand! The glory was the struggle, the affray; Victory is only loss; at last I stand Mourning amid dead hopes at close of day. Give me the old enthusiasms back, Give me the ardent longings that I lack,â The glorious dreams that fooled me in my youth, The sweet mirage that lured me on its track,â And take away the bitter, barren truth. Ah, yes! Success, I fear, has come too late! Once it had swelled my heart and filled my sails; Now I am reefed, it only cries and wails In my rent cordage like a blast of fate. The lift is gone, the spring is strained and weak; I scorn the praise yon idle praisers speak. What matters now the lauding of your lips, What matters now the laurel wreath you plait For these bald brows, for these gray hairs? It slips Over my eyes and helps to hide my tears. I am too old for joysâalmost for fears. Ye critics, pardon, that I dared to do Not as you wished, but only as I chose. You might have done far better, it is true, And perfumed my camellia like a rose. Oh, had you wrought my crippled works yourselves, They had been giants which are now but elves! Do we not feel as well our works' defect As you who circling round them hum and sing, Mosquito critics with a poisonous sting; Or ye whose higher purpose 't is to teach, Who kindly patronize, suggest, direct, And make our labours texts on which to preach And show your own superior intellect? Do we not know our work is mean and poor? 'T is only when the fire is in the brain, And all alone we striveâthe outward door Of life closed upâand listen as to one Speaking within us with a spirit's tone, That what we do seems not entirely vain. Waking from that half-trance of inner thought, The voices gone, the real world returned, We feel the thing that we have done is naughtâ A blackened brand with all the flame outburned, A goblet cracked which all its wine hath shed, A cage in which the singing bird is dead. This was my hope and trust, when I am gone, Dead, turned to dust, senseless to blame or praise, That somewhat out of all that I had sown Of thought and feeling on the world's highways Might not be held as base and noxious weeds For Time with hand unsparing to destroy, But, falling on some kindly soil, the seeds Might grow and bloom into a moment's joy, Or ripen into fruit of noble deeds. This lent me life, and strung my throbbing strings To music once. What joy 't would be to feel My song into some maiden's heart might steal And live amid her pure imaginings,â That she should keep it in her memory As handmaid to her love, and breathe it low, And pour into it all the overflow Of her young heart and say it with a sigh; Or that some student in despairing hour Should from a word of mine renew his power; Some toiling heart be strengthened in its aim; Some faltering purpose trample down its shame; Some eye, long used to poring on the ground, Look up and feel the sky and beauty round; Some sorrowing mourner get a glimpse of youth; Some world-cased spirit feel the sting of truth. Is this so now? You say it is, and yet It does not stir me now; the fountain's jet But dribbles o'er the worn-out pipes, where first Its shattered showers of diamonds towering burst. Autumn has come; the grass is dry and sere; No spring-time flowers now grace the dying year. The fruits are nearly culled; the harsh winds blight The lingering leaves. I only linger here, And the time comes for me to say good-night. Yes, I am sadâsad and dispirited, And those I loved and laboured for are dead. The heart is hardened, once so sensitive. Fame the world gives, but youth it cannot give; Nor can it give me back the smiles of those Whose praise had been the best reward on earth Success but makes me feel the dreadful dearth, The gap of death that naught can ever close. Midst all the voices oneâthe dearest oneâ I miss to greet me now my work is done. The hand that would so gladly on my brow Have placed the laurel that you bring too late, And kissed the lips below,âwhere is it now? What do I care that now you call me great; Is this the triumph, this the happiness? Cry to the dead ones, âHe hath won success.â Say, will their voices answer back to bless? Yet courage! this is but an idle mood; To-morrow I shall feel within my blood A new pulse beating, a new impulse start. 'T is but a cloud to-day comes o'er my heart, A sickening sense of weakness, where desire Hath only left the ashes of its fire. Art still remains, and wheresoe'er I be It draws me with a sweet necessity. Though in a moment's rage I storm and frown, And with a rude hand cast its altars down, Or, disappointed and depressed with care, Heed not the perfume of the incense there, A better mood will come, when I again Shall seek its temple, worship in its train, Put on my coronal, and be its priest, Glad to perform the duty that is least. For what were life without its joys and fears, Its tumults, and its clash of smiles and tears? What could I do, forbade to enter in Its happy courts, but sit without and weep? No! the old use will never let me sleep, And, poor as all my service yet hath been, While life continues in this breast to beat, A space to struggle and a prize to win Will still remain. Oh, not alone a name, Though human praise to human ears is sweet, Allures me. Something higher far I claim, To shape out something that I shall not shame To lay upon art's shrine as offering meet; Something in which the strength of age shall be, And youth's high hope be made reality. So! still the same; these years have nothing taught; Still the enthusiast! Even while I spoke Elastic springs the hope I thought was broke. I am a child still. Oh, thank Heaven! not all, Despite the world's rebuffs and what you call Success, not all is lost and turned to naught! There 's tinder yet which can be set on fire When the chance sparks of feeling on it fall. I have not stood a beggar on the ways And held my hand out for the critic's praise; I have not flattered, fawned, nor coined my heart, Degraded the high purposes of art, Pandered to vulgar aims and groveling thought; And if success has come, it comes unbought. Art shall not drag her skirts along the mud While I can help her; shall not beg and cringe, Claim alms for pity's sake, her heaven-born blood Ceasing with noble pride her cheeks to tinge. I have not cast her alms, but on my knees Been thankful for the crust she threw to me, Me, her poor worshiper, most glad to be Her humblest slave; glad if by slow degrees I win one smile at last my life to bless, And this alone for me would be success. PORTRAITS AND PERSONS. PAN IN LOVE. Stop running more. You mustâindeed you shall. See how your feet are hurt. Your breath comes fast And all in vain. Light as you are, you see I can outrun you, and these briers and brakes That tear your tender feet will never harm My horny hoofs. Why do you fly from me? I mean no ill. Stop. Rest upon this bank, Soft with green mosses, sprinkled with quaint flowers, And listen to me while you get your breath. Bacchus is in the distant vale, so far His cymbals scarcely reach usâfar away Silenus and his routâthey'll never hear Though you should scream with all your little voice. I am a coarse, rough fellow, but I love Such smooth, white-limbed, soft-footed things as you. What shall I do to make you love me back, And twine those arms around this hairy neck? What shall I give you for a kiss? Come, sit On these rough shaggy knees, and smooth my cheeks With your soft hands. Bacchus is fairer far; But he, the fickle, vain, conceited god, Loves but himself, and changes every hour For some new fancy. I will be more true, And love forever. Ah! we ugly gods Alone are constant, and that Venus knew When she preferred to all the dandy crew Stern, black, old Vulcan. Oh! dear little feet! Dear little hands, so rosy, tapering, slight. See, how they look against these hands and hoofs, That never will be tired to work for you. Nay! if you will not sit upon my knee, Lie on that bank, and listen while I play A sylvan song upon these reedy pipes. In the full moonrise as I lay last night Under the alders on Peneus' banks, Dabbling my hoofs in the cool stream, that welled Wine-dark with gleamy ripples round their roots, I made the song the while I shaped the pipes. 'T is all of you and love, as you shall hear. The drooping lilies, as I sang it, heaved Upon their broad green leaves, and underneath, Swift silvery fishes, poised on quivering fins, Hung motionless to listen; in the grass The crickets ceased to shrill their tiny bells; And even the nightingale, that all the eve Hid in the grove's deep green, had throbbed and thrilled, Paused in his strain of love to list to mine. Bacchus is handsome, but such songs as this He cannot shape, and better loves the clash Of brazen cymbals than my reedy pipes. Fair as he is without, he 's coarse withinâ Gross in his nature, loving noise and wine; And, tipsy, half the time goes reeling round, Leaning on old Silenus' shoulders fat. But I have scores of songs that no one knows, Not even Apollo, no, nor Mercuryâ Their strings can never sing like my sweet pipesâ Some, that will make fierce tigers rub their fur Against the oak-trunks for delight, or stretch Their flat sides for my pillow on the sward. Some, that will make the satyrs' clattering hoofs Leap when they hear, and from their noonday dreams Start up to stamp a wild and frolic dance In the green shadows. Ay! and better songs, Made for the delicate nice ears of nymphs, Which while I sing my pipes shall imitate The droning bass of honey-seeking bees, The tinkling tenor of clear pebbly streams, The breezy alto of the alders' sighs, And all the airy sounds that lull the grove When noon falls fast asleep among the hills. Not only these,âfor I can pipe to you Songs that will make the slippery vipers pause, And stay the stags to gaze with their great eyes; Such songsâand you shall hear them, if you willâ That Bacchus' self would give his hide to hear. If you'll but love me, every day I'll bring The coyest flowers, such as you never saw, To deck you with. I know their secret nooksâ They cannot hide themselves away from Pan. And you shall have rare garlands; and your bed Of fragrant mosses shall be sprinkled o'er With violets like your eyesâjust for a kiss. Love me, and you shall do whate'er you like, And shall be tended wheresoe'er you go, And not a beast shall hurt youânot a toad But at your bidding give his jewel up. The speckled shining snakes shall never bite, But twist like bracelets round your rosy arms, And keep your bosom cool in the hot noon. You shall have berries ripe of every kind, And luscious peaches, and wild nectarines, And sun-flecked apricots, and honeyed dates, And wine from bee-stung grapes drunk with the sun (Such wine as Bacchus never tasted yet). And not a poisonous plant shall have the power To tetter your white flesh, if you'll love Pan. And then I'll tell you tales that no one knows; Of what the pines talk in the summer nights When far above you hear them murmuring As they sway whispering to the lifting breezeâ And what the storm shrieks to the struggling oaks As it flies through them hurrying to the sea From mountain crags and cliffs. Or, when you 're sad, I'll tell you tales that solemn cypresses Have murmured to me. There 's not anything Hid in the woods and dales and dark ravines, Shadowed in dripping caves, or by the shore, Slipping from sight, but I can tell to you. Plump, dull-eared Bacchus, thinking of himself, Never can catch a syllable of this; But with my shaggy ear against the grass I hear the secrets hidden underground, And know how in the inner forge of Earth, The pulse-like hammers of creation beat. Old Pan is ugly, rough, and rude to see, But no one knows such secrets as old Pan. What shall I give you for a kiss? I must, Will have it. See, these iris-colored shells, So curiously veined with gleamy pearlâ Rare shells, that Venus covets, and would give A thousand kisses forâshall all be yours;â And these great pearls too, and red coral beads, Worn round by the smooth sea,âyou shall have all. Strung on your neck, and, rolling there between Your budding breasts, how pretty they will look! Do not refuse old Pan one kiss. By Zeus, How beautiful this soft and waving hair (Not like my bristling curls)!âhow it creeps round Your shining shoulders, by the zephyr stirred, As if it loved them! I can scarcely keep My fingers from those shoulders' sweeps and curves. My arms desire to clasp that lithe slight waist. One kissâone kissâI willânay, throw not back That chin and throat, and, with that rosy mouth, Laugh as you push me off. I mustâI will. You make me mad. My very fingers itch. Come, or I'll butt my head against this tree, And poor old Pan's pipes will be heard no more. Don't laugh at me, and kick me in the breast With those white feet; I'll bite them if you do! You wilful minx, have pity on old Panâ Have pity, or I'll seize you round the waist, And, whether you will or not, I'll have my kiss. CLEOPATRA. DEDICATED TO J. L. M. Here, Charmian, take my bracelets, They bar with a purple stain My arms; turn over my pillowsâ They are hot where I have lain: Open the lattice wider, A gauze on my bosom throw, And let me inhale the odours That over the garden blow. I dreamed I was with my Antony, And in his arms I lay; Ah, me! the vision has vanishedâ The music has died away. The flame and the perfume have perishedâ As this spiced aromatic pastille That wound the blue smoke of its odour Is now but an ashy hill. Scatter upon me rose-leaves, They cool me after my sleep, And with sandal odours fan me Till into my veins they creep; Reach down the lute, and play me A melancholy tune, To rhyme with the dream that has vanished, And the slumbering afternoon. There, drowsing in golden sunlight, Loiters the slow smooth Nile, Through slender papyri, that cover The wary crocodile. The lotus lolls on the water, And opens its heart of gold, And over its broad leaf-pavement Never a ripple is rolled. The twilight breeze is too lazy Those feathery palms to wave, And yon little cloud is as motionless As a stone above a grave. Ah, me! this lifeless nature Oppresses my heart and brain! Oh! for a storm and thunderâ For lightning and wild fierce rain! Fling down that luteâI hate it! Take rather his buckler and sword, And crash them and clash them together Till this sleeping world is stirred. Hark! to my Indian beautyâ My cockatoo, creamy white, With roses under his feathersâ That flashes across the light. Look! listen! as backward and forward To his hoop of gold he clings, How he trembles, with crest uplifted, And shrieks as he madly swings! Oh, cockatoo, shriek for Antony! Cry, âCome, my love, come home!â Shriek, âAntony! Antony! Antony!â Till he hears you even in Rome. Thereâleave me, and take from my chamber That stupid little gazelle, With its bright black eyes so meaningless, And its silly tinkling bell! Take him,âmy nerves he vexes,â The thing without blood or brain,â Or, by the body of Isis, I'll snap his thin neck in twain! Leave me to gaze at the landscape Mistily stretching away, Where the afternoon's opaline tremors O'er the mountains quivering play; Till the fiercer splendour of sunset Pours from the west its fire, And melted, as in a crucible, Their earthy forms expire; And the bald blear skull of the desert With glowing mountains is crowned, That burning like molten jewels Circle its temples round. I will lie and dream of the past time, Ãons of thought away, And through the jungle of memory Loosen my fancy to play; When, a smooth and velvety tiger, Ribbed with yellow and black, Supple and cushion-footed I wandered, where never the track Of a human creature had rustled The silence of mighty woods, And, fierce in a tyrannous freedom, I knew but the law of my moods. The elephant, trumpeting, started, When he heard my footstep near, And the spotted giraffes fled wildly In a yellow cloud of fear. I sucked in the noontide splendour, Quivering along the glade, Or yawning, panting, and dreaming, Basked in the tamarisk shade, Till I heard my wild mate roaring, As the shadows of night came on, To brood in the trees' thick branches And the shadow of sleep was gone; Then I roused, and roared in answer, And unsheathed from my cushioned feet My curving claws, and stretched me, And wandered my mate to greet. We toyed in the amber moonlight, Upon the warm flat sand, And struck at each other our massive armsâ How powerful he was and grand! His yellow eyes flashed fiercely As he crouched and gazed at me, And his quivering tail, like a serpent, Twitched curving nervously. Then like a storm he seized me, With a wild triumphant cry, And we met, as two clouds in heaven When the thunders before them fly. We grappled and struggled together, For his love like his rage was rude; And his teeth in the swelling folds of my neck At times, in our play, drew blood. Often another suitorâ For I was flexile and fairâ Fought for me in the moonlight, While I lay couching there, Till his blood was drained by the desert; And, ruffled with triumph and power, He licked me and lay beside me To breathe him a vast half-hour. Then down to the fountain we loitered, Where the antelopes came to drink; Like a bolt we sprang upon them, Ere they had time to shrink, We drank their blood and crushed them, And tore them limb from limb, And the hungriest lion doubted Ere he disputed with him. That was a life to live for! Not this weak human life, With its frivolous bloodless passions, Its poor and petty strife! Come to my arms, my hero, The shadows of twilight grow, And the tiger's ancient fierceness In my veins begins to flow. Come not cringing to sue me! Take me with triumph and power, As a warrior storms a fortress! I will not shrink or cower. Come, as you came in the desert, Ere we were women and men, When the tiger passions were in us, And love as you loved me then! MARCUS ANTONIUS. DEDICATED TO L. C. 'T is vain, Fonteus!âAs the half-tamed steed, Scenting the desert, lashes madly out, And strains and storms and struggles to be freed, Shaking his rattling harness all aboutâ So, fiercer for restraint, here in my breast Hot passion rages, firing every thought; For what is honour, prudence, interest, To the wild strength of love? Oh best of life, My joy, hope, triumph, glory, my soul's wife, My Cleopatra! I desire thee so That all restraint to the wild winds I throw. Come what come will, come life, come death, to me, 'T is equal, if again I look on thee. Away, Fonteus! tell her that I rage With madness for her. Nothing can assuage The strong desire, the torment, the fierce stress That whirls my thoughts round, and inflames my brain, But her great ardent eyesâdark eyes, that draw My being to them with a subtle law And an almost divine imperiousness. Tell her I do not live until I feel The thrill of her wild touch, that through each vein Electric shoots its lightning; and again Hear those low tones of hers, although they steal As by some serpent-charm my will away, And wreck my manhood. Ah! Octavia, This lying galls meâthis poor mean pretense Of loveâthis putting every word to schoolâ When all at best is blank indifference. Even hate for you is only cold and dullâ I hate you that I cannot hate you more, Were you but savage, wicked to the core, Less pious, prudish, prudent, made to rule, I might have loved or hated more; but now Nothing on earth seems half so deadly chill As your insipid smile and placid brow, Your glacial goodness and proprieties. Tell my dear serpent I must see herâfill My eyes with the glad light of her great eyes, Though death, dishonour, anything you will, Stand in the way! Ay, by my soul! disgrace Is better in the sun of Egypt's face Than pomp or power in this detested place. Oh for the wine my queen alone can pour From her rich nature! Let me starve no more On this weak tepid drink that never warms My life-blood: but away with shams and forms! Away with Rome! One hour in Egypt's eyes Is worth a score of Roman centuries. Away, Fonteus! Tell her, till I see Those eyes I do not liveâthat Rome to me Is hateful,âtell herâoh! I know not whatâ That every thought and feeling, space and spot, Is like an ugly dream, where she is not; All persons plagues; all living wearisome; All talking empty; all these feasts and friendsâ These slaves and courtiers, princes, palacesâ This CÃ¦sar, with his selfish aims and ends, His oily ways and sleek hypocrisiesâ This Lepidus; all this dull Roman brood, And worst of all Octavia, the cold prude, With her meek manners and her voice subduedâ Are bonds and fetters, tedious as disease, Not worth the parings of her finger-nails. Oh for the breath of Egypt!âthe soft nights Of the voluptuous Eastâthe dear delights We tasted thereâthe lotus-perfumed gales That dream along the low shores of the Nile, And softly flutter in the languid sails! Oh for the queen of all!âfor the rich smile That glows like autumn over her dark faceâ For her large natureâher enchanting graceâ Her arms, that are away so many a mile! Away, Fonteus!âlose no hourâmake sailâ Weigh anchor on the instantâwoo a gale To blow you to her. Tell her I shall be Close on your very heels across the sea, Praying that Neptune send me storms as strong As Passion is, to sweep me swift along, Till the white spray sing whistling round my prow, And the waves gurgle 'neath the keel's sharp plough. Fly, fly, Fonteus! When I think of her My soul within my body is astir! My wild blood pulses, and my hot cheeks glow! Love with its madness overwhelms me so That Iâoh! go, I say! Fonteus, go! CASSANDRA. A chronological license has been taken in this poem, which it is hoped will be pardoned in view of the mythical character of the period. DEDICATED TO H. C. Why didst thou lift the veil, beloved one, Divine Apollo, from these human eyes? The phantom forms that from the Future rise Appall me; all in vain I seek to shun This fatal knowledge; horror-struck to see The shadowy shapes of coming destiny Steal forth unsummoned fierce with death and hate, But powerless to avert the doom of Fate. Ah! better blindness, better night, dark night! Better dead loss of that supreme delight, Thy love! better the worst that Time conceals Than all the coming horrors it reveals. Shroud me again in darknessâclose the door Of the dread Futureâtorture me no more With these foul shapes of visionary crimeâ These murders that stare through the veil of time,â These horrorsâdrive these fearful sights away, Or give me power the coming crime to stay. Only in ignorance is joy; to rest In blind fond trust upon the Present's breast. 'T is worse than death, far worse, to see, to know; Take back the gift! We creatures here below Need all our blindness, need the mortal veil Which shuts the Future out, obscures the sense, And hides us from our Fate. Not too much light May man endure. Pure Truth is too intense, It blinds us. Perfect Love at its full height Kills with excess of rapture. We are made With human senses, and we all need here Illusions, veils, a tempering atmosphere, And ignorance to shield us with its shade. The Gods in heaven may see and know, nor fear The face of Fate, serene, beyond all care; But when to us poor mortals they appear, Around your glory they a veil must wear, Or who could look and live? And so to me Divinest of the Gods you came; too bright For all your mortal veil, suffused with light, Radiant with splendours of divinity. Ah! what a price for Love I paid! No more, Since that dread gift, the peace, the tranquil bliss That once in my unburdened heart I bore! No more the careless thoughtless happiness, The maiden hope, the unreasoning faith, the scent Of vague sweet feelings making redolent The inmost chambers of my life; 't is o'erâ Fledâvanished. The soft veil is rent away. Where'er I set my feet on the green grass 'T is stained with blood. The glory of the day Is darkened with foul crimes. The shapes that pass Before my scared and visionary eyes No more are gentle dreams, but ghosts that rise And mock and threaten from the unopened tomb Of the black Future, and with voice of doom, Faint, dim, but horrible, dismay my soul. Hark! as I speakâthose voicesâthat fierce jarâ That murmurous tumult hurrying from afarâ What means it? Close my eyes, my ears control! They come, still nearer, up the sounding stair. What horror now is brooding o'er this place? What dreadful crime? What does Medea there In that dim chamber? See on her dark face And serpent brow, rage, fury, love, despair! What seeks she? There her children are at play Laughing and talking. Not so fierce, I say, You scare them with that passionate embrace! Hark to those footsteps in the hallâthe loud Clear voice of Jason heard above the crowd. Why does she push them now so stern away And listening glance around,âthen fixed and mute, Her brow shut down, her mouth irresolute, Her thin hands twitching at her robes the while, As with some fearful purpose does she stand? Why that triumphant glanceâthat hideous smileâ That poniard hidden in her mantle there, That through the dropping folds now darts its gleam? O Gods! O, all ye Gods! hold back her hand. Spare them! oh spare them! O, Medea, spare! You will not, dare not! ah, that sharp shrill scream! Ah!âthe red bloodâ't is trickling down the floor! Help! help! oh, hide me! Let me see no more! ORESTES. How tranquil is the night! how calm and deep This sacred silence! Not an olive-leaf Is stirring on the slopes; all is asleepâ All silent, save the distant drowsy streams That down the hill-sides murmur in their dreams. The vast sad sky all breathless broods above, And peace and rest this solemn temple steep. Here let us restâit is the hour of loveâ Forgetting human pain and human grief. But see! half-hidden in the columned shade, Who panting stands, with hollow eyes dismayed, That glance around as if they feared to see Some dreaded shape pursuing? Can it be Orestes, with those cheeks so trenched and wornâ That brow with sorrow seamed, that face forlorn? Ay, 't is Orestes! we are not alone. What human place is free from human groan? Ay, 't is Orestes! In the temple there, Refuge he seeks from horror, from despair. Look! where he listens, dreading still to hear The avenging voices sounding in his earâ The awful voices that, by day and night, Pursue relentless his despairing flight. Ah! vain the hope to flee from Nemesis! He startsâagain he hears the horrent hiss Of the fierce Furies through the darkness creep. And list! along the aisles the angry sweep, The hurrying rush of trailing robesâas when, Through shivering pines asleep in some dim glen, Fierce Auster whispers. Yes, even here they chase Their haunted victimâeven this sacred place Stays not their fatal footsteps. As they come, Behold him with that stricken face of doom Fly to the altar, and there falling prone, Strike with his brow Apollo's feet of stone. âSave me!â he cries; âApollo! hear and save; Not even the dead will sleep in their dark grave. They comeâthe Furies! To this tortured breast Not even night, the calm, the peaceful, can give rest. Stretch forth thy hand, great God! and bid them cease. Peace, O Apollo! give the victim peace!â See! the white arm above him seems to wave, And all at once is silent as the grave, And Sleep stoops down with noiseless wings outspread, And brooding hovers o'er Orestes' head; And like a gust that roars along the plain Seaward, and dies far off, so dies the pain, The deep remorse, that long his life hath stung, And he again is guiltless, joyous, young. Again he plays, as in the olden time, Through the cool marble halls, unstained by crime. Hope holds his hands, Joy strikes the sounding strings, Love o'er him fluttering shakes his purple wings, And Sorrow hides her face, and dark Death creeps Into the shade, and every Fury sleeps. Sleep! sleep, Orestes! let thy torments cease! Sleep! great Apollo grants thy prayer for peace. Sleep! while the dreams of youth around thee play, And the fierce Furies rest.âLet us away. PRAXITELES AND PHRYNE. DEDICATED TO R. B. A thousand silent years ago, The twilight faint and pale Was drawing o'er the sunset glow Its soft and shadowy veil; When from his work the Sculptor stayed His hand, and turned to one Who stood beside him, half in shade, Said, with a sigh, â'T is done. âThus much is saved from chance and change, That waits for me and thee; Thus muchâhow little!âfrom the range Of Death and Destiny. âPhryne, thy human lips shall pale, Thy rounded limbs decay,â Nor love nor prayers can aught avail To bid thy beauty stay; âBut there thy smile for centuries On marble lips shall live,â For Art can grant what Love denies, And fix the fugitive. âSad thought! nor age nor death shall fade The youth of this cold bust; When this quick brain and hand that made, And thou and I art dust! âWhen all our hopes and fears are dead, And both our hearts are cold, And love is like a tune that 's played, And life a tale that 's told, âThis senseless stone, so coldly fair, That love nor life can warm, The same enchanting look shall wear, The same enchanting form. âIts peace no sorrow shall destroy; Its beauty age shall spare The bitterness of vanished joy, The wearing waste of care. âAnd there upon that silent face Shall unborn ages see Perennial youth, perennial grace, And sealed serenity. âAnd strangers, when we sleep in peace, Shall say, not quite unmoved, âSo smiled upon Praxiteles The Phryne whom he loved!ââ CHERSIPHRON. When to their utmost we have tasked our powers, And Nemesis still frowns and shakes her head; When, wearied out and baffled, we confess Our utter weakness, and the tired hand drops, And Hope flees from us, and in blank despair We sink to earth, the face so stern before August will smileâthe hand before withdrawn Reach out the help we vainly plead for, Take up our task, and in a moment do What all our strength was powerless to achieve. Unless the Gods smile, human toil is vain. The crowning blessing of all work is drawn Not from ourselves, but from the powers above. And this none better knew then Chersiphron, When on the plains of Ephesus he reared The splendid temple built to Artemis. With patient labour he had placed at last The solid jambs on either side the door,â And now for many a weary day he strove With many a plan and many a fresh device, Still seeking and still failing, on these jambs Level to lay the lintel's massive weight. Still it defied him,âand worn out at last, Along the steps he laid him down at night. Sleep would not come. With dull distracting pain The problem hunted through his feverish thoughts, Till in his dark despair he longed for Death, And threatened his own life with his own hand. Peace came at last upon himâand he slept; And in his sleep before his dreaming eyes He saw the form divine of Artemis: O'er him she bent, and smiled, and softly said, âLive, Chersiphron! Who labour for the Gods, The Gods reward. Behold, your work is done!â Then, like a mist that melts into the sky, She vanishedâand awaking, he beheld, Laid by her hand above the entrance-door, The ponderous lintel level on the jambs. TANTALUS. I at the banquet of the Gods have sate Above the clouds that shroud these earthly plains, Their nectar quaffed, and their ambrosia ate, And felt the Olympian ichor in my veins. Apollo, like a glory in a gloom, Jove's thund'rous brow, and Juno's face serene, Chaste Dian's grace,âthe auroral blush and bloom That Venus owns,âthese mortal eyes have seen. Mad with desire I strove the charm to seize That should again renew to sense and soul On earth below those heavenly ecstasiesâ And I their nectar and ambrosia stole. But who against the Gods shall e'er prevail? The bliss of heaven on earth we may not own, Stale tastes the nectar here, the ambrosia stale, The ethereal flavor lost, the aroma flown. And so the Gods condemn me here to stand Thirsting within the stream that from me flees,â Hungering 'mid fruits ambrosial that my hand Forever vainly reaches out to seize. My sense the music of Apollo haunts, But dim and distant and beyond my reach; I hear afar the Gods' grand utterance But cannot shape it into mortal speech. In silence still I feel as in a dream Their dim mysterious whisperings everywhere,â On the lone hills,âin forest, reed, and stream,â In night's low breathings, in the sea's despair. So taunting ever with half-confidence That wins the listening ear, but will not speak, Pleasing and puzzling all the soul and sense, The Gods forever mock us mortals weak. O Poets, in whatever realm or clime, Pity meâTantalusâfor you must feel How nature lures us on with dreams sublime, And hints the secret she will ne'er reveal. PADRE BANDELLI PROSES TO THE DUKE LUDOVICO SFORZA ABOUT LEONARDO DA VINCI. Two steps, your Highnessâlet me go before, And let some light down this dark corridor; Ser Leonardo keeps the only key To the main entrance here so jealously, That we must creep in at this secret door If we his great Cenacolo would see. The work shows talentâthat I must confess; The heads, too, are expressive, every one; But, with his idling and fastidiousness, I fear his picture never will be done. I pray your Highness' pardon for my zealâ Were it for sake of us poor Frati here, Despite the inconvenience we must feel, Kept out from our refectory now a year And eight long months (though that, of course, for us Whose lives to mortify the flesh are vowed, Even to mention seems ridiculous)â Were it for us alone, we all had bowed; But when we see your Highness set at nought, Who ordered this great picture to be wrought, We cannot rest content, for well we know What duty to our gracious prince we owe. And I, the unworthy prior hereâ(God knows How much I feel my own unworthiness, But He hath power the meanest hand to bless; And if our convent prospereth in aught, Not mine, but His, the praise, who all bestows)â But being the prior and the head, and so Charged to your interests, and theirs, I thought My dutyâan unpleasant one, in soothâ Was simply to acquaint you with the truth, And pray your Highness with your eyes to see How things go on in our refectory; And then your Highness only has to say Unto this painterââSir, no more delay!â And all is done, for you he must obey. 'T is twenty months since first upon the wall This Leonardo smoothed his plaster; then He spent two months ere he began to scrawl His figures, which were scarcely outlined, when, Seized by some mad whim, he erased them all. As he began the first month that he came, So he went on, month after month the same. At times, when he had worked from morn to night For weeks and weeks on some apostle's head, In one hour, as it were from sudden spite, He 'd wipe it out. When I remonstrated, Saying, âSer Leonardo, you erase More than you leaveâthat 's not the way to paint; Before you finish we shall all be dead;â Smiling, he turns (he has a pleasant face, Though he would try the patience of a saint With all his wilful ways), and calmly said, âI wiped it out because it was not right; I wish it had been, for your sake, no less Than for this pious convent's; and indeed, The simple truth, good Padre, to confess, I 've not the least objection to succeed: But I must please myself as well as you, Since I must answer for the work I do.â There was St. John's head: that I verily thought He 'd never finish. Twenty times at least I thought it done, but still he wrought and wrought, Defaced, remade, until at last he ceased To work at allâwent off and locked the doorâ Was gone three daysâthen came and sat before The picture full an hourâthen calmly rose And scratched out in a trice mouth, eyes, and nose. This is sheer folly, as it seems to me, Or worse than folly. Does your Highness pay A fixed sum to himâso much every day? If so, the reason 's very clear to see. No? Then his brain is touched assuredly. At last, however, as you see, 't is doneâ All but our Lord's head, and the Judas there. A month ago he finished the St. John, And has not touched it since, that I'm aware; And now, he neither seems to think or care About the rest, but wanders up and down The cloistered gallery in his long dark gown, Picking the black stones out to step upon; Or through the garden paces listlessly With eyes fixed on the ground, hour after hour, While now and then he stoops and picks a flower, And smells it, as it were, abstractedly. What he is doing is a plague to me! Sometimes he stands before yon orange-pot, His hands behind him, just as if he saw Some curious thing upon its leaves; and then, With a quick glance, as if a sudden thought Had struck his mind, there, standing on the spot, He takes a little tablet out to draw, Then, muttering to himself, walks on again. He is the very oddest man of men! Brother Anselmo tells me that the book ('T was left by chance upon the bench one day, And in its leaves our brother got a look) Is scribbled over with all sorts of things,â Notes about colours, how to mix and lay, With plans of flying figures, frames for wings, Caricatures and forts and scaffoldings. The skeletons of men and beasts and birds, Engines, and cabalistic signs and words, Some written backwards, notes of music, lyres, And wheels with boilers under them and fires, A sort of lute made of a horse's skull, Sonnets, and other idle scraps of rhyme,â Of things like this the book was scribbled full. I pray your Highness, now, is this the way, Instead of painting every day all day, For him to trifle with our precious time? Ah! there he is nowâWould your Highness look Behind that pillar in the furthest nook, That is his velvet cap and flowing robe. See how he pulls his beard, as up and down He seems to count the stones he treads upon! 'T would irk the patience of the good man Job To see him idling thus his time away, As if our Lord and Judas both were done, And there was nought to do but muse and stray Along the cloisters. May I dare to pray Your Highness would vouchsafe one word to say; For when I speak he only answers me, âPadre Bandelli, go and say your massâ That 's what you understandâand let me pass; I am not idle, though I seem to be.â âNot idle! then I'm nothing but an ass.â Thus once I spoke, for he annoyed me so; At which he answered, smiling, âOh no, no: Padre, you 're very wise, as all men know.â I mention this to show what pleasant ways This painter has, and not that I the praise Accepted as at all deserved by me. God save us from vain pride, and help us through Our daily work in due humility! Not mine the praise for what I have, for He Hath given all! So I began anew: âNot idle! Well, I know not what you do! You do not paint our picture, that I see.â To which he said, âA picture is not wrought By hands alone, good Padre, but by thought. In the interior life it first must start, And grow to form and colour in the soul; There once conceived and rounded to a whole, The rest is but the handicraft of art. While I seem idle, then my soul creates; While I am painting, then my hand translates.â Now this, I say, is nonsense, sheer enough, Or else a metaphysical excuse For idleness, and he should not abuse Your Highness by this sort of canting stuff. Look at him, sauntering there in his long dressâ If he is working, what is idleness? Not there, your Highness,âon the other side Our painter 's walking; he you look at now Is a poor brother, pious, void of pride, Who there performs a penitential vow. He, like Ser Leonardo, does not stroll Idly, but as he walks recites his prayers, And reads his breviary; and he wears A haircloth 'neath his serge to save his soul. Ah! weak is man, he falls in many snares; And we with prayer must work, would we control Those idle thoughts were Satan sows his tares. But, as I was observing, there have passed Some twenty long and weary months since he First turned us out of our refectory, And who knows how much longer this may last? Yet if our painter worked there steadily, I would say nothing; but the work stands still, While he goes idling round the cloisters' shade. Pleasant enough for himâbut is he paid For idle dreaming thoughts, or work and skill? I crave your pardon; if I speak amiss, Your Highness will, I hope, allowance make That I have spoken for your Highness' sake, And not that us it inconveniences, Although it is a scandal to us all To see this picture half-done on the wall. A word from your most gracious lips, I feel, Would greatly quicken Ser Leonardo's zeal, And we should soon see o'er our daily board, The Judas finished, and our blessed Lord. But he approaches, in his hand the book; Into its pages should your Highness look, They would amuse you by their strange devices. Your gracious presence now he recognizes; That smile and bow and lifted cap I see Are for his Prince and Patron, not for me. LEONARDO DA VINCI POETIZES TO THE DUKE IN HIS OWN DEFENCE. Padre Bandelli, then, complains of me Because, forsooth, I have not drawn a line Upon the Saviour's head; perhaps, then, he Could without trouble paint that head divine. But think, O Signor Duca, what should be The pure perfection of our Saviour's faceâ What sorrowing majesty, what noble grace, At that dread moment when He brake the bread, And those submissive words of pathos said, âBy one among you I shall be betrayed,ââ And say if 't is an easy task to find, Even among the best that walk this earth, The fitting type of that divinest worth, That has its image solely in the mind. Vainly my pencil struggles to express The sorrowing grandeur of such holiness. In patient thought, in ever-seeking prayer, I strive to shape that glorious face within, But the soul's mirror, dulled and dimmed by sin, Reflects not yet the perfect image there. Can the hand do before the soul has wrought? Is not our art the servant of our thought? And Judas, too,âthe basest face I see Will not contain his utter infamy; Among the dregs and offal of mankind, Vainly I seek an utter wretch to find. He who for thirty silver coins would sell His Lord must be the Devil's miracle. Padre Bandelli thinks it easy is To find the type of him who with a kiss Betrayed his Lord. Well, what I can I'll do; And if it please his reverence and you, For Judas' face I'm willing to paint his. Padre Bandelli is a sort of man, Joking apart, whose little round of thought Is like his life, the measure of a span. He knows and does the duties he is taught,â Prays, preaches, eats, and sleeps in dull content; Does the day's work, and deems it excellent; Says he 's a sinner, but we 're sinners all, And puts his own sin down to Adam's fall. Christ, at the last day, others may reject,â Poor painters, or great dukes with their state cares; But that, with all his masses, fasts, and prayers, A convent's prior should not be elect, Padre Bandelli has not half a doubtâ 'T were a strange heaven, indeed, with him left out. Him the imagination does not tease With hungry cravings, restless impulses; Him no despairing days the Furies bring, No torturing doubts, no anxious questioning; But day by day his ordered time is spent, Pacing his petty round of fixed routine. How should he know the artist's strain within, His vexing and fastidious discontent? Art he considers as a sort of trade, Like laying bricks: If one can lay a yard In one good hour, how can it be so hard In two good hours, that two yards should be laid? But, Signor Duca, you can apprehend The artist's soulâhow there is ne'er an end Of climbing fancies, longings, and desires, That burn within him like consuming fires; How Beauty beckons, and tormenting flees Just as his hand her shadowy shape would seize. How sweet and fair the inward vision gleams! How dull and base the painted copy seems! We are like Danaus' daughtersâall in vain We strive to fill our vases. Human art Through myriad leaks lets out the spirit's part, And nothing but the earthly dregs remain. But who can force the spirit to conceive? Its lofty empire is above our will: Trained though we be, we only can fulfil Its orders, and a joyous welcome give. Oft when the music waits, the room is decked, And hope looks out from the expectant breast, Vainly we wait to greet the invited guest. Oft when its presence least our souls expect, Sudden, unsummoned, there it stands, as Eve Stood before Adam,âas in twilight sky The first young star,âhalf joy, half mystery. The wilful work built by the conscious brain Is but the humble handicraft of art; It has its growth in toil, its birth in pain. The Imagination, silent and apart Above the Will, beyond the conscious eye, Fashions in joyous ease and as in play Its fine creations,âmixing up alway The real and the ideal, heaven and earth, Darkness and sunshine; and then, pushing forth Sudden upon the field of consciousness Its world of wonder, leaves to us the stress, By patient art, to copy its pure grace, And catch the perfect features of its face. From hand to spirit must the human chain Be closely linked, and thence to the divine Stretch up, through feeling, its electric line, To draw heaven down, or all our art is vain. For in its loftiest mood the soul obeys A higher power that shapes our thoughts, and sways Their motions, when by love and strong desire We are uplifted. From a source unknown The power descendsâwith its ethereal fire Inflames usânot possessing but possessed We do its bidding; but we do not own The grace that in those happy hours is given, More than its strings the music of the lyreâ More than the shower the rainbow lent by heaven. Nature and man are only organ-keysâ Mere soundless pipesâdespite our vaunted skillâ Till, with its breath, the power above us fill The stops, and touch us to its harmonies. O Signor Duca, as the woman bears Her child, not in a moment nor a day, So doth the soul the germ that God doth lay Within it, with as many pains and cares. From the whole being it absorbs and draws Its form and lifeâon all we are and see It feeds by subtle sympathetic laws; Each sense it stirs, it fires each faculty To hunt the outer world, and thence to seize Food for assimilation. By degrees Perfect grows at last in every part, And then is born into the world of art. In facile natures fancies quickly grow, But such quick fancies have but little root. Soon the narcissus flowers and dies, but slow The tree whose blossoms shall mature to fruit. Grace is a moment's happy fortune, Power A life's slow growth; and we for many an hour Must strain and toil, and wait and weep, if we The perfect fruit of all we are would see. Therefore I wait. Within my earnest thought For years upon this picture I have wrought, Yet still it is not ripe; I dare not paint Till all is ordered and matured within. Hand-work and head-work have an earthly taint, But when the soul commands I shall begin. On themes like these I should not dare to dwell With our good Priorâthey to him would be Mere nonsense; he must touch and taste and see; And facts, he says, are never mystical. Now, the fact is, our worthy Prior says, The convent is annoyed by my delays; Nor can he see why I for hours and days Should muse and dream and idle here around. I have not made a face he has not found Quite good enough before it was half-done. âDon't bother more,â he says, âlet it alone.â What can one say to such a connoisseur? How could a Prior and a critic err? But, not to be more tedious, I confess I am disturbed to think I so distress The worthy Prior. Yet 't were wholly vain To him an artist's feelings to explain; But, Signor Duca, you will understand, And so I treat on higher themes with you. The work you order I shall strive to do With all my soul, not merely with my hand. A CONTEMPORARY CRITICISM: IN WHICH FEDERIGO DI MONTAFELTRO, DUKE OF URBINO, GIVES HIS VIEWS OF RAFFAELLE. DEDICATED TO H. G. W. Oh! I admit his talent,âthere's no lack Of facile talent; what in him I blame Is that he travels in his master's track With such a slavish, imitative aim. 'T is Perugino all, from head to foot: Angels the same, with their affected grace, Playing the lyre with sideway upturned face; Round-faced, small-eyed Madonnas,âall the same. Landscapes mere copies; subjects, branch and root, His master's subjects,ânot an arch or shaft Of all his architecture, but you see That too is copied. Every little shoot Upon his genius is his master's graft. And yet, through all, there 's clear ability. Why will he never grow his special fruit? Lately he 's striven to effect a change, But still an imitator he must go, From peaceful Perugino's timid range To the extravagance of Angelo, Behind them both, of course, in both their ways; For, as uncompromising Michael says, âWho follows after, cannot go before.â Then why, too, will he try so many things? Instead of sticking to one single art, He must be studying music, twanging strings, And writing sonnets, with their âheart and dart.â Lately, he 's setting up for architect, And planning palaces; and, as I learn, Has made a statue,âevery art in turn,â Like Leonardo (and you recollect, How with his many arts even he was wrecked); But if he failed, what can this youth expect? A touch of this same vice his father had: He laid aside the brush to use the pen; And though he praised my deeds,âand I, of men, Should be the last to call the praising bad, Though overpraised,âyet, be the truth confest, No man in more than one art can be best. 'T was but the other day I spoke to him, With earnest hope to make him change his course; I told him he would dissipate his force By following the lead of every whim, And (for I like the youth, and recognize In all his efforts good abilities) I urged upon him not to skip and skim In many arts, but give himself to one, For life was quite too short for everything, And doing all things, nothing gets well done. He thanked me for my kindness, disagreed With my conclusions in a modest way (He 's modest, that 't is only just to say); But in a letter that he sends to-day Here is his answer. Listen, while I read. âMost noble sir,ââand so on, and so on,â âA thousand thanks,ââhemâhem,ââin one so high,â âLearned in art,ââet cetera,ââI shall tryââ Oh! that 's about his picture,ââcritic's eye;â âPatron,ââpho, phoâwhere has the passage gone? Ah! here we come to it at last: âYou thought,â He says, âthat in too many arts I wrought; And you advised me to stick close to one. Thanks for your gracious counsel, all too kind; And answering, if I chance to speak my mind Too boldly, pardon. Yet it seems to me All arts are one,âall branches on one tree; All fingers, as it were, upon one hand. You ask me to be thumb alone; but pray, Reft of the answering fingers Nature planned, Is not the hand deformed for work or play? Or rather take, to illustrate my thought, Music, the only art to science wrought, The ideal art, that underlies the whole, Interprets all, and is of all the soul. Each art is, so to speak, a separate tone; The perfect chord results from all in one. Strike one, and as its last vibrations die, Listen,âfrom all the other tones a cry Wails forth, half-longing and half-prophecy. So does the complement, the hint, the germ Of every art within the others lie, And in their inner essence all unite; For what is melody but fluid form, Or form, but fixed and stationed melody? Colours are but the silent chords of light, Touched by the painter into tone and key, And harmonized in every changeful hue. So colours live in sound,âthe trumpet blows Its scarlet, and the flute its tender blue; The perfect statue, in its pale repose, Has for the soul a melody divine, That lingers dreaming round each subtle line, And stills the gazer lest its charm he lose. So rhythmic words, strung by the poet, own Music and form and colourâevery sense Rhymes with the rest;â't is in the means alone The various arts receive their difference.â Vague, idle talk! such stuff as this I call; Pretty for girlsâquite metaphysical, Almost poetic, if you will; but then, For you and me, or any reasoning men, All visionary, vague, impractical. Such silly jargon lacks all common-sense; How can he dream it helps him paint, to know The way to tinkle on ten instruments? Or does he fancy writing rhymes assists In laying colours? Bah! he 's in the mists. But let 's go on. Here 's something, I admit, That shows a less deficiency of wit. âLife is too short perfection to attain. We all are maimed; and do the best we can, Each trade deforms us with the overstrain Of some too favoured faculty or sense, O'er-fostered at the others' vast expense. Yet why should one Art be the others' bane? The perfect artist should be perfect man. Oh! let at least our theory be grand, To make a whole man, not to train a hand; Rearing our temple, let it be our pride Nought to neglect, but build with patient care A perfect temple, finished everywhere, And not a mere faÃ§ade with one good side.â Of course, of course, if we were gods; but then, Life is so short, and we are only men. These youths, these youthsâthere 's really something great In their ambitions. Let our friend but wait, And Time will snuff his dreams out, one by one. I had such dreams once. How they all have gone! âIf I the model of a man should seek, Where should I find him? Though the black-smith's arm Is muscled well, his lower limbs are weak, His shoulders curved. The student shall I take? His o'erworked brain has cost his body harm. No; he alone will serve who equal strain Has given each, the body and the brain; One who, like you, most gracious Duke, has known The whole man into consonance to train. Grace from consent of every force is shown, Not where one's loss has been another's gain.â Well put, my Raffaelle; it will never do To such an argument to say, âNot true.â âBesides, the varied tasking of the mind Not only makes us sane, but keeps us strong. The noblest faculty when strained too long Turns to convention,âwearied, seeks to find In repetition solace and repose. 'T is only the fresh arm that strikes great blows. Fallow and change we need, not constant toil, Not always the same crop on the same soil. To stretch our powers demands an earnest strain. And rest, to strengthen what by work we gain. Sleeping, the body grows in thews and brain.â That 's true, at leastâthe body must have sleep! I'm glad to find one statement here at last With which I can most cordially agree. Shall I read more, or is your patience past? Oh!âas to his originality, Here are a few words taken from a heap. One moment first,âhere 's something not to skip. âBut please remember, of the famous names, Who is there hath confined him to one art,â Giotto, Da Vinci, or Orcagna? No,â Or our great living master, Angelo,â These are whole men, whose rounded knowledge shames Our narrow study of a single part; Not merely painters, dwarfed in all their aims, But men who painted, builded, carved, and wrote: Whole diapasonsânot a separate note.â Now for that other passage,âlet us see His thoughts about originality. âIn one sense no man is original,â Borrowers and beggars are we, one and all. Art, Science, Thought, grow up from age to age, And all are palimpsests upon Time's page. Our loftiest pedestals are tombs;âthe seed Sown by the dead and living in us grow; And what we are is tinged by what we know. As from the air our sustenance we draw, So from all thought our private thought we feed, Germs strewn from other minds within us breed, And no one is his own unaided law. Nor from the age alone we take our hue, But by the narrower mould of accident A form and colour to our life is lent; As under blue sky grows the water blue, Or clouds unto the mountain's shape are bent. âYet each man, following his sympathies, Unto himself assimilating all, Using men's thoughts and forms as steps to rise, Who speaks at last his individual word, The free result of all things seen and heard, Is in the noblest sense original. Each to himself must be his final rule, Supreme dictator, to reject or use, Employing what he takes but as his tool. But he who, self-sufficient, dares refuse All aid of men, must be a god or fool. âI took Lippino's figure for St. Paul: What then? I made it, in the taking, mine, And gave it new life in a new design. I worked in Perugino's style, but all My own my pictures were in every line. By sympathy of feeling and of thought, Not coldly copying, in his forms I wrought. The theme of the Entombment, I admit, Was from an old sarcophagus of stone; But to another purpose using it, Its new expression made it all my own. From all great men and minds I freely learn, Orcagna, Giotto, Michael, each in turn, Thank them for help, and taking what I find, Stamp on their forms the pressure of my mind. Well! who that ever lived did not the same? Name me of all the great names but one nameâ Old Homer? Phidias? Virgil?âand more low In time, not power, Da Vinci? Angelo? 'T is the small nature dares not to receive, Having no wealth within from which to give. The greatest minds the greatest debts may owe, And by their taking make a thing to live. âDid our Da Vinci scorn, with studious zeal, Masaccio's nature, Lippi's strength to steal? Is Giotto's campanile, soaring there Like music up into our Florence air, Unfathered by an ancestry of towers? Or is the round of great St. Peter's dome, That Michael now is swinging over Rome, Without a debt to this grand dome of ours? And Brunelleschi, did he never see The globed Pantheon's massive dignity? These men are copyists, then! But, after all, If these are not, who is original? âLook round upon our Florenceâeach to each See! how her earnest minds and hearts unite, And buttressed thus in strength attain a height Which none could ever hope alone to reach! Or, like a serried phalanx all inspired By one great hope, and moving to one end, How strength and daring each to each they lend, As on they press, undaunted and untired! Each fighting for the truth, and one for all, With no mean pride to be original.â Well! here the true and false are mixed with skill; But let him talk and reason as he will, I'm of the same opinion as before;â A man must strive to be original, And give himself to one art, not to all. Besides, the names and facts he numbers o'er Prove but the rule, being exceptions still. But, after all, the subject is a bore; And, Signor Sanzio, you and all your talk (Which, I'll confess, is not entirely ill) Have our permission to withdraw. Pray walk Upon the balcony. Is any sight More fair than Florence in this hazy light, Sleeping all silent in the afternoon, Like the enchanted beauty, full of rest, Her bride-like veil spread careless on her breast? Our June this year has been a peerless June. IN THE ANTECHAMBER OF MONSIGNORE DEL FIOCCO. Our master will be Cardinal erelongâ Is he not made for one?âso smooth and plump, With those broad jaws, those half-shut peeping eyes, Those ankle-heavy legs and knotty feet, Which only need red stockings. Even now He totters round with the true Cardinal's gait Upon his tender toes, while you behind Demurely follow, scarce an ear-shot off, The pious footsteps of the holy man. How many years have you thus stalked along Behind that broad-brimmed, purple-tasseled hat, In your stiff lace and livery, trained to pause Whene'er he pauses, turning half to fix His Fifthly on his fingers to some dull Cringing Abbate shuffling at his side? Then, when that point is drilled into his brain (Proving the blessedness of poverty, Or how the Devil has no cursed wiles To lure the world to hell like libertyâ The only one great good being obedience), Back go the hands beneath the creased black silk That streams behind, and on you march again; While the gilt carriage lumbers in the rear, And the black stallions nod their tufted crests. Yours is a noble station, clinging there Behind it as you clatter through the town, Your white calves shaking with the pavement's jar, The mark and sneer of half the world you meet. Ah, well! 't is wretched business yours and mine; I know not which is worstâbut then it pays; The cards are dirty, but what matters dirt To those who win? Though now the stakes are small, We'll hold the court-cards when the suit is red;â And so it will be soon; why, even now I seem to see red stockings on his legs;â And yesterday I said, âYour Eminence,â As if I thought he now was Cardinalâ âYour Eminence,â indeed! At that he smiled That oily smile of his, and rubbed his handsâ Those thick fat hands, on which his emerald ring Flashes ('t is worth at least a thousand crowns)â And said, âGood Giacomo, not âEminence,â I'm but a Monsignore, all 's too much For my deserts.â Then I, âYour âReverenceâ Ought to be âEminence,â and will be soon; The tassel 's almost old upon your hat.â âSei matto, Giacomo,â he said, and smiled. You know those smiles, that glitter falsely o'er His smooth broad cheeks, as if he asked of you, âAm I not kind and good?â and all the while Your soul protests, and calls out âKnave and cheat.â But, then, how can one call him by such names, When, even with that smile upon his face, He slips a scudo in one's hand and says, âGo, Giacomo, and drink my health with thisâ? What can one do but bow and try to blush? âOhâReverenzaâthanksâyou are too good.â Dear man! sweet man! in all those troublous times What zeal was his!âhow earnestly he worked! Who can forget his pure self-sacrifice, His virtuous deeds, above this world's rewardâ Done for pure Christian dutyâdone, of course, For Holy Churchâall was for Holy Churchâ (Without a notion of this world's reward)â All for the good of souls and Holy Churchâ (Ora pro nobis, and that sort of thing)â All to bring sinners back again to God, And from the harvest root the devil's taresâ In omnia sÃ¦culaâamenâamen. We don't forgetâwell! you know whom I mean; No need to mention names, though no one 's nigh; We don't forget him whose anointed hands Were flayed by order of his Reverence, Ere with his bleeding palms they led him down Into the court-yard, and we, peeping through The half-closed blind, saw him throw up his hands And forward fall upon his face, and writhe, When the sharp volley rang against the walls. Those oily fingers wrote that sentence down! That thick voice, with a hypocritic tone, While both his palms were raised, decreed that doom. Who could help weeping when that pious man, Professing horror at his victim's crime, And bidding him confess and pray to God, And saying, âGod would pardon him, perhaps, As he himself would, if the power were his, But, being the instrument of Church and State, No choice was given,â with his priestly foot Pushed, you know whom, into a felon's grave? That bloody stain is still upon the walls, Of the same colour as the scarlet hat Our master soon will wear; and, after all, Who more deserves it? If he stained his soul, Is not the labourer worthy of his hire? He shall be raised who doth abase himself! The good and faithful servant shall be made The ruler over many! Ah! my friend, He nothing lost by all those deeds of his. He erred in zeal, but zeal is not a viceâ 'T was all for Holy Church. His secret life, Perhaps, was not quite perfect? Who of you Is without sin let him first cast a stone;â No one, you see; so let us think no more Of that. Does any Duchess smile the less At all his compliments and unctuous words As, leaning o'er her chair, his downcast eyes He fixes somewhat lower than her lips,â Upon the jewels on her neck, perchance, He is so modest,âand with undertone Whispers, and, deprecating, lifts his hands, While with her fan she covers half her face? He knows as well as any man that lives How far to venture;âcovers his foul jokes With honeyed words, so ladies swallow them;â Treads on the edge of scandalânot a chance He will fall in; knows all the secret shoals Of innuendo;âin pure earnestness (Oh, nothing more) he seizes their soft hands And holds themâpresses them, as to enforce His argument;âfor this, our Monsignore, Lifted above temptation, with, of course, No carnal thought, may do before the worldâ Because it must be done through innocence. Fie on his foul mouth who should hint 't was wrong! Who 'd be more shock'd than he, the pious man? He would go home and pray for that lost soul! And yet, how can a woman pure in heart, Without disgust, accept his compliments, And let him feed on her his gloating eyes? Of course, it 's just because she 's innocent. Yes! I am lean and dry, a servitor, Not fat and oily like his Reverence, And so I can't endure his nauseous ways;â All right, of course! But yet I sometimes think, Did San Pietro talk to Martha thus, And every night, wearing his fisherman's ring, Show his silk-stocking'd legs in soft saloons, And fish for women with a net like this? Those soft fat handsâthose sweet anointed handsâ Those hands that wear the glittering emerald ringâ Those hands whose palms are pressed so oft in prayerâ Those hands that fondle high-born ladies' handsâ Those hands that give their blessing to the poorâ Those hateful, hideous hands are red with blood! Think! Principessa, when you kiss those handsâ Think! Novice, when those hands upon your head Are laid in consecrationâthink of this! Stop, Master Giacomo! don't get too warm! When Monsignore gave you yesterday, With those same hateful, hideous, bloody hands, Your scudo, did you take it, sir, or not? Yes! I confess! the world will be the world! One must not ask too much of mortal man, Nor mortal woman neither, Giacomo! But yet we cannot always keep a curb Upon our feelings, school them as we will; And I, who bow and cringe and smile all day, Detest at times my very self, and grow So restless 'neath my rank hypocrisy, I must break loose and fling out like a horse In useless kicks, or else I should go mad. God knows I hate this man, and so at times, Rather than take him by the throat, I come And pour my passion out in idle words; They ease me. You 're my friend; but if I thought A word of this would reach his ears; but, no! We know each other both too well for that. One or two questions I should like to ask, If Monsignore would but answer them, As thisâwhat Sora Lisa says to him At her confession, once a-week at least (For Monsignore, having her soul in charge, When she don't come to him, must go to her). She used to be so poor, but times are changed, And Sora Lisa keeps her carriage now; And those old gowns, by some âHey, presto, change,â Have turned to rustling silks; and at her ears Diamonds and rubies dangle, which she shows, When she 's the mind, in her own opera box. Well! well! the office that his Reverence Gave her poor husband from pure love of him May pay for these; and if it don't, why then, It don'tâwhat business is it of ours? And then, who knows, some uncle may have died (Uncles are always dying for such folks) And made her rich;âwhy should we peep and pry? With Monsignore her soul is safe at least. And this reminds meâdid you ever know Nina, that tall, majestic, fierce-eyed girl, With blue-black hair, which, when she loosed it, shook Its crimpled darkness almost to the floor?â She that was Monsignore's friend while yet He was a humble AbbÃ©âborn indeed In the same town and came to live in Rome? Not know her? She, I mean, who disappeared Some ten years back, and God knows how or why? Well, Nina,âare you sure there 's no one near?â Ninaâ Per Dio! how his stinging bell Startled my blood, as if his Reverence Cried out, âYou, Giacomo; what, there again At your old trick of talking? Hold your tongue!â And so I will, per Bacco, so I will;â Who tells no secrets breaks no confidence. Nature, as Monsignore often says, Gave us two eyes, two ears, and but one tongue, As if to say, âTell half you see and hear;â And I'm an ass to let my tongue run on, After such lessons. There, he rings again! Vengoâper DioâVengo subito. THE LESSON OF MONSIGNORE GALEOTTO. âNow, certainly, he was a fayre prelat.ââ Chaucer. Let us walk up this alley, in the shade Of the green ilexes, whose boughs have made An arching gallery of cool privacy. The garden 's hotâthe sun has got so high It burns into our faces o'er the wall Of our clipped hedges, and begins to fall So fierce on the white pebbles of the walk, Its glare is painfulâWe shall better talk Beneath the ilexes,âwhere it is cool. Well, as I said, Filippo, you must school Your temper, must not speak so harsh and quick; Men are not driven, ox-like, with a stick, Nor goaded to compliance with our will; They must be humoured, flatteredâseeming still To yield to them, with humble air admit Their power of argument, their sense, their wit,â But, if you might suggest, that so and so, Perhaps, would make a difference, although You would not place at all your casual thought Against their better judgment ... Men are caught By springes like to theseâthey can be tricked Always, by some decoy,âto contradict Is simply stupidâand the dogmatist Makes one, half ready to agree, resist. I cannot bear that sharp decisive way With which you speakâyou think soâbut why say, Though true, exactly what you think or feel; Who plays his cards well, must and should conceal His hand from his antagonist,âand all Are our antagonists in lifeâA brawl Is a fool's madnessâbut, no less a fool Is he who knows not how his tongue to school, So as to seem, at least, to give assent Unto the wit, if not the argument. Silence is goldenâalways seek to know The other's thoughts and views before you show Your ownâyou then have ground whereon to act, Not blindly, but with wisdom's weapon, tact. There is no use to lieâoh, that indeed, In the long run is sure not to succeed; Lying is grossâyet, I am bound to say, That truth sometimes may lead us most astray; When rightly used it is the best of charms, When wrongly, the most dangerous of arms,â Not for all time and placeâfor instance, you Foil your own aims, sometimes, by being true To your quick impulse;âwhere 's the use to speak The truth, when speaking it will make you weak? Wait for occasionâoft with a false key We take the stronghold of the enemy, Which, if we ventured rashly to attack, With angry force would rise to beat us back; Let your mind run before your tongue,âa man Who has a tongue should also have a plan. You are too honest, dear Filippoâtrust The world too freely; you are young, and must Curb those warm impulses that from your heart Start wild, and train them down by thought and art; Must learn your daring spirit to repress; Submit to rule and law, and question less. You claim your single right of thought, deny The Church its dogma and authority, Cry, âTruth is living, absolutely needs Freedom, and only petrifies in creeds;ââ But Truth is not a veering vane, that goes A different way with every wind that blows, A mere kaleidoscopic glass, that takes New hues, new figures, with each hand that shakes. No! but a fountain once to man unsealed, Whose living waters God himself revealed Unto the Church,âwhose forms, like vases, give But shape to the pure waters they receive. You âthink,ââwell, would you with your single thought Reverse what all the Fathers wise have taught, After long centuries' thinking, and confront Your eager judgment to the opposing brunt Of their slow wisdom?âDear Filippo, see How we have thriven on our policy, We work together, not for separate pelf, As you would act, you only for yourself, But to exalt the Churchâthe Church!âis not That thought alone worth every other thought? And you have talents that might raise you high, Will raise you, if you will not so defy Those wise injunctions we must all obey, Hard though it seem at first to all. Pray, pray For more humility. Some future day, When from that brow its curls are worn away, The scarlet cap its baldness shall conceal, The triple crown, perhapsânay! nay! you feel, I know, at present, as all young men do To whom the world and thought itself is new, You would choose rather âLiberty and Truth,â For so you name the Folly we call Youth, Than wed obedience, crush that fierce will down, And hold Rome's keys, and wear the triple crown. Well, 't is a grand ambitionâLiberty, If it were possibleâyet, trust to me, It is not possible;âobedienceâlawâ Self-abnegationâthese alone can draw The whole world after them. Where all agree, Work with one will, one hope, one energy, Blindly obedient, nothing can resist; but what Is Liberty but anarchy of thought,â Each separate will of that great swarming mass You call the people, struggling to surpass All other wills, and in blind ignorance Wantingâyet never knowing what it wants. The beasts alone are free, in your grand sense; But man's true freedom is obedience, Where all wills bend unto a settled law, A single purpose, and together draw For some high objectâAh! your liberty, Filippo dear, is but a troubled sea, Vexed with wild currents, lashed by frequent gales, Where the best ship must down with masts and sails, Fling its rich cargo to the engulfing waves, And creep at last to port, with what it saves. Besides! what gain the nations that are free? Rest, joy, content?âNo, everywhere you see The freest people the unhappiest; Full of desires that goad them from their rest, They crowd, and push, and fight, and end at last In anarchy and luxury;âall the past Tells the same storyâall the future willâ Only the Church abides through good and ill. Compare with this the peaceful, studious life, Leading so softly, undisturbed by strife, To power, for great, good ends, that here we find In the still cloisters of the Church;âthe mind Here stores its thought, here trains its highest powers To highest purposes;âthese lives of ours Fit us to move the world, and with the skill Of subtle thought subdue unto our will Its mighty strength. The worldâthe great brute world, That bends against us its flat bull-front, curled With strength, and bellows, and its great horns shakes, Blind with the dust, deaf with the noise it makes, Is game that we with easy skill control, Sure of our power, and, as we will, cajole, Shaking the scarlet that it hates, and thus Letting it butt a rag instead of us,â Always secure when we would end the play, With our fine rapier point to find the way. You have ambition,âhave it then to rule This worldâto make the beast your game, your tool, To ring his nose, and train him to your hand,â For objects high, of course, we understand. Love! 't is a child's disease, that passes soon, Like mumps or measlesâ't is a little tune We play upon a pipe when we are young,â A honey bee, by which we 're often stung As soon as we have caught it,ânay, to speak In serious phrase, Filippo, it were weak To throw away a life's great hopes for love; I know these hot desires will sometimes prove Too strong for usâthe Church takes note of that, And covers with its veil of silence what It knows weak man will have. It shuts its eyes To human nature's frail necessities. If it be done in seemly secrecy, And without scandal, shall we peep to see Our brother's weakness? Therefore, do not doubt, If you be careful, you may still play out The private rÃ´le of loveâfor it were wise That we should take man in his actual guise; The self-same rule will not apply to men As to pure angels without sinâwhat then? The Church does all it can. These passions, too, Are not without their use, if we subdue Their exercise to proper ends,âand see, They give us oftentimes a secret key To help great projects on. So, as I said, Love is not thoroughly prohibited, Unless it lead to scandal. But, suppose You will have marriage; then, indeed, you close The Church's door, and for a whim, to last A month or so, your future life you blast. Take my advice,âdrain nothing to its lees, Only just tasted pleasures long can please; What we desire is grateful while desired, Possessed, 't is worthlessâAh! we soon grow tired, With the continuous every-day of what Once seemed so charming, when we had it not; And wives, Filippo, wives are ... Hark! 't is noon, The clock struck thenâPer Bacco, boy, how soon This hour has passedâand I shall be too late For the Marchesaâotherwise I'd waitâ She has some scheme I think of charity, On which she wishes to consult with me. Addio, thenâand think on what I 've said,â The heart must be submissive to the head. May, 1855. THE PADRE AND THE NOVICE. DEDICATED TO R. L. I. Do you hear, Lorenzo? I say these wishes and vague desires Will all of them pass away, though now they seem so bright; They are will-o'-the-wisps that breed uncertain treacherous fires: No real lamps that lead the traveller through the night. II. My youth has gone like a song. You heed not an old man's words. Yet once, like you, I was young. Alas! I know it all; And often my memory smites my thoughts, and awakens chords Of far and dim delights, that I tremble as I recall. III. I loved! Ah! yes, I loved with a love that maddened my mindâ With a passion that reason reprovedâI loved, as I pray to God You never may love, my boy; and the storm came down, and the wind, And my hope was crushed, and my joyâas you crush these flowers in the sod. IV. I awokeâas a man may wake from a wild and feverish dreamâ Useless and helplessâa wreck,âwith scarcely the wish or power On the spars of life to drift,âand a fierce regret that the stream, Sweeping to death so swift, had flung me aside for an hour. V. Slowly the world came back; but oh! how changed and drear! The serpent was on its trackâmy spirit was bitter and dark. I rushed to battle;âDeath passed me, shaking his sword and spear, And, scornful, aside he cast me, making the happy his mark. VI. But the savage hate of life died down like a fading flame; And weary and worn with strife, and broken and spent with care,â With a spirit inly stirred, to the convent grate I came, And God in his mercy heard,âand peace returned with prayer. VII. There is peace, that nothing taints, in the life that to God is givenâ To Christ, and the holy saintsâthat minister unto man; For the world is a snare and a lure that leads us away from heaven, And love is a demon impure, that tears us whenever it can. VIII. Ah! flee from the coils it spreads. Oh yield not unto its snare! Gilded at first its threads, in torture at last they end; And Love, like the Sphinx of old, with its bosom and face so fair, Hath arms of the tiger to hold, and claws of the tiger to rend. IX. Look not backâbe advisedâon the path you have chosen so well. The Church is the fold of Christ: the world is the devil's den. Hark! 't is the Angelus, ringing afar from the convent bellâ Ave Maria sanctissima, ora pro nobis.âAmen. L'ABBATE. Were it not for that singular smell That seems to the genus priest to belong, Where snuff and incense are mingled well With a natural odour quite as strong: Were it not for those little ways Of clasped and deprecating hands; And of raising and lowering his eyes always As if he only waited commandsâ Little there is in him of the priest, With only the slightest touch of cant, With a simple, guileless heart in his breast, And a mind as honest as ignorant. Half a child and half a man, Ripe in the Fathers and green in thought, In his little circle of half a span He thinks that he thinks what he was taught. His duty he does to the scruple's weight; Recites his prayers, and mumbles his mass, And without his litanies, early and late, Never permits a day to pass. Look at him there in the garden-plots Repeating his office, as to and fro He paces around the orange-pots, Looking about while his quick lips go. His simple pleasure in simple things, His willing spirit that never tires, His trivial jokes and wonderings, His peaceful temper that never fires, His joy over trifles of every day, The feeble poems he loves to quote,â Are just like a child, with his heart in his play, While his duty and lessons are drill and rote. What life means he does not think; Reason and thought he has been told Only lead to a perilous brink, Away from Christ and the Church's fold. Therefore he humbly and blindly obeys; Does what he 's ordered and reasons not; Performs his prayers, and thinks he prays, And asks not how, or why, or what. Happy in this, why stir his mind, Stagnant in thought although it be? Leave him aloneâhe is gentle and kind, And blest with a child's simplicity. Thinking would only give him unrest, Struggle, and toil, and inward strain; His heart is right in his thoughtless breast, Why should one wish to torment his brain? Yet out of pastime one evil day I unfolded to him Pythagoras' planâ How step by step the soul made its way From sea-anemone up to man,â How onward to higher grades it went, If its human life had been fair and pure; Or if not, to the lower scale was sent, Again to ascend to man, and endure. And so the soul had gleams of the past, And felt in itself dim sympathies With nature, that ended in us at last, And each of whose forms within us lies. He smiled at first, and then by degrees Grew silent and sad, and confessed 't was true, But with spirit so pained and ill at ease, That my foolish work I strove to undo. This thinking 's the spawn of Satan, I said, That tempts us into the sea of doubt; And Satan has endless snares to spread, If once with our reason we venture out. Here you are in your Church like a port, Anchored secure, where never a gale Can break your moorings,ânor even in sport Should you weigh your anchor or spread your sail. So I got him back to his anchor again, And there in the stagnant harbour he lies; And he looks upon me with a sense of pain As a wild freebooter; for to his eyes Free thinking, free sailing seems to be, A sort of a godless, dangerous thing, Like a pirate's life on a stormy seaâ And sure at the last damnation to bring. IL CURATO. DEDICATED TO R. S. There's our good curate coming down the lane, Taking his evening walk as he is wont: 'Neath the dark ilexes he pauses now And looks across the fields; then turning round, As Spitz salutes me with a sharp high bark, Advising him a stranger's near, he stops, Nods, makes a friendly gesture, and then waitsâ His head a little bent aside, one hand Firm on his cane, the other on his hipâ And ere I speak he greets me cheerily. âA lovely evening, and the well-reaped fields Have given abundant harvest. All around They tell me that the grain is large and full; Peasant and landlord both of them content; And with God's blessing we shall have, they say, An ample vintage; scarcely anywhere Are traces of disease among the grapes; The olives promise well, too, as it seems. Good grain, good wine, good oilâthanks be to God And the Madonna, who give all things good, And only ask from us a thankful heart! âYes, I have been to take my evening walk Down to the Borgo; for, thank Heaven, I still Am stout and strong and hearty, as you see. I still can walk my three good miles as well As when I was but sixty, though, perhaps, A little slower than I used; but then I 've turned my eightieth yearâI have indeed! Though you would scarce believe it. More than that, I 've never lost a toothâall good and soundâ Look! not a single one decayed or looseâ As good to crack a nut as e'er they were. They 're the great secret of my health, I think; Like a good mill they grind the food up well, And keep the stomach and digestion good. âYes, sir! I 've passed the allotted term of man, Threescore-and-ten. I'm fourscore years, all told; But, the Lord help us, how we old men boast! What are our fourscore years or fivescore years (If I should ever reach as far as that) Compared with the eternity beyond? Yet let us praise God for the good he gives; All are not well and strong at fourscore years; There 's farmer Lanti with but threescore years, See how he 's racked with his rheumatic pains; He scarce can crawl along. Do you take snuff? âYes, sir! 't is fifty years since first I came As curate to this villageâfifty years! When I look back it scarce seems possible, And yet 't is fifty years last May since first I came to live in yonder little house. You see its red-tiled roof and loggia there Close-barnacled upon the church, that shows Its belfry-tower above the olive-trees. The place is rude and rough, but there I 've lived So long, I would not change it if I could. Old things grow dear to us by constant use; Habit is half our nature; and this house Fits all my uses, answers all my needs, Just as an old shoe fits one's foot; and there I sleep as sound with its bare floor and walls As if its bricks were spread with carpets soft, And all the ceilings were with frescoes gay. âBut what need I of pictures on my walls? Out of my window every day I see Pictures that God hath painted, better far Than Raffaelle or Razziâthese great slopes Covered with golden grain and waving vines And rows of olives; and then far away Dim purple mountains where cloud-shadows drift Darkening across them; and beyond, the sky, Where morning dawns and twilight lingering dies. And then, again, above my humble roof The vast night is as deep with all its stars As o'er the proudest palace of the king. âSo, sir, my house is good enough for me. I have been happy there for many years, And there 's no better riches than content; There I 've my little plot of flowersâfor flowers Are God's smile on the earth,âI could not do Without my flowers, and there I train my vines, Just for amusement; for the people here, Good, honest creatures, do not let me want For grapes and wine, howe'er the season be; Then I 've two trees of apricots, and one Great fig-tree, that beneath my window struck Its roots into a rock-cleft years ago, And of itself, without my care, has grown And thriven, till now it thrusts its leaves and figs Into my very room. Sometimes I think This was a gift of God to me to say, âBehold! how out of poverty's scant soil A life may bravely grow and bear good fruit, And be a blessing and a help.â May I Be like this fig-tree, by the grace of God! I have one peach-tree, but the fruit this year Is bitter, tasting somewhat of the stone. Our farmers tell me theirs are all the same; I think they may have suffered from the drought, Or from that hail-storm in the early spring. âYes, sir! 't is fifty years in this old house I 've lived; and all these years, day after day, Have run as even as a ticking clock, One like another, summer, winter, spring; And ne'er a day I 've failed to have my walk Down to the Borgo, spite of wind and rain. While in the valley low the white mist crawls, I'm up to greet the morning's earliest gleam Above the hill-tops. After noon I take An hour's siesta when the birds are still, And the cicale stop, and, as it were, All nature falls asleep. As twilight comes, I take my walk, and, ere the clock strikes ten, Lie snugly in my bed, and sleep as sound And dreamless sleep as when I was a boy. Why should I not? God has been very good, And given me strength and health! Praise be to Him! âMy life is regular and temperate! Good wine, sir, never hurts a man; it keeps The heart and stomach warmâthat is, of course, Unless 't is taken in excess; but then, All things are bad, if taken in excess. I drink, perhaps, more wine now than I did; For as old age comes on I need it moreâ But in all things my life is temperate. I take my cup of coffee when I rise; I dine at mid-day, and I sup at seven; I sit upon my loggia, where the vines Spread their green shadow to keep off the sun, And there I say my offices and prayers, And in my well-thumbed breviary read,â Now listening to the birds that chirp and sing; Now reading of the martyrdom of saints; Now looking at the peasant in the fields; Now pondering on the patriarchs of old. Then there are daily massesâsometimes come Baptisms, burials, marriagesâand so Life slips along its peaceable routine. âMy people here are generous and kind; Of all good things they own I have my share, And I, in turn, do what I can to help, And smooth away their cares, compose their strifes, Assuage their sorrows. By kind words alone One may do much, with the Madonna's aid. And then, in my small way, I am of use To cure their ailments: scarce a day goes by But I must, like a doctor, make my calls, And see my patients. After fifty years One must be a physician or a fool. There 's a poor creature now in yonder house I 've spent an hour beside this afternoon, Holding her hands and whispering words of faith, And saying what I could to ease her soul. I know not if she heard meâhaply not, For she is gone almost beyond the reach Of human languageâfar, far out alone On the dim road we all must tread at last. âAntonio Bucci keeps his lands here well! An honest, frugal, and industrious man; And his four daughters,âhealthy, handsome girls: Vittoria is a little spoiled, perhaps, By the Count's admirationâand, in truth, She is a striking creature; but all that, You know, is nonsense, and I told her so. Rosa is married, as you know, and makes A sturdy wife. She has one little child, With cheeks like apples. And Regina, too, And Fannyâboth are good and honest girls. Per Bacco! take them all in all, I think They're better for Antonio than four boys. I see them in the early mists of morn Going a-field; and listen! there they are, Down in the vineyard, singing, as they tend Those great white oxen at their evening feed. âWell, Spitz, we must be going now, or else Old Nanna'll scold us both for being late. Stop barking! Better manners, sir, I say! He 's young, you see; the old one died last spring, And this one 's over frisky for my age (You areâyou are! you know you are, you scamp!) But with his foolishness he makes me smile. As he grows older he'll grow more discreet. ('T is time to have your supper? So it is!) And for mine, too, I thinkâand so, goodnight!â So the old curate lifts his hat and smiles, And shakes his cane at Spitz, and walks away, A little stiff with age, but strong and hale, While Spitz whirls round and round before his path, With volleys of sharp barks, as on they go. And so good-night! you good old man,âgood-night! With your child's heart, despite your eighty years. I do not ask or care what is your creedâ Your heart is simple, honest, without guile, Large in its open charity, and prompt To help your fellow-men,âon such as you, Whatever be your creed, God's blessing lies. IN ST. PETER'S. THE CONVERT TALKS TO HIS FRIEND. A noble structure truly! as you say,â Clear, spacious, large in feeling and design, Just what a church should beâI grant alway There may be faults, great faults, yet I opine Less on the whole than elsewhere may be found. But let its faults goâout of human thought Was nothing ever builded, written, wrought, That one can say is whole, complete, and round; Your snarling critic gloats upon defects, And any fool among the architects Can pick you out a hundred different flaws; But who of them, with all his talking, draws A church to match it? View it as a whole, Not part by part, with those mean little eyes, That cannot love, but only criticise, How grand a body! with how large a soul! Seen from without, how well it bodies forth Rome's proud religionânothing mean and small In its proportion, and above it all A central dome of thought, a forehead bare That rises in this soft Italian air Big with its intellect,âand far away, When lesser domes have sunken in the earth, Stands for all Rome uplifted in the day, An art-born brother of the mountains there. See what an invitation it extends To the world's pilgrims, be they foes or friends. Its colonnades, with wide embracing arms, Spread forth as if to bless and shield from harms, And draw them to its heart, the inner shrine, From the grand outer precincts, where alway The living fountains wave their clouds of spray, And temper with cool sound the hot sunshine. Step inâbehind your back the curtain swings; The world is left outside with worldly things. How still! save where vague echoes rise and fall, Dying along the distanceâwhat a sense Of peace and silence hovers over all, That tones the marbled aisle's magnificence, And frescoed vaults and ceilings deep with gold, To its own quiet.âSee! how grand and bold, Key of the whole, swells up the airy dome Where the apostles hold their lofty home, And angels hover in the misted height, And amber shafts of sunset bridge with light Its quivering airâwhile low the organ groans, And from the choir's gilt cages tangling tones Whirl fugueing up, and play and float aloft, And in its vast bell die in echoes soft. And mark! our church hath its own atmosphere, That varies not with seasons of the year, But ever keeps its even temperate air, And soft, large light without offensive glare. No sombre, gothic sadness here abides To awe the senseâno sullen shadow hides In its clear spacesâbut a light as warm And broad as charity smiles o'er the whole, And joyous art and colour's festal charm Refine the senses, and uplift the soul. You scorn the aid of colour, exile art, And with cold dogmas seek to move the heart; But still the heart rebels, for man is wrought Of God and clay, of senses as of thought. Religion is not logic,âhusks of creeds Will never satisfy the spirit's needs. Strain up with high theologies the wise, But not the less with art's sweet mysteries Cling to the common heart of man, content To save him, though it be through sentiment. You whip the intellect to heaven with pain, And Beauty with her fair enchanting train From out your cold bare church is rudely driven; And yet what matters it how heaven we gain If at the last we really get to heaven? No! You are wrong; the end at last must be, That the heart, struggling with such sophistry, Breaks through the fine-spun web of logicâyearns For Love and Beauty, and to us returns; Or worse, it starves to death, and left alone The head to godless madness journeys on. The strongest wings too sternly strained, must droop, Give them a happy earth on which to stoop. There is no folly like asceticism When preached to allâReligion 's but a prism That makes truth blue to this, to that one brown; One hugs his lash, for God to him 's a frown; One would prefer a kindly Devil's hell To heaven, if with an angry God to dwell. And why should you, in this great world of ours, Give God the wheat, and give the Devil flowers? Think you that any child was ever born, Loved not the poppies better than the corn? And for the most part we are children here, That hold our Father's hand, and call himâdear. The head is narrow, but the heart is broad, And through the senses doors by thousands lead To Love's pure templeâand the very God Comes through them oftentimes when least we heed; Yet, though an angel at their door should come, And knock for entrance, both his flushing wings Radiant with love's warm hues and colourings, You cry, âNo entrance here, go back to Rome, Devil in angel's shape! they'll let you inâ Or, if you be no tempting shape of sin, Enter the great door of the intellect, That is the only entrance to our sect.â Think you not God frowns, and the angels weep, Turning away? Great Nature will not creep Into such narrow schemesâwhere'er she goes Flowers laugh before herâfrom toil's planted rows The lark springs singing; Dawn for her flings out Its glowing curtains; Day, with festal shout, Bursts glorious in, and flares o'er all the east, Till Earth shouts back as at a joyous feast; And after twilight leaves the clouds' long bars The cool blue tent of night she sows with stars, And hushes all the darkened land to dreams, Through which the silver sliding river gleams; Her lavish hand for beauty never spares, Her singing robes where'er she goes she wears; No long-drawn face is hers, morose and sad, As your religion craves, but sweet and glad. Is it to tempt us, then, to death and sin? Ah, no! my friend, she only hopes to win With thousand shifts these fickle souls of ours, Not with her rods alone, but with her flowers. You smile your unbelief; I recognize The stern protester in that sad and wise And solemn shake of head; you still prefer Your cold bare walls and droning minister; You hate the priest (of course you mean not me, But the whole system)âwell, well, let it be, I will not argue that at present, yet Some time or other we will talk of it; But this one thing I say, and say again, Great works are born of joy and not of painâ The Devil is an isolated brain. Why point there to the altar with a sniff Of such superior virtue, just as if Those ceremonial forms the truly wise Perceive are tricks, and therefore must despise. Dear friend, observe, this service is not made For one small chapel, where each word that 's said Might start the furthest sleeperâit appeals, Not through the ear, as yours, but through the eye; Each sign or gesture is a word that tells As clear a meaning as your âseventhly.â Your service in this vast basilica, Would it subserve a better purposeâeh? A violent man in black, a furlong off, Screaming, but all unheard, you would not scoff, Yet, as you do not know its sense, you think Folly like this is quite enough to sink The Roman churchâthese bendings of the knee And crossings, look like pure idolatry. Believe it not, a form is but a form, Not bad or good except as it is warm With the heart's bloodâthe spirit 't is alone That gives the worth to all that 's said or done. Be reverent, friend! nor sneer at her who kneels In that dim chapel while her beads she feels, Up-glancing at the saint that bleeds above. What if her creed be false? one drop of love Is worth a thousand creeds. I would not care Though she should whisper to her lover there, So full of love for him, that oft she prays With idle lipsâit is not what she says But what she is that saves herâif her heart Be from the ritual service all apart, But lose itself in earnest love for him, God is still servedâay! and perchance the grim And sad observance of a loveless task You would enforce, he would not rather ask. But, hist, the sharp bell tinklesâ't is the Host The Pope upliftsâyou will not, friend, be lost, Though you should kneel. You could not stand apart, I knew you must be stirredâyou have a heart. Was it not wondrous, when the multitude, With a vast murmur, like a wind-swayed wood, Dropped to its knees, and sudden bayonets flashed A cold gray gleam, and clanging side-arms clashed Upon the pavement, as along the nave The helms of guards went down with dropping wave Of their long horsehair,âand a silence deep And full of awe above us seemed to sweep, Like some great angel's wing, 'neath which all hearts Were shadowedâtill from out the silence starts A silver strain of trumpets, sweet and clear, That soars and grows in the hushed atmosphere, And swells along the aisles, and up the height Of the deep dome, and dies in dizzy flight Among the cherubsâand we know above The incarnate Christ is looking down in loveâ And then, when all was over, like a weight Too great to bear uplifted from the heart, The crowd rose up and rustled all elateâ Ah, friend! the soul is touched by all this artâ But comeâthe crowd movesâshall we too depart? BARON FISCO AT HOME. Ha, my old friend! so, you've come back again! Sit down, sit down!â't is years since we have met. How goes the world with you?âYou shake your head! Not well? Indeed! I'm sorry. So your plan Did not succeed. You see 't was as I feared. You would not heed me, thought my counsel bad; Would go your own way; had your notions high Of honesty and honour, and all that, Straightforwardness, uprightness, these at last Would, must succeed;âwhat think you of it now? Was it not as I told you? Honesty Is simply the worst policy on earth: As for the other world, the future world, If any such there be, it may be best; But for this world, made as it is, 't is worstâ A mean low proverb, and what 's more, a lie. âVirtue's its own reward,â exactly soâ Its own reward, whatever that may be, But not the world's success. No, no, my friend! You look surprised to find me titled, rich, Housed in a palace, playing the great manâ It must be laughable to you, who know How we began in life. So let us laughâ Laugh inextinguishable laughter, just As the old Augurs did upon the sly When no one saw them. Faith, this serious load Of dignity is sometimes hard to bear! And pleasant 't is to meet a friend with whom One may throw off one's livery of pretence, Relax, laugh, lie no more, be natural. So now, a truce to lying and pretence,â I do so suffocate beneath my mask, I am so sick of my falsetto voice, Almost I 'd like to cry out to the world I am a scoundrel, though a prosperous oneâ Only it would not do;âand then so long To Christian jargon I have schooled my tongue And virtuous slang, that it comes hard at last Even to myself to own the very truth, And wholly cease to be a hypocriteâ Nay, sometimes I impose upon myself, And almost think I am what I pretend. You bring the old times back, how vividly! We started from the self-same path in life, You one way, I the other. Both of us When we were young and poor, ay, very poor, Hawked through the streets our little stock of wares Spread on a tray, and swinging from our necks, Pens, pencils, trinkets, brooches,âall mere sham; Mine were, at least,âwhat yours were, you know best; And so, mere boys, we bore along the streets Our tawdry store, and cried: âWho'll buy? Who'll buy?â Well, passers bought of me more than of you Simply because I lied with glib, false tongue, Vaunted my goods as real,âin a word, Cheated; of course I cheated, if I could. What 's any trade but cheating? All the world Strove to cheat me, and I strove to cheat them. And thus at first we earned enough to liveâ Badly, of course, but still we lived and saved; Went to bed hungry many a night to dream Of coming fortune, that was slow to come. So daily turning over our small gains, We by degrees laid by a pretty sum,â Paltry enough indeed, but still enough At least to start uponâto place our feet Upon the ladder's lowest rung of trade; And then we parted, what long years ago! How many is it? Forty at the least. And now we meet again. Ah well, my friend! You have not prospered; you are poor, I see,â Still poorâhungry perhaps. Stop! let me ring,â A glass of good old wine will do you good. Wine? You shall breakfast with meâwe will talk Over old times. Perhaps 't is not too late Even now to put you on the prosperous road. We'll seeâwe'll see! John, set the table hereâ Set it for twoâmy friend will lunch with me; And bring two bottles of that old red seal Out of the right bin, A 1âupper shelf. And your champagne? You like it sweet or dry? Dry? I agree with you. The best dry, Johnâ You know my brand; and quick too, don't delay. Ah, you are looking at my pictures! Well, What say you of them? That 's Meissonierâ A drinking-bout. Fine, I am toldâI know It stood me in a hundred thousand francs, And cheap at that. That 's a Fortuny there. Bright, is n't it? And that? Oh, that 's a nymph! Byâfaith, I 've quite forgot who painted it! Nudeâyes, I think soâvery nude, but then That 's all the vogue now. Living, is it not? Live, palpitating flesh? To balance it There 's a Madonna pale and pure enough, Painted byâwhat 's his name? Enough of theseâ You'll come and look at them another time. Now for our breakfast, lunch, or what you will. You need not wait, John! Come, sit down, my friend! Well, yes! I have succeeded as you say; You find me richâay, and I mean to be Much richer. 'T is the first step costs. To gain The first ten thousand costs pains, toil, care, skill, Great self-denial; after that it grows Easier and easier,âand at last your pile Breeds almost of itself left quite alone. But then I never let it quite alone. How did I make the first ten thousand? Well, Simply by following out my principlesâ Not yours. Oh no! Your principles were fine, High, noble, anything you will, but then Purely unpractical. I took the world Just as I found it; strove not to amend Its many faults, but profit by them all,â Made large professions, crouched and crept and crawled, Put in my pocket all my pride,âpicked up Out of the dirtiest gutter, so to speak, The dirtiest pennyânot too proud for thatâ Bore all reviling patiently, bent low To kiss the hand that struck me; what I felt Within me I concealed, never gave voice To bitterness in empty words. Ah no! Not such a fool; bided my timeâtalked softâ Was simply sad to be misunderstoodâ Meant to do right but was deceived by knaves Who took advantage of my ignorance. Ah me! ah me! ah, what a wicked world! And then your splendid counters, too, I used,â Had always in my mouth those sounding words, Truth, Honour, Justice, Duty, Honesty. Reproved false dealing, speaking; went to church, Prayed loudly, openly declared myself A miserable sinner; dropped my mite Into the poor-box in the face of all; Let all my good deeds shine out before men, And wore a face of pure simplicity. A cloak, you say! Well, yes! I wore a cloak. One must not go quite naked in this world. We must use phrasesâonly they are fools Who think them more than phrases. Everywhere Men use themâin the pulpit, in the mart. But who does more than use them as a cloak, If there be any such, they are rank fools. Dishonest was I? Fie! Beyond the verge Of Lawâand that, as I suppose, is rightâ I never put my foot, or not both feet; One foot within the Law I always kept. Of course I used the Law, and studied it, Availed myself of all its shifts and turns,â And in its limits planted, flung my nets Beyond, to haul my hooked fish safely in. With even little means one may do much Through knowledge of the law and pains and skill. My little business at the first I did, Only from hand to hand, from mouth to mouth,â Never with writings, contracts, signaturesâ That is on my part, never put my name To obligations. Promises in words, Of course, I gave; but promises are airâ One may forget, deny, misapprehend. Shaved notes? Of course. Lent money? Yes, of course. Upon usurious interest? Stop, my friend! What is usurious interest? If I own A little sum, and some poor man has need Of just that sum, I should of course be glad To give it him, not lend it; but indeed I am too poor, have other duties too, I dare not run even temporary risk. But for your note, say, for a hundred francs, You must at once have money. Ah, good sir, I have but fifty; and your simple note, What is it worth? Out of pure friendliness I offer this; but pray don't take me upâ This is a friend's act, who can call it wrong? There have been times, I will confess to you, That I have sheered too closely to the law, And made mistakesâbut they were mere mistakes. I once forgot some money that was placed For my safe keeping in my hands, forgot Most absolutelyâand, in fact, forgot To make a memorandum. Being thus, I naturally used it for my own. But somehow it was proved that I was wrong, And I repaid itâcertainlyâat once, When it was proved; but the censorious world Would not admit this was a mere mistake. Ah me! what evil minds and thoughts there are! There have been several mistakes like this; But who among us does not make mistakes? There were some notes that once passed through my hands With altered numbers,âin one case, indeed, With awkward signatures,âmere carelessness. I should have been more careful, I admit,â And even now I scarce forgive myself. Well, this is all, I think: you see, my friend, How I have prospered. Spite of my mistakes I have my palace here, who used to climb To the fifth story of my garret mean; I have rich meats and wines (this wine, I think, You will acknowledge good), French cook, and all That luxury asks, who once was well content With my stale crust, and once a week, at most, A scrap of meat, not always sure of that. Around my neck I carried once my tray, And now my brougham and horses carry meâ Nor finer horses will you see in town. My play-house was the street once,ânow I own My opera-box, and sitting there at night I take some pride that I am gazed at there And pointed out as one to be observed,â The Baron Fiscoâthat is he. Ah, well! Little we thought, we two poor ragged boys, Of anything like this; but now I am Wealthy, respected,âand ennobled too,â Have been a Deputy, and should be still But for an unexplained mistake, that now Is scarce worth mentioning since it is past. To me obsequious many a hat is raised Despite it all; and on my breast I wear Stars, crosses, ribbons, when I go to Court,â And smiling, I shake hands with some like youâ Having such principles as yours, I meanâ Upon whose breast I see no simplest cross To hide the well-worn coat with its white seams. It pays, you seeâit pays, say what we will. Success, my friend, covers all kinds of sins. Never be found out, that 's my rule of life. Truth, Honour, Honesty, are excellent To talk about, but as strict rules of life Are, let us say, most serious obstacles. You 've found them such, I thinkâso have not I. Little by little small things grow to great. One must be patientânever force one's card, But wait the time to play. Riches are power, And having won them, if we bide our time, We can buy anything we will. All things Are purchasableâif we only knew Just how and when to buy them. That needs skill. Honours and titles? Ah, wellâwellâa loan Is sometimes needed,âprivately, you know,â For persons high in power and influence; And then, of course, one lends it as a friend, With no advantage asked or dreamed. Ah no! Glad of the honour to be borrowed from,â Only too proud to be of the least use,â Even as a carpet to be trod upon,â Such generosity brings its reward. And then, again, with riches at command, Things take a different aspect, better name. What looks like swindling with a petty sum, Is on a grand and speculative scale Honest enough, so it be large enough. The difference 'twixt a million and a franc, Makes such a difference in so many ways. Come, fill your glass againâwe are old friends; You see I nought conceal, speak openly. We began life together. I am rich, You poor. You see my principles were best. If you object to the word principles, I'll say my practices. We'll not discuss The wordâthat 's nothing. Now I say to you Join me, I'm getting old and tired too; Be my first clerk, first confidential manâ I'll pay you well; and having gone thus far, Made enough money, if indeed one has Ever enough, quite,âI can now afford To let you have your way, since I can trust Your honesty, and that, I must confess, Is of all things the rarest on the earth. I have been seeking for an honest man, God knows how long! I find him here at last. You smile as if to sayââSo, at the last, Even Honesty succeeds.â Well,âyes,âsometimes. Not of itself, though, save by happy chance, When it can lend itself to abler hands. We all like Honesty in those we useâ That is, as far as what concerns ourselves. ZIA NICA. Old Zia Nica, she had looked through lifeâ Its deeps and shoals had soundedâfelt the strife Of stormsâsailed round its capes and reefsâand known The absolute whole of passion's burning zone. Queen of the osteria there she sat, Half listening, while around her buzzed its chat: Her red-rimmed eyes, all bloodshot from carouse, Half shut, and peering out 'neath shaggy brows; And now and then a grim sardonic smile Quivering at some coarse speech across her lips, As up she sharply glanced, and ceased the while To drum the table with her finger-tips. All taste for gracious things was gone; her tongue Craved the sharp whet of savage words, the zest Of some lewd speech, some bitter, biting jest, That like raw brandy for a moment stung. Thus stern she sat, amid her compeers there, Over her sunken cheeks her coarse gray hair Straggling, a wicked sharpness in her look, Like some spent fury. Now and then she struck Sharply her clenched hand on the board, until The glasses rang, and every man was still To listen, as with voice high, harsh, and shrill, She shrieked some savage taunt, or jest so lewd, It seemed to prick the skin and draw the blood; And then with coarse laugh opening wide her jaws (Where, either side the mouth's red-roofed ravine, Two yellow teeth, like ruined piers, were seen), She paused, expectant of the fierce applause. âBravo, per Bacco! Zia Nica's shot Is in the very bull's-eyeâis it not?â If beauty, maidenly reserve, and grace, Once, as they say, in earlier, happier hours, Grassed softly over this volcano's vent, The time has long gone by of grass or flowers; Ay, and the passionate and flaming days, They, too, have passed, and all their fury spent, And left but ashes, scoriÃ¦, blasted stones, Cast forth by passion, the dead wreck of sin. Yet impotent, low growls, and rumbling moans, And sharp convulsive throes, still stir within; Still the old crater, burnt out at its heart, At times a savage tongue of flames will dart; And Zio Tonio trembles even now, Despite his coward smile, so faint and grimâ Trembles, as down she shuts her dinted brow, And her eyes, closing, take slow aim at him. And yet not wholly vanished is all grace; One vein of love runs like a singing stream Through all this scoriÃ¦; and across her face, Praise but her grandchild, shoots a sudden gleam, As she strokes down his curled and tangled hair. Touch him for harm,âthe tiger from her lair Is not more swift to spring, more wild to scream, More fierce with hand and tongue to rend and tear. Come, Zia Nica, fill a brimming glass! Nay, sit not thus, your hands upon your knees, But drain its red blood down unto the lees. Yours is no heart to strike to an âalasâ;â Up! while the mandoline and thrummed guitar Ring through the osteria's vaulted wall, And all our glasses jar and voices callâ Hark to the echoes of the days afar! Hands on your broad hips,âshuffle down the floor A tottering salterello,âpipe once more That old cracked voice,âand while the noisy jar Of Passatello stops, and we who quaff The rich red wine of Tonio's choicest bin, Strike down our tumblers,âshriek out shrill and long The quavering fragment of that wicked song, And let us hear your wild defiant laugh Closing the final strophe of its sin. Then shall the black vault echo to the din, The benches leap, the lumbering tables spring, The brass lucerna's rattling pendants swing, The hanging lamp in quivering circles shake, And o'er the ceiling whirl its gleaming ring, Ay, and the framed Madonna, shuddering, quake. Up, Zia Nica! hear you not the strain? Once you could dance. Old Tonio, stand aside. Push back the benches! make the circle wide! The music rouses the old strength again. Ay! when this Tonio took her for his bride, Was there, of all the maids on hill or plain, One that with this fierce mÃ¦nad could compare? More firm of waist, with such black eyes and hair? Stand back! there 's danger in her eyes; for lo! Upstarting with a sharp shriek from her seat, With arms flung wide, and heavy shuffling feet, Around the cleared space see her circling go. Her trembling hands now twitching at her gown, Now snapped aloft in air,âtill, flushed with heat, All reeking, panting, shaking, in her seat, With open mouth, she drops, exhausted, down, CryingââOld Zia Nica 's not dead yet!â To Zia Nica, then, your glasses drain! And let the low room echo to the cryâ Eviva! and eviva! and again Eviva!âmay our Zia never die! ROBA DI ROMA. Julietta appears above at a balcony. RomÃ¨o! Hist! Madonna, saints, and all! How the man sleeps, stretched out beneath yon wall, Deaf as the wall itself! I shall be missed Before I make him hear. RomÃ¨o, hist! Ah, well! Thank Heaven, I 've waked him up at last! Quick, MÃ¨o, catch this bottle I 've made fast To this long cord! 'T is English wine, as strong As aqua vitÃ¦. Quick! don't be so long! I found it in the pantry set away For the great dinner that we give to-day. And catch this package: there are candied pears For your sweet tooth, and sugar cut in squares, And other bomboms. Now, be off at once! There, round the corner,ânot that way, you dunce, Or they will see you!âand come back at ten. Who knows what I may find to give you then? A rivederci caro, ah! va ben! That dear old MÃ¨o mine,âwhat luck it was That through the pantry I should chance to pass Just when old Frangsaw had slipped out a minute, And no one near to see! The saints were in it! Ah, well, he 's gone! I'll draw the water now. All 's silent yet; but won't there be a row When Frangsaw comes and finds, instead of ten, There are nine bottles only! Well, what then? He can't accuse me. Let him, if he dares! I'll settle him, for all his mighty airs! Perhaps 't was not quite right to take the wine; But then the fault was his as well as mine. Why should he leave it there exposed to sight, To tempt whoever saw it? 'T was not right! Does not the Lord's own catechism say No one should lead us in temptation's way? And they who do so are in part to blame; As we forgive them, let them do the same. Besides, next Sunday I'll confess the whole To Padre Giacomo,âthe good old soul, Old omnia sÃ¦cula, amen,âno doubt He'll set all right, and smooth the matter out. And then, again, I say enough 's enough! Why should these rich signori swill and stuff, While we, who toil and slave our life away, Must live upon their leavings? Grazie. It is not fair! It is not fair, I say! There are five grand signori come to dine, And want ten bottles, and they'll get but nine! Dreadful to think of! How will they survive? And how, then, on one bottle can we live? I'm sure we only take what they can spare; No one could call that stealing! Hark! Who 's there? That MÃ¨o's not come back again, I hope! No; 't was the old goat tugging at his rope. All 's safe, thank Heaven! Madonna, what a row! That 's Frangsawâwho has missed the bottle nowâ Screaming for me, and swearing at them all. Vengo! I am not deaf,âI heard you call. What is the matter? Blessed saints! I say I hear you,âany one could, miles away. I'm coming. Bottle? A black bottle?âOh! How in the name of mercy should I know? I 've just come up to draw some water here. Wine? I know nothing of your wine, mounseer! It 's water that I'm drawing. Wine of cost? Ten bottles were there, and one bottle lost? How should I know, indeed? How can I tell Where it has gone to? I'm here at the well Drawing up water. Ten? Was it the wine In those black bottles? Ten? There were but nine When I last saw them. Oh, yes, that 's your way: There 's not a thing you stupidly mislay But some one stole it; 't is thief here, thief there, When you 've missed anything. Why don't you swear There were twelve bottles,âtwenty! What is ten In your outlandish lingo? Search me, then! I steal your wine? I 've other work to do. Thief, if there 's any one here thief, 't is you. Who was it I was talking to below? When? Nobody! I say there was n't. No! Go look yourself, and see. You heard me say Something to somebody? What was it, pray? âPst! via! quick, be off at once!â Oh, that? That 's what you heard? You idiot! you flat! Why, what I called to was the cat,âthe cat! NINA. DEDICATED TO M. E. B. How bright, how glad, how gay, To thee, O Nina, dear! Day after day slipped smooth away, Through childhood's simple joy and simple fear. Strained by no adverse force, Life, like a clear and placid stream In some delightful clime, Bearing the sky within it like a dream, And all the fair reflected shapes of time, Flowed on its gentle course! How many a time, oppressed with gloom, While sitting in my lonely room, And toiling at my task, Neglected, humble, wan with care, Aspiring, hoping, though I did not dare Fate 's laurelled prize to ask, Have I been gladdened by that voice of thine, Singing, perhaps, some trivial song of mine, And listened, and looked up, and felt a thrill Come o'er my heartâas over waters still A light breeze fluttersâand almost forgot, Hearing that happy voice, my wretched lot. Years went; the round and rosy face Grew fairer, paler; and as Childhood went, Came Maidenhood's more tender grace And thoughtful sentiment: And when the first soft airs of Spring Wooed the flowers forth, and with a subtle fire Stirred in the human heart a vague desire For what life cannot bring, Often I watched you moving to and fro The alleys of the garden-plot below, Your white gown 'mid the roses fluttering; And now you paused to train some wandering spray With almost a caress, And now you plucked some last year's leaf away That marred its perfectness; Or where the lilies of the valley grew, Like them as modest, sweet, and pale of hue, You bent to breathe their odour, or to giveâ Almost it seemed as if they must receive From you a sweeter odour than they knew. Sometimes, as lingering there you walked along, Humming half consciously some little song, You paused, looked up, and saw me, mute and still, Gazing upon you from my window-sill; And with a voice, so glad and clear, It rang like music on my earâ You cried, âAntonio! look, Antonio, dear!â Ah, happy memories! They bring the burning tears into my eyes. Oh, speak again, and say, âAntonio, dear!â Ah, vanished voice! call to me once again! Never! ah, never! in this world of pain, No tone like thine my heart will ever thrill. Oft when the spring its perfumed violets strewed Along the greensward, 'neath the ilex wood I strolled with you, how many an afternoon, In the perfection of the early Juneâ Not owning to myself, as there we roved, Not knowing, truly knowing, that I loved; And all the while your pure young thought So deeply in my inmost being wrought, That it became a happy part of meâ And as it were a sweet necessityâ From which I wanted never to be free. Yet never spoke I of my love; so slow, So gently in my heart it grew, That when it fully came I scarcely knowâ Not bursting into rapture strange and new, Splendour and perfume on the air to pour, That from the sense was hidden in the bud A little hour before; But slowly rising, like a tide to brim My being, widening ever more and more, And deepening all my central life with dim Unconscious fullness, till its joy ran o'er. Then, when I knew at last, How very dear thou wast, I dared not trust my tongue to ease the load Of love that lay upon my heart, But lonely, silent, and apart, Of you I dreamedâfor you I hourly prayedâ Glad of my secret love, but how afraid! 'T was but a child's affection that you bore For meâa placid feelingânothing more. Across your heart, so gentle and serene, The burning thrill of love had never been; And Childhood scarce had given place To Maidenhood's more subtle grace, When Death, who darkly steals along Amid the gentle and the strong, When least we fear to see his face, Paused, gazed at you, and took you for his own, And all the joy from out of my life had flownâ And I was left of all bereft, Too utterly alone. Will earth again renew That simple love for me?âah, no! Spring comes againâagain the roses blowâ But youâah, me!ânot you! Oh, Nina! in your grassy grave I buried what can never grow again; Life but one perfect joy can haveâ That in thy grave is lain! EVENING IN SUMMER. Oh, love of mine, we sit beneath this tree, We smile, and all is exquisite to see; The moon, the earth, the heavens are all so fair,â The very centre of the world are we. And yet, 'neath all our happiness, there lie Dim doubts and fears, for ever lurking nigh; We are so happy now, one moment's space, Then Love, and Life, and all take wing and fly. Where shall we be a hundred years from now? Where were we but a hundred years ago? Behind, before, there hangs a solemn veil,â What was, or shall be, neither do we know. A passing gleam, called Life, is o'er us thrown, Then swift we flit into the dark unknown; As we have come we go,âno voice comes back From that deep silence where we wend alone. Stay! stay! oh, ever-fleeing Time, thy flight! Make this one happy moment infinite; Now, while we touch the heavens, and stand on earth, And Love makes mystical all sound and sight. No! the sad moon, so plaintive and so fair, Hath seen how many here as now we are, As happy in their perfectness of love,â And seen, unmoved, as many in despair. She will arise, and through the darkling trees Gaze down, as now, through countless centuries, While other lovers here shall breathe their vows, When we have vanished like this passing breeze. Oh, dreadful mystery! Thought beats its wings, And strains against the utmost bound of things, And drops exhausted back to earth again, And moans, distressed by vague imaginings. Each to himself, in all his hopes and dreams, The very centre of creation seems; And death and blank annihilation each As some impossible vague terror deems. Yet, of the countless myriads that have gone, The countless myriads that are coming on, Are all immortal? Ah! the thought recoils From that vast crowd of living, and sinks down. But what if all in all be now and here? The rest, illusions shaped by hope or fear,â And thou and I, with all our life and love, End like this insect that is fluttering near? If Virtue be a cheat, a child to soothe, And Heaven a lie, invented but in ruth, To hide the horror of eternal death,â Knowing that madness would be born of Truth? Who knows? who knows? Since God hath shut the door That opens out into the waste before, Vainly we peep and pry, vainly we talk, And vain is all our logic and our lore. What will be, will be, though we laugh or weep; Love is the happy dream of Life's brief sleep. And we shall wake at last, and knowâor else In death's kind arms find slumberâdreamlessâdeep. Ah, love! what then is left to us but Trust That somewhat in us shall survive our dust; That heaven shall be at lastâand life and love Be purified of all earth's dregs and must? Then let our life and thought no more be vext By this dark problemânor our hearts perplext To solve the secret that torments us here;â Love is earth's heavenâand we will wait the next. GIULIETTA. DEDICATED TO G. W. C. Ah, how still the moonbeams lie On the dreaming meadows! How the fire-flies silently Lighten through the shadows! All the cypress avenue Waves its tops against the blue, As the wind slides whispering throughâ He is late in coming! There 's the nightingale again! He alone is waking; Is it joy or is it pain That his heart is breaking? Bliss intense or pain divine? Both of them, oh Love, are thine! And this heart, this heart of mine, With them both is thrilling. From the deep dark orange-grove Odourous airs are streaming, Till my thoughts are faint with loveâ Faint with blissful dreaming. Through the slopes of dewy dells Crickets shake their tiny bells, And the sky's deep bosom swells With an infinite yearning. On my heart the silent weight Of this beauty presses; Midnight, like a solemn Fate, Saddens while it blesses. All alone I cannot bear This still night and odourous air, Dearest, come, its bliss to share, Or I die with longing. I have listened at the doors, All are calmly sleeping; I alone for hours and hours In the dark am weeping. Only weeping can express The mysterious deep excess Of my very happiness, Therefore I am weeping. Like a fountain running o'er With its too great fulness, Like a lightning-shivered shower For the fierce noon's coolness, Like an over-blossomed tree, That the breeze shakes tenderly, Love's excess falls off from me In these tears of gladness. Ah, beloved! there you are! I once more am near you; Walk not on the gravel there, Somebody may hear you. Step upon the noiseless grass; Oh! if they should hear you pass We are lost, alas! alas! We are lost forever! Look! the laurels in the light Seem with eyes to glisten; All things peep and peerâand night Holds its breath to listen. Deeper in the shadow move, For the moon looks out above, I am coming to you, love, In a moment coming. THE CHIFFONIER. I am a poor Chiffonier! I seek what others cast away! In refuse-heaps the world throws by, Despised of man, my trade I ply; And oft I rake them o'er and o'er, And fragments broken, stained, and torn, I gather up, and make my store Of things that dogs and beggars scorn. I am the poor Chiffonier! You see me in the dead of night Peering along with pick and light, And while the world in darkness sleeps, Waking to rake its refuse-heaps; I scare the dogs that round them prowl, And light amid the rubbish throw, For precious things are hid by foul Where least we heed and least we know. I am the poor Chiffonier! No wretched and rejected pile, No tainted mound of offal vile, No drain or gutter I despise, For there may lie the richest prize And oft amid the litter thrown, A silver coinâa golden ring Which holdeth still its precious stone, Some happy chance to me may bring. I am the poor Chiffonier! These tattered rags, so soiled and frayed, Were in a loom of wonder made, And beautiful and free from shame When from the master's hand they came. The reckless world that threw them off Now heeds them only to despise; Yet, ah! despite its jeers and scoff, What virtue still within them lies! I am the poor Chiffonier! Yes! all these shreds so spoiled and torn, These ruined rags you pass in scorn, This refuse by the highway tost, I seek that they may not be lost; And, cleansed from filth that on them lies, And purified and purged from stain, Renewed in beauty they shall rise To wear a spotless form again. I am the poor Chiffonier! AN ESTRANGEMENT. How is it? It seems so strange; Only a month ago We were such friends; now there 's a change; Why, I scarcely know; I thought we were friends enough to say, âWe differ in this or the other way, What matter?â It was not so. I know not the how or why, I only feel the fact; Something hath happened to set us awry, Something is sadly lacked,â Something that used to be before,â It seems to be nothing, I feel it the more; Our vase is not broken, but cracked. Friends? Oh, yes, we are friends; The words we say are the same, But there is not the something that lends The grace, though it has no name. When others are with us we feel it less; When alone, there 's a sort of irksomeness, And nobody to blame. I wish I could say, âDear friend, Tell me, what have I done? Forgive me; let it be now at an end.â But ah! we scarcely own That aught has happenedâor something so slight 'T is ghostlike, it will not bear the light,â 'T is only a change of tone. Suppose I should venture to say: âSomething,âoh! tell me whatâ Troubles the heart's free play That once existed not.â All would be worse;âwe must turn our back; Pretend not to see that there is a crack In our vase, on our love a blot. Once were it openly said, It would strike us more apart. Each, alas! would know that there laid A stone at the other's heart. But now we carry it each alone, So we must hope to live it down, Each one playing his part. It is not that I express Less, but a little more, A little more accent, a little more stress, Which was not needed before. Ah! would I could feel entirely sure That it was not soâI should be truer, If you were just as of yore. But I cannot give you up. Ah! no, I am all to blame; You were so kind, you filled my cup With love,âand mine is the shame; 'T was some stupid, foolish word I said Unwitting, I know, that must have bred This something without a name. Was it not all a mistake? Oh! porcelain friendship so thin, It is so apt, so apt to break And let out the wine from within; But once it is injured the least, alack! What hand so skilful to mend the crack, And make it all whole again. THE BEGGAR. I am but a beggar, A wretch and an outcast; No health in my body, No joy in my spirit; Despised and neglected, Lame, crooked, and wretched, I crawl at thy gateway To wait for thy coming, For I love thee, my glory, My life, my beloved! I wait for thy coming All night at thy portals, In my rags I await thee, In sorrow and longing. I watch the lights shining And moving above me, And my heart goes up to thee In loving and longing, For I love thee, my gladness, My hope, my beloved! I wait till thy portals Swing wide in the morning, And thou with thy splendors Before us appearest Desiring, yet fearing, The sword of thy glances; For how shall the outcast Dare gaze at thy glory; Yet I love thee, my gladness, My life, my beloved! What have I to give thee That thou shouldst accept me? How dare I to hope, then, That thou wilt not spurn me? No goodnessâno beauty Is mineâand no riches, But a human heart only That praises and trembles; For I love thee, my gladness, My life, my salvation! With the wretched I wander, My life is uncleanly, I yield to temptation, And drink at the tavern; Yet in the still foot-paths Of thought I adore thee, In the filth of my vices I kneel down to praise thee; For I love thee, my gladness, My life, my salvation! Each law of thy kingdom I 've wilfully broken; Without, I am abject, Within, I am loathsome; I ask not for justice, For that would destroy me; I cry for forgiveness, Oh! save and forgive me; For I love thee, and fear thee, My life, my salvation! THE MANDOLINATA. The night is still, the windows are open, The air with odours is sweet; Hark! some one is humming the Mandolinata Along the open street. The Mandolinata! Ah me! as I hear it, Before me you seem to rise From the other world, with your gentle presence, Your tender and smiling eyes. How we jested together, and hummed together That old and threadbare song, With forced intonations and quaint affectations, That ended in laughter long! How oft in the morning beneath your window I framed to it bantering words, And heard from within your sweet voice answer With a flute-tone like a bird's! And you opened your shutters and sang, âGood morning, O Troubadour, gallant and gay!â And I chanted, âO lovely and lazy lady, I die of this long delay! Oh, hasten, hasten!â âI'm coming, I'm coming, Thy lady is coming to thee;â And then you drew back in your chamber laughingâ Oh, who were so foolish as we? Ah me! that vision comes up before me; How vivid and young and gay! Ere Death like a sudden blast blew on you, And swept life's blossoms away. Buoyant of spirit, and glad and happy, And gentle of thought and heart; Ah! who would believe you were mortally wounded, So bravely you played your part? We veiled our fears and our apprehensions, With hopes that were all in vain; It was only a sudden cough and spasm Betrayed the inward pain. In the midst of our jesting and merry laughter, We turned aside to sigh, Looked out of the window, and all the landscape Grew dim to the brimming eye. And at last, one pleasant summer morning When roses were all in bloom, Death gently came with the wandering breezes To bear your spirit home. A smile on your lipsâa tender greetingâ And all that was once so gay Was still and calm, with a perfect sadness, And you had passed away. THE EMPTY HALL. Through the casement the wind is moaning, On the pane the ivy crawls, The fire is faded to ashes, And the black brand, broken, falls. The voices are gone, but I linger, And silence is over all; Where once there was music and laughter Stands Death in the empty hall. There is only a dead rose lying, Faded and crushed on the floor; And a harp whose strings are broken, That Love will play no more. THE DESOLATION OF JERUSALEM. They have crushed my pride! They have trampled me down in the dust! Whither, O God, shall I flee? To whom shall I turn?âin whom shall I put my trust? In whom, O Jehovah, but Thee? For Famine and Pestilence enter through all my gates, And dark Death stalks in the street, And Murder at every corner skulks and waits, And Justice has bloody feet! Thou hast trodden me down, and all I have loved is fled; I have moaned till my soul is sore, I have wept till my eyes are coals, and my heart is dead; 'T is useless to crush me more. They have plucked the babe from my breast; the child in his play, While he laughed, they have stricken down; The grace of woman, and manhood's strength, and stayâ And age with its hoary crown. I have sinnedâI deserve my Fateâyet hear me, O Lord! Oh forgive them not who have set Their feet on our necks, and Thy name and Thy law abhorredâ Whose hands with our blood are wet. Do unto them, O God, as they unto me and mine! Crush them, and beat them down, Like a tempest that swoops o'er the corn, and flays the vine With its darkening thunder-frown. Mercy I do not demand for myselfâand for them No mercyâbut justice, O Lord! Let Thy swift sharp vengeance destroy them root and stem With the lightning of its sword. I have sinned! I have sinned! Jehovah, Thou hidest Thy face; But, prostrate here in the dust, I adore Thee, the Holy One. Lift me in my disgrace, Oh help me! in Thee I trust. The floods have all gone over me; nothing now Can torture me more or worse; Thy thunder hath crushed me flat, and Thine awful brow Hath frowned, and I feel Thy curse. Not humbled by them, but quivering under the weight Of Thy tremendous hand; But Thou who hast punished wilt pardon! Thy pity is great! Oh raise up this desolate land! I can wait, I can suffer, O Lord, for Thy law is just, Though terrible is Thy wrath; But this people is Thine, O Lord; in Thy promise they trust, To guide them and show them the path. Thou shalt lift them at last when the debt of their sins is paid, All paid to the uttermost groat; And the balance shall turn in which their sins have been weighed, And the collar be loosed from their throat. Years shall go by. They shall creep, they shall cringe, they shall crawl, Abject in the eyes of men; Loved by none, feared by few, but scorned and derided by allâ And then, O Jehovah, and then Thy voice shall be heard,ââYe have drunk of the bitter cup, Ye have drained it and drunk it down; Come back, O my people, come back; I will lift you up, And place on your heads the crown. âAnd joy shall again be yours, and triumph shall peal And ring through your laughing ways; And your strength shall be mine, and your battle be mine, and your steel, And your glory be mine, and your praise.â AN ENGLISH HUSBAND TO HIS ITALIAN WIFE. What a constant jealousy gnaws your heart! It tires me out; day after day Some little worry from nothing you startâ Something is hidden in what I say, Something is hidden in what I do; That heart of yours is never still, It cannot be sure that I am true, But spies and pries about for ill. Frankly I speak the whole of my mind Once for allâlet it serve or not: I am not one of that showy kind, Fair outside with an inward rot. I love you! will not that suffice? No! I must say it again and again, And embroider it over with flatteries, Or all I have said and done is vain. Trust me! trust my simple love! If you suspect me, that love will die. I cannot bear to be forced to prove Every moment its honesty. Ah! you say, I'm so still and cold! Well! I cannot be other than what I am; I cannot squander my lump of gold As I could a little tinsel sham. You your jewels must always wear; What is their use if they are not shown? I keep mine with a miser's care And love to count them over alone. I cannot abide that the world should observe. What it thinks is nothing to me; I was born with a sense of reserve That is shocked by love's publicity. You have a richer heart, if you will, That scatters about its wide largess; Your love a keeping like mine would kill,â All that you feel you must express. Your love seeks for the light and sun, And gives its perfume to every breeze; The bees get its honeyâevery oneâ Its beauty whoever passes sees. Mine, like a well, is still and deep: Cold, you say it is, like a well; But though like a brook it will not leap And joy forever one tale to tell, It still is real; and when the year Hath silenced the brook with its shallow laugh The well's cool waters will still be clear, Where those who trusted may surely quaff. I cannot, like Sarto, publish your face In every Madonna, Sibyl, and Saint, Or praise to the world your beauty and grace In a thousand sonnets sweet and faint. But this is the head's work more than the heart's: Skill and genius they show, no doubt; But the painter and poet may give to their Arts What they leave their lady, perhaps, without. Trust me, dear, with your eyes so black And full of passion,âthese eyes of blue, Though your excess of expression they lack, Are not the less sincere and true. I cannot fondle you every hour With many a pretty and gallant phrase, Rain out my love as a cloud its shower,â But trust me, and leave me my English ways. BLACK EYES. Those black eyes I once so praised Now are hard and sharp and cold; Where 's the love that through them blazed? Where 's the tenderness of old? All is goneâhow utterlyâ From its stem the flower has dropped. Ah! how ugly Life can be After Love from it is lopped! Do we hate each other now, While we call each other dear? On that faultless mouth and brow To the world does change appear? No! your smile is just as sweet, Just as fair your outward grace; But I look in vain to greet The dear ghost behind the face. That is gone! I look on you As a corpse from which has fled All that once I loved and knew, All that once I thought to wed. 'T is not your fault, 't is not mine; Yet I still recall a dream Of a joy almost divineâ 'T was an image in a stream. Nothing can be sour and sharp As a love that has decayedâ On the loose strings of the harp Only discord can be made. Cold this common friendship seems After love's auroral glow; On the broken stem of dreams Only disappointments grow. Do I hate you? No! Not hate? Hate 's a word far too intense, Too alive, to speak a state Of supreme indifference. Once, behind your eyes I thought Worlds of love and life to see; Now I see behind them nought But a soulless vacancy. Out and out I know you now; There 's no issue of your heart Where my soul with you may go To a beauty all apart, Where the world can never come. 'T is a little narrow placeâ Friendship there might find a home; Love would dieâfor want of space. So we live! The world still says, âWhat expression in her eyes! What sweet mannersâgraceful ways!â How it would the world surprise If I said, âThis woman's soul Made for love you think, but try; Plunge thereinâhow clear and shoal!â You might drown thereâso can't I?â ARTEMIS. A slender shape of graceful mien, With spirit tenderly serene O'er which had never passed a storm; In feeling pure, in impulse warm: A face informed with serious light, Too peaceful to be gayly bright, Too young to know of pain and care, Too slight their wearing weight to bear, She passed before my dreaming eyes When in the paling western skies The young moon trembling strove to hide Within the clear sky's luminous tide. Again to full expansion grown We met when maidenhood had flownâ A noble sweetness lit her eyes, Her look was calm as destiny's. Pure, serious, grandly self-possessed, Her passions rounded into rest, She stoodâand far above I saw The full-orbed moon without a flaw Walk through the chambers of the night And comfort all the world with light. Again, when youth and health had gone I saw her pallid cheek and wan. Life scarcely seemed to linger there So visionary was her air, And sweeter than all words can tell The smile that ever said, âFarewell!â Within her saintliness of mood All joy, all passion was subdued, And as she passed, far overhead The morning twilight 'gan to spread, While thin and white before the day The waning moon paled fast away. NINA AND HER TREASURES. Life, since you left me, love, has been but a trouble and pain, I am always longing and praying to see your dear face again. Fate has been cruel and hard, and so many tears I have shed; The heart is an empty nest for the rain, when love has fled. I am weary, so weary, of life, and the bitterest pang of all Is to lie and think of the past, that nothing can ever recall; To lie in the dark, and think and sob to myself alone, Quietly, lest I should waken and grieve mamma with my moan. Sometimes I stretch myself out, and think, as I lie on my bed, Thus it will be with me, when I'm laid out stiff and dead. Stay not away, O Death! Come soon and give me my rest, With the calm lids over my eyes and my arms crossed over my breast. Then perhaps he will come, and, gazing upon me, say, Nina was good, and our love was an hour of a summer's day. Ah, yes, a day that the clouds overcast, ere the morning was done, And whose noon was a dreary rain, with never a glimpse of sun. If he should stoop and kiss my lips, oh, if I were dead, I think I should start to life, and rise up in my bed. But what is the use of thinking, with all this work to do? Oh, yes, mamma, I hear you; I'll come in a moment to you. What am I doing? Nothing. I'm putting some things away; No,ânot the trinkets of Gigi. (Madonna, forgive me, I pray!) Oh, no; you never will throw them into the river, I know. Just wait till I find my needle, and then I'll come in and sew. Oh, this is the hardest of all,âto smile and to chatter lies, While my heart is breaking and tears blind everything to my eyes. When will there come an end, Madonna mia,âI say, When will there come an end, and the whole world pass away? NEMESIS. DEDICATED TO E. B. H. Oppressed by pain, by grief subdued, I closed at night my weary eyes, When, in the dubious twilight dim Betwixt reality and dream, The awful shape of Nemesisâ The absoluteâbefore me stood. Her hands within her robes involved, And folded square upon her breast, Immovable, in perfect rest, From sight of human eyes concealed The dread decree of Fate she held, By time and death to be resolved. Severe was she in mood and mien, Like one who never saw surprise; Who, deaf alike to love or hate, Or joy or fear, impassionate Decreed the doomâdecreed the prizeâ Inexorable, yet serene. âOh! what hast thou for me in store This side the shadow of the tomb? Pronounce!â I cried, âor what shall be The stern decree of destiny When life and death alike are o'er?â âTime is of destiny the womb,â She answered. âSeek not to explore What the eternal powers above Conceal, in pity and in love, Behind the Future's darkened door. âContent within the present live! Do the great duty of to-day! Minute by minute the gods give, Each unto each for man to layâ Not to be scornedânor thrown away. âWith love and justice build them close By strenuous act and earnest will! Nor let your wandering wishes loose To anxious hopes or fears of illâ So will you best time's task fulfil! âPile not with vain regrets the grave Of the irrevocable past! Seize opportunityâenslave The living moments while they last! For Fortune meets half-way the brave.â She ceased; and starting from my sleep, I heard the roaring thunder, thrown Far down from mountain steep to steep, And dying in a distant groan,â And waking, found myself alone.</field>

GINEVRA DA SIENA. âMeglio Ã© morir che trarre Selvaggia vita in solitudin, dove A niun sei caro e di nessun ti cale.â Saul di Alfieri, scena 4, atto 1. âLove is a greater lawe (by my pan) Than may be yeven of any erthly man; And therfore positif lawe, and swiche decree Is broken all day for love in eche degree. A man moste nedes love maugre his head. He may not fleen it, though he shuld be ded, All be she maid or widewe or elles wif.â Chaucer: The Knight's Tale. So then you've come at last, my own best friend, My youth's friendânever friends like those of youth! I had not thought to see your face again, Nor any human face that pitied me. Now let me weep upon your breast; my heart, Dried up within me, seems to swell again At your soft touch of pityâlet me weep! My tears so long have burnt me, but these tears, Like rain on withered grass, bring up again The old spring greenness. Oh! at last, at last. This passionate tension of my life gives way. The desolating sand-spout whirled along My desert life, and straining up for years All feelings, thoughts, and hopes, breaks down at last; So, let me weep hereâat your very feet; Lift me not upâit soothes and calms me so. See! what a poor, bruised, broken thing am I! But you, dear Nina, knew me ere this brow Was ruled with wrinkles, ere the thick dark hair Which clustered round it grew so thin and white; One curl at least remains of what it was, And still you wear it in your locket, love. You yet are fair. Stop! let me look at you; How young you are, and I, so old,âso old! 'T is only happiness can keep us young. Then, how should I be young, imprisoned here In this drear villa, all my turbulent thoughts Storming against my fate, my hopes burnt out, My heart the crater where their scoriÃ¦ lie! Yet all keeps young about me; all 's the same As I beheld it when a little girl. These walls are still the same; the sky 's the same; The same sad stretches, the same undimmed stars; The olives are not changed; there stand the pines, Murmuring and sighing still; clouds come and go, Just as they did when I was young and gay: And looking on them thus, year after year, So changeless, while 't is all so changed with me, Half maddens me at times. They seem to mock With their perennial youth my vanished joys. Here, in this room, I was so happy once! Here, in this room, I am so wretched now! My ghostâa pleasant, laughing, careless ghostâ Walks down along that terrace. See! 't is there! And yours is with it. Ah! one sees that 's yours; But mineâwho 'd ever dream that once was I? Look now, it beckons, laughs, and flings a flower. Off! off! I hate you; vanish from my sight: Thereâdown the cypresses goâgo, I say; Vanish! and never let me see you more. 'T is gone nowâgoneâwould it were never there! Mere fancy, Rosa saysâperhaps she 's rightâ Such tricks things play us. Do not look so strange; Who can avoid all meetings with one's ghost? And yours, does yours come never from the past, From corners dim of olden days and dreams, To whisper words that almost drive you mad? Ah! I forget! You are so happy still, And joy's gay laughter chases ghosts away. Well, we'll not talk of that, nor think of that, Only don't look so sad and shake your head; You know I do not think 't was really there, But then it somehow seemed as if it were Just for a moment's space. Pray bear with me, And if my ways and words to you seem strange, Don't mind them, dearest; living all alone We get fantastic notions, and one's talk Grows wild with too long talking to one's self. But now you come and love me, I am strong; You, with your happy smile, scared from my breast ... Well, wellâno matter what,â't is fled away; You see it 's gone nowâlook, there 's nothing here. Let them all go; one leap to other days. My heart is almost light to see your face. Oh! kiss me, dearest, kiss me yet once moreâ How it smooths out the tangles in my brainâ And put your hand in mine: believe me, dear, For years I have not felt so sane and calm. I'll write upon your heart as on a book. If I go over all the old, old days, You'll listen, will you not? I know you will. Let me go back to when I saw you last. Our lives till then had close together lain, Shaped each to each in habit, feeling, thought, Like almonds twinned within a single shell. What thought or hope was mine that was not yours? What joy was mine that was not shared with you? All was so innocent when we were girls; Our little walksâthe days you spent with me In the old villaâwhere, with arms loose clasped Around each other's waist we roamed along Among the giant orange-pots that stood At every angle of our garden-plot, And told our secretsâwhile the fountain plashed, And, waving in the breeze, its veil of mist Swept o'er our faces. Think of those long hours We in the arched and open loggia sat Pricking the bright flowers on our broidery frames, And as we chatted, lifting oft our eyes, We gazed at Amiata's purple height, Trembling behind its opal veil of air; Or on the nearer slopes through the green lanes, Fenced either side with rich and running vines, Watched the white oxen trail their basket-carts, Or contadine with wide-flapping hats Singing amid the olives, whose old trunks Stood knee-deep in the golden fields of grain. Do you remember the red poppies, too, That glowed amid the tender green of springâ The purple larkspur that assumed their place Mid the sheared stubble of the autumn fieldsâ The ilex walkâthe acacia's fingered twigsâ The rose-hued oleanders peeping o'er The terraced wallâthe slanting wall that propped Our garden, from whose clefts the caper plants Spirted their leaves and burst in plumy flowers? All these are still the sameâthey do not miss The eye that loved them so; and yet how oft I wonder if those old magnolia-trees Still feed the air with their great creamy flowers, And show the wind their rusted under-leaf. I wonder if that trumpet flower is dead. Oh heaven! they all should be, I loved them so; Some one has killed them, if they have not died. But you can see the villa any day, And I am wearying you. Yet all these things Are beads upon the rosary of youth, And just to say their names recalls those hours So full of joyâeach bead is like a prayer. How many an hour I've sat and dreamed of them And dear Siena, with its Campo tower That seems to fall against the trooping clouds, And the great Duomo with its pavement rich, Till sick at heart I felt that I must die. People are kneeling there upon it now, But I shall never kneel there any more; And bells ring out on happy festivals, And all the pious people flock to mass, But I shall never go there any more. How all these little things come back to me That I shall never seeâno, never more! Oh, kiss the pavement, dear, when you go back! Whisper a prayer for me where once I knelt, And tell the dead stones how I love them still. These little things,âah, suffer, love, like me! You'll know how all these memories live and sting; Even lifeless things, that scarce with conscious sense We gaze upon in sorrow or in joy, Cling to our joy and sorrow close as life. Things, too, at discord with our lifted mood Their trivial figure on the mind will stamp So deep that time can never wipe it out; Yes, even the pattern of the pavement there, Its stones a step apart on which I trod In torturing hours, are printed on my heart Like some essential part of all I felt; And when the pang comes back, they, too, return. As we two wandered, little ignorant girls, With childish talk and childish wonder then, What did we know of life?â't was all a playâ A pictureâsome few pretty shifting scenes Set in the magic lantern of our youth. What could we know, we little hermits, then?â Watched over, tended, gently led along A path with ne'er a stone to trip us up; Reading such innocent books, going to mass, Saying our Aves every morn and eve; Never let go beyond a vigilant eye To watch where danger hovered; caged like birds In our home aviary, where we sang, And fluttered round, but never could get out, Where, though the eagle and the swooping hawk Were ranging round, we were so safe from them. How were we fit, thus nurtured, to be loosed Upon the world? One might as well set free The frail canary, bred within a cage. Oh! in the storm and buffet of my life My heart has flown so often back again, And beat the bars that could not let me in. Look at the foolish way in which we're trained, And say, how can it fit us for the world? The doctrine and the mass, of course, we 're taught; Then comes our first communion in the fold Of some clean convent, 'mid the patient nuns, Whose minds and lives are stunted at the best. What can they teach except hypocrisy, To check the natural currents of our youth? Through their religious panes they show the world All glare and falsenessâyet we sigh for it; Then, taken back, we're kept beneath a glass, Like some frail plant that cannot bear the breeze. For home is but a kind of convent, where Our mother is the abbessâwe the nuns; We learn our letters, but there 's nought to read Save tedious homilies and bloodless books. Life is more real, so we sigh for itâ Not life on this side marriage, but beyond. For what is life so-called to us poor girlsâ Embroidery and trivial talk at home, Dressing and pinching, the lute, and then A dull and formal walk on the parade, Where we may learn to smile and bow with ease. Sometimes convoyed into society, Our mother leads us with a careful string, And lets us hop a little way alone; But watching us the while with Argus eyes, And lecturing our manners and our words. Peeps at the world, from under down-dropped lids Of fear and innocence, we catch; we 're told That this we must not doânor thatânor that; All that we long for is prohibited. Burn though we may for liberty and joy, In whose fresh air the heart alone expands, With little worldly maxims we are drilled; Calm and reserve alone are maidenly. We must not speak unless our mother nods. So life, with all its stern realities To us is vague, as is a blind man's thought Of colors, or a deaf man's dream of sounds. Some day our mother calls us to her room, Count This, Marchese That, has asked our handâ She says, â'T is all arranged for you, my dear; He 's rich and young, and of such noble birth, We could not ask or hope a better match; I and your father both are satisfied.â âBut I,â you cry, â't is I must marry him; And I am yet so young, so happy here. Besides, I've scarcely seen him, know him notâ How can I marry if I do not love?â âLoveâlove, of course; first marry, and then love!â Thus marriage opens unto us the door That leads to liberty, if not to love. When we are married, we at least are free; So, unprepared in ignorant innocence, We rush to marriage just for freedom's sake. What could I hope? My little bark put forth Into the stormy world, and made a wreck, And here I rotâall dashed to pieces here! Look at that ghastly hulk there on the beachâ That broken, bare-ribbed skeleton that lies Deep sunken in the barred and shelving sand; 'T was a gay vessel launched in pride and joy, With streaming banners and with music, onceâ Look at it now! Then turn and look at me! Are we not both the same sad broken wrecks? Still old thoughts cling, the shells and barnacles Of happy days, when through the southern seas Of youth my keel went rushing joyously, And all my pennons flew, and my white sails Rounded their bosom to the swelling air. You know the Count, the husband that they gaveâ Cold, stern, impassive, like an angled wallâ Squared to his dutiesârigorous, even, hardâ I beat myself to death against that wall. He married me as he would buy a horse, Then all was over. âPut it in the stall, Caparison it well for gala days, Break it to worldly paces with a curb, And give it best of food and best of straw.â Kind treatment this, you say: what would you more? Nothing, unless one has a heart and brain; And I, alas! was born with one at least. Ask of the world his characterâthey'll say, An honorable man formed to respect, Proud of his birth; but who would not be proud? Refined, exact, punctilious; one, in fact, Safely to trust in great and little things. Well, then, I trusted him with all I had. Now, ask of me what was the noble Count? The world 's half right; but half right 's wholly wrong. Fair was his outward seemingâmanners fairâ A little stiff with over-courtesy, Like to those rich brocades all sewn in gold; But noble, I agree, and dignified. The apricot is smooth upon the skin, And yet it only has a stone for heart. What education teaches, he had learned; But on a rock you cannot graft a rose. Still, stoniest natures have their sunward side; And there with him his pride and honor grew. The shortest line 's the straightest 'twixt two points, And the frank nature takes it openly. His nature was secretive: on his path, Lead where it would, he loved no human eye; Dark windings, devious ways, he rather chose, Fifty miles round, beyond the sight of man, Rather than one across in open view. His good and bad alike he loved to hide; Spoke little, hated praiseâsuspected itâ And yet was flattered by obedient acts. Passions he had, but he had mastered them, And loved and hated in a bloodless way; But never was with generous anger fired, Nor blazed to indignation at a wrong. His impulses he doubtedâwould not stir To passion's trumpet; but lay long in wait, Ambushedâthen struck with slow and proud resolve, And called it justice when he took revenge. His dark impassive face was cold as bronze; His mouth locked up in silence like a chest Whose key is lost, or drawn as it had worn A life-long curb; his forehead full and bare, Where not a wrinkle told what passed within. Sometimes his hands would twitch when he was moved, But not his lipsâno, nor his cold round eyes, From which he shut all meaning at his will; While, like an intricate machine, his mind With counter-wheels worked out the simplest act. There is my master! there 's the inside man! Why further then dissect? He, proud and cold, Reserved, and hating every show of heart; I, warm, impetuous, urged by impulsesâ Demanding love in words and tones and acts. Could we two live together? Yes; as lives The passionate wave with the affronting cliff, Fretting in quiet seasons, madly dashed With useless violence when roused in storm. How many a time, in longings vast and vain, I rushed towards himâstrove to overclimb His walled-up nature, and, forced back again, Fell with a wild lament into myself, Shattered with struggle, in a dull despair. When in fierce mood I once o'erstept the line Of rigid prudence, strict punctilio, And in strong language railed against the world, With all its busy, peeping, prying eyes, He turned with half a smile and half a frown, And used a figureâ't was the first and last He ever used save oneââYou like these tropesâ Here 's one: your sail is larger than your craft; Take heed the first gale do not sweep you down.â âBetter go down,â I cried, âon the broad sea, Battling a noble voyage with wind and wave, Than rot inactive, anchored in the port, Fixed stem and stern, a hopeless, helpless hulk. What if I vail my spirit-sails in fear And creep to shelter for ignoble rest?â The dullest wreck will at its cable strain When from the outer sea the great swell rolls, And no poor creature with a heart and brain But in the stagnant harbor of routine Feels stormy lifts of longingâpants for life, And strains to grapple with some noble task.â He smiled half-sneering, and then coldly said, âThe noblest task is to command one's self;â And then I knew how huge a fool I was, And locked my life and longings in my heart. But after all 't is love that most we need; Love only satisfies our woman's heart, And even our ambition looks to love; That given, life is lightâdenied, is death. Man is content to know that he is loved, And tires the constant phrase âI loveâ to hear; But woman doubts the instrument is broke Unless she daily hear the sweet refrain. Thus life went on for three long weary years. I should have fallen broken to the earth The last sad year, but one hope buoyed me upâ I was to be a mother. Ah! the dream Of that dear face, long, long before it came, Shone in my thoughts with strange pathetic light, Like the moon shining in a snake-filled dellâ Something at last to have which I could love! Oh! how I prayed that it might be a boy, And mediate 'twixt that iron heart and mine. Who knew? The sternest natures are not whole; Some vulnerable point there is in all, Where they were held when dipped into the Styxâ Some mother's touch where you can reach the quick. So with this reed I helped my hope along, And, waiting patient, said, âIf 't is a boy 'T will touch his prideâhis pride may touch his love.â Our boy was born, and my prophetic heart, Like other prophets, mixed the true and false; His pride was touchedâhis love was still unborn. In his first joy there seemed a kind of mist About his heartâit passed like breath on steel; At sudden times, as if against his will, Words almost tender from his lips there came, Then chased away as weak and out of place; So with an iron glove one wipes a tear Quickly, as not belonging to a man. Sometimes I held him up unto the Count, And, smothering him with kisses, cried aloud, âIs he not lovely? oh, my life in life! My little angel out of paradise! Say, is he not too dear to stay with us?â Then heââWhy always thus exaggerate? An angel? no, a good stout healthy boy; And dear, of course, because he is our child.â Yet this I thought was half in awkwardness (Men are so, often, even when they love), And that he could not bring his lips to say What stirred within; for often ere he rode I heard his steps along the terrace clang, And, through the lattice looking, saw him take Our Angelo, who stretched out both his arms, And crowing strove with aimless hands to clutch The nodding feather streaming from his cap; While he would laugh, and with his black beard brush The little rosy cheek, or with his lips Catch the fat fingers of those dimpled hands; The little creature, not the least afraid, Would seize his beard, and scream his baby scream, Or pat the cold steel plate above his heart. Thus far it wentâno farther. Love to him Was like the glitter on that cold steel plate; The gleam of prideânot the impassioned ray That warms and glows through all the inner life. I strove to recompense this aching want, This thirsting for a sympathetic soul, With thinking of my child and loving him. But childish love is pure and innocent, It cannot answer to the passion's call; And hopeless, with a cruel load at heart, I held my way unhappy and alone. Beat as I would the bars that girt me round, From my stern prison of necessity No outlet opened save into the air; And sitting sorrowing there, my wandering thoughts Fled far and wild, and built ideal dreams, And happy homes made beautiful by love; Yet still the end was, dropping with a groan Down to the same unhappy earth of fact, More wretched for the joys that could not be. I linger hereâfor here there came a change. From this long distance, which is like to height, I see the landscape of my life below. There is its childhood's little garden plot, Its weary marsh of stagnant womanhood, Its one highway of dutyâdusty, hard, And leading nowhere. Eagle-like I plane Above its drear Maremma solitudes, Where there is ne'er a bird to sing of love; And, rising far along the horizon's verge, Behold the darkening storm come crowding up, And know the lightnings that are hidden there. Well, let me say it all at once: I loved. My heart, long straining with its strong desires, And hungered with a vague and craving want, Snapped all at once its harsh and formal bands. I stood alone within a clouded wood, When sudden sunlight burst upon my path; A scent of unknown flowers filled all the airâ The single cymbal with another clashed, And wild triumphant music shook my thoughts. We metâah, fatal hour! we met and loved; My heart rushed to him as the tideless lake, Nearing the sheer precipitous abyss, Rushes to ruin, and with one wild burst Of storm and splendor down the rapids whirling, Leaps, white with passion, to the lake below. Vainly the trees along the shadowy shores, Quivering with fear, cry to the rapids, âStop!â Vainly the hillsides strive to hold them back; God's glorious rainbow o'er their terror glowing, They rush to ruin, as we rushed to ours. I was not guiltyâguilty then of what? Say, is the aloe guilty when it bursts To its consummate flower, death though it bring? If our two hearts, surcharged like wandering clouds With love's intensest electricity, Borne by the rushing winds from north and south, Sent down the blasting lightnings when they struck In heaven's broad dome, if without will they met, Was it our fault? No; guilt is prearranged, Is wilfulâit demands consent at least. How could we help it, if we met and loved? If this be guilt, then nature is all guilt. The love I bear my mother and my child, The very hope of heaven itself, is guilt; The very wind that blows, the eye that sees, The heart that beats, are guilty, one and all. What nature works in man and thing alike Is innocent. I could not help but love. My head is troubled by these swarming thoughts, But I have need to speak, so let me speak. Hark! is that he? Oh, save me from that man! Save me! No, no, you shall not strike him here! Stab at him through my heart, then, if you will! Oh yes, I see. 'T was but the jarring door, The wind. Oh yes, I seeâonly the door. 'T is past. I am not weak; let me go on. No, dearest, no, no, no; let me go on. The tears are in your eyes; I see the tears. Mine are all wept away, years, years ago. Oh keep your heart wide open; take therein The floods that from grief's open sluices pours, And pity, pity what you cannot change. Give me your sympathy: I have not found For such long years a patient pitying heart, That now I feel that I must speak or die. From fearful nightmares starting suddenly, How sweet to tell the horrors we have passed, Knowing they all have passed: so sweet to me These dreadful passages of life to tellâ That never, never, will be wholly past. We metâwe loved. Oh, what a world there lies In those four words! 'T was in the summer days When first we metâthe last dear day of June, That was the dayâand love from bud to flower Rushed with the sudden passion of our clime. You know the shadowy laurel avenue, Where, sheltered from the sun, we used to stroll Those summer mornings when we both were girls; And you remember, through the vista seen, How the pomegranate blossoms glowed like fire Against the old gray wall above the door; 'T was there, beneath those flowers, I saw him first. There, walking in the avenue alone, I heard the Count, my husband, call my name, And looking round, just in the shadow there, I saw him standing at my husband's side. âGinevra,â said the Count, âmy cousin here Claims you as cousin too, since we are one. I bring him here to you, for I am forced (Against my will, I scarcely need to say) To change a private joy for public care, And leave him for a time in better hands. My kinsman graciously excuses me My forced departure for some hours; till then You'll do the honors of our house for me, And I alone shall suffer all the loss. Ginevra, entertain our noble friend With all that our poor villa can afford, And piece its want out with the best of will.â So speaking, in his formal, courteous way, He took his leave, and we were left alone. You see he left us there; me fair and youngâ I was so young then, and they called me fairâ He in the full completed prime of youth, When all the blood runs riot in the veins, And speaks from out the cheeks and lips and eyes. Oh, Count, was this well done to leave us so? He touched my hand, and bore it to his lips. 'T was but a common courtesy; and yet That touch ran through me like electric fire, Thrilling my every nerve. At once his look, By some peculiar mastery, seemed to seize And to possess me, and I felt within A tremulous movement in my thoughts, as when The needle blindly struggles towards the pole. He too was movedâhis color came and went; We neither were at ease, we knew not why; And so together, side by side, we strayed Through the clipped alleys of the laurel walk,â Or 'neath the shadow of the cypresses We paused,âor, leaning on the parapet, And gazing into purple distances, Mechanically plucked from out its clefts Some tiny flower or weed,âor, lingering near The fountain's marble margin, idly watched The gold-fish poising in its basin clear; And while the babbling water gushed and dripped, And reared its silver column in the sun, And, over-weighted, dropped in pearls, our talk Kept centring to our feelings from the range Of outer facts with which it first began. Oh golden morning! there you seem to float Far off in memory, like a sun-flushed cloud, With roseate lights, and tender dove-like shades; No lightning in your bosom hid, no threat Of passion, no remorse and death to come. The air was faint with orange-flowers; the grove Throbbed with the beats and thrills of nightingales Hid in its covert green; along the wall Flamed the pomegranate's fiery flowers; the rich Rose clusters of the oleander bloomed Soft in the violet shadows o'er them cast By the gray villa. All the garden seemed To swarm with happy life; the lizard stole Along the fountain's marge, and stayed to gaze With a shy confidence; the hawk-moth, poised Above the roses, thrust his slender trunk Into their honeyed depths; on gauzy wings The long green dragonfly in gleaming mail Kept darting zigzag, hovering to and fro; Hot bees were bustling in the flowers; with soft And aimless flutter, painted butterflies Hung drifting here and there like floating leaves, Or rested on a weed to spread their wings. All nature seemed in quiet happiness To live and move,âand, thoughtless, without fear, I shared that joy in harmony with it. Swiftly the morning passed; and yet if hours By inward change be counted, ere it went Years had gone by, and life completely changed. So as we talked, not owning to ourselves The silent growth of love that was to bear At last a poison-flower, a sudden voice Startled us both. I knew it was the Count's, And in my ear it sounded like a bell That harshly scares us from a happy dream. âWhere are you?â cried he. âOh, the Count!â I said, And started up, and saw him, cold and proud, Turn the green corner of the laurel hedge, And stand before us. With a formal speech He broke the silence, offering excuse That he had stayed away from us so long, And asking pardon for disturbing us, And then began to talk in stately way Of what in council had been said and done, As if his world were ours; and then, aghast, I saw the chasm those short hours had rent Between his soul and mine. Like some dull noise I heard him talking as we walked along, While all my thoughts were hurrying within Wildly, and in my breast my fluttering heart Was beating like a prisoned bird. At last We reached the house, and to my room I rushed For silence and for solitude. Once there, I fell upon my bed, burst into tears, And hid my face; for then I saw my fateâ Saw it rise up before me like a ghost. Thus for a week our life went on: each day The Count, made blind to everything by pride, And by the vanity of ownership, Left us along the garden walks to stroll, Or in the house for hours alone to talk, Not dreaming that his wife could dare to love; And I was fearless too till every sense Had drunk Love's sweet insidious poison in. He was our guest; my husband day by day Bade me be with him,âand no feigned excuseâ Excuse that was against my will, and yet Feebly put forth, some barrier to rear 'Twixt love and dutyâserved to ope his eyes. He blindly pushed us down that plane whereon Vainly I sought for stay my course to stop. How then resist? Duty is strong like willâ Passion like madness! I was wrenched away From all that used to hold me; not a hand Reached out to save me. Struggling thus alone, If I but heard the Count's stern voice below It seemed to freeze me; all my soul in arms Started against him. Ah! no help was there. Oh! how confess to him, and ask for help? Then all my soul strained out to find a way Back unto peace at least, if not to joy. Glancing at all my life now left behind, What was there to restrain me? Angelo, My darling Angelo! His little arms, Clasped close around my neck, should hold me back From where my life was sweeping rapidly, Yet all without my will. I grasped at this. Alas! it had no strength to save me then. We walk along with such a fearless trust Through unknown dangers; yet our death may lie Within one drop of poison that the ring On a friend's hand may hold. One whispered word May shake the avalanche down upon our headâ One moment more or less destroy or save. The whole vast world without, and that within, Turn on a pivot's point, and, jarred from that, Both universes into ruin rush. 'T was thus with me: before, at least, secure, And if not happy yet without a fear; And now a word, an hour, had changed my life. A word? an hour? Ah, no! for years and years, The train within my being had been laid. My cruel disappointments, broken hopes, And crushed desiresâa black and ugly mass, Were powder to a single spark of love; Oh! bid that, touched by fire, not to explode. But ah, the bliss of loving and the pain! For I had never lived until I loved; Yet evermore a terror 'neath the bliss Constrained it, like some fearful undertow, That dimples the smooth river's sunlit brim, To drag the stoutest swimmer down to death. On, on, my thoughts wentâthere was no return; One backward step no soul can ever take. My life thus far had been as dull and dead As a deserted eagle's nest that hangs In the black shadow of an Alpine cliffâ The shining saint-like heights too far above, The humble valley's peace too far below. Wild, gusty, furious, with a moment's wrench The hurricane of passion swept me down, And, swirled along by fierce tumultuous thoughts, Torn from the past, the future all unknown, I hovered 'twixt the sky and the abyss. Broken in body, spent in soul, at last I gave myself to Fate. Do what thou wilt, I cried, my strength is goneâI yield to thee; Crush me or save me, I can strive no more. Thus all my sudden passion cried in me; But better thoughts at last with time arose. Perhaps, perhaps, I said, he does not love; 'T was my own heart that shone upon his face. Oh! if it be so, all may yet be safe, And I will hide my secret from his eyes, And only act and speak as friends may do. Yes, let me struggle for a while, and then, This visit over, I can die alone. Oh, vain, vain, vain! day after day I saw That love consumed his heart as well as mine. Fate set its face against us from the first. Day after day we could not help but meet. All stay, all resolution formed between Our constant meetings, when we met, gave way. We could not dash the cup down from our lips, Despite the poison that we knew it held. He strove to make excuses to depart, But still he lingered; and in constant fear Each that our love might blaze into an act, Or that a word might make our love a crime, Life rushed along in terrible pretence. But oh, how dear for all their pain they were, Those blissful, fearful days! Left all aloneâ For every morning went the Count to town, And Guido sometimes would not brook excuseâ We ranged the garden 'neath the laurel shade; Or, where the waving trumpet-flowers out-stretched Their red tubes, shaken by the buried bees, We sat together, hiding as we could With veil of words the life that glowed beneath. But even the widest circle of our talk, Strive as we would, drew to one centreâlove; And there he told me of his early days, And all his early hopes and joys and pains, And painted his ideal of a life: Oh what a life it was!âbut not for us. And then upon the pure stream of his voice Such songs of poets slid into my soul; So sad, too, that they brought the brimming tears: And oft like poplars quivering in the breeze We trembled with the joy we dared not own; And oft we started up on some excuse, And left each other when we could not bear Our overburdenâI to weep and pray, And he, dear heart, I think, to do the same. One day we talked of rings as there we satâ Of Cleopatra's she dissolved and drank, And of Morone's, whence a devil spake. And I by chance upon my finger wore This which I wear forever now, when he, Taking my hand and looking at this ringâ âGive it to me,â said, jesting; âI will swear I'll ne'er dissolve it Cleopatra-like; 'T is but a little thingâfor friendship's sake Give it to me, and when I look at it I'll hear an angel, not a devil, speak.â I answered, bantering, âShall I give it you To put upon the first fair lady's hand You fall in love with, or to boast to men Here is a trophy? No, Sir Guido, no; You think you'll keep it, but I know you men.â âNow Heaven be witness, never shall it leave This hand of mine if you'll but put it there. Shall I make oath? Then hear me, cousin mine: I swear to keep the ring while life shall last; And lest it fall into unworthy hands, Dying I'll send it back to you again. So when it comes without me, pray for me.â âSo serious,â answered I; âthen take the ring, And we shall see if man can keep his oath.â I knew the inward struggleâloved him more The more I saw him fight against his Fate. His acts were only common courtesies, And ne'er a word betrayed what throbbed within. Yet were words wanting? Ah! we read too well The passion burning in each other's face, That would not be concealed howe'er we strove. If but my scarf would touch his hand, a flush Went like a thrill of music o'er his face, And subtle tones transfigured common words. At last, convulsed, in one wild hour he told His desperate love: he flung him at my feet; His heart cried out, âOh kill me where I lie, Here where I kiss the print your foot has made Upon the grass! Oh, dearer here to die, Knowing you love me than to weary out The death of life afar from you, my heaven!â O God, forgive me! but I loved him so, That honor for an instant's flash went out. All my resolves burst like a broken dam, And âUp!â I wildly cried; ânot at my feet, Here on my heart thy placeâhere on my heart!â Then all was over; once those rash words said, We never more could meet as we had met; Our souls gazed at each other face to face, And saw in that one look that all was lost. Yet do not think that guilt then stained our souls. Guilty of love we wereâof nothing else; But thus to see him in his agony Was worse than death. I could not even say, Go!âfor I feared some sudden desperate end. I strove to soothe himâI to soothe himâI Who burned with fiercer flames than martyrs know: I uttered bitter comfortâstretched my hand To that poor sufferer burning at my side. And when he cried, âO God, forgive me now! And you, Ginevraâoh my fate, my fate!â Though death griped at my heart, and passion's self Struggled with duty for my very life, âPatience,â I cried, âand God will help us both! Why should we suffer thus who do no wrong?â Then starting up, and pacing to and fro, He madly struck his forehead, crying out, âOh! were there only something to be done, Not something to be suffered, to be borne.â Or bitter accusations of himself He uttered, saying, âI have broken faithâ Broken my oath to which I swore myselfâ And all is over now. No more dear days, When I at least can see and feel you near. 'T is over nowâah yes!âall over now. I feel the fire-sword whirling round my head To drive me from you, out of Paradise.â âOh, say not soâwe cannot help our love; And though we may not meet as now we meet, A way may yet be shown we cannot see. Now goâoh, leave me, Guido, for my heart Is breaking, and there 's no more life for me!â I, longing to console his tortured heart, And scarcely knowing what I meant myself, Uttered these words, and tore myself away. Look at me nowâsee how I tremble now; Think if the memory can tear me thus, What agony I suffered in that hour. Oh, dearest Guidoâdearest, dearest heartâ It was not sin to love a soul like yours, For you were made to win and wear the best,â Not one like me. O cruel, cursed Fate, Why did I ever live beyond that hour! How strange the world looked as I wandered back Into the palace! what a broken heart The nightingale had then, that in the grove Throbbed into song! what spirit-voices sighed And mourned amid the cypresses! how dear The soft blue sky looked, and how peaceful too, As if to soothe me! Even the house looked strange, Like some new place I had not seen before. I walked as in a dream; I could not bear The common thingsâthe common speech of life; All that I asked was solitude and tears. For two long weary days I kept my room, Broken in body, sick to death at heart; And as I lay all prostrate on the floor After a sudden agony of tearsâ One of those bursts with which the tortured soul Relieves its passionâcame a sudden knock; It seemed as Death were knocking at the door. In walked the Count; I started to my feet, I strove to gather my disordered dress, And smooth my face, and wipe away my tears. My soul revolted, and I saw his eye, Dread as a basilisk's, upon me rest; A strange expression, never seen before, Was brandished there. He said, â'T is very strange Guido is gone, and leaves a note behind, More like a riddle than a note; and youââ His eyes filled up the gap his speech had left. âIs Guido gone?â I said; I could no more. For as he spoke these words the whole world seemed To slip beneath meâall my world was gone. Such weight as this upon the suffering heart Will show itself, however we may strive; And in an instant all my secret lay Before his gaze, as when a sudden wind Blows wide the closed leaves of a fatal book. He read the pageâhe never spoke a word, But paused a moment, read it up and down, Then turned and left me, terribly alone. The evening came to that distracting dayâ The evening comes at last to every day. Exhausted, in a hopeless lull of life, I watched the burning sunset slowly fade, Till all the clouds from rose had turned to pearl, And in the sky the silver splendor shone Of perfect moonlight; on the shadowy trees The moon looked pitying down, as if it sought To give me consolation from above, And Nature seemed to whisper me, âCome forth.â I could not rest, and down the dappled path, Where light and shade their strange mosaic wove, Through the old laurels took my aimless way. There, half as in a dream, I wandered on, And, weeping, praying, strove to ease my pain. The laurels murmured, âAh, we pity you!â The fountain babbled, âAh, unhappy one!â The nightingale sang out, âMy heart, my heart!â And all things seemed to weep and pray with me. Hark! did I hear a step upon the grass? Was that a ghost I saw amid the trees? Or Guido's self? or was my brain disturbed? No; in the shadow there was Guido's self;â âOh, heaven!â I cried. âOh, Guido! are you here? Flyâfly at once! Oh, wherefore are you here?â He rushed to meâand, oh! that glorious faceâ So haggard, worn, and ravaged with its woeâ How changed it seemed since I had seen it last! I cried out, âGo!â but all within me strained To clasp him, own him, cling around his neck;â I cried out, âGo!â as one in madness cries, âSave me!â and leaps to death in an abyss. A thousand prayers and longings, flinging out Their grasping hands, reached forward after him, And love, with all its sails blown sudden out, Strained at the cable of my weakened will. âI goâI go!â he cried; âI but returned To kiss again the ground your feet had pressed, To watch your far light in the window shine, To see your wandering shadow thereâand then Plunge back into my desolated world. But God hath sent you hereâHe pitied meâ He saw me grovelling like a tortured worm Crushed in the grass, and reached his hand to me. I see you, hear you, touch you, once againâ And can it only be to say, Adieu?â âOh, Guido, fly!â I cried, âfor I am weak; Fly from me if you love meâI am weak.â He stood a moment, wrestling with himself, I gazing at him; then a sudden power Seemed to transform him. âNo! I will not go! 'T is all in vainâI cannot, will not, go! Once I have fled, fleeing from joy, from hope, From life, from heaven. Whose hand then drew me back? Who led your footsteps here? Whose hand I say? Fate gives me you at last! Fate makes you mine!â Life is but mockery bereft of you. Fly, fly with me, and in some distant spot, Hid from the world, we may be happy yet.â His passion took me as a mighty gale, Crowded with thunder, drives upon the elm, Till all its straining branches groaning cry, And toss their helpless turbulence of leaves, And fall at last in one despairing crash; So, bearing down resolve, and blowing wild All my disordered thoughts, his passion came. Defencelessâweakened, both in strength and willâ Against this new arousing from within, Against this new appealing from without, Vain was resistance: I was in his arms! He seemed to hold me there by heaven's own right. The world was for a moment all forgotâ The world! I had the world there in my arms! Nothing then seemed so right, so pure, as love. Yes, I was his, irrevocably hisâ Come heaven, come hell, irrevocably his! 'T was but a moment's madness seized me thenâ A blank of reason such as comes to one Who, clinging for his life to some sheer cliff, Feels his strength going and his senses swim, And death come swooping down, and longs to drop And end it all: so, for a moment's space, I swooned; and then God's voice within me cried âNo!â and awaking, frightened at my fall, I pushed the dearest thing in life away. I know not whence I got my strength. Some handâ Whose hand but God's?âuplifted me. I stood Trembling on duty's heightâbut weak, so weakâ And cried, âOh, Guido, save me! I am yoursâ You mineâbut only as we both are God's. Save me! oh, save me! Do not let me fall.â That was a height to die onâbut I lived; Death always comes too early or too late. Life had its claims for penanceâso I lived; Nor will I murmur moreâperhaps 't is just. Those words of mine, like an electric flash, Broke the strained storm of madness in his sky, And the great shadow and the rain came downâ Shadow as of despair,âyet nobler far, Dearer in his despair than in his pride. The prayers he uttered for forgiveness then Were worst of all to bear,âI hear them still Ring in my ears; that face of his I see Streaming with tears; and those contorted hands, Grasping the air, or torturing themselves, Or wildly flung to heaven, still implore Our dear Madonna's blessing on my headâ What are so terrible as manhood's tears? At last we partedâHeaven alone knows howâ And all was over; I was left aloneâ Alone? I never more could be alone. The owl screamed near us in the cypress-tree. Half-dead, I saw him go as in a dream, And heard his footsteps down the gravel die. The gate swung with a clangââMy God! my God! Help me!â I moaned; only the owl replied. I dropped upon the seatâI hid my face Within my hands; all, all the world seemed gone. I longed to rise and call him back again, But my feet failed me. There I sat alone, Like him, half-marble, in the Arabian tale, Charmed by foul magic, when a distant sound Smote on my ears. It was the clash of steel. I started up, with sudden terror fired, And towards the gate I rushed. My flying feet Grating upon the gravel hushed the sound. I stopped to listen; there it was againâ And voices, tooâoh, heaven! Again I fled; Again I only heard my grating steps. I gained the gateâI listenedâall was still. The moon broke out behind a cloud, and smote The pale broad palace front, where nothing stirred; Only the tall dark cypresses made moan, And the hoar olives seemed like ghosts to flee Across the hillside, where a whisper ranâ â'T was but his sword that jangled on the ground,â I said; âfor see, how all is hushed to rest! Poor heart of mine, that trembles at a breath, Be calm again, and cast your fear away. But ah! the wretched days before we meetâ The sunless daysâyet we shall meet again.â The far-off bell upon the Campo tower Struck twelve as up the terrace-steps I went: I paused to soothe me with the landscape there. The shadowy earth was turning in its sleep, And winds were whispering over it like dreams; The luminous sky was listening overhead With its full moon, and few great throbbing starsâ One drowsing like a sick man, sad and dark; One watching like a spirit, pure and bright. All the damp shadow clinging to the ground, Shook with innumerable tiny bells, Rung by the grilli. In the distant pools Frogs trilled and gurgled; every now and then The plaintive hooting of the owl was heard Calling her owlets 'mid the cypresses; Near by, the fountain spilled, and far away The contadino's watchdog bayed and barked;â Yet all these sounds were soothed and harmonized By night's weird hand; and as I listening stood, Leaning against the columned balustrade, By aloe vases crowned, my turbulent thoughts Were calmedâI looked into the sky, and prayed. The Count not yet returned? Then all is safe. I took my lamp, and up the marble stairs My heart jarred to the echoes of my feet; A swinging shutter down the corridor So startled me, I nearly dropped the light. Was I possessed? Almost it seemed to me As if a spirit wandered in my room. I could not feel alone there; through my hair Ran shudders, and a creeping o'er my flesh. I searched the room, but there was nothing there. My silk dress as it rustled on the chair Scared me; the creeping curtain scared me too, And, daring not to move a hand or foot, I listened trembling. There was nothing there, Unless it was a ghost I could not see. My nerves were all ajarâthe buzzing flies I could not bear; but worse than all, the sense Of somethingâsome oneâthere within my room. My lamp extinguished, into bed I crept, And hid me 'neath the sheets, and wept such tears, And prayed such prayers, as desperate creatures pray. All night the Count returned not to his room; No step I heard, though long I lay awake. 'T was strangeâ't was not his wont. What could it mean? Troubled and overworn, at last I slept, Haunted by dreams that ran in dreadful ruts With weary sameness through my aching brain. The morning cameâthe Count was absent still. Possessed by vague and agitating fears, I waited almost as one waits for death; And after torturing hours, that seemed like years To my strained sense, I heard a step. The door Turned on its hinges, and there stood the Count: A cold false smile was on his lips; his look Was strangely calmânot real. Those hard eyes Betrayed a purpose that belied the lipsâ Belied the courtesy so overstrained. âI fear you did not look for me,â he said; âNor have I tidings that can give you joy. I came a sacred promise to fulfilâ One I could not refuse; and, as you know, All promises are sacred that I make. I promised Guido in your hands to place This, which he took from you, and now returns.â Saying these words, he on the table laid My ringâthe ring that I to Guido gave. Oh what an awful light was in his eyes! Oh what a devil's smile was on his lips! As there he stood, still as a marble man. My heart stopped beating, numbed by hideous fearâ There was a silence terrible as death: The terror stunned me, and I could not speak. Speak!âno, I could not feel. There was no sense In anything; my very blood was ice. I could not tell an instant if 't were he, My husband, standing thereâor if 't were I Who stood before him. Then I reeled and fellâ I did not swoon; I dropped into my chair Like one knocked down with an invisible blow. He moved not; but an instant after said, Slowlyâhis words like to the first great drops That tell the storm is coming, forced between His thin white lipsââYour cousin, madam, 's gone; That ring he sent; he said you 'd understand.â âOh God! God! God!â I cried, âit is not true! What do you mean by gone?âspeak, speak to me! Say 't is a dreamâoh, tell me 't is a jest; Oh yes, it is a jest, or you 'd not smile.â âJest! Do I look, then, like a jesting man? Woman, your lover, after your last kiss, Wiped my dishonor out with his heart's blood. He knew the wrong he didâsaw for us two, After such scene as that of yesternight The world was narrow; so he bravely fell To expiate the cruel wrong he did.â âDead! dead! oh God! oh Guido!âoh my God!â Something like this I shrieked, and moaned and fell. Slowly at last, and after hours, returned My scattered senses; and long days went byâ Eternities of utter reckless woe; With bursts of agony and burning tears, And daring hopes that all might be a lie, Mingled with prayers, half-raving, after death. I almost looked on God, who sent the sun, As heartless. Why should flowers and blossoms grow? Why should all nature look so bright and fair And birds be singing, and the world be gay, Except to mock me with its happiness? Then came as strong revulsions; ne'er before Knew I what wickedness was in my heart. In the excited tumult of my brain I could not see the rightâI felt the wrong; The great black hand of death before my eyes Darkened my conscience. Oh such savage thoughts As then roused up and ravaged in the dark! I could not calm myself to right resolve; Forgiveness seemed impossible to reachâ Starlike; but vengeance like a devil stood And offered me its sword, and tempted me, And would not let me hear the angel's voice; But still that sweet persistent voice within Kept calling, till it conquered me at last. I would forgive and crave forgiveness too. So governing the wild and cruel thoughts That growled for vengeance, I awaited him. At last he came; cold, stern, and dignified, That mask of honor came into my room. âWell, sir,â I said, âyou see me broken, crushed, Ruinedâa helpless, wretched, tortured thing. If I have been imprudent, heedless, wrongâ For so I wasâyou are at least avenged: Your foot has trodden on my erring heart, As if I were a worm upon your path. See how it writhes! Oh, sir! are you content? May God forgive you for your cruel wrong, And help me in my struggles to forgive.â âForgiveness! wrong! Your choice of terms is strange. I crave forgiveness? Let that task be yours; Ask it upon your knees of God and me. Wrong? There 's no wrong but what belongs to you. Though I regret what honor made me do, I did my duty; had you done but yours, All would be smooth and happy as it was.â âHappy! oh when was happiness for me, Or when again shall happiness be mine? Happy? Where 's Guido? Tell me that he lives; You could not speak of happiness to me, If you had killed him for a fault of mine. Say 't was a jest you used to frighten meâ Say this, and I will never see him more. Oh, I will do my duty with a smile, Bless you, and crave forgivenessâdo your will, And fetch and carry for you like a dog.â âYour duty! Yes, I think you will indeed; I shall take heed of that. Not see him more? For that, too, my security is good,â I am not used to do my work by halves.â Then the desire of deathâmy loveâhis bloodâ The pride and cruel calmness of the Countâ The taunting smile with which he looked at me, Roused all the evil passions I had quelled. All things will turn when tortured, and I cried, âOh, kill me then, too, with the self-same sword! Oh how I scorn you! let your passion speak! I loved himâloved himâloved him, do you hear? Out with your sword if you have any heart! Kill me in pity, since you 've murdered him.â âMurdered! no, hand to hand and point to point, With every chance, he fell; he owned his wrong. There lives no man in whom a single spark Of honor burns, that had not done as I; I gave him every chanceâhe lost, and fell.â âI say I loved him better than my life.â âFor that I killed him. He will love no more.â âHe loves me still,âabove as I below. Oh, I am his, he mine, beyond your powerâ You do but part us for a little space; And in the future, after life is o'er, My soul shall rush to clasp him closer there, Than could my human arms when here on earth.â âGinevra! do you heed the words you use? You dared not more than let him speak of love? Silent? You leave me then to think the worst.â âThink what you chooseâdo what you chooseâI loathe Alike your foul thoughts and your cruel act.â âThen my name 's blasted and my honor stained, And I have blazoned it to all the world.â âYour name, your honor stained! Ay, so it is! But not by me, not by my guiltless loveâ Guiltless, though fatal. Not a thought for mine Held back your hand. Blindly, through Guido's life, My honor too you struck at, blazoning To the wide world that ours was guilty love.â âI would to God that none of this had been!â âNor had it ever been, except for you. You bound the life of Guido unto mine; You brought him here, you tempted both of us, And now affect surprise to find we loved. Careless of others, centred in yourself, You could not claim a love you never gave. What debt beyond allegiance did I owe?â âWhat have you ever asked that was not given? My wealth, my name, my rank, my house, were yours, And in return you stain my ancient name, For all the world to point its finger at. A husband's duty I at least have doneâ And honestly, I think. Have you a wife's?â âI have done all I could. Oh, pity me, And do not urge a desperate creature on. Think what I suffer. Pity and forgive. I own my faultâI ask you to forgive. I was not all to blame; you, too, must bear A portion of the wrongâat least be just.â âWhat was my fault?âwhat portion of the wrong? Be just, you say. Of course I shall be just.â âFor this, at least, you were to blame: you swore To love, to honor, and to cherish me For all my life. How did you keep your oath? You left me all defenceless to be prey To solitude, to idleness, to chance. What have I asked, you say, that was not given? Love, loveâ't was that I craved; not title, wealth, Or name, but daily acts of tenderness. God knows how long I strove, how earnestly, To patch with duty the great gap of love. It would not do; my nature yearned for more. Well! give a starving wretch upon a wreck A golden florin when he cries for bread! Will it suffice? No; 't is mere mockery. And so were all your vaunted giftsâno flower In the chill ruin of my hopes you left; By heartless duties, dull routine, you froze My eager nature;âsudden, like the breath Of southern spring, with all its roses in it, Love breathed across meâall my life broke up Like some great river's ice at touch of spring, And I was borne in one great burst away.â âFine phrasesâpretty picturesânothing more! And did no thought of honor hold you back?â âHonor! ah, honor! wretched mud-built dam! Could that avail to stem the swollen stream? Acts, yesâbut nothing else. If I was stunned, Aghast, to feel the formless dreams of love Take passion's tyrannous and threatening shape, What help was there. Oh no, you cannot see! As well the stagnant pool, all creamed with green, Sees why the torrent, shaking its white spray, And mad with all the tumult of its course, Can pause not on the brink of the abyss. Who put temptation in my very path? Youâyou who should have held meâdragged me down. What right had you to leave me to such chance?â âIt was a fault, I seeâit was a fault. But who could think you such a worthless thing As take the first fair apple Satan gave? Curse, curse the hour, O woman, when you did! His blood is on your hands, and not on mine; Wipe it away, then, if you can, with words. You knew the path you trod led straight to death. You ventured allâyour fameâmy nameâhis lifeâ For what?âto satisfy a moment's whim. You, like a child that sees a pretty flower That 's caught a holding down a precipice, Dared everything to wear it on your breast. Your foot slippedâwhy, of course, of course it slipped, Weak woman-brainâand down to death you went. Go, wet his grave now with your idle tears; Will they bring back the life you sacrificed?â âOh, had you loved me this had never been! I sought a flower? I sought it for a whim?â Ah, no! Love tempted with a ripe, rare fruit A starving creature, who refused the gift, And laid her down to die for honor's sake. I did refuse itâyes, you know I did. Nay, look not on me with that devil's smile; It makes me almost hate you. Not alone 'T is love you lack, but pity, but remorse, But conscience! Never shall that hand again, Stained by his blood, touch mineâ't is widowed now. Nay, play not with your poniard,âout with it! Strike! there 's no thing that wants its death so much. Strike! here I stand. Strike as you struck at him! Strike, soul of honor! Ah! you calculateâ Your cold blood cannot stir. I see your eyesâ They are arranging. No, it will not do To trust an impulseâyou must think it out. Oh, be a man for once, and dare to strike!â I know I touched himâtouched him to the quick; I saw it in the twitching of his hands: Yet there he stood, with his contemptuous smile That maddened every feeling. All at once A sudden cord within my brain gave way; The pulse's hammers in my temples beat. The last thing that I saw was his black eyesâ I see them still; then with a cymbal's clash The sunlight shattered to a myriad sparks; And what became of me, God only knows. When to my senses I again returned, I felt myself borne rapidly along In a horse-litter. To my brain confused All the last scene came back again to me; For every word had burned into my soul, But not as aught that really had been, Only an ugly, wild, and hideous dream; And mixed with it a thousand horrid thoughts, That seemed as real as the actual were. I tore the curtains open, and looked out; I asked no questionâfor, had I been dead, I had not cared less what they did with me; Life had gone byâ't was just the same as death When on the floor I fainted. Now I woke Into a kind of life that was not mine: The night itself was weird, like all my thoughts; Strange clouds piled wildly all along the sky, And, hurrying to and fro, shut out its light. The earth was swallowed up in heavy dark; Low thunder growled; at sudden fits the sky Winked with white lightnings 'neath the black low brows Of clouds along the horizon, and glared out Across the world, and showed the trembling trees Ghastly against it; then the black again Swallowed the world up, and I heard great drops Beat on the leaves. From one low threatening cloud, That rose to meet us, leaped out suddenly A crinkled snake of fire, then darted in; And thunder trampled with tumultuous roar: Or was it rather that the angel flashed His sword of jagged fire that drove me out From Paradise, and God's dread voice I heard Behind the cloud to threaten my lost soul? All worn and weak, and shattered in my nerves, I could not bear the sight; and back I fell, Only half-conscious; and I seemed to feel The horse's hoofs keep beating on my brain; And now and then a startling thunder-peal. All sense of time was gone. At last I slept, Or swoonedâfor all things faded into blank. What happened afterwards I do not know: What first I saw, when any sense came back, Were these four walls, and my old Rosa's face Looking on mine with pity as she bent Above my pillow, and I heard her say, âO blessed Virgin!âsee, she wakes at last!â From that day forward, now for ten long years, Here is my prison; here the sad sun shines, But never shines for me a loving smile. His face, that would have made the dreariest spot A paradise, has gone beyond the world; And he that spared my life and crushed my heart Since that last day has never looked on me. This is his vengeanceâhe has hid me here, Beyond all hope of change, to waste away, Unloved, uncared for, like an outcast thing, To suck the fever's pestilential air, And see the sad Maremma's lonely waste, And hear the beating of the restless sea; While in its marsh of drear monotony, Life breeds its poison-thoughts, and wastes, and rots. Ah death! death! death! how have I prayed for you! You take the happy, fold them in your arms, And kiss them to the slumber of the blest; But from my path in scorn you turn aside. Oh! think what years they 've buried me alive In this drear villa all alone, alone; Long days aloneâlong, long black nights alone; And I was never over-brave, you know. Imprisoned with the recollected past, Without a future, weak with illness too, I grew to fear my very self (what more Is there on earth to fear?). My eyes looked strange In these blear mirrors. Through the noiseless night Often I lay and shuddered in the blank Dead waste of darkness, while my great square room Seemed like a shadowy tomb to shut me in; And all the darkness weighed on me like death. Then, straining out into the empty void, My eyes made globes of pale electric fire, That swelled and faded into globes of black, And hours I used to watch them come and go. Nor was it better, when the sad-faced moon Mocked at me in its far-off silentness. Daylight at times was worse: the blazing sun Flashed on the sea that shook its burning plates, And through the shutters' slightest chink peered in To crawl and quiver on the ceiling there. Hide as I would, I felt the fierce white noon Seethe round the house and eat into my room, In busy silence prying to and fro As if in search of me. All was so still, Despite the shrill cicale's saw without, And maddening burring buzz of flies within. Even the melancholy wash of waves Broke not the silenceânor the voiceful pines, That always whispered though the breezes slept. Only my echoing feet in the great hall, As to and fro I paced, broke the dead calm. And thus the dreary, weary days passed byâ No duty to be done, no life to live; For surely what I lived was never life. Was it, then, strange I lost my head at last? But that is over now, and passed away; 'T is only when the fever comes, my thoughts Dance to discordant music. Then at times They seem to gather to a single point, And, widening, whirl and whirl with buzz and din Till all the world swarms like a spinning mass, And down, down, down, as in a maelstrom's cone, My spirit, worn with struggle, madly goes, Like a lost ship, and all becomes a blank. Thus, helpless, down the vortex borne I reel, Until, the fever gone, a wretched wreck Flung out I find me on the shores of life. Ah! dearest, Joy unto the spirit is What light is to the flowersâno color else, Joy is the voice of Goodâthe voice of God; And when my heart was barren of all joy, It sicklied like a plant deprived of light. I have been madâwho would not have been mad?â And hideous visions have obscured my soul. Long time some dreadful thing I had to hideâ Some vague and dreadful thing, without a name. Here in the walls it lived and peeped at me; Long lonely nights kept whispering at my blinds, Leaped out of flowers when I had gathered them, And placed them on my bosom; with its laugh Scared the still noon, and would not let me rest. That went at last, though sometimes it returns; And though I know 't is all a hideous dream, Yet through my tangled thoughts so long it trod, It wore a track there that will never go. And for a moment often it returns, And I seem mad because I speak of it; But do not think I'm mad, or not more mad Than any human creature kept so long In this wild place alone, and with such things. When all is dark, on dismal gusty nights, Ghosts wander all around this lonely house, And smothered groans and stifled shrieks I hear, That mingle with the beating of the sea. Sometimes the giant rafters creak and strain, And overhead there rush tumultuous feet,â Or slow and heavy steps, with clank of spurs, Stride nearer, nearer up the sounding stairs, Till, wild with fear, I see the shaking door Swing open slowly on its creaking hinge, To let some ghastly unseen horror in. But most I dread to pass that banquet-hall, Where rotting cobwebs flaunt their dusky flags From its black beamsâor up the chimney suck, When through its sooty throat the tempest roars; For then fierce spirits seem to hold carouse, And with their hideous revelry and laugh Jar the loose windows; and the shields and swords Clang on the walls as if they longed for blood. All this, you'll say, is fancy. Live here, then, Through the drear winter all alone, alone, With these wild terrors grasping after you. O God! we were not made to live aloneâ We all go mad if we are left alone. My child, too. Ah, my little Angelo! Where are you now?âOh, tell me where he is! That little rosy face that hid itself Around my neck with both hands clasping it. Oh, such long years since I have felt those hands! How cruel, cruel, from my arms to tear The only thing he gave me that I loved! How many nights I've dreamed that he was here; How many mornings waked, and wept, and wailed To find me here aloneâmore desolate For the sweet dream that came and went at will. He has grown up to boyhood now, I know. He has forgotten meâmy name 's a word Banned to his lipsâhe knows not that I live; Yet in my memory how alive he is, A baby blessingâwith those four white teeth Gleaming beneath the little sudden smile, The dimpled elbows and the rosy feet Never at restâthe unformed chirping words Like a bird's languageâall the many ways With which he crept into my very heart. Oh! 't was a cruel act, a wicked act, To tear him from me. How has he grown up Without a mother's love? Oh, justice, Count!â Your justiceâdid it soothe his little cries? He has your name, but not, I pray, your heart. One drop of love is worth a well of pride. Why should I cling to life? A hundred times I 've pressed this dagger to my throbbing heartâ A hundred times I have not dared to strike; And yet how blest a thing were death to me! I think at last my time is drawing near. Ah, heaven! I hope 't is drawing near at last, I have so suffered. Even he would strike That sword of his in justice to my heartâ He would relent, I thinkâI hope he wouldâ Could he but see me now; even he to whom Mercy is slow to whisper would forgive. Justice so strained is vengeance, nothing moreâ All has so changed, and I was wrong, I know. Yet no! What do I say?âhe, he forgive? Never! They only can forgive who love. He knows not pity for an erring heart. Justice and honor:âthese two are his gods; To them alone his sacrifice is given. Why do I rail at him? Do I forgive? Am I so free from blot? Was I all right? Ah, no! we both were wrong, we all were wrong! In these long days reviewing all the past I know and feel how very wrong we were. I plainly see (the passion cleared away) No fit excuse for Guido and for me. Tempted we were beyond our human power; But after marriage-vows, if love come in, Its torture we must own and bearâlike death. My punishment is justâhis too, perhaps; But man is not to blame as woman is. Mine was the greater fault: I led him on, He loved me so; and he was all alone. I should have checked his love when it began; I should have bade him go, and turned my thoughts To household duties; but I played with fire, And mine the fault that both were sacrificed. The Count was not so wrong as then he seemed; And from his view his deed was justified. And he has suffered tooâand I forgiveâ Yes, as I need forgiveness, I forgive. And so I pray for all, even for the Count; And, looking forward, fix my eyes above, To meet my Guido when this life is past. What matters it?âa few short years, or months, Or weeks, perhapsâor even a few more daysâ And I shall be with him, where love 's no crime, And God, who sees the heart, will pity me. Oh, yes! God's law is tenderer than man's. He is not only justâbut pity too, And love, unbounded love, He has for all; And He will make all smooth and right at last. So let me weep upon your breast, dear friendâ My only solace for these long, long years. God will remember you for thisâHis arm Is longâHis memory will never fail; And He will make all smooth and right at last. RADICOFANI. âQuivi era l' Aretin che dalle braccie Fiere di Ghin di Tacco ebbe la morte.â I. This is a barren, desolate scene, Grim and gray, with scarce a tree, Gashed with many a wild ravine Far away as the eye can see; Ne'er a home for miles to be found, Save where huddled on some grim peak A village clinging in fear looks round Over the country vast and bleak, As if it had fled from the lower ground, Refuge from horrors there to seek. II. Over the spare and furzy soil With never a waving grain-field sowed, Raggedly winds with weary toil The shining band of dusty road,â Down through the river's rocky bed, That is white and dry with summer's drought, Or climbing some sandy hillock's head, Over and under, in and out, Like a struggling thing by madness led, That wanders along in fear and doubt. III. What are those spots on yon sandy slope Where the green is frayed and tattered with gray? Are they only rocksâor sheep that crop The meagre pasture?âone scarce can say. This seems not a place for flowersâbut behold! How the lupine spreads its pink around, And the clustered ginesta squanders its gold As if it loved this barren ground; And surely that bird is over-bold That dares to sing o'er that grave-like mound. IV. It is dead and still in the middle noon; The sand-beds shine with a blinding light, The cicali dizzen the air with their tune, And the sunshine seems like a curse to smite; The mountains around their shoulders bare Gather a thin and shadowy veil, And shrink from the fierce and scorching glareâ And close to the grass so withered and pale Hovering quivers the glassy air, And the lizards pant in their emerald mail. V. Think of this place in the dreary gloom Of an autumn twilight, when the sun Hiding in banks of clouds goes down, And silence and shadow are coming on;â White mists crawlâone lurid light Glares from the west through a broken cloudâ Rack hurries aboveâthe dubious night Is creeping along with its spectral crowd; Would it, I ask, be a startling sight To meet a ghost here in a shroud? VI. One of the thousand murdered men Who have stained the blasted soil with blood? Does the lupine get its color then From some victim pashed to death in the mud? Has the yellow ginesta the hue of the gold From the traveller here in terror torn? Was yon bird but a sprite, singing so bold, That in life a maiden's form had worn, And at night steals back in its shape of old To haunt the darkness pale and forlorn? VII. Look at that castle whose ruins crown The rocky crest of yonder height, Still frowning over the squalid town, That cowers beneath as if in affright. From his eyrie there to glut his beak The robber swooped to his shuddering prey, And the ghosts of the past still haunt the peak Though robber and baron have passed away. And, hark! was that the owl's long shriek, Or a ghost's that flits through the ruins gray? VIII. 'T is blood and gold wherever I gaze, And tangled brambles, stiff and gray,â A scowling, ugly, terrified place, A spot for murder and deadly fray. On such a barren, desolate heath, When shadows were deepening all around, The sisters weird before Macbeth Rising, hovered along the ground, And echoed his inward thought of death, And vanished again behind a mound. IX. Such were the thoughts that filled my breast, Wandering here one lonely night, When sudden behind a rock's dark crest Uprose a shape of portentous height. A coal-black plume from his helmet flowed, His eyes in the visor's shadow gleamed, And here and there a steel-flash showed An outline vague and dim that seemed To hover along the dusky road Like a thing that is neither real nor dreamed. X. In his hand he bore a mighty spear, Tall as a pine and stained with blood. Transfixed in horror and ghastly fear, With knocking knees I before him stood. âWho and what art thou?â I cried, âMonstrous figure, of noiseless tread, That out of the darkness thus dost stride?â The black plume shook on the lofty headâ A hollow voice from the helm repliedâ Hollow and vague like the voice of the dead. XI. âGhino di Tacco was my name! I come to answer your sneering thought! Start not! Listen before you blame! The fool condemns what he knoweth not. Call me robber or call me knight, But listen to me while my tale I tell. I struck, the oppressed and weak to right: My blows on the strong and cruel fell. For vengeance I struck! If my hand was light Ask Benincasaâdown in hell. XII. âOn the slopes of Arbia's banks arose The little castle that gave me birth, When my father's strongest, bitterest foesâ The Santafioriâcursed the earth. Him they hated, for he was brave; Him they hunted, for he was good. The bandit was strong the weak to save, The blows of his heavy sword were rude; But treason dug for him his grave, And the Santafiori bought his blood. XIII. âAh that wild and terrible night!â Here the spectre his great spear raised; And his coal-like eyes, with angry light, Like a furnace roused by the blast, out-blazed. âScreams of women, and groans and sighs, Clashing of steel, a swirl of flame, Mixed with a tumult of savage cries, Woke me. I shouted my father's name: When sudden, before my terrified eyes, Through the smoke a pale shape swiftly came. XIV. â'T was my mother. She seized me in her arms, And forth she rushed in the stormy night. Her strained eyes glared so in wild alarm, They scared me. I uttered a shriek of fright. âSilence, my child, for your life!â she said. Then swift we stole down the hillside bare, And up again through the dark wood fled; While the sky was lit by a lurid glare, And the great trees, roaring overhead, Hurtled and heaved in the bleak night air. XV. âTo yonder castle that frowns above, By many a devious path we went; And nurtured there with pious love My growing days as a boy were spent. Night by night, when tolled for the dead The great tower-bell, at its solemn call, My mother, in black, with a mournful tread, And with her a lady, dark and tall, My childish fearful footsteps led To a shrine built into the tower's thick wall. XVI. âBefore a crucifix there a light Burnt dim and sad in the gloomy shade. And oft, in the solemn silent night, Weeping, they kneeled with me and prayed. One night the lady came alone. âWhere is my mother?â in fear, I cried. Then, with a kiss and a broken tone, âPoor child!â the lady in black replied. And I knew by her voice my mother was gone, And my heart grew still as it had died. XVII. âYears went on. My wondering heart Strove through the shadowy veil to pierce. I wandered many an hour apart, And my boyish spirit grew dark and fierce. âWhose,â I cried, âis that heavy spear, And that blood-stained shirt against the wall?â âYour father's,â she said. âWhy hang they there?â âAsk me not nowâ't would your heart appal! When you are able that spear to bear, Vengeance is yoursâyou shall then know all.â XVIII. ââVengeance is yours;ââday after day These words in secret I brooded o'er. They cast their shade on my boyish play, Through my dreams a painful path they wore. I longed for manhood. Within me grew A craving desire the key to gain To this terrible mystery. Muscle and thew I strove to strengthen with might and main; For my father's spear was heavy, I knew, And my boyish attempts to wield it vain. XIX. âPanting, I hacked at the mountain oak, Till it fell with a heavy crash and groan; The gnashing wild-boar felt my strokeâ By his heels I dragged him home alone; Daily at tilt and sword I tried My growing strength. I laughed at fear. Danger to me was as a bride, The sound of whose voice I leaped to hear. Till at last, with a thrill of manhood's pride, I brandished aloft my father's spear. XX. âFiercely I cried, as its weight I shook, âRead me the riddleâthese arms are strongâ Longer delay I will not brook; This heart is boldâit has waited long.â That night I started in wild surprise; For a voice cried out, in my dreaming ear, âSon of a murdered man, arise! The hour is come!â âBehold me here!â I answered;âand there, before my eyes, Was the form of the lady standing near. XXI. âSternly she took me by the hand, And straight to the chapel my steps she led. I saw the spear by the altar stand; The bloody shirt was across it spread. The open Evangel before me stood. âThere,â as she grasped my arm, she cried, âAre the last red drops of your father's blood, When under the headsman's axe he died. For know that he fell not in battle or feud, As a soldier falls, at his comrade's side. XXII. ââVainly he fought in that fearful fray When his castle was stormed; but a faithful few Bore him, senseless and wounded, away,â And a bandit's life thenceforth he knew. From lair to lair, o'er the mountains steep, Like a wounded lion, they tracked his way. His sword drank blood;âbut in his sleep The Santafiori seized their prey. They dared not kill; but their plot was deep,â And a base judge gave him to death for pay. XXIII. ââEre on the scaffold fell his head, He called a vassal, and said, âThis spear, And the shirt my murdered blood makes red, Are the heritage of Ghino dear. When he can bear and wield it well, Tell him the tale of his father's death; How he shall use it his heart will tell. I bless him now with my latest breath. Say to his motherââ His voice here fellâ Your mother is sleeping this stone beneath. XXIV. ââStruck, as by death, when she heard his fate She fell, for her strength with her hope had fled. On her grave you stand. I, forced to wait, Tell you for her the words of the dead. See! the Evangel is under your hand! Swear to revenge your father's fame! Burn on your heart, as with a brand, Benincasa's accursed name! Seek him in Romeâwhere the plot was planned That doomed your father to death and shame! XXV. ââBind that bloody shirt to your heart! Lift the spear! The bell strikes oneâ The gates are openâat once depart, And never return till your duty 's done. This is no longer a home for youâ You look like your father standing there,â If in your veins his blood runs true You know what there is to do and dare. Go! if this story thrill you through, Swear to revenge your father. Swear! XXVI. ââGo! When that villain's head you bring, Bridge shall fall, and portcullis rise, And the bells of Radicofani ring; But never till then dare meet these eyes.â The light burned dim as thus she spoke; I grasped the spear with a thrill of rage; I struck my clenched hand on the book And swore my oath on its holy page, Never again on the place to look Till his blood my vengeance should assuage. XXVII. âThe grinding bridge with a clang went down, The tempest roaredâthe lightning flashedâ The wind through the great gate sucked with a groan As my horse's hoofs on its pavement dashed. Four hundred horsemen were at my sideâ One word, and their swift swords left the sheath, And crossed with a clash. Vengeance! they criedâ To Rome! Then over the sandy heath Closely we galloped, a long fierce ride To Rome, with the settled purpose of death. XXVIII. âAlone at the Campidoglio's base I stood. The hated shape was there; The Senator's foul and ugly face, That brought my father to his despair; The cursed, livid, hideous head, With flabby mouth, and streamy eyesâ He heard in the hall my clanging tread. He looked with a leer of cold surprise, And âWhat do you seek of me?â he said. âA debt!â I answered, âa bloody prize!â XXIX. âHe started and trembled in ghastly fright, For a terrible memory on him smote,â My father I seemed to his bleary sight. âVillain,â I said, as I grasped his throat, âGo down to hell in your despair!â A strangled gasp from his lips there came, âSave me! oh God!âââGo! Judas, bear To God your deeds of crime and shame! Turrino di Tacco is waiting there! The mercy you meted to himâreclaim!â XXX. âI plunged my dagger into his heart,â His head from his bleeding trunk I hewed,â His vassals terrified stood apart As I strode through the gathering multitude,â I stuck that head on my father's spear. âRoom!â I cried, as my sword I drew; âHe meets the fate of this villain here Who hinders my path!â They saw and knew Death in my eyes. They left me clear My path, and I strode in safety through. XXXI. âSwift to the castle's bridge I sped. âDown with the drawbridge, men of mine!â High up I lifted the ghastly head. âDown with the bridge! You know the sign.â Clang went the chains with a clattering din. The castle's lady I found in prayer At the lonely shrine as I entered in. She lifted her eyes. âYou, Ghino! where Is the traitor's head?â âHe died in his sin;â And I flung the head on the pavement there. XXXII. âThen through Siena rose a cry, But the Santafiori strove in vain; From the eyrie of Radicofani I swooped and swept them from hill and plain; Their castles I burned, their lands laid waste. Refuge they sought in the city's wall, The cup they had proffered was theirs to taste; I saw my foes before me fall, But a price on my bandit head was placed. XXXIII. âYet never, a bandit though I was, Was my sword disgraced by useless crime; With the weak and poor I made my cause, And my deeds were sung in many a rhyme. At my table the beggar found a feast, Though the cruel baron felt my sword; I sheared the ambitious worldly priest, But the ruined peasant his farm restored; Cursed by the proudâby the humble blessedâ I broke no promise in act or word. XXXIV. âThere rots my castle on yonder height!â Mortal! this promise of you I claim, Tell the story I tell to-night Whenever you mention Di Tacco's name.â âI promise,â I cried. The figure bowed His lofty stature and clinched his spear, And slow, like the mist of a fading cloud, In the shadow I watched it disappear. And my heart in my bosom beat aloud With a feeling of mystery, doubt, and fear. GIANNONE. DEDICATED TO E. S. Take a cigarâdraw up your chair, There 's at least a good half-hour to spare Before the Capuchin clock strikes one, And the bell, with a sharp spasmodic tinkle, Rouses the Frati to shuffle to prayer, And the altar candles begin to twinkle In the cheerless chapel, bleak and bareâ By Jove! we are better off here than there. And now, as that friend of yours has gone, There 's a word I must whisper to you, alone. Friends grow dearer, and hearts draw nearer, Calmed in the silent centre of night; And words we may say, that the full mid-day, If it should hear us, would jeer outright. Day, with its din, for distrust and doubt! Night for confidence, friendship, love! The day's work done, and the world shut out, The streets all silent, the stars above, Pleasant it is to gather about The fire of wood, and muse and dream, And talk of the hopes and joys of youth, And open our hearts and confess the truth, Ceasing to make-believe and seem. Fling another log on the fire, Another log from the Sabine hill, And a heap of those rusty crackling canes That out on the sunny Campagna plains Held on their trellis the grape-hung vine, Whose blood was drained for this purple wine, Our straw-enwoven fiasco to fill. Look! the old tendrils, stiff as wire, Cling to them still with their strong desire, Outlasting deathâas our friendship will. How the flame bickers, and quivers, and flickers, Darting its eager tongues about! Then blazes abroad with genial flashes, Till the sap comes singing and bubbling out. Wild as a MÅnad with myriad fancies, Hither and thither it leaps and dances, Fitful, whimsical, glad, and free, Like a living thing with a heart and soul. Oh, the wood-fire is the fire for me! Away with your heartless mechanical coal, Your vulgar drudge, so sullen and slow, That ne'er with a flame of fancy flashes, But burns with a grim and business glow, And crumbles away to dirty ashes, And smells of the furnace and factory. Talk of the home and hearth! of late Nothing we 've had but house and grateâ Nothing in England to warm to the core, Like the vast old chimneys and fires of yore, When the great logs blazed with a genial roar. Hark to that mossy log, whose heart The contadino has cloven apart, Singing its death-song! How it tells What the cicadÃ¦ chirped in the dells, When it was young, and its leafy pride Shadowed Pan with its branches wide; And what old Auster, bluff and bold, Screamed in its ear while it shivered with cold. Thousands of idyls it has to sing, Of love and summer, of youth and spring; Of the Dryad that slipt with her rustling dress Into its murmurous leafiness; Of the rout of Bacchanals, ivy-crowned, Shaking the air with the cymbal's sound, While the yawning panther's velvet foot Pressed the rank grasses over its root;â Of the timorous Naiad, pearled with dew, That fled to the bubbling torrent near, And, hid by the bushes, looked trembling through At the smooth-limbed Bacchus, in love and fear; Of the chance and change of the season's spell, Of musical birds and odorous flowers, Of the storm that swept like a chorded shell The groaning forestâof whispering showers, Of all that, rooted there, it beheld, Since first in its veins the young sap swelled. But what like this has your coal to tell? Black old mummy; what has it known, Since the earth was a bubbling lava-vat, Sunk in its dreary silent tomb, But the earthquake's rumbling sound of doom, Till it leapt to light with a split and groan, With a toad, perhaps, encased in its stoneâ How can you warm your heart at that? How the wood blazes! Fill my glass! This Lacryma Christi goes to the heart, And makes the olden memories start, Like an April rain on last year's grass. How the days go! how the hours pass! Sometimes like a thousand years it seems, And then like a little month of dreams, Since the Odes of Horace you taught me to scan, And helped me over Homeric crevasses, I, stumbling along where you lightly ran, By the shores of the Poluphloisboio Thalassesâ Then how I longed to be a man, Though thrilling with all a boy's joy of the lasses, With my crown just even with your shoulder, Looking with reverence up to youâ Longing to know the things you knew, You six feet high and ten years older, And leaping over with quiet ease What brought me staggering on to my knees. Then I remember you went to Rome, And on the hem of your garment brought Odors back to our quiet home, That ravished with sweetness my boyish thought. How your talk, like an o'erbrimmed cup, Ran over with beauty, my heart drank up;â Oranges, olivesâtinkling guitars, Skies all throbbing with palpitant stars, Moonlighted terraces, gardens, and groves, Bubbling of nightingales, cooing of dovesâ Portia's, Laura's, and Juliet's loves,â Everything lovely I seemed to see When you were talking of Italy; There you almost seemed to have met Titian, Raffaelle, Tintoret, And felt the grasp of Angelo's hand, And known Da Vinci, so calm and grand, And walked in that glorious company, Whose starry names are above us seen Like constellations in the sky; And you in that marble world had been, Where the Grecian and Roman gods still reign, And lord it in Art's serene domain; And behind the veil of talk you wove, Their figures, half-hidden, seemed to move, And, beckoning, smileâto pass away At a single touch of my everyday. Ah! the old dreamsâold timesâold joysâ Buried beyond the Present's noise, How still they sleep beneath time's river! All of their sorrows and pains forgot, All of their beauty, without a blot, Living to perfume the memory forever. Well! once you filled my heart with wine, That made me drunk with a life divine; And I pour into yours, as a recompense, Small beer of advice and common sense. You were a poet to me at home, I'll be a preacher to you in Rome. So, to come out of this dreamy land, To the business matter of fact in hand; You know that fellow that just went outâ But pray, do you know his business here?â How he is livingâwhat he 's about, Here in Rome this many a year? Somebody introduced him? He seems A sort of a pious good-natured fool,â A convert, they told you, with dreams and schemes For the Church's universal rule? All very well; but what are his means? Faith is lovely, but is not food;â The heart has its pulse, but the stomach needs beans, And texts don't do when the appetite 's rude. Man 's but a poor weak creature at best, Till the fiend in the belly is lulled to rest. Throw him his dose, and the road is free For meditation and sanctity. Now look me, my old friend, straight in the eyeâ Unless appearances grossly lie (I'm as sorry to say it as you to hear, But after midnight one must be sincere), That fellow 's only a Government Spy! Of course you 're surprisedâThere 's nothing on earth So base in your eyes as a Government Spy; He 's half an Englishman, too, by birth, So the thing is an impossibility. Be calm, my friend, that 's the way it looks To us poor sinners; but we mistake: The law is different in his books;â He acts for the Holy Church's sake; And there 's nothing so dirty you may not do, With absolution and blessing tooâ Not to speak of the money partâ If the Church's good you have at heart. Holy fictions are never lies; 'Tis the pious purpose purifies. And pray distinguish, if you please, Those who, like martyrs, sacrifice Instincts of commonest decencies, Seeking to win an immortal prize From merely common vulgar spies. Spirito Santo 's not the same As Aqua VitÃ¦, even in name. Spirito Santo mumbles and prays The while his friend to death he betrays; Aqua VitÃ¦ is bought and sold, And frankly admits that he works for gold. For, âBah!â he says, âa man must live, And holes there are in every one's sieve. Nobody 's pure as he pretends, And we all eat dirt for our selfish ends. Pride is the ruin of angel and man; All of us do as well as we can; You at my dirty business scoff, But silver spoons are found in the trough. Cheaper than you I am, I'll admit, Because I am poorer, not worse a whit. A beggar's sole chance is to sleep in a ditch; I 'd be respectable tooâwere I rich; But calling names don't break any bones, And eggs are eggs, though you call them stones.â Talk as vulgar as this your friend Is ready as you to reprehend: For, âAh!â he says, âwe cannot refuse Our crosses and burdens, though hard to bear: The world 's always ready to sneer and abuse, But we must answer their scoffs with a prayer: Our duty is not for us to choose. Fallible reason to man is given; The Church alone has the keys to heaven; She only knows what is purest and best, And her servants humbly must do her behest. She doeth a mighty good with a fool, And, using me as a worthless tool, If I mistake, and stumble, and fall, She shall give absolution for all.â Now I may be deceived, and I hope I am; But a wolf may borrow the fleece of a lamb, And I fear your friend is that kind of sham. But listen, I'll spin a yarn for you, And every thread of it 's simply true; And then you can come to your own decision, If I'm right or wrong in my suspicion. 'T is years, as you know, that I 've lived in Rome, Till now it 's familiar to me as home; And 't is years ago I knew Giannone, A capital fellow, with great black eyes, And a pleasant smile of frank surprise, And as gentle a pace as a lady's pony, Ready to follow wherever you bid; His oaths were, âPer Bacco!â and âDio mio!â And âGuardi!â he cried to whatever you said; Though not overfreighted with esprit or brio, His heart was better by far than his head. His education was rather scanty; But what on earth could he have done With an education, having one, Unless he chose for the scarlet to run, And study the Fathers and lives of the Santi? Nevertheless, I know he had read, Because he quoted them, Tasso and Dante; And so often he recommended the prosy Promessi Sposi, I must suppose he Had also achieved that tale of Manzoni; And besides Monte Christo and Uncle Tom, And the history of Italy and Rome, (For he thoroughly knew how Liberty's foot Had been pinched, and maimed, and lamed in her boot), He had studied with zeal the book of the Mass, And Libretti of all the operas. This little learning sufficed for Giannone, And, sooth to say, as little money; Most of the latter he spent upon dress, And his life was neither more nor less Than the difficult problem, day by day, To drive the cursÃ¨d time away. So having nothing himself to do, He would dawdle away your morning for you. When you were silent to drive him away, You missed your manâhe would stay and stay, With the same old phrases, the livelong day. And smiling at nothing, and so content He lounged at his ease on your sofa there, Or peeped in your boxes without your consent, Or paced through the room, or, pausing, stood At the glass, and examined himself with care, And arranged his cravat, or moustache, or hair. And so pleased if you threw him a word or two, That you had no heart to be downright rude, And say, âMy dear fellow, you really intrude;â Or if at last you were ready to swear, And cried, âI am busy; I 've something to do!â Dull as a stone to what you meant, he Would quietly settle himself in his chair, And smiling answer, with fatuous air, âFaccia, senza complimenti.â His room was an armory of swordsâ Some blades scribbled with Koran words, Some long and thin, some short and stout, Some crooked, some straight, some curved about. He had ancient guns and pistols too, One-barrelled, six-barrelled, old and new, With every species of bore and stock, And every imaginable lock; Daggers, with hilts by Cellini made, Or so at least Giannone said; A savage bludgeon from Southern Seas, A Turkish scimitar's gilded blade, An Indian tomahawk and a creese;â Everything murderous, terrible, wild, Pleased this creature, so gentle and mild. On his wall was a head of Rachel, of course, Flanked by two dogs, a stag, and a horse From Landseer's brush, and, poised on her neat toe, The delicate sylph-like shape of Cerito. On his hearth-rug lay a lion's skin, And a couple of dogs made a terrible din, Yelping and screaming at all that came in. And here he lay, in his warlike den, And made his breakfast on âcafÃ¨ au lait,â The very idlest of idle men, Smoking and gaping the morning away, And handling his pistols now and then; Shabby enough in his dressing-gown, With a soiled shirt on, and his slippers down, And a scarlet fez with a tassel blue Perched on his head, not over-new. But as soon as the morning he 'd worried by, The grub would change to a butterflyâ Burst from his chrysalis, and appear Like an English milord, with a million a-year; And when his elaborate toilet was done, He really fancied he looked like one. Yet, despite his short bepocketed coat, His mutton-chop whiskers, and well-shaved throat, And English neck-tie, and laced-up boot, He still was Italian from head to foot. By slowly dressing, an hour he killed, And then the serious duty fulfilled Of showing himself all up and down The Corso's length to the lazy town, Bowing and lifting his glossy hat, Or pausing to air his innocent chat At the carriage of Lady this or that; And to be English out and out, He bought a dog-cart, and drove about, Sitting high, with majestic pride, A tiger behind, and a friend at his side, And a boule-dogue staring between his knees, As like an Englishman as two peas. He thought so at least, if we did not; So, up and down, at a solemn trot, With his reins held tight, as if his steed Were wild with spirit, blood, and breed (Though, if the simple truth be told, It was eighteen years since he was foaled), He drove, white-gloved, his reverend beast, And looked like an English Sir Smith at least. At night he went to his opera-stall, When there was neither a party nor ball; And, knowing the opera all by rote, He hummed with the tenor, soprano, or bass, Keeping ahead by a bar or note, And winning by half a length the race; Or, turning around with an earnest face, He studied the circle from ceiling to floor, With a cheap lorgnette he had hired at the door; Or, wandering about from box to box, With his white cravat and his oily locks, He played with some lady's fan and smiled, And remarked that the weather was cold or mild; Asked when she would receive his callâ Hoped it would be a gay Carnival; Said Lady X. was a beautiful womanâ Heard she intended to give a ball; Knew that young American there, The pretty girl with a rose in her hair, The daughter, they say, of Barnum the showmanâ Would have a million dollars for dÃ´t; And half he sighed at his different lot. And with chat like this, that offended no man, Of people and parties and weather and wealth, And asking of everybody's health, He talked like any agreeable Roman. Giannone had but an empty headâ But then the worst of him is said: A better heart, or a readier hand, To help in whatever was plotted and planned, You never would see in our English land. He sang at our partiesâwas ready to hop In polka, mazurka, schottische, or galopp; Or led the cotillon till all of the girls Had danced in the morning, and danced out their curls, And the tired musicians were ready to drop. He bargained for carriages, horses, and groomsâ Hired music for balls, sent flowers to your roomsâ Arranged all the picnics, and fluttered about At every tea-drinking, party or routâ Talked terrible French, and at times even spoke In English, said âYas, meese,â and thought it a joke. A âguardia nobileâ was Giannone, By which he earned sufficient money For his gloves, shirt-buttons, boots, and hat, Though it was scarcely enough for that. And splendid he was on a gala-day, With his jingling sword and scarlet coat, And his long jack-boots and helmet gay, When along the streets he used to trot; And great good-luck it was to meet Giannone when you wanted a seat To hear the chant of the Miserere, Or to get on the balcony high and airy, To see the Papal procession go Over St. Peter's pavement below, Streaming along in its gorgeous show. And then at Carnival such bouquetsâ Such beautiful bon-bons, and princely waysâ Such elegant wavings of hat and handâ Such smiles that no one could withstandâ Such compliments, as made ours seem Like pale skim-milk to his rich cream. Giannone's dream was always this, To find some beautiful English âMiss,â With a pretty face and plenty of money, Who should fall in love and marry Giannone. Poor fellow! he met with a different fate, The manner of which I will now relate, And he caught it just through imitation Of some of the ways of our English nation. Travel as much as we English will, Down to the death we are English stillâ The brandy and ale that we have at home, And the sherry and port, we must have in Rome. These thin Italian wines, we think, Are a wishy-washy kind of drink. Travel we must, if only to say We are better in England every way; And we honestly think, when we get abroad, That England alone was made by God, While the rest of the earth, though nobly planned, Was finished by some apprentice's hand. All that 's not English in our eyes Is something to sneer at, and jeer, and despise. As for a foreigner, it 's our rule To consider him either a knave or fool; And our sense of a kindness by one bestowed Weighs on our minds like an awkward load, Till we 've asked our new acquaintance to dine, And paid off the favor with beef and wine, And introduced him to all our set. So it happened that Hycombe Wycombe Brown, Of the Sussex Wycombes, a man about town, The nephew, you know, of Sir Hycombe Guy, Who was slain at the storming of Alisalih, And left his name to the Gazette, And put our Hycombe quite at his ease With I know not how many lacs of rupees (And he lacked them enough till then, if you please). Well, owing Giannone a kind of debt For buying some horses, or some such work, He sent him a card of defiance one day To meet him at point of the knifeâand fork, And settle the matter without delay. Giannone accepted, of course, and then, As Wycombe's Italian was rather weak, He asked a few of us resident men Who knew the language, as seconds, to speak, And among them, slim and sleek and sly, Was your pious friend with his balking eye. The dinner was good, and all were merry, And plenty there was of champagne and sherry; And the toasts were brisk and the wine was good, And we all took quite as much as we should. Then we went to cards; and depend upon it, Though our seasoned brains the drink withstood, There was a bee in Giannone's bonnet; But to play we wentâit was only whist, But a little mill answers for little grist, And Giannone was soon cleaned out of all He had saved for bouquets at Carnival, And of course he felt a little vext, Though âPazienzaâ was still his text. But playing 's dry work, and, I'm sorry to say, Brandy was ordered to whet the play; And Giannone kept drinking, in imitation Of this happy custom of our nation, Till at last his tongue had lost its rein, And the fire had all gone into his brain. So he began to talk quite wild, And spoke all his thoughts out like a child; And secrets he ought to have kept in his breast Plumped out of his mouth like young birds from their nest; And names he called, and his voice was high As he talked of Italian liberty! And cursed the priests as the root of all evil, And sent the Cardinals all to the devil! And, ânow,â he cried, âthey have it their way, But every dog must have his day; And the time will come, and that before long, When the weak will rise and drive over the strong, And the Tricolor over the Vatican fly, And vivas be heard for liberty! No more King Stork, and no more Pope Log, Fouling Italy's boot in their bog. Better dig with the bayonet's point our graves, And die to be freemen, than live to be slaves! Ah, fight we will! There is nothing good Which must not be first baptized in blood. Let us alone, you tricking French, Let us alone, you Austrian sneaks, And we will purge the Augean stench That in Bomba's and Pius's stable reeks. We ask no help from Gascon or Guelph, Italia will do it aloneâby herself.â When the wine is in, at times the wit To a kindle of savage flame is lit; And Giannone, who in his common mood Thinks more of gloves and perfumes than blood, Now looked and talked like a man inspired, And his thoughts blazed up as if they were fired, And his lamping eyes (as calm as a cow's In his everyday) now seemed to rouse And burn beneath his low black brows. We looked at him in amazement then, And said, âThese Italians au fond are men, Veneered with ignorance though they be, And cowed and imbruted by slavery; Let them be roused by war or love, They are fiercer than any of us, by Jove!â But all the while that Giannone let fly These arrows of his, with a dead-cold eye Your friend sat playing, and now and then Gleamed up with a glance as sharp as a pen That seemed to write down every word, And then looked away as he had not heard; And whenever he opened his lips, he said Something about the game,ââYou 've played A heart to my club:âwe 're one to six; Yours are the honors and ours the tricks.â We all were Englishmen there, you know, And we English to suspect are slow; But this fellow's air and sneaking look Were something I somehow could not brook; So I watched him well, and at last said I To myself, âThe rascal must be a spy.â The thought like an arrow of fate struck homeâ You know how these sudden conclusions come, Beyond our reason, beyond our will, And, lightening down with electric thrill, Reveal in one clear and perfect flash A world that before was doubt and gloom. So âZitto! Zitto! don't be so rash, Giannone,â I cried; âwho knows what ear May be listening at the door to hear?â And then, with a laugh, and looking straight At this friend of yours, with his face sedate, I added, âWho knows but there may be A spy even here in this company?â If I doubted before the trade of your friend, My doubts in a moment had their end; For a glance came straight up into my eyes From under his lids, half fear, half surprise, As an adder on which you chance to tread Starts up, and darts his fangs from his head, And then slips swiftly into the shade. So turning back with a look demure, And a deprecating, pious air, As much as to say, âWe must not care, If our purposes are but high and pure, But quell our passions and our pride, And bear the stigma of human shame, Knowing the means are justified By the noble end,ââhe slowly said, Speaking, of course, about the game, âThe trick is mineâ't was the knave I played.â Now the snakes that in Italy's bosom lie Are the twins Suspicion and Jealousy; And the eggs from which they creep and crawl Are hatched in the secret confessional. Wherever you go you may hear them hiss 'Neath the covert of studied hypocrisies. Truth is dangerous,âeyes will spy, And ears will hear, though nobody 's nigh; And the safest thing is to learn to lie. So a daily distrust is engendered and bred, That saps one's faith in the friend most dear, And creeps to sleep in the marriage-bed, Till the dearest and nearest you learn to fear. The Government never forgets the rule That it early learns in the Church's school: Divide and conquerâthat is the way. Threaten the weak, the frank betray; Cajole and promiseâyou need n't pay. Save your children by playing your rods, And give up to CÃ¦sar the things that areâGod's. And oh! my children, listen and hearâ Whatever the Church commands, revere; And distrust men's words with a holy fear; And wherever you go, and whatever you see, Worship only the powers that be, And talk no nonsense of liberty. This is the creed that Giannone knew Better by far than I or you; So no sooner the dread word âSpyâ I spoke, Than his fine discourse like a pipe-stem broke; But looking around with a startled stare, And seeing we only were English there, His fear dropped off like a snake's old skin, And again with a laugh we heard him begin. âAh!â he cried, âthere 's a dirty trick In the very word that makes me sick; You English don't know as well as I The slobber and slime of a Government Spy. âSer Serpente, permit me now To introduce himâa friend of mineâ Smooth, pale, bloodless lips and browâ A long black coat, whose rubbed seams shineâ Spots on his waistcoat of grease and wineâ A tri-cornered hat all rusty with useâ Long black coarse stockings and buckled shoes; Ah! so polite with his bows and smiles, And his sickening compliments and wiles, And his little serpent venomous eyes, And his swollen chops of beastly size. Look at the hypocrite! There he stands, With the unctuous palms of his dirty hands Folded together breast-high, while he sneaks Cringing behind them wherever he speaks; He dares not look you straight in the eyes, But, sidling and simpering, askance alway, He oils you over with wheedling lies, As the boa slimes ere he swallows his prey. Any day you may see him, he haunts Half the cafÃ©s and restaurants; His eye on his paper fixed,âhis ear Gleaning the talk at the table near. No pride in him,âhe will lick your shoes, Thanks you for kicking himâloves abuseâ Calls it the natural spirit of youth; Anything 's sweet to him but truth. Drop a bad word in that fellow's way, He picks it up as a vulture its prey; Hating whatever is wholesome and good, And living only on carrion food. Let him say ârose,â it will stink in his breath. Many a fellow owes him his death Just for a strong word, spoken may be When the blood was hot and the tongue too free. But at last he reckoned without his host, And in throwing his dirty dice he lost; And one morning they found him taking his rest In the street, with a dagger stuck in his breast. And served him right, say you and I, It was only too easy a death for a Spy.â At this your friend threw down his card, Saying, âYou 've won to-night, 't is true, But to-morrow I'll have my revenge on you.â And though these words to his friend he spoke, He looked at Giannone so sharp and hard, With such a sinister evil look, That a dark suspicion in me awoke. So the good Giannone's arm I took, And crying, âI'm offâwill you go with me?â Took him away from the company; And after a mile of midnight Rome, Left him safe in his den at home. This, you'll say, and I'll confess, Was merely suspicionâno more nor less; Yet I could not get it out of my head Long after I was warm in my bed, That something might happen by-and-by To prove this fellow was only a Spy. Two days after I went to see Whether Giannone would walk with meâ Two sharp bell-pulls at his door; No answerâgone out; then one pull more, And âHo, Giannone, Giannone, 't is I!â Then slipped a slide back cautiously From a little grated holeââChi Ã¨â From a woman's voiceââChe vuole lei?â And a shuffle of slippers when it was known Who âIâ was, and that I was alone. âAnd where is the Signor Padrone?â I cried. âAh!â with a sort of convulsive groan, The poor old servant, sighing, replied, âDoes n't your Signoria knowâ Such timesâsuch timesâoime! oibo! The sbirri came here yesterday, And carried the caro padrone away; And they 've rifled his desk of letters and all, And taken the pistols and swords from the wall, And locked up the room with a great red seal Put over the door; and they scared me so, With threats if I dared in the chamber to go, That I'm all of a tremble from head to heel; And when the bell rang, I thought it must be Some of the sbirri come back for me. What it 's about we none of us know, But his mother and sisters are in such a fright, They 've been weeping and praying the livelong night. And oh, I fear, Signore dear, There 's some dreadful political business here; AhimÃ¨!â and she wiped away a tear. The servant's story was all too true; I did, of course, all there was to do, Begged, bribed, and petitioned, but all in vain. From that night I never saw him again. Worse, neither I nor his family knew, Nor will you unless your friend explain, And Giannone himself is as ignorant tooâ What was his crimeâwhat doneâwhat said, That drew this punishment down on his head. This one fact alone we know, That since the speech of that famous night Giannone has vanished out of sight, And has gone to pass a year or so, Longer perhaps,âhow can one say?â In a building where the Government pay His lodging and board in the kindest way. The lodging perhaps is rather bare, And the boarding is not the best of fare, And the company 's queer that 's gathered thereâ Made up of fellows with speech more free Than one hears in the best society; And some of whose notions are rather opaque Of the laws that govern property; So that sometimes they make a mistake In that little distinction 'twixt meum and tuum; But then, as the Roman laws are in Latin, Which, even in Rome, one is not pat in, Farther, I mean, than an Ave or Matin, It takes a scholar to read them at all; And supposing one has read thoroughly through 'em, There 's a slippery space 'twixt see 'em and do 'em, Where Grotius himself might trip and fall. Wellâhere in this cheerful company, Where the cushions are not of silk and satin, And on fare one cannot honestly praise, Our poor Giannone passes his days. It is not precisely the place to grow fat in, And the library 's wanting, as yet, I hear, And I'm told that the view from the window is drear, And the host will never allow a fire, And, besides, has ways that are rather queer Of locking the doors, which interfere With the perfect freedom one might desire. But beggars cannot be choosers, you see, And to look a gift-horse in the mouth would be Such a breach of mannersâyet, as for me, I cannot help wishing the end would come Of this public hospitality, And that poor Giannone was free to go home. But when will that be? you ask meâAh! That is the question; Chi lo sa? Whenever it pleases the powers that be,â Next monthânext yearânext century! Now, there are the facts for my suspicion About your friend and his pretty profession; They 're as plain to me as two ones in addition, And I put them all into your possession. AUNT RACHEL'S STORY. With booming hum the pertinacious bee Goes beating here and there, the butterfly Drifts idly on the wind, the feathery buds Are dangling from the willow's yellow twigs, Its limp, green fingers the horse-chestnut spreads, The daring tulip in the garden nods, And from the centre of its painted cup Thrusts its black tongue. The Spring returns again With musical breezes and the trill of birds, And furrows dark, fringed by the young grain's green, And thickening hedges where at height of noon The thin air simmers, and the wakened flies Begin to wheel and whisper in the warmth. 'T is May againâbut how unlike the May Of years agoâof that young May of life When aimless as a summer cloud, the heart, Freighted with light and touched with roseate hues, Sailed far above the sordid cares of earth In the pure heaven of feeling. Yes, 't is May, Not the old May; for May is changed indeed Since those old times, when love and hope looked out Of the heart's windowsâwhen we both were girls In our first freedom. Yet not all these years Have cloven our hearts asunderâin the loam Of early memories our friendship rootsâ Thought-interlaced like these two branching elms. Dear memories! lofty as the âSilverhorns,â Whose spotless heights into the blue sky pierce To play with morning,âyet not cold and bare As those steep splendors, but with tender grass And flowers o'ergrown, like to those lower slopes Where tinkle the faint cow-bells, and long notes Of the far shepherd's horn calling his herds Float o'er the air-abyssesâpastures fair Are they to us, serene although so sad, And brooded over by a thoughtful haze, Where herds of sweet thoughts wander far above Life's lower valley lying in the shade. Gone are the blossoms of our Young Romanceâ Alas! the very leaves are almost gone, Yet through the branches we can clearly see Heaven's light that once was hidden by their wealth. At moments only can we feel how far Our youth lies from usâas we drift along All things drift with usâ't is but now and then Some sudden contrast screams to us the truth. With some such thought as this, an hour ago I saw our dear old friend and hostess here, With her starched widow's cap, prim snowy ruff, And sombre dress, walk staidly down the path And pause beneath the elmsâthen reaching up, Pluck from the lilac hedge a fragrant bunch Wet with the morningârain its dew away With a quick shakeâand slowly pass along. I wondered with what thought she smelled that bunch Of lilac? for I smelled my youth in it. The flower, her movement, to my mind recalled, How suddenly, the time when we were girls. I saw her young, slight form, the happy face Laughing through golden hair, and youth's light step That spurns the ground it clings unto at last. Swift as a shuttle flies, the vision passed, But left behind in the dark weft of thought Its brilliant thread that on the sombre ground Conspicuous showed: the Past and Present clashed Like two sweet bells that are not in accord. I saw at once as in a magic glass This sad, subdued, and overwearied woman, And the young, gay, impetuous, laughing girl. You only knew her when her youth was past, But not the same was she in face or mind, As in those days when Love and Passion throbbed Across her eloquent cheeks, (like a swift hand Across a mystic harp,) and struck a fire In those wild eyes, that now are all so calm. What zest, what brilliancy, was in her witâ What relish of Life that would not be repressed In formal boundsâwhat mad delight in funâ What salient girlhood. Love that early came, But deepened to an ample river depth The wild young torrent: unto those two hearts, To hers and Marion's, Life flowed on so smoothâ They were so happy, fitting each to each In taste and temper like two clasping handsâ That there seemed nothing left to ask of Fate, It had not given. Oft and oft we said, Beholding them, âSuch fortune sometimes comes At happy moments and to happy souls, To give a footing to those climbing dreams The sneering world calls vaporous, foolish, false, And in the world of facts to keep alive A wise belief in visionary things.â Glad was their horoscopeâno evil star Foreboded danger when he said good-bye, And parted as he thought for three short months Across the ocean. Ah! how blind we were Who thought that Fate would always brim their hearts, As it had brimmed them. Tremble ye who have The Samian Ring; oh! ask not too much luck! For love's perfection breaks so easily! One drop of poison cracks a Venice glass. Three months he saidâthose three months slowly passed, And month on month went following in their track, And year on year for three long yearsâno word Breaking the dreadful silenceâno report Of life or death, when no report was death. As one who borne along the rattling rails Dashes from sunlit plains, pure air, blue sky, Down a chill tunnel's gloomy dripping cliffs, She shot from life to deathânor felt at first, After such glad excess of love and light, The dim faint lamp left burning in its stead; But yet as time went on her eye grew used To that more solemn atmosphere of grief, And patience served her in the place of love. Youth suffers sharply but not longâit bends Before the storm, as the young birch-tree bends And then springs back. Yet sorrow leaves behind A poison drop no art can purge away That taints our joyâthat kills our confidence. The glad, unthinking trust of youth, once crushed, Is crushed forever.âSo it was with her; Joy, which before she owned, seemed now but lent; She trembled while she held the commonest gift Of daily fortune, and within herself Shrunk up; a still, secluded life she lived, A life of memory, books, and household cares. Years wentâand love's sweet memories were hid, Like playthings that a mother fondly hoards Of her lost child, long wept in secret o'er, And sadly visited with grief that time Made tenderer ever, till it drew at last A scarce-felt veil of shadow o'er her thought. Her hope was smothered in her heart, not dead. How oft a sudden noise would make her start, And bring a quick flush in her cheek,âhow oft Of winter nights, when we beside the blaze Sat cheerful, would she leave the fireside group If the wind soughed too loudly in the trees, Or shook the windows with its gusts of rain. How oft she went, without apparent cause, And gazed at twilight down the avenue, Like one expecting somethingâand at times, How fixed to go, despite the cold and rain, Alone, to take the letters from the post. Oft at her father's fireside came a friend, Older by many years, refined in thought, Of generous heart and gentle in his mien. With quiet talk of nature and of art, He cheered her fancies, bore her oft away From the dull present to historic times. By Fancy led, she trod on other shores, Paced galleries thronged by pictured pageantry Or marble lifeâor leaned on balustrades Along the Alban hills or Tuscan slopes And breathed the faint, sweet odors floating up From orange groves, while thrilled the nightingale His liquid songâor silent slid along In her black gondola 'neath carven walls Of shadowy palaces, or in twilight blaze Beheld St. Marco's glittering crust of gold;â Through the wild gorges of the Alps he bore Her visionary footsteps, thrilled her heart With tales of terror on those glacial heights Where climbs the chamois, or the tourbillon Drives its white whirl of thunder down the steeps; Across the desert, up the slumberous Nile She journeyed where the fernlike palm-trees grow, Throwing their shadow on the blear white tombs, Or where black Egypt, with its palms outspread On its close knees, in marble sadness sits, Or further on into the land of dreams, Broke the pomegranate on Arabian ground, And trod the city of Scheherezade. The spoils of travel hung upon his walls Or crammed portfolios, over which they turned For hours, delightedâand her thoughts this way Acquired a happier bias: oft they walked Along this road, where tangled blackberries net The loose piled wall, or late in the afternoon Strolled slowly through the yellow-lighted fields. You know his house, built in the olden time, Its spacious roomsâits broad and spacious hall, Where the old clock ticked ever on the stairs, And that fair prospect from the windows seen; I see it yet. There lies the flat, green marsh On which the o'er-brimming river at neap tides Spreads its broad silver, and where lightning-flies Flash all night long. There slope the hills beyond, Besprinkled with white houses and dark groves, Along whose base the white snake of the train Steals vanishingâand nearer at my feet, Upon the lawn's short grass at anchor lie Great shadows, tethered to the spreading foot Of lofty elms that swing their pendant boughs. Above the spring-fed pond tall dark-haired pines, Lone lingering sachems of their forest tribe, Grouped as in council, whisper to the breeze Their mournful memories. There in early frost Amid their darkness gleamed with yellow fire Some slim white birches:âthere the sumac glowed And showed its velvet cones, while o'er broad fields The ripe oats rippled, and tall masts of maize Waved their green flags and spilled their yellow silk. Such was the scene through which they wandered oft And talked of men and booksâhis heart the while Absorbing loveâas flowers take from the light Their color, slowly, without suddenness. And one late afternoon returning home, That love found utteranceâunto her alone His words came with surprise, and fired a train Of smouldering thoughts, blind hopes, dear memories Half pain, half joy, a dim confused heap, Pushed out of sight, yet wanting but a touch To blaze through every ward of heart and brain. 'T was the old storyâlove, at first refused, Renewed its claim, and friendship, second best, With admirable reasoning pressed its suit; Worldly advantage, wealth, position, urged Their present claims above a hopeless love, And after tossing to and fro in doubt, Reluctant still, yet able to oppose Only a feeling deemed fantastical, A hope (that floated ever like a buoy Above the wreck of all her life and love) That Marion might be living, might return To make her his, she yielded her consent. I was her bridesmaidâtremblingly and pale She stood before the altar, when she pledged Her heart to his; but when the rites were o'er She grew composedâa flush of color came Into her delicate cheek, and, with a smile, She bade us all good-byâas if she said, The Past is Past, welcome the Future now. Sitting beside her when a month had passed, In pleasant talk of friends, which, deepening on, Touched on her early grief, and the lost hopes That lit her morningâall at once our ears Were startled by quick steps upon the walk; She trembledâI confess I trembled too, Touched by a strange forebodingâneither spakeâ But a quick flush ran over her pale face, Then vanishedâlike those summer-lightning heats That lift along the horizon's evening edge, And glow an instant but to leave more weird The after darkness. In a moment more The door swung open, and the well-known form Of Marion stood before us:âwith a shriek She started, staggered forward, while a look That haunts me still of wild and deep despair Convulsed her face,âand flinging up her arms, Muttered, âI knew it!âAh! too late,â and swooned. We bathed her temples, bore her to a couch, And long we hung above her, ere the life Came back to her white cheeks. Alas! that hour Of agony, which followed when her sense Again returnedâwhat explanations wildâ What bursts of tears, that smothered the thick voice,â With silences more dreadful, like those deep And dread crevasses leading down to death Smoothed over by the treacherous snow. What fierce Self-accusations and complaints of Fate These two hearts uttered! But at last a calm Came over them, a calm like that which comes After the foundering of a glorious hope, When all alone in the great sea of Time We find ourselves upon a drifting raft. You know his story; tempest, war, and chance Conspired to mar his plans;âa shipwreck first, Then cruel waiting for another ship, And long imprisonment on hostile shores,â These kept him back and ruined all his life. Death had been almost better than return, Her mind was braced to thatâbut every hour To own the terrible presence of a thought, Half of remorse and half of vain regret, That would intrude, a ghost at every feast, This was more hard to bear for him and her. So, when he died, a weight from off her heart Seemed lifted, and she grew more still and calm. And now, long yearsâlong, serious, thoughtful years Have strewn with their dead leaves her life and ours, And life has lost those early passionate joys, That sang and fluttered in Spring's blossomy boughs Like these gold orioles that among the elms Quiver like living fruit.âWell, age has brought Perhaps its compensation. Youth's gay days Hung round the walls of memory have gained The tone of rare old pictures and a fine Ideal hue, that time alone can give. But the gate creaksâour friend is coming back. Say, would you think, to see that serious face, With its quaint smilesâto hear that sharp, high tone Half-jesting, half sarcastic, she had known Such strange romance as this when she was young? THE THREE SINGERS. âWhere is a singer to cheer me? My heart is weary with sadness, I long for a verse of gladness!â Thus cried the Shah to his Vizier. He sat on his couch of crimson, And silent he smoked, and waited, Till a youth, with face elated, Entered, and bent before him. He swung the harp from his shoulder, And ran o'er its strings, preluding, O'er his thought for a moment brooding, Then his song went up into sunshine. It leaped, like the fountain, breaking At the top of its aspiration; It fell from its culmination, In tears, to life's troubled level. He sang of the boundless future, That had the gates of the morning, His fancies the song adorning, Like pearls on a white-necked maiden. âMy hope, like a hungered lion,â He sang, âfor its prey is panting; Oh! what is so glad, so enchanting, As Manhood, and Fame, and Freedom. âTo youth there is nothing given, The fruit on the high palm groweth, And thither life's caravan goeth, For rest and delight in its shadow.â He ceased,âand the Shah, half smiling, Beckoned, and said, âStay near me, Your song hath a charm to cheer me; Ask! what you ask shall be given. âNow bring me that other singer, That ere I was born enchanted The world with a song undaunted!â They went,âand an old man entered. His forehead, beneath his turban, Was wrinkled,âhe entered slowly,â Bendingâand bending more lowly, Waited,âthe Shah commandedâ âSing me a song;â his fingers Over the light strings trembled, And the sound of the strings resembled The wind, in the cypresses grieving. He sang of the time departed, In his song, as in some calm river, Where temples and palm-trees quiver, But pass notâhis youth was imaged. âOur shadow, that lay behind us, Ere the noonday sun passed o'er us, Now darkens the path before us, As we walk away from our morning. âOh! where are the friends that beside us Walked in the garden of roses? The dear head no longer reposes On the bosom, to feel the heart's beating. âOh, Life! 't is a verse so crooked, On Fate's sharp scimitar written, And Joyâa pomegranate bitten By a worm that preys at its centre.â He ceased, and the harp's vibration Throbbed only,âa slow tear twinkled On the rim of those eyes, so wrinkled, And the fountain renewed its plashing. The Shah was silentâa dimness Clouded his eyesâfrom his finger He drew a great rubyâthe singer Bowed low at this token of honor. At last, from his musing arousing, He spoke, âIs there none you can bring me The praise of the present to sing me? Seek himâand bring him before me.â He waitedâthe morningâthe noonday Passedâat last, when the shadows Lengthened on gardens and meadows, A poor, maimed cripple they brought him. âWhat! you sing the praise of the Present; You, by Fortune and Fate so forsaken, What charms can the Present awaken?â âI love, and am loved,â was the answer. THE BATTLE OF MORAT. Our men fought well at Morat! They fought like lions, boy, Like lions, that within their lair the hunter dares annoy. Ah! now I'm old, but I was then a boy as you are now, And this old tree was nothing but a bit of broken bough. 'T is sixty good long years agoâhow fast the years go by, Since we crushed, that deadly day of June, the hosts of Burgundy; The morning threatened thick with cloud, a weird and solemn gloom Hung o'er the townâthe empty streets were silent as a tomb, Save here and there where little groups with sad and anxious brow, Old men, and boys, and women, were gathered talking low, Recounting news of Burgundy in words of doubt and fear, Or tales of our own mountain strength their trembling hearts to cheer. Some wrung their hands the while they spokeâin many a maiden's eye The slow tears brimmed, the pale mouth twitched in secret agony, And old men sadly shook their heads, while at their mother's side Children were pulling at their gowns, and asking why they cried. Sad o'er us hung the sullen sky,âour hearts were dark with gloom, When suddenly the cannon's peal, with heavy muffled boom, Rolled dully smiting on the heart, that for a moment stilled, Stopped in the breast, then wildly like a hurried drum-beat thrilled. 'T was then, ere rang their battle-cry, our brothers in the field Bared their stern brows, and on the earth to ask God's blessing kneeled; And Hans Von Hallwyll lifted, while all were silent there, 'Mid the thunder voice of cannon, the still, small voice of prayer. The heavens hung gray and gloomy above them lowly bowed, But as they prayed the sudden sun broke through the shattered cloud And flashed across their bended ranks, and Hallwyll from his knee Sprang shoutingâUp! behold, God lights the way to victory! Ah, why was I not with them? why was I doomed to stay, An idle boy to range along the ramparts all that day? The cannon thrilled my startled bloodâthe Landshorn shrilly cried, Flee from old men and women! strike for freedom at our side! Alas, I could not flee from them! half mad in heart and brain, I watched with them the smoke-cloud cling along the distant plain; We strained our eyes in vain,âwe seemed to hear with nervous ears, The battle cry of Burgundyâthe Eidgenossen's cheers. We fought with them in spirit in the tumult of the fight, We swung our swords with Hallwyll for Liberty and Right, With Waldman's band of rugged Swiss adown the hill we clove Through the shining helms of Burgundy, as through some tall pine grove Our avalanches thunderâWe crushed them to the earth, We swept them from the hill-side with a wild exultant mirthâ We slid upon their horsemen, and hurled them to the lake In terror and confusionâas the landslides when they break Adown our mountain gorges,âin a heap of steel and blood, And shattered cuirasses and helms, they rolled into the flood; Their hands that gleamed with diamonds in vain they lifted high, As the red wave bubbled over them, and drowned their fearful cry. We rushed with old Von Hertenstein, his white hair streaming free, Where Hallwyll battled with the pride of knightly Burgundy; With the mountain force of stout Lucerne we sheared them from the plain, And mowed their glittering sheaves of spears like fields of autumn grain! What served their Orders then to them, their proud and knightly blood? It stained the grass and lay in pools amid the trampled mud; Their jewelled chains we scatteredâand on gleaming breast and brain, Our great swords rattling in their ears played Liberty's refrain. Leap! baffled Duke of Burgundy,âleap on thy swiftest steed! The Bear of Berne is after theeâspur at thine utmost need! Plunge in that reeking, quivering flank, thy golden spur, and flee Till his nostrils gush with blood and steamâLucerne is hunting thee. Leave, leave upon the hill-side your twenty thousand slain, Leave in the lake your heaps of dead, its waves with gore to stain. Speed! speed! and when night darkens downâblown, beaten, blasted, stand, With only thirty ghastly horsemen left of all your band. Such hope as this was thrilling us the while we leaned and gazed, With clenching hands, and young fierce eyes, and cheeks that hotly blazed; But oft the fear of dread defeat, and conquest pouring down Above our murdered, shattered ranks to deluge all the town With rapine and with ravage, knocked against our hearts with dread; We heard the crackling rafters crash above our fated head, We saw the red flames lick the air and glare against the sky, And 'mid the screams of women rang the clash of soldiery. At last the distant thunder ceasedâand as we strained our eyes We saw above the road's far ridge a little dust-cloud rise; And on it came, and on, and on, upon the dry white road, Until a dark and moving spot like a running figure showed. News from the field! what news, what news?âalas, our brothers fly! No, no, he waves a branch of limeâthat tells of Victory. He staggers, wounded, on, he reels, he faints beside the gate; Speak! speak!âhe cannot speakâand yet 't is agony to wait. We gather round, as through the street with reeling, staggering pace, He falls alongâand panting, points towards the market place. There, while the blood starts from his mouth, he waves the branch on high, And with a last faint shout expires, exclaiming, Victory! That branch of lime we planted in the spot whereon he fell, And there it took its root, and throve, and spread its branches well, And you shall sit beneath its shade, as now we sit, when I Am dustâand say, âMy Grandsire brought that branch of Victory.â THE CONFESSIONAL. Forgive me, Father! Those were wild, bad words, From the foul bottom of my heart stirred up By agitation.âTurn not thus away, I will repentâI think I do repent,â Yet who can answer, when temptation comes, For calm resolves? When windy passion swells The turbulent thoughts, our weakly-builded dykes Burst, and the overbearing sea, let through, In one wild rush pours in, and swirls away Our boasted resolutions, like light chips. Yet, holy Father! give me now your hand, And I will try to think of youth and home, And violets in spring, and all sweet things I used to love, when I was innocent, For they may calm meâYet, no! no! 't is vain! The great black wall of yesterday shuts out All other yesterdays that went before; I cannot overpeer its horror and look down Into the peaceful garden-plot beyond. I was not all to blame. You, who have heard So many tales of passion, lean your ear, And I will tell you mineâbut make the sign, The blessed sign of the cross, ere I begin. 'T was twilightâand the early lighted lamps Were flickering down into the Arno's tide While yet the daylight lingered in the skies, Silvering and palingâwhen I saw him first. I was returning from my work, and paused Upon the Bridge of Santa Trinit?, To rest, and think how fair our Florence is, How sweet the air smelt after that close room, And how privation, like a darkened tube, Made joy the sweeter, through its darkness seen. And I remember, o'er the hazy hills Far, far away, how exquisitely fair The twilight seemed that nightâmy heart was soft With tender longings, misted with a dim Sad pleasureâas a mirror with the breathâ (Ah! never will those feelings come again.) I wondered if the thronging crowd that passed Felt half the wondrous beauty of the hour; And I was in a mood to take a stamp From any passing chance,âeven like those clouds That caught the tenderest thrill of dying light,â When by some inward sense, I know not what, I felt that I was gazed at, drawn away By eyes that had a strange magnetic will, And so I turned from those far hills to see A stranger;âno! even then he did not seem A strangerâbut as one I once had known, Not here in Florence, not in any place, But somehow in my spirit known and seen, Elsewhere, I know not where, perhaps in dreams; I felt his eyes were staying upon me, And a sweet, serious smile was on his mouth, Nor could I help but look and smile again. I know not what it was went to and fro Between us then, in that swift smile and glance; But something went that thrilled me through and through, And fluttered all my thoughts, as when a bird Shivers with both his wings some peaceful pool: We neither spokeâbut that quick clash of souls Had struck a spark that set me all a-fire. With what a turbulent heart I traversed then The Bridge, and plunged into the narrow streets, Heavy with shadows, till I gained my room; Yet there I could not restâI leaned from out My balcony above the street and gazed At every passer-by, the evening long, Till midnight struck, and all the humming crowd Poured home from theatre and opera,â In hopes to see him. Silent grew the streets, Save here and there, where rang the echoing feet Of some late walker singing as he went. The few lamps on the lonely pavement glared, The still stars stood in the dark river of night, That flowed between the house-tops far above, And all was rest.âAt last I lit my lamp, And with a prayer, (I never prayed till then, It seemed to meâso fervently I prayed,) Crept to my bed. Half dreaming, I rehearsed The evening sceneâand saw again his smileâ And wondered who he wasâand if again We ere should meetâand what would come of itâ Until at last I wore away to sleep, Almost when morning was upon the hills. And days went byâand that one thought of him Ran through thought's labyrinth, like a silver clue. Waking, I did not see my work; I sewed Love's broidery in with every stitch I made; And I grew silent, sad, and spiritless, And ceased to talk and jest as I was wont, Until Beata laughed at me, and said, Pointing me out to all the other girls, âSanta Maria! Nina is in love!â And all of them looked up at me and laughed; I could have struck herâbut I had to laugh. At last the Festa of the Madonna came, And in the costume of my native town, (I am an Albanese, as you know,) I, and Beata, and the other girls, Went to the Duomo, as we always do, To see the grand procession and hear mass; And there, I kneeling prayed for him and me. I heard the laboring organ in the dome Struggle and groan, and, stopping short, give place Unto the Bishop's harsh and croaking chant; I heard, at intervals, the crowd's response Rising around me with a muffled roar, The steaming censer clicking as it swung, The sharp, quick tinkle of the bell; at last The whole crowd rustling sank upon its knees, And silence reignedâthe host was raisedâa strain Of trumpets soundedâand the mass was o'er; My heart was fullâI lingered when they went, Beata, Maddalena, Bice, all, And leaned against a pillar in the choir, Where Michael Angelo's half-finished group Stands in the shadowâI, in shadow tooâ How long I stood I know not, but a voice That made my blood stop whispered me at last. I knew that it was he. What could I do? He knew I loved himâand I knew he loved. He said to me ... Ah! no, I cannot say What words he said,âto me they were not words; But ere we parted it was late at night, And I was happy,âoh, so happy then,â It seemed as if this earth could never add One little drop more to the joy I owned, For all that passionate torrent pent within My heart had found its utterance and response. He was Venetian, and that radiant hair We black-haired girls so covet haloed round His sunny northern face and soft blue eyes. I know not why he loved meâme so black, With this black skin, that every Roman has, And these black eyes, black hair, that I so hate. Why loved he not Beata?âshe is fair.â But yet he often took these cheeks of mine Between his hands, and, looking in my eyes, Swore that Beata's body was not worth One half my fingerâand then kissed me full Upon the mouth as if to seal his oath. Ah! glorious sealâI feel those lips there now! And on my forehead, too, one kiss still glows Like a great starâlook hereâit was the day He hung this little cross upon my neck, And pressed his lips, here, just above the eyes. Ah, well! those days are gone. No! No! No! No! They are not gone;âI love him madly now, I love him madly as I loved him then; And I again would ... No! I will be calmâ Just place your hand upon my forehead here, It soothes meâI will try to be more calm. I gave him allâheart, soul and bodyâallâ Even the great hope of another world I would have given for one wish of his; With him this life was all I asked to haveâ 'T was Paradiseâwhat more or better then Was there to hope for?âwithout him the best Was only hellâis only hell to me. Ah, God! how blissfully those days went by; You could not heap a golden cup more full Of rubied wine than was my heart with joy. Long mornings in his studio there I sat And heard his voiceâor, when he did not speak I felt his presence, like a rich perfume, Fill all my thoughts. At times he 'd rise and come And sit beside me, take my hands in his, And call me best and dearestâheaping names Of love upon meâtill beneath their weight I bent, and clung unto his neck, and wept; Oh! what glad tears, he kissed them all away. I was his modelâhours and hours I posed For him to paint his Cleopatraâfierce, With her squared brows, and full Egyptian lips, A great gold serpent on her rounded arm, ('T was mine, look now how lean and bony 't is,) And a broad band of gold around her head; And oft he 'd say, âI am your Antony, Ready to fling the world away for you; But you, if I should fall upon my sword, You 'd live for CÃ¦sar's triumphâwould you not?â And I, a little vexed, although I knew He did not mean his words, would laugh and say, âFor all your boast, you men are all the same, You would not risk a kingdom for your love, You 'd marry weak Octaviaâall of you.â Had I not reason? Yet those foolish words, They burn here in my memory, like red drops Of molten brassâthose little foolish jests Were eggs of serpents that now hiss and sting; I curse my tongue that spoke themâfor he loves, I know he loves meâloves me now as then. What a long trail of flushed and orient light Those summer days were! but the autumn came, The stricken, bleeding autumn came at last. I saw him grow more serious, day by day, More fitful, sudden, gustyâsomething weighed Upon his mind I could not understandâ I sought to win his secretâbut in vain. â'T is nothing, love,â he 'd sayâthen rising quick, With sudden push would dash away his hair From his grand foreheadâto the window go, And with his back turned to me, stand and stare For full five minutes in the garden there. I knew all was not right, yet dared not ask. I waited as we women have to wait. At last 't was clear,âtwo words made all things clearâ âLove, I must go to Venice.â âMust?â âYes, must!â âThen I go too.â âNo! no! ah! Nina, noâ Four weeks pass swiftlyâone short month, and then I shall return to Florence, and to you.â Vain were my words, he wentâalas, he went With all the sunshineâand I wore alone The weary weeks out of that hateful month. Another month I waited, nervous, fierce With love's impatienceâthinking every day I heard his voice and step upon the stair, And listening to the carriages all night, And straining each back as it passed the house,â With fits of weeping when it rolled away In the lone midnight.âWhen that month was gone My heart was all a-fireâI could not stay, Consumed with jealous fears that wore me down Into a feverâNecklace, earrings, all, I soldâand on to Venice rushed. How long That dreary never-ending journey seemed! I cursed the hills, up which we slowly dragged, The long flat plains of Lombardy I cursed, With files of poplars stretching out and out, That kept me back from Veniceâbut at last In a black gondola I swam along The sea-built city, and my heart was big With the glad thought that I was near to him. Yes! gladness came upon me that soft night, And jealousy was hushed, and hope led on My dancing heart. One little half-hour more And I should be again within his arms; And how he 'd be surprised to see me here, And laugh at me. In vain I strove to curb My glad impatience,âI must see him then, At once, that very nightâI could not wait The tardy morningâ't was a year away.â I only gave the gondolier his name, And said, âYou know him?â âYes.â âThen row me quick To where he is.â He bowed, and on we went Threading along the grand canal so swift The oar sprang to the pressure of his arm; And as we swept along, I leaned me out And dragged my burning fingers in the wave, My hurried heart forecasting to itself Our meetingâwhat he 'd say, and do, and think, How I should hang upon his neck, and say, âI could not longer live without you, dear.ââ In thought like this, I had no heart to list The idle babbling of a gondolier; I bade him not to talk, but rowârowârow! At last he paused, stretched out his hand, and said, âThere is the palace.â I was struck aghastâ It flared with lights that from the windows streamed And trickled down into the black canalâ Faint bursts of music swelled from out the doorsâ A swarm of gondolas close huddling thronged Around the oozy steps. âStop! stop!â I cried, For a wild doubt rushed swiftly through my mind, That scared meâlike a strange noise in a wood A traveller hears at night,ââ'T is some mistake; Why are these lights? This palace is not his, He owns no palace.â âPardon,â answered he, âI fancied the Signora wished to see The marriage festaâand all Venice knows The bride receives to-night.â âWhat bride, whose bride?â I snapped, impatient. âCount Alberti's bride, Whose else?â he answered with a shrug. My heart From its glad singing height dropped like a lark Shot dead, at those few words. The whole world reeled, And for a moment I was stunned and crushed; Then came the wild revulsion of despair; Then calm more dreadful than the fiercest pain. âRow to the steps,â I said. He rowed. I leaped On their wet edge, and stared in at the door, Where all was hurry, hum, and buzz, and light. I was so calmâI never was so calm As then, despairing. Yet one little jet Of hope was stirring in that stagnant marshâ That little jet was all that troubled meâ My eyes ran lightning zigzag through the crowd In search of himâhe was not thereâah, God! I breathed,âhe was not thereâI inly cursed My unbelief, and turned me round to goâ There was a sudden murmur near the door, And I beheld him walking at her side. Oh! cursed be the hour I saw that sight, And cursed be the place!âI saw those eyes, That used to look such passion into mine, Turned with the self-same look to other eyes That upward gazed at hisâyes, light blue eyes, Just like Beata'sâhers were light blue eyes!â I saw her smilingâsaw him smiling too, As they advancedâI could not bear her bliss; My heart stood still, and all the hurrying crowd Seemed spectral, nothing lived but those two forms; The Past all broke to pieces with a crash That stunned me, shattering every power of thought: I scarcely know what happened thenâI know I felt for the stiletto in my vest, With purpose that was half mechanical, As if a demon used my hand for his, I heard the red blood singing in my brain, I struckâbefore me at my feet she fell. Who was the queen then? Ah! your rank and wealth, Your pearls and splendors, what did they avail Against the sharp stiletto's little point? You should have thought of that before you daredâ You, who had all the world besideâto steal The only treasure that the Roman girl, The poor despised black Roman, ever had; You will not smile again, as then you smiled,â Thank God! you'll never smile again for him. And I alone of all the crowd stood calm; I was avengedâavenged until I saw The dreadful look he gave me as he turned From her dead face and looked in mineâAh, God! It haunts me, scares me, will not let me sleep. When will he come, and tell me he forgives And loves me still? Oh, Father! bid him come, Come quicklyâcome and let me die in peace. Tell him I could not help it, I was mad, But I repent, I suffer,âhe at least Should pity and forgive. Oh! make him come And say he loves me, and then let me die. I shall be ready then to dieâbut now I cannot think of God; my heart is hell, Is hell, until I know he loves me still. January, 1855. A LEGEND. High noon in Acre blazed, and all the throng Had sought the shade, when striding stern along The burning street, and through the open square, With feet unsandalled and dishevelled hair, Was seen a figure strange, mysterious, tall, With face uncovered, yet unknown to all. Round her she gazed with wild impassioned look, And in one hand a flaming torch she shook High o'er her head, and in the other bore A jar with water brimmed and running o'er,â And with a high, clear voice she cried, âBehold! I will burn heaven up with this torch I hold, And with this jar of water I, as well, Will quench forever all the fires of hell, So that when heaven and hell alike are gone, Man may love God, for God's own sake alone.â REVERIES. AT THE VILLA CONTI. What peace and quiet in this villa sleep! Here let us pause, nor chase for pleasure on, Nothing can be more exquisite than thisâ Work, for the nonce farewellâthis day we'll give To fallow joys of perfect idleness. See how the old house lifts its face of light Against the pallid olives that behind Throng up the hill.âLook down this vista's shade Of dark square shaven ilexes, where spirts The fountain's thin white thread, and blows away. And mark! along the terraced balustrade Two contadine stopping in the shade, With copper vases poised upon their heads, How their red jackets tell against the green! Old, all is oldâwhat charm there is in age! Do you believe this villa when 't was new Was half so beautiful as now it seems? Look at these balustrades of travertine, Had they the charm when fresh and sharply carved As now that they are stained and grayed with time And mossed with lichens, every grim old mask That grins upon their pillars bearded o'er With waving sprays of slender maiden-hair? Ah no! I cannot think it.âThings of art Snatch nature's graces from the hand of Time. Here will we sit and let the sleeping noon Doze on and dream into the afternoon, While all the mountains shake in opal light, Forever shifting, till the sun's last glance Transfigures with its splendor all our world. Hark! the cicala crackles mid the trees, How shrilly! and the toppling fountain spills The music of its silvery rain, how soft! Into the broad clear basinâzigzag darts The sudden dragon-fly across, or hangs Poised in the sun with shimmer of glazed wings. And there the exquisite campagna lies Dreaming what dreams of olden pomp and war, Of Love, and Pain, and Joy that it has known! Sadder, perhaps, but dearer than of yore, With wild-flowers overstrewn, like some loved grave; Its silent stretches haunted by vast trains Of ghostly shapes, where stalks majestical, Mid visionary pomp of vanished days, The buried grandeur of imperial Rome; Moaned over by great winds that from the sea Sweep inland, and by wandering clouds of tears; How it lies throbbing there beneath the sun, So silent with its ruins on its breast! There, far Soracte on the horizon piles Its lonely peakâand gazes on the sea; There Leonessa couches in repose, And stern Gennaro rears its purple ridge, And wears its ermine late into the spring. When all beneath is one vast lush of flowers, And poppies paint whole acres with one sweep Of their rich scarlet, and entangling vines Shroud the low walls, and drop from arch to arch Of the far-running lessening aqueducts, On his broad shoulders still the imperial robe Of winter hangsâand leashed within his caves The violent Tramontana lies in wait. Dear, dear old Romeâwell! nothing is like Rome; Others may please me, her alone I love. She is no place as other cities areâ But like a mother and a mistress too, The soul of places, unto whom I give How gladly all my heart, and wish it more, That I might give more. After life with her, With her sweet counsel, tender grace, large thought, And great calm beauty, all seems trivial. Ask me not why I love, nor count her faults; Who ever gave a reason for his love? Let not this day go by unconsciously; No! let us taste itâtaste it as it goes, Not gulp it at one draught like common wine, But taste each drop, and say, âhow exquisite!â Stay, stay with us, oh! dear and lovely day, Would we could hold you back forever here. What long sweet respiration of delight In these old places, and in this old world; How dear this villa, with its crumbling pride, Its time-wryed balustrades, its shadowy walks Through the thick ilexesâits fountain stairs Down which the sheeted water leaps alive To heap the basin where the gold-fish hang. Not half so dear to generations gone, To those who planned the gardens and enslaved The free stream of the mountain here to pour When loosened from its prison into light, Its mounting splendor and its cool sweet song As unto us, who after Time hath laid Its hand on all and given it a grace No newness ever ownedâhere lie and muse. Here walked the Falconieri in their pride Centuries agoâhere the Colonna came, Vittoria with themâAngelo himself, Gazing upon her as she gravely moved And sighing for her, while Fabrizio's sword Clanged on the gravelâhere the D'Este came, From Tivoli where o'er dark cypresses Their villa looks above the billowy land Of the Campagna;âah! how sweet their names Sound, rousing pensive echoes in the heart. Here woman in her first young budding grace To manhood's earliest prime of passion pledged The faith of innocent love, the while their hearts Ran over into sweet Italian wordsâ Soft dropping vowels. They are now but dust; But yet their imaged life re-lives in us A charmed existence. Down such paths as these Stole Romeo to his Juliet, when the moon Looked at her quivering image in the cup Of such broad fountain;âby such balustrade Fair Beatrice, her wit scarce sheathed in Love, Ran like a lapwing close unto the ground;â Under the shadow of such deep green woods Francesca read upon the fated day That lives in Dante's rhyme;âPetrarca walked Alone and thoughtful through such silent paths Embalming Laura in his amber songâ Here Tasso roamed, and o'er such terraces That happy group of dark-eyed women sat, For whom Boccaccio told his charming tales. Oh! sweet romantic memories, ye exhale Your odorous breath amid these sylvan shades To intoxicate the senses. Gentle forms Ye rise like visions here among the trees, In fair procession. In the fountain's dim And whispering murmur are your voices hid. Ye speak of Loveâye summon up again Blind, sweet sensations, feelings dreamy, faint As the prophetic light round the young moon; Wild hopes that overflow Life's parapets Rise at your voice, tempered and sobered down, And with a haze of sadnessâsadness full Of tenderest joy and not to be exchanged For all those wilder rapturesârise again With trains of memories, forms that are no more, And smiles of light that pierce Thought's shadowy wood. Ah! were ye here with whom in Childhood's days, Or in the season of expanding thought I roamed and dreamed and shaped a thousand vague Delicious fanciesâwere ye at my side! Yet no! in vision only could we touch That Future which is Present now to meâ Present in Time, but ah! how sadly changed From what we painted. Not the ocean drear, With its blind waste of washing, weltering waves Yawns now between us,âfiner line than thought Can ever trace, yet not to be o'er-reached, And vaster than the widest stretch of sea, Is drawn between your life beyond and ours. Are these dreams nothing? are these idle hours Loss to the soul? Believe it not, dear friend! These fallow times enrich our choicest powers And sweeten strength which else would grow too hard. We will not take the joy we do not earn, So vain are weâand yet these idle joys That Nature offers we can never winâ Out of her grace she gives, but not for pay. The charm of Beauty slips away from Work. So let us live to-day, not as the bee Bustling and busy at our nervous toilâ (Of all God's creatures most I hate the bee, Heartless and selfish, and intent on gain, Armed with a sting and banging rudely round With irritated noise among the flowers,) But float as lazy as the butterfly Whose idle wings beauty is glad to paint, The brother of the rose on which he lights. To-morrow for the pictures we shall paintâ To-morrow for the statue we shall carveâ To-day we'll dream beneath the open sky And take our color, as the flowers take theirs. Hark! from the ilexes the nightingale Begins its beating prelude, like the throbs Of some quick heart, then pauses, then again Bursts into fitful jets of gurgling song, Then beats again; and listen! rising now To its full rapture thrills the shadowy wood With the delirious passion of its voice; With dizzy trills, and low, deep, tearful notes, And hurried heaping of voluptuous tones That blent together in one intricate maze Of sweet inextricable melodies, Whirl on and up, and circling lift and lift, And burst at last in scattered showers of notes, And leave us the sweet, silent afternoon. Rome, July 5, 1852. UNDER THE ILEXES. DEDICATED TO A. I. T. Dark ilexes above, dry sward below, O'er which the flickering sunglobes come and go; Beyond, the swooping valley roughed by lines Ruled by the plough between the rows of vines; O'er yellow sunburnt slopes the olives gray Casting their rounded shadows; far away A stately parliament of poised stone-pines; Dark cypresses with golden balls bestrewn, Each rocking to the breeze its solemn cone; Dim mountains, veiled in dreamy mystery, Sleeping upon the pale and tender sky; And near, with softened shades of purple brown, By distance hushed, the peaceful mellowed town, Domes, roofs, and towers all sleeping tranced and stillâ A painted city on a painted hill. Here let me lie and my siesta take, And gaze about me, dreaming, half awake. What peace is here! what rapt tranquillity!â The far-off voices seem to lull the sense; The cock's clear crow sounds faint and drowsily; The sharp fly buzzing round the leafy fence; The burning wasp, the bees that droning hum Along the shining spires of withered grass; The far cathedral bell's half-buried boom; The leaves that whisper as the breezes come, And talk a moment with them as they pass, Break not the calm;âwith half-shut dreaming eyes I watch them, while my idle fancies stray, Even as these noiseless yellow butterflies, That poise on grass or flower, and drift away Like wavering leaves in their perpetual play. And all these sounds come vague to me and seem Drowned in the air, like voices in a dream. Look at this ilex-trunk's mosaic bark, With all its myriad cracks, and seams, and squares! See with what patient pains and happy cares 'T is painted o'er with lichens light and dark, Rich brown, pale gray, and softest malachite, And every hue that can the eye delight! This moss of golden green that round it clings Is a vast forest filled with noiseless things, That 'neath its jungle make their secret lairs. Here the black ant may hunt as in a park, Here hosts of beetles come in burnished mail, On secret errands bent from underground; Some with vermilion corselets on their back, Marked with black crosses, some with gold embrowned, Some bronzed with shadowy green, some ribbed and black, Splendid as mortal knight was never found. Here creeps the torpid locust from his cell, Deep at its roots, to shed his silvery shell, Breaks the thin crust, and spreads his gauzy wings, And in the shade his praise of summer sings. Here, in the centre of his woven wheel, That dimly glistening in the shadow shakes, Hangs the fat spider, ready and aware, Round the fierce fly that pertinacious there Darts to and fro, his silvery coil to reel. Here the slim dragon-fly her visit makes On glassy vans that gleam with opal hues, And waves her tail of green enamelled rings. Here the black grillo burrows all day long; And peeping forth when fall the twilight dews, Trills to the night its little simmering song. Here creep among the grass, at work, or game, Swarms of strange life that scarcely own a name; Here live, and love, and fight, and sleep, and die, Plagued by no dreams of immortality. World within world, the deeper that we gaze, Life widens, death recedes, the mass inert Moves into being; all this mould and dirt Is living in its own mysterious ways. Which shall we dare most wonderful to call, The infinite great, or not less infinite small? Puzzled I gaze upon this spiring grass That 'neath me lies, and ask,âcan aught surpass The wonder of this life minute that moves Beneath my hand, and struggles, suffers, loves? Are the vast worlds that darkness shows to night, Or day enshrouds in its abyss of light, More strange than this that hides from human eye In the minuteness of its mystery? No more! the shadows shrink; the prying sun Hath found me out. The morning 's goneâhow soon! The far cathedral bell is striking noon. This sketch, dear Annie, is for youâhalf done. AUTUMN IN TUSCANY. DEDICATED TO J. R. L. These Autumn winds are growing chill, They wander wailing o'er the hill, And at the close-shut window cry That summer opened lovingly; But we can let them in no more, And all the eve my heart is soreâ My heart is sore, I know not why. They seem to say, The summer day Has past away, And life goes with it silently. Still o'er the mountain's darkening bar We watch the new-born evening star, That throbs and quivers in the sea Of amber lightâand musingly We let our shaping fancy play With those soft clouds of pearly gray, That float along the silvery sky. Ah woe! ah woe! We all must go, The chill winds blow, And summer 's gone like a passing sigh. These Autumn morns when we may stray Through chestnut woods, where glancing play The checkered light and shadow thrown O'er trunk, and grass, and mossy stone, And lie beneath some spreading tree And feel our own felicity, How sweet if they would never flyâ But no! ah no! 'T is never so! All good things go, And thought pursues them with a sigh. All day the woods are redolent And saddened with the steamy scent The dewy rotting leaves exhale That heap the hollows in the vale; Then through the bonfire's quivering gas The landscape shakes as it would pass, And all is sad, we know not why;â All seems to say The summer day Is past away, Why linger ye to say Good-bye? No more the fierce cicala shrills, Only the hearthstone-cricket trills,â The hemp-stalks pile their bleaching bones In pyramids of skeletons, Or clacking cradles break them where The peasant shakes their silvery hair, And flings them on the grass to dry. The summer 's flown, The leaves are strewn, And we alone Are lingering here to say Good-bye. The cyclamen, alive with fears, Smooths trembling back its harelike ears; The frost-touched creepers bleeding fall, And drip in crimson o'er the wall; The rusted chestnuts shivering spill Their bursting spine-burrs on the hill; The day is short, soon comes the night, And damp and chill Along the hill The dews distil Under the harvest-moon's great light. Louder at eve the river roars; The fringed acacia paves with showers Of golden leaves our summer path, And all the world about us hath A feel of sorrowâwe must go; Alas! I would not have it so, But all things vanish from us here, And still we sigh, Ah why, ah why, So swiftly fly, Ye days that were so glad and dear? 'T is lovely still; but yet a sense Of sadness and impermanence Disturbs meâand this flushing grace That mantles over Autumn's face Is but the hectic hue, beneath Whose beauty steals the thought of death,â And this it is that makes us sigh. Ah! bitter word Too often heard, What thoughts are stirred Whene'er we whisper theeâGood-bye! Death walks along my shrouded thought; I feel him though I see him not: His step is on the joys that grew And waved this lovely summer through. I fear, for life is all too fair, And trembling ask, Ah! when? and where? And this it is that makes me sigh; Too sweet to last, Ah! golden past That fled so fast, No future owns such witchery. IN THE GLEN. Here in this cool, secluded glen Alone with Nature let me lie, Where no rude voice or peering eyes of men Disturbs its perfect peace and privacy; Where through the swaying firs the restless breeze Sighs softly and the murmuring torrent flows, Singing the same low song as on it goes, That it hath sung for countless centuries; Now welling through the mossy rocks, now spilled In little sparkling falls, now lingering, stilled In brown, deep pools to hold the mirrored skies, As brown, as clear as some fair maiden's eyes, And filled like them with silent mysteries. One side the shelving slopes, through which its song The torrent sings, the firs' tall columns throng, Spreading their dark green tops against the blue; And on the brown, fine carpet at their feet Long strips and flecks of sun strike glimmering through, Where gleaming specks of insects through them fleet. Along the other slope green beeches spread Their spotted canopy of light and shade, And on the brown, transparent stream below Their quivering, tessellated pavement throw. Here ferns and bracken spread their plumy spray; Here the wild rose gropes out against the gray Moss-cushioned rocks, and o'er the torrent swings; Here o'er the bank the sombre ivy strings, And the scorned thistle bears its royal crown; Here wild clematis stretches, wavering down; And, 'mid a mass of tangled weeds that know Scarcely a name, and all neglected grow, A tribe of gracious flowers peeps smiling up: The humble dandelion, buttercup, And spindled gorse here show their gleaming gold; The bright-eyed daisy, innocently bold, Stars the lush green; the purple malva lifts Its spreading cup. From tufted blackberries drifts A snow of blossoms, scenting with their breath The summer air; and, sacred to St. John, The magic flower that maidens cull at dawn; And blue forget-me-nots, scarce seen beneath The feathery grass; and the white hemlock's face; And all the wild, untrained, and happy race Of Nature's children, through whose blooms the bees, Busy for honey hovering, hum and tease. Softened, by distance, from the woods remote, Rings, now and then, the blackbird's liquid note; Or the jay scolds, or far up in the sky Trills out the lark's long, quivering melody; Or, its melodious passion pouring out, In the green shadow hid, the nightingale Stills all the world to listen to its tale, The same sweet tale that centuries past it sung To Grecian ears, when Poesy was young; Or the glad goldfinch tunes his tremulous throat, Or with a sudden chirp some linnet gray Darts up the gorge, to drink at these cool springs, And at a glimpse of me flits swift away. A faint, fine hum of myriad quivering wings Fills all the air; the idle butterfly Drifts down the glen; and through the grasses low Creep swarms of busy creatures to and fro, And have their loves, and joys, and strife and hate, Intent upon a life to us unknown. On the o'erhanging boulders glance and gleam Quick, quivering lights reflected from the stream, Where water-spiders poise and darting skate, Their shadows on its dappled sand-floor thrown. Across the boulders bare and pine-slopes brown, Like dials of the day that passes by, The firs' long shadow-index silently, So silently, is ever stealing on, We scarcely heed the unpausing race of time So swift and noiseless; and some subtle spell Seems to have lulled to sleep this shadowy dell, As if it lay in some enchanted clime, Haunted by dreams that never poet's rhyme Nor music's voice to waking ears can tell. All is so peaceful here that weary thought Half falls asleep, nor seeks to find the key Of the pervading, unsolved mystery Through which we move, by which our life is wrought. Here, magnetized by Nature, if the eye Upglancing should discern in the soft shade Some Dryad's form, or, where the waters braid Their silvery windings, haply should descry Some naked Naiad leaning on the rocks, Her feet dropped in its basin, while her locks She lifts from off her shoulders unafraid, And gazes round, or looks into the cool Tranced mirror of the softly-gleaming pool, To see her polished limbs and bosom bare And sweet, dim eyes and smile reflected there, 'T would scarce seem strange, but only as it were A natural presence, natural as yon rose That spreads its beauty careless to the air, And knows not whence it came nor why it grows, And just as simply, innocently there; The sweet presiding spirit of some tree, The soul indwelling in the murmuring brook, Whose voice we hear, whose form we cannot see, On whom, at last, 't is given us to look; As if dear Nature for a moment's space Lifted her veil and met us face to face. Such Grecian thought is false to our rude sense, That naught believes, or feels, or hears, or sees Of what the world in happier days of Greece Felt with a feeling gentle and intense. We are divorced from Nature; our dull ears Catch not the music of the finer spheres, See not the spirits that in Nature dwell In leafy groves through which they glancing look, In the dim music of the singing brook, And lurk half hidden and half audible. To us the world is dead. The soul of things, The life that haunts us with imaginings, That lives, breathes, throbs in all we hear and see, The charm, the secret hidden everywhere, Evades all reason, spurns philosophy, And scorns by boasting science to be tracked. Hunt as we will all matter to the end, Life flits before it; last, as first, we find Naught but dead structure and the dust of fact; The infinite gap we cannot apprehend, The somewhat that is lifeâthe informing mind. Even here in this still glen I cannot flee The secret that torments us everywhere. In cloud, sky, rock, tree, man, its mystery Pursues us ever to the same despair. What says this brook, that ever murmuring flows? What whisper these tall trees that talk alway? What secret hides the perfume of this rose? What is it that dear Nature strives to say? Our sense is dull, we cannot understand The voice we hearâbut, oh! so far away As from a world beyond our night and day, A dream-voice from some dim, imagined land. Here dreaming on in idle, tranquil mood, Lulled by the tune that Nature softly plays, Our wandering thoughts, by some strange spell subdued, Are calmed and stilled, and all seems sweet and good, And she our mother seems, that on her breast, With murmuring voice, and gentle, whispering ways, Hushes her child within her arms to rest; And, though the child scarce knoweth what she says, He feels her presence gently o'er him brood. And yet, O Nature, thou no mother art, But for a moment, like to this, at best A stern step-mother thou, that to thy heart Claspest thy child by some caprice possessed, Then, careless of his fate, abandonest, Flinging him off from thee to wail and cry, All heedless if he live or if he die. Is it for us thou, reckless, squanderest Thy beauty with such wide and lavish waste? For us? Ah! no; were we all swept away, What wouldst thou care? No change upon thy face Would answer to our sorrow or disgrace, Alike to those who love, laugh, weep, or pray. Glares not the sun impertinent upon Our darkest griefs? Do not the glad flowers blow, The unpausing hours, days, seasons, come and go, Despite our joys and loves? To all our woe Have we a sympathetic answer ever won? Are thy stones softer on the path we tread Because our thoughts are journeying with the dead? Is not this world, with all its beauty, rife With endless war, death preying upon life, Perpetual horror, pain, crime, discord, strife, Night chasing day, storms driving sunshine out? And yet through all impassive, stern, and cold, With folded hands, which hide whate'er they hold, Like Nemesis, thou standest, speaking not, Before the gates of Fate; and, if they ope, To show one glimpse beyond, one gleam of hope, 'T is but an instant; then the door is shut; And, poor, blind creatures, here astray we grope, Stretching our hands out where we cannot see, Through the dark paths of this world's mystery. And yet, why spoil the day with thoughts like these? Better to lie beneath these whispering trees And take the joy the moment gives, and feel The glad, pure day, the gently lifting breeze That steals their odors from the unconscious flowers, Nor seek what Nature never will reveal, The hidden secret of our destinies. Let all goâwhate'er it is it is, And, come what will, this day, at least, is ours. My hour is gone, dear glen, and now farewell. Here you the self-same song, bright brook, will sing; Here you, dark firs, the self-same tale will tell, Mysterious, to the low wind whispering, How many a summer day to other ears, When I am gone, beyond all doubts, hopes, fears, Beyond all sights and sounds of this fair world, Into the dim beyond; in time to come Will many a dreamer sit for many an hour, Lulled by your murmur, and the insects' hum, And many a poet praise you. Clasped and curled Beside these rocks, and plucking some chance flower, Will many a pair of lovers linger, dumb With loves too much for utterance, all too weak The charm they feel, the joy they own, to speak. Here wandering from the noisy city's maze, How many an idle, casual visitor Thy beauty with a careless tone will praise, And turn away without one true heart-stir. Here the dull woodman, thinking but of gain, Heedless of any Dryad's shriek of pain, Will fell with ringing axe this living wood; And here some gentle child, o'er whom the dream And lingering lights of former being brood, Perchance may meet some Naiad at this stream, By whom her language shall be understood, And here together they will talk and play, And many a secret she will strive to tell That here she learns, and all the world will say, Laughing: âDear child, this is not credible.â Ah Heaven! we know so much who nothing know! Only to children and in poets' ears, At whom the wise world wondering smiles and sneers, Secrets of God are whispered here below. Only to them, and those whose gentle heart Is opened wide to list for Beauty's call, Will Nature lean to whisper the least part Of that great mystery which circles all. The wise, dull world, with solid facts content, Laughs at all dreamers, deeming nothing good Save what is touched, seen, handled, understood. Well, let it laugh! To me the firmament Is more than gleaming lights; more than mere wood These leafy groves; and more these murmuring streams Than running waters. This wide, vaporous sky, Painted by morning, fired by sunset gleams, These winds that breathe around this swinging world, This restless ocean, moaning constantly, These storms across the shuddering forests whirled, The season's still processions, day and night, That each the other silently pursues, Sure and unchanging in their even flight, And all these changing shows and forms and hues Not for mere use were given, nor mere delight. Beauty is theirs and power, and, more, a fine Dim mystery shrouds them man can ne'er divine. Harvests that sweeten life and thought they bear Imponderable, exquisite, and rare, That take the spirit with a sweet surprise. Dreams haunt them, intimations, prophecies, Glad lessons, adumbrations, spirit gleams, That, when the loving heart evokes them, rise. Others may reap their solid facts; for me, I am content to gather inwardly Their silent harvest of poetic dreams. PRIMAVERA. The Spring has passed this wayâLook! where she trod The daring crocus sprang up through the sod To greet her coming with glad heedlessness, Scarce waiting to put on its leafy dress, But bright and bold in its brave nakednessâ And further onâmark!âo'er this gentle rise She must have paused, for soft anemones Are trembling to the wind, couched low among The fresh green grasses that so lush have sprung Where the hid runnel with low tinkling tongue Babbles its secret troublesâHere she stopped A longer while, and on this rising sweep, As pensively she lingered, see, she dropped A knot of love-sick violets from her breast, Which, ere she threw them down, she must have kissed, For still the fragrance of her breath they keepâ And look!âhere, too, her passing robes have brushed, Where this white leafless almond faintly blushed To greet herâand in blossoms burst as she Swept by it gladsomely and gracefully. Where is she now? Gone! Vain it were to try To overtake herâHere then let us lie On this green slope and weave a wreath, and sing With our best skill the joyous praise of Spring, Thankful for these sweet gifts she left behindâ Flowers, grass, and showery perfume of the wind. Pursuit is uselessâshe like all things fair Will not be hunted down into her lair And caught and prisonedâLet us not be rude, Nor seek into her presence to intrude, But praise her in the distance!âthen perchance She may not flee away with wingÃ¨d feet, But pause and backward cast a favoring glance, And waft a fragrance to us rare and sweetâ Too eager, we our present joy may miss In the vain chase of an imagined bliss, The Ideal joy no human hand can seize, The dream that ever lures and vanishes. Rude blustering March has gone to sleep to-day, And left the world for Spring therein to play And wander as it will through grove and dell To work her sweet and gentle miracle And bring the dead to life.âBut who can tell When jealous March may wake and wreak his wrath Upon the dear intruder, blind her path With stinging sleet, pelt her with rattling hail, Drive the swollen torrent madly down the vale, Scatter her blossoms, blast her tender crops, Roar up the hill-sides, grasping by their tops The shuddering trees, and screaming through the grove Distort with passion its calm face of love? Should he but wake and with a voice of dread Come trampling on the thunderous clouds o'erhead To shake the world and flash his startling blades Of lightning out,âswift as in Enna's vale When Proserpine slow loitering through the glades Beheld black Pluto with his face of bale And dropped her flowers and fled,âso in affright Spring shuddering would turn and flee from sight. But truce to idle fears,âin these blue skies No thunder threatens,âall is calm and still As a child sleeping, and this shadowy hill Is full of glancing lights and perfumed breath, And the green springing grass is fresh beneath Our wandering feet. Not even Paradise Was sweeter, fairer, ere the thought of death Had darkened o'er it, and the world was new, And Love without a fear its gladness knew. The day is passingâlet us own its spell Calm as the trees that feel within them swell The secret thrill and currents of the spring, And outward yearn in leaves and blossomingâ Content to take what nature freely gives,â Love for life's blossoms, gentle thoughts for leaves. LYRICS. IO VICTIS! I sing the hymn of the conquered, who fell in the Battle of Life,â The hymn of the wounded, the beaten, who died overwhelmed in the strife; Not the jubilant song of the victors, for whom the resounding acclaim Of nations was lifted in chorus, whose brows wore the chaplet of fame, But the hymn of the low and the humble, the weary, the broken in heart, Who strove and who failed, acting bravely a silent and desperate part; Whose youth bore no flower on its branches, whose hopes burned in ashes away, From whose hands slipped the prize they had grasped at, who stood at the dying of day With the wreck of their life all around them, unpitied, unheeded, alone, With Death swooping down o'er their failure, and all but their faith overthrown. While the voice of the world shouts its chorus,âits pÃ¦an for those who have won; While the trumpet is sounding triumphant, and high to the breeze and the sun Glad banners are waving, hands clapping, and hurrying feet Thronging after the laurel-crowned victors, I stand on the field of defeat, In the shadow, with those who are fallen, and wounded, and dying, and there Chant a requiem low, place my hand on their pain-knotted brows, breathe a prayer, Hold the hand that is helpless, and whisper, âThey only the victory win, Who have fought the good fight, and have vanquished the demon that tempts us within; Who have held to their faith unseduced by the prize that the world holds on high; Who have dared for a high cause to suffer, resist, fight,âif need be, to die.â Speak, History! who are Life's victors? Unroll thy long annals, and say, Are they those whom the world called the victorsâwho won the success of a day? The martyrs, or Nero? The Spartans, who fell at ThermopylÃ¦'s tryst, Or the Persians and Xerxes? His judges or Socrates? Pilate or Christ? SUNRISE. Sunrise! Sunrise! See! Into the silent field of the dawn, Where the mountain's clear sharp line is drawn, The light mounts steadily. While below in many a chasm deep, The mists of night still lingering creep, And the lower slopes are half asleep, And dimly dreaming,â And at last, look! look! how startlingly Into the world of the open sky, Where the light before was so pale and tender, And earth and air were still and aware With a silent expectation, Sails the sudden Sunâ With its banners of clouds above it streaming, Golden and purple, and rose and gray and dun, Flooding the world with its splendor, And gladdening all creation. And DayâDayâDay, has begun. There 's a rustle through leagues of forestâthe ocean stirs, Quivering with joy and light. The last star swoons and diesâonly the firs, And the sombre cedars, and cypresses tall, Solemn, dark, and funereal, Remember the vanished night. Day and life returnâand the earth rejoices, The air is alive with a murmur of busy voices; There 's the low of a myriad herds, Feeding on endless meadows,â There 's the joy of a myriad birds, Darting through leafy shadows,â There 's the quiver of endless leaves, That gleam at the day's returning,â And the breath of a world of flowers goes up Like incense unto the morning, As spreading their petals they shake from each cup The dews that its light imprison, And the life of a myriad insect-wings In the wet grass buzz and dizzen. The spider from twig to twig has swung His glimmering wheel of silken thread,â And the gossamer over the grasses hung His awning diamonded. The wild geese drop from the thin clear height, Where all night long they have held their flight, And settle on lake and mere; Up springs the lark, and, lost in the light, Carols his raptureâout of sight Thrilling the atmosphere. A thousand sails on the heaving sea By a sudden hue of rose are struck,â In a thousand cities shaft and spire Are quivering pointed with golden fire,â From a thousand homes into the sky The thin gray column of rising smoke Is stealing silently. The jar of the world of men begins,â The reaper and sower afield are going, The busy factory clacks and dins, The mill-wheel over its sluices whirls, Shattered in spray of diamond and pearls The torrents overflowing. There 's a ring of wagons on valley and hill,â From a thousand farms with clarion shrill The strutting cock is crowing. There is neighing and barking, and bleating and lowing, Chirp and chatter, and stir and clatter, And an infinite humming and whirring,â For the throbbing world is alive again, And its pulse is beating in every vein With the strength of a mighty stirring; Night with its shadows of death is done. The great new wondrous day has begun, And mountains and valleys, and seas and strands, Forests and rivers and torrents free, Startled, arouse and clap their hands, The glad new miracle to see, And shout, âThe Sun! The Sun!â All the world is alive and waking To hail the great new day that is breaking. Sharp through the western forest's tangled covers The hunter's rifle cracks, Where the black bear prowls, and the poising eagle hovers, And the beaver his mud-dam packs. There rings the pioneer's axe, and the forest giant That has caught the day's first flash On its topmost crest for a full long century, quiversâ Shuddersâand falls with a crash. Far in the south, through thick Brazilian tangles The painted parrot screams, And the boa coiled on its branches droops and dangles, And the Paradise-bird like a living flash of splendor Through the burning summer streams. Over the western prairies herds of buffaloes Crowded and thundering rush,â The lion and tiger on sandy African deserts That all night long have ranged for their prey, Satiate now at the coming of day, Are stealing to cave and bush,â The ostrich is whirring, half running, half flying, On sultry Australian plains,â The hippopotamus lumbers along to the river Crashing among the canes,â The soft-eyed spotted giraffe his tall neck stretches The low wet branches to browse,â The ponderous elephants lift their trunks, and trumpet And shake the earth as they rouse. From seething Sumatra and tropic Madagascar, From Borneo's groves of spice, To the glacial fields where the white bear basks and souses And blunders along the ice,â From the sultry Indian Sea to the cold Atlantic, As on thy glory comes,â From the orient chambers of thy early rising, O'er Europe's plains and homes,â From the Himalayas on to the Alpsâand onward To the Rocky Mountains, that rise O'er the fair Pacific, peak to peak out-calling, Flushed as the glad news flies, Hail thee, O glorious Sun! all the earth hails thee, And the stir and the strife and the strain Of living beginsâand the world that was sleeping and dreaming Rouses and quivers again. Let trumpet and pipe and voice and song Echo unto the skies! Let chorus and hymn thy praise prolong, O glorious Sun! that comest again With thy ever-new surprise. O splendor of earth and life that gives Joy and beauty to all that lives And daily the world renews,â O fountain of light and color that flings O'er the darkest and dullest of earthly things Thy glad transfiguring hues,â O glory of earth and sea and sky, Life of a myriad worlds on high, Soul of the universe, light of its eye, Who shall his voice refuse, To swell the chorus that evermore Is shouted from flashing peaks that dare The cold thin depths of the breathless air Thy earliest glance to see,â To the crawling foam that fringes the shore Murmuring impatiently? From the tremulous forest that uplifts Its listening tops, while the morning breeze With its news from afar with a whisper sifts And thy glorious coming promises, To the humblest of weeds and grasses low, Where the clear cool stream with a murmurous flow, Is talking and running to catch a sight Of thy first sweet gleam of morning light, To tell unto all below. All, all are joining with one glad tone,â All, all are chanting their song as one,â From the bass of the thunderous avalanche And the cataract's dizzy booming To the whisper fine of the quivering breeze That hurries through myriad leagues of trees, And the insects infinite humming. The Sun! The Sun! The SunâThe King! The King of the World is coming! Fling forth your bannersâshout and sing, Until the whole wide universe ring With a vast and joyous welcoming, For the King, the King is coming! MOONRISE. Night, beloved night! She is comingâshe soon will come; Slowly is paling the dying light, Twilight has lost its bloom, And a serious hush steals silently Over the shadowy Earth,â While faint in the delicate air on high The first new star has birth. Against the twilight, their shoulders bare, The mountains are turning as to sleep; And one by one from their chambers deep, Where from the peering search they hid Of the day's rude gaze and opened lid, A myriad worlds come forth. The riotous day is gone With his cymbals clashing, his bright spears flashing, His tumult and rout, his Bacchanal's shout, His gladness and madness, and laughter and raving, His banners and thyrsi and coronals waving; And his chorus and dances and singing are done,â The noisy array has hurried away And vanished below the horizon's rim Into worlds beyond,âand his gonfalons gay Of sunset glories are dim and grey, And have all forgotten himâ For night, with its shadowy silent presence, Is stealing on, And under its spell so calm and serious The wondering world stands still, And a feelingâvague, intense, mysteriousâ Is brooding o'er valley and hill. The stars in their blue unfathomed tomb Gleam far and bright,â They are waiting the coming of the moon, The Regent of the Night. Nor long they awaitâfor lookâserene Above the hills revealed, Large and majestic in her mien, Into the clear, expectant sky She lifts her gleaming shieldâ And with a pensive peaceful grace Takes queenlike there her silent place, And looks o'er all the enchanted world With calm pathetic face. All own her gentle influence, So tender, so intense; And over all a breath of prayer Floats like a feeling through the air, And soothes the soul and sense. Along the river's course the slow mists cling, As murmuring on it swells. In the dark grass a myriad grilli ring Their chimes of tiny bells. From rugged mountain-steeps that dark and bare Shrouded in shadow dream, Voices of white cascades, whose veils out-stream And hang upon the air, Chant to the Night their praises as they go To join the torrent hurrying hoarse below O'er its gray boulders tossed. The soft wind whispering sings its mountain song As slow it drives the low white clouds along, Or murmurs through the black platoons of pines, Whose serried ranks together push Their tall uplifted spears, and rush Up the sheer sides of Alps and Apennines,â Or tremulous breathes o'er many a peaceful slope Of gracious Italy, Where in festoons the swaying vineyards droop, And the gray olives up the hillsides troopâ A ghostly company, Pallid and faint, as they had only known The moon for friendâand in its light had grown. A dream the vales and hills and meadows haunts,â Earth sleeping turns and sighs,âthe ocean pants, And weary, flings itself upon the breast Of the broad beach, scarce knowing what it wants, Stirred by a strange unrest; The sky's deep dome is filled with mysteries dim And tremulous throbs,âthe swift and wheeling spheres With music thrill, too fine for human ears, And Nature, with its myriad voices, chants To thee its faint night hymn. Nor Nature only,âevery living thing Thy influence feels, and all of harsh and rude, Touched by thy sweet and gentle visiting, Grows peaceful and subdued. In the dark woods the hidden nightingale, With rapturous trills, and sudden passion-throbs, And liquid bursts, and low recurrent sobs, Repeats his love-lorn tale. The plaintive cry of the sad whippoorwill Is heard along the hill. The leathern bat wheels round in noiseless flight Across the glimmering and uncertain light,â And mournfully afar the feathery owl Hoots in the ear of night. From many a pond, where on its green-paved floor Of tessellated leaves the lily sleeps, While the pale willow drooping o'er it weeps, His guttural bass the frog sings o'er and o'er. From out the tall dark silhouetted tower, At intervals, with deep and solemn stroke, The church bells strike the quarters and the hour. There comes a bleating from the folded flock, A tinkle of faint bells,â From the dim fields the voice of country folk, Talking and laughing, swells; And now and then the bay Of some enchanted watch-dog far away, That feels night's influence, and cannot say What stirs him so, Is heard lamenting,âor some wakened cock Crows out a drowsy crow. But all these sounds and voices seem To melt away into the tender dream That haunts the air, And soothe the silence which were else too deep For heart to bear. All sleep! The tired world sleeps! A quiet infinite The soul of man and nature steeps, And smooths the brow of night. The weary ox lays off his yoke,â The dog hunts in his dream alone,â The woodman wields no more his stroke,â The beggar, 'neath his ragged cloak, On the cold pavement thrown, No longer heeds the world's dark frown, No longer hungers, racked with pains, But roams along Elysian plains And wears a monarch's crown. A myriad mortals lay their head Upon oblivion's poppied bed, By peaceful slumber blest, And all day's busy toils and cares, And all the hard world's strain and stress, And all its tortuous snarls and snares Are lifted from their breast,â As lapped in calm unconsciousness They sleepâthey rest. But Love awakes: O silent moon, Upon how many a happy pair That breathe this silvery tranquil air, Serene thou lookest down! As wandering, blest by Life's best boon, Through many a lane and shadowy grove They lingering talkâor pausing dream, And strive to tell their love; While following them, now bright now dim, The listening stars above Through the o'erhanging tree-tops swim And with them pauseâor move. Their bliss intense, their thrill of sense That words can never half express, Thou seest as they wander on,â His clasping arm around her thrown, She trembling in his fond caress,â And all the air is still to hear, And all the heavens above, The sweet low broken utterances, The silences of Love. The nightingale that knows to sing Love's passion and Love's pain, Cries LoveâLoveâLoveâinterpreting Their thrill of heart and brain. And sorrow wakesâand in despair Looks up, O night, to thee And wailsââOh where are they, oh where, Whom Death hath torn from me? Speakâspeak, O nightâO heaven, declare From thine infinity.â And thouâwhat answerest thou, O night, O boundless tremulous air, O moon, O starsâto that wild cry, To that impassioned prayer? Nothing! In calm serenity, Unmoved thou standest there, Deafâsilentâcold and pitiless To all we have to bear. No! no! the tears of passion past, Thou givest us thy boon at last. Thou sayestââCome to me and weep;ââ Thou givest thy beloved sleep; Thou summonest again the form That death hath snatched away, The glad lost voice, the body warm, The animate dear clay, The dream at least of all that was Denied to us by day. O Night of grand repose! O silent serious Night! Beside thy pathos infinite How vain are Daylight's shows! Thine is the grand dim realm of dream, Thine the mysterious power whose spell Leads Fancy on beyond the extreme Of this world's possible. Thine the soft touch that charms the waking sense, And woos the troubled soul to confidence. To thee our secret woes we tell, To thee our inmost being bare, With thee our deepest feelings share, Mother divine, ineffable. Our hopes, our loves, that in the pride Of busy daylight are repressedâ Our doubts, remorses, hidden fears, That gnaw within the breast; To thee, great mother, we confide And on thy bosom shed our tears, As thy great arms thou openest wide To give us rest. O Nightâa secret prophecy Thou whisperest beneath thy breath Of that vast dim infinity, Where broods the silent shadowâDeath. Listening I seem to hear thee say,â âAs I from out the body steal For few brief hours the soul away, My passing dream-world to reveal; So my dark Brother, when your eyes He in his endless sleep shall close, Shall bear youâfar beyond the woes Of this short lifeâto the repose Of an eternal Paradise.â COMPANIONS ON THE ROAD. Life's milestones, marking year on year, Pass ever swifter as we near The final goal, the silent end To which our fated footsteps tend. A year once seemed a century, Now like a day it hurries by, And doubts and fears our hearts oppress, And all the way is weariness. Ah me! how glad and gay we were, Youth's sap in all our veins astir, When long ago with spirits high, A happy careless company, We started forth, when everything Wore the green glory of the spring, And all the fair wide world was ours, To gather as we would its flowers! Then, Life almost eternal seemed, And Death a dream so vaguely dreamed, That in the distance scarce it threw A cloud-shade on the mountains blue, That rose before us soft and fair, Clothed in ideal hues of air, To which we meant in after-time, Strong in our manhood's strength, to climb. How all has changed! Years have gone by, And of that joyous company With whom our youth first journeyed on, Whoâwho are left? Alas, not one! Love earliest loitered on the way, Then turned his face and slipped away; And after him with footsteps light The fickle Graces took their flight, And all the careless Joys that lent Their revelry and merriment Grew silenter, and, ere we knew, Had smiled their last and said âadieu.â Hope faltering then with doubtful mind, Began to turn and look behind, And we, half questioning, were fain To follow with her back again; But Fate still urged us on our way And would not let us pause or stay. Then to our side with plaintive eye, In place of Hope came Memory, And murmured of the Past, and told Dear stories of the days of old, Until its very dross seemed gold, And Friendship took the place of Love, And strove in vain to us to prove That Love was light and insincereâ Not worth a man's regretful tear. Ah! all in vainâgrant 't was a cheat, Yet no voice ever was so sweetâ No presence like to Love's, who threw Enchantment over all we knew; And still we listen with a sigh, And back, with fond tears in the eye, We gaze to catch a glimpse again Of that dear faceâbut all in vain. Preach not, O stern Philosophy! Naught we can have, and naught we see, Will ever be so pure, so glad, So beautiful, as what we had. Our steps are sadâour steps are slowâ Nothing is like the long ago. Gone is the keen, intense delightâ The perfume faint and exquisiteâ The glory and the effluence That haloed the enraptured sense, When Faith and Love were at our side, And common Life was deified. Our shadows that we used to throw Behind us, now before us grow; For once we walked towards the sun,â But now, Life's full meridian done, They change, and in their chill we move, Further away from Faith and Love. A chill is in the airâno more Our thoughts with joyous impulse soar, But creep along the level way, Waiting the closing of the day. The Future holds no wondrous prize This side Death's awful mysteries; Beyond, what waits for us, who knows? New Life, or infinite repose? âDE MORTUIS.â âManibus date lilia plenis Purpureos spargam flores, animamque... His saltem accumulem donis et fungar inani munere.â Oh come, let us haste to his grave, let us scatter rich garlands of flowers! We gave him scant honor while living; faint reticent praises were ours For his genius, his virtues, his courage,âbut now his quick spirit hath fled: O'er his tomb wreaths of roses and laurels and bays let us strew to him dead. Ay, now, when all weeping and praising are utterly vain, let us weep! Let us praise him ungrudgingly now that, unconscious, he sleeps his last sleep. Will he heed what we say?âWill he hear us and see us? Ah no! 't is too late! We are always too late with our praises and pÃ¦ans,âdelaying, we wait, Till Death shrouds the windows and darkens life's warm breathing house with its pall, And in vain, to the tenant departed, Love, Friendship, or Calumny call. Ah! then we arouse in our griefs, ah! then, and then only, the meed That was due to the warm living spirit we give to the cold senseless dead. For our brother, while here he is striving and moving along the world's ways, We have only harsh judgments, stern counsel, half-uttered affections, cold praise. Our cheer of full-hearted approval, our frank, quick applause we deny; Envy, Malice, and Jealousy, Calumny, all the world's hounds in full cry Unrelenting pursue himâwhile Friendship barks low in the rear of the race, Reluctant, perhaps, at his faults and his frailties, till Death ends the chase. Ah! then all his virtues, his merits shine forth; all the charms that he owned Rise up unobscured in their beauty, all frailties and faults are atoned. All the good is remembered and pondered, the bad swept away out of sight, And in death we behold him transfigured, and robed in memorial light. We lament when lamenting is useless, we praise when all praises are vain, And then, turning back and forgetting, begin the same sad work again. Ah! why did we stint to him living our gift? Were we poor? Had we naught,â Not a wreath, not a flower,âfor our friend to whose grave we such tribute have brought? Ah, no! the largess of the heart that had strengthened and gladdened his soul We refused him, and proffered him only the critic's poor miserly dole. Still we meant to be just, so we claim, though the judgment was cold that we gave. Was our justice then better than love?âCome, say! as you stand by his grave. THE BLACKBIRD. Upon the cherry-bough the blackbird sings His careless, happy song, As 'mid the rubied fruit he tilting swings, Heedless of Right or Wrong. No Future taunts him with its fears or hopes, No cares his Present fret; The Past for him no dismal vista opes Of useless, dark regret. Ah! how I envy him, as there he sings His glad unthinking strain, Untroubled by the sad imaginings That haunt man's plotting brain! All orchards are his home; no work or care Compels him here to stay; His is the worldâthe breathing, open airâ The glorious summer day. Below, Earth blossoms for him; and above, Heaven smiles in boundless blue; Joy is in all things, and the song of Love Thrills his whole being through. From bough to bough its gay and transient guest Is free to come and go Where'er the whim invites, where'er the best Of juicy blackhearts grow. His are their sunny sides, that through and through He stabs with coral bill; And his the happiness man never knew, That conscience cannot kill. Ah! we who boast we are the crown of things Like him are never glad; By doubts and dreams and dark self-questionings We stand besieged and sad. What know we of that rare felicity The unconscious blackbird knows, That no misgiving spoils; that frank and free From merely living grows? Haggard Repentance ever dogs our path; The foul fiend Discontent Harries the spirit, and the joys it hath Are but a moment lent. The riddle of our Life we cannot guess; From toil to toil we haste, And in our sweetest joy some bitterness Of secret pain we taste. Ah! for an hour at least, when bold and free In being's pure delight, Loosed from the cares that clog humanity, The soul might wing its flight! Then, blackbird, we might sing the perfect song Of Life and Love with thee, Where no regret nor toil, nor fear of Wrong, Nor doubt of Right should be. LOVE AND DEATH. Since Death must come, now let it come to meâ Now, while my soul with Love's felicity Is brimmed to overflowing,ânaught on earth Again so dear, so exquisite can be. Now, with thy strong arms round me, thy divine, Deep, silent eyes down gazing into mine, That seem to draw my soul forth from the deep, Far inner Life, that I to thee resign. So let me die,âafter love's perfect bliss, After the rapture of an hour like this, How can I sink to common trivial joys? No! rather seal my Life with one more kiss. Take thou my very, very soul from me Here through my lips, and draw me unto thee, My best, my dearest! It is heaven enough Here in thy arms forever more to be. AUTUMN. 'T is the golden gleam of an autumn day, With the soft rain raining as if in play; And a tender touch upon everything, As if autumn remembered the days of spring. In the listening woods there is not a breath To shake their gold to the sward beneath; And a glow as of sunshine upon them lies, Though the sun is hid in the shadowed skies. The cock's clear crow from the farmyard comes, The muffled bell from the belfry booms, And faint and dim, and from far away, Come the voices of children in happy play. O'er the mountains the white rain draws its veil, And the black rooks, cawing, across them sail, While nearer the swooping swallows skim O'er the steel-gray river's fretted brim. No sorrow upon the landscape weighs, No grief for the vanished summer days, But a sense of peaceful and calm repose Like that which age in its autumn knows. The spring-time longings are past and gone, The passions of summer no longer are known, The harvest is gathered, and autumn stands Serenely thoughtful with folded hands. Over all is thrown a memorial hue, A glory ideal the real ne'er knew; For memory sifts from the past its pain, And suffers its beauty alone to remain. With half a smile and with half a sigh It ponders the past that has hurried by; Sees it, and feels it, and loves it all, Content it has vanished beyond recall. O glorious autumn, thus serene, Thus living and loving all that has been! Thus calm and contented let me be When the autumn of age shall come to me. TO VICTOR. A LOST ODE OF HORACE. Nor I, nor thou, with all our seeking, know Whither, when life is over, we shall go, Nor what awaits us on that farther shore, Hid from our eyes by Acheron's dark flow. We only knowâand this we must endureâ That Death waits for us, whom no prayer or lure Can move or change; towards whose outstretched arms Each moment onward drives us, silent, sure. What he conceals behind that veil he draws We know not, Victor; but his shadow awes This life of ours, and in the very height Of joy and love he bids us shuddering pause. Virtue avails us not, nor wealth, nor power, To stay one moment the appointed hour. Marcellus, CÃ¦sar, Virgil, all have gone,â The fatal sickle reaps grain, bud, and flower. Where are they now? Upon some unknown strand Shall we again behold them, clasp their hand, And, untormented by the ills of life, Renew our friendship, and together stand? Or, when the end is reached, and come it must, Shall we, despite the hope in which we trust, Feel nothing more, nor love, nor joy, nor pain, But be at last mere mute, insensate dust? If so, then virtue is a lying snare. Let us fill high the bowl, drown sullen care, Reap the earth's joys and all the joys of sense, And of Life's bounty seize our fullest share. The Gods forbid the curious human eye Into the Future's mystery to spy. They give us hour by hour, and scarcely that; For, ere the hour is measured, we may die. But if thou goest before me where no speech, No word of friendship, no warm grasp, can reach, Let me not linger. May the pitying Gods Send the same final summons unto each! Whether stern Death reach out his hand to bless Or sweep us down to blank, dire nothingnessâ Whate'er may come, together let us go Where, at the worst, we shall escape life's stress. A MOMENT. How long would you love me? A lifetime? Ah, that is too long; let us say A moment. Life's best's but a moment, and life itself scarcely a day. Perhaps you might love me that moment; perhaps, while you quaffed From life's brimming cup, with your sweet face turned up, love's exquisite draught; All the spirit insatiate thirsting its sweetness to drain, And a hurry of rapture swift rushing through heart and through brain; All being condensed to a drop, all the soul, all the sense, Interfused as by fire, intermingled and throbbing with passion intense; Just one moment of Life's culmination, its waves' utmost height, While it lifts its green cavern of opal all sunfringed, in quivering light;â Its foam-rose that topples and spreads at the crest of the Fountain's full stress, That the impulse that lifts cannot hold, that dies of its very excess; Just one rapturous moment, while love you inhaled like the soul of a flower, For a breath space, an indrawing breath space, that words have no power At their best to express, so divine, so enchanting, its soul-piercing scent, Thrilling through all the nerves, but at last in a sigh to be breathed out and spent; Just one moment, no longer; and then, all the strength and desire Faded out, all the passion exhausted, naught left of the fire But the sullen, gray, desolate ashes,âoh, then, would you cling to me? Say, Would you love me, or hate me, or scorn me, and ruthlessly fling me away? Who knows? Love and hate are so near, joy and pain, ice and fire, hope and fear, That I doubt, the next moment, this moment so tender, so perfect, so dear. This maddening moment I know, let the next what it chooses reveal; 'T is enough that you love me this moment, let Fate, as she will, spin her wheel, Weave her web, cast her net, unto grief or despair make us prey; This is mine, this is ours, and, once given, can never be taken away. What though, from our dream when we wake, our love a mere folly may seem? What is life at the best but a sleep? what is love but a dream? AFTER MANY DAYS. Yes, dear, I remember those old days, And oh, how charming they were! I doubtâno, I know that no others to come Will ever such feelings stir. We had only been married a few months. And love, like a delicate haze, Veiled in beauty the trivial doings, The commonest facts of those days. Life was all smiling before us, And nature was smiling around; Spring hovering near us caressed us, And joy with its aureole crowned; 'Mid the flowers and the trees in blossom, Afar from the world we dwelt, And the air was sweet with a thousand odors, And the world like a full rose smelt. In the morning I used to leave you, And that was the only pain;â Through the grass with its dewdrops diamonded We walked down the shadowy lane, And as far as the gate you went with me, And there, with a kiss we said Good-by; and you lingering watched me, And smiled and nodded your head, And waved your handkerchief to me, And I constantly turned to see If you still were there, and my daily work Seemed a cruel necessity; The last turn took you away from me, As on to my task I went, But your face all day looked up from the page, As over my book I bent. And when day was over, how gladly I rushed from the dusty town! As I opened the gate, I whistled, And there was your fluttering gown As you ran with a smile to meet me, With your brown curls tossing free, And your arms were thrown about my neck As I clasped you close to me. And the birds broke into a chorus Of twittering joy and love, And the golden sunset flamed in the trees, And gladdened the sky above, As up the lane together We slowly loitered along, While love in our hearts was singing Its young and exquisite song. The blood through our veins ran swiftly, Like a stream of lambent fire; Our thoughts were all winged, and our spirits Uplifted with sweet desire. My joy, my love, my darling, You made the whole world sweet, And the very ground seemed beautiful That you pressed beneath your feet. What was there more to ask for, As I held you closely there, And you smiled with those gentle, tender eyes, And I breathed the scent of your hair? Stop, Time, and speed no further! Nothing, as long as we live, Can give such a radiance of delight, As one hour of love can give. The lilacs were filling with fragrance The air along the lane, And I never smell the lilacs But those hours revive again; And oft, though long years have vanished, One whiff of their scent will bring Those old dear days, with their thrill of life, When love was in blossoming. Time has gone on despite us, We both have grown old and gray, And love itself has grown old and staid, But it never has flown away; The fragile and scented blossom Of springtime and youth is shed, But its sound, sweet fruit of a large content Hath ripened for us instead. SPRING. Doves on the sunny eaves are cooing, The chip-bird trills from the apple-tree, Blossoms are bursting, and leaves renewing, And the crocus darts up, the Spring to see. Spring has come with smile of blessing, Kissing the earth with her soft warm breath Till it blushes in flowers at her gentle caressing, And wakes from the winter's dream of death. Spring has come! the rills as they glisten Sing to the pebbles and greening grass, Under the sward the violets listen, And dream of the sky as they hear her pass. Coyest of roses feel her coming, Swelling their buds with a promise to her, And the wild bee hears her, around them humming, And booms about with a joyous stir. Oaks, that the bark of a century covers, Feel ye the spell as ye groan and sigh? Say, does the spirit that round you hovers Whisper of youth and love gone by? Windows are open; the pensive maiden Leans o'er the sill with a wistful sigh,â Her heart with tender longings o'erladen, And a happy sadness she knows not why. For we and the trees are brothers in nature; We feel in our veins the season's thrill, In hopes that reach to a higher stature, In blind dim longings beyond our will, Whence dost thou come, O joyous spirit? From realms beyond this human ken, To paint with beauty the earth we inherit, And soften to love the hearts of men? Dear angel! that blowest with breath of gladness The trump to waken the year in its grave, Shall we not hear after death's deep sadness A voice as tender to gladden and save? Dost thou not sing a constant promise, That joy shall follow that other voice,â That nothing of good shall be taken from us, But all who hear it shall rise to rejoice? A BLACK DAY. I thought it was dead; That the years had crushed it down and trodden it out With their cruel tramp and tread; That nothing was left but the ashes, cold and gray, Of a love that had wholly passed away, With its hope, and fear, and joy, and doubt. But nothing utterly dies; And again, as I tread the paths of these silent woods, Where we walked and loved a few long years ago, And list to the wind's soft sighs Rustling the solitudes, And the low, perpetual hum and welling flow Of the torrent that finds its way And talks to itself among the mossy, gray And unchanged boulders and stonesâ Again, with a sudden, sharp surprise, The old life leaps anew with a rush before me: The cloud of these dreary years that have darkened o'er me Lifts and passes, and you are again beside me: The tones of your voice I hear; I look in your tender eyes, And I fiercely and vainly long for what is denied me, And I curse my cruel fate, as I cursed it then. Ah! what has brought me here to this fatal glen? I would that the sky was a globe of fragile glass, That I to atoms might dash it; And the flowers, and the trees, and the whole wide world around Were all at my very feet lying here on the ground, That I into flinders might dash it. With a terrible impotent rage my close-clenched hand I shake at these pitiless skies that glare above, And the smothered flame of a wild, despairing love, One breath of the breeze with a sudden strength has fanned To a world-wide conflagration; And I cry in a torture of pain, With a cry that is all in vain,â Come back, come back again, And deny me not in my desperation The love that I crave,âthe love you denied of yore! Come back and behold me, and into my spirit pour Some balm of consolation; Or strike me dead to the earth, that I no more May grovel, tortured in spirit and wild with grief, Looking out all over the world in vain for relief. Come back, I implore! Curses upon the place, the time, the hour, When first I met you; Curses upon myself, that am all without the power, Despite my will, to forget you! Ah, would to God that you for an hour's brief spaceâ Only an hourâmight suffer as I do! Ah, would to God that you were here in my place, With the barb in your heart, like a deer at the end of the race, With naught but despair beside you, Nothing but death and the heartless skies above, That laugh alike at our joy and our grief and our love. But no! ah no! you are happy, and gay, and glad. And what care you for the memories dark and sad That have ruined my hereafter! Brook-like, above my broken hopes that lie Hidden, perchance, beneath your memory Your light thoughts run with laughter. I see you smiling,âI know you are smiling still; At the fountain of joy you stoop and drink your fill, Careless whose heart you are breaking. But the terrible thirst with which I am curst, Ah me! is beyond all slaking; For the stream of which I am drinking Is a torrent of fire and fierce desire. For me there is no more thinking, No more hoping, or dreaming, or yearning, No more living, and no more laughing, Nothing for me but that fountain burning, Where my spirit is ever quaffing. Curses upon the hour and the place, I say! Why did my footsteps lead me here? Will these wild memories never pass away? Can I never forget you? Ah, too dear, too dear! Never while life shall last, Never, ah never, till all the world has passed! VETERIS VESTIGIA FLAMMÃ. Long years have gone, and down their slope From that high crest of Youth and Hope Life hath flowed on with downward range Through many a devious chance and change, And Childish Innocence has died, And Joy, that once was eager-eyed, Grown dim of sight, and the heart's thrill, That sent the quick blood through my veins At some poor nothing, now is still Even to ambition's strains. The Rose has lost its odors rare Since we in childhood breathed it there On those high hills so far away; I know not what it is has gone. Now I return to-day; But all the world has lost the tone It had of yore, though wearily It still goes on. 'T is not your fault, O perfect sky, Across whose silent deeps serene The white clouds sail so silently; 'T is not your fault, O murmurous wood, Within whose leafy solitude Of ever waving green A whisper runs, whose fragrant sward With myriad bright-eyed flowers is starred. Ah no!âye all are still as fair As in those happy days ye were; And yet in my unhappy mood, So deeply is my soul subdued, I cannot take of all your joy My willing share. Ah Nature, sympathetic friend, What more hast thou to us to lend Than what to thee we give? Ours is the joy that makes thee gladâ The sorrow ours that makes thee sadâ Our life you only live. And so to me to-day you bring A sense of sweet remembering, A craving dim and vague and sad, That will not let my heart be glad Despite thy beautyâwill not set My spirit free from out its net, And turns my smile into a sigh After the days gone by. You plague me with a far refrain; You haunt me with an inner pain, A sense of something lost, that seems To reach me like some far-off strain Borne to me from the land of dreams; A sweet, a sad, a faint refrain That only sings,âCome back, come back, Come back again! Take all I have and give me back The lost again! Come back? Ah no! What once was joy, What still to dream is bliss, Near, my changed spirit would annoy; Its charm in distance is. The touch that from Youth's high-strung harp Ecstatic music wings Would make but discord harsh and sharp On age's slackened strings. No! far and softened let them lieâ Those dreams of what has been, By the faint haze of memory Transfigured and serene. No power can take me by the hand And lead me where I fain would goâ Into that dear and dream-like land. Ah no! ah no!â Time's silent stream runs ever down With unreturning flow, And what we once have lived, loved, known, Is past to live, love, know. Vain is our longing, our regret, Our joy and our despair; The gates are shut and will not let Our spirits backward fare. Yet, as I speak, what power is this, That with an odor rare Hath had the charm my soul to bear Through hidden secret galleries, And searching swift the deep abyss Of inner Lifeâthe tortuous maze Of tangled memoriesâbrought to me The lost of early days? The simple odor of a flower That I have plucked by chanceâ So slight a thing has had the power My being to entrance. The present like a slough is shed, And once again I hear That voice that has been mute and dead So many a dreary year; Again those eyes look into mine, Again a morning light Breaks over that dear face of thine Of childish frank delightâ Almost I seem to touch thy hand!â Ah no! not that!âah no! There breaks the bridge, on which I standâ Beyond I cannot goâ The voice, the smile, the vision fine, Those for a moment's space were mine, Thus far could dreams deceive; But not the touch,âthe human hand That nothing ere will give. IN THE RAIN. I stand in the cold gray weather, In the white and silvery rain; The great trees huddle together, And sway with the windy strain. I dream of the purple glory Of the roseate mountain-height, And the sweet-to-remember story Of a distant and dear delight. The rain keeps constantly raining, And the sky is cold and gray, And the wind in the trees keeps complaining That summer has passed away;â But the gray and the cold are haunted By a beauty akin to pain,â By the sense of a something wanted, That never will come again. IN THE MOONLIGHT. We sat in the perfect moonlight; The stars were dim and rare, And above us the elm-trees rustled In the waves of the cool night-air. From the olives and vineyard near us The kiou-owl plaintively cried, And away o'er the misty hollows Its mate with a wail replied. The peasant sang in the distance, The watchdog barked at the star, And the clack of the cradles beating the hemp Came faint from the farms afar. We talked of the times of our childhood, Of the days forever flown, Of their games and their jests and their sorrows, And the playmates we had known; And then there came o'er us a silence, While the cypresses sighed overhead,â And dreaming we sat and listened To the voices of the dead. THE SAD COUNTRY. There is a sad, sad country, Where often I go to see A little child that for all my love Will never come back to me. There smiles he serenely on me With a look that makes me cry; And he prattling runs beside me Till I wish that I could die. That country is dim and dreary, Yet I cannot keep away, Though the shadows there are heavy and dark, And the sunlight sadder than they. And there, in a ruined garden, Which once was gay with flowers, I sit by a broken fountain, And weep and pray for hours. AT PEACE. 'T is twilight! the murmurous voices Of maidens that stroll with their lovers Beneath the dark ilex's shadows Come faint to my ear. No cloud in the soft azure heaven Is floatingâthe moon in its fulness Looks down with a mild face of pity, And night holds its breath. Innumerous under the grasses The grilli are ceaselessly chirping, Above them the luccioli lighten, And all is at peace! At peace! ay, the peace of the desert! The silence, the deep desolation, That comes when the blast has swept o'er us And buried our hopes. At peace! when the music that thrilled us, The hand that its harmonies wakened, The voice that was soul to the singing, Alike are at rest! At peace! ay, the peace of the ocean, When past is the storm where we foundered, And morning looks o'er the blank waters, And hears but their moan! EIDOLON. This was the shape for which so long in vain My soul had pantedâahâat last! I cried, As with a beating heart and flaming brain I sprang to clasp itâah! my love, my bride, Mine, mine at lastâthou whom so long my thought In secret hath pursued, whom flattering hope Hath falsely promised, whom my soul hath sought Through many an ambushed doubt adown the slope Of many a wild and glittering despair, Ever to lose thee in the morning gleam Or twilight shadowânow! O sweet and rare, O perfect creature, in these arms at last, At last, I clasp theeâand I hold thee fast, To own forever. As I spoke, the air Sighed through the fading grassâthe sunlit stream Shuddered and crisped to shadowâthrough the leaves A quiver passed as of a voice that grievesâ And down the lengthening distance died away, While over all a silent darkness creptâ Swift as a thought, evasive as a dream, She vanishedâall the world was dead and gray, And silent and oppressed I stoodâI wept. TWO PARTINGS. I. The breath of the wild briar rose makes sweet The twilight air along the dewy lane,â Soft yields the greensward to our lingering feet, And thou art with me, dearest, once again. There cling the rooks, slow-dropping from the spire That pierces through the sky's dim silvery light,â And through the thick trees burns with orange fire The low flat moon o'er yonder sloping height. Hark! was not that the sound of running feet? They must not find us here alone, and thus! One long last kiss, dear love! we yet shall meet Somehow,âGod knows,âand will take care of us. II. What shadow flickers on the curtain there? I knew, beloved, thou wouldst come at last! Ah death! its weight is all too much to bear Now thou art comeâand all the past is past. Look in my eyes! oh! there 's so much to say, How shall I lift its load from off my heart? My head 's so weakâmy strength all flows away And there 's so little time before we part. I see you once again!â'T is not a dream! Yet all 's so dimâoh stay beside meâstay! Throw your arms round meâcatch meâfor I seem To lose you, love,âand all things fade away. TWENTY YEARS AGO. Nina, do you those nights remember When in the moonlight's amber glow (Those blissful evenings of September) We sat and watched the river's flow? Ah me! 't is twenty years ago! Ah, then we swore to love forever, While feeling made our voices low, And Fate we dared our hearts to sever, For Youth and Love no danger knowâ Ah me! 't is twenty years ago! What pledges then to Life were given, What dreams that into deeds should grow, The great moon listening up in heaven While we were whispering there belowâ Ah me! 't is twenty years ago. But Love and Youth and Fame and Glory, So real then in Life's first glow, Are now a dim remembered story Of some divine and dreamlike show That passedâsome twenty years ago. And in these evenings of September I pace the path with footsteps slow, And sighing, dreaming, I remember The sweetness gone from here belowâ Ah me! some twenty years ago. And half a dream and half ideal On memory's magic glass you go, While on your head, but scarcely real There shines a faint auroral glowâ Ah me! of twenty years ago. TO BIANCA. âTu ne quÃ¦sieris, scire nefas.â Cease to peer into the future, nor torture yourself with care Of fancied delights or troubles that never may fall to your share! The present alone is ours; in that let us live content, Enjoying the daily blessings the gods for the moment have lent. And cease to torment your spirit with that which has passed away, The love that has vanished, the passion, the folly that led you astray; Not hoping too much, not regrettingâfor what is more vain than regret?â And, never the gladness forgetting, the pain and the sorrow forget. Take, O Bianca, the beauty and joy of the world to thy heart! For the power to enjoy is not only a blessing,â't is also an art. And be glad for the gifts that are granted, nor envy what cannot be thine; For the life, that with Fate is in balance, is peaceful, and, so far, divine. IN THE GARDEN. Summer is dying, slowly dyingâ She fades with every passing day; In the garden alleys she wanders, sighing, And pauses to grieve at the sad decay. The flowers that came with the spring's first swallow, When March crept timidly over the hill, And slept at noon in the sunny hollowâ The snowdrop, the crocus, the daffodil, The lily, white for an angel to carry, The violet, faint with its spirit-breath, The passion-flower, and the fleeting, airy Anemoneâall have been struck by death. Autumn the leaves is staining and strewing, And spreading a veil o'er the landscape rare; The glory and gladness of summer are going, And a feeling of sadness is in the air. The purple hibiscus is shrivelled and withered, And languid lolls its furry tongue; The burning pomegranates are ripe to be gathered; The grilli their last farewell have sung; The fading oleander is showing Its last rose-clusters over the wall, And the tubes of the trumpet-flower are strewing The gravel-walks as they loosen and fall; The crocketed spire of the hollyhock towers, For the sighing breeze to rock and swing; On its top is the last of its bell-like flowers, For the wandering bee its knell to ring. In their earthen vases the lemons yellow, The sun-drunk grapes grow lucent and thin, The pears on the sunny espalier mellow, And the fat figs swell in their purple skin; The petals have dropped from the spicy carnation; And the heartless dahlia, formal and proud, Like a worldly lady of lofty station, Loveless stares at the humble crowd. And the sunflower, too, looks boldly around her; While the bella-donna, so wickedly fair, Shorn of the purple flowers that crowned her, Is telling her Borgian beads in despair. See! by the fountain that softly bubbles, Spilling its rain in the lichened vase, Summer pauses!âher tender troubles Shadowing over her pensive face. The lizard stops on its brim to listen, The butterfly wavers dreamily near, And the dragon-flies in their green mail glisten, And watch her, as pausing she drops a tearâ Not as she stood in her August perfection! Not as she looked in the freshness of June! But gazing around with a tender dejection, And a weary face like the morning moon. The breeze through the leafy garden quivers, Dying away with a sigh and moan: A shade o'er the darkening fountain shivers, And Summer, ghost-like, hath vanished and gone. SYMBOLS. DEDICATED TO E. M. S. Still hearts, whose passions never stir, At times I envy your repose! Smooth lakes, where coyest wild-fowl whir, Ye feel no troublous ebbs and flows! Yet, tropic hearts, your fiercer play Of sun and storm, of noon and night, Is dearer than perpetual day In Arctic summer's glacial light. Great clouds, which bear upon your backs The sunshine, in your breasts the stormâ Alps of the air, whose pathless tracks Ye course with ever-changing form; By morning touched with aureole light; At sunset strandedâfiring far Your dull distress-gunsâor at night Raced through by many a startled starâ Ye are the types that Genius loves! So, moulded by an inward stress, A shade, a storm, it o'er us moves, A power to threaten or to bless. THE GARDEN OF ROSES. I walked in the garden of roses with thee, In the garden where never again we shall be, And thy ghost on the garden is all that I see,â But thou comest never. The light of the morning, the glory that threw O'er the roses and myrtles its mystical hue, Is gone, with the glory of Love that we knew, Forever and ever. No more in its shadows the nightingales trillâ The roses are ruinedâthe fountain is stillâ And the fountain that leaped on the heart with a thrill Is shattered forever. Alone in the garden I cry in my pain, âOh! bloom again, rosesâO Love, come againâ Come back, O beloved,â I cryâbut in vainâ Ah neverâno never. A terrible shadow across it is thrown, And I walk in that shadow, despairingâaloneâ In that shadow of death and of sorrow I groan âAh never!ââforever. SONG. Come, love! the sun has risen long, And hedge and tree Are all alive with tremulous song; Awake! and come with me. The grass is pearled with gleaming dew, The larks are thrilling in the sky, And all the world's awaiting youâ And Iâmy darlingâI! Look from above, that those dear eyes May dawn on me! My love, my life, my light, arise! That I the morning see. There 's ne'er a cloud to mar the day, The air is soft and fresh and sweet; But all the world is dull and gray Till thy dear face I greet. Sweetest of all that live and move, Arise! Arise! The day is short, too short for love, The swift hour fleets and flies. The moments ne'er will come again That heedlessly you waste, And joy deferred is half a pain. Then haste! my darling, haste! ART. DEDICATED TO G. H. Is this the stately shape I saw In Greece a thousand years ago; Who ruled the world by Beauty's law, And used among the gods to go? Who, wheresoe'er she turned her eyes, Below her saw a reverent throng; Whose praise was taken as a prize; Who made immortal with a song? Now, scant in garb, a mendicant, She stretches forth her prayerful palms, And wealth, in pity for her want, Contemptuous tosses her its alms. This gift is not for charity, But love, that at thy feet I lay. Oh, take my heart that throbs for thee, And smile as in the ancient day! TWO STARS. Look! love, into the sky, and say, When I am gone beyond the sea, What stars of all the many stars Shall shine for you and me. See! there above, in Charles's Wain, Those two, that close together shine, One bright and largeâthat shall be yoursâ The little faint one, mine. The little one, that has no praise From all who lookâthe satelliteâ I know not if it have a name, It shrinks so out of sight. ON THE DESERT. All around, To the bound Of the vast horizon's round, All sand, sand, sandâ All burning, glaring sandâ On my camel's hump I ride, As he sways from side to side, With an awkward step of pride, And his scraggy head uplifted, and his eye so long and bland. Naught is near, In the blear And simmering atmosphere, But the shadow on the sand, The shadow of the camel on the sand; All alone, as I ride, O'er the desert's ocean wide, It is ever at my side; It haunts me, it pursues me, if I flee, or if I stand. Not a sound, All around, Save the padded beat and bound Of the camel on the sand, Of the feet of the camel on the sand. Not a bird is in the air, Though the sun, with burning stare, Is prying everywhere, O'er the yellow thirsty desert, so desolately grand. Not a breath Stirs the death Of the desert,ânor a wreath Curls upward from the sand, From the waves of loose, fine sandâ And I doze, half asleep, Of the wild Sirocs that sweep O'er the caravans, and heap With a cloud of powdery, dusty death the terror-stricken band. Their groans And their moans Have departed,âbut their bones Are whitening on the sandâ Are blanching and grinning on the sand,â Oh, Allah! thou art great! Save me from such a fate, Nor through that fearful strait Lead me, thy basest servant, unto the Prophet-land. LOVE. When daffodils began to blow, And apple blossoms thick to snow Upon the brown and breaking mouldâ 'T was in the springâwe kissed and sighed And loved, and heaven and earth defied, We were so young and bold. The fluttering bob-link dropped his song, The first young swallow curved along, The daisy stared in sturdy pride, When loitering on we plucked the flowers, But dared not own those thoughts of ours, Which yet we could not hide. Tiptoe you bent the lilac spray And shook its rain of dew away And reached it to me with a smile: âSmell that, how full of spring it isââ 'T is now as full of memories As 't was of dew erewhile. Your hand I took, to help you down The broken wall, from stone to stone, Across the shallow bubbling brook. Ah! what a thrill went from that palm, That would not let my blood be calm, And through my pulses shook. Often our eyes met as we turned, And both our cheeks with passion burned, And both our hearts grew riotous, Till, as we sat beneath the grove, I kissed youâwhispering, âwe loveââ As thus I doâand thus. When passion had found utterance, Our frightened hearts began to glance Into the Future's every day; And how shall we our love conceal, Or dare our passion to revealâ âWe are too young,â they'll say. Alas! we are not now too young, Yet love to us hath safely clung, Despite of sorrow, years, and careâ But ah! we have not what we had, We cannot be so free, so glad, So foolish as we were. THE WALTZ. My arm is around your waist, love, Your hand is clasping mine, Your head leans over my shoulder, As around in the waltz we twine. I feel your quick heart throbbing, Your panting breath I breathe, And the odor rare of your hyacinth hair Comes faintly up from beneath. To the rhythmic beat of the music, In the floating ebb and flow Of the tense violin, and the lisping flute, And the burring bass we go. Whirling, whirling, whirling, In a rapture swift and sweet, To the pleading violoncello's tones, And the pulsing piano's beat. The world is alive with motion, The lights are whirling all, And the feet and brain are stirred by the strain Of the music's incessant call. Dance! dance! dance! it calls to us; And borne on the waves of sound, We circling swing, in a dizzy ring, With the whole world wheeling round. The jewels dance on your bosom, On your arms the bracelets dance, The swift blood speaks in your mantling cheeks, In your eyes is a dewy trance; Your white robes flutter around you, Nothing is calm or still, And the senses stir in the music's whirr With a swift electric thrill. We pause; and your waist releasing, We stand and breathe for a while; And, your face afire with a sweet desire, You look in my eyes and smile. We scarcely can speak for panting, But I lean to you, and say, Ah! who, my love, can resist you, You have waltzed my heart away. AT DIEPPE. The shivering column of the moonlight lies Upon the crumbling sea; Down the lone shore the flying curlew cries Half humanly. With hoarse, dull wash the backward dragging surge Its raucous pebbles rakes, Or swelling dark runs down with toppling verge, And flashing breaks. The light-house flares and darkens from the cliff, And stares with lurid eye Fiercely along the sea and shore as if Some foe to spy. What knowing thought, oh, ever moaning sea, Haunts thy perturbed breastâ What dark crime weighs upon thy memory And spoils thy rest? Thy soft swell lifts and swings the new-launched yacht With polished spars and deck, But crawls and grovels where the bare ribs rot Of the old wreck. Oh, treacherous courtier! thy deceitful lie To youth is gayly told, But in remorse I see thee cringingly Crouch to the old. THE VIOLET. Oh! faint delicious spring-time violet, Thine odor, like a key, Turns noiselessly in memory's wards to let A thought of sorrow free. The breath of distant fields upon my brow Blows through that open door The sound of wind-borne bells more sweet and low, And sadder than of yore. It comes afar from that beloved place, And that beloved hour, When Life hung ripening in Love's golden grace, Like grapes above a bower. A spring goes singing through its reedy grass, The lark sings o'er my head Drowned in the skyâoh pass, ye visions, pass! I would that I were dead;â Why hast thou opened that forbidden door From which I ever flee? O vanished Joy! O Love, that art no more, Let my vexed spirit be! O violet! thy odor through my brain Hath searched, and stung to grief This sunny day, as if a curse did stain Thy velvet leaf. THE ROSE. When Nature had shaped her rustic beauties,â The bright-eyed daisy, the violet sweet, The blushing poppy that nods and trembles In its scarlet hood among the wheat,â She paused and pondered;âand then she fashioned The scentless camellia proud and cold, The spicy carnation freaked with passion, The lily pale for an angel to hold. All were fair, yet something was wanting, Of freer perfection, of larger repose; And again she paused,âthen in one glad moment She breathed her whole soul into the rose. With you, dear Violet, Daisy, and Poppy, Pleasant it was in the fields to play, In careless and heartless joy of childhood, When an hour was as long as manhood's day. And with you, O passionate, bright Carnation, A boy's brief love for a time I knew, And you I admired, proud Lady Camellia, And, Lily, I sang in the church with you. But O my Rose, my frank, free-hearted, My perfect above all conscious arts, What were they beside thee, O Rose, my darling! To you I have given my heart of hearts. LOOKING DOWN. Afloat on the brim of a placid stream, Pleasant it is to lie and dream, With heaven above, and far below The deeps of deathâsad deeps that know The still reflections of earth and sky In their silent, serene obscurity. And hanging thus upon Life's thin rim, Death seems so sweet in that silvery, dim, Deep world below, that it seems half-best To sink into it and there find rest, Both, both together, ere age can come, And loving has lost its perfect bloom. One tilt, dear love, and we both might be Beyond earth's sorrows eternally. LOOKING UP. The winds are forever blowing, blowing, The streams are forever flowing, flowing, And all things forever going, going, Nothing on earth is at rest,â Ever departing, never abiding, Sliding away, and onward gliding, Alike the worst, the best. The sky is a glacier paved with snow, And heaped with many a crowded floe, And here and there a rift breaks through, Showing behind an abyss of blue,â A tender silence beyond, afar, Out of the tumult and rush, and far Of the winds that drive and rage below And beat on the mountain's crest,â And for all we hope, and more than we know, There, perchance, is rest. THE LOCUST. Voice of Summer, hidden from the eye In the sunny tree's green privacy, Fiery locustâshrill again, again! Drunk with sunshineâfree of work and care, Happy idler, while the world is fair, Sing to us from out thy leafy lair, Praise of idleness to soothe our pain. What is hotter than that voice of thine! Like a sunbeam stinging sharp and fine Through the inmost chambers of the brain; Burning with the noonday's sultry glare, Shining dust and glassy simmering air, Skies of brass, blear sands, and deserts bare, Is the fierce sirocco of thy strain. Though the blinds are shut and all the room Shrouded softly in a cool, half gloom, Thy shrill voice the burning out-world sings,â While the fig-tree scratches at the blind, And the shadow of the grape spray, twined Round the balcony, with every wind Moves across the casement as it swings. Ah! how sweet that dear Italian tune Thou art singing! In the burning noon Dreams the shepherd by the ruined tombâ On his staff he leansâthe while his sheep Round the wall's scant shadow nibbling creep, And the bearded goats rear up and peep Through the rifts and browse the poppy's bloom. In the fields the peasant feels the sun Beating more intolerably down While thou singest as he panting stands Breast high in the grain, or hid between Trellised vines that o'er their cany screen Topple, waving all their thick-leaved green, Plucking purple grapes with double hands. In the villa, checkered sun and shade Spot the broken moss-rough balustrade, And a silver network o'er the rail Flashes from the basin's quivering tides. Through the grass the sudden lizard slides Up the wall, and stands with tremulous sides, Gleaming in his green enamelled mail. Now the sun the wasp-stung nectarine rots, Freckles o'er the rusty apricots, And distends the grape's thin skin with wine; Now the glowing orange drops and breaksâ Apples strain their tight and shining cheeks, And the smooth, green, lazy melon takes Its siesta in the coiling vine. Childhood's voice is in thy fiery clirr, Olden summer memories thou canst stir, Golden visions we no more shall see: Thou canst bid the pictured past arise To the wanderer's heart, who dying lies, Far from home, and to his closing eyes Summon up its lost felicity. Yes! he treads again the garden ground Which his childish feet once pattered round; Where the clustering oleanders towerâ Where, while rocking on its flowery stalk, Bees he prisoned in the hollyhock, Listening to their buzz of angry talk, As they struggled in the crumpled flower. There the sunflower's shield of brown and gold, Flaming in the noonday gay and bold, Topples on its tall o'erburdened stem; There the currants hang their ruddy beads, There its flower-globes the hydrangea spreads, There the spicy pink its odor sheds From its painted petals' fringÃ¨d hem. And a little hand is in his own Whose warm pressure never more is known, Who was taken in her childish bloom; But those sunny curls still seem to float On the air the while he hears thy note, And her spirit wavers through his thought, Like a sunbeam in a darkened room. Voices full of wild and childish glee, Faces he again shall never see, Are around him while thy voice he hears. And the ticking watch ticks not so loud In that silent room that shutters shroud, And the cautious figure o'er him bowed Through his dying eyelids sees the tears. Chirp away, then, happy summer guest, Bringing unto every human breast Summer visions, early memories,â Trill thy gauzy wings, and let us hear Through the noon's intensest atmosphere Thy fine clarion sounding shrilly clear, Praise of summer idleness and ease. Castel Gandolfo, August, 1852. COMING INTO PORT. I have weathered the turbulent cape of storms Where the winds of passion blow; I have sheered by the reefs that gnash to foam The shallows they lurk below; I have joyed in the surge of the whistling sea, And the wild strong stress of the gale, As my brave barque quivered and leaped, alive, To the strain of its crowded sail. Then the masterful spirit was on me, And with Nature I wrestled glad; And Danger was like a passionate bride, And Love was itself half mad. Then Life was a storm that blew me on, And flew as the wild winds fly; And Hope was a pennon streaming out High upâto play with the sky. Oh the golden days, the glorious days That so lavish of life we spent! Oh the dreaming nights with the silent stars 'Neath the sky's mysterious tent! Oh the light, light heart and the strong desire And the pulse's quickening thrill, When Joy lived with us, and Beauty smiled, And Youth had its free, full will! The whole wide world was before us then, And never our spirits failed, And we never looked back, but onward, onward Into the Future we sailed. Ever before us the far horizon Whose dim and exquisite line Alone divided our Earth from Heaven, Our Life from a Life divine. Now my voyage is well nigh over, And my staunchest spars are gone; And my sails are rent, and my barnacled barque Drags slowly and heavily on. The faint breeze comes from the distant shore With its odors dim and sweet, And soon in the silent harbor of peace Long-parted friends I shall greet. The voyage is well nigh over, Though at times a capful of wind Will rattle the ropes and fill the sails, And furrow a wake behind. But the sea has become a weariness, And glad into port I shall come With my sails all furled, and my anchor dropped, And my cargo carried home. THE END OF THE BANQUET. Farewell, my friends!âI hear the call I cannot but obey;â Farewell! for I must leave you all, Had I the wish to stay. And yetâforgive meâI rejoice, For I am old and tired;â Worn by the talk, the lights, the noise, And all I once desired. After a time life's very best Begins to stale and pall: I go to silence and to rest, And soâFarewell to all! SONNETS. LITTLE WE KNOW WHAT SECRET INFLUENCE. Little we know what secret influence A word, a glance, a casual tone may bring, That, like the wind's breath on a chorded string, May thrill the memory, touch the inner sense, And waken dreams that come we know not whence; Or like the light touch of a bird's swift wing, The lake's still face a moment visiting, Leave pulsing rings, when he has vanished thence. You looked into my eyes an instant's space, And all the boundaries of time and place Broke down, and far into a world beyond Of buried hopes and dreams my soul had sight, Where dim desires long lost, and memories fond, Rose in a soft mirage of tender light. GLAD IS THE SUNSHINE. Glad is the sunshine, perfect is the day, A pearl of days; a flawless chrysolite The sky above us lifts its dome of light, And loitering clouds along its blue fields stray, Unshepherded by winds that far away Are sleeping in their caves. This pure delight, This silent, peaceful gladness infinite, Is troubled by no sorrow, no dismay. Yes, for o'er all the shadow of a fear Is brooding, that the restless spirit knows, The doubting human spirit that forecasts, Even in the brightest that surrounds us here, The inevitable change,âfor naught life knows Is fixed and permanent, naught lives that lasts. THE MIGHTY MAKERS. I. Whose are those forms august that, in the press And busy blames and praises of to-day, Stand so serene above life's fierce affray With ever youthful strength and loveliness? Those are the mighty makers, whom no stress Of time can shame, nor fashion sweep away, Whom art begot on nature in the play Of healthy passion, scorning base excess. Rising perchance in mists, and half obscure When up the horizon of their age they came, Brighter with years they shine in steadier light, Great constellations that will aye endure, Though myriad meteors of ephemeral fame Across them flash, to vanish into night. II. Such was our Chaucer in the early prime Of English verse, who held to Nature's hand And walked serenely through its morning land, Gladsome and hale, brushing its dewy rime. And such was Shakespeare, whose strong soul could climb Steeps of sheer terror, sound the ocean grand Of passion's deeps, or over Fancy's strand Trip with his fairies, keeping step and time. His, too, the power to laugh out full and clear, With unembittered joyance, and to move Along the silent, shadowy paths of love As tenderly as Dante, whose austere, Stern spirit through the worlds below, above, Unsmiling strode, to tell their tidings here. EUROPA. A PICTURE BY PAUL VERONESE. Zephyr is wandering here with gentle sound The first fresh fragrance of the spring to seek; The milk-white steer, whose budding horns are crowned With flowery garlands, kneeling on the ground Receives his burden fair, and turns his sleek Mild head around, her sandalled foot to lick; Luxuriant, joyous, fresh, with roses bound About her sunny head, and on her cheek The glow of morn, Europa mounts the steer. One handmaid clasps her girdle, and one calls The hovering loves to bring their garlands near. From her full breast the loosened drapery falls, As borne by Love o'er slope and lea she goes, Glad with exuberant lifeâfresh as a new-blown rose. GIOTTO'S CHAPEL. PADUA. How sweet the mild retirement of this spot! This area, where the gladiator bled, With turf and flowers is softly carpeted; These girdling walls where later knighthood fought Now draped with ivy stand, remembering not Their scenes of former life. But here, instead, The artist's steps in pilgrimage are led To seek the shrine by Giotto's genius wrought. Here, dedicate to art and piety, His simple chapel stands; and painted here Upon its walls a pictured life I see, Inspired by feeling, earnest and sincere. What faith, what simple dignity and grace Art since hath lost, are in this cloistered place! IT WOULD NOT SEEM TO ME ONE HALF SO STRANGE. It would not seem to me one half so strange To see the door with one burst open wide, And feel you once more bounding to my side All full of Life and Joy, as seems this change That hath upborne you from the senses' range And left a blank that cannot be supplied, And wreck and ruin where were joy and pride And hope and love's perpetual interchange. I crave to see you, hear you once again, And nature has no more the charm to cheer; The sunshine hurts me with a secret pain I never knew when you were with us here. Dear spirit! we are wretched and alone, But yet I pray you cannot hear our moan. Albano, April 3, 1854. TIMON. [I. What were we made for? If to struggle here] What were we made for? If to struggle here, To strive, to suffer, train each faculty With many a pain, and then at last to die With naught beyond, no fuller, larger sphere Of onward going unto knowledge clear,â How vain seems Lifeâbetwixt a smile and sigh Across Time's section of Infinity Flitting a moment, but to disappear. It cannot be that the Almighty Power Without our asking makes us thus the prey Of pain, disease, death; for one little hour To beat like some poor fly against the pane Through which he sees the open, boundless day Of perfect promise,âand but beats in vain. [II. We are pursued by Fate; nothing on earth] We are pursued by Fate; nothing on earth Flowers into satisfaction; on the skirt Of all temptation, hidden yet alert, Hangs disappointment ready to spring forth And jar with discord the clear song of mirth; Even our best pleasure has the sting of hurt, And prayers and tears are futile to avert The Nemesis that haunts us from our birth. Oh! what avail our struggles, who are caught In Fate's inextricable web! In vain Through the dark future our exhausted thought Seeks for a resting place secure from pain; Our Present crumbles 'neath us while we laugh, Our Past has but a sigh for epitaph. III. High as man's hopes may fly, he ever falls High as man's hopes may fly, he ever falls On his own shadow when on earth he alights. Joy's exaltation, Love's upspringing flights, Lift us in air but for brief intervals. We are Earth's children, we are Nature's thralls, Whom Discontent pursues, and black Care spites, And Fancy lures, and Disappointment blights, And Fortune drives about like random balls. Nothing is good to usâsuch fools are weâ But what is lost or promised. Naught we know So sweet as that dear song of âLong ago,â So glad as that wild dream of âYet to be.â Will death unite the Future with the Past, And clasp perfected Hope in Memory's arms at last? AFTER LONG DAYS OF DULL PERPETUAL RAIN. After long days of dull perpetual rain, And from gray skies, the sun at last shines bright, And all the sparkling trees are glad with light, And all the happy world laughs out again; The sorrow is forgotten, past the pain; For nature has no memory, feels the blight Of no regret, nor mars the day's delight With idle fears and hopes and longings vain. Ah me! it is not so with us; the ghost Of vanished joys pursues us everywhere; We live as much in all that we have lost As what we own; no present is so fair That the best moment's sunlight is not crossed By shadowy shapes of hope, and fear, and care. SCHERZI. SINGING AT TWILIGHT. You sang the olden songs, and, sadly dreaming, I lay and listened, while you thought I slept; And if the tears were from my eyelids streaming, You saw them not, and so I freely wept. Round us the silent, shadowy night was stealing; You were a voice alone within the dark; And from life's hardened crust a tender feeling Broke, like a blossom, through the rugged bark. You were again a young and blushing maiden, Who leaned upon my breast and breathed your love, And I, no more with disappointments laden, Seemed, as of yore, beside you in the grove. The sky above us was serenely tender, The moon shone softly gleaming through the trees; Clasped heart to heart in Love's complete surrender, Life seemed an island in enchanted seas. Dim longings, vague desires, like breaths from heaven, Thrilled all our being with a strange unrest; And all the finest strings that God hath given Trembled to voiceless music in the breast. Your hand's electric fire again ran through me, I breathed the hyacinth odor of your hair; Your soul in long sweet kisses clung unto me, And filled me with a rapturous despair. Your voice had ceased; yet still around me fluttered The visions that your songs had raised in me; WhenââMr. Jones,â cried JeamesââCurse Jones,â I muttered, And youââBring in the lights; 't is time for tea.â I was again an old hard-hearted sinner, And you were fifty, and you wore a cap; Laughing, you said to Jones, âAfter his dinner, You see, the old man likes to take his nap.â UN BACIO DATO NON Ã MAI PERDUTO. Because we once drove together In the moonlight over the snow, With the sharp bells ringing their tinkling chime, So many a year ago, So, now, as I hear them jingle, The winter comes back again, Though the summer stirs in the heavy trees, And the wild rose scents the lane. We gather our furs around us, Our faces the keen air stings, And noiseless we fly o'er the snow-hushed world Almost as if we had wings. Enough is the joy of mere living, Enough is the blood's quick thrill; We are simply happy, I care not why, We are happy beyond our will. The trees are with icicles jewelled, The walls are o'er-surfed with snow; The houses with marble whiteness are roofed, In their windows the home-lights glow. Through the tense, clear sky above us The keen stars flash and gleam, And wrapped in their silent shroud of snow The broad fields lie and dream. And jingling with low, sweet clashing Ring the bells as our good horse goes, And tossing his head, from his nostrils red His frosty breath he blows. And closely you nestle against me, While around your waist my arm I have slippedâ't is so bitter, bitter coldâ It is only to keep us warm. We talk, and then we are silent; And suddenlyâyou know whyâ I stoopedâcould I help it? You lifted your faceâ We kissedâthere was nobody nigh. And no one was ever the wiser, And no one was ever the worse; The skies did not fall,âas perhaps they ought,â And we heard no paternal curse. I never told itâdid you, dear?â From that day unto this; But my memory keeps in its inmost recess, Like a perfume, that innocent kiss. I dare say you have forgotten, 'T was so many a year ago; Or you may not choose to remember it, Time may have changed you so. The world so chills us and kills us, Perhaps you may scorn to recall That night, with its innocent impulse,â Perhaps you'll deny it all. But if of that fresh, sweet nature The veriest vestige survive, You remember that moment's madness,â You remember that moonlight drive. PERSICA. O Persica, Persica, pale and fair, With a ripe blush on your cheek, How prettyâhow very pretty you are, Until you begin to speak! As for a heart and soul, my dear, You have not enough to sin; Outside so fair, like a peach you are, With a stone for a heart within. A MUSICAL BOX. I know her, the thing of laces, and silk, And ribbons, and gauzes, and crinoline, With her neck and shoulders as white as milk, And her doll-like face and conscious mien. A lay figure fashioned to fit a dress, All stuffed within with straw and bran; Is that a woman to love, to caress? Is that a creature to charm a man? Only listen! how charmingly she talks Of your dress and hersâof the Paris modeâ Of the coming ballâof the opera-boxâ Of jupons, and flounces, and fashions abroad. Not a bonnet in church but she knows it well, And Fashion she worships with downcast eyes; A marchande de modes is her oracle, And Paris her earthly paradise. She 's perfect to whirl with in a waltz; And her shoulders show well on a soft divan, As she lounges at night and spreads her silks, And plays with her bracelets and flirts her fan; With a little laugh at whatever you say, And rounding her âNoâ with a look of surprise, And lisping her âYes,â with an air distrait, And a pair of aimless, wandering eyes. Her duty this Christian never omits! She makes her calls, and she leaves her cards, And enchants a circle of half-fledged wits, And slim attachÃ©s and six-foot Guards. Her talk is of people who 're nasty or nice, And she likes little bon-bons of compliments; While she seasons their sweetness, by way of spice, With some witless scandal she often invents. Is this the thing for a mother or wife? Could love ever grow on such barren rocks? Is this a companion to take for a wife? One might as well marry a musical box. You exhaust in a day her full extent; 'T is the same little tinkle of tunes always; You must wind her up with a compliment, To be bored with the only airs she plays. ON THE SURFACE. From early light to late at night, I chatter, chatter, chatter, If things are sad or things are bad, Dear me! what does it matter? The livelong day to me is gay, And I keep always laughing; The world at best is such a jest, 'T is only fit for chaffing. Along the brim of life to skim, Not in its depths be sinking, With jest and smile time to beguile, Not bore one's self with thinking. To touch and go, and to and fro, To gossip, talk, and tattle, To hear the news, and to amuse One's world with endless prattle,â This is my life: I hate all strife, With none I am a snarler; I like to joke with pleasant folk In any pleasant parlor. And when the day has slipped away, Ere I blow out my candle, I sit awhile, and muse and smile, O'er that last bit of scandal. ROSA HESTERNA. Yes, my love, it was fresh and glowing, Blooming and beautiful,âyesterday! Now its odor is sickly, its petals are going, Its beauty is vanishedâthrow it away! Pray, don't thrust it under my nose! Who can endure a yesterday's rose? I cannot deny your pretty sayingsâ âIt gave its life, and died in your hand,â And âThere are no deaths without decayings;ââ But the dying of roses who can stand? The sweeter the odor the worse the decay; And a yesterday's rose!âoh, throw it away! Gratitude,âpity,âsense of duty? Oh, my dear, don't talk such prose! If duty don't rhyme, as you say, to beauty, Does yesterday's odor haunt yesterday's rose? To-morrow, perhaps, I shall throw you away! Perhaps, to-morrow, but not to-day. Now, while your lips are fresh as roses, Kiss me, for preaching becomes you not! Time for his wisdom his penance imposes; When things are ripe they begin to rot. And our loves and our roses, when they decay, However we sigh, must be thrown away. O FILIA PULCHRA! How your sweet face revives again The dear old time, my Pearl,â If I may use the pretty name I called you when a girl. You are so young; while Time of me Has made a cruel prey, It has forgotten you, nor swept One grace of youth away. The same sweet face, the same sweet smile, The same lithe figure, too!â What did you say? âIt was perchance Your mother that I knew?â Ah, yes, of course, it must have been, And yet the same you seem, And for a moment, all these years Fled from me like a dream. Then what your mother would not give, Permit me, dear, to take, The old man's privilegeâa kissâ Just for your mother's sake. SNOWDROP. When, full of warm and eager love, I clasp you in my fond embrace, You gently push me back and say, âTake care, my dear, you'll spoil my lace.â You kiss me just as you would kiss Some woman friend you chanced to see; You call me âdearest.â All love's forms Are yours, not its reality. Oh Annie! cry, and storm, and rave! Do anything with passion in it! Hate me an hour, and then turn round And love me truly, just one minute. LOVE AND PRUDENCE. Do you remember that most perfect night, In the full flush of June, When the wide heavens were tranced in silver light Of the sad patient moon? Silent we sat, awed by a strange unrest; The fathomless, far sky Our very life absorbed, our thoughts oppressed, By its immensity. Lost in that infinite vast, how idle seemed The best of human speech, Earth scarcely breathed, so silently she dreamed, Save when from some far reach The faint wind sighed, and stirred the slumbering trees, And shadowy stretch and plain Seemed haunted by unuttered mysteries Night on its life had lain. We knew not what we were, or where we went, Borne by some unseen power, Nor in what dream-shaped realms our spirits spent That long, yet brief half hour; I only know that, as a star from high Slides down the ether thin We shot to earth, roused by a startling cry, âYou 're getting coldâcome in.â THE TWO MUSES. My fire burnt lowâat intervals Struggling for life, it flared and sank, And shapeless shadows on the walls Towered upâand into corners shrank. The black brand crackled, bent, and brok And through the soot the eager spark Worried, like busy worldly folk, And burrowing, died in dirt and dark In the dead silence, loud the clock Remorseless ticked each second's flightâ Heart-beats of time, with quiet shock Driving Life on to Death and Night. Well! let Life go!âmy weary heart Is sick of things that only seem; Love is a sham, and so is Art, And Faith the ghost of Hope's vain dream. A curse is on this world of ours, Where Faith, Love, Art, are all a lie; Beneath the curse the spirit cowers, And their best gifts the Gods deny. As thus I mused in desperate mood, I raised my eyes, and faintly seen In the dim light a figure stood, With prayerful face and vesture mean. Her eyes were shy with half-alarm; Wan were her cheeks, and pale her hue; And o'er her breast her white bared arm With modest grace her drapery drew. âWho art thou? and what dost thou here? Speak! Can I help thee?â Then, âAlas!â She said, âhow own the name I bearâ So fallen, so changed from what I was. âOnce in the far and golden time, When Freedom wore its fairest hues, When glorious Greece was in its prime, They called me by the name of Muse. âMy feet from worldly soil were free; The Furies lent to me their rods. My praise was Immortality; My homeâthe temple of the Gods. âAll for my favors sought. To none I gave them but the true and tried,â Heroic, godlike men alone, Whose life by Faith was purified. âNow in the public mart my strings For very want I fain must strum, And hide beneath a shawl my wings, And sing, when I were better dumb, âMust smile to hide my heart's despair, Must starve, or cringe to greed and lust; Of all who hearâah! how rare The few whom I can love and trust. âThe many mock my decent dress; Their thoughts are low, their works are base; They shock me with their vile caress, Until, ashamed, I hide my face. âFallen so low, I stretch to thee My hands, and cry, Oh! is there none To lift me, save me, honor me, As once in Greece in ages gone? âNo one, of all this venial throng That take my name upon their lips, To shield me from the shame and wrong That shadow me in such eclipse? âNo one above this sordid mart, With godlike spirit shrined in man, Who with pure soul will worship Art, Not woo her like a courtesanâ âNot pandering to the world's low taste, With skill to tempt and to degradeâ Not like a broker, greed-debased, Who makes of Art a vulgar trade?â âYesâone at least, though weak and poor,â I cried. âI pledge this heart of mine, Content to labor, wait, endure, To win at last one smile of thine.â What sudden change! an aureole globed That radiant faceâa Grecian dress, With pale and perfect draperies, robed Her pure and stately loveliness. Serene she smiled, and at her feet Prostrate I fell, and bowed my head; And silence came as calm and sweet As silence to the peaceful dead. Then, suddenly, a laugh pierced through My earsâI raised my eyesâthe Muse Had vanished; in her stead a new Strange figure stood, in high-heeled shoes. A creature like a Biscuit rare, Painted and dyed, hair, eyes and faceâ Tight-lacedâher back and bosom bareâ All chiffons, jewels, silk, and lace. With head thrown back and glance askant, She laughed and leered and beckoned me; âGreat God!â I cried, âwhat dost thou want? And who art thou?âand where is she?â âShe? Who? My queer old sister? Oh! Dear solemn prude, pray who can tell? Gone back to Greece, I hope. You know That here she 's quite impossible. âPoor thing, I pity her; but then She 's such a prigâso tiresome, too, And dresses soâand bores the men About the Beautiful and Trueâ âSuch silly rubbishâevery word Emphatic with a capital, That really it is quite absurd; We had to cut her, one and all. âShe had a grand career awhile In Athens once, when she was young; But here, we 've changed in taste and style,â And she 's old, nervous, and unstrung. âAnd now that we have shut her out, Dressed in that old disgraceful shawl, She wanders begging all about And preachingâwhich won't do at all. âAnd so take careâyou 're young, mon cher, And just beginning in your art; Don't be imposed upon by her, But trust me if you want a start. âI'm all the modeâher sails are furled. Come down to me and have a chat; I'll introduce you to the world, And put you up to this and that. âI 've lots of things to show you, too, Not Greekâthat wretched classic Greekâ But Biscuit, SÃ¨vres, Ormolu, And bric-Ã -brac, and statues chic. âWe 're all so freeâno prudish gÃ¨ne. Such fun, you know; and there you'll meet Dukes, Bankers, Princesâall the men And all the demi-monde Ã©liteâ âAll purchasers. Such singing tooâ ThÃ©rÃ¨se's style. Do all you can, Broad as her songs are, they 're so true You have to laughâbehind your fan. âAnd then my picturesâall so bright With brilliant colors; some so small You need a lens to help your sight, And wonder how they 're done at all. âSuch costumes gayâsuch fights and feudsâ Such vases, silks, stuffs, furnitureâ Such harems, baths, boudoirsâsuch nudes, Smiling at you with such allure! âYou 're poor! I know you can't be flush: Don't be so shyâoh, don't say âNo!â Pray take itâwon't you? Pooh!âdon't blush: Ah, well!âat first you all say so!â With that she finger-tipped a kiss, Laughed, pirouetted on her toe, Kicked out her train, and, with a hiss Of rustling silks, turned round to go. âNow don't forgetâdon't be a fool; I count upon you! Well,âbye bye! Sundays, you knowâcards, dancing, pool, And everything that 's chic and sly! âStop! here 's my cardâI 'd quite forgot!â With that she vanished; and I read âMadame La MuseânÃ©e La Cocotte, Rue de Parnasseââand went to bed! COUPLETS. [I. To each his separate work; the ox to drag the plough] To each his separate work; the ox to drag the plough, The bird to sing his song upon the blossomy bough. I do not ask the grain and hay your acres yield, If I may pluck the flower you trample in your field. How perfect nature is! the sun, and cloud, and rain Give me a little song, and ripen all your grain. II. SHAKESPEARE. Our nearness value lends to trivial things and slight, But only distance gives to lofty ones their height. The Pyramids, to those beneath them, look not high, But as we go from them they tower into the sky. So thy colossal mind, in time's perspective seen, Still rises up and up with more majestic mien. [III. Strive not to say the whole! the Poet, in his Art] Strive not to say the whole! the Poet, in his Art, Must intimate the whole, and say the smallest part. The young moon's silver are her perfect circle tells, The limitless within Art's bounded outline dwells. Of every noble work the silent part is best, Of all expression, that which cannot be expressed. Each act contains the Life, each work of Art the world, And all the planet laws are in each dew-drop pearled. Of single stones is built the temple's Grecian state, Yet should the poet not its stones enumerate. The lizard gliding o'er the Pyramid's huge cone Knows not the Pyramids, but only every stone. Subservient to the form all details must be brought, All images be slaves to one despotic thought. [IV. We of our age are part, and every thrill that wakes] We of our age are part, and every thrill that wakes The tremulous air of Life its motion in us makes. The imitative mass mere empty echo give, As walls and rocks return the sound that they receive. But as the bell, that high in some cathedral swings, Stirred by whatever thrill, with its own music rings, So finer souls give forth, to each vibrating tone Impinging on their life, a music of their own. [V. All Arts are one, howe'er distributed they stand] All Arts are one, howe'er distributed they stand; Verse, tone, shape, color, form, are fingers on one hand. [VI. Lift thou thyself above the accidents of life] Lift thou thyself above the accidents of life, With pain and joy alike be friends, abjuring strife. If in thy growing fields the tempest beat thy grain, See! it hath blown disease from off the stagnant plain. If Friendship seize the sword, bare thou thy breast and wait; Love conquers Love, but Hate hath never conquered Hate. Patient the wounded earth receives the plough's sharp share, And hastes the sweet return of golden grain to bear. The sea remembers not the vessel's rending keel, But rushes joyously the ravage to conceal. So, patient under scorn and injury abide,â Who conquereth all within may dare the world outside. [VII. Yes, thrift is very good. Respect to men of thrift] Yes, thrift is very good. Respect to men of thrift! They stick to solid facts, and let the dreamer drift. The earth their mother is, their heart unto her clings, And since they live with her why should they covet wings? They find in common life a present task to do, The distant and the dim let idle poets woo. Yet out of earth alone was no man ever made. The imagination gives the very soul to Trade. The merchant schemes and dreams, with magic numbers plays, On speculation's wings he threads through fortune's maze. Across the pathless deep his ships like shuttles fly, And weave together lands by needs and luxury. With astrologic faith he on the stars relies, And ventures all his wealth to shifting winds and skies. He trusts a needle's point, a few weak planks and chart, To bring an Eastern spice into a Western mart. What faith in things unseen! Hath any poet's dreams More fancy than your plain and sober merchant's schemes? [VIII. Live not without a friend! The Alpine rock must own] Live not without a friend! The Alpine rock must own Its mossy grace, or else be nothing but a stone. Live not without a God! however low or high, In every house should be a window to the sky. [IX. While we are young our youth too near for Art doth lie] While we are young our youth too near for Art doth lieâ Our life a poem is, but for another's eye. Youth by projection knows how glorious manhood is, And manhood feels youth's charm by golden memories. Not in the present we the present charm can feel, But Memory and Hope have Beauty's wondrous seal. Time smelts the dross away and leaves the ore alone, And in a magic ring it sets life's opal stone. [X. That dress of thine is made of many lives; I see] That dress of thine is made of many lives; I see Upon thy coral there the diver's misery. Thy shawl is red with blood, for that the camel bled; The seamstress sewed her pain into thy lace's thread. The tortured worm gave up his tomb thy silk to make, The oyster bore his pearl of trouble for thy sake. The frolic kid was flayed thy snowy hands to hide, A thousand cochineals to paint thy ribbon died. Thou wouldst not crush a worm, so gentle is thy heart, And yet, behold! how strange a paradox thou art. [XI. The conscious Intellect the servant is of Art] The conscious Intellect the servant is of Art, The unconscious Phantasy performs the master's part. Despite the helm and sail the vessel will not go, Howe'er we strive, until the breath of heaven shall blow. Love is the only key of knowledge, as of Art, Nothing is truly ours but what we learn by heart. [XII. An inward faith alone can make our life sincere] An inward faith alone can make our life sincere, And into Art that life transmuted should appear. Not of a trick or lie those fairest shapes are born, That seem like human souls that godlike forms have worn. The Greek in nature saw his gods half-hidden lurk, And copying nature, wrought his gods into his work. [XIII. Nature in circles moves round fixed and central laws] Nature in circles moves round fixed and central laws; The spirit's spiral path a moving centre draws. The seed results the tree, the tree results the seed, Its ultimated fruit but to its root doth lead. But thought strives ever up, beyond itself aspires, New forms and higher powers are born of its desires. Rest absolute is death; rest relative alone To Nature must belong; the soul must on and on. What askest thou of Death, but that the senses' door It shall unlock and let the spirit upward soar? Soar on and up, its God projecting as it goes, Expanding into love, and joy, and peaceâbut not repose. In utter rest the soul could never fitly dwell, Debarred from upward growth, e'en Paradise were hell. [XIV. We are but what we think, and must immortal be] We are but what we think, and must immortal be, Else whence hath come the thought of immortality? The limits of its sphere can nothing e'er transcend, And thought, roam where it will, can never find its end. Around the soul one thought of nebulous glory clings, As Saturn is ensphered within its luminous rings. This pours upon our life its pure and lambent light, And brings its fullest joy when sorrow brings the night. [XV. The East for sweet luxurious ease and rest] The East for sweet luxurious ease and restâ For toil, and pain, and struggle is the West. The calm siesta, pipe, and soft divan With mild sensations, are for Eastern man. The fierce debate, the strife for place and power, The brain and nerve life, is our Western dower. With all our rush and toil we scarcely move, And lose the truest joy of livingâlove! [XVI. The Imperfect hath a charm the Perfect cannot own] The Imperfect hath a charm the Perfect cannot own; From satisfaction Hope ungirds her flashing zone. No perfect, Nature shapes; she only hints in each, And tantalizes with her partly finished speech.</field>
