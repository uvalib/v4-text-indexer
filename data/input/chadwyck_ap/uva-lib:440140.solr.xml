      <field name="fulltext">âThe fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peaceâ THE CALL. âThe laborers are forth; why tarriest here? Their song is heard afar while thou dost dream.â O thou who to thy children still art near, From thee upon my soul the call doth gleam! I must no longer muse beside the stream, No longer in green-shadowed byways lurk, But rise and go forth girded for my work,â To sow beside the waters garnered seeds Of thought that shall bear fruit of noble act, And feeling that shall flower in beauteous deeds. Do thou supply all that my soul hath lacked, Do thou supply all that my soul still needs,â The strength of will, the power to be and do All I have dreamed of fair and good and true! 1846. HYMNS. HYMN FOR THE ORDINATION OF EDWARD EVERETT HALE. O God! Thy children gathered here, Thy blessing now await; Thy servant, girded for his work, Stands at the temple-gate. A holy purpose in his heart Has deepened calm and still; Now from his childhood's Nazareth He comes, to do thy will. O Father! keep his soul alive To every hope of good; And may his life of love proclaim Man's truest brotherhood! O Father! keep his spirit quick To every form of wrong; And in the ear of sin and self May his rebuke be strong! O give him in thy holy work Patience to wait thy time, And, while he toils with man, to breathe The soul's serener clime! And grant him many hearts to lead Into thy perfect rest; Bless thou him, Father, and his flock; Bless! and they shall be blest! 1846. HYMN OF BAPTISM. When from the Jordan's gleaming wave Came forth the sinless one, A voice athwart the heavens flashed, âLo, my beloved son!â The Baptist, gazing on his face With the soul's radiance bright, Beheld upon his sacred head A snow-white dove alight. Now, with baptismal waters touched, Thy children, Father, see; While heart and soul, and mind and strength, They consecrate to thee. Send down on them thy holy dove, Thy spirit undefiled; Be each in purity and faith Thy well-beloved child! O help them in the wilderness, To conquer doubt and sin, To see above them still thy Peace And hear thy voice within! 1848. THE NEW COMMANDMENT. Beneath the shadow of the cross, As earthly hopes remove, His ânew commandmentâ Jesus gives,â His blessed law of love. O bond of union strong and deep! O bond of perfect peace! Not even the lifted cross can harm, If we but hold to this. Then, Jesus, be thy spirit ours; And swift our feet shall move To deeds of pure self-sacrifice, And âthe sweet tasks of love.â 1848. FAITH, HOPE, AND LOVE. Supreme disposer of the heart! Thou, since the world was made, Hast the best fruits of holiness To holy hearts displayed. Here, hope and faith their links unite With love in one sweet chain; But when all fleeting things are past, Love shall alone remain. O love! O true and fadeless light! And shall it ever be, That after all our toils and tears Thy Sabbath we shall see? 'Mid thousand fears and dangers now We sow our seed, with prayer, But know that joyful hands shall reap The shining harvests there. O God of justice, God of power! Our faith and hope increase, And crown them, in the future years, With endless love and peace. Breviary, 1848. HYMN FOR THE DEDICATION OF THE NEW CHAPEL OF THE FIRST PARISH, HAVERHILL. O God! a temple to thy name Our hands have builded fair And now we dedicate to thee This lowly House of Prayer. And Father, though thou dwellest not In temples made with hands, But in the pure and holy heart That doth thy pure commands, Yet dwell thou here! for here, we trust, Shall hearts which thou wilt love Bring unto thee the offering, Which thou dost most approve. Here be thy word of Love and Power Proclaimed from lips sincere, And every hope which blesses man Find warmest welcome here. Here meet in Love thy sin-stained child And bid his wanderings cease And on the weary, laden heart Send thine untroubled Peace. 1848. THE WORD. In the beginning was the Word. Athwart the primal night It flashed with quick, creative power, And on the earth was light. In the beginning was the Word. God's utterance of might Upon man's waiting spirit flashed, And in the soul was light. O Word that broke the stillness first, Sound on, and never cease Till all earth's darkness be made light, And all her discord peace. Sound in thy servants' willing hearts Till all their depths be stirred; Speak from their pure, untrembling lips, O ever-living Word! LAW AND LOVE. O thou in whom we live and move, Whose love is law, whose law is love, Whose present spirit waits to fill The soul that comes to do thy will! Unto our waiting spirits teach Thy love beyond the power of speech, And bid us feel with joyful awe The omnipresence of thy law. That law doth give to truth and right, Howe'er despised, a conquering might, And makes each fondly cherished lie And boasting wrong to cower and die. Its patient working doth fulfill Man's hope and God's all-perfect will, Nor suffers one true word or thought Or deed of love to come to naught. Such faith, O God! our souls sustain Free, true, and calm, in joy and pain, That even by our fidelity Thy kingdom may the nearer be! âWATCHMAN, WHAT OF THE NIGHT?â WRITTEN FOR THE TWENTY-FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE AMERICAN ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY. A quarter of the circling sphere Has rounded onward to the light; We see not yet the daylight clear, But we can see the paling night. And Hope that aye relumes her fires, And Faith that shines with steadfast ray, And Love that courage reinspires, As morning stars, lead on the day. O sentinels, whose tread we heard Through long hours when we could not see, Pause now; exchange with cheer the word, The unchanging watchword, Liberty! Look backward; how much has been won! Look round; how much is yet to win! The watches of the night are done; The watches of the day begin. O Thou whose mighty patience holds The night and day alike in view, Thy will our dearest hopes enfolds, Oh, keep us steadfast, patient, true! 1856. VESPER HYMNS. I. TO AN AIR HEARD IN S. TRINITÃ DE MONTI IN ROME. Hear us, Heavenly Father, hear us! Give to us thy perfect peace. Thou whose love unsleeping Watch is ever keeping, Shades of evening gather, Thou, our heavenly Father, Holy and Merciful, Hear our evening prayer! When life's glooms o'ertake us Thou wilt not forsake us; When life's shadows darken Thou our cry wilt hearken; Holy and Merciful! Thou wilt hear our prayer: Give us thy peace, O God, Keep us in thy perfect peace! [II. Soft as fades the sunset splendor] Soft as fades the sunset splendor And the light of day grows dim, We to God our praises render, Sing we thus our vesper hymn,â Jubilate, Amen! Father, gracious, loving, tender, Oh, accept the grateful strain! Day by day comes rich in blessing, Night by night brings holy calm; Lord, to thee our praise addressing, Rises thus our joyful psalm,â Jubilate, Amen! But, unworthiness confessing, Into silence fades again. [III. Now on land and sea descending] Now on land and sea descending, Brings the night its peace profound, And our evening hymn is blending With the holy calm around. Soon as dies the sunset glory Stars of heaven shine out above, Telling still the ancient story,â Their Creator's changeless love. Now, our wants and burdens leaving To his care who cares for all, Cease we fearing, cease we grieving; At his touch our burdens fall. As the darkness deepens o'er us, Lo! eternal stars arise; Hope and faith and love rise glorious Shining in the spirit's skies. [IV. Again as evening's shadow falls] Again as evening's shadow falls, We gather in these hallowed walls, And vesper hymn and vesper prayer Rise mingling on the holy air. The struggling heart that seeks release Here finds the rest of God's own peace, And strengthened here by hymn and prayer, Lays down the burden and the care. O God, our Light, to thee we bow! Within all shadows standest thou: Give deeper calm than night can bring, Give sweeter songs than lips can sing! Life's tumult we must meet again, We cannot at the shrine remain; But in the spirit's secret cell May hymn and prayer forever dwell! 1859. âGO FORTH TO LIFE.â Go forth to life, O child of earth, Remembering still thy heavenly birth, Thou art not here for ease or sin, But manhood's noble crown to win. Though passion's fires be in thy soul, Thy spirit can their flames control; Though tempters should beset thy way, Thy spirit is more strong than they. Go on from innocence of youth To manly pureness, manly truth; God's angels still are near to save, And God himself doth help the brave. Then forth to life, O child of earth! Be worthy of thy heavenly birth! For noble service thou art here; Thy brothers help, thy God revere! 1859. HYMN OF WINTER. 'T is Winter now; the fallen snow Has left the heavens all coldly clear; Through leafless boughs the sharp winds blow, And all the earth lies dead and drear. And yet God's love is not withdrawn; His life within the keen air breathes, His beauty paints the crimson dawn, And clothes the boughs with glitt'ring wreaths. And though abroad the sharp winds blow, And skies are chill, and frosts are keen, Home closer draws her circle now, And warmer glows her light within. O God! who giv'st the winter's cold As well as summer's joyous rays, Us warmly in thy love enfold, And keep us through life's wintry days! 1859. SUMMER RURAL GATHERING. The sweet June days are come again, With sun and clouds between, And, fed alike by sun and rain, The trees grow broad and green: Spreads broad and green the leafy tent, Upon whose grassy floor Our feet, too long in cities pent, Their freedom find once more. The sweet June days are come again; Once more the glad earth yields Her golden wealth of ripening grain, And breath of clover fields, And deepening shade of summer woods, And glow of summer air, And winging thoughts, and happy moods Of love and joy and prayer. The sweet June days are come again, The birds are on the wing, God's praises, in their loving strain, Unconsciously they sing. We know who giveth all our good, And 'neath the arches dim, And ancient pillars of the wood, We lift our grateful hymn. 1859. A PRAYER. Life of God, within my soul Come, and make my spirit whole! Pour new life through every vein, Search and heal this inward pain! All this restless discontent, All these wishes vainly spent, All this love of self and ease, All thy searching spirit sees,â Let them all decay and fall; Thou, my God, be all in all; Be my power and be my peace, Be my freedom and release. Ever whisper the great thought Which by toil is never bought; Still reveal the glorious truth That gives the soul perpetual youth. LOOKING UNTO GOD. âWho sees God's hand in all things, and all things in God's hand.â I look to thee in every need, And never look in vain; I feel thy touch, Eternal Love! And all is well again. The thought of thee is mightier far Than sin and pain and sorrow are. Discouraged in the work of life, Disheartened by its load, Shamed by its failures or its fears, I sink beside the road,â But let me only think of thee, And then new heart springs up in me. Thy calmness bends serene above, My restlessness to still; Around me flows thy quickening life To nerve my faltering will; Thy presence fills my solitude, Thy providence turns all to good. Embosomed deep in thy dear love, Held in thy law, I stand; Thy hand in all things I behold, And all things in thy hand; Thou leadest me by unsought ways, And turn'st my mourning into praise. âIN ALL AGES ENTERING HOLY SOULS.â Light of ages and of nations! Every race and every time Has received thine inspirations, Glimpses of thy truth sublime. Always spirits in rapt vision Passed the mystic veil within; Always hearts bowed in contrition Found salvation from their sin. Reason's noblest aspiration Truth in growing clearness saw; Conscience spoke its condemnation, Or proclaimed the Eternal law. While thine inward revelations Told thy saints their prayers were heard, Prophets to the guilty nations Spake thine everlasting word. Lord, that word abideth ever; Revelation is not sealed; Answering now to our endeavor, Truth and Right are still revealed. That which came to ancient sages, Greek, Barbarian, Roman, Jew, Written in the soul's deep pages Shines to-day, forever new! 1860. THE CHURCH UNIVERSAL. One holy church of God appears Through every age and race, Unwasted by the lapse of years, Unchanged by changing place. From oldest time, on farthest shores, Beneath the pine or palm, One Unseen Presence she adores, With silence or with psalm. Her priests are all God's faithful sons, To serve the world raised up; The pure in heart her baptized ones, Love her communion-cup. The truth is her prophetic gift, The soul her sacred page; And feet on mercy's errands swift Do make her pilgrimage. O living Church! thine errand speed, Fulfill thy work sublime; With bread of life earth's hunger feed, Redeem the evil time! 1860. âAROUND THE WINTRY TOMB.â Around the wintry tomb, Blown by the drear wind's breath, As with a voice of doom The dry leaf rustleth; But a secret voice still whispers, âO soul, there is no death!â Hearts on the altar laid May seem to perish, slain; The sacrificial blood May seem to flow in vain; But a secret voice still whispers, âO true soul, not in vain!â 1861. JESUS OF NAZARETH. The loving Friend to all who bowed Beneath life's weary load, From lips baptized in humble prayer His consolations flowed. The faithful Witness to the Truth, His just rebuke was hurled Out from a heart that burned to break The fetters of the world. No hollow rite, no lifeless creed, His piercing glance could bear; But longing hearts which sought him found That God and heaven were there. âGIVE US THIS DAY OUR DAILY BREAD.â O God, thou giver of all good! Thy children live by daily food; And daily must the prayer be said, âGive us this day our daily bread!â The life of earth and seed is thine; Suns glow, rains fall, by power divine; Thou art in all; not even the powers By which we toil for bread are ours. What large provision thou hast made! As large as is thy children's need: How wide thy bounteous love is spread! Wide as the want of daily bread. Since every day by thee we live, May grateful hearts thy gifts receive; And may the hands be pure from stain With which our daily bread we gain. ON THE LORD'S SIDE. God's trumpet wakes the slumbering world; Now, each man to his post! The red-cross banner is unfurled; Who joins the glorious host? He who, in fealty to the Truth, And counting all the cost, Doth consecrate his generous youth,â He joins the noble host! He who, no anger on his tongue, Nor any idle boast, Bears steadfast witness against wrong,â He joins the sacred host! He who, with calm, undaunted will, Ne'er counts the battle lost, But, though defeated, battles still,â He joins the faithful host! He who is ready for the cross, The cause despised loves most, And shuns not pain or shame or loss,â He joins the martyr host! JOHN AND JESUS. A voice by Jordan's shore! A summons stern and clear:â Reform! be just! and sin no more! God's judgment draweth near! A voice by Galilee, A holier voice I hear:â Love God! thy neighbor love! for see, God's mercy draweth near! O voice of Duty, still Speak forth: I hear with awe; In thee I own the sovereign will, Obey the sovereign law. Thou higher voice of Love! Yet speak thy word in me; Through Duty let me upward move To thy pure liberty! âFATHER, I HAVE SINNED.â Love for all! and can it be? Can I hope it is for me? I, who strayed so long ago, Strayed so far, and fell so low! I, the disobedient child, Wayward, passionate, and wild; I, who left my Father's home In forbidden ways to roam! I, who spurned his loving hold, I, who would not be controlled; I, who would not hear his call, I, the willful prodigal? I, who wasted and misspent Every talent he had lent; I, who sinned again, again, Giving every passion rein! To my Father can I go?â At his feet myself I'll throw, In his house there yet may be Place, a servant's place for me. See, my Father waiting stands; See, he reaches out his hands; God is love! I know, I see There is love for meâeven me! PRAYER FOR INSPIRATION. Holy Spirit, Truth divine! Dawn upon this soul of mine; Word of God, and Inward Light! Wake my spirit, clear my sight. Holy Spirit, Love divine! Glow within this heart of mine; Kindle every high desire; Perish self in thy pure fire! Holy Spirit, Power divine! Fill and nerve this will of mine; By thee may I strongly live, Bravely bear and nobly strive. Holy Spirit, Right divine! King within my conscience reign; Be my Law, and I shall be Firmly bound, forever free. Holy Spirit, Peace divine! Still this restless heart of mine; Speak to calm this tossing sea, Stayed in thy tranquillity. Holy Spirit, Joy divine! Gladden thou this heart of mine; In the desert ways I sing, âSpring, O Well! forever spring.â PEACE ON EARTH. Peace, peace on earth! the heart of man forever Through all these weary strifes foretells the day; Blessed be God! the hope forsakes him never, That war shall end, and swords be sheathed for aye. Peace, peace on earth! When man to man is brother, Hosts shall go forth to bless, and not destroy; Nations shall justly deal with one another, And peace on earth fulfill the angel's joy. CHURCH ANNIVERSARY. O Thou, whose liberal sun and rain Come not upon the earth in vain, Now let thy quickening word come down The worship of this hour to crown! O hear this church renew its vow, Its solemn consecration now, To work, with heart and soul and might, For Truth and Freedom, Love and Right;â To listen with a willing faith To whatsoe'er the Spirit saith, And year by year to be more true To him who maketh all things new! âGOD, THROUGH ALL, AND IN YOU ALL.â God of the earth, the sky, the sea, Of all above and all below, Creation lives and moves in thee, Thy present life through all doth flow. Thee in the lonely woods we meet, On the bare hills or cultured plains, In every flower beneath our feet, And e'en the still rock's mossy stains. Thy love is in the sunshine's glow, Thy life is in the quickening air; When lightnings flash and storm-winds blow, There is thy power; thy law is there. We feel thy calm at evening's hour, Thy grandeur in the march of night; And when the morning breaks in power, We hear thy word, âLet there be light.â But higher far, and far more clear, Thee in man's spirit we behold; Thine image and thyself are thereâ The Indwelling God, proclaimed of old. âTHE TRUTH SHALL MAKE YOU FREE.â WRITTEN FOR THE TWENTY-FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FIRST MEETING OF THE SECOND UNITARIAN SOCIETY IN BROOKLYN. We sowed a seed in faith and hope Out in the unfenced lands; Now, rooted deep and spreading fair, A living tree it stands. Nor strife nor cry has marked its growth, But, broad'ning silently, Each bough that sways in sunshine says, âThe Truth shall make you free!â Its leaves have for our healing been By dews of heaven blest; Beneath its boughs our children sang, Our dear ones passed to rest. We in its shade with God have walked, Whom our own hearts could see; And lo! from need of rite or creed His Truth has made us free! From outward rule to inward law That Truth our feet still lead! From letter into spirit still, From form to life and deed! From God afar to God most near! Our confidence is he; From fear of man or Church's ban His Truth has made us free. 1876. âBEHOLD, I MAKE ALL THINGS NEW.â WRITTEN FOR THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE FREE RELIGIOUS ASSOCIATION. O Life, that maketh all things new,â The blooming earth, the thoughts of men! Our pilgrim feet, wet with thy dew, In gladness hither turn again. From hand to hand the greeting flows, From eye to eye the signals run, From heart to heart the bright hope glows; The seekers of the light are one,â One in the freedom of the Truth, One in the joy of paths untrod, One in the soul's perennial youth, One in the larger thought of God,â The freer step, the fuller breath, The wide horizon's grander view, The sense of life that knows no death,â The Life that maketh all things new. 1878. âBEHOLD, THE FIELDS ARE WHITE.â Oh, still in accents sweet and strong Sounds forth the ancient word,â âMore reapers for white harvest fields, More laborers for the Lord.â We hear the call; in dreams no more In selfish ease we lie, But girded for our Father's work, Go forth beneath his sky. Where prophets' word, and martyrs' blood, And prayers of saints were sown, We, to their labors entering in, Would reap where they have strown. O Thou whose call our hearts has stirred! To do thy will we come; Thrust in our sickles at thy word, And bear our harvest home. âTHOU WHO, IMMUTABLE AND ONE.â Thou who, Immutable and One, Through varying forms dost range, The abiding life, the steadfast law, Deep at the heart of change;â Our restless life sweeps ever on To regions new and strange; But may our hearts the abiding find, The changeless 'mid all change! âNOW WHILE WE SING OUR CLOSING PSALM.â Now while we sing our closing psalm, With reverent lips and glowing heart, May peace from out th' eternal calm Rest on our spirits as we part. May light, to guide us every hour, From thee, eternal Sun, descend; And strength from thee, almighty Power, Be with us now, and to the end! EASTER. Lo, the earth again is risen, Living, from its wintry prison; Bring we flower and leaf and spray To adorn our holiday! Once again the word comes true: Lo, he maketh all things new! Now the dark, cold days are o'er, Light and gladness are before. How our hearts leap with the spring! How our spirits soar and sing! Light is victor over gloom, Life triumphant o'er the tomb. Change, then, mourning into praise, And for dirges anthems raise! All our fears and griefs shall be Lost in immortality! HYMN FOR A CHURCH ANNIVERSARY. Eternal One, thou living God, Whom changing years unchanged reveal, With thee their way our fathers trod; The hand they held, in ours we feel! The same our trust, the same our need, In sorrow's stress, in duty's hour; We keep their faith, if not their creed, That faith the fount of all our power! We bless thee for the growing light, The advancing thought, the widening view, The larger freedom, clearer sight, Which from the old unfolds the new. With wider view, come loftier goal! With fuller light, more good to see! With freedom, truer self-control, With knowledge, deeper reverence be! Anew we pledge ourselves to thee, To follow where thy truth shall lead. That truth alone can make us free; Who goes with God is safe indeed! BENEDICTION. Father, give thy benediction, Give thy peace, before we part; Still our minds with truth's conviction, Calm with trust each anxious heart:â Let thy voice, with sweet commanding, Bid our griefs and struggles end; Peace which passeth understanding On our waiting spirits send. HYMN WRITTEN FOR THE DEDICATION OF THE CAMBRIDGE HOSPITAL. Thou Lord of life, our saving Health, Who mak'st thy suffering ones our care, Our gifts are still our truest wealth, To serve thee our sincerest prayer. As on the river's rising tide Flow strength and coolness from the sea, So, through the ways our hands provide, May quickening life flow in from thee,â To heal the wound, to still the pain, And strength to failing pulses bring, Till the lame feet shall leap again And the parched lips with gladness sing. Bless thou the gifts our hands have brought! Bless thou the work our hearts have planned! Ours is the hope, the will, the thought; The rest, O God, is in thy hand! 1886. THE LORD OF ALL. Sing forth his high eternal name Who holds all powers in thrall, Through endless ages still the same,â The mighty Lord of all. His goodness, strong and measureless, Upholds us lest we fall; His hand is still outstretched to bless,â The loving Lord of all. His perfect law sets metes and bounds, Our strong defense and wall; His providence our life surrounds,â The saving Lord of all. He every thought and every deed Doth to his judgment call; Oh, may our hearts obedient heed The righteous God of all. When, turning from forbidden ways, Low at his feet we fall, His strong and tender arms upraise,â The pardoning Lord of all. Unwearied he is working still, Unspent his blessings fall, Almighty, Loving, Righteous One, The only Lord of all. EASTER HYMN. Cease, O mourner! cease your tears, Lift your sorrow-burdened eyes. Through the clouds the blue appears, Storms have cleared the April skies. Ended is the winter's strife, Stand the fields in living green; Death is swallowed up in life; Faith is justified, serene. Go not to the grave to sigh, 'T is not there your treasure lies; Unseen, yet most closely nigh, Is the loving heart you prize. Graves are but the body's bed, Soul the grave could never hold; Living seek not 'mid the dead; Hearts that love can ne'er grow cold. Lift your thoughts to higher spheres, There the radiant one behold Free from grief, save for your tears, Joyous as in days of old. There in life's untiring round Of willing service gently led, The dead are living, the lost found, And the sorrowing comforted. Faith's strong hand the veil thus parts, Thus the light of life shines through; Near unto your heart of hearts Is the loved, still loving you. Ended be your mourning hours, Learn the lesson taught of old By the very birds and flowers,â Trust in God, and be consoled. EASTER CAROL. Sing we now our hymns of gladness On this happy Easter morn; Sing of life,âthe life immortal, Life that out of death is born. Death is conquered, and we conquer, When to holy life we rise,â That is life, and life immortal, That the life which never dies. Sing, sing, children sing! Sing of life immortal; Bring, bring flowers of spring To the temple's portal! Strong, strong, lift your song, Beautiful and glorious; Rise, rise, as earth has risen,â Risen from the dead! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Life again from death is born; Thus we sing our hymn of gladness On this happy Easter morn. INSTALLATION HYMN. âBehold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it.â Rev. iii. 8. O Church of Freedom and of Faith, Give ear to what the Spirit saith,â âBehold, I set an open door Before thee, to be shut no more!â Then let no impious hands e'er dare To shut out God's free light and air; Let never bigot's narrow wall Shut in the Grace which flows for all! May he, O God, who comes to-day To teach thy Truth, thy Life, thy Way In thy high service bear his part With open mind and open heart! And O may all who gather here Hold reverence precious, freedom dear, And to the Spirit more and more Be every soul an open door! 1891. [Verses] NO HEART ALONE. âI have learned,â says the melancholy Pestalozzi, âthat in this wide world there is no heart willing or able to help another.â O say not we through life must struggle, Must toil, must mourn, alone; That no one beating heart can answer The throbbings of our own! The sky with its own celestial hues Ever paints the sea below; And the sea sends up its mists to form Bright clouds and the heavenly bow. The stars look down from the holy heaven Into the earthly stream, And see themselves in the quiet depths With softer beauty gleam. Thus all things do of their own beauty Each with some other share; And thus a lesson of loving duty To all men's hearts they bear. Alone amid life's griefs and perils, The stoutest soul might quail; Left to its own unaided efforts, The strongest arm might fail. And though all strength still comes from heaven, All light from God above, Yet we may sometimes be his angels, Apostles of his love. Then let us learn to help each other, As on life's path we wend: Who sees in every man a brother Shall never want a friend. 1839. THE VIADUCT. Fair shines the landscape in the evening glow, While the warm sunbeams steep each tree in light, Brightening the meadow's green expanse below And flashing where the river comes to sight; And high above, the bridge, as in disdain Of hill and valley, over them doth leap, Its rocky feet set firm upon the plain, While the white arches spring from steep to steep; And at that airy height securely sweep The rushing cars in swift and long-drawn train. O wondrous power of man! which thus doth chain All powers of Nature, and doth subject keep Those fiery steeds, and guide them without rein O'er hill and valley, interposed in vain! 1840. ROCK-BURN. TO M. M. W. O'er sands of golden brown, O'er rocks with mosses gray, The eager brook hastes down, Nor pauses on its way;â Staying not to kiss the leaves That dip in its cool tide; Staying not to woo the flowers That bloom along its side; Staying not in the sweet shadow Of the forest green and cool; Staying not in the sunny meadow, Nor in the dark still pool; Staying not to hear the bird-song, Nor the busy hum of the bee, But rushing restless onward Down to the distant sea,â Down through the broad deep river Unto the roaring main; It hears the deep sea calling, And answers back again! Say not the brook is laughing Or singing merrily,â Its wave yon tired boy quaffing Not wearier can be. No mirth it ever knows; But it leaps from stone to stone, And murmurs as it goes In eager, restless tone. And its voice has strange power To win our souls away: Oh, we can sit and listen Through the long summer day,â Sit till the day is ended, And the hot sun gone down, And on the woods descended The twilight soft and brown. And its voice grows loud and clear When the world lies asleep; And it preaches in the ear Of those who wake and weep. It tells of restless yearning, Of the spirit's ceaseless strife, How the soul is ever sighing After a higher life. How time's stream floweth ever Bearing our life away; Vain, vain is our endeavor,â We cannot make it stay! Onward and ever onward The unresting current rolls, And strange, mysterious voices Are calling to our souls. The present cannot win us That we should in it stay; The Eternal call within us We hear, and must obey. 1840. TO A BEAUTIFUL CHILD. So short thy stay, so swift thy flight, Methinks some vision of a night Gleamed for a moment on my sight. But 't is no dream that I retrace, For I have seen thy gentle face, And held thy hand in warm embrace. As bright birds through the forest dart, Does thy sweet smile which knew no art Still flash its sunshine to my heart. And, as beneath the trees I lie, In the dusk violet springing nigh I see again thy tender eye,â That eye where loving thought did brood, Its light by lashes dark subdued, Like the soft light within a wood. And in the neighboring streamlet's fall Thy voice afar doth seem to call In accents mild and musical. So though thou art no longer here, Yet to my heart thou still art near; And I must ever hold thee dear, And unto Heaven raise this prayer, That God from tears thine eyes would spare And guard thy feet from every snare! 1843. LESSONS. What is the lesson the flower preaches As it blooms beside the brook? Could we but listen to what it teaches, We should need no written book. Up from the bosom of earth it shoots To drink the living air; It opens its heart to the light and heat And scatters its perfume rare. âOpen thy heart,â the flower is saying, âTo heavenly truth and love; To God, in man, be aye repaying The good that he sends from above.â What is the lesson the streamlet preaches As it leaps down the mountain-side, Nor rests nor sleeps, but ever reaches On to the ocean's tide? Nor is that its grave. Oh, do not deem That it resteth even there; Look up! and see the mountain stream Transfigured in the air! âOnward!â the stream saith, âever free;â Thy path is still untrod; Not in what seems thy rest must be, But in what is,âin God.â 1844. BY MOUNT HOPE BAY. The evening hour had brought its peace, Brought end of toil to weary hands. From wearying thoughts to find release Alone I sought the ocean sands. Dark rain-clouds southward hovering nigh Gave to the sea their leaden hue; But in the west the open sky Its rose-light on the waters threw. I stood with heart more quiet grown, And watched the pulses of the tide, The huge black rocks, the seaweed brown, The gray beach stretched on either side, The boat that dropped its one white sail Where the steep yellow bank ran down, And, o'er the clump of willows pale, The white towers of the neighboring town. A cool light brooded o'er the land, A changing lustre lit the bay, The wave just plashed along the sand, And voices sounded far away. Past days rose up to memory's eye Dark with some clouds of leaden hue,â But many a space of open sky Its rose-light on those waters threw. Then came to me the dearest friend, Whose beauteous soul to all things fair Doth, like the sea, new beauty lend And glorify each image there. The thoughts which words could never tell Through subtler senses were made known; I raised my eyes, the darkness fell; I stood upon the sandsâalone! 1850. LOVE. To love and seek return, To ask but only this, To feel where we have poured our heart The spirit's answering kiss; To dream that now our eyes The brightening eyes shall meet And that the word we've listened for Our hungering ears shall greet,â How human and how sweet! To love nor find return,â Our hearts poured out in vain; No brightening look, no answering tone, Left lonely with our pain; The opened heavens closed, Night when we looked for morn, The unfolding blossom harshly chilled, Hope slain as soon as born,â How bitter; how forlorn! To love, nor ask return, To accept our solitude, Not now for others' love to yearn But only for their good; To joy if they are crowned, Though thorns our head entwine, And in the thought of blessing them All thought of self resign,â How godlike, how divine! 1851. THE WHITE CLOVER. TO M. E. P. Amid the rich and cultured blooms that shined, By friendly hands bound in a birthday gift, I found the homely, dear white clover hid, And thanked at heart the thought which placed it there,â The plain, good flower that cheerfully fulfills Its homely duties in the common field, Or by the road, ambitious of no more Than to give needed food to kine and bees; Yet serves God's higher love to human hearts, When some poor, ragged, brown-cheeked boy or girl, Crossing the field,âthe poor child's only garden,â Plucks it for nosegay or for ornament Or sucks a moment's pleasure from its cells; Or when some one, not poor nor young, whose heart Is yet a child, nor scornful of cheap joys, Taking beyond the streets his morning walk, Perceives a sudden fragrance in the air, And, looking down, beholds the clover bloom, And thanks the Lord who scatters common things To make us learn to value common things, To prize those things which we may share in common With all, the humblest, more than things select. He sows June fields with clover, and the world Broadcasts with little common kindnesses, With plain, good souls that cheerfully fulfill Their homely duties in the common field Of daily life, ambitious of no more Than to supply the needs of friend or kin, Yet serve God's higher will to human hearts, Giving a very fragrance to the home, The hidden sweetness of a kindly heart. 1857. UNDER THE BRIDGE AT NIAGARA. We sat beneath the wooden bridge As in a sheltering tent, And watched the water's emerald ridge And marvelous white descent. The schoolboys, ruddy-cheeked and fair, Stood round in lightsome mood, Nor saw the awful presence there,â The spirit of the flood. And yet on one of them, thought I, Some deeper influence stole To touch the slumbering chords that lie Even in the childish soul. And when, in later years, his ways Beside these steeps shall be, The wonder-joy his foot that stays Shall seem half memory. Oh, may some heavenly influence Still to my soul be nigh To blend the child's unconscious sense With manhood's seeing eye! 1857. NOVEMBER AND APRIL. The dead leaves their mosaics Of olive and gold and brown Had laid on the rain-wet pavement Through all the embowered town. They were washed by the autumn tempest; They were trod by hurrying feet; And the maids came out with their besoms And swept them into the street, To be crushed and lost forever, 'Neath the wheels, in the black mire, lost,â The summer's precious darlings, Nourished at such a cost. O words that have fallen from me! O golden thoughts and true! Must I see in the leaves a symbol Of the fate that awaiteth you? Again has come the spring-time, With the crocus's golden bloom, And the smell of the fresh-turned mould, And the violet's perfume. O gardener, tell the secret Of these hues and odors sweet!â âI have only brought to my garden The black mire of the street.â THE GOLDEN SUNSET. The golden sea its mirror spreads Beneath the golden skies, And but a narrow strip between Of earth and shadow lies. The cloud-like cliffs, the cliff-like clouds, Dissolved in glory float, And midway of the radiant floods Hangs silently the boat. The sea is but another sky, The sky a sea as well; And which is earth and which the heavens The eye can scarcely tell. So when for me life's latest hour Soft passes to its end, May glory born of earth and heaven The earth and heaven blend; Flooded with light the spirit float, With silent rapture glow, Till where earth ends and heaven begins, The soul shall scarcely know. SHARON WOODS. TO S. W. V. In the woods! in the woods! What tender twilight broods! What flickering sunlights play On the beech-tree's mottled gray, As we sit this summer day In the woods! In the woods, in the woods, What sacred solitudes! The pine-tree soaring high Spreads its hand out toward the sky With murmured prayer and sigh, In the woods. In the woods, in the woods, What low and soft preludes Of winds the long aisles search. Where the marble stems of birch Are the pillars of this church Of the woods! In the woods, in the woods, The brook's soft lapsing floods Chant loud and low by turns, Where, 'mid the plumÃ¨d ferns, The sumac's taper burns In the woods! In the woods, in the woods, What sweet and gracious moods Fill the restless heart with calm, Till it lifts its silent psalm With the flowers that embalm All the woods! 1871. IN MEMORIAM. S. L. W. A sense of life effacing death; A sense of spreading wings; Of larger gaze and fuller breath, At thought of her upsprings! The enthusiastic heartâthe glow Of warm and willing loveâ What bright expansion must it know In the new ways above! The soul that owned all music's thrill, The rapture or the pain, What marvelous delight must fill As flows the angelic strain! The quick bright mind, that knew to prize Truth's freshest, freest word,â What mystic wisdom of the skies Its unsealed ears have heard! O Life, O Love, O Beauty's thrill, O Truth that maketh free, Our souls with clearer faith ye fill In Immortality! 1876. SWISS DAYS. TO S. J. Once more, dear friend, with me recall Our wanderings in the enchanted land: The mountain path, the waterfall, The glacier's chill, the lake's sweet strand. Again from the green slopes of Bern, With eyes by waiting eager grown, In rapture we afar discern The lifted Jungfrau's âgreat white throne.â From MÃ¼rren's pastures zoned with snow We watch the peaks, with quickened breath, Flush in the evening's passionate glow, Fade into pallor passing death. From Wengern, through the lonely night, We hear the avalanche's fall; Or up the weary Sheideck's height Follow the alp-horn's echoing call. Eiger, and MÃ¶nch, and Wetterhorn Majestic cleave the sky anew; And oh, what trembling lights are born In Luzern's emerald, Leman's blue! Names! yet what alchemy is yours Out from the ashes of the past To shape the picture which endures, The colors which the soul holds fast! 1877. TO A FRIEND ON HIS EIGHTY-SECOND BIRTHDAY. I. P. Beyond the common span Allotted unto man Thy life is lengthened, venerable friend! I fain would send a thought, In simple verses wrought, With the good wishes of the day to blend. And as thy thoughts to-day Retrace the lengthened way, How like a golden thread, to thy mind's sight, The love of God doth shine, With its unbroken line Inwoven through the dark as through the light! How like a golden clew All the long pathway through, The care of him, thy Guardian and Guide! Its hidden leadings show In ways thou didst not know, Whate'er was given, or whate'er denied. What cause for thankfulness Thy heart must needs confess To him, the Giver of our every good! Blessings of earth and heaven In such abundance given; Each added year an added multitude! The friendship of the good Who, faithful, by thee stood In paths where action, toil, and duty led; The affection true and tried Which closer at thy side Hath softened life's rough places to thy tread! So has thy cup o'erflowed; And all along the road His rod and staff thy comfort have supplied Who closer than a friend Shall keep thee to the end, And be thy portion still, whate'er betide. For he is there alway, Whate'er may cloud the day; Whate'er is lost, this ever doth remain, Until the gates unclose Through which the pathway goes There, where the weak grow strong, the dimmed eyes see again! 1881. GLEN ELLIS FALL. âUnderneath are the everlasting arms.â Called by a power they must obey The waters take their perilous leap; But every tiniest drop of spray That power doth keep. O heart, that shrinkest back appalled,â So fearful duty's way, and steep,â Know that where'er God's voice hath called His hand will keep! 1885. UP TO THE HILLS. From tame and level lowlands, From the restless, restless sea, My spirit reaches upward, Calm mountain land, to thee! Through the woodlands, through the farm-lands, I speedâyet all too slow; And the rivers flow to meet me, Flow to greet me, as I go. Now green hills are beginning To rise on every side; And distant, beckoning summits Glance shyly, and then hide. Now they are all about me, In their very arms I stand; Their strength, their peace, their beauty, Fold me on every hand. For me they have been waiting, Patient, unchanging, true; Through all the long year's absence My faithful heart they knew. How on their tranquil faces, Immobile as they seem, The loving eye still traces The shifting thought and dream,â Their sunny smile's enchantment, Their sad cheeks' mournful curve, Their glowing, breathing rapture, Their secret, dark reserve! How noble is their friendship! They hold my freedom dear; They encircle and they guard me, Yet they will not come too near! 1886. GOLDEN-ROD. TO E. K. P. The parting day had come; we stood alone On the bare hillside at the evening hour; The mountains rose before us in their power, But from their face the light was wholly flown. In the gray sky no gleam of sunlight shone; Black rain-clouds just withheld the threatening shower; All Nature seemed to pause, and shrink, and cower, Such sombre stillness over all was thrown. We spoke in low hushed tones, amid the gloom, Of life and all its burdens and its cares, Of sorrow, and of death, and things more sad; Then of the life that shines beyond the tomb: From the black sky I looked down, unawares, And lo! with golden flowers earth at our feet was glad. 1886. SEPTEMBER. Summer is gone; but summer days remain: Not all at once the sun withdraws his heat, Though the day later dawns and flies more fleet. A softened warmth glows upon vale and plain; From field and orchard now the full-heaped wain Brings the ripe fruitage of the vanished days; With gold and purple all the roadsides blaze; To dream of summer still the earth is fain. So from my life the summer now is gone, And yet my heart some lingering glow retains, Some joy in beauty, some unchilled romance; Though fled the raptures of my manhood's dawn, Yet love of truth, yet love of love, remains, And gentle visions still my soul entrance. 1886. NOVEMBER. Summer is gone, but summer days return: The winds and frosts have stripped the woodlands bare, Save for some clinging foliage here and there; Now as if, pitiful, her heart did yearn, Nature, the loving mother, lifts her urn And pours the stream of life to her spent child. The desert air grows strangely soft and mild, And in his veins the long-fled ardors burn. So when are past the mid-years of our lives, And, sad or glad, we feel our work nigh done, There come to us, with sudden, swift returns The glow, the thrill, which show that life survives, Thatâthough through softening mistsâstill shines the sun, And in our souls the Indian summer burns. 1886. INTERVALE. The winding Saco swiftly speeds Southward among the flowering weeds, The solemn pine trees lift on high Their outstretched branches toward the sky; The purple cliffs above the elms Frown underneath their crested helms, The summer breezes as they pass Toss into waves the meadow grass, And shake the light-poised poplar leaves, Then play beyond among the sheaves; While we upon the upland green Drink draughts of beauty from the scene. 1886. THE GREAT STONE FACE IN THE FRANCONIA NOTCH. O silent watcher on the mountain-head, What years have passed, what generations sped, Since eye first looked upon thy features dread! Men gaze awe-struck upon thy countenance, Or pass thee by with hasty, careless glance, And speed again upon their folly's dance. Unrecked by thee they come and go their ways; Thou heedest not their chatter nor their praise, But keepest down the vale thy solemn gaze. Stern, grim, unyielding, unrelenting, thus Looked old Prometheus forth from Caucasus, So guerdoned for his service perilous. Say, didst thou too the skies once strive to climb, With purpose, too audaciously sublime, To bring to man Heaven's gifts before their time? Jove darts his bolts against thee, all in vain; In vain his wrestling gales, his storming rain; Thou wait'st undaunted, bearing all the pain. The pitying clouds float up to cool thy cheek; They woo thee gently, but thou dost not speak; Silent, for thy deliverer dost thou seek? Friend, helper, or deliverer find'st thou none; Thy lip, thy brow, thy heart have turned to stone; Dumb through the years,âin all the world alone! 1887. CHILDREN. O children, life's perpetual June! Your path with buds and fragrance strewn, Down which your feet beat happy tune! Your chubby hands are full of flowers, Your eyes, of sunshine and of showers,â Darlings of Nature's heart and ours! With you we toss the fragrant hay, Or pluck wild roses from the spray; Your cheeks more rosy-fair than they. Such charm has Nature round you flung; You know âthe song the sirens sung,â That keeps our hearts forever young; That lures us to forget our years, Forget our burdens and our fears; Oh, blessed is the ear that hears! The innocence that is so wise; The trust that dreams of no disguise; The simple faith in mysteries,â These still shall in the world survive So long as God doth children give, To keep the child in us alive. FURNESS ABBEY. âConsidering every day the uncertainty of life, and that the roses and flowers of kings, emperors, and dukes, and the crowns and palms of all the great wither and decay; and that all things with an uninterrupted course tend to dissolution and death.ââ Charter of the Abbey. On Norman cloister and on Gothic aisle The fading sunset lingers for a while; The rooks chant noisy vespers in the elms;â Then night's slow-rising tide the scene o'erwhelms. So fade the roses and the flowers of kings, And crowns and palms decay with humbler things; All works built up by toil of mortal breath Tend in unbroken course to dust and death. Pillar and roof and pavement all are gone; The lamp extinguished and the prayers long done; But faith and awe, as stars, eternal shine;â The human heart is their enduring shrine. All were not idle and all were not base Who had within these walls their dwelling-place. And still that life is harried, restless, driven, Which finds no hour to contemplation given. O Earth, in thine incessant funerals, Take to thyself these crumbling, outgrown walls! In the broad world our God we seek and find, And serve our Maker when we serve our kind. Yet spare, for tender thought, for beauty spare, Some sculptured capital, some carving fair; Yon ivied archway, fit for poet's dream, For painter's pencil, or for preacher's theme! Save, for our modern hurry, rush, and strife, The needed lesson that thought, too, is life! Work is not prayer, nor duty's self divine, Unless within them Reverence hath her shrine. THE NEW YEAR. New Year! new Life, new Love! New Hope's fair prophecy, New Earth around, new Heavens above Veiled in soft mystery! O deep and boundless Love! O Life, more full and free! O Hopes, in fairer colors wove!â This New Year's gift are ye. WITH AN EASTER CARD, BEARING A SHIELD OF FAITH. Hear what ancient Scripture saith, âTake to thee the shield of Faith.â Oft hath it thy covert been, Thy defense and sheltering screen. When the darts of grief and pain Have assailed thy soul in vain, âMore than conquerorâ thou hast been In the might of âthings unseen.â Thine the faith that looked above, Saw through clouds the Eternal Love. Thine the faith that looks beyond, Saw that Life escapes Death's bond. Saw to those who shall endure Victory at last made sure; Saw, whoever may deride, Angel legions on Truth's side; Saw the Everlasting Might Pledged to justify the Right. Now, at this fair Easter-tide Faith again is justified, Lo! the earth that lay so dead Lifts again its beauteous head, Lo! the buried seed and root Spring toward leaf and flower and fruit. Vain the winter's guard and seal Life supreme save to reveal. May the stone be rolled away From all buried hearts to-day! 1889. âBENEATH THE SHADOW OF THE ALMIGHTY.â Where violets cast their shadow on the sod, The dewy grass in cooler freshness starts: And so, beneath the shadowing hand of God, Spring fresh the holier feelings of our hearts. The Almighty's shadow is a star-lit night; His cloud is ever full of hidden light. âI WILL TRUST AND NOT BE AFRAID.â By this broad stream our fathers made their dwelling, Builded their ships, and boldly left the shore, Trusting in God, when winds and waves were swelling; They dared the sea, nor trembled at its roar. Honor we still their faith and brave endeavor, But dwell not always in the walls they reared; We build not on the ancient ways forever; Yet trust no less the God whom they revered. In broader day, with clearer light beholding, Changing their creed but keeping fast their faith, Freely the ancient forms of thought remoulding, Asking what word to-day the Spirit saith,â We, from the time-worn piers our ship unmooring, Afloat, but not adrift upon the tide, Dare Truth's broad seas, in faith our hearts assuring He must be safe who sails where God doth guide. SACRED SONG. Father of Mercies, all is rest and peace. The stir of day is over now and gone. Father of Mercies! Seek we sweet release From daily cares in thee, O holy One! The heavenly choirs their worship never cease, They come and go around the Father's throne, And while we lift our hymns, the holy chorus Of blessed spirits solemnly floats o'er us. Holy devotion! filling every heart As if with gentle showers of evening dew, Faith strong and earnest up to heaven doth dart, As though on eagle's wings it upward flew. Hope whispers cheer and bids our fears depart, While Love bathes all our souls in joy anew. Father of Mercies, we in spirit kneeling Pour forth in silence all our blissful feeling. SONNET READ ON THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CLASS OF 1839. The voyage draws near its end; the westering Sun, Shorn of its noon-day heat, yet full of light, Marks the smooth waters with a glory bright Richer than pearly gleams from morning won. The shore, which when our voyage was but begun Lay so remote beyond even thought's far flight, Now on the horizon lifts itself to sight; Sees it our failure, or our work well done? Something perhaps of both the voyage has brought, Of our large venture something must avail, For dreams of youth we have the faith of age By knowledge chastened, by experience taught! And now the time has come to shorten sail, The tranquil harbor calls to anchorage! 1889.</field>
