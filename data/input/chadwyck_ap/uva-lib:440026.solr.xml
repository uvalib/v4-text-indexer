      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. YONNONDIO, OR THE WARRIORS OF THE GENESEE, A TALE OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY. PREFACE TO YONNONDIO. A friend, on hearing that âYonnondioâ was in press, remarked that it would appear at an unpropitious hour. The clamor of contending parties in a great political contest, I am aware, is well calculated to drown the low undertone of a poet's lute; but the same cause, by distracting the attention of criticism, may render the voice of censure less harsh and loud. The Poem is descriptive of events which transpired in the valley of the Genesee, during the summer and autumn of 1687âof the memorable attempt of the Marquis De Nonville, under pretext of preventing an interruption of the French trade, to plant the standard of Louis XIV. in the beautiful country of the Senecas. Impartial history has convicted the Marquis of an open infraction of the treaty made at Whitehall, in the previous year, between Great Britain and France, by which it was settled that the Indian trade in America should remain free to both crowns. The Five Nations were in alliance with the former, and English parties were cut off on the Lakes, their effects seized, and their persons imprisoned, previous to any hostile demonstration on the part of the Senecas. I shall not apologize to my readers for clothing a stable framework of fact with the shifting drapery of fancyâit is the bard's prerogative by immemorial usage; nor will I advert to hero and heroines, summoned from âDream Land,â further than to say that in Blanche I have endeavored to portray a true-hearted woman, strong and faithful in her love, and sustained in the hour of trial by a firm reliance on Heaven. D'Lisle, I will admit, is not a fair representative of that famous order who pioneered the way on this continent, for the march of civilization. Many of Loyola's followers were the messengers of peace and good will to man, though their subtle and dissembling policy was ever to make political proselytes through the agency of religion. In conclusion, let me add, that I have essayed to throw the mantle of Romance over the pleasant scenes of my boyhood; and if my failure has been signal, the most censorious must admit that the design is worthy of commendation. Avon, August 24, 1844. DEDICATORY SONNET. Thou hast been, Sire, my guardian and my guide, And therefore it is meet that unto thee The few stray leaves should dedicated be Which I commit to Fortune's changeful tide: Thy voice aroused me from desponding mood, When pale with letter'd toil, as trumpet blast, Heard in the watch of midnight, sendeth blood Through veins of startled warrior warm and fast. In Europe's worn-out world I have not sought Heroic theme, but in my native vale, Moved by the red man's legendary tale, Perchance from Nature's altar-flame have caught One kindling sparkâand, Father, if my strain Win word of praise from thee, I have not sung in vain. PROEM. Realm of the Senecas! no more In shadow lies the Pleasant Vale; Gone are the Chiefs who ruled of yore, Like chaff before the rushing gale. Their rivers run with narrowed bounds, âThat trees are great promoters of lakes and rivers, appears from a well known fact in North America; for, since the woods and forests have been grubbed and cleared, all bodies of water that were considerable a century ago, will not now drive a common mill.â Natural History of Selborneâ Kalm's Travels in North America. Cleared are their broad, old hunting grounds, And on their ancient battle fields The greensward to the ploughman yields; Like mocking echoes of the hill Their fame resounded and grew still, And on green ridge and level plain Their hearths will never smoke again. When fade away the summer flowers, And come the bright autumnal hours, The ripened grain above their graves Nods to the wind in golden waves. Fled are their pomp and power like dreams, By scribe unmarked, by bard unsung; But mountains, lakes and rolling streams Recall their wild rich forest tongue, And names of melody they bear, Sweeter than flute-notes on the air. Oblivion swallows, one by one, Old legends by the sire to son Around the crackling camp-fire toldâ Their oaks have fallen, trunk and bough, And hut and hall of council now Are changed to ashes cold. Toiled have I many a weary day To gather their traditions gray, And rescue from effacing time A few brave deeds and traits sublime. Now listen, for the tale I tell Perchance may be remembered well, Though coarsely framed my sylvan lyre, Harsh its wild tone, untuned its wire! CANTO FIRST. THE CAMP. Lovely is Summer in old Mother Land, Lighting up garden, park and pasture green; Wrecks of monastic pomp, and castle grand, Forever hallowed features of the scene! But lovelier look the nymph puts on, I ween, Amid lone forests of the Western World, Though brown of visage and untamed of mienâ Moss-fringed her robeâher ringlets all uncurled With dew in leafy halls, at noontide hour impearled. Oak groves of merry England are renowned In rustic legend and in polished lay; Mort on the horn her early monarchs wound, While bled the stag, beneath their branches gray, And still their iron trunks defy decayâ But rugged woods of our Hesperian clime Have wider empire:âclothed in dark array That graced their arches at the birth of Time, When new-born spheres, with song, began their march sublime. I. Through pines that crowned the wooded steep, Winds, freshened by the lake, were sighing, And in his basin, broad and deep, Irondequoit was darkly lying. By some writers the word was written Tyrondequait, by others Irondequat. Smith in his history of New York, alludes to a public trading house âat Irondequat in the Senecas' land.â The name given on modern maps, to this romantic bay, is âIrondequoit.â A deeper, more luxuriant green, In grassy spire and wood-plant seen; A clearer tinkle in the rill, And light more lustrous on the hill, A richer fragrance in the breeze, And wilder, sweeter melodies, Told that serene and happy May To summer had resigned her sway; That arching sky had caught its hue From June's clear orb of radiant blue. II. Earth was in gala dress arrayed, And blushed with flowers the forest mould, While stately tulip trees displayed Their honeyed cups of glistening gold; Rich robe was over maple flung; On chestnut golden tassel hung; Light airs a slumberous tune evoked From leaves that trembling poplar cloaked, And oaks a thicker foliage bore, To canopy the forest floor; Where open space on hill side lay, Exposed to ripening warmth of day, The sod, with strawberries bestrown, Was tinted like the ruby-stone. III. Far up the reedy bay were seen Bright upland swells with vales between, Through which ran brooks of crystal sheen; The lily-stem its silver cup Above the water lifted up, And throwing on deep pool a shade, Waved the long flag its emerald blade; To crumbling marge, with eager cries, The heron bore his dripping prize, And down the rough uneven bank The snorting wild deer came and drank; Amid the reeds that fringed the shore The water-rat and otter swam, And fearlessly the beaver bore His tooth-hewn timber to the dam. Wild was the scene!âhis ragged cone, A mossy hemlock reared on high, The forest eagle's lofty throne When tired of circling in the sky. The mock-bird, perched on bending spray, Woke his sweet, imitative lay; With arching neck and air of pride, The white swan floated on the tide; The author's father, a pioneer of Western New York, informed him, that in the first settlement of the country, he saw a flock of twenty swans âspreading their snowy sailsâ in the Bay of Irondequoit. Two or three summers since, a brother of the author shot a swan, of large dimensions, while flying over a pond in the vicinity of Avon; and more recently, one was killed in Irondequoit Bay, by a gentleman of Rochester. And gabbling in sequestered cove, The black duck oiled her breast, and dove. IV. East of Irondequoit the scene Was rich in robes of living green, But ruder charm romantic gaze Found on the western shore to praise; For the huge monarchs of the wood In straggling groups disparted stood, As if they did not wish to break The broad blue prospect of the Lake, Their playmate when the rugged earth Gave stem and leaf a hardy birth; Whose bath of cool, refreshing spray Had wet them many a summer day; Whose surge kept time upon the shore When night-blast woke their branches hoar, In concert with the hollow roar. On naked point of table-land That, beetling o'er the polished strand, Commanded view of wave and wood Two natives of the region stood; And crouching fondly at their feet Gaunt wolf dogs panted with the heat. The Indians rear a breed of dogs crossed with the wolf and foxâremarkable for their speed, sharp noses, and pointed, upright ears. V. Knives in their braided girdles hung, To which the purple stain yet clung, And pouches grim with dangling claws, Bead-broidered tail and grinning jaws. Rude jewels in the shape of globes, And rings depended from their ears, Slit lengthwise to the pliant lobes; And twinkled like resplendent tears That morning finds upon the leaf, Drops from the urn of joy, not grief. Thongs to the graceful limbs made fast, The scarlet leggin laced with quills, By bird and bristling hedge-hog cast, And edged with long and gaudy frills. Adorned with feathers brightly dyed, And ornaments of bone and shell; Trim hunting frock of smoke-tann'd hide Their manly forms befitted well. Light hoofs of deer on sinew strung Were closely to the ankle bound, And when the foot was lifted, rung With a low, strange, and rattling sound; Their rounded heads were shorn and bare, Save cherished tufts of streaming hair, Left for the grasp of mortal foe, If destiny should aid his blow When meet wild warriors of the wood To quench Hate's ghastly torch in blood. Bard would have said with kindling brain, Could he have gazed upon the twain, âBehold, reposing from the chase, The guardian spirits of the place, And study for inspired hour When bosom thrills with sense of power;â Would sculptor in their forms have found, Full of wild energy and grace, And the marked features of their race By Nature's brush embrowned. VI. Tone, dignity of step and mien, Apart from flaunting pomp of dress, In courtly hall and forest green, Denote high birth and kingliness: Brow, lip and haughty glance betray A personage of kingly sway, Though no dread symbol of command Is flashing in the jewelled hand; And persons of monarchal mould Were those dark hunters of the wold; And likeness to each other bore Observable to careless eye, Not only in the garb they wore, But bearing resolute and high. VII. The senior of the two was tall, But in his frame symmetrical, And chronicled were former wars On brow and breast in âglorious scars.â Though seventy vanished years to white Had scalp lock changed, once black as night, Still could his eye direct the shaft, His hand the whirling hatchet guide, Or knife-blade redden to the haft, When close encounter prowess tried. Hours lapsed away, and neither broke The silence of the place or spoke, But stood in attitude to hear Sounds only caught by tutored ear, While looked they forth with searching glance On Cadaracqui's calm expanse, Cadaracqui is the aboriginal name of Ontario. âThe Senecas (whom the French call Sonontouons) are situated between Lake Erie and Cadaracqui Lake, near the great fall of Iagara (sometimes called Oniagira, Ochniagara,) by which all the Indians that live round Lake Erie, round the Lake of the Hurons, round the Lake of the Illinois, or Michigan, and round the great Upper Lake, generally pass in their way to Canada.â Smith's History of New York. For floating on his bosom blue Large objects slowly loomed to view. VIII. At last the younger woodman cried, For weapon feeling at his side, âLook, Father!âgleaming in the sun, Are pointed spear, long knife, and gun, While hither, on the swelling waves, Float Yonnondio's hostile braves!â Yonnondio was a title originally given by the Five Nations to M. de Montmagny, but became a style of address in their treaties, by which succeeding Governor Generals of New France were designated. âYes, boy!âthose war-canoes are mann'd By foemen to our native land; They hope to wrap our huts in flame, And blot from memory our name; My people unprepared assail, Change the light laugh to dying wail, And flowers tread down that fragrance shed On grave-mounds of our honored dead. I fear them not!âthree moons ago My warriors laid their bravest low, And gory scalps, on homeward track, To shrivel in the smoke bore back. Look, look! a viler race is nearâ The coward Hurons guide them here, And fondly hope, in lucky hour, To crush the Aganuschian power; âThe Five Nations were the Mohawks, the Oneidas, the Cayugas, the Onondagas, and the Senecas. The Virginian Indians gave them the name of Massowamokes; the Dutch called them Maquas, or Makakuase; and the French, Iroquois. Their appellation at home was the Mingoes, and sometimes the Aganuschion, or United People.â Thatcher. âWhen the Dutch began the settlement of this country, all the Indians on Long Island and the northern shore of the sound, on the banks of the Connecticut, Hudson, Delaware, and Susquehanna rivers, were in subjection to the Five Nations, and acknowledged it by the payment of tribute. The French historians of Canada, both ancient and modern, agree that the more northern Indians were driven before the superior martial prowess of the confederates. The author of the book entitled, âRelation de ce qui s'est passe de plus remarquable aux missions de peres, de la compagnie de Jesus en la nouvelle France,â published with the privilege of the French King, at Paris, in 1661, informs us that all the Northern Indians were harassed by the Five Nations. âPartout, (says he, speaking in the name of the missionaries,) nous trouvons Iroquois, qui comme un fantÃ´me importun, nous obsÃ©de en tous lieux.ââ Smith's History of New York. But will they find a dreaming foe? No, thanks to Ou-we-nee-you, Great Spirit. no! When hunters for the panther search They never find their game asleep, But watchful on his lofty perch, And crouching for the deadly leap. IX. Their dangerous post those warriors kept, Until they heard the plash of oar, While heavily the blade was swept, Affrighting wild fowl on the shore; Then the loud, startling war-whoop raised, One moment on the pageant gazed, And sought, with footstep quick and light, Screen in thick wilderness from sight. X. The proud flotilla in the bay Cast anchor near the close of day, Scaring the wild-wolf, grim and gaunt, From old, hereditary haunt, And startling in his mossy lair, With iron clang of arms, the bear. The sun descending, bathed in light, Steep, naked bluff and pine-capped height, And varied tints of lustrous glow Flung on the lucent waves below, That kissed, by gentle south wind fann'd, With murmur soft the glittering strand. XI. It would have been a thrilling sight Troops to have seen in trappings brightâ Whose guns had poured the leaden rain On storied fields across the main, And heard the trumpet's martial call Sound triump-note for brave old Gaul, By hundreds landed on a shore Where sabre never rang beforeâ By leaders who had freely bled In wars of mighty Louis, ledâ Chiefs who on Steenkirk's plain had fought, And battle's heart at Landen sought. XII. De Nonville with an eye of skill Took measurement of slope and hill, De la Barre was succeeded by the Marquis De Nonville, colonel of the dragoons, who arrived with a reinforcement in 1685. In the preceding year the French availed themselves of a peace with the Five Nations, to build fortifications on the northern waters, and extending their fur trade among the northern and western Indians. They were opposed by the Iroquois. The Senecas, who were the most numerous of the allied tribes, and nearest the theatre of action, annoyed the French, by cutting off trading parties laden with ammunition and arms for the tribes who hunted for them. De la Barre collected at Cadaracqui Fort (now Kingston,) the forces of Canada, but sickness in his camp compelled him to abandon his military operations against the Five Nations, and resort to negotiation. A treaty was held at Kaihohage, between Indian deputies, with Garangula at their head, and the Canadian Governor. It was on this occasion that the Onondaga chief in a harangue that has been pronounced by the lamented Clinton equal in oratorical merit to Logan's famous speech, exclaimed:â âYonnondio!âyou must have believed when you left Quebec, that the sun had burnt up all the forests which render our country inaccessible to the French, or that the lakes had so far overflown the banks, that they had surrounded our castles, and that it was impossible for us to get out of them. Yes, surely you must have dreamed so, and the curiosity of seeing so great a wonder, has brought you so far. Now you are undeceived. I and the warriors here present, are come to assure you, that the Senecas, Cayugas, Onondagas, Oneidas, and Mohawks are yet alive. I thank you in their name, for bringing back into their country the calumet, which you predecessor received from their hands. It was happy for you, that you left underground that murdering hatchet so often dyed in the blood of the French. âHear, Yonnondio! I do not sleep. I have my eyes open. The sun which enlightens me, discovers to me a great captain at the head of a company of soldiers, who speaks as if he were dreaming. He says, that he only came to the lake to smoke on the great calumet with the Onondagas. But Garangula says he sees the contrary; that it was to knock them on the head, if sickness had not weakened the arms of the French. I see Yonnondio raving in the camp of sick men, whose lives the Great Spirit has saved by inflicting this sickness on them. âHear, Yonnondio! our women had taken their clubs, our children and old men had carried their bows and arrows into the heart of your camp, if our warriors had not disarmed them, and kept them back, when your messenger came to our castles. It is done, and I have said it. âHear, Yonnondio!âWe plundered none of the French, but those that carried guns, powder and balls to the Twightwies and Chictaghicks, because those arms might have cost us our lives. Herein we follow the example of the Jesuits, who break all the kegs of rum brought to our castles, lest the drunken Indians should knock them on the head. Our warriors have not beaver enough to pay for all the arms they have taken, and our old men are not afraid of the war. This belt preserves my words. We carried the English into our Lakes to trade there with the Utawawas and Anatoyhies, as the Adirondacks brought the French to our castles to carry on a trade which the English say is theirs. We are born free. We neither depend on Yonnondio or Corlear (name given to the Governors of New York). We may go where we please, and carry with us whom we please, and buy and sell what we please. If your allies be your slaves, use them as such, command them to receive no other but your people.â When the words of Garangula were interpreted to De La Barre, stung with shame and incensed, he left the council. Soon after, his troops disbanded, and the haughty Iroquois exulted in this signal overthrow of the Governor's schemes. The Marquis De Nonville, says Smith in his history, was a man of courage and of an enterprising spirit, and not a little animated by the consideration that he was sent over to repair the disgrace which his predecessor had brought upon the French Colony. By Charlevoix he is thus eulogizedââEgalement estimable pour sa valeur, sa droiture et sa piÃ©tÃ©.â La Hontan censures his acts while administering the government of New France, in violating the treaty of Whitehall, by invading the country of the Senecas, and denying the British title to the command of the Lake. In the language of Smith, âDe Nonville, to prevent the interruption of the French trade with the Twightwies, determined to carry the war into the country of the Five Nations. To that end he collected, in 1687, two thousand troops and six hundred Indians at Montreal, and issued orders to all the officers in the more westerly country to meet him at Niagara, on an expedition against the Senecas. ? ? ? ? ? ? ? The Five Nations, in the mean time, were preparing to give the French army a suitable reception. The Marquis having embarked his whole army in canoes, set out from the fort at Cadaracqui, on the 23d of June, one-half of them passing along the north and the other on the south side of the lake, and both arrived at the same time at Irondequoit, and shortly after set out on their march towards the chief village of the Senecas, at about seven leagues' distance. The main body was composed of the regulars and militia, the front and rear of the Indians and traders. The scouts advanced the second day of their march, as far as the corn of the village, and within pistol shot of five hundred Senecas who lay upon their bellies undiscovered. The French who imagined the enemy were all fled, quickened their march to overtake the women and old men. But no sooner had they reached the foot of a hill, about a mile from the village, than the Senecas raised a war-shout, and in the same instant charged upon the whole army, both in the front and rear. Universal confusion ensued. The battalions divided, fired upon each other and flew into the wood. The Senecas improved the disorder of the enemy, till they were overpowered by the force of numbers and compelled to retreat. The Marquis was so much dispirited that he could not be persuaded to pursue the enemy that day; which gave the Senecas an opportunity to burn their village and get off. Traces of De Nonville's invasion are still visible upon the banks of the Genesee. Near the village of West Rush, Monroe County, the traveller and tourist can still see the ruins of a fortified encampment. Outlines of mortar bed, trench and mound are well defined. The author is in possession of fragments of gun and blade, picked up on the old battle-field which lies at the foot of a hill on which the present village of Avon is situated. It is a favorite haunt and play-place of the school-boy, who is lured thither by the hope of finding flint or musket-ball, hatchet or arrow-heads, disinterred by the plough, or washed to view by the drenching shower. And tents were pitched, by his command, On swells of undulating land, Well guarded on the weaker flanks, By water and opposing banks; While open front, or esplanade, Was wisely left for prompt parade, If chance the tocsin of alarm Should call upon the host âto arm!â The pickets, helmeted and mailed, For nightly vigil were detailed; The sentinel was shown the bounds, Wherein to pace his lonely rounds, And in advance, the tried vidette, To guard each pass to camp, was set. XIII. Their savage allies plumed for strife, And armed with hatchet, club and knife, In dusky groups, beneath the shade, Their sylvan lodge and watch-fire made, Or ranged the copse with ready bow, To spy out trace of lurking foe; For the fierce Huron of Lorette, And stern Algonquin of the north, The Hurons of Lorette were likewise called Onatoghies. The Adirondacks, or Algonquins drove the Iroquois from their hunting-grounds around Montreal, to the borders of the Lakes. The latter having conquered the Satanas, under wise and warlike sachems adopted the plan of fighting their old enemies in small bands, instead of trusting the issue of war to a general engagement. In turn the Adirondacks were conquered, though aided by the French arms, and the war-whoop of the Five Nations became the knell of the surrounding tribes. The Niperceneans were nearly exterminated, and a wretched remnant of them fled for safety to Hudson's Bay. âThe borders of Outawas which were once thickly peopled, became almost deserted.â West of the Alleghanies they carried their arms, and warred against most of the nations of the south. See Herriot, Canada, Smith, Thatcher, &amp;c. Whose soil the Seneca had wet With blood and tears, were going forth To crush the conqueror, and leave No mourner for the slain to grieve, If vengeance could the task achieve. XIV. Nose, ear and neck, with jewels hung, And wild words of their forest tongue; Rude quivers on the shoulder borne, From spotted fawn and wild-cat torn; The gleaming cincture round the waist Prized ornament of savage taste; Paint on their scowling faces spread, In horrid streaks of black and redâ Their bucklers of defensive form, Frail guardians in the battle storm, Bore strange unlikeness to the dress, Bright armor, martial haughtiness, And discipline of soldiers, famed Whenever âwarriorâ is named; Whose charge had strewn the earth with dead While Luxemburgh and Vauban led, Or in the combat, man to man, Had seen with hardihood unshrinking The plume of Conde in the van, Where Death his reddest draught was drinking. XV. Tribes, who with Yonnondio came Hereditary wrongs to right, Abandoning pursuit of game For issues of the doubtful fight, Were under conduct of D'Lisle, A man of energy and wile; And priest of that strange order known From clime to clime, and zone to zoneâ The immediate design of other religious societies was to separate their members from the world; that of the Jesuits, to render themselves masters of it. They were exempt from the usual functions of other monks, and were not required to spend their time in ceremonial offices and mummeries. The meanest talents were in requisition, and according to their own expression âthe Jesuits have missionaries for the villages and martyrs for the Indians.â Thus a peculiar energy was infused into their operations; which has been compared to a system of mechanism containing the greatest quality of power distributed to the greatest possible advantage. âThe Jesuits,â it was said with justice, âare a naked sword whose hilt is Rome.â They propagated a system of the most relaxed morality, which accommodated itself to the passions of men, justified their vices, tolerated their imperfections. To persons of the stricter principles they studied to recommend themselves by the purity of their lives. While looking with a lenient eye on immoral practices, they were severe in exacting a strict orthodoxy in opinions. âThey are a set of people,â said the Abbe Boileau, âwho lengthen the creed, and shorten the decalogue.â One of their cardinal precepts was as follows: âPrinces and distinguished persons must by all means be so managed that their ears may be gained, which will secure their hearts.â They neither chaunted nor prayed. âThey cannot sing,â said their enemiesââfor birds of prey never do.â D'Alembert, Mosheim, &amp;c. Whose pilgrims in the world of thought The secret springs of knowledge sought, And deemed it feminine to dwell, Monastic drones, in convent cell: Whose members, by ambition fired, Forged fetters of religious thrall, And tyranny o'er minds acquired In savage hut and lordly hall: Braved, to extend their mystic league, Dark peril, hunger and fatigue, Upraised the rod of mystic sway In distant Ind and Paragua, âIn the beginning of the 17th century they obtained from the court of Madrid, the grant of the large and fertile Province of Paragua, which stretches across the southern continent of America, from the mountains of Potosi to the banks of the river La Plata; and after every deduction which can reasonably be made from their own accounts, enough will remain, to excite the astonishment and applause of mankind. By wise and humane policy they attracted converts, till at last they formed a powerful and well organized state of 300,000 families. âIndustry was universal, want was unknown. Even the elegant arts began by degrees to appear, and full protection was provided against any invasion. An army of 60,000 men was completely armed, and regularly disciplined, consisting of cavalry, infantry and artillery, and well provided with magazines and munitions of war. It would be in vain to deny that mankind derived advantages from the labors of the Jesuits. Their ardor in improving the healing art, their skill in the instruction of youth and love of ancient literature, contributed to the progress of polite learning. Even the debased species of Christianity which they introduced, was superior to the bloody rites of the savage.â Edinburg Encyclopedia, vol. xi, p. 170. Sought with the vesper hymn and psalm Saint Lawrence and his isles of balmâ Made voluble the wooing air, Round holy Horicon with prayer, Nor scrupled with the cross and sword, To head a wild, barbaric horde. XVI. D'Lisle made use of subtle arts To graft his creed on savage hearts, And won, by gift and gilded bribe, Esteem of many a forest tribe. Like them, he painted face and lip, And robed his limbs in skin of beast, The success of the Jesuits in making converts among the aboriginal population of this continent was owing to a compliance, on their part, with savage customs. France, in extending her empire in America, was more aided by Jesuitical intrigue than force of arms. Notwithstanding the friendly relations that existed between the major portion of the Five Nations and the English, the crafty Jesuits made a diversion in favor of the crown of France, by sending their emissaries among them. âDivide et impera,â was the French motto. Father Joucaire was adopted by the Senecas, and was esteemed by the Onondagas. He lived among them after their manner, and spoke the Indian language, as Charlevoix informs us, âavec la plus sublime eloquence Iroquoise.â And sate, in joyous fellowship, With quivered warriors at the feast; Dark, floating Rumor linked his name, Among his countrymen, with shameâ Some even whispered that he fled In terror from his native clime, And bore a keen stiletto, red From point to hilt with crime; And many hinted that his soul Was far too proud for priestly stole, And that his broad and iron hand Could better clutch the heavy brand, Than grasp with meek, uplifted eye, The sacred vase or rosary. XVII. Night with her sombre shadows came, And on the waters dark and still, Was flung the ruddy light of flame, By beacon kindled on the hill; The muffled owl, foreboding bird, Complaining on her perch was heard; The wild beast caught the scent of men, And hurried to his brambly den; The whippoorwill beguiled the hours With tender lay in leafy bowers, Rejoicing that the time of dews Had blotted out the sunset hues, While stars, in absence of the sun, Shot forth in beauty, one by one, And bathed in rich, romantic sheen, The tops of pine and hemlock green, And gave a soft, transparent glow, To slumbering Ontario. XVIII. The sentry on his lonely post Moved to and fro with iron tramp; And the loud tumult of the host Grew fainter in the guarded camp; The wearied conscript, young in years, Torn from his native vale with tears To mingle in the war-array, From home and hearth-stone far away, In dreams of his paternal cot The miseries of life forgot: Heard the glad vintagers again Chant gayly some old peasant strain, While gleaning clusters from the vine, Or pressing out the crimson wine. Once more, in visions of repose, The distant village spire arose, And on his ear with soothing, fell The monotone of evening bell. Again he tried his vaunted speed With jocund brothers, on the mead, And marked his sister, young and fair, Plait garlands for her flowing hairâ Met that devoted maid once more, Who wildly wept from him to sever, And by the Star of Lovers swore To prove unfaithful never. Once more the smiling dreamer heard That being breathe familiar word, Who watched his infancy, and made A pillow of her breast for him; And thought her care would be repaid, By fond caress and filial aid, When her mild eye grew dim. Beneath his own unclouded skies, Scenes of historic glory spread, And back came early memories Like phantoms of the deadâ The huge chateau of other days, Proud object of his childish gaze, Uplifted as in former hours Its moss-grown battlements and towers; And entering deserted halls Through fissures in the leaning walls, The wild winds sang in hollow tone Of valor fled, and beauty gone. XIX. Extended, too, on couch of earth The veteran of proven worth, A fleeting visit paid in sleep To kindred o'er the tossing deep. Nigh graves, wherein his fathers slept, The Loire in silver windings swept, And gladly he beheld once more The hamlet where they dwelt of yore. The blood ran quicker through his frame, When loved ones shouted out his name, And that poor wife, who pining long Breathed snatches oft of mournful song, And nightly prayed, on bended knee, That God would stretch protecting arm, And guard by land, or whelming sea, Her absent mate from harmâ Right toward him came on flying feet, Her wedded lord once more to greet, While chubby lads, in gay attire, Laughed welcome to their war-worn sire. XX. While thus the dreaming soldier lay, Rude pillow of his knapsack making, Regardless that the coming day Might bring repose that knows no waking, Paced hurriedly within his tent A chieftain of the armament; Erect he moved, though on his head The frost of sixty years was spread, And well his martial dress became The fine proportions of his frame. His helm and corslet, soiled and worn, The brunt of many frays had borne; And blazing badge upon his breast, His knighthood and his rank expressed. No pleasant vision of delight To lull his soul, was brought by night, And slumber o'er him waved in vain The wand of her quiescent reign. His brow contracted to a frown, Blanched cheek and gloomy eye cast down, Unerringly bespoke a man Whose thoughts in gloomy currents ranâ Who vengefully had brooded long O'er deep and unforgiven wrong, With heart corroded to its core By bitter memories of yore. At last a sudden pause he made, And hand upon his dagger laid; For indistinctly on his ear Came the low sound of footsteps nearâ Then from the hilt his hand withdrew, As the dark form of one he knew Strode through an opening in the tent; And on his visitant he bent A searching, anxious glance, and criedâ âWhat tidings, father, of my child? Speak, for my brain is waxing wild!â âShe lives!â the Jesuit replied. âAnd her betrayer?â âSoon will feel The temper of avenging steel.â âWhere lurks the fiend of perjured soul, Who came in human guise and stole The young and last surviving flower That grew in my domestic bower? Left on my honorable name The mildew of eternal shame, Then made my fond, old heart the tomb Of bliss and expectation fair, And peopled its sepulchral gloom With tiger-passions and despair.â XXI. The maid and her seducer dwell With that fierce tribe we wish to quell: I wrung the tidings from a foe Caught near our lines an hour ago; For well I speak and understand The dialect of this wild land, And oft have borne the cross among The natives of this valley bright And won by soft, persuasive tongue Full many a tawny proselyte. Though words of vengeance you may deem Unsuited to my calling meek; That holy types but ill beseem The glow of hatred on my cheek; You will not marvel when you hear The tale I breathe into your ear, That memories of hoarded wrong Within my bosom also throngâ Wrong that the blood of cursed De Grai Alone can heal or wash away. The hunter following the stag, May faint with weariness, and lagâ The dove in airy speed may balk Her swooping enemy the hawkâ The timid lamb may shelter find, When the gaunt night-wolf howls behindâ The bandit may his cavern gain, While baffled huntsmen search in vain; But never yet did foe escape, When foot of mine was on his track, Though peril, in appalling shape, Stood in the path to warn me back. XXII. I know your ancient castle well, That overlooks the blue Moselle, And envied, when a puny boy, The wealth and titles of Le Troye; For though my rude and peasant sires Were humble servitors of thine, Ambition never kindled fires Within a prouder heart than mine. Oft, oft in dreams of high renown, While sitting by the rustic hearth, My soul would for a season drown Desponding thought of lowly birth; But memory her eye would ope, And crush the radiant flowers of Hope, Convert my fabrics, frail and fair, To empty, unsubstantial air. Long nights of toil, and weary days, I strove to win scholastic bays, A miner in the well of Truth, Unmindful of the sports of youth; But lacking patronage and gold, The fervor of my brain grew cold. In after years when Gaul awoke, And urged her nobles to the field, A gleam upon the darkness broke, And gory paths to fame revealed. O'er musty books of ancient lore My mounting spirit loved to pore In monkish idleness no more; I heard the warning bugle blow, And saw the greeting winds untwine The banner of your ancient line And liegemen to the muster go, With pulses panting for the foe; Then buckling on a rusted blade, Went, like my sires, your House to aid. XXIII. Sir Knight, at times, bethink you not Of that young soldier of your corps, Who on the field of Cassel fought, And through a storm of fire and shot The tattered colors bore, Snatched by his daring from the plain When the bold bannerman was slain? âHa! by the saints,â said old Le Troye, âYour voice reminds me of that boy! Is not your true address, Mordaunt?â No! but the stripling was my friend, And found a dark, untimely end; Oft comes, my midnight couch to haunt, His spectre, colorless and gaunt, And vengeance goads me like a spur, To find and slay his murderer. XXIV. I well remember that you made Mordaunt upon the field your aid; And wondering that one so brave Was in the vernal time of life, Presented him your own good glaive, Yet red and reeking with the strife. When wearied, to your broad domain Retainers were led back again, Your daughter, full of grace and fair, Came ambling on her palfrey fleet, With diamonds flashing in her hair, A father and his troop to greet; And that she fixed admiring gaze On the young hero by your side, While prodigal of smiles and praise You told her of his valor triedâ How in the melee of the fight He wrested from a dead-man's hold The gonfalon no longer bright, And waved on high its ragged fold; I well remember that a shout From bearded lips rang gayly out, When lightly from her snowy neck A chain of gleaming gold she took, The chivalrous Mordaunt to deck, And told him, with a downcast look, To keep the bauble as a meed From woman for heroic deed. XXV. You gave the favorite a place In the proud castle of your race And mortal cannot deem it strange That one thus raised from low estate Should undergo a sudden change While mingling with the Great; Or marvel that the stripling grew Elated and presumptuous tooâ Forgetful in his dream of fame, That his was not a titled name, And that his fathers, like mine own, Were heirs to poverty alone. The Lady Blanche, your peerless child, Upon the beardless minion smiled, And chose him from the waiting train, To gallop at her bridle rein, And be her page in bower and hall, A post of honor craved by all. XXVI. She used, when pensive twilight brought Sweet moments of romantic thought, To hear him wake the warbling lute, And to her mood the measure suitâ Unknowing that a word of praise, When ended were his glowing lays, In rich, impressive accent spoken, Would nurse an overdaring dream, And to the blinded minstrel seem Of her regard a thrilling token. Warmed by her smile, with vig'rous start, First love upgrew within his heart, Like flower matured by tropic sun; And spurning bonds of weak control, The crowning passion of his soul Wild mastery of reason won; And in a luckless hour he made Rash proffer of his heart and hand, And only found, when prostrate laid, That his high hopes were based on sand. Your daughter heard the youth avow His feelings with an angry brow, And in a tone of blighting scorn, Styled her adorer âlowly born,â And bade him stoop his towering head To woo a bride in cottage bred, But never, in enamored strain, Address a noble maid again. XXVII. Changed was his bearing from that hour; He sought no more her chosen bower, To cull some precious token-flower. One eve I met him on the road Conducting to my rude abode, And face again, so sad and pale, I pray I never may behold, While mournfully to me his tale Of unrequited love he told. His lute, to notes of joy once strung, Became a cold, neglected thing, And the dark, crawling spider hung Her web-work on each rusted stringâ He heard delightedly no more Her footstep on the marble floor; But think not that he grew remiss In formal homage due her rank, Though his crushed soul rich draught of bliss No longer in her presence drank; Thenceforth her dark and lustrous eye Could not dissolve his apathyâ Thenceforth her voice, harp-like and clear, Its sweetness wasted on his earâ To him she was a prize withdrawn, No more to rouse to high endeavorâ A morning star of beauty gone From Love's delicious sky forever. XXVIII. Fresh in remembrance is the day, When, clad in glittering garb, De Grai, A young and reckless cavalier, Came from the camp, invited guest, Within your ancient hall to rest, And share its hospitable cheer. His figure was of perfect mould, And with the nobler wealth of mind, Uncounted heaps of yellow gold, And broad, rich acres were combined. In his gay look, observer caught No outward sign of guilty thought, Although the callous soul within Was foul with darkest deeds of sinâ His winning courtesy of air, And eloquence, were suited well The heart of woman to ensnare, And kindle perilously there The flame of love unquenchable; His ancestors held feudal sway When France was in her younger day, And last was he of his proud line; For on the hoof-beat battle plain, His sire, a bosom friend of thine, While rushing to the charge, was slain. Though young, with many a trusting maid, The part of traitor he had played, And deeply taught in arts to lure From paths of innocence the Pure; The wretch, insensible to shame, Could well the hollow promise frame; While his poor victim could not brook To harbor blighting thought, the while, That his sincerity of look Masked ruin, perjury and guile. Your daughter was a gem too bright To flash untarnished in his sight; A flower too innocent in dye To lift its blushing charms on high, Unnoted by his dooming eye. âOh, spare me the recital dread Of what ensued!â the Baron said;â âOh, better had she kept aloof From the foul fiend beneath my roof, Or like some bird by serpent charmed, That breaks the dreadful spell ere harmed, In time to shun disgrace have fled From the dark mesh the monster spread; But, ah, an unsuspecting heart By craft is easily enchained, And soon his deep seductive art The pearl of her affections gained! At first I saw in young De Grai A daughter's honorable choice, And heard, with doubting and dismay, The whisper of a friendly voice.â XXIX. Rejoined the priest, in husky tone, Whiter his cheek than pale tomb-stoneâ âMordaunt that horrid warning spoke, And tumult in your bosom woke; Then eager Blanche Le Troye to save From doom more dreadful than the grave, You drove the recreant from your door, And with a look that menaced strife, Forbade him cross its threshold more, On peril of his limb and life; But could not make the doomed one think That he had plotted her undoing, And that she stood upon the brink Of shameful, everlasting ruin: Thrice blest are they who only shed Tears for the unpolluted deadâ Who mark the rounded mould above The children of their hope and love, In contrast with that wretched sire Whose sorrow is consuming fire, Who mourns an erring daughter driven From bliss on earth, from home in heaven! One night, tempestuous and wild, In secret fled your hapless child, And when the morrow came, you heard From fond lip fall no greeting word: Her form was missing in the hall, Her palfrey absent from the stallâ A glove upon the marble stair Had fallen from her fingers fair, And near the castle gate were found Fresh hoof-marks on the sandy ground, Disclosing palpably to sight That Blanche was not alone in flight. XXX. Alarum notes from turret bell Were wafted over lawn and dell, And bold dependents of the soil, Well trained to arm for sudden fray, Threw by their implements of toil, That martial summons to obey. Still like a trumpet in mine ear, Your cry of eager haste I hearâ âOutspeed the beagle on the track, And dead, or living, bring her back! But leave behind a mangled corse, The partner of her crime.âTo horse!â Then loud the clash of armor rang, And horsemen on their coursers sprang, And in pursuit, with dangling rein, Swept like a blast across the plain. Up hills precipitous and steep, And over rivers dark and deep, Through sombre wood and winding dell, Plied were the scourge and rowel well. XXXI. In vain for many leagues they sped, The fugitives were far ahead; And long ere night the troop came home, Faint and exhausted from the chase, On jaded chargers, white with foam, And lagging in their pace; But that poor youth did not return Who bravely led them forth at morn; For written was his vow on high To save an erring maid, or die. On, on he urged his noble brute When followers gave o'er pursuit: Night, hunger, and a pathway dim, Were no impediments to himâ His heart was proof to peril dire; What recked he of the set of sun? From Lust, to glad a frantic sire, An angel must be won; And nerved by thoughts like these, his steed With spur he pushed to headlong speed. Weeks flew, and in her lonely cot A mother's heart grew sick and sore; In vain she mourned her bitter lotâ Mordaunt, the valiant, came no more; But haply, ere his fall was known, Hushed was her broken-hearted moan, âIf aught of him you know, relate! Long have I sought to learn his fateââ Quoth old Le Troye in anxious tone. XXXII. A few months after, I became A convert to Loyola's creed, And tired like him of phantom fame, Kissed crucifix and counted bead; The duties of my holy sphere My steps conducted far and near. One day, (the sun was nearly set,) A peasant in Lorraine I met: Clouds, black with storm, were in the skyâ No cheering hostelry was nigh, And fain, belated on my way, Was I beneath his roof to stay; For with a troubled look he told Of traveller shot down for gold, Of danger lurking in the road, And midnight murderer abroad. âNot long ago,â cried he, âmy dream Was broken by a dismal scream, Preceded by a pistol shot; And darting wildly from my cot, I heard, while flesh grew chill with fright, The clattering of hoofs in flight. Next morn, upon the beaten ground, A stranger cold in death I foundâ The ball, with fatal aiming speed, Had made deep lodgment in his headâ And his dark locks, all stiff with gore, The passing wind could lift no more. His brow was frowning, and a brand Clung to the unrelaxing hand; While reckless all of rider slain, A steel grazed near with broken rein, Black as the midnight's darkest dyes, Save a white star between his eyes; Who, when we strove to catch him, ran As if he spurned the rule of man. XXXIII. âWithout exhorting priest or pall, We gave the stranger burial; And on the spot where he is laid A waving elm throws pleasant shade. His hat, pierced by the fatal ball, And vestments, hang on yonder wall, And from his rigid neck and cold, I took this costly chain of gold.â Before he told the story out, My brain was free from darkening doubt; For, added to the chain and garb, His faithful picture of the barb Mordaunt's unhappy exit left, Of dread uncertainly bereft. XXXIV. His relics from their bloody shroud For retribution called aloud, And thinking of the friendly band That erst our hearts in love allied, Asunder by a ruthless hand Divided at untimely tide, I tasked my energies to trace The reeking author of the crime. Like bloodhound to his lurking place; And Havre sought, but not in time, A bark to view in full career, Bound to another hemisphere, From kindred, home and country bear De Grai and his companion fair. XXXV. Across a broad expanse of sea The coward-murderer may flee, And finding covert, dark and rude, May baffled justice long elude. Aye! even trust that lapse of days Will dim remembrance of his guilt; That man again will kindly gaze, Forgetful of the blood he spilt; But soon or late, the gory deed Will awful punishment succeed; The dark assassin of Mordaunt Feels safe within his greenwood haunt, And little deems the coming day Will guide avengers on their way. The cheering thought sustains his soul, A thousand leagues of water roll Between me and the slain; And that old father, gray with years, Who mourns a daughter lost, while tears Bedew his cheek like rain,â Poor self-beguiler! o'er his head The sable wing of death is spread, And Vengeance, with his dooming eye, And sharp, unsparing blade, is nighâ Soon, soon from the gloom of its scabbard to dart And drink the last drop of his recreant heart! XXXVI. Enough of prating!âon the hill, The tall old evergreens are still, And the south wind no longer weaves Gay roundelay amid the leaves, Or flies the dreaming wave to curl, By moonlight changed to liquid pearlâ No rustling whisper, from the reeds That fringe yon marshy bay, proceeds, And in primeval groves around There is a transient death of sound. The howling beast of prey hath made His meal of carnage in the shade, And sought long since his dark retreat, Crackling the brush beneath his feet. I, too, must find a rugged bed, For the mid-hour of night hath fledâ Throughout my frame I slowly feel A drowsy, numbing torpor steal, And as we march by morning light, Our limbs require reposeâGood Night!

If hallowed by Love's presence bright, a home Far in the wild is more to be desired Than gorgeous chambers of a royal dome, Where restless hearts, by envy ever fired, Throb in proud breast, where joyance hath expired; Mine be the hut, if there affection dwells, Though meanly be its occupants attired; For the blind Deity hath wondrous spells That fill with golden light Earth's worst receptacles. I. The rosy pencillings of dawn On a pleasant sky were clearly drawn, And changed the clouds of the orient grew From dull gray tint to a golden hue. The distant top of the wooded height Was edged with a rim of tender light, And thicket, fountain, rock and tree From cloudless sun a radiance drank, While washed the rapid Genesee, With reddened wave the crumbling bank. The clasping vine on the river shore, Twined round the ponderous sycamore; And near, in strange confusion piled, Lay fallen giants of the wild, Decaying marks of ages flown, By the fierce tornado overblown: On the grassy brink thick willows grew, And gloom on the passing current threw, While pensile boughs hung down to lave Their pale green leaves in the gurgling wave; On the long unbroken ridge above, The walnut, oak, and maple spread Their knotted, barky arms, and wove A dark pavilion overhead: Beyond, encircled by the grove, A glade lay basking in the light, Like an emerald gem in the locks of night, And the fresh and unpolluted earth To flowers of an hundred hues gave birth. Such haunt the dreaming bards of old Chose for the fay his court to hold, From din of crowded mart afar, When the moon was in her diamond car; And a being of celestial mien Was moving on its carpet green, Bright as the fabled Fairy-queen:â But her cheek with sorrowing was pale, Nor could the breath of morning dry, Or the vivid beam of day exhale The tear-drop in her dark blue eye. II. A zone of brilliant damask graced Her delicate and rounded waist, Confining, in its clasping fold, Her bodice by a brooch of gold. The comb amid her auburn curls Was beautiful with studding pearls, And the costly texture of her dress Was passing strange in a wilderness. The proud bird of the cliff had shed, To grace the bonnet on her head, The richest plumage of its wings; And, magnet of admiring eyes, She would have borne the dazzling prize Of beauty in the hall of kings. III. Contrasting with her paler charms, White neck, fair cheek, and snowy arms, An Indian maiden by her side Moved with an air of native pride, Clad in rich robe of otter-hide. Her features were of swarthy dye, But darker was her tameless eye, And wavy tresses, thick and black, Hung unrestrained adown her back, The fawn had yielded up its skin To form her velvet moccasin; The bird of fire and noisy jay, To fringe her dress, their feathers gay; And her cheek was bright with lively stains, Redder than blood in her branching veins. Large beads were pendent from her ear, Strung on the pliant thew of deer; And on her bosom brightly shone An amulet of mystic stoneâ âAmong a people in the infancy of reflection and improvement, the deities themselves are not so much the objects of attention, as the great changes and revolutions of nature, to which they are conceived to give rise. To avert the calamities which threaten them, is, therefore, the chief concern of the rude tribes scattered over the American continent. âIn order to effectuate this purpose, they have not recourse, as among nations more civilized, to prayers and penance, offerings and victims; but to charms, amulets, and incantations, which are fancied to have the power of saving them from all events of a disastrous nature.â Edinburg Encyclopedia, vol. 1, p. 597. The gift of venerated seer, To guard her form in the darkest hour, From spirits fraught with evil power, Who ride on the pinions of the breeze To breed the tempest, blight the flower, And taint frail mortals with disease IV. âCease, daughter of the Rising Sun! Lamenting for thy little one! The Land of fadeless verdure now Is gladdened by his sunny brow; Beyond the gulf of death, he smiles, Inhabitant of Happy Isles; But, vanishing like April snow, A few more years will come and go, And mother and her babe again Will meet where ties break not in twain.â While in her glance soft pity shone, Thus in wild, sweet, condoling tone, The maid of deep black eye and hair Addrest the lady, sad and fair, Who answeredââYester-eve the spot Grim wood-wolves had molested not; But dread the change since yester-eveâ Can I do otherwise than grieve?â Then, to another Continent, In thought the pale young mourner went, Till rose before her mental sight, Home's ancient hall, and landscape bright; While strains, consorting with her woe, Gushed from her lips in warbling low. V. SONG. 1. There is a lordly castle A vine-clad hill that crowns; All darkly its stern battlement Upon the valley frowns! And from its ancient window, My father, old and gray, Perchance, in grief and loneliness, Is looking forth to-day. 2. In vain close watch he keepeth; For on her native shore, The foot of one he loveth Will lightly tread no more. The cup that he is drinking, Is drugged with shame and tears; And who will cheer the winter Of his declining years? 3. The grave hath won my mother, In strife my brothers fell, And when the old man dieth, No child will ring his knell. Oh, would that I had never Heard Love's beguiling lay, And fled with him in darkness âWho stole my heart away.â 4. There is a lordly castle That stands beyond the sea; And in the dreams of midnight Its towers appear to me: The cold and lonely chambers Seem peopled by the dead, And there my father boweth In grief his aged head. VI. Why wandered, in so wild a place, Descendant of a Christian race, From home of childhood, far away, Beyond the deep, and its tossing spray? Ask Love, wild lord, to whose control Woman resigns her trusting soul; Who tempts her by his wizard-spell, Against a parent to rebel, And hall of princely pomp exchange Within a land of bloom and sun, For wilderness, remote and strange, Protected by her chosen one, And in its trackless bosom share His cup of comfort or despair. VII. On the dark borders of the wood A lodge of rude construction stood, And, upward from its hearth, the smoke Rose, in blue wreaths, above the oak. The wild hop to its hanging eaves Clung with its prickly wealth of leaves; And poles, set firmly in the ground, With upright forks before the door, The weight of unhewn rafters bore; And honey-suckles twined around The sylvan framework, rough and low, Forming a verdant portico. Rare, blooming shrubs of forest land, Transplanted by a tasteful hand, On the smooth lawn in front were growing, Profusely round an odor throwing. The waving sumach, pride of bowers, And dogwood, white with snowy flowersâ Witch-hazle, spruce and sassafras Flung shadows on the velvet grass. A welling fount of water clear In rocky basin bubbled near, And air was vocal with the notes Of rustling leaves and warbling throats. The partridge beat his drum, and quail Rose in dense coveys from the swale; And, adding romance to the scene, The shambling elk shrill whistle gave, Dr. Smith says, âThe hunters assure us that the elk possesses the power, by strictly closing the nostrils, of forcing the air through these apertures (meaning a slit or depression below the inner angle of each eye, called by French naturalists larmiers,) in such a manner as to make a noise which may be heard at a great distance.â This, however, is inaccurate; it is true that the elk, when alarmed, or his attention strongly excited, makes a whistling noise at the moment these lachrymal appendages are opened, and vibrates in a peculiar manner. But having dissected these appendages in an elk, recently dead, we are perfectly assured that there is no communication between the nostrils of the animal and these sacs.â Godman's Natural History, vol. ii. p. 298. While breaking through the thicket green To plunge his muzzle in the wave. The squirrel, from his snug retreat, Came chattering on nimble feet; In quest of sweets, the house-wife bee Left her populous home in the hollow tree And morn of summer never smiled On brighter Eden in the wild. VIII. The lady, sorrowful and pale, Attended by the forest maid, Followed a narrow, beaten trail, Till reached the cot embowered in shade. Its creaking door was open thrown, When her foot drew near the threshold-stone; And forth a gallant hunter came, Accoutred for the chase of game. The pride of birth was in his bearing; His look denoted noble daring, And workmanship of foreign land Was the long carbine in his hand. A gay, green mantle, fringed with pelt, Was lightly round his person flung, And, from an ornamented belt, His silver-mounted dagger hung; His lip, sharp-cut and well-defined, Betokened a decisive mind; He bore, in haughty manhood's flower, Bold heart in hate or friendship warm, And elements of grace and power Commingled in his stately form. Browned by pursuits of war and chase Were the lower features of his face; But closely curled, his dark brown hair Lay shadowing a forehead fair. His full, gray eye that mildly gleamed, The brow's expression stern redeemed; Yet something told that wakened ire, From its dark depths, would call up fire. His mellow voice, not over-loud, Accorded with a form so proud, While questioned he his beauteous bride, In tone to deep concern alliedâ âThe cause of thy despondence tell! Hath aught our favorite befell, My peerless Blanche?â âAlas! we found The gift of Can-ne-hoot, the Chief,â Responded she in tones of grief, âBy wild-wolf mangled on the ground. To lifeless limb and silken throat, Clung dark red drops of clotted gore; My nimble fawn of dappled coat, Will glad its mistress' gaze no more, Or fly, on silver hoof of speed, From her caressing hand to feed.â âHah! the wan color of those cheeks A deeper source of woe bespeaks, Than loss of fondling in the shade, By forest prowler victim made; Why closely to thy bosom press That blossom of the wilderness?â IX. âThis flower,â replied his weeping spouse, âNow dying on my bosom, grew Beneath those melancholy boughs, More gloomy than sepulchral yew, That bar the daylight out, and wave Their leaves above our infant's grave. Some fierce, disturbing beast of prey Hath partly torn the mound away; The piping storm hath overthrown The mossy, rude memorial-stone; And the brown, desecrating mole In the loose soil hath dug his hole; While near, the terror-waking snake Darts, coils, and rattles in the brake I saw no pleasant sunlight fall On the cold sod of burial, And wept, as if my heart would break, While strove kind Wun-nut-hay, The Beautiful. in vain, To smooth the broken sod again, And ranged the wild for flowers to spread, In dewy wreaths, above the dead; For well we know, though dark her skin, A generous soul abides within.â X. The hunter spoke not in reply, But on his wife gazed tenderly; And memories came back, unsealing The bitter fount of mournful feeling, While sob and trembling lip confessed The father waking in his breast. He thought of vaults across the brine, That held the dead of his lofty lineâ Of hiding palls of gorgeous fold, And coffins rich in plated gold; Then sighed to think his only child Lay sepulchred in noteless mould, Dim with the shadows of the wild, And printed by the paw of beast In quest of his grim, revolting feast. He tried, but bootless was the task, Drear Sorrow's outward sign to mask; For his manly heart within him melt,â Though armed with enduring strength, he felt. He turned, at length, to find relief, In woodland sports, from haunting grief, When warning hand, by the Indian maid, Was lightly on his shoulder laid, While a warrior from the wood emerged, On by some pressing errand urged, Who traced with swift, but noiseless tread, A trail to his cottage-home that led. XI. âOn-yit-ha Seneca for Night-Hawk. comes,â the maiden said: âI know him by his bounding tread, And figure like the cedar proud That springs upon the mountain-headâ His face, more dark than midnight-cloud When the Great Spirit speaks aloudâ His toughened battle-bow, And arrows bound by fearful tether, The skin of rattle-snake together, Many tribes of the continent, particularly the New-England Indians, were in the habit of sending messengers to kindred nations on the eve of battle with a common enemy, bearing a sheaf of arrows bound together by the skin of the rattlesnake. The rude symbol was an invitation to dig up the hatchet. Are signs of war and woe!â XII. âHow fares my brother?â said De Grai, When nearer the young chieftain drew; âWhy, armed and belted for the fray, Comes he with brow of sable hue?â Response the warrior of the shade, With startling emphasis, thus made: âWhite robbers from beyond the sea, And tribesmen of Algonquin-stock, Thick as the long grass on the lea, And eager for the battle-shock, Have boldly landed on our soil; But vain will prove their dreams of spoil! Fierce, lurking messengers of wrath, Dark, deadly serpents in their path, 'Mid leaves and brush will coil.â Lured by the chase from home away, My sire and I paced yesterday Blue Ca-da-rac-qui's strand, And saw the foe in big canoes, Near the dim hour of falling dews, In fearful numbers land. Homeward I hurried with the news, And soon will wake the battle-yell; For borne hath been the signal-word, By our fleetest runner, to tribes that dwell Where the roar of the Upper Falls is heard. âAt Portageville, about fifteen miles from the angle at Caneadea, begin the great Portage Falls in this river. From the Upper Falls to Mount Morris and Squawkie Hill, a distance of sixteen miles, the river runs through a chasm, the sides of which are the greater part of the distance formed by solid and almost or quite perpendicular walls of rock, from two to four hundred feet high. In some places, however, these walls diverge so far from each other, as to allow spots of excellent alluvial flats to be formed on one side of the river or the other, and in some places on both. Immediately above the Upper Falls, there exists all the appearance of a ridge of rock having once run across the river, in which case it would have raised the water some two hundred feet above its present level, and of course formed a lake from one to two miles wide, and extending back over the Caneadea and other flats, to Belvidere, a distance of twenty-eight or thirty miles; but if ever this was the case, the river has centuries ago cut through this ridge and formed considerable rapids where it stood, above and opposite Portageville. The river, after apparently cutting through this ridge, precipitates itself into the chasm below, by a somewhat broken, although what would be termed perpendicular fall of sixty feet. The stream at this place is about twelve rods wide, after which it flows through a chasm on a smooth rock bottom. Half a mile below the Upper Falls, the river (where it is about fifteen rods wide) again precipitates itself, in an unbroken sheet, one hundred and ten feet perpendicularly into a deeper channel, forming the âMiddle Falls.â The magnificence and beauty of these falls are not exceeded by anything in the State, except the cataract of Niagara. On the west bank of the river at the top of the falls, is a small flat piece of land, o, rather rock, which can be approached down a ravine from the west, with any kind of carriage. The stream pursues its course in the same direction, pent within its rockbound and precipitous shores, about two miles, where it takes its third and last leap in this vicinity, of ninety-three feet, into a still deeper chasm; the greater body of water falling on the eastern side, where a portion of it falls into a kind of hanging rock basin, about one-third of the distance down, and then takes another leap. This fall can be approached on the east side by pedestrians with perfect safety. The river then pursues its north-eastern course through its deep and narrow channel to Gardow Flats, about five miles from the lower falls. The banks of the river, or rather the land bordering on the chasm, the greater portion of this distance, is covered with elegant white and Norway pines.â Mix. All the fighting men of remote Gardow, And braves from Ton-ne-wan-da's stream, Round the council-fire are gathering now, While scalp-locks wave, and weapons gleam; And thither, if the red man's friend, Will On-yit-ha's adopted brother wend. The mighty War-God of my race âIl paroit, madame, que dans ces chansons on invoque le dieu de la guerre, que les Hurons appellent Areskoui et les Iroquois Agreskoue. Je ne sais pas quel nom on lui donne dans les langues Algonquines.â âL'Areskoui des Hurons et l'Agreskoue des Iroquois est dans l'opinion de ces peuples le souverain etre et le Dieu de le Guerre.â Charlevoix, iii. 207â344. Calls on his children the danger to face; For thus to old seers spoke his terrible voice:â âExpecting grim banquet, the ravens rejoice; Up, up with the hatchet, long rusting in clay, And wash, in red waters, the rust-stain away!ââ XIII. The lady heard the tidings dread, With hand upon her forehead prest, As if to lull its throb to rest; Then, in despairing accent, saidâ âHas Earth no place of bloom and light, Where Peace may spread her wing of white? No pleasant isle, amid the sea, Where mortal finds not misery? I nursed a pleasant dream that here Our lives away would gently glide, Like summer currents, calm and clear, That meet no rocks in their career, While mingling in one peaceful tideâ That virgin-charms, unknown to France, In this New World would woo the glance But vainly have we reared yon cot, Environed by the mossy wild; For sorrow, in thy greenest spot, Oh Earth, attends a thankless child! The little prattler, on whose face A husband's image I could trace, Was early torn from my embrace! And now the men of blood are nigh, With battle-smoke to hide the sky, And drive us from our forest-home, Like animals of chase to roam. Ah! since that dark and stormy night Of hurried and clandestine flight, When filial duty tried in vain Lost sway from tyrant-Love to gainâ And, reckless of the dreadful ire, And curse of imprecating sire, I scourged my palfrey, fleet as wind, And left ancestral towers behind, No sunbeams on my path have shoneâ My heartâmy heart no quiet known! Though deep my guilt, and dark my lot, Thy bride, De Grai, rebukes thee not; For on the suitor for his child, A father fondly gazed, and smiled, Till the black falsehood of my page Changed his encouragement to rage. I loved thee then, and love thee still, Bright object of my girlish dream! For herbless waste, or land of ill, Would Eden, thou beside me, seem.â XIV. In tone of cheerfulness replied The hunter to his weeping brideâ âLet shadows from thy troubled heart, Like mist before the morn depart; And trust in Him who reigns above, Though now the sky is overcast, For green, unfading home of love, And days of sunny calm at last. Though soon will wake to fearful life The rushing hurricane of strife, And bathe in blood the sinless flowers That bloom in these primeval bowers, Mine arm, while weapon it can wield, Will buckler prove to thee, and shield; And angels, if I fall, will bear To Providence my dying prayer, And He will guard his stricken child Amid the perils of the wild.â XV. âThanks, dearest, for thy words of cheer! They fill with melody mine ear; And, hushing stormy doubt to rest, Give birth to hope within my breast. Oh God! forgive a thing of dust, Who, in a dark, desponding hour, In Thee forgot to place her trust, Unmindful of thy saving power. Though black the welkin overhead, Thine eye the light of joy can shed; Though whelming surges round me roll, Thy whisper can becalm my soul, And change the thunders of the sea To low and lute-like melody.â XVI. On the blue sky, with face upraised, One moment brief, the lady gazed; No cloud was on her forehead fair, Fled were the shadows of despair, And her bland countenance, the while, Was lighted by a holy smile; As if she read of sin effaced, In bright, celestial letters traced, And heard, though darkly-born of earth, The melody of golden lyres, While creatures of immortal birth Woke sweetly the transporting wires. On-yit-ha, though untamed and rude, On the fair daughter of old France, In hushed and graceful attitude, Fixed his admiring glance; And Wun-nut-hay, his forest-dove, Gazed on her with a look of love, While the proud husband, to her side Advancing with a rapid stride, His arm affectionately threw Around her neck of snowy hue. XVII. âBetake thee to thy favorite spot, Yon vine-hung arbor near the cot, Where, guarded from the summer heat, Is rudely framed a rustic seat, And the wild cherry-tree in bloom Gives out a delicate perfume: There, blithely in the cooling shade, A garland for thy temples braid, Or watch the hum-bird while around The rose he wheels with buzzing sound, Or list while gentle Wun-nut-hay Narrates some legend, strange and old, To speed the weary hours away, Of gifted seer and sachem bold. Hence to the council-fire I go, Where, planning ruin for the foe, Old Can-ne-hoot and chiefs convene; The name of the Indian hero, who figures in the author's poem, belongs to the stirring history of the period, though poetical license has been taken in ending his career with the battle; for he was present at a general council of the confederates holden at Onondaga, in January, 1690, as appears by the following extract from Thatcher. âCan-ne-hoot, the Seneca Sachem, next proceeded to give the council a particular account of a treaty made during the summer previous, between his own tribe and the Wayunhos.â My homeward whistle will be heard, Ere twilight warns the roving bird To mossy perch in forest green. Why look around with timorous eye, As if the day of doom was nigh, The fierce invader close at hand? Between him and our cabin lie Full many roods of forest-land: And ere his banner courts the gale That oversweeps this beauteous vale, And the wood-warblers flee afar, Scared by the thunder-tones of war, I will provide a still retreat, And thither, Blanche, conduct thy feet.â XVIII. In haste the hunter breathed adieu; Then, guided by On-yit-ha, cross'd The level glade, and passing through The archway of the grove, to view In leafy gloom was lost. The forester his path pursued, With look cast down in musing mood: He paused not when his careless tread Awoke the glittering copper-head; Nor did his deadly carbine ring When bounded by the bleating doe, And the wild crane, on heavy wing, Rose from still pond, in dingle low. Unnoted by his glance, the bear Went growling to his distant lair: Dark thoughts, a melancholy train, And sting of self-reproach, we fain Once felt, would never feel again, Within his heart's most deep recess Unsealed the spring of bitterness. XIX. âAlone the blame fall on my head!â Communing with himself he said; âI lured her from a sunny clime, Bright with the wrecks of olden time, The luxuries of titled Pride, And vineyards on each green hill-side; Attendants waiting on her word, Clad in the livery of their lord; Her favorite bower, and castled dome, Amid the cultured fields of Gaul, With me across the sea to roam, And told her that a forest-home Was brighter than a father's hallâ That fruits would blush on every tree, And air be fraught with melodyâ That life would prove one summer-morn Fragrant with blossoms newly-born, While Heaven would weave for us a charm To banish ill and ward off harm. Alas! the love of womankind, How deep, how lasting, but how blind! She laughed with joy, believing true The portraiture of bliss I drew, Foreseeing not a father wear For her the crimson blush of shame; Affliction whitening his hair, And scandal busy with her name.â XX. Thus communed with himself De Grai, Proceeding on his woodland-way, Until a loud, long, fearful cry Awoke him from his revery; And searchingly he fixed his glance On the red warrior in advance, Who stood, like form of sculpture rare, With face directed toward the river, And scalp-lock-fluttering in the air, And shaft drawn partly from the quiver. Again that startling cry was heard, By mimicking the cry of beast or bird, known to frequent the place from which the sound proceeds, an Indian scout communicates good or evil tidings to his tribe; when a party of warriors stop on their route to lie in ambush for enemies they understand to be out against them, they range themselves cautiously on both sides the expected path, frequently in a half moon line, and as far apart as they can hear the travelling signal from each other, which is either a low whistle, or cry of some wild creature of the woods imitated with surprising accuracy. See Adair and Charlevoix. Harsh as the croak of carrion-bird, When prey, long watched, expires at last, Alluring to a red repast; And far more dismal than the scream Of the fierce panther in the night; When the bold hunter, from his dream Amid the leaves, his sylvan bed, Wakes with a shudder of affright, And scans the broad boughs overhead, Expecting momently to feel The mangling tush, and claw of steel. XXI. âPale brother, haste!â On-yit-ha said, And grasped convulsively his bow,â âOur runner, with impatient tread, Brings tidings of the ruthless foe: Haste! for the soil beneath our feet, Ere morrow ends, may blush with gore, And bosoms that now warmly beat, Pierced by the victor, throb no more; That shout, still ringing in the dell, Announces woeâI know it well!â De Grai pursued his tawny guide With fleeter foot and longer stride; The swamp they threaded, and around Impenetrable thickets wound, Whose solemn depths of twilight-gloom Day could not enter, and illume; Nor paused the savage scene to view, While the dread warning louder grew: Then crossing streams, obscure with shade, Haunts by the lonely heron made, And where the wood-duck reared her brood In deep, unbroken solitude, Reached a broad opening in the wood. XXII. Fair was the scene!âbefore the gaze Lay verdant fields of twinkling maize, Bared to the full bright blaze of day; And meads, to charm romantic eye, Whereon the grass was thick and high, Spread their green carpets far away. Oft had the youthful Chevalier Paused, in pursuit of antlered deer, That fairy landscape to behold, Charmed by the painted tribe of flowers, Frail offspring of June's laughing showers, And Nature's richest mould: But heeding not its beauties now, He hurried on with heated brow, And sent, though on enchanted ground, No glance of admiration round. Tall orchards, near the river shore, The germs of bright abundance bore; The remains of an extensive Indian orchard may still be seen on the western bank of the Genesee. The wind-bowed and mossy trunks have a desolate appearance, as if they shared in the miseries of the race who planted them. The early settlers of Avon, discovered peach-trees growing in the forest on the site of an old corn-field of the Indians, the fruit of which was of good flavor. And, farther on, in clusters dark, Stood many cone-like huts that sent, From open roofs of cedarn bark, Blue smoke wreaths toward the firmament. Though in the school of Vauban trained, De Grai had often wielded lance, And his fierce charger sternly reined On the red battle-field for France, The scene before him in his soul Roused a deep dread that mocked control. XXIII. A rugged structure, low and long, A few years since, the council-house at Cannewaugus, was standing. When last visited by the author, it was in a state of decayâthe roof, overlaid with bark, was falling in, and the storm had partly beaten down the walls. The building was low and about sixty feet in length. In the centre of the roof, which was bark bent to a rounded form over the ridge pole, was an open place for the escape of smoke, when the elders of the tribe were convened in grave deliberation. The confederation of the Iroquois, stretching from the Hudson to Lake Erie, was often compared by their orators to a council-house. In the speech of condolence, addressed by the Mohawk chiefs to the inhabitants of Albany, after the destruction of Schenectady, the perfidy of the French is thus portrayed:ââBrethren, we do not think that what the French have done can be called a victory: it is only a farther proof of their cruel deceit; the Governor of Canada sent to Onondaga, and talks to us of peace with our whole house; but war was in his heart, as you now see by woful experience. He did the same, formerly at Cadaracqui, and in the Senecas' country. This is the third time he has acted so deceitfully. He has broken open our house at both ends; formerly in the Senecas' country, and now here. We hope, however, to be revenged of them.â Was circled by a savage throng, Armed, decked and painted for the fight; While sachem, seer, and chiefs of fame, To light the fire of council, came With brows more dark than night. A thousand scalp-locks, trimmed with care, Streamed like wild coursers' manes in air, When, riderless, they turn to fly: Dark, glowing eyes destruction breathed, And the long dagger was unsheathed, The hatchet whirled on high: The chich-hi-kon, full loudly blown, Gave out lugubrious monotone, The chichikon is formed of a thick cane upwards of two feet in length, with eight or nine holes, and a mouth-piece not unlike that of a common whistle. And drum of hollow block of oak And o'erdrawn hide of wild-deer made, Rung to the war-club's measured stroke, While the deep-booming music woke The sleeping echoes of the shade. XXIV. The weak and tottering old man, Whose arm was shrunken with decay, Roused by the tocsin of his clan, Grasped the dread implement of fray; And sternly moved amid the crowd, Forgetful that his form was bowed, And that his palsied limbs would fail, And falter on the battle-trail. XXV. The nimble stripling, who had thrown The tomahawk in sport aloneâ From the light echo of whose tread The timid mink would scarce have fledâ Who hitherto, on his young cheek, Had never worn war's clouded streak; Whose puny shaft had only drawn The blood of bird or bounding fawn,â Fired by the common danger, round His slender waist the war-belt bound, And, proudly for the conflict plumed, The bearing of the brave assumed. XXVI. Old spoils of victory, that long Had hung upon the wigwam wall, Forth by the tribe were brought with song Ancestral glory to recall, And kindle in the son desire To rival in renown his sire. Scalps from the fallen rudely torn, In smoke cured artfully, and dried, By wrinkled hags about were borne With gestures of ferocious pride. From some, on crimson hoop extended, Scalps preserved as trophies of victory, were cured, hooped, and painted by the Indians with marks on the flesh side expressive of the age and sex of the slain. In the letter of James Crawford to Col. Haldiman, Governor of Canada, appended to Stone's Life of Brant, is a description of eight packages of scalps taken by the Seneca Indians from the inhabitants of New York. To denote scalps taken from farmers killed in their houses, the skin was painted brown, and marked with a hoeâa black circle signified that they were surprised in the night, and a black hatchet in the middle that they were killed with that weapon. The hair on the scalps of the women was braided in the Indian fashion, to show that they were mothers. The hoops were blue, skin yellow ground, with little red tadpoles, to represent, by way of triumph, the tears of grief occasioned to their relations. Seventeen gray-haired scalps were stretched on black hoops of brown color, with no mark but the short club or cassetete, to show they were knocked down dead, or had their brains beaten out! The grizzly hair of age depended, And thick, coarse locks, unblanched by time, Of manhood butchered ere his prime: From others, in soft clusters, hung The silken ringlets of the young, And the long tress of golden grain That told of Christian mother slain. De Grai a look of horror cast On these sad records of the past, And felt a sense of terror tame The beating pulses of his frameâ An icy chill, one instant, stay Life's crimson current on its way. XXVII. Dark arms were menacingly raised, While on the hideous spoil he gazed:â Though Can-ne-hoot in peace had met The stranger form his country drivenâ Had smoked with him the calumet, And food and habitation given, His garb and face revealed him one Whose race were from the Rising Sunâ A subject of the âGrand Monarqueâ Whose disciplined and banded braves Were piercing forests, deep and dark, To awe their nation into slavesâ Then quench in blood their cabin-fires, And trample on the green old graves Of patriarchal sires. XXVIII. Amid that raging crew alone, Ill would the son of France have fared; For daggers, wrought of flint and bone, With fell intent were round him bared, The ancient dagger of the Senecas was an implement, shaped, with great labor, from bone and flint. The author is in possession of one made of the latter material, the blade of which, after swelling in the middle, tapers to a rugged point. Bone daggers have been found in Lima, Livingston County, by citizens while working on the highway, shaped with elegance, and elaborately polished. And knives, that Christian blood had shed, Described bright circles round his head: But the fierce natives of the wood, Though madly thirsting for his blood, From murderous assault forbore, Restrained by their young Sagamore, Who forced, through groups of warriors tall, A passage to the Council-Hall. END OF CANTO SECOND. CANTO THIRD. THE WAR DANCE. Wake, children of Genundewah! The tradition of the Seneca Indians, in regard to their birth, is, that they broke out of the earth from a large mountain at the head of Canandaigua Lake, and that mountain they still venerate as the place of their birth; thence they derive their name, âGe-nun-de-wah,â or Great Hill, and are called, âThe Great Hill People,â which is the true definition of the word Seneca. The great hill at the head of Canandaigua Lake from whence they sprung, is called Ge-nun-de-wah, and has for a long time past been the place where the Indians of that nation met in council, to hold great talks, and to offer up prayers to the Great Spirit, on account of its having been their birthplace; and also in consequence of the destruction of a serpent at that place in ancient time, in a most miraculous manner, which threatened the whole of the Senecas, and barely spared enough to commence replenishing the earth. The Indians say that the Fort on the Big Hill or Ge-nun-de-wah, near the head of Canandaigua Lake, was surrounded by a monstrous serpent, whose head and tail came together at the gate. A long time it lay there, confounding the people with its breath. At length they attempted to make their escape, some with their homminy-blocks, and others with different implements of household furniture; and in marching out of the fort, walked down the throat of the serpent. Two orphan children, who had escaped this general destruction by being left some time before on the outside of the fort, were informed by an oracle, of the means by which they could get rid of their formidable enemy; which was, to take a small bow and a poisoned arrow, made of a kind of willow, and with that shoot the serpent under its scales. This they did, and the arrow proved effectual; for on its penetrating the skin, the serpent became sick, and, extending itself, rolled down the hill, destroying all the timber that was in its way. At every motion a human head was discharged, and rolled down the hill into the lake, where they lie at this day in a petrified state, having the hardness and appearance of stones; and the pagan Indians of the Senecas believe that all the little snakes were made of the blood of the great serpent after it rolled into the lake. To this day the Indians visit that sacred place to mourn the loss of their friends, and to celebrate some rites that are peculiar to themselves. To the knowledge of white people there has been no timber on the Great Hill since it was first discovered by them, though it lay apparently in a state of nature for a great number of years, without cultivation. Stones in the shape of Indians' heads may be seen lying in the lake in great plenty, which are said to be the same that were deposited there at the death of the serpent.â Life of Mary Jemision. the cry Of fierce Invasion floats upon the gale; The spirits of the dead are rushing by, And white-haired seers are prophesying bale: The dove of peace hath left our lovely valeâ Great Yonnondio leads the host of France, And in the coming battle will prevail, If we neglect to sharpen knife and lance, And round the red post wheel, in war's terrific dance. Swear that the foe's insulting foot shall not On one green grave in triumph be impressed; For ever dear to brave men is the spot Where the white bones of their forefathers rest. The Land of Shadows, in the clear south-west, Hath hunting grounds known only to the just, And the red warrior of the dauntless breast: Snatch, then, the buried tomahawk from dust, And clothe its blade, once more, in battle's gory crust. I. De Grai, in Christian Court, had seen Anointed Louis on his throne, Clad in appareling whose sheen The lustre of the stars outshone, While the bold Barons of the land, Below him stood, a knightly band, With churchmen proud the crosier bearing, And dark, monastic vesture wearing; And less of awe, while liegemen knelt In presence of their monarch, felt, Than by old Can-ne-hoot, attired In shaggy toga, was inspired, While, proudly as became a king, Presiding in monarchal state, His glance surveyed the tawny ring Of counsellors that round him sate. II. Stern Time, in robbing form and face Of youthful symmetry and grace, Could not subdue his pride, or dim The hawk-like fierceness of his gaze; And brawny chest and iron limb Unwasted were by length of days: His lofty forehead was a page Rough with the wrinkling lines of age; His port majestical and proud, His form commanding and unbowed, Like some old oak, in ancient moss, And rough, indented rind encased, From whose gray trunk the vernal gloss Had many a lustrum been effaced; Still lifting loftily his head, Without one bough decayed or dead, Though many a howling storm had tried In dust to hurl his honors downâ Asunder rend his arms of pride, And scatter to the winds his crown. III. âThe bear-skin for Od-deen-yo White Chief. spread,â With courteous mien the sachem saidâ âThough scion of a race I scorn, And far beyond the Salt-Lake born; Though pale his face, like dogwood-flowers, And garb and language unlike ours, Fill with ke-nic-kee-nic the bowl! He is a Seneca in soul; For, sundering the filial band That bound him to his native land, Here, where the herding red-deer roam, With one fair flower he makes his home.â De Grai the seat assigned him took, With hesitating step and look; For murmurs ran the circle round, And many a warrior, gaunt and grim, His teeth, in half-hushed anger, ground, And scowled with fiendish hate on him. Some, from long pipes of purple stain Significant of battle, smoked; âThe calumet and all its ornaments, when they treat of war, are painted red. The size of the pipe and the degree of decoration correspond to the importance of the occasion.â Indian Wars. When war is contemplated, the tomahawk is also colored with red. And plumes that decked each stem of cane, Torn from the wild swan, owl and crane, In slaughter had been soaked; And others from their girdles drew Pipe tomahawks of sanguine hue, Adorned with shell and wampum-bead; And fragrant clouds rose blue and wreathed, While through the hollow haft they breathed The vapors of the weed. IV. On bosoms bare the figures rude Of wolf and eagle were tatoo'd; Each Indian nation has a distinct ensign, generally consisting of some beast, bird, or fish; and the pictures of these animals are pricked or painted on the arms or breast. The known mark of a tribe or chief on the person of a captive, is a protection from danger at other hands. Brant, at the destruction of Cherry Valley, saved a woman and her children by painting his cognizance upon them. See Stone's Life of Brant. âEach of the Five Nations is divided into three families of different ranks, bearing for their arms, and being distinguished by the names of the tortoise, the bear and the wolf.ââSmith. âSometimes the design of a military expedition is painted on the naked trunk of a tree. By a deer, a fox or some other emblems, we discover against what nation they are gone out.ââ Smith. And never knight of high descent, At joust or glittering tournament, Or on the trampled battle-field, While blood was emptied out like wine, Bore, on bright banneret and shield, The badge and motto of his line More proudly than each savage man The wild escutcheon of his clan. V. Linked with armorial signs that blaze On knightly armor of old days, Are tales of high achievement done, Great cities stormed, and conflicts won: Hence scion of a line renowned Feels eye dilate and pulses bound, When he beholds, with burning glance, His father's ancient cognizance: The red man boasts no herald-roll, But views, with equal pride of soul, The painted symbol on his skin Allied to memory of sires, Famed for their prowess, while within His bosom wakes heroic fires. Like them he pants for stirring deeds; In the swift chase the moose outspeeds; Directs with skill his birchen bark, Though wave be loud, and heaven be dark; And scorns to fly, though round him rise A myriad of enemies: He swears, like them, no fear to know When stake-bound by exulting foe; âIt is the first and the last study of the American Indians, to acquire the faculty of suffering with an obstinate and heroic courage when their fortitude is put to the proof. They harden their fibres by repeated trials, and accustom themselves to endure the most tormenting pain without a groan or a tear. In the northern division of the continent, a boy and a girl will put a flaming coal between their naked arms, and vie with one another in maintaining it in its place.â (Charlevoix III. 307.) âForbear,â said an aged chief of the Iroquois to the French Indians, âforbear these stabs of your knife; and rather let me die by fire, that those dogs, your allies, may learn, by my example, to suffer like men.â And though around his tortured frame In crimson volume rolls the flame, And his flesh shrivels like the grass When death-fires o'er the prairie pass, He breathes in that dread moment out, With taunting tone, his battle-shout; Recounts, while glorying in pain, The numbers he has scalped and slain, And chaunts, with faint, expiring breath, His stern, defying song of death. VI. Old Can-ne-hoot arose at last, And back his shaggy mantle castâ In the red girdle, round his waist, His fur tobacco-pouch replacedâ On the grim throng a moment gazed; Then, while his tinkling bracelets rung, His arm with grace unstudied raised, âThe speakers deliver themselves with surprising force, and great propriety of gesture. The fierceness of their countenances, the flowing blanket, elevated tone, naked arm, and erect stature, with a half circle of auditors seated on the ground, and in the open air, cannot but impress upon the mind a lively idea of the ancient orators of Greece and Rome.ââ Smith. And spoke thus in his woodland tongue:â VII. âVictors in many a forest fight, The bird of peace has taken flight! The tree in which she framed her nest, Smoothed the bright feathers on her breast, And tuned her throat to notes so clear That the keen hunter paused to hear, Is robbed of its majestic boughâ Is shorn of its broad, leafy shield; And from its trunk, dishonored now, Profaning hands the bark have peeled, And given to the naked wood The deep, terrific stain of blood. Oft, brothers, have the paths of war From home and country led us farâ The Twig-twee, in his distant wild, Our vow of vengeance heard, and smiled; But vainly was his good bow strung, While on the wind our war-cry rungâ As well might osier frail essay, The whirlwind on its march to stay, As tribe, who quaffs Miami's wave, Abide fierce onslaught of the brave. Our hatchet smote him on the head; Wild wolves upon his flesh have fed; Red, crackling flames devoured his cot; Pappoose and squaw, we spared them not. VIII. âOur muffled tread at midnight deep, The Huron heard not in his sleepâ Still as the dew by evening wept, We stole upon him while he slept; The knife, in darkness, pierced his side, The gore upon his scalp is dried. The prowling Eries of the Lake The career of victory which began with the fall of the Adirondacks, was destined to be extended beyond all precedent in the history of the Indian tribes. They (the Iroquois) exterminated the Eries or Erigas, once living on the south side of the lake of their own name. They nearly destroyed the powerful Anderstez, and the Chouanons or Showanons. They drove back the Hurons and Ottawas among the Sioux of the Upper Mississippi, where they separated themselves into bands, âproclaiming, wherever they went, the terror of the Iroquois.ââ Herrick. Our chain of friendship dared to break; The waters moan upon the shore, Their feet will print its sands no more. As flame consumes the yellow leaves, When the sad wind of autumn grieves, Their warriors perished in the fire Of our wild, unrelenting ireâ We took no captives, and their race Among the tribes have now no place: Well was the work of ruin done! Their bones bleach in the rain and sun; Hushed are the chase-grounds where they ranged; To ashes cold their huts are changed; Their bows are broken, and the deer, Unscared by shaft, is browsing near. IX. âRegardless of our ancient fame, Our conquests, and our dreaded name, Fierce Yonnondio and his band Are thronging in our forest-land. And ask ye why with banner spread His force the Frank hath hither led? We scorched with fire the skulking hounds Who dared to cross our hunting-grounds,â A trading, base, dishonest band, Who, in exchange for pelts, had given Guns, lead, and black explosive sand, To tribes our power had westward driven; The wise no vain distinction know Between sly fox who arms a foe, And hands that boldly deal the blow. X. âShall warriors who have tamed the pride Of rival nations, far and wide, At their own hearths be thus defied? Shall it be said the beast of prey His den abandoned far away, And, seeking out the hunter, found His aim less true, less deep the wound? Shall it be told in other days, The tomahawk we feared to raise, While the green hillocks, where repose The cherished dust of woodland-kings, Insulted by the march of foes, Gave back indignant echoings? Base is the bosom that will quake With one degrading throb of fear, When fame and country are at stake, Though an armed troop of fiends are near! Oh! never can such craven tread The happy chase-grounds of the dead; Between him and that fount of bliss Will yawn a deep and dread abyss; And doomed will be his troubled ghost To range that land forever more, Upon whose lone and barren coast The black and bitter waters roar. The clime of everlasting day, Where groves, all red with fruitage, wave, And beauty never fades away, Is only trodden by the brave.â XI. In answer to the bold harangue, Each warrior from his bear-skin sprang, And, ominous of coming strife, Clashed tomahawk and scalping knife. A signal by the chief was made To close the Council, and obeyed: His eloquence of look and word Dark depths of every heart had stirred; And 'twas no time in dull debate For other tongues of war to prate, Warned by the loud foreboding cry Of his fleet scout that foes were nigh. With joy in his stern mien, he scann'd The waving scalp-locks of his band; Heard, with pleased ear, their vengeful vows, And marked with pride their frowning brows. In single file he then arrayed His quivered brethren of the shade, And a slow dance, with measured tread, Around the painted war-post led: âWhen war is the result of their deliberations, a chief marches round in a circle, inviting those who are for war to join in the circuitous march, while a war-song serves to rouse their patriotic zeal to the highest pitch, till the whole assembly, kindling into the same ardor, becomes impatient to be led against the enemy.â The following list of the dances in use among the North American Indians, has been given by Mr. Long:â Of these, the war dance is the most remarkable, and is frequently composed of several of the other dances. It is the exact image of an Indian campaign. It represents the departure of their warriors, their arrival at the confines of the hostile nation, their method of encampment, the attack, the scalping of such as fall into their hands, the return of the victorious tribe, and the tortures and heroism of the prisoners. In performing these parts, the savages exhibit a wonderful dexterity; and enter into them with such enthusiasm, that European spectators have forgotten for a moment that it was only a representation, and have shuddered at the imaginary scene. See Lafitan, Charlevoix, 5. Well timing to the fall of feet, The hollow-sounding drum was beat; Maize-kernels in dry gourd-shell swayed, By hand of crone, dull rattling made, And wildly rose the chaunted notes Of battle from a thousand throats. XII. WAR SONG OF THE ON-GUI-HON-WI. 1. Red sons of the forest! leave woman and hearth; Too long have our tomahawks slumbered in earth; Array'd in the garb that your ancestors wore, With arrows of death fill the quiver once more. 2. Our seer has beheld, in the visions of night, The chieftains of yore, and they whisper of fight; The song of the raven is sad in the wood, Haste! gorge, on the morrow, her younglings with blood. 3. That man of our tribe who flees basely away, When dirge for brave men is the clash of the fray, Thenceforth, in the garb of a squaw, shall be drest With our totem erased by the knife For cowardice in battle, an Indian is condemned to lose his totem, a punishment more to be dreaded than a lingering torture at the stake, be deprived of his name, and live a drudge in the lodge of some warrior, clad in the petticoat of a squaw. from his breast. 4. Untrodden no more, let the wild-herbage grow In yon leaf-shaded trail that conducts to the foe; But plain be the path by our war-parties worn, While scalps, on red poles, by the bravest are borne. In returning from a successful expedition, the bravest warrior of the band bears the scalps, stretched over hoops, and elevated upon a long red pole. See Life of Mary Jemison, p. 39. 5. On-gui-hon-wi!âunite in one legion of dread, âAnd they were, indeed, at all times ready (the Iroquois) and willing to cherish the sentiment of exaltation which they felt: they called themselves âOn-qui-hon-wi,â that is, men surpassing all others.ââ Clinton. Like the turbulent river by mountain streams fed; Then rushing, all painted and plumed for the fray, Sweep the host of invasion, like drift-wood, away. XIII. Like cougar, mad with taste of blood, A warrior darted from the throng, While the dim arches of the wood Rang with their gathering songâ High overhead his hatchet raised, While lightning from his eye-ball blazed, Then buried in the solid oak Its glittering blade with rending stroke. Changed was the dance from measure slow To frantic leap and deafening yell, And on imaginary foe An hundred weapons fell, Till, hacked and splintered to the ground, In fragments lay the post around. XIV. Wild and more wild the tumult grew, Amid the crazed, demoniac crew; Knives flashed, as man to man opposed; Dark forms in mimic combat closed; Upwhirled in clouds the summer dust; Quick blows were aimed, and furious thrust; With face convulsed the fallen gasped, And murd'rous hands the scalp-lock grasped; Some from the swathing-board cut loose, With seeming hate, the swart pappoose, Then raised it, struggling, by the heel, And pointed at its throat the steel; While others, on the trampled ground, Limbs of the frantic mother bound, And her shrill cry with laughter drowned. Feigned were base flight and bold advance; Poised was the long, bone-headed lance; Stout arms the heavy war-club swayed; Elastic bows sharp twanging made; And mocked, with modulated tone, Was victor-shout or dying groan. XV. A quavering whistle of the chief Hushed suddenly the combat brief; Succeeding to the sounds of fray, Heard were the wind and leaves at play; Like graven figures of repose, Stood friends and counterfeited foes, Nor murmur breathed, nor member stirred, Awaiting but the signal-word. Like stillness broods o'er grove and plain, When by hath rolled the hurricane; Or on the bosom of the deep, When bark hath found an ocean-sleep, And shrieks, heard lately 'mid the roar Of minute-guns, go up no more. XVI. Pleased was De Grai to mark the power Of Can-ne-hoot in that dread hour; The spell by which a breath subdued The red man, in his wrathful mood, And deference to rank, displayed By those grim warriors of the shade, In prompt compliance, tamed and still, To one whose law was kingly will. At length the sachem waved his hand, And suddenly dispersed the band. Repairing to his lodge, each brave Fresh coat of paint his visage gave, In the grim process trying well His genius for the terrible; Inspected, with a careful glance, Bow, arrows, knife and tapering lance- Precaution that tried veteran takes, Ere noiseless march on foe he makes XVII. Approaching, grave of look, the place Where stood De Grai with thoughtful face, Him thus old Can-ne-hoot addrest: âMy totem gleams upon your breast, But countrymen of thine are foes, Who soon will hear our twanging bows: Between these plains and their array, Will lie an unobstructed way That my adopted son may tread, Without hair injured on his head.â âThanks, father, thanks!âI duly prize Thy noble offer; but these eyes May never, I devoutly pray, See sunlight of another day, When comes the hour that we are found Antagonists on conflict-ground! I deem that wild ambition's lust Impels great Yonnondio on, To wage with thee a war unjust, And never shall my sword be drawn, Save on the side of truth and right;â As neutral I will shun the fight.â XVIII. âEnough!âere shriek of death is heard, Find refuge for thy singing bird; Then, far from battle's crushing stroke, Sit on the mat of peace, and smoke: In yon thick-walled and guarded hold, Will crowd the helpless and the old, And thither thy beloved one bear, Ere fall of night's embrowning shades.â In view arose a gloomy square, âWhenever a considerable number of huts are collected, they have a castle, as it is called, consisting of a square without bastions, surrounded with palisadoes. They have no other fortification; and this is only designed as an asylum for their old men, their wives and children, while the rest are gone out to war.ââ Smith. Hedged round with massy palisades, By fallen trees, on every side, Of ponderous trunk, well fortified, Through which, though numerous and fierce, Unscathed no charging band could pierce, If missiles by the sheltered foe Were boldly launched from gun and bow. XIX. âHow can Od-deen-yo e'er repay His generous father?ââcried De Grai; âAhungered and on weary feet Came the pale wanderer and his spouse; You gave him venison to eat, A cabin and a pleasant seat Beneath the woodland boughs.â âTalk not of recompense,ââreplied The chief in tones of wounded pride: âScorned ever be that tribesman's name, Unworthy of heroic sires, Who basely would requital claim, If pinched with want and weak of frame, Sworn foeman food requires; Or roof above a hearth-stone warm, To guard him from the pelting storm. Who ever sought in peace my hut, And found its door unkindly shut? Who ever, languishing in pain, Asked Can-ne-hoot for help in vain? The wealth of that enchanted Isle Chased vainly on the waters blue, âThey further say that these hunters had a view of the settlements of this peculiar Indian race, whose women are incomparably beautiful, situated on the banks of an island, a terrestrial paradise, in a beautiful lake; but that in their endeavors to approach it, they were in perpetual labyrinths, and, like enchanted land, still as they imagined they had first gained it, it seemed to fly before them, alternately appearing and disappearing.ââ Bartram's Travels. Though bending to his oar, the while, The hunter speeds his bark canoe, If piled before me in return For friendly office, I would spurn!â XX. De Grai rejoined not;âloud and high Rose yell that ended colloquy; Fixed, piercing glance the sachem turned On point whence came that signal-call, And lo! his trusty scout discerned, Staggering toward the Council-Hall! Dishevelled was his plumy crest; An arrow quivered in his breast; Deeply-ensanguined was his skin From naked waist to moccasin, And feebly was his form upborne By limbs relaxing, bruised and torn. While reeling through the wondering crowd, Gleamed his wild eye with triumph proud; For, baffling hounds, the worried bear, Though sorely galled, had reached his lair. With hand in his own life-blood drenched, The chivalrous scalp-lock he clenched, Denoting, by that gesture fierce, That vainly did the arrow pierce, Long as that martial lock of hair Streamed like a flag in troubled air, The same chivalrous principle of action that prompts the civilized soldier to preserve the colors of his regiment from the disgrace of capture, incites the red forest-warrior, though faint with a death-wound, to preserve his scalp from drying in the lodge of an enemy. This trait of Indian character is well illustrated by the personal combat, in Cooper's Prairie, between Mahtoree and Hard Heart. The latter having received a mortal wound, with a last effort plunges into the stream, hoping vainly that the tide would rob his Pawnee foe of the trophy that he so much craved. Preserved, 'mid danger, flight and strife, From mangling edge of hostile knife. XXI. âWhat news?âand why, like hunted deer, Though strong of arm and fleet of foot, Pierced by the barb, comes Yuk-wi The Bear. here?â In calm, deep tone asked Can-ne-hoot. âA bow-shot from the Hon-e-oye, Armed and impatient to destroy, Out-lying Hurons raised the yell: Wounded, the fleetest of their race I distanced in a weary chase, Through thicket, brake and fell. An hundred rods or more beyond The outlet of Au-tau-gua Pond, Where, by dark stream, the trail is cross'd, Glimpse of the skulking knaves I lost. When air the swift bald eagle cleaves, Lean, cawing crows behind he leavesâ Round my remains the wolfish crew Will never raise the death-halloo; For, thanks to Ou-we-nee-you, still My scalp isââ He could speak no more, But trembled with a wintry chill, And from his throat in crimson rill Gushed forth the strangling gore: He groped about, as if dun night Had suddenly excluded light; For weapon in his beaded belt Instinctively the fingers felt, As if the warrior wished to try, With rending death, the mastery; Then, gasping, fell upon the sod, A reddened corseâa lifeless clod. XXII. Sped from the throng, to wail his fate, His young, untimely-widowed mate; Tore her long hair of raven gloss, At thought of her distracting loss; Then flung herself upon the dead, With piercing shriek and arms outspread. Nor moved, nor saddened, nor amazed, Upon that scene the sachem gazed: Deep calm upon his brow reposed, Commanding will emotion curbed, And not one outward sign disclosed That inly was the soul disturbed. De Grai the luckless scout had heard, With heart by drear foreboding stirred, For near his cot, embowered in green, Last was the prowling Huron seen. Unmindful of deportment grave, That well becomes an Indian brave, Though babes and women load the gale With the wild notes of woe and wail, On-yit-ha stood with flashing eye, And muttered in an angry voice, Assured that danger hovered nigh The dusky maiden of his choice: Then, holding with his sire discourse, Besought him quickly to detail A score of bowmen from his force; Northward to scour the river-vale, Then safely to the fortress guide Od-deen-yo's fair, endangered bride. Permission prompt the sachem gave; And, guarded by an escort brave, Led by the Knight-Hawk of his clan, De Grai, through swamp and bosky dell, Pursued a path that parallel With the dark river ran. XXIII. While on the scouting party fared, Old Can-ne-hoot for march prepared, With the main body of his braves, To guard his nation's hallowed graves. âLoved grove, in which our dead are laid,â Where droop long boughs their beds to shade, Will be our place of ambuscade; And those degenerate hounds May Ut-co bear to realms of night, The author's mother, who speaks the Seneca fluently, informed him that by using the term Utco, the Indian referred to the diabolical power from which witches and wizards derive their spirit of mischief. This Great Doer of Evil dwells in an abode of darkness, and controls a countless number of subordinate ministers of ill, who must daily perform their allotted tasksâsome sowing the seeds of disease and death, while others bring blight to the corn-field, scare the deer, and derange the hunter's aim. Who will not, like their fathers, fight For home and hunting-lands in sight Of those green, mossy mounds!â Thus speaking, by a low, shrill whoop, The chief in single file his troop Formed, eager for the fray: A swamp, of depth unsunn'd and dread, In rear of his rude castle spread; And thither the red monarch led, With rapid, light and stag-like tread, His picturesque array. END OF CANTO THIRD. CANTO FOURTH. THE BOWER. Danger's black cloud comes rolling from the north, And gleams of lightning round its edges play; But tameless sons of Liberty go forth, In thicket seldom visited by day, To meet the vaunting spoilers on their way:â Back, Yonnondio!âere your knightly crest Is shorn of half its glory in the fray: The lords, from whom your monarch fain would wrest With iron hand a realm, are Romans of the West. The Iroquois bore this proud appellation, not only by conquest over other tribes, but by encouraging the people of other nations to incorporate with them; âa Roman principle,â says Thatcher, ârecognized in the practice as well as theory of these lords of the forest.â I. Their march no glad spectator cheered; No helmet shone, no war-horse reared, Nor martial instrument was heard, Nor banner by the breeze was stirred: Their feet so lightly touched the ground That not an echo woke to sound; And, glittering not with vain display, They moved like shadows on their way, Or misty shapes that fleetly glide When winds disturb the mountain-side. Sad non-combatants, left behind, Gazed while a trace could be defined Of that long line of warriors grim, Erect of port, and lithe of limb; And when they vanished through The dusky portals of the wood, In groups the young and helpless stood Some form beloved to view. II. The devious way on which they marched, By braided boughs was overarched; And, right and left, spread far away Fens, only lit by fire-fly's ray, Dark with a tangled growth of vine, Black ash, huge water-oak and pine, Mixed with red cedar, mossed and old, Set firmly in the watery mould. Here, covered with a slime of green, Stagnant and turbid pools were seen Edged round with wild, aquatic weeds, Long-bladed flag and clustering reeds. Pond-lilies, oily-leaved and pale, Red willow and the alder frail: There, skeletons of groves gone by, Sad objects to poetic eye! Like monarchs by the battle-blast Assailed and overthrown at last, Wasted and torn in bough and stem, And robbed of leaf-wrought diadem, Lay rotting in their barky mail, Indifferent to sun and gale. Deep hollows in the miry clay, Marked where their roots once spread away, Now mixed with many a rugged mound Formed when their fastenings were unbound, Or wrenched, like gossamer, in twain, By the wild, rushing hurricane. III. A stranger, though in woodcraft taught, Would find that skill availed him naught In that dark thicket, if astray By hunted quarry lured away,â Though well each haunt and covert lone To the brown forest-child was known. Extending to its far-off bound, A war-path, through the centre, wound, So blind that practiced eye in vain, For mark to guide the foot, would strain. Now, all impression of the route, In gurgling runnel, was washed out: Anon, where deeper grew the shade By intertwisted branches made, Its crooked, winding course from sight Was curtained by primeval night. IV. When the dark chieftain and his band, Emerging from the swampy land, Reached the dim borders of the grove That glooms around the âHaunted Cove,â The tempered glow of weary day, Proclaiming the approach of night, To gold transmuted leaf and spray On upland-swell and wooded height; And, calmly in the western sky, Resplendent emblems of repose! Grouped clouds more delicate of dye Than tintings of the half-blown rose. A moment, in the mellow light, Shone beaded belt and hatchet bright; A moment, from the yellow beam, Ring, band, and bracelet caught a gleam; Then the dark wood of boughs inweaved, Within its depths the troop received. V. Beneath tall beeches, gray with eld, Their labyrinthine course they held, While well the hindmost of the line From view concealed betraying sign; The wonderful sagacity of the North American savage on a march, or pursuit of a foe through a forest, is too well known to require much comment. On emergency, they put the hinder part of their snow shoes forward, so that if their footsteps should happen to be observed by a vigilant enemy, it might be supposed they had taken a contrary direction. âSometimes they fix the broad hoofs of buffaloes or bears' paws upon their feet, to deceive the foe; and for miles together, they will make all the customary windings of those animals in the woods. The warrior who brings up the rear, lifts to a natural position the broad grass, and âthey march, one man behind the other, treading carefully in each other's steps, so that their number may not be ascertained by the prints of their feet.âââ Heckewelder. Sending keen glances in the rear, Lifting bowed herb and grassy spear, Or doubling, when the oozy ground Yielded beneath the lightest foot,â Like hunted foxes, when the hound And hunter are in hot pursuit. The red-breast, perched in arbor green, Sad minstrel of the quiet sceneâ While hymning, for the dying sun, Strains like a broken-hearted one, Raised not her mottled wing to fly As swept those silent warriors by. The wood-cock, in his moist retreat, Heard not the falling of their feet; On his dark roost the gray owl slept; Time with his drum the partridge kept, Nor left the deer his watering-place, So hushed, so noiseless was their pace. Soon, partly veiled by bank and tree, They scann'd the rolling Genesee, Catching, within his channel'd bed, Deep blushes from the sunset red, And, stealing onward, reached a bay Where light pirogues of white-wood lay, Fashioned and hollowed out alone By eating fire and gouge of stone. Their canoes were of two kinds: one was made of a large log excavated, the inside burned and wrought by a stone gouge, and the outside shaped by their stone axe. The second kind was made of birchen bark. âThe pirogues or war canoes of the Indians are constructed by hollowing the trunks of large trees with much labor and patience; and, notwithstanding their bulk and gravity, they are moved dexterously through the water. The pirogue is often large enough to contain fifty persons; and in most instances, the workmanship is so neat, and the ornaments so splendid, as to be thought utterly beyond the execution of savages ignorant of the harder metals. The trunk of a tree which they have cut down, and which they design to form into a canoe, often begins to rot before their labor is at an end. Their chisel was of stone, sharpened to an edge. Ignorant of iron, their hatchets and axes were made of stone. Their use dictated a similar shape to ours. A young sapling was split near the ground, the head of the axe thrust into it, and a handle formed with inconsiderable labor.â See Gumilla, Lafitan, MÅurs ii. 213, and Indian Wars. Impelled by dip of tapering oar, Sharp prows receded from the shore, And, darting through the flashing waves Afloat with full five hundred braves, Soon rocked beneath the willows dank That fringed the green, opposing bank. VI. Their leader breathed a low command, And, guarding against hostile eye, Their war-canoes were drawn to land, And hidden in a thicket nigh; Then, patiently, each warrior plumed, With cautious tread, the march resumed. VII. Changed are the hills that overbrow The vale in which those heroes trod, And, rudely, hind and younker now Look on their ashes, while the plough Disturbs the burial-clod; And, where those knights of bow and quiver Paddled across the Pleasant River, Burning to check in bold advance The serried chivalry of France, Over the deep and hurrying tide Yon red bridge flings its arch of pride. The forest, many-toned and wide, Hath vanished from the river-sideâ Gone are green roof and leafy screen Like vapor yester-morning seen; Fierce wasting flame and crashing steel Rang, long ago, its funeral-peal. Where browsed the elk in other days, Fat herds in thymy meadows graze; Where the fanged cougar, hating day, Crouched by the deer-lick for his prey, Heard is the tinkling bell of flocks, And Ceres binds her wheaten shocks. VIII. From waves, once clear as mountain rill, Where pike and bass the red man speared, And home his bark by torchlight steered, The finny tribe have disappeared, Scared by the clacking mill; And, proudly, on the ruined homes Of perished tribes, stand lordly domes: But why the light and shade contrast Of present hour, and clouded past, While notes of war are on the gale, And the plot thickens of my tale? IX. The fires of day were fading fastâ A deeper shade the forest cast, While, through the hallowed place of graves, Moved a long line of belted braves. The hand of reverence and love Had broken the green cope above; For the red forest tribes believe, When comes the radiant sunset-time, The hillocks of the dead receive Bright visits from the Better Clime. Round each old tomb the paling rude, From year to year, had been renewed, And Indian girls had trained the vine, Amid the pointed stakes, to twine, And decked each space inclosed with flowers Culled from the fairest woodland bowers. Pale, velvet mosses over-crept Tombs in which maid and mother slept, And fragile infancy reposed, A wilding flower untimely closed. X. There, mindless of the coming years, Lay old and venerated seers, Carved amulets of mystic sway Commingling with their wasted clay. On the shagg'd fells of wolf and bear, The mighty hunter mouldered there, His favorite hound of courage tried, And weapons buried by his side. âThey bury with the dead, food, bows and arrows, pipes and whatsoever pleased them while living, or might be necessary in the country of souls. They believe in the immortality of the soul, without the aid of metaphysics. The Chicung, the shadow, that which survives the body, they grossly imagine, will, at death, go into some unknown but curious place.â Indian Wars. They give the first place in the land of spirits to the courageous warrior who has put to death the greatest number of his enemies, and to the hunter who has distinguished himself the most in the exertions of the chase; and it is their practice to bury the hatchet and the bow of a leader in the same grave with his body, that he may not be destitute of arms when he enters upon the future world. They likewise deposit in his tomb the skins and stuffs of which their garments are made, corn, venison, drugs, utensils, and animals of different kinds, and whatever else they hold to be necessary or convenient in their simple estimate of life.â De La Potherie and Colden, Five Nations, i. 17. âThe Omaha Chief, Black-bird, after death, was placed erect on his war-horse, and, followed by the braves he had often led to battle, conveyed to his sepulchre on a high bluff overlooking the Missouri. The horse, alive, was forced into the grave with his dead rider, and thus inhumed.â Appendix to the Gazetteer of Missouri. Some tribes erect a scaffold, by planting four large stakes in the ground, eight feet high, and five by three apart, across the tops of which are laid poles, on which the bark coffin, enclosing the body, rests. A correspondent of the New Yorker thus alludes to a scaffold of this description. âA few years since, a sarcophagus was erected on the west bank of Rock River, about two miles below the junction of the Pecatonic, wherein was laid an Indian girl. It remained till about a year since, when decay and the winds swept it away, and left nothing but the stakes on which it was reared, which are yet standing.â There, in his mantle richly-furred, The lord of nations lay interr'd, Forgetful of his ancient reign, Couched on proud trophies of the slain; His name a rousing watchword still, Weak arm to nerve, faint heart to thrill; And there, his silver voice untuned, Forever glazed his falcon eye, The Cicero of wilds unpruned Lay crumbling silently, Lost on the wind, like chaunt of birds, His passionate and burning words. XI. Magnificently robed and crowned Old oaken monarchs stood around, And through their boughs, thick-leaved and wide, The low wind, like a mourner, sighed. Their gray and patriarchal boles Consorted well with funeral-knolls Where slept, in gloom that knows no morn, The tameless and the forest-born. XII. Proud piles and monuments of stone, Reared in remembrance of the dead, Befit the sepulchres alone Of creatures in the city bred; But when the child of nature dies, Deep in the howling woodland waste, The virgin-soil, in which he lies, By other land-mark should be graced: Let bark inclose his cold remains; By thunder let his knell be rung; By warbling birds and pattering rains, And the low zephyr that complains, His soft melodious dirge be sung, With trees about, unshorn and tall, His columns of memorial. XIII. Nigh ashes of the lost and loved, Old Can-ne-hoot and party moved With lingering gait and slow; And deemed, in every rustling oak, That voices of the mighty spoke Of fleet, approaching foe: Imploring them, in hollow tones, From outrage to defend their bones; Commanding them to keep unstained The glory by their fathers gained; And, deeply, in remembrance bear That, after death, the brave repair To happy homes and hunting grounds, While cowards haunt, beyond the tomb, A realm of black, unending gloom Where bitter fruit abounds. Oh, well did time and place conspire To light proud souls in wild-wood bred With sparks of pure, heroic fire Fann'd from pale ashes of the dead; And bring before the mental sight Departed chiefs, once famed in fight, With war-clubs, thickly notched, that told How mighty were the men of old! The Indian warrior cuts scalp-notches upon the handle of his hatchet, significant of the number of the enemies that he has slain. âIn order to commemorate great events and preserve the chronology of them, the war-chief in each tribe keeps a war-post. This post is a peeled stick of timber, ten or twelve feet high, that is erected in the town. For a campaign, they make, or rather the chief makes, a perpendicular red mark, about three inches long and half an inch wide; on the opposite side of this, for a scalp, they make a red cross, thus â ; on another side, for a prisoner taken alive, they make a red cross, in this manner, , with a head, or dot; and by placing such significant hieroglyphics in a conspicuous situation, they are enabled to ascertain, with great certainty, the time and circumstances of past events. Hiokatoo had a war-post on which were recorded his military exploits, and other things that he thought worth preserving.â Life of Mary Jemison. XIV. Northward the forest grew more blind, And range of keenest glance confined: Above, nor strip of welkin blue, Nor opening in the leafy screen, For twilight ray to glimmer through, And cheer the hideous gloom, were seen. The matted underwood below Seemed haunt, alone, of reptile foe, And brier-rose and bramble tall Threw up a vegetable wall. XV. Long, sylvan colonnades around, Ranged dimly on the forest-floor, By capitals of umbrage crowned, A mighty canopy upbore; And vines, that arched from tree to tree, Increased the dread obscurity. There often, in the mid-day light, Would hoot the feathered anchorite, And the dull bat, his neighbor meet, Air with thin, volant membrane beat: There, though effulgent morning reigned, The little katy-did complained, And the lone muk-a-wiss was heard, That solemn and prophetic bird, The Indian name for the whippowil, says Carver, is âmuckawiss.â âAs soon as night comes on, these birds will place themselves on the fences, stumps or stones that lie near some house, and repeat their melancholy notes without any variation, till midnight. The Indians and some of the inhabitants of the back settlements think if this bird perches upon any house, that it betokens some mishap to the inhabitants of it.â Carver. Outpouring a melodious hymn Beneath the shade of leaf and limb. XVI. It was a place by nature formed For the brown Indian to abide, With heart by love of country warmed, The billows of the battle-tide; And there, beneath a dun arcade, Halt by the Senecas was made. Picked men were sent to watch the course, And movements of the hostile force; And by their chieftain charged to wile, From glade and thinly wooded plain, Both fiery Frank and Huron vile, And with them artfully, the while, A rapid, running fight maintain, Till their close ranks, too late to pause, And their lost vantage ground regain, Were trapp'd in grim Destruction's jaws! XVII. Posts, by the leader, were assigned To the main body left behind: Their practiced ears the signal caught, And gliding, noiseless as the snake, Each savage form a cover sought In brambly copse and tufted brake, Save the hawk-eyed and nimble spy, Who, stationed in a tree-top high That towered above the grove profound, Was charged to mock the wolf's long howl If aught, like foe, was seen to prowl Their hiding place around. XVIII. The muster at war's savage call Of Senecas in Council Hall; Dismaying scene, and martial rite Mingled with voices of affright; Mad circling dance, 'mid shriek and yell, As if Arch-Fiend was working spell; Mock strife in which fierce howls of rage Were loud as roar when hosts engage; The march, in long and ordered line, âThey march in a line of individual warriors, and preserve a dead silence.â Some of the Indian nations resemble the Tartars in the construction of their canoes, implements of war and the chase, with the well-known habit of marching in Indian file.â Priest's Amer. Antiq. Of warriors watching leader's sign; And craft wherewith, in thicket dread, Snare for invading feet is spreadâ Too long, from Blanche and Wun-nut-hay, Have errant bard detained away. XIX. Romantic was the leafy bower, Impervious to sun and shower, By the young exile for his bride Wove deftly near his cabin-side. The roving linnet, for a perch Screened from the noontide glare, in search, Or butterfly, on gaudy wing, Fatigued with restless wandering, Above could not an entrance find, So closely were the branches twined. Detached by winds, that murmured through The lattice-work impearled with dew, Fell blossoms, whiter far than snow, On the green, mossy floor below, From thorn and wild plum, for the feet Of the sweet minstrel carpet meet, Whose voice, attuned to mournful key, Filled the bright haunt with melody. XX. HYMN. 1. Father!âwith pale hands uplifted, Hear thy wandering child implore That the cloud of woe be rifted, And the light poured in once more! On Life's rose the wasting canker Early hath impressed its mark; Where, oh where can safely anchor Sorrow's frail and shattered bark? 2. Once, around my pillow brightly, From thy throne fell radiant gleamsâ Now, dim shapes of evil nightly Fill with misery my dreams. While I start and tremble, fearing That Hope's star will never dawn, In mine ear a voice of cheering Whispersââbear and struggle on!ââ 3. âChild!âthough dark affliction ever Wakes a serpent in thy breast, And thy foot, aweary, never Finds on earth a home of rest, Robed in loveliness supernal, Filled with joy's undying song, Mansions, many and eternal, To thy Father's house belong!â XXI. No melancholy voice, nor sound, Breathing of anguish and despair, From sunny forest-aisles around, On passing wind, was wafted there. The cascade, darting down the hill, And prattle of the vagrant rill; Exhilarating chaunt of bird, And squirrel's gleesome bark were heard, While vocal leaf and waving spray Joined in a summer roundelay. XXII. The clear, bright azure of the sky, Dappled with cloudy bars of whiteâ Groves tossing their green plumes on high, And flowers of deep, but varied dye, Unfolding in the golden light, And luring, from their waxen cells, Bees to their nectar'd cups and bells, Were breathing ministers of gladness, Rebuking discontent and sadness: But mindless of sweet sights and soundsâ Refreshing balm of bud and flower, Sate Blanche within the leafy bounds Of her romantic bower, And by her side the forest maid Enjoyed the cool and grateful shade. XXIII. âWhile the Great Spirit, from above, Looks down upon the world in love, And golden skies o'er all things bend, Why, daughter of the distant land!â Said Wun-nut-hay, her dusky friend, âPress on thy brow that lily-hand? Why is thy heart the home of sighs, Of briny drops thy mournful eyes? List!âwhile heroic tale of old, To wean thee from sad thought, is told!â XXIV. ON-NO-LEE. [A LEGEND OF THE CANADICE.] A beautiful lake is the Canadice, And wild fowl dream on its breast unscared; Thy golden brooch, of costly price, Is dim with its radiant wave compared. Edged by a broad and silvery belt Of pebbles bright, and glittering sand, The waters into music melt When breaking on the strand; And its glimmering sheet of azure lies Unvexed by loud and warring blast; For green old hills, that round it rise, Fence this fair mirror of the skies From storms that journey past XXV. A beautiful lake is the Canadice, And warblings from its bosom clear Go up by moonlight, and entice, The hunter to pause and hear. Oh! mournful are the tones and low, Like the mystic voice of the whip-po-wil, When evening winds through the forest blow, And other birds are still. Ear never heard a sadder strain, In the time of frost and falling leaves, When brown and naked woods complain, And the brook, late fed by summer rain, For perished verdure grieves. XXVI. A beautiful lake is the Canadice, And tribesmen dwelt on its banks of yore, But an hundred years have vanished thrice Since hearth-stones smoked upon the shore: The Munsee dreamed not of a foe; Unstrung were the warrior's arm and bow: And, couched on skins, he little thought The fall of his nation was at hand: His ear no rattle of serpent caught, No gliding ghost a warning brought While came the Mengwe band. Too lateâtoo late to fight or fly Was rang the knell of his ancient power; His lip pealed forth no rallying cry, From slumber he only woke to die At the solemn midnight hour. In gore his household-gods were drenched, His altar-fires in gore were quenched; The wail of babe in blood was choked, In blood his burial-place was soaked, And, lighting up the midnight-heaven, To flame were the huts of his people given. XXVII. Though tall oaks fell in their kingly pride, The conqueror saved a trembling leaf; Of that little clan all darkly died Save On-no-lee, the cherished bride Of their brave but luckless chief. Morn dawned upon a frightful sceneâ The Canadice in sunshine lay; But blood was on its margin greenâ A tribe was swept away. On the blackened site of a town destroyed, The raven a goodly meal enjoyed, And the wolf called forth her whelps, to share That banquet red, from her gloomy lair. XXVIII. Morn dawnedâand on their homeward track The Mengwe, flushed with conquest, sped, And, a far-famed leader, Mic-ki-nac, That band of spoilers led. To the red belt, his waist around, The hapless On-no-lee was bound; Spared from the death-doom of her race, The pomp of his return to grace, And live the slave of one who bore The scalp of her fallen sagamore. XXIX. At noon, to snatch a light repast, The party halted in the shade; But On-no-lee broke not her fast, And in the dust, with loathing cast The food before her laid. Oh! woman wronged, within her soul Feels fire flash up that mocks control, When the ruthless fiend, to whom she owes The fearful sum of her blasting woes, Is yielded up her prey by fate, And the dagger is nigh to second hate! XXX. Mic-ki-nac sat on a fallen tree, And of smoke-dried venison partook, âWe retain some Indian modes of cookery. Their green corn, when either roasted or boiled, is excellent. Their hommony consists of corn bruised and soaked or boiled Their nokchike is parched corn pounded. Suckatash, a mixture of green corn and beans, is become a very common dish. Upaquontop is the head of a bass boiled, and the broth thickened with hommony, which is one of their richest delicacies.â Indian Wars. And by his side was On-no-lee, Survivor of the butchery, Who eyed his knife with an eager look. Round the haft her fingers lightly wreathed, The glittering weapon she unsheathedâ One well-aimed blow, and she was free! Another,âand the purple tide Gushed from her savage captor's side, Who leaped like a wounded stag, and died. XXXI. Thunder, without a cloud in sight, Or whisper of warning on the gale, Could not have roused more wild affright, Amid his braves, than deed of might Wrought by a hand so frail! Ere they recovered from the shock Fled On-no-lee like hunted deer; Glen, stream, and interposing rock Barred not her swift career: A vigor never felt before, The form of the fugitive upbore, And to her active foot gave wing, Though fleet were the blood-hounds following. XXXII. In vain the foremost runner strained, And arrows launched from his twanging bow, For On-no-lee, exulting, gained A cliff, beyond the reach of foe, That beetled over the lake below. Last of her race, with desperate eyeâ On the ruined home of her tribe she gazed; Waved her avenging arm on high,â Taunted her baffled enemy, And a ringing scream of triumph raisedâ âBase, worrying curs!âgo back, go back, My scalp is saved from Mengwe smoke! Go hence, and look for Mic-ki-nacâ âThe first principle which is instilled into the breast of a savage, is revenge. Time cannot efface the remembrance of an injury; it is cherished and kept alive with the most studious care; like the hereditary feuds of Scottish clans, it even goes down from one generation to another, with all its associated feelings, and with these feelings in all their exercise. The blood of the offender can alone expiate the transgression. If the domain appropriated to hunting be invaded, or if an individual of a tribe be cut off, the desire of vengeance swells in every breast with instinctive emotion, and instantly kindles into rage. It sparkles in every eye, and gives activity to every limb. Months and years roll away, and the purpose of vengeance continues deep in the heart, and it shows itself in tremendous execution when it is least expected or feared. The Indian fights, not less to satiate his revenge, than to conquer his enemies; and that destructive passion is not gratified till he has glutted himself with the blood of the hostile tribe, and rejoiced in the extinction of its name. Even the women seem to be animated with this destructive and restless principle.â Edinburg Encyclopedia, vol. i. p. 591. The famished crow, and the raven black A dirge above him croak!â Regardless of the whizzing storm Of missiles raining round her form, Imploring eye she then upcast, And a low, mournful death-hymn sang: On hill and forest looked her last, One glance upon the water cast, And from that high rock sprang. XXXIII. Away three hundred years have flown Since the Munsee found a watery grave; But when old Night is on her throne, And stars troop forth her sway to own, Rise warblings from the wave: And a shadowy face of mournful mien, With locks all draggled by the surge, Belated wanderers have seen From the glittering lake emergeâ One moment float in moonlight fair, Then mix with the waters, or vanish in air.â XXXIV. Ere Blanche could Wun-nut-hay reward With one approving smile or word, A muffled tread upon the sward, And sound of parting boughs she heard: Upspringing, with a joyous cry, She deemed her gallant husband nigh; An instant more,âand in her mien Fear's paralyzing power was seen; All color vanished from her cheek, Her lips were locked, and could not speak: Back was her head in horror thrownâ Her form all motionless like stone: Whence came the spell that bound her frame, And hushed, half-breathed, a loved one's name? What saw she?â Through the flowery wall Of her vine-woven forest hall, A dark, vindictive visage peered, With paint, denoting war, besmeared. Not well could eloquence have framed The language by that look proclaimed: It told of prize, long sought, at last In hard, unyielding clutches fastâ Of pleasure such as panthers feel, Though longing for a bloody meal, When hunted down their prey; For glared keen eye-balls with a joy That would caress, and then destroy, Though hunger chid delay. XXXV. A something in that hideous face, Could Blanche of one remembered trace; For the clear outlines, full and bold, Less of the red, than white man told; And its fixed look of glad surprise, Despite of barbarous disguise, Announced that she was known full well, Plainly as word could syllable. XXXVI. As howls the wood-wolf to his pack When some fair doe rewards his search, And the far hills give answer back, Scaring the wild bird from her perchâ So did that man of evil eye Out-pour one long, loud signal-cry, To which the groves replied in tone As fierce and startling as his own. Roused was the lady by the sound, And Wun-nut-hay looked wildly round For outlet of escape in vain: Dark forms, in Huron garb bedight, Like serpents glided into sight, And bound with thongs the twain. The party, with their scowling chief, Held hurried conference and brief In harsh and guttural tone; Then left the violated bower, Like men, in dread of hostile power, Who trust to speed alone. END OF CANTO FOURTH. CANTO FIFTH. THE RESCUE. Mourn for the lovely cabin-home that smiled On the dim borders of the forest old! Changed to a scene of desolation wild, Its arbor, walls and portico, behold! Though faint the mark of footprints on the mould, Fearless and fleet avenger will pursue While shadowy night comes down on wave and wold:â For captive, made by fell, marauding crew, Is one more dear than lifeâhis partner fond and true! II. Eastward the spoilers held their way, And when the forest-edge was won, Shone on green leaf and waving spray A glare more lurid than the ray Of red, descending sun. Poor Blanche threw back one parting gaze,â Her cottage-home was in a blaze; Thick smoke hung round it like a pall, Fire darted out from roof and wall; Black cinders on her arbor fell, Fierce flames rang out a crackling knell; Vines, trained above the porch to meet, Were fast consuming in the heat; And clustering rose-trees, taught to shade The windows by her fingers fair, With wooing winds no longer played In green and crimson robe array'd,â By the hot breath of ruin made Black, verdureless and bare: And birds that she had lured away From lone, deep haunts in forest gray, To hop unscared around her doorâ From that ill-fated dwelling fled, As if they knew the hand that fed Could fling them crumbs no more. II. Soon was the burning wreck from view Veiled by dark, interposing trees; But well, too well the lady knew By voices on the passing breezeâ A sullen crashâa muffled dinâ That the loved roof was tumbling in, Burying, in its timeless fall, Full many a sad memorial, And token dear of other hours When fell her fairy foot on flowers. III. Fiends who had fired that sylvan cot, Letters and books regarded not, But rudely bore alone from thence, Toys that they deemed of consequence: While the prized wardrobe of her child, Whose lonely grave was in the wildâ Home-missives, from the camp in haste, By her old, warlike father traced, Before his heart became a waste; And, lastly, than all cherished things More precious in her wanderings, The Bible by a mother given When earth about to quit for Heaven, Resolved by flame to ashes paleâ Abroad were scattered on the gale. IV. When captives and marauding band Reached a tall ridge of wooded land That, eastward, walled the pleasant vale, Day into glimmering twilight died, And murmurs from the river-side Came softened on the gale; And Blanche from that commanding height, Above the tree-tops, far beneath Saw vapor rise, more black than night, From her lost dwelling's blackened site, In many a mournful wreath. V. Onward their course the party urged, Until they reached a babbling brook, Then from the beaten trail diverged, And their way, in shadow merged, More slowly southward took: Now on gnarled oak, by hatchet blazed, The keen eye of some savage gazed; Anon the rearmost warrior paused When heard was some unusual sound By distant scream of panther caused, Or dry branch falling to the ground. The moon in her pale march was far, And twinkled many a watching star, When a deep dell was gained where sped Co-ne-sus o'er his pebbly bedâ Bright outlet of that pearl of lakes From which a tuneful name it takes, Rushing to lose its silvery gleam In the dark river's turbid stream! VI. To halt, their leader gave command, And parleyed with his scowling band, As if in doubt to steer his course Down the swift tide, or toward its source; But an old brave of haughty port, And glittering eye, debate cut short, And pointing to the water, flecked With quivering sports of lunar light, Said in the Huron dialectâ âWolves will throng forth to night:â Watch-fires are lit their way to teach By upland-swell and river-beach; Their tell-tale runner that we chased, Howls in their den, and we must haste!â On the creek's bottom then he strode, When opportunity offers, on a retreat, the Indian warrior walks in the bed of streams, for he well knows that a savage enemy upon his trail will pursue the traces of man and beast, by observing with acuteness the disposition of the grass and leaves. âSome of the French missionaries have supposed that the Indians are guided by instinct, and have pretended that Indian children can find their way through a forest as easily as a person of mature years; but this is a most absurd notion. It is unquestionably by a close attention to the growth of the trees and position of the sun that they find their way. On the northern side of a tree there is generally the most moss; and the bark on that side, in general, differs from that on the opposite one. The branches toward the south are, for the most part, more luxuriant than those on the other sides of trees; and several other distinctions subsist between the northern and southern sides, conspicuous to Indians, being taught from their infancy to attend to them, which a common observer would, perhaps, never notice. Being accustomed from their infancy likewise to pay great attention to the position of the sun, they learn to make the most accurate allowance for its apparent motion from one part of the heavens to another; and in every hour of the day, they will point to the part of the heavens where it is, although the sky be obscured by clouds or mists.â Weld. Before his chief, to show the way, Each bearing in his arms a loadâ Sad Blanche and Wun-nut-hayâ While figures gaunt brought up the rear With watchful eye and open ear. VII. Above, the overhanging banks Were lined by trees in broken ranks, And moonlight, falling gently down, Set with rich pearls each emerald crown. There towered, majestical and old, The dark-leaved hemlock from the mould, The spruce, unstirr'd by breath of air, Shaped like a parasol, was there, And the huge pine full proudly bore His honors like a regal thing, His trunk with mossy velvet hoar, Fit ermine for so wild a king. VIII. A hill once strongly fortified, Down sloping to the water-side, The hill referred to in the text, is situated on the banks of the Conesus Creek, and is called âFort Hillâ by the inhabitants. The first settlers of the country say that it was an open place in the heart of the forest, with trench, mound and gateway plainly visible. The sloping sides of the hill are filled with human bones that lie white and undecayed in loose yellow sand. Implements of quaint form, and ornaments in the shape of squares and half moons, marked with hieroglyphics, also an urn-like vessel, were found, after a severe tempest, in a deep hollow, made by the uprooting of an oak. Skulls have been disinterred near by, of sufficient size to encase the head of a full-grown man, and must have belonged to a race of larger proportions even, than the gigantic Indians of Patagonia. In company with his friend Mr. Harry Thomson, who takes a deep interest in the subject of Indian antiquities, the author visited this site of an ancient fortification, after the plough had passed over it, and succeeded in finding many curious beads, some formed from the horns of deer, fragments of pottery and pipes, on the bowls of which the heads of fox, frog and wolf, were ingeniously carved. Captor and captive hurried by: Stockade and trench still crowned the place, Memorials of a vanished race Whose green, old graves were nigh. A clearing of uneven ground Once spread the ruined fortress round, But 'mid huge stumps, decayed and black, Young oaks were springing green and high, And fast the grove was winning back Its old supremacy:â It was a scene of mingling hues, And not unmeet for Bryant's muse,â That whispered of the dead and gone, Lovely,âthough sad to look uponâ Telling that in the forest's heart, Like his frail brother of the mart, Untutored man a structure rears To long outlast his wasting form, To stand when round his grave the storm Hath howled uncounted years. IX. Pursuing, in its channel wide, The silvery windings of the tide, The party fared a mile or more, Then forward hurried on the shore. âIf foemen follow, they will find A watery trail both cold and blind, Though keen as vultures on the scent!â Muttered the leader to his crew, And his breath more freely drew, Like one relieved from sense of fear, Deeming black danger, lately near, No longer imminent. Where had that voice the lady heard? A tumult in her heart was stirr'd, Recalling scenes beyond the main; Though harsh the tone as raven's croak, An echo of the past it woke In her distracted brain. X. Long ere the mid hour of the night, Crossed the dark robbers in their flight The grassy carpet of a glade, From which, through bowers of glossy green, Bright glimpses of the lake were seen On which wan moonlight played. Plunging in thickets, soon they hied Without one friendly star to guide, So dark the cover overhead Of long-armed butternut, inweaved With oak and chestnut thickly-leaved, And evergreen outspread. Eastward the lake of silver breast, Beneath a cloudless sky at rest, A gun-shot from their wood-path lay; But, on its beach of whitened sand, Dreaded a marchâthat crafty bandâ Lest footprint might betray. XI. Emerged, at last, each cautious brave From sylvan labyrinth of gloom, And low winds, freshened by the wave, Stirred blanket-fold and eagle-plume: Again the moonshine brightly fell On rounded brooch and bead of shell, On spoiler and his pinioned prey, From friends, a weary march, away. XII. Descending from the higher ground, Through matted underwood they wound, And on a tongue of land arrived, Outstretching far into the mere, An emerald set in crystal clear, There is a favorite place of resort for pic-nic parties, called Long Point, that stretches out into the silvery Conesus, a few miles from Lakeville. It is covered with oaks of stately growth, and in their shade rustic benches and tables have been erected for the accommodation of visitors. All lovers of the romantic owe a debt of gratitude to the tasteful proprietor,the venerable James Wadsworth, Esq., for preserving this natural park from the desecrating axe. Aboriginal remains, well worthy of minute examination, may be seen near the lake beach. The face of the ground has evidently been altered by the hand of art; and timber, in a remarkable state of preservation, has been discovered, four or five feet below the surface,in places where the loose soil of the bank has crumbled away. The blue hills in the distance, partly clothed with the primitive forestâthe waters kissing the shore with an undertone of melodyâthe plunge of fish and flap of waterfowlâthe pleasant murmur of the wind-swept trees mingling with the carol of sinless birds, are ministers of repose and pleasure to a mind that has been wounded by the âbriers of this work-day world.â It is a bright, sequestered spot, and the fabling fancy of Greece peopled haunts less picturesque, with Happy Spiritsâa green retreat where the retired poet could wear out life, and which the wayfarer passes by with reluctance, through fear his eye will never rest again on sight so beautiful. Dotted with oaks whose upright forms Stern warfare with the wrestling storms Of ages had survived. A clump, more ancient than the othersâ A group of iron-hearted brothers, Towered with their trunks of rugged shape Near the curved margin of the cape: And underneath their branches gray, To halt until the dawn of day, Encamped that predatory horde: Short was their meal:âtheir only cheer, Parched maize, and smoke-dried flesh of deerâ Mossed earth their banquet-board. With flint and steel though well supplied, Red camp-fires they enkindled not, Through fear some treach'rous brand might guide Fierce, wandering Maquas to the spot. Thirsting for blood, and armed to slay, While, bound in slumber's thrall, they lay. XIII. When broken was their lengthened fast, The pipe around the circle passed; Then, wearied by a march of toil, And glad their toughened limbs to rest, All couched them down upon the soil, As if it was their mother's breast, Save watchman gaunt who vigil kept While others in their blankets slept, And two, upon a fallen tree, Seated in earnest colloquy: One that dark man of evil mien Who first spied Blanche in arbor green, And Huron who, through forest dim, In swift retreat had guided him. XIV. âMy brother now his eye may close, Safe from assault of roving foes; Brown, burrowing moles have keener sight, And water leaves no trace of flightââ Growled the old chiefââEnough for them Like leaves to die on girdled stem; For them enough in their despair To strike the painted battle-post, While rush, to smoke them in their lair, Great Yonnondio and his host! Through brambly wold and swampy ground It ill becomes a brave to dodge, Like hunted fox before the hound, To place yon White-Rose in thy lodge, Winning himself, a stripling's prize, Her Sister-Flower of darker dyes! What will my taunting tribesmen say If I am absent from the fray, Counting, in scorn before my face, The scalp-locks of a vanquished race? On this gray head will rest disgrace:â Hushed will my voice in council be, Clouded my name eternally;â Speak, brother, speak!â âA Huron, thou!â Exclaimed his comrade in reply, While gathered gloom upon his brow, âAnd ask acquittal from a vow Pledged to another solemnly? In other mould I deemed thee castâ One proving faithful to the last; Thy brother, to his promise true, Thee and thy warriors will requite With blankets of a gaudy hue, And ornaments of silver bright, Richer than mighty sagamore In hall of council ever wore If guarded on his dangerous trail:â Ere rise and set four fleeting suns, Our camping ground will be the vale Through which the Wy-a-lu-sing runs; There waits the friendly Nanticoke His calumet with us to smoke, And mats provide of texture fine On which our tired limbs may recline.â XV. âHah! doubting still what course to take, Thy word redeem, or compact break? For answering with stab and yell The challenge of the sentinel Who from foul shame an Indian spared, The Indian never forgets the individual who befriends him. Gratitude is as deeply rooted in his breast, as the remembrance of a wrong. In the language of Judge Story, âif he had the vices of savage life, he had the virtues also. He was true to his country, his friends, and his home. If he forgave not injury, neither did he forget kindness If his vengeance was terrible, his fidelity and generosity were unconquerable also. His love, like his hate, stopped not on this side of the grave.â Mad with deep draughts of liquid fire, When whip was raised, and back was bared, By calming Yonnondio's ire? Who bears the name that Frenchmen bore? Rememberest thou?â âNo more, no more!â When dusky night is at an end The Black Fox journeys with his friend!â Then, on the ground with green-sward floored, Their ancient amity restored, Stretched their tired limbs, that miscreant pair, Till day-break gleamed, to slumber there. XVI. Apart a temporary tent Of poles, crotched stakes, and branches bent, Loosely with strips of bark o'er-laid, For the tired captives had been made; And a grim savage, keeping guard, Its low and narrow entrance barred, Droning, to keep himself awake, Rude fragments of some forest tune, Or looking forth upon the Lake When shrieked the solitary loon The loon, or great northern diverââL'imbrim ou grand plongeon de la mer de nord de Buffon,â is regarded, in some parts of the country, as a bird of ill-omen. The loon is said to be restless before a storm; and an experienced master of a coasting vessel informs me, that he always knew when a tempest was approaching, by the cry of this bird, which is very shrill, and may be heard the distance of a mile or more. Wilson's Ornithology. Amid tall flags and clustering reedsâ A warning that the Indian heeds, Taught truly by tradition old That storm was in that cry foretold. XVII. The wind-swept waters on the shore Broke with a low, dull, muttering roar,â Reflecting back a lurid glare When lightning lanced the darkened air. The moon was muffled in a cloud, Its leafy top the forest bowed, And, far within its solemn bounds, Woke dismal moans and creaking sounds. XVIII. What shielded Blanche, through trial sore, And hardships never known before, From perishing like lily frail When outraged by the tyrant-gale? Reared in a palace o'er the sea, And daughter of a noble race, Slight as the blue anemone Was her light form of Phydian grace; And yet, dark ills that well might test The temper of the sternest breast, To danger used, to toil inuredâ This high-born woman had endured. Who was that man of evil eye, Whose voice roused buried memory? Whence came he with that felon-tread? Can shrouded corse forsake its bed?â Where was her homeâher husband, where? Such questions must have nursed despair. XIX. Oh! what a medicine for one, Whose heart, though rudely torn, aches on, Is dull, oblivious reposeâ A brief unconsciousness of woes; The dreary luxury of forgetting That perils are our path besetting: And Blanche in sleep forgot awhile Dark foe with heart of guilt and guile; Her forest-home made desolate, Her infant's grave, and absent mate Who came not when she shrieked for aid, And ruffian hand was on her laid. Rude was the couch on which she lay, Of gathered moss and leaves composed; And by her side was Wun-nut-hay With brain at work, and eye unclosed. XX. Accustomed, when a little child, To wander with her roving race, Through the dim alleys of the wild, From stream to stream, and place to place; And by her forest training taught Tasks to perform with peril fraught:â The reptile in her path to slay; By precipice to track her way; The rushing hurricane to shun, When its black banner veiled the sun; With steady hand her skiff to steer, Though the dark whirlpool eddied near; Or with a firm, unwavering stride On slippery pole to cross the tide,â Still, did that Indian maid possess A power that conquered weariness. XXI. Lone musing on her captive state Roused old, hereditary hate. Her mind with thoughts of freedom teemed; By her, revenge was virtue deemed; Though woman all, the blood of chiefs Timed the proud throbbings of her heart, And grief beyond all other griefs From her own tribe it was to part, And hear no more On-yit-ha's voice Salute the maiden of his choice. All swollen were her pinioned hands; Whose work was thisâwho twined these bands? And shall the daughter of the brave Live in the Huron's lodge, a slave? Her fettered hands she tried to free; Why from the task desisted she? XXII. Love for the being by her side Reclining like some faded flower, On which the dew of eventide Exerted no reviving power. And would she leave her pale-browed friend, Too weak and travel-worn to fly, Beneath misfortune's load to bend, And quaff the cup of misery? Again she mused:âa happy thought Relieved her spirit over-wrought, Lighting the chambers of her brainâ Perchance On-yit-ha and De Grai, To rescue them, were on the way, With warriors in their train; But clouds were curtaining the moonâ Dark, dark would be their pathway soon, And guiding runner they would need Through glen and copse the band to lead. XXIII. The Huron, charged night-watch to keep, Betrayed by breathing, long and deep, That his keen eye was sealed in sleep. Again to disengage her hands, Essayed she from encircling bands; And, after many a desperate strain, Parted the leathern cord in twain. Then, to unloose her feet, she triedâ In vain! they were too firmly tied: Numbed was her deeply-furrowed wrist, Her skill the knot could not untwist; She only tightened more the thong, More painful made its pressure strong. And must that young, heroic maid Thus baffled in high purpose be? The slumbering Huron wears a blade, And in its edge is liberty. XXIV. While crept she by approaches slow, With noiseless caution toward her foe, No other light revealed his form Than flashings of the coming storm, And gleams of moonlight struggling through Vapor, and clouds of ebon hue. Softly her moving fingers felt For sheath, depending from his belt, And lightly, by her clasping hand, The weapon's buckhorn-haft was spann'd; Then forth its bladed steel she drewâ One stroke! the tether fell in two; But, whispering in the Huron's ear, Some demon must have hovered near; For, ere her feet the maiden gained, An iron grasp her steps detained. XXV. An instant flashed the knife on high, Lest the reader might think probability violated by making Wun-nut-hay the stern author of a bloody deed, the following extract from an article on the North American Indians, to be found in vol. I., of the Edinburg Encyclopedia, is introduced:â âThe Algonquins being at war with the Iroquois, a woman of the former nation happened to be made prisoner, and was carried to one of the villages belonging to the latter. Here she was stripped naked; and her hands and feet were bound with ropes in one of their cabins. In this condition she remained for ten days, the savages sleeping around her every night. On the eleventh night, when they were asleep, she found means to disengage one of her hands; and freeing herself from the ropes, she went immediately to the door of the hut where she was lodged. Though she had now an opportunity of escaping unperceived, her revengeful temper could not let slip so favorable an opportunity of killing one of her enemies. The attempt was manifestly at the hazard of her own life; yet, seizing a hatchet, she plunged it into the head of a savage who lay next her, and fled.â In the red lightning darting by; The next, within the sentry's breast, A sheath, from point to hilt, it foundâ Heaved, with convulsive throe, his chest, While crimson spouted from the wound: His powerless hand relaxed its hold, Thrilled to his heart a shudder cold; Frothy his quivering lips became; To earth sank heavily his frame; A filmy veil his eye closed o'erâ One groanâthe strong man was no more. XXVI. Griping the bloody weapon fast, Alive to every wandering sound, A hurried glance the maiden cast The shadowy encampment round. Witless, dreamed on the robber-band, Of brother slain by woman's hand; No warrior in his blanket stirr'dâ Waves, wrangling with the rocks, she heard; And sang the blast, old oaks amid, Mournful at times, and wild by starts, As if unhappy fiends lay hid Within their knotty hearts; Streaming in agitated air, Waved, in loose flakes, her unbound hair, While lambent and electric light By fits revealed the lake to sight, Giving the surge a fiery crest, And chasing darkness from its breast. XXVII. Treading upon the grassy sod, As if her foot with moss was shod, Fled, on her errand, Wun-nut-hay; Nor paused to list, or look behind, While groves of outline undefined Before her darkly lay: Boldly she plunged their depths within, Though thorns pierced through her moccasin, And the black clouds, unsealed at last, Discharged their contents, thick and fast, Drenching her locks and vesture slight, And blinding with large drops her sight. XXVIII. The grizzly wolf was on the tramp To gain the cover of his lair; Fierce eyes glared on her from the swamp, As if they asked her errand there. The feathered hermit of the dell Flew hooting to his oaken cell, And grape-vines, tied in leafy coil To gray-armed giants of the soil, Swung like a vessel's loosened shrouds Drifting beneath a bank of clouds. From the pine's huge and quaking cone, Came sobbing and unearthly tone, While trunks decayed, of measure vast, Fought for the last time with the blast, And near her fell with crashing roar That shook the cumbered forest-floor: XXIX. But hurried on the forest-child, Though night and tempest in the wild Engendered sights and sounds of fear; And not one star of friendly ray Her dismal and her dangerous way Looked softly forth to cheer. Passing through brake and watery fen, Unharmed she reached the woody glen, Through which the swift Conesus winds, And the blue lake an outlet finds. XXX. Weary with flight, her agile form Against a hemlock-stem she leaned, When fatigued with the toils of the chase, or requiring rest on a perilous march, the red man goes on his way, refreshed after a brief sleep with his back to a tree, in a leaning posture. âFor several successive nights the warrior did not sleep, only when he reclined, as usual, a little before day, with his back to a tree.â Adair's General Observations on the American Indians. From the rude buffet of the storm By overhanging foliage screened: She tarried there till ceased the rain, Till moonshine silvered night again, And the hoarse clarion of the gale Changed its high note to dying wail; Then, freshened by a little rest, Adventuring forth upon her quest, Along the creek's green marge she sped; And water-drops the grove shook down, When air-gusts waved the branches brown, On her unsheltered head. A wary glance around she threw When loomed the ruined Fort to view; Taught, by the legends of her race, That haunted was the quiet place By vapory phantoms of the dead, The Indians religiously believe, that their old burial places and battle-fields are visited nightly by the stalking ghosts of the dead; also that the footsteps of the murderer are dogged by the restless shadow of the slain. âFriends,â said the tall chief to his blood-stained tribesmen, âyou have killed an Indian in a time of peace, and made the wind hear his groans, and the earth drink his blood. You are bad Indians! Yes, you are very bad Indians; and what can you do? If you go into the woods to live alone, the ghost of John Jemison will follow you, crying, Blood! blood! and will give you no peace! If you go to the land of your nation, there the ghost will attend you, and say to your relatives, See my murderers! If you plant, it will blast your corn; if you hunt, it will scare your game; and when you are asleep, its groans and the sight of an avenging tomahawk will awake you!â On the banks of the bright trout stream that flows through the farm of John McKay, Esq., at Caledonia, was a âplace of torture,â called âCan-ce-a-di,â in the Seneca dialect. The Indians have a tradition that groans proceed from this memorable spot at midnight, and that ghastly shapes peering through the leaves, have often frightened the belated hunter. I was informed by Captain Jones, that the wild glen at Fall Brook, near Geneseo, has been the scene of a tragic story, and that the place is haunted, after night-fall, by a frightful headless spectre. The Indians believe that it is a spot accursed; but the tourist looks with delight upon a scene where beauty contends for mastery with the sublime. Earth echoless beneath their tread, Stalking, with fixed and freezing gaze, 'Mid mouldering wrecks of other days. XXXI. When nigh the scene where, full of wile, The Huron band held parle awhile, And their trail ended in the tide, A sound, like mimicked bleat of deer, Came wafted to her practiced ear From the glen's northern side. The valley, from its depths of shade, Prompt answer to the signal made: Brush cracked beneath the tread of feet; And a dark group of belted men, Led by a chieftain tall and fleet, Gathered within the glen. XXXII. There was an open glade of green The northern bank and wave between, And in its moon-lit centre stood These martial rangers of the wood, Impatient, while compell'd to halt, Like hounds, in chase of game, at fault: One form the maiden would have known Disguised in raiment not his own; But the long plume of raven hue, And wampum-sash, full well she knew. XXXIII. Emerging from the thicket dim, New vigor braced her failing limb, And scarce her foot the herbage brushed, While to On-yit-ha's arms she rushed. Her sudden presence wonder woke, And from the band an outery brokeâ Half doubting evidence of sight; Deeming that phantom of the night Alone would be abroad, to scour So wild a dell, at such an hour: But who is he, of manly frame, Wan visage, and dishevel'd hair, Whose trembling, whitened lips exclaim, âWhere is my Blanche? oh! tell me, where?â One who would fain throw life away, The houseless, wretched, wronged De Grai; But hope on his bruised heart shed rays Like moonlight glimmering through the haze; And his cheek lost its ghastly shade, When told her tale that Indian maid; Recounting, with a graphic power, The capture in his lady's bower, Sad conflagration of the cot, War paint, and costume of the foeâ Their swift departure from the spot, Dreading the twang of hostile bow. XXXIV. She well portrayed the course they took Through dark morass, up channelled brook, Until they reached their camping-groundâ Lone lake in frontâthe woods around: Their caution in not kindling fires, Fearful they might prove funeral-pyres; Then drawing forth, yet red with strife, From underneath her robe, a knife, Narrated she, in modest phrase, The daring nature of the deed By which her prisoned limbs she freedâ The waking sentry's iron grasp, His instant fall, and dying gasp, While stern lips murmured praise. XXXV. âOn!âwe will end the bloody task A woman hath so well begun; Nor shall this brood of adders bask Unharmed beneath to-morrow's sun: The Night-Hawk will not fold his wings Until he robs them of their stings, And the pale chief, from o'er the main, Looks on his stolen one again, And listens, while she fills his ear With music that he loves to hear.â By hand on weapon fiercely laid, And frowning brow, and flashing eye, Each warrior to his leader made A meaning, though a mute reply. Bounding with long and measured lope, Under the greenwood's leafy cope, On-yit-ha urged his warriors on: De Grai moved swiftly by his side, And near was Wun-nut-hay, their guide, Tripping like startled fawn. XXXVI. How sweetly fell the wan moonlight Upon the Huron camp that night, When the wild storm, its fury spent, Undarkened left the firmament! How pleasantly the moonbeam shone When died away the thunder-groan, And waves, in wrath that lately heaved, A glory from its light received; While forest on the shore, and hill, Were imaged in the water still, And vine and flower that grew about, Gemmed by the rain, gave fragrance out! XXXVII. Made restless by his dampened bed, A waking warrior raised his head; Then, rising slowly to his feet, Looked on the lake's unruffled sheet,â Bright dimple on earth's chequered face, A radiant pearl in emerald vase, And mirror meet for Naiad fair To look on when she plaits her hair! It lay a type of holy rest, And primal freshness wrapped its breast; Its surface, smooth as polished steel, Ploughed never by the wandering keel,â Wind, water-fowl and falling shower Its playmates since creation's hour. XXXVIII. So picturesque, so calm a view, Beneath June-skies of cloudless blue, By tranquil charm might well have curbed The tumult of a soul disturbed; And yet that lonely warrior stood, With folded arms, in murky mood. Nervous at times, and scared he seemed As if of evil he had dreamed; In sleep some drear fore-warning heard, Dark curse, or death-denouncing word; And ill his eye of savage glare Comported with a scene so fair. XXXIX. He muttered low:ââWhat leaden weight Rests heavy on my heart of late? Have I not reason to rejoice In spite of that strange, mocking voice That whispered in mine ear of doom, Winged death-shot, and dishonored tomb? Though black cloud lower, or day-beam shine, The guerdon of revenge is mine; I loved her, aye! adored her long, Her name the burden of my song: Though scornful the return I met, Some old affection lingers yet, A faded flower in desert sand, Once a green isle of Fairy-Land. Her frown chased sunshine from my day, A rival bore the prize away; She spurned me with forbidding brow; That proud one is my captive now!â XL. He mused awhile, and thus resumed: âHa! warned again that I am doomed, That guilt hath fearful recompense? Off, juggling fiend! false demon, hence! Though life be nearing fast the goal, Vengeance shall first appease my soul. Her beauty fires my brain no more, Albeit 'twas otherwise of yore. Up from my heart's most secret cells, A fount of bitter water wells; Hope, light it not with moonlight beam, As naptha burns upon the stream; Its black and troubled current knows No quiet ebb, but ever flows; In me the future wakes no fearâ A Hell of pain I suffer here, And, when my vengeance is complete, I pray this pulse may cease to beat! XLI. âHer sire, the Baron gray and old, Will never more his child behold; And yet he was my patron erst, Taught me the game of battle first, For better trump and pawing barb, Than crucifix and priestly garb! He led me from a hovel dim, The wine of joy to quaff with him; But ever, in his lordly hall, Between us interposed a wall: We never met on equal terms, Though both were perishable worms; Bells rang gay peal when he was bornâ In rags I first beheld the morn; Of down his cradle-couch was madeâ On straw my infant limbs were laid; But I was proudânor could I brook, At times, his frigid, stately look That seemed to sayââforget not, boy, The past in your intemperate joy!â Fool!âdid he deem me tutored hound Who yields the quarry up, when found? A jackal who the lion guides Where the sleek antelope abides, Enjoying not the fruits of toil, While power appropriates the spoil? From swooping hawk may tear away The partridge, and its haunt regain; Fast hold have eagles on their preyâ Their talons never clutch in vain.â XLII. The moon went down:âwhile others slept, That wretched man his station kept; Eastward his blood-shot eye he turned, And sign of coming day discernedâ Faint purple streaked night's azure arch; âUp, and away upon our march We must be, ere the sun,â he said, âOr danger in our rear may tread!â XLIII. Low sounds crept on the dusky air, Nor tread of wolfânor tramp of bear; There was a rustling 'mid the trees, And yet there was no wandering breeze, Noise as of leaf, or mouldering root Yielding beneath a cautious foot. Roused from his reverie, he strove To pierce the shadows of the grove; Once more a half-hushed trampling came, A boding tremor shook his frame; âAm I deceived, or scan aright? Dim figures meet my line of sightâ Stand!âwho goes there?â he sharply criedâ A carbine flashedâa yell replied! Well done, bold cavalier of France, Deadly thine aim, and keen thy glance! The wrongs of Blanche, in captive bands, Claimed stern requital at thy hands True was that bullet's airy trackâ The wounded warrior staggered back; To shout defiance he essayed, But hoarse and hollow murmur made. A voice, once heard where sabres crossed, Its full, clear thunder-tone had lost; Numbed was an arm whose might alone, Through serried ranks, red swath had mown, While knightly forms shrank back dismayed By flashes of his fatal blade. XLIV. From leafy couch his Hurons sprang, As if each felt an adder's fang; Their weapons grasped in disarray, While bounding from their cover rushed Avengers, panting for the fray, Like some mad whirlwind on its way When oak is rent and rock is crushed. XLV. Fighting the battle of despair, His tomahawk the Black Fox swung; And, quavering on the troubled air, The war-whoop of On-yit-ha rung. Savage the conflict was, though brief:â Covered with gore, the Huron Chief Fought, with his back against an oak, While hand could deal the hatchet-stroke. Well did that hoary brave maintain Renown achieved in many a fightâ His fall, encircled by the slain, To his thinned band was sign of flight. XLVI. They scattered, in bewildering fear, As flee a broken herd of deer: Foes that knew not the word âforgive,â Followed each panting fugitive. The narrow cape debarred retreat; Some, near the shore, to earth were beat; Others swam out into the lake, But Indian cunning marked their wake; Like otters plunged they down in vain; The bubbling surface caught a stain, Unerring witness to the skill Of marksmen trained such game to kill. XLVII. Through golden portals looked the SUN On fragments of a battle won; Hushed was the frightful noise of route, Wild death-scream, and triumphant shout: Quiet and calm the forest lord Lay on the dark, discolored sward, Or rested in wet, reedy grave, Frighting far off the screaming gull, The gallant scalp-lock of the brave Torn from each grim, denuded skull: The blue-lipped wave stole up the beach, Its red, polluted sand to bleach; Breathing a low and whispered moan, A sad, mysterious undertone, As if it bore a heart, and sighed For those who in that strife had died. XLVIII. Thrice happy, re-united pair! Why paint the locked embrace of love? Enough that, from entangling snare, Flew to her mate a sinless dove; While, by his own black net-work bound, The wily fowler bit the ground. END OF CANTO FIFTH. CANTO SIXTH. THE BATTLE. Fair was the dawn of that eventful day, By conflict ever memorable made, Between trained troops, who owned the Bourbon's sway, And nature's dauntless children of the shade Near Avon's pleasant site:âyon river strayed Through a green, quiet landscape, and the light, New-born and blushing, on the water played: Naught token gave that scene so hushed and bright Would soon ring far and wide, with the wild roar of fight. Alas! man's heart, like the sequestered vale, Peaceful at morn, that rang ere noon with yell, Loud gun-shot, charging cheer and dying wail, Is often thrilling to its inmost cell With happiness one hour before the bell Of black misfortune tolls; while Hope in tears Breathes, on the troubled air, her sad farewell, And hollow Friendship closely stops his ears To sorrow's moan, and Hate his viper-crest uprears. I. Hemmed in by trees of Titan height, In waveless rest, Autaugua lay, While wavering gleams of rosy light Announced the birth of day: Dawn flushed the mist that overspread The waters in their reedy bed, Giving each cloud-fold, thin and gray, A radiant wing to flee away. Along the low and marshy edge, His neck outstretched above the sedge, Wandered the shy and lonely crane, Lord of a sombre, wet domain: From muddy den, with flag-leaf lined, The musk-rat stole, repast to find; Wild pigeons, early on the wing, Woke overhead low thunderingâ Blue, rearward columns mounting high, Scared by the gray hawk's greedy cry. II. Ruins of former forests round Were heaped in spongy, mouldering piles On which the snake his coil unwound, Or charmed the bird by fatal wiles: Flapping of water-fowl, the plunge Of leaping bass and mascalunge; The blue kingfisher's eager scream, Watching the wake of perch, or bream; White swan, with oary feet afloat, Raising a full, clear trumpet-note, Were sounds in keeping with a view As yet unchanged by axe and fire, That wore, when earth was fresh and new, The same dark, picturesque attire. III. Away, an arrow's flight, the pond, Like subject dutiful and fond, The deep and rushing river gave A turbid, tributary wave. Beyond the belt of wood that threw On its dull sheet a darker hue, Broad, level fields of tasseled corn Lay lovely in the light of morn; But horse and foot were on the march, Beneath the greenwood's leafy arch, To rudely break, in bannered pride, The quiet of that prospect wide. IV. Gaunt red men, in light hunting shirts, Stained like the grass and leaves around them, âThey paint their bodies of the same color with the leaves and brush, and lie close to the ground all day.â Crouched in the brambly forest-skirts, As if a spell of witchcraft bound them. The pheasant scratched, where sunshine warmed A patch of forest earth, unharmed; The marmot, near his burrow deep, Played on the sward with clumsy leap; Ungalled, by shaft from toughened bow, Coursed on their runway buck and doe; And, by Autaugua's reedy shores, A brotherhood of beavers wise Protruded, from their hovel-doors, Brown furry heads with staring eyes. V. For other game those hunters true Withheld the shot and loud halloo! Abiding patiently the hour When each might prove his skill and power; While keeping watch for nobler prey, All dumb and motionless were they, Like figures carved from granite gray. The savage of America, when lying in ambush, endures the pangs of hunger and thirst without complaint or motion. âHis eyes, like those of the Argus, see everything, his ears hear every sound, and all his senses employed show that his soul is as active as his body is passive.â Indian Wars. Time, when an Indian warrior lies In ambush, unregarded flies: Though morning lark and whippowil Find him a voiceless watcher still, Unwearied, in their sockets, roll His black and ever-open orbs, While the deep vortex of his soul Alone one vengeful thought absorbs. Though thirst oppress, and hunger gnaw, Woe to the brave who quits his post! The rigid doom of forest-law Degrades him with the name of squaw, And Heaven rejects his ghost. VI. While under cover, thick and green, Those hidden spies kept look-out keen, Their foemen, with extended flank, Were marching on the river-bank. The morning star had seen them rise, By bugle warned, their tents to strike, And form, alert for high emprise, With arquebuse and bristling pike: Their trained battalions, ere the rays Of rising sun dispelled the haze That wrapped the woodland, leaf and limb, In winding sheet obscure and dim, Forded the rapid Hon-e-oye: Dark allies hovered in advance To guard the regulars of France From Seneca decoy. There his swart tribe the Saukie led, Proud of the hawk-plumes on his head; There stalked the Huron armed to slay, And cross upon his bosom bore, Taught by the Jesuit to pray With hand imbrued in human gore; âThe French priests boast indeed of their converts, but they have made more proselytes to politics than religion.â Smith's History of New York, p. 76. âTo their former motives were now added, not only a thirst for revenge, but also an enthusiastic frenzy inspired-from the Romish religion. The French priests even went with the savages, as greater barbarians, to say mass amidst the holy work of massacre.â Indian Wars. There was the Adirondack seen, Like his own hills of iron mien; Half-naked, fierce and wampum-decked, By marshal discipline unchecked, The fleet Ottawa glided there, Drest in the spoils of wolf and bear. VII. It must have been a gallant show, When sunlight reached the valley low, Made by those well-appointed troops: Their glancing arms, half seen, half hid, While moving, at quick time, amid Tall trees in columned groups. Borne in that host were banners old By veterans âall seamed with scars,â With conquest written on each fold, And marked by shot of former wars: Whose wings at Steenkirk, on the blast, Had flapped when blood ran warm and fast; Banners which haughtily had streamed When Luxemburg in armor gleamed, Leading, with trenchant sabre drawn, The whirlwind of the battle on. VIII. Of proven valor was the chief, âThe Marquis De Nonville was distinguished as a brave and active officer.â Murray's British America, vol. i. p. 183. And worthy of the laurel leaf, Who led that chivalrous array; His steed, adorned with harness bright, He managed like a youthful knight, Although his head was gray. Behind him pranced a mounted guard Of men at arms, with visors barredâ Beneath him, in command alone, Rode a tall warrior by his side; And much of trouble had he known, Unless soured look, and cheerless tone, The heart within belied. A few stray locks of glistening snow, Fell his bruised morion below, But wintry age had left untamed An eye, at times, that fiercely flamed; And though his leader on parade Would nobler chevalier have made, Still his broad chest and martial front, Bronzed o'er by toil, and weather-stain, Told plainly that it was his wont To bide the roaring onset's brunt Upon the battle-plain. IX. âTwice, Baron, has the tedious night Been reddened by our watch-fires bright; Twice has the morning sunbeam found Our force afoot on hostile ground, And nothing in the shape of foe Has brandished axe, or bended bowââ Murmured De Nonville, in disdain, Stroking his courser's flowing mane. âThe rich, green forests of a land, So beautiful on every hand, Diversified by upland-swell, Bright-leaping rill, and flowery dell; Another race, methought, possessed Than these dark Senecas, misnamed The tawny Romans of the west!ââ The stern, old warrior exclaimed. X. âCurse that false Jesuitâârejoined The fiery Marquisââwho has coined A lying tale for knightly ears, Of On-gui-hon-wi pride and power! Their hunting-grounds a Frank might scour, And find no foe in wood or bower, Though marked was every leaf and flower With one good plump of spears.â âI marvel what detains De Lisle, That man half-soldier, and half-priest! He comes not, and the sun, meanwhile, Looks from his watch-tower in the east. My orders were, ere break of day, That back he should retrace his way, And at head-quarters make report Of trail the most direct, whereby Our vanguard might surprise a Fort The Big-Bend of yon river nigh. XI. âAttended, or alone to scout Forth went he in our line of route?â âThrough fear of ambuscade at hand, With him he took, by my command, The crafty Black Fox and his bandââ Answered the Baron, while a cloud Darkened the brow it overspread In furrows by affliction ploughed, And with a stifled groan he bowed, In agonizing thought, his head. Ah! wildly were his heart-strings torn! Hope had he cherished on that morn To look upon the lost restoredâ His fair-haired Blanche, the long-deplored! Last scion of an honored race, And once more in her features trace A transcript of that mother's face, Who died in giving birth to her, Whose dwelling was the sepulchre. XII. Promise the Jesuit had made, With hand on cross devoutly laid, To die, or with his child return Ere morning dried night's dewy urn: That hour was passed:âwhy tarried he? Naught save low breeze, and rustling tree, Dull, measured tramp of column long, Loud oath, rude jest, and losel song, Clangor of mail, and sabre's ring Replied to his self-questioning. XIII. When the long line, from forest gray, Debouched in glittering array, And, with a lighter movement, trod Green floors of fresh, unshadowed sod, Stretching away to groves unhewn Autaugua round, that dark lagoon! Well might their general declare, Eye never looked on vale more fair. The valley of the Genesee, though romantic and wild at, and around the Upper Falls, is more remarkable for the quiet beauty of its landscape than for startling sublimity. âThe alluvial flats through which the river meanders, are from one to two miles in width, as level as a placid lake, and as fertile, to say the least, as any land in this state. Thousands of acres of these flats were cleared of their timber when Indian tradition commences their description. These flats are encompassed on each side by a rolling country gradually rising as it recedes from the river, but in no place so abrupt as to merit the cognomen of a hill. This was the terrestrial paradise of the Senecas, and to this tract they gave the name of Gen-ish-a-u, Chen-ne-se-co, Gen-ne-se-o, or Gen-ne-see, as pronounced by the different Indian tribes, and being interpreted, all meaning substantially the same, to wit: shining, clear openingâpleasant, clear openingâclear valley, or pleasant open valley.â Wind wafted fragrance, and his steed Sank, fetlock-deep, in beds of flowers; Brooks wimpled by, in playful speed, And ancient pines beyond the mead, Reared their dark, emerald towers. XIV. âBy Jesuit though falsely told, Broad valley! that thy sons were bold, A truth was uttered when he said Thy breast an Eden lay outspreadâ That spoken word would ill express Thy pure, primeval loveliness! Here, should the lilies o'er the brave Float while yon river rolls a waveâ Here, knees in homage should be bent To Louis, the magnificent! In spite of armies hither led, Bearing aloft the Cross of Red, Though howled, like wolves upon the track, The Five Leagued Nations at their back!â Thus, curbing in his war-horse fleet, While his heroic soul was tuned To rapture by that vision sweet, De Nonville with himself communed. XV. In forest warfare better taught, A shaded trail his allies sought, Where twilight held unquestioned reign, Avoiding flat, and open plain. Limber in motion as the snake, Oft would some scout thick top of tree His screened observatory make, âTheir grand object, however, is to surprise a village, and if possible, the principal one belonging to the hated tribe. Thither all their steps tend, as they steal like silent ghosts through the lonely forest. On approaching it, they cast hasty glances from the tops of trees, or hillocks, and then retreat into the thickest covert.â Murray. And look forth, long and patiently. No object round was too minute For their keen, critical survey; Their organs, practiced and acute, Marked grassy blade and waving spray; Each starry moss-tuft on the stone, Each leaf about by air-gust blown. Cautious their progress was, and slow, Hunting for sign of hidden foe; Heeding the squirrel's frolic bark, The wood-worm's tick, in crevice dark, Or close to earth applying ear, Better some far-off sound to hear. XVI. Southward the gleaming ranks moved on Across a flower-enameled lawn, Their weapons flashing in the light; Dark Genesee upon their right; Gliding along, with even flow, To join the blue Ontario. Distant a crow's flight, darkly towered, Upon the left, a ridge of hills, In waving groves of oak embowered, And musical with birds and rills. At times the soldier looked around, Thinking he trod on pasture-ground, Or clearing by the woodman made Within a fresh, young land of shade: No cottage-home met his regard, Nor blackened stump, nor log-heap charred; There, never had the scythe been swungâ There, sharpened axe had never rung, Sleek heifer lowed, nor milk-maid sung! A place of bloom and smiles it lay, Nature's free gift to golden day. XVII. Facing the west each cohort wheeled When near the borders of the pond, While a dark wall of wood concealed All objects that might lie beyond; Before them, in the sunshine's blaze, Basked flaunting rows of glossy maize, Bearing, upon their emerald spears, A heavy load of infant ears; While podded bean, and melon-vine, Sated with draughts of dewy wine, Clothed in gay garniture the mould; But wasting War turned not aside, And through that rich plantation rolled His stern and desolating tideâ Germs of abundance blotting out, And blasting greenness in his route. XVIII. When a dark, hollow way was gained, Bed of a stream for ages drained, De Nonville, riding in the van, Made momentary halt to scan, On an elm-trunk, of bark bereft, The pictured outlines of a man Transfixed by dart, by hatchet cleft. By a few rude images on the bark of trees, they communicate to others whatsoever intelligence they deem important. âThere are some Indian Gazettes. On a tree in Moultonboro' is carved a history of one of their expeditions. The number of the killed and captivated were represented by so many human figures. The stroke of a knife across the throat designated the killed. Even the sexes had some intelligible mark of distinction. âThey use many ingenious expedients to communicate their ideas to their absent friends. By erecting a pole and marking its shadow on the sand, or pointing it so as to cast no shadow, they are able to inform their followers, of what time of the day they were in such a place, and by lopping down a few bushes they clearly intimate which way they are gone.â âIn Kellyvale, is yet to be seen something like an attempt at painting. The bark of a large tree is stripped off as high as a man can reach; with a stain of a lively color, an Indian with a gun is painted, with his face towards the north. Beside him, is a skeleton sketched with a considerable degree of anatomical exactness. The whole is a kind of gazette, in which the Indian informs his company which was to follow him, that one of their number was dead, and that the survivor was proceeding with safety on his way to Canada.â Indian Wars. âHo! Lamberville!â the Marquis cried, Accosting an experienced guideâ âThe meaning of this daub explain, For new and fresh appears the stain!â XIX. âYon sketch conveys monition stern That blood will flow, and powder burn, Unless our trumpets sound return;â Is warning to invader given, That never will the native fierce From his old hunting-ground be driven, While arm can strike, and weapon pierce! His tribe have laid a deadly snare, And near us lie in bushy lair; The red confederates of France, That lately hovered in advance, Are gliding swiftly back, in fear, To gain a cover in our rear: My counsel, governor, would be From thicket-edge to keep away, And, westward, near the Genesee, Our line of march at once to lay!â XX. âThe Senecas, by arts like these, Blood in a Huron's heart may freeze; But warrior who has braved the fight On fields where knight encountered knight, Would ill his belt and spurs deserve, One inch in his career to swerve, Though every tree, in forest blind, A savage hid its trunk behind.â XXI. The headmost of the line at last Autaugua's narrow outlet passed; But while they forced, in disarray, Through hazel underbrush their way, From earth grim, crouching figures rose, Like mountain-cats prepared to spring, Counting the number of their foes, With shafts notched lightly on the string; They cowered for one brief moment there, But, ere the next flew swiftly by, Rang out upon the throbbing air, Their wild and startling battle-cry: Bard hath no power to picture well The might of that demoniac yell; Back, back recoiled the valiant then, And felt the frozen hand of fear Knock at their hearts, as if a den, By lions watched, lay yawning near! Then whirling swiftly round and round, While a winged storm of arrows flew, A pathway red the hatchet found, Barred morion and hauberk through. XXII. Distinguished by his snow-white crest, De Nonville, calm and self-possest, Gave, amid uproar wild and high, Command with martial brevity: His presence discipline restored, He formed the broken ranks againâ Flashed, in the staggering van, his sword, While reared his horse by missile gored, And men at arms were round him slain. âDismount, dismount, Le Troye! and break Their cover with my Rangers through; Let the long rifle music make, In answer to this yelping crew!â XXIII. From his war-saddle to the ground, Leaped the gray veteran with a bound, While rattled sharply on his mail, Rough, flinty arrow-heads like hail, And forward, with elastic tread, Promptly the charging party led. Bold was the rush, and sternly met By natives never daunted yet; Loudly mad whoop and rifle-crack By forest-arch were echoed back: The ponderous war-club's weighty stroke, Clubbed gun-stocks into pieces broke, Their weapons of war are very few. Their war-club was formed out of a root, or limb of a tree, made into a convenient shape, with a knot at one end, of use in case of close engagement with an enemy. A stake hardened in the fire at one end, was used as a sort of spontoon, useful in destroying an enemy, or keeping him at a little distance. Their lance was pointed with a flint or a bone. A war-club was sometimes used, with a blade like the spear of a lance inserted in the side near the upper end of it. Col. Stone, in his life of Brant, alludes to one with marks on its handle denoting the number of persons killed, and scalps taken by the means of it. And, blunted in its swift career, On breast-plate rang the point of spear, Frank, and the son of hunter-race, Breast to breast, and face to face, Grappled in desperate embrace; And fast the dinted forest-floor Grew red and slippery with gore. XXIV. Awhile the Senecas maintained, Combating hand to hand, their ground; Then a reluctant flight they feigned On a dim trail that southward wound. Darting about, from tree to tree, With panther-like agility, Well-aimed discharges of their bows Annoyed their hot pursuing foes, Whose rapid volleys, in return, Wounded alone the brush and fern. XXV. Soon did the scene of conflict change From open-wood to deeper shade, Where, piled up in confusion strange, Lay mouldering elm and oak decayed; At once the hoary knight foresaw That a dark plot had been designed, By wily enemies, to draw His corps into ambushment blind, Where craft, not valor, would avail, And fire-lock prove protection frail. âHalt! my brave comrades, one and all; De Nonville's bugle's sound recall!â Shouted the Baron out, in vain: Like blood-hounds who had tasted gore, And bayed upon the track for more, His men dashed on amain. XXVI. Obstructions thickened in their way, And momently the light of day, As they advanced, grew less and less, Within that hideous wilderness: Their progress difficult and slow Was often made by quagmire low, That weight of frog could scarcely bear, Dotted with grass-tufts, coarse and spare:â Unstirr'd by breeze, an awning spread, Dismal and shaggy overhead, That woven seemed in midnight's loom; But floundered on the Rangers rash, Vexed and bewildered, while the flash Of ringing rifles lit the gloom. XXVII. Fruitless their toil!âunharmed by lead, Their taunting foes before them fled; And thrill of disappointment passed Through many a rough and war-worn frame, When gaunt, retiring forms at last, Brown shadows closing round them fast, Confused and indistinct became. Tumultuous sounds of flight and chase Ceased for a time in thicket wild, As if the Spirit of the place Awed fiery Frank and forest-child. XXVIII. When paused his party breath to take After long chase through brush and brake, Fatigue and wounds the bitter fruit Of mad, disorderly pursuit,â Le Troye another trial made To lead them back to open glade, And felt, in labyrinthine shade, Like mariner, his compass lost, On unknown sea befogged and tost, Far from safe port and friendly shore; While evil bark that lured him thither, Gliding away he knew not whither, Displayed black flag no more. XXIX. No well-worn wood-path was in sight To guide his soldiery aright; And sharply he rebuked his band Who followed up a wily foe, In disregard of loud command No farther in advance to go. âAs well might hunter try to bring Falcon at bay upon the wing, As Christian troops, in forest haunt, Wage warfare with the savage gaunt!â He muttered, looking round to find Outlet from swamp obscure and blind. XXX. Caparisoned, from head to heel, In corslet, greaves, and cap of steelâ Encumbered by a gorgeous dress That ill beseemed a wilderness, Struggled the party to retrace Their way from that benighted place Chilled by the grove's eternal frown: Their feet, encased in heavy boots, Stumbled among ensnaring roots, Or in the bog plunged down: At random thus they fared, until They reached a lazy, winding rill, Near its dull junction with a pool Whose dark expanse lay hushed and cool, When suddenly, with bended bows, A cloud of savages arose, Attacking them in rear and front, Howling like wood-wolves when they hunt Through wintry wastes,âa grizzly gang, Bitten by hunger's pointed fang. XXXI. A hurtling stream of feathered darts Riddled fair forms and gallant hearts; Well might the boldest feel dismay! Swept were the leading files away Like the round prairie's herbage dry Before a flame when winds are high. By menace and entreating word, Above the roar of battle heard, Rallied the knight his flying troops, Broken in panic-stricken groups. Though blanched his hair, from casque escaped, And thinn'd by Time's unsparing shears, His frame, for martial prowess shaped, Retained the might of other years; His flashing eye and lifted arm, In that dread crisis of alarm, A knightly scorn of fear revealed Worthy of Bayard when he met, By overwhelming odds beset, Death on his last red field. XXXII. He charged, to break the hostile ring His serried ranks encompassing, Thrice, with a cheer, in vain; Five hundred bows the shaft propelled, Five hundred throats the war-cry yelled, And, one by one, the knight beheld His ill-starred Rangers slain. XXXIII. Warned by a runner of his band That Yonnondio was at hand, âTheir orator came forward and addressed the Governor General by the title of Ononthio (or Yonnondio,) which in their language, signifies great mountain; and though it was in reference to his name of Montmagny, they continued ever after to apply this term to the French viceroy. They often added the respectful appellation of father.â Murray's British America, vol. i. p. 166. Speeding with Indian guides, to aid His brethren trapped in ambuscade, Old Can-ne-hoot, by loud halloo, A knot of braves around him drew, Resolved that tomahawk and knife Should end at once the desperate strife; Prompt the dread movement to discern, Exclaimed the Knight, in accent sternâ âMy lads, prepare their rush to meet, And, mark ye, there is no retreat! Throw not an ounce of lead awayâ God and St. Dennis be our stay!â XXXIV. There was a momentary hush; Then, giving cry like unleashed hounds, Dashed forward, with impetuous rush, Wild warriors clearing brake and bush, In quick, elastic bounds: Guns, levelled with destructive aim, Poured forth a crimson sheet of flame, Ringing, in one explosion loud, The knell of many a warrior proud; But staunch survivors faltered not, While round them hissed the raking shot, Old Can-ne-hoot, their forest-king, Through sulphurous vapor following. XXXV. As avalanche, from mountain-head Descending with resistless force, Upwrenches from primeval bed Huge blocks of granite in its course; As freshet, swollen in its flow By heavy rain, dissolving snow, Against a bridge of massive arch, Too frail for its restrainless march, Dashing in thunder and in spray, Timber and buttress tears away;â Thus back that Indian onslaught bore Crushed phalanx that could form no more. Followed a diabolic yell When foeman, brained by hatchet, fell; Though the poor, mangled wretch yet breathed, Dark fingers, in his hair enwreathed, Secured, by aid of teeth and knife, Grim, reddened trophies of the strife. Placing a foot on the neck of his fallen enemy, and twisting a hand in the hair, the warrior draws a long, sharp-pointed knife, specially formed for this operation; then cutting a circle around the crown of the head, by a few skilful scoops, sometimes aided by the teeth, the hair and skin are detached. See Charlevoix, Rogers' Concise Account and Adair. XXXVI. A gallant remnant of the Franks, Though shattered and o'erthrown their ranks, Fought, fearfully outnumbered, on, And buffet dealt with arms of brawn Encircled by a howling crew; His armor hacked, with blood-drops wet, A leader's voice and presence yet Cheered that devoted few. Enraged to see his boldest braves Recoil like spent and broken waves Encountered by an iron strand, Old Can-ne-hoot, his scalp-lock white Dancing in air, upon the knight Rushed, tomahawk in hand. XXXVII. Though partly parried was the blow, Its force unhelmed his stalwart foe, Whose eye flashed lightning, while his blade Wounded with every pass it made. Equal in yearsâin height the same, Both known by martial deed to fame, Fought, with youth's ardor uncontroll'd, Stroke answering strokeâthose warriors old. Unblenching, though in copious tide Oozed the dark gore from gashes wide, The Sachem, naked to the waist, His mail-sheathed adversary faced. XXXVIII. His glance more deadly and malign Grew while he felt his strength declineâ More proud a spirit in which burned Impulse that fear and mercy spurned Regardless of unequal fight, His long leg-knife he drew, When the sharp weapon of the knight Descending, clove the handle light Of his war-axe in two. Not fleeter pouncing eagle flies To rob the fish-hawk of his prize; Shark, scenting a repast of blood, Not swifter hurries through the flood, Than, dodging death-blow, by the wrist Seized he his dread antagonist, Whose left arm free, a pistol press'd Against the maddened Indian's breast: A bright flash heralded the ballâ One moment stood, erect and tall, Old Can-ne-hootâthe next, he fell, His frowning brow still terrible; Low was a mighty Sachem broughtâ His last fight had a brave man fought! XXXIX. Have ye not seen, on Western plain, When leader, shagg'd and old, is slain, With angry roaring on their foes, Gallop a herd of buffaloes; Huge forms in front, unstaid by fear, Pushed onward by the frantic rear; Their eyes, while horns tossed high in air, Glowing like coals through matted hair? Impelled by wrath more frightful far, Waking the wildest howl of warâ To higher pitch of frenzy fired, When, grasping knife, their Chief expired, Avenging sons of forest brown, To earth, in one dread rush, bore down Their foemen few and tired. XL. De Nonville, from a fearful doom, Too late arrived his van to save; Strewed was a place of blood and gloom With shattered gun and tarnished plume, Cleft helm and broken glaive. The native raised retreat-halloo! When, sounding charge, his bugle blewâ Just finished their employment dread Of scalping the disfigured dead. Ah! well might that revolting scene Give paleness to his troubled mien! Where were his gallant rifle-corps Who mustered, full of life, at morn? High would their pulses beat no more When banner waved and blade was drawn! Allâall had died save leader gray, A pinioned captive borne away, Reserved for torture at the stake By tribesmen, filled with rage and grief, That glad the wandering ghost would make Of Can-ne-hoot, their fallen chief. In the dreadful work of torture the women take the lead, and seem transformed into raging furies. She, to glut whose vengeance the doom has been specially pronounced, invokes the spirit of her husband, her brother, or her son, who has fallen in battle, or died amid torture, bidding him come now and be appeased. XLI. Galled by the sting of wounded prideâ By dark disaster mortified, The baffled Marquis offered gold For Iroquois scalps in vain; Cowed were his allies to behold, Their couch the swamp's defiling mould, Hacked forms of Frenchmen slain:â Boughs bending o'er them, sad of hue, As if old elms around that grew, Dropped down a melancholy pall, And mourned, though mute, their timeless fall. END OF CANTO SIXTH. CANTO SEVENTH. THE REVELATION. They bound him to the fatal stake, and high Destruction's fagots round the warrior piled: There was unwonted moisture in his eye, For prayed he, in that moment, for his child; A torch was thrown, by hand with blood defiled, On the dark death-pyre:âwhence, oh! whence the shriek That, rising shrill above the tumult wild, Tinged with a wanner shade the victim's cheek, While parted his blanched lips in vain essay to speak? I. Retreating from the fatal spot Where Valor died, but yielded not, Thickly the Senecas o'erspread, With hiding brush and leaves, their dead:â It is a custom with Indian warriors to conceal their losses from the enemy. They exert themselves to the utmost to prevent their slain from falling into hostile hands. Even while the battle is raging, old Indian fighters have seen âFigures of men that crouch and creep unheard, And bear away the dead.â For, sorrowing would warrior go, Dishonored by the knife of foe, To lands the setting sun below. When reached the river's willowed side, Pirogues they launched upon the tide, And, landing on the western shore, A moment looked the landscape o'er. The matted forest-depths were mute; Heard was no 'larum on the gale, Announcing Frank in close pursuit, Or hated Huron on the trail. Checked by the Romans of the West, Invader paused, with drooping crest, To scoop for brethren where they fell In earth a rude receptacle: Knowing that scream of carrion-bird Another day would there be heard, While snarling monster of the wold Snuffed tainted air, and pawed the mould. II. Thou phantom, Military Fame! How long will Genius laud thy name, And curtain features from the sight, More foul than those Khorassen's seer Hid behind veil of silver bright, Tempting his victim to draw near? How long will thy misleading lamp, Through regions wrapped in smoke and fire, To slaughter's cavern, red and damp, Guide beardless boy and gray-haired sire? Up, fearless battlers for the right, And flood old groaning earth with light! Bid nations ponder well and pause, When blade corrupt ambition drawsâ Oh! teach the world that conquest wears A darker brand than felon bears; Prolific fount, from earliest time, Of murder, orphanage and crime! III. Obtained, at last, returning band A view of fortress, rudely plann'd, Fenced by huge palisadoes round, And wanting bastion, trench and mound. Its anxious inmates, wild of face, Rushed in a body from the place, While rose, from forest edge, a cry, Now plaintive, lowânow shrill and highâ At the close of the expedition, the warriors repair to their village, and, in approaching, announce its results by various signals well understood among their families. According to the most approved custom, the evil tidings are first communicated. A herald advances before the troop, and for every kinsman who has fallen, sounds the death-whoop, a shrill, lengthened note, ending in an elevated key. An interval is then allowed, during which the burst of grief excited by their tidings, may be in some degree exhausted. Then rises the loud, quavering sound of the war-whoop, which by its successive repetitions expressed the number of captives brought home as the fruits of victory. The barbarous joy thus kindled, banishes for the moment all traces of lamentation. See Adair, Charlevoix. âThere was no prisoner put to the torture, or attired in the raven death-cap on this occasion, but the prisoners were paraded, and the scalps borne in the procession, as would have been the standard taken in civilized warfare in the celebration of a triumph. For every scalp and for every prisoner taken, the scalp-yell, or, as it is sometimes called, the âdeath halloo,â was raised in all its mingled tones of triumph and terror.â Stone's Life of Brant. The imitative powers of the red man almost exceed belief. On one occasion, says Champlain, they constructed a wooden enclosure of a triangular form, each side nearly a mile long, with a narrow opening at the point, into which, by loud cries, and imitating the howling of wolves, they contrived to drive all the deer in the vicinity. Each repetition of the call Announcing an invader's fall. News thus, to children of the shade, By marked, expressive sound conveyed, Telling of victory achieved, All, with a frantic joy, received; And hurried on to meet, the while, Plumed martial forms in Indian file Advancing:âslow and dignified Their march across the clearing wide. IV. Red pole in front a savage bore, On which hung scalps begrimed with gore; Behind him came the captive knight, Wounded, and stripped of armor brightâ His figure of heroic mould Fixing regard of young and old, Who augured, from his dauntless air, That torture he would bravely bear, And, as beseemed a warrior, die Giving no groan of agony. V. Changed was wild ecstasy to grief, When, looking vainly for their chief, Ran glances of the troubled throng, From man to man, the line along. A melancholy wail and low Told of a leader's overthrow; To hollow dirge-notes for the dead The long procession timed its tread, For lord had Can-ne-wa-gus lost; In the Seneca dialect, the word Cannewaugus means âstinking water.â It was the aboriginal name of the far-famed Avon Springs, the medical properties of which have been found unsurpassed in the cure of various diseases. On the east side of the Genesee, near the old site of Cannewaugus, the pleasant village of West Avon crowns an elevated ridge of land, environed by romantic scenery, and overlooking the river's green and quiet valley. And mourning tribe, from child to seer, Deemed triumph bought at fearful cost, Marred by the fall of one so dear. VI. Passed was the middle hour of day, Down poured the sun a milder ray, When elders of the tribe convened, To fix the doom of captive brave, Beneath old oaks whose umbrage screened Partly from sight the council grave. From long-stemmed pipes rose fragrant fumes, And curled around their eagle-plumes; Awhile impressive silence reigned, And sitting posture each maintained. Men of inferior renown Formed outer ring of faces brown, And near, life giving to the scene, Dark beldame of malignant mien, And stripling, armed with tiny bow, On noiseless feet moved to and fro, A better view of Frank to gain Who mighty Can-ne-hoot had slain. VII. At length a man of many snows, A forest patriarch, arose; Bright medal on his bosom shone, And richly broidered was his zone; Closely he drew his robe of skin Around a shrunken frame and thin, Then thus harangued his brethren sage In the cracked, trembling tones of age:â âHeirs of a country, green and wide, O'erran and conquered by your sires, In vain hath Yonnondio tried To quench, in war's ensanguined tide, One of the Five Great Fires! Its smoke-clouds rising, thick and high, Have filled with tears his blinded eye; Its angry blaze his hand hath burnedâ The hatchets of my tribe are redâ But home the chief hath not returned Who Yonnondio's fury spurned, And forth the brave to battle led.â VIII. âAt morn, upon the dew-webbed glade, His moccasin no impress made; Swifter than eagles were his feetâ Who could in craft with him compete? His voice was deeper in its tone Than trumpet by the storm-king blown, And his dread arm no second blow In battle gave opposing foe. By lightning of the Pale-Face slain, Alone let not the Mighty stray, Across a wide and dreary plain, Toward the Green Isles of endless day. I hear his whisper on the galeâ He calls upon yon captive pale The briers from his path to clear: The relatives of a fallen warrior often demand of their tribe the immediate execution of a captive, to appease his troubled ghost, and clear away the briers, for his safe passage to the hunting-grounds of the happy. Men of Ge-nun-de-wah, awake! And high, around the blackened stake, The funeral-pile uprear!â IX. To interjections of assent Gave his dark auditory vent While the time-honored prophet spoke; And when, with flashing eye, they heard Die on the breeze his closing word, The ring its order broke: A tribe's united lips poured out One frightful and revengeful shoutâ Hags laughed, and clapped their skinny hands Till rattled loud their bracelet-bands; In side-long dance like demons yelled, Startling and mystic orgies held, And sentenced prisoner abused, To every term of insult used. X. They told him that his nation base Were whiter far of heart than faceâ That petticoat, not warrior's crest And costume, would beseem him best, And squaw, that gave him birth, did style The mother of a coward vile. 'Mid taunting screams of fierce delight, Tribesmen for cruelty renowned, And decked with spoils of recent fight, To painted post the Christian knight With toughened ligature then bound. Tormentors drew his foot upon The fatal bear-skin moccasin; And flaming torch placed o'er his head âThe captive is informed of his fate by being invested with moccasins of black bear's-skin, and having placed over his head a flaming torch, the sure indications of his doom. Before the fatal scene begins, however, he is allowed a short interval to sing his death-song, which he performs in a triumphant tone. He proclaims the joy with which he goes to the land of souls, where he will meet his brave ancestors, who taught him the great lesson to fight and the greater one to suffer. He recounts his war-like exploits, particularly those performed against the kindred of his tormentors; and if there was any one of them whom he vanquished and caused to expire amid tortures, he loudly proclaims it. He declares his inextinguishable desire to cut their flesh, and to drink their blood to the last drop. The scene is considered, even when compared to the field of battle, as the great theatre of Indian glory. When two prisoners were about to be tortured by the French at Quebec, a charitable hand privately supplied a weapon with which one of them killed himself; but the other derided his effeminacy, and proudly prepared himself for the trial.â Murray's British America, vol. i. p. 120. An emblem sure of fiery doom, On his white hair a radiance shed, And lit the wild-wood's leafy gloom. XI. No vain appeal for life he madeâ From arm of flesh hoped not for aid; A glance, that seemed to say âadieu!â On sublunary things he threw, And strove, with mind composed, to meet A fate with agony replete. He longed, in that dark trial-hour, On Blanche, his erring child, to gazeâ Erewhile his fondly cherished flower, And light of his declining days; He yearned upon her head to pour A father's benison once more, And hear his name pronounced in tone, Gentle and lowâher mother's own. XII. Pine splinters, resinous and dry, Light brush, and sere leaves of the wild, A death-pyre forming loose and high, Round the brave veteran were piled, And redly shone a crackling brand, To light it, in the prophet's hand; But, ere the smoking fuel blazed, Heard was the marked, peculiar cry By Indian warrior ever raised When camp-ground of his nation nigh. Arrested by that signal loud Was torture's work;âand on the crowd A momentary silence fell;â Then rose a shrill, responsive yell As all imperfectly descried, Through net-work of the leaves, at last, De Grai and his recovered bride, Young Wun-nut-hay, the green-wood's pride, And cinctured forms, with faces dyed In battle-paint, approaching fast. XIII. The motley multitude beheld Another spectacle disclosed, When towering oaks, all gray with eld Their trunks no longer interposed. Four Senecas on hurdle bore A pale-browed warrior wounded sore; Though moss the wattled osiers lined On which his helpless limbs reclined, And moved, without rude jar, along, His bearers, firm of tread and strong, To stifle broken moan of pain He tasked his ebbing strength in vain: And though a day in flowery June Not long had passed its fervid noon, Shook the poor wretch, as if with cold, And hollow cheek and glassy eye Impressively beholder told That his last hour was speeding by. XIV. Air rang with shouts when nearer drew, In ordered line, the comers new; And when low boughs concealed no more Bound victim by his funeral-pyre, There came a sudden paleness o'er The cheek of Blancheâand her old sire Glared wildly on encircling foes, Like one just woke from horrid dream, And, clear above the din, arose His frantic daughter's frightful scream. XV. âGive way, incarnate fiends, give way!â Shouted impetuous De Graiâ Wrath glittered in his proud dark eye, His unsheathed dagger flashed on high, And parted while he dashed along, As keel divides rough waves, the throng. On burning brand he fearless trode, Through kindling fagots opened road, And, though black clouds of heated smoke Their blinding folds around him twined, He cut, with quick, indignant stroke, Bands that the fainting knight confined. XVI. âHo! Senecas!âand will ye see, Unmoved, the foe yon captive free? Down with the white intruder, down! And scalp hack piece-meal from his crown!â Aroused by taunt of wrinkled seer, And grasping bow, war-axe and spear, At once fierce forms begirt De Grai, Bearing from stake Le Troye away; As booming waters of the deep Round some lone sea-rock darkly sweep When evil powers the storm unchain, And skill of mariner is vain. Already leaving bloody trace, Long, whistling shaft had grazed his face, And flying hatchet from his head, A glossy lock of brown had shred, When cleared On-yit-ha, with a bound, The living wall that hemmed him round, And made, attention to command, A haughty toss of lifted hand; Then to full height his form updrew, And thus rebuked the savage crew:â XVII. âRash, shameless men! would ye o'erthrow Laws honored by the great of yore? Drop tomahawk, unstring the bow, And to its sheath the knife restore! My brother, whom ye fain would slay, Though wearing still the pallid shade By fathers caught from ocean's spray, The red-man believes that the first parents of the pale race sprung from the foam of the salt water. Is clansman by adoption made. Long in our vale he hath encamped; My totem on his breast is stamped, And Can-ne-hoot on him conferred A name that rings like battle-word!â They are exceedingly bigoted as to names. They give themselves those which are very expressive, denoting some interesting object in nature, or some historical event. They change their own names, as new events present occasions. They are much pleased when the white people assign them names; and in return they select names for their white friends, which are strikingly significant of some prominent trait in their character, showing that they are critical observers of human nature. âThe Indians wear by way of amulet or charm, the feathers of certain birds whose names they bear, believing that they confer on the wearer all the virtues or excellencies of those birds.â Allusion to their fallen chief, From dusky throng called groan of grief, And wond'ring orator inquired Why thus they mourned?âthen mischief fired The wily Prophet's serpent eye, And moved his lips in prompt reply:â XVIII. âHis face great Ou-we-nee-you veils Behind a black and lowering cloud; For Can-ne-hoot a nation wailsâ The monarch-pine in dust is bowed: Protecting roof his branches cast Above our heads when roared the blast; Through rolling years his aged form Defied red bolt of growling storm; Mad whirlwinds wrestled with his trunk, And from the dread encounter shrunk; But never more to glad our eyes, Above the forest-tops will rise His brow undimmed by winter's blight, His crown rejoicing in the light.â XIX. âWhy tell On-yit-ha of the fame That lustre gives paternal name? No eulogist red warrior needs From Erie to the Salt Lake knownâ The tale of whose heroic deeds Swift courier-winds abroad have blown. In battle with yon pale-face fell The ruler that we loved so well: He slumbers with his broken bow, Rude covering of leaves below, Pierced by the lightning of the foe. XX. âBy young and old he was revered, Proud far-off tribes his anger feared Death in a hundred wars he faced, His lodge a thousand trophies graced. On the green prairies of the west, And where, through wilderness remote, Missouri rolls with turbid breast, Pawnee and Omahaw he smote. At their own hearths his arrow shot The Chictaghic and Wyandot:â He woke, on banks of southern stream, Catawba from his midnight dream, And victor paced the lonely shore On which, in foam dissolving, breaks Forever, with a solemn roar, The dark blue SIRE of mighty Lakes.â XXI. Emotion of revenge and grief A passing moment shook the chief, And covered with a cloud his face, Then gave to nobler feelings place. âThe task is difficult, old SEER, Deep groans of anguish to repress While rings announcement in mine ear That I am fatherlessâ That he, the mighty one, is slain, On whom the Five Great Tribes in vain, When boughs, wrenched off by whirlwinds, fall From tree of peace, henceforth will call. The proudest seat, at council fire, Is vacant made by death of sire; And loud will be the voice of wail For Eagle of this river-vale In the bright fulness of renown, And fighting for our homes, struck down: But in our sorrow feel we not That his must be a happy lot; For spirits of the just and brave Pass, when the war of life is done, To a green land, that knows no grave, Outspread below the setting sun. XXII. âIn fair encounter with his foe, Eye meeting eye, and foot to foot, Yon wounded chief, with locks of snow, Shot down the mighty Can-ne-hoot; And, like proud ancestors of old, Heroes in reverence I hold Regardless of their race and name:â Enough that they are heirs of fame Who scorn dishonorable deed, And born their fellow-men to lead! Yon Pale-Face, who my father slew, Hath proved himself a warrior true; And time the law hath hallowed made That gives red native of the shade, When death hath sadly thinn'd the band, A right war-captive to demand, The survivors of the slain, may demand revenge for their loss, or solicit that the captives be spared to supply the vacancy. The stranger, being received into one of the families as a husband, brother, or son, is treated with the utmost tenderness. Those who perhaps immediately before exhausted their ingenuity in tormenting him, now nurse the wounds they have made, and load him with caresses. Be his complexion pale or red, To fill void places of the dead! XXIII. âThough colored by the foam-flecked wave, Od-deen-yo is my brother brave: Regard from Can-ne-hoot he won Who called him his adopted son; Proud eagle-feathers form his crest, And gleams the turtle on his breast, Tokens by which our laws alone The grade of chieftainship make known. Therefore to him the right belongs To free you captive from his thongs, And wash the death-paint from his cheekâ Ye, who that right dare question, speak!â XXIV. On-yit-ha's tone was stern and highâ He paused in vain to hear reply; By vengeful thought no longer fired, The dark encircling throng retired; Vanished all outward sign of strife, Replaced in leathern sheath was knife; Aside the knotty war-club flung, Keen hatchet lowered, and bow unstrung. XXV. Meanwhile, by friendly arm upborne, His vesture blackened, scorched and torn, From swoon the rescued Baron woke; A moment on De Grai he gazed, Repulsively his arm then raised, And fiercely thus outbroke:â âHence! fell betrayer of my child, Oh, once the pure and undefiled! Hence! rather than owe life to thee, Thou monster of iniquity In fair exterior disguised! Tortures more dreadful I would bear Than fiend, in region of despair, For Woe hath yet devised:â And added, while he back recoiled As if his person had been soiled By some contagious thing and foulâ âOn thee may black misfortune scowl! A father's curse be on thy head To blastââere further word he said, Smote on his car a piteous cry, Rustled the leaf-clad thicket nigh, And wildly toward the stern old man, With outstretched arms, a lady ran, And, falling at his feet, thus sued In penitential attitude:â XXVI. âFather! thine erring Blanche forgive, Oh, breathe the word that bids her live! Her heart, wild home of sin and fear, Would break, thy malison to hear: From thee she hath been absent long, And thou hast suffered grievous wrong; Ill was repaid thy watchful love;â Forgetful of a God above, She left thee, lured by lover's call, Gray-haired, and lonely in thy hall: That God hath visited with pain Her throbbing pulse, and fevered brain; A babe from her embraces torn, Whose lonely grave, in woods unshorn, Is black with shade both night and morn. How changed the face, to thee upcast, Since looked on by a father last! The rose that gave it bloom hath fled, The joy that made it bright is dead.â XXVII. Awhile, in breast of haughty sire, Love waged tumultuous war with ire: The former triumphedâand he raised From earth the supplicant, and gazed Intently on her bloodless face; Then while the tears fell fast and warm, Strained to his heart her drooping form In passionate embrace. Though dawned and fled had many a day, And thinner grown his locks of gray, Since Blanche his castle-hold forsook Without one parting word or look, By him forgotten in that hour Was her neglected lute and bower, Filial ingratitude, the chief Ingredient in his cup of grief; His lonely home, unlighted hearth, And hopes, frail blossoms, crushed to earth. XXVIII. The being circled by his arms, Though dimmed by agony were charms Once lauded by the courtly throngâ That bard had made his theme of song, Was lovely still:âand one recalled By frozen bonds of death enthralled; For in the blue of her soft eye Gleamed the rich light of days gone by, And seemed her glossy, chestnut hair, The same her mother used to wear When the proud nobles of the land Were rival-suitors for her hand. XXIX. âCling closely to this bosom old, Fair image of the lost and dear! I cannot deem thy mother cold, And in her shroud, while thou art near. My prayer the Holy One hath heard, And hither hath the wanderer sped As speedeth to her nest the bird When day-light leaves the mountain-head. Although a blighted name is thine, And stained the honor of my line, By day and night, on land and sea, My dreams and thoughts have been of thee. XXX. âOh! I have borne what few can bear, And in my heart the bitter springs Of grief been opened, while despair Swept with rude hand the quivering strings; But on my wretchedness a ray Of comfort hath been shed to-day, For I have looked upon my child, Poor, houseless wanderer of the wild, And heard her thrilling voice outpour Its clear, melodious tone once more! And can it be that flower so fair Hath breathed contaminated airâ That worms within its heart lie coiled, And every fragrant leaf unsoiled? That never will the minstrel-strain, Cheer my ancestral home againâ That soon its hospitable hearth Will colder be than burial-earth, While creatures haunt the ruin gray Fostered by silence and decay? The Demon lies, my daughter dear! Who whispers ever in mine ear That paramour of wretch thou art All red of hand and black of heart! The treach'rous murderer who gave To Mordaunt an untimely grave!â XXXI. âBy whomââa feeble voice exclaimedâ âAm I, poor dying sinner, named?â The Baron turned abruptly round, His eye directed by the sound, And underneath an aged tree, While summer-winds shook fitfully The leaves upon its hoary bough, De Lisle, the Jesuit, descried Through grim disguise of paint that dyed Contorted face, and troubled brow. XXXII. On bed of shaggy fells he lay, And, bending o'er him, Wun-nut-hay A gourd-shell to his lips applied, Filled from the streamlet's lapsing tide. In haste a deep, reviving draught, To cool his burning thirst, he quaffed; Then, while his glance new lustre caught, Impatiently Le Troye besought By word and gesture to draw near; As if the wretch, ere tongue grew cold, At length dark secret would unfold Cherished for many a year. XXXIII. Approaching, as the priest desired, The Baron of his state inquired; Gazed, with commiserating glance, Upon his changing countenance, While, wet by drops from wound undressed, Red grew the robe that wrapped his breast. âA few more pangs will rend this form, And closed will be a day of stormâ A few more groans these lips escape, And life's frail golden chalice break. XXXIV. âWhen torn by lead, or biting steel, The lacerated flesh may heal; But drug and rare balsamic weed Were never known to work a cure In bosoms guilty and impure, With ulcers filled that inly bleed. The fatal bullet of De Grai, Lodged in my trunk, gives little pain Compared with fires that night and day Feed slowly on my shattered brain. If I could weep repentant tears, Methinks my pulse would calmer grow, And taunting demon, in mine ears, Would cease the trump of doom to blow: But sooner would joy's roseate hue Flush the cold features of a corse, Than one reviving drop bedew These withered cheeksâand, aye, remorse Wakes memory of evil deeds, Waving the black flag of despair And, kissing cross and counting beads, I murmur forth unanswered prayer. XXXV. âAccusing conscience in my heart Plunged deeply an envenomed dart, When, breathing woe in every word, Thy voice, addressing Blanche, I heard: And, while around me dimly thronged The phantoms of the buried past, I prayed that those whom I had wronged Forgiving glance on me would cast Before my tortured soul took flight; And listen, while the word was spoken, Fraught with a power to reunite The ties of love by slander broken.â XXXVI. âNo brother of the craft am I, Who shrive the guilty ere they die: In penance-cell I never stood, And warrior's helm, not monkish hood, Comports with my profession best. But why disquieted in mind? A holy man should be resigned When passing to the Land of Rest: Where the tree falleth, let it lie! Nor doth it matter, when we die, What hands the turf above us heap: And, Priest! as calm will be thy sleep Beneath the sunless forest-mould, As in dark crypt of convent old. XXXVII. âWhy should remembrance overpower Thy spirit in its parting hour? What secret dread can breast of thine Within its hidden depths enshrine? Thy name, De Lisle, both far and near, Is to thy wandering Order dear; For banner of the Cross by thee Displayed hath been on land and sea, And rugged ways thy feet have trod, Ambassador to man from God.â XXXVIII. The dying Jesuit replied In accent unto scorn allied:â âBeneath a friar's dusky stole May lurk a stern, revengeful soul; And any hypocrite may make Prayers, long and loud, at holy shrine, Or, with meek, solemn look, partake Of consecrated bread and wine. Although my garb is coarse and plain, And faded by the wind and rain, A gallant livery I wore When, inmate of thy castle-hall, I gayly paced its marble floor, And gazed upon its pictured wall. XXXIX. âStart not!âI am no phantom dread, Though long have I been mourned as dead! Not know me, Baron?âwho from dust The banner of thy fathers raised, Reckless of pike and sabre-thrust, And battle-fires that round him blazed?ââ âIf told, De Lisle, by thee aright, That gallant boy, so wise and brave Beyond his years,âârejoined the Knightâ âIs lying in a bloody grave: When Blanche with her betrayer fled, A swift, pursuing band he led, But came not back:ââ âFoul lie,â exclaimed The dying JesuitââI framed. Mordaunt yet lives, but feebly thrill His pulses that will soon be still, And mist will cloud his eye ere day Dies in the arms of evening gray. XL. âThe peasant who, in thickest fight, Snatched from the dust thy banner bright, And, dashing blood-drops from his face, Shouted the war-cry of thy raceâ The wretch, from straw-thatched hovel raised To place in dome where grandeur blazed, Who dared to sue, in height of pride, A high-born maid to be his bride; And, crossed in love, who darkly coined A tale that three fond hearts disjoined, And drove from France, far, far away, Thy slandered daughter and De Grai, Before thee lies!ââThe Baron took A backward step, with startled look, As if he deemed, all pale and gaunt, The grave had yielded up Mordaunt! XLI. Resumed the dying man:ââBehold This fine-wrought chain of yellow gold!â The glittering thing thy daughter gave, As guerdon meet to deck the brave, When rode she forth, on palfrey fleet, A weary, war-worn sire to greet, Returning from that field where brand Flashed for the first time in my hand. Oh, fatal gift to me it proved!â The donor from that hour was loved Till came the well remembered morn When hope was crushed by cruel scorn, And, blasted by her look of pride, Within me better feelings died. XLII. âMy soul the lair of hate became, And when De Grai thy daughter won, I breathed detraction on his name, And the black web of falsehood spun. Old man!âwith him be reconciledâ Chaste was his passion for thy child!â XLIII. Gloom, on the visage of Le Troye, Was lighted up with sudden joy To hear, from guilt's half-palsied tongue, Truths, by remorse the prompter wrung, That chased, from fame of young De Grai, Clouds of imputed crime away, And made his heart with rapture thrill To know that Blanche was stainless still. Awhile, fixed posture he maintained, And deep emotion speech restrained; Then called he, with impassioned air, Upon the fond and faithful pair. As happy father hails a son Returning from a distant land, And breathes a hurried benison, While hand is interlocked in hand, So greeting the young Chevalier, Whose arm upheld his daughter dear, Bright drops the gray-haired warrior shed, That had in bliss their fountain-head. XLIV. âHeir of that gallant friendââhe criedâ âWho, shielding me in battle, died! Pure in my sight again thou art, And doubly precious to a heart Too long by tales estranged from thee That linked thy name with infamy. While quaffing death's embittered cup, Yon penitent his crime confessed, And, with a groan, surrendered up Long cherished secrets of his breast: The cord that knit our soul in twain, Was riven by his plotting brain, And charges by dark hint conveyed, Between us wide disruption made; But sorrow's beating storm is o'erâ Affection's band will break no more. Though he this grievous wrong hath done, Oh, be not wroth with him, my son! A pardoned foeman let him die, For gleams contrition in his eye; And, withered and untimely old, The lost Mordaunt in him behold.â XLV. All turned their gaze upon the Priestâ His pulse to throb that instant ceased; No groan, appalling to the ear, Betokened that he died in fear; Or struggle, terrible to sight, Marked the mysterious spirit's flight; But faintly trembled, with a chill, His wasted formâthen all was still. Gone from his cheek was fever's glow, And crucifix his right hand pressed To lips through which, in languid flow, Oozed blood bedabbling chin and breast: That dull gray shade his face o'erspread Which dims the features of the deadâ Imparting to the stony mien Look that is ne'er forgot, once seen. His hair was touched with winter's rime, Sad work of passion wild, not time; And thought, anticipating age, Though brief his mortal pilgrimage, His brow had furrowed o'er, and drawn Deep lines upon his visage wan. XLVI. Thus, from its tenement of clay, Passed soul of God-like gifts away, Whose ill-directed aim and powers Robbed life of sunshine, calm and flowers Thus, ere the noon of manhood, died, Blind slave of impulse, scorn and pride! A being of no common mould; He wandered from the way of right, And sought polluted fires to light Torch of ambition uncontroll'd. XLVII. He might have gained the lore of sageâ Lived a proud land-mark of his age, And name, on glory's record high, Transmitted to posterity; But the dread Tempter he obeyed, And shipwreck of his honor made. Peace to his ashes!âlong ago His corse was laid the sod below, And forms an undistinguished part Of cold earth now his fiery heart. Wild red men trenched for him a grave Kissed by the Genesee's dark wave; But misty centuries have fled Since hollowed was that narrow bed, And hidden is the spot forever By shifting channel of the river. XLVIII. TO THE READER. Young leaves the brow of summer crowned When sire unsullied daughter found, And blessing on De Grai, restored To place in his regard, outpoured: But faded drapery from the trees Was shaken down by autumn-breeze, When peal of bell and minstrel-strain, And banner waving from the wall, Told that the Baron trod again The floor of his ancestral hall. XLIX. Through chambers, damp and long unused, Bright fires once more a warmth diffused; The butler broached, with merry jest, Old cask that held the cellar's best, And vanished, from the banquet-room, Spirits of loneliness and gloom. From kennel darting with a bound, A welcome whined the aged hound; And tenants of the broad estate Thronged gayly to the castle-gate, And waved with shout their hats on high, Greeting their lord right heartily! With cries of joy, domestics old Flocked their young mistress to behold; Her sorrows fled,âher wanderings o'er,â Beneath the roof of home once more, While towered a form of manly pride, Her faithful lover, by her side. L. Though blest the happy pair with all That rank and riches could bestow, In converse used they to recall Long hours of exile and of woe: And both in thought did often stray Over the blue dividing main, And tread, with fawn-eyed Wun-nut-hay, The Genesee's green shore again; Or wigwam, in his valley bright, Depicture to the mental sight Where dwelt, their hearts with joy elate, On-yit-ha and his dusky mate; The former proud of bright fusee, Gift of Od-deen-yo o'er the sea, With stock whereon, in bold relief, Carved was the totem of the chief: The latter decked with jewels rare, Prized parting gifts of sister fair, And chain, that once the Jesuit wore, Wrought from the purest golden ore. END OF CANTO SEVENTH. LEGENDS OF THE SENECAS. TO RUFUS WILMOT GRISWOLD, THESE âLEGENDS OF THE SENECASâ Are Inscribed BY HIS FRIEND AND ADMIRER THE AUTHOR. GENUNDEWAH. (A LEGEND OF CANANDAIGUA LAKE.) âFor contemplation he and valor formed; For softness she, and sweet attractive grace.ââ Milton. âWhy, chieftain, linger on this barren hill That overbrows yon azure sheet below? Red sunset glimmers on the leaping rill, Dark night is near, and we have far to go!â âThis sceneââreplied he, leaning on his bowâ âIs hallowed by tradition: In Indian mythology may be found the richest poetic materials. An American author is unworthy of the land that gave him birth, if he passes by with indifference, this well-spring of inspiration, sending liberally forth a thousand enchanted streams. It has given spiritual inhabitants to our valleys, rivers, hills, and inland seas. It has peopled the dim and awful depths of our forests with gliding spectres; and, by the power of association, given our scenery a charm that will make it attractive forever. The material eye is gratified by a passing glimpse of nature's external featuresâbut a beauty, unknown, unseen before, invests them if linked to stories of the past; in the creation of which, fabling fancy has been a diligent co-worker with memory. The red man was a being who delighted in the mystical and the wild. It was a part of his woodland inheritance. Good and evil genii performed for him their allotted tasks. Joyous tidings, freedom from disease and disaster; success in the chase, and on the war-path, were traceable to the Master of Life (Ou-wee-ne-you), and his subordinate ministers. Blight that fell upon the corn, was attributed, on the contrary, to demoniac agency; and the shaft that missed its mark, was turned aside by the invisible hand of some mischievous sprite. Deities presided over the elements. The Chippewas had their little wild men of the woods, that remind one of Puck, Puck and his frolicsome brotherhood; and like our first parents, the dark-haired sons of the wilderness. ââfrom the steep Of echoing hill or thicket, often heard Celestial voices.â In a work treating of the legendary lore of the Senecas, the story of their origin deserves a prominent place. Many versions of it are afloat agreeing in material points, but differing in the details. I have adopted, as the ground-work of my poem, the narrative of Captain Jones, late Indian interpreter, and a man who towered in intellectual stature above common men, as the pines (to use an Indian metaphor,) rise above the smaller trees of the forest. The Great Hill, at the head of Canandaigua Lake, whence they sprung, is called Ge-nun-de-wah. Tradition says, that it was crowned by a fort, to which the braves of the tribe retreated, at night-fall, after waging war with giants (Jo-gah-uh). It was formerly a chosen seat of Iroquois councilâand wrinkled seers were in the habit of climbing its sides for the purpose of offering up prayers to the Great Spirit. It was made a place of worship in consequence of the destruction of a great serpent in ancient times in a most miraculous mannerâan insatiate monster that devoured the inhabitants of the fort alluded to, as they passed, half-famished out of the gate, at which point the head and tail of the monster, after encircling the fortification, met. All perished save a youthful pair, who were saved by the interposition of the Great Spirit, as described in the poem.âwondrous birth Here to my tribe was given long ago; We stand where rose they from disparting earth To light a deathless blaze on Fame's unmouldering hearth. A fort they reared upon this summit bleak, Guided by counsel from the spirit land; And, clad in dart-proof panoply, would seek The plains beneath each mornâa valiant band! And warfare wage with giants, hand to hand: They conquered in the struggle, and the bones Of their dead foemen on the echoing strand Of the blue lake lay blent with wave-washed stones, And pale, unbodied ghosts filled air with hollow moans. Ut-co, the scowling king of evil, Though this spirit, Mr. Parker, the Indian interpreter informs me, is subordinate to a greater power of mischief, I have adhered to the literal narrative, by his introduction. heard The voice of lamentation, and wild ire The depths of his remorseless bosom stirr'd; Of that gigantic brood he was the sire, And flying from his cavern, arched with fire, He hovered o'er these waters:âat his call Uprushed a hideous monster, spire on spireâ Call so astounding, that the rocky wall Of this bold mountain-range, seemed tottering to its fall. With his infernal parent for a guide The hungry serpent left his watery lair, Dragging his scaly terrors up the side Of this tall hill, now desolate and bare: Filled with alarm the Senecas espied His dread approach, and launched a whizzing shower Of arrows on the foe, whose iron hide Repelled their flinty points, and in that hour The boldest warrior fled from strife with fiendish power. The loathsome messenger of woe and death, True to his dark and awful mission, wound, Polluting air with his envenomed breath Huge folds the palisaded camp around: Crouched at his master's feet the faithful hound, And raised a piteous and despairing cryâ No outlet of escape the mother found For her imploring infants, and on high Lifted her trembling hands in voiceless agony. Forming a hideous circle at the gate The reptile's head and tail together lay; Distended were the fang-set jaws in wait For victims, thus beleaguered, night and day; And not unlike the red and angry ray Shot by the bearded comet was the light Of his unslumbering eye that watched for prey; His burnished mail flashed back the sunshine bright, And round him pale the woods grew with untimely blight. When famine raged within their guarded hold, And wan distemper thinn'd their numbers fast, Crowding the narrow gateway, young and old With the fixed look of desperation passed From life to dreadful death;âa charnel vast, The creature's yawning throat, entombed the strong, And lovely of the tribe:âremained at last Two lovers only of that mighty throng To chaunt with feeble voice a nation's funeral song. Comely to look on was the youthful pair:â One, like the mountain pine, erect and tall, Was of imposing presence;âhis dark hair Had caught its hue from night's descending pallâ Light was his treadâhis port majesticalâ And well his kingly brow became a form Of matchless beauty:âlike the rise and fall Of a strong billow in the hour of storm Beat his undaunted heart with glory's impulse warm. Graced was his belt by beads of dazzling sheen, And painted quillsâthe handiwork of one Dearer than life to him; though he had seen From the gray hills, beneath a wasting sun, Only the snows of twenty winters run, The warrior's right his scalp lock to adorn With eagle plumes in battle he had won: O'erjoyed were prophets old when he was born, And hailed him with one voice âFirst Sunbeam of the Morn.â The other!âwhat of her? bright shapes beyond This darkened earth wear looks like those she wore; Graceful her mien as lily of the pond That nods to every wind which passes o'er Its fragrant head a welcome:ânever more By loveliness so rare will earth be blest; Softer than ripple breaking on the shore By moonlight, was her voice, and in her breast Pure thought a dwelling foundâthe bird of love a nest. Round her would hop unscared the sinless bird, And court the lustre of her gentle glance, Hushing each âwood-note wildâ whene'er it heard Her song of joy:âher countenance Inspired beholder with a thought that chance Had borne her hither from some better land:â To deck her tresses for the festive dance Girls of the tribe would bring, with liberal hand, Blossoms and rose-lipped shells from bower and reedy strand. A thing of beauty is the slender vine That wreaths its verdant arm around the oak, As if it there could safely intertwine Shielded from ringing axeâthe lightning strokeâ And, like that vine, the girl, of whom I spoke, Clung to her brave companion:âscalding tears Rained from her elk like eyes, and sobs outbroke From her o'er-labored bosom, while her ears Were filled with soothing tones that did not hush her fears. âMourner! the hour of rescue is at hand! This hill will tremble to its rocky base When Ou-wee-ne-yon utters stern command: Joy, ere another fleeting moon, the trace Of clouding sorrow from thy brow will chase:â Fear not! for I am left to guard thee yet, Last of the daughters of a luckless race! We must not, in the time of grief, forget That light breaks forth anew from orbs that darkly set.â Thus, day by day, would Oh-wen-do-skah strive To cheer the drooping spirits of the maid, And keep one glimmering spark of hope alive. In the deep midnight, for celestial aid, While cowered the trembler at his knee, he prayed In tones that might have touched a heart of rock: One morn exclaimed heââbe no more afraid! Bright, peerless scion of a broken stock! For heaven the monster's coil is arming to unlock. âReserved for some high destiny, despite The downfall of our people, we live onâ My dreams were of deliverance last night, And peril of impending death withdrawn: A light, my weeping one, begins to dawn On the thick gloom by sorrow round us cast The lead-like pressure of despair is gone, And rides a viewless courier on the blast, Who whispersââLo! the hour of vengeance comes at last.â âGorged with his meal of blood, unstirring sleeps In his tremendous ring our mortal foe; Film-veiled, his savage eye no longer keeps Grim watch for victims:âwarily and slow Follow thy lover, armed with bended bow Of timber shaped in many a battle tried:â Some guardian spirit will before me throw A shield, by human vision undescried, Should he awake in wrath, and hence our footsteps guide.â It was, I ween, a sight to freeze each vein That courses through our perishable clay, When sallied forth, with muffled tread, the twain; A look of wild, unutterable dismay Convulsed Te-yos-yu's visage, while the way, A spear-length in advance, her lover led. Reaching the portal, paused he to survey The dangerous pass, through which a grisly head, Deprest to earth, he sawâits mouth with carnage red! âOn! on!ââhe whisperedââand the sightless mole Our foot-fall must not hear, or we are lost!â Nerved to high purpose was his warlike soul, As the dark threshold of the gate he crossed; But fear that instant âchilled his limbs with frost;â For high its swollen neck the monster raised, Gore dripping from its jaws with foam emboss'd, And, rimmed with fire, each circling eye-ball blazed, As light, unwounding dart its horny armor grazed. Sick by a foul and fetid odor made, Recoiled the champion from unequal fray; Cut off all hope of rescue, he surveyed Fiercely the danger, like a stag at bay! Where was Te-yos-yu?âshe had swooned away! And hoof-crushed wild flower of the forest brown Resembled her, as soiled with dust she lay: Long on the seeming corse the Chief looked down, For 'twas a sight the cup of his despair to crown. Kneeling at length, upheld he with strong arm Her beauteous head, but in the temples beat No pulse of life:âtears gushing fast and warm Refresh a heart, of transient ill the seat, As rain-drops cool the summer's mid-day heat; But when descends some desolating blow That makes this world a desert, how unmeet Is outward symbol!âand far, far below The water-mark of grief was Oh-wen-do-skah's woe. In broken tones he murmured:ââMust the name Of a great people be revived no more, And like an echo pass away their fame, Or moccasin's faint impress on the shore Of the Salt Lake when billows foam and roar? Black night enwraps my soul; for she is dead Who was its lightâdesire to live is o'er!â Scarce were these words in mournful accent said, When peals of thunder shook low vale and mountain-head. Upsprang the Chief;âand on a throne of cloud, Robed in a snowy mantle fringed with light, The Lord of Life beheld:âthe forest bowed Its top in awe before that Presence Bright, And a wild shudder, at the dazzling sight, Ran through the mighty monster's knotted ring, Shaking the hill from base to rocky height;â Rose from her trance the maid, with fawn-like spring, And balanced, in mid air, the bird on trembling wing. âNotch on the twisted sinew of thy bow This fatal weapon,ââOu-wee-ne-you cried, Dropping a golden shaftââand pierce the foe Under the rounded scales that wall his side!â Then vanished, while again the valley wide, And mountain, quaked with thunder:âfrom the ground The warrior raised the gift of Heaven, and hied On his heroic mission, while around The hill with closer clasp his train the serpent wound. Flame-hued and hissing played its nimble tongue Between thick, ghastly rows of pointed bone, Round which commingled gore and venom clung: Raging, its flattened head like copper shone, And flinty earth returned a heavy groan, Lashed by quick strokes of its resounding tail. Heard is like uproar, when the hill's bleak cone Is wildly beat by Winter's icy flail;â But in that moment dire the archer did not quail. Firm in one hand his trusty bow he held, And with the other to its glittering head Drew the long shaft, while full each muscle swelled; A twanging sound!âand on its errand sped The messenger of vengeance:âwarm and red Gushed from a gaping wound the vital tideâ Wrenched was the granite from its ancient bed, And pines were broken, in their leafy pride, As throes of mortal pain the monster's coil untied. Down the steep hill, outstretched and dead, he rolled, Disgorging human heads in his descent; Oaks, that in earth had deeply fixed their hold, Like reeds by that revolving mass were bent, Splintered their boughs, as if by thunder rent: High flung the troubled Lake its feathery spray, And far the beach with spots of foam besprent, When the huge carcass disappeared for aye In depths from whence it rose to curse the beams of day. When winds its murmuring bosom cease to wake, Through bright, transparent waves you may discern, On the hard, pebbled bottom of the Lake, Skulls changed to stone: Stones in the shape of Indians' heads may be seen lying in the lake in great plenty, which are said to be the same that were deposited there at the death of the serpent.â Life of Mary Jefferson.âwhen fires no longer burn Kindled by sunset, and the glistening urn Of night o'erflows with dew, the phantoms pale Of matron, maid, child, seer and chieftain stern, Their ghastly faces to the moon unveil, And raise upon the shore a low, heart-broken wail. The Lovers of Genundewah were blest By the Great Spirit, and their lodge became The nursery of a nation:âwhen the West Opened its gates of parti-colored flame To give their souls free passage, loud acclaim Rang through the Spirit-Land, and voices cried âWelcome! ye builders of eternal fame! Ye royal founders of an empire wide, The stream of joy rolls by, quaff ever from its tide!â At Onondaga burned the sacred fire A thousand winters, with unwasting blaze; In guarding it son emulated sire, And far abroad were flung its dazzling rays: Followed were happy years by evil days; Blue-eyed and pale came children of the dawn, Tall spires on site of bark-built town to raise; Change groves of beauty to a naked lawn, And whirl their chariot-wheels where led the doe her fawn. Where are the Mighty?âmorning finds them not! I callâand echo gives response alone; The fiery bolt of ruin hath been shotâ The blow is struckâthe winds of death have blownâ Cold are their hearthsâtheir altars overthrown! For them, with smoking venison the board, Reward of toilsome chase, no more will groan: Sharper than hatchet proved the conqueror's sword, And blood, in fruitless strife, like water they outpoured. The spotted demon of contagion came Ere the scared bird of peace could find a nest, And vanished tribes like summer grass when flame Reddens the level prairies of the west; Or wasting dew-drops when the rocky crest Of this enchanted hill is tipped with gold; And ere the Genii of the wild-wood drest With flowers and moss the grave mound's hallowed mould, Before the ringing axe, went down the forest old. Oh! where is Garangulaâsachem wise!â Who was the father of his people! where King Hendrick, Cay-en-guae-to? who replies? And, Skenandoah, was thy silver hair Brought to the dust in sorrow and despair By pale oppressors, though thy bow was strung To guard their Thirteen Fires? they did not spare E'en thee, old chieftain!âAnd thy tuneful tongue The death-dirge of thy race, in measured cadence, sung. The-an-de-nea-ga of the martial brow, Gy-ant-wa, Hon-ne-ya-wus, where are they? Sa-goy-ye-wat-hah! is he silent now, Will listening throngs no more his voice obey? Like visions have the mighty passed away: Their tears descend in raindrops, and their sighs Are heard in wailing winds when evening gray Shadows the landscape, and their mournful eyes Gleam in the misty light of moon-illumined skies. Gone are my tribesmen, and another race, Born of the foam, disclose, with plough and spade, Secrets of battle-field, and burial-place; And hunting grounds, once dark with pleasant shade Bask in the golden light:âbut I have made A pilgrimage, from far, to look once more On scenes through which in childhood's hour I strayed; After the lapse of years, when driven to a far country by the rapacity of the whites, the red man visits the scenes of his boyhood. âI am alone,â said an Indian woman, at the burial-place of her fathers; âI have travelled far towards the rising sun. My moccasins are worn out, my heart is heavy. I look for the graves of the dead; their white bones are scattered around. The old woods are goneâthe homes of the pale-face are here. The mist rolls away on the windâthus vanished my people.â Though robbed of might my limbsâmy locks all hoar, And on this holy mount mourn for the days of yore. Our house is broken open at both ends Though deep were set the posts, its timber strong; From ruthless foes, and traitors masked as friends, Tutored to sing a false, but pleasant song, The Seneca and Mohawk guarded long Its blood-stained doors:âthe former faced the sun In his decline:âthe latter watched a throng Clouding the eastern hillsâtheir tasks are done! A game for life was played, and prize the white-man won. Around me soon will bloom unfading flowers, Ye glorious Spirit Islands of the Just! No fatal axe will hew away your bowers, Or lay the green-robed forest king in dust:â Far from the spoiler's fury, and his lust Of boundless power will I my fathers meet Tiaras wearing never dimmed by rust; And they while airs waft music, passing sweet, To blest abodes will guide my silver-sandaled feet. THE PLACE OF BONES. âYe mouldering relics of departed years, Your names have perished.ââ Flint. Delightful Avon overlooks the place Where, mingled rudely with the upturned soil, The bones of some forgotten nation lie, In mournful disregard. The solemn groves Inweave no more their tossing boughs above These violated sepulchres: the hand Of busy industry long since cut down The dark, old sylvan giants, and let in The golden sunshine. When the Genesee Is swollen roughly by the vernal rain, Or equinoctial storm, his surging tide Invades the level mead, and even lifts Above this populated home of death The voice of wild rebellionâsound, alas! That ill befits the dwellings of the dead. The crowded public thoroughfare, that leads To the young city of our inland seas Through the bright Eden of the âEmpire State,â Bounds on the south this melancholy spot. Trees of a second growth in beauty stand, And greet the northwardly directed gaze With smooth and glossy trunks, and roots that draw Refreshment from the dust of woodland sires: And eastwardly the sloping upland makes Exposure of its side to westering suns, While peer above its ridgy top the spires, And painted habitations of vain manâ Ay, selfish too!âfor piously around The dreamless couches of his own pale race, To shut out brute intrusion, he has built A strong, protecting wall, and planted round The funeral hillock flowers that breathe of love, And willows frail, that rub their yellow boughs Against the pompous, monumental stone; While spurningly his desecrating foot Falls on the bleaching remnants of the pastâ Of haughty Indian king, or swarthy maid, At whose rude sepulchres, long, long ago, The children of interminable groves Were mourning visitants. The tribe that laid Beneath the turf their chieftain, unlike us Who sorrow only for a season, came, And tearful homage paid to dust of kin, When the loud warring elements and time Had worn away all sign of burial. That deathless Bard, Campbell. whose name is linked to Hope, And whose rich instrument has many strings, Was faulty in his music when he sang Of the red sagamore âwithout a tear.â The wilderness, with all its wealth of shade, Sepulchral dells, and wingÃ¨d choristers; The mossy floor of solitary glades Whereon his moccasin faint impress left; The wooded mountain, where the howling wolf And screaming panther made their dreaded lairs; The voice of streams, and melody of winds, Woke in his heart poetic sympathy, And spoke in tones majestically grand Of one unclouded source of life and light. The features of his character were rude, And wrong could rouse him to demoniac rage, Or kindness lull him to a summer calm. When war, or mortal malady, cut down His wife or offspring to the shaded earth He gave, with tears, the bark-infolded corse, And guarded well the consecrated spot From the gaunt beast of prey; then laid choice food, And the dry gourd, his vegetable cup, Brimming with water from the crystal spring, Upon the hiding mould, through fear the dead Might faint in passing to the spirit land. In the blue smoke of settlements, the lord Of the lithe bow and slender arrow saw The cloud that would obscure his race and name; And in the fall of oaks before the axe, Heard the sharp knell of his own glory rung. Then deeds of fell atrocity ensued In his vain efforts to resist the tide Of stern improvement, whose huge surges swept All traces of his pomp and power away. His patriot zeal and disregard of self, Resemblance to that spurning hate of bonds That roused a Sydney and a Hampden bore, And should have won the plaudits of his foe. In happy childhood it was oft my wont, Freed from the birchen terrors of the school, Yon place of Indian burial to seek, And watch the disinterring plough, and scan The fertilized and newly-parted clod For beads of beauty rare, tooth-worn by time, And crumbling fragments of the dagger haft, Constructed by some artisan of eld From the broad antlers of the whistling moose, And branching honors of the stag or elk; Or raise, with reverential hand, the skull Of unremembered royalty, perchance, With thought akin to wonderment and awe; Then, throwing down the wreck, spy out amid The dark, embracing furrows arrow-heads, And broken implements of grotesque form, Used by the painted warrior in the chase, Or on the path that led him to his foe. Some, who delight in hoar antiquity, The nation deem that sleep in yonder field The primal stock whose shoots in after years Not improbableâfor the Senecas who formerly inhabited the valley of the Genesee, were styled in Iroquois councils, âOur Elder Brothers.â Uniting in a league of brotherhood, The dreaded name of Iroquois made known From the dark hemlock groves of hilly Maine To the proud father of our mighty lakes. But this is idle speculation all, And red men, hanging on our frontier skirts, No light can throw upon their history. A few, stray pebbles only, hand of bard Hath gathered on Tradition's shadowy beach Washed darkly ever by erasing waves. One by the Indian loved, and who can well Warble his dialect in silvery tones, Told me that mighty conquerors reposed, Their names forgotten, in yon olden plain. Long with the Canisteo tribe they warred, And south, eight leagues away, may yet be seen Memorials of conflict, and a tomb That once was honored with heroic bones. When the first settler came, it bore the shape Of a man lying with extended arms. Long before the Revolution, according to tradition, a battle took place on a hill, a few miles distant, between the Canisteo Indians and those living in the vicinity, during which a chief of the latter was killed. When the whites first settled here, the spot where he fell was marked by a large hole dug in the shape of a man, with arms extended. An Indian trail led by the place, and the Indians, on passing, were always accustomed to clear away the leaves and brush which had blown in. The chief was buried in an old Indian burying-ground which stood on the present site of the Lutheran Church, and was thickly covered with graves to the extent of two or three acres. His monument consisted of a large pile of small stones, gathered from time to time by the nations from a hill a mile distant, who, in passing, were accustomed to take one in the hand, and add to the heap. His bones were afterwards disinterred by the settlers, and judging from them, and the length of the hole on the hill, he must have been seven feet, or more, in height.âSee Historical Collections of New York. A trail wound near the place, and passing by, The feathered hunter from his route diverged To clear away the brush, and wind-blown leaves From off its hallowed mould, and cast a stone On a gray pile that rose pyramidal To tell the story of a champion's fall To other times. Alas! the tribes no more Pay annual visit to their Place of Graves. Would that the moon of falling leaves could fling Again a rustling pall of many hues Above the dust of slumberers unknown! For if the spirits of the lost and deadâ And some believe soâlinger round the streams, And haunts of beauty that they loved in life, Perchance the spectral visitants that flit About these desecrated tombs, might feel Ecstatic joy in viewing olden scenes Dark with the presence of tall groves again. THE GLEN OF GHOSTS. âWhere hath not woman stood Strong in affection's might.â Near the roadside yawns a dismal glen, Where the wolf of yore found a brambly den; The fissured rocks rise, ledge on ledge, And a stream leaps over the precipice-edge That makes, while melting in wreaths of snow, A heavy and churning sound below. A leaning pine, whose rugged cone Is the forest eagle's ancient throneâ Old birchen trees that drink the spray, Encased in bark that is ghostly and gray, And the hemlock's cloak of sombre green Comport with the quiet of the scene. It is a wild, a fearful spot, And the sinless birds they love it not; From its dark abyss unclouded day Drives never the shades of night away, And dungeon low, and cavern'd tomb Have less of deep, mysterious gloom. An old companion in the chase, A belted son of that red-browed race Who ranged, a few, brief years ago, This realm with feathered shaft and bow, Near the âGlen of Ghosts,â with shudder cold, To me the tale that follows told. âEre felled by axe was forest tree On flowery banks of the Genesee, Or plough, by cunning white man made, Tore the green carpet of the glade, Shemokun, bravest of the brave, Law to a mighty people gave. âIn the chill moon of the falling leaf, Declined the health of the mighty chief; His stately form grew thin and weak, Vanished the war-paint from his cheekâ Untrimm'd he wore his scalp-lock gray, And waned the strength of his soul away. âWise elders of the tribe, in vain, Sought moon-lit herbs on hill and plain, To thrill with energy once more The flagging pulse of the sagamore; And idly tried low-mutter'd charm The sluggish blood in his veins to warm. âIt chanced that from a dream one night This legend was written to illustrate an Indian superstition in reference to dreams. They think that the sick are often bewitched by those whose names they mention in their troubled slumbers. âThey believe, also, that some persons have the power of injuring others at a distance of many hundred miles, by charms and spells; this belief in witchcraft is constantly noticed by Tanner and others, who have resided long among them, and it seems to have been especially prevalent among the Oggibeways, and other northern tribes.â The sufferer woke in wild affright, While, by his couch of panther-skin, Kept watch the man of medicine, And, with a loud, entreating tone, Pronounced the name of Wah-non-ti-gÃ³ne. âNext morn, throughout the village spread, From lodge to lodge the tidings dread, That lurking wizard's hellish art Had withered ShemÃ²kun's arm and heart; And crested brave, and tottering sire Convened to light the council-fire. âWhen pipe had passed the ring around, Rose from his mat a sage renowned, And Wah-non-ti-gÃ³ne against him heard The charge of witchcraft foul preferr'd, His bold accusers then defied In the fierce tones of scorn and pride. âThey doomed the warrior to die, Ere sunset flushed the western sky; And, binding each athletic limb, In the Lodge of Judgment prisoned him, Condemned prisoners, while preparations are making for their execution, are confined in a dark hut, called the âlodge of judgment,â by some tribes, and by others, the âcabin of death.â While stake was drest, and brush up-piled Beneath the dim, o'er-arching wild. âWah-non-ti-gÃ³ne had proved his right To the war-bird's plume in many a fight, An Indian takes rank as a warrior when he has slain a foe in battle. A plume of the eagle, or war bird, intertwined with his scalp lock, is an index of the exploit. But woke a haunting wish for life When he thought of his newly-wedded wife, Whose dark eye, with affection bright, His wigwam made a place of light âNot long in musing sad and lone, All pinioned, lay Wah-non-ti-gÃ³ne, When a foot drew near with muffled fall, And cranny wide in his prison wall Revealed the face of his âSummer Flowerâ True to her mate in the perilous hour. âBy sentry at the door unseen Her arm she thrust the logs between, And severed with keen knife the cord That fetter'd the limbs of her forest lordâ An earnest, meaning gesture made, The red man is well skilled in the language of signs. Intelligence of approaching, or apprehended danger, or of the successful, or adverse result of an enterprise, is often given by mute, expressive gestures. Even the character of a nation against whom they march to battle is thus significantly represented:âThe Sioux are designated by passing the hand across the throat as if cutting it. The sign for âall right!â is made by holding the palm downwards in a horizontal position, and waving it slowly outwards. And placed in his hand the trusty blade. âOne boundâone well-directed thrust, And rolled the luckless guard in dust! Then brandishing his weapon red Wah-non-ti-gÃ³ne with Oonah fled, While cries of fierce pursuit arose, And arrows whizzed from a thousand bows. ââThy Summer Flower her light canoe In the Great Bend hath hid from view, And swan-like it will breast the tide,â Outspoke his young, and dauntless bride, âWhile the lifted oars drop silvery rain, And demons howl for our blood in vain.â âUnharmed the fugitives soon reached Its pebbly marge by the billow bleached, And Oonah swiftly led the way To willow'd nook, in a quiet bay, Where she moored her back ere blush of dawnâ âOh fell mischanceââshe shriekedââ'tis gone!â âOne moment brief the luckless pair Felt the drear heart-ache of despair, While louder on the rushing breeze Rose the shrill whoop of enemiesâ Wildly the scene around surveyed, And cover sought in thickest shade. âWhen near the brink of a wooded dell Known to the hunted warrior well, The foot of Oonah flagged in speed, And trembled her frame like a wind swept reedâ âLeave me, Wah-non-ti-gÃ³ne,â she cried, âThe Master of Life will watch over thy bride!â âTo make response the chieftain turned, And foemen nigh at hand discerned; In vain he interposed his form, His bride to shield from the battle-storm: Both fell to earthâtheir faithful hearts Pierced by a volley of feathered darts. âIn the glen a shallow grave was made, And together, there, were the lovers laid; Thenceforth it was a haunted place, And shunn'd by tribes of the forest race, When the fires of day forsook the west, And in darker robe the woods were dressed.â TEWANNA. âAll things that we ordained festival Turn from their office to black funeral: Our instruments to melancholy bells; Our wedding cheer to a sad funeral feast; Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change.â Shakespeare. Oh! changed is this vale since the lovers were laid At the foot of a sycamore tree, Whose pillar-like trunk throws its beautiful shade On the banks of the dark Genesee. One morning, in June, to the spot I was led By the son of a perishing race, And he told me a story allied to the dead That renders more holy the place. âPale boy,â said the falcon-eyed man of the wild, In the tremulous accents of grief, âMany summers have ended since weeping ones piled Yon mould on a maiden and chief. The soul of Tewanna dwells now in that land Where suns in the west never set, But I still see her look of expressiveness bland, Her dark eye is visible yet. âIn the lodge of a sachem the damsel grew up, With a smile like the dawning of light; Her form vied the lily in grace when its cup Is bestudded with gems of the night. The girls of her tribe glen and precipice sought For trophies to lay at her feet; To garland her brow from the wilderness brought Gay blue-bell and violet sweet. âThe power of her charms woke the torturing fire Of passion in many a breast, But the son of a chieftain in league with her sire Her vow of fidelity blest. His shaft pierced the wild deer in pride of its speed, In battle his hatchet was true; His foot was more fleet than the prairie-born steed That rider, or rein never knew. âThe time I remember when marriage guests met, And gave their loud mirth to the air; While Tewanna came forthâher long tresses of jet Interwoven with ornaments rare. Her look I remember of utter dismay When the Seneca prophet thus spake:â âThe heart that is beating so gladly to-day, With grief on the morrow will break! ââIs the bridegroom a laggard?âwhat fetters his limb While tribesmen his coming await? Is he searching out game in the wilderness dim, Or some proud bridal-gift for his mate? The forehead, now wearing the sign of delight, Will darken with sorrow ere long, For the whippowil came to my lodge yesternight, The whippowil is regarded as a bird of ill-omen by the Indians. Its melancholy note in the twilight, near their lodges, would hush joyous conversation, and throw a whole circle into attitudes of alarmed attention. And chanted an ominous song.â âDay faded apace, and the timorous deer Sought a flowery couch in the shade, But the lover came not with his presence to cheer The heart of his beautiful maid. When the last gleam of day from the occident fled, And darkness infolded the cloud, From the lodge of their sachem with whisper of dread, And presentiment dark went the crowd. âNext morn, from the chase an old hunter came back, And reported in faltering words, That deep in the wood he was lured from his track By the screaming of carrion birds; That in a lone glen, where dark hemlock shut out The cheerful effulgence of day, While the hoarse raven flew in swift circles about, The corse of a warrior lay. âWe went forth in haste to the desolate glen, And the loved of Tewanna we foundâ Near the body were foot-prints of ruffian men, And marks of red strife were around. The blended expression of wrath and disdain His visage yet fearfully woreâ The long, slender arrow wherewith he was slain, Was dyed to the feather in gore. âOn litter with moss of the forest bespread Litters used by the Indians in bearing the sick, killed, or wounded, were formed of bark matting, attached firmly to parallel poles, on which they spread a soft coat of moss and leaves. The poles were preserved in a parallel position by cross bars. We mournfully placed the young chief; Then homeward we carried the slumbering dead, Our faces bent downward in grief. A dirge for the fallen we solemnly raised, And were met by the youthful and old, Who circled the death-couch, and fearfully gazed On the sleeper, unbreathing and cold. ââMake room for the maid that in life he loved well!â Said a voice, as Tewanna drew near; She caught but one glimpse of the features, and fell An inanimate corse by the bier. On the following day weeping relatives laid The Warrior-Chief in his gore, By the side of his love in a tomb rudely made At the foot of yon old sycamore.â THE HAUNTED ROCK. I am indebted to George Hosmer, Esq., one of the pioneers of Western New York, for the following statement: âIn the early settlement of the Genesee country, I remember to have seen a round rock standing near the Indian trail leading from Canawaugus to Geneseo, in what is now the town of Avon. It was about forty feet in circumferenceâthe earth, where it lay imbedded, was hard and gravelly; there was a narrow path around it one foot in width, and it was beaten and worn by passing feet to the depth of four or five inches. Tradition informs us that a chief of distinction had been buried under that rock, and that his memory was honored by his tribesmen, when hunting or on war expeditions, by religiously running, with breath suspended, round his rude tomb.â This rock was in the form of a large boulder, and the like of it has never been found in this region. In after years it was removed by ruthless hands, blasted, and manufactured into mill-stones. âOh, cruel sire, More fell than anguish, hunger or the sea! Look on the tragic loading of this bed: This is thy work: the object poisons sight; Let it be hid.ââ Shakespeare. There is a placeâa lonely place, Deep in the forest, green and old, And oaken giants interlace Their boughs above the fruitful mould. Though fled have many weary suns Since rose wild yell, and cry of fearâ Its bower the roving Indian shuns When belted for the chase of deer. Man seldom is intruder there, And lightly near the partridge treads, While, breathing fragrance on the air, Frail wood-plants lift their nodding heads. Linked with the fair, enchanting scene Sad legend of the past he knows, And with a deeply-troubled mien Wild, watchful look around he throws; As if fell murder's purple stain Wind, sun and shower had failed to dim, And the pale phantoms of the slain, Through leaves, were looking forth on him. Gloom to thy fairest nook, oh earth! Dark deed of evil can impartâ An awe that stills the lip of mirth, And sends a coldness to the heart. Wa-noo-sa was a chieftain's child, And sweetest flower of womanhood That ever grew, untaught and wild, Within the green, o'erarching wood. A suitor hated by her sire Had seen, till night's chill gloom was gone, And morning tipped the hills with fire, Love's torch in her bark lodge burn on. In conducting a courtship, the Seneca lover visits the wigwam of the maiden after she has retired to rest, and places a burning torch of bark, previously prepared, on the hearth-stone. If she rises, and extinguishes it, the offer of marriage is rejected; but if it is allowed to burn on, he returns home an accepted suitor. Cheered by this token dear, a plan The daring Tuscarora laid, Regardless of parental ban, To bear away his dark-eyed maid. Thus spake he in a fatal hour To her he loved, in whisper lowâ âWhen dew is on the thirsty flower I will be near with steed and bow. âThe home that waits us far away Is girt by greener woods than these; There hath the moon a softer ray, And clearer notes have bird and breeze.â He won the maid's consent to fly When gone was sunlight's parting smile, But little thought an evil eye On him kept earnest watch the while. When she beheld the day depart, While dim with shade the landscape grew, Wa-noo-sa, with a fluttering heart, Counted the moments as they flew. A distant hoof-tramp on the sward The listener heard at last, and found For vigil sad a rich reward In that long-wished for, welcome sound. Loud, and more loud, that hoof-tramp rung, Then paused a horseman in his race:â The maid behind him lightly sprung, And on he rode at fearful pace. âMy sire, to find his singing bird, In vain will scour the wood and dell When comes the morrow!âânot a word In answer from that horseman fell. Though small of frame his thick-maned steed Up stony hill, through coppice toiled; Nor flagged his wiry limbs in speed When swampy loam each fetlock soiled. The rising moon began to shed A glimmering light on wave and wold When reached a thicket, lone and dread, Deep in the forest green and old. There did his course that horseman stay, And pointing to the forest-floor On which a fallen warrior lay, âDismount!ââexclaimedââyour ride is o'er!â Cry, long and loud, Wa-noo-sa raised, Then fell as if by arrow shotâ One instant her stern father gazed, And galloped wildly from the spot. Two ghastly skeletons, when came The sad moon of the falling leaf A hunter, on the track for game, Found, and his heart was touched with grief. He hollowed for the bones a grave, And earth above them gently piled, Then, for the beautiful and brave, Sang a low dirge, with gesture wild. A mighty tribe, with groans and tears, Rolled a huge rock the mound above To mark where slept, in other years, The victims of unhappy love. Thenceforth it was a haunted place, And deeply worn that rock around, By children of the hunter race In passing, was the solid ground:â Each, walking with suspended breath, Heard spirit voices on the breeze, While shadows from the realm of death Glided among the whispering trees. THE HAUNTED COVE. âFor sure so fair a place was never seen Of all that ever charmed romantic eye.â Keats. âNow is the witching time to roveâ The sun is low in the west, my love! Few shafts are left in his golden quiver; And we must cross, ere we reach the Cove, Yon old red bridge that spans the river.â The youthful twain stroll forth while day Of valley and hill takes blushing leave, And the red-breast chants a pensive lay That tells of the coming hush of eve. They reach the place where rankly waves The springing corn on rifled gravesâ Where the bleaching bones of the forest-lord Pierce through the vegetating sward; They pass the old elm-tree whose bough Is green with a robe of clinging mossâ With flagging pace the bridge they cross, And the place they seek is before them now. âSweet Lillian! let thy rustic seat Be this old walnut's fallen trunk, And shrink not, though beneath your feet The dark, rich soil hath carnage drunk; For here your roving eyes behold The scenery of that legend old Which thou hast teased me oft to tellâ Now list! and heed its import well. âThis bending Cove, and the river near An isle from the level mainland sever, Where the blue-bird first salutes the ear With song when the vernal clouds appear, And a quiet beauty lingers ever. On the low and richly wooded shore Are visible remains of yore; And often, when the shelving clay Is worn by the wash of waves away, Rude implements of other days, And skeletons arrest the gaze. Direct your glance where the river bends, And the bank, with a gentle slope, descends; For there, encircled by the wood, The village of the red-man stood. âYon aged group of maples mark, Flinging shadows long and dark, The island described in this legend is formed by a sweeping bend of the Genesee and the âHaunted Cove,â supposed to have been the ancient bed of the river. It was a favorite sugar orchard of the Indians, and maples of immense size, deeply scarred by the hatchet, are rooted in the rich vegetable mould. The remains of huts, mouldering and moss-covered, may yet be seen in the shadow of the old forest. The island is carpeted with wild flowers in the spring and summer, and bevies of light-hearted boys and girls flock annually thither to pluck and weave them into nosegays. In taking the âback foot of life's trail,â to use an Indian metaphor, I number among the greenest and brightest spots of memoryâmy boyish excursions in quest of blue-bells and wild fruit, to this enchanted place. While round their leaning stems entwine The folding arms of the leafy vine. Long, long ago Conesus made His dwelling in their graceful shade; Above them curls, as in time of yore, The smoke of his cone-like lodge no more, With its rude walls hung with trophies torn From the heads of fallen foes; But his name by a rapid stream is borne, That, in its channel deeply worn, Near Avon foams and flows. âHis tribe could many a chieftain boast, Far-famed for deeds, but loved him most: Not by hereditary right Rank did he win above them all, But forced his way by skill in fight, And wisdom in the council-hall. The Chippewas would turn and fly, When caught their ears his onset cry, And often to their mountain-hold He chased the AdirÃ³ndack bold: Full deeply was his hatchet stained When the vaunting Delaware he brained; The fierce Ottawa's blood, in strife, Had dimm'd the blade of his deadly knife, And his name alone could wildly wake Dread in the Hurons of the Lake; For a whizzing shaft from his fatal bow In dust laid their youthful sachem low; I stand on the spot where he darkly fell, And known is his grave to the Seneca well.â âWhy did the warrior venture nigh The home of his savage enemy? What madness tempted him to stray From his own tribe so far away?â The lady, with a shudder, said: âA band, by old Conesus led, The country of the Hurons sought, When the deep green of summer fled, And back a beauteous captive brought: She was the bride of a noted chief, And his heart was madly wrung with grief When he came with his warriors from the chase, And found his home a ruined placeâ The huts of his people in ashes, and gone The young bride he tenderly doated upon.â âDid the chieftain arm with lance and bow, And follow the relentless foe?â âYes, Lillian! on their path he sped, But few were the quiver'd braves he led: The mazes of the forest dim He threaded with unwearied limb, Nor rested in his swift career, Like a famished wolf on the trail of deer. Steep hill he clomb, and river cross'd In quest of the bride of his bosom lost, And captors at whose girdles hung The reeking scalps of old and young.â âDid the Huron rescue from the power Of ravishers his forest flower?â âNo!âfor the Senecas, when near The village of their tribe, sent out, Fearful of danger in the rear, Their fleetest warrior as a scout, Who soon, with fox-like bound, came back Announcing foemen on their track. Conesus, belted for the fight These tidings heard with grim delight, And for his rash pursuer laid On the bank of this cove an ambuscade. âOn came the Huron!âbut his eye No sign could trace of peril nigh Until a startling whoop arose Succeeded by the twang of bows, And the sudden fall of a warrior tried, With a ringing death-shriek, by his side. The victims of that fatal snare Fought with the fury of despair; Like wolves, athirst for blood, and gaunt, That madly on the hunter spring When round their dark and savage haunt Contracts the deadly ring, This method of hunting formed on a grander scale the favorite amusement of the princes of Tartary, when, as it is beautifully described by Somerville in his âChase,â âOn the banks of Genina, Indian stream, Line within line, rose their pavilions proud.â Previous notice having been given out that the âCircular Huntâ will take place upon an appointed day; in many parts of the western states the hunters for many miles around take their respective stations, and, at a preconcerted signal, commence marching towards each other. The game consisting of wolves, bears, deer, and numerous other smaller animals, encircled within the living wall, huddle closer and closer together, and,â âwith vain assault contend to break The impenetrable line. They are soon dispatched by the approaching assailants, or their comrades placed in the centre of the circle, upon an elevated platform with rifles and other instruments of death. Battled their little band, while grew Fewer their numbers, and more few. They sought not, in that fatal hour, The cover of o'ershadowing trees To ward away the feather'd shower, While groans, and yells were on the breeze; But summoning their might for one Terrific shock, disdained to shun The red encounter, knife to knife, And plied their weapons in the strife With deadly aim, and active bound, While the fierce Senecas gave ground Before their maddening rush for life. âThe chief in his dread career was staid By frantic calls for instant aid; And stood awhile, with trembling limb, For the voice was not unknown to him; Thenâfearful sight! his hapless bride Bound rudely to a tree, descried, In battle or previous to battle, the forest warrior secures his prisoner, if too hard pressed to convey him from the field, by fastening him with strips of tough bark, or thongs of deer skin, to the trunks of trees. This mode of preventing the escape of captives is sometimes adopted, previous to torturing them at the stake; and striplings frequently exercise their skill, and amuse themselves by hurling hatchets at, without hitting or materially wounding them. Even women and maidens enjoy the spectacle, and intensely watch for some expression of fear while the bright, whirling weapon grazes the skin, or severs a lock of hair in its passage. If the pinioned brave endures the trial with a defying glance, and unshaken nerves, he is sometimes spared at the urgent intercession of some bereaved father, or childless mother, and adopted in place of the dead. The fortitude of General Putnam was tested in this manner, by the Indians of Canada, in the old French war. And ruddy spot on her breast betrayed Where some coward's knife had entrance made. Oh! fatal pause!âa whistling dart Clove its red pathway to his heart, And uttering nor groan, nor yell, On high the chieftain sprang, and fell, While, toward him, old Conesus sped To tear the scalp-lock from his head.â âDid the bride escape, or was her doom More dark, more dread than an early tomb?â âWhen the haughty victor came to free His captive bound to the rugged tree, The blood from her veins had ebb'd away, And her soft, dark eye was dimmed for aye. Instead of a prize of beauty rare His couch to tendâhis lodge to share, A ghastly corse he found alone, Voiceless and cold as a figure of stone. âWhen leaves by the wind of night are stirr'd, And the quick, wild bark of the fox is heard, When the owl her dismal warning hoots, And a vivid flash the fire-fly shoots, Two spectral formsâold hunters sayâ The Huron chief and his dusky bride, Along the shore are seen to stray In gory garb, and side by side, Until they vanish in the grove That skirts the bend of the Haunted Cove.â THE WEIRD WOLF'S BARK. âAlarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf.ââ Shakespeare. In quest of wild game Went Ge-nut-e-gah forth, And trail that he trod Stretched away to the northâ Through wilds that were then To the pale-face unknown, With dog, pack and weapons He travelled alone: âOne moon will my lover Be absentââexclaimed His bride, by her nation âBlue Violet,â namedâ âOne long weary moon, When the daylight is fled, Will I listen in vain For the sound of his tread.â Two suns had not risen, And vanished away, When reached he dark woods Round Tyron-de-quat Bay; And sylvan lodge meet For a true hunter made Of lopp'd oaken branches With bark overlaid. Soon robbed he the red elk Fleet, star-eyed and tall, Of broad branching antlers To garnish his wall; And decked he the rafters With rich, furry spoil, Proud proof of his skill, And reward of his toil. His spear-head in blood Of grim bear he embrued, His long, feather'd arrow The panther subdued; The wild cat from den In thick swamp he decoyed By mocking its cry, And the creature destroyedâ The string of his bow Twanged the knell of the deer, Though lent to each hoof Was a pinion by fear; And trapped the brown beaver, That architect wise! And otter, though keen His unslumbering eyes. Ere dew-fall of eve With a sorrowful face, Lo! Ge-nut-e-gah speeds To his camp, from the chase Since day-dawn unbent Hath been bow that he bears, The fox hurries by him, But little he caresâ What change hath come over A hunter so keenâ Why fled hath the sunshine Of hope from his mien? The bark of the Weird-Wolf Hath 'larum'd his soul; A warning impels him That brooks not control. When packed were his fells, On a wearisome road, That led toward the huts Of his nation, he strode: Nor paused he to snatch By the way a repast When twilight's last gleam On the hill-top was cast; The stag gained his covert, The wild bird her nest, But Ge-nut-e-gah thought not Of halting to restâ On! on through the heart Of the forest he spedâ Around him thick gloom, And no star overhead. The chieftain next morn Raised a signal halloo! When the low, cone-like huts Of his tribe were in view; And back came a mournful Response on the galeâ A shrill cry of sorrowâ A wild note of wail; And tidings to trouble The heart of the bold Full well by the varied Inflection were told; By way of signal the Indian imitates the peculiar cries of different animals. When near an enemy at night, he makes his presence known to a friend in the darkness, by a low, and almost inaudible sound like the chirrup of a cricket. Disaster or triumph, when returning from a campaign against a foe, is expressed by the distant and delicately-modulated cry that announces his return to the nation. And inly awoke The presentiment drear That young Way-an-dah-go Seneca for Blue Violet. Lay stretched on the bier. To give him free passage Divided the crowd, And voices of mourning Grew loud, and more loud: He reached with impetuous Movement the doorâ He paused on the threshold, And doubted no more: To stifle deep moaning How vain his endeavor, For quenched was the star Of his nation forever, And shot through his bosom A winter-like chill, For the Weird-Wolf, alas! Had been bearer of ill. Superstitious persons, among the whites, are startled by the howl of a dog at night, especially when an inmate is sick, believing the melancholy sound ominous of calamity and death. The Senecas, on the contrary, hear a note of fearful warning in the bark of the wolf, when on their hunting or war expeditions. This animal, save when half famished, seldom barks, and when the unusual noise is heard in the woods, the Indian retraces his steps, believing that some hidden danger is impending over himself, or that some signal misfortune has befallen, or is about to befall, his family or tribe. I am indebted for information on this subject to Col. William Jones, of Leicester, a son of the late lamented Captain Horatio Jones, the Indian interpreter. RAINBOW SPIRITS. (A LEGEND OF SILVER LAKE.) âI am a spirit of no common rate.ââ Shakespeare. There is a lake of crescent form Lovely to sight in calm and storm, Washing the feet of misty hills, Whose sides, all ribbed with rocky bones, Send forth a thousand crystal rills Filling air with slumberous tones: Their foreheads, crowned with evergreen, Are mirrored in the wave below, And near the reedy marge are seen, When cometh June of radiant mien, Water-lilies with cups of snow. Many are lakes in the Seneca land Of azure breast, and glittering strand, That picture cloud and mountain well, But fairest of the cluster bright, By day, and in the starry night Is the lake where rainbow spirits dwell. A bow-shot from its border stood An Indian town ere the white man came, But demons issued from the wood, And gave its lodges to the flame, When not an arm to guard was near, And chieftain and hunters were chasing deer: Knife-pierced, the heart of childhood bled, And robbed of scalp was the hoary head; Sharp hatchet clove the mother's brain, And the summer dust drank crimson rain. Where was the daughter of the lake Of raven tress, and voice more sweet Than song of black bird in the brake When heard was the rush of hostile feet, And yells that sent a fearful thrill To her lover's heart on the distant hill? She was bending over a hillock low That marked her mother's place of rest, And the swelling turf was newly drest With flowers that symbolized her woe. Upstarting at the horrid sound Con-yok-way-oo looked wildly roundâ To earth, by spell of terror chained, One instant motionless remained, Then, light of foot, away she sprung, Like a frighted doe when the hound gives tongue. By barken cord to stake secured Her cedar-ribbed canoe lay moored In a basin fringed with the water willowâ And losing there its snow-white crown, Though high the gale, sinks gently down With murmur soft the billow. Her course the maiden thither laid Unloosed the bark, and pushed from land; Long line of flashing foam it made, So well she plied the paddle-blade, Receding from the strand. The spirit of her mother dear, Whispered a warning in her ear, When magical tints of darker blue Told that the water deeper grewâ âBetrothed one of Chu-gah-gos speed! Like flying gull the lakelet over, To help thee, in thine hour of need, Waits on the shore thy dauntless lover.â Grim, hawk-eyed foemen marked her flight, And in swift pursuit a birchen bark Cut with sharp prow the billow white While heaven as if to veil the sight, In that dread hour grew dark: The wind, with a sudden howl, awoke, And on the beach in thunder broke The heavy, laboring wave; The Cloud-King strung his sable bow, And fiery shafts on the flood below, Hissed as they found a graveâ When snarling wolf is on the track, The hunted fawn looks trembling back, Then onward flies with wilder springâ And Con-yok-way-oo pursuer eyed, And with quicker stroke the paddle plied, For a fiend was following. Su-ah-dis the bloodyâSu-ah-dis the base, Black, gliding snake of the Chippewa race, Was daring the perils of lightning and wave, To capture the bride of Chu-gah-gos the brave. The muttering tempest burst at length On Silver Lake in all its strength; Rain-drops danced on the lengthened swells, And made a tinkling sound like bells; A blacker bow the Cloud King bent, And swifter, redder arrows sent, While the voice of Ou-wee-ne-you made The wild beast in his lair afraid. Though the fleeing maiden governed still Her little craft with wondrous skill, Bark that pursuing savage bore, Fast gaining in the desperate race, Beheld Chu-gah-gos from the shore, And cover from his gun he tore, Lifting the weapon to his face;â But darkness in that moment dread, The face of the waters overspread, And blinded the hunter's aimâ Then, followed by an awful roar, From the firmament-wall did downward pour A sheet of lurid flame:â It gave the lake a strange attire, Wrapping each wave in a mantle of fire. When moan the tempest ceased to make, And the curtain of darkness was updrawn, The chief looked out upon the lakeâ Pursuer and pursued were gone: The sun beamed kindly forth again, And kindling up large drops of rain That on each balmy leaflet hung, The forest, with its columns tall, Round which the grape and woodbine clung, Changed to a green, enchanted hall O'erspangled with a roof of gems, Meet for celestial diadems, Could they have hardened, and the light Forever drank that made them bright. A bark that drifted near the strand, Chu-gah-gos grasped with trembling hand; And steered for the spot where last descried, Through the blinding storm, was his beauteous bride. Describing curve of matchless grace, The scene bright Us-tu-an-da cheered, And marked with radiant foot the place Where the Seneca maiden disappeared. With awe the youthful chief drew nighâ He calledâand a voice made low replyâ âMourn for Con-yok-way-oo no more, The joys and sorrows of time are o'er, For begun in joy, is her shining march To reach happy isles on this tinted arch, I am under obligations to D. S. Curtis, Esq., of Perry, Wyoming Co., for the following version of this legend: For several pleasing characteristics, there are, perhaps, none among all the beautiful lakes of western New York, that surpass, if they equal, the one which mirrors forth the ever varying features of the heavens near our happy villageâour own Silver Lakeâ emblem of the Christian's joy in humility; for, as he bows to its surface, his natural vision sees minutely the bright heavens above him; so by the eye of Faith the disciple of Jesus, as he meekly bends to the boundless streams of his Grace, discerns the unfading glories of the Heaven of Heavens. The crystal waters of this lake are deep and cool, abounding with a variety of sparkling fish; and surrounded by a fertile, elevated, and undulating surface of land which amply returns to the husbandman rich stores of nutritious products, to compensate his labor and expenditure. One peculiar feature in the conformation that bounds this lake, is, that its head and footâinlet and outletâare nearly at the same point, bending round in a crescent, with the convex side facing the sheet which pushes itself back three or four miles between the hills that confine it. We learned from our ancestors a strange and thrilling, but romantic legend connected with this location, gathered by them from the natives; of which we briefly give the leading incidents below, leaving it for the poetic and imaginative to clothe and breathe it forth in such strains as it may inspire. It is well known that the Senecas once inhabited the heavy forests that skirt the borders of this lake; here were their hunting grounds; here by the rush-fringed beach they enjoyed their social festivities, and in sincerity and simplicity worshipped the Great Spirit, as the lightning gleams of his eye were sent back in broken flashes from its storm-lashed waters, or his voice of thunder made its placid surface tremble. But to the âRainbow Legend:â A hostile band, when the chief and his braves were engaged in the hunt, stole upon their defenceless village, left in possession of old men, women, and children. Such as were not speedily destroyed sought escape in their canoes. Among them was the betrothed one of the chief. She was a prize to strive for, and escaped not the keen eye of the hostile leader. Regardless of others, he wrested a paddle and canoe from a trembling gray head just launching for flight, and pursued the fugitive. The chase was desperate, the crack of a rifle reached her returning lover's ear, who saw from the opposite shore the peril of one who âwas dearer than life to him.â Quick as thought his gun is at his cheek, but the lightning blinded his sightâthe gathering storm is now breaking over them. A mightier avenger looks down in his wrath; the storm-god did his work. When the sun again beamed forth, the young chief launched his canoe, and steered for the spot where the maiden and her pursuer were last seen. Us-tu-an-da (the Rainbow) spans the canopy, and plants one foot on the fatal spot. In fancy, he sees the disembodied spirit of the drowned maiden in the brilliant hues of the tinted arch. Since the events here related the Rainbow has been deemed by the untutored Seneca, as the highway of the just to happy hunting-grounds. He believes that its bright colors are the happy souls of innocent and chaste females basking in sunshine, as they dance to and fro between this and the other world; and if the young warrior may but see this token during the first moon of his love-making, he feels assured that success will crown his wishes. Females, dying before marriage, if uncorrupted, are called âSu-qu-a-tuan-daâ (Daughters of the Rainbow). In conversation with the late Captain Jones, he informed me that the Senecas combine, frequently, two or three words to constitute the name of an objectâthus: âSu-gu-aw-uc (daughter), Us-tu-an-da (rainbow),âSu-qu-a-tuan-da (Daughter of the Rainbow). And shifting hues, that point the way, Are souls between heaven and earth that play:â Mourn not!âto a cloudless clime I go, And my pathway is this beauteous bow That caught me up in its glittering fold When burning shroud for my foe was unrolled.â The vision faded by slow degrees, But music came on the wafting breeze, And Chu-gah-gos deemed it the last adieu Of his loved one, and lost oneâCon-yok-way-oo. BLACK PLUME. âA noble race! but they are gone With their old forests wide and deep.â Bryant. When dim in shade these meadows lay, That in the distance stretch away: When elk yon river sought in droves, And of its pleasant waters drank, Before the tall, primeval groves Receded from the bank; On this commanding swell of ground That overlooks the scene around, O'er his red brethren of the wood Black Plume, a famous sachem, ruled, And sixty winters had not cooled The fiery current of his blood. Moulded was his athletic form To brave the fight, to breast the storm, And vied his high heroic deeds In number with the wampum-beads Decking a war-belt proudly tied In knot of crimson at his side. One arm alone could bend his bow With sinews of the moose-deer strung; The gory spoils of many a foe In his bark cabin hung, The Senecas constructed wigwams, before the first settlers reared their log-cabins of bark, including the walls as well as roofs. The bark was fastened to poles stuck in the ground. The rafters were made of round poles, and tied together at the top, and crossed again at smaller distances by smaller poles, on which was ingeniously spread the barken roof. Berths, or shelvings, were made on each side of the hut, the lower one about one foot from the earth, on which they lodged, and the other about five feet high, on which they deposited their venison, and household furniture. The fire was built in the centre of the structure, and a hole left in the roof for the escape of smoke. And tufted scalps of conflict spoke While drying in the wreathy smoke. The Black Plume had a gentle child, A rose-bud blushing in the wild, Who well could quench the kindling fire Of rash resentment in her sire, Or calm by soft, caressing art The troubled fountains of his heart, When sad and weary he came back Without one victim from the chase: Her brow was shaded by the black, Long tresses of her race, And shone her dark eye like the rill Descending, star-lit, from the hill. The wildness of her âwood-notesâ clear Consorted with the forest well, And when their music on the ear Of haughty Black Plume fell, His scar-indented brow would wear Expression unallied to care, And smiles, like dawn illuming night, His martial countenance would light. One morning in the moon of flowers, May is the month designated by the âmoon of flowers.â âBefore the young moon's horn becomes a circle,â is an expression of time, frequently used by the âred rulers of the shade.â By imagery, derived from natural objects, this primitive people convey their grandest thoughts and emotions. âWho can tell the power of the Great Spirit?â said a native orator; âthe strong wind is his breathâthe thunder is his voiceâthe sun is his smile.â While dew hung twinkling in the bowers, The chief took down his bow unstrung, And round his ample shoulders flung A hunting robe of painted skinsâ Then, lacing, on his moccasins While nodded haughtily his crest Of sable hue, his child addrest:â âBeneath a purple banner fold March the first messengers of day, And drive with blades of glimmering gold The spirit of the mist away; The pleasant winds begin to rouse From rest the dark commingling boughs, And by their murmur seem to chide The hunter for his long delay: The tangled glen and forest wide Shall tribute to my woodcraft pay; The sharp edge of my fatal knife, Ere night, shall rob the bear of life, And my long shaft this day shall pierce The snarling wolf with hunger fierce, Or, from his throne of craggy rocks The lordly bird of conquest bringâ What prouder trophy for thy locks Than plumage of his wing?â Like one of peril nigh afraid, His trembling daughter answer made:â âOh, go not forth in quest of game! My mother, who hath long been dead, In visions of the midnight came, And with a warning gesture said:â âRose of the Senecas, give ear! The foeâthe Chippewaâis near.â Affrighted by the dream, I woke, And felt a wild, foreboding thrill, For warbled on the solemn oak, That shades our lodge, the whip-po-wil. I sought, a second time, my bed, And sleep my pillow visited: My long-lost mother came once more, And, her thin hands uplifting, said, In accents louder than before:â âRose of the Senecas! beware! The Chippewa hath left his lair!â I rose with fear opprest:âthe east Was radiant with the march of morn, And bees were busy at their feast In blossoms newly born.â âThy bodings, ominous of ill, May coward's heart with terror thrill, But think not, dreamer, to affright My soul with visions of the night!â The chieftain scornfully replied, And sought the wood with rapid stride. Noon passedâbut from his forest track The quiver'd hunter came not back; And when the day drew near its close Giving the west a tint of rose, And grew the landscape round more dim In mute expectance stood his child Her wigwam by to welcome him Emerging from the dreary wild. With ear intent she waited long To hear his whistle, or the song Sung by the people of her race Returning homeward from the chase; Many writers, who have made Indian character their theme, have erred in supposing that these sons of nature have âno music in their souls.â The barbarous discord of their rude drum, and turtle-shell rattle, I will admit is horrible; but that auditor must be dull of brain, and can little appreciate the âconcord of sweet sounds,â who will sit unmoved while the native choir, at the Tuscarora Mission House, are singing. Then hurried like a startled fawn When arrows to the barb are drawn, And, seeking gray, old men, made known Her many fears in trembling tone, And bade them forth fleet runners send Who lance could wield, and tough bow bend. Alarm was sounded, and a band Inured to war, and strong of hand, Went sternly forth for battle drest, Of their loved sagamore in quest. The warriors, after searching well Swamp, coppice lone, and bosky dell, Back came, with looks down bent in grief, Bearing the body of their chief. In his broad bosom stuck the knife, Red to the handle with his life; And the long scalp-lock that he wore, Was stiff with clotted drops of gore. His bearers felt a mournful pride To think not vainly had he died; For even death could not relax Firm grasp upon his battle-axe, And near the fatal spot were found Three foemen lifeless on the ground. They buried him:âthe place is lone Where stands his dark memorial-stone, Like some rude watcher of the dead In robes of green moss habited; And shaded by two dwarfish trees That wrestle feebly with the breeze. Amid their boughs are never heard The low, wild warbling of the bird, Or the blithe chirp of squirrel black, When spring, in green apparel clad, With airs of purity comes back To make the broad earth glad: When summer reigns, with cheek all bloom, To deck his grave no flower looks up, Enticing by its fresh perfume The wild bee to its cup: A few, misshapen shrubs that bear The whortleberry rustle there; But in my youth I thought ill luck Would fall on him who dared to pluck, Though, glittering in morning dew, Hung temptingly their berries blue. THE BIG OAK, OR THE ENCHANTED BOW. âThose wounds heal ill, that men do give themselves.ââ Shakespeare. Old chiefs, the pipe of peace to smoke, Met often in the days of yore Beneath this mighty council oak, Gray giant of the river shore. The famed oak, standing on the banks of the Genesee, in the town of Genesee, and which gave name to the Indian village of âBig Tree,â was a place of Indian council for ages. In the memory of men now living the calumet has been lighted beneath its over-shadowing boughs. A barken coat of armor clings Full closely to his aged stem, And far around he proudly flings The shadow of his diadem. What tales of vanished joy and grief Would long detain us in the shade, Could mossy bough, and trembling leaf Find tongue, and voluble be made. The scene around is peaceful now, And broken is the battle spear, But nations have been made to bow Beneath the yoke of conquest here. From this broad meadow, gemm'd with flowers, That in the lap of beauty lies, If spell to wake the dead were ours, What multitudes would 'round us rise. Dark maid and mother would be seenâ Sachems in forest war renownedâ The prophet with majestic mien, And hunter with his crouching hound; And near this oak of iron heart, Armed with his bright, enchanted bow, A dauntless chieftain would upstart, Buried a thousand years ago. Wild tale of him by red men told, Fair girl! I will recount to thee, While sunset changes into gold The ripples of the Genesee. Returning thanks for corn and fruit, Both sexes join promiscuously in the âCorn Dance.â They move round a block of wood in the similitude of a man, painted and adorned with furs, feathers, and ribands. Two men seated near the feet of the image make music by pounding on a skin drawn over the mouth of a kettle, and blowing on a rude flute. Deer's hoofs strung like beads, and fastened about the legs of the dancers, make a sharp, rattling noise. Their stated periods for rendering thanks to the Great Spirit for the favors conferred upon them, are in summer when the corn is fit for roastingâin the beginning of autumn, when their beans and squashes are repeningâand at mid-winter when they return home with the produce of the hunt. A tribe moved briskly in the dance To sound of drum, and Indian flute On this broad meadow's green expanse. While loudest from the throng the sound, The swelling sound of joy arose, The voice of jubilee was drowned By the shrill battle cry of foes. Maid, mother, boys and gray-haired men, Filled with a wild, contagious fear, Fled like some scattered covey when The screaming hawk is hovering near. Grasping their arms a little band Rallied to cover their retreat, Stayed by a chieftain's stern command Who loved the conflict-shock to meet. âAs marksmen of unequaled skill, Throughout the land, our sires were famedâ Now prove we that their children still Are archers goodââthe chief exclaimed: Then with a rapid aim, he drew A steel-barbed arrow to the headâ Three hundred yards the missile flew, Striking a fierce pursuer dead. The Delawares, in panic, thought No mortal hand the shaft dismissedâ That with the few in number fought Some demon-born antagonist. Their first, and foremost brave pierced through By the same matchless bowman fell, Who answered their retreat-halloo With one long, loud, triumphant yell. It was a fearful sight, I ween, When fled his enemies, to see In dying state the victor lean Against the trunk of this old tree. Untouched by point of hostile dart, Unharmed by thrust of hostile lance, Throbbed with a laboring beat his heart, While dimmer grew his eagle glance. âList! Children of the Hill!ââhe said, While round him met his sorrowing bandâ âShe-gua-on's foot ere long must tread The green shore of the Spirit Land. Indian names are generally significant of something in nature. Occurrences happening at the time of the birth frequently suggest names. She-gua-on anglicized is (Rattle Snake)âSu-ah-dis, mentioned in the legend of Silver Lake, (Black Snake)â Chu-gah-gos (Young Hickory), and Con-yok-way-oo (Daughter of the Lake). Also, Te-yos-yu, in the legend of the Big Hill, is the Seneca word for (Bright Eye)âGe-met-e-gah (Raccoon). Curiosity prompted me to inquire of a squaw the name of her pappoose; âOn-yit-hah!â was her reply; soon after meeting with my mother, who converses fluently in the Seneca, I learned from her the definition, which was âBird of the starry wing.â Though somewhat familiar with ornothology, I could not think of a feathered minstrel in our latitude answering the description, and I inquired if the name was any thing more than a fanciful appellationâwith a smile my mother answered that the night hawk was referred toâand that the white spots upon its wings were likened, by this imaginative people, to stars. Names are now and then changed in consequence of remarkable circumstances taking place, or of particular employments, or acts of individuals. âLast night in dreams your fallen chief Was warned of danger to bewareâ I woke, and near a glittering sheaf Of arrows found the bow I bear. âNo mortal cunning gave it formâ Its wood is not of earthly grain, But grew where winds blow soft and warm, Forever o'er the âDead Man's Plain.â âBy powers that guard our tribe in war In needful hour were also given Those tapering shafts so true and far By this elastic weapon driven. âMy hand was punctured by the steel, That heads their feather'd shafts, in fight; And medicine can never heal Wound made by them, however slight. âInter my bones when I am dead, Beneath this mighty council oakâ Here, pall the dropping leaves will spread, And dirge the forest raven croak.â The hero fixed a parting look On meadow fair, and river side, Then, while his limbs with coldness shook, Low death-song breathed, and calmly died. On a high scaffold, rudely made Three days the painted corse was throned, When a distinguished person died, sometimes the Senecas erected a scaffold, on which they placed the departed, in the attitude and habiliments of life. For a full description of the ceremony, I refer the reader to the concluding chapter of Stone's Life of Red Jacket, entitled âBlack Chief's Daughter,â and the facts of which were related to the lamented writer by my mother, while on a western tour gathering material for his work. In a rich robe of fur arrayed, With bead-inwoven baldrick zoned. Their chief, as if for battle plumed, Pillowed on trophies of the foe, With groans and tears the tribe inhumed Still grasping his enchanted bow. One night a young, ambitious brave, Who wished the trail of war to tread, Broke the green roofing of his grave To rob, of weapon charmed, the dead. Clay-cold, when morning dawned, he lay, The night dew clinging to his hairâ No stain of blood was on the clay, No mark of desperate combat there. Above She-gua-on's mouldering breast, The red man placed the turf again, Assured that by his place of rest, Armed spirits did a watch maintain. His ghost walks forth, with motion slow, When moonlight falls upon the riverâ Within his shadowy hand a bow, And at his back a gleaming quiver. Woe to the child of dust who dares To wound his funeral-oak with steel! Oh, never will he see gray hairs, Or peace in brain, or bosom feel! The spectre of the chief who lies Beneath its old, protecting bough, With hollow groans, and rending sighs, The wretch, at midnight hour, will rouse. Strange fires his life-blood will consumeâ Flesh from his bones will melt away, And, in a dark, dishonored tomb, Unquiet will his ashes lay. REPLY OF THE GREAT OAK AT GENESEO TO THE CHARTER OAK AT HARTFORD. âBold wrestler with the surly blast, Towers, athlete-like, the oak.â Thanks, brother of the kingly crest, For missive unto me addrest! The fay, who bore thy greeting fair, Is waiting my response to bear; And while his acorn-cup is filled With nectar by the night distilled, And, full of mischief, banquets he On luscious comb of swarming bee, I'll mar, with crabbed lines of age, The greenness of this leafy page. A thousand summers on my crown Have poured their golden sunlight downâ Winds of a thousand winters wild Snows at my feet have high up-piled, And still my venerable form Towers, in defiance of the storm. I stand, a melancholy tree, In valley of the Geneseeâ My throne is on the river bank, Once dark with oaks that, rank on rank, Raised their proud, rustling plumes on high, Encased in barken panoply. From acorns, sown by me, they sprung, For the bright axe their knell hath rung, And scarred and lonely I am left, A king of realm and subjects reft. Unsound am I at heartâand clay Is crumbling from my roots away, As if my mother earth would shun In his decline her royal son. Much have I seenâbeneath my boughs Tall elk have grazed, wild antlered brows: Crouching for prey, on mossy limb, My leaves have screened the panther grim, And I have heard the mammoth's roar A few years since, the skeleton of a mammoth was exhumed, within two miles of the site of the Great Oak of Geneseo, from a marshy spot, near a spring on the upland height, near were Temple Hill Academy now stands. The bones were too much decayed for preservation, except the teeth which may still be seen. Shake, far and wide, the forest-floor. Since rose, by light and rain-drops fed, From forest-mould my branching head, Like flowers have flourished and declined The wasting tribes of human kind. Above their unrecorded graves Primeval wood no longer waves; But flinty implements of chase, That tell of a forgotten race, While furrow broad his plough-share turns, Oft the brown husbandman discerns. The Seneca, who ruled of late These meadows, is of modern dateâ Long ere his blazing camp-fire shed On yon dark river gleam of red, A people, now extinct, possest There is a tradition among the Senecas that a people formerly lived in the Genesee valley who tilled the earth like the white man, and who were skilled in many useful and ornamental arts. Remains of their pottery may still be seen. They were exterminated by tribes of the Algonquin stock, who were in turn subdued by the conquering Iroquois, styled by the Jesuits the Romans of the west. The âReply of the Great Oak,â which was suggested by a letter from the Charter Oak of Connecticut, to the Great Oak at Geneseo, written by Mrs. Sigourney, appeared a few months ago in Graham's Magazine, and though not strictly a legend, was deemed worthy of a place in this collection, by reason of its reference to some old traditions. This vale with health and beauty blest. They reared their tent-poles in my shade, First fruits on smoking altars laid: With blood they reddened not the sod, Nor shaded trail of battle trod; And skilled were they in peaceful arts, For love found harbor in their hearts. The forests of the north outpoured, In evil hour, a robber hordeâ This harmless race they hunted down, As wolves shy deer in forest brown; To flame their pleasant hamlets gave, To young and old a common grave. Brief reign the conquerors enjoyed, By fiercer foes in turn destroyed: Braves of bold port and haughty crest, Well named the âRomans of the West,â For signal was their triumph shout That tribes from earth were rooted out. From flowery vale and mountain's brow Gone are the Aganuschion now; âThe Virginia Indians gave them the name of Massawourekes. The Dutch called them Maqueas, or Makakuase; and the French, Iroquois. Their appellation at home was the Mingoes, and sometimes the Aganuschion, or United people.ââ Clinton. Pale children of the rising sun At length the mastery have wonâ Their painted structures crown the height With roofs and spires, in sunshine bright; Changed is wide wood to thymy mead, Where âlordly horseâ and heifer feed, And commerce guides her freighted ark Where the plumed Indian steered his bark. When through my top the night-wind sings, Forsake the dust old forest-kings; Around my patriarchal bole, While near the moon-lit waters roll, They meet, a throng of shadows frail, Chanting a low and mournful wail. All broken is that little band, Patient of toil and strong of hand, Who left New England homes to rear An empire's proud foundation here. Beneath the landscape's verdure bright They rescued from domain of night To smile and blossom like the rose, Their consecrated bones repose. Ancient brother, in their fame Equal honor may we claim! Bound are thy coiled roots to earth In the land that gave them birth, Near thee were their cradles made, They in childhood near thee played; But a realm of virgin soil Was their theatre of toil. Here their iron manhood passedâ Here they won the prize at lastâ Here their funeral hillocks rise Linked with holy memories.â Have I written all have fled To the country of the dead? Still a cherished few remain, Bright links of a broken chain! A far-famed man of noble mien, Lord of those hills, these pastures green, And foremost of the Pioneers, In the pale winter of his years Yet lives with youthful strength endowed, And sends like me, though worn and old, To scythe-armed Time defiance bold. The name he bears that warrior bore âThe lights were instantly extinguished, and one Captain Wadsworth, of Hartford, in the most silent and secret manner carried off the charter, and secreted it in a large hollow tree.ââ Connecticut Historical Collections. The venerable James Wadsworth, since this poem was written, has paid the debt of nature. His efforts in the cause of education. âWill long keep his memory green in our souls.â Who hid, when night dusk mantle wore, Deep in thy gray and caverned bole Insulted Freedom's parchment-scroll. Brave men, who, in a desert lone To lay a nation's corner-stone, The joys of polished life forsake, And solitude's long slumber breakâ Dread pangs of thirst and hunger bear, And Genius of Distemper dare,â Are worthy of a prouder meed Than ever followed martial deed. Late to their graves such men should go, For them the tide of song should flow, And generations, as they pass Like chasing rain-drops down the glass, From age to age, with pious care, Should tombs that hold their dust repair. Oak of the Charter!âI have heard The raven croak prophetic word, And voices, at deep midnight, cry:â âThe moment of thy fall is nigh!â Boon nature's law must be obeyed, Her debt by man and oak be paidâ But long at foot of Wyllis' Hill In reply to an inquiry respecting this tree, (says Dr. Holmes,) a daughter of Secretary Wyllis wrote to me from Hartford, âThat venerable tree which concealed the charter of our rights, stands at the foot of Wyllis' Hill. The first inhabitants of that name found it standing in the height of its glory. Age seems to have curtailed its branches, yet it is not exceeded in the height of its coloring, or richness of its foliage. The trunk measures twenty-one feet in circumference, and near seven in diameter. The cavity which was the asylum of our charter, was near the roots, and large enough to admit a child. Within a space of eight years that cavity has closed, as if it had fulfilled the divine purpose for which it had been reared.â Thy stem may healthful juices fill! Loved by the free-born and the brave, Long may thine honored branches wave! Neglected in my sad decline, The fate of waning power is mine; The vines that round me clung of yore My rugged bark embrace no more, And birds, that erst my praises trilled, Their nests 'mid richer foliage build. Gone is the glory of my prime, And near is my appointed timeâ Full grown I wrestled with the gale When thou wert but a sapling frailâ Aye!âere the warming breath of spring Woke thee, a tender infant thing, Red chiefs, in beaded garb array'd, Held their war-councils in my shade. Last of the wood, I lift my head, My sylvan family are dead; And may the blast soon pipe my knellâ Yours, while a twig remainsâFarewell! JA-DA-QUA. These lines allude to a beautiful Seneca tradition that lends an added charm to Chau-tau-que Lake, in the State of New York. A young squaw is said to have eaten of a root shedding on its banks, which created tormenting thirst. To slake it she stooped down to drink of its clear waters, and disappeared for ever. Thence the name of the lake, Ja-da-qua, or the place of easy death, where one disappears and is seen no more. The renowned Corn Planter, in a speech to the president, complaining of his people's wrongs, eloquently exclaims: âOne of our sachems has said he would ask you to put him out of pain. Another, who will not think of dying by the hand of his Father, has said he would retire to Chau-tau-que, eat of the fatal root, and sleep with his father in peace.ââ Turner's Pioneer History. Famous in the days of yore, Bright Ja-da-qua! was thy shore, And the stranger treasures yet Pebbles that thy waves have wet; For they catch an added glow From a tale of long ago, Ere the settler's flashing steel Rang the green-wood's funeral peal, Or the plough-share in the vale Blotted out the red man's trail. Deadly was the plant that grew Near thy sheet of glimmering blue, But the mystic leaves were known To our wandering tribe alone. Sweeter far than honeyed fruit Of the wild plum was its root; But the smallest morsel cursed Those who tasted, with a thirst That impelled them to leap down In thy cooling depths, and drown. On thy banks, in other hours, Sat O-wa-na wreathing flowers, And, with whortleberries sweet, Filled were baskets at her feet. Nature to a form of grace Had allied a faultless face; But the music of her tread Made the prophet shake his head, For the mark of early doom He had seen through beauty bloom. When a fragrant wreath was made, Round her brow she clasped the braid; Then her roving eye, alas! Flowering in the summer grass, Did the fatal plant behold, And she plucked it from the mould: Of the honeyed root she ate, And her peril learned too late, Flying fast her thirst to slake From thy wave, enchanting Lake! When was gained the treacherous brink, Stooped O-wa-na down to drink; Then the waters, calm before, Waking, burst upon the shore, And the maid was seen no more. Azure glass! in emerald framed, Since that hour Ja-da-qua named, Or âthe place of easy death,â When I pant with failing breath, I will eat the root that grows On thy banks, and find repose With the loveliest of our daughters, In thy blue engulfing waters. THE GREAT YELLOW BIRD. âWhat bird in the distance is fanning the blast, This legend and the âOrigin of the Crow,â were communicated to the writer by Mr. Ely S. Parker, of Tonnewanda, a Seneca chief. Heh-nu, who is the hero of the latter story, figures in the wild mythology of the Iroquois, as the God of Thunderâthe bearer of the flaming bow. His way winging hither so fearful and fast? Oh, bright are the tints of a mid-summer day, But his plumes have a far richer golden than they; Now larger, and larger he looms on the sight, And rises and falls like a wave in his flight;â Fly, fly to your cabins! disaster he brings, And a storm is uproused by the rush of his wings.â The wild, warning words of the vigilant seer Sent homeward the sons of the forest in fear; They prayed to the Master of Life in their needâ Outstripped by the cloud-cleaving creature in speed, The roar of a battle would not have been heard, If raging, when by flew that ominous bird; The voice of the mighty Heh-nÃ¹ have been drowned By the flap of his pinionsâOh! terrible sound! Men, women and children fell prone on the earth, And rent was the cabin from ridge-pole to hearthâ In passing, so strong was the tempest it made That low was the pride of the wilderness laid: O'er the Lake of Oncida it swept on its way, Awaking the waters in thunder and spray: Then hurried along, in its merciless course, Announced by the whirlwind, its trumpeter hoarse. To memorize ever the wondrous event By the Great Spirit here was the Yellow Bird sent; It comes from the south in the season when passed That fiend, o'er this beautiful land, on the blast; Its feathers the same golden coloring wear, Up and down, up and down is its motion through airâ Woe! woe to the bowman who crimsons its breast! Woe! woe to the stripling who rifles its nest! ORIGIN OF THE CROW. Weary and worn old Tar-yon-ee Was slumbering, in the days of yore, Under a leafy white-wood tree That grew beside his cabin-door. Giving the wood a deeper brown, A raven, huge and black, came down, And, hungering for human prey, In his talons bore the chief away. While sailed to a distant mountain-peak With bleeding prize that cruel bird, A rush of wingsâa dismal shriek His tribe, with horror voiceless, heard: Soon finished was its dread repast, And up the monster hurried fast, Leaving, to whiten in the wind, A pile of naked bones behind. Heh-nÃ¹âdark Thunder-Godâespied The creature flying to its nest Far in those regions, blue and wide, That over stormy Cloud-land rest:â On his resounding bow he laid A shaft of ragged lightning made While the gorged monster, at the sight, Clapped pinions for a swifter flight. Outstretched was its long neck in vain, Soaring through air with frightful cries To reach its azure perch again On wall that fenced remoter skies; O'ertaken by a missile dire Scorched was each plume by hissing fire, And redly the dismembered form Was showered to earth in atoms warm. A hunter on the hills, in fear, Watched the torn fragments as they fell, Forgetful of a wounded deer That limped for shelter to the dell; But wilder terror thrilled his heart When shape took each disrupted part, And darkly, from the ground, uprose, Croaking their joy, a flock of crows. Beneath a cedar, tall and green, The bones of Tar-yon-ee were laid; His mountain-tomb may yet be seen Within its ever-during shade: Ill-omened ravens blacken oft Its branches towering aloft, And load, with clamors loud, the air As if they held a council there. NEUGA. Tread lightly on this hillock greenâ A warrior lies below; Red rust hath spoiled his hatchet keen, And broken is his bow; He looked upon this pleasant scene A thousand years ago. My mother told me, when a child, This fearful tale of him, While burned our camp-fire, high up-piled, Far in the forest dim; And fear old giants of the wild Changed into phantoms grim. âNeuga, in a fit of wrath, A younger brother slew, Who faltered on the battle-path, And weak and timorous grewâ Unused was he to blood and scath, And, ah! his years were few. âWild horror, when the deed was done Upon the murderer fell; He could not look upon the sun, Nor range the shadowed dellâ Black cords around his heart were spun, And demons howled his knell. âThe wretched warrior buried not The body, gashed and red; A shuddering coward from the spot With frantic bound he fled, And grisly monsters snarled and fought While feasting on the dead. âIn vain, beneath the trees at night, He couched to find repose; Round him would gather, to affright, Flame-eyed, unearthly foes, Arousing him to hopeless flight With stings and cruel blows âThree days he wandered in the wood; But on his rugged trail A brother's awful ghost pursued, Waking a hollow wail, And curses on that man of blood Were muttered by the gale. âA wandering hunter of the deer His beaded knee-belt found, And tracked the haggard murderer here With instinct like a hound, Who told this tale of guilt and fear, Expiring on the ground. âA curse is clinging to the mould Of his dishonored grave; No flowers of summer there unfold, But weeds and nettles wave; And fiends troop thither when the cold, Rude winds of autumn rave. âYon golden gate was firmly barred When westward strayed his ghost; A mighty spirit, keeping guard, Cried:ââSeek that gloomy coast Where dwell the doomed and thunder-scarred, A melancholy host!ââ MONA-SHA-SHA. (A LEGEND OF THE UPPER FALLS.) Go, tourist, where the Genesee Takes rise among the southern hills, And, swollen by a thousand rills, Flows on at last unclogged and free! Rocks vainly piled to bar his way, Look dim through clouds of mounting spray, And over ragged, flinty stairs The silver feet of his waves trip down, And beetling cliffs above him frown, But little the restless rover cares. Turrets tremble with pealing bellsâ Joy loudly winds his bugle horn, And the heart of a nation proudly swells When an heir to royalty is born; But, greeted by a strain more wild, Leaps from its fount the mountain-child: Old piny groves a mellow roar From their mysterious depths outpour Commingled with the panther's screamâ Murmur of torrents, and the cry Of the gray eagle circling highâ Meet welcome for a stream That dashes down, in youthful force, From the green hills to run its course. Go, tourist, where the Genesee, In falling, shakes the solid land! Cam, Avon, Teviot and Dee Roll not through scenes more truly grand: The vision, from one point of view, Is gladdened by a rainbow, blending Its colors with the snow-white hue Of cataracts descending; Through walls of rock, on either shore, That rise three hundred feet, or more, The river, like an arrow, sweeps, When taken three, tremendous leaps. A legend of the past will cling To these romantic falls forever, And time unfolds his cloudy wing To hide it with a vain endeavor. When came the moon, to hunter dear, Joninedah built his cabin near Their boiling rapids, white with foam, And brought with him a wife and child, To gladden, in the dreary wild, His temporary home. The region round was full of game, But back each night Joninedah came With empty hands, though bow more true No marksman of his nation drew. In vain some olden forest lay Light-hearted Mona-sha-sha sung, In low, sweet tones, to drive away The cloud upon his spirit flung; Then, while her infant boy she tossed To win a look of love from him, In soothing accent would accost The hunter, weak and worn of limb:â âCheer up! and break your lengthened fastâ Success will crown your toil at last; Fish in the river I have caught, And wild fruit from the forest brought, And golden comb of hiving bee Have found within the hollow tree.â âOn me keeps watch an evil eyeââ Would he despondingly replyâ âIn swamps I cannot enter, hide At my approach the fallow deer; Bad spirits turn my shaft aside, And gibber curses in mine ear: Duck, pigeon, and the partridge shy, Admonished of my coming, fly; The fox scents danger in the breeze, And to a closer covert flees; The wolf a mystic signal heeds, Then to a place of safety speeds, And timely warning to the bear Is wafted by the whispering air. When near the grazing elk, my tread Is lighter than the falling dew, But the scared creature lifts its head, Looks round, and vanishes from view. Bad spirits are abroad to harm, They rob of strength the hunter's arm, And curtain with a mist his sight, Though nature laughs in noon-day light.â Faint from a long, fatiguing tramp, One night returned he to his camp; Of no avail were arts employed By the fond wife to wake a thought Of brighter hoursâand unenjoyed, Untasted was the meal she brought. Within her trembling heart, at length, By anguish riven, was created A dark suspicion that the strength Of his affection had abated. Vexed that her most endearing phrase Brought back no sunshine to his gaze, Young Mona-sha-sha changed her tone:â âWhy fall my words on ear more cold Than the deaf adder's house of stone?â It was not so of old.â With moody brow and temper soured, By disappointment overpowered, The chief responded:ââI have heard The chirrup of a silly bird; As well, when howls the midnight storm, Look for a gleam of sunshine warmâ For blossom hunt to grace thy hair, When snows descend, and woods are bare, As idly hope to drive away The powers of darkness from their prey. There was a time, with joy replete, When Mona-sha-sha's voice was sweet, And not one cloud a shadow cast; But joy is deadâthat time is passed!â Without betrayal of her woe By tear-drop, or convulsive start, The wife had listened, while the flow Of bitter waters drenched her heart. On fells of wolf and otter brown Soon the tired hunter laid him down, And near young Mona-sha-sha kept Keen, silent watch until he slept; Then lashed the boy upon her back, And, darting through the cabin-door, Pursued a dark and dangerous track Conducting to the rocky shore Above the Falls, that filled with sound The gray, columnar woods around. When reached the water-side, she drew From cover dark a light canoe, And launched it on the tide That foamed and thundered, while her boy Clapped his little hands in joy By moonlight thus to glide. With skilful hand the bark she steered, Until the cataract was neared; Then threw away her paddle light, And hurried on by rapids white Like shaft of springing bow, The wailing mother and her child A tomb, walled in by rocks up-piled, Found in the depths below. Joninedah, from a troubled dream, When morning dawned, in terror woke; No eyes of love on him did beamâ No voice of honeyed cadence spoke: And he was goneâthat prattler gay! From whose endearing wile he turned, Of arts demoniac the prey, In moody discontent away, As if the tie of blood he spurned. Unhappy man!âone ember still, Though deep the gloom around him thrown, Unquenched by fiends who worked him ill, Burned on affection's altar-stone, And forth, aroused from posture hushed, To find those missing ones he rushed. Her footsteps, that had dashed aside The dew upon the grass, betrayed That she had sought the river-side, And thitherward his course he laid. Oh! fearful in expression grew The visage of that man forlorn, When answer to his shrill halloo! Came not upon the breeze of morn. Rough were the banks with rock, and steep, But down he dashed with frantic leap, And bloody drops his vesture stained Ere margin of the stream he gained. Canoe and tapering oar were gone, And round he looked with startled eye When suddenly a doe and fawn, Whiter than foam-flakes, darted by. No sound their hoofs, in passing, woke, And wondering the hunter stood Until they vanished in the smoke Thrown upward by the tumbling flood. Hope in his wildly troubled soul Died, giving black despair control; And, looking on the sun his last, Quoth he, in mournful tones and hollow:â âThe spirits of the dead have passed Inviting me to follow.â A knife he drew with haggard mien, And feeling that its edge was keen, The weapon plunged, while demons laughed, Thrice in his bosom to the haft: Then feebly staggering to the shoreâ His hunting shirt bedabbled o'er With life-blood, red and warmâ Shrieked outââI come!â with arms upheaved, As the wild, whelming waves received His gashed and falling form: A dirge the wind-swept forest sung, His knell descending waters rung. INDIAN TRADITIONS AND SONGS. THE BATTLE-GROUND OF DENONVILLE. Oh! what secrets are revealed In this ancient battle-field; Round are scattered skull and bone, Into light by workmen thrown Who across this valley fair For the train a way prepare. Pictures brighten thick and fast On the mirror of the past; To poetic vision plain Plume and banner float againâ Round are mangled bodies lying, Some at rest, and others dyingâ Thus the Swan-ne-ho-ont greet Those who plant invading feet On the chase-ground where their sires Long have kindled council-fires. Fragments of the deadly brand, Lying in the yellow sand, With the âfleur de lisâ to tell Of the Frank who clenched it well, When his race encountered here Tameless chasers of the deer; Arrow-head and hatchet-blade, War-club broken and decayed, Belts in part resolved to dust, Gun-locks red with gnawing rust,â While the buried years awake Eloquent narration make. Other sounds than pick and spade, When this valley lay in shade, Ringing on the summer air Scared the panther from his lair; Other sounds than axe and bar, Pathway building for the car, Buzzing saw, or hammer-stroke, Echo wild from slumber woke, When new France her lilies pale Here unfolded to the galeâ Rifle-crack and musket-peal, Whiz of shaft and clash of steelâ Painted forms from cover leaping, Crimson swaths through foemen reaping, While replied each savage throat To the rallying bugle-note, With a wolf-howl, long and loud, That the stoutest veteran cowed, Mingled in one fearful din Where these graves are crumbling in. Busy actors in the fray Were their tenants on that day; But each name, forgotten long, Cannot woven be in song. They had wives, perchance, who kept Weary watch for them, and wept Bitter tears at last to learn They would never more return; And, perchance, in hut and hall Childless mothers mourned their fall. In a vain attempt they died To bring low Na-do-wa pride, And extend the Bourbon's reign O'er this broad and bright domain. When the whirlwind of the fight Sunk into a whisper light, Rudely opened was the mould For their bodies stiff and cold: Brush and leaves were loosely piled On their grave-couch in the wild, That their place of rest the foe, Drunk with blood, might never know. When the settler for his hearth Cleared a spot of virgin earth; And its smoke-thread, on the breeze, Curled above the forest trees, Nor memorial-sign, nor mound Told that this was burial-ground. Since this bank received its dead, Now unroofed to startle sight, With its skeletons all white, More than eight score years have fled. Gather them with pious care,â Let them not lie mouldering there, Crushed beneath the grinding wheel, And the laborer's heavy heel. Ah! this fractured skull of man Nursed a brain once quick to plan, And these ribs that round me lie Hearts enclosed that once beat high. Here they fought, and here they fell, Battle's roar their only knell, And the soil that drank their gore Should embrace the brave once more TRIBES OF THE LEAGUE. The wheat grows tall on their old, forgotten gravesâ The meadows are spotted with flowers; The dark, green corn in its bladed beauty waves Where their fires burned bright in other hours. Though pale men dwell in their pleasant valleys green, And hushed is the hunter's halloo; Now and then their bones in the furrows may be seenâ To the Tribes of the League sing adieu. Though in dust the mighty Long have slumbered on, I will chant one stave for the Romans of the West, For the Romans of the West, dead and gone. They dance no more when the corn is in the ear, Or the moon of the harvest is brightâ They hunt no more for the panther and the deer, In the land that was won by their might. Tho' crushed a race that were dauntless in the fight, And broken their arrows so true, Their glory fled like a shadow of the nightâ To the Tribes of the League sing adieu. Though in dust the mighty Long have slumbered on, I will chant one stave for the Romans of the West, For the Romans of the West, dead and gone. They walked as lords on the soil of hilly Maine, And the shore of the Father of Lakes, Red war-paths trod where the Cherokee held reignâ But the morn for them vainly awakes. Their legends cling to the river and the vale, And our hills, with their mantles of blueâ Then, Bard, fling out, like a leaf upon the gale, To the bold Iroquois an adieu. Though in dust the mighty Long have slumbered on, I will chant one stave for the Romans of the West, For the Romans of the West, dead and gone. MENOMINEE DIRGE. We bear the deadâwe bear the dead, In robes of the otter habited, From the quiet depths of the greenwood shade, To her lonely couch on the hill-top made. There, there the sun when dies the day Flings mournfully his parting rayâ In vain the winds lift her tresses black, Ke-ton-ee-mi-coo, Wa-was-te-nac! TranslationâFlower, farewell. When ploughs tear up the forest floor, And hunters follow the deer no more, When the red man's council-hearth is cold, His glory, like a tale that's told, Spare, white man! spare one oak to wave Its bough above the maiden's grave, And the dead will send a blessing backâ Ke-ton-ee-mi-coo, Wa-was-te-nac! Another race are building fires Above the bones of our buried siresâ Soon will the homes of our people be Far from the bright Menominee; But yearly to yon burial-place, Some mourning band of our luckless race To smooth the turf will wander backâ Ke-ton-ee-mi-coo, Wa-was-te-nac! On the wafting winds of yesternight, The soul of our peerless one took flight, She heard a voice from the clime of souls, Sweeter than lays of orioles, SayââCome to that bright and blissful land Where death waves not his skeleton hand, Where the sky with storm is never blackââ Ke-ton-ee-mi-coo, Wa-was-te-nac! LAMENT FOR SA-SA-NA. âI dare not trust a larger lay, But rather loosen from the lip Short swallow-flights of song, that dip Their wings in tears.â Tennyson When hearts all joy, and cheeks all bloom, The ParcÃ¦ mark for an early doom, And ties are clipped by their cruel shears That bound us to the young in yearsâ His dirge in vain the Poet sings, Waking the wildly-wailing strings; For the tearless silence of despair, Not words, can loss so dread declare. Though sad to witness, day by day, Our loved ones waste with slow decay, While the features warm with a hectic glow, More bright than Painting will ever knowâ Thrice mournful is the stroke of fate, Leaving us wholly desolate, That falls, unheralded, to sever An idol from our souls forever. Though mine is not a practiced ear, Oh! how I loved her song to hear:â Her teachers were the tuneful rills And airy voices from the hills; The lay she breathed was nature's own, Melting the soul with its liquid tone, And caught from water-fall and bird Were notes by the spell-bound listener heard. Her large, black eye was ever bright With flashes of electric light, And her cheek with a glowing sunset red Like summer twilight, overspread. The shade of woods was in her hair, The blue-bell's grace in her queenly air, And the proudest, willing homage paid To the matchless charms of the Mohawk maid. Ah! gathered was this Rose of ours When life was in its moon of flowers, Ere canker soiled one tender leaf, Or frost had done the work of grief: She perished, like some worthless weed, In the track of the white man's iron steed; And strangers in the tomb have laid The crushed remains of the Mohawk maid. Poor, widowed mother of the dead! Thou wilt hear no more her bounding tread, But let one soothing thought control The grief that rends thy tortured soul. When sang of Heaven thy forest-child, What transport breathed in each wood-note wild; The path of a blameless life she trod, And the pure in thought shall look on God. Let velvet-moss o'er the slumberer creep Where the bones of her red forefathers sleep, And the spot be marked with no other sign Than some old familiar oak, or pine:â Better a quiet place of rest, With the turf of home upon her breast, Than the proudest tomb that trophied art Could build to cover her mouldering heart. RED JACKET. WRITTEN ON BEING PRESENTED BY A LADY WITH A WILD FLOWER THAT GREW ON HIS GRAVE NEAR BUFFALO. Thanks to the genii of the flowers Who planted on his humble tomb, And nursed, with sun and pleasant showers, This herb of faded bloom! And, lady fair, my thanks to thee, For bringing this frail gift to me. Although it cannot match in dye The velvet drapery of the rose, Or the bright tulip-cup that glows Like summer's evening sky: It hath a power to wake the deadâ A spell is in its dying leaf To summon from his funeral bed The mighty forest-chief. Realms that his fathers ruled of yoreâ Earth that their children own no more, His melancholy glance beholds; And tearless though his falcon eye, His bosom heaves with agony Beneath its blanket-folds. Within the council-lodge again I hear his voice the silence breaking, Soft as the music of the main, When not a wind is waking; With touching pathos in his tone He mourns for days of glory flown, When lay in shade both hill and glen, Ere, panoplied and armed for slaughter, The big canoes brought pale-browed men Over the blue salt water; When deer and buffalo in droves Ranged through interminable groves, And the Great Spirit on his race Smiled ever with unclouded face. Now, with a burning tale of wrong, He wakes to rage the painted throng And points to violated graves, While eloquence dilates his form, And his lip mutters like the storm When winds unchain the waves; An hundred scalping-knives are bareâ An hundred hatchets swung in air, And while the forest Cicero Lost power portrays and present shame, Old age forgets his palsied frame, And grasps again the bow. Thus, sweet, wild flower of faint perfume! Thy magic can unlock the tomb, And forth the gifted sagamore Call from the shroud with vocal art To sway the pulses of the heart, And awe the soul once more; For on his couch of lowly earth Thy modest loveliness had birth, And lightly shook thy blooming head, When midnight summoned round the place The kingly spectres of his race To sorrow for the dead; And sadly waved thy stem and leaf When Erie tuned to strains of grief The hollow voices of the surge, And for that monarch of the shade, By whom his shore is classic made, Raised a low, mournful dirge. The pilgrim from Ausonian clime, Rich in remains of olden time, Brings marble relics o'er the deepâ Memorials of deathless mind, Of hallowed ground where, grandly shrined, Sage, bard, and warrior sleep; And precious though such wrecks of yore, I prize thy gift, sweet lady, moreâ Plucked with a reverential hand; For the old chief, above whose tomb Its bud gave out a faint perfume, Was son of my own forest-land, And with bright records of her fame Is linked, immortally, his name. THE OLD INDIAN ORCHARD. I wandered alone on the banks of the river, And far to my right stretched the meadows away; Happy birds were in tune, warbling thanks to the Giver Of every good gift for the bounties of May. An old Indian Orchard, unpruned and neglected, Bright blossoms dropped round me in odorous showers; It flourished before the first settler erected His cabin of logs in the valley of flowers. Thick moss, pale adorner of ruin, was clinging To trunks by the winds of a century bowed, And tongues not of earth in the branches were singing Of times ere one furrow by white-man was ploughed. My limbs were aweary, for far had I rambled, And rest on the turf of the meadow I found, While near in the sunshine the gray squirrel gambolled, And stole forth the fox from his den in the ground. Composed by the murmur of waves gently flowing, A slumber stole over me, haunted by dreams; I thought that around me the forest was growing, Its floor by the sunlight touched only in gleams; With organ-like tones its dark canopy trembled, While timing to low, mournful measures their tread, The sachems of old in their war-dress assembled, A shadowy throng from the land of the dead. âHow bitter,â they chanted, âour deep desolation! The trails that we loved are erased by the plough! How changed are the wide hunting-grounds of our nation, The herds of the stranger range over them now! Gone hence are the children to whom we transmitted Traditions that match the gray mountains in age, And by, like a vision of midnight, hath flitted The glory of warrior, sachem and sage. âWe longed, in a land where the leaves never wither, To visit our ancient and kingly domain, And, sunset's red portal unfolding, came hither To look on the scenes of our childhood again. The river that freshens this valley hath shifted Its channel, and rolls where it rolled not of yore, And fallen are dark, solemn oaks that uplifted, Like sentinels tall, their plumed tops on the shore. âOld burial-places, once sacred, are plundered, And thickly with bones is the fallow-field strown; The bond of confederate tribes has been sundered, The long council-hall of the brave overthrown. The Mohawk and Seneca bowmen no longer Preserve at the door-posts unslumbering guard: We fought, but the pale-browed invaders were stronger, Our knife-blades too blunt, and their bosoms too hard. âAlas! for the heart-broken remnant surviving! The deeds of their fathers arouse them no more! His team o'er their hearth-stones the farmer is driving, Unroofed are their wigwams on Erie's green shore. Not long round the graves of the dead will they ponder, A cloud is above them they cannot dispelâ Lo! westward, far westward the homeless must wander, And land-robbers laugh while they sob out farewell!â I woke when their lay had the sagamores chanted, And traced on my tablets each musical word; Long after that vision my memory haunted; Long after those wild wailing numbers I heard: And oft, when the cares of existence oppress me, To visit the old Indian Orchard I stroll; The balm-breathing winds there more gently caress me, With murmur more solemn the dark waters roll. THE SENECA'S RETURN. âThy waves, dark rolling Genesee! Still lave the flowery shore; To look upon thy rippling tide I have returned once more; Thy glassy bosom pictures yet The sunbeam and the cloud, Though aged oaks that fringed thy bank, The ringing axe hath bowed. âThe sun smiles on the meadow green Once shadowed by the wood, And domes of beauty crown the hill Where our rude cabins stood: Where rang the hunter's call of yore, And blazed the Council Fire, The ploughman's whistle shrill is heard, And skyward points the spire. âThe moss of age has over-crept Our hallowed altar-stone, And traces of our former sway Are goneâforever gone. The dusky pilot guides no more His dancing bark-canoe, And bows of strength are snapped in twam, From which our arrows flew. âI visited the burial-place Where my dead sires reposed; But, ah! the secrets of the Past The plough-share had disclosed; And when I saw their naked bones Lie bleaching on the plain, The long-sealed fountain of my grief Gushed forth like summer rain. âOur dark-eyed maids will nevermore In pensive twilight hours, To strew upon their grassy mounds, Bring emblematic flowers; Their knives and hatches long ago Were eaten by the rust, And strangers tread with careless feet On their dishonored dust. âThe pale-face long since offered us The cup with poisoned brim; Our hearts grew weak with craven throbsâ Our falcon eyes grew dim. The birthright of our fathers brave We sold in our despair, And vanished is their old renown Like smoke in empty air. âThe waterfall that faintly sends Its murmur to mine ear, In solemn language telleth me The angry dead are near; And when the winds lift mournfully The sere, autumnal leaves, Methinks for his degraded son My father's spirit grieves. âTo seek the radiant Land of Souls, It is a fitting hourâ Farewell! old chase-ground of my tribeâ Lost home, and ruined bower!â One parting glanceâa sullen plungeâ The chief was seen no more, And the dark river glided on As calmly as before. GRAVE OF THE SACHEM. On yonder hill, on yonder hill The Red Chief long ago was laid; Those hoary oaks, remaining still, Their boughs above the sleeper braid. Although no marble rears its head, Erected by some filial hand, Like mourners, round his narrow bed The giants of the forest stand. When May gives softness to the sky, And gently waves her locks of gold, The shadows of the thicket lie Upon the dark, entombing mould. When greenest are the twinkling leaves Anear his silent couch of rest, The Ji-a-yaik Seneca for Robin. is heard, and weaves Of velvet moss her little nest. The oak and maple on his grave Rich palls of gold and crimson cast, When solemnly their branches wave, And tremble in the autumn blast. When frozen is each crystal spring, And nature wears a brow of gloom, The pinions of the tempest fling Pale snow-wreaths on his lonely tomb. Ah! where the trophy of the chase, And hut of bark are lying low, Rank thistles nod in breezy grace, And weeds of desolation grow. The Panther of his Tribe again Will never aim the feathered shaft, Nor, in the forest conflict, stain His knife in slaughter to the haft. In summer, when the world is still, And twilight clouds are growing dim, The Gwa-go-ne Seneca for Whippowil. on yonder hill Chants oftentimes a fitful hymn; The nimble chaser of the deer Lies, darkly blended with the dust; Beneath the shaded turf his spear, And dreaded hatchet idly rust. He sleeps alone!âthe light canoe Is rotting by the weedy shore, And Indian girls with blossoms strew The damp, sepulchral clod no more. Ere long the Bard will seek in vain Yon mound beneath those mossy trees; The share of some unthinking swain Will give its secrets to the breeze. THUNSERA'S LAMENT. Here, broken-hearted, Thunsera makes moanâ All have departed, She lingers alone. Fast fall her tears, and warm, On their old gravesâ Round her the beating storm Fitfully raves. The scenes of her childhood How altered are they! Red sons of the wild wood Have vanished away. Oh! once they were stronger Than pines on the hillâ Their hearts beat no longer, Their war-shout is still. Where dome and high steeple Of pale men are seen, The oaks of my people Stood pillar'd and green. A few, with tops blighted, Like mourners remain, From those disunited Who come not again. No camp-fire is burning, The hearth-stone is cold, And ploughs are upturning White bones of the bold. Like mist from the river, When red is the dawn, Bow, arrow, and quiver, And hunter are gone. A bright Isle is lying Far in the south-westâ The round sun when dying, Illumines its breast:â There flowers never wither Rude winds never blow, And thither, oh, thither, Thunsera must go! THE WHITE MAN'S DRUM. FROM THE INDIAN. Warriors, with their banners, comeâ Hark! I hear the white man's drum; Oh! it is a sound to make Fear a coward's heart forsake, And the Indian loves it well Though it is his country's knell: Warriors, with their banners, comeâ Hark! I hear the white man's drum. Thought awakes to pitch sublime, Though an enemy beats time, And the music's stormy roll Rouses daring in my soulâ A wild wish to barter life For the maddening joy of strife; Warriors, with their banners, comeâ Hark! I hear the white man's drum. I have heard old ocean's roar When upheaved were rocks on shore, Trumpet by the tempest blown When gray winter ruled alone; But those sounds could not impart Joy like this that floods my heart; Warriors, with their banners, comeâ Hark! I hear the white man's drum. SEMINOLE WAR-SONGS. I. Our women leave in fear Their lodges in the shade, And the dread notes of fray go up From swamp and everglade. From ancient coverts scared Fly doe and bleating fawn, While the pale robber beats his drumâ On, to the conflict, on! Shall tomahawk and spear Be dark with peaceful rust, While blood is on the funeral mound That holds ancestral dust? No!âfiercely from its sheath Let the keen knife be drawn, And the dread rifle charged with death!â On, to the conflict, on! The ground our fathers trod, Free as the wind, is ours; And the red cloud of war shall soak The land with crimson showers. Upon our tribe enslaved, Bright Morn shall never dawn While arm can strike, or weapon pierce!â On, to the conflict, on! II. Fire, famine, and slaughter, Have wasted our bandâ Our life-blood like water Has moistened the land; But truly our rifles The bullet will speed, While an arm can be liftedâ One bosom can bleed. The raven is croaking A dirge for the slainâ Our cabins lie smoking On prairie and plain; But paths we will follow To carnage that lead, While an arm can be liftedâ One bosom can bleed. Our old men lie mangled By wild wolf and bear; Our babes we have strangledâ Dread act of despair; And Vengeance will nerve us To desperate deed, While an arm can be liftedâ One bosom can bleed. Pale robbers are swarming In hammock and valeâ Their squadrons are forming With flags on the gale: We dread not their footmen, Armed rider and steed, While an arm can be liftedâ One bosom can bleed. BLACK-HAWK'S ADDRESS TO HIS WARRIORS. Where forest-boughs a shelter made, Gathered a warlike band, The moonbeams played on the shining blade Each carried in his hand. Though moonbeams played on the shining blade, No banner flapped its fold, But the painted streak on each swarthy cheek Was fearful to behold. Their chieftain, mutely standing by, Seemed born to be obeyed, And his heart beat high, as his flashing eye The wild, fierce band survey'd. His heart beat high, fierce flashed his eye, When thus he them addressedâ The deep tones stirr'd, as soon as heard, Revenge in every breast. âOur wildwood fathers, where are theyâ Can echo answer make? Like ocean's spray, they have passed awayâ Awake, then, warriors, wake! My sires, like spray, have passed away, Their bones are tombless now; Exposed are they to the light of day, By the white man's plough. âThe whites our tribe a falsehood told, Each belted warrior knows: For we never sold, for paltry gold, Earth where our dead repose; For paltry gold, we have never sold The loved land of our birth; Our grain they waste, where the hut was placed Remains the roofless hearth. âArm, warriors, for the fearful strife, For hoarded vengeance due; And let the knife, with the tide of life, Be dyed of a crimson hue! Unsheath the knife for deadly strife, Unused and dull too long, While round the post a gathering host Keep time to our battle-song. âChiefs! we are summon'd to the fight By voices from the dead: When the fall of night shuts out the light, They rise from their dreamless bed: When the fall of night shut out the light, I was afraid, appalled, For spirits pass'd on the viewless blast, And for vengeance call'd. âWith blazing homes the night illume, Sweet is revenge, ye know; And my sable plume will throw a gloom Upon the boldest foe: My raven plume will throw a gloom When in the breeze it shakes, And foes must die, while our battle-cry The infant's slumber breaks. âOur fathers trod the earth we tread, Lords of these fertile plainsâ No trace is seen that they have been, But tombless, white remains. List! for a spirit's voice I hear, The dead upon us call, To stain the knife, with the tide of life, To conquer, or to fall.â The chieftain spoke:âhis tameless eye Around with triumph gazed, As the painted band, with axe in hand, The yell of battle raised: The painted band, with axe in hand, Prepared for deadly strife, And each warrior felt, in his beaded belt, For his keen-edged knife. BIRD-NOTES. INSCRIBED TO MY ESTEEMED FRIEND, HON. THOMAS A. JOHNSON. PRELUDE. Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times; and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming. Jer. VIII. 7. The stork in heaven knoweth Her own appointed time, And like an arrow goeth Back to our colder clime; The turtle, crane, and swallow Come, on unerring wing, When northern hill and hollow Bask in the light of spring. But we, endowed with reason, Cannot foreknow the hourâ The sweet, appointed season For bursting of Hope's flower; When near the glad fruition Of toil that worked annoyâ When sorrow's drear condition Gives place to heart-felt joy. Lo! blighting frost encroaches On Autumn's sad domain, And Winter wild approaches To end his feeble reign: The birds of passage gather And fly across the wave, Their guide a Heavenly Father, Omnipotent to save. But man, with reason gifted, Cannot the hour foreknow When Hope's bright curtain lifted Reveals a waste of woe; When clouds send lightning flashes Our idols to consume, And dreams, resolved to ashes, Are scattered on his tomb. WINTER BIRDS. âIlk happing bird, wee, helpless thing, That in the merry months of spring Delighted me to hear thee sing, What comes of thee? Where wilt thou cow'r thy chittering wing, And close thy e'e?â Burns. When the last red leaves have disappeared, And icicles hang from December's beard, Through the naked woods I love to stroll, While the leaden clouds above me roll. Though the landscape wears a frosty dress I feel not a sense of loneliness, For chirping voices on the breeze, Come from the mossy bolls of trees. The titmouse, restless little bird! Tapping the mouldering bark, is heard; His nimble figure ill-descried On the beechen trunk's opposing side. And âPicus minorâ plies his trade, Hunting for dens by insects made; Knocking off flakes of dropping wood To pound with his hammer their loathsome brood. Snow on the blast is whirling by, But âchink! chink!â is his cheerful cry; What cares he for the blinding storm? Both have their mission to perform. The farmer, lacking wisdom, hears Thy shrilly note with idle fears; Growling, while sounds each measured rap, âDeath to the robber that bores for sap!â Toward thee he should be kind of heart, For a guardian of his trees thou art; Thou leavest not a grub alive, And after thy visits they better thrive. The gray elm, shorn of his leafy crown, Finds a loyal friend in the Creeper brown, Hunting for vermin in crevices dark, That health may return to the wounded bark. âQuank! quank!â the Nuthatch sings, As his horny bill on the white-oak rings; Ill will the bug and spider fare, For a spear-like tongue explores their lair. The rain that freezes as it falls, Drives not him from the forest-halls; Though stem and twig are with ice encased, His note still rings through the wintry waste. From the larger boughs I have seen him launch To the swaying tip of the lightest branch, Then round it track his spiral way, Probing the spots of old decay. Blithe little birds of winter wild! I loved ye when a happy child; Now manhood's beard is on my chin, But draughts of delight from ye I win. Ye are links that bind me to the past, That realm enchanted, dim and vast; And my paths through the dreary, drifting snow, Ye cheered in the winters of long ago. May ill befall the man or boy, Who one of your number would destroy! Ye are never false to your native bowersâ Ye are doers of good in this world of ours. THE SNOW-BIRD. âCall the creatures, Whose naked natures live in all the spite Of wreakful Heaven.â A mystic thing is the gray snow-bird That cometh when winds are cold; When an angry roar in the wood is heard, And the flocks are in the fold. Though bare the trees, and a gloomy frown Is worn by the wintry sky, On the frosted rail he settles down, And utters a cheering cry: Why should a note so glad be heard? A mystic thing is the gray snow-bird. In sullen pauses of the storm He warbles out his lay, Though wing he has to waft his form From the chill north far away. Why wandereth not the feathered sprite Through heaven's airy halls, To a land where the blossom knows no blight, And the snow-flake never falls: Why linger where the blast is heard? A mystic thing is the gray snow-bird. Sweet offices of love belong To the smaller tribes of earth, From the mead-lark piping forth his song, To the cricket on the hearth; And the mystic bird of winter wild His blithest note outpours When the bleak snow-drift is highest piled Upon our northern shores; An envoy by our Father sent To banish gloom and discontent. Oh! we are taught by his gladsome strain That the sunshine will come back; Though scud the cloudsâa funeral train, Arrayed in solemn black; That the streams from slumber will awake, The hoar-frost disappear, And the golden wand of spring-time break Grim Winter's icy spear: Then let our hearts with joy be stirred, For a herald glad is the gray snow-bird. When my perished flower on a creaking bier To a sunless couch was borne, Hope, like the snow-bird, came to cheer My breast with anguish torn; And I thought, in the winter of my grief, Of a land of light and bloom, Where the yew-tree never dropped a leaf On love's untimely tomb; Where knit anew are broken ties, And tears stream not from mournful eyes. POET AND SNOW-BIRD. Happy bird! with plumage gay, Whither away? whither away? Snow is on the landscape drearâ Why with song the desert cheer? Feathered lyres like thee beseem Vernal bower, and running stream; Green upon the meadows' breast, Arching sky in azure drest. BIRD. When the cheek of Earth is cold, Winter's banner pale unrolled, From my trackless home I fly, Over which hangs mystery, Man to tell of brighter days Coming to delight his gaze; With my carol, in his heart, Wake contentment and depart. POET. Bird! thou art a type of those Prophets in our vale of woes, Who, in thrilling tones, declare That man's future will be fairâ That a morn, at last, will dawn When, aside the curtain drawn, He will mark, oh! scene sublime! Death of woe, and fall of crime; Human hearts of hate devoidâ Wintry selfishness destroyed; Love, with summer brightness zonedâ Peace, a conqueror, enthroned. FIRST NOTES OF THE ROBIN A voice of comfort to a dreary world Is thine, red-breasted warbler. Thro' long months, To glade, and upland ridge, and wood-path wild, My foot-prints have been strangers: olden haunts By tones of discord have been visitedâ The loud, hoarse clarion of the trooping storm; Hail rattling on sere leaves and frozen mould, Like gravel on the coffins of the dead; Wild moanings of the leafless, swaying boughs, Like creatures racked with keen, contorting pangs, The clink of icy spears by Winter hung, His cold war-weapons, on the frosted treesâ These are drear sounds in places that we loved In the gay moon of flowers, or autumn time, When groves were gorgeous with prismatic dyes. But thou hast come at last, melodious bird! From orange-arbors in the southern land, To light the dimmed horizon of my heart, And purge my spirit of its melancholy; For in thy strain, with joy articulate, There is a cordial for a bosom sadâ A medicine for low, complaining moans. And will thy prophecies of golden hours, Green lawns, bright blossoms, and rejoicing rills Prove, like the visions of my youth, untrue? Oh, no! winged messenger of hope and love! Unerring instinct prompts thy gifted tongue, In carol clear, a truthful tale to tell. Oh, what a lesson might the wayward bard, Who prostitutes his dower of Genius rare, By masking falsehood in mellifluous rhyme, And decking sin with rosy coronal, Forerunner of mild weather, learn from thee! Companioned by thee I will sit once more Far in the shadowy depths of forest oldâ In mossed, sequestered nooks of other yearsâ Beneath a canopy more rich than king, Crowned and anointed, boastsâthough cunning hands To lull his soul, touch dulcet instruments: Nor will I lack rich minstrelsy to calm Unquiet throbbings of a fevered pulse. There will the timorous partridge beat his drum; Perched on dark stump in meadow near, the quail Whistle a signal to her ambushed brood; There insect tribes will blow their pipes so shrill; Low, droning bugles will the bee-swarm wind; Wreathed leaf-harps will be fingered by the winds: There will thy chant, plumed harmonist, be heard In the blithe, general concert of the grove, While passing crane, with slender neck outstretched, Of that wild band will be the trumpeter. The water-fall will shake its silver bells, Timed to a lively and tumultuous air; A gurgling laugh will ring in lapsing brooks, As if young Naiads, on their pebbly floors, Were treading, in their mirth, a measure light. Changesâsome mournful and some gladâhave passed Around me since November drove thee forth To find a refuge in a warmer clime. My little daughter, then too young to mark The mellow cadence of thine evening lay, Or quick pulsations of thy swelling throat, Or thy wings' rise and fall abrupt in flight, Now makes a trial of her strength to leap From her fond father's arms, when near my door Thy song in honor of victorious Spring, Knocking frost fetters from the streams, is heard And I will teach her with enamored gaze To look on thy round nest, contrived with skill, And think, the while, of earth's great Architect: And I will teach my blue-eyed one to love Thy callow younglings, sinless as herself, And white crumbs scatter for the mother nigh, And with pure thoughts her budding mind inform By frequent strolls through woods and pastures green. Alas! a few who heard thy sad farewell Die on the wild, autumnal blast, away Have gone to early graves. Will not thy strain In the drear church-yard, white with lettered stones, For them breathe sorrowing? As yet the clods That roof their lowly mansions have put forth Nor pleasant herb, nor blade of sighing grass; But thy return gives promise to bruised hearts That flowers ere long will grace their sepulchres Types of eternal summer, in a land That lies beyond death's dark and wintry caves. ROBIN RED-BREAST. âCall for the robin red-breast and the wren, Since o'ver shady groves they hover, And with leaves of flowers do cover The friendless bodies of unburied men.â Webster. Thy clear familiar notes recall The inmates of my father's hall; The mother on whose breast I lay Ere known was one unhappy day; My blushing sisters, in the pride Of beauty springing side by side, And playful brothers, fair of face, My chubby rivals in the race. The past its portal open flings, And memory expands her wings: Again a rosy, laughing child, I thread the mazes of the wild, And mark the rounding out thy nest, Ruffling the feathers on thy breast, Or listen to thy mellow lay When mourning the decline of day. I hear thy softly-warbled strain, And olden dreams come back again: While airy shapes are drawing near, The voices of the dead I hear; I stand in thought beneath the shade Of trees by my own planting made, And, on the river's willowed shore, Stroll with my rod and line once more Tradition tells a tale of thee Forever dear to memory: When the lost children, side by side, In the dark wood lay down and died, Arm locked in arm, a heavenly pair, For earth too sweet, for life too fair, Dropping bright leaves, their forms to cover, Above them thou didst gently hover. Bird of my choice! a boon I crave: Go seek my little daughter's grave, And warble on the oak that grows Near the green couch of her repose; When living, with delighted ear She listened oft thy song to hear, And clapped her tiny hands when spring Brought thee from far on fluttering wing. ADDRESS TO THE SWAN. âDulcia defoctÃ¢ modulatur carmina linguÃ¢, Cantatur cygnus funeris ipse sui.â Ovid. Stately bird! from lake and bay Fled a grace and charm away, When Improvement's thrilling call Pierced the forest's leafy hall From blue waters, once thine own, Scaring thee to haunts more lone. Reeds and rushes fringe the shore, But they hide thy nest no more; Water-lilies, without stain, Decorate thine old domain, But thy soft and rounded breast In a purer white was drest. Driven forth by winter cold From the polar wastes of old, Music from the sky would fall, Louder than a battle-call, As thy pinion, peerless swan! Bore thee, in thy beauty, on. Never listened mortal ear To a voice more full and clear, Not unlike in depth of tone Blast of conch-shell loudly blown, Or a far-off trumpet wail Modulated by the gale. The wild red-man with delight Heard that challenge shrill at night, As, revealed by moonlight fair, Sped thy form through fields of air; Vans of silver, broad and strong, Southward wafting thee along. Prized by chief and forest king Was the plumage of thy wing; On the head of Indian maid Low winds with thy feathers played, And thy down, so rich and warm, Edged the robe that wrapped her form. Age, that cripples mortal power, Wasting pile, and crumbling tower, Sullies not thy vesture white, Or brings darkness to thy sight, Though a century may have fled Since thy first wing-quill was shed. Purer type the fabling mind Grace to picture cannot find, And when Art on canvas drew Venus, born of ocean blue, Yoked to chariot of the queen Swans, with arching neck, were seen. Ovid, in his sweetest verse, Loved thy praises to rehearse; Flaccus, in his polished lay, Tribute unto thee did pay, And in Plato's mighty tome Ever thou wilt find a home. Still would I believer be In the tale they tell of theeâ Breathing in the hour of death Music with thy latest breath; Tuning, with a failing tongue, Strains the sweetest ever sung. Blest may merry England be, For her statutes guarded thee; Those who soiled thy plume with gore Branded mark of felon bore, And admiring lords and dames Viewed thee sailing on the Thames. âRare old Benâ could find no name Worthy of a Shakespeare's fame But thine own, majestic bird! Now a consecrated word With unmatched poetic lore Intertwined for evermore. THE CROW. âLight thickens, And the crow makes wing to the rooky wood.â Their icy drums the polar spirits beat, And dark December with a howl awakes; But on I wander, while beneath my feet The brittle snow-crust breaks. The fleecy flock to find one juicy blade Scrape, with their lifted hoofs, the snow away; Ended the long, loud bleat of joy that made So blithe the meads of May. With wildly mournful bellowings around Yon fence-girt stack the hungry cattle crowd; For the drear skies on their old pasture-ground Have dropped a heavy shroud. Housed in some hollow beech the squirrel lies, Scared by the whistling winds that scourge the wold; The hardy fox is not a-foot, too wise To brave the bitter cold. Far in the gloomy cedar-swamp to-day The ruffed grouse finds a shelter from the storm, And, fearless grown, the quail-flock wend their way To barns for cover warm. One bird alone, the melancholy crow Answers the challenge of the surly north; The forest-tops are swinging to and fro, But boldly goes he forth. His pinions flapping like a banner-sheet, While high he mounts above the forest tall, Shake from their iron quills the pelting sleet With measured rise and fall. The sinning Court of Bards an evil name On the poor creature long ago conferred; It was a lying judgment, and I claim Reversal for the bird. I know that with a hoarse, insulting croak, When planting time arrives and winds are warm, On the dry antlers of some withered oak He perches safe from harm. I know that he disturbs the buried maize, And infant blades upspringing on the hills; That man a snare to catch the robber lays, While wrath his bosom fills. But is he not of service to our race, Performing his allotted labor well? Although a bounty on his head we placeâ The rifle-crack his knell. Warned is the reaper of foul weather nigh, When the prophetic creature, in its flight, With a changed note in its discordant cry, Moves like a gliding kite. While louder grows that wild, presageful call, Sheaves are piled high upon the harvest wain, And the stack neatly rounded ere the fall Of hail, and driving rain. Be just, then, farmer, and the grudge forget, Nursed in thy bosom long against the bird; Thy crop would have been ruined by the wet Had not that voice been heard. Health-officer of nature, he will speed, Croaking a signal to his sable band, And dine on loathsome offals, ere they breed Contagion in the land. When the round nest his dusk mate deftly weaves, He sits, a warrior in his leafy tent; And the fierce hawk prompt punishment receives If near, on mischief bent:â Thus at the door-sill, guarding babes and wife, The dauntless settler met his painted foe; Love giving, in a dark, unequal strife, Destruction to his blow. He is no summer coxcomb of the air, Forsaking ancient friends in evil hour, To find a home where Heaven is ever fair, And the glad Earth in flower. Though man and boy a warfare with him wage, He loves the forest where he first waved wing; Awaiting in its depths, though winter rage, The bright return of spring. That love is noblest that survives the bloom Of withered cheeks that once out-blushed the rose; True to its fading object in the gloom Of life's dull wintry close:â And the poor Crow, of that pure love a type, Quits not the wood in which he burst the shell, Though fall the leaves, and feathered armies pipe To the chill North farewell! THE BLUE-BIRD. âWhen first the lone butterfly flits on the wing, When red glow the maples, so fresh and so pleasing, O, then comes the blue-bird, the herald of spring, And hails with his warblings the charms of the season.â Wilson. A bird, perched on my garden-rail, While falls the drizzling rain, And nature hath a voice of wail, Outpours a cheerful strain. Wherewith can I compare the hue That decks its back and wingsâ Old Ocean's azure, or the blue O'er heaven that June-time flings? Oh, no! the fresh deep tint they wear That clothes the violet-flower, When nodding in the vernal air, And laughing in the shower. From earth I feel my soul withdrawn, I am a child again, While thus flows eloquently on The burthen of its strain: âWipe, weeping April! from thine eyes Away the rainy tears, A voice that tells of cloudless skies Is ringing in mine ears: Fair flowers, thy daughters, mourned as dead, Will start up from the mould, And, filled with dewy nectar, spread Their leaflets as of old. âThe brotherhood of treesâthe strongâ Green diadems will wear, And sylphs of summer all day long Braid roses in their hair; And, harbinger of weather mild, The swallow will dart by, While brighter green adorns the wild, And deeper blue the sky. âSoon, April, will thy naked brows With fragrant wreaths be crowned, And low winds in the leafy boughs Awake a slumberous sound. Charged by a Power who made my way Through airy deserts plain, I come to breathe a truthful lay, And make thee smile again.â Plumed pilgrim from a southern shore, Thrice welcome to our land! Telling the bard of good in store, Of golden hours at hand. Throbs merrily thy little breast In reddish vesture clad; A scene of sorrow and unrest Thou comest, bird, to glad! So through thy hall, oh, human heart! Its inner gloom to light, Rays of celestial sheen that dart Herald the death of night; Telling full sweetly of a clime Where winter is unknown, Of fields beyond the shore of Time, With flowers that die not strown. THE KINGFISHER. âThe blue Kingfisher's eager scream, Watching the wake of perch or bream.â Poetic haunts are thine, Bird of the snowy ruff and saucy crest! Plunging in streams that hurry to the brine, And lakes of azure breast: And by the mill-pond's edge Full oft, when strolling, I have heard thy cry, And marked thee, over water-flag and sedge, Speed on thine errand by. Supported in mid-air, Above the river by thy humming wings, How flames thy glance while trout its bosom fair Break into widening rings! Amid bright scenes like these, The days of thy wild life begin and end, Seldom a wanderer from the dry old trees That o'er the waters bend. Did not thy belt of blue Catch from the sky-reflecting wave a stain, And the white gorget round thy neck its hue From foam-bells woke by rain? Thy voice is like in sound The twirling of a watchman's rattle loud, Wilson. When grisly danger meets him on his round, Beneath night's leaden cloud. Could not the brook and rill, Ever thy loved companions, tune thy throat To softer utteranceâteaching thee to still That harsh alarum-note? Thy favorite fishing-ground Is where dead trees make desolate the strand, And otter-tracks are by the trapper found Upon the yielding sand. The torrent's angry roar To thee, wild creature, is a sound of joy, While keeping vigil nigh the rocky shore, Some victim to destroy. There with keen, restless eyes I have beheld thee perched, half-hid in spray; Then, with a sudden plunge, thy finny prize Secure, and bear away. Thine undulating flight Mimics the billow in its rise and fall; Mad rapids are more pleasing to thy sight Than the grove's leafy hall. Art thou the bird of eld That built its nest upon the cradling deep, Owning a charm when wind and wave rebelled, To hush them into sleep?â The Halcyon of Song, Whose plume was deemed a talisman to guard The fortunate possessor from all wrong By seer and fabling bard? I know not, but the Past, When I behold thee, bird, her face unveils, And back on busy recollection, fast Crowd old, romantic tales. THE WOOD-THRUSH. âIn dark, wet and gloomy weather, when scarce a single chirp is heard from any other bird, the clear notes of the wood-thrush thrill through the dropping woods, from morning to night, and it may truly be said that the sadder the day the sweeter is his song.ââ Wilson. A bird with spotted throat and breast, Is singing on the tallest tree, While day is fading in the west, In strains that with the time agree. I know the little minstrel wellâ His favorite haunts are also mineâ The silence of the shaded dell O'erbrowed by hills of murmuring pine. Breathe out thy mellow vesper lay, While shadow drapes the listening skies; Far in the forest-depths away How plaintively the music dies! With sunset, to their nests have flown Gay birds that love the golden light, And left thee in the woods alone To welcome melancholy night:â And I am glad no warbler near Responds to thy transporting strain, For never will a mortal ear List to such melody again. Let other instruments be mute, And Silence lock them in her caveâ Even the warble of a flute Creeping by moonlight o'er the wave. In murky weather, when the sun Is hidden by a cloudy veil, And the plumed wanderers, one by one, Have hushed their pipes in wood and daleâ Delighted, often I have heard Thy symphonies so clear and loud, And wondered that a little bird Was with a voice so sweet endowed. Where alders overhang the stream Thy mate's frail nest I have espied, Protected from the noon-day beam With its four gems in azure dyed: Fit place to rear a singing brood Was the wild scene that lay around, While mocked the gray, majestic wood Old, solemn Ocean's bass profound. Shy, unobtrusive bird! thou art An emblem, beautiful and meet, Of the poor poet's weary heart That loves in solitude to beatâ A lofty heart that finds relief, And inspiration deep and strong, When closeted with gloom and grief, Its chords grow tremulous with song. THE WOOD-DUCK. âNow stealing through its thickets deep In which the wood-duck hides.ââ Street. Far from ocean, ever flecking His broad, shelly beach with foam, Near untroubled, inland waters Finds the wild wood-duck a home. Over seas with gull and petrel Should he strive the storm to dare Roaring surf and bursting billow Landward would the creature scare. Where the forest veils in shadow Marshy beds of creeping streams, Or, on lilied ponds the sunlight Falls with interrupted beamsâ Through tall flag and reeds that tremble In his wake the creature swims, Or, above the sluggish current, Sits on overhanging limbs. Strolling by the grassy margin, Oft have I the creature seenâ Colors playing on its plumage Of the richest gold and green. And my gun into the hollow Of my arm have thrown, and stood Gazing on the lovely vision Under cover of the wood. Bronze and violet reflections Flashed above its tameless eye, And the crown it wore was royal Of the deepest Tyrian dye. When the timid bird espying With her nimble brood, I think Of old Tribes that sought yon river From its sparkling wave to drink; Voices of the past are waking Echoes in the solemn grove And again their cabins cluster On the banks of pond and cove; For the wood-duck furnished feathers When a forest-king was crowned, And another race were rulers Of the pleasant scene around; And a gorgeous skin, with cunning, From the head and neck was peeled That adorned the Pipe of Council, And its cany stem concealed: From his crest and glittering pinions For the maid of doe-like glance Furnished plumes that, 'mid her tresses, Fluttered in the festal dance. In the hollow trunks of ruin Builds the summer-duck a nest, Though a favorite of nature In her brightest colors drest; And not strange to me it seemeth That a bird so richly clad Should delight in breeding places That awake reflection sad: For a lasting law the sunlight Unto darkness hath allied, And Decay is ever claiming Beauty as his chosen bride. THE SWALLOW. âLa Rondinella, sopra il nido allegra, Cantando salutava il nuovo giorno.â âThe swallow is one of my favorite birds, and a rival of the nightingale; for he glads my sense of seeing, as the other does my sense of hearing.ââ Sir H. Davy. Warm, cloudless days have brought a blithe new-comer, Beloved by young and old, That twitters out a welcome unto summer, Arrayed in green and gold. With sunlight on his plume, the happy swallow Is darting swiftly by, As if with shaft dismissed by bright Apollo His speed he fain would try. Now high above yon steeple wheels the rover, In many a sportive ring; Anon, the glassy lakelet skimming over, He dips his dusky wing. Old nests yet hang, though marred by winter's traces, To rafter, beam and wall, And his fond mate, to ancient breeding-places, Comes at his amorous call. Those mud-built domes were dear to me in childhood, With feathers soft inlaid; Dearer than nests whose builders in the wild-wood Were birds of man afraid. To seedy floors of barns in thought I wander, When swallows glad my sight, And play with comrades in the church-yard yonder, Shut out from air and light. The âguests of summerâ in and out are flying Their mansions to repair, While on the fragrant hay together lying, We bid adieu to care. Barns that they haunt no thunder-bolt can shatter, Full many a hind believes; No showers that bring a blighting mildew patter Upon the golden sheaves. Taught were our fathers that a curse would follow, Beyond expression dread, The cruel farmer who destroyed the swallow That builded in his shed. Oh! how I envied, in the school-house dreary, The swallow's freedom wild, Cutting the wind on pinion never weary, Cleaving the clouds up-piled. And when the bird and his blithe mate beholding Abroad in airy race, Their evolutions filled my soul unfolding With images of grace. And, oh! what rapture, after wintry chidings, And April's smile and tear, Thrilled to the core my bosom at the tidings, âThe swallow, boy, is here!â Announcement of an angel on some mission Of love without alloy, Could not have sooner wakened a transition From gloom to heart-felt joy. For summer to the dreaming youth a heaven Of bliss and beauty seems, And in her sunshine less of earthly leaven Clings to our thoughts and dreams. In honor of the bird, with vain endeavor, Why lengthen out my lay? By Shakespeare's art he is embalmed forever, Enshrined in song by Gray. ADDRESS TO THE ORIOLE. Oriole, bright oriole! Stay, and that clear note prolong While each fibre of my soul Throbs in concert to thy song; Swell thy golden breast again, Pouring from thy little bill On the breeze a louder strainâ Linger still! linger still! I have tidings, bird, to tellâ Lovely shapes have turned to clay, Happy hearts have ceased to swell, Since thy wanderings far away; Bosoms glad a year ago Shouting joy no more can thrill, Darkly wedded unto woeâ Linger still! linger still! Since thy hammock swinging yet On you willow bough was made, Hope has seen her day-star set, Beauty frail her roses fade: Lusting for a laurel crown, Climbing glory's rugged hill, Beat has been ambition downâ Linger still! linger still! Love has mourned her perished flowers By the hearth of many a home, Since thy flight to tropic bowers Over ocean's tossing foam; Forms have through the door-way passed, Never more to cross the sill, That around a sunshine castâ Linger still! linger still! Change has been at work with meâ In my soul's unsounded deep, Chords that once were tuned to glee, Time to sterner measures keep; Friendship I have found a cheat, Fame a bubble on the rill, Happiness a phantom fleetâ Linger still! linger still! Hearts have cold and sordid grown That were generous of old; Nature has kept faith alone, Looking kindly as of old; And her envoy, bird, thou art, Heeding well her sovereign will; Oh! to cheer my saddened heart, Linger still! linger still! THE OWL. ââHark!âpeace! It was the owl that shrieked, the fatal bell-man Which gives the stern'st good night.â What bird, by the howl of the tempest unawed, In the gloom of a cold winter night is abroad? He quits his dim roost in some desolate dell, And skims like a ghost over meadow and fell. To break his long fast the red fox is a-foot, But pauses to hear a wild, ominous hoot, As, muffled in feathers, the hermit glides by, With a fiery gleam in his broad staring eye. By hunger the robber is driven away From haunts where in summer he hunted his prey; He banquets no more on the robin and wren, And the white-breasted dormouse is safe in his den. Hushed now in the farm-house are voices of mirth, And pale ashes cover the brand on its hearth; The windows are darkenedâno longer a-glow With lights that made ruddy the new-fallen snow. The barn of the farmer, wind-shaken and old, Is a favorite haunt of the plunderer bold; And thither, like phantom that flits in a dream, He hurries to perch on some dust-covered beam. The gloom of the place his keen vision explores, Both granary, hay-loft, and straw-littered floors, And merciless talons will capture and tear The poor little mice that abandon their lair. Sometimes on his perch, till the breaking of day, The lonely marauder of night will delay; And his globular orbs that see well in the dark, Sly foes on the walk are unable to mark. They spare notâfor plumage discovered at morn Nigh dove-cote and hen-house was bloody and torn; And, victim of false accusation, is slain The mouser that preyed on the robbers of grain. To kill I forebore, when a mischievous boy, Though lifted on high was my club to destroy; So bravely the creature received my attack, Fiercely snapping his bill, and with talons drawn back. Old tales of romance on my memory crowd, When Eve is abroad with her mantle of cloud, And dolorous notes, in the wilderness heard, The waking announce of night's favorite bird. I think of old abbeys and mouldering towers, And wrecks dimly seen through lone moon-lighted bowers, Where beasts of the desert resort for a lair, And howlet and bittern for shelter repair. The gray-feathered hermit would frighten of old Rude hinds overtaken by night in the wold, By hoary tradition, from infancy taught, That his screech with a fearful foreboding was fraught. His image flamed out on the terrible shield That Pallas up-bore when arrayed for the field; An emblem that Wisdom, when others are blind, Clear-sighted, a path through the darkness will find. When proud Idumea was cursed by her God, And brambles grew up where the mighty once trod; Owls, flapping their pinions in palaces wide, Raised a desolate scream of farewell to her pride. When shadows that slowly creep over the lea Call the feathered recluse from his hollow oak tree, That murder-scene oft to my sight is displayed By the Wizard of Avon so grandly portrayed. While drear shapes of horror are gibbering round, Guilt whispers, appalled,ââDid'st thou hear not a sound?â Then blood-curdling tones pierce the gloom in reply,â âI heard the owl scream, and the hearth-cricket cry!â Oh, vex not the bird! let him rule evermore, In a shadowy realm with antiquity hoar: Quaint rhyme he recalls that was sung by our nurse, And the masters of song weave his name in their verse. THE CUCKOO. FROM THE GERMAN. The cuckoo, among the Swiss shepherds, is supposed to pronounce its own name as many times as the individual hearing will live years. A damsel sat, one morning bright, On the green lap of May, And said:ââThe number of my years Tell, warbler, in thy lay.â An hundred times, with note the same, Pronounced the bird its own sweet name Cuckoo! cuckoo! cuckoo! cuckoo! Uprose the maid, perplexed to hear The bird's continued cry, And ran, directed by the sound, With anger in her eye; As she advanced the bird withdrew, Still gayly singing as it flew Cuckoo! cuckoo! cuckoo! cuckoo! Far through the wood in vainâin vain, The lovely maiden sped; Then, with a heated brow, began Her footsteps to retread:â The saucy bird, in turn, pursuedâ Once more the chase that maid renewed: Cuckoo! cuckoo! cuckoo! cuckoo! Aweary, on a fallen oak At length a seat she found, And cried:ââSing on, vexatious bird! I little heed the sound.â Scarce uttered were the words, when sprang From ambush her loved swain, and sangâ Cuckoo! cuckoo! cuckoo! cuckoo! THE MONTHS. INSCRIBED TO HORACE GREELEY. âFancy, with prophetic glance, Sees the teeming months advance.â T. Warton. The following brief poems on the Months present to the reader the somewhat discursive ideas of one who is an ardent lover of Nature in all her varied aspects, and whose mind delights to dwell upon the scenery of the beautiful country where he lives, but occasionally will wander from the mountain and the valley, the forest and the glade, to the busy scenes of life, and the pages of history. Each of the months is marked by its own distinctive features, clothed in its appropriate garb, and hallowed by the recollection of events which have occurred during its continuance. The year which came with the one closes with another. There is, in this constant, never-ending change, something congenial to the nature of man, stamped on everything around him. Were our skies forever of an azure blue, clear and unclouded, we should soon become wearied with the sameness of their aspect. Who would be doomed to gaze upon A sky without a cloud or sun? Did our magnificent lakes present an ever-placid and unruffled surface, unmoved by the wild winds' play, the beauty of the scenery in their vicinity would lose an essential constituent. Neither sunshine nor storm heat nor cold, verdure nor snow, can singly satisfy our ever-craving appetite for change. JANUARY. âHe lieth still: he doth not move: He will not see the dawn of day.â Tennyson. When, at the middle hour of night, Died, with a moan, the poor Old Year, A friar came, of orders white, And stretched the corse upon a bier: His scapulaire was thin and pale, And fashioned were the beads of hail That hung his neck around; Wild spirits of the creaking wood Of withered leaves had made his hood, With silver edging bound. Saint Januarius had heard The summons of a higher power, To don his stole with ermine furred, And chant at midnight's dreary hour. Long looked he on the slumberer old, With hand upon the temples cold, To which a hoar-frost clung; Then requiescat for the dead, Baring with reverence his head, The holy father sung. Rest, Traveller! the goal is gained! In Shadeland rest for evermore; Thy suns have set, thy moons have waned, Thine hours of bloom and blight are o'er: Dark was the twilight of thy days, No golden beams dispersed the haze, And Winter mocked thy sighs, While falling in the snow-drift downâ And sent his Norland blast to drown, With savage howl, thy cries. Rest, Pilgrim, rest! the burthen grew Too heavy for thy back to bearâ The glory that thy manhood knew Gave place to darkness and despair: The ticking note of falling snow Was little like the murmur low Of Summer's gentle rain; And, oh! unlike her roses lost Was the pale foliage by the frost Traced on the rattling pane. The pine, pyramidal of form, Though earth be drear, the tempest loud, Tints of the spring-time, green and warm, Discloses through its frosty shroud;â These, cheerily, a token gave That May's green banner yet would wave, Birds warble in the shade; But cheered not thy old, withered heart, For in Earth's history thy part Again could not be played. Thine errand hath been well performed, If nearer thou hast brought the time When hearts by love celestial warmed One creed maintain in every clime; When forts are levelled with the dust, Gun, blade, and lance, the prey of rust, And war-flags darkly furled; Drum, plume, and helm, are styled at last The mildewed lumber of the Pastâ Wrecks of a darkened world. Rest, Traveller! the goal is won, The cross of peace is on thy breast; Thy task of good and ill is done,â For evermore in Shadeland rest! Thy morn of blossoms passed away, Vanished thy blushing fruits, and gray Became thy golden hair; Why mourn for thee, Departed Year? In cloud and darkness thy career Closed, though it promised fair. The robin's hymn was wild and sweet Where harshly croaks the raven dark, And icy flails the meadow beat Where woke, at dawn, the lyric lark. Ah! frozen is the fount that gushed In music from the rock, and hushed The runnel's murmur low; Pale forms along the mountain sideâ Mad cavalry of Winter!âride Through whirling clouds of snow. Though newly-woven is thy pall, By midnight ghost thy knell just rung, Within a glittering palace hall Enthroned is thy successor youngâ Huzzas that hail the new-born king Make discord in the lay I sing, And much must be untoldâ With pale hands clasped upon thy breast, Rest, in the land of shadows, rest Forever, Pilgrim old! FEBRUARY. âCome when the rains Have glazed the snow, and clothed the trees with ice; When the slant sun of February pours Into the bowers a flood of light.â Bryant. Old churlish Winter's youngest child, Though here so boisterous and rude, In Egypt is PhamÃ¨noth styled, Or the fair moon that bringeth good: His name in Arabic is sweetâ Shasban, or month with hope replete, Forerunner of bright days; And Adar is his Jewish name, For then a purifying flame Flung far and wide its rays. Tired of confining walls, to-day I wandered through the woods alone, And rime that clung to bough and spray The richest jewelry outshone: The bitter-sweet, on trunks of eld, That lovingly its stalk upheld, Hung beads of coral bright; And tassels long, of rich brown hue, Upon the lowly alder grew, Refreshing to the sight. Cold, naked arms the swamp-ash spread, And bunches black its top that crowned Seemed mourning badges for the dead And shrivelled leaves that lay around: Dry flags the brooklet overhung, And frozen was its silver tongue, That erst so gently spoke; The linnet's torn, deserted nest, Once shadowed by her downy breast, A haunting sadness woke. North-eastwardly my glance I turned, And through disparting clouds of gray The moon, with argent ring, discerned, Though distant was the close of day: Dark thoughts, that wrapped my soul in night, Away by that enchanting sight, Like sun-lit mist, were drivenâ In presence of the silvery queen, More beauteous grew the barren scene, More fair the fields of heaven. A beech I spied, with mouldering heart, That still retained its withered leaves, Like some poor mother loth to part With the dead brood o'er which she grieves. Beneath my feet the crusted snow, Crackling, aroused from ambush low The partridge-hunted bird! And, loosened by a gleam of sun, Icicles falling, one by one, With tinkling sound, I heard. And other music was afloat, That gave my pulse a joyous thrill, For louder far than bugle note Rang bay of hound upon the hill: I caught a glimpse of wounded fox Steering his course toward friendly rocks That walled a neighboring glen; His blood soon dyed the fleecy drift, O'ertaken by pursuer swift, A bow-shot from his den. Where, girt by groves, a clearing spread, The stubble, like a darkening beard On the pale visage of the dead, Above the level snow appeared. While, breaking through the hazel brush, Quail rose, in coveys, with a rush Of short, quick-flapping wings; And, resting on its âfigure four,â I marked a trap, with straw roofed o'er, Set for the silly things. The forest, though disrobed and cold, And robbed of bird and singing rill, Is glorious with its columns old, And cheered by Beauty's presence still: Wild vines, to oak and elm that cling, Like cordage of a vessel swing, And rattle in the gale; And moss, that gives Decay a grace, The roughest spot on Nature's face Hides with adorning veil. When noontide throws a sudden glare On the pale scene, once brown with shade, Semblance the frosted hollows bear To cups of pearl with gold inlaid: Dazzling becomes the dreary waste, And bough and twig, with ice encased, Prismatic hues display; How changed the hills, all spangled o'er With flashing gems, that towered before So bleak, and stern, and gray! The hand of lusty March, ere long, Will February's ermine rend, And, with a gush of joyous song, Her way the blue-bird hither wend: Awakened by warm, pattering showers, The snowdrop will unclose its flowers, The violet upspring; And runnel, brook and waterfall, Once more, released from icy thrall, Their bells of silver ring. MARCH. âMarch hath unlocked stern Winter's chain.ââ Street. First of the vernal Triad, March, Blows, with distended cheek, his horn: Above, there is a clouded arch, Below, a landscape drear and lorn; Dull mists are creeping up the hill, Though the pale flag of Winter still Is on its top displayed; As yet no leaflet braves the cold, Though, here and there, the watery mould Sends up a grassy blade. The keen and frosty air that blew Howling across the brumal waste, Gave to the cheek a rosy hue, With lusty health each sinew braced; But the damp breath of opening Spring, Wafting distemper on its wing, Pierces the frame unstrung; A Reaper toils of ghastly brow, The tolling bell is busy now, Full many a dirge-note sung. Inconstant month! at times thy hand, Parting the curtains of the storm, Gives promise that the dreary land Will bask again in sunlight warm; Thy barbarous strain hath pauses brief, In which the heart derives relief From a low, gentle lay, Like the soft breathing of a flute, When harsher instruments are mute, Dying in air away. From many a sugar-camp upcurls Blue smoke above the maple boughs, And shouting boys and laughing girls Wild Echo from her covert rouse; The syrup, golden in its flow, Poured thickly on the hissing snow, Enchains their eager eyesâ The month of March is dear to them, Though, nodding lightly on the stem, No violets arise. Lakeward the swollen river rolls, Encroaching on its barren shore; The cry of lost, despairing souls Seems mingling with its awful roar; Huge ice-blocks, on its bosom borne, Asunder, with a crash, are torn, By ragged drift-wood smote; The swain beholds, in wild dismay, His stacks and fences swept awayâ His drowning flock afloat. The musk-rat from his reedy lair Is driven by the rising tide, For watcher keen a target fair, Who shoots him by the river side. Thus oft, with wave of wild mischance, Man battles, while the straining glance Is cheered by land ahead; And finds, though rude the surf, too late, Foes on the shore his landing wait More pitiless and dread. Though Winter was a tyrant stern, He boasted brighter hours than these; High did the roaring wood-fires burn, And loud were New Year revelries; The shout of boyhood filled our ears, And bridges, built on crystal piers, Rang as the skater passed; By hoary sire and grandam old Nightly around the hearth were told Tales of the dreamy past. A shadow on my heart is thrown By the deep gloom that wraps the scene; When will the blast forget to moanâ Earth wear again her mantle green? The brooks call on the flowers to rise, And paint their banks with varied dyes, But call, alas! in vain: Gray woods this mourning cry send forthâ âWhen will the singing birds come north, And cheer our depths again?â Oh, why repine! the fair and bright Are in the lap of darkness bornâ The tears of melancholy Night Are jewels in the crown of Morn; And March must wrestle with his foes, The genii dread of clouds and snows, Ere Nature's face is gay: Then honor to the warrior grim, For precious seeds are sown by him, Though turbulent his sway. APRIL. âWhen proud-pied April, dressed in al his trim, Hath put a spirit of youth in everything.â Shakespeare. A subtle masker is abroad, Attended by a merry band, Gemming with emerald the sod, And breathing fragrance through the land: Now, in a robe of blue and gold, He wraps his form of graceful mould, And whispersââI am May,â In tones of ravishmentâanon He puts more gloomy raiment on, A sterner part to play. By April of the sunny tress The mighty spell of death is broke, As marble, with a fond caress, To life the son of Belus woke; His magic flute of many keys Gives to the soft, enamored breeze Notes that recall the lostâ Plumed exiles far away that flew When brown the leaves of Autumn grew, Touched by a âkilling frost.â The black-bird chants, musician shrill, Perched lightly on some budding tree, And the blithe robin opes her bill, Flooding the grove with melody: The blue-bird carols on the wing, And in my frozen heart the spring Of joy wells up again; Yon lark, whose pulsing breast hath drawn Its color from the golden dawn, Whistles a cheerful strain. Buds of the maple, redly tinged, Are bursting in the naked wood, And passing clouds, with amber fringed, Drop diamonds on the dimpling flood: Moist mould, disturbed by spade or plough, A grateful smell is yielding now, In field and garden-close; Bright trout are leaping in the brook, And craftily his baited hook The silent angler throws. Few violets as yet adorn Glade, river-bank, and meadow-sod; But welcome to the wind of morn The daffodil and crocus nod: More gorgeous pets can June-time boast, But vernal flowers call up a host Of recollections dear, And fair, expanding hopes that die, Or dormant in the bosom lie, When older grows the year. While crimson with a quicker flow Is coursing through the veins of age, He deems the scroll of Long-Ago, Though blurred, a newly-written page. Gay Childhood, of the radiant brow, His maddest prank is playing nowâ Waking his wildest cry: No longer closeted with brooks, On wave and land the student looksâ Enchantment in his eye. The moonshine of an April night Is balsam to a fevered soul, And pastures, bathed in glimmering light, Invite me forth alone to stroll: Young herbage decorates the ground, And fall my feet without a sound Upon its tender green; Earth, late so desert-like, hath donned Vestments, in beauty far beyond The wardrobe of a queen. Light curtain-folds of hazy blue Hang, star-emblazoned in the sky, And far-off groves, that limit view, Tower with their silvery tops on high; The music of a ceaseless hymn That riseth from their cloisters dim, Quells the low plaint of Care; Voices, inaudible when Day, A babbler loud, holds gaudy sway, Float on the tides of air. Thrice welcome, April! Beauty sips One draught of thy refreshing wine, And song once more is on her lips, Bloom on her countenance divine: Retreating Winter vainly flings A snow-flake from his feeble wings To mar thy work of joy: The sports of Easter are thine own, When Manhood throws his burthen down, And personates the boy. Earth's Laureate Bard in other years, Warmed into being by thy breath, Drank from thy cup of sun-lit tears, And learned thy spell to conquer Death: The lights and shadows of thy face Upon his pictured leaves we trace, Thy humors quaint and wild; The Skeletons of Ruin heard His awful, vivifying word, And, like thy landscape, smiled. MAY. âOh, Maye, with all thy floures and thy grene, Right welcome be thou, fair, freshe Maye!â Chaucer. Airs from the clear south-west have borne A fairy hither on their wings, And pining grief forgets to mourn, Transported by the psalm she sings. Pale Want, in ragged, thin attire, Who found no faggot for his fire When howled the wintry storm, Quitting his desolate retreats, Looks forth, and with a blessing greets The sunlight free and warm. The deep, orchestral wood gives ear, Thrilled to its heart by joyous song, And in the laughing fields I hear Old voices that were silent long; In a rich suit of gold and black, The Oriole hath wandered back, To weave her hammock light; And the brown thrush, a mimic wild, For many weary moons exiled, From bough to bough takes flight. A sea of verdure overspreads The rushy banks of pond and cove, And wild flowers lift their jewelled heads, Frail, air-swung censors of the grove. Tall blue-bells, in my woodland walks, Nod gracefully their leafy stalks, In welcoming to me; With luscious wine, by Night distilled, Their cups to overflowing filled, Allure the gauze-winged bee. The rose-lipped shell on ocean's beach Hath less of beauty in its hue Than fragrant blossoms of the peach, That twinkle diamonded with dew; The cherry lifts its snowy crestâ In white the plum and pear are drest, Diffusing odor round; Detached, in orchards, by the breeze, The painted drapery of the trees Falls, carpeting the ground. Our sires thronged forth from cot and hall When, sooty and grotesque of look, Round May-poles, garlanded and tall, His bells the morris-dancer shook: By loyal hands a queen was crowned, And manly pastime labor found While cloth-yard shafts were drawn; With laughing sky and festal earth Comported well that scene of mirth Upon the daisied lawn. The merry-making games of old Unlocked the portals of the heart, And rarely man his honor sold For booty in the crowded mart; When Woe appealed to Wealth for food, He owned the tie of brotherhood, Giving without disdain; A generous valor warmed the soul Where love of country held control, Not low desire for gain. Capricious April sighed away His perfumed breath with closing eyes, And leaving crown and realm to May, Within a grave of beauty lies. Shelley, if living, would declare A tenement of rest so fair, Undarkened by a cloud, In love with death would wanderer make, And in his heart enamored wake A yearning for the shroud. Bright drops on floral cup and bell, When breaks the first fair morn of May, No longer, blest by fairy spell, Can charm the freckled mole away; But, ah! this season of delight Hath magic yet to make more bright The tombstone of the Past; And Memory âa-Mayingâ goes, Reviving many a withered rose, In gardens dim and vast. Called by the flowery Queen of Spring, Dispensing bliss without alloy, The sportive insect-tribes take wing, And Nature's holiday enjoy: Oh! not in gaudy trappings clad, Alone the proud and mighty glad At her bright court are made; Alike upon the great and small Her royal favors freely fallâ Her sunshine and her shade. Thou art the May of other hoursâ Undimmed thy locks of golden sheenâ And still, with dandelion flowers, Is starred thy plaid of living green; But time, alas! in me hath wrought Drear changes, both in form and thought, Since boyhood's blissful time, When, lulled by bird and running stream, I couched me on thy flowers, to dream Of Heaven's unshadowed clime.âThe birds, more joyous grown, Catch once again their silver summer tone, And they who late from bough to bough did creep, Now trim their plumes upon some sunny steep, And seem to sing of winter overthrown.â Barry Cornwall. Mingled with her tresses wearing Garlands wet with gentle showers, In her hand a sceptre bearing, Wreathed with radiant flowers, Pleasant May hath come, bestowing Soft, blue robes upon the sky, On broad vale and upland throwing Gifts of verdant dye. Lulling winds of Heaven are stealing Blossom-odor from the boughâ Every moment is revealing Some new beauty now: Housewife bees are swiftly flying Round young flowers in airy ringsâ Insects, newly born, are trying In the sun their wings. Welcome May! yon elm is waving Regally his leafy crestâ Tinkling streams are lightly laving Banks in verdure drest. While the robin plaits his dwelling In the green depths of the wood, Birds are in the sunlight swelling, Fresh, and many-hued. Airless room and sofa leaving, I will roam with idle tread, Where the stirring grove is weaving Broad roofs overhead; Or, beneath some tall beach sitting, Rooted in the virgin mould, Read, while birds are near me flitting, Thrilling tales of old. JUNE. âNow have green April and the blue-eyed May Vanished awhile; and lo! the glorious June (While Nature ripens in his burning noon) Comes like a young inheritor.â Barry Cornwall. Armida's garden, ever bright, And odorous with enchanted flowers, Was not more rich in bloom and light Than now is this fair world of ours, While June floats on the melting air, With rose-buds in his lustrous hair, Above the grave of Spring;â On high the fleecy clouds are piled, And round him, with a twitter wild, Dart swallows on the wing. Where spreads the meadow, broad and long, Its velvet to the river's brink, There is a rivalry in song Between the lark and bobolink; While sunny skies drop golden rain, The former pours a fife-like strain From her expanding throatâ The latter, on some grassy spire, Rocks to and froâa feathered lyre Of full, voluptuous note. Gay, voiceful things, in every hue That paints the braided rainbow clad, And over-fed with honey-dew, Dart by, deliriously glad; An elfin crowd are hither drawn, And mourning grasps King Oberon A dimmed and broken wand. For youthful June hath made the face Of Earth a sweeter dwelling-place Than even Fairy Land. Vans, richly striped, young butterflies, Perched on the flowers, expand and close, And humble-bees, with waxen thighs, Pay noisy visits to the rose: Urns that the wine of morning hold Lure, clothed in purple, green and gold, The restless humming-bird,â An opal flashing in the light, Compared with hues that deck the sprite, Would dull appear and blurred. Laburnums, by the zephyr wooed, Their yellow ringlets lightly shake, And, types of graceful maidenhood, Tall lilies from their slumber wake, Kissing each other, while they fling Elysian fragrance forth, and swing Upon their flexile stalks; Syringas rustle, draped with snow, And peonies with purple strew The level garden walks. St. John's charmed eve was hailed of yore With feast and dance in England old, But down the verdant slope no more The redly-blazing wheel is rolled; No more the dewy moonlit glade Is visited by love-lorn maid, For plant of magic power, That, placed beneath her pillowed head, Would waken dreams of woe and dread, Or the glad nuptial hour. When Tyrian dyes no longer paint The cloudy portals of the West, The whippowill begins her plaint With swelling neck and throbbing breast; Each note of Night's mysterious bird By listener, far away, is heard Sad as the dirge of Joy: Or cry by pale ÃnÃ²ne raised, Hunting, while stars on Ida gazed, For her Dardanian boy. When hushed the robin's vesper song, By moonlight to the woods I hie, Then couch me down, and listen long To voices that go wandering by; Wind, wave, and leaf, in concert blend, And tones, by day unheard, ascend From glen and mossy floor; That wondrous music, soft and low, Heard by the son of Prospero, Would not enchant me more. A yearning in the heart awakes From human neighborhood to flee, And tread the shores of breezy lakes, Or climb the hills, a rover free; âAway!â a voice upon me callsâ âThy cheek its color from the walls That hem thee in, hath caught; Go forth! and on thy troubled brain Will, angel-like, descend again The holy calm of thought.â Oh, June! with thee return no more The feelings of my boyhood wild; Earth, then, a brighter vesture wore, More graciously the morning smiled; The ruddy strawberries of old Drew flavor from a richer mould Than those I gather now; More kindly dew by night was showered, And swathed in deeper azure towered The mountain's piny brow. âMan changes with the lapse of yearsââ A low, rebuking voice repliesâ âHe hears, at length, with other ears, And sees, alas! with other eyes. Back comes young Summer with the glow That flushed her features long ago, And Nature still is true; But hopes that charmed thy youth are deadâ The sunshine of thy heart is fled, Its innocency too.â The violet peeps from its emerald bed, And rivals the azure, in hue, overheadâ To the breeze sweeping by on invisible wings Its gift of rich odor the young lily flings, And the silvery brook in the greenwood is heard, Sweetly blending its tones with the song of the bird. The swallow is dipping his wing in the tide, And the aspect of earth is to grief unallied; Ripe fruit blushes now on the strawberry vine, And the trees of the woodland their arms intertwine, Forming shields which the sun pierceth not with his rayâ Screening delicate plants from the broad eye of day. Oft forsaking the haunts and the dwellings of men, I have sought out the depths of the forest and glen, And the presence of June making vocal each bough, Would drive the dark shadow of care from my brow: The rustling of leaves, the blythe hum of the bee, Than the music of viols is sweeter to me. When the rose bends with dew on her emerald throne, And the wren to her perch in the forest hath flown; When the musical thrush is asleep on the nest, And the red bird is in her light hammock at rest; When sunlight no longer gilds streamlet and hill, Is heard thy sad anthem, forlorn whippowill! The Indian, as twilight was fading away, Would start when his ear caught thy sorrowful lay, And supposing thy note the precursor of woe, Would arm for the sudden approach of the foeâ But I list to thy wild, fitful hymn with delight, When the pale stars are winking, lone minstrel of night! Brightest month of the year! when thy chaplet grows pale, I shall mourn, for the bearer of health is thy gale; The pearl that young Beauty weaves in her dark hair, In clearness cannot with thy waters compareâ Nor yet can the ruby or amethyst vie With the tint of thy rose or the hue of thy sky. JULY Thrice happy he! who on the sunless side Of a romantic mountain, forest crowned, Beneath the whole collected shade reclines.â Thompson. Thronged yesterday the young and old, With a deep murmur like the main Ten thousand banners were unrolled, And trumpets woke a martial strain: While cannon flashed their reddening fires, And clangor came from trembling spires, Glad ears the signal caught: The scythe hung idly on the tree, For a great day of jubilee The Julian month had brought. Woe to a country when the weeds Grow darkly on its altar-hearth, And fade from memory the deeds Of men who woke the sleep of Earth! Cementing in the battle storm, With their best blood, the blocks that form A dome where millions meetâ A stately dome of many doors, To all unfolded, and whose floors Are trod by chainless feet. What pictures to poetic eye More beauteous than these wood-girt glades, Fields full of oats and bearded rye, And dark green corn with flaunting blades? Warm airs, in dalliance with the wheat, Awaken murmurs low and sweet, And sturdy reapers swing Light cradles now on hill and plain, And from their finger-points the grain With measured motion fling. When noon pours down his fiercest ray, And seems a-blaze the gliding rill, The bird sits panting on the spray, With lifted wing and open bill; Upon the meadow's grassy floor, Beneath old oaksâtheir dinner o'erâ Hay-making groups recline; From sunny grass-lands to the cool, Dark waters of the shaded pool Wend slow the weary kine. Ere thunder shakes the solid land, And the big drops drench hill and vale, Herds in the withering pasture stand, With necks outstretched, and snuff the gale; Changed in a moment is the sky From azure of the deepest dye To gloomy, funeral black; And the broad mirror of the stream Blinds with its brightness, while the gleam Of lightning it gives back. When over is the pleasant shower The birds a song of transport wake, And diamonds, in the sheltering bower From their oiled plumage blithely shake: Earth laughs, endowed with newer life, And subtle airs, with fragrance rife, Lift the damp, whispering leaves; And briskly, now, in fields of grain, Toils, with a youthful band, the swain To dry the dripping sheaves. The choking summer-dust that made The faint, wayfaring crowd complain, Is like an evil spirit laid By music of the pattering rain; Thus often, in a feverish dream, Tones, like the murmur of a stream, Ill-boding forms disperse; And deserts, hot and parched before, Transformed to fruitful fields, no more Tell of a blighting curse. Stained with the ruddy hue of blood, Young berry hunters may be seen Bearing full baskets from the wood, With brake-leaf covers fresh and green; And when the magic afternoon Of Saturday, that ends too soon, Depopulates the school, Go forth a throng of urchins brave, Shouting their joy, to breast the wave In pond or dimpling pool. When Day, aweary, on the breast Of gentle Eve a pillow finds, Lulled into soft, voluptuous rest By rippling waves and voiceful winds; Small fire-flies darting to and fro, Bespangle leaves and meadows low, And the moon, rising, fills The calm blue vault of Heaven with light, And dim and vapory forms take flight From the high Eastern hills. Month of heroic thoughts, July! I love thy hot, embrowning rayâ The fleecy cloudlets of thy sky, The gorgeous ending of thy day: Well art thou named!âfor did not HE Derive his force and fire from thee Whose legions tamed the world? Flamed in his glance thy levin red, Tuned by thy thunder was his tread, With Rome's old flag unfurled. Black clouds, that interweave a pall To hide, at noon, thy burning sun, His star, in darkness plunged, recall, When Glory's pinnacle was won: Millions, at his eclipse, grew pale, Like shuddering children when a veil Is drawn thy brightness o'erâ But ah! unlike his timeless doom, Thine orb emerges from the gloomâ Flashed out his star no more. AUGUST. âA power is on the earth and in the air From which the vital spirit shrinks afraid.â Bryant. Dust to the robe of August clings; A hazy belt the mountain zones, And gushing from the golden strings Of Summer's harp, come mournful tones: The meadow wears a withered look, And the low channel of the brook Is paved with pebbles dryâ Kissed by the purling wave no more, They catch a gleam like silver ore, But dull and darkened lie. Through lanes where boughs meet overheadâ That deep into the greenwood pierce, I often stroll, with vagrant tread, Well shielded from the noontide fierce; To places where a deeper rut Yawns, by the groaning cart-wheel cut, Beneath o'er-browing hill, Flock butterflies, bedropped with gold, Alighting on the black, rich mould, Indued with moisture still. Fields wear a wan and sickly hue, And farmers of the drought complain For rain-streaks, on the faded blue Of arching skies, they look in vain; Thrice happy now is he who dwells Where the great heart of Ocean swells, And far away the land, By winds that quit their hollow caves, Drinking refreshment from the waves, Is into coolness fanned. Perched on the skeletons of trees, That in the grainy stubble rear Dry tops, that wave not in the breeze, Wild pigeons watch a flutterer near; Decoyed, at last, upon the ground, They settle with a roaring sound, And o'er them flies the net, While sportsmen, in a house of boughs, From hushed, recumbent posture rouse, And weariness forget. Where openings in the forest hall Give passage to the ripening blaze, Umbrella-shaped, the mandrake tall Its lemon-tinted fruit displays: Bee-hunters are abroad to line Black swarms to hollow oak or pine, With box and amber comb; A laughing band their baskets fill With whortleberries on the hill, Then seek their village home. Green clusters of the wilding grape, Climber of oaks! hang high in air, And seedy fruit, of oblong shape, The rough blackberry bushes bear; The rank cohosh wears snowy plumes, The peppermint obscurely blooms In hollows dark and wet; Red beads the wintergreen adorn, And apples of the spreading thorn Will turn to rubies yet. The maize-leaf in the sunshine curls, The clover-tops are brown and dead, And spindle fine the locust twirls Amid the leaves above my head; By sunny fence, or wall, are seen Grasshoppers in gay coats of green, Clouding the sod in flight; Webs in the pasture closely cropped Seem flags by elvish warriors dropped When trooping by at night. At twilight I behold aloft, While rambling with enamored eye, A flush more delicately soft Than coral, steal across the sky; Low whispers from the river-vale Go up, as if a dreary wail The Water Spirits made, For dying waves that faintly creep O'er greenish stones to reach the deep, Through which a child might wade. Deep furrows in the bank denote Paths traced by tributary streams, When pines, adrift, the bridges smote, Rending stone arch and massive beams: Plants edge the marge, in withering groups, And the parched willow vainly stoops To bathe its pensile bough; The plash of leaping fish, and stroke Of dipping oar, that Echo woke, Are heard no longer now. The music of an August eve Unlocks the fount of pensive thought, And breathes of Beauty taking leave In tones with melting sweetness fraught: Far in the mossy forest, stirred By the low wind, are voices heard Consorting with its gloom; They tell of Summer on the wane, And flowers that thirst for dew in vain Around her opening tomb. Lured by a swarm of buzzing flies, That round my lamp disport at night, Darts in the bat, with beaded eyes, Flapping his leathern wing in flight; In June no shafts of purer glow Shot Dian from her silver bow, When hushed the âbabbling day,â Than those that, in her radiant course, Now to my vine-hung casement force Through kindling leaves their way. Not long, dry month of potent heat! Will Earth beneath thy glance grow sereâ A wight, with golden-slippered feet And jolly face, is drawing near: Fruits manifold, a painted crop, Before his honeyed breath will drop, Andâtransformation strange!â Fields, for the velvet green of May, The yellow livery of decay Will joyfully exchange. Heart of the Poet!âtrembling thing!â When Passion builds his burning shrine, And dreams of innocence take wing, A melancholy drought is thine; Founts waste away, that flung a shower Of trembling pearls on leaf and flower, Wrapped in a fiery shroud; On Beauty's grave are ashes piled, And dead the lark of Fancy wild Drops from her bower of cloud. When ends the Summer of my days, Oh! may thy lilies, Peace, remain! And, shrivelled by Ambition's blaze No longer, feel Love's dropping rain! As fresh, once more, the landscape grows, When hence consuming August goes, And Autumn comes to lave With cooling drops the weary land, Bronzed by the Tyrant's flaming wand, And laugh wood, wind, and wave. SEPTEMBER. âThe sultry Summer past, September comes, Soft twilight of the slow-declining year.â Carlos Wilcox. âMonth of my heartââSeptember mild! Thy transient reign is passing bright; The vine-hung temple of the wild Is streaked with golden light: Insects are singing in the grass, And as with loitering step I pass, Shy pigeons greet my view, Robbing the fragrant sassafras Of berries darkly blue. Lifting their cups to drink the showers, And nodding in the southern breeze, Still a gay family of flowers Are haunted by the bees: Glove the Gerardia displays, Tinged like the sunset's richest blaze; And near my path behold The beauteous Solidago raise Its feathery stalk of gold. Nigh mouldering logs, with moss o'erspread, Gleam the striped Arum's coral beads, And brake-stems, shaken by my tread, Drop their round, clustering seeds: I mark the Gentian's azure eye, And berries of a crimson dye That grace the Boxwood's crown, And, shooting from the marsh on high, The Typha's Catkin brown. On a few children of the shade That pale, fantastic painterâFrostâ Warm colors with cold hand hath laid, Though not a leaf is lost: Blood-drops may, here and there, be seen On the low Sumach's vest of green, As if its heart had bled, And, where tall maples form a screen, The grove is growing red. Clusters of white and purple now Deck garden-wall and trellis green, And ripe to bursting, on the bough The luscious peach is seen: Sunset hath flushed its velvet cheeks, And delicate vermilion streaks Adorn the juicy pear: Birds dart about with pecking beaksâ The wasp finds dainty fare. Across the darkly furrowed plain The sower moves with even stride, And gracefully a bag of grain Is swinging at his side: A hungry pigeon flock take heed, While far abroad the precious seed Streams whitening from his hand; Soon will they flutter down, and feed, A bold, rapacious band. The spider's beating clock I hear, The meadow cricket blows his pipe, And rising from the marsh, in fear Whirrs by, the whistling snipe: A listener to the rustling sound My foot wakes in dry stubble ground, Away the field-mouse springs; The wheeling hawk sends out a scream, While sunlight edges with a gleam Of amber light his wings. A clearing I have reached at last, Green with a robe of sprouting wheat, And rambling glance below I cast On calm Autangua's circling sheet: Touched by the day's departing beams, Lo! like a brooch of gold it gleams Upon the valley's breast! Cheered by no fairer sight are dreams Of a sweet child at rest. Yon mower, while the buckwheat falls In reddish swaths, his task to cheer, Some rude old ballad strain recalls That well I love to hear: The squirrel, frighted by his song, A neighboring cornfield's edge along Races in wild dismay, And startled crows, a noisy throng, Fly through the woods away. Old pastures, seamed by paths of sheep, Fresh from the baths of gentle showers, Are rivalling the verdure deep Of May's enchanted hours:â The mushroom lifts its roof of snow, With roseate hangings draped below, Ten meet for fairy folk! And while his boughs wave to and fro, Fall acorns from the oak. Huge wains, piled high with yellow maize, Groan as their wheels cut through the soil, And the blithe hunter homeward strays, Bearing his feathered spoil; With mist the distant hills are crowned, And winds, in passing, waft a sound, Pleasant to Boyhood's ear, Of ripe fruit falling to the ground In orchards planted near. Month of my heart!âSeptember bland! When radiant Summer breathed her last, She placed a sceptre in thy hand, Her robe around thee cast: That sceptre soon will broken be, That bright robe cease to cover thee, For God the wide Earth made A scroll inscribed with this decreeâ âThy loveliest things must fade!â OCTOBER. âWhat is there saddening in the autumn leaves? Have they that âgreen and yellow melancholyâ That the sweet poet spake of?â Brainerd. The tenth one of a royal line Breathes on the wind his mandate loud, And fitful gleams of sunlight shine Around his throne of cloud: The Genii of the forest dim A many-colored robe for him Of fallen leaves have wrought; And softened is his visage grim By melancholy thought. No joyous birds his coming hail, For Summer's full-voiced choir is gone, And over Nature's face a veil Of dull, gray mist is drawn: The crow, with heavy pinion-strokes Beats the chill air in flight, and croaks A dreary song of dole: Beneath my feet the puff-ball smokes As through the fields I stroll. An awning broad of many dyes Above me bends, as on I stray, More splendid than Italian skies Bright with the death of day; As in the sun-bow's radiant braid Shade melts like magic into shade, And purple, green, and gold, With carmine blent, have gorgeous made October's flag unrolled. The partridge, closely ambushed, hears The crackling leafâpoor, timid thing! And to a thicker covert steers On swift, resounding wing: The woodland wears a look forlorn, Hushed is the wild bee's tiny horn, The cricket's bugle shrillâ Sadly is Autumn's mantle torn, But fair to vision still. Black walnuts, in low, meadow ground Are dropping now their dark, green balls, And on the ridge, with rattling sound, The deep brown chestnut falls. When comes a day of sunshine mild, From childhood, nutting in the wild, Outbursts a shout of glee; And high the pointed shells are piled Under the hickory tree. Bright flowers yet linger:âfrom the morn Yon Cardinal hath caught its blush, And yellow, star-shaped gems adorn The wild witch-hazel bush; Rocked by the frosty breath of Night, That brings to frailer blossoms blight, The germs of fruit they bear, That, living on through Winter white, Ripens in Summer air. The varied aster tribes unclose Bright eyes in Autumn's smoky bower, And azure cup the gentian shows, A modest little flower: Their garden sisters pale have turned, Though late the dahlia I discerned Right royally arrayed: And phlox, whose leaf with crimson burned Like cheek of bashful maid. In piles around the cider-mill The parti-colored apples shine, And busy hands the hopper fill While foams the pumice fineâ The cheese, with yellow straw between Full, juicy layers, may be seen, And rills of amber hue Feed a vast tub, made tight and clean, While turns the groaning screw. From wheat-fields, washed by recent rains, In flocks the whistling plover rise When night draws near, and leaden stains Obscure the western skies: The geese, so orderly of late, Fly over fence and farm-yard gate, As if the welkin black The habits of a wilder state To memory brought back. Yon streamlet to the woods around, Sings, flowing on, a mournful tune, Oh! how unlike the joyous sound Wherewith it welcomed June! Wasting away with grief, it seems, For flowers that flaunted in the beams Of many a sun-bright dayâ Fair flowers!âmore beautiful than dreams When life hath reached its May. Though wild, mischievous sprites of air, In cruel mockery of a crown, Drop on October's brow of care Dead wreaths and foliage brown, Abroad the sun will look again, Rejoicing in his blue domain, And prodigal of gold, Ere dark November's sullen reign Gild stream and forest old. Called by the west wind from her grave, Once more will summer re-appear, And gladden with a merry stave The wan, departing year; Her swiftest messenger will stay The wild bird winging south its way And night, no longer sad, Will emulate the blaze of day, In cloudless moonshine clad. The scene will smoky vestments wear, As if glad Earthâone altar madeâ By clouding the delicious air With fragrant fumes, displayed A sense of gratitude for warm, Enchanting weather after storm, And raindrops falling fast, On dead September's mouldering form, From skies with gloom o'ercast. NOVEMBER. âWhen chill November's surly blast Made fields and forests bare.â Burns. Hoarse trumpeters are in the sky, From which a dripping rain is shedâ Onward in wedge-like form they fly, By leader piloted: A flourish of the feathered band Announces that they seek a land Of sunniness and flowersâ Blue waters, edged by golden sand, Flashing through tropic bowers. Erewhile the Frost-King's brush arrayed In magic hues the rustling bough, But colors of a darker shade Are on his palette now; Well may the artist, in despair, His leaf-inwoven canvas tear, And deem his work accursedâ His latest pictures ill compare With those he painted first. From the cold stubble-field ascends The lonely whistle of the quail; And mournfully the forest bends Its brown top, in the gale, From which no leafy banner streamsâ Its unroofed fane by passing gleams Of sunshine is uncheered; Each trunk memorial-pillar seems On Beauty's grave upreared. The forest-trees that shook of late, Their many-tinted flags in air, Disrobed, and in a crownless state, Distinctive features wear: Like a crazed maiden in her woe, Swinging her thin arms to and fro, The wind-swept willow mark! While mist creeps o'er the meadows low, And clouds, above, grow dark. How pleadingly yon Poplar stands, Wan trembler in the dismal wood: Like some poor wretch, with up-flung hands, Spurned by oppressor rude; The Elm, aside his helmet cast, Looks like a warrior, quelled at last, Who courts the deadly strokeâ Bold wrestler with the surly blast, Towers, athlete-like, the Oak! November of forbidding mien Is busy by the wood and rill, Changing to russet aught of green, Or bright, found lingering still: He treads in wrath the forest-floor And dead leaves fly his breath before, And creaking sounds are heard, Mingled with sobbing, and the roar Of waves to madness stirred. As if he wished to travel far From our cold clime, the King of Day Guides southward his beclouded car, And welcomes Evening gray: Like friends that quit, in adverse hour, The builder of their pomp and power, His rose-cheeked clouds have fled; A gloomy troop, with brows that lower, Are flocking round instead. Strange beauty fell on hill and dale When gentle Indian Summer came Disclosing, through a filmy veil, A crown of ruddy flame: She reddened with her touch the rill; Festooning purple on the hill Her magic fingers hungâ Through Nature sent a joyous thrill, And tuned her harp unstrung. Oh! brief and dream-like was her stay! A harsh, discordant voice went forth, Driving the lovely nymph away, From the chill, darkened North: Robbed of its lining, soft and blue, The welkin wore a leaden hue, The fields a shading brownâ Wild bird and bee from sight withdrew, And blinding sleet came down. A tyrant comes, November drear! In twain thy mace of power to rend, And on a pale, wind-shaken bier Thy frozen form extend; He will insult thy stiff remains By loading them with icy chains, Oh! spectacle forlorn! Then, while the wide old wood complains, Sound his dismaying horn! Sunshine glimmers on the hill, Lighting up its rugged brow, Though the warbling birds are still, And the leaves have left the bough. Brightness on the brook is shed, Like soft gleam of golden ore, Though the water-flags are dead, And the marge is green no more. Thus the good of earth, when age Warps the form and thins the hair, And the brow becomes a page Wrinkled with the lines of care, Smile, amid decay and blight, Gently, like the dying year, Though a long and gloomy night, And a wintry grave, are near. On the perish'd grass and flowers Patters now the blinding hail, And, through cold and naked bowers, Howls the loud November gale. Fleet as swallows on the wing Fly abroad the shrivel'd leaves; And the oak, a crownless thing, Rocks and moans like one who grieves. Thus, when pomp and power have fled From the proudâthe wrong'dâthe great, On his bare, unshielded head Beats the wrathful storm of Fate. Friends of yesterday pass by, Like the Pharisee of old; And above him bends a sky Frowning, dark, unsunn'd and cold. DECEMBER. âDecember came;âhis aspect stern Glared deadly o'er the mountain cairn; A polar sheet was round him flung, And ice-spears at his girdle hung.â Ettrick Shepherd. Those snowy plumes become thee well, Thou of the frost-embroidered mail! Thy clarion hath a martial swellâ Last of the Twelve, all hail! Thy savage couriers hither post, And sounds I hear, as if a host Were marching to the fight, Or Ocean, on an iron coast, Broke in his bellowing might. The battle hath been fought and won, And clouds, unlit by streaks of light, The vanquished forces of the sun Have covered in their flight; Thy squadrons, of their triumph proud, Make music, riotous and loud, Among the windy hills, Whose piny summits wear a shroud Hiding the frozen rills. When camest thou in other years, And wooded was the scene around, In rude log huts the Pioneers A crazy shelter found: While rafters rang with Winter's knock, Wild bleatings of the folded flock Their waking guardians told That wolves, from swamp and caverned rock, Rushed forth, by Night made bold. âOur boy comes not!ââonce rose the cry Of a scared wife;ââAwakeâarouse!â Thus summoned, with a flashing eye, Up-leaped her hardy spouse; Snatching his musket from the wall, Charged with buck-shot and deadly ball, Though louder howled the pack, He sallied out, while rang the fall Of feet upon his track. Oh, watching mother! never more Returned in life thy luckless child; Fierce monsters held a revel o'er His carcase in the wild: Though hungry still, a frantic sire Dispersed them in his dreadful ire, And carried through the storm, In arms that toil had strung with wire, Homeward a bleeding form. Forget not perils sternly braved, And hardships borne by men of oldâ Their sweat bedewed, their blood-drops laved, The dark, rich forest mould; They won for us the gifts we prizeâ These fields so beauteous to our eyes! And bitter waters quaffed, That weâoh! matchless enterprise! Might taste a sweeter draught. Bay on a victor's forehead placedâ What is it to their true renown? The former but a phantom chased, Treading Earth's brightness down; The latter, into landscapes bright Changing the vast domain of Night, Have scattered golden grain; And formed, with rugged hands, a site For Learning's hallowed fane. Turn we, December, from the scene Thy glance beheld in other days, While milder grows thy warlike mien, And high the fagots blaze: Home hath a brightâa magic ring, That, crossed, disarms thy wrath, oh, King! Enwreathing with a smile, Soft as the look of youthful Spring, Thy bearded lip the while. List! Despot, in thy gentler mood, While a few chiding words I speak; Why vex with treatment harsh and rude, The friendless and the weak? Enough that man denies them breadâ Enough that no protecting shed Bars out the freezing gale! Why on the fallen basely tread, A wight, in rags, assail? The hunger-smitten orphan prayed For mercy, at thy hands, in vainâ His head upon thy snow-wreath laid, And never woke again; It was a kindly act, I own! To hush a famished infant's moan That to its mother clung, While winds, that chilled her heart to stone, A white cloak o'er her flung. Why load with ills complaining Woe, And add to Pain another pang? Why let the beaten feel thy blow, The bitten heart thy fang? Why not a stinging lash apply To wretches holding revel high, Though Want a crumb implores, And houseless, hopeless Misery Lies sobbing at their doors? Thou lovest for the rich and strong, Gay, glittering pathways to prepare, While jingling bell and cracking thong Their merriment declare; And it is well that man should hear Such notes the brumal desert cheer; But in thine hour of ire Spare a pale crowd, in places drear, Begging for food and fire. The poor Old Year from thee receives Rough usage in his dying hour; Thus ever, when Misfortune grieves, Is raised the scourge of Power; Thy cruel minionsâHail and Sleetâ Enfold him in a winding sheet, And laugh at his dismay, Then shoutââNot far those tottering feet Will bear thee on thy way!â Old Father ChristmasâKing of Storms!â Is chaplain to thy noisy train; He loves a cordial glass that warms, And chants a jolly strain; His silver hair and rosy face Give to his time-worn form a grace, And children, with a bound, Flock to enjoy his kind embrace, While toys are scattered round. He tells a tale of other times, Each wild imp dancing on his knees, Or loudly singing quaint old rhymes, His auditory please; Sad are full many little hearts When, taking up his staff, departs The venerable sage, Whose glance a beam benignant darts, Lending a charm to age.

      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. OCCASIONAL POEMS. THE IDEAL. INSCRIBED TO MY FRIEND O. H. MARSHALL, OF BUFFALO, N. Y. âSweet Phantasy alone is young forever.ââ Schiller. Vast are thy radiant halls, Imagination! And through them who loves not, at times, to walk, While airs are breathed like those at Earth's Creation, And silvery voices talk. And it is well that manâawhile retiring From the dim outward worldâin blissful dreams Walk through those halls, a purer air respiring, And catch elysian gleams. There, with his sickle idle and rust-eaten, Sleeps the pale Mower of our mortal joys; And amber drops of purest nectar sweeten A cup that never cloys. There, with the loved and lost again uniting, Can we discourse serenely of the past, Couched upon roses that no worm is blighting, Or killing northern blast. There will the child we laid in earth, to meet us In wild delight stretch forth its little armsâ There will the mother, that we mourned for, greet usâ Renewed her youthful charms. There will the bride who woke our young affection Blush as if still she heard the marriage bell; Ah! nevermore, with look of deep dejection, To falter out farewell! Is the poor Bard repaid for years of trial, And vigils that untimely bow the frameâ For tears in secret shed, and self-denial, By the green wreath of fame? Is gold a fitting recompense for sorrow That fixes ever in his breast a dart, While hopes that bud, to wither on the morrow, Leave canker in the heart? Oh, no! the grudging world can grant no guerdon Prized like the sunshine of those happy hours, When fate permits him to throw down his burden, And pluck unwithering flowers! Permits him through the gate of dreams to wander, And look on scenes that painter never drew, While in his throbbing, yearning soul grows stronger Love for the good and true; Permits him to hold glorious communion, With mighty spirits who have done with time, Bound by a league, to never know disunion, In brotherhood sublim Back! back for him, the past withdraws its curtain, And round him throng old sovereign-lords of mind, Not seen like objects through a haze uncertainâ Each figure well defined. Lo! he beholds some mighty truth enforcing, Or gracing with rich imagery his theme, Great Plato walk through fairer groves, discoursing, Than those of Academe. That Greek arrests his glance who talked with ocean Until its awful bass was in his tone, And sweet-voiced Tully skilled to draw emotion From hearts, inert like stone. Paths, paved with pearl and diamond, he may follow, Through blooming meadows to a temple grandâ Home of a priesthood who have served Apollo In every age and land. Through the stained glass darts tempered light, bestowing A blush on pictured walls and spangled floorsâ And rivers of rich melody are flowing For ever from its doors. The crowning pride of Hellas, blind and hoary, Before him rears his tall, majestic form, Surrounded by inheritors of glory, And breathes a welcome warm. Tones of the old, Hellenic spirit tremble On the proud strings of his heroic lyre, While o'er him charmed divinities assemble In chariots of fire. A crowd of lesser minstrels borrow lustre From the full splendor of that epic orb, As snowy clouds that round the day-god cluster, His blaze in part absorb. In pauses of the mighty strain he listens To Doric reed and Lesbian lute forlorn, Till in his eye, enlarged with wonder, glistens A tear of rapture born. The courtly Virgil, model of politeness! He marks near Flaccus of the rosy face, While Pindar comes, with eye of eagle brightness, Fresh from the chariot race. The naiad watches by her silver fountainâ The dryad in the shade of aged trees, And, darting through green pines upon the mountain, The oread he sees. Milton, divinely beautiful, upraising His speaking face receives a heavenly glow, And, grandly stern, the Tuscan downward gazing, Pierces the depths of woe. Calm Shakespeare towers with regal wand controlling Broad seas of thought, wild passion and romance, As Dian sways the pulse of ocean rolling With her benignant glance. And at his feet a youthful form reclining Wears the pale front of Bristol's wondrous boy; His face, so mournful when with hunger pining, Changed into lark-like joy. Apart the lord of Newstead pours the billows Of his tremendous song upon the gale, While star-eyed Shelley, propped by golden pillows, Bids dream-land lift the veil. In the great concert Celtic bards are singing, Drest in the garb that wizard Merlin wore, And, wild and high, the Cambrian Harp is ringing Above the torrent's roar. The Minnesinger's chant, alive with feeling, Wafts gently by the notes of breeze and bird, And in rude lays, that Gothic scalds are pealing, The trampling surf is heard. Fair shapes from vine-wreathed balconies are leaning While sweeps the troubadour his lute below, And silenced not by ages intervening, Druidic numbers flow. Through halls, with hangings like the rainbow braided, A group of famous women glide along; The mighty spell that keeps their bloom unfaded, Is the glad work of song. That Cretan lady, on the beach forsaken By Athen's lord, is still divinely fair; No leaflet from her rose of beauty shaken By woe and black despair. Aspasia, with a brow by genius lighted, Flits by with that immortal child of song Who buried in the sea, by Phaon slighted, All memory of wrong. Young Hero, rescued from the caves of ocean, Walks with her own Leander by her side; Well-won reward of faith and fond devotion, Alas! too rudely tried! Forgetful of the Roman's mad caresses, Stalks grandly by old Egypt's wanton queen, With jewels flashing in her night-black tresses, Full bust and royal mien. With a strange lustre in her dark eye playing, Prophetic lip, clasped hands, and hair unbound, In thought Cassandra, back to Phrygia straying, Beholds her sire uncrown'd: And near a radiant and majestic creature, Whose deadly charms the towers of Troy brought low, Moves, with a winning grace in every feature, And mouth like Cupid's bow; And higher natures, holy hearts enshrining The noblest deeds by woman done recall; Pure as the morn on young creation shining Before the primal fall, Rose Standish fairer than a star new risen, Sweet, early martyr of our western wild! Leads by the hand, escaped from death's chill prison, Powhatan's dusky child; And giving sign of more than mortal vigor, Awoke to breathing life from ashes pale, The Maid of France appearsâa martial figure In knighthood's glittering mail. Realm of the vast Ideal ! smiling ever Is thy unclouded arch of iris-dyes, And on thy hill-tops, that are darkened never, Eternal sunshine lies. The brows of thy inhabitants are wearing The seal of deep tranquillity and loveâ Unknown the falcon that on earth is tearing With bloody beak the dove. Streams, over precious sands in music creeping, Their silvery arms round magic islets fling, While holy-day the happy elves are keeping With Oberon their king. Fairer than Paphos, or those orient arbors Where jewels light, like stars, the leafy glades, Stretch thy broad parks where Cytherea harbors, Attended by her maids. Grottoes more lovely than Egeria's dwelling Open their portals of enchanted green, Filled with the drowsy chime of waters welling, Purer than Hippocrene. Enamored birds are in thy garden singing Where serpent never wound his glittering coil, And asphodel and amaranth are springing From its celestial soil. The toiling scholar is thrice blest who tarries For a brief season on that haunted shore, And back to shadowed earth his spirit carries A might unknown before. In dreams the grand old Masters wandered thither A wardrobe for the Beautiful to find, And sunny wreaths, that would not drop and wither, Her airy brow to bind. Thence came those opal tints for ever playing On the quaint page where Spencer is revealed, And Una's charm, in fearful places straying, White innocence her shield. Thence came the light and shade that lend such graces To Chaucer's tale, and rhyme of classic Benâ And that loved scroll made brilliant by the traces Of gallant Sydney's pen. From thence the bard derives a rich requital, Though crowds that pass him by look dark and cold; The star-emblazoned deed that gives him title To realms of price untold. There is a flower of glorious apparel That opens in the hush of lonely night, And ere the morning lark begins her carol Is sadly touched with blight; The honey of its cup is never tasted By the swift humming birdâgay sprite of air! Why, on the solemn darkness, is thus wasted A loveliness so rare? Type of that flower was Keats, the young and gifted, Charming with song a cold and thankless world, While the black clouds of woe above him drifted, And Hope her banner furled. The light of fame, at last through darkness streaming, Came falling not upon his living head, But, like some funeral torch, a fitful gleaming Threw only on the dead. Not always, while a deathless task achieving, Did sorrow bring to that high heart eclipse, Ambrosial drops, though fate his shroud was weaving, Fell on his fevered lips. His subtle spirit often was translated From the weak flesh to that still lovely land Where Art can point to works before created, Never by mortal hand:â And I would fain recall a vision pleasant, Seen ere the dappled morn of youth was o'er, In that romantic realm where every peasant Is rich in minstrel-lore. In the deep midnight Fancy broke the tether That makes us bondsmen in our waking hours, And ranged the land of dark, blue lake and heather, Culling poetic flowers. Bewitching moonlight wrapped the hoary mountains, The rugged birthright of the hardy Gael, And streams, that glinted forth from sparkling fountains, Met roaring in the vale. A sky-roofed glen within its heart received me, The floor and sides in grassy velvet drest, And a wild sorrow that too long hath grieved me, Awhile was lulled to rest. To look on famous bards I felt a longing, Nursed in the home of eagles and of storms, And suddenly there was a glorious thronging Of proud, and plaided forms. Unearthly splendor rested on their faces, As moonlight silvers marble with its glow, That fair to vision made the many traces Of want, neglect, and woe. Awful of mien, his long white hair outstreaming, Bearing an antique harp of massy frame, While misty light around his head was beaming, Majestic Ossian came. I thought of those proud words in memory cherished By all who drink at Song's old, haunted springs, âMy voice will not be silent when have perished Temora's haughty kings.â The mighty Painter of the middle ages Towered, staff in hand, above the tuneful throng; Immortal weaver of enchanted pagesâ The Wouvermans of song! Far, in the distance, clustered bright creations Evoked from darkness by his spell of might That chased the gloom from graves of men and nations With its victorious light, To right and left the proud assembly parting Gave place to Burns, in âhodden grayâ attired; His large, black eye, electric flashes darting, Told of a soul inspired:â And he was there who sang in life's glad morning Of Hope, to cheer both hall and cottage hearth, With a rapt look, as if âLochiel's Warningâ Was struggling into birth. Old Allan Ramsay, blythe of mood and pleasant, Attuned his trembling reed, and woke a lay That Pan would have provoked, had he been present, To throw his pipe away. Mild, musing Thomson wore a mantle splendid, And on its ground of wintry white were seen Autumnal gold, and summer crimson blended With stripes of vernal green: And he who wrote âKilmeny,â as if listening The silver bells of fairy-land to hear, Stood, with the night-dew on his tartan glistening, The âGentle Shepherdâ near. One I beheld whose bay will never wither, Though bitterly his cup was drugged with ill, The bard who sang of âJessieâ and âBalquither,â The mournful Tannahill! Nigh Ferguson, all chapleted with willow, Towered Cunningham, in mould gigantic cast, With harp that mocked the roll of ocean's billow, And creak of bending mast. Young Bruce I saw, who pined away uncherished, Though hallowed, aye, his muse Lochleven made, And gifted Leyden who untimely perished, A pale, and piping shade! I saw impassioned Pollock upward gazing, The glow of deep devotion on his cheek, As if he prayed the stars, above him blazing, Of Heaven's high joy to speak. Logan, whose âCuckooâ will sing on forever, For a brief moment, my attention caught; And Home, whose tragic wreath will mildew never, Folded his arms in thought. Near a famed âMinstrel,â fond of Spencer's measure, Hawthornden's classic poet took his stand, And the sweet lute, that cheered his hours of leisure, Flashed, gem-like, in his hand:â And Pringle, who had heard the lion waking Wild Echo, in the desert, with his roar, On the worn garb that veiled his bosom aching The dust of travel bore:â Dark Motherwell, a weird and wild magician! Leaned with a lowering aspect on his lyre, While images of some old Norse tradition Thronged on his soul of fire. And pious Graham, whose chaste muse selected The holy âSabbathâ for its quiet theme, And with the sinless birds his name connected, Was present in my dream. Awe to the scene dim, rearward shapes were giving, Wraiths of a band, without a funeral stone, Whose songs, like echoes in the glens, were living, Although their names unknown. Forgotten minstrels, who had bravely trodden Red battle-fields, in old baronial times, Breathing out woe, when came the day of Flodden, In rude but touching rhymes:â Lads that, in keeping tryst beneath the cover Of flowering thorn with snooded maiden, found Vent for the fluttering transport of the lover In words of tuneful sound:â Shepherds, who caught rare gleams of inspiration While couched their flocks around them on the hillâ Children of toil-ennobling lowly station, Whose tongues would not be still! At length an airy whisper, as of warning, That ran from front to shadowed rear, I heard, And voiceful pine-boughs, in the breath of morning, Like martial plumage stirred; Then wild Ãolian melodies diverted, For a brief space, my wondering regards;â I looked againâthe valley was desertedâ Gone Albyn's plaided bards. Shooting across the bounds of time and distance, Can Fancy thus pursue her viewless trackâ Cheering the gloom of every day existence, Bringing rich treasures back. Thus aliment is furnished that gives vigor To the rapt student in his chamber lone, Or sculptor bidding some majestic figure Leap into life from stone. And shifting, gorgeous tints are thus transmitted That on the canvass of the painter blaze, And Eloquence, to blast corruption, fitted With one indignant gaze. Thus from the poet's heart is banished sadness, And golden radiance on his spirit flungâ His teeming brain possessed of that âfine madness,â Of which old Drayton sung. If we were chained forever to the Real, God's benison would be indeed withdrawn; Without rich glimpses of the bright Ideal, In vain would morning dawn. Upward, on pinions of sublime devotion, The soul would cleave its native sky no more, But loathsome grow, a pool devoid of motion, Foul to its weedy floor. Perish the thought! that in our bosoms never Should wake those airy raptures that were ours Ere fled the freshness of our youth foreverâ When Joy was crowned with flowers; Perish the thought that life in its transitions, Should cease at last to look this earth beyondâ Ringing the funeral knell of glorious visions That on our childhood dawned! Our grosser nature ever strives to win us From worship of the beautiful and bright, And deaf are many to the voice within us, That whispers,ââSeek the light!â Not they alone work faithfully who labor On the dull, dusty thoroughfare of life; The clerkly pen can vanquish, when the sabre Is useless in the strife. In cloistered gloom the quiet man of letters Launching his thoughts, like arrows from the bow, Oft strikes at Treason, and his base abettors, Bringing their grandeur low. Armed with a scroll the birds of evil omen That curse a country he can scare away, Or, in the wake of error, marshal foemen Impatient for the fray. Scorn not the sons of Song! nor deem them only Poor, worthless weeds upon the shore of time; Although they move in walks retired and lonely They have their tasks sublime. When tyrants tread the hill-top and the valley, Calling the birth-right of the brave their own, Around the tomb of Liberty they rally, And roll away the stone. Or roused by some dark peril they have written, Words that awe Guilt behind his guarded wall, Or, by the lightning of their numbers smitten, Beheld the bigot fall. Though fierce, uncurbed emotions running riot, Hiss like Medusa's vipers in the breast, The witchcraft of harmonic sound can quiet The turmoil into rest. Who through the chieftain's castle hall is stealing With the light foot-fall of some beast of prey, While vengeance hushes every softer feeling, Nerving his arm to slay? Where is his home?âto flame its roof was given, And heavy clouds above the ruin lower, While the dread foe, by whom his soul was riven, Unwarned is in his power. Where are his kinsmen?âask the fox and raven That feed upon their corpses, gashed and red; And will he now turn back a trembling craven, What, what arrests his tread? Young Annot Lyle, her Highland clairshach waking, Trills an old ballad to remembrance dearâ And dagger-hilt his rugged hand forsaking Brushes away the tear. Thus can a strain of home, with power disarming, Cause feudal Hate to lay his weapon down, To softness change, (the tiger-passions charming,) His black and baleful frown. Lo! the proud Norman and his hots are flying, While in pursuit, with fierce triumphant cheers That drown the groans of horse and rider dying, Press on the Saxon spears. What stays their flight?âthe song of Rolla rising In angry swell above the dreadful roarâ Again they charge!âthe bolts of death despising, And Harold's reign is o'er. Dread power of Song! whose voice can thus awaken Notes that consign an empire to the grave; Or when recoils a host, by panic shaken, From rout the valiant save. The fearful mantle that the seer is wearing Derives from thee its tints of living fireâ And higher mounts Philosophy when sharing The wealth of thy attire; And, in the distance, to thy vision brightly Gleam happy homes beyond this land of graves, As airy domes and towers, at sunset, lightly Rise from Sicilian waves. There, luminous with effluence from Heaven, The lost are foundâthe dead again descried; Their ransomed natures, freed from earthly leaven, Their tears forever dried. When History, her task but ill achieving, Fails some far epoch faintly to illume, The Muse, her thread like Ariadne weaving, Conducts us through the gloom. She fronts the mornâand on the purple ridges The virgin-future lifts her veil of snowâ Looks westward, and an arch of splendor bridges The gulf of âLong-Ago.â She speaksâand lo! Italian sunlight flashes Over the dark expanse of northern skies; Death hears her thrilling cryâand cold, gray ashes Take mortal shape and rise. When factions vex a state, and new abuses Bring to her drooping banner-fold disgrace, And mind, forgetful of its nobler uses, Grows sensual and baseâ When âthe gray fathersâ of a nation falter, Muffling their faces for the funeral knellâ A lightning-flash from her poetic altar The darkness can dispel. Orion, as an oracle informs us, In the sun's pathway may regain his sight, And in the track of song that cheers and warms us, We bid farewell to night! Then honored be the Bard! a heavenly mansion Alone could be the birth-place of an Art That gives to deathless intellect expansion, And purifies the heart. UTILITY OF IMAGINATION. INSCRIBED TO HON. C. P. AVERY, OWEGO, NEW YORK. Something besides the judgment in alliance With memory evolves both heat and light, When a resistless march is made by science Against the brood of night. How circumscribed would be our mortal vision Without this subtle faculty of mindâ Catching no flowery scent from fields elysian, Weak, grovelling, and blind! The will to dare, with this strange power combining, Derives a force that overcomes mischance; It warms the breast a noble heart enshriningâ Flames in the poet's glance. It is the minister that talks divinely Of things invisible to mortal gaze; The star that beamed on Milton so benignly When fallen on evil days. Though nature grew a blank, and opened sadly His clouded orbs that found the dawn no moreâ While foes rejoiced in his affliction madly, And blocks were soaked with gore; All was not dark, for eyes within were planted, And the great Master looked with reverence still On grove and fountain by the Muses haunted, And Zion's heavenly hill. Those intellectsâreverse of the conceptive, To aught sublime, have never given birth, Like pictures, without background or perspective, They are of little worth. The cestus worn by Venus comprehended All that could win or charm, the Greeks avow, But more of beauty with the wreath is blended That binds a poet's brow. Ever the graceful and the grand begetting, Imagination cheers us on our way, Gives to the gem of truth a golden setting That makes more rich its ray. It lends enchantment to our tasks diurnal, For starry Contemplation builds a tower, And Love, rejoicing in a youth eternal, Leads to a deathless bower. Impatient of all bound, on pinion soaring, It speeds across wide waste and weltering main, Or mounts aloft the spirit-world exploring, That weird and wild domain! Outshining morn, it gives a purple glory To mossy rock, herb, flower, and lapsing streamâ Touches the head with time and trouble hoary, While back comes childhood's dream. The world of thought could know no worse bereavement If God who gave should take this power away; Of the earth, earthy, would man's best achievement Be from that fatal day. What moonlight is to holy night, dismissing The gloom that wrapped both wave and ocean-shore, Or, as a minstrel truly warbles, âKissing Dead things to lifeâ once more, Is this pure agent to our mental being Darkness transforming into landscapes fair, While round to bless and charm our inward seeing Throng wonders rich and rare. Although the soil of thought is noble Reason, Where golden grain by memory is sown, Our souls would famishâdawn no harvest season, If fed by these alone. Imagination is the radiant essence, The sun maturing fruit on which we feed, Clothing the soil with rainbow efflorescence, Quickening the buried seed. A sense of beauty, grace, and chaste proportion Flows from its actionâotherwise would Art Nothing produce but shapes of grim distortion To chill, not warm the heart. Its agency may ever be detected When Genius plumes his wing for higher flight, Or images of grandeur are reflected From the soul's mirror bright. Those who decry its influence, and have clamored Most loudly for the practical and true, In childhood, of its blossoms were enamored Pearled with the morning dew. Poetic raptures in their bosoms springing Owed to this vital principle their birth, While music floated round them like the singing Of angels on the earth. Of sky and plain it was the rich adorner, And the full blaze of its enchantment fell On story books, that to the chimney corner Bound them as by a spell. I know that never those ecstatic feelings That cheered our years of innocence, come back, That manhood brings its terrible revealings, Resistance and attack. But hearts are changed to tombs where wholly perish Emotions that once made each fibre thrill, While May-time lingers in the breasts that cherish Some boyish feeling still. Of strong Imagination talk not lightly, It gives the present its progressive start; To comeliness converting the unsightly In law, religion, art. The mind becomes without this throbbing movement To rouse and thrill, mechanical and cold; Content to slumber on, without improvementâ Mute slave of custom old! Deep longings for a nobler life can only Find home in bosoms glowing with its fire, Whether they beat in hall or hovel lonelyâ Wear mean or rich attire. To things, without an archetype, is given Ideal presence, form and color bright, When by its aid away the mist is driven That clouded mental sight. Through its strong action unity essential, In things that seem to differ we detect; Hence arguments, conclusive and potential, Philosophers erect. It kisses the pale, faded wreath of sorrow Till back comes fluttering life and vernal green, And the clear promise of a fairer morrow Is in the orient seen: It breathes upon the strings of our existence, And sweet Ãolian melodies arise, While seraphs wave their white wings in the distance Called earthward from the skies: It rears aloft, for man to hold communion With higher natures, free from mortal leaven, A golden ladder that produces union Between dark earth and Heaven: It blows a silver trumpet when we falter In upward march, those Alpine heights to gain, Where gather round an ever-burning altar A priesthood free from stain It tolls a solemn curfew, sweetly bringing To weary Labor balm and soft repose; And Grief, to hear the deep vibration ringing, Of rest enamored grows: Wild lawless Mirth forsakes his work of riot, The honey-dew of slumber falls on Careâ The lulling sounds have even power to quiet That Stygian ghostâDespair! It is the dazzling rainbow overbending Time's wave, made turbid by a crumbling shoreâ Weaver of colors, with the present blending, And all we loved of yore: It whispers in the hoary ear of Ocean And chaunting sirens quit their coral caves, While sounds are heard that charm to gentler motion His ever-throbbing waves: It visits us at night, and we are guided By singing phantoms to melodious streams, And walk with lovely shapes that reign divided Hold in the land of dreams: It finds the student in his cell despairing, And drapes the walls with crimson and with gold, While grandly enter, crown and laurel wearing, The mighty ones of old: Deep marks they bear upon their calm proud faces Of bitter trial borne to win renown; For all who struggle up to lofty places Must feel the storm come down. Call not a fleeting shadow an illusionâ A power that wields such dread and vast control; That moulds to grace and harmony confusion, And nerves the drooping soul. It is the loom that forms a web to cover With brightness all that sage or bard has wroughtâ The â???????? ???â that flashes over The firmament of thought. Transmuting spirit! why is Romance grieving For genii vanished on the âposting air,â As if the lustrous shapes of thy conceiving Our mortal doom could share. Still a response Dodona's oaks are giving, And naiads haunt Arcadian fount and rill, In murmuring groves are faun and dryad living, And Jove is mighty still. Round Erin's ruined castle lightly sailing, Where Valor sued for Beauty's hand of yore, The mystic banshee wakes a note of wailing For those who come no more. In merry England nightly to their revel Mischievous elves and trooping fairies throng, Waking the silence of her meadows level With laugh and antique song. King Arthur, still, with plume and pennon streaming, To battle hurries from his castle hall, And famous knights, in dinted armor gleaming, Obey his trumpet call. Lithe Ariel, on Prospero that waited, Twines by the moonlight still her magic wreath, And the Weird Sisters, by thy wand created, Dance on the blasted heath. Imagination is a gift celestial That Eden's loss to man in part restores; Starring the twilight of this scene terrestrial With rays from heavenly shores. The soul within a breezy tower it stations, Things high above this rolling orb to note, As through thin air of lofty elevations Seems nearer the remote. Ah! if the spirit never left its prison Till the pale flag of finite life was furled, No prophet clothed in terror would have risen To warn a guilty world. That preacher follows a mistaken calling Whose sermon is not living with its flame; Guilt is not startled from a trance appalling When utterance is tame. To common stature would a Webster dwindle, And spell to charm a Clay no longer own, Did not this lightning of the mind enkindle Eye, action, word, and tone. It waits not for Death's ferryman to row us O'er the dark waters to a port unknown, But in our dreams Elysium can show us. Or Pluto's gloomy throne. Oh! call not unsubstantialâbut a vaporâ That which can stir the heart's unsounded deep, And prompt Ambition, by his midnight taper, Long, wasting watch to keep; Can vivify, exalt, refine, transfigureâ Of true impassioned eloquence the source, From which cold fact derives a pulse of vigor, Mere words, victorious force. Unreal? no! in transport it unites us To climes of milder sky and purer air, And with a sweet, persuasive tongue invites us To taste of nectar there. Dry learning, force, and logical acumen Would not hand Plato down from age to age, Did not this god-like attribute illumine His philosophic page. Prose must be pregnant with its spirit burning, Or in some dusky nook aside be flung, Even some patient antiquary spurning The place with cobwebs hung. Its royal stamp can never be mistaken On works that bear the searching test of time, Alike emblazoned on the page of Bacon And Chaucer's rude old rhyme. Costly morocco, clasp and gilded cover, Will not avail a barren book to save, And black Lethean waters soon close over Its unrecorded grave. Ethereal sparks must flash through what is written To make an author's name a household word On loving lips, though states with wreck are smitten, In court and cottage heard. A pensioned press and critical pretenders May give the vapid passport for a day, But when assailed by merit's true defenders It melts like mist away. The product must be genuine, or fashion And shifting taste will prove it worse than vain; The mocking forms of counterfeited passion Impress nor heart, nor brain. A vivid outline must be first engendered, Forerunner of a ripening into deed; To mortal work was never homage rendered That did not thus proceed. Our inward eye beholds the stately building Ere corner-stone is laid, or hammer rings, Hall, winding stair, and chambers rich in gilding, Base, buttress, tower and wings. Language provides poor symbols of expression When roused Imagination, holding reign, Sends airy forms of grace in vast procession Across the poet's brain. An Orphic tongue would be too weak an agent To tell the tale of inspiration's hour; To paint an outline of the gorgeous pageantâ A Titian have no power. The meagre, written record of the closet Saves but a few, pale glimmering pearlsâno moreâ When the lashed waves roll inland to deposit Their wealth along the shore. Within, a stream of poesy is gushing That spoken word would freeze in its wild flow, And lovelier tints the current deep are flushing Than art will ever know. The Queen of Beauty and her blushing daughters In Crathis bathedâthat old poetic streamâ And each dark ringlet from the sparkling waters Imbibed an amber gleam. Thus thoughts that send and will send on forever, From the dim plains of long-ago, a light Caught from Imagination's golden river Their glow divinely bright. When done with life, its fever, din and jostle, How scant and poor a portion after all Of Nature's Priest and Art's renowned Apostle Lies hid beneath the pall. Though grazing herd and hosts with clanging sabres Their graves forgotten trample rudely o'er, To tribes and nations, through their crowning labors, They speak for evermore. Oh! Genius! dowered with privilege immortal, Thus from the wastes of time to stretch thy hand, And, with a touch, unfold the glittering portal Of an enchanted land! Death knows thee not, though long ago were blended Thy bones with indistinguishable clay, The dead are they whose mission here is endedâ Thy voice is heard to-day. Heard on the honeyed lip of Juliet meltingâ In dreaming Richard's cry of guilty fear; In shouts that rise above the night-storm pelting From old distracted Lear. Heard in the organ-swell of Milton pealingâ In Gray's elegiac sorrow for the pastâ In flute-notes from the muse of Spencer stealing, And Dryden's bugle-blast! Heard in the matchless works of thy creation, Speaking from canvass, scroll, and marble lips, In those deep, awful tones of inspiration That baffle death's eclipse. THEMES OF SONG. INSCRIBED, WITH GRATEFUL RECOLLECTIONS, TO HON. JOHN GREIG, OF CANANDAIGUA. Where lives the soul of Poetry? It dwells In the lone desert, where no fountain wells Speaks in the Kamsin's blast, dread foe of man, That overthrows the luckless caravan, And in a tomb, unknown to friendship, hides The toiling camels and their Arab guides; Dwells in the boiling mÃ¦lstrom deep and dark, That roars a dismal warning to the bark, And lingers where volcanic mountains throw A burning deluge on the vale below. Where lives the soul of Poetry? Dark caves, Worn by the foamy buffeting of waves; The blue abysses of the moaning sea, Where coral insects fashion dome and tree, And mermaids chant, by mortal eye unseen, And comb in sparry halls their tresses green; The broad savannah, where the bison strays, And come in herds the fallow-deer to graze; The mossy forest, far from haunts of men, Where the wild wolf prepares his savage den; The giant Andes, round whose frosty peaks The tempest hovers and the condor shrieks; Cold, cheerless Greenland, where the ice-berg hoar Strikes with a deafening crash the barren shore, While roves the white fox, and the polar bear, In quest of prey, forsakes his icy lair; Bright tropic bowers, within whose depths of green The pard and savage tiger lurk unseen; Where the fierce scales of deadly reptiles shine, While round the trunks of giant palms they twine; The spicy groves of Araby, the blest, In fadeless robes of bloom and verdure drest, Where birds of gorgeous plumage perch and sing In varied strains, or wander on the wing; Romantic Persia, where the dulcet lay Of the glad Peri never dies away; While the light pinions of the wooing wind Fan the young leaves of date and tamarind, And nightingales, amid the branches throng, Own the glad presence of the soul of Song. The rich, warm hues, that flush the western cloud When yellow twilight weaves her glorious shroud; The babbling cascade, that descends in foam And flashing beauty from its rocky home; The mingling tones of laughing earth and air, When morn braids purple in her golden hair; The dance of leaves, the lulling fall of rain, The river, on its journey to the main; The quiet lakes, that spread their sheets of blue, A sweet enchantment lending to the view; The fierce tornado, parent of dismay, Uprooting sylvan giants in his way; The lulling winds of summer, or the blast That howls a requiem when the leaf is cast; The pearly moonshine of an autumn night, When glen and glade are bathed in spectral light, And lawn of spring, with varied flowers inwrought, Are the pure nurses of poetic thought. Go where Parnassus lifts his hoary brow, Though classic Delphi lies in ruin now, And the grim robber lurks, with wary eye, Round the rich fount of storied Castaly; Stroll where the walks of Tempe, broad and green, Proud Ossa and Olympus spread between, While through bright bowers the swift Peneus strays, And foamy tribute to Ãgean pays. The bearded corsair, chants in foreign tongue, Where the blind King of epic grandeur sung; No voice of onset rises from the plain, Where rapt Tyrteus woke the martial strain; Thine isle, oh, Sappho! mourning waters gird, But there no music like thine own is heard; Where the proud mother hurried to the field Her only son, and giving him a shield, Said, with an accent of heroic joy, âBring, or be brought upon it back, my boy!â Now Grecian girls their tinkling rebecks string, And the soft magic of the blind god singâ By moonlight gaily link their rosy hands, And dance the glad Romaika on the sands. In beauty still the tumbling billows break On the lone shore of Lerna's reedy lake, Still the green olive trembles in the breeze, Though there no Hydra rovesâno Hercules; Pactolus glides, to deathless beauty wed, But gold no longer flashes in his bedâ Above that sea the sky still looks divine, Where Delos darted from the cradling brineâ The tide yet sweeps where blushing Venus rose, But Triton there his horn no longer blows. Go where the top of old Hymettus towers, Haunt of the bee, and odorous with flowers, While far below, the cool Cephissus winds; A name of kindling fire to classic minds, Pause, where the streams of wooded Ida flow, Though guardian naiads fled, long, long ago: The verdant sides of dewy Latmos climb, Rich in the precious lore of olden time, Where star-girt Dian, from her throne of blue, Came down the young Endymion to wooâ Stand on old hills that overlook the seas, Though gone their nymphs, the wild Oreadesâ In fancy view the dolphin cleave the wave, And bear the minstrel from a watery grave; Hear proud Amphion wake his master-tone, And give life, joy, mobility to stone; On old Egina fix your kindling glanceâ Round Athens linger in poetic tranceâ The sacred groves of fallen Greece explore, Home of the laughing Dryades no more, And own, although her star of power hath set, The soul of kingly Song is present yet. The sun looks fondly on the crumbling dome, And fallen pile of desecrated Rome, And the wan moon her horn of silver fills, To bathe in dazzling light her seven hillsâ As rolled his wave when Italy was free, Still rolls old father Tiber to the sea: Morn on his breast a red enchantment throws, His waves still blush when day is near its close, And floating sweetly through majestic trees, Come the wild songs of herdsmen on the breeze. Though creeping ivy veils imperial wrecks, And the dark brow of victor Ruin decksâ Though nodding weeds of loneliness are high Where marble triumphs of the chisel lieâ Though the dark bat and solitary toad. Find in the hall of CÃ¦sar an abode No longer hung with hostile banners furledâ And trophies wrested from a subject worldâ Though wall-flowers grow beside the prostrate shrine, And mingling piles that cumber Palatine, A voice of many tones goes up from wave, Dark ruin, storied haunt, and green old grave. It whispers of past triumphs, when the street Was strewn with flowery carpets for the feet; When wreathy clouds of grateful incense rose From smoking altars, white as drifted snows: When horse and foot went by with iron clang; While the shrill trump and brazen clarion rangâ When came the captive host and spoils of war Behind the victor in his glittering car, With golden ball, refulgent on his breast, In flowing robes of kingly purple drest. A voice goes up from Numa's sacred mount, Deserted temple and neglected fount, From snowy columns piled in fluted heaps, And the round tomb, where proud Metella sleeps; From emptied urn, and broken arch of stone That breathes a saddening tale of glory gone: That voice, like echo in sepulchral halls, On the quick ear of musing genius falls, His spirit pluming for a flight sublime, While round him rise the wasting wrecks of time. Where Brutus bared the steel, Childe Harold heard That voice of mourning, and his soul was stirred, Swept his proud harp beneath Ausonian skies, And woke his wildest, sweetest melodies. When music trembled on the evening breeze, And moonbeams lighted architrave and frieze, Within the lofty Coliseum stood, The Lord of Newstead, in his saddest mood, On the square block and corridor beheld The mark of Vandal, and the stain of eld, While the pale light through broken arches stole, To deck decay and beautify the whole. The Pilgrim thought of men ignobly brave, The purpled master, and submissive slave, Whose voices wildly mingled in one yell Of savage pleasure when some victim fell. Fresh grew his memory of those golden days, When Flaccus chanted his immortal laysâ Gave point and polish to satiric shaft, While glad Apollo praised his skill and laughed; When tuneful Maro, epic monarch, strung His lyre of deathless harmony and sung: The daring pinion of his fancy spread, And fadeless lustre on old Ilium shed: When graceful Tully in the forum spoke, Enkindled anger, or amazement woke, While the fell traitor, pale with terror, heard The knell of crime in each denouncing word. Back on his mind came that terrific night When dreaming thousands woke in wild affright; When the loud blast of Gothic trumpets fell On Roman ears of hope the horrid knell, And through rent gates, with lance and lifted sword, Came Alaric, the mighty, and his horde. Oh, dreadful hour! when startled Tiber ran Red with the light of flames and blood of man, When blazing domes changed darkness into day; Enticing Lust to Innocence his prey. Where was thy matchless race of iron men, Thy victor Eagle, Queen of Empires, then? What strange mutation in thy heart was wrought? Thy children trembled where their fathers foughtâ Thy Bird of Conquest, like a timid thing, With drooping neck and darkly folded wing, Saw kneeling matrons, red with infant gore, In vain the wild barbarian implore. Though Rome is fallen from her high estate, Her grandeur gone, her palace desolate; Although her haughty flag no longer flings On trampled lands the shadow of its wings, She is the home of memories that stir With inspiration all who visit her; The wondrous magnet of thy world, oh, Thought! By wisdom haunted, and by scholar sought Where the proud sons of Taste and Science find Forever spread the festival of mind. The sibyl of Egeria hath fledâ Where Cato trod assassins boldly treadâ Across her bridge that spans the troubled tide Pomp moves no longer with colossal strideâ Gone are the genii of her bowers and plains, But the sweet soul of deathless Song remains. Land of the Holy Sepulchre! thou art The noblest theme to rouse poetic heart, For every rock beneath thy glowing sky Rang with the awful tones of prophecy: On the bright mountains of thy clime have trod The sweet, seraphic messengers of Godâ With the pure presence of that Lamb who died To save a world thy rivers are allied: Within thy bowers, and groves of beauty rare, His meek disciples have knelt down in prayer; The dying martyr, in exulting strains Hath sung of triumph on thy sacred plains, And saints have often meekly bent the knee On the green shore of breezy Galilee. Through wasted vales, in rich barbaric garb, The haughty emir guides his flying barb; Above the sod of apostolic graves The pallid glory of the crescent wavesâ Where the swift Arnon in his channel foams The dusky reader of the Koran roams; Where Carmel rises, rich in sacred lore, Goes up the smoke of sacrifice no moreâ The sons of Islam pitch their tents of snow Where rang the harp and timbrel long ago; Where the winged angel woke the dreaming wave, And healing power to cool Bethesda gave. The cry of âAllah!â on each wind that blows, Is borne where Sharon gloried in her rose, Where Hermon shone, with heavenly dew-drops wet, And beauty made her home on Olivet. Though on the banks of Jordan now are mute The notes of sackbut, dulcimer, and lute, Still the proud cedar lifts his verdant cone, And makes the top of Lebanon his throne. Bright robes of glory still invest the place, Where dwelt the parents of the human race, Still Horeb towers whereon the Prophet stood When the mad whirlwind shook the crashing wood, Heard the loud thunder in the vaulted sky, And knew Jehovah by his flashing eye. Oh, words are feeble vehicles of thought To paint a clime where miracles were wrought, Unless the tongue that gives them voice can sing Like rapt Isaiah or the Shepherd-King. Go where the Nile, to slake the torrid sand, Leaps from his bed, and overflows the landâ Where the red sun-burst of the morning hour The harp of Memnon woke with mystic powerâ Where lofty Science from her cradle sprung, And over Greece her burning mantle flung; Where infant Sculpture made the marble warm, To wondrous sphinx and hippogrif gave formâ Where Memphis boasted of her wealth untold Her spacious halls of porphyry and gold: Where the proud Queen of Victors Cleopatra. brightly wove Round Roman hearts the matchless spell of love, Lifted the gilded beaker to her lip, In one proud draught the wealth of kings to sipâ Lay on her blazing couch of queenly rest, By Cupids fanned, voluptuously drest, While her swift galley down the Cydnus flew Rich in its freight, and sail of purple hue, Spread out by winds that bore the tone of lute, And the low warblings of the dulcet flute. O, mourning Mother of lost arts! thy name Stirs with unwonted sympathy my frameâ Wakes in my heart affection's holiest thrill, Although thy ruins whiten vale and hill. I know that Turkish conquest in a day Thy heaps of letter'd wisdom swept away, That turbaned pachas wield the scourging rod Where Ptolemy and proud Sesostris trod, But still thy fount of lore by learning sought, Gives sight to blindness, and a glow to thought. In fancy visit that neglected site Where Carthage rose in majesty and might, By Dido founded on old Afric's strand, With Neptune subject to her dread command. That chief recall who left his ocean home To battle for the mastery with Romeâ Across the frosty Alps his legions led, While kingdoms shook beneath his iron treadâ Recall her peerless ships of old renown That long ago beneath the wave went downâ Think of her awful destiny, and pour A wail for grandeur that will live no more No vestige lingers of her triple walls, Her flanking-towers, her storm-proof arsenals; Of her strong bulwarks, sword, and fire, and time, To charm the gaze, have left no wreck sublime; The laurel crown is faded on her browâ Amid her ruins sits no Marius now; For empire lost, and glory in the grave There is no mourner, save the chainless wave. Ye solemn cities of the dead!âbereft Of brightness, being; ye have something leftâ A power to wake the pulses of the soul, And back the darkling tide of ages rollâ A charm that robs pale silence of his chain, And fills with light the chambers of the brain; A talismanic witchery that calls The shrouded mighty from their charnel halls, Fills air with regal spectres, while the hand Of buried magic grasps a broken wandâ Calls the fierce chieftain from forgotten tomb, With breast-plate, greave, strong helm, and nodding plume, To wake with trump wan multitudes of slain, And lead them madly to the field again. Ye haunts of lofty musing! though the flood Of wild invasion merged your pomp in blood, Though column huge and obelisk of taste Lie darkly buried in the sandy waste, Though the tall ostrich flaps his stately wings, And bitterns boom above the dust of kingsâ Though in your courts the ministers of death Breathe on the wind their pestilential breath, Ye have a mystic potency of spell That sways the bosom to its inmost cell, A magic lamp that sheds redeeming day On desolation, darkness, and decay. Romantic Spain, for years of glory flown, Breathes on the wind her melancholy moan; No more the pennon of her Cid will wave Its green, triumphant folds above the brave, But roving fancy, in her olive bowers, To charm mankind still culls poetic flowersâ Finds tale of wonder on her lonely strand, And warlike legend in her mountain-landâ Strolls where Granada lifts her verdant hill On which the tall Alhambra glitters still Rich in its fret-work, and mosaic floor, That echoes back the tread of kings no more. On the fair banks of gentle Rio Verde, In dreams again the Moorish horn is heard, While Leon, waking with a battle shout, Lifts the red lance, and flings her banner out. Land of the Claymore, and the rugged rock, Burn, broomy knowe, gray cairn, and stormy loch, On the proud altar of thy bardic fame Full brightly burns imperishable flame! With partial art Apollo tuned thy lyre, And tone celestial gave each trembling wire; No brighter stars within his temple shine, Land of the pibroch and the plaid, than thine! No more thy Fingal, when the camp is still, Moves in his armor on the windy hill, With ghostly Trenmor dialogue to hold, While awfully roll back the times of old. No more the sons of woody Morven throng With shield and helmet to the hall of song, Call on the bard to weave his mystic spells, And lend enchantment to the feast of shells; Borne on the pinions of the hollow blast, No more dark Loda's spirit journeys past, But Ossian lives, and in his bardic crown Gleams the rich germ of thy mature renown. Thy heart within its greenest cell inurns The lasting, lofty memory of Burns, And proudly throbs when seek the pilgrim throng His lowly cot and scenery of his songâ Stand on the banks of wooded Ayr, or tune Their harps to praise him in the bowers of Doon. Thy sad, decaying fabrics of the past, Gloom on the relics of the mighty castâ Fair Melrose Abbey holds in solemn trust The heart of Bruce and Douglas, changed to dust; The roof of Dryburg bends above the place Where rest lost scions of a noble race, And the fresh grave where Scott lies darkly shrined, The crowning rose in thy proud wreath of mind. Tweed, Carron, Nith, Sweet Clyde, romantic Dee, And all thy streams that journey to the seaâ Ben Nevis, Lomond, Cruachan, Cairn-Gorm, And all thy peaks that battle with the stormâ Thy yawning caves, green shaws, romantic dells, Where brownies gather, and the warlock dwells, And lonely moors, with heather overspread, His muse to immortality hath wed. Land of the Shamrock! Island of the Brave! Thy broad, green fields are trodden by the slave, But my weak hand one flower of song will cast On the dark tomb that hides thy buried past. Dim is thy 'scutcheon with obscuring dust, And dark thy spear with thick, corroding rust; The sword of Brefni, with its terror gone, Hangs in its scabbard, blunted and undrawn; No garland braids thy brow of settled gloomâ Thy red-haired chieftain hath a noteless tombâ No banner floats from Tara's mouldered walls, And heard no more is harping in thy halls. Gone is the child who wept thy waning day, Woke on thy mournful shore funeral lay, Flowing so wildly sweet to mortal ear, That even mailed oppression paused to hear; The gate of grandeur and the cottage door Are open flung to welcome him no moreâ Thy lonely exile under distant skies, Starts at the name of Carolan and sighsâ True bard who perished, warbling to life's close Thy song of sorrow and thy tale of woes. Oh, Erin! yet a pulse beats in thy soulâ To earth thy hand hath dashed the damning bowlâ One tear is wiped from off thy cheek of woe, Pledge that thy star another morn will know; Though bondage, block, foul treason and the sword, A gory deluge on thy brows have poured, The flower of genius, watered by thy tears, Blooms mid the pleading wrecks of former years. Swept by a Moore, the harp of Innisfail Gives out complaining murmurs to the gale; He found the matchless instrument unstrung. On its cold frame the spider's web-work hungâ Beneath his hand, from chords for ages hushed, Rich streams of wild, delicious music gushed. Oh! may the minstrel, ere he looks his last On thy green fields, revived, behold the pastâ Thy Sun-Burst glittering on the gale once moreâ The long night ended, and thy heart-ache o'er, While brave men, wronged, march forth in stern array To roll from glory's tomb the stone away. Thy Curran, Grattan, Sheridan, and Flood, In the bright vanguard of the mighty stood, And roused to rend thy unrelaxing chain The thunders of their eloquence in vain. In bondage thus thou givest birth to sons Whom earth enrols among her peerless ones; What will thy children be when they awake, And every strand in grief's black cable break? Lamps in the hall of learning to the blind, Gems of the worldâbright polar stars of mind! Too long have sable vestments wrapped thy form: Too long howled round thy naked head the storm: In Freedom's temple, rescued from disgrace, The Lear of nations yet shall find a place. The peerless isle that gave our fathers birth, Hath many spots of consecrated earth; Though victor time, in his remorseless march, Hath worn the cloister dim, and Gothic archâ Left stain of darkness on the tomb of pride, Where strength and beauty slumber side by side. Trace back her story to that distant day, When tuneful Merlin woke the bardic lay, And the wild Briton, in his savage car, Met, with bare breast, the Roman shock of war. No daring son of Cader Idris, now Sleeps in the cavern, on his rocky brow, While wizards string his harp with glowing chords, And give his tongue the gift of burning words; But the rude pile of Stonehenge still uprears Colossal fragments dark with cloudy years; Each rugged rock of Druidism tellsâ Shrines red with gore, and wild, unholy spells. No more the priest, in robe of snowy fold, Climbs the tall oak with knife of gleaming gold, And cuts, while chant the mystic throng below, Balm for all ill, the precious mistletoe. No more the victim vainly shrieks for aid, The groves of Mona in the dust are laid, And the bright Star of Bethlehem sheds light On the dense vapor of Druidic night. No more Old England hears, in good greenwood, The merry bugle of her Robin Hood; His bow is broken, and entombing mould Roofs the dark mansion of his outlaws bold; From her green glens, like misty shapes, have gone The merry court of monarch Oberon. No more the gaze of wondering Romance Beholds her fairy throng prolong the dance, When mellow star-light gives a lustrous glow To Cam and gentle Avon as they flow: No more beholds her knight throw down the glove, And couch the lance to please his lady-loveâ Tilt in the tourney against fearful odds, While beauty waves her 'kerchief and applauds. No more her Richard draws the fatal sword, To smite the fiery Soldan and his horde, But castled wrecks of feudal grandeur still Crown with their mossy battlements, her hill, And airy Fable seeks old haunted springs To gem with dew her ever-changing wings; Her gray, monastic ruins, darkly keep Their lonely vigils on her blooming steep; Her princely homes, round which the ivy twines, Tell olden tales of her baronial lines, When winking mirth on Valor fondly gazed, Then to his lip the cup of wassail raisedâ Or murder bared his deadly knife, and found Tomb for his prey in dungeons under ground. On battle plain where now the heifer feeds, The clang of armor and the rush of steeds, At midnight startle the belated swain, And chill the red warm current in his vein. Oh, Land of Inspiration! where the Nine Came to uprear an everlasting shrine, When blood was mingled with Castalian dew, And dark with cloud the sky of Hellas grewâ Thy queenly name and lion flag are known From the parched Tropic to the frozen zone. What true descendant of the Pilgrim stock, Who shouted âfreedom!â on the Plymouth Rock, Feels not true pride, green jewel of the sea, To think he drew his parentage from thee? Well may the children of thy rock-bound coast, Tell of thy fame to every land, and boast, âHere Chaucer wrote, and Spencer swept the lyre, With tuneful ear and necromantic fire; Here nursing Nature, with caresses fond, To Shakespeare gave her wonder-working wand; Smiled, when her idol, with one mighty stroke, A boundless sea of thought and feeling woke; Here the bright muse of Milton, spurning earth, With angels sang, where light and life have birth; Then flying downward, by an awful spell, Laid bare the dreadful mysteries of Hell! Though storied Europe, of the past may boast, Her heirs of deathless fame, a countless host! Presiding spirits over mount and vale, Dark haunt of ghost, and legendary taleâ Tombs of the mighty, and the wrecks of art, That stir, with mournful memories, the heart, Our own free land is rich in glorious themes, And lofty sources of poetic dreams. Earth, that conceals the dust of patriot sires, No pompous aid from fading art requires; Above their bones no pyramid uprears Its grand proportions mystical with years; The mounds that mark the places of their rest, Poetic rapture kindle in the breast; Instil a love of country that will brave Despotic wrath on land or rolling wave. Their blood, by which our liberty was bought, Hath sanctified the places where they fought; And when the Muse of History unseals Her mighty tome, deep, thrilling joy she feels When pointing out, amid the names that fill With light her fadeless pages, âBunker Hill!â We, too, have dark memorials of the past, With cloudy robes of doubt around them cast! And plodding science, to dispel the shade, In vain calls wild conjecture to her aid. Our western caves within their wombs of stone Hide mortal wrecks, to memory unknown; Bones of the mammoth, that appal the gaze, Majestic relics of departed days! And broad, green prairies, in their sweep infold Vast mounds constructed by the tribes of old. Where can the children of Apollo find More lovely haunts to please romantic mind Than those that grace our own green land of woods, Fair skies, bright vales, and fertilizing floods? Clad in the gaudy costume of his race, Here the fleet red man panted in the chase, Swept the light paddle, or in thickest shade For painted foe the deadly ambush laid. Here the broad boughs of sylvan giants wove His green cathedral in the mossy groveâ Beneath its roof an altar-stone he raised, And the Great Spirit of his people praised, Read his kind mercy in the sun-light warm, His anger in the whirl-wind and the storm. Like some proud oak when lightning scathes the rind, That lives awhile, then falls before the wind, While fragrant flowers of evanescent dyes, That loved its shadows, droop and close their eyesâ So when the whites applied the worm of grief To the dark bosom of the Indian chief, He fell a ruin, and his tribe in vain Mourn for the limits of their old domain, And broken-hearted, follow, one by one, His path to isles below the setting sun. Our mossy groves and mighty inland seas, That bare their broad, blue bosoms to the breeze; Our lofty hills, that guard the fruitful vale Rich in tall forests bending to the gale; Our mighty stretch of coast, from sea to sea, Where man alone to God inclines the knee; Where, free from gale, with canvass idly furled, Might snugly moor the shipping of the world; Our streams, embracing in their winding arms, All that enchanted vision chains or charms; And Niagara, when the storm is loud, Who drowns the deep roar of the thunder-cloud, Clad in his bright, magnificent array, Of rain-bow, storm, white foam, and torrent spray, Woo genius forth to win a crown of light, And plume his pinion for an epic flightâ From air invoke divinities to guard Glen, grot, and mountain, sacred to the bard. The hand of fame no purer wreath can twine Round mortal brow, sweet Poesy, than thine! For blushing carnage and the tear of grief Dim not the beauty of its fadeless leaf, And the fresh odors of its bloom impart Balm to the bitter ailments of the heart. Who, who would fling thy precious flowers away, To gird his temples with heroic bay, Or tread in dust thy garland of renown To snatch from pomp his regal robe and crown? Oh, not true bard and holy, in whose breast The wave of earthly passion is at rest! When gentle Music, sister art, is muteâ Her viol broken, and unstrung her lute, When the proud triumphs of the painter fade, Lose their rich tinting, and grow dark with shadeâ While Sculpture mourns her form of breathing stone, By cruel change and Vandal overthrown, While Taste beholds her fairest fabrics fall, And o'er them Nature weave her ivied pallâ While charm the sons of Thespis for a day, Then melt, like dew-drops of the night, away, While Conquest moulders in his martial shroud, A rayless star behind a dusky cloudâ While cities slumber in volcanic graves, And isles of beauty sink beneath the waves, The bright creations of the poet live, And joy to passing generations giveâ Borne on the wandering winds of every clime Assault defying of decay and time. Where is the Land of Song?âoh, not alone To famous fields where War his trump hath blown And Earth's proud places are its bounds confined: It owns a royal empire in the mind: Beyond the bright blue curtain of the skies, Where living verdure fadeth not, it liesâ No clouds obscure the radiant prospect there, And ever throbs with melody the air: Oh, there, at last, a harp will minstrel wake Whose silver chord no rending blast will break, There, in full tide, will his free numbers flow, There will his strain no dying cadence know. THE PIONEERS OF WESTERN NEW YORK. READ BEFORE THE LITERARY SOCIETIES OF GENEVA COLLEGE, AUGUST 1, 1838. [This Poem was most kindly received on its âdelivery,â as the phrase is, and a committee, consisting of several distinguished gentlemen, one of whom was my âmost loved and honored friend,â the venerable John Greig, so eminent for every social and civic virtue, addressed the author the following request, which was complied with: âDear Sir-The poem read by you this day, before the Literary Societies of Geneva College, and the numerous assemblage of citizens and strangers who attended the exercises at the College Commencement, was universally admired for its poetical beautiesâfor its appropriate description of the part of the country in which we reside, and of the perils and privations incident to its early settlement. Some of your friends among the old settlers, and their descendants, will be highly gratified to see the Poem published, and we solicit a copy for publication.â] Our hardy pioneers, the men whoânursed Amid the blooming fields of cultured landsâ Forsook the scenes of infancy, and first With hearts of lofty daring and strong hands Pierced old primeval grovesâby hunter bands And beasts of carnage tenanted aloneâ And lit their camp fires on the lonely strands Of lakes and seas, to geographer unknown, Deserve the bard's high layâthe sculptor's proudest stone. Noblest of human conquerors were they! For, mighty though the bonds that bound the heart To home and its endearments, far away From mourning kindred and the crowded mart, And earth for funeral uses set apart, Where lay their honored dead in solemn rest, They bore the precious seed of useful art To wild, benighted regions of the West; Since the creation-day in unpruned beauty dressed. Let Ruin lift his arm, and crush in dust The glittering piles and palaces of kings, And, changing crown and sceptre into rust, Doom them to sleep among forgotten thingsâ Let time o'ershadow with his dusky wings Warriors who guilty eminence have gained, And drank renown at red, polluted springsâ Sacked peaceful townsâthe holy shrine profaned,â And to their chariot wheels the groaning captive chained:â But the self-exiled Britons who behind Left Transatlantic luxuries, and gave Their parting salutations to the wind, And, scorning the vile languor of the slave, Rocked with the little May Flower on the wave, To immortality have prouder claim. Let the bright Muse of History engrave Their names in fadeless characters of flame, And give their wondrous tale an everlasting fame. No empty vision of unbounded powerâ No dream of wild romanceâno thirst for gold Lured them from merry England's hall and bowerâ Her Sabbath chime of bells, her hamlet old; At home religious bigotry controlled The struggling wing of thought; a gloomy cloud, Charged with despotic wrath above them rolled; And haunts they sought where man might walk unbowed, And sacred truth might raise her warning voice aloud. No waving flag, gay plume nor gleaming casque, Proclaimed them masters of war's bloody trade: Less daring spirits from the mighty task In terror would have shrunken. Tender maid, And daughter gently reared, for God to aid Their feeble natures, breathed the words of prayer, And in heaven's panoply their souls arrayedâ Speeding the good work on, though frail and fair, When sterner manhood felt the faintness of despair. Old Sparta in exulting tones may boast Of ancient matrons who could deck the bier Of sire and husband, slain where host met host, And, in the flush of pride, forget the tear: Our pilgrim mothers, too, could conquer fear, And stifle sorrow; but their hearts enshrined The soft affections: who loves not to hear Their praises sung?âtheir constancy of mind, Amid thy daughters, Greece, we strive in vain to find! White lay the snow flakes on the lonely shore, And winter flung his banner on the blastâ Behind swept angry waters; and before Spread waving woods, dark, limitless and vast, When a new continent received at last Our houseless sires. The red-man, gaunt and grim. On the strange scene his falcon vision cast; And nameless terror shook his tawny limb While, drowning ocean's roar, went up their triumph-hymn; And when the bold survivors of that band Reached the decaying autumn-time of life, And locks were white, and palsied was the hand, Barbaric swarms, with axe and deadly knife, And painted, plumed and quivered for the strife, Rushed from their trackless lairs to burnâdespoilâ Butcher the cradled babe, the pleading wife; Then swept the nodding harvest from the soil, And scattered on the wind the fruits of patient toil. The marble of Pentelicus, whereon Exquisite taste majestically reared The polished columns of the Parthenon, By classic recollection is endeared; But when its grandeur is no more reveredâ Its peerless fabric gone,âthe storied rock On which our fathers landed, will be cheered By grateful voices; and the ruffian-shock Of billows, white with foam, its iron brow will mock. The Pilgrim Spirit faded not in night Like that misguiding lamp of frantic zeal That led crusaders forth, in banded might, To propagate christianity with steel, In distant Palestine, and roll the wheel Of bloody revolution: but its blaze Thick clouds of war and storm could not concealâ Round Lexington it poured undying rays, And shamed the boasted deeds of old baronial days. The Pilgrim Spirit! its converting power And potent sway are felt wherever man Is battling error in his hoary tower; And virtue in defiance of the ban Of popular opinion, leads the van In purging guilty earthâwhere freedom dares Unfurl his banner for the winds to fan; And his dread sabre for the conflict bares, Or, from despotic grasp, the rod of bondage tears. The Pilgrim Spirit on our noble frame Of government is written; for the road That broadly leads to honorable fame Lures humble merit from his rude abode, Though lowly-born, and fainting with a load Of wo and want, to struggle for the prize; And proudly tread where gifted Sherman trode, Or like great Franklin penetrate the skies, And strip the blinding veil from nature's mysteries. When the green, shrouding moss of time o'ercrept Mounds in the vale and on the mountain side, Where the stern founders of our empire slept, Improvement moving with gigantic stride Still hurried onward: patient labor plied The ringing axe; and from his old domain Fled drowsy solitude; while, far and wide, The scene grew bright with fields of golden grain, And orchards robed in bloom on hill and sunny plain. The wand of enterprise to queenly states Gave wondrous being; rivalling the spell That reared round Thebes a wall of many gates When proud Amphion swept his chorded shell, The tuneful gift of Hermes: pastoral bell, With tinkling murmurs, woke savannahs green, And roused wild echoes in the woody dell, Where late the cougar of terrific mien, Devoured the fawn, or rocked upon his perch unseen. With his penates, to the distant shores Of our broad western streams, Adventure hied, And pierced the soil for rich metallic ores, Or with a keen, prophetic vision spied An unborn mart upon the river-side; While traffic trimmed her bark to brave the gale, And met the terrors of a chartless tideâ In nameless havens furled her tattered sail, Or toward Pacific seas, pursued the red man's trail. The buskined lords of bow and leathern quiver Were thy admiring sponsors long ago, And named theeââGeneseeââmy native river, For pleasant are thy waters in their flow! Though on thy sides no bowers of orange grow, The free and happy in thy valley throng, O'er which the airs of health delight to blowâ No richer, brighter charms than thine belong To streams immortal made by proud Homeric song. Although thy tide that winds through pastures now, By fleecy flock and lowing kine is drank, A river of the wilderness wert thou, When mixed in deadly combat on thy bank, The yelling savage and impetuous Frank: Thy wave lifts up no mourning voice to tell Where the red, bubbling stream of carnage sank, When rattling gun, loud groan, and fiendish yell, Thy hollow murmur drowned, and gasping valor fell: And Nature, in the moss of time attired, On her green throne of forest sate, when came The host of Sullivan, with vengeance fired, To rouse upon thy shore the beast of game, And wrap the lodges of fierce tribes in flame, Fresh from unhappy Wyoming, and red With scalps of hoary age and childless dame: Gone from thy borders are the oaks that spread Their yellow autumn palls above the martial dead. Eastward the soldiers of that campaign bore Glad tidings of unpruned but pleasant lands, Washed by thy surges, like those spies of yore Who brought ripe grapes from Eshcol to the bands By Moses led across the desert sands. Regardless of the sons of Anak, soon Bold men of dauntless hearts, and iron hands Left home, while life was in its active noon, To hear the forest-wind thy flood's deep voice attune. They fled not, like scourged vassals in the night, From dungeon, rack, and chain, with footstep fleet: The halls of their nativity were bright, And fraught with recollections, fond and sweet, Of childish hours; and hearts that loved them beat Beneath their pleasant roofs:âforsaking allâ They roused the wood-wolf from his dim retreat, And boldly reared the gloomy cabin wall Of rude, misshapen logs, amid the forest tall. They little thought, while roving near the site Of thy proud City, Rochester. deafened by the sound Of waters tumbling from a fearful height, And darkened by the wilderness around, That soon its hollow roaring would be drowned By the deep murmur of the mighty crowd, Amid thick domes, with tower and turret crowned; The din of whirling ears, and clatter loud Of mills by human art with iron lungs endowed: Nor did they dream that, in communion grand, Broad Erie's wave, and Hudson's mighty tide, Within a channel shaped by mortal hand, Ere half a century elapsed, would glide: That soon fair Buffalo, in queenly pride, Would spring the Carthage of our inland seas, And wave her sceptre o'er the waters wideâ To shipping change the patriarchal trees, And launch a thousand barks to battle with the breeze. The foreign tourist, gazing on thy vale, By rural seat and stately mansion graced, Stands mute with wonder when he hears the tale Of thy redemption from the sylvan waste: That only fifty years their rounds have traced Since Phelps, the Cecrops of thy realm, forsook The peopled haunts of genius, art, and taste; While doubting friends with apprehension shook, And love upon his form fixed sad, regretful look. On the broad, green acclivities that round The lovely lake of Canandaigua rise, The groves in deep, majestic grandeur frowned, Hiding their gloomy secrets from the skies, And scarred and worn by storms of centuries, When painted hordes with streaming locks of jet, Terrific garb, and wildly glancing eyes, Him and his daring band in treaty met, Though late with Christian gore the tomahawk was wet. A magic mirror girt by emerald, In shade embowered, the diamond waters lay; While the proud eagle, king-like, fierce, and bald, Throned on the blasted hemlock, eyed his prey: Sweet wild-flowers, guarded from the blaze of day, Delicious odor on the soft air flung; And birds of varied note and plumage gay On shrubs and vines, with ripening berries hung, Folded their glittering wings, and amorously sung. The water ratâand darting otter swam Amid the reedy flags that fringed the shore; And the brown beaver to his rounded dam With patient toil, the tooth-hewn sapling bore. The lonely heron, surfeited with gore, Smoothed on the pebbly beach his plumage dank: Earth, sky, and wave an air of wildness wore, And nimbly down the green and sloping bank, Came stag and timid hind, on silver hoof, and drank. The pen of voiceful narrative may well, That solemn congress in the forest call A thrilling and romantic spectacle: The trunks of oaken monarchs, huge and tall, Were the rough columns of their council-hall; Thick bows were interwoven overhead, And winds made music with their leafy pall: Below, a tangled sea of brushwood spread, Through which, to far-off wild, the beaten war-path led. Few were the whites in number, and about The council fire were gathered dusky throngs From whose dark bosoms time had not washed out The bitter memory of recent wrongs. Some longed to wake their ancient battle songs, And on the reeking spoils of conflict gazeâ Bind the pale captive to the stake with thongs, And hellish yells of exultation raise, While shrivelled up his form, and blackened in the blaze. The compact for a cession of their land Was nearly ended, when a far-famed chief Rose with the lofty bearing of command, Though lip and brow denoted inward grief: Nought broke the silence save the rustling leaf And the low murmur of the lulling wave; He drew his blanket round him, and a brief, But proud description of his fathers gave, Then spoke of perished tribes, and glory in the grave. âAnd who be yeââhe said, in scornful tones, And glance of kindling hateââwho offer gold For hunting grounds made holy by the bones Of our great seers and sagamores of old? Men who would leave our hearths and altars coldâ Unstring the bow, and break the hunting spearâ Our pleasant huts with sheeted flame infold, Then drive our starving, wailing race in fear Beyond the western hills like broken herds of deer!â âWake, On-gue-hon-we! strike the painted post, And gather quickly for the conflict dire; Yon Long Knives are forerunners of a host Thick as the sparks when prairies are on fire: Let childhood grasp the weapon of his sireâ Arm, arm for deadly struggle, one and all, While wives and babes to secret haunts retire: The ghosts of buried fathers on ye call To guard their ancient tombs from sacrilege, or fall!â Dark forms rose up, and brows began to lower, While many a savage eye destruction glared; But one came forth in that portentous hour Ere shaft was aimed, or dagger fully bared, And hushed the storm:âold Honneyawus dared His voice upraise; and by his friendly aid The knife was sheathedâthe pioneer was spared. Above that humane warrior of the shade Let marble tell the tale in lines that cannot fade. Tribes of the solemn League! from ancient seats Swept by the whites like autumn leaves away, Faint are your records of heroic feats, And few the traces of your former sway; Loved woodland haunts, deep, shadowy and gray, No longer wave defiance to the roar And rush of whirlwinds 'mid their cool retreats; The wild beast harbors in their depths no more, And ploughmen turn the glebe they darkly clothed of yore. Tribes of the mighty! dwindled to a few, Dejected, trampled children of despair; And only like their ancestors in hue, And the wild beauty of their flowing hair; With laughter rude inquisitors lay bare The ghastly secrets of your green old graves, To moulder, peacemeal, in dissolving air; Forgetful of past glory, when your braves Surrounding nations made poor, weak, dependant slaves. Where are your hoary magiâwrinkled seersâ Clad in their dread apparelling, who made Rude, rocky altars, stained and mossed with years, And held terrific orgies in the shade? Where is the pliant oar of slender blade That urged the birchen vessel on the stream? Your council halls with cedar bark o'erlaid? Gone, like the shapes that populate a dream, Or twinkling dew drank up by morn's effulgent beam. And where those whooping legions, fierce and free, Who back the tide of French invasion bore, Defeating warriors trained beyond the sea, And bathing guarded Montreal in gore? Their day of power is ended, and no more Ring out their pÃ¦ans louder than the sound Of booming waters on an iron shore, While captive hundreds, bleeding, faint, and bound, Expire in flame, or fall transpierced by many a wound. Ye were wild Romans of this Western Land When the far parent of our inland seas Lake Superior. Beheld your bowmen print his barren strand Flushed with a thousand woodland victories; And heard the war-shout on his frosty breeze, While the red monarchs of the bleak domain Bowed to your fierce supremacy their knees; And when the scared Neperceneans of Maine Sought Hudson's icy bay to shun the captive chain. Where are your thrilling orators, who caught Their eloquence from nature, and allied Wild powers of fancy to the glow of thought, And grace of gesture to ancestral pride? Their sylvan voices on the wind have died: And your last master of the honeyed tone, Red Jacket. Commanding port and gesture dignified, No longer wails an empire overthrown, And near his couch of dust, Niagara makes moan. All hail our early settlers! though with storm Their sky of being was obscured and black, And Peril, in his most appalling form, Opposed their rugged march, and warned them back; They faltered not, nor fainted in the track That led to empire; but with patience bore Cold, parching thirst, and fever's dread attack; While ancient twilight, to return no more, From far Otsego fled to Erie's rock-bound shore. They toiled, though Hunger with his wasted mien, Stalked through their infant settlements, and night Lured from the gloomy cavern, gaunt and lean, Droves of disturbing wolves that hated light, Some wan and trembling mourner to affright With their dismaying howls, around the place Where, coldly still, and newly hid from sight, Earth folded loved ones in her damp embrace, Without recording tomb, their forest mounds to grace! From clearing rude, and dismal swamp undrained, Fumes of decaying vegetation rose; While the fell Genius of Distemper reigned, And filled the newly-opening realm with woes; Brave Manhood smitingâthough his lusty blows Tall ranks of warrior-oaks in dust had bowed,â And robbing widowed Beauty of her rose, Or weaving, while the voice of wail was loud, Round childhood, early-lost, the drapery of the shroud. On his low couch of suffering, ere death Cooled the mad fever of his throbbing vein, And hushed the hoarse, deep rattling of his breath, In dreams the settler homeward went again; And absent comrades of his youth, in vain, While sped the weary hours, invoked to quell The burning, beating pulses of his brain, And darkness from his blinded orbs dispel, In tones too wildly strange for words to picture well. Born in the lap of plenty and of wealth Mindless too oft are children of the sire Who purchased, at the fearful price of healthâ And even life, their heritage!âthe lyre Should call forth music from its proudest wire In praise of men who brave, to bless their kind, Tempest, the sword, foul pestilence and fire; Their names in grateful hearts should be enshrined, When crumbled are their bonesâtheir ashes on the wind: And those who left the venerated breast, And soil of proud New England, to reclaim Our smiling El Dorado of the West From centuries of gloom, and haunts of game Change to Arcadian loveliness, and tame The virgin rudeness of the shaded mould, Should not be unremembered:âon the same Eternal page where Fame, in lines of gold, Hath pilgrim virtue traced, their names should be enrolled. Their triumphs are around us:âlawn and mead, Spreading their verdant carpets far away Whereon the flock and lowing heifer feed, And the gay yeoman trills his rustic lay, Were hidden lately from the glance of day, And ranged by untamed animals of chase; While yon fair sheet of limpid waters lay, Known only to a roving hunter race, A bright, neglected gem within a desert place. Now, Art leaves shining footprints on the shore, And, âdancing to their own sweet minstrelsy,â The waves, like vassals, kiss the flashing oar That speeds the barge of commerce; while the sky Bends over domes that lift bright roofs on high, Raised by a spell than hers more wondrous far Who woke the seer at Endorâglancing eye Beholds no child of want, the scene to mar, And on no fairer spot look down sun, moon and star. Offspring of worthy sires! while wave and land To make ye blest their treasuries unlock, And glory beckons with inviting hand,â Cherish the graces of the parent stock. While shoal, entangling reef, and hidden rock Wreck nations floating on a factious sea, Too much abased to brave the whelming shock,â Here the bright wing of lordly thought is free, And no imbruted serf to pomp inclines the knee. Be Pioneers of mind! with glowing eye Pierce wilds of doubt, and streams of darkness ford; Within the boundless realms of knowledge lie Neglected gems in cave and grotto stored, Bright Cyprian Isles, and Edens unexplored! Those laurelled kings of science, who have won The highest peaks of wisdom, sloth abhorred: While birds of night the dazzling noontide shun, Young eagles flap the cloud, and look upon the sun. The world unfolds its portals! from the bowers Of cloistered learning go ye forth, while youth Wreathes round the brow a coronal of flowers, And far and wide extend the bounds of truth; Let not demoniac vice, with venomed tooth, Destroy ennobling principle, and nurse The germ of future crime, remorse and ruth; Bliss is the meed of virtue, but a curse Falls on the wretch who blights the Moral Universe. THE PROSPECTS OF THE AGE. READ BEFORE THE LITERARY SOCIETIES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT, AUGUST 3, 1841. While lettered idlers turn the mouldy page For dreamy records of a Golden Age, Ere the dark seed of mortal ill was sown, And crime and want and misery were knownâ When ancient Pan attuned his classic reeds, And faun and dryad danced on flowery meads; Regret the fate, with aspect cold and sour, That makes them insects of the present hour, Born like the leaf or herb to pass away, Heirs of disease and premature decay, Ours be the nobler task to scan aright The prospects opening in this AGE OF LIGHT. Now is the hallowed time!âfrom Heaven a voice Calls on the race of Adam to rejoice;â Roused by the glad, regenerating sound, The startled bondsman wakes, and looks around; While, one by one, the clouds begin to roll From the long veiled horizon of his soul, He asks his Lord, with stern, undaunted eye: âWhy chained these limbs, and thine unshackledâwhy? Alike the dusty atoms are that form Our grosser parts, my haughty brother worm! Alike the laws that govern our career From the low cradle to the darkened bier: Great, equal Nature, liberal to all, Pours the same radiance on the hut and hall, Decks in the same impartial green the mould Above the bones of king or beggar old, Sends the same airs of breathing balm to kiss The homeless outcast and the child of bliss, Nor glads the couch of down with dream more bright Than the coarse straw where poor men rest by night. Though storm and hardship have imbrowned my skin, Immortal longings multiply within, And the bright land that lies beyond the grave, Distinction knows not between prince and slave. Whence then thy right to rack my limbs with toil, And bear away the produce of the soil; Leave my poor babes in rags the blast to feel, Wet with hot tears their scant, unwholesome meal, And earthward, like the beasts that perish, gaze From springtime to the winter of their days? Whence, in assuming and insulting tones, Thy right to ask what God himself disowns? Lift while you may the scourge of high command, The fall of Guilt Anointed is at handâ Robbed millions on thy palace will have traced Their vow that man no more will be abased!â Thus mighty thought begins at last to shed Reviving beams upon the humblest head; Gives poor abused humanity a tongue, An eye to pierce the gloom around it flung, A breast of steel the conflict to abideâ Firm as the granite that beats back the tide. Though blind oppression marvels at the change Wrought in the mass, and deems it passing strangeâ Friends of the wronged and stricken wonder more That the good work did not progress before. What hear we but an outcry for redress Wrung from the broken heart of wretchedness; The loud demand of labor why it pines, And licensed fraud in glittering raiment shines; Of o'er-tasked sorrow why so dark its lot, And drunken sloth live on, and suffer not? Gray Error trembles in his cloudy hold To mark the banner of reform unrolled, Dreads, like some hermit-owl, one ray of light That glimmers through the pall of ancient night, Retaining still the mummery of sway While melts the substance of his power away. Vain his endeavor, in resentment blind, To crush the growing energies of mind; As well the reed might try to check the force Of the loud whirlwind in its rushing course, Or pattering rain essay to drown the roar Of ocean breaking on a rocky shore. Come will a day of jubilee ere long, When power will cease to legalize a wrong, When tottering kingcraft, to prolong its reign, Will point to ancient precedent in vain And laws enacted in a barbarous time Will cease to give authority to crime. Far back in years philosophy may date, While viewing man improved in his estate, The fair beginning of this war sublime Against corrupting usages of time. Thick clouds and darkness gloomed around our race, And peace, the dove, could find no resting place; Uncurbed Ambition gave his life to guiltâ Red Murder boasted of the blood he spiltâ By day fierce Rapine for his booty prowled, And Hell a note of exultation howledâ Nations and tribes, imbruted and despoiled, Like driven cattle for their tyrants toiled, When, lo! a Star of clear, benignant ray Rolled from the source of everlasting day, While brighter far than flash of jewel'd crown, Its full-orbed blaze on Galilee poured down. Before its golden pathway, like a dream, Fled the foul mist that rose to quench its beam. Oh, THEN commenced the long, unended fight Between the powers of darkness and of lightâ Then learned the pauper that his frame of earth Enshrined a living pearl of priceless worth, Formed to shine on, when dimmed the ruby red Worn by the great who gave him stone for bread! Oh, then more potent than the battle-storm, The gospel proved an agent of reform: Refreshed by draughts from its immortal fount Upward the human soul began to mount, And shook the dust from its immortal plume. Emerging from an atmosphere of gloom. Heaved, like the sea, the bosom of the massâ Bands from the spirit fell like shivered glass; Hope, from the house of mourning doomed to roam, Found in the broken heart once more a home; Balm in the wound of misery was poured, Cleansed was the leper, and the lost restored; Strong grew the weakâthe lame arose and walked, Their sight the blind received, the voiceless talked. Christ sought nor tower, nor palace-hall, nor throne To make his high, divine commission known; An honored vessel, in his cause to aid, Of meek, neglected lowliness he made, And chose unlettered champions to confound Dissembling sophist, and the sage renowned. While spake his clear, melodious voice THE WORD, The poor, in deep, respectful silence heard, Though haughty ruler, pharisee and scribe Their scorn evinced by taunt and heartless jibe. Plumed Pomp contemned a teacher and a guide Who taught our world the nothingness of pride, Divested him, though magnet of all eyes, Of florid mask and fanciful disguise, Then oped the portals of his heart of sin, And proved though fair without, how foul within! Rapacious Power could ill a teacher brook Who heeded not the terror of his look, Nor prized his rod of regal office more Than crutch of crippled vagrant at his door; Whose wondrous love, within no bound confined, Embraced the high and low of human kindâ Whose doctrines tended to redeem the slave Lost in the midnight of a moral grave, And clear his clouded vision to behold How vile the wretch to whom his flesh was sold! Though oft in huts where penury abides, A famished wretch the hunted felon hides, And fallen manhood, charged with liquid fire, On injured woman vents his brutal ire, Or tattered frenzy stalks, of wasted form, Beneath a roof that ill keeps out the storm; Oh, seldom there, with dark, despairing eye, Is found the fiend of infidelity. Among the poor, degraded, and untaught Our Savior's grandest miracles were wrought; Called by his voice, the widowed one of Nain Beheld her tomb-robed child arise again. He came in light to cheer the saddest hearth, And banish inequalities from earth; No right of primogeniture he knew Nor wall that hedged the many from the few; All with their Maker's breathing image stamped, Upon earth's common battle-ground encamped, From kingly Saul to Lazarus despised, Alike by his impartial heart were prized. Those born beneath a more auspicious star, Who journey on in fortune's dazzling car, Too oft by pleasures of the world enslaved, Frame creeds to suit an appetite depraved. Awhile their frail mortality forget, And deem no limit to their glory set. Another class, with pride of knowledge filled, On crumbling sand their airy systems build, And oft, with foolish and derisive smile, A fiction old, that sacred volume style. Ye learned in vain! Your eyes on nature turn, And from her page one truthful lesson learn! Look on that field of ripe and waving corn, Swept by the breeze, and colored like the mornâ Behold ye not how proudly from the mould, Rise the light stalks that bear no ears of gold, While others, burthened with the precious grain, Kiss with their tasselled garniture the plain! Though high your heads in arrogance are raised, False, fleeting lights, to lure ye on, have blazedâ For ye in vain hath burned the midnight oil, Chaff is the product of your lettered toil; With the meek temper of a sinless child, Again peruse the book ye have reviled, And see through clouds a SUN that never sets, While wisdom deep humility begets. The common people of our world have caught From HOLY WRIT the quenchless fires of thought: Learned that terrestrial grandeur is a shade, And that all things for CÃ¦sar were not made. Gone are those evil days when tyrants sealed The lip of woe, and wrong went unrevealed; When the spurned vassal, cursing in despair A yoke that nature could no longer bear, Was gravely charged with treason, foul and black, And mangled by the headsman or the rack. The plundered thunder execration now When robbers gather where they do not plough, Nor stand in fear of torture or the block Though rotten thrones to their foundations rock. âOur bread is taxedââsays oneââby drones we feed! In war our veins, to pamper villains, bleed!â Exclaims anotherââUp, ye sons of toil, And sweep the greedy locusts from the soil! Why looks yon titled fopling down in scorn On the brown yeoman who is cottage-born, And envies him his share of sunshine mildâ Was not the Bard of Ayr a peasant's child, And poor the mother who, delighted, heard Her infant Shakespeare breathe his earliest word? While rolls the sluggard in his coach and four, Shall famine enter honest labor's door? No! on the wings of mighty winds send forth The seed of freedom, and enfranchise earth!â In frozen climes, and under tropic skies, Up the bruised victims of injustice rise, To rend the shackles that their fathers wore, Roused by a voice that thundersââSleep no more!â In lone and far-off islands of the brine Dull night beholds her ancient sway decline, Alarmed, forsakes her couch of hoary moss While christians plant the banner of the Cross. The fires of human sacrifice are quenched, Purged are the tribes in carnage lately drenched; Foul shrines and broken images of stone Fall while the trump of Calvary is blown; No more the war-note of the conch is heard While savage forms for murderous conflict gird; His dread repast the cannibal abjures To bathe in bright, atoning blood that curesâ Looks on the star that to a Savior leads, And with the bread of life his spirit feeds. Be hushed, ye pale alarmists of the day, Who look on man, awaking, with dismay, Then lift your croaking voices, and oppose Bold hearts who dare to tyranny be foes! In vain ye toil to fetter pen and speechâ Long since exploded was the creed ye teach, That human nature is in essence, vileâ Lawless, when freeâwhen trusted, full of guile; When honored, vicious, and no worse, enslavedâ False when refined; intelligent, depraved, And only harmless when by fear restrained, From youth to age in base submission trained. While ye are struggling with innoxious rage, To fetter down the spirit of the age, Think of the lesson taught us by the Dane, Who breathed his mandate to the bellowing main; On swept the waters in their sandy track, Though waved his puny wand to roll them back! Look on our fair Republic of the West, And know the question settled, and at rest, Regarding man's capacity on earth To rise progressive in the scale of worth! Who were the fathers of our country?âmen Who bearded the grim Lion in his den, Nor feared his fang, nor trembled at his roar, Although his bristling main was steeped in gore. Corruption in high places they assailed, And the vile tricks of hollow courts unveiled:â High Priests of independence, here they found Hesperian groves where man might walk unbound! Green Mountain Boys! I know that ye are proud Of these rude peaks that rise to kiss the cloud, For on New-England's rocky shrine first blazed The fiery column by the Pilgrim raised: With Allen's rifle and the shaft of Tell Guard through the coming years that beacon well! Here sons of genius, though in hovels bred, Bright paths that lead to posts of honor tread: Fame open flings his temple-gate full wide, And merit enters unappalled by pride, Albeit he frowns and turns a âshoulder cold,â As if his flesh was formed of rarer mould. Not on light sand-hills of the desert waste Our fabric of Free Government is based, But on the rock of public virtue rests, Its shield a breathing wall of free-born breasts. Our future, pregnant with sublime events, Will gladden seas, and isles, and continents, And realms, at last, will flourish uncontroll'd By sceptered things whose âgods are blood and gold.â Unbar the gloomy portals of the pastâ How red the shroud round perished Empire cast! Thick as the bearded grain by Labor mown, Lie bannered hosts in battle overthrown. From cottage homes and thronging cities rise Yells of expiring millions to the skies. Ambition, pleased, bemocks their horrid groans, And, shod with iron, treads on crumbling bones. Tasked is the strength of thousands to upbuild Colossal tombs with coffined grandeur filled. The place of beast by manhood is supplied, Whipped onward, harnessed to the car of Prideâ Foul Priestcraft, mantled in an ebon stole, Abroad walks forth with blood upon his soul; Clasps his polluted hands in Godless prayer While tortures rend the sinews of despair, Or, with disdain in his relentless eye, Exacts the little all of misery. Anointed Folly from his regal seat Points to proud arch, or labyrinth of Crete, As monuments to memorize his sway When kingdom, crown, and court have passed away. Renowned Apelles prostitutes his art Esteem to wake within a tyrant's heartâ Wit wildly revels in the joys of sense, And terror chains the tongue of eloquence. No voice, inspired, the cause of justice pleads, Or God invokes to punish evil deeds: A venal harp the laurelled minstrel strings To flatter pomp and win applause from kings, And pensioned learning false deduction draws, To prove that Nero sanctions wholesome laws. Here prowls unsparing bigotry at work, In her ensanguined hand a sheathless dirk. Her deedsâtoo dreadful for the lyre to tellâ Her dooming eyeââa glimmering type of Hell.â There laughs the lord who governs half the globe, Wrapped in the foldings of his purple robe, While bounds the famished lion from his den Matched in unequal strife with naked men, And corpses cumber, half afloat in gore, The broad arena's thickly sanded floor. Another leaf in history is turnedâ Another lesson have the nations learned; Clouds, charged with moral lightning, sternly lower Above the heartless satellites of Powerâ The Mother-land by crime too long defiled, Is taking healthful counsel from her Child, And, one by one, from her old bleeding heart The greedy vultures of misrule depart. One wild misnomer of the mournful past, That led our sires astray, is changed at last; Conquest, enthroned on heaps of slain up piled, Is rebaptized, and wholesale murder styled. No common cause now hurries to the field A Christian soldier, armed with spear and shield And empires ponder patiently and long, Before they war for some imagined wrong. With grave rebuke Philosophy looks down On that dread phantom, National Renown, Whose star hath lighted nations to their graves, And flooded groaning Earth with crimson waves. Green Erin lifts her head above the deep, Roused from the torpor of her drunken sleep, And tunes the harp of Tara to a lay That breathes of joy, and darkness chased away. Late through her isle a demon strode unchecked Who laughed while round him were her children wrecked; Of human skulls a hideous throne he made, And woe, disease, and death his call obeyedâ In dungeon, churchyard, and on scaffold grim Courts, that make manhood blush, were held by him, And Mars, astonished, flung away his lance, Eclipsed in horror by Intemperance. Now, from her fields a triumph cry goes up, Indignant hands dash down the poisoned cup; Away dark weed from Emmett's grave she clears, A radiant smile is beaming through her tears, And, while the brand of Cain her brow forsakes, The withe that bound her limb, like Samson, breaks. Right, reason, and religion have combined Vice to denounce, and purify mankind. Not the blind impulse of a mob impels The public heart that glows, and heaves, and swells, Engendering acts of outrage and of shame, With ruin fraught, and terrible to name. A spirit, by philanthropy approved, Glides calmly on and multitudes are moved: It makes no mad appeal to carnal force, Nor speeds by war companioned in its course, While follow wolves and ravens to devour Dismembered fragments of the battle hour; Plays not the Teian with existence brief, Pleased with an odorous rose, or myrtle leaf, While locust-swarms, that sky and air imbrown, On the green fields of bliss are settling down. It asks not for political success That props the strongâgives wealth a gayer dress; On outward, cold magnificence depends, And only comfort to the happy sends; That boasts of steeds, caparisoned and fleet, Whirling the car of triumph through the street, Of temple, column, pile, and massive dome, Though Peace, like Judah, roves without a home; But that perfection in the social plan Which throws an Ã¦gis o'er degraded man, Diffusing light throughout the common herd, While grief's black depths are to the bottom stirred Love for our dying brotherhood it feels, To common sense and equity appeals; Explores each haunt where lust the wine-cup quaffs, And o'er the corse of ruined beauty laughs; Tracks human sorrow to its fountain springsâ Ill-gotten gold from hard extortion wrings; Locks with a touch dark slander's perjured lips, And thin disguise from base pretension strips; A lamp of safety fashions for the mine, And airs the work-shop where Earth's orphans pine Gives fiery pinions to an iron steed, A rival of the thunderbolt in speed; Charters the sun-beam faithfully to trace A breathing outline of the human face; Launches strange barks, defying wind and flood, To make of earthly realms, one neighborhood; Goes on a quest of mercy to the cell Where pale remorse anticipates his knell; Denies the right of ermined law to doom A felon, even, to an early tomb, Tall gibbet rear, or scaffold redly drench, And fires, that God can only kindle, quench. It scans the future with prophetic gaze, And whispers promise of millennial days, When man will tread on flowers, that know not frost, Perfumed like those that graced his Eden lost; And wear, unsullied by one leprous stain, His crown of primal innocence again, Dashed from his lustrous and majestic brows, While yet his lip was warm with broken vows. Truth, beaten down on many a luckless field, Bears now this stern device upon her shieldâ âAway with sleep, while bigot, knave, and fool Sit throned with high, exclusive right to rule!â Though black and adverse flags are on the blast, How can she fail of victory at last! Cased is her towering form in burnished mail, Proof against rust, barbed lance, and iron hailâ Timed is her march to battle by the sound Of golden harps, the throne of God around, And, tempered with pure lightning from the sky, Flames the charmed weapon that she lifts on high. Brothers, a word!âFrom quiet, classic bowers, Where long our hands have cropped immortal flowers, With ears accustomed only to the flow Of silver, welling waters, forth we go! Soon will the rushing surge of active life Greet our approach with roar that tells of strifeâ Envenomed monsters, hungering for their prey, Paths that our feet must follow now, waylay; Our moral armor we must well inspect, Nor antedate our ruin by neglect: Oh! cease we never to guard well the fires Thas lit the bosoms of our Saxon sires, And while we rove, by gales of fortune blown, From the parched tropic to the frozen zone, Glassed in the wave of memory, clear and deep, Bright let each heart New-England's image keep! Her vales forget not, and her mountain peaks Round which the cloud revolves, the eagle shrieksâ Where Beauty dwells, and intellect conforms, In strength and grandeur, to her rocks and storms, And reigns Religion, 'mid a world of woes, Pure as her streams and spotless as her snows. On us, in pleading tone, our Alma calls Never to shame her consecrated hallsâ To banish serpent-passion from our hearts, And, in the cause of right, play noble parts, While round our steps celestial light is shed, And sleep in honored sepulchres when dead. HISTORIC SCENES. INSCRIBED TO HON. JOHN BRODHEAD, NEW YORK. THE SHADE OF THEODOSIUS. [âConstans II. retained a jealous fear, lest the people should one day invade the right of primogeniture, and seat his brother on an equal throne. By the imposition of holy orders the grandson of Heraclitus was disqualified for the purple; but the ceremony was insufficient to appease the suspicions of the tyrant; and the death of Theodosius could not expiate the crime of his royal birth. His murder was avenged by the imprecations of the people, and the assassin went into voluntary exile. The remorse of his conscience created a phantom, who pursued him, by day and by night; and the visionary Theodosius presenting to his lips a cup of blood, said, or seemed to say, âDrink, brother, drink.ââ] Gibbon's Decline and Fall. From his pale brow the diadem he tore, And with a look of fear expressive, then Aside the purple robe of Empire flung. The watchful sentry of the palace gave No warning sign of danger lurking near, And visible was naught that could awake Within the bosom of a timid child One thrill of dread. As if communing with Unearthly forms, the Ruler of proud Rome Like some enchanter, wildly gazing, stood Pale and affrighted by his own creations. The start convulsive, and the trembling frame, Bespoke the fearful tempest of the soul; And oft his throbbing brow he fiercely smote, For memory was working madness there. In his own shadow breathing life he saw, And the soft music of the summer winds, That like a spirit through the lattice stole, Gave to his hollow cheek a deadlier hue. His long, loose locks were prematurely gray, And gone for ever was the bearing high That one beseems invested with stern power. He spake at length, as if his ashy lips The fearful secret could no longer guard, In the wild tones of agony and guilt: âGrim Phantom! quit my sightâ To me extend not that appalling bowl! Its crimson contents cannot make my soul From torture free and white: Malignant smiles upon thy face appear, As if exulting in my mortal fear. âWilt thou confront me yetâ Still fix on me thy wild, terrific gaze, And to my lips again the chalice raise With slaughter warm and wet? Depart, depart! thou wan, unbidden guest, And with the secrets of the charnel, rest! âWhen mingling with the gay, Thy presence chills the life-drops in each vein, And thou art with me on the tented plain When hosts my nod obey: Thy presence chases slumber from mine eye When night in sable robes the earth and sky. âUnseen by other men, Thou art my pale attendant in the halls Where ring with song and merriment the wallsâ And thou art with me when Poor, crouching vassals gather in the street, And thousands fall in homage at my feet. âUpon a distant shore, Across the wide expanse of waters blue, In vain methought affrighted I should view Thine awful face no more; Clad in the vestments of the starless grave Thy spectral form went with me o'er the wave. âAh! noiseless is thy tread When thou art stealing fiercely by my side Through the dark chambers of this dome of pride, Bearing the goblet red. Oft I behold with horror on the floor Thy gliding feet leave tracks of smoking gore. âLeave me one hour alone! My knife long since drank purple from thy veins, Through fear thy hand would take away the reins Of empire from mine own; I could not bear to even dream thy brow Would wear the crown I cast far from me now. âThe shroud that wraps thy form Moves not when winds are sporting with my locks, And thy tall, ghastly figure likewise mocks The fury of the storm; I have beheld thee standing on the wave As if the chainless rover was thy slave. âSuppress those hollow sighs! And let thy brow a milder aspect wear; My stout frame withers in the fiendish glare Of those dark, searching eyesâ Recall once more the rose-flush to thy cheek, And in the sweet tones of forgiveness speak. ââDrink, royal brother, drink,â Is thy sole answer, while the gory chalice Recalls a deed of blood in my own palaceâ This wasting form will sink Ere long, unlighted by the frost of Time, Beneath the weight of agony and crime. âOh, brandish not the steel That won for me the name of âFratricide,â But throw away that weapon, redly dyed. Dizzy and faint I feel! Ha! fleshless arms my reeling form upholdâ Loose, loose me, brother, for thy grasp is cold!â Of what avail are counterfeited smiles That light the haggard face of hiding guilt! On scorching brain and heart there is a worm That darkly feeds until the tongue at last Proves traitor to the secret, and proclaims The horrid truth:âthat worm is keen Remorse! LAMENT OF PERICLES. [âPericles neither wept, nor performed any funeral rites, nor was he seen at the grave of any of his nearest relations, until the death of Paralus, his last surviving son. This at last subdued him. He attempted, indeed, then, to keep up his usual calm behavior and serenity of mind; but in putting the garland upon the head of the deceased, his firmness forsook him. He could not bear the sad spectacle, and broke out into loud lamentation.â] Plutarch. Chide not these tears! my fondest hopes are blighted, And life henceforward will a burthen be; Chill airs of death at length have disunited The noblest scion from its parent tree: Beneath yon dark and veiling pall extended, The pallid wreck of youth and beauty lies, The quick pulsation of that breast is ended, And light hath early faded from those eyes. While sadly gazing on those darksome tresses That still their silken loveliness retain, I feel once more his passionate caresses, And hear that lip breathe melody again. Lost boy! my days, hereafter, will be clouded, For grief is deeply rooted in my breast; While gazing on thee, pale and darkly shrouded, I almost envy thy unbreathing rest. The voice of grief falls on that ear unnotedâ Those arms will wreathe around my neck no more; The face of him on whom my bosom doated Wears not the look of earthliness it wore. I little thought while summer winds were drying The childish tear upon thy dimpled cheek, Soon, like the work of some rare sculptor lying, Mine eyes would gaze upon thy corse, young Greek. Unfeeling tyrant! when the smile is brightest, Why call away the beautifully fair? Why still the pulses when the step is lightest, And wretched leave the bowed and gray of hair? Ah! the last blossom of my house is faded, And the cold sternness of my look hath fled; The pale sepulchral chaplet I have braided Around the icy temples of my dead. MOORISH MEMORIES. SUGGESTED BY A TILE FROM THE ALHAMBRA. An hour of precious romance, I owe, my friend, to thee, And on the wings of Fancy my spirit crossed the sea; The same transporting magic did to thy gift belong That sparkled in Aladdin's Lamp, old theme of Eastern song! An Andalusian summer clad earth in brightest guiseâ Gave dark green to the foliage, deep azure to the skies, And sternly mountain-barriers uprear'd their crests of snow, While palace-spire and minaret flashed at their feet below. Approached by winding avenues, Granada lay in sightâ Gay pleasure-ground and gardens basked in the dazzling light; To groves of palm and cypress flocked birds of plumage rare, And happy genii were afloat upon enchanted air. Throned on a height commanding the Darro's vale of flowers, I saw the red Alhambra's tall battlements and towers; Oh! would that mine were language to paint its pictured walls, Its colonnades and court-yards, its galleries and halls. Methought the dreams of childhood were realized at last, And magic hands uplifted a pall that hid the past, While looking on its panels with colored stone inlaid, And alabaster vases on which the sunbeam played. In gem-embroidered caftan, and grave with cares of state, Dispensing equal justice, a king was at the gateâ The hajib Prime Minister. was in waiting, to hear his high command, And in the foreground gathered proud nobles of the land. Luxurious rooms I entered through quaintly carven doors, And trod on fretted pavements and tesselated floors; And in secluded chambers for beauty's use designed, On gorgeous silken cushions voluptuous forms reclined. To win their smile full often had gallant cavaliers Met with a shock, like thunder, at the Tournament of Spears, And all had won the homage by Love and Valor paid, When, under moon-lit balconies, awoke the serenade. Xariffa, rose of sunsetâZorayda, star of dawn! Ye never can be numbered with things of beauty gone; Poetical embalmment bestows a glorious light, That frights away the minions of darkness, dust, and blight. Umbrageous courts I traversed, where lime and orange grew, And fig and date their shadows on beds of roses threw, Then bathed in perfumed waters, and listened to the sound Of singing founts diffusing grateful coolness round. While silvery Xenil wandered through blooming bower and plain, Back came once more the splendor of Moorish rule in Spain: I heard the stormy clarion, the atabal's deep roll, And felt the joy of battle awake within my soul. Elvira's gates unfolded, and, grim with many a scar, A host of Moorish horsemen rode fiercely forth to war; The standard of the prophet above them was unrolled, And dallied with the lifting wind its green and golden fold. Gemmed saddle-cloth and armor were blinding to the gaze, And burnished lance and scimetar flashed back the sun-beam's blaze, While prancing in the van, as if their nostrils scented gore, The milk-white steeds of Yemen, king, sheik and emir bore. When fled that martial pageant, like vapor on the gale, Woke on the banks of Darro a startling voice of wail, And tones so full of sweetness, and wild, despairing woe, Were never heard by listening ear from mortal lips to flow. COSMO. AN ITALIAN SKETCH. One morn the Princes from the wall Took down the weapons of the chase, And issued from the ducal hall, Their sinews in the hunt to brace. The mother with an anxious eye Beheld her manly sons depart, And vainly strove to quell the sigh, For grief was heavy at her heart. She saw them ere they went away, The tangled wild and glen to range, By frowns their settled hate betray, And looks of stern resolve exchange. When gently on the land and flood The dusky veil of eve was thrown, The youngest hunter from the wood With horn and hound came back alone. The stain of purple on the hilt Of his keen dirk suspicion woke; His looks expressive were of guilt, Though in a mirthful tone he spoke. When loudly questioned why he came Without his brother, he replied, âI left him still pursuing game, Alive and well, ere eventide.â A band of liegemen, tried and true, The ducal palace left at night, And vainly warning bugle blew To guide their absent prince aright. Within the forest, lying dead, The missing one at last was found; And damp with slaughter was his bed, Upon the dark and trampled ground. Duke Cosmo, when the tidings came, His fingers clenching, smote his brow, And spake, while horror shook his frame, âMy fondest hopes are blasted now! His body to that chamber bear, Where hang the portraits of my race; Andâmark meâhide with utmost care Stiff limbs and cold distorted face.â His princely garb the father rent, And long and bitterly he wept; Then slyly to that chamber went Wherein the guilty hunter slept: The mourner wiped his tearful eyesâ The storm of grief had made them dimâ And calmly bade the youth arise, And from the chamber follow him. The wretched parent led the way With hurried stride to that dread room, In which the lifeless brother lay, Wrapt in the raiment of the tomb. The slayer by the hand he took And fixed on him a dark keen eye, But in his quietude of look No trace of terror could espy. His arm uplifting, Cosmo cried, âAffect not calmness, guilty youth! Or fruitless efforts make to hide From God and man the awful truth: Add not to thy foul crime deceit, But rather deeply feel remorse.â Then, lifting up the gory sheet, Unfolded to his view the corse. âWild frenzy should consume thy brain While gazing on that ghastly brow, And blood should curdle in each veinâ Can thy lips guard the secret now?â How still he lies! upon his flesh The worm will soon in darkness feed: Those gaping wounds that bleed afresh Disclose the author of the deed! âTo me address no vain appeal! Fix not on me that pleading eye! Thy doom is written on the steel That drank his bloodâand thou must die! Last of my house, my only one! Stern justice claims atoning goreââ Deep struck the father, and the son Fell gasping on the marble floor. Fond, gentle mother of the slain! For thee it was a fearful nightâ The fire of madness scorched thy brain, And fiends howled round thee to affright When morning tipped the hills with flame, And flushed the waves that slept below, Death, like a kind deliverer, came, To free thee from thy sumless woe. ZILLAH. [FRAGMENT OF A JEWISH TALE.] INSCRIBED AS A MEMORIAL OF LONG AND FAITHFUL FRIENDSHIP TO MY ESTEEMED TOWNSMAN, WILLIAM C. HAWLEY, ESQ. [âA Saracen Captain sailing from a port in Spain captured a vessel having on board several Jews of distinction, among whom were a young man and his wife, a woman of exquisite beauty. Having received some insults from the Captain, she asked, âShall those who are drowned in the sea revive at the Resurrection?â She was answered in the words of the Psalmist: âThe Lord said, I will bring again from the depths of the sea;â and she immediately flung herself into the waters.â]â Jus Regium Hebr. The din of conflict ceased;âon high Dark clouds ascended from the main As if to robe the vaulted sky In mourning vesture for the slain Who late with exultation heard The soul-arousing signal word Go up, when met the hostile ships, In thunder from a thousand lips: Who lately, prodigal of life, Moved sharers in the gory strife, While Havoc shook his wings of flame, And Death, in terror shrouded, came. No sheet, within its tarry fold, Wraps mournfully their bodies cold; Nor yew, nor solemn cypress throws Sepulchral gloom where they repose. For ever deaf to boatswain call They sleep in Ocean's charnel-hall, And monarch waters, in their might, Above them roll with crowns of white. No eye shed tributary tear When darkly ended their career, Nor were the brave âwith dirges dueâ Committed to the waters blue. Far from the quiet hearths of home The blood of sire and brother gave Deep tints of crimson to the foam That crested fearfully the wave. War furled his wing:âthe Infidel His ocean conquest dearly bought, For in the hour of trial well The sons of Israel had fought. The cry, âour hold a leak has sprung!â In them, though shroud in tatters hung, And reeling deck was strewn with dead, Had woke no unresisting dread. Despair, in that appalling hour, Had nerved the feeble frame with power, And, with the strength of manhood, strung The untried sinews of the young. When the tall mainmast, like some oak, Uprooted by the whirlwind, fell, In stern defiance through the smoke Had rang their battle yell. Admiring Athens deified Such children in her day of might, And Fame inscribed their names, allied To daring, with a look of pride, Upon her tablets bright: And worthy would have been such sons Of Judah, when her mighty ones, With MaccabÃ¦us in the van, Smote down the vaunting Syrian; Or in that hour when Jew of old Proud Rome with desperation met, While, red with slaughter, Kedron roll'd And charging shouts shook Olivet. It is a melancholy sight To see that bird of regal sway Who holds, in dazzling realms of light, Proud converse with the King of Day, By shaft of hunter wounded lie, With ruffled plume and closing eye, On common earth far, far below His throne where Alpine blossoms grow:â It is a melancholy sight To mark the hungry raven hover, When ended is the stormy fight, Above the father, friend, or lover; To see, unmindful of the rein, The gallant steed, with nostril spread, And gore-drops clinging to his mane, In death extended on the plain That echoed to his tread, When hills sent back the charging cheer, And sunlight shone on casque and spear: But far more saddening to the view To scan some ship bereft of sail, Deserted by her hardy crew, And drifting wildly with the gale. One gazing on that floating wreck Bethinks him sadly of the day When hundreds stood upon the deck, And winds made glad her way;â When weeping on some distant shore Stood faithful wife and sylph-like maid To see the flying bark, that bore Their loved ones, in the distance fade. While that lone wreck with riven sides Dismasted on the billow rides, The trembling gazer asks the main To tell her history in vainâ In fancy vieweth wan Despair Cling wildly to the broken mast, While wreaths of foam bedeck his hair, And sweeps in terror by the blast. Where are the barks that lately gave A ruddy radiance to the wave, While the stern voice of War from sleep Awoke the monsters of the deep? One floats with helm and cordage gone, And deck in carnage deeply dyed, Unguided through the sea whereon She lately rode a thing of pride: With spar of strength, and mast that vies In grace the palm, the other flies, And proudly on the water flings The shadow of her mighty wings. The dolphin, in her dazzling track, Comes up to âbare his golden back,â And with the rustling of her shroud The white surge blends its murmur loud. With glance, expressive of command, Her turbaned captain waves his hand, And, courted by the whistling gale, Streams haughtily the crescent pale. Rich goods and bags of Jewish gold Are lying in her darksome holdâ Ferocious is the chief, whose sway The tenants of that ship obey; On his forbidding brow and cheek Deep scars his bloody trade bespeak. With hasty stride and eye of fire He walks the deck in proud attire; A scarlet turban, fringed with gold, Begirds his brow with silken foldâ Beneath his oriental vest With jewels sparkling heaves a breast Wherein compassion never dwelt, That never thrill of terror felt. One gazing on his swarthy face The darkness of the soul would trace, And inly whisper:ââNot more vain Would be petition to the main, When tempest-sprites their wings unfold, And revel on his bosom hold, Than wild appeal to him for life From lip of foeman in the strifeââ The crooked weapon at his side His arms in many a fight hath tried, And never more unsparing sword Drank blood in grasp of ocean lord. At times he cast his vengeful eye Upon a group of captives nigh, Replying to the word of fear, And anguished cry with brutal jeerâ Surveying chain-encircled limb, And gaping wound with visage grim, Then murmuring with purpose darkâ âA pretty banquet for the shark!â Or drowning with his crew in song The wailing of the captive throng. SONG. We lead not the life of the slave, We fear not the frown of a king; But free as the foam-crested wave We wander like birds on the wing Our foemen, though valiant, despair When our ebony hull is descried; The streamers we give to the air, In the purple of conquest are dyed. We exult when the signal is made To clear our broad deck for the strife! We exult when the gleam of each blade Is dim with the red tide of life. We had rather have Ocean our grave Than, Earth, in thy bosom repose! For a shroud the white foam of the wave, And sleep where the red coral grows. ... Amid the sad, desponding crowd Yon matron mark of bearing proudâ Her regal spirit scorns to show Submission to the Paynim foe; No outward sign betrays the storm That rages inwardly; her form Is like the work of sculptor rare, Or shape that haunts the poet's dreamâ Inwoven with her sable hair Gems of transparent lustre gleam, The coral beads are dull in hue Contrasted with her lip of dew; Her robes with diamond lustre blaze, But her dark eye has brighter raysâ Their lids, by tear unwet, proclaim That courage nerves her fairy frameâ While gazing on the pirate chief, Her looks are unallied to grief; The face of Judith when she bent To dye her snowy hand in gore Above the victim in his tent, A like expression wore. While sullen clang of iron gyves From manly cheek the color drives, Her features, beautifully fair, The flush of indignation wear. While startling peals of corsair mirth In other hearts to fear give birth, With frown that would befit a queen When murmurs rise from subject hands, And lordly anger in her mien The lovely Jewess stands Strong in affection by the side Of one whose glances seem to say, âYon waves that now so gently glide, Ere long will clap their hands, my bride, Above their unresisting prey!â One month on fleeting wing hath flown Since Zillah gave her heart to him Whose soul was kindred to her own; And fancied, in the future dim, She saw beneath a cloudless sky The sea of life untroubled lie, While on its breast a graceful pair Their barks to blissful ports were steering, With features by the hand of care, And touch of time, undimm'd appearing. She thought not on her bridal day, As mirth within her breast held sway, That blight would ever mar the rose Expanding in the light of loveâ That waves of trouble soon would close Her radiant dreams of bliss aboveâ While uttering the marriage vow In accents passionately sweet, The light of joy was on her brow, And thrillingly her pulses beat. No Sibyl of the future threw Athwart her path one darkling shade, Proclaiming that the rainbow hue Of cherub Hope too soon would fade. No warning voice rang in her ear, âThy horoscope is overcastâ The time of agony is nearâ Thy dreams are fated not to last!â While leaning fondly on her lord, Whose ear drank in each honeyed word, Unto her lips she little thought The minister of ill would raise His cup with deadly poison fraught, In the glad spring-time of their days ... Morn on the mighty deep! from rest Light winds awake his billowy breast, And sunlight, on the plumy snow Of Ocean, flings a crimson glow. Thy waters wide, majestic sea! Roll onward with a voice of glee, When dawning gilds with radiant glance The beauty of thy broad expanseâ When blushing morn looks fondly down On isles, green jewels in thy crown, Whose shores are musical with birds That feed upon thy scaly herds. Strange shapes to hail the first bright streak In throngs the upper waters seek With plashing fin, in mimic strife, As if they felt a newer life. Morn on the waves! yon gallant bark Whose hull is ominously dark, Moves bird-like on the heaving waste, As if to reach her port in haste. The subject waters seem to say That dash against her sides in spray, âProud Queen, submissively we feel The touch of thy dividing keel!â As if rejoicing that old Night No longer veils the foamy seas, Exultingly her wings of white Are flapping in the breeze. Who would not think, while in her course Yon vessel spurns the billows hoarse, And walks the deep, a thing of grace, Swift as the charger in the race, While welkin blue and gilded brine Of coming ill disclose no sign, That hearts with happiness replete For such a vessel would be meet? Ah, sunlight often robes the sky When storms and death are lurking nighâ Oft crouching in the thicket green The panther marks his prey unseen; The rose, within its inmost fold, The dark, devouring worm may hide, And grace may fashion in her mould Things to impurity allied. Mild autumn like a mourner grieves For all things withering away, While robes of loveliness she weaves That vie in tint the close of day; And dying beauty on her cheek Too often wears deceptive glow, When pulse is tremulously weak, And hollow is the voice and low. Yon vessel, moving with the speed Of falcon by the keeper freed, When, startled by the tramp of feet, The heron leaves his lone retreat, Bears one upon her deck whose soul Is dark, unlike his own bright clime, And outlaws own his stern control Who daily quaff at founts of crime. Strong men, with hearts about to break, And tender wives, with features wan, Are gazing on her snowy wake Empurpled by the smile of dawn It is the bark that Zillah bearsâ She stands amid yon captive crowd, Her pallid countenance still wears An aspect of endurance proud. While others raise the cry of wail, And clank in agony their chains, The peerless subject of my tale To give her sorrow voice, disdains In the pale beauty of her face Observant eye can changes trace, While speakingly her glances show The beautifying power of woe. The spectral outlines of her frame Grief's desolating touch proclaimâ Though hum of insect in the glade, Or dash of wavelet, plumed with foam, In better days her bosom made, Of pleasant thoughts, the angel homeâ In vain, in vain, the swelling sea, And lulling winds that gently stir The canvas with a voice of glee, Awake their minstrelsy for her. Ah, joys that once illumed her brow No longer hold her heart in thrall, The melodies of nature now Upon her ear unheeded fall: For one is missing from her side Who was the idol of her soul, In hoarse accord the waters wide Above his mangled body roll. When Night upon her starry throne Held undisputed sway and lone, And moonlight to the trembling wave A soft but spectral radiance gave, He seized with iron grasp his chain, As if endued with giant strength, And after many efforts vain, While glowing madness fired his brain, From bondage burst at length. The cunning corsair heard the sound Of strong link breaking, with a clang, And stealing lightly, with a bound Upon his frenzied victim sprang; His right arm, used to felon-deed, The corsair raised with ready skillâ One thrust of his stiletto freed The crazed one from his load of ill. The pleading look and wild appeal Of Zillah could not stay the steel; She saw him fall, and from his side The red stream gush in bubbling tide, Then fell herself, as if the blade A sheath of her own breast had made, While fearfully his spouting gore The white robe purpled that she wore. Her ear heard not the gurgling sound Of hungry waters closing round, As hastily the ruffian cast His victim to the ocean vast, Or marked the grim exulting smile That lighted up his face the while: Extended on the deck she lay As if the war of life was over, As if her soul had fled away, To realms of never-ending day, To join the spirit of her lover. She woke at last from her long swoon, To hope that death would triumph soon, And the mad pulses of her frame With icy touch forever tame: She woke with features ashy white, And wildly gazed upon the plank That deeply, freely in the night The crimson of his veins had drank; Then raising heavenward her eye In still, expecting posture stood, As if a troop from realms on high Were coming down with battle-songs, To wash out sternly in the blood Of coward hearts her many wrongs: No tear-drop came to her relief In that wild, parching hour of grief: The tender plant of love, she knew, Would into verdure break no moreâ The spot was arid where it grew In green luxuriance before. She knew henceforth her lot below Would be to quaff the cup of painâ On thing of earth she could not throw The sunlight of her smile againâ The voice was still whose melting tone Had vied in sweetness with her ownâ The hiding wave had closed above The only object of her love: And Rispah, as strict watch she kept, While cold, like forms of Parian stone, Her sons on gory couches slept, Felt not more desolate and lone. In many hearts the gloomy sway Of sorrow lessens day by day, Until the charms of life at last Blot out remembrance of the past: As winds may kiss the trampled flower, And lift again its bruised leaf, So Time, with his assuaging power, May stay the wasting march of grief: But hearts in other bosoms beat Where anguish finds a lasting seatâ That heal not with the lapse of time: Too delicately strung for earth, Whose chords can never after chime With peals of loud, unmeaning mirth. Weeks flew: but Zillah in their flight Strove oft, but vainly, to forget The horrors of that fatal night, When her beloved star, whose light Made bondage pleasant, set. No murmur from the lip outbroke, Though suddenly her cheek grew thinâ No quick, convulsive start bespoke The desolating fire within. Her dark eye rested on the wave By day and in the hush of eve, As if, ere long, the wet sea cave Her buried one would leave, And, drifting suddenly in view, His murderer with dread subdue! Ah, I have said the stately mien Of Zillah would befit a queen, That lawless crime would ill withstand Her innate bearing of command. Alas! regality of soul Gives agony supreme control, And prompts the wretched one to hide Consuming pangs from vulgar gazeâ To nurse, in uncomplaining pride, The scorpion that preys. One blessed evening when the light Of starry hosts made ocean bright, An aged Rabbi woke the lay Of Judah in her mightier dayâ Of olden time when gladsome strains Ascended from her holy plains; When every rock beneath her sky Rang with the voice of prophecyâ When musical were grove and glade With prayer by simple herdsmen madeâ Ere fires of sacrifice grew pale On blooming height, in flowery valeâ Then changing skilfully his strain, While newer life each sinew strung, And triumph in his breast held reign, The glory of his fathers sung. The music in its proudest swell Cold on the ear of Zillah fellâ Bold notes, with patriot ardor fraught, No change in her appearance wroughtâ She tamely heard ancestral praise, And fixed no kind approving gaze Upon the Rabbi, as his lay In trembling cadence died away. Her love of olden time had fled, Her heart was with the early dead. While marking her abstraction lone, The old man said, with darkening brow, And stern displeasure in his tone:â âUnthinking one! forgettest thou Jerusalem, the home of sireâ Of beauty the perfection, where King David woke the sacred lyre, And moved his tuneful lip in prayer? Shall apathetic fetter bind Thy native majesty of mind, While the wrapt minstrel breathes with pride One name to Israel allied? Why gaze as if thy murder'd mate Was near in disembodied state? Why sorrow that his form of grace Yon ocean folds in wet embrace? From his shut eye the fitful ray Of frenzied grief hath fled away; No dreams of startling horror now Contort the marble of his brow: His manly heart is well at rest, By throb of madness unoppress'dâ Full many fathoms low his head Lies sweetly on a briny bed, Nor taunt, nor execration deep Disturbs the quiet of his sleep. If word of mine was fraught with power To animate the dead this hour, I would not call thy lover up From his calm resting in the main, To curse existence, and the cup Of horror deeply quaff again, Unless to blanch, with spectral stare, The visage of that man of guilt, Who stole upon him unaware Of danger, in his deep despair, And plunged the dagger to its hilt!â The growling voice of ruffian nigh Outspoke ere Zillah could replyâ âThat weapon mark! its crimson hue Tells fearfully of him I slewâ Beware, old dotard, ere its blade Familiar with thy heart be made!â The old man started, and his look Withdrawing from the mourner pale, Saw, while the blood his cheek forsook, The Corsair of my tale: His features in the moony light A smile of evil import wore; The scar of some terrific fight His turbaned forehead bore: The stern expression of his face At length to irony gave place; And hellish satisfaction shone On each dark lineament impress'd, While thus in simulating tone His captive he address'd:â âThough passion fires that sunken eye, The young in years and gray of hair, United in the marriage-tie, Will never make a loving pair. Much rather would yon matron feel The pressure of this hand of steel Than round her fairy waist have thrown An arm, all shrivell'd, like thine own!â Roused by the taunt of the Pirate Chief From her drooping attitude of grief, The sufferer stood with eye upcast, As if her prayer had been heard at last, And a message from Heaven was borne on the air That seraphs would hasten on pinions of light, And her soul, from the thrall of mortality, bear To a realm never dim with the presence of night. From her brow the sign of health had fled, And the shrunken veins were there instead; By robe invested was her frame That well the white of her cheek became: Inwoven with dark ringlets, shone The dazzling blaze of a diamond stone That her passionate lover gave away, With a stolen kiss, on her bridal day. O, that some sculptor With chisel in hand, While the warm glow of thought By religion was fann'd, Could the Jewess have seen Looking sweetly to Heaven, And her angel-like glance To cold marble have givenâ Or some exquisite painter, In that mystic hour, When Genius best governs The pencil of power, Could one fleeting moment On Zillah have gazed, With her wan lips apart, And her dark eye upraised. Has she heard from her Maker The mandateââLive on?â I know notâher gaze From the sky is withdrawn, And imploringly rests On the Rabbi, who stands With his old limbs encircled By prisoning bands: She addresses him nowâ âWhen the last trumpet calls, And the sleepers of Earth Leave the gloom of her halls, Will the dead whose bones whiten The floor of the deep, Hear the life-giving summons, And waken from sleep?â While the mingling emotions Of grief and surprise In his mien are depicted, The Rabbi replies:â âIs the promise of God Not familiar to thee?â âAgain will I bring From the depths of the sea!â That Being whose arm The mad waters divided, And our fathers through haunts Of the sea-monsters guided; That Being whose terrible Majesty gave For a tomb to proud Egypt The bed of the wave, Will make, the Last Day, His Omnipotent word In the most secret place Of yon Ocean be heard.â He spake:âand the beautiful Mourner appears Like saint newly freed From the sorrow of yearsâ One moment she lingers With foot on the rail, While around her the moon Throws a loveliness paleâ The next, shrieking wildly, âI come, murder'd lover!â Leaves her perilous footingâ Wild waves roll above her! THE REVENGE OF ROSAMOND. [âAlboin, the conqueror of Rome, in a palace near Verona, feasted the companions of his arms. After draining many capacious bowls of Falernian wine, he called for the skull of Cunimund. The cup of victory was accepted with horrid applause by the circle of Lombard chiefs. âFill it again with wine!â exclaimed the inhuman conqueror. âCarry this goblet to the queen, inform her it is the skull of her father, and request in my name, she would rejoice with him.â In an agony of grief and rage, Rosamond had strength to utter:ââLet the will of my lord be obeyed,â and touching it with her lips, pronounced a silent imprecation, that the insult should be washed away in the blood of Alboin.â]â Gibbon. âAnd this is blood for blood.ââ Barry Cornwall. The haughty king of Lombardy, the conqueror of Rome His valiant chiefs convened within his splendid palace-home, And loudly spoke, surveying the circle with his eyeâ âEach guest with rich Falernian, his wassail cup fill high! With those the blood-bought spoils of conquest shall be shared, Who, undismayed, the perils of battle with me dared; Let those who bravely follow my pathway o'er the slain, At banquet-board, with Alboin the flowing goblet drain.â âLong life,â replied each reveller, âto our unrivalled king!â And, with applauding shouts, they made the vaulted palace ring. With savage exultation, then, the wine-awakened throng Recalled their deeds of hardihood, and sang the battle-song; The king, with martial ardor and potent draughts inflamed, To one of his attendants near, ferociously exclaimed: âBring forth the skull of Cunimund, to grace the banquet-hall; The memory of glorious deeds that goblet will recall! Bring forth the precious trophy!âThe relic of a foe Can even give Falernian wine a richer taste and glow. Let purple nectar occupy the palace of the soul, For meet it is the warrior should drink from such a bowl!â The reckless king received it with a loud and scornful laugh, And from the cup of victory he bade each Lombard quaff; Then said in bitter irony:ââFill up the bowl again, And carry to my blooming queen this relic of the slain; The rosy tide will pleasant thoughts within her breast inspire, When sparkling in the grinning skull of her lamented sire: And, page, be sure to bring me back fair Rosamond's replyâ Discharge thine errand faithfully, or by this hand you die!â With words it were impossible to paint the burst of rage With which the queen accepted the goblet from the page; Though strength she had to utter:ââHis will I shall obey,â In secret she resolved her wrongs with blood to wash away. Then to her lips she wildly raised with trembling hand the brim, While gushing tears of agony her beauteous eyes made dim. The base, inhuman husband soon, with love and wine inspired, From the festive board unto his downy couch retired. The injured queen his weary head did pillow on her breast, And, with caress affectionate, the monarch lull to rest; Then slyly left the chamber, and gave a signal-word, And stealthy steps approaching her were indistinctly heard. At length masqued figures entered; in each determined hand, A taper faintly shedding light, disclosed the battle-brand. âTread softly, brave avengers, and not the sleeper rouse: For few in prowess match the king,â whispered the false spouse. âWhat is your errand, warriors?â alarmed the monarch spoke: The answer to his question was the deadly sabre-stroke. His keen and trusty battle-blade hung useless by his side, Prevented from unsheathing it by his revengeful bride. When, bleeding from an hundred wounds, she saw her lord expire, Burst forth, âI now have well revenged the murder of my sire;â And spurning fiercely with her foot his wound-disfigured clay, âMy wrongs,â she cried exultingly, âin blood are washed away.â Though partially the elements may yield to man's control, He cannot calm in woman scorned the tempest of the soul. ASDRUBAL'S WIFE. [âThe flames spreading rapidly, they continued to fly from one part of the building to another, till at length they got on the roof. âHere Asdrubal's wife appeared, uttering the most bitter reproaches against her husband, exclaiming:ââInglorious wretch! what degrading actions hast thou perpetrated to preserve an existence so dishonorable!â Having stabbed her two infants with a dagger, she precipitated them from the temple's top, and leaped after them into the flames.â] Upon the temple-roof she stood, Unbraided was her hair, And loud shouts from the multitude Rose wildly on the air. Pale terror in her fragile frame Awoke no icy thrill: She stood, as if the leaping flame Was subject to her will. Maternal love each sinew strung With more than mortal power, For two fair infants trembling clung To her in that last hour. Did not their father, in his gore, With thousands sleep below, While haughtily that mother bore Vile tauntings of the foe? No!âstanding by the Roman chief, While fiercely spread the fire, He heard his children for relief Call vainly on their sire. The Pride of Carthage lay around, Of unclean birds the food, And purple was the groaning ground Whereon he basely stood. His well-known form the dauntless wife Saw dimly through the smoke, And sending up no prayer for life Indignantly thus spoke:â âThrice happy they who nobly die Beneath the steel of foemen, And scorn, at honor's price, to buy Existence from the Roman! âInhuman wretch! the blush of shame May well suffuse thy cheekâ Faint are thine infants, and my name Their lips refuse to speak. A red sea rolls its burning surge Their utterance to choke; The roar of Ruin is their dirge, Their winding-sheet the smoke. âThe savage vulture will not fly From his affrighted mate And âunshell'd broodâ when foes are nigh, But stay and share their fate: But man, to guard a worthless life, The tie of nature breakethâ To save his little ones and wife Not one brave effort maketh. âThe deed is mine,âbut oh, the guilt On your black soul shall rest!â She plunged a dagger to the hilt Within each infant's breast; Then wildly to the hungry flame Their bleeding corpses flungâ One loud, appalling shriek went up, And after them she sprung. THE FALL OF AQUILEIA. [âWhen Attila invaded Italy, he received a severe check before the walls of Aquileia. After repeated failures to storm the place, he rode round the walls, and observing a stork take wing, he exclaimed:ââA creature fond of human haunts would not abandon these walls if they were not doomed to a speedy overthrow.â He renewed the attack with redoubled energy, and a breach being made near the stork's nest, the barbarians rushed in and hurned the town, having previously butchered the inhabitants.â]â Gibbon. Broad meadows of the Danube Sent forth a Hunnish horde To reap in groaning Italy Red harvest with the sword; But howls of rage from front to rear Convulsed the dark array, When Aquileia reared her walls That fearful march to stay. Close to the town their leader spurred With monarchs in his train, While darts from tower and battlement Fell round his head like rainâ âWeak, trembling cowards of the south, Unbar these gates,â he cried, âOr over your dismembered forms My cavalry shall ride.â The brave, devoted garrison Sent back these taunting words:â âThe corpses of you swarthy crew Shall feed our carrion birds!â The broad square frame of Attila Grew tremulous with ire, And glanced within its socket deep His rolling eye like fire. The fierce beleaguerers advanced In vain to storm the town, By showers of hissing javelins Arrested and struck down. The flourish of barbaric horns, The neigh of wounded steeds Were mingled with the groans of men, Ambition's broken reeds. Night came:âand to their camp retired The squadrons of the Hun; No breach within the rampart madeâ The citadel unwon: Invincible they deemed no more The chosen scourge of God, Though many a tribe of earth had bowed Beneath his iron rod. When morning dawned, the mighty king Round Aquileia rode, And marked with joy an aged stork Abandon its abode: âOld dweller amid human haunts, Thou leavest yonder wall, By instinct taught that dome and tower Are doomed this day to fall.â The signal of assault he gave, And thundered in the van, While tidings of an omen fair Were borne from man to man; Against that portion of the work The living torrent prest, Where Attila beheld the stork Forsake its ancient nest. The crumbling masonry gave way, A fissure opened wide, While yells arose that would have drowned The roar of Ocean's tide. Dark clouds of Hunnish horse rushed in To glut themselves with blood And not a roof was left to tell Where Aquileia stood. That citadel, the human heart, Must look to its defence; For woe betide it, if the Bird Of Hope takes flight from thence. Dread tenant of the ruin wild, Remorse will vainly moan, A constant mourner for the shrine Of beauty overthrown. For some dread augury without The powers of darkness wait, That they may enter in, and leave Its chambers desolate. Let Truth be watchman on the wall, And Love abide within, And, weary of assault, will fly The baffled host of sin. FREEDOM'S OAK. IN COMMEMORATION OF THE LANDING OF THE PILGRIMS. They landed not a bannered host Eager the battle-shock to brave, Upon a rude and rocky coast Lashed by the moaning wintry wave. No hungering desire for gain Far, far away lured son and sire From pleasant homes beyond the main, Cheered by church-bell and village spire. Frail ones to hardship uninured, Maid, wife, and grandam, bowed and pale, Without complaining word endured The buffet of the freezing gale. They recked not, though the beast of prey By night was on his bloody walk, And prowled the red man forth to slay, Armed with his murderous tomahawk. Oh! higher, holier motives far Than painful quest of golden sand, Or love of desolating war, Nerved to high deed that little band! What brought they to a wild remote? Stern hearts that danger could not quellâ The zeal with which a Milton wrote, The creed for which a Hampden fell. Clad in coarse, pilgrim garb, they came To give a mighty empire birth, And kindled up an altar-flame That lights the gloom of guilty earth. On them devolved a mighty taskâ They robbed the bigot of his cowl, And wrenched from tyranny the mask That curtained features black and foul. An acorn in the soil by them Was sown beneath a frowning sky, From which an oak of giant stem Grew up, and tossed its boughs on high. Gashed victims of the greedy sword, While thunder shook the conflict-ground, The best blood of their hearts have poured Its firm, extending roots around. And now, beneath its guardian shade, When hunted from their native shore, Gather thy wronged, oh Earth! afraid Of quest-hounds on the track no more. Then honored be those Pilgrims old, Who planted well that noble tree, While springs a blossom from the mould, Or roll the waters of the sea! Proud of descent from such a stock Let gratitude our bosoms warm, And ever hallowed be the Rock On which they landed in the storm! BRUTUS IN HIS TENT. âHow ill this taper burns!âha! who comes here?ââ Shakespeare. On wall-girt Sardis weary day hath shed The golden blaze of his expiring beam; And ring her paven walks beneath the tread Of guards that near the hour of battle deemâ Whose brazen helmets in the starlight gleam; From tented lines no murmur loud ascends, For martial thousands of the battle dream On which the fate of bleeding Rome depends When blushing dawn awakes, and night's dark curtain rends. Though hushed war's couchant tigers in their lair The tranquil time to one brings not reposeâ A voice was whispering to his soulââDespair! The gods will give the triumph to thy foes.â Can sleep, with leaden hand, our eyelids close When throng distempered fancies and depart, And thought a shadow on the future throws? When shapes unearthly into being start, And, like a snake, Remorse uncoils within the heart? At midnight deep when bards avow that tombs Are by their cold inhabitants forsaken, The Roman chief his wasted lamp relumes, And calmly reads by mortal woe unshaken: His iron frame of rest had not partaken, And doubtâdark enemy of slumberâfills A breast where fear no trembling chord could waken, And on his ear an awful voice yet thrills, That rose, when CÃ¦sar fell, from Rome's old Seven Hills. A soundââthat earth owns notââhe hears, and starts, And grasps the handle of his weapon tried; Then, while the rustling tent-cloth slowly parts, A figure enters and stands by his side: There was an air of majesty and pride In the bold bearing of that spectre paleâ The crimson on its robe was still undried, And dagger-wounds, that tell a bloody tale Beyond the power of words, the opening folds unveil. With fearful meaning towers the phantom grim, On Brutus fixing its cold, beamless eye; The face, though that of Julius, seems to him Formed from the moonlight of a misty sky: The birds of night, affrighted, flutter by, And a wild sound upon the shuddering air Creeps as if earth were breathing out a sigh, And the fast-waning lamp, as if aware Some awful shade was nigh, emits a ghostly glare. Stern Brutus quails not, though his woe-worn cheeks Blanch with emotion, and in tone full loud Thus to the ghastly apparition speaksâ âWhy stand before me in that gory shroud, Unwelcome guest! thy purpose unavowed; Art thou the shaping of my wildered brain?â The spectre answered, with a gesture proud, In hollow accentsââWe will meet again When the best blood of Rome smokes on Philippi's plain.â ÃGEUS. [âTheseus set sail for Athens in the same mournful ship in which he came to Crete, but forgot to change his sails, according to the instructions of his father; so that when his father beheld from a watch-tower the ship returning with black sails, he imagined that his son was dead, and cast himself headlong into the sea, which was afterward called Ãgean Sea, from his name and destiny.â] Andrew Tooke. âA mast above the waters Is rising tall and fair, And hither bound, with glory crowned, Welcome, my princely heir.â A king these glad words uttered, His white locks streaming free Beneath a golden circlet, In his watch-tower by the sea. When nearer drew to Athens The bark that bore his son, The monarch, with an altered mien, This loud lament begun: âThose sails are sails of mourningâ They flap above the dead, And winds that fill them whisper Low lies the laureled head! âVain, vain the hope, long cherished, That this old hand of mine To Theseus, in dying hour, Would royal robe resign! âThough black the sails and rigging Of yon ill-omened bark, In my despairing bosom There is a night more dark.â High, high the broken billow Its wreath of foam did fling, When, headlong from the dizzy tower, Plunged, in his woe, the king. Thenceforth, august Athena! Thy sea, for beauty famed, The bards of classic story Ãg?um marÃ© named. A waste of troubled waters Is, aye, the Poet's dower, And royal thought keeps vigil Within a lonely tower. Rich fancies have been trusted To Fortune's varying gale; And eagerly the watcher marks Yon home-returning sail. Perchance on board are riches To cheer the minstrel's lot, And Glory's amaranthine crown, Whose purple fadeth not. Winds drive the vessel nearer, And well their wrath she bravesâ âHo, watchman! swells her canvas, A white cloud o'er the waves?â âThy visions, Bard, are perishedâ Thy golden hopes have fled! Those sails are sails of mourningâ They flap above the dead!â TASSO. [âA Prince of royal birth confined the Poet in a mad-house for more than seven years; the great and wealthy left him to a precarious life; but a Mountain Robber, by the road side, controlled in his favor the instinct of his gang, and craved forgiveness at the hands of the Author of the âGerusalemme.ââ] Life of Tasso. The swarthy Captain of the Band Before the weary wanderer stood, And the keen poniard in his hand Had often tasted blood. Awaiting but a sign from him, In view were lawless men and bold, Deep scars upon their features grim Of strife and carnage told. âThy purse, or life!â exclaimed the chiefâ But savage look and threat'ning tone Fear woke not in a heart where grief Held mastery alone. âOur trade admits of no delayâ The quest-hounds of the law are near; No longer hesitateâOBEY, Or end your journey here!â âThese hollow cheeksâthis mean attire, And hair untimely streaked with snow, But little aid from speech require To tell of want and woe.â Out spoke the robber in reply, More darkly frowning than beforeâ âPerchance some wealthy friend would buy Thy life with yellow ore.â Then mournfully the Pilgrim said: âAt night, upon the dewy sod, I often rest this aching headâ My only friend is God! Not always was my fate so hard, Raised high my fellow men aboveâ While a proud princess bade the bard His lute-strings tune to love.â âThose rags do not become, I ween, The regal glance of those dark eyes: I clearly trace in thy proud mien Some lordling in disguise!â âAh! I am not unknown to fame, Though a poor outcast now I roam; Grim robber! Tasso is my nameâ The world's wide street my home.â âFlame and the sword I would defy To shield thy person, Child of Song! An hundred deaths would rather die Than see thee suffer wrong. Thy verse beneath his sable wave, Oblivion can never hide; Forgiveness is a boon I crave,â The kneeling robber cried. Although the rich had heard him pour A prayer for aid with cold disdainâ Though long within a cell he wore The flesh-consuming chainâ A man whose soul was dark with crime, Whose heart compassion seldom felt, Before the bard of strain sublime In admiration knelt. FALL OF LISBON. A picture of the great earthquake. Listen! is that startling sound Some distant thunder-peal? Or rolls upon the solid ground The heavy chariot-wheel? Yon pale wretch flying from his homeâ The piercing shriek of woeâ The loud crash of the falling dome, And temple, answerâno! The soldierâwho had borne a part, When war his banner spread, With stalwart arm and fearless heartâ Now, terror-stricken, fled: The dying aid besought in vainâ The vaulted sky grew dark, And, on the madly-heaving main, Unguided rode the bark. The castle proud, and humble shed Alike were overthrown; With cottage-born and palace-bred The trembling earth was strown. Some cowered by dwellings prostrate laid, Blank monuments of fear; Others looked wildly round for aidâ No aid, alas! was near. âThe sea is comingâwe are lost!â Despairing voices cried, While, landward, like a charging host, Swept on the chainless tide. Above Art's gorgeous wreck did close The billow darkly then; And wildly from the flood arose The cries of drowning men. An awful scene, unlike the first, With mournful twilight came: From Lisbon's tortured heart outburst Black smoke and hissing flame. Then temple, arch, and glittering spire, By wave and earthquake spared, Wrapped in red banner-folds of fire, The common ruin shared. THE MURDERED CZAR. [âPaul caused the corpse of his father, Peter III., to be taken up and brought to the palace, to receive similar honors with that of the empress, his wife. Prince Baratinsky and Count Alexius Orloff, two of the murderers of the unfortunate czar, were fixed on to officiate as chief mourners. The imperial crown was placed on the coffin of Peter; and in presence of the assembled court, and amidst sable hangings, lighted tapers, and all the solemnity of woe, the two mourners took their station. Orloff, whose nerves were strong, endured the scene, unshaken; but his companion fainted beneath his emotions.â]â Mavor. A dark procession from the tomb The body of their monarch bore, With blazing torch and sable plume, Infolded in a shroud of gore. From turret and from tower the toll Of chiming bells rose on the air, While, muffled in his dusky stole, The holy priest knelt down in prayer. A stately figure joined the train, And slowly walked behind the bierâ Whose haughty spirit strove in vain To check the unavailing tear. No golden circlet graced his head, Nor glittered on his breast the star; But funeral garb, and lordly tread, Proclaimed the mourner and the czar. When nearer to the palace proud The bearers drew in dark array, To young and old they cried aloudâ âRoom for the bier! make way, make way!â Like flashing waves before the prow, The mourners thronging round, divide; And solemnly they enter now The lofty dwelling-place of pride. The chandelier and lamp threw light On every object in the hall; And, darker than the wing of night, Broad hangings rustled on the wall: While nobles, in superb attire, And prostrate serf, their homage paid, Paul, on the coffin of his sire, The diadem of empire laid. In presence of the courtiers then, With downcast eye and timid look, Reluctantly two noblemen Their station by the coffin took. A trembling thrilled each iron frame, And bloodless waxed their âtell-taleâ cheeksâ Oh! guilt and agony and shame Are vultures with unsparing beaks! The taper shed a ruddy glare On the bruised features of the dead, And gory beard and clotted hair In all awoke an icy dread. Ah! fearfully the brow was still Contorted by the pang of death, And pomp with dust accorded ill, Deprived of motion, mind and breath. Why sits that ghastly watcher by The corse, with frenzy in his gaze? The fearful wildness of his eye A storm, at work within, betrays: He looks upon the pall and shroud With face, as stainless marble, pale, Afraid the slumberer to the crowd Would tell the heart-appalling tale. The mystic pencil cannot paint The frightful look his visage wore, When, reft of consciousness and faint, He sunk exhausted on the floor. Awaking from the swoon, with hands Outspread for aid, the ruffian cried:â âVengeful the sheeted victim stands, With arm uplifted, by my side!â These startling words his guilt reveal, His bosom wildly throbs with fear; Loud shriek of death, and vain appeal To stony hearts, ring in his ear; The cup he bade the monarch drain, With poison fraught, he now beholds, And clenches in his hand again The napkin with its bloody folds. Ah! phantoms, unallied to earth, That other eyes cannot discern, Are feeding, with their hellish mirth, Fierce flames that in his bosom burn: In vain the mind-destroying bowl Was brought his anguish to allay, No draught will ever from his soul The stain of murder wash away. LYING IN STATE. âWhy, what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust? And, live we how we can, yet die we must.â The palace floors of marble Resound to falling feet, And in a vast apartment A mighty concourse meet;â From lamp and candelabra Stream waves of golden light, And martial plumage flutters On helmets, tall and bright. From vine-wreathed goblets quaff not That bright and brilliant throng, And absent is the merry laugh, The breathing lute and song. How ill comports with sorrow That gayly lighted hall, Where banner-fold and trophy Hang on the sculptured wall. The sage and fawning courtier, The mail-clad knight and chief, And young and old have gathered In all the pomp of grief; The conqueror of conquerors Hath thrown a deadly dart, And stricken, in an evil hour, An empire to the heart. Pale on a couch of purple A kingly form reposedâ His stalwart arm was motionless, His eye forever closed; The crimson wreath of victory His brow encircled yet, Though Glory's star, so radiant long, In mournful night had set. Of death in awful mockery A gorgeous crown he wore, As if the glittering symbol Could old command restoreâ As if his right hand powerless Could grasp the truncheon still, And make surrounding nations The vassals of his will. Pale pearls and sparkling diamonds Bedecked his costly vest, And a cross, with jewels studded, Reposed upon his breast; These proud words were upon itâ âBy this thou wilt subdue!â Once traced, in lightning characters, On morning's arch of blue. Slow, near him, waned the taper With a still, unwavering flame, And royal raiment shrouded His soul-forsaken frame: Lo! state and army officers Kneel down beside the bed; And yield, with mock solemnity, Allegiance to the dead. Can pomp restore the spirit To its death-corrupted shrine? That ghastly wreck of majesty To kindred dust resign! On brow and wasted bosom Let hiding dust be thrown; The worms are waiting for their preyâ The grave must have its own! LAMENT FOR GRANADA. Alas for thee, Granada! The Crescent waned away, When traitors leagued to shatter Thy mace of royal sway. Unworthy of the mother That warmed them into life, They heard the Gothic trumpet, And armed not for the strife. Look round! an earthly paradise Is changed into a tomb, A blight is on thy loveliness, And mildew on thy bloom; Where streamed the Moorish penon Triumphantly of old, Decay and mournful silence Divided empire hold. Alas for thee, Granada! Thy chiefs are shadows now, And ashes have been sprinkled Upon thy crownless brow: Thy glory is departed, Thy day of pomp is o'er, And âAllah illah Allah!â Is a battle-cry no more. Castilian valor vainly To cloud thy glory strove Ere Treachery within thy walls His cunning web-work wove; By bloody parricidal hands Inflicted was the blow That brought thee, gem of cities! In all thy grandeur low. MARTIAL LYRICS. INSCRIBED TO MY KINSMAN, MAJOR WILLIAM R. ANDREWS. CAPTAIN MAY. [Air.ââThe Men of Ninety-Eight.â] Loud plaudits for our bold Dragoon, The gallant Captain May! The light of glory's dazzling noon Will gild his name for aye. Though fast and hot the hurtling shot Fell round his little band, He paled not, he quailed not, But drew his glittering brand. More lurid grew the battle-cloud, But not a horseman spurred; Their leader, on his charger proud, Sate waiting for the word; Though far around the trampled ground Was with the fallen strown, He paled not, he quailed not, As if his form was stone. The General galloped to his side, And issued order sternâ âNow forward with your squadron ride, And deathless honor earn; That battery must taken be Ere Mexico is tamedââ He paled not, he quailed not, ButââFollow meââexclaimed. There was a rush of men and steeds, Fierce struggling for renown, And hostile ranks, like shiver'd reeds, In that wild charge went down: Brave Vega yields, though many fields Had heard his warlike shout, And pale now, and quail now His thousands put to rout. Twine garlands for our Cavalier, The gallant Captain May! A knight without reproach, or fearâ A Bayard in the fray! When flags that wave above the brave Are scorched by battle's breath, He pales not, he quails not, But fronts the face of death. On every breeze should grandly swell A Nation's funeral hymn For those, the staunch and true, who fell In that encounter grim:â To grace the plain where they were slain Proud piles should tower on high: They paled not, they quailed not, But died as heroes die. A LAY OF BRITTANY. SUGGESTED BY READING MICHELET'S SPIRITED DESCRIPTION OF THIS OLD PROVINCE IN HIS HISTORY OF FRANCE. Bretons love their native land With its coast so dark and sterileâ Men of iron heart and hand, Framed from youth to cope with peril. Oft have Breton heads and breasts Fierce invading cohorts driven Back, with shorn and humbled crests, And their armor hacked and riven. Though the soil is cold and hard, Small return to labor giving, Scenes we point to, by the bard Linked to song forever living. Name of terror to the braveâ Lair of danger ever lowering; Grim Cape Raz above the wave Full three hundred feet is towering. Thither on the rocking surge, Have the old sea kings been drifted, While the tempest howled a dirge, And rough hands in prayer were lifted. On our dark and frowning strand Crushed are vessels every winter, And in vain a ghastly band, Drowning, clench frail oar and splinter. Deadman's Bay within its breast Hath entombed the lost for ages, For a tide that knows no rest War against the seaman wages. Since the bearded Norsemen bold By its hungry depths were swallowed, Art of man, in sluggish mould, Deeper charnel hath not hollowed. In a last embrace entwined, Wrecked at midnight black and cheerless, To its custody consigned Down have sunk the fair and fearless. Treasure-house of wealth untold, Jewels, amid bones, lie scattered, Knightly arms inlaid with gold, Dinted helm, and hauberk battered. Islands rise above the wave, Chained by fearful shoals together, Where the Sacred Virgins gave To the Celt sunshiny weather; There their orgies drowned the gale, Growling surf, and osprey screaming, While around the distant sail Glanced the lightning redly gleaming. Mariners, far off at sea, To the shrouds in terror clinging, Heard their chant of hellish glee, And barbaric cymbals ringing. Rifted rocks are near the coast, Girdled by the billows hoary, And each one of them can boast, Stranger! its romantic story. One that lifts its rugged brow, With the spray around it curling, Though so bare and dreary now, Was the haunt of Wizard Merlin: Never more will work his spell, Nor the magic rhyme be spoken, But of him our legends tell Though his mighty wand is broken. Listen to that mournful roar, To the ground-swell's measured beating! Clamoring for graves on shore Ghosts of shipwrecked men are meeting. Fair the weather, or serene, Newly-born the day, or dying, Two black ravens may be seen O'er yon rocky islet flying. They are spirits of the deadâ Of a king whose doom is written. And a child, whose beauteous head By the same dark blow was smitten. On yon rock in thunder rolls, With its snow-white crown, the water, Fitting dirge-note for the souls Of King Grallo and his daughter. Bretons love their province old, Rugged nurse of gallant spiritsâ Traitors cannot bribe with gold Heart that Breton blood inherits. Now, as in the glorious past, France may trust in Breton daring; When the sheath aside is cast, Breton steel is aye unsparing. Hohenlinden's Chief was nursed By a dauntless Breton mother; Let the storm of battle burst, Breton prowess naught can smother! History her leaves may turn, And no braver name discover Written than Latour D'Auvergne, Glory's pure and faithful lover! When at Waterloo eclipse Dimm'd our hopes, one brave defender Shouted out with Breton lips:â âWe can die, but not surrender!â If in strife we meet once more British bosoms, woe betide them! Naught, upon our iron shores, Foes e'er won but graves to hide them! THE DRAGOON TO HIS STEED. SUGGESTED BY SEEING BLACK WARRIOR, THE HIGHLY PRIZED CHARGER OF MAJOR MERRILL, OF THE SECOND DRAGOONS OF THE U. S. ARMY. Old war-steed, while combing Thy dark-flowing mane, In thought I am roaming Through fields of the slain: Brave comrades are leaping To saddle once more, And follow me, steeping Their sabres in gore:â Through squares, formed of steel, that are shattered like glass, Outspeeding the rush of the whirlwind, we pass. Through wastes, hot and sterile, Swamps, dismal and dread, Companion in peril! How oft have we sped: Though night, dark and dreary, Her curtain had drawn, Thy limbs never weary Would hurry me on; And back the grim scar that is trenching thy neck Brings a terrible vision of carnage and wreck. A host is defending Molino del Rey, And clouds are ascending To curtain the day. Friends drop, torn asunder By chain-shot and shell, The hill-shaking thunder Of cannon their knell; But on press survivors, while guarded by walls Foes check their advance with a tempest of balls. Loud yells of derision Prove vain the attackâ Like waves from collision With rocks, they fall back:â Chill horror is goading The brave to despair, And black mines exploding Hurl corpses through air; But, true to their colors, they rally and formâ Though man cannot live, and confront such a storm. Lo! lancers in motion, Rank bristling on rank, Rush like waves of the ocean, To charge us in flank; But signal to meet them Our bugleman blows, And long sabres greet them With skull-cleaving blows: Horse and rider go down that fierce onslaught before, And thousands are flying to rally no more. Companion in danger! Though now growing old, For thee would the stranger In vain offer gold. The trumpet will cheer not, My courage decayâ That morn when I hear not Thy welcoming neigh; For never was cavalier seen on the back Of steed that could rival my own gallant Black. THE GRAYS AT AVON. AN IMPROMPTU. They come! the gallant Graysâ With firm but measured tread, And their polished arms flash back the rays By an August morning shed; And a cry of welcome, long and loud, Breaks from the lips of the gazing crowd. They move as if one soul Beat in their proud array, Timing their march to the drum's deep roll, And the trumpet's stormy brayâ Oh! matchless strain! the Spartan fife, And Orlando's horn had less of life. Lo! they are passing byâ Those men of martial mien! And at vine-wreathed porch and casement high Fair ladies may be seen, While flowers, bright flowers to the warlike band Are flung by many a snow-white hand. The banner disappearsâ No more the music rings, And a heavy tramp to listening ears Alone the zephyr brings, While helmet, plume, and glittering blade From view like a dream of romance fade. Sons of the steel! adieu! When honor calls, I know That to home and hearth ye will be true, And a terror to the foe; For banner never flung its fold O'er forms of more heroic mould. When on the darkened shore Of time to death ye yield, And your ordered ranks are seen no more On life's great battle-field, May command by the Lord of Hosts be given That your tents be pitched on the plains of Heaven. DEATH OF ROB ROY. [âWhen this chieftain was on his death-bed, a gentleman whom he had reason to consider as an enemy, came to see him. On being requested to admit him to his bed-side, he said: âRaise me up, buckle on my arms, then admit him!â The guest was received with cold civility, and in a short time departed. âNow,â said Rob Roy âcall in the piper.â The piper came, and he expired with the voice of war pealing around him.â] With heather pillowing his head The dying outlaw lay, And plaided clansmen round his bed Stood watching in dismay. Wild throes of dissolution shook His worn and wasted frame, But native lordliness of look Distemper could not tame. The walls of his rude dwelling-place Were hung with weapons brightâ With branching antlers of the chase, And trophies won in fight. His tall, gaunt hound of proven worth, Acute of eye and ear, Slept idly on the lighted hearth, Forgetful of the deer. Cold dewâthat herald which precedes The winding-sheet, and wail Of mourning onesâin clammy beads, Stood on his forehead pale. Faint grew the swell of his proud breast And dim his falcon eye, But manfully his lip suppressed The groan of agony. While ran his blood with feebler flow, Strode in a clansman stout, And told the chief, in accents low, âA stranger waits without!â Then syllabled the nameâa word Unwelcome to his ears, Which darkly in his bosom stirred The hoarded hate of years. âNo member of a hostile clan, While heart or pulse can beat, Shall see me,â said the dying man, âIn posture of defeat. Array me in the spoils I took From enemies laid low; Clad thus, Macgregor cannot brook The presence of a foe. âBring forth the bonnet that I wore When blood was on the heather, Though in the mountain wind no more Will nod its eagle feather; Gird on my sword, of temper tried, Old beam of hope in danger, To deeds of hardihood allied, And then admit the stranger!â Attendants clad the dying man In garb that well became The leader of a martial clan, A warrior of fame; Admitted then his guest, who met Reception stern and cold; The Highland Chief could not forget The bloody feuds of old. The stranger soon withdrew. âNow call The harper in, to cheer My passing spirit with the strain Most welcome to my ear!â The hoary minstrel brought his lyre, To notes of battle strung, And, fingering its chords of fire, In stormy concert sung:â âThe plaid round his shoulders our leader hath thrown, And a gathering blast on his bugle hath blown; He calls on the dauntless and ready of hand To gather around him with bonnet and brand; Like hounds scenting out the retreat of the stag, We quit, for the Lowlands, our home on the crag. âThe dirk of our fathers in gore we must dye! Will the falcon forbear, when the quarry is nigh? The Saxon dreams not, in his flowery vale, That our pennon is flung to the welcoming gale; That we come from the mountains to scourge and destroy, And the chieftain we follow is dreaded Rob Roy. âOn the head of Macgregor a price hath been set, With the blood of our clan Lowland sabres are wet; Elated by triumph, red wine freely flows, And loud is the song in the camp of our foes; But to shrieking will change their demoniac joy, When sound our glad pipers the charge of Rob Roy!â Ere died the battle-song away, Rose up the voice of wail, While motionless the chieftain lay, With face like marble pale. No kindly word from him repaid The harper for his strain; The hushing hand of death was laid On heart, and pulse, and brain! SONG FOR POLAND. Up, for encounter stern, While unsheathed weapons gleam; The beacon-fires of Freedom burn, Her banners wildly stream; Awake! and drink at purple springsâ Lo! the âwhite eagleâ flaps his wings With a rejoicing scream That sends an old, heroic thrill Through hearts that are unconquer'd still. Leap to your saddles, leap! Tried wielders of the lance, And charge as when ye broke the sleep Of Europe, at the call of France: The knightly deeds of other years Eclipse, ye matchless cavaliers! While plume and pennon danceâ That Prince, Poniatowsky. upon his phantom steed, In Ellster lost your ranks will lead. Flock round the altar, flock: And swear ye will be free; Then rush to brave the battle shock Like surges of a maddened sea; Death, with a red and shattered brand Yet clinging to the rigid hand, A blissful fate would be, Contrasted with that darker doom, A branded browâa living tomb. Speed to the combat, speed! And beat Oppression down, Or win, by martyrdom, the meed Of high and shadowless renown:â Ye weary exiles, from afar Come back! and make the savage Czar In terror clutch his crown, While wronged and vengeful millions roar Defiance at his palace door. Throng forth with souls to dare, From huts and ruined halls! On the deep midnight of despair A beam of ancient glory falls; The knout, the chain, and dungeon cave To frenzy have aroused the brave; Dismembered Poland calls, And through a land opprest, betrayed, Stalks Kosciusko's frowning shade. ERIN WAKING. Light streams through a rift in the cloud That hangs over green Innisfailâ While voices of millions are shouting aloud, The satraps of tyranny quail: The collar of shame hath been worn Through ages of folly and woeâ Too long hath thy neck, O Hibernia! borne The yoke of a merciless foe, Whose creatures, while perfidy sharpened the dart, Like vultures have crimsoned their beaks in thy heart. Hot winds from the waste of despair On thy blood-bedewed shamrock have breathed, But the leaves, growing verdant in liberty's air, Again round her brow shall be wreathed: And chisel of art on the stone Shall name of that martyr engrave Who prayed for a sepulchre, noteless and lone, While foot of one heart-broken slave Polluted the green of that beautiful shore, By steel-harnessed champions trodden of yore. Gone forth hath the gathering word, And under Hesperian skies Fond exiles the call of their mother have heard, And homeward are turning their eyes: They send o'er the murmuring brine In answer a shout of applause, And drops, that give warmth to their bosoms like wine, Are ready to shed in a cause That cannot march on with a faltering stride While Truth wears a buckler, and God is a guide. Land of the valiant! at last The brow of thy future is bright; In return for a shadowed and comfortless past Is dawning an era of light: The Lion of Britain in vain Is baring his teeth for the frayâ Thy children have sworn that dishonoring stain Shall be wiped from thy forehead away; The bones of thy martyrs have stirred in the tomb, And glimmers the starlight of Hope through the gloom. Invaders thy valor have ruedâ To deeds that will aye be admired, Bear witness, Clontarf! where the Dane was subdued, And Brian, the dauntless, expired: Thy sons on the scaffold have died, The block hath been soaked with their gore, And long ago banished thy splendor and pride; But idle it seems to deploreâ Unbending resolve to blot out thy disgrace, In hearts of the brave, to regret should give place. The Genius of Erin from earth, Uprising, hath broken the bowl, Whose tide to a black-crested viper gave birth, That long dimmed the light of her soul; And millions of high-hearted men Who thus can wild passion restrain, Though driven for refuge to cavern and den, Will arm for the conflict againâ And, venturing all on the hazardous cast, Prove victors, though worn and outnumbered, at last. Thou isle, on the breast of the sea Like an emerald gracefully set, Though feet shod with iron have trampled on thee, A brightness belongs to thee yet: In bondage thy magical lyre Hath thrilled a wide world with its strains, And thine eloquent sons have awakened a fire That fast is dissolving thy chains:â The Saxon is watching the issue in fearâ He knows that thy day of redemption draws near. FLING OUT THAT STARRY BANNER. SONG OF WILLIAMS' LIGHT INFANTRY. Fling out that starry banner! We love its shining fold, A brighter never fluttered o'er The knightly men of old; And never muse of history Traced in her golden tome A prouder motto than it bears: âOur country and our home!â Fling out that starry banner! The wild winds love it well, Eyes flash to see its blazonry, And hearts with valor swell, Proud symbols graced thy battle-flag, Thou Queen of Victors, Rome! But on it flamed no words like these: âOur country and our home!â Fling out that starry banner! A sign of dread to foesâ Untwining from its staff around A radiant light it throws; Beneath it we will brave assault, As rocks the white sea-foamâ Strike for our wives and lady-loves, âOur country and our home!â SONG OF TEXAS. [AirââA life on the Ocean Wave.â] Make room on our banner bright That flaps in the lifting gale, For the orb that lit the fight In Jacinto's storied vale. Through clouds, all dark of hue, It arose with radiant face; Oh! grant to a sister true, Ye stars, in your train a place! The blood of the Saxon flows In the veins of men who cryâ âGive ear, give ear unto those Who pine for their native sky! We call on our mother-land For a home in Freedom's hallâ While stretching forth the hand, Oh! build not dividing wall! âThe Mexican vaunteth no more; In strife we have tamed his pride; The coward raps not at your door, Speak out! shall it open wide? Oh, the wish of our hearts is strong, That the star of Jacinto's fight Have place in the flashing throng That spangle your banner bright.â ERIN'S WAR-SONG. Up! Erin's battle-shout The tombs of old is wakingâ Fling the green banner out, The Saxon yoke is breaking! The heart-wrung sighs of centuries Will soon be hushed forever, And Slavery's brand our native land Again shall blacken never! Up! &amp;c. Bare to the light once more The blade that Brian wielded, When, 'mid wild battle's roar, The haughty Norseman yielded! Achievements high of days gone by Shall nerve us for the trial, Though drops are shed on valor's head From Fate's most deadly vial. Up! &amp;c Con of the Hundred Fights Awakes the green sod under; Fired are the beacon-lights, Our watch-word peals like thunder; Old Tara's lyre with chords of fire Unearthly hands are stringing, And the proud lays of other days Dim phantom forms are singing. Up! &amp;c. Swear by our martyred dead Whose praise sad bard hath spoken; Swear by the brave who bled When Felim's shield was broken, That Erin free, above the sea Shall lift her head long clouded, Or slain we'll rest, each pulseless breast In war's deep crimson shrouded! Up! Erin's battle-shout The tombs of old is wakingâ Fling the green banner out, The Saxon yoke is breaking! LAMENT OF AN AUSTERLITZ VETERAN. My glance was not fearfully dim, Nor the hair on my temples all hoary When, guided through danger by him, I came from the fight, red with gloryâ Old badges of valor recall The Hero that sleeps far from Gaul. When I think of that isle in the brine Where his cold, shrouded relics are lying, Where winds with rough surges combine, And his dirge are eternally sighingâ Tears, tears like the rain warmly fall For the Hero that sleeps far from Gaul. In dreams of the night I behold His legions to battle advancing, And conquering eagles unfold Bright wings o'er his cavalry prancing, And again I rejoice in the call Of thy world-waking trumpet, oh, Gaul! Once more, on my withering cheek, The storm of the Switzer is blowing And the vulture of war whets his beak Where the sands of the desert are glowing, And our Chief in the Mameluke tall Views a foe not unworthy of Gaul. Again the red war-eagle builds His perch in the tottering Kremlin, And the sunbeam of Austerlitz gilds The field with artillery trembling; But morning robs night of her pall, And I mourn the lost Hero of Gaul. I was steadfast to suffering France When the wild-winds of Faction blew on her, And Hate shook the murderous lance, And he gave me this bright cross of Honorâ These scars, won at Lodi, recall The Hero that sleeps far from Gaul If I could have stood by his bed When his soul, from the fetter that bound him, To mix with mad elements fled, That long had been warring around him, One heart would have burst as the pall Was flung o'er the Hero of Gaul. O would that yon Seine near his tomb Could wander, his requiem swelling, That the sunshine of France could illume The cold, earthen roof of his dwelling, That the tears of remembrance could fall On the grave of thy Hero, oh, Gaul! Repining is vain! near the place Where he moulders, the willow is trailing, And Ocean the rock-guarded base Of the desolate isle is assailing, And the storm-cloud alone weeps the fall Of the Hero that sleeps far from Gaul. INDEPENDENCE ODE. [AirââMarselloise Hymn.â] Ye sons of sires who gathered proudly Our flag of stars and stripes around, When rang the dread alarum loudly, And paled Oppression at the soundâ Bless Godâthe just, the Ever-living, Who guarded with his mighty shield Young Freedom on the battle-field, And shout an anthem of thanksgiving! Cheer on! cheer on the march Of mind throughout the globe, Till wit and worth ennoble man, Not crown and purple robe! That ground is hallowed where one martyr For holy truth contending dies, And vile are they who would not barter Gems, gold, and blood for such a prize; Oh! dark the doom is of that vassal, Lost in a maze of mental nightâ Too abject to maintain the right, Who hungers that his lord may wassailâ Then cheer, cheer on the march Of mind throughout the globe, Till wit and worth ennoble man, Not crown and purple robe. Our nation's dark and dismal morning Hath brightened into cloudless day, But notes of deep and fearful warning Call on the wise to watch and pray. From mountain, vale, and cavern lonelyâ From Lexington and Monmouth ground, Breathe out these words of solemn soundâ âIn union there is safety only!â Then cheer, cheer on the march Of mind throughout the globe, Till wit and worth ennoble man, Not crown and purple robe. The valor that found voice in thunder On Bunker's glorious battle-hill, And made the nations gaze in wonder, Is living yet, is burning still. Hark to the screaming of our eagle Where fly, before a dauntless band, The men of Montezuma's land, Like frightened hares before the beagle! Nine cheers, then, for the brave Whose fame will know no blight! They prove that mind wins mastery, Not numbers in the fight. A beacon on our coast is lighted That kindles up the gloom of earth, And guides the wanderer benighted To Freedom's altar-stone and hearth Would not our sires, entombed and sleeping, Leap with their rusty brands from dust, Should we prove faithless to the trust Sternly committed to our keeping? Yes, yes:âthen cheer the march Of mind throughout the globe, Till wit and worth ennoble manâ Not crown and purple robe. BATTLE-SONG OF THE POLISH LANCER. To saddle, to saddle, with lances in rest! By heel of the tyrant our greensward is pressedâ Yon Lord of the Balkan, while hurrying on Long columns of footmen and hordes from the Don, Dreams not that his laurels will wither to-dayâ That a whirlwind of horsemen will crush his array! Old Poland for ever! Though muskets rain lead, and black cannon belch fire, Beaten back by the shock, will the âLancers retire?â No!âan oath we have sealed, with the cross in our hands, To charge! though our foemen outnumber the sandsâ Aye, winged with the speed of a hurricane, ride Through the ranks of the Czar, as a ship cleaves the tide. Old Poland for ever! The war-note of Poland's âWhite Eagleâ we hear! He will scream soon a knell in the Muscovite's earâ Our chargers, impatient, are pawing the groundâ They long, like their riders, for trumpet to sound! Oh, when will the signal our bugleman blow, To bear like a thunderbolt down on the foe!â Old Poland for ever! While growl for red banquet these Bears of the North, From Warsaw's bright turrets the lovely look forth; Fair hands wrought the flag by our legion unrolledâ Bright eyes in the battle our deeds will behold: Oh, who would not forth for his country to fight, With the graves of her dead and her altars in sight! Old Poland for ever! SONGS AND BALLADS. THE POET'S HOME. Give answer, rolling waves! Where must the minstrel go To find some quiet land, Unvisited by woe? Some consecrated spot, Where partings are unknown, And on the violet turf A blight is never thrown? The waves reply, while bursting on the strand, âEarth, in her ample bounds, owns no such land.â Answer, ye voiceful winds! Where can the minstrel find A wreath amid whose leaves No cypress is entwined? A crown of beauteous flowers That may become a brow O'er which neglect's cold hand Hath driven Grief's dark plow? And the winds answer, âSunset hath not smiled, On wreath like this in all our wanderings wild.â Oh! answer, aged Earth! Where will the bard obtain Reward for airy dreams Created by his brain? A recompense for toil In haunts obscure and cold, While one by one his hopes, Expiring, turn to mould? Earth makes reply, âThe bard's reward is rest Under the green robe on his mother's breast.â Give answer, journeying birds, That northern fields forsake In quest of tropic grove, Green isle and sunny lakeâ Will ye not reach a clime Whose radiance may control The wild, unsated wish That haunts the poet's soul? And the birds warble, âBy our flight be taught That not in vain are homes of beauty sought.â Give answer, twinkling stars! For lord of lute and lay Cannot some kingdom fair Be found far, far away; Where sleep may fall like balm Upon his wounded powersâ A sunny land of calm, Unlike this world of ours? And the stars answer, âAt the fount of song, In heaven, no more the minstrel suffers wrong.â INDEPENDENCE ODE. When our fathers in vain sought redress from the throne, And the Tyrant grew mad in his thirst for dominionâ Earth shook, while the bugle of conflict was blown, And our Eagle unfolded his newly-fledged pinion: Men with hair thin and white, Bared their arms for the fight, And the lad of sixteen made the dull weapon bright, While gilding the battle-storm, rolling in wrath, The sunlight of freedom streamed full on their path. Fierce bands of Oppression were marshalled in vain, Though the Cross of St. George fluttered haughtily o'er them, Unmoved as the rock, beating backward the main, Frowned the phalanx of Liberty darkly before them: With the dying and dead Was the battle-field spread, And the rain of destruction fell reeking and red; But Britain soon learned that she could not prevail, For the war-shout of Washington rang on the gale. In earth, by their prowess and fortitude won, From the grasp of Invasion, our grandsires are sleeping, And proud are the columns that gleam in the sun, Where moss o'er each sepulchre slowly is creeping; But the triumphs of Art Can no glory impart, When the names of the mighty are traced on the heart, And deeds that have hallowed hill, valley, and shore, Are linked to the turf that they trod, evermore. The valor that burned in the breasts of our sires Is living in hearts of the free-born and daring, Who nobly, while poets are stringing their lyres, Our flag to the Mexican stronghold are bearing: Thronging hosts in the fray, Veiled the lustre of day With the smoke-cloud of guns, but their march could not stay, And earth feels the tread of their conquering feet, While the heart of an Empire is ceasing to beat. Proud heirs of a legacy bought by the sword, May the South and the North ever live in communion; May the vials of doom on the traitor be poured, Whose lip ever mutters that foul wordââDisunionââ Guard the Home of your birth Where the wretched of earth, When scourged by the Despot, find altar and hearth, And the splendor of Rome will be dim to the fame That our Land, in the Congress of Nations, will claim. KE-U-KA REVISITED. Crooked Lake. Loved Lake! I have seen thee once more, And the hills that slope down to thy wave, And gazed on thy picturesque shore, While nature a welcoming gave. Old woods, like the sun-bow arrayed, By the breath of October were stirred And music to soothe me was made By wind, singing ripple and bird. How sweet was the murmuring roll Of each wavelet that broke on the strand! And I thought I was wafted in soul From earth to some magical land. Circling over thy bosom of blue The light, graceful gull was afloat, And gravelly Bluff Point loomed to view From the deck of our beautiful boat. Though changed since the summit I trod In the deep green of summer-time drest, It towered a grand altar of God, And mist rose like smoke from its breast. My hat waved in air at the sight, And I cheered in my fullness of joy, While back came a sense of delight That I knew, when a wild, dreaming boy. The red man may well with a sigh Look there on a paradise lost, While the bones of his forefathers lie Exposed to the gale and the frost. His pines, so majestic of old, Stand dreary, like battle-thinn'd ranks; The stone of his altar is cold, His trail blotted out on thy banks. Ke-u-ka! thrice blest would I be, Could a home by thy waters be mine; No monarch beyond the blue sea Would drink such a draught of life's wine. My harp, draped no longer in black, Would wake to a rapturous strain; The dream of romance would come back, And my spirit grow youthful again. The child of my love has an eye Like the deep azure tint of thy breast, And her cheek wears the roseate dye On thy mirror by sunset impressed. I caught the bright gleam of her hair In thy swell, edged by morning with gold, And the snow of her forehead so fair In the flash of thy foam did behold. How grandly the wood-belted hills In thy surf dipped their gray, rocky feet, While leaped down a thousand bright rills, Like children their mother to greet! Three cheers for the steamer Steuben! May she aye be a stranger to wreck, Not forgetting that jewel of men, The Captain who paces her deck. THE ROSE-BUD. Methinks thy gift to wandering bard Who weaves for thee this careless strain, Will prove an amulet to guard From outward ill and inward pain. Oh! precious is the bud to me That once on thy fair bosom lay! For richest pearl in Omar's sea I would not barter it away. Thy touch hath made it, leaf and stem, A priceless and a hallowed thing, Meet for Titania's diadem While dancing in the fairy ring. When faded its voluptuous hue, A life will linger in the flower That needeth not sustaining dew, Or golden sunshine's nursing power. By day, and in the hush of night, Grief's shadow from my brow to chase, Its leaves will summon back to sight Thy graceful form and classic grace. To the bard's dreamy, gorgeous land In spirit may we often fly, And wander shadowy, hand in hand, Through rose-wreathed halls of fantasy. What nonsense have I written down! I am not self-possest to-dayâ On brow the world hath taught to frown The light of song should never play. Can âWitch Imaginationâ warm A heart whose passion-streams are dry? Mere man of parchment and of form, And slave of wrangling fools am I. Should maid, then, blest like thee, require From me the tributary rhyme? The peerless child of laurelled sire Will share his fame in after-time. Thou needest not the praise of one From whom life's romance is receding, Who haunts a land without a sunâ The barren realm of special pleading. Farewell! I quit thee with regret To struggle in the war of life; I would not for the world forget Thy words ofâhush! I have a wife, And two sweet childrenâone a boy Who wears the dark hair of his mother, And, full of innocence and joy, A radiant little girl the other. HUNTING SONG. Would that one I love were here Where the monarch-pine is waving, And the Susquehanna near, Broad, majestical and clear, Wanders on, the valley laving! Where tall peaks to kiss the cloud Far above his tide are swelling, Beauteous when a misty shroud Hovers round their foreheads proud, I would make my sylvan dwelling. Round my home the sun would throw Tints of rosy light when dying: Though the vale far, far below Warms not with a sunset glow, In a robe of shadow lying. From the blasted pine, his throne, I would mark with folded pinion, Feathered sovereign, fierce and lone, While the rocking boughs made moan, Gazing on his wild dominion. I would rove with hound and gun, When the dawn of day was breaking, And the dim stars, one by one, Paled before their lord, the sun, In a blaze of glory waking: I would blow a bugle-blast Loud romantic echoes rousing; Then, with footstep fleet and fast, Seek the greenwood deep and vast, Where the antlered deer are browsing. With the spoils of chase at night, Gladly to my home returning, I would haste, with footfall light, Guided by a beacon bright On my rugged hearth-stone burning. There my bride, in accent clear, While my frugal meal preparing, With a song would lull mine ear, And repay her mountaineer For a life of toil and daring THOUGH THY DREAR WORDS. âThe roses of my spirit, as well as of my cheeks are fled, and I fear, my friend, that the few pale flowers which are still lingering in the garden of my youth would soon become scentless and tasteless to you.â Stella. Though thy drear words are fraught with solemn truth, And the soft light of thy dark eye is waningâ Though roses in the garden of thy youth, Like mourners, few and frost-bleached, are remainingâ My heart with deep affection to its core Will thrill whenever thy sweet name is spoken, And love thee till its pulse can throb no more, And its frail chords are tuneless, stilled and broken. Think not that maid of more enticing mienâ Of lip more red, and darker, richer tresses, Though in the jewelled drapery of a queen Her form of Phidian witchery she dresses, Will teach me falsehood by her potent wiles, And the fond ties that knit our souls dissever, Or, with the dazzling radiance of her smiles, Dim Stella's image in my bosom ever. Though pain and sorrow on thy forehead fair Have left their deep and melancholy traces, I prize thy pensive mournfulness of air Far more than joys that kindle happier faces. I think of thee when Night is on her throne, And Dian in her car of pearl is riding, And when I wander in the woods alone Thy sylph-like figure in my path seems gliding. The wild, inconstant bird our northern bowers Forsakes, when winds are chill and leaves are dying; In quest of lands where ever blush the flowers Across the blue and briny waters flying:â Unlike that bird from thee I will not fly When the brief summer of thy bloom is ended, And with the tints of life a deadlier dye, That whispers of the winding-sheet, is blended. Ah! if it be thy destiny to lie In the cold hall of dreamless rest before me, My tears, until the fount of grief is dry, Will 'dew the funeral turf that blossoms o'er thee: Nor will I worship, with adoring gaze, Some dawning orb of loveliness, forgetting The lost, extinguished star of other days That flung on me its latest beam while setting. FLORENCE AND PAUL. By ocean's rocky ledges She clasped his wasted hand, And the surf, with whitening edges, Came booming to the land. His sweet, pale face, wore everâ By day and twilight loneâ The look of one who never Had childish pastime known: But love, unto each other, Had closely knit the pairâ Why, with her little brother, Came gentle Florence there? PAUL. Hark! dearest sister, hearken! To that low, mournful strain, While landward breezes darken The mirror of the main. Is it the snow-gull glancing, A rover wild and freeâ Far off the white-caps dancing, Or phantoms that I see? FLORENCE. I hear no voice of sorrow Of roaring ocean born, And his azure garments borrow Fresh lustre from the morn. A misty mantle covers The waters far away, And nothing ghostly hovers Above the dashing spray. PAUL. A lady beckons, sister! Who pale and shrouded seems, Oh! I have often kissed her, And talked to her in dreams. Her presence wakes within me Vague memories of the past; Oh! would that she might win me To her embrace at last. HEBREW MELODY. âThou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that our prayers should not pass through.ââ Lamentations, 3:44. We have prayed, in the midnight deep, For Salem doomed by thee; Oh! when will thine anger sleep, And our fettered limbs be free? Her princes wail aloud, And fly while foes pursueâ âThou hast covered thyself with a cloud, That our prayers should not pass though.â Joy of the earth no more, Her strongholds are destroyed, And the glittering crown she wore Of brightness is devoid. For sackcloth, lo! the proud Change robes of scarlet hueâ âThou hast covered thyself with a cloud, That our prayers should not pass through.â For corn and wine in vain Her famished children call, And drugged is the cup they drain With the wormwood and the gall: In dust are the mighty bowed With their ruined homes in viewâ âThou hast covered thyself with a cloud, That our prayers should not pass through.â She, on whose queenly head The gifts of heaven were showered, Droops, widowed by the dead, With watching overpowered. The tears of a ghastly crowd Her walks and courts bedewâ âThou hast covered thyself with a cloud, That our prayers should not pass through.â LAY OF THE CRUSADER. Ginevra!âGinevra!â Thy girlish lip is mute: And silent, in ancestral hall, Hangs now thy gilded lute. With trophies from the Holy Land Hath come thine own true knight, To wildly wish the desert sand Had drank his blood in fight! Ginevra!âGinevra! By palmer wert thou told That, on the plains of Palestine, My corse was lying cold; And, credence giving to the tale, Went up wild prayer to die, While suddenly thy cheek grew pale, And lustreless thine eye. Ginevra!âGinevra!â No more thy lulling voice, When twilight paints the sky, will trill The ballad of my choice. Thy parting gift, my buried bride, Will nerve this arm no more, When speeds my barb with fetlock dyed In Saracenic gore. Ginevra!âGinevra! Death holds in icy thrall Thy loveliness of form and face In his unlighted hall. With laurels from the Holy Land Hath come thine own true knight, To wildly wish the desert sand Had drank his blood in fight. A FESTAL SONG. Fill high, fill high, with good old wine, The bowl our fathers drainedâ Fill high, fill high, though its golden rim By the mist of age is stained. In nectar now bedew the lips, And wake the voice of song, For clouds will gather, and eclipse The light of bliss ere long. Fill high, fill high, with good old wine, The cup our fathers drainedâ Fill high, fill high, though its golden rim By the mist of age is stained. The foam-bells on the ruby tide Are types of passing things, Reminding us that Joy soon diesâ That gray-beard Time hath wingsâ And a few more days will dawn and end, A few more moons wax old, Ere friend will darkly follow friend To homes in church-yard mould. Fill high, fill high, with good old wine, The bowl our fathers drainedâ Fill high, fill high, though its golden rim By the mist of age is stained. Around this ancient festal board Glad spirits met of yore, But their merry strains are hushed in deathâ Their laugh will ring no more: Under the yew trees, mossed and green, May their quiet graves be found; But in soul they hover nigh unseen, While tale and jest go round. Then fill high, fill high, with good old wine, The bowl our fathers drainedâ Fill high, fill high, though its golden rim By the mist of age is stained. HEART SHADOWS. âMe nec fÅmina, nec puer Jam, nec spes animi credula mutui, Nec certare juvat mero, Nec vincire novis tempora floribus.â Horace. The rack that weaves a vapory pall Between the sun and earth, Soon passes, and the birds again Make melody and mirth; But, ah! there is a darker cloud That will not thus depart, But flings, though roll away the years, A shadow on the heart. The dim and misty veil that drapes A sombre April sky, Is kindled, now and then, by gleams Of day's bright golden eye; But through a denser, darker cloud The sunbeam cannot dartâ It coldly flings for evermore A shadow on the heart. It may be study that has brought This deep, abiding gloomâ Blind, erring Love, whose roses frail Catch odors from the tomb; Or Pleasure wild, that beckons us To sail without a chart, May fling, till o'er the stormy cruise, A shadow on the heart Let Music wake her sweetest note, And Joy his loudest strainâ The light that cheered and warmed of old Comes never back again: The mantle of a night that morn In twain will never part, Flings heavily for evermore Chill shadows on the heart. A WAIL. Wail! wail! wail! Filling earth with the soundâ Alas, the Old Year Lieth dead and discrown'd! Happy dreams, sunny joys, Pleasant thoughts that we cherished, Were born while he ruled, And with him have they perished; A phantom with scythe And frail glass hurried by Who palsied his limbs, And who curtained his eye. Croak! croak! croak! Outcalleth the crow, Perched on the tree-top A prophet of woe! Black are his vestments, And vigil he keepeth Over the spot where The weary one sleepeth. Fled have bright schemes With the year that is gone, And pall o'er the coffin Of love hath been drawn. Wail! wail! wail! The knell of the year Telleth children of dust That the night-time is nearâ That Beauty in vain Watcheth over her flowerâ That her march to the grave Groweth faster each hour: Wail! wail! wail! Filling earth with the sound, Alas! the Old Year Lieth dead and discrown'd. THE GIRLS OF SONG. Come back to memory, and wear Your chaplets of poetic glory, Bright Laura of the golden hair, And Tasso's royal Leonora! But wakeners of a brighter throng Of pleasant thoughts and visions airy, Are those immortal Girls of Songâ Sweet âBonny Jeanâ and âHighland Mary.â Fair picture to poetic eye Is Una with her white lamb straying, Or Rosalind, a masquer sly, The part of boy in Arden playing; But never toward those rustic belles My heart will in attachment vary Who weave for me poetic spellsâ Young âBonny Jeanâ and âHighland Mary.â I love, in inspiration's hour While Fancy her weird realm discloses, To think of love's own passion flower, Young Juliet with her wreath of roses. But never walked elysian plain, Or lingered in the âLand of FaÃ«ryâ Forms dearer than that precious twainâ Blithe âBonny Jeanâ and âHighland Mary.â The lassies still are young and fair, Defying Death and Time's endeavor; Their lover was the Bard of Ayr, And in his lay they live forever. Methinks the sun would be less brightâ Less beautiful the welkin starry, Had never woke to life and light, Blithe âBonny Jeanâ and âHighland Mary.â THE HALLOWED WELLS OF LEARNING. The hallowed wells of Learning No wasting may they know, But sparkle, fed by lucid streams, Unceasing in their flow; And may their waters catch no stain Of deep and Stygian dye, Though error for an hour hold reign Beneath a darkened sky. The sacred bowers of Learning, Be blight apart from them! No tree grow up with serpent-folds Entwining round the stem; No bud of precious promise feel The frost of cold neglect, And heard no solemn funeral peal For Genius early wrecked. The stately halls of Learning, Forever may they stand! And Truth walk down the sounding aisles, With Honor hand in hand; The columns that uphold the roof Be men of noble mould, And beauteous daughters, armed in proof, Stern war with wrong to hold. The holy shrines of Learning, May no polluting flame Be lighted on one altar-stone By fiends who mock at shame; But cloudless light be shed abroad A guilty world to cheer, And men forget to worship God In superstitious fear. ODE. IN COMMEMORATION OF THE SETTLEMENT OF WESTERN NEW YORK. High was the homage senates paid To the plumed conquerors of old And freely at their feet were laid Rich piles of flashing gems and gold Proud History exhausted thoughtâ Glad bards awoke their vocal reeds While Phidian hands the marble wrought In honor of their wond'rous deeds; But our undaunted pioneers Have conquests more enduring won, In scattering the night of years, And opening forests to the sun: And victors are they nobler far Than the helmed chiefs of other times, Who rolled their chariots of war In other lands and distant climes. Earth groaned beneath those mail-clad men, Bereft of beauty where they trodâ And wildly rose from hill and glen Loud, agonizing shrieks to God Purveyors to the carrion-bird, Blood streamed from their uplifted swords, And while the crash of states was heard, Swept on their desolating hordes. Then tell me not of heroes fledâ Crime renders foul their boasted fame, While widowed ones and orphans bled They earned the phantom of a name. The sons of our New England sires, Armed with endurance, dared to roam Far from the hospitable fires, And the green, hallowed bowers of home. Distemper, leagued with famine wan, Nerved to a high resolve, they bore, And flocks upon the thymy lawn Ranged where the panther yelled before. Look now abroad! the scene how changed Where fifty fleeting years ago, Clad in his savage costume, ranged The belted lord of shaft and bow. No more a woody waste, the land Is rich in fruits and golden grain, And clustering domes and temples stand On upland, river, shore and plain. In praise of Pomp let fawning Art Carve rocks to triumph over yearsâ The grateful incense of the heart Give to our living Pioneers. Almighty! may thine outstretched arm Guard, through long ages yet to be, From tread of slave, and kingly harm, Our Eden of the Genesee. A SCOTTISH BALLAD. âWe perish, or avenge him!â The fierce Mc Ians cried, When, stricken by an arrow, The brave young Ronald died. Noon saw them stem the battle With targe and broad claymore, But moonlight fell upon them Crouched darkly in their gore. Mourn, mourn, ye houseless widows! Ye orphan children, wail! Nor son, nor sire, nor brother Come back to tell the tale! Ho! pale and plaided maiden, Of light, but hurried treadâ Thy quest is vain; for Ronald, Thy Highland lad, is dead! At last she found her lover Stretched on the dewy turfâ His face, all streaked with crimson, Colder than wintry surf. The brooch on his hushed bosom Flashed in the wan moonlight, And low and dirge-like music Rose on the blast of night. She wildly kissed his cold lips, And over him she spread Her chequered plaid, believing Its warmth might wake the dead. Poor, crazed, heart-broken Flora, Thy time of woe was brief, For blue-eyed morning found thee A corse beside thy chief! Deep grave the herdsmen hollowed Within the valley lone, And there ye rest together Without memorial-stone. THE POLE'S FAREWELL. Warsaw, farewell! alone that word Fame's dark eclipse recalls; The voice of wail alone is heard Within her ruined wallsâ Her pavement rings beneath the tread Of bondsmen by a master led. Hope kindles on my native shore No more her beacon-firesâ The northern Bear is trampling o'er The dust of fallen sires, And signal ever to destroy Has been his growl of savage joy. Oh! for one hour of glory goneâ An arm of might to hurl The Czar in thunder from his throne, And Freedom's flag unfurl; Then welcome like a bride the grave Unbranded by the name of slave. Our snow-white Eagle The ensign of Poland is a White Eagle. screams no more Defiance high and loud; The wing is broken that could soar Through battle's smoky cloud, And wounded by a coward's spear, His perch is now lost Poland's bier. Once happy was the hall of home, Now desolation's lairâ Blood stains its hearth, and I must roam, A pilgrim of despair, Leaving, when heart and brain grow cold, My weary bones in foreign mould. THE PRESS. Ere the glorious Art that we love was invented, Restoring the lustre Earth wore in her morn, A picture the map of creation presented, How bleak and forbiddingâhow lost and forlorn! More dark than the midnight of dreary November, A pall was spread over the region of mind; The fires of the past had gone out, and no ember Was saved from the wreck to illumine mankind. The Genius of Liberty, bleeding and fettered, Lay mute and heart-crushed in a pestilent cave, While cowled Superstition, morose and unlettered, Consigned with rude hand murder'd Hope to the grave. Truth walked through the world with a visage dejected, And Error, appareled in sable, was King; The harp of the poet hung mute and neglected, The red rust of ages corroding each string. Then hail to the Press, by which fetters were broken, And dungeons unbarred to the visit of dayâ Our glorious Art, that in thunder hath spoken, The night-hag of Ignorance chasing away. Plumed minions of pomp, with their pageantry hollow, Before its effulgence dissolving, grew pale, As vapory clouds at the smile of Apollo Roll back, and the face of the waters unveil. And hail to our brother, calm Tamer of Lightning, The pride of his country and terror of kings! Whose fame, though his body is dust, ever bright'ning A pure, holy light on America flings. The Staff of the Sage in his hand was a weapon That aided in conflict a Washington's glaive; While guard we the relic, no foe will dare step on The green turf that covers a patriot's grave. SERENADE. List, lady, listen, While brightly glisten The lulling waves in the sweet starlight, For music hath woke Her echoes, and broke The dreamy hush of the summer night. Fairies awaking Dells are forsaking The magic fall of my strain to hear:â Star of my being! Darkness is fleeing, And sprites, in the green-wood born, are near. Wake, dearest, waken, Moonbeams have taken From queenly Night an eclipsing cloudâ Billows kiss brightly My skiff rocking lightly Beneath the porch of thy dwelling proud. Angels are near me, Water-nymphs hear me, Their pearl-cars float on the glassy tideâ Winds have been wooing, With whisper subduing, Blossoms that blush on the mountain side. While wavelets glisten, List, lady, listen, For notes to the landward breeze are given Sweet as that lay Thou wilt hearken alway When thy soul leaves Earth to gladden Heaven. FISHING SONG OF SHETLAND. The mermen who dwell In the fathomless deep Are lulling the turbulent Billows to sleep; And will leave soon their Cold, sparry caverns to guide The bark of the fisherman Over the tide. In the halls of Valhalla Dwell none but the bold; We will rival in daring Our fathers of oldâ They thought not of danger While plying the oar, And left to the coward The hovel on shore. In childhood our nurse Was the murmuring sea, The roar of its waters Proclaimsâwe are free. The thunder of waves, and The shriek of the gale Keep time to our voices While trimming the sail. Our wives blandly smiling Will greet our return; On the hearth, the red peat-fire Will merrily burn. The sky is serene, and The ocean, this day, To our bearded harpoons A rich tribute shall pay. THE SEA-NYMPH'S SONG. Sound is he sleeping Far under the wave, Sea-nymphs are keeping A watch for the brave: Deep was our grief and wildâ Wilder our dirge When the doomed Ocean Child Drowned in the surge. Within a bright chamber His form we have laid; With spar, pearl, and amber The walls are arrayedâ Though high rolls the billow, He wakes not at morn, And sponge for his pillow From rocks we have torn. I heard thy name spoken When down came the mast, His hold was then brokenâ That word was his last. A picture is lying, Lorn maid! on his breastâ That picture in dying His hand closely prest. Why turns thy cheek paler These tidings to know? The truth of thy sailor Should lessen thy woe: The wave could not chill it That stifled his breath; Pure loveâcan aught kill it? Give answer, oh, Death! JUNIPER ISLE. Oh! fairy scenes are in many lands, Bright lawns lie spread amid desert sands; Green Edens, swept by the cooling breeze, Their brows lift up above Indian seas, While the billows break, in lengthened swells, And strew the shore with rose-lipped shells; But Nature in her loveliest spotâ Arcadian bower, or Egerian grot, Gave never the light of a sweeter smile Than rests on the face of the Juniper Isle. A bow-shot or more, from its gleaming strand, A rock looms up all dark and grand, Girt by an azure, watery zone, Like faith in a shifting world alone: Old hills beyond, a continuous chain, Give bounds to the realm of proud Champlain, And clothed in robes of cerulean dye Resemble clouds that have left the sky, Woo'd down by the scene's romantic charms, Like Dian to young Endymion's arms. Back memory will often stray To the quiet scene of that summer day When I heard the combing billows break On the polished beach of the breezy lake; But the brightest feature of the scene, Though skies were clear, the meadows green, And airy tongues, dispelling care, Made musical both earth and air, Was nature's gem, the Juniper Isle, That basked in the sunset's golden smile. THE HEARTH-CRICKET. I love thy chirping notes, Black watchman of the night! They summon from the cloudy past Bright hours of lost delight. The wildwood haunts of home In thought I tread once moreâ Rock, thicket, glade, and torrent wear The loveliness of yore. Around the lighted hearth That gave thee lodging warm While fell the cold, November rain Or howled the wintry storm, In calm contentment meet The forms of vanished days, And voices of familiar tone Breathe old, remembered lays. When eve again returns, Steal forth on nimble feet From cranny in the chimney-wall, Thy tempest-proof retreat; For thy shrill, household song Is worker of a spell Whereby that thief, Forgetfulness, Unlocks his treasure-cell Re-visiting in soul My father's rose-wreathed cot, The briers of this âwork-day worldâ Awhile torment me notâ The loved and long-lost dead Seem palpable to sight, Awakened by thy chirping note, Black watchman of the night! MY LOVEDâMY OWN. Nor the hush of the shadowy night, Nor the glare of the busy day, Nor the many cares of the world, from thee Ever lure my thoughts away. In dreams thou art by my side, With thy babe, a rose unblown, And thy voice for me breathes melody, My lovedâmy own! The page of the laurell'd bard Thrills me not, since thou art gone; And from earth below, and the sky above, Is an olden charm withdrawn. Come back with thy beaming smile, For my heart is mournful grownâ Fast the wild bird flies, when her sad mate cries, My lovedâmy own! I have prayed for a spell whereby I might question the wind of thee, And learn if thy cheek was flushed with health, Or wan while afar from me. And I start when the casement jars, And I hear a hollow moan, But the churlish gale will tell no tale, My lovedâmy own! Not sooner the noon-parch'd flower, Would revive in summer rain, Than a glimpse of thee and my laughing boy Would my sick heart heal again. We have been, since wed, like leaves By the breath of autumn blown; But home's green bowers may yet be ours, My lovedâmy own! LAMENT OF A SPIRIT. Down poured the sleet, when ceased to beat The pulse of the poor Old Year; And at midnight hour, a voice of power From dreams I woke to hear: âHe lieth low in a robe of snow,â It shouted in thrilling tonesâ âProud heir! unmeet is such winding-sheet For thy father's royal bones. âOn his frozen corse with pitiless force The blows of Winter fall, While light feet bound to the viol's sound In Pleasure's glittering hall: And the crownless head of a Monarch dead Reclines on a snowy bank, While wine is poured at the festal board, And thy health with plaudits drank. âNo bell is tolled for the slumberer oldâ No bier with sable hung; Save the hollow moan of the blast alone, No âullalullaâ sung:â He felt the smart of a broken heart When the flowers grew pale and died, And the leafy crown of the oak grew brown, And tattered his robe of pride. âGo through the storm to the lifeless form Of thy royal sire, and see What thyself ere long, though young and strong, Gay reveller, wilt be! My warning mark!âround thy body stark The night-blast too shall raveâ Twelve flaps of the wing of Time, proud King, Shall waft thee to thy grave.â THE MARINER'S WELCOME HOME. âMusic, when soft voices die, Vibrates in the memory.ââ Shelley. She knew me not, although her breast Had pillowed oft my head, And thought I long had been at rest With Ocean's ghostly dead. Full on my wan and wasted face She fixed her melancholy gaze; But there, alas! she could not trace The look of other days. She knew me not!âthe flight of time An iron form will bow; And bondage in a tropic clime Had darkened cheek and brow: I spoke of friends with look cast down, Who shared her joy in better hoursâ Whom Death had added to his crown Of darkly folded flowers:â In vain!âthe mourning one no glance Of love or welcome gave; She thought beneath the blue expanse Of ocean was my grave: I then sang airs that in the cell Of hoarding memory long had slept, And with a look tongue cannot tell, She clasped my neck and wept. CHRISTABEL. Sick at heart, I have retreated From the dance to muse alone In this bower where, often seated By thy side, the hours have flown. Here, in accents sweetly thrilling, Words of magic import fell From thy lip, my bosom filling With mad transport, Christabel! Thou wilt live, with brow unclouded And a look like summer skies, When thy victim, early shrouded, In his voiceless dwelling lies. Blossoms on the floor lie faded, Brought by me from wood and dell, That were yester-morning braided With thy locks, false Christabel! Nightly here thy ardent lover, While swift time unnoted fled, From yon book with gilded cover, Tales of burning passion read. Long within the deep recesses Of my breaking heart, will dwell (Though thy smile another blesses) Our last parting, Christabel! LAMPS OF SILVER HANG ABOVE Lamps of silver hang above me, Shedding floods of rosy light, And the looks of those who love me, Chide my cold reserve to-night. Leafy coronals are flinging Round their gifts of odor sweet; Vaulted roof and floor are ringing With the fall of dancing feet. While young Joy, with tress unbraided, Charms with viol-note the ear, Darkly is my forehead shadedâ Thou art not here! Often, often have I lifted To my lip the cup of mirth, When the beautiful and gifted Crowded round the festal hearth. Once this aching heart, of brighter, Gayer feelings, was the shrine, And no dancing foot fell lighter In the mazy reel than mine. Ruby lips are breathing gladnessâ Eyes of fawn-like ray are near; Why, then, is my brow all sadness? Thou art not here! OUR FATHERS. Renown to the bandâthat free, bold band Who forsook the paternal hall, And in maze lone of a wild unknown Dared to rear the cabin-wall! The wolf from his lair fled with bristling hair, And old Night from his couch upsprung, For his slumber was broke by the clashing oakâ The knell of his empire rungâ Then praise to the bandâthat free, bold band Who went forth from paternal hallâ Nor the wintry gale, nor famine pale Could their storm-proof hearts appall. Where roved the wild man, with his whooping clan, In the vale of the Genesee, Now the lap of art, and the busy mart Hold the spoils of land and sea: Proud vessels ride on the waters wide Where darted the birch canoeâ Like a ghost of the night scared by morning light, Fled the grovesâall moss'dâfrom view. Then praise to the bandâthat free, bold band Who forsook the paternal hallâ Nor the wintry gale, nor famine pale Could their storm-proof hearts appall. IBLA. Rise, Ibla, rise! From cloudless skies Look down the moon and stars; And near the shore With boat and oar, Keep watch, my gallant tars. Oh, fly this hold of Turkish power, For land beyond the wave, Where woman lives a cherished flower, And not a gold-bought slave! Fear not the guard! Through buckler hard His heart my dagger found; And redly now His turbaned brow Lies pillowed on the ground. Haste, Ibla, haste!âmy bark for thee Flings out her canvas white, And the blue waters of the sea Will leave no trace of flight! TWIN ACORNS. On one fair stem two acorns grew, Browned by the golden summer weather; Together drank the silvery dew, Rocked in the lulling air together. Crown jewels of the royal oak, A brief, brief time his forehead wore them, For the black tempest came, and broke The leaf-fringed diadem that bore them. When the wild storm was overpast, A maiden, through the forest hieing, Chancing around her eye to cast, Found the twin acorns lowly lying. She picked them up with hand of snow, A lesson from their fate to borrow, Deeming them types of love in woe, Of two fond hearts unchanged by sorrow: SayingââWhen suns no longer shine, And the red rose of joy is blighted, Oh, that some breast would beat with mine, True to the last, and disunited!â LOVE'S STAR. Though friendship's clear moonlight is sweet, Rose, With falsehood its glow is replete, Roseâ The sunbeam of joy is a cheat, Rose, But fadeless is Love's holy light; It shines, though the storm-demon rave, Rose, And gilds with a halo the grave, Rose, When gone are the fair and the brave, Rose, Restoring their features to sight. My bosom was colder than stone, Rose, And long was I cheerless and lone, Rose, But full on my darkness hath shone, Rose, An orb in Love's canopy set; While cheered on my course by its ray, Rose, That turns the deep night into day, Rose, Though fame and its visions betray, Rose, A heart to press on have I yet. ROSE OF THE DESERT. FROM THE ARABIC. Sweet Rose of the Desert! thy Hassan will never The glow of thy beauty with treachery blight, For curses would rest on his spirit for ever If false to the vow he has plighted to-night. In regions of bliss I will fashion thy dwelling, And teach blushing vales to re-echo thy name: There forests drop balm, and the fountain is welling, A mirror of light in an emerald frame. The cinnamon tree will wave gently above theeâ The timid gazelle like an arrow whiz by; Dream not of affliction, for Hassan will love thee, Though time rob thy lip of its coralline dye. My charger is neighing, impatient to bear thee From wastes that nurse only the deadly simoom; I came not in meshes of love to ensnare thee, Then leave thee forsaken, with blight on thy bloom. FALSE LADY! NO MORE SHALT THOU TRIFLE. False Lady! no more shalt thou trifle With one who was faithful to theeâ Dissembler! henceforth I will stifle Each throb of affection for thee. The hand that I prized as a jewel To others I gladly resign; A nature inconstant and cruel Shall never be-mated with mine. Old poets have feigned that a Fairy Of peerless deportment and charms, First tempted her victim to marry, Then turned to a hag in his arms: Thy beauty thus veiled for a season A heart that was hollow and cold, But Love turned to ashes when reason Detected the counterfeit gold. LUCY'S DIRGE. [The subject of the following tribute was chosen May Queen by her mates. When the day of festivity arrived, she lay wrapped in her little shroud.] âShe was not made Through years or moons the inner weight to bear Which colder hearts endure till they are laid By age in earth.ââ Byron. May is here with golden tresses, Tresses wreathed with flowersâ Tresses starred with dew-drops gleaming, In the pleasant south-wind streaming, Giving many-colored dresses To the fields and bowersâ May is here with golden tresses, Tresses wreathed with flowers. May is here, my little maiden, Maiden passing fair! Maiden like a seraph gifted, Ever high in thought uplifted Earth above with sorrow laden, Darkness and despairâ May is here, my little maiden, Maiden passing fair! Hark! a voice replieth sadly, Sadly like a dirgeâ Sadly like some childless mourner: âTo the church-yard they have borne her, And torn hearts are throbbing madly, Washed by sorrow's surgeââ Hark! a voice replieth sadly, Sadly like a dirge: âOh! she longed for May to greet her With a honeyed kissâ Greet her where bright eyes are glancing And the forms of sylphs are dancing In the sunny lawns to meet her With the boon of blissâ Oh! she longed for May to greet her With a honeyed kiss. Ah! the sun of May is sailing Through yon azure deepâ Sailing with a face unclouded; But sweet Lucy, pale and shrouded, Heareth not the voice of wailing In her dreamless sleep, Though the sun of May is sailing Through yon azure deep. Like the wondrous flower she faded That unfolds at nightâ Faded, but in fields Elysian She rejoiceth angel vision, While a wreath for her is braided That will know no blightâ Like the wondrous flower she faded That unfolds at night. Oh! too oft the ghostly reaper Moweth down the youngâ Reaper of the scythe unsparing, For the stricken little caring, Though they bend above the sleeper With their hearts unstrungâ Oh! too oft the ghostly reaper Moweth down the young. Fare thee well! bright child of heaven! Heavenly dreams were thineâ Heavenly beauty gave forewarning Of departure in life's morning, And to thee a soul was given Filled with thoughts divineâ Fare thee well! bright child of heaven! Heavenly peace is thine. MY CHILD. A knell is ringing In the belfry of my soul; Voices are singing That wildly breathe of dole. The lyre I waken Is draped with funeral black; One away is taken Who never can come back. She was my fairest, A child of promise bright; Beauty, the rarest, Is first to feel the blight. I think of her nightly, When home is far away, And visions brightly Around my pillow play. The thought is pleasant, That she is by my side; In spirit present, My wandering feet to guide. SONG TO STELLA. Young rovers on life's changeful sea, By darkening tide and wild wind driven, Full many miles from home are we, And friends who made that home a heaven. Fair scenes are round us, and the flowers In winter's lap are sweetly growing And sunny rills through laurel bowers, Alive with birds, are brightly flowing:â But still our thoughts will wander back, And seek the haunts of laughing childhood, Though there with storm the sky is black, And faded are the lawn and wild-wood Here gentle airs and pleasant gales Sweep o'er the blossoming savannah, But dearer are thy storied vales, Dark Genesee and Susquehannah! Our northern groves their charm have lost, For the green crowns they wore are faded, And the cold fingers of the frost Wan wreaths have round the hill-top braided. But in the halls of home, my love! Warm hearts a summer-time are making, Though white the roof with snow above, And storm without is uproar waking. FAREWELL TO AVON. Dear Avon! my home, looking down on a vale By its river of sweet waters beautiful made; Sad music is wandering by on the gale, And dim lie the scenes of my childhood in shade. Above is the roof that protected my head From tempest and rain when an innocent child, Beneath the same floor that rang out with my tread When beat my young pulses in ecstasy wild. Around me are objects that greeted my sight When hope gave the future a chaplet of light; And memories, mournful but pleasant, from rest, Like ghosts that are summoned, awake in my breast. The desolate moment of parting is near, And care on my forehead sits mantled in gloomâ Not sadder is maid bending over the bier Whereon lies her chosen one drest for the tomb; When the toil and loud tumult of daylight are o'er, And a family group take their seats by the hearth, One sigh for the absentâI ask for no more! A wish he were present to share in the mirth. I shall miss, when the gale of adversity blows That being who guarded my cradle-reposeâ Where Ocean is baring his breast to the storm, In visions her kiss on my cheek will be warm. On the morrow I part with my reverend sire, And vacant my place in his hall will be soonâ Full early the spirit of song on my lyre Will sleep, for the chords have been long out of tune; The rich, airy dreams of poetical days, Like the vapor of morning, have faded away. On thy loveliness, Avon! the stranger will gaze, When moulders thy bard in his grave far away: On the spot where my lute was first tunefully strung, It is meet, it is meet that my last lay be sung; Dear home! where companions and relatives dwell, Fate calls me awayâfare thee well! fare thee well! A SCOTTISH SONG. Giftie we gie, brother! giftie we gie! Not yellow gowd, nor pale pearl frae the sea; Though they may glimmer brighter than simmer, Richer by far is the giftie we gie. Mair meet than this warl's gear for lad wha can sing The wood-notes of Rob, is the buik that we bring; The strains of a bardie whase sang canna dee Have hallowed the page of the giftie we gie. Loved name of the dead on its cover behold! Oh! would we could warm up the heart that is cold! In soul he is present, though viewless to ee, While sadly, dear brother! this giftie we gie. FUNERAL ECHOES. THE DROWNED BOY. âGive sorrow words.ââ Shakspeare. A cup of bitter waters has been drained, And o'er ye, mourners, roll the clouds of woe! He, the beloved and beautiful, who made Your mansion, yester noon, the home of joy, Lies on a dreamless couch. Poor heart-wrung sire! And was the task of trial thine to bear From Allan's fatal stream, that luckless boy And his drowned play-mate? Aye, that task was thine! Parental instinct guided thee through gloom To the drear scene of death; the lost was found, But oh! in form and lineament how changed! Locked were his fingers in a rigid clasp; His eye, late beaming with affection, dim; His cheek, that felt a mother's morning kiss, All swollen and discoloredâgone its rose; And the bright locks that she had often smoothed, Or parted on his brow with gentle hand, Drenched, soiled and matted by the cruel waves. It was a time of jubilee, and noise Of festal cheer was on the breeze of night, But thou wert conscious of thy loss alone, And heard it not. In dull, unmeaning words, Why tell of the return to home's sad bower, A cold and lifeless burthen in thine arms, The mother's shriek while bending o'er her child, Fraught with a wild, unutterable woe, Shroud, funeral, darkened bier and swelling mound? Turn we away from scenes like this, and dwell On the bright virtues of the early dead, Who was your prideâthe first-born of your house! The flowers of seven summers had he seen When the waves wrapped him in their cold embrace; But during his brief pilgrimage on earth His tongue was ever musical with truthâ His breast the spotless altar-place of love: Kind, dutiful, and full of budding thought That promised fruitage in maturer years, Tinged by unshadowed wisdom's golden light, He was the cherished idol of fond hearts, A star of hope in life's beclouded sky. I know that ye will miss him morn and eve: A vacant seat by saddened board and hearth, His idle implements of boyish sport, The pictured book on which he loved to gaze, The rounded hoop that he will roll no more, And raiment that his beauteous form once graced, Hanging unused, will often call up tears From agony's unsounded sunless depths:â But comfort feel ye, parents, in your grief, To think that ye have reared a saint for Heavenâ A radiant spirit for that better land, Where Death, the skeleton, has never breathed Blight on the passing wind! A few more years, Like twilight's flitting hues, will pass away, And earth's extinguished lamps will fling once more Around our feet the light of other daysâ The precious fragments of the âgolden bowlâ Be fashioned into symmetry againâ Ties rudely sundered in this âweary landâ Once more unite, while Sorrow, changed to Joy, Divests her limbs of sackcloth, and walks forth, Arrayed in garments brighter than the stars. DIRGE OF AN INFANT. Cold on the bier he liesâ Light from his azure eyes Early hath fled: Tinged like the sky of morn, Sweet roses, newly born, Pillow his head. Ah! the refreshing air With his bright silken hair Playeth in vain; Never, in rosy rest, Will a maternal breast Shield him again. Soft wind, or sunny ray Warmth to that frame of clay Cannot restore; There he lies coldly sweetâ His little heart will beat Wildly no more. Hush! should the heart be wrung When the beloved and young Blossom-like die? When souls from human strife And the mad war of life Heavenward fly? WEBSTER. âOmnes eodem cogimur.ââ Horace. A cloud is over Marshfield, and the wail Of a vast empire floats upon the gale; One without peer has shaken hands with death, And yielded to the elements his breath: Admonished that the last great change was nigh, Majestic in decline, he came to die Back to the rural scenes he loved so well, Cheered by the low of kine, and pastoral bellâ Back, where his ear once more might catch the roll Of the roused Oceanâsymbol of his soul! The agony is o'erâthe goal is wonâ Earth opens to receive her greatest son! The world seems poorer now, the sky less fair, And reigns a brooding sadness everywhere! Mourn, stern New England! mother of the dead! Bow to the dust thy richly laurelled head! He was thy prideâthe prop of thy renownâ The brightest jewel in thy dazzling crown; Thy battle-fields of liberty he trod, Holding thy soil in reverence next to God, And the proud triumphs of his matchless mind Are closely with thy heart-strings intertwined. Well may ye mourn, confederated states! For what a void a loss like this creates; A crowning glory from the land is gone, And a dark pall seems over nature drawn. He was our boldest watchman on the tower, Our strongest champion in the trial hour; Through all disguises could his magic glance, Eager and keen, detect a foe's advance; First by his voice was loud alarum pealed, Uplifted first his interposing shield: Discordant horn in vain sedition blew, While pale with fear the front of Treason grew. Unawed by threats he gave the stroke of fate To howling Faction, Fraud, and barking Hate; And in defence of ancient landmarks stood A guardian lion of the public good. A varied lore enriched his high discourse Grandly pronounced in words of Saxon force, While arguments, in logical array, Aught that opposed swept easily away. Grace to his speech imagination gave, Like a foam wreath upon a rushing wave; For a deep vein of pure poetic gold Ran through that mighty mind of granite mould. Regarding not the creed of caste or clan, His soul embraced the brotherhood of man, And party withes that tend to dwarf the mind, Could not the limbs of such a Titan bind. Who can forget his eloquent appeal, When struggling Greece leaned on her broken steel? Roused by his voice, were treasuries unlocked, While armed avengers to her standard flocked, And rose full soon to Heaven, from land and sea, The glad announcement, âGreece once more is free!â What have wretches gained who dared to shower Their missiles round him in his dying hour? Darts blunted in the cowardly attack, And infamy, beyond expression black. Could puny malice hope to overthrow Earth's greatest statesman with one feeble blow, Or fling the shadow of obscuring shame On the colossal column of his fame? As well might pigmies gather to displace The rock-ribbed mountain from its ancient base. Not limited by continents, though vast, Was a renown that empires will outlast; The proudest office in the wide world's gift, To higher state a Webster could not lift; On him would honors, play-things of a day, Stars, garters, ribbons have been thrown awayâ Titles have proven but an empty sound, Conferred on one so truly world-renowned. As sinks, full-orbed, some blazing tropic sun Until night's sable boundary is wonâ Between no waning ray, no twilight-time, Gilding the gloom as in our colder clime: So sank till reached Death's realm of dark repose, His sun-like mind unclouded to the close. Ye nations mourn! the foremost man of earth Has looked his last on home and sacred hearthâ A great light is extinguished on the shore Of crumbling time, for Webster is no more! No more?âaway with that disheartening word! His voice in other ages will be heard, Its clarion music ringing on the ear To wrong a knellâto right a sound of cheer: Still can its thunder deaden with alarm The plotting head and parricidal armâ Its utterance, unstifled by the grave, Rouse from lethargic indolence the brave, Should fierce Rebellion light polluted fires On soil made holy by the dust of sires. As Egypt gave the dead within her tomb Both preservation and a sweet perfume, Alone not immortality is given To Webster's fame, but odor as of Heaven. THE CENTENARIAN. [Written in memory of Abner Morgan, Esq., who died at Avon, aged 100 years. He graduated at Harvard in 1763, was a member of the bar of Massachusetts, resided many years at Brimfield in that state, and held the rank of Major in the Army of the Revolution.] Weep not for him! Those white, thin locks that shade A brow majestical and high, the winds Of an eventful century have stirred. The gay companions of his infant years, And jocund mates in academic halls Grew old and died, while that tall, wasted form, Now shrouded for the sepulchre, along The chequer'd pathway of existence moved. Weep not for him! The Present was a page Wherein his dim and glazing eye could trace Not one redeeming character of joy. Decay unstrung the harp of memory Long ere his pulses were forever hushed, And on his blunted ear her jarring notes Fell like funereal echoes, while the world Lost its familiar aspect. When the springs Of brilliant thought grew dry, and Darkness fixed Her habitation in the torpid brain, His native dignity of mien survived, And a faint fire would light his hollow eye When others read of battle. Like a gleam Of sunlight in a cloudy sky, sometimes The pleasant Past came back, and he would call The members of his household by the names Of buried comrades of his childhood hours, And those who snatched, like him, avenging sword From rust and slumber, when the bugle-peal Of waking Liberty aroused the land, And willing martyrs fell at Lexington. Weep not for him! The maladies of flesh That daily quench the fires of middle age, And blight the vernal promise of the young, Infused no deadly poison in his veins; But left him, like some venerable oak Spared by the storm that overthrows the wood, To perish in the kindly arms of Time. In him the houseless beggar found a friend, And the pale orphan from his open door Went with a tearless cheek and lighter heart. His frugal habits to voluptuous man Spoke with a loud and monitory voice; And, proudly resolute of soul, he shunn'd The whirlpool of ebriety that lures Too many of thy gifted sons, O, Earth! To sink, poor wrecks, in its dissolving womb. One look, the last!âNow give with solemn rites The veteran of liberty a grave! He needs no proud memorial of art To consecrate his ashes; for the soil He aided in redeeming from the rule And cruel presence of despotic power, Is more endearing record of his deeds Than pompous marble or a pyramid. EPICEDIUM. âBut, O the heavy change, now thou art gone, Now thou art gone, and never must return.â Milton. When her brow, untouched by corroding care, Like the fold of a summer cloud, was fair; When the glance of her bright dark eye outshone The dazzling blaze of the diamond stone; In treacherous guise the spoiler came, And a wintry chill ran through her frame: From branching vein and soft lip fled Celestial blue and the brightest red; Her smile, ere the vital spring was dried, To a world like ours was unallied; On her cheek the rose grew strangely white And she melted away like a shape of light. Since the cold remains of the sleeping maid In the silent hall of death were laid, The bright autumnal moon hath shed Its purest beam on her narrow bed, And winds, with sorrow in their tone, On the dampened mould dead leaves have thrown. Her spirit dwells in that radiant land Where the blighted blossoms of earth expand; Where dews from the throne of mercy fall, And things unknown are shroud and pall; Where beauty, safe from winter's rime, Enjoys an endless summer time. Her look, all love, had the magical power Of gilding the darkest, the loneliest hour; On her sylph-like form the old would gaze And remember the freshness of younger days: Henceforth there will be a vacant seat In halls where the gay and lovely meet; The brightest star of the festal throng Will gladden the breast no more with song; Her tuneful voice is no longer heardâ On her lip hath died the warbled word. When sunset gilds yon azure lake, And murmuring winds the surges wake, She will leave, she will leave on the pebbly shore The print of her fairy foot no more. From his broad lap soon will youthful spring Bright robes of green on the meadow fling, And blossoms, gemming the velvet sward, With her couch of rest will well accord; For our lost one was a peerless flower, By the foe cut down in its dawning hour. If shadows of gloom becloud the brow When sere leaves fall from the parent bough; If sorrow-pains convulse the heart When the weary and gray of hair departâ Well may the storm of grief unseal The tearful fount in a breast of steel, When frost descends from the clear, cold sky, And the buds of blessÃ©d promise die; When the ghastly king his banner rears, And calls to his realm the young in years. MARY'S DIRGE. âWeep not for her! her memory is the shrine Of pleasant thoughts.ââ Dr. Moir. A low and gentle strain! for she was gentle Whose lips have breathed farewell to life and light, Consigned to rest beneath the summer mantle That Earth is wearing on her bosom bright. But yesterday her voice was heard in singing, And kindly smiles her visage overspread, And, now, the minstrel tearfully is stringing His yew-wreathed lute in honor of the dead. When skies were fairest, and young roses giving Elysian odor to the passing airâ When even Age found luxury in living, She heard a whispered warning to prepare. In sluggish mould a grave was never hollowed For one more dear to those who knew her well, And young and old, in deep dejection, followed The white-robed sleeper to her narrow cell; All, in the long and dark procession walking, Felt, knocking at their hearts, no common grief, While many, in sad undertone, were talking Of ills endured until she brought relief: And one poor father a remembrance cherishedâ That on the pall, obscuring with its shade The coffin of his child all pale and perished! A wreath of emblematic flowers she laid. He little thought ere many moons had vanished The turf would open for that gentle friend; The rose of beauty from her cheek be banished, The blight from skies without a cloud descend. The heart that mourns, a consolation borrows In knowing that her triumph is our loss; A glorious crown the Man of many sorrows Gives to the lowly bearer of his cross. For a wise purpose are we here delaying Our upward march to realms more rich and vast, Like weary sea-birds for a moment staying Far from the land upon some rocking mast. Our pulses, here, are numbered in their beating, And Death stands ever watching at the gate; The morning pearl-drop and the shadow fleeting Are emblems of our transitory state. The forest eagle, ere he furls forever His iron wing, a century completes, And on the moss-fringed oak, in vain endeavor, While kingdoms rise and fall, the tempest beats; But Man, the boasted ruler of Creation, Floats a few days upon a troubled sea! Then sinks from view, exceeded in duration, By the wild wandering bird, and senseless tree. Why cling then to the fleeting, false and fading, Oh, Man! with lofty faculties endowed? Thy future lot a mystic veil is shading, But light eternal beams behind the cloud. Cords of affection, in this rude world broken, Will knit, at last, to part no more in twain, And ashy lips, that farewell words have spoken, In a long kiss of love unite again. Be reconciled with God! devoted mother! And hope for blest reunion with your child: And thouâher o'erfond fatherâtry to smother The woe wherewith your brain is waxing wild. Death laid cold finger on her eyes terrestrial Those of the soul enfranchised to unseal, And would ye call her back from joys celestial The pangs that vex ye here, again to feel? Your daughter dear is now a glad partaker Of aliment divine, we are assured; For, pure in heart, she looks upon her Makerâ Hushed every moan, her mortal anguish cured; Looks where no cloud around His throne is rolling, Not darkly through a glass, but face to face, Beyond this orb where bells are ever tolling The bitter knells of loveliness and grace. Though painful and unlooked-for was the closing, In this dark valley, of her mortal day! Be reconciledâa holy trust reposing In Power Supreme who gives and takes away. I know that darkness rests upon your dwelling, And cold the hearth of home so bright before, While bird and breeze, and rustling leaf seem telling A tale of her who will come back no more. In dreams of night I know that she is present, With her mild look and unobtrusive air, And that ye hear her accents, low and pleasant, Her light, familiar footstep on the stair. Turn from the house of flesh, in ruin lying, And with the steady eye of faith behold Its bright inhabitant released, undying, In Heaven's full concert waken harp of gold; Pray that, in watches of the midnight dreary, A note of that sweet music reach your ears, Healing the heart with sorrow bruised and wearyâ Drying the fount of unavailing tears! A low, sad, gentle strain, for she was gentle Whose lips have breathed farewell to life and light, Consigned to rest beneath the summer mantle That Earth is wearing on her bosom bright. A FATHER'S LAMENT. âAnd ere a man hath power to say, âBehold!â The jaws of darkness do devour it up, So quick bright things come to confusion.ââ Shakspeare. The world without is dim to view, Though fair to other eyes, For sorrow gives its own dull hue To valley, hill, and skies; Thick darkness that will not depart, Seems brooding over earth: A heavy cloud is on my heart, A shadow on my hearth. My youngestâchild of love and hope! Away the spoiler bore; Her beauteous orbs of azure ope, When morning calls, no more. The rose is blanched upon her face, Her pulse forever stilled; And now my dwelling is a place With funeral echoes filled. Oh! ever she was first to hear My homeward step at night, And laughter, silvery and clear, Betokened her delight; But now the door of home I seek With bosom chilled to stone, For Desolation, grim and bleak, Hath made my roof his own. Deep in my bleeding heart the knife Of agony found way, When warned in whispers that her life Would not outlast the day; I kissed her cheek, I breathed her name, But heard no fond reply: Her visage wan more sharp became, More dun her closing eye. On God to save I wildly calledâ Unheard the prayer of sin; She died, and utter darkness walled My groaning spirit in; A cold, benumbing torpor slept Like nightmare on my brain; A feeling, as of winter, crept Through every wandering vein. These ringlets, to remember dear, So bright that one might deem The sunlight of a purer sphere Had touched them with its beam, Bring back the beauteous head to sight On which their clusters grew, Her rounded brow of radiant white, And cheek of rosiest hue. Her bonnet gay, with ribbons graced, The doll she used to hold, And shoe that daintily encased Her foot of fairy mould, The gift of mournful speech possess When on them fall mine eyes, And tell how much of loveliness In earth all wasted lies. In dreams I hear her prattling tongue Essay my name to speak; Her little arms are round me flung, Her lips are on my cheek; But waking in my tortured breast Begets a wilder throe, For, bordering the land of rest, Black lies the realm of woe! There is a grief, like April's cloud, That melts in rain away; A little while the head is bowed, Then comes a brighter day: Not such is mineâno drops refresh My weary soul, that fain Would rend these bonds of melting flesh, And join the lost again. HYMN ON THE DEATH OF A DAUGHTER. Though eyes of Heaven's own blue are dim, Brow, lip, and cheek to coldness wed; From God she came, and back to Him, In her unsinning morn, hath fled. An angel whispered in her ear The message by her father sentâ Sweet words that she alone could hear, And spotless to his arms she went. Oh! precious child of hope and love! Our hearts to thee too fondly clung, And God, to turn our thoughts above, Each trembling chord hath wildly wrung. Then, mourning mother! let us pray, When we have done with Earth and Time, That she, whom we deplore to-day, Embrace us in a brighter clime. CATHARINE. Wail for the loved and gifted, Untimely snatched away, While golden morn gave promise Of long, unshadowed day; While mind with light was filling The chambers of her brain, And flowers of thought were growing Like leaves in vernal rain; While, magnet of admiring eyes, The bowers of home she cheered, Fond idol of parental hearts, To old and young endeared! When, one by one, are torn away Our dearest earth-born ties, In vain, in vain above us spreads The blue of summer skiesâ In vain we hear the warbling bird, Low wind and rustling leaf; For nature hath no tone to lull The deafened ear of griefâ Though earth is gay with blossoms, And sunny waters roll, A drear and wintry loneliness Holds empire in the soul. We mourn not those who vanish In the autumn time of life, Wan with the blight of sorrow, And weary of the strifeâ Ripe for the Land of Shadows, They seek their narrow beds, And sweetly in the peaceful mould Repose their pillowed heads: But hearts should bleed and break, when Death Unlocks his hall of frost, And thither bears in icy arms The loved and early lost. But yesterday the glow of youth Was on her radiant face, Pure innocence in every wordâ In every motion grace; But yesterday her lustrous eye With gentle meanings shone, And tinted were her tuneful lips Like roses newly blownâ Now dust and hiding darkness fill The mansion of her rest, And green the hillock dwells above Her cold, insensate breast. For her harp disused to song In vain a kinsman sweepsâ Its untaught note alone recalls The damp earth where she sleeps: No tone its shattered chord hath caught From that immortal clime, Where her unsullied spirit dwells Triumphant over Timeâ His drooping fancy cannot soar Above the burial-sod, And reconcile to anguished hearts The mystic ways of God. REQUIEM. âForget the dead, the past! O yet There are ghosts that may take revenge for it; Memories that make the heart a tomb.â Shelley. When the warring voice of storm is heard, Across the sea goes the summer bird; But back again the wanderer flies When April's azure drapes the skies, With carol sweet The morn to greet; But the radiant girl whom we deplore, To the bower of home will return no more. Decay, a loathsome bridegroom, now Kisses with mildewed lip her brow; Her heart is colder than the rill When Winter bids its tongue be still, Yet Spring will come, With song and bloom, And unchain the silvery feet of waves, But break no bond in voiceless graves. Wasting away with a sad decline, Far from her own green hills of pine, She would wander back to them in dreams, To hear the roar of their rushing streams; And often spoke Of a favorite oak On the door-sill flinging pleasant shade, And under which, a child, she played. When beat no more her snow-white breast, Strange hands the lovely ruin drest, Smoothing, upon the forehead fair, Loose, glittering flakes of golden hair; And strangers gave To our dead a grave, Sprinkling above the fair remains Mould moistened by autumnal rains. Ah! since she died, a wilder wail Is uttered by the midnight gale, And voices mourning something gone, Rise from the dead leaves on the lawn; And sadness broods Above the woods, Moaning, as if endowed with soul, For through their depths she loved to stroll. The lute that answered when she sung Old airs at twilight, is unstrungâ She wakes where the sainted dwell alone An instrument of richer tone; And angels smile On her the while, And to garland her sinless brow of snow The rarest blossoms of Heaven bestow. TRIBUTE TO THE DEAD. âAbsint inani funere nÃ¦mÃ¦, Luctusque turpis, et querimoniÃ¦.â Horace. Rest from the strife, brave spirit! uncomplaining, With evil fortune thou hast battled long; While heavy drops from sorrow's cloud are raining, A lyre, long silent, vibrates into song: I would not, if I could, thy form awaken, To wrestle with sharp throes another hour, Though one like thee could, with a mien unshaken, Rob death's dissolving pang of half its power. With the plague-spot upon thy visage hollow, Floridian shores were trod by thee in vain; When northward Spring sent forth her herald swallow, Panted thy heart to visit home again: Once more to native scenes and pleasant places Back camest thou o'er Ocean's flashing foam; Once more thy glance on old familiar faces Rested, while sitting by the hearth of home. Once more thy loving and devoted mother Thy couch beside outwatched the stars of night; Once more thy sire a groan would try to smother, For skill was vain to stay the work of blight: Brief was thy stay:âAutumnal winds are flinging Pale, withered leaves upon thy funeral mould While overhead are feathered armies winging Their way to lands unvexed by frost or cold. And friendly hearts belief are entertaining That thy soul journeyed to a brighter climeâ Fount of unclouded light that knows no waning, Far, far beyond this crumbling strand of time: How otherwise believe?âfor aspirations, That in true hearts have birth alone, were thine; A will to dare those troubles and vexations That drug with gall, too oft, life's sparkling wine. Rest from the strife, brave spirit! who would wake thee, To waste and burn with fever-fires again; While friends are tortured at the sight, to make thee Feel for another hour Promethean pain? Not all of thee is lost while comrades cherish Fond recollections of thy worth, my friend; Though gone, the bright example cannot perish Of courage that upheld thee to the end. DANSVILLE CEMETERY. The murmur of waters I hear, A pleasant but slumberous sound, And the hum of the crowd faintly falls on mine ear, While I linger by head-stone and mound: Their boughs oak and pine interweave, And shade on the hallowed place throw, While winds in their emerald tops seem to grieve For the sleepers that moulder below; And never belonged to Arcadian scene Hill-slope and valley of lovelier green. It is meet that a home for the dead The living should thus set apartâ A pillow provide for the reverend head, And rest for the sorrow-touched heart. Let beauty that early feels blight, And manhood untimely o'erthrown, In earth's brightest places be buried from sight Till the trumpet of judgment is blown; Where fields stretch away like a picture unrolled, Above their remains should be rounded the mould. Frail blossoms of childhood, that caught A blush from the day-break, then died, Have hither by parents been tenderly brought, And lovingly rest, side by side; Ah! poor, little lambs of the flock That rudely were torn from the fold, Away with the pomp of the chisel-carved rock To mark where ye turn into mould! Where plaid by the spring-time is soonest displayed, And first seen the blue-bird, your graves should be made. When swathed in the cold winding-sheet Is the friend that from youth we have known, And his generous heart hath forgotten to beat In friendly response to our own, It is pleasant to think that he lies In earth that is hallowed like this, While round him old hills, crowned with evergreen, rise, And zephyrs the violets kiss; While leaf-harp, and wavelet that melts on the shore, For the loved and the lost wake a dirge evermore. Here mourners can wander in thought, Unawed by the presence of death, To the beautiful field father Abraham bought, With its cave, from the children of Heth; And Grief, draped in sable, may find In these leaf-shaded alleys a balm, For this pastoral landscape disposes the mind To a holy and heavenly calm; And, wreathing the pale reaper's sickle with flowers, Glad souls seem to flit through these whispering bowers DIRGE. [AirââTrue love can ne'er forget.â] âLowly the Lord of Song, Reckless of woe and wrong, In the grave's chamber strong Moulders alone!â Thus sang an airy sprite Flowers dropping, pale with blight, While round his tomb, by night, Autumn made moan. No head-stone marks his place of sleep, No mourner wanders there to weepâ But sings a voice at midnight deep, These words with touching tone:â âLowly the Lord of Song, Reckless of woe and wrong, In the grave's chamber strong Moulders alone!â Thorns made his journey rough, He had lived long enoughâ Black sorrow's leaden stuff Weighed down his soul; Fame had a phantom proved, Hollow the hearts he loved; Well might he reach unmoved Life's dreary goal. On the blossom of his youth Fed the worm's envenomed tooth, And in vain the light of truth Was on his pathway thrownâ âLowly the Lord of Song, Reckless of woe and wrong, In the grave's chamber strong Moulders alone!â What to one were home and hearth, Beauty's smile, or childhood's mirth, Founts and flowers that gladden earth, Who prayed for death and nightâ One, with heart of kingly mould, More wretched than the beggar old Who couches on the pavement cold Until the morning light? Though Hate and Slander babble still, They cannot work him further ill; For no more his voice can thrill The nations with its tone. âLowly the Lord of Song, Reckless of woe und wrong, In the grave's chamber strong Moulders alone!â CHURCH-YARD FLOWERS. Flowers of the church-yard! Ye are as bright of hue As sisters that in greener spots Quaff drops of morning dew: A charm to the house of death ye gave, Springing in beauty on childhood's graveâ Waving your heads in the wind, to and fro, Types of the innocent sleeper below. Flowers of the church-yard! A part of her ye seem, Who in that heavy slumber lies That knows no pleasant dream: I saw her blue eyes in your violet gems, The grace of her form in your flexible stems, In diamonds of morn on your petals that lay Her tears, that the sunshine of joy chased away. Flowers of the church-yard! Your leaves are odorous still; Ye died before the biting frost Of winter-time could kill; Though vanished our lost one from earth's fading bowers, Remembrance of her is like fragrance of flowers; She dawned on our vision a creature of light, And passed ere the day was o'erclouded by night. Flowers of the church-yard! Her narrow house was cold; Ye sprang, and warmed with summer tints The damp and gloomy mould; Thus came, when the path of existence was drear, Our darling, the hearth of our homestead to cheer, But ah! when our blossom was fairest to sight, Gnawed the worm of decay, and descended the blight. Flowers of the church-yard! Another spring will wake A painted band as deep in dye Her grave-couch bright to make; But ah! never more will our threshold be cross'd By mortal, the peer of our loved and our lost; Darkened earth was too poor such a treasure to ownâ Heaven's casket is meet for such jewels alone. MONODY. She lies the green turf under, Regardless of our tears, From sun and air excluded In the May time of her years: Wild violets are springing To decorate the spot, And birds are blithely singing, But, ah! she hears them not. When frosts, untimely falling, Kill fragile flower and leaf, Within the heart a feeling Awakes akin to grief; And often in the summer We mark, with look forlorn, Thick clouds that darken suddenly The lustre of the morn. Think not of blossom withered, Or over-clouded dawn, When those of rare endowments Forever are withdrawn; Beneath the turf we lay them In anguish hard to bear, And resignation comes not To brighten our despair. I know that friends may whisper, Though bitterly bereaved: In sorrow's funeral web-work Are threads of gold inweaved: They died ere chilled the fountain Of bliss within the soul, Or sin's deforming characters Made dark life's chequered scroll. We ill can spare thus early A loveliness so bright: To helpless age more fitting Is death and starless night: We fain would clasp such treasures The bower of home to cheer, And lend a gleam of sunshine To earth so dark and drear. Though many were her rivals In learning's crowded hall, She won the prize of honor, Esteemed and loved by all; The modesty of merit Was written on her face, And by her mates unenvied She held the highest place. Not all of her hath perished! Her young and ardent mind Hath left a written record Of burning thoughts behind; And memories of her outlive Death's desolating power, Like fragrance clinging to the leaf When blighted stalk and flower. DIRGE FOR THE MIGHTY. Fallen is our chief and sage, Lonely is the Hermitage! Muffled drum and tolling bell, And sad dirge-notes on the gale, Through the land he loved so well Tell the tale. Warning he will give no moreâ His long strife with pain is o'er; Honors paid the worthy dead, And the sable weeds of woe Whisper that his laurelled head Lieth low. Calmly he hath laid him down In the fullness of renown, And the soil he proudly trod Would in blood be darkly steeped Ere the foe polluted sod O'er him heaped. Might to him belongeth still, Though no more his pulse will thrill; For his nameâa watch-word stern! Would affright invading host, Should the fires of battle burn On our coast. Millions sorrow for the fall Of a warder on the wall; One who well his station high Through the night of peril kept, And whose keen, far-seeing eye Never slept. Heavenly radiance bathed his soul As he neared the welcome goal, And the closing of his day To a sun resemblance boreâ Brightening, as it passed away, More and more. Let his glorious battle-sword, Dreaded by oppression's horde, Grace the nation's banner'd hallâ Where, if treason should be breathed, It would clatter on the wall, Half-unsheathed. His memorials are his deedsâ No sarcophagus he needs, Nor stone column reared by art, To perpetuate his fame; For an empire's mighty heart Bears his name. REST! [âA few rods from the barrier-gate of Fort Niagara was the burying-ground. It was filled with memorials of the mutability and brevity of human life, and over the portals of entrance was painted, in large and emphatic characters, the word âRest.ââ]â Judge De Veaux. Earth, upon her ample face, Boasts no sweeter burial-place Than a small enclosure green, Near an ancient fortress seen; Mossy head-stones here and there Names of fallen warriors bear, But no eulogistic phrase, Cut on rock, that meets the gaze, Can our reverence command, Like that brief inscription grand, On the portal arch impressedâ âRest!â River wide, and mighty lake For the dead an anthem wake, And with old, forgotten graves Well comports the wash of waves, Motto of the hallowed ground Murmuring with solemn sound; Birds that by like spirits pass, Winds that murmur in the grass, Seem repeating evermore That one word the gateway o'er, Word that haunts a troubled breastâ âRest!â Pilgrim, for a moment wait Near the narrow entrance gate, And one word peruseâno moreâ Boldly traced the portals o'er; Mortal heart was never stirred By a more emphatic word; One with deeper meaning fraught, Or the power to quicken thought; Sermon, hymn, and funeral lay, Eloquence the soul to sway, In four letters are compressedâ âRest!â IMPROMPTU. WRITTEN AFTER A STROLL AMONG TOMBS. I wandered round the grave-yard When dews were falling fast, And clouds, with darkness banner'd, The wan moon overcast; Below me far the city Sent up its roofs and spires, No longer giving back the gleam Of sunset's reddening fires. Memorials of love and death On every side were seen, And snow-white palings graced the yard That kept each hillock greenâ But in the fast-departing light I vainly strove to find The dust-couch of the pure in heartâ The beautiful of mind! It mattered not!âfor near me there In spirit walked the dead, And calmness, never felt before, My heart's wild sea o'erspreadâ I heard her voice of lute-like thrill With evening's wind go byâ Once moreâonce more upon me shone Her sweet love-lighted eye! Oh! land of shade and silence, Though chill thy valleys be, Sometimes a voice from out thy depths Comes back to comfort meâ A sign that beauty's faded rose Will bud and bloom againâ And golden links in Heaven unite That break on earth in twain. A SISTER'S LAMENT. ââOmnium Versare urna, serius ocius Sora excitura, et nos in Ã¦ternum Exilium imposition cymbÃ¦.â Horace. Where is that loved one of heroic bearing, Proud in his joy, majestic in his griefâ His brow the seal of lofty purpose wearing, My beau ideal of a Highland Chief? Farewell, I heard him falter out when dying, And vainly tried his sluggish pulse to warmâ The mould is fresh upon the sleeper lying, And new the shroud that wraps his frozen form. And other ties have mournfully been sunderedâ The wide, wide earth seems draped in funeral black; Home's casket of its jewels has been plundered, And the pale robber will not give them back. Around the board are many vacant places, Our household-hearth has lost its circle gay: Vanished for ever are those pleasant faces That cheerful made the dullest wintry day. Blow follows blow, the hollow world divesting Of charms that once I thought would ne'er depart; A heavy weight upon my soul is resting, The gloom of midnight on my breaking heart. Why, pleading friendship! vainly try to smother The vulture grief, that on my bosom preys? Far, far away, my youngest, dearest brother Has fallen in the morning of his days. Home of my childhood! once so full of gladness, Few enter now thy hospitable door; And from thy lonely halls usurping sadness Has banished bright-eyed mirth for evermore. Oh! that the morn could send one beam of cheering To chambers that seem haunted by the deadâ That I could see the darkness disappearing, And hear again his light, familiar tread. A REMEMBRANCE. Within a sad, deserted house I passed an hour of gloom; Behind the wainscot crawled the mouseâ The bat was in the room: What heard I in that dreary house? The sweet, low spirit-voice of one Called early to the tomb. That voice was thine, my daughter dear! It came my heart to thrill, And, like an ocean-shell, mine ear Retains the music still; She said: âBe joyous, father dear! Unclouded morn will break at last Upon a night of ill.â And I will rend the bonds that hold In thrall my higher powers, As broke the mighty man of old Green withes, like chains of flowers; Though hearts that should have loved are cold, And eyes flash scorn that should have beamed Like sunshine after showers. THE EARLY TAKEN. I stood with the childlessâ A desolate pairâ When, drest for the grave, Lay the sinless and fair, Who died like a lily that droops on its stem, And torn were my heart-strings with sorrow for them. Outshone by the curls That the slumberer wore Was the mid-summer light Streaming in at the door, And clung to her lip a more delicate red Than tinted the rose-wreath encircling her head. More drear than a desert Where never is heard The singing of waters, Or carol of bird, Are homes in this dark world of sorrow and sin, Uncheered by the music of childhood within. And round one frail blossom Your hopes were entwinedâ One daughter of beauty Affection made blind; Before her ye saw a bright future outspread, But dreamed not of dirge-note, nor shroud for the dead. Oh! blest is the spirit, Unstained by the clod, That mounts in the morn Like a sky-lark to God:â A glittering host the new comer surround, And welcome the harp-strings of Paradise sound. Ye stricken! oh, think, While your wailing is wild, That above this dim orb âIt is well with the child!â And pray for reunion with her ye have lost, Where love knows no heart-ache, the blossom no frost. THE MOURNER'S APPEAL. Hide her not from mortal eye, Sunshine lingers in her hairâ Who would wish the clod to lie On a form so passing fair! Life is glowing in the rose On the oval of her cheekâ Those sweet eyes will yet unclose, And those lips of coral speak. Can it be that Death would leave Such a matchless grace behind? Could the tyrant thus deceive, And a father's eye make blind! Wake, my daughter! from thy sleep, Or wild woe will craze my brain; Wake, as was thy wont, and leap Into these fond arms again. No response to my appealâ No awaking to my call; Ah! that heart has ceased to feelâ Lay her in Death's sunless hall! Let the beauteous shell decay That a priceless germ encased, Meet for Heaven's eternal day, Not for earth's dark, dreary waste. BLIGHTED BLOSSOMS. Oh! mourn not for those Who in childhood depart, Ere sin darkly throws A dread blight on the heart; Though the worm and the frost Rob their beauty of bloom, Oh! deem them not lost When they lie in the tomb. Three bright, blissful years, With a soul undefiled, Through this desert of fears Walked our innocent child; Then her spirit, too white For earth's sullying clod, Passed, through portals of night, To the sunshine of God. Doubly sad is the home Of such bright ones bereft, And wherever we roam, Nothing lovely seems left.â But who would call back Those who vanish at morn, To groan on the rack, And be pierced by the thorn? Little children were dear To our Saviour on earthâ Never deaf was his ear To their innocent mirth; And when they repose On his sheltering breast, They are saved from the woes That this dark world molest. A DIRGE, TO L. E. L. Far away, ah! far away From her own green isle she died, And for shroud that wraps decay Early changed the garb of bride. Fatal to our northern flower Was the glare of tropic day; Wretched was her dying hour, Far away! Never more, ah! never more Will she glad the festal throng, Faded is the look she wore, Voiceless is her lip of song. Gifted daughter of the Nine! Well may friends thy fate deplore, They will hear a strain like thine Never more! Fare thee well, ah! fare thee well! Dark thy life grew near its close; Mildew on thy spirit fell Like wan blight upon the rose. Ended is thy warbling now, Mistress of the chorded shell; Dust is on thy withered brow, Fare thee well! SONNETS. PRE-EXISTENCE. [Cicero, in his treatise on âOld Age,â remarks in support of Plato's doctrine:ââMagno esse argumento homines scire pleraque antequam nati sint: quod jam pueri, quum artes difficiles discant, ita celeriter res innumerabiles arripiunt, ut eas non tum primum accipere videantur, sed reminisci et recordari.â] Why, like a flash of light, upon the mind, When lost in thought upon a foreign shore, Cometh the strange impression that we find The features of a landscape known before? Oh! why, at times, when high discourse we hold, Rusheth a wild remembrance on the brain, That, wrapped in shadow, we rehearse again? Words breathed, we know not where, in times of old, Are present like a mirror that reflects Scenes of a pre-existence, passing strangeâ A dark and narrow isthmus that connects The far-off Heretofore with Future changeâ Wisdom, by years of pain and toil amassed, Naught but a resurrection of the Past! On the sensation that still uneffaced Are characters of ante-natal lore, His phantasy majestic Plato based,â That knowledge is remembranceânothing more: And Tully, too, the silver-tongued and wise! Fancied the Present but a passing show, An apparition dim of long ago, Waking a train of glorious memories; And the gray laurelled bard of Rydal deems That earth was not our starting-place, and Thought Is conscious of a learning, elsewhere taught, Compared with which attainments here are dreams; The dazzling revelation of to-day Light from an old Elysium far away. TO HELENA. ON SEEING A DAGUERREOTYPE BY GABRIEL HARRISON, REPRESENTING âHELENAâ AS THE GODDESS OF THE ART. Well may the sun be sire of one like thee, Impersonation of celestial grace! Less of divine and bright was in the face Of new-born Venus rising from the sea. Daughter of Light! upon thy breast appears A star less radiant than thy lifted gaze That seems to pierce the distance veiled in haze, And read the riddle of the coming years. The musing bard, in inspiration's hour, A glimpse of nobler features never caughtâ Blending the charm of deep, prophetic thought With beauty's wild and overmastering power. Fair pictures crowd the galleries of old, But boast no shape of such a lustrous mould. TO A BOUQUET OF FLOWERS. Ye, Flowers, together bound of various dyes, Were beauty's own:âdid not the sun-lit bow Of promise quit its station in the skies, And break to pieces in the meadows low Where grew ye, daughters of the mornâto each A different shade imparting, from the blue Of summer Ocean to the faint red hue That paints the shell upon his whitened beach? Oh! would that fairy ministers with dew Could fill once more your withered cup, or rain Bathe with refreshing drops your life again; But the hoar frost is lying where ye grew, And howls the stormâand with your lifeless stems Will zephyrs sport no more, ye vegetable gems! AN ARROW-HEAD. Crossing yon field an arrow-head I found Shaped from the flinty rock with wondrous art; No other trace upon the furrowed ground, Though patiently I broke the clods apart, Was visible of ancient Indian ruleâ When the grim forest, to its dusky heart, Thrilled with the whoop of war and hunter's shout, Frighting the wild-duck from her rushy pool, And from green lair the trooping antler'd herd, Faint impress leaving, like the passing bird: Thus are the tracks of nations blotted out, Save when the world, erst trod by them, is stirred By other racesâgiving to the light Some yellow crumbling bone, or implement of fight. ON A CASCADE NEAR WYOMING. A brook, the woody mountain's bounding child, With a deep murmur in its silvery flow, Falls, in its journey over rocks up-piled, On the green carpet of the glen below. Above the cascade aged hemlocks throw Their mossy branches, flecked with drops of spray, Like warders old that watch around bestow, Stationed on rocky battlements of gray. In haunts like these, when baffled in the fight That drenched a groaning land with crimson showers, The sturdy champions of the true and right Have gathered to repair their wasted powers: And rousing hymns of God and Freedom heard, Sung by the tumbling wave and tameless bird. JOHN AUGUSTUS SHEA. Another voice is hushedâanother lyre Hangs on a dead and leafless bough, unstrung; Of wrongs that curse humanity he sung; But changed to ashes is his heart of fire. Far from the luckless Isle that gave him birth, Wrapped in the raiment of the grave he lies: Though Freedom there no more finds home and hearth, Dying he thought of her green fields and skiesâ Before his fading sight, in dim array, Shades of the martyred and the mighty passed, And light unearthly round the minstrel cast, A harbinger of everlasting day; They came to guide his spirit to a land That knows nor broken heart nor fettered hand. TO F. G. H. Wake, sleeping bard! too long bedimming rust Has rested on the chords of thy rich shellâ Wake, sleeping bard, and people mount and dell With deathless beings of the mind!âfrom dust The gifted men of olden time call up, And speak to them when Night is on her throne, Learning the secrets of a world unknown: Oh! raise once more the bright, enchanted cup Of romance to thy thirsting lip and drink, And in the chain of inspiration be A dazzling, proud, imperishable link: Let thy rapt muse, emerging from thick gloom, Fairer than Venus rising from the sea, For epic flight her wing majestically plume. TO A LONG-SILENT SISTER OF SONG. Where art thou, wood-dove of Hesperian climes, The sweetest minstrel of our unshorn bowers? In dreams, methinks, I faintly hear at times An echo of thy silver-sounding rhymes; Alas! that blight should fall on fairest flowers, Eternal silence on angelic lips; That tender, starry eyes should know eclipse, And mourning love breathe farewell to the hours! Speak! has the grave closed on thee evermore, Daughter of Music?âhath thy golden lute, With dust upon its broken strings, grown mute; Thy fancy, rainbow-hued, forgot to soar? To hush thy warbling is a grievous wrongâ Come back! come back to sunlight and to song! THE SHADOW OF A GRIEF. The substance, not the shadow of a grief, Embitters my existence:âthough, perchance, From the green bowers of ever-bright romance My feeble hand has plucked one laurel leaf. Few are the souls on earth that sympathize With toilers who outwatch the stars of night In searching for the beautiful, while blight Dims many a hopeâstill unattained the prize. Oh! ever welcome is the prayer of one, Like thee, endowed with âfaculty divine,â And if a charm to ward off ill were mine, Thy day of joy would know no setting sun; By sorrow never would thy head be bowedâ Darkened the sky above thee by no cloud. WILLIAM P. HAWES. Well may we cherish a sad thought of thee, Oh, Hawes! called hence ere finished was thy task; Where can we find a soul so full of gleeâ Wit with so fine and keen an edge, I ask? The subtle essence of true genius lurks Both in thy tuneful prose and careless lays; Pervaded by rich humor are thy works, Like that which on the page of Elia plays Too soon wert thou arrested in thy course, Cut down at noon on life's great battle-field. Well may we mourn when such a fount is sealed, By death untimely frozen at its source! Those who with thee the wreath of friendship twined, Should not forget the loved ones left behind. TO A CHIMNEY-SWEEPER. Poor son of Afric! in the deepest cell Of thy swart bosom mirth has taken rootâ Thy calling is a lofty one, and soot Accords with thy complexion passing well. Thou art an actor, and thy âching-e-ring,â While standing on the top of chimney dark, All grinningly, like Jim Crow at the Park, In gravity unlocks the comic spring. By way of flues to win a station high Bespeaketh true originality. Thou canst not twice thy coat the same way don, For collar, sleeve, and back are partly gone, And Time, who is not partial to the graces, Hath run his dagger through in many places. NIGHT. Oh, night! I love thee, as a weary child Loves the maternal breast on which it leans! Day hath its golden pompâits bustling scenes; But richer gifts are thine:âthe turmoil wild Of a proud heart thy low, sad voice hath stilled, Until its throb is gentler than the swell Of a light billowâand its chamber filled With cloudless light, with calm unspeakable: Thy hand a curtain lifteth, and I see One who first taught my heart with love to thrill, Though long ago her lip of song grew still:â A strange, mysterious power belongs to thee, To morning, noon, and twilight-time unknown; For the dead gather round thy starry throne. EMMA GILLINGHAM BOSTWICK. Sing on! unrivalled warbler! never more Will mortal ear be blessed by such a strainâ Its sweet, enamored echo will remain Until the fever of this life is o'er. Such notes were heard in Eden, ere its bowers Were sullied by the clinging taint of sinâ When all was pure the human heart within, And sunshine lay upon unfading flowers. I would not for a blest hereafter prayâ A Heaven for which the troubled spirit longsâ If, in its halls, I could not hear alway Enchanting, thrilling music like thy songs. Sing on! thou bird of melody! and fill My heart with rapture till its pulse is still. OH, SHE WAS YOUNG! Oh! she was young, and beautiful and good, But called away, while age toils faintly onâ Gone to the voiceless land of shadowsâgone In the bright morning of her womanhood. Cheered by the blue-bird's warble of delight, Spring-time, the tender twilight of the year, With bursting bud and sprouting grass is here, And nature breathes of resurrection bright: It seems unmeet that one so fair should die, When sounds are heard so charming to the ear, And sights beheld so pleasant to the eye: Hush, vain regrets! a land of fadeless bloom Is now her homeâits passage-way, the tomb. WITHDRAW NOT YET THAT LOOK. Withdraw not yet that look of wildering sweetness, Or gloom will follow, as dull night the dayâ Time hath a golden wing of wondrous fleetness, When thou art near to banish grief away. The pressure of thy snowy hand in mine Sends an electric shiver through my frameâ Full freely would I barter wealth and fame, Could I but gain thy love, and intertwine Our fates together:âdim are gems compared With light that flashes in thy soul-lit eye; A prism would a palace seem if shared With thee, thou star of my idolatry! Whose radiant glances sway the troubled soul As moonlight spells old Ocean's pulse control. MISCELLANEOUS POEMS. ODE. EPODE I. a. Eternal Reason! Effluence from God! All hail to thy regenerating power! On crimson fields where guilty men have trod Thou pourest down, to purify, thy shower. Old systems, rotten with pollution long, Before thy rising star are waning fast; In palace-chambers, at the feet of Wrong The gage of bloodless battle hath been cast. Moans in this dreary wilderness of woe By thee are changed to music soft and low, For thou art parent of ennobling deeds, Binding up broken reeds; Dull Ignorance hath heard thy loud appeal; His soul begins to feel Faint throb of immortality at lastâ A vibratory motion that precedes The rending might of Truth's electric shock, That soon will crush his gyves, as powder blasts the rock. EPODE II. a. Bright essence of all purity, whose mansion Is in the hall of every human heart; Agent that giveth thought sublime expansion, A day-beam from the great White Throne thou art. Echoes that shake our mortal prison-bars, Gentle forewhisperings of future life, Of perfect bliss beyond the holy stars, When ended turmoil and this fever-strifeâ Are emanations from that well of wells Where dread Omniscience utters oracles; As gush sweet waters from a mountain spring, And cool the valleys, summer-parched, below, Companioned by the zephyr wandering; So all that scarred earth boasts of good and fair, Her green spots in the desert of despair, To thee, to thee we owe! STROPHE a. I. When man's immortal nature yearns From low desires of dust to flee, Proudly before him moves and burns A glowing column reared by thee: Thou art his monitor withinâ A wakeful warder on his spirit's wall, When the persuasive tongue of sin Chants in his ear some dulcet madrigal. Thrilled by thy voice his harp the poet strings, Clouds from his golden pathway driven, While sailing upward on ethereal wings He lives awhile in heaven: Prompted by thee his blade the patriot draws, And throws the sheath awayâ Philosophy tracks consequence to cause, And fills the caves of ancient night with day. STROPHE b. II. Calm element of light in human kind! As Dian sways the pulses of the sea, Tuning its tide to strains of harmony, Soon will thy beams control the deep of mind. Prophetic murmurs on the wind are borne, Signs are abroad, and banners are unfurled: Be comforted, ye wretched ones that mourn, Another morn is dawning on the world! Mysterious hands are lifting up the veil, And clank of breaking chains is heard afarâ Robbed of his crested helm and polished mail! In myrtle bower reclines the slumbering god of war. ANTISTROPHE. a. A fructifying radiance gilds the gloom, And precious seeds of peace are springing up; For Evil, Right is scooping out a tomb, And Joy is dropping balm in Sorrow's cup; The windows of the Future, partly raised, Reveal the foreground of a view unmarred By one deforming object, and high bard On a recovered paradise hath gazed: Love will yet melt the hardened ice That chills the breast of Avarice; Wolves on the trail of Want will cease to prowl, And Hate will lose his black, appalling scowl; Earth, full of years and graves, will wear once more A lustrous, primal beauty on her brow; From her green face, with flowers enamelled o'er, One stainless altar rise, and round it bow A rosy brotherhood of glorious forms; The sun, from his blue watch-tower in the sky, Will look on land and sea with golden eye, Rejoicing in the flight of clouds and driving storms. SOLOMON'S JUDGMENT. SUGGESTED BY A PICTURE. The painter's art has well portrayed the sceneâ The mighty monarch of majestic mien, The pleading mother, and that hardened one Who falsely criedââThe living is my son!ââ A warlike figure of gigantic height Towers in the foreground, terrible to sight; His right hand lifting high the fatal blade, While in his left he grasps the child dismayed; Ready, with muscle braced and swelling vein, The little trembler to divide in twain. Markâon the features of the woman vile, Who saidââDivide itââblended guilt and guile; Although, demanding tributary tear, The corse of infant innocence is near; A blighted flower that on her bosom lay, A thing of life and gladness yesterdayâ The playmate that its little hand had fed: A favorite dog, true only to the dead. So much of wildering beauty charms the gazeâ So much of life upon the canvas plays, That colors match the power of spoken word: Hark! are not tones of earnest pleading heard A voice that cries aloud in accent wildâ âIn no wise slayâgive her the living child!â Those touching words, and that beseeching tone Could flow from fond, paternal lips alone; And the king saidââThe sword shall not destroyâ She is the motherâgive her back the boy!â HEAD QUARTERS OF WASHINGTON, WHEN NEW YORK WAS EVACUATED BY CLINTON. It is a structure of the olden time, Built to endure, not dazzle for a day: A stain is on the venerable roof Telling of conflict with the King of Storms, And clings to casement worn and hanging eaves With thread-like roots the moss. Gray shutters swing On rusted hinges, but the beams of day Dart with a softening radiance through the bars. Colossal domes of chiselled marble made, Religion's fanes, with glittering golden spires, And Mammon's airy and embellished halls, Wearing a modern freshness, are in sight; But a cold glance they win from me alone. Why do I turn from Art's triumphant works To look on pile more humble? Why in thought Linger around this ancient edifice? The place is hallowedâWashington once trod, Planning the fall of tyranny, these floors. Within yon chamber did he bend the knee, Calling on God to aid the patriot's cause, At morn and in the solemn hour of night. His mandate, pregnant with a nation's fate, Went forth from these plain, unpretending walls. Here towered in warlike garb, his stately form, While marshalled thousands in the dusty street Gave ear to his harangue, and inly vowed To die or conquer with their matchless Chief. Methinks at yon old window I behold His calm majestic featuresâwhile the sound Of blessing rises from the throng below. Have not the scenes of other days returned? Do I not hear the sentry's measured tramp, Clangor of mail and neigh of battle-steed, Mingling their discord with the drum's deep roll? No! 'twas a dream!âthe magic of a place, Allied to memory of earth's noblest son, Gives form and seeming life to viewless air. Relic of our Heroic Age, farewell! Long may these walls defy dissolving time, Mock the blind fury of the hollow blast, And woo the pilgrim hither, while a voice Comes from the shadowy caverns of the past, Full of instruction to a freeman's soulâ A mighty voice that speaks of Washington, And prompts renewal of stern vow to guard Pure fires that on my country's altar glow. JUDGMENT. Suggested by a painting. Ezekiel, in the valley, when the bones Of a great army moved, with life endowed, While reconstructed skeletons arose, Wearing the raiment of the flesh again, Felt not a deeper awe than chills my heart While looking on this picture. Ye, who heed No warning in the spoken word, draw near, And tremble in the presence of your Judge, Who sits enthroned upon the Holy Hill! Dim is the lustre of midsummer noon Compared with radiance streaming from his crown. His calm, unalterable gaze is fixed Upon a sea of tossing heads below, And trumps are blown, and angels on the wing: Green graves are opening, and their tenants throng, Aroused from heavy slumber, to their doom. Pale ashes of men martyred for the truth, Scattered by wildly-wafting winds abroad In other ages, gather and take form; And dusty particles, dissevered long, Meetingâto change and be disjoined no more,â Attract to its old home the wandering soul. From sandy wastes, dark woods and polar fieldsâ The gorges of gray mountains, and deep caves That open their grim portals in the sea, To Judgment march the tribes of humankind, From Adam to the last-born of his line. A summons, piercing Earth's old heart, is heard; Wearing the signet faith can give alone, In pity turn the faces of the just On Sin and black Despair, whose looks denote Unutterable agony and woe. Regardless of the gold beneath his feet, The miser lifts a supplicating glance; Tearing a blood-stained garland from his brow, With frantic gesture lost Ambition prays; The ties of nature, rudely broken, wake Wailing more loud than ocean's wildest roarâ The separating Angel, in mid air, To right and left extends his beck'ning arms. The guilty mother to her spotless babe, Decked for the bowers of bliss in robe of light, Clings with fierce grasp in vainâand from the side Of his tyrannic master bounds the slave, To bear his palm-branch to the gates of heaven. The poor man, who, with God and virtue, walked Upon a thorny pathway to his grave, Is greeted with glad welcome by the saints: No more will Pompâa trembling beggar nowâ Treat him with cold disdain, or hear unmoved His tale of wrong. The children of his love, Starved! when a fellow-worm, in tinsel clad, Trampled on law, both human and divine, To rob him of his right to toil for bread: But, lo! the scattered household round their sire Flock after parting long, and seem to say:â âRejoice, dear father! we will feel the pangs Of hunger, thirst, and pinching cold no more.â HUCKNALL TORKARD. [âEvery sight and sound seemed calculated to summon touching recollections of poor Byron. The chime was from the village spires of Hucknall Torkard, beneath which his remains lie buried.â]â Irving. Oh! what a power in sights and sounds about Earth's hallowed groundâeloquent battle-fields, Wrecks of monastic pomp, or crumbling hallsâ Sad, haunted places, where heroic veins Have poured their crimson out in honor's cause, Or lonely grave that holds some mighty heart In voiceless custody. Such thoughts were thine, Immortal pilgrim from our western world! When Hucknall Torkard, on the breeze of morn, Sent from its gray and venerable spire A deep-toned mellow chime:âanother voice Found echo in the chambers of his heart While listening, with charmed ear, to that old bellâ A still mysterious voice that told of bard, At rest beneath the pavement of the church, Who needed not heraldic blazonry To make his name undying. On the spot Through dim, stained glass of gothic window poured Attempered, softened lightâoh! contrast strange To wild and dazzling radiance that around The noble bard of Britain fell in life; Warming the buried grandeur of the past, Till dim, dismembered empires from their sleep, Re-clothed with majesty, arose once more, And icy gyves, by the pale tyrant forged, Dropped from the bony arms of buried power, Dissolved like sunlit dew. A landscape fair Before the vision of the pilgrim spread, In all its features whispering of peace. The vale of Newstead, with its silver waves, Tall patriarch oaks in which the rook found home, Lawns populous with hardy English flowers, Memorials of knighthood and the monk, And hamlets sending up blue, smoky wreaths, Were objects unto which poetic heart Might cling through changing years, and never feel The burden of satiety:âand yet The wayward lord of such an Eden bright Went forth in youth to battle with the world, Its passions and its perilsâfeel the shaft From bow of ambushed slander darkly sentâ Hear the loud cry of envy's craven brood, Eclipsed in brightness by his young renown, Or read the lying verse of scribbling hate, Until his heart, by nature kind, became A fount, like Mara, bitter:âthen he roved Far from his household gods and princely towersâ His genius waking wonder in all lands, While an abiding sorrow made the locks That clustered round his glorious forehead gray, And woke, alas! although his years were few, A yearning for the shroud. Oh! that his life Beneath the shades of Newstead might have passedâ No chord of his unequalled harp deranged, Wedded to one in boyhood's hour adored With love that knew no limit to its strengthâ His MaryâAnnesley's bright Morning Star. HEATHER BLOSSOMS. [Written on receiving at the hands of Miss McL?n a few sprigs of heather plucked at the foot of Old Ben Nevis, in the valley of Glencoe.] And was your birth-place at the base Of Old Ben Nevis, beauteous flowers? On your bright leaves I still can trace The loveliness of by-gone hours. Thanks to the lass who gave the bard These sweet memorials of a land Where flourish, though the soil is hard, A race of open heart and hand; Where Bruce has fought, and Ossian sung, And lyres in every glen are strungâ Where streams that down the mountains pour Have tongues that tell of other times, While splintered rock and ocean-shore Shame the tame scenes of softer climesâ Where stormy cairns yet tower to show Where heroes perished long ago, And battle-fields, in song renowned, Make moor and mountain hallowed ground. And were ye brought across the sea, Ye heather blossoms, to awake Such kindling memories in me, And rouse wild longings to forsake These western groves, and tread the land Of plaid and pibroch, harp and brand? Ah! while I look upon these leaves, A darker web witch Fancy weaves; For blood your sister-blossoms nursed When clansmen tried in vain to rally, And Vengeance like a night-cloud burst, While Murder bared his steel accursed In green Glencoe's romantic valley. Full many moons have waxed and waned Since war your birth-place redly stained, But blood still crying from the ground Seems clinging both to flower and stalk; And though your leaves give out no sound Of crime and woe, they more than talk. Though dimmed the brightness that ye wore, And paled your tints for evermoreâ A mighty spell is yours to speed The poet's soul across the main, While martial lay and warlike deed Chase slumber from his throbbing brain. Ye jewels from âAuld Scotia'sâ breast, Blest be the hand that gave, thrice blest. THE NIGHT-BLOOMING CEREUS. This flower makes an audible report when it bursts its sheath. Strange that a thing so beautiful should so love the night! A lighted lamp in the green-house hung, And thither thronged the old and young, The birth of a wondrous flower to mark, That blooms when the world in shadow lies, And, ere the matin of the lark, Droops, hangs its beauteous head, and dies. A plant, without a leaf, was seen Upcoiling like a serpent green; And the chain-swung cresset showering down A stream of radiance, rich and full, Disclosed a stem of reddish brown, Adorned with a wavy fringe-like wool, And bearing a bud about to burst By the balmy breath of evening nursed. The pealing cannon rends the sky, And tremble bells in the turret high, When a royal heir the million hail, And clearly rang on the perfumed gale A startling noise like a glad salute, When the pulsing and expanding heart Of the cactus broke its bonds apart, And the listeners round stood charm'd and mute. A dazzling halo round it gleamedâ A type of purity it seemed, While the broken casket of the gem Was changed to a starry diadem. A spotless crown the lily wears, But a tenderer hue the cactus bears, And the white rose in her fragrant bower Sat veiled, outshone by a fairer flower. Its cup, inlaid with glistening gold, Was meet for the elfin queen to hold, When bright, nectarean wine is poured By waiting fays at her dainty board; And in form had more of antique grace Than foliated, classic vase That modern art to rival tries In vain beneath Ausonian skies; Its clear, transparent depths displayed A delicate and greenish shade, That a fanciful poet would declare Was like in hue to a mermaid's hair. Its leaves of pure and pearl-like white Woke dreams of innocence and Heaven; Oh! why was such a gem to night, And not to rose-lipped morning given? That mother nature might impart A lesson to the breaking heart, And on the cloud of sorrow lone A gleam of loveliness be thrownâ That eyes, all dim with tears, might see An emblem fair of hope unfold, Telling of glory yet to beâ Of bliss, by mortal voice untold, In a land that is stranger to mildew and gloom, Basking in light, and forever in bloom. THE QUIET ARBOR âHence let me haste into the midwood shade, And on the dark green grass, beside the brink Of haunted stream, that by the roots of oak Rolls o'er the rocky channel, lie at large.â When study pales my visage, and I feel Oppressive languor chaining heart and brain, Away from toil and books I often steal, Exploring haunts where Quiet holdeth reign. I love the wild, the picturesqueâand when Her nest of moss the roving linnet weaves, And the low thorn is beautiful with flowers, I seek my favorite glen, While warm winds wanton with the twinkling leaves And pass in pleasant idleness the hours. Where a dark arbor, by the mingling boughs Of two gigantic hemlock trees, is made, I rest my limbs, and with wild shout arouse The ruffed grouse from her cover in the shade. The tapping flicker does not keep aloof, But plies his noisy bill above my head, To greet my coming, while the summer heat Falls on the verdant roof That canopies my green, luxurious bed, With the fresh odors of the forest sweet. I lie and listen to the lulling tones Of the clear brook that works its winding way, Far down through brush, and over mossy stones, The green marge wetting with its silver spray. The path is steep and perilous that leads To the cold, flashing watersâand few dare Descend to quaff refreshment from their flow; For thick, entangling weeds In the loose soil seem matted to ensnare The foot of him that ventureth below. In the rich bottom of the dale, a grove Of sylvan giants woos the roving eye; The topmost limbs wave not their leaves above The shrubby brow of the declivity. Sometimes in musing indolence I stand, And drink in rapture from the peaceful scene, Or call up old rememberings from sleep; Then pluck with careless hand The ripe red berries of the winter-green, That blush like rubies on the verdant steep. I watch the wild bees, from my cool retreat, Hum tunefully around the blue harebell, Before they enter to extract the sweet That lieth hidden in each fragrant cell. The small ground-squirrels leave their dwellings dark, In the black, slaty soil, and gambol oft On an old oak with star-moss overgrown, And reft of branch and bark; While the fierce hawk forsakes his realm aloft, And settles on the blasted pine, his throne. Where the broad banks slope gently downward, grow The sassafras and other fragrant trees; And the bright lilies of the wave below Give nods of recognition to the breeze. In mild accordance with the quiet scene, Beat tranquilly the pulses of my heart; While fancy populates the place with fays, In robes of dazzling sheen, Who dance to merry music and depart, While other fairy visions cheat the gaze. Around the sapling, like a verdant belt, The claspers of the honeysuckle twine; The Dryads of Argos never dwelt Within a bower more beautiful than mine: The humming-bird is near me on the wing, And the warm breeze with dulcet tone is stealing Through the green plumage of the hemlocks old, A spiritual thing; While butterflies round marshy spots are wheeling, Clad in their dazzling liveries of gold. The dusky lord of knife and hatchet roves Near my wild haunt of loveliness no more; He saw, amid his old ancestral groves, Throng pale invaders from a foreign shoreâ Then heard thy sylvan monarchs, one by one, With all their leafy diadems laid low, And sought an undiscoverable lair Toward the dim setting sun, With empty quiver and a broken bow, And gloomy brow contorted by despair. The game he hunted craftily is gone, And meadow-grass conceals his ancient trail; The flock is feeding where his camp-fire shone, And rang his whoop of triumph on the gale: His implements of battle and the chase Are often found near my romantic bower, For the rich scene about it is allied To legends of his race; And mournful traces of his day of power Make classic grove, and glade, and river-side. Frost, washing rain-drops, and the plough, lay bare The rude graves of his sires on hill and plain, Exposing their white secrets to the air, And the rough foot-fall of the whistling swain. When Autumn robes the forest in a dress Of many colors, he returns no more, To pay due homage to ancestral dust From distant wilderness; The wave no longer flashes with his oar, And crusted is his tomahawk with rust. His wood-land language cannot wholly die, While swift Conesus rolls in rippling glee Between broad, swelling banks of verdant dye, To mix his waters with the Genesee. These tall old hemlocks tell of other days, When the red warrior rested in their shade, The painted ruler of the scene around: And the far hills, that raise Their wooded tops, by summer lovely made, In marks of ancient Indian rule aboud. When the life-stream is frozen in my veins, And hollow are my features with decay, I fondly hope my cold and stiff remains May not be hidden from the light of day, In the dark yard where hundreds hide their dead; For I would rather have a pleasant grave Beneath the roofing of my arbor green, With wild grass overspread; While far below sing bird and gurgling wave, Through the dense, rustling thicket, dimly seen. LAMENT FOR SUMMER. A softened light falls on the hill's misty head, And voices of mourning cry âSummer is dead!â In the depths of the wood there are signs of decay, And the green of the meadow is fading away; Round pools that the rain-storm hath left in the street, A golden-winged bevy, the butterflies meetâ A delicate blue is erased from the sky, And the beard of the thistle is sailing on high. Glad mother of beauty, lost Summer, wert thouâ A rosy tiara encircled thy brow; Dew, fresh from the starr'd urn of night, was thy wine, What face in the lakelet was glassed fair as thine? Festooned by the ivyâwith lattice suppliedâ Thy hall in the green wood was airy and wide, Bird, breeze, leaf and streamlet discoursed there in glee, And the Genius of flowers spread a carpet for thee. The nymph that we worshipped in mould hath been laid, There is gloom in the fields, on the sun's disc a shadeâ The cricket, in sable habiliments dress'd, Is piping a dirge near the place of her rest; Low winds murmur prayer for the sleeper's repose, The locust sad note on his clarion blows, And hollow-voiced spirits that whisper of dole, Throng nightly around her funereal knoll. Death came to thee, Summer, in loveliest guise, All bright was thy smile when he curtained thine eyesâ Though deep in thy bosom was planted his dart, There was bloom on thy cheekâthere was warmth at thy heart, As gentle Autumnus bent over thy bier He whispered âAwake theeâarise, sister dear!â So life-like were tints that each feature retained, Though the wine of thy fleeting existence was drained. Where bruised by the wheel and armed hoof of the steed, Blooms on by the wayside the lowly may-weed; Yon dove-flock is gleaning each kernel of grain That falls from the creaking and o'erloaded wain: In glossy black coat sits the clamorous crow On the top of tall oak, and he prophesies woe While the first withered leaves of the forest are shed On the newly-made grave of the loved and the dead. When coral-lipped Summer breathed mournful adieu, A landscape enriched by her smile was in viewâ The cheek of the cloud was with violet tinged, And an edging of azure the forest-top fringed; Light airs passing over the dewy buckwheat, Perfume bore abroad that was grateful and sweet, And bees in the blossoms that whitened the field Found nectar more pure than Hymettus can yield. Mourn, mourn for the peerless and jovial-hearted To the shadowy climate of silence departed! Ere south had the passenger-pigeon retired, Or gone was the robin, young Summer expired; Dew-webbed is the stubble and pasture at morn, And rubies are set in the crown of the thornâ The boughs of the orchard with fruit are depress'd, But cold lies the clod on the Slumberer's breast! AUTUMNAL MUSINGS. An opening in the cloud! And sunlight, gushing tremulously through, Drinks up the white, thin shroud That spread where lately shone the summer dew. The sky is dark again; And, roaming sadly in the wood-land path, I deem that grove and plain Lie in the shadow of celestial wrath. The pleasant leaves are dead, And make sad music when the north-wind stirs The branches overhead, And gathers them to forest-sepulchres. The crow, in accents harsh, Gives voice to Sorrow in his olden haunt; But nigh the reedy marsh I hear no more the black-bird's merry chaunt. The brook no longer winds In silver beauty by the homes of men, And, full of laughter, finds A green concealment in the shrubby glen. But melancholy tones From the worn, pebbly channel faintly rise, Like low, despairing moans That leave maternal lips when childhood dies: And well the brook may mourn; For the bright leaves that shaded from the sun Its tripping wave, are torn From the dark, wind-toss'd branches, one by one:â And on yon herbs that made Its margin beautiful, the hoary frost A blighting finger laid, And their green witchery of hue is lost. The flowers no longer raise Their cups of fragrance, courted by the bee; But the blithe squirrel pays Enriching visits to the walnut-tree. Dry twigs beneath my feet The secret of my neighborhood betray, And from her still retreat The partridge flies on whirring wing away. What teachers are the oaks, With their torn mantles waving in the blast; While the black raven croaks A dirge for beauty in the dust at last! How sweetly do the skies, And the wide earth that withers far below, Though tongueless, sermonize On that great change we all must undergo! The distant hill up-towers, With its gray top in smoky verdure clad; And, robbed of sunny flowers, The meadows round look desolate and sad. What eastern monarch owns A robe of richer color than these leaves That speak in rustling tones, And fall in rainbow flakes when autumn grieves? Though blest the distant coast, Where grow the flowering lemon and sweet lime, No foreign land can boast The passing beauty of our autumn-time. THE OLD YEAR. When a year ends its mission, nature's harp Is tuned, methinks, to notes of mournfulnessâ The leafless wood is filled with dirge-like sounds, Unheard at other timesâand on the beach Of lone blue lake, or ocean's wilder strand, The waves send up a melancholy roar, As if bereaved of something that they loved; Snow, newly fallen, on the wintry waste, Lifted in whirling masses by the gale, Is shaped by fancy into ghostly forms Treading the dance of deathâand air-borne clouds That brush the mountain's top, whose surging pines Make music for the dark procession meet, Seem like a funeral escort following The Old Year to his grave. Oh! not unmourned By winged sprites, believe the fabling bards, Though mortal tongue no lamentation raise, Vanish the seasons with their varied charmsâ Their flowers, their fruits, their many-colored groves, And fireside joys, when howl the blasts of night. Another wreck, with treasure in her hold, Hath reached the port of dark eternity, Furling her ragged canvas, nevermore To brave the treacherous shoal, the hidden rock. Her deck was crowded with a laughing throng When merrily the voyage she began, Flapping her white wing like some joyous gull Disporting on the bosom of the brine. Not all outlived the bark that bore them onâ Some perished when no cloud was in the sky, And air was balmy with the breath of flowersâ And others, heart-chilled by unfriendly gales That blew from Want's inhospitable coast, Isles of complaining sorrow, dark with yew, And over ice-fields, by Misfortune owned, Lashed to the plunging plank, have disappeared. Many are floating in a vessel launched An hour agone to stem the tide of time, Their tongues full loudly shouting, while she scuds Before the breezeââHealth to the Outward Bound!â On! on! though fair the weather be, or foul, Thou restless rover on a troubled sea! Ah! with a gallant bearing, like thine own, The wreck, of which I spake, once walked the waves; Exultant Hope was at the helm, and Joy Her topmast with a painted streamer decked, And now her cruise is o'erâher keel at rest. The freight she bore, alas, was like thine own! The golden visions of romantic youth; Fancies of girlhood, delicate and sweet; The growing selfishness of frosty age; Love's cherished jewels, and majestic plans Engendered by ambition's burning brain; The coffin and the cradle, stowed away In her deep hold, with toys and mourning weeds, In the same varnish glittered side by side; Pale winding-sheet, and bridal-garment, packed In the same trunk together, were on board; The myrtle and the cypress intertwined In a strange wreath their foliage, and oft, By tolling bell, the lover's lute was drowned. On to thy sunless haven, fated bark! Beauty, the waker of a wondrous spell, Manhood, rejoicing in his lusty thews, And childhood, warbling like a lark at morn, Must perish by the way, but pause not thou! Twelve moons will wax and wane before thy place Of everlasting anchorage is found; And in that space of time the world may wear An aspect that it never knew before. The bonds are snapping, one by one, that bind The beaten slave unto a laboring oar: The lifted veil unfolds a brighter scene Than the dark back-ground of the mournful past; Preluding notes of a triumphant song, Rousing besotted nations, on the wind Wander like spirits that will not be laid. The human soul, a mirror darkened long By passion's mist, and vapor black and dense Uprising from the fens of ignorance, Shall be unclouded as it was of yore, Ere mildew fell on paradiseâagain Its surface flashing back the light of heaven. Old poets feigned that the revolving months Were in obeyance to Biformis wise, Who forward looked, and backward threw his glance. Watch by Time's mighty outward gate he kept, A janitor of grave and reverend mien! Who aided, with his hand, the faltering steps Of each out-going, palsy-shaken Year, While in rushed blithe successors, with a bound. Thereby unfolded was a startling truth; For Life, and his wan, shadowy brother, Death, Exit and entrance at one door-way find. Outlasting generations of mankind, The tallest Titan of the woods must fall, And turn again to inorganic mould, Retaining, though complete the ruin seems, The rudiments of form and majesty, And principle of efflorescence still. Despair not, laborer for human weal! Though perish, one by one, thy golden hopes; Ashes remain in which some living spark May veil its brightness, destined to illume Cimmerian darkness with electric gleams. Despair not, mourner, though the work of change Is with the pale departed going on! Despair not, dying maiden, while the leaves Are paler growing in thy blighted rose! The perishable flesh will waste to dust, But through the portals of Decay will stream A dazzling blaze of loveliness once more. Transmuted by inevitable laws, Loathsome putrescence will soon beauteous be, The crumbling wreck become a fabric fair. NEW-YEAR MUSINGS. Another year of bloom and blight Is dead, with darkness for a shroudâ Gone, like some phantom of the night, Gone, like the shadow of a cloud. Wild polar spirits chime a dirge, And, mingling with the dreadful roar, I hear old Ocean's angry surge Beat time upon the frozen shore. Love, count thy jewels!ânot a few Have vanished from thy casket frail, More false than diamonds of the dew, Or rounded drops of summer hail. Look, Hope! upon thy cherished flowers, So bright of hue twelve moons ago! May will not wake them with her showers, Nor warm them with her genial glow. Ambition! what is left thee now, Too proud to beg, too brave to moan? Scorn points to thy dishonored browâ Hate taunts a rival overthrown. Mad builder on a treach'rous bank, Washed by a fierce devouring stream, How thy tall, misshapen towers sank, Poor frame-work of a frantic dream! Ho! Avarice! halt a little while, And hold communion with thyselfâ But banish that complacent smile While gloating o'er ill-gotten pelf. Thy poor allottery of time Is drawing near its darkening close, And awful is old age when crime Gleams, hell-like, through its gath'ring snows. Give back to Woe the little all Wrung by thy hard, exacting hand; The king of hearse and night-black pall Will not be bribed by golden sand. Give back to Want the lowly shed, By law-craft and its wiles made thine; Give back, extortioner, the bread For which her pleading orphans pine. Children of grandeur! know ye not, While merry over Christmas cheer, That, weary of their wretched lot, A beggar'd crowd were starving near; That mothers, while chill night came on, To garrets, dens, and cellars crept, And found the last poor fagot gone, While shivering infants round them wept? Votaries of mirth! were ye aware, While moving in the graceful dance To notes of some enlivening air, And warmed by beauty's beaming glance, That Genius, with his bleeding feet, And war with famine doomed to wage, Was wandering, homeless, in the street, Rejected by a coward age? To Worth give not a groat awayâ The public goose let Barnum carve: Enrich the humbugs of to-day, But let the heirs of Fulton starve. Give the poor soldier, maimed in fight, Allowance scant of bitter bread, But thousands, in a single night, To some famed cantatrice instead. Let Valor in his nameless grave Commingle with ensanguined mould; The surplus of your earnings save To load Jack Harlequin with gold. The passport of the âUpper Ten,â Though borne by knave, or downright fool, Must be obeyed by vulgar men, For fashion, not the sage, should rule. Another pilgrim, faint and worn, Has reached the caverns of the Past, While Winter winds his icy horn, And trooping demons ride the blast. To some he brought a golden shower, Sweet bridal joys, and home-delights; Pearls, wrested from the clutch of power, Bright happy days, and peaceful nights: To others he has brought despair, And wreck upon the stormy waves; Flight from oppression's bloody lairâ Chains, scaffolds, broken hearts, and graves. But, Hungary, thy chosen chief Will back in arms ere long return; The skies give promise of reliefâ Air is alive with voices stern:â The northern bear his brood may wake, But they shall gnaw thy heart no more; But on his own grim carcass make, When roused the pack, a meal of gore. Back, savage, to thy deserts dread, Where night her umbrage loves to fling! The British Lion lifts his headâ The Western Eagle flaps his wing. And, Poland, may this new-born year Thy glad redemption usher in, While perish, smit with mortal fear, The vassals of anointed sin. Walk, tyrant, with a guarded treadâ Let not your pulse too proudly beat! The heavens are darkening overhead, And earth is mined beneath your feet. Though shades of martyrs haunt thy shore, Isle of the blue, embracing sea! There is deliverance in store, A place in freedom's hall for thee. Thy tears of blood shall yet be dried, Thy funeral sackcloth thrown away, While robed in splendor, like a bride, The beams of joy around thee play. Another wave upon the beach Has dashed its freight of good and ill; Our hands abroad we vainly reach, In quest of those whose hearts are still. Another mile-stone we have gainedâ The goal of rest is drawing nigh, And sadly is the vision pained By pictures that once charmed our eye. Oh! sooner rake in ashes cold For letters that have fed the blaze, Than seek to find the bliss of old, The transports of our younger days Enough, though hushed the voice of glee, If in our breasts contentment calm Sits, like a halcyon on the sea, Dispensing an oblivious balm. NEW YEAR FANCIES. Time's belfry trembles with another knell! Another year hath vanished like the snow That wastes beneath young April's melting glance. The forest, naked to the lightest twig, Is now a mournful instrument of sound, From which the blast, a wild performer, calls Mysterious music, swaying its old boughs, And a deep Spirit Voice in unison Chants this wild hymn, in memory of the lost. HYMN. To the sunless land of death The poor, white-haired Old Year Hath gone with his children twelve, Brave sons and daughters dear: And the sides of the wooded hill Are threshed by the Storm King's flail, And rusheth through the glen, With a hollow sound, the gale. Bright openings in the cloud Cheered the Old Year's dying days, While he thought of the summer flowers, And of autumn's purple haze; And a dream âthat such things were,â Though it bathed in light his heart, Was a call from another world, And a warning to depart. Last born of a little flock Wert thou, December wild! And, shuddering, looked thy sire On his dark, ill-boding child; For a fiend in the Old Man's ear Had screamed a warning loud, That the twelfth one of the band Would bring him to his shroud. More wan his visage grew When the luckless reign began, And a chill crept through the veins Of the venerable man: And how heartless was thy laugh When descending hail and sleet On the palsy-shaken form Of the bowed old Pilgrim beat. On the dead and shrivelled leaves With a trembling step and slow, Craving refuge from the storm, Marched that hoary man of woe; And he roved through church-yards bleak, Reading names he loved the best; Then in faltering accents prayed For a couch of endless rest. Now he lieth stark and mute, With the mighty ones of old; He hath gone with all his joys And his sorrows manifold; But seed by the Old Year sown Will in other hours uprise, And the plants of evil bear, Mixed with blossoms for the skies. THE WITCH. [FROM AN UNPUBLISHED TALE OF SHETLAND.] The beldame on the waves below Flung the dark contents of her chalice, Dimming the brightness of their snow, With scowl denoting demon-malice, And bosom cold to mortal painâ Then, making circles with her wand Sang in a low, mysterious strain The power of bard to paint beyond. Ministers of vengeance leave Gloomy grot and sunless cave! Ere the dewy reign of eve Death must triumph on the wave:â Habited in robes of wrath, Let your follower be Grief! Guide his vessel on the path Leading to this fatal reef; Word, with insult fraught, of me He hath spoken daringly, And a leader claims the skill Of her troop to work him illâ He must drown! Spirits, who beneath the deep Darkly build the wrecking rock! Wake the dreaming storm from sleep, And the doors of safety lock! Fleetly, on their palfreys white, Swept the Fatal Sisters by His old castle yesternight, Shrieking outââThy doom is nigh!â Genii of the clouds! array Arching sky in black to-day; For the tongue of leader dread To her ghastly troop hath saidâ He must drown! Though far below the haunted crag Sang moaningly the frothy surge, Erect and demon-like, the hag Stood on its beetling verge; While sunlight gave the mountain, brown And verdureless, a golden crown, Her gaze was fixed upon a sail That lightly flew before the gale; And meaningly the cliffs around Gave back her laugh of wild delight, The curlew starting with the sound, While faded mast and spar from sight. Not well could pen portray the face And figure of that grim, weird woman; One, gazing, would have thought the race She darkly sprang from superhuman. The garment round her shoulders cast Was by a silver brooch made fast; And, crested by a raven feather, A bonnet muffled up her head, Dark with the stains of time and weather; Her shrivelled neck was bare,âand thread, Whose coloring was caught from night, Depended from a distaff light, That near her lay, with noxious weeds, On which the dew yet shone in beads, And plants of power that flourish best When plaintively the night-wind grievesâ When day has faded in the west, And other flowers have shut their leaves. Low on the forehead of the crone The hair in grisly masses grew; Her lips were shrunken, and the bone Of her lean cheek shone clearly through The parchment-like and wrinkled skin, That lay in furrows long and deep: Like some foul votary of sin, Just risen from a dreamless sleep, And merry with a fearful mirth By reason of return to earthâ Exulting that foul charm again To generate disease and pain Was in her keeping, stood the hag Surveying ocean from the crag The glad bird hushed its warbled strains When flitting by.âWithin her veins The fountains of vitality Long in appearance had been dried, Though the red twinkle of her eye Debility of frame belied; And fiercely by the fire of hate Her glance at times was lighted up. In one hand, to unravel fate, She held an old enchanted cup, Whose handle cunningly resembled The knotted snake in act to spring, While lightly in the other trembled A wand of magic fashioning. Of freestone made and granite block, A mossy structure capp'd the rock, And stood as if the wind and rain Of centuries had beat in vain On rugged roof and side of stone With hanging lichen overgrown. The lintel of the cot was low, And piping winds could come and go Through fissures in the granite gray, Defying tempest, time, decay. The regal pine, that loves to toss Its plumage on the mountain head, Proud perch of eagles! in the moss Of ages richly habited, Grew not in stately beauty there, Green banners flinging to the air; But the lonely spot was a fitting home For the mystic being of my story; Beneath lay ocean, flecked with foam, And round were piled, In grandeur wild, Rocks with the flight of ages hoary. Above, ribbed with fragments of porphyry stone, The mountain raised its leafless cone; And, wearing channels deep and wide, The torrent came down its precip'tous side. Murmurs, born in caverns dark, Came up where the lonely crag was rifted; And reefs, to wreck the gallant bark, Above the wave their edges lifted. Against the coast, with dark rock bound, The waters struck with earthquake sound, Or, rushing on, to madness toss'd, In cold, unlighted caves were lost. No leafy shrub, with blossoms hung, Rich odor on the light winds flung; Nor bush with dewy berries bright The small birds tempted to alight; And not one blade of grassy green Gave freshness to the barren scene; But meet was the place of for its occupant old, Communion with spirits of evil to hold. THE MEMPHIAN MUMMY. âO, I could pass all relics Left by the pomps of old, To gaze on this rude monument Cast in affection's mould.â Mrs. Hemans. Daughter of Egypt, on thy shrunken face The hues of life and health no longer glow; And change hath written on thy coffin-case Those words of mournful importââlong ago.â The light, in thy unseeing eye, is deadâ Thy teeth no longer shame the ocean pearl: The dewy freshness of thy lip hath fled, And gone thy pride of curl. The debt of nature myriads have paid, And o'er them closed Oblivion's misty wave, Since weeping friends thy breathless form arrayed In the sad vesture of the starless grave. Those hollow eyes with pleasure may have beamed, Or tears, perhaps, that dusky cheek have wet; Upon thy brow, for aught sage knows, hath gleamed Some queenly coronet. Perchance thine ear, so very dull and cold, The mystic lyre of Memnon often heard, When sunrise tinged the morning sky with gold, And all its strings melodiously stirred. An infant may have slumbered in those arms, That hang so still and nerveless by thy side; Perchance some Pharaoh, yielding to thy charms, Made thee his royal bride. The breathing statue and the speaking bust Of all their grace and beauty have been reft, And dome and tower have crumbled into dust Since thy freed soul its mortal prison left. Although the rock, for many ages, hid Thy rigid features from the light of day, Thou standest up, like Egypt's pyramid, Defying stern decay. Amid the chords of some love-kindling lute Those taper fingers may have often strayed; Thy tongue, which hath for centuries been mute, To Apis or to Isis may have prayed. When ancient Memphis was the seat of powerâ When mirth and music reigned within her walls, Perchance of throngs thou wert the worshipped flower, That sought her princely halls. The yellow sunlight falls upon thee now, But cannot melt the icy chain of death; The zephyr's wing is fanning thy dark brow, But thou art reckless of its balmy breath. When joy held empire in thy stony breast, Hadst thou no haunt upon the Nile's green shore, To muse upon his waters, when at rest, Or listen to their roar? Did ever cross thy mind the chilling thought, While drinking rapture from the vernal gale, That e'er thy form by strangers would be bought, And made the theme of many an erring tale? When the last trump shall animate the tomb, And call the dead from out the sea and earthâ Maiden, thy spirit will its dust resume, Far from thy place of birth. THE SEXTON OF TIME. The windows were fastened, and bolted the doorâ One mouldering brand threw faint light on the floor, When, followed by twelve heavy beats of the clock, A spirit unseen at my casement did knock; âWho is here?âwho is here?ââwith a shudder I cried, And a voice, hollow-toned like the night-wind, replied: âThe sad, withered heart of that traveller old, The gray-headed Year is now silent and cold; On a pallet of straw wan and wasted he lies, No warmth in his veins, and no light in his eyes; I come, hither called, moody Sexton of Time! From my cavernous home in a mystical clime. âA king, many months, did he rule in the land, And the sceptre of empire befitted his hand; In June his proud palace with azure was hungâ Through its picturesque halls witching melody rungâ Rich emerald carpet each floor overspread, Embroidered with blossoms, to soften the tread. âOh! where shall I trench a receptacle deep; Where find for the pilgrim a chamber of sleep! Oh! not by the wayside, for over his grave A banner of white would the storm-demon wave, And frolicsome steeds, ringing bells on the blast, While Mirth held the reins, would be hurrying past. âOh! not in the woods would I build him a tombâ Gone, gone are their crowns, and no violets bloom; In their desolate depths not a warbler is seen, The brook hath no murmurâits margin no green, And the sobbing of winds, and the creaking of boughs, From rest might the heart-broken slumberer rouse. âHe dropped, causing deeper the verdure to grow, Bright dew where the lost and the lovely lie low, And sent golden sunshine, and pattering showers, While bright grew the desolate grave-yard with flowers, But earth, once so fair by his agency made, Will furnish no cell where his bones may be laid. âDark bearers will come at the blast of my horn: His corse shall be gently to Shadow-Land borne, And the Sexton of Time will a sepulchre build In its valley by winter, the tyrant, unchilled; While the newly-crowned Year, a wild rioter, laughs At the wassailing board, and a full bumper quaffs. âRevel on!ârevel on! with the youthful and gay. Proud heir of the fallen! thy locks shall grow gray, Though the days of thy life inexhaustible seem, They will melt like the dewâthey will pass like a dream; From spring-time to winter the journey is brief, And the fields of delight stretch to deserts of grief!â The voice died away, and a trumpet was blownâ I looked from my window in terror, I own, And phantom-like forms, by the snow-light, beheld, A dim figure leading them, hoary with eld, The funeral it seemed of the friendless Old Year, For borne, in their midst, was a shadowy bier. TRIUMPHS OF PEACE. From palace, cot and cave, Streamed forth a nation in the olden time To crown with flowers the brave Flushed with the conquest of some far-off clime, And louder than the roar of meeting seas, Applauding thunder rolled upon the breeze. Memorial-columns rose Decked with the spoils of conquered foes, And bards of high renown their stormy pÃ¦ans sung, While Sculpture touched the marble white, And, woke by his transforming might, To life the statue sprung. The vassal to his task was chainedâ The coffers of the state were drained In rearing arches, bright with wasted gold, That after generations might be told A thing of dust once reigned. Tombs, hollowed by long years of toil, Were built to shrine heroic clay, Too proud to rest in vulgar soil, And moulder silently away; Though treasure lavished on the dead The wretched might have clothed and fedâ Dragged merit from obscuring shade, And debts of gratitude have paid; From want relieved neglected sage, Or veteran in battle tried; Smoothed the rough path of weary age, And the sad tears of orphanage have dried. Though green the laurel round the brow Of wasting and triumphant war, Peace, with her sacred olive bough, Can boast of conquests nobler far: Beneath her gentle sway Earth blossoms like a roseâ The wide old woods recede away, Through realms, unknown but yesterday, The tide of empire flows. Woke by her voice rise battlement and tower, Art builds a home and Learning finds a bowerâ Triumphant Labor for the conflict girds, Speaks in great works instead of empty words; Bends stubborn matter to his will, Drains the foul marsh, and rends in twain the hillâ A hanging bridge across the torrent flings, And gives the car of fire resistless wings. Light kindles up the forest to its heart, And happy thousands throng the new-born mart; Fleet ships of steam, deriding tide and blast, On the blue, bounding waters hurry past; Adventure, eager for the task, explores Primeval wilds, and lone, sequestered shoresâ Braves every peril, and a beacon lights To guide the nations on untrodden heights. THE MIGHT OF SONG. [âI was in the hall of the castle, disguised as a harper from the wild shores of Skianack. My purpose was to have plunged my dirk in the body of the âM'Auley with the Bloody Hand,â before whom our race trembles; but I saw Annot Lyle, even when my hand was on the hilt of my dagger. She touched her clÃ rsach (Highland Harp) to a Song of the Children of the Mist. The woods in which we had dwelt, pleasantly rustled their green leaves in the song, and our streams were there with the sound of all their waters. The fountains of mine eyes were opened, and the hour of revenge passed away.â]â Legend of Montrose. Disguised as a harper, I stood in the hall, And loud was the clatter Of arms on the wall. Dark, dark grew my brow, for the sheen of their blades Was dim with the blood of our old men and maids. The scourge of my people, The Red Hand, was near And whispered the ghosts Of the slain in mine earâ âShall a foeman be safe while a Son of the Mist Wears the dirk of his ancestors chained to his wrist? âShall terror the veins Of the fatherless freeze, While the bay of the black hound Comes down with the breeze? Shall our hearth-stones be roofless, and Ronald forget In the blood of the monster to cancel the debt?â âNo! no!âby the bones Of the dead we have sworn Ere night fall the Laird For his brother shall mourn: With the slaughter of kinsmen his tartan is red, And the plumes of our chief grace his bonneted head.â Toward the weaponless slayer I made but one stride, With hand on the hilt Of the dirk by my side,â When, thrilling my heart to its innermost cell, On mine ear a wild burst of rich melody fell. At length my glance rested On Annot the fair, Whose smile vies in brightness The gold of her hair; To a song of our race her light clÃ rsach Harp. Vide Macleod's Gaelic dictionary. was strung, And, bathing my cheek, dropped the tears while she sung. I saw our own streams Glide in beauty along, And the voice of their waters I heard in the song; The rustling of leaves, and wild carol of bird In glens where my forefathers slumber, I heard. My hand the dark hilt Of my weapon forsook, For my frame, like an aspen, With sorrowing shook; And my childhood came back with its innocent shout, While the fire of revenge in my bosom went out. THE DEAD HUNTER. Here, here at last I've found thee Torn by the beast of preyâ The dim old forest round thee, Thy couch the dark wet clay. From lip and cheek have faded For aye the tints of life;â Soiled is the belt I braided With the red rain of strife. I told thee yestermorning That foes lay ambushed near, For borne was note of warning Unto my dreaming ear From the far Spirit Land. No more thine arms will rattle Light bracelets in the danceâ Thine eye no more in battle Flash forth indignant glance. My voice that once could cheer thee Thrills not that bosom now; Thy bow lies broken near thee, And blood-stained is thy brow: With pace the moose outspeeding To hunt the antlered herd, Thou wentest forth unheeding The sadly-whispered word Of the far Spirit Land. Oh, bitterly my nation Will mourn thy timeless fall, For who can fill thy station Within the council-hall? My cone-like lodge is lonelyâ The fount of joy is dry, For life was pleasant only When thou, dead chief, wert nigh! My tree of hope is blighted, Its trunk is in the dust; But we will be united Ere many moons, I trust, In the far Spirit Land. A dwelling, cold and narrow, Must now the strong arm hide That best could wing the arrow, Or the light paddle guide; The muttering storm is hiding With veil of gloomy dye The day-god lately riding With lustrous pomp on high; But while the cloud is shedding Cold rain-drops on thy breast, Thy warlike ghost is treading The chase-grounds of the blest In the far Spirit Land. The wolf stalks by thee heeding Thy fatal aim no moreâ The doe and fawn are feeding Near thy lone couch of gore. The quivered band will never Thy war-shout hear again; The hand is stilled for ever That once piled high the slain; But, thick as bees that cluster In hollows of the wood, Thy clan for combat muster, While a wild cry for blood Thrills through the Spirit Land. BLAKE'S VISITANTS. [âBlake, the painter, forgot the present in the past. He conceived that he had formed friendships with distinguished individuals of antiquity. He asserted that they appeared to him, and were luminous and majestic shadows. The most propitious time for their visits was from nine at night till five in the morning.â] The stars shed a dreamy lightâ The wind, like an infant, sighs; My lattice gleams, for the queen of night Looks through with her soft, bright eyes. I carry the mystic key That unlocks the mighty Past, And, ere long, the dead to visit me Will wake in his chambers vast. The gloom of the grave forsake, Ye princes who ruled of yore! For the painter fain to life would wake Your majestic forms once more. Ye brave, with your tossing plumes, Ye bards of the pale, high brow! Leave the starless night of forgotten tombs, For my hand feels skilful now. They come, a shadowy throng, With the types of their old renownâ The Mantuan bard, with his wreath of song, The monarch with robe and crown. They come!âon the fatal Ides Of March yon conqueror fell; For the rich, green leaf of the laurel hides His baldness of forehead well. I know, though his tongue is still, By his pale, pale lips apart, The Roman whose spell of voice could thrill The depths of the coldest heartâ And behind that group of queens Bedight in superb attire, How mournfully Lesbian Sappho leans Her head on a broken lyre! That terrible shade I know By the scowl his visage wears, And the Scottish knight, his noble foe, By the broad claymore he bears. That warrior king who dyed, In Saracen gore, the sands, With his knightly harness on, beside The fiery Soldan stands. Ye laurell'd of old, all hail! I love, in the gloom of night, To rob the Past of his cloudy veil, And gaze on your features bright. Hah! the first bright beam of dawn On my window redly plays, And back, to their homes of dust, have gone The mighty of other days. UNDINE. âThy themesâ Subjects of old romance, and ocean's realm, A spacious province, where the wandering thought And 'wilder'd fancy, erring, may be lost, Are without limit.ââ Simms. I have brought, I have brought, In my pearl-studded car, Proud spoils for the lost one, From grottoes of sparâ To shroud her cold bosom A raiment of flowers That blush, fading never, In coralline bowers. I have brought, I have brought From the stillness of cells, Whose roofs are encrusted With rainbow-like shells, Bright gems to inweave Her long tresses of gold That lie on a forehead Pale, pulseless and cold. When the blue, upper waters From slumber arise, And Death paints with ominous Sable, the skiesâ When the tall bark contends With the storm-fiend in vain, Her home will be quiet Far down in the main. Her wave-girdled couch, When the water-snake trails, Will flash with the glitter Of rainbow-like scalesâ And here amidst forests That never knew blight, The dolphin will leave a Broad pathway of light. Though dead is the pulse In her death-frosted veins, I will guard, from the tooth Of decay, her remainsâ And preserve by the might Of a wonderful charm, Her freshness of cheek and Her fullness of arm. When months, years and ages, Like shadows, have fled, Her lip shall retain its Voluptuous red; And beauty will dimple Her face with a smile, When the palace lies low, In her own native isle. Sweetly mournful shall steal, Through the waters by day, From the hall of the wave-sylph Some heart-piercing lay; And delicate sprites, In the red coral bower, Will chant for the lost Maiden, dirges of power. Nigh her couch of repose, The blue shark will be made By the magical wand of Dread Undine afraidâ For I am the spirit Whose mystical sway The hell-guided agents Of ruin obey. THE LOST DAUGHTER. âAs the earth when leaves are dead, As the night when sleep is sped, As the heart when joy is fled, I am left lone, alone.â Shelley. All lonely is thy hearth, Dusk shadows round it fall, And tones of love and mirth Are hushed within thy hall. Her lips have drank the brine; Her pulse is cold and still; A mournful lot is thine, Though jewels of the mine And gold thy coffers fill. The church-yard turf below Her sainted mother lies, And there spring up and grow Bright flowers of varied dyes; And sorrow for thy child Less desolate would be, If near that mother mild Her grave-mound was up-piled Beneath the same old tree. For thee the dawn is bright, Eve gemmed with stars in vain; Thou mournest for a light That ne'er can shine again: Thy garden bowers with grass And weeds are overrun; The friends of old, alas! Ungreeted by thee pass, For thou with earth hast done! By night her eyes of blue Upon thee sweetly gleam, But morning proves untrue The brief but blissful dream; Her lute no longer rings To dust and silence wed, And to its shattered strings The spider's drapery clingsâ Drear sign that she is dead. With mutter sad and low Why read those linesâher lastâ Then with a cry of woe Interrogate the blast? The star of hope grows dark, And ocean's barren shoreâ With straining eye to mark Some home-returning barkâ Is paced by thee no more. Cheer up! the sands of life, Old man, are running fast; The fever and the strife Will terminate at last! Beyond time's drifting strand An everlasting rock Towers in a radiant land, And round it, hand-in-hand, Will meet love's scattered flock. BYRON'S FAREWELL. Sweet Mary! I have looked again Upon thy speaking face, And only did the wreck remain Of former bloom and grace; A fearful blight was on the rose That once thy beauty wore; Pale token that within had froze Joy's fount, to flow no more. The babe that nestled in mine arms And sported on my knee, Inherited those matchless charms Once prized so much in thee; And boyhood, with the sunny tress, That bounded through the door, Woke a drear sense of loneliness, A thought that all was o'er. Why am I sad? The light is gone That cheered my darkened way; The star, when night was coming on, That turned my gloom to day: We parted, and no tear was shed, For love's wild dream was o'er; I think of thee as of the dead; Lost, lost for evermore! My soul retains thine image yet, Though bliss is in the grave; As splendor falls, when the sun is set, On purpling wood and wave; For perished joy I will not weep, Affection crushed deplore, Though memory in mourning deep Is clad for evermore. Thine was a witchery of mien That found its type in charms By the painter drawn of Love's own queen Springing from Ocean's arms; And siren music, that ensnared Frail barks, though far from shore, Was discord, to the voice compared That I must hear no more. A face of pensive sweetness long Will haunt my troubled dreams, When couched, in the mystic land of song, On banks of golden streams: I gazed on thee as Tasso gazed On high-born Leonor, And like the bard, by passion crazed, Must hope for peace no more. My sail is flapping in the bay, The breakers foam and roll, And airy voices shout âAway! Away! poor troubled soul! The wine-cup cannot waken mirth, An Eden lost restore; Away, away! on English earth Thy feet must tread no more!â THE TRIAD. My first-born! I have marked in thee A soul that loves to dareâ Wild winds across a stormy sea Thy bark of life will bear. Young eaglet of the household-nest, Turned sunward is thine eye; A pulse is in thy little breast That beats full strong and high! I tremble when I hear thee speak In tones of clear command; Ambition's flush is on thy cheek, His iron in thy hand. Oh! guard thy ruling passion well, Or wrecked thy bark will be; Alone can virtue ride the swell On glory's troubled sea. More bright than gift of fairy land, My second born, art thou! The breath of Heaven never fanned A lovelier cheek and brow. An angel art thou, child, sent down To cheer my darker hours, And gifted with a spell to crown E'en Grief's bowed head with flowers. Daughter!â(Love's most enchanting word) Thy voice is music's own, And ever like the note of bird Announcing winter gone. June gave thee birth, and in thine eye Her azure I behold; On that soft cheek her roseate dye In those bright locks her gold. My last born! if I read aright The language of thy glance, Thou hast a soul to drink delight From streams of old romance. Each nerve is delicately strung, And through thy little heart, When minstrel-lay is played or sung, Wild thrills of rapture dart. A star, of ray benign and clear, Presided at thy birth, And filled, in slumber, is thine ear With music not of earth. Thy bolder brother's prayer will be To sway the fitful throngâ Thine, gentle boyââEnough for me The golden lute of song!â JACK'S BURIAL. [âShall we fill the maintopsail, sir?â demanded Mr. Leach, after waiting a minute or two in deference to the Commander's feelings, âor shall we hook on the yard-tackles, and stow the launch?â âNot yet, Leachânot yet: it will be unkind to poor Jack to hurry away from his grave so indecently.â ??? âThe boats, sir?â âLet them tow awhile longer. It will seem like deserting him to be rattling the yard-tackles, and stowing boats directly over his head.â]â Cooper. âAll hands!â cried the captain, âto bury the dead!â When dipped into ocean the sun's disc of red; And the west with those soft, pearly tints was imbued That paint morn and eve of a low latitude. Stretched eastward a coast lined with hillocks of sand, Dread bound of a waste, uninhabited land; In other directions the briny swell heaved, Its gloom by the skies' shifting color relieved. While passengers gathered, all mournful of look! And post at the gangway each officer took, Old Salts, with whom long he had furrowed the wave, Round the corse of poor Jack mustered silent and grave! Astern had they seen, with a thrill of dismay, The blue, gliding shark on the watch for his preyâ And a spell of repose on the vessel was cast, With her courses hauled upâtopsail laid to the mast. In hammock, a shroud for bold sea-rover meet, Poor Jack lay enveloped, with lead on his feetâ A stain on the cloth to beholder betrayed The deep wound beneath by war's messenger made. When burial-service was solemnly read, And lingering word of farewell had been said, By signal the body was loosed from the plankâ A dull, heavy plunge, and forever it sank! âShall we fill the maintopsail?â demanded the mate, âOr hook on the yard-tackles?â âWait awhile, wait! Unkind it would be, on our homeward-bound track, To hurry away from the grave of poor Jack! âA mark of respect to our comrade we owe Who sleeps in a tomb without record below, Far away, far away from the land of his birth, And the spot where his fathers rest sweetly in earth! âHis dangerous station he kept at the wheel, Though sounded his knell in the musket's loud peal; And grasping the spokes, to yon star-flag that flew With blue wing on the gale, died the mariner true!â âThe boats, sir?â hoarse voice of the officer cried, âLet them tow awhile longer!â his captain replied; âIt would seem like deserting himâcanvas to spread, Or rattle the yard-tackles over his head!â The fast-closing day grew more gloomy of dyeâ Moaned sadly the watersâclouds met in the sky, As if sympathized nature, in aspect and tone, With the sorrow-touched hearts of those mariners lone! OUR PIONEERS. Suggested by a view of Kimble's Pioneer Portrait Gallery, Rochester. âFortes ereantur fortibus et bonis.â Thanks to the son of art whose hand Has nobly labored to portray The features of that gallant band Who pioneered for us the way. Bold forest-tamers! they have scared The wild beast from his savage denâ Our uplands to the sunshine bared, And clothed with beauty hill and glen. And never in the battle's van Have men at death more calmly smiled Than our first settlers who began The work of culture in the wild. The perils of a frontier life They braved with breasts of iron mould, And sternly waged victorious strife With famine, thirst, and pinching cold. They vanish from us, one by one, In death's unlighted realm to sleep, And, oh! degenerate is the son Who would not some memorial keep: Whose sordid heart yearns not to save A transcript of their reverend faces, When the dark curtains of the grave Have closed around their coffin-cases. The car of steam is thundering by The place where blazed their cabin-fires. And where rang out the panther's cry Thought speeds along electric wires. They toiled, that WE the prize might shareâ They conquered, that WE might possess, Converting to our Eden fair The terrors of the wilderness. The bard, with soul to beauty wed, Is filled with rapture to behold The portraits of the mighty dead That crowd the galleries of old. While the weird light of painting warms The pictured canvas on the walls, Attended by majestic forms, The solemn past unlocks its halls. I deem those hearts of little worth, In view of such a pageant bright, And lodged in frames of common earth, That wake not to a wild delight. Lo! Power resumes his ancient reignâ Wrecks change to cities on the shore; All that was dead revives again, All that was lost is found once more. The martyr at the stake still bears Unflinching witness to the truth, And freedom's scarred apostle wears The glory of a second youth:â And the âgray fathersâ who have laid An empire's deep foundation here, In life-like tints should be portrayed When generations disappear. While heirs to win as pure renown, By their example taughtâendeavor, Their honored faces should look down From consecrated walls forever. THE OLD WHITE STORE. âOld faces glimmered through the doors, Old footsteps trod the upper floors. Old voices called me from without.â Tennyson. A whisper comes from the Old White Store, No longer sought by the busy throng, âEntrance seek at some other door, These walls to the worm Decay belong! Pass on, and pause not, child of sin, You would purchase naught that he keeps within!â Unscared by smoke, the weary bird Its wing on the chimney-top may fold, And shuffling feet are no longer heard Crossing the door-sill as of old: When the night-blast shakes its crazy walls, In mildewed flakes the plaster falls. Moss on the sloping roof is green, And the cornice wears a dusky tinge; Thick and red may the rust be seen On window-bar and grating-hinge; And Ruin traces, with cloudy line, His own sad name on the faded sign. In summer-time the swallow flies Through broken panes of the sash decayed, But hurries back to the free blue skies, As if of fearful shapes afraid; And weeds display their sickly leaves On window-ledge and rotting eaves. The ceiling, damp and white with mould, Hath lost the paint of other days; The crumbling bricks of the hearth are cold, Once bright with the crackling fagot's blaze; And trails, where unclean things have crept, Furrow the dust of floors unswept. Dark shelves are draped with cobwebs gray, Once laden with goods and costly wares; And wood-worms work their spiral way Through mouldering boards and cellar-stairs; Counter, and desk, and broken stool Tell a touching tale of Time's misrule. Grass shoots up near the portal wide, But spell hath the place to waken thought; Garments there for the blushing bride, And winding-sheets for the dead were bought: In sunken graves tall nettles grow, And bloom from the bride fled long ago. When came the holidays of yore, Flocked thither merry girls and boys, For a famous place was that Old White Store For tempting gifts and glittering toys; And the farmer, there, full bags of grain To market brought in his harvest-wain. The shingles, weather-browned and worn, Wild winds lift up and bear away, As, one by one, the locks are torn From a head with age and sorrow gray; And the cheerful homes of the living near Comport but ill with a place so drear. How lone is the Old White Store at night, When lamps at the village casements gleam, And sparks that emit a ruddy light From the roaring smithy upward stream! Divided reign a fearful pair, Darkness and silence, are holding there! TO TORQUATUS. HORACE, ODE VII. BOOK IV. Snows are dissolved;ânow herbage to the plain, And foliage to the trees return again. Earth's courses change, and with diminished tide Along their banks the rivers gently glide. The sister Graces, in the joyous dance, Naked, together with the Nymphs, advance;â The year, and rapid flight of pleasant day Warn us that earthly things soon pass away. To cold the zephyrs mitigation bring, And summer follows close upon the spring, Dying when fruitful autumn sheds his stores, Then back comes sluggish winter to our shores. The waning moons their wasted lustre mend; But when to nether regions we descend, Where Tullus, Ancus, Ãneas are laid, Naught we become but mouldering dust and shade. Who knoweth that the gods to-morrow's space, In his brief sum of days, will give a place? Good things of earth, that with a friend we share, Escape the greedy clutches of an heir. When once consigned, Torquatus, to the tomb, And Minos shall have sealed our awful doom, Nor eloquence, nor family, nor worth Can you recall from darkness unto earth. Not even Dian, back to life and light, Can call Hippolitus from death and night. And Theseus has no power in twain to rend Hell's chain that fetters Pirithous, his friend. FAIR MARGARET [A LEGEND OF THOMAS THE RHYMER.] [I am indebted to Hugh Cameron, Esquire, of Buffalo, N. Y., for this strange and strikingly beautiful legend. Mr. C. informs me that it has long formed a part of the fire-side lore of his own clan; and from a remote period has lived in the memory of Scotland's peasantry. He expressed surprise that men of antiquarian taste, in compiling border ballads and tales of enchantment, had not given âFair Margaretâ a conspicuous place in their pages; and at his suggestion I have attempted to clothe the fanciful outlines of the original in the drapery of English verse. The Elidon tree referred to in the poem, was the favorite seat of Thomas the Rhymer, and there he gave utterance to his prophecies.] Old yews in the church-yard are crumbled to dust, Deep shade on the grave-mound once flinging: But oral tradition, still true to its trust, Her name by the hearth-stone is singing; For never enshrined by the bard in his lay Was a being more lovely than Margaret Gray. Her father, a faithful old tenant, had died On lands of Sir Thomas the Seerâ And the child who had sprung like a flower by his side, Sole mourner, had followed his bier; But Ercildoun's knight to the orphan was kind, And watched like a parent the growth of her mind. The wizard knew well that her mind was endowed With sight mortal vision surpassingâ Now piercing the heart of oblivion's cloud, The Past, in its depths, clearly glassing; Anon sending glance through the curtain of dread Behind which the realm of the Future lies spread. He gave her a key to decipher dim scrolls, With characters wild scribbled over; And taught her dark words that would summon back souls Of the dead round the living to hover: Or oped, high discourse with his pupils to hold, Old books of enchantment with clasps of bright gold. The elf-queen had met her in green haunted dells, When stars in the zenith are twinkling, And time kept the tramp of her palfrey to bells, At her bridle-rein merrily tinkling: By Huntley Burn oft, in the gloaming, she strolled Weird shapes, that were not of this earth, to behold. One eve came true Thomas to Margaret's bower, In this wise the maiden addressing:â âNo more will I visible be from this hour, Save to those sight unearthly possessing; But when I am seen at feast, funeral or fair, Let the mortal who makes revelation beware!â Long years came and passed, and the Rhymer's dread seat Was vacant the Elidon tree under, And oft would old friends by the ingle-side meet, And talk of his absence in wonder: Some thought that, afar from the dwellings of men, He had died in some lone Highland forest or glen: But others believed that in bright fairy land The mighty magician was livingâ That newness of life to worn heart and weak hand Soft winds and pure waters were giving; That back to the region of heather and pine Would he come, unimpaired by old age or decline. Astir was all Scotland! from mountain and moor, With banner-folds streaming in air, Proud lord and retainer, the wealthy and poor, Thronged forth in their plaids to the fair; Steeds, pricked by their riders, loud clattering made, And, cheered by his clansmen, the bag-piper played. Gay lasses with snoods from the border and hills In holiday garb hurried thither, With eyes like the crystal of rock-shaded rills, And cheeks like the bells of the heather; But fairest of all, in that goodly array, Was the Lily of Bemerside, Margaret Gray. While Ayr with a gathering host overflowed, She marked with a look of delight A white-bearded horseman who gallantly rode On a mettlesome steed black as night, And cried, forcing wildly her way through the throng, âOh, master! thy pupil hath mourned for thee long!â Then, checking his courser, the brow of the seer Grew dark through his locks long and frosted, And making a sign with his hand to draw near, Thus the lovely offender accosted:â âBy which of thine eyes was thy master descried?â âWith my left I behold thee,â the damsel replied. One moment he gazed on the beautiful face, In fondness upturned to his own, As if anger at length to relenting gave place, Then fixed grew his visage like stone:â On the violet lid his cold finger he laid, And extinguished forever the sight of the maid. CAROLAN'S PROPHECY. [It is related of Carolan Twalogh, the Irish Handel, that in his gayest mood he could not compose a planxty on a Miss Brett, the daughter of a noble house in the County of Sligo. One day, after a vain attempt to compose something in honor of the young lady, in a mixture of rage and grief he threw his clÃ rsach aside, and, addressing her mother in Irish, whispered:ââMadam, I have often, from my great respect to your family, attempted a planxty to celebrate your daughter's perfections, but to no purpose. Some evil genius hovers over me; there is not a string in my discordant harp that does not vibrate a melancholy soundâI fear she is not long for this world.â Tradition says that the event verified the prediction. See sketch of Carolan in the Edinburgh Encyclopedia.] The castle hall is lightedâ Its roof with music rings, For Carolan is sweeping The clÃ rsach's quivering strings; And catching inspiration From faces fair around, His voice is richer far than gush Of instrumental sound. Of Erin's banner, green and bright, Of Tara's mighty kings, Who never to invader knelt, Exultingly he sings; And on the glittering sands that edge The blue and bellowing main, Beneath the blade of Bryan falls The yellow-bearded Dane. The master touches other chordsâ His brow is overcastâ And tears from his old, withered orbs Are falling warm and fast: In soul he looks on AthunrÃ©e, Disastrous field of gore! The glory of O'Conner's house Expires to wake no more. As died, in mournful echoings, The wond'rous strain away, Approving smile and word requite The minstrel for his lay; And by the hand of high-born maid The golden cup was filled, Commotion in a heart to hush By grief too wildly thrilled. When tuned to lighter airs of love His harp of magic tone, Quoth CarolanââWhat bard will not The sway of Beauty own? Kind hostess, I will now compose A planxty, promised long, In honor of thy daughter fair, Oh! matchless theme for song!â A few preluding notes he woke, So clear and passing sweet, That, timing to the melody, The heart of listener beat; But when the white-haired bard began His tributary lay, The soul of music from the strings Wild discord drove away. Thrice, with the same result, his hand Upon the chords he laidâ He turned the keys, but harsher sound The trembling clÃ rsach made: In honor of the mother, then, A planxty he composed, And perfect was the harmony Until the strain was closed. Then other ladies urged the bard To celebrate their charms, But he repliedââNo rapture now My fainting spirit warms; By shadows from another world My soul is clouded o'erâ Oh! would that I might never see The light of morning more!â âWhat gives a paleness to thy cheek, Meet only for the deadâ What sorrow weighs upon thy heart?â His noble hostess said: The minstrel whispered in replyâ âThe daughter of thy heart, Before the flowers of summer-time Are faded, will depart.â Ere morning dawned, old Carolan Went sadly on his way; To bid green Erin's Flower farewell He could not, would not stay; But sought, ere vanished many days, That lordly hall again, And through its gateway, moving slow, Defiled a funeral train. A BRUMAL RHYME. [âThere never was a truer rhyme. Let us cast nothing away, for we may live to have need of such a verse.â] Shakspeare. Crossing the dreary wold Speeds by a wild, weird formâ Below is the frozen mould, Above the blackening storm; And, hark! a chantâwhile the crinkling rime, And swaying, groaning boughs keep time. The flowers are in their gravesâ The leaves lie dead around, And the silver feet of waves Are motionless and bound: Not a bird flaps wing on the biting gale, And the gray oaks glitter in frosty mail. Over the wintry waste Of many a ruined soul Despair stalks onward, ice-encased, While above the black clouds roll, And muttersââPeace is a blighted thingâ Not a bird of joy is on the wing!â No beam of hope illumes The darkly-frowning skyâ In pale and frozen tombs The shapes of beauty lie, And founts where Pleasure quaffed of yore, Congealed to marble, flow no more. LITTLE BESS. [The subject of the following lines was born one bright day in the month of March. âThe color of our lives,â says Hazlitt, âis woven into the fatal thread at our births: our original sins and our redeeming graces are infused into us; nor is the bond that confirms our destiny, ever cancelled.â] Fitful gusts, o'ershadowed arch, And chill rains belong to March: But relaxed his visage sourâ Shot mild radiance from his eye, And his lip forgot to sigh When unclosed our youngest flower. No wood-nymph, with kirtle green, Tripping through the woods was seen; But the landscape's look forlorn To a golden smile gave place, Lighting up earth's darkened face, When my little Bess was born. Eight brief moons have waxed and waned Since our flock a fourth one gained In this fairy of a girl, With the lily's snow endowed, Showing, when she laughs aloud, Through rose-lips a gleam of pearl. Like a sunbeam breaking through Winter's pall of sable hueâ Or a moon-flash on the brine When the blast no longer raves Racing o'er its waste of waves, Camest thou, sweet daughter mine! Not a leaf the forest cheered, Scarce one grass-blade had appeared, But so lovely was the day That the squirrel of the ground Left his den with frolic bound, Thinking of the reign of May. Day of birth, so bright and warm, In a month of cloud and storm, Augurs that our little Bess Was in mercy sent to light Dreary sorrow's coming night With a ray of happiness. THE FORSAKEN. SUGGESTED BY A PICTURE. âDo any thing but love; Or if thou lovest, and art a woman, Hide thy love from him whom thou dost worship.â She was the scion of a gentle race, And wealth and beauty were her queenly dower; Her form was fashioned in the mould of grace, And many owned her love-inspiring power;â On one alone, with breast devoid of guile, The maiden flung the sunlight of her smile Perchance some daughter of a brighter clime Had fired his bosom with a quenchless flame; Suspicion hinted that a life of crime Was darkly ended by a death of shame; And Hope no longer, to her trusting heart, Could dreams of bliss and happiness impart. The maiden stood, in bridal robes arrayed, On a lone rock that overhung the wave; The breeze of evening with her ringlets played, And to her cheek a glow of beauty gave. She knew within her breast, convulsed with pain, That peace could never rear a shrine again. The thunder rolled along the vaulted sky, The murky cloud sent forth a pinion flashing,â The sea-bird blended its appalling cry With the wild music of the billow dashing,â But trembled not her finely moulded form While holding converse with the angry storm! Her hollow cheek had lost its rose-like red, A broken heart, she knew, could be healed never; Far down, where Ocean sepulchres his dead, She longed to still its fitful throbs forever, And wildly thought her long-lost mariner Would slumber sweetly side by side with her. At times she called upon her absent lover, But to her voice the winds and waves replied; She knew that pain and sorrow would be over By one wild plunge beneath the yeasty tide: Her funeral dirge the tempest-spirit sung,â Of death regardless, from the rock she sprung! WHISPERINGS OF CONSCIENCE. [âNo more on me will fall the hues of sunset or the shades of eveningâno more the sweet coolness of the twilight airâno more the vesper song of birds. Farewell, ye shady seats, and ye rich and hanging boughsâturf altars of the heart, and Druid groves of love! The dew of heaven and the breath of the fragrant earth may restore freshness to the flower, but they have no balm for the withered heart!â] There are times when, kindred meeting, Stern and gloomy I appear, And each fond and joyous greeting Falls unnoted on my ear. In their songs I find no sweetness, In their looks no sunshine warm, And I turn away with loathing From each fair and well-known form; For my thoughts, attuned to sadness, Dwell on dreams for ever flown, And I leave the hall of gladness For my chamber cold and lone! Ghosts of precious moments wasted Haunt the temple of my soul, And deep voices of upbraiding In mine ear alarum toll. Then I wildly think how altered Would have been my earthly lot If my foot had never faltered, If my heart had fainted not! If, when counsel most I needed, With my passions uncontrolled, Warning whispers had been heeded From loved lips now pale and cold. On the sea of life benighted, I have sought with careless oar Traitor-fires by evil lighted On the wreck-encumbered shore; And though ruin frowned before me, And my bark was torn and tossed, While the bitter surf washed o'er me, And black demons shouted âLOST!â Yet nor wind nor wave I minded, But, with Conscience hushed and scared, And an eye by Pleasure blinded, To Destruction's portal steered. Oh! I am to madness driven While the past I thus recall, Knowing that the wrath of heaven On the guilty head must fall! A VOICE FROM GLEN-MARY. Sweet Lady! when the glen I sought That bears, and long will bear thy name, Of thy sad history I thought, Forgetful of a brighter fame; The wild-bird singing in the tree, Each rustling leaflet spoke of thee. Thy cottage-home hath lost the light That gladdened it in other hours; Its vines are withered, and a blight Hath fallen on thy once-loved flowers; I crossed its threshold, and within There was a gloom to-night akin. Cold was the hearth, and on the wall Gray web-work had the spider hung, And solemn as a knell, the fall Of feet through each apartment rung: The south-wind sighed through open doors, Lifting the dust from unswept floors. The features of yon view remain; The waves flow on, the mountains rise; Dawn wakes, and twilight brings again Her gentle dews, and star-lit skies; But here no more will voice of thine Fill air with song at day's decline! Ah! nigh in soul perchance thou art, Though far away thy grave is green, For clung the tendrils of thy heart, While living, to this lovely scene: And slumbers here thy first-born child, Within a tomb undrest and wild. 'T is not unmeet that shade of one, So young and fair, through lawns like these Should wander, when the day is done, And burden with its plaint the breeze; Or visit at lone midnight's hour Glen-Mary's cot and wasted bower. MUSINGS. The fleeting hours, the fleeting hours, They pass like dreams awayâ Pale blight hangs on the nectar'd flowers That opened yesterdayâ The low wind like a mourner grieves While shaking down their faded leaves. Where is the laurelled son of Mars A nation greeted yester morn, The hero of an hundred wars On his proud charger borne? The tongue of chivalry is dumbâ The requiem was the muffled drum. Where is the young, bewitching belle Who dazzled yesterday the sight; Whose matchless beauty from his cell Might lure an anchorite? Where are her thrilling pulse and lute? The grave will answerâboth are mute! Where are the pale-browed heirs of thoughtâ The bardâthe oratorâthe sageâ Who yesterday a wide world taught, And dignified their age? Their great ambitious hearts are cold, And fellowship with dust they hold. Then ask me not for false renown To waste away the midnight oilâ Though grandeur and a gilded crown Are the rewards of toil: Pure jewels and the types of power, What are they in the dying hour? Or, rather urge me to forsake The vanities that here have birth, And, in the morn of being, break Base bonds that bind to earth, And bridge, while yet a thing of breath, With trusting hope the gulf of death. LAKE WYALUSING. [This lake lies in a circular basin, on the top of a thickly wooded mountain in Northern Pennsylvania. Nothing in water scenery surpasses it in features of the picturesque.] Joy like a wave o'erflowed my soul, While looking on its basin round, That fancy named a sparkling bowl By hoop of fadeless emerald bound, From which boon Nature's holy hand Baptized the nymphs of mountain land. It blushes in the morning's glow, And glitters in the sunset ray, When brooks that run far, far below Have murmured out farewell to day: The moonlight on its placid breast, When dark the valley, loves to rest. Wheeling in circles overhead, The feathered king a war-scream gave; His form, with pinion wide outspread Was traced so clearly on the wave, That seemingly its glass was stirred By flappings of the gallant bird. Nor far away were rocky shelves With the soft moss of ages lined, And seated there a row of elves By moonlight would the poet find: Fairies, from slumber in the shade Waking with soft-voiced serenade. The waters slept, by wind uncurled, Encircled by a zone of green: The reflex of some purer world Within their radiant blue was seenâ I felt, while musing on the shore, As if strong wings my soul upbore. Lake, flashing in the mountain's crown! Thought pictures thee some diamond brightâ That dawn had welcomedâfallen down From the starred canopy of night; Or chrysolite, by thunder rent From Heaven's eternal battlement. THE ROYAL PINE. Three cheers for the Pine, the Royal Pine, Throned high on the hill's green brow; While ranks of trees, in the rushing breeze, Below like vassals bow; When the hue of wine, at day's decline Bepaints the solemn west, A golden crown on his brow falls down, Though the vale in gloom is drest. With a heated brow, beneath his bough The red man oft hath lain, Worn out with toil, while his antler'd spoil On the velvet moss lay slain; And beneath his shade the Seneca maid Hath warbled her wood-land lay, While braiding flowers, and counting the hours That kept her chief away. When winter reigns, and the river chains With fetters chill and white, In the cold thin air, with branches bare, The tall oak pains the sight; But, on the hill thy banner still Flings out defiance high, Though no tint of green in the glen is seen, And the blast comes growling by. Long life to the Pine, the voiceful Pine, Who mourneth for the past, When the morning breeze sweeps his emerald keys, Or the fitful midnight blast; My thoughts, when I hear, in moonlight clear, His surge-like anthem rise, Are of seers of eld who, on hill-tops, held Communion with the skies. Three cheers for the Pine, the Royal Pine! Though lord of a region grim, The tempest loud, and the eagle proud Are friends who talk with him. May he lift his head, by well-springs fed, In sunshine and in shower, And his plumage green by the bard be seen While the gray old hills up-tower. MY OWN DARK GENESEE. They told me southern land could boast Charms richer than mine own: Sun, moon, and stars of brighter glow, And winds of gentler tone; And parting from each olden haunt, Familiar rock and tree, From that sweet vale I wandered farâ Washed by the Genesee. I pined beneath a foreign sky, Though birds, like harps in tune, Lulled Winter on a couch of flowers Clad in the garb of June. In vain on reefs of coral broke The glad waves of the sea; For, like thy voice they sounded not, My own dark Genesee! When Christmas came, though round me grew The lemon-tree and lime, And the warm sky above me threw The blue of summer-time; I thought of my loved northern home, And wished for wings to flee Where frost-bound, between frozen banks, Lay hushed the Genesee. For the gray, mossed paternal roof My throbbing bosom yearned, And ere the flight of many moons My steps I homeward turned; My heart, to joy a stranger long, Was tuned to rapture's key, When ear the murmur heard once more Of my own Genesee. Ambition from the scenes of youth May others lure away To chase the phantom of renown Throughout their little day; I would not, for a palace proud And slave of pliant knee, Forsake a cabin in thy vale, My own dark Genesee. LAY OF A WANDERER. A FLORIDIAN SCENE. Where Pablo to the broad St. John His dark and briny tribute pays, The wild deer leads her dappled fawn Of graceful limb and timid gaze; Rich sunshine falls on wave and land, The gull is screaming overhead, And on a beach of whitened sand Lie wreathy shells with lips of red. The jessamine hangs golden flowers On ancient oaks in moss arrayed, And proudly the palmetto towers, While mock-birds warble in the shade; Mounds, built by mortal hand, are near, Green from the summit to the base, Where, buried with the bow and spear, Rest tribes forgetful of the chase. Cassada, An old Spanish fort. nigh the ocean shore, Is now a ruin wild and lone, And on her battlements no more Is banner waved or trumpet blown; Those doughty cavaliers are gone Who hurled defiance there to France, While the bright waters of St. John Reflected flash of sword and lance. But when the light of dying day Falls on the crumbling wrecks of time, And the wan features of decay Wear softened beauty like the clime, My fancy summons from the shroud The knights of old Castile again, And charging thousands shout aloudâ âSt. Jago strikes to-day for Spain!â When mystic voices, on the breeze That fans the ruling deep, sweep by, The spirits of the Yemassees, Who ruled the land of yore, seem nigh; For mournful marks, around where stood Their palm-roofed lodges, yet are seen, And in the shadows of the wood Their monumental mounds are green. TO MY WIFE. Mother of my children! listen While the moon above is bright, And the starry watchers glistenâ Jewels on the brow of night. Thou hast waited, pale and lonely, For my coming, late and long. Oh! mine own thou artâmine onlyâ And the muse that prompts my song. In my dreams angelic faces Look on me, though far away; Happy smiles and infant graces Round soft lips and dimples play: And my little flock they gather Closely round my vacant chair, With a yearning wish that father Would come back their sports to share. On the bosom of her mother, Like a rose-bud, Florence lies, Looking at her little brother, With his large, blue, sparkling eyes: Near, some book of story reading, Sits my daughter, eldest-born, And blithe Charlie by is speeding With a laughing look like morn. Oh! how fragile and uncertain Were the hopes that once were ours, But beyond life's sunset curtain We will find unfading flowers. Till that closing hour, together We will wander hand in hand, And, though fair or foul the weather, Live and love, by sea and land. While I know for me that nightly Lifted is thy voice in prayer, Beats my laboring heart more lightly, And the landscape looks more fair: Pray that I may soon caress thee, While affection's accents flow, Once more to my bosom press thee, And celestial rapture know. DANDELIONS. Dandelions of the velvet lawn, Golden brooches on the plaid of May; Living tints of beauty ye have drawn From the noontide of some cloudless day! A prolific sisterhood are ye, Blooming in the common paths we tread, Giving lustre to the grassy lea, Growing on the green mounds of the dead. Tulips nod on longer, fairer stems; Blue-bells swing more gracefully in air, Roses boast far richer diademsâ Gayer dress the jewelled lilacs wear. Wherefore then so dear are ye to one Finding sweet romance no more in life, Struggling on beneath a clouded sun, Daily covered with the dust of strife? Drinking gladness from the gentle rain, Looking upward to yon concave blueâ Faded chaplets ye recall again, Worn by May-time when my years were few: When I plucked ye in my rural walks, While the ground-bird framed her nest and sung; Piping gayly on the hollow stalks, Changing them to ringlets with my tongue. When ye graced with yellow dots no more Pastures old, through which I loved to stray, Filmy globes of silver that ye bore, With a breath I used to blow away. Emblems were they of delusive schemes Wildly shaped in boyhood by my brain, Passing joys, and evanescent dreams, Perished, never to revive again. Some at rest beneath the turf of spring, Dear to me in those enchanted hours, Back with looks they wore in life, ye bring; Back with shouts, and laughter wild, ye flowers! THE MORNING STAR OF ANNESLEY. Byron's name for Mary Chaworth. [âThe chamber, like all the other parts of the house, had a look of sadness and neglect; the flower-pots under the window, which once bloomed beneath the hand of Mary Chaworth, were overrun with weeds; and the piano which had once vibrated to her touch, and thrilled the heart of her stripling lover, was now unstrung and out of tune.â]â Irving. With pale, high brow Childe Harold oft To this neglected chamber came, And heard, in accents low and soft, His first love syllable his name. Beneath yon window, pots of flowers Untended give their sweets to air, That well repaid, in former hours, With blush and fragrancy her care. Yon instrument, unstrung and still, Will chime no more with warbled words; Her hand hath lost the witching skill To wake its passion-breathing chords. Where gifted Harold stood, I stand, And view bright walks extending wide, Where oft he wandered, hand-in-hand, With her who should have been his bride. And eloquence that hath no tongue, Is breathing from yon antique wall, For often hath it sweetly rung With her light step and gleesome call. The Poet-Lord of Newstead here Drank love undying from her gazeâ Love that, in many an after year, Gave mournful sweetness to his lays. Where are they now?âthe bard is tost No longer on a stormy sea; And death conceals, in hall of frost, His âMorning Star of Annesley.â A POET'S WISH. Mine be a pretty country lass, With soft transparency of cheek, Through which, like red wine in a glass, The blushes eloquently speak Of charms that will outlive the rose Worn proudly by the city belle, When, full of vanity, she throws Round burning hearts her spell. Mine be the company of books, And one fair girl to read my lay; A smiling cot that overlooks Some lone lake stretching far away, Whereon my boat, with sail of white, At times can wander from the strand, While glad waves in a song unite With low winds from the land. To gird my dwelling I would spare Old giants of the forest dim, For I am one who cannot bear The prostrate trunk and cloven limb; In hunting vesture I would brace My sinews on the hills at morn; The red fox or the roe-buck chase With hound and mellow horn. When Glory lights her dazzling torch, Peace vainly mourns her perished dove; The breathings of ambition scorch The flowers of innocence and love. Let others mix in worldly strife, Self-wasting meteors to shine; The calm, sequestered walks of life, Unvexed by storm, be mine! THAT OLD SONG. Sing on! I love that olden lay, Though mournful are the notes and wild, It drives the haunting fiend awayâ It thrilled me when a child. Long buried gold the past revealsâ Charmed by the magic of that strain, My weary heart refreshment feels, And I am young again. Sing on! the land of shadows now Hath raised its curtain dark and dim, Back comes my sire with furrowed brow, That smile belongs to him. Each old, familiar word invokes The phantoms of the pictured past, And sighing through ancestral oaks, I hear the midnight blast. Sing on! for, borne on music's tide, My soul floats back to other daysâ From dust rise up the true and tried To greet my yearning gaze: And she, meek violet that grew In rosy boyhood's Eden lost, Springs up as if her eye of blue Had never known the frost. Sing on! sing on, entranced I hear, While bloom once more earth's perished flowers;â A mother warbled in mine ear That song in other hours; And when the sad refrain is breathed, Her gentle spirit hovers nighâ Fond arms are round the wanderer wreathed, Kind voices make reply. THE DOOMED ONE. There is on that sweet young face A dread but dazzling whiteness, And in that eye of love I trace A wild, unearthly brightness. By faithless man betrayed, The world seems dark before thee, And soon, in hall of silence laid, Will the green turf blossom o'er thee. Thy voice is sadder now Than the wind-harp's wail at even, And victim of a broken vow, Thine only hope is heaven. Nor mineral of earth, Nor balm of leaf or blossom Can tune again to throb of mirth The chords of thy torn bosom. Old songs, the precious keys To memory's golden treasures, Have lost their magic power to please, Though sang to touching measures. By friendly lip in vain Is soothing language spoken, For ruined is the fine-wrought brain, And thine o'er-tasked heart is broken. Thy darkest doom, oh earth! For that cold, base deceiver, Who calls the star of affection forth, Then dims its light foreverâ And when the mortal goal He reaches unforgiven, For aye may his polluted soul Feel the withering curse of heaven. FOREST CAROL. I breathe more free and deep With my foot on the forest-ground, When winds awake from sleep The huge, old Titans round: I love the organ's peal In fanes upreared by artâ But nearer God I feel In the green-wood's leafy heart. To every bush a tongue Is given by the breeze, And a thousand harps seem hung High on the mossy trees:â From oak, and elm, and pine, Comes whispering a voice, SayingââThine ear incline, Sad poet, and rejoice!â The cloud forsakes my brow, And grief's wild throb my soul, While murmuring leaf and bough Mock ocean's distant roll; True time my pulses beat To notes of joy and love, With moss beneath my feet, And the swinging boughs above. The shade of woods I seek, When tired of strife with menâ Old voices comfort speak In thicket, glade and glen; I love the organ's peal In fanes upreared by artâ But nearer God I feel In the green-wood's leafy heart. MY STUDY. I love the circuit of thy narrow bounds While my pale lamp gives light, And, unattended by tumultuous sounds, Presides the holy night. A quiet nook for reverie thou art In the dim hour of shade, When that wild, wondrous instrument, the heart, Is lulled and tranquil made. My booksâold friends that know not frigid changeâ When come the evil days, Unfold their lettered treasures, rich and strange, To my enamored gaze. While folly wastes, in lust and midnight wine, Manhood and moral health, True wisdom seeketh jewels in the mine Of intellectual wealth. Haunt sacred to retirement and to thought! At midnight deep and lone, Within thy hallowed precincts I have caught Gleams of that world unknown, Where the soul harbors when this life is o'er, And closed our war with time, And the hushed belfry of the heart no more Rings with a numbered chime. THE DESERTED HALL. Suggested by a moon-lit view of a mansion in ruins upon the Susquehanna, at Owego. To a mortal heart how humbling Is a view of yon old hall, Into dust and darkness crumbling, While rude winds shake roof and wall. Moss is round the casement spreading, And no more the windows blaze When the weary day is shedding His last red and quivering rays. Under the neglected arbor Foxes in the night-time bark, And the bat and spider harbor In its chambers drear and dark. Weeds, about the door-stone growing, Whisper of decay and blightâ On the hearth no ember glowing Sheds a warm and cheerful light. Near the ruin is a river, And the waves while flowing on, From their lips of crystal, ever Breathe that word of mourningâGONE! Round the place old poplars cluster, And the leaves give out strange tones When the moon flings pallid lustre On the roof and basement stones. Saddened and deserted dwelling! Of a wronged and broken heart, While the dirge of hope is knelling, Oh! a mournful type thou art! Flowers of love, untimely perished, In its barren realm lie waste, Like thy garden-grounds once cherished By the moulding hand of taste. Creatures that haunt places lonely In thy empty halls are bred, And that HEART is peopled only By the shadows of the dead. As yon moon, with look subduing, Lights the home of days gone by, In that heartâa nobler ruinâ Sadly glimmers memory. TO AN INEBRIATE. The price of kingdoms was the pearl A queen dissolved in wine, But thou art wasting in the cup A gem of ray divine. The deed of Egypt's daughter proud Is foolish styled alone, But thou art perpetrating crime That fiends should blush to own. God's glorious giftâthe deathless soul, Is lightly held by thee; The brand of SLAVE is on thy brow, Poor wretch! misnomer'd FREE. Oh! wake thee from thy trance of sin, And knock at mercy's doorâ Dash down! dash down that hell-drugged bowl And be a man once more. FIR-CROFT. Sweet Fir-Croft! nestling at the feet Of uplands ever green, When high the pulse of summer beat, Before me spread thy scene. Pines on the hill, like watchmen placed Thy fields below to guard, The background of a picture graced That chained the glance of bard. The deep-voiced Susquehanna through The country-seat F. H. Pumpelly, Esq., upon the bank of the Susquehanna. The foreground swiftly rolled, And sunlight on his bosom threw A flood of molten gold; A river of more varied charms Wild wind hath never swept, And in his bright, embracing arms Full many an islet slept. I looked upon thy fountain bright That round a coolness flung, And fancied that each beam of light With radiant pearl was strung. Brooks, welling forth from rocks up-piled, Woke echoes on their way, As if a thousand naiads wild Were racing through the spray. My blessing, Fir-Croft, on thee rest, And on thy worthy lord! May sorrow ne'er within his breast Awake one jarring chord! The dust of earth's great battle-ground Dims not thy landscape fair, And in thy quiet shades I found A spell to conquer care The wood-paths up thy mountain-side That led to quiet bowersâ Thy meadows, laughing in a wide Embroidery of flowersâ Thy rushing and romantic streamsâ Each glenâeach fairy knollâ Will oft be visible in dreams To bathe in bliss my soul. A CHARADE. My First is often heard By the lip of children spoken, And we murmur out the word When earth's dearest tie is broken. My Second gives delight To the desert pilgrim jaded, In isles of verdure bright, By the graceful palm o'ershaded. My Whole to memory brings One in the kirk-yard lying, Whose wild and wailing strings Woke melody undying: A bard whose tender strain The snooded maiden treasures, While Norse-kings live again In his more heroic measures THE IRISH MOTHER. âThey shall hunger no more.ââ Revelation, vii. 16. I heard the lament of a poor Irish mother, As watch by the forms of the famished she kept; The wan, wasted features of sister and brother Were bathed by the drops she had uselessly wept: Oh! sweet was her lay for the burden it boreâ âThey shall hunger no more.â While winter's rude wind through each cranny was sighing, The last blackened crumb to my first-born I gave; I opened my veins when my youngest was dying, Aroused by a mother's wild instinct to saveâ The lips of my darling are wet with the goreâ She will hunger no more. Food flung by the fox-hunting lords of this nation, With prodigal hand, to their hounds, would subdue In many a hovel the pangs of starvation, And thankfulness waken that pomp never knew: Poor babes! I regret not that anguish is o'erâ Ye will hunger no more. While famine the flesh on their bones was consuming, It crazed me to hear their low moans night and dayâ No brand on the desolate hearth-stone illuming Their couches of cold, musty straw with its ray; Now calmly they rest, side by side, on the floorâ âThey shall hunger no more.â Oh! dark is the cloud that impends over Britain! The wrongs of the wretched make barren her soil: That country with curses should ever be smitten Where perishing Want is forbidden to toilâ Where Hunger kills more than disease or the sword, And white handed Sloth finds a plentiful board. EVERGREENS. Come to the House of Prayer, Where willing knees to Providence are bowed, For earth is mantled in a snowy shroud, And seems no longer fair; And though we cannot view The violet peeping from the velvet sod, Maidens have decked the holy House of God With wreaths of emerald hue Sin-smitten mortals, come! The green festoons that do the walls adornâ Fresh as when watered by the dews of mornâ Are eloquent, though dumb; For the leaf-laden bough That Winter fades not with his frosty breath, Is like the spirit, living on when death Touches with ice the brow. Come to the House of Prayer, Poor human toilers in this world of strifeâ Gaze on those emblems of eternal life, And learn a lesson there; For those green garlands tell The dying Christian of a brighter shore, Where blinding tears will dim the eye no more, And shapes Angelic dwell. THE WARNING. [âThe spirit of an ancient ancestor of the McLeans of Lochbury is heard to gallop along a stony bank, and then to ride thrice around the family residence ringing his fairy bridle, and thus intimating approaching calamity.â]â Walter Scott. The plaided Chief, with dog and gun Strode forth from his castle old When the first bright beams of the morning sun Crowned the far-off hills with gold. Through mist that wrapt the mountain-side He tracked his dangerous way, The red-deer, king of a desert wide! In his heathery lair to slay; But he came not back to his blushing bride, At the clouded close of day. When heavy night began to lower, And western skies were dim, She looked abroad from the highest tower, With an earnest gaze for him: Dishevelled was her golden hair, Her visage wan of hue, And listened long that lady fair For short or shrill hallooâ But no sound came on the wafting air, And the darkness deeper grew. âWhy comes he not? why, comes he not?â The weary watcher said; Then started back,âfor the night-wind brought A barb's impatient tread; She knew by the ring of the bridle-rein, And a wailing sad and low, That the soul of a famous chieftain slain In battle long ago, From the âSilent Landâ had been called again, A messenger of woe. Fear, bloodless fear, a hand of ice Did on the lady lay, For no mortal horseman galloped thrice Around the castle gray; And a horrid thrill through her bosom ran While the blast this warning boreâ âMourn! for the hounds of a hostile clan Have drunk their fill of gore.â Back to his home, a living man, McLean returned no more. AN AUTUMN THOUGHT. Like the depths of the wood when October is cold, By the sting of the frost turned to purple and gold, Are the virtues of heart, sad and tender, that owe All their beauty and brightness to sorrow and woe. Like the pine on the mountain unchanged by the frost, When the beech-tree and maple their verdure have lost, Is the heart of a friend that is steadfast and true When the tears of misfortune our pathway bedew. WHEN THE WILD LOVE OF FAME. When the wild love of fame, with its anguish and fever, No more in my soul kindles withering fire, And this sensitive bosom is pulseless for ever, And wrapped are my limbs in their funeral attire, Bear not my pale relics where thousands are sleeping In clustering graves near the populous martâ Where the dew-fall of eve the dark cypress is steeping, And stones rise in pomp, hewn and polished by art. Oh! bear my cold corse to the brow of the mountain, Where cedar and pine groves may over me waveâ Where the day-god may fling from his luminous fountain A blushing farewell, when he sets, on my grave;â Where the scream of the panther, while darkness is reigning, And the long, mournful howl of the wolf may be heard, And night summon forth, while the sad moon is waning, From oak-hollowed dwelling her anchorite bird A tomb by the deer and the war-eagle haunted Is meet for a lone one who hateth the crowd;â A tomb where a dirge for the dead will be chanted When lightnings flash death and the thunder is loud. Some friend, from the heat of the stag-chase reposing, While his indolent hounds flap their ears in the shade, By the mossed rock of granite rude letters disclosing, Will know the wild spot where the minstrel is laid.
