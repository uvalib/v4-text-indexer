      <field name="fulltext">THE FLOWERS OF LIFE. The ills of Life's journey how many complain of, Who swear not a flow'ret is found in the road! But the evils they censure I laugh at the pain of, While sweet smiling Cheerfulness lightens the load. Though I find not a rose, I indulge not in sorrow, But pluck with Contentment a daisy to-day; Nay, even a sprig will feed Hope for the morrow, The humblest that nods to the zephyr of May. Let others dispute, I'll avoid their dissention, Religious, political, moral, or such; For the lily of Peace thus escapes their attention, And the sweet bud of Pleasure which blooms at my touch. The blossom of Friendship, surviving mortality, I'll carefully cherish and wear in my breast; Though its picture may boast brighter hues than reality, Its fragrance directs me when doubtful the test. The spirit of feeling, the soul of affection, Wildly ardent in rapture, and melting in wo, Whatever its image, attire, or complexion, With mine shall commingle in sympathy's glow. I ask not his birth-place, whatever the region, Hot, temperate, frigidâdespotic or free; I ask not his politics, creed or religion, A Turk, Jew, or Christianâhe's still dear to me. But ah! there's a flower which, tho' teeming with nectar. Beneath its fair aspect screen's Misery's dart, So artfully veil'd that it mocks a detecter, Till press'd to the bosom it pierces the heart. But still to a bosom susceptibly placid, The anguish of Love will but heighten its joy; As the bev'rage uniting a sweet with an acid Is grateful, when nectar untemper'd would cloy. The bramble of Avarice others may nourish, Exhausting Life's soil of its virtues and strength; I'll stray where the plants of Beneficence flourish, And the generous vine winds its serpentine length. Let misers pursue their mean sordid employment, And hoard up their treasures for life's latest scenes: I'll waste not the moments allow'd for enjoyment, Nor squander the season in gaining the means. Our object is happinessâne'er could we miss it, In life's varied path, if the talent were ours From all we encounter some good to elicit, As bees gather sweets from the meanest of flowers. Then pluck every blossom of Happiness blooming; Leave birds of contention and play with the dove; And our path, soon the flush of enchantment assuming, Will glow an Elysium of Pleasure and Love. THE JOURNEY OF LOVE. Now Anteros lend me thy gossamer pinion, And teach me the speed of Armata's sweet dove, I fly to the seat of thy blissful dominion, For Catharine's breast is the mansion of love. No longer shall Fortune be whelm'd with invective, If my journey the goddess but bless with her smile; I heed not its length, while I view in perspective The sharer, rewarder, and end of my toil. If love has its sorrows, yet, who would refuse 'em, So sweeten'd with rapture, so mingled with joy? What mortal the rose would discard from his bosom, Lest the thorn which attends it should chance to annoy? Separation was suchâbut the wound it inflicted Will soon be forgot in the glow of a kiss; Though grief on the visage has oft been depicted, The tear shall soon glisten a tribute of bliss. Ah! still on my vision the object increases! The cottage of peace and affection I spy! Hope smiles, as my bosom, unconscious, releases The murmur of wishes respired in a sigh. Now, now am I blest!âBut, ah! language it fails me, No pencil can paint love's ecstatic alarms: 'Tis she that approachesâ'tis Catharine hails me, She gazes! she smiles!âI am press'd in her arms! THE ROSE-BUD. The Hartford Rose-budâaddressed to Miss M. S??????d. On the banks of Connecticut's proud winding stream, I pensively wander'd, a stranger, unknown; As the hill-tops around caught the sun's parting beam, And eve's sable vest o'er the valleys was thrown. A blushing young Rose-bud attracted mine eye, Half opened, its bosom perfumed the soft air, As it bow'd in response to the zephyr's sweet sigh, And a new-fallen dew-drop was glittering there. As I tasted its fragrance, I spoke to the flower, âO flourish, sweet bud! in my bosom,â I cried; âThy beauties will solace life's turbulent hour, âGrief loses its gall, when to sweetness allied.â I said, and had pluck'd it, to bloom in my breast, That breast stung by anguish and torn by despair! But my hand was restrain'd, and my bosom address'dâ My heart caught the whisperââO pilgrim, forbear!â âTaste, taste of its sweetness, but mar not the flower, âO stranger! a wanderer still thou must roam;â âOnce torn from its stalk, it will bloom but an hour; âThen leave it, O pilgrim! 'twill flourish at home. âBut, ah! if transplanted, a bosom of wo âWill chill the fair bud, in a far-distant clime, âA soil deep envelop'd in winter's cold snow, âWill cause the young stranger to droop in its prime.â I obey'dâbut my eye dropp'd a tear on the roseâ That rose, lovely girl! is an emblem of you; But driven from joys, I submit to my woes, And think of your name as I bid them adieu! THE PILGRIM, To his fair fellow-traveller from Brookfield to Hartford. The Pilgrimâaddressed to Miss Mary H?????????gh. You saw, dear Mary, or you might have seen, How the poor steeds that whirl'd us down from B? Were lash'd and urged along, with slackened rein, Or check'd and shorten'd when they ran too free. So I, my girl, though (Heaven be praised) no horse, Am sometimes lash'd and sometimes curb'd by Fate; Now hurried forward with resistless force, Now check'd, and forced against my will to wait. I fondly hoped to pass my days at home, And only tread my native rural plains; But Fate forbade, and I am doom'd to roam, Gall'd by her whip, and straightened with her reins. I gain'd an inn, that promis'd food and rest, For Joy and Peace were pictured on the sign; I saw the turtle settling in her nest, And thought such happiness might soon be mine. Vain, foolish thought! for crack went madam's lash, And I was driven from the loved abode; O'er bog and moor, through thick and thin to dash, Without e'en hope to cheer me on the road. And now, though fostered by your generous care, Blest with your smiles, and friendship's tenderest tie, Yet, Jehu-like, she drives me to despairâ Adieu, dear girl! for I again must fly. TO MARY, On hearing her sing the air, from Blue Beard, of âWhen pensive I thought on my love.â When torn from the arms of her swain, In circles of splendour to move, Sweet Fatima thus would complain, As pensive she thought on her love. A palace for her had no charms, Unshared by the youth she adored; But press'd in her lov'd Selim's arms, A cottage true bliss could afford. Then should fickle Fortune ordain, Your Selim from hence to remove, Will you, while you warble that strain, Bestow a fond thought on your love? Some seraph will waft me the sound, And whisper the joy to my heart; Though absence must cruelly wound, I'll listen, forgetting its smart. Then grant that such joy I may find, Should fate ever tear me from thee; For me let the strain be design'dâ Be Fatima only to me. TIME, The Physician of Disappointed Love. Venus in her car descended, Drawn by little harmless doves, Sportive graces round attended, With a smiling band of loves. Roses in a chaplet crown'd her, And she chose her flowery seat Where the songsters warbled round herâ Hudson's billows kiss'd her feet. There I saw the queen of beauty, Fondling Cupid in her arms, And approach'd to pay my duty, Ravish'd with her glowing charms. âGoddess, famed in ancient legendsââ I exclaim'dâin posture lowâ âQueen of love's celestial regions, âWelcome to the realms below! âI am told, the glance which captures, âSprings alone from power of thine; âGive me, then, love's burning raptures, âTeach me loveâand bliss is mine.â Venus smil'd at my petition, Gave the urchin's dart a kiss, Who exclaim'd, âmama's permission âGives you now the promised bliss. âHere's the means, and skill'd to use 'em, âI but seldom miss the heartââ Then within my throbbing bosom Quick I felt the trembling dart. How my glowing pulses bounded! Like our sire, ere known to sin, 'Twas elysium that surrounded, Joy and paradise within. Hope, within her fragrant bowers, Led me with a smile more sweet Than the odoriferous flowers Gaily blooming round our feet. âYes,â I cried, âI thank thee, Venus, âHope and bliss will ne'er departââ When a demon sprang between us, With a frown that froze the heart. Hope beheld, and fled affrighted, While the fiend's disastrous breath Blasted all that had delighted, Flowers and choristers, in death. 'Twas the fiend of Disappointmentâ How his touch my bosom chill'd, Poison'd Hope's balsamic ointment, And my wound with anguish fill'd. âQueen of beauty, treacherous Venus, âSave me from a fate like this; âJove himself may judge between us, âPain is all thy promised bliss.â âMortal! ever discontented, âYour unjust reproaches spare; âIs your wish so soon repented? âWell, again I grant your prayer. âYon decrepit sage will heal you, âWhose approach appears so slow; âLet his icy fingers feel you, âAnd you must forget your wo.â Time approach'd his aid to proffer, But I shrunk from his relief; Hugg'd my painârefused his offer, For I found a joy in grief. Lives there one, who loves sincerely, Willing to forget the flame? Noâ'tis dissolution, nearly, Nature will assert her claim. NEW-YEAR ADDRESS, Written for the Carrier of a Weekly Paper entitled The WarâJanuary 1, 1813. Patrons! scowling Winter wages O'er our realms his stormy war; Back'd by Northern Powers, he rages, Scattering tempests round his car. None can stem his rude invasion, All must to the Tyrant yield; Spring, alone, with soft persuasion, Can compel him from the field. Yet, amid the frowns of winter, Beams one lucid ray of joyâ While it animates your Printer, Bid it cheer the Printer's Boy. He'll not boast of rigid duty, Nor complain his task is hard, While the smile of Wealth and Beauty All his services reward. 'Tis the height of his ambition, (Laudable in age or youth) That he claims the great commission Of a Messenger of Truth. Free from useless party squabbles, Is the humble sheet he brings, Unadorn'd by fiction's baubles, Save when patriot Fancy sings. Clio, o'er the press presiding, From her minute-book selects, Truth from falsehood still dividing, This she copiesâthat rejects. Thus prepares a faithful history, Perfect in each line and page, Unobscured by doubt or mystery, To inform a future age. Thus, exempt from faction's demon, He has yet another boast, That he serves a race of Freemen, With what Freemen value most. Now accept his gratulations, That the New-Year's glad return Finds us still the first of nations, Where the flame of freedom burns, Health, the richest earthly blessing, Wantons in the gelid gale; Plenty, every board is dressing; Genius and the Arts prevail. Peace, alone, on ruffled pinion, Flies from Freedom's injured realm; War extends his rough dominion, Vengeance nodding on his helm. Harshly sounds the trumpet's clamour, While our warriors leap to arms; Beauty shrinks in fearful tremour, Snatching graces from alarms. Harsh to us the martial clarion Who with Peace and Freedom blest, Bade the desert, drear and barren, Smile a garden in the West. Harsh to us, whose fair pretensions Ne'er infringed a nation's right, Who have tamely borne aggressions, Rather than engage in fight. But at length, indignant Justice, Bares her sabre's spotless blade, Swears by Him in whom our trust is, Every wrong shall be repaid. Now the horrid fray commences, Bella goads the steeds of war, Death on every side dispenses, Spreading ruin round her car. Hark! the tempest louder rages! See! the Savage joins the strife, With a hellish yell engages, Arm'd with hatchet, fire, and knife! Age, nor sex, is now respected, Infant, mother, hoary sire, By the ruthless knife dissected, Or in flaming cots, expire! Can the foeman, famed for honour, Britain, famed for social arts, Can she brook this stain upon her, Deeds at which a freeman starts! Form with tigers an alliance! League with prowling beasts of prey! Set religion at defiance! Fright humanity away! Oh! a day of retribution, Haughty Britain! is at hand, When the amplest restitution, Freemen's thunder shall command. Now, already, on that ocean She would rule with walls of oak, Where her murderers gain promotion, She has groan'd beneath our stroke. There her haughty hopes are crumbled, At our Eagle's flashing eye George's cross is quickly humbledâ Not a streamer floats on high. How they start, aghast with wonder, That a rival dare advance, Tempting Britain's awful thunder, Which so oft has crippled France. But at length they have discovered We can surer vengeance urge, Till their ships with carnage covered, Float in wrecks upon the surge. Hull advancedâillusion faded, And the Guerriere, streaming blood, Blushing for her flag degraded, Shrunk beneath the crimson'd flood. Jones, the next in naval story, Eager in the brilliant course, Pluck'd a sprig from British gloryâ Conquer'd with inferior force. Next, Decaturâhow the muses Love to dwell upon his name! Next, Decatur nobly chooses British arrogance to tame. Once his sabre's blade reflected Lightnings from the Barbary shore; More than once that blade directed Freedom's fire against the Moor. Now a nobler contest offers, Brighter ardour fires his soulâ He the dreadful meeting proffers, Where the western billows roll. Short, but bloody, was the battleâ Iron thunders shake the Mainâ Leaden hail-stones thickly rattle, Dimpling all the watery plain. Soon the crippled foe surrenders; Neptune sees the flag descend, And, amaz'd, his Trident tenders To Decatur, Freedom's friend. Now Columbia's Eagle hovers Where Britannia's streamers play'd, There the patriot eye discovers British injuries repaid. Entering now this great Emporium, Grateful to our gladden'd eyes, See, the British Macedonian Enters here, Decatur's prize! Patrons! when the British Lion Prowl'd the plains where Freedom smil'd, 'Twas a giant, cased in iron, Struggling with a little child. Even then, the cause of truth, Innocence, and right, were wonâ Now, in all the pride of youth, Shall we now the contest shun? No! the power of Britain ceases, Base corruption blunts her sword, Daily Freedom's power increases, Sailors' rights shall be restored. All the gloomy clouds that hover O'er the cheerless Western plain, Shall Atlantic billows cover, Ocean wash out every stain. Be our Navy once completed, Mann'd by Freedom's gallant tars, Foes will find their hopes defeated, And respect Columbia's stars. Patrons! may each earthly blessing, Crown'd with honourable Peaceâ Each enjoyment worth possessing, Be your own till life shall cease. May no disappointing barrier E'er your honest hopes oppose, So sincerely prays your Carrier, Such the grateful wish he owes. A NEWS-CARRIER'S ADDRESS, Presented to his Patrons on New-Year morning, 1816. Dear patrons! last night, as the ev'ning expired, One-thousand-eight-hundred-and-fifteen retired; A New Year succeeded, his banner unfurl'd, And day-light beheld him encircle the world. Now, sanction'd by custom, again we appear, To wish our kind patrons a Happy New Year: And begâthat our numbers with patience be heard, A grateful effusion for favours conferred: For, cheer'd by your patronage, bounty and smiles, The vigilant Carrier is pleas'd in his toils; And cannot refrain, on each new-coming year, To whisper his wishesâhis thanks, in your ear. It is usual, we know, for each New-Year's Address That annually flows from a Newspaper press, To furnish a record of incidents past, And hail the new year with remarks on the last. But custom can never bind people of sense, So, for once, if you please, we'll with this one dispense; While we point you to prospects which open in view, And just hint at the past in a couplet or two. When last we address'd you, the clamour of arms Still spread round our borders incessant alarms; While the rough eastern breeze daily blew to our coast, Additional aid to the red-coated host. But armies, nor navies, nor engines of fate, Could dampen our hopes, nor our courage abate; We rose as we felt every pressure increase, Determined to conquerâan hon'rable peace. The blood of our forefathers cried from their gravesâ âWe died for your freedomâSons! scorn to be slaves! âThe blessings we gave you, resolve to maintainâ âA RIGHT once relinquish'd, you'll never regain. âWhat tho' you contend for your dearly-bought rights, âWith tyrants and wretches whom carnage delights; âWhose haughty ambition lays claim to the sea, âAnd wars but with those who have souls to be free: âWhat tho' some disasters have darkened the scene, âAnd demons of faction in council convene; âWho openly threaten your cause to oppose, âEmbarrass your rulers, and side with your foes: âYet, who droops at misfortuneâdesponds at defeat, âOr shrinks at disaster, though seven times beat, âWhose ardour can falter, whose purpose can pause, âDistrusts either Heaven, himself, or his cause. âYour infantile NAVY, on ocean and lake, âHas prompted your pÃ¦ans of triumph to wake; âAnd the halo of glory which circles each head, âShall yet to the brows of your army be spread. âTo the field, then, with ardourâon Heaven rely, âThe tempest of war on invaders let fly; âThe breasts of true freemen a rampart can form, âThat tyrants will find it destruction to storm.â We heardâand the plough in the furrow was staid, Each art was relinquish'd for musket and spade; The pipe of the swain in the valley was still, While the bugle rung loud from each fortified hill. The cause of humanity, freedom and truth, Enkindled a flame in the breast of each youth, Which, fann'd by the air that our freemen respire, Soon burst on the foe in a deluge of fire. It kindles! it spreads! as approaches the stormâ And pulses long frigid beat rapid and warm; The dim eye of age former lustre resumes, And snow-circled temples bear helmet and plumes. The ardour increasesâbright flashes the fire, Our foes, in amazement, behold it aspire; View armies assemble, inspir'd by its glow, And feel the just vengeance it prompts to bestow. They felt it at Chippewa, Bridgewater, York, And at Plattsburgh received Yankee pay for their work, Where untutor'd freemen forc'd vet'rans to yield, Or shun their destruction by flying the field. They felt it at Orleans, where Jackson's bright sword Directed the deluge of death which we poured; The conquerors of France, by their rashness involv'd, Saw the cataract burst, and their legions dissolv'd. They felt it, whenever in contact we came, With arms, ammunition, and numbers the same; And never have freemen deserted the plain, Till numbers have rendered their bravery vain. They felt itâand lo! the delusion was gone, Proud Britain relinquish'd her Sine qua non; Acknowledg'd our prowessâthe contest gave o'er, And the olive was twined with the laurels we wore. The turban'd Barbarians next we chastise, Astounding their Deys and their Knights with surprise: Decatur, like CÃ¦sar, makes summary work; To a broadside or two strikes the turbulent Turk. In battle-array, then, our squadron appears, Under valiant Decatur, in front of Algiers; Who dictates a peace on his own quarter-deck, Where the Dey has to sign it, or forfeit his neck. Now Commerce revives, and her hundred wheels roll, Our canvas is spread from equator to pole; Antipodes gaze on our banner unfurl'd, For the course of our eagle shall girdle the world. The genius of plenty her office resumes, The treasures of IndiaâArabia's perfumes, With each gem and each fruit that the world can produce, Her horn pours around for our pleasure or use. The boundaries of Neptune's tempestuous domain, Our spirit of enterprise shall not restrain; Nor forests retard it, nor mountains affright, For Hudson and Erie their waves shall unite. The Arts shall increase and refinement extend, New graces to beauty shall piety lend; The demon of selfishness shrink to his hole, And the form of each action have USE for its soul. Here Freedom shall flourish, a star in the west; The dove and the eagle together shall rest; Fair Science, delighted, her portals unfold, And Genius soar upward on pinions of gold. Though bloody Ambition, with Envy and Hate, Have sunk hapless France to a vassalage state; The strand where she founder'd our policy shuns, While we take to our bosom her emigrant sons. The names of our heroes, recorded by Fame, Shall glow in her tablets in letters of flame; And patriots, and sages, and bards yet unborn, With splendour as brilliant the page shall adorn. Our glory a lustre untarnish'd displays, Yet soon it may dazzle with still brighter rays; Virtue, talents, and firmness, combin'd, may appear, New-York may yet furnish our state charioteer. Dear Patrons, this honest effusion excuse, You well may be weary, for so is our muse; Then accept our best wishes, believe them sincere, And long may we greet you with âHappy New-Year.â NEW-YEAR ADDRESS, Written for the Carrier of the Columbianâ1811. Patrons, the moon, whose silver cresent dress'd At ten last night, the star-bespangled west, Has fifteen times her orbit's path-way run, And travelled with us once around the sun, Since first your Carrier, ardent in the toil, Became a satellite of favour's smile, And, with your evening mental banquet graced, Has faithful still his humble orbit traced. Blest with your bounty ere he well begun, His daily curcuit he has cheerful run; Nor changes now, but to renew the year, And meet the sunshine of your favour here. Patrons, fair Freedom saw her children blest With virtue, peace, security and rest; Her foes reduced in numbers, means and power, While notes of pleasure vocalized her bower, From Plenty's horn rich fruits adorn'd her plain, Where Agriculture led her smiling train; The Arts, supported by Industry's hand, Their various blessings scattered o'er the land; And daring Commerce, mid her injuries bold, Reclined on Luxury's lap, bedeck'd with gold. She saw, and smiled. But though her foe, subdued, In adamantine fetters powerless stood, Yet, as he breathed his mad envenomed ire, While his fierce eye-balls shot malignant fire, An âunclean spiritâ on the vapour rode, (As Satan rose from hell's accurst abode) Its form, disgusting to the loathing view, The goddess saw, and Faction's demon knew; On his horn'd head a horrid helm he wore, With dragon-crest, and âSchismâ stampt before, Two writhing serpents his cadueceus twined, With forked tongues, and scaly trails behind; His skinny pinions sable fibres framed, And round his form a sulphurous vapour flamed. The fiend advanced, conceal'd from mortal view, Though Freedom saw, and well his errand knew; Well knew his power, his will, and subtle wiles, Might lure the unsuspecting to his toils; And, with a sigh, beheld his venom'd breath Taint her pure air with pestilence and death; The baneful gas, unconsciously inspired, Her sons with restless disaffection fired; While through their ranks the spreading mania run, The goddess wept, and thought her cause undone. At this dread crisis, pitying Pallas came, To save the mourner, and protect her fame: A burnish'd mail and nodding plume she wore, And â The Columbianâ was the shield she bore; Form'd, like the fabled Ãgis, to oppose And blunt the arrows of a host of foes. Faction in vain opposed his threatening fate; The ransomed victims of the demon's hate, Restored to reason, rallied round the shield, And disaffection hastened from the field. Patrons, excuse this allegoric strain, Nor think your carrier arrogant or vain; Proud of his task, renewing with the year, He knows the subject worthy of your ear; Else why encouraged by your liberal aid, Or why the carrier by its patrons paid? The blooming plant your patronage sustains, Must sure be worthy of his humble strains. Since the â Columbian,â by your favour rear'd, In Freedom's cause her champion first appeared, What various dainties have its columns graced, In rich profusion for the board of taste! The hungry quidnunc, found the ready dish, The politician, all his heart could wish; The moralist, supplied with counsel sage, The scholar, treasures from the classic page; Historians, faithful sketches of the times, And Virtuosi, food from distant climes; Commerce and Arts obtain'd a journal here, To mark their progress through the prosperous year; And Agriculture saw her labours crown'd, Improved by hints which here a record found; Here Humour's friends have seen the lash applied, By Satire's hand, to folly, vice and pride; The Muses' votaries, too, might here admire, The tuneful warblings of a western lyre; And lovers read and bless the happy pair In Hymen's list, and wish their signets there; While Fate's black catalogue this lesson taught, That joy is transientâhuman pleasure short. Patrons, permit your carrier here to name The worthiest champions which the cause can claim, Whose fertile genius has enrich'd our sheet, In columns breathing patriotic heat; Whose fruitful talents you have most admired, While with their glowing sentiments inspired. First, manly Stark appeared upon the field The teeming quill in Freedom's cause to wield; Whose patriot fervor swell'd the breathing page, Commanding plaudits from the listening age. Next in the list, ingenious Rattle rose, Whose humorous pen portrayed luxuriant thought, Nor seem'd to scan the moral which it taught. Franklin attended in the veteran train, His thoughts the abstract of a patriot's brain; And Bankerhill, whose fervid numbers swell'd As when his thunders Freedom's foes repell'd; While ever and anon, each pause between, The gentle Laura breathed a strain serene. Cato, again, the worth of freedom showed; Timolien's thoughts in easy periods flowed; And Juvenis with serious Mercer join'd, To paint the blackness of a traitor's mind. Junius described corrupted Albion's state; Green bade us shun the Dane's unhappy fate; While junior Adams, with a critic's lore, To shreds a pompous declamation tore. Norfolciencis, next enrich'd the page, With style unrivall'd, erudite and sage; And, in the life of British Windham, taught To hate the wretch whom regal gold had bought. Humanitus, in gentle pity's cause, Condemn'd the errors of oppressive laws; And feeling Howard still the theme prolongs, And ably paints the captive debtor's wrongs. Gay Rigmarole, with humour, all his own, With dexterous hand has satire's weapon thrown; And while with justice all admire his art, Law-makers wince, and tingle with the smart. Philanthropus, to start a livelier game, At modern female-fashion took his aim; While hundreds round him from their ambush spring, As folly flies, to shoot her on the wing. Meantime a Hamlet and a Thespis' wage Unequal war with a degenerate stage; Endeavouring still to call true merit forth, And place the chaplet on the brow of worth. To these be added, not the least in fame, Columns of treasure which the muse might name, Pregnant with genius, energy and truth, Of age the wisdom, and the fire of youth: The muse of Selim was not wooed in vain; A lovely minstrel echoed back the strain, Whose tuneful numbers melted on the ear. And who, but wish'd Zorayda's lyre to hear? âThe Rallying Pointâ a fertile pen display'd, With Wisdom's form in Humour's garb array'd, And Hosack's garden oft has furnish'd, too, Some fragrant flowers of no inferior hue. âThe Diarrhodonâ you have heard expose The latent beauties of a modern Rose, And smiled to see the lively writer roast The doughty champion of the Morning Post. Through the Columbian you were first inform'd, O'er bleeding Spain, what martial myriads swarm'd, While Gallia's banner, bathed in human gore, Floated unfurl'd along the sanguine shore. How Wellington his thunders hurl'd on France, Announcing still a retrograde advance; Till the poor Frenchmen, hemm'd by foes and bog, Starved in their ranks for want of soup and frog; How Bona changed the partner of his bed, And with the sweetest flower of Austria wed; While his ex-empress, with submissive grace, Retired to give the lovely stranger place. How Francis Burdett braved despotic power, While tyranny condemn'd him to the tower; How Cobbett's pen incensed the foes of truth, Who fed the viper till they felt his tooth. Indignant, here the tale you have perused Of Freedom's flag a second time abused, When the Moselle, beneath our eagle's eye, Dared bid her thunders on the Vixen fly. While the great combat of election reign'd, The right of suffrage here you saw maintain'd; Till heaven-born truth, which vice in vain assails, Bid twice three thousand freemen turn the scales. Through the Columbian, too, you might admire, What literary minds to fame aspire. What fruits of genius spring from Freedom's soil, And what rewards attend their ardent toil. Nor is our state, upon the list of fame, In literature the least or humblest name. Spafford pursues a bold and ardent course, With pen and talents not suppass'd by Morse; M'Creery bids the harp of Erin breathe, And round his temples binds the verdant wreath; And Wood, with philosophic reasoning shows From what mysterious cause the ocean flows. Immortal Fraser's wonder-working quill Can every breast with admiration fill; With laurels crown'd, the sweet dramatic muse, A second Shakspear in her Minshul views, Whose lofty lyre, disdaining meaner notes, Paints to the life aââBard in petticoats.â Searson and Grotecloss, with magic lays, To rapture's tone the cords of feeling raise; Fair Ripley too, at sinners shakes the head, Seizes her pen, and writes the rascals dead. Invention's progress, too, has here been traced, And all improvements that our clime have graced. Ingenius Hall, with true mechanic lore, Has taught an augur without hands to bore; While Morneveck the higher merit claims To guard our roofs from desolating flames; Harlan disdain'd the magnet's varying power, And made the plane which marks the changing hour, Its use supplyâwhile the inventive Day Bestow'd new powers on Winter's gliding sleigh. But most might you admire the wonderous power, That knits a pair of stockings in an hour; And shrewdly think, as you these wonders read, That life will shortly no exertions needâ That some invention, o'er the whole to leap, Will make us food, and feed us while we sleep. Patrons, how anxious have you told the clock, Waiting impatient for your carrier's knock! Eager to seize this âmap of busy life,â âIts fluctuations,â harmonies, and strife; To sit at ease, surveying, as it turns Beneath your view, âthe globe and its concerns;â Thus âthrough the loop-holes of retreatâ to scan The busy scene and all the works of man. The well-known-welcome signal sounds at last, âNow stir the fire and close the shutters fast, Let down the curtains, wheel the sofa round,â The sheet is open, and the column found: âThe grand debateâ now meets your eager eye, âThe popular harangue, the tart reply, The logic, and the wisdom, and the wit,â The agile parry and the dexterous hit; The pestilence, which human science mocks, âHouses in ashes, and the fall of stocks, Births, deaths and marriages,â marine events, Ships spoke, arrived, or just departing hence. Soft eloquence here lubricates the page, There âcataracts of declamationâ rage; While columns more the ins and outs expose, âWith many descants on a nation's woes.â Nor stop you here, for next, before your eyes, âForests of strange but gay confusionâ rise: Rare sales at AuctionâFashions just come o'er; Comoglio's concertâWaite's true lucky store; Cooke's benefitâfoot, horse, or water race; Warne's RegisterâWet Nurses out of place; Diseases curedâHouses to sell or let; âWhereas a libelâââRan away in debt;â Museums, sermons, celebration feasts, Phantasmagories, strange and monstrous beasts. In short one line the catalogue completesâ Heaven earth and ocean, plundered of their sweets. With all these various dainties here display'd Have you been furnish'd by your carrier's aid; Besides a numerous catalogue of tales, Home-manufactured, or received by mails; Of shipwrecks, murders, hurricanes and rains, Of mountain-torrents deluging our plains; Of men who brave eternity's dread brink, And drinking die, and even when dying drink; And one, whom death had vanquish'd in the strife, By drinking brandy soon restored to life; Of suicides, and accidents, and fires, And all, in short, cur'osity requires. Since such your carrier's service, sure he may His patrons greet without offence to-day; May wish them every happiness on earth, Obtain'd by wealth, or merited by worth. He will not boast of toils he may sustain, Through heat and cold, in tempests, snows, or rain; He will not plead his poverty, nor tell, That, faithful to his trust, he served you well; But, while the sycophantic suppliant starves, He, independent as the press he serves, To facts self-evident directs your view, And modestly refers the rest to you. FIRST LESSON OF LOVE. In vain I breathed the tender sigh At lovely Mary's feet; My soul, which glisten'd in my eye, No kindred ray could meet. With cold indifference she repliedâ âMy heart you do not move; âAnd I will never be a bride âTill I have learn'd to love.â âO then, (I cried) my pupil be, âThy breast no longer steel; âSure, I can teach, sweet girl, to thee, âThe lesson which I feel!â âNo, Selimâyou have tried it long, âAnd yet I don't improve; âI'm dullâor you instruct me wrongâ âI have not learn'd to love.â I left her hopelessâbut at eve We met, when she exclaim'dâ âNow, Selimânow my heart receive, âWith love for you inflamed!â Surprised, delighted, soon I guess'd What thus the fair could moveâ My hair had been by Huggins dress'd, She sawâand learn'd to love. SECOND LESSON OF LOVE. OR THE CHARM IRRESISTIBLE. âNo, friendship, dear Julia, is all I can proffer, âMy love is another's, who loves me in turn; âAccept my esteemâit is all I can offer, âThe flame of affection for Mary must burn. âThen cease, lovely girl, to exhibit those graces, âNor tempt me from constancy, honour and truth; âFor I never will yield to love's hallowed embraces, âTill the arms of my Mary receive her fond youth. âI pity the sorrow that 'waits thee at parting, âAnd which, for a season, may rob thee of rest; âBut time will soon sooth the sad heart I leave smarting, âAnd the sweet dove of peace shall revisit her nest. âYou tell me my glances have nourish'd your passion, âAnd gilded with hope the sweet prospect of bliss; âDear artless echantress! untutor'd by fashion! âYour beauty demanded a homage like this. âHad I known you ere this constant heart was my Mary's âIt might have been Julia's, and both have been blest; âBut now 'tis too late, for if ever it varies, âMay my image for ever be banish'd her breast.â 'Twas thus to fair Julia I modestly pleaded, Nor dared meet the glance of her love-beaming eye; Perplex'd by the subject, my tongue was impeded, And I sat sunk in silence, till roused by her sigh. Then our eyes met by instinctâbut, ah! the transgression My Mary for ever is doom'd to deplore! For, Oh! such a sweet and bewitching expression, Ne'er beam'd from the face of a mortal before. I flew to her arms, with this fond exclamation, âDear Julia! I'm thine! and we never will part! âBut explain, my sweet angel! this new fascination, âSay, whence this new charm that has vanquish'd my heart?â She replied, with a smile that enraptured my bosom, âThe charms which you now irresistible own, âAre the gift of Desborus, whose magic renews 'em, âHis art can create and preserve them alone.â Protect, then, this artist, ye beaux, 'tis your duty; Ye belles, let Desborus your patronage prove; 'Tis his to new polish the armour of beauty, The ringlets he weaves are the meshes of love. THIRD LESSON OF LOVE; OR THE WAY TO KEEP HIM. Ye fair, who complain of neglect in your spouses, And mourn the extinction of love in their hearts, My recipe conâ'tis the charm which arouses The flame that may slumber, but seldom departs. Eliza once shone the perfection of beauty, The mirror of fashion, the phÅnix of taste, When Edwin, invited by love and by duty, Pray'd Hymen to favour an ardour so chaste. He loved herâbut long ere he whisper'd his passion, Affection for him taught Eliza to sigh; And arm'd with attractions by beauty and fashion, Her conquest she read in the glance of his eye. Their nuptials were sweeten'd with love's purest rapture: But exquisite pleasure the soonest expires; Eliza forgot 'twas a trifle to capture, Compared with the art which retaining requires. Secure of her prize, she neglected to cherish The charms which subdued him, and gilded his chain; And carelessly suffered attractions to perish, The guard and the glory of beauty's domain. The moments devoted to love and caresses, Were gradually shorten'dâfor Edwin would roam; To his heart with less ardour her bosom he pressesâ His paradise seem'd any where but at home. Astonish'd and grieved at this wane of attention, With tears and intreaties she sought for the cause, And task'd, but in vain, her once ready invention, To find out the reason, if any there was. Till prompted by pride, to awaken his passion, She studied her once-boasted charms to improve, Applied to Desborus, field-marshal of fashion, And begg'd a supply of the weapons of love. With a bow full of grace, and a smile that is nature's, Desborus began all his genius to show, When heart-slayers, beau-killers, annihilators, Different description of ringlets, so called. Waved lightly around her smooth forehead of snow. As clouds round the sun in bright glory descending, Diffuse the rich radiance in rose-coloured streaks; So each curl (while her eyes their new lustre were lending) Reflected the blushes of light on her cheeks. And her portals of breath, with their pearls studded round, Lately dim from neglect, now new polish'd were seen; And oft as they oped to her voice's sweet sound, A thousand young cupids were peeping between. Hymen's lamp was rekindled, her Edwin grew kind, More constancy never was shown by the dove; At the conjugal chain he no longer repined, Since Huggins entwined it with garlands of love. CUPID'S LAMENTATION, OR THE PUFF ALLEGORICAL. On the banks of the Hudson, enamell'd with flowers, Fair Venus reclined in a myrtle alcove; Her doves were unyoked, and the wild-woven bowers Were vocal with strains to the goddess of love: When soaring on high o'er the city's gay throng, Her son met her view, who approach'd her retreat; On gossamer pinion he floated along, And alighted mid roses that bloom'd at her feet. âO Cupid! (she cried) what occasions this grief? âAnd where is thy quiver, thy bow, and thy darts?â âAll gone, dear mama! O a sad wicked thief âHas ruin'd thy sonââsobb'd the ruler of hearts. âI left you, but lately, to sport in the town, âWhere, mother, you promised me plenty of game; âBut though many I started, not one I run down, âAnd Hymen, for me, may extinguish his flame. âI peep'd in a shop, where a form met my view âWhose beauty surpass'd that of mortals by far; âSo lovely, so fair, that I thought it was you, âAnd entered to kiss and salute my mama. âBut an impudent mortal, who played with her hair, âWhich wanton'd in ringlets on forehead of snow; âOne lovely lock opened, and slyly hid there âMy ruby-tipp'd arrows and dear little bow. âIn vain I imploredâhe saw my tears flow, âAnd tauntingly told me my prowess was o'er, âWhen who should appear, but a gay little beau, âWhom often in vain I had shot at before. âThe moment his eye met a glance of the fair, âHis bosom beat quickly with rapturous bound, âWhen one of my arrows flew swift from her hair, âAnd entered that breast which I never could wound. âThus, thus, my dear mother, we both are undone, âFor mortals no more will solicit our care; âThis thief gives each ringlet the power of your son, âAnd his art makes a Venus of each earthly fair.â âWhere lives the usurper?â with anger she cried, âWho dares on a mortal my beauties display?â âIn yonder great cityââthe urchin repliedâ âHis name they call Huggins, he lives in Broadway.â THE OLD MAID'S COMPLAINT, OR THE PUFF POSITIVE. I've seen the blushing garden drest In all the boasted pride of art; With nature's gayest beauties blest, Combined to captivate the heart. I've seen the florist's skill employ'd The chosen favourite plants to rear, Screen their sweet forms, when storms annoy'd, And guard them from each danger near. And I have seen a lonely flower, Neglected by the florist's care, Exposed to all the blasting power Of tempests, frosts, and wintry air. Such is our lotâcondemn'd to prove The worst malignity of fate, Estranged from the delights of love, Exposed to ridicule and hate. But, ah! in vain we still assign, To Heaven or Fate, the cruel cause; It springs not from the will divine, And chance denies it in her laws. When first we bloom'd, no magic art The charms which nature gave improved; But now Desborus can impart Charms so bewitching, all are loved. QUARTER-DAY, OR THE Horrors of the First of May. A POEM. NOTE. The following Poem is founded on a custom peculiar to the city of New-York, where rents and leases uniformly commence on the first day of MAY. It was the production of a few leisure evenings in the spring of 1812, and dedicated (see line 42d) to the honourable Dewitt Clinton, then Mayor of the city of New-York. While sylvan bards awake the tuneful strain Responsive to the murmur of some rill Meandering slow along the rushy dale; Or, deep embosom'd in the sweet recess Of fragrant bower, by feathered choir made vocal, Chant, to the flow'r-deck'd lyre, a hackney'd theme, The sweets of May in vernal beauties dight; Mine be the task, in city garret pent, Stunn'd by the tuneless serenade of wheels, O'er pavements rolling, dissonant and harsh, To sing of May arrayed in Horror's garb Terrific. May the first, call'd QUARTER-DAY, That period of suspense, of fear, despair, And each ungracious feeling that annoys: That temporal day of judgment, when unhoused And trembling mortals, at the awful bar Of merciless landlords, render their accounts, And lenity implore, too oft, in vain. Come, Heaven-born Sympathy, still prompt to give A tear to grief, or lend a smile to joy, Be thou my muse; inspire my feeble verse In thy behalf; O teach the bard to fill With glowing hues the outlines here portray'd, And give a faithful picture of the scene. Hold thou the palet, Truth shall guide his hand, To trace the horrors of that dreadful day, When this proud city, with commotion fill'd, Presents a scene of tumult, noise, and strife, With which compared, old Babel's lofty tower Was Order's temple and the shrine of peace. That day, to Poverty so full of wo, And which the bard, her chosen son, despairs To meet prepared, unless his song should win The golden charm to strip it of its frowns. Such be the untried theme, for which I now Loose from its wooden peg my dusty harp, By cobwebs long enshrined, disused, untuned; But if the jarring wire can yield a sound That only tastes of melody, O deign, Ye friends of song, to listen to my lay, Which boasts, at least, virginity and truth. And thou, in whom unrivall'd talents draw From virtue dignity; whose private worth And public fame have call'd thee, by the voice Of patriot freemen, guardians of the state, To fill the chair of Justice, and become The watchful father of a city's wealâ O listen to my humble song. The muse Aspires to court thy patronage and favor; Not for the pride of birth, or vain parade Of pompous heraldry, which Freemen leave The boast of liveried slaves; her reverence springs From love of virtues which ennoble thee Beyond an emperor's gift; but more than all For that unfeign'd benevolence of heart Which oft has screen'd from fell Oppression's power The wretch unfortunate, by landlord stripp'd Of all the goods domestic wants require; That sympathy which dries the widow's tear, Protects the orphan, and forever sheds A cloudless lustre on the name of Clinton. While yet Aquarius, from his ponderous jar, With liberal hand, on Winter's frosty shrine, His gelid offering pours, libations rude Of noxious vapours, sleet, and hail, and rain; While yet the town in desolation lies, The streets delightless, save the tuneful hum Of tinkling sleigh-bells; and while yet the clock Of annual tenure strikes three quarters past, With âdreadful note of preparation,â now, E'en now the scene commences. Prompt to call, The landlord, with prelusive tale of loss By fire, or worthless tenants, shows his bill, Throwing a glance expressive round the room, Which says, as plain as miser's eyes can speak, âMy money or your goods.â This pittance paid, If happily within the tenant's power, This ghost appears no more till the great day Which comes anon. Meantime the anxious search For tenements begins; for rents increase, And half our population, or for that, Or business, or for fashion, must remove, And with bright May begin another year. 'Tis the strange mania that disclaims a cure, Though its impolicy great Franklin urged, And sad experience demonstrate the fact. Now on the posts and lintels of our doors Appear the mystic scrolls, uncouthly traced, Putting to blush orthography and sense; But plain enough to let the passer know Their vast importââa house, or rooms to let.â At this inclement season, ye who share A tenfold portion of terrestrial wealth, Who boast the face and image of a God, O strive in temper to be like him too, And purchase stock in Heaven's eternal funds. Cherish sweet pity in your manly breasts For all Misfortune's hapless race, and be The guardians, not the tyrants of the poor. O I have seen such curs'd oppressive acts, Such merciless deeds of cruelty, enforced By griping Landlords, despots of an hour, As would with blushes light a demon's cheek, And to a seraph's call the pitying tear. And all for what? A drop of ocean lost! The wretched pittance of a quarter's rent! (The pauper's shelter cannot cost him much) A few poor pounds, which, added to the heap Of yellow dirt the mole is heaving up, Were scarce perceivedâby poverty withheld, Is crime enough to doom the shivering wretch With wife and childrenâ(what augmented pangs!) To brave, unhoused, the less remorseless storm; Or else, entomb'd within a prison's walls, Endure the anguish of a âliving death!â Inhuman tyrants! Vassals of your lusts! Idolators, who worship Aaron's calf! Allow the sufferer time, and you may win The golden god without such sacrifice, The immolation of your fellow-man! Give him, at least, the chance you would a deer, A generous start, and when he stands at bay, 'Tis time enough to slip the dogs of death, And glut your Nero-appetites with blood. In Ormond's garret, near proud Hudson's stream, Resided once a fond contented pair: The youthful Edwin, just in wedlock join'd To the dear object of his boyish love, The fair Amelia. Though their humble hopes Were bounded by necessity's demand, They were but barely realized; and Want Would sometimes knock, but never dared intrude. Yet still industry, by affection urged, With frugal management, and sprightly health, Secured them comfort and domestic peace; Each homely meal receiving higher zest, From being earn'd before it was enjoy'd. One year roll'd round, and in their favour left A trifling balance, after all demands Were satisfied with scrupulous exactness. Sacred treasure! for one fond event Now hastening on, the consecrated boon Was joyfully reserved; while smiling hope Lent double vigour to the daily task Which fed the pair, and saved the little fund. But, ah! relentless fate had woes in store Unmerited by virtue such as theirs. The tender moment, destined to complete Their little plan of happiness, arrived; But only came to blast their fondest hopes. The poor Amelia, after nameless pangs, That push'd her to the precipice of fate, And left her trembling on its dizzy verge, Ushered to light, but not to life, a babe. Edwin, distracted, o'er the sufferer hung, As though his loved Amelia's wasting life Was with the web of his existence wove. Night after night, and day succeeding day, His eyes estranged from sleep, his frame from rest, He watch'd her fading form, and by her couch, Entranced in speechless agony, remained. Doctors and nurses, nostrums, fuel, food, And all the nameless calls of sickness, soon Exhausted Edwin's little frugal store, And nought but want, disease, and deep despair, Remain'd the inmates of his drear abode. The few utensils of domestic use Their humble means afforded, one by one, Had found their way to grace a broker's stall, Till the poor couch on which Amelia lay, (The scene of all his joys and all his woes) Alone remain'd of Edwin's worldly wealth. 'Twas at this crisis, while the husband stood, Absorb'd in grief, beside the senseless fair, His landlord entered. Ormond, who could count The annual tribute of an hundred rents; Ormond, whose coffers groan'd with their contents, Came to demand the recent quarter's due! The heart-broke mourner raised his humid eyes And threw them round the desolated room, Then pointing to the melancholy bed Bade savage Ormond view his little all. âHa! swindling wretch! (the human monster cried) Your goods embezzled, and myself unpaid! Thus every year some cursed loss like this Have I to meet: but you shall not escape.â âForbear, (cries Edwin) and respect my grief! This scene is sacred to despair and silence. Let me but catch Amelia's parting breath, Close her dear eyes, and give a farewel kiss, Then, wretch! dispose of Edwin as you please.â âWhat little your dishonesty has left, Ormond replies, this moment shall secure; Your bed is mine!â A marshal, at his beck, Entered the room, and both approach'd the couch. Edwin, whose spirit sorrow had subdued, Entreated, prayed, and on his knees implored, A little respiteâbut, alas! in vain! With savage coolness, they commenced the taskâ Amelia, writhing in the pangs of death, They placed, ungently, on the cheerless floor, Secured their prey, and saw the sufferer die! Nor ye, who startle at such fiend-like deeds, With undissembled horror, think I paint A fancy-piece; for this was drawn from lifeâ The wretch still lives to curse his fellow-men. Nor vainly think such Nero-spirits few, While thousands pine beneath their despot sway. Ask the poor widow whom a merciless wretch Doom'd to the horrors of a grated cell, Her grief unheeded, and her infant train Deprived the comfort of a mother's care. A circling year has scarcely roll'd its round Since Burger's wrongs were made the public theme, This passage needs no comment save the insertion of the following notice, copied from the Columbian of March 11, 1811. To the Charitable and Philanthropic. The assistance and charitable contributions of the humane and benevolent, are earnestly solicited to relieve the wants, alleviate the miseries, and soothe the anguish, of a poor and friendless widow, named Burger; who, with her three children, are now deprived of support, and destitute of sustenance, by her being confined in the debtors' prison of this city, for a paltry debt due for house rent, to a wealthy, but cruel, rapacious, vindictive, inexorable and unfeeling landlord, named ?, who brutally attempted to deprive her and her children of the shelter afforded of a desolate house during the late severe snow-storm; though the poor unhappy woman had previously paid her rent punctually to him; and though she offered to pay him a stated sum weekly out of the earnings of her manual labour until the amount due should have been paid. âMan's inhumanity to man, makes countless thousands mourn.â And found, in public sympathy, redress. Attend a sheriff's sale; the savage rites Of Plutus' worship, on whose golden shrine The little worldly comforts of the poor, Without compunction, still are sacrificed, Fattening his priests at honesty's expense! See that fond mother striving to redeem A little trinket, worth the world to her, The death-bed token of a darling son. But, ah! she strives in vainâfor prayers and tears Are all she has to give; and what are these To sordid souls who worship wealth alone! The hammer falls, and 'tis for ever gone. What, but this spirit, doom'd the feeling Howard For sixteen years to languish in a jail, The essays of Howard are well known. He reprobated the system of imprisonment for debt, and says that he was sixteen years a prisoner for that crime in the jail of the city and county of New-York. âIt is (says he) a horrid placeâand many a time when, through the grates of my prison window, I have watched the last rays of the setting sun as they gilded some neighbouring spire, I have wondered that any man could find it in his heart to put a fellow being in jail for debt.â âI have at last given up the hope of libertyâblessed liberty! I can hardly write the word without dropping a tear at the recollection of the joyous days of liberty which are gone for ever. I am sad when I think how they have fled away like a dream, and that neither I nor my creditors can ever recal them. âHabit has so altered me from the gay being that I was, that I really suppose if I were offered my freedom to-day I could not enjoy it.â âAs the hoary-headed tenant of the bastile, whose locks, like mine, whitened in confinement for no crime, most probably I should sayâ âI have no moneyâno friendsâmy talents for business are lostâI have forgotten the ways of the worldâsend me back to prison, for the light is hateful.â Whose only crime, to give its blackest name, Was that of being poor! A sad offence! The judge who dooms a felon to his fate, Softens his sentence with the tones of pity; And Justice, while she strikes the fated blow, From her stern eye emits the truant tear; But the poor debtor hears not Pity's voice, Beholds no falling sympathetic tear! His sentence is his adversary's will, His jury, Malice, Hate, and black Revenge; And while these triumph o'er the falling wretch, Insulted Justice, blushing, drops her scales. Howard was blest with youth, and health, and all That could impart a charm to human life; A faithful partner, and a smiling boy, â When I entered the walls of this terrible jail, in which, amid the rattling of chains, I am now writing this little impertinent story of myself, I was young, in good health, blest with a wife whom I adored, and as fine a boy as ever smiled in the face of a father. The boy is deadâand my wife is no more. She was indeed a most excellent woman, but she was wounded to the soul by the horrors of our situationâ her spirit was broken down, and she, with the infant that caused her sickness, died in child-bed in jail, shortly after my imprisonment, in the year 1794.â Howard. Between them shared a heart replete with love. But, ah! too generous for his humble means, To save his friend, he lost, alas! himself; And here, on Freedom's consecrated soil, The exile's refuge and the wanderer's home, Was robb'd at once of Freedom, home, and all, And buried in the horrors of a jail! Struck to the soul, his wife, his dearer self, Broken with grief, the victim of despair, Languish'd awhile and found relief in death. Her infant shortly shared her mother's fate, Leaving the father, husband, whelm'd in wo, Alone and friendless, without even Hope To dart a ray of comfort through his cell; Bereaved of freedom, consort, child, and friends, To gratify a miser's sordid spleen! The tardy years roll'd on their cheerless round, Whitening a head by sorrows thus depress'd, And bending youth beneath decrepit age; Till the fourth part of life's allotted span The suffering wretch in slavery had told! 'Twas this same fiend-like spirit, too, that sunk Unhappy Brown to an untimely grave; âSome years since, (says Howard) a young man by the name of Brown was cast into the prison of this city for debt. His manners were very interesting. His fine dark eyes beamed so much intelligence, his lively countenance expressed so much ingenuousness, that I was induced, contrary to my usual rule, to seek his acquaintance.â Companions in misery soon become attached to each other.â âBrown was informed that one of his creditors would not consent to his discharge, that he had abused him very much, (as is usual in such cases) and made a solemn oath before his God to keep him in jail âtill he rolledâ!! I watched Brown's countenance when he received this information, and whether it was fancy or not, I cannot say, but I thought I saw the cheering spirit of hope, in that moment, desert him for ever.â âNothing gave Brown pleasure, but the daily visits of his amiable wife. By the help of a kind relation, she was able to give Brown, sometimes, soup, wine, and fruit, and every day, whether clear or stormy, she visited the prison to cheer the drooping spirits of her husband. She was uncommonly pretty. She seemed an angel, administering consolation to a man about to converse with angels. One day, passed the hour of one o'clock, and she came not. Brown was uneasy. Twoâthree, and four o'clock passed, and she did not appear. Brown was distracted. A messenger arrived. Mrs. Brown was very dangerously ill, and supposed to be dying in a convulsive fit. As soon as Brown received this information he darted to the door with the rapidity of lightning. The inner door was openâand the jailor, who had just let some one in, was closing it as Brown passed violently through it. The jailor knocked him down with a massy iron key which he held in his hand, and Brown was carried lifeless and covered with blood, to his cell.â âMrs. Brown diedâand her husband was denied even the sad privilege of closing her eyes. He lingered for some time, till at last, he called me one day, and, gazing on me while a faint smile played upon his lipsâhe said, âhe believed death was more kind than his creditorsââAfter a few convulsive struggles he expired.â âLegislators and sages of America! permit me to ask youâhow much benefit has that creditor derived from the imprisonment and consequent death of an amiable man, in the bloom of youthâwho, without this cruelty, might have flourished, even now, an ornament and a glory to the nation?â That drove the poor and persecuted Smith âIn the year 1803, the yellow fever raged in this city with relentless fury. Every where the citizens fled from the destructive pestilence; the rich resorted to the seats of fashion and pleasure, the poor sought refuge in those shelters provided in the suburbs of the city by the benevolence of our active corporation. Humanity exerted herself in favour of every class of the communityâexcept the debtors.â âAmong the prisoners who endured the indescribable horrors of this season, there was one named Smith. His wife and two daughters kept a boarding house in Water-street. They were too rich to be included in the class that was provided for by the corporation, and too poor to support the expenses of an exile in the country. They were, however, preparing to tax the friendship and charity of some of their neighbours for a little loan of money to enable them to move with their boarders to Greenwich, when Mr. Smith was arrested for a small debt, and thrown into prison. âThis misfortune disconcerted their planâthe neighbours fled, and to increase the miseries of Mrs. Smith, the boarders, who had hitherto contributed to her support, fled also; and shortly after, herself and both her daughters fell victims to the prevailing epidemic.â âAnd, will you believe it? reader! no entreaty, no bribe, within the father's power, could prevail on any one to go to his house to bring him information of the state of his family.â âThe first and last information this unfortunate father ever received of his family, was in the newspaper. They were buried in Potter's Field.â âThe father starved awhile in jail, till, at length, goaded by his suffering, he forged a check on the Manhattan Bank, was transferred to Bridewell, and from thence, after trial and conviction, was condemned to the State Prison for seven years. Soured by misfortunes, and rendered misanthropic by unmerited sufferings, he exulted in his crime, and often was heard to advise people rather to be a criminal than a debtor in this country, for that society here furnished the criminal with the conveniences of life, while the debtor was suffered to starve. He at length died, the enemy of society, cursing men! And this is one among the millions of instances in which slavery for debt has destroyed families, and ruined the morals of a man, who, under a rational government, might have lived, the defender of liberty, and a disciple of religion.â âUnfeeling, cruel, pitiless and remorseless creditors; and, legislators of New-York, careless heedless and criminal as they, whether ye sleep or wake, may the spirits of injured Smith and his suffering family, give ye no peace till your hearts shall be touched with pity, and your eyes be opened to the folly of your ways.â To desperation, guilt, and shame, and death; Entail'd on Danvers undeserved wo, Danvers was a fellow-prisoner with Howard. His little daughter was unfortunately burnt to death at home, while Mrs. Danvers was visiting her husband in prison. âAs soon as Danvers came here, (says Howard) destitute and sad as he was, he felt not for himselfâbut, as to his beloved wife and two charming children, the prospect was frightful. Thanks to the kindness of a stranger, they were not permitted to starve.â âA bookseller in the neighbourhood of the prison humanely employed Danvers and his wife in folding, cutting and stitching books; and what with a rigid economy, the slender earning of this labour, together with the occasional aid of charity, Danvers and his wife were sometimes in the midst of misfortunes blest with contentment. âIt was in one of those halcyon hours that Danvers and myself were âmaking merryâ over the last remains of a pitcher of ale, which he had purchased to aid us in celebrating the birth-day of his little darling daughter Eliza. Mrs. Danvers, who had hired a small house in the upper part of the city, had just left us, saying, as she departed, that âshe would go home and make little Eliza drink our health, for the high honours paid her on her birth-day by the prisoners.â âIt was winter, and as Danvers, peeping through the grate of his prison, saw his cheerful and amiable wife trudging through the snow, to carry his blessing to the âdarling ElizaâââNow, Howard,â said he, âby the goddess of mercy! (and I think her the best goddess in the catalogue) I feel at this moment that I am gay in spite of oppression. My wife there is an angel, and the daughter, whose fourth birthday now makes me so happy, is worth more, in my estimation, than all the wealth in the world. Dearly as I love my liberty,â continued he, âI would sooner remain a slave than part with that little darling of my heart. Come, Howard! here's to many happy returns of Eliza's birth-day.â So saying, he took up the cup, and was just applying it to his lips, when suddenly the door of his room flew open, and in rushed his eldest child, covered with snow, her hands and face purple with cold, her eyes wild, and the tears frozen on her cheek. It was some moments before her excessive grief would permit her to speak. She asked for her motherâwho had just departed. âGod forbid,â said Danvers, âthat any misfortune should happen to your mother.â At length the girl was able to speak: âEliza is burnt to death!â âI will not undertake to describe, but leave the reader to imagine the consternation of Danvers, when those horrid words fell upon his earââEliza is burnt to death!â âWith tottering steps, he reached the outward gate of the prison, and faintly asked the keeper of the jail to send some one to his house. âWhat will you give me?â said he in a surly tone that struck to the heart of Danvers. At that instant a messenger arrived with a note from Mrs. Danvers. With a trembling hand Danvers opened the note and read: âMy husband, come instantlyâEliza is dyingâcome instantly.â The words were somewhat defaced, and, evidently, by the mother's tears. I looked at Danvers. With a faltering voice he begged the jailor to go with him that he might see his dying Eliza. There was so much of intreating wo in his countenance, that no human being could have denied his request. The jailor positively refused. âFeeling that the barbarity of the law absolutely took away from him all hope of seeing his child again, Danvers indulged in the frenzy of grief, imprecated terrible curses on the heads of unfeeling creditors, and in this delirium of agony was dragged to his room. The scene was too affecting for me to endure it any longer, and I turned away almost overcome by a reflection upon the indescribable horrors of this miserable prison. âThe next morning I received from the afflicted Danvers the following note: âHoward! my child, my dear Eliza is dead. Her mother, since I cannot go to my child, will bring her remains to me, I shall see her bodyâbefore she is entombed. Come to me at fourâwe will all weep over her?â âAt the time proposed, I went to my friend's cell. His surviving child was already there. The room would have been entirely dark but for a little lamp which stood near the window, âcasting a dim religious lightâ upon the iron grates on the outside. He rose as I approached, and pressing my hand with fervour, pointed to a seat, wished me well in a low voice, and resumed his former place. We had not long been seated before the coffin was brought in, followed by the mourning mother and her old servant maid, Lucy. The mother and the daughter covered their faces, turned aside, and wept aloud. The father knelt beside the bier, fixed his eyes silently upon the child's face, contemplated it with great anxiety for some minutes, then suddenly bursting into a flood of tears, made some low, faltering, but indistinct exclamations, and waved his hand to the attendant, who caused the coffin to be taken away.â And doom'd his tender daughter to the flames. Unfeeling, cruel, and remorseless souls! Ye who on Sunday still profanely pray, âForgive our debts, as we, O Lord, forgive Our debtorsââmay the letter of your prayers Remain unansweredâfor, 'tis death ye ask! And, Oh! your souls are not prepared for that. When meek-eyed Pity moved the generous band This alludes to a Society of gentlemen, (of whom the benevolent Dewitt Clinton was one) called the âGood Samaritans;â formed for the purpose of visiting the poor in this city during the well remembered hard winter, and distributing relief to all who stood in need of it. In the most inclement weather they regularly took their charitable circuit, and always returned loaded with the widow's benedictions and the orphan's thanks. How god-like! How worthy of imitation! To range our city, searching for distress, Bidding the widow's cheerless hearth to blaze, And driving cold and hunger from her door, How look'dâhow felt these hard obdurate fiends? Did not a fever glow upon their cheek, When meddling Memory with these acts compared Their blacker deeds of cruelty? O, no! For devils seldom blush. Their feelings then Resembled those of the infernal race, When Heaven stoop'd a sinking world to save. But May approaches, rugged winter flies, And Poverty can bask himself and smile. Those who intend to take an active part In this great drama, now are all prepared; Their various characters are duly cast, By managers, to one or both of whom All must submitâNecessity and Whim. 'Tis expectation allâthe curtain soon Will rise upon a busy, noisy scene, Such as, perhaps, old Goshen once display'd, When Egypt's house of bondage Israel left, (Hard-hearted Pharaoh was their landlord then) And every family, at once, removed. But first, while yet the anxious tenant counts His landlord's claim, at twelve to-morrow due; Or of his wealthier friends, a part from each, Attempts to borrow, to secure his stuff; The busy matron and her daughters ply, With peevish fretfulness, their annual task. Down come the bedsteads, tumbled in the yard, Where hot ablutions drive their tenants out, And take their lives for rent. The mirrors next, And all the pictures, with their dusty frames, Are loosened from the wall to grace the floor, Now thickly strew'd with broken glasses round, Baskets of crockery, tables, stands, and chairs, And all the nameless lumber conjured forth, Of garret, cellar, pantry, and the rest. The night in which pale April yields to May, How few enjoy repose! The country lass, Intent upon the morning walk, with him Who holds her gentle heart, on various plans, In hopeful cogitations, spends the nightâ What hat, or ribbon, will become her best, What most will tend to make herself outvie The blushing, fragrant month they rise to hail. O, by my soul! this Maying has delights Which I shall ne'er forget, while memory holds Her seat within my brain. In youth's fair dawn, I forward look'd to this delightful hour With feelingsâfeelings none can paint; for then, Some gentle, artless, unaffected nymph, Was sure to be the partner of my walk, Accept my nosegays, (sweetened by her breath) And, without chiding, let me steal a kiss From lips more fragrant than the rose she held. Season of love, and innocent delight, Where Nature reigns the mistress of the scene, Farewell! Imprisoned in the cell of Art, Stifled with dust, and stunn'd with ceaseless noise, Through the rough grates I can but take a peep, And sigh a sad adieu! To-morrow's sun Returns once more THE DAYâbut how returns? Not with the bliss that country swains enjoyâ No tender thoughts will make me watch to-night, And yet, alas! I shall not taste of rest! My LANDLORD is the master of my fate; And who can tell if next meridian sun Will not behold me dispossess'd of all The humble stock of worldly wealth I own? My wife and boy mayâthat's digression thoughâ Are there not thousands, too, who feel like me, And tremble at the near approach of May? Not for their sinsâbut for the power of those Whom wealth and accident have made their lords. Nor suffers MAN aloneâthe humbler brute Shares in âthe horrors of the first of May:â Where Commerce (now diseas'd) once glow'd in health, The embarrassments under which American commerce laboured, for some time previous to the late war with Great Britain, are well remembered.â Publishers' Note. Rattling o'er pavements with her hundred wheels, Near the Tontineâ'tis dangerous to pass, On any morning, save âthe first of May.â There, waiting for employ, a hardy train Stand by their carts, which block the passage up, Eager to start their lean uncurried beasts, With any burden, for a trifling fee. Not so to-dayâthe piers and slips are clear'd, And every cartman busy: double fees, Back'd by entreaties, too, are sometimes vain; And, like knight-errants, you may be condemn'd This line alludes to the ancient custom of watching armour in church or chapel, which was a religious duty imposed upon knights, in the age of chivalry, when they used to consume the whole night in prayer to some saint whom they chose as their patron; and this exercise of devotion was performed on the night preceding the said Saint's Day. The same ceremony was observed by those who were sentenced to the combat proof. To watch, all night, your arms, and household stuff; While some more lucky tenant holds the place From which you vainly strove to be removed. There is a sport, well known in country towns, Yelep'd âThe Toilet,â which I've often join'd At milk-maids' partiesâwhere the humour lies In having chairs enough for all but one, Who takes the middle of the happy ring, Unseated; till, the signal given, all Must change their places; who obtains no seat, Incurs a forfeit, and the centre takes, To give the signal for another change. Such is the game our city represents âThe first of Mayââfor each must change his place, Uncertain if he get a seat or no. The curtain rises, and the play beginsâ Here at the corner, screen'd by oaken post, The muse shall take her stand, and view the scene. At every door, behold the ready cart Receive its cumbrous load; the horse throws round A glance of meek compassion, which to me Speaks in a language, plain as brutes can speak, âWhat a poor fool is man!â His driver swears, Wives scold, dogs bark, cats mew, and children cry, Pots break, chairs crack, pans ring, and jarring notes Of harshest discord rise on every side. There goes a matron with her looking-glass, A legacy from mother to her child For several generations, and she'll trust None to remove it but her careful self. But better had she stow'd it on the car Where all her baggage rides; for fate has doom'd, (By sudden contact with a porter's load) To dash the sacred treasure from her hand On the unchristian pavements, where she views Her scatter'd hopes in rude disorder spread, Reflecting houses, passengers, and skies. Here a full barrow, piled with feather-beds, Push'd by a sturdy porter, runs you down, Ere you can shun the danger; yonder goes The sweating bearer of a precious load, Baskets of china-ware, and sweetmeat jars, And the cold relics of some late repast. And here, a lumbering cart moves slowly on Piled high with bureaus, bedsteads, tables, desks, Chairs, cradle, rubbish, wash-tubs, kettles, pots, Old empty barrels, benches, trammels, pans, The fire utensils, carpet-rags, old books, And musty pamphlets, oil jugs, bottles, frames, Mats, brooms, Dutch-ovens, gridirons, griddles, jacks, Trunks, piggins, toasters, pickle-pots, and all. 'Tis bustle, tumult, noise, and sore dismay Throughout the city; sleepless was the night, And foodless is the day, for all must fast! On every face is seen an anxious gloom, From him who owns a half a dozen blocks, Down to the humblest tenant of the least; And e'en my favourite dog, with terror struck, Gazes askance upon the troubled scene, And sneaks to some lone corner for repose. Who then is happy on the âFirst of May,â In this famed city? Not the purse-proud wretch Who trembles for his rents, and dooms the poor To sink in deeper wants to feed his lusts: Nor yet the poor, unless their virtues rise Above the common grade; and least of all The poor seduced, mistaken slaves of vice, Who barter chastity and health for gold. They, too, remove, to-day; but 'tis to change The scene of guilt and shame, be more oppress'd By their new tyrants, and perhaps condemn'd To sin for wages which these tyrants share! O may there soon a fabric rise for such, A calm retreat from a censorious world, Where sin's repenting daughters may retire, And find forgiving mercy! Even now A chosen few, of elevated souls, Have plann'd the edifice, contrived the scheme, And only wait assistance from ourselves. Success attend them, and in lasting fame, The Magdalen Society shall live. This Society was instituted about the period at which this Poem was written, and has been attended with considerable success. Who then is happy? Ere she close the strain, The muse herself shall answer. 'Tis the man (Of easy fortune and a generous heart) Whose charity by wisdom is directed, Who loves his God, his neighbour, and himself, In just descending order; whose employ Is doing good to others; whose reward, The bright reflection of the joy he gives; Like a mild taper in a diamond lustre, Which multiplies one little ray to thousands, His means of blessing still increase by use. Not all the Horrors of the first of May, Can shake the solid peace of such a man. The changing seasons, times, events, and all The various scenes that chequer human life, And e'en the chilling adverse storms of fate, Serve but to ripen the celestial fruits His active love produces; draughts of bliss He quaffs for every little taste he gives, And finds a heaven in wishing others there. To seek for happiness in things of sense, In wealth, ambition, pleasure, or supineness, Is but a vain exertionâidle hope; For then we chase a transitory cheat, And leave the game, the real prize behind, Hid in contentment's calm sequester'd vale, While we toil up the mountain's rugged side, Tempting new dangers, and exposed to all The storms that beat ambition's bleaker road; Or perils worse than these, conceal'd beneath The treacherous sweets which bloom in pleasure's path, A thousand serpent-stings, unseen, but fatal. And if in dastard indolence we rest, Our lazy hopes are certain of defeat. Then learn the true, the only real source Whence happiness can flowâa precept drawn From holy writ this heavenly source proclaimsâ âTo fear the Lord, and his commands obey, Is man's whole duty,â in a single line; An easy yoke, a burthen light to bear. 'Tis but to love in heart and action bothâ For love is the fulfilling of the law. NEW-HAVEN: A POEM. New-haven be my themeânor mean the name On the bright tablet of Columbia's fame; For here did Freedom early cast the yoke, And fell'd the despot with the chains she broke; Here Literature and Arts have since combin'd To culture nature and enrich the mind; Here fair Religion meekly lifts her eye, And gives her votaries realms beyond the sky; Here moral worth and âSteady Habitsâ reign, While Vice and Folly seek a place in vain! So boasts Report;âbut, are her vauntings true Come, virgin Truth, the muse appeals to you; Bid Justice come, and trace with us the town, Her balance bring, but throw her sabre down; One scale shall hold the praise to merit due, And Satire's quiver keep the balance true; âLaugh where we mustâbe candid where we can,â Shall be the motto of our humble plan, While varying objects teach the muse to steer, âFrom grave to gayâfrom lively to severe.â 'Tis worth and virtueânot the man, we prizeâ 'Tis vice and follyânot the wretch, that dies. This idea is borrowed from a Cambridge Exercise.ââ'Tis not the fool, but folly is our mark.â Hail, happy city!âhail, thrice happy state! Connecticut! supremely wise and great! Whose constitution cannot yet be broke, Because you wear not such a cumbrous yoke; It is a fact that the state of Connecticut has never yet been blessed with a constitution, unless the royal charter of king Charles can be so called. Whose laws were framed upon the Jewish mode, Till you had time to form a better code; The first settlers of Connecticut passed a resolution, in a general convention, that they would âbe governed by the laws of God, until they had time to make better ones.â To which the sky's cerulean tint was given, Many enquiries have been made respecting the signification of the term âBlue Laws, â which has been, for many years, attached to the political character of the State of Connecticut. The Puritans, (as they were termed) who fled from religious persecutions in Europe, after landing on this Continent, still retained a portion of the âold leaven,â and proceeded immediately to pass laws as singular as they were tyrannical, and as oppressive as they were superstitious. To this day have many of the progeny of the âPuritans, â in the Eastern States, particularly in Connecticut, retained a portion of the follies of their forefathers. For an example of the composition of what is now termed Blue Laws, the following collection of a few of the many curious punishments, inflicted for various offences, is copied from the old court records, between 1630 and 1650: âSir Richard Saltonstall, fined four bushels of malt for his absence from Court. âJosias Plastove shall (for stealing four baskets of corn from the Indians) return them eight baskets again, be fined 5l. and hereafter to be called by the name of Josias, and not Mr. as formerly he used to be. âJoyce Bradwick shall give unto Alexander Becks, 20s. for promising him marriage without her friends' consent, and now refusing to perform the same. âWilliam James, for incontinency, knowing his wife before marriage, was sentenced to be set in the bilboes, and bound in 20l. âThomas Peter, for suspicion of slander, idleness and stubborness, is to be severely whipt, and kept in hold. âRichard Turner, for being notoriously drunk, was fined 2l. âJohn Haggs, for swearing God's foot, cursing his servant, and wishing âa pox of God take you,â was fined 5l. âEdward Palmer, for his extortion, taking 33s. 7d. for the plank and wood work of the stocks, is fined 5l. and censured to be set an hour in the stocks. âJohn White is bound in 10l. to be of good behaviour, and not to come into the company of his neighbour Thomas Bull's wife, alone. âSarah Hales was censured for her miscarriage, to be carried to the gallows with a rope about her neck, and set upon the ladder, the rope's end flung over the gallows, and after to be banished.â A proof sufficient that they came from Heaven. Hail, famed Connecticut! where still we trace The âsteady habitsâ of your fathers' race; Where liberal minds have happy sway attained, By priests unshackled, as by crime unstained! Where genius meets a rich and sure reward, Where speculation never meets with fraud! Where female virtue fears no hapless flaw, For chastity is here secured by law; The punishment for female indiscretion was formerly cruelly severe in Connecticut. When an unfortunate fair one fell a victim to the arts and intrigues of the unfeeling votaries of seduction, the fatal consequences of her error were not deemed a sufficient punishment; a life embittered with tears and regret, not an adequate atonement! No.âTo the loss of peace and reputation was added corporeal tortureâa public scourging on a disgraceful scaffold! To the honour of the state, this law is now laid aside: but I blush for my country while I record its former existence. Where narrow Prejudice is hunted down, And Superstition drove from every town! Where Charity conceals each fault she can, In servile beastsâif not in lordly man; The ironical muse perhaps here has an allusion to the finesse often practised by the dealers in horses, who generally find it politic to conceal the faults of the beasts which they wish to dispose of. Where all so strictly do the laws maintain, That litigation lifts its head in vain; However strictly the laws are observed in Connecticut, but few states in the Union support such a numerous clan of attorneys as âthe land of steady habits,â who all grow rich by speculating on human depravity. Where all, in short, is bliss, unknown to vice, Peace, virtue, innocence, andâParadise! New-Haven, hail! whose puritanic realm No flood of heresy can ever whelm; Whose prisons, gibbet, pillory, or stocks, (Those crucibles of tenets orthodox) Have often taught the heretic to shun The general court of New-Haven, in 1658, passed a severe law against the quakers, which was introduced with the following preamble: Whereas there is a cursed sect of heretics, lately sprung up in the world, commonly called quakers, who take upon them, that they are immediately sent from God, and infallibly assisted by the spirit, who yet speak and write blasphemous opinions, despise government, and the order of God, in church and commonwealth, speaking evil of dignities, &amp;c. Ordered, That whosoever shall bring, or cause to be brought, any known quaker or quakers, into this colony, shall forfeit the sum of fifty pounds. Also, if a quaker come into this jurisdiction on civil business, the time of his stay shall be limited by the civil authority, and he shall not use any means to corrupt or seduce others. On his first arrival, he shall appear before a magistrate, and from him receive license to pass on his business, and (for the better prevention of hurt to the people) have one or more persons to attend upon him at his own charge, &amp;c. The punishments, in case of disobedience, were whipping, imprisonment, labour, and a deprivation of all converse with any person. For the second offence, the person was to be branded in the hand with the letter H, to suffer imprisonment, and be put to labour. For the third, to be branded in the other hand, imprisoned, &amp;c. as before. For the fourth, the offender was to have his tongue bored through with a red hot iron, imprisoned, and kept to labour until sent away at his own charge. Any person who shall attempt to defend the sentiments of the quakers, shall, for the third offence, be sentenced to banishment. But these people, (continues the author from whose Geography the above is quoted) who have been so much censured and ridiculed, had perhaps as many virtues as their posterity; and it would be wise in the moderns, who stand elevated on the shoulders of their ancestors, with the book of their experience open before them, to improve from their virtues and to veil their faults.â See Morse's GeographyâArticle Connecticut. The fatal course his ancestors had run. Hail, happy mistress of a happy state! With blessings chartered by auspicious Fate; For whom kind Nature, with a liberal hand, From Copia's horn pours plenty o'er the land. Here rural charms with city beauties join, Here art and nature every where combine; The colonnade, the portico, and tower, Rise on the turf that bears a poplar bower; Beneath the shade here Genius loves to rove, And think itself in Academus' grove; Here thoughtful Silence holds her chosen seat, For here no deafening pavements spoil the street; There is not a paved street in the whole city; and the soil being very sandy, the inhabitants are deluged with dust in dry weather, and with mud at all other times. A chaise or chariot here are heard no more Than feathers falling on the felted floor; Here I can write, three stories only high, In such dead silence I could hear a sigh; No thundering carriage shakes the angled roof, Nor steeds affright me with the clashing hoof; No slippery flags the careless step betray, And crack the skull on every rainy day; Here, should you fall, you lose no drop of blood, But safe and soft recline on yielding mud! Say, Heaven-born Truth! say what police you prize, Sordid and mean?âor liberal and wise? What city e'er in arts or splendour shone, Where interest ruledâwhere wealth was prized alone? Where self was all that influenced every thought, And individual profit only sought? Truth answers, noneâand here one instance shows Where liberal, public spirit never rose; The sad effects that on this languor wait Disgrace the mistress of so fair a state. The first question asked a stranger who enters New-Haven by land, is âhave you seen our Long-wharf?â and on being answered in the negative, the vast politeness of âmine hostâ induces him to conduct the gentleman all the way through Fleet-street, to visit this âstupendous fabric of human invention.â If the weather has recently been uncommonly fair, he may traverse its whole extent without sinking deeper than to his ancles in mud. Should the path fortunately be unobstructed by plaster, lumber, or carts, he may, as he leisurely proceeds, enjoy a distant prospect of the waterâsurvey the gallant mudscows and oyster-boats on his left, and a tottering row of old wooden ware-houses on his rightâinhale the fragrant odours arising from the docks, and, finally, arrive at the point which the New-York packets are enabled to approach at high water. After feasting his senses with all these beauties, the grateful stranger returns with his generous guide, consoling himself with the pleasing reflection that the same delightful excursion will be repeated on his embarkation for New-York. Additional Note.âSince the establishment of the Steam-Boat, between New-York and New-Haven, âthings have been managed better.ââ Publishers. No decent pier receives the freighted barkâ A cluttered mud-bank (dangerous in the dark, Of length enormous, at whose timbered side A pigmy fleet of oyster-boats may ride Safe moor'd in mud) is all that bears the name, Or to a pier or wharf can kindred claim. Why does not wealth here bid Industry rise, And from your sisters snatch, or share the prize? Give the clogg'd channel all its former size, And deepen docks by bidding piers arise? So shall fair Commerce o'er your city smile, And wearied passengers lose half their toil, For 'tis no easy taskâto walk a mile. Why do I view these wooden frames arise? Does this bespeak your famed police too wise? Where'er I turn a block of wood appears, Season'd in sun-beams for successive years; A fatal spark, on some disastrous night, Might on the subject throw sufficient light; Then, like a rocket, you for once would soar, Blaze for a moment, and be seen no more! But still the threatening danger you defy, Still bid new piles of cedar kiss the sky! By parsimony you would gain renown, And risk a million to secure a crown! Ignoble maxim!âtear it from the heart, And bid your soil to lasting structures start; The well burnt clay, or yonder bluff, can yield A reference is here had to one of those two rocky mountains which overlook the city from the north, called East and West Rocks, the former in particular supplying very good stones for building. The rugged brows of these wood-crowned heights are tinged with the beams of the rising and setting sun, while the city below is veiled in the soft shade of twilight. A delightful prospect can be enjoyed from their summits, of landscapes beautifully romantic. At once both grace and safety's surest shield: Live not in terror while your interest claims Far fairer fabrics, that defy the flames. Yon spacious âGreen,â the city's boast and pride, This is the public square, situated nearly in the centre of the city, termed The Green. Might still have been a barren common wide, Had not a spirit worthy of the man, Conceived and urged to execute the plan, To screen it from a hackney'd long abuse, And consecrate it to a nobler use. But he's a lunatic!âthen justly own The reverend gentleman who, at his own expense, began to ornament this handsome promenade with a fence, trees, &amp;c. has, at various times, evinced such a spirit for public improvement, as to draw on him the imputation of being a madman That madness here is liberal alone. But say, why is this beauteous promenade, Where Nature glows in vernal vest array'd, Where Art with rapture would the scene have traced, Deform'd by buildings and by tombs defaced? 'Tis not too late to brush the moles away From Beauty's face, and teach her smiles to play; For sacred ashes that have breathed and loved, May be with decent sanctity removed: And where yon grove of youthful poplars bloom, The New Burying place, to which many removals have been made from the Old, by such unprejudiced minds as think it not sacrilege to remove human dust. Transplanted monuments may mark their tomb. When once adopted, habits seldom change, However rude, displeasing, odd, or strange; Hence, when you hear the bell, or knocker's din, No servant comes, some voice exclaims âwalk in!â Perhaps the visiter has only come To leave a card, or ask if you're at home; To beg directions to another door, Or just to tell, âthe chaise will call at four;â No matter what, he may for ever stand Beneath the porch, with knocker still in hand; 'Tis still âwalk in!â from some interior room Beyond a passage veil'd in deepest gloom; Here he must grope his âblind and erring way,â Fall o'er a chair, or through the entry stray, Till, sad mistake! he gains the cellar door, And tumbles down a dozen feet or more. An accident that actually happened to the unfortunate author, who must consequently be supposed to write feelingly on the subject. A stranger, who arrives to tarry here, Excites distrust, inquiry, hope, and fear; Slander awakes, and Fame her trumpet plies, Credulity extends her ears and eyes, While swift around the secret whisper goes, Till busy Rumour hatches âthree black crows.â This story is humourously told by Dr. Smollet, and is too familiar with every reader to need repeating here. The strange proboscis, though of mammoth size, Sterne tells us of a man who entered Strasburg with such an enormous nose, that the whole town was thrown into confusion. Thro' wondering Strasburg spread far less surprize. His name, profession, stature, age, and hue, The reasons why he bade his home adieu, All pass a female court in critical review. Eliza sips her tea, then with a smile Should any individuals imagine themselves alluded to, or pointed at, in this picture of New-Haven tea-table chit-chat, they will surely have, the goodness not to blame the poet. For every person he professes a due respect, and for the fair sex, in particular, he entertains a most devout affection. But as he has, through mere politeness, invited Truth to accompany him on his present little excursion, (as he has frequently offered a play-ticket where he expected its non-acceptance) he cannot, without deviating from etiquette, reject her unfashionable precepts. The unpopularity of this goddess in New-Haven, is most certainly no fault of his. Sweet as the damson which she tastes the while, Informs the party, what they long to know, The name, and so forth, of the stranger beau, Whose novel manners gave so much delight To all at Bloomfield's ball on Monday night. âO, cries Amelia, 'twas to Adelaide âHis whole attention and respects were paid, âShe knew his name, and if the truth were known, âI think, prefers it far above her own; âWhat could he see in her, a very child! âOr she in him, to be so soon beguiled?â Jane eager answers, âI'll instruct you allâ âTheir first acquaintance was not at the ball, âBut, as I live, on Sunday he was seen âGallanting her to church across the Green; âYou'll laugh to think how odd the fop must look âBearing her parasol, her fan and book! âAnd bowing, as they parted at the doorâ âNow, did you ever hear the like before?â âO monstrous!â cries Amelia, âwhat disgrace! âHow could the girl in meeting show her face? âBut after hearing love-tales, I suspect âThat S?????'s sermon had not much effect The reverend M. S?????t, who like St. Paul, relinquished the study and practice of the law, to assist in the promulgation of the gospel; but who has unfortunately smothered great wit, sagacity and ability, in the melancholy consideration of the calvinistical dogmas of election, atonement, and predestined damnation. âOn simple Adelaide, whose Sunday's walk âWill be the topic of the city talk. âHer coxcomb, too!âwhat has his breeding been, Perhaps in no part of the civilized world is good breeding so much talked of, and so little seen, as in New-Haven. But this fault, if it is one, is more attributable to heads than to hearts. âTo have such folly by the public seen? âAnd at the assemblyâdid he think us brutes? âFor, how ridiculous! he danced in boots!!! â'Tis whisper'd, tooâand I believe the tale, âHe left his native state to 'scape a jail! âAndâkeep the secret closeâupon my life, â'Tis known too well he left behindâa wife!â The scandal fliesâand ere the victim knows, He finds himself encircled by his foes; The fiend in bulk increases as she flies, And swells his crimes in multitude and size; âA base deserter from a dozen wives!â And had his reputation twenty lives, Beneath their venom'd shafts 'tis sure to die, They pierce his bosom, and he wonders why; But, worst of all!âa luckless maid is doom'd To view, with his, her spotless fame entomb'd. Ye sprightly fair! New-Haven's highest boast, Abroad the wonder, and at home the toast, Renounce one fault, and lay resistless claim To sweet perfection and eternal fame. The soul-expressing, soul-inspiring eye, The nectared lips that with the ruby vie; The witching smile that o'er the visage plays, And bids the fancy in delirium blaze; The dulcet tone which rapt attention greets, Breathed through a channel of unrivall'd sweets; The sprightly step, the graceful, modest mien, Where all the charms that fascinate convene, Are soon eclipsed, when prejudice and pride, With jealous envy, in the breast reside. Then better prize your charmsâbid mental grace Superior lustre lend the speaking face; Renounce vile SlanderâCharity pursue, And angels may conceive of envy too. Some such are hereâO how superior they! As blaze of noon surpasses infant day. Yes, the proud boast is yet, New-Haven, thine, External grace with mental charms to join. For while the grateful theme employs my muse, A sister-goddess she delighted views, Who pensive moves, with downcast eye, along, A lovely contrast with the gayer throng; A temper, gentle as the glassy lake When zephyrs scarce an undulation wake, Shines sweetly through the azure of her eye, Charms in a smile, or interests in a sigh. How lovely, when a melting tale of wo Heaves her fair breast in mounds of virgin snow, Or from her eye the crystal tribute calls, Which, lingering on the brink, reluctant falls, And on that cheek where softest crimson glows, Rests like a dew-drop on the blushing rose. How soft her accents, gentle, winning, sweet; Envy is silent and her snakes retreat; The child of Nature, with unsullied heart, Improved, refined, but not restrain'd, by art; Its ebullitions know no false disguise, They flow from truth and rapture as they rise. Soul of my song! my song should build thy fame, Dared my fond muse but lisp thy dearer name; But ere her fingers kiss the trembling wire, The âghosts of former joysâ untune her lyre; The sighs of Sorrow murmur as she sings, And Memory breathes discordance o'er the strings. Too delicate the theme.âMy muse, forbearâ Divert sad Memory with a livelier air; More subjects yet remain for blame or praise, New-Haven yet demands the poet's lays. Your Fasts and Sabbaths undisputed claim The meed of reverence and religious fame; Of these the muse with due respect would sing, Nor let one wanton note disgrace a string; Then may not Malice construe wrong the strain, Nor dare reproach her with intents profane. The streets deserted, silence reigns around, Uninterrupted by the smallest sound; Till the loud signal from the âOld Brickâ tower, Given by Claus, proclaims the solemn hour; In quick response two other fanes begin, With âbrazen throat and iron tongue,â the din; In measured time the tones salute the ear, (For e'en bell-ringing goes by method here) The Brick, and Blue, and Church, the chorus swell, While raptured Echo answers, âding! dong! bell!â Still not a passing foot-fall can we hear, Not e'en a mouse dare in the street appear, Till, at the second peal, from every door, As from the Trojan horse, the legions pour, Marshall'd, and clad in Sunday's gay attire, From span-high infants to the hoary sire; New-Haven grace and beauty now are seen, With pensive, measured step, and solemn mien, Led by their mothers o'er the dewy Green. Beauty, secluded from the vulgar gaze For six long, tedious, and unhallowed days, Conspires to raise and solemnize the scene; For âangels' visits, short and far between,â Must sure impress the soul with thoughts divine, While adoration bows before the shrine. But, on this day, no anxious lover dare The âblue-lawsâ of Connecticut (so called from the colour of the paper on which they were printed) have never been repealed, though they are not, at this day, strictly observed. While this ridiculous code was considered in full force, it was almost sacrilege to betray any marks of tenderness or affection between the sexes on the Sabbath. A gentleman happened to return from a long absence at sea on Sunday, and so unexpectedly, that he first met his family on their way to church. Overjoyed at the happy meeting, he imprudently embraced his wife on the spot, and imprinted on her lips a kiss of connubial affection. Good Heaven! What consternation filled the breasts of the gaping multitude at seeing this unprecedented enormity! The ladiesâmodest things! how they blushed! and the gentlemenâhow they stared! Every eye was at once directed to the proper authority, and, in mute eloquence, implored redress. Suffice it, that so flagrant a violation of the law was quickly punished by the vigilant police, and the hapless husband condemned to pay a heavy fine. Confess his flame, or e'en salute the fair; But, bliss supreme! he treads where she has trod, And meekly follows to the house of God. All enter thereâthe streets again are clear, Deserted dwellings show an aspect drear, And any honest stranger would engage 'Twas owing to the yellow-fever's rage. And is there now one being not at prayer, Besides myself?âI thought each soul was there; But yonder walks a man, with club in paw, Who seems to bid defiance to the law; Onward he moves with majesty of pace, Walks thro' each street, and searches every place. What would he do?âAh! by his looks, I fear He'll rob a dwelling while the coast is clear. But see! he stops and gazes with surprise, While pleasure sparkles in his eager eyes! O tell me, Truth, what this strange man delights. Is he an author?âfor, behold! he writes; Some brilliant thought he wishes to retain, Just popp'd by accident within his brain. âNo, Truth replies, his task is thus to stray, With book and pencil, on each holy day, To see if any (but himself) shall dare Evade the law, and walk in time of prayer; Their names he notes with secret heart-felt joy, For rich reward awaits his curst employ; The hapless wights the enormous fine must pay, To appease the law and mend the broken day; The pious Doctor then absolves the sin, Tips half the feeâthe rest attorneys win.â Justice, indignant, hears the shameful tale, Sighs for her sword, and points to Satire's scale. The mail arrived last nightâbut, here must stay, Nor can proceed another step to-day; No stage-coach wheels must dare profane the roads On Sabbath day, with their ungodly loads. The anxious travellers must tarry too, Though dying friends may bid the world adieu; Business of moment may their presence claim, Sickness and death, or love's impatient flame; 'Tis all the sameâthe law demands their stay, Wherever be their hearts, their lips must pray. Despatches, too, of highest moment, wait, While merchants suffer in the neighbouring state; Gazettes, that tell the rise and fall of stocks, Rich-freighted vessels stranded on the rocks, Or safe arrived, when fear pronounced them lost, To save a ten-fold premium's serious cost, Which Monday's sun will see despairing paid, Occasioned all because the mail is staid. And are these regulations made to prove How dearly you Religion's precepts love? Are there no selfish viewsâno interest here Conceal'd beneath her mantle?âYes, I fear Throughout the whole, when all this fuss is done, Like others, you âtake care of number one;â For you are gainers, though the world may loseâ Have one whole day's advantage of the news, And speculation being still your trade, How many pious fortunes thus are made! Inn-keepers, too, by this, increase their pelf, Each traveller must eat, or starve himself. But now, o'er western hills, the god of day Salutes the city with his parting ray: Tired of his journey, he retires to bed, But scarce the watery couch receives his head, Ere suddenly, as if enchantment wrought, The scene is changed as quick as human thought; Bustle and noise, labour and sports begin, In Connecticut, with the Presbyterians, Sunday commences at the setting of the sun on Saturday evening, after which moment, labour and sports are suspended till the same period on Sunday, when they are renewed with increased ardour. This custom has, however, varied a little in New-Haven since the laying of the embargo; as this evil was thought to be a judgment of Heaven, they have adopted the plan of attending divine worship on Sunday evening, thereby hoping to avert such a curse in future. And Silence startles at the direful din. Enough of satire.âThere are many here Whom I must ever love, respect, revere; And actions, too, that merit lasting praise, Beyond the efforts of my humble lays. Yon fair enclosure, where untroubled sleep This beautiful spot deserves a particular description; and travellers who may pass through this city are invited to visit it, with the assurance that they will never regret an hour so employed. The New Burying-place is situated at the northern extremity of the city, just far enough removed from its noise and bustle, for retirement and calm reflection it is perfectly level, carpetted with the richest verdure, and is divided into lots, of suitable dimensions for large families, by a slight railing. At the head and foot of each lot grows a tall and flourishing poplar; so that the whole has the appearance of a beautiful shady grove, with spacious alleys, intersecting each other at right angles, happily calculated for ambulatory recreation. Every lot is distinguished by the name of its proprietor painted on the railing that marks its boundaries, and the progress of the art of sculpture shines conspicuous in the elegant marble monuments that adorn it. The stones, tables, and urns, are all white, and in a moon-light evening produce a very interesting effect. The lengthened shades of the poplars, the chequered gloom, the aspiring monuments, the waving grass, and the sighing breeze, all conspire to fill the mind with sensations of awe mingled with an indescribable pleasure. Hearts that have bled, and optics wont to weep, Invites my footstepsâthither let me rove, Where sculptured stones adorn the poplar grove; Where graves, and urns, and epitaphs appear, And ask the little tribute of a tear. Come, gentle muse! awhile consent to stray Beneath this gloomâfor at the close of day, With downcast eye and interesting tear, Sweet, pensive Melancholy wanders here. O how I love to see a due regard Paid to the dead, as in this hallowed yard! Where decent order over all presides, And the rich sculptured stone the mourner guides. Hillhouse! 'twas thine to give the dead a place The Hon. James Hillhouse, Esq. who appropriated this spot for interring the dead. Adorn'd by art and nature's every grace; To call their ashes from chaotic heaps, And fashion order where the victim sleeps; For this alone (if this were all thy fame) Shall grateful honours gild thy lasting name. Here while I stray beneath this poplar gloom, Friendship demands a tear for yonder tomb; Where, freed from all the cares that life attend, Reclines fair Virtue's and the Muses' friend. Francis Kidder, printer, who died in the autumn of 1807. His typographical brethren, as a testimony of their affection and respect, erected a handsome stone to his memory, the first one in this place lettered in gilt: it has since, however, been copied by many others. When first these grateful scenes allured mine eyes, He taught me where to rove, and what to prize; When pensive Vesper led the starry train, And Cynthia's splendours mark'd the eastern main, Here would we ramble, while the sighing breeze Waved the tall verdure and disturb'd the trees; Weave in our converse threads of moral thought, And scan the truths surrounding emblems taught; Then with warm ardour dart our rapid view Through present clouds to scenes of brighter hue; Anticipated joys we hoped to share, And in imagination revell'd there; Laid future plans of happiness and ease, When Love and Fortune would unite to please; With rapture dwelt upon the grateful theme, And with regret dismiss'd the waking dream. Yes, 'twas a dream! and I remain to prove That both were shadows, promised wealth and love, Whilst thou wert call'd from visionary scenes To real pleasures and eternal greens, Ere sad Experience taught the cruel truth That shadows only tempted ardent youthâ Kidder! 'tis mine to wish that Heaven's decree Had snatch'd us both from this tempestuous sea, That life had ended ere despair begun, And, as below our hopes, above our joys been one. Retired from sepulchres and âstoried urns,â The muse to yonder Seminary turns; Yale College was founded in 1700, and remained at Killingsworth until 1707, then at Saybrook until 1716, when it was removed and fixed at New-Haven. It has its name from its principal benefactor, Gov. Yale. There are at present eight college domiciles, three of which, each one hundred feet long, are inhabited by the students, containing thirty-two chambers each, sufficient for lodging two hundred students; a chapel forty by fifty feet, with a steeple one hundred feet high; another edifice for the library, &amp;c. of the same dimensions; a dining hall sixty by forty feet; a house for the president, and another for the professor of divinity; the whole pleasantly situated west of the Greenwhich is spread before it. Magnific pile, where architective grace Shines in each fabric that adorns the place; But where exterior beauty but enshrines Far nobler treasuresâLearning's richest mines. Cradle of Genius! here my willing muse The tributary lay with joy pursues; Obsequious here the song she fain would raise High as her theme, and give deserved praise. But, ah! her humble efforts sink below The rich encomiums Justice bids bestow; With diffidence she dares attempt the strain Which classic bards may hear with cold disdain; Fearful before Apollo's sons she sings, Whose more harmonious lyres Minerva strings. First, with meek reverence would I enter where Yon spire denotes the edifice for prayer; Access is mine, the willing gates unfold, And Yale's assembled sons mine eyes behold; Our future statesmen, patriots, bards, divines, For whom bright Fame the fadeless laurel twines, Are here convened, and in each youthful face Their rising greatness Fancy fain would trace. Say, are not here some souls that restless burn, On life's great stage to take an active turn; To rise, the awful pillars of the state, And rival ancient Tully in debate? Some who possess a portion of that flame That gain'd our Washington immortal fame? Others, whose philanthropic bosoms glow To shine like Franklin in relieving wo? Whose philosophic souls his fame inspires To wield the thunder and direct its fires; To soar, on Learning's wing, through trackless space, View countless orbs and all their movements trace, Govern'd by order and unchanging laws, And in effects behold the Eternal Cause? Some glowing with a Homer's living fire, Design'd to âwake to ecstacy the lyre,â To bid Columbia's future fame arise, And rear Parnassus under western skies; Here fix the temple of the tuneful throng, And rival Albion's boasted sons of song? Or are not here some destined yet to shine, With cloudless lustre, in the desk divine; To wake the soul, and guide its feeble view To Him who made, and can its form renew; Recal the wandering wretch, his course restrain, And gently lead him to the fold again; Arouse the careless, and support the weak, And gospel truths with voice unfaltering speak? But, see! what dignity! what ease and grace, Combine in him who fills that sacred place! Renown'd divine! to thee my lays aspire, Dr. Dwight, president of Yale College, and professor of divinity; a great scholar, profound divine, and celebrated poet. Thou reverend minstrel of the epic lyre! Whose tuneful numbers, when thou didst them roll, Portray thine own, and rap the listening soul. But when within the sacred desk you stand, And raise the eye devout, and spread the hand; Or, from that holy book, expound to youth Precepts of Heavenly evangelic truth; What soul will not enthusiastic glow With warm devotion as thy accents flow? What heart can cold, inanimate remain, And let thy matchless reasoning plead in vain? Hail, sons of Genius! youthful sages, hail! The glory, pride, support, and boast of Yale; Your country's ornaments aspire to prove, And grace the spheres in which you're call'd to move; So shall your Alma Mater rise in fame, And deathless honours decorate her name. And here the muse bewails her hapless bard, Whose cruel fate such golden prospects marr'd, For Hope once whisper'd to his ardent breast, âThy dearest, fondest wish shall be possess'dââ Unfolded to his view the classic page, And all its treasures promised ripening age; Show'd Learning's flowery path which led to Fame, Whose distant temple glittered with his name. Illusive all!âthe phantom all believe, Though still we know her promises deceive; Chill penury convinced the wretch, too late, Her words were false, and his a hapless fate. How many minds, that govern now our fates, Rule o'er the nation, or direct the states, Were fashioned here!âthe warrior and the sage, And worthiest statesmen of the present age; Bards like our Trumbull, Barlow, Humphreys, Dwight, John Trumbull, Esq. the author of a poem, in copious wit, second only to the cantos of Butler; and in vigour, dignity, and sweetness, superiour to the âpassing worth of Sir Hudibras.ââWhen the politics of âM'Fingalâ are forgotten, the poem will be read, repeated, and admired by every lover of the jocund muse. This poem, comprising four cantos, was published in 1734, and has since passed through several editions. âThe Progress of Dullness,â âElegy on the Times,â and several other fruits of his genius, adorn the annals of American poetry. Joel Barlow, Esq. commenced the career of life by pursuing the more flowery paths of literature. His âVision of Columbus,â his local and satirical poems, and above all, his admirable âHasty Pudding,â have conferred on him a degree of celebrity to which few American bards have attained. While in Europe, he published, among other pieces, âThe Conspiracy of Kings,â which has been repeatedly published in the United States. Colonel David Humphreys, the friend of Dwight, Hopkins, Trumbull, Wolcott, Strong, and Barlow, was a distinguished star in this constellation of geniuses. The âAnarchiadâ is said to be the joint production of these poets, whose primary design was to chastise the promoters of measures hostile to good faith and sound policy, which were, at that time, every where pursuedâthe American Republic being then united but in name. What first drew public attention to colonel Humphreys as a poet, was his âAddress to the Armies.â His next publication of any note was his poem âOn the Happiness of America.â This was followed by his âEssay on the Life of General Putnam,â and by his tragedy, entitled âThe Widow of Malabar,â translated from the French, first played in May, and published in August, 1790. A poem entitled âIndustry,â published in Philadelphia, in 1794, was his last production of note, and the author has now retired to his seat at Humphreysville, where he has established an extensive cloth manufactory. Dr. Dwight's first poetical publication was the âConquest of Canaan,â an epic poem, in eleven books, printed in Hartford, in 1785, and reprinted in London the next year. In this work the lover of poetry will discover many passages highly poetical, and will probably read the eleventh book with pleasure, more than once. The versification, for uniform correctness, has seldom been surpassed. In 1794, he published, in New-York, his âGreenfield-Hill,â a poem in seven parts, which, three years afterwards, was also reprinted in London. Besides these, he is the reputed author of many smaller poems, and several exquisite pieces of unrivalled merit. Who thrill the soul with rapturous delight; And essayists grave, or politicians wise, Who feel like Webster, or like Dana rise; Chauncey, the firmest pillar of our laws, And Daggett, eloquent in virtue's cause. With hundreds more the muse could grace her verse, And bid her lyre their various worth rehearse, But these sufficeânor must her measured strain Swell to more lines than these small bounds contain. Eve shuts her windowsâlet me now advance Where the sweet viol leads the mazy dance; Here Pleasure warms the heart, and lights the eye, While bounding pulses to the music fly; Here Grace and Beauty hold their happy court, And raptured Fancy e'er delights to sport. How innocent, how rational is this! Where health receives new flush from virtuous bliss. Hence, all ye sordid cares that peace destroy! Here bosoms only feel and throb to joy; Sacred to Pleasure is the present hour, Nor Hate, nor Envy dare approach her bower. The sweetest art of all considered fine, Is yet, New-Haven, exquisitely thine. There is another source of joy, design'd To please the senses and instruct the mind, To you unknownâfor Prejudice denies, In this famed state, what liberal tastes must prize. I mean the stageâ(the moralist may start) I mean the stageâimprover of the heart; That holds the mirror up to vice and crime, And âshows the form and pressure of the time.â Why is the drama in this place suppress'd, The treat with which your sister states are bless'd? Why, here alone, are minds of taste deprived Of all the joys from scenic arts derived? For you, where Prejudice still holds her reign, Has Shakspear wrote and Cooper lived in vain. That blear-eyed monster is the deadliest foe That Learning, Taste, and liberal Arts can know, And here extends her sway:âO drive her hence! And wake to Candour, liberty, and sense: But, ah! I urge in vainâit cannot be, Candour and âsteady habitsâ won't agree; An age must rollâa century must waste, Ere you attain your sisters' arts and taste. But, though an infant, Taste can here be found, Array'd in flowers, her brow with garlands crown'd, And, when gay Flora's blush the town arrays, In Mix's arbours she delighted plays; The Columbian Gardens, kept by Mr. Mix, proprietor of the Museum, may be considered the only resort for rational recreation. Here, on a summer's evening, is sometimes convened a brilliant assemblage of beauty, taste, and fashion. Wantons along the winding paths, or treads In sportive gambols o'er the rosy beds; Peeps through the foliage of the blossom'd trees, That freight with sweetness evening's balmy breeze; Her glowing temple animates above, The Columbian Museum, the rapid progress of which, towards perfection, reflects great honour on the taste and industry of Mr. Mix, is justly styled âThe Temple of Taste.â And bids the wax discourse, the canvass move; Swells Grief's bright tear in fair Columbia's eye, The Genius of Columbia is represented, in wax, weeping at the tomb of Washington. And teaches Music's breath to sweetly sigh. How happy, once!âhere I could careless stroll, And feel no sorrows preying on my soul; In yon alcove have mused, reclined and mute, Or breathed my feelings through the pensive flute; Stray'd through these alleys, in yon arbour sat, Quaff'd the rich juice, and join'd in Friendship's chat; Here Love, too, sometimes heightened every joy, When smiles and roses only deck'd the boy, Ere disappointment barb'd his harmless dart, And Avarice tore it from my mangled heart. New-Haven!âsource of all my former joys! The demon, now, that all my bliss destroys! In you I view, with just, impartial eyes, All that I love, and much that I despise. Though you affect Religion to revere, Her noblest precept finds few votaries here: Sweet Charity, fair offspring of the skies, You know not, feel not, have not learn'd to prize; Truth bids me speakâwhen I the past review, I know not, feel not, charity for you; Who, when ye see Misfortune on the chase, Let loose a pack of Slander and Disgrace; Hunt the poor wretch till he must yield and die, Or, pierced with Censure's teeth, ignobly fly; As is the timid hare, by rustic clown, Drove from her form, pursued, and hunted down. Myself, a timid being, eager sought Your famed retreat for liberty of thought, The term of âsteady habitsâ lured me here, And Love detain'd for, one short happy year. But stern Misfortune, by one cruel blow, Blasted my hopes, and laid my prospects low; Then as a fiend lank Poverty pursued, And, huntsmen like, the cruel sport you view'd; âThe game in view!âhark, forward!â was the cry, And, gash'd with wounds, the wretch was doom'd to fly; His strength exhausted, he despairing fell, And bade to Hope, and Love, and all, farewell! Was't not enough he bow'd beneath the storm? But must you trample on his prostrate form, Torture, and view him writhe beneath the smart, Murder his peace, and tear his bleeding heart? O cruel malice! source of his despair! âA wounded spirit who, alas! can bear?â O who can tell what struggles rack'd him here? Who count each bursting sigh, each falling tear, That forced their passage from his aching breast, When torn from prospects that had made him blest? Forbear, my muse! nor dare the dangerous theme, Recal not back the past illusive dream; Let dark Oblivion shroud it with her veil, And in meek silence blasted hopes bewail.</field>
