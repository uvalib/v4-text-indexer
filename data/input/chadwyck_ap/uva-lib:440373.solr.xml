      <field name="fulltext">NOT A GRIN WAS SEEN Not a grin was seen, not a giggle heard As the Tutor breath'd his last Not a Freshman uttered a jesting word At the thought of labours past. On his old black board they laid him down His head on torn [?] Algebras propping While the light of his whiskers shone around As they curled for want of cropping. Not a coffin was given the Freshman's pest Nor a hearse nor a cart was found him But he lay like a tutor a taking his rest With the loves [?] of his life around him. TO THE SNOWDROP Sweet Flower when winter drear Spreads o'er the cheerless earth his blighting wing, Thou com'st to tell us better days are near And bid us look for joyous spring. Emblem of hope that speaks of future mirth Dearer to me thou art than any treasure, For thou dost teach there is no grief on earth That is not mix'd with pleasure, Sooth'd by the memory of happy hours And hopes that years to come may yet be crown'd with flowers. NO DEEPER, NO MORE FEARFUL CURSE No deeper, no more fearful curse can be Entail'd on man than a too tender heart A heart alive to all the witchery Of love and song, yet destined to a part In life's great Drama which, Oh God! will sever His dearest wishes and his duties ever. GEM OF BEAUTY! Gem of Beauty! Lovely star! Shining dimly from afar, Struggling faintly with the cloud Whose misty folds thy lustre shroud, Now emerging forth to sight Lending thy soft ray to night, Fading now, like childhood's bloom On the border of the tomb, Bursting the dark veil again As spirits rend Death's feeble chain, Dear Enlivener of the gloom Like thee oh! may it be my doom To struggle with the tempter's art When clouds beset my weary heart, The bondage of the grave to break And in unsullied glory wake. THE DREAM OF THE LOCK I dreamed I clasped a silken curl Of mingled gold and brown; And oh! twas like the sunny rays That streamed so brightly down. I wist it was some elfin sprite All beautifully fair; Who bathed her brow in pearly dew, That wore the glossy hair. But then I heard a silv'ery voice, Soft as the gale at eve,â It murmured in my list'ning ear 'Twas bright Genevieve, How wild the joy that filled my heart And danced in every vein; Like laughing rills, whose leaping course Their banks can scarce contain. But ah, the scenes of love and joy That gladden in a dream:â They shine as bright they pass as soon As ripples o'er the stream. LIKE THAT SOFT LUSTRE Like that soft lustre on the [deep?] When day and night have met Or flowers which winds have bent and keep Their beauty yet, Like showers that fall from sunlit clouds Upon a sunlit earth, Like that bright bow which takes from light, And gloom its birth, The glance which trembles in thine eye Appears to borrow, Its hue from both extremes and shifts From joy to sorrow It cannot be that thou hast known Night posts [?] in tears, not sleepâ Yet why? the loveliest flowers have tears And skies must weep. SONNET IF ALL TRUE VIRTUE If all true virtue was a fever glow For action, Sister, then might'st thou lament A powerless frame and means below content: But think, our acts are but the outward show. Except they spring from forth the parent heart As naturally as sweet flowers from Earth, Either to God or man they have no worth. One of their highest ends is to impart Knowledge of that which lies within the breast, The Principle which is their life and cause. And that is [in?] thine eyes made manifest And in thy loving voice. Thy Being's laws Have I not own'd, when in the dark unrest Of Doubt, some holy scruple gave me pause? FORGIVE IT, LADY Forgive it, Lady, tho' it stand alone, A sober strain thy sober thought to' engage, 'Mid the gay tokens with which love hath strewn Each verse-inscrib'd, or Fancy-pictur'd page. Fear naught that would repress the warmth of youth, Bedim one smile or check one rapturous tear, Not the austerest worshipper of Truth Could give to censure these memorials dear. An humble influence is theirs: They are The sacred tributes of frail clay to clay, I would as soon condemn the single star Which cheers, but not illumes, the Wanderer's way. If I could thus disturb thy guiltless hours Or crush one happy feeling in its birth, How should I dare to love the fragrant flowers, How gaze elately o'er the glad green Earth? Enjoy the passing bounties of the year, Let Nature, for thy bliss, conjoin with Art, I would not have thee miss one pleasure here Which may be welcom'd by a kindly heart. Only, recalling evermore how few The moments which to mortal joy are given, Strive to unite the beautiful and true And fix thy treasure and thy hopes in Heaven PERFECT LOVE Love me, dearest, love me Marie, If thou wouldst be happy still, With the same complete affection With the heart and with the will, With the trustingness and power, With the meekness and the strength, Thou didst lavish on my childhood But my folly lost at length. Oh! believe me that the surest Way to happiness and rest Is to keep the feelings changeless Which a youthful impulse blest. So the flowers we used to gather, So the stars we used to love, Still shall seem to bloom as kindly, Still shall prophecy above. Go forsake thy old companion, Go forget his former worth, Let the vow preserved in Heaven Be a slighted thing on Earth. When thy new-form'd friends fall from thee, Thou shalt think of these again, Where will be thy past to cheer thee, What will be thy future then? Separated, separated By the Lethe stream of change, From the gardens of thy childhood, There shalt thou no longer range. In the presentâMarie, hear meâ In the moment of thy woe, Must thou seek the only solace Which a faithless heart can know Grant thy new-found friends be constant, Grant them all I pray they be, They will glitter [?] and be joyousâ Never sympathize with thee. Living only in thy present, Knowing only what thou art, Ready play mates in thy pleasure, Not associates for thy heart. Never Marie, never Dearest, Be thy life divided thus, So shall earth seem always lovely, And the stars be kind to us. Still to be serenely happy, I repeat the truth again, Should the present, past and future Constitute one perfect chain. For the joy of life is measured Not by isolated years, Hope should lend her eagle vision, Memory should bring her tears. One harmonious strain of music, Thenceforth life would be complete, Every note suggest the other, Harsh connected with the sweet. Love me Marie, love me ever, Love me all my love is worth, Let us worship God together And together walk the earth. Then when we would reckon, dearest, How much bliss is in our hearts, We may add to past and present, What the hope of Heaven imparts. MY COUSIN LOU! My cousin Lou! a soft name truly To give a lady so unruly, Whose every action proves to you She should be call'd mischievous Lou. Offended! âmille pardonsâ sweet elf I'd rather have to stand myself Th' artillery of Rosa's eyes With naught to pay her back but sighs, Than thus alas! to anger you And hence I'll style you cozening Lou. For your quick glance betrays dear maid Your aptitude for such a trade. I'll suit you now my Queen of arts, They say you've broken many hearts, That gallants at your frowns look blue, (They must mean green) Oh cruel Lou! Well obstinacy will triumph And I must give up to you. Humph! So if a late consent will do Your humble servant Cousin Lou. MISCHIEVOUS! GEORGE IS OUT HIS SENSES Mischievous George is out his senses Or else his cranium very dense is, I cannot call her aught (can you) But pretty, simple, quiet Lou. Her eyes soft glances that betray Quicker than flies the solar ray The stainless thoughts that glow within A bosom never known to sin, He calls a covering to cheat As if chicanery could look sweet He's felt your wit [?] (has he not Lou?) And in his spite would slander you. And if she's broken many hearts 'Tis not I'm sure by fulsome arts, And if she keeps her-own still whole 'Tis not that she's in want of soul, But like the flowerâwhose fragrance mild Induces the delighted child Its spotless folds to leave unharm'd Her virtues pitying Love disarm'd. Thus in her excellence secure Could Cupid blight a bud so pure? And with those witching beauties too She always is the modest Lou. Merit like this before his face To yield consent with such bad grace! I'd give my all (some two three sous) To style herâonly Cousin Lou. WHAT ATHENS DULL What Athens dull thou maudlin [rake?] If ten long faces once could make A city safe as Moses spake, I can't tell where, When threaten'd loud with fire and flake For badness sair, Sure then three of the bonniest lasses With winsome forms and gleesome faces As e'er spurn'd artful paints or laces To make their beauty A second trio o' the graces Should teach your duty STARS MAY HIDE THEIR GENTLE LIGHT Stars may hide their gentle light From the Wand'rers anxious sight, But the clouds that intervene, Glow with their reflected sheen, Lending a soft lustre still To the darken'd vale and hill. Far within mysterious woods, By the leaf-o'ershadow'd floods, Nestled in some favourite tree, Mock birds pour their notes of glee To the thoughtful Poet laid By the rill adown the glade. Thus would I forever dwell In some solitary cell, While beyond my quiet hearth Should my songs be heard on earth Warbling hopes of peace to those Who have sought, nor found repose SONNET âWELL I AM GLADâ! âWell I am gladâ! the first dear words that fell Upon my soul like some familiar strain, Breaking the silent witchery of the spell Her eyes had wov'n about my heart and brain. Like the low murmurs of the ocean shell That softest breathe from sea when most remote, Those trembling accents still around me float, And calm the fears not even her smile could quell. They have to me a meaning deep as tears, Wide as the rainbow circle of her life, Reveal the bliss of past and present years And the pure hope with which her heart is rife. Ah! may it tooâthat casual phraseâbe long In Earth and Heaven the burthen of her song. ISABEL A brow whereon the calm of thought Like sunlight over snow is wrought, The blest result of cheerful moods, Won from the quiet solitudes Of thy still spirit, flowing not From outward things, And independent of the lot Which fortune brings, A beauty and a nameless grace Which captivates but not beguiles, And in thy heart and o'er thy face, A bliss too deep for smiles; Such charms can hardly appertain To grief mortality and pain, And these are of the earth, But only visitant below, And come to cure or banish woe, Thou art of Heavenly birth. So at least my fancy deems, So thou appearest in my dreams, But a love-light in thine eyes, Shining oftentimes thro' tears, Like a silver-veil'd sunrise, Or a dew-dimm'd flower appears, But thy rarely breathÃªd sighs, And still more the low replies Whisper'd yesternight to me When I lowly question'd thee, Prove thee beauteous Isabel, If not thine celestial worth Yet a maiden loving well, Yet a perfect child of Earth. If mutter'd spell, or magic wand Were mine for one brief hour, And it were blameless to command With supernatural power, The treasures of the land and air, Each wonder and each splendour there, I would twine a wreath for thee Half of stars and half of flowers, And the latter should not be Cull'd from amaranthine bowers, But grove and garden mead and field, A fitlier tribute should bestow, And emblematic honours yield To decorate thy brow. Thy twin perfections thus exprest, The human love, the saintly rest, The heart to God and virtue given, Yet faithful to a lowly hearth, At once a glory for high Heaven, A blessing to the hearth, The world should then acknowledge thine A soul all other souls above According by a law divine It's [sic] worship and its love. AS THE LAST BEAMS OF STARS As the last beams of stars long lost still mark their former sphere Enlivening with delusive light the interlunar air, The charms which play'd upon thy cheek, and brighten'd o'er thy brow Have left their lustre in my soul and smile in memory now. Nor are they false creations wrought from Fancy's treacherous wiles Dead tokens of our meetings pastâweak copies of thy smiles, True as the heart that holds them they with life and grace adorn A second image of thyself within my bosom born. The blush thy presence kindled and the love that blush confest Is mantling on my forehead yet and glowing in my breast, Like odours tangled in the breeze, I treasure in my heart Each lovely thought and gentle hope thy beauty could impart. Those thoughts are like thy spirit pureâfaint shadows of thy own. Those hopesâoh! need I tell them? live within my breast alone, Yet both are cherish'd equally, both burn with equal strength For both bring memories of thee, though the last may fail at length. LINES WHEN YOUTH'S FIRST WARMEST HOPES When youth's first warmest hopes have perish'dâ Friends ardently and dearly cherish'dâ Like flower-buds gather'd in the morn Ere half their loveliness is born, The wound is deeply felt indeed, And inly does the bosom bleed. But other sources of delight, Stars hidden far within the night, Break forth to gild the passing cloud, Whose dim and solemn folds enshroud The calm pure light of happier days The future from the aching gaze, Until the very cloud is made A brightâthough melancholy shade But hearts which have lived on together Through stormy night and sunny weather, And like sweet sister flowers have long To the frail stem of friendship clung, Till thought and joy and life are wound That cherish'd stem's existence round, Oh! not for such hath Hope one smile Or earth a beauty to beguile That weariness of soul which blights As soon as dream'd the days delights When Death the only spring hath froze From which those dear delights arose. Said I that Hope possess'd no power To light the darkness of that hour? Ah! no fair Deity I wrong The sweetness of thy magic song, When thou hast made its glorious theme No visionary earthly dream, When brightest scenes of heavenly blissâ Earnests themselves of happinessâ And thoughts first born on Calvary play Through the low murmurs of thy lay. Yes let such strains thy numbers speak The breaking heart grows calm and meek, To God's unerring will resign'd Again the calm contented mind Looks forward to that happy day, When even thou wilt lose thy sway And present pleasure be too deep To wake desire for those that sleep, As stars within the day light pale, Behind Eternity's bright veil. SENTIMENTALâVERY Live for thee! why yes, as dying Would scarcely suit me at the present, (I've so much need of breath for sighing The loss of it would be unpleasant) In that I'll âdo my devoirâ well And liveâas long as possible. A FIG FOR THE CRITICS! A fig for the critics! I write not to those Who are seeking for beauties but them that possess them Who will never reck how the melody flows So it murmurs their praises and meritsâGod bless them. And suppose all my verses devoid of the [?] Of which the bard-killers are evermore vaunting, The light of a bright beaming eye will suffice To throw on the page all the beauty that's wanting. So a fig for the critics who prose in Reviews! Let others risk sense for their adulation, A soft heart for my judge, a dark eye for my muse I shall win, however I write, admiration CHOICE IN EYES Some adore the soft blue eye Where Cupid in concealment sly Ready lies to wing a dart On th' unwary sleeping heart, Others love the darker hue Which never condescends to woo, But with its glances fiery warm Carries hearts as if by storm. The dove like brown, and searching gray Hath each the lovers of its ray, The Hazel eye delighteth many But a kind one pleaseth any. For me whatever be the dye, The blue the black the hazel eye, If it on me sweetly smile 'Tis my favouriteâfor a while. When it frowns I break the spell Another'll suit me quite as well. SIX MONTHS'S SUCH A WONDERFUL TIME Six months's such a wonderful time For Chloe to smile on a lover, All deem'd she was playing the mime At least till the six [sic] month was over. And then alas! it was found 'Twas but that another was failing, That Chloe so long had not frown'd On the youth who for weeks had been staling From my heart I pity the wight Who's next to be cheated to loving, And made to believe one so bright Could never be guilty of roving. For he too will prove I'm afraid That vows of eternal affection Only mean with the changeable maid Some five or six weeks' predilection FOR HIGH HONOURS For high honours care I nought, Fame is ever dearly bought, Care too oft accomp'nies treasure, Give me a life of love and leisure. I THOUGHT THY NAME I thought thy name had lost its power Thy charms forgotten too, Our love what yon bright cloud will be Ere falls the evening dew; That eve'n the memory of that love With all its happy hoursâ Its smiles and tears its doubts and hopes Had wither'd with these flowersâ The flowers thy fingers twin'd for me The last last night we met, Alone, beneath the watching stars To vow and thenâforget. Alas! a favourite song has brought, By some mysterious art, The red blood to my changing cheek, The passion to my heart. The passion to my worn, worn heart, The red blood to my cheek, Regrets my pride is sham'd to own, Sad thoughts I may not speak. She look'd and sang so much like thee I fancied every tone Of that impassion'd melody But echoes of thine own. Thy own rich voice so often heard, In the low tones of love, When morning blush'd upon the sky Or Evening gloom'd above. Upon her cheek and brow I saw A nameless feeling play, As voice and glance grew softer with The meaning of the lay. And thus when words had failed to tell The love within thy heart, In music and in song wouldst thou That love's deep truth impart. Oh love forsworn and broken troth! Which made that cherish' [sic] vow A present griefâa pleasure pastâ A theme for memory now. TO CULL THE CHOICEST FLOWERS OF SONG To cull the choicest flowers of song from Fancy's laurel'd bough And wreathe, in one immortal lay, a garland for thy brow, I may not hope as long as love is limited in thought To that one radiant dream with which its inmost life is fraught. The golden fields of Poesy, oh! never could I roam Whilst in the shadow of thy soul, mine own may find its home, No glory there could emulate the image in my breast Like sunlight on a sable cloud on that dark page imprest. Yet flowers there are which deck the paths that love and passion tread, And such as I may gather shall encircle thy young head, The meanest the the noblest forms may often lend a lightâ Were Earth not gladden'd by their smiles, would stars appear so bright? Thou wilt not then, Sweet One, disdain the tribute which I bring, Nor cast the tender'd lay asideâan unbelieved thingâ And if, at times, a passing thought thy souls clear mirror shade, Of him who humbly at thy feet that humble off'ring laid, Think of him but as of the tones woke by the passing breeze, When, in its odour seeking flight, it woos the trembling treesâ A cloud that for a moment caught the radiance of day, The rose once heaving on thy heart, now cast in scorn away. WE WALK'D BENEATH THE SHADOW We walk'd beneath the shadow Of pines that moan'd around, The dank grass rustled to our tread, And frost was on the ground. The moon rose dim above us And sombre clouds conceal'd Each star that should have witness'd The love that night reveal'd. But in our trance we heard not The whispers of the pine, Altho' they mingled with my words And marr'd the tones of thine. Thy passion was too ferventâ My heart too true to fear The meaning in that darken'd sky The warning on the air. And still in hope unconscious We wander'd through the gloom, Nor thought one passing moment Upon the waiting doom. And still with heighten'd pleasure I listen'd to the vow Which pledg'd that faith forever Thou hast forgotten now. A LIGHT UPON MY PATHWAY GLEAMS A light upon my pathway gleams And flowers that never glitter'd there, Spring up beneath those sudden beams The long and dreary waste to cheer. That light is darted from thine eyes Those flowers are hopes forgotten never, And secret tears and heartfelt sighs The dews that cherish them forever. [TO ARABELLA] SONNET I Bell! if that old exploded creed were true Which made the bright stars arbiters of fate, What a long heaven of bliss might I and you And all who love like us anticipate! For oh! how could they prophecy of woe, Those mild forgiving stars that lend their light Even to the clouds enshrouding them from sightâ Like goodness smiling on a treacherous foeâ And through the long dark night are ever shining Alike on joy and hearts in sadness pining. Why life would be a path ornate with flowers Darken'd, it may be, with some transient showers, But they would be of April, only given That Earth might not become too much like Heaven. [Sonnet] II And do they not dear Bell! in sooth possess One half the power of which old legends tell, An influence to hallow and to blessâ Calypso's wand of love, not Circe's spell. Look on them in their beauty as they shower Smiles on each other light upon the earth And joy and peace on all of mortal birth, And then deny them life and love and power Oh! we at least should yield them sovereignty For the same stars shone on our natal [h]our, An earnest that our hearts shall one day be Folded like leaves within one lovely flower, To bloom and fade togetherâSweet, with thee This were indeed a glorious destiny. [LINES] THIS MORN, THRO' MANY A PLEASING SCENE This morn thro' many a pleasing scene, In sun and shade, my course I held, A weight of grief upon my heart Which could not be dispell'd. In vain I sought to catch the joy That seem'd to move in leaf and flowerâ The breeze came to me from the fields, But with no soothing power. Birds fill'd the air with noisy songs, The Squirrel leap'd from bough to boughâ There was no cloud in heaven to throw That Shadow on my brow. What secret influence was there To guide my thoughts, dear Babe, to thee, And give relief I could not find In Nature's kindly glee? The Stream that wander'd by might well An emblem of thy life impart, But even its music fail'd to stir The fancy in my heart. That there are sweet similitudes, I know, betwixt the flowers and thee, Yet while a thousand flowers were nearâ Not one occurr'd to me. I only know that unannounc'd Thy image glanc'd across my mind, And like a transient sunbeam pass'd, But left no gloom behind. SONNET ALL THE LONG DAY All the long day, the restless storm had kept A ceaseless moan of wind and fall of rain; But now, the wearied winds and waters slept And Beauty bask'd upon the earth again. In joy I issued forth beneath a sky Bright with the setting sun's reflected light And clouds exhibiting a gorgeous sight Of tower and temple to the astonish'd eye, Chang'd, as I look'd, to hills and mountains capt With golden huesâawhile I gaz'd enwrapt;â But oh! felt then beyond expression blest, When vanish'd mount and hill and shadowy dome And every cloud, that glitter'd in the west, Took airy shapes that mock'd my thought of home. SONNET MARY! I DARE NOT CALL THY CHARMS DIVINE Mary! I dare not call thy charms divine, But all the sweetest qualities of earth Which constitute an humbler holier worth, Grace, gayety and gentleness are thine. A grace more glorious than the grace of form And moulding less thy motions than thy mind, A gayety not thoughtless or unkind, Wild and yet winning womanly and warm. A gentleness of heart that is not weaknessâ Persuasive, potent, beautiful in meekness. Only at times in some excited hour A flash that lights the darkness of thine eyes Reveals a secret and a deeper powerâ A spirit he has hardihood who tries. LINES TAKE BACK THE RING Take back the ringâbut I demand Before the gem again may shine A star upon thy snowy hand The heart that once was mine. Take back the ringâbut I require Each tender or impassioned thought, The burning sigh and glance of fire With which that ring was bought. Take back the baubleâis it worth All that to thee was gladly givenâ The gem is but a star of earth And love a star of Heaven. THREE COUSINS First there's the pretty dark eyed Louâ A mischief loving nymph she's tooâ With wit as quick and heart as true As ever flash'd Or heal'd the wound her sharp tongue threw On beaux abash'd The second is a fairer Queen Of hearts and arts than e'er was seen The fairies of the moonlit green Are naught to Rose, And where that eye's blue glance has been, Adieu Repose. But of the third I've naught to say Her name should never grace a lay That limps so bad, yet by my fay, I would give much Aye let her steal my own away Her heart to catch. THE BEAMS OF THOSE EYES The beams of those eyes first melted my heart, But oh! when to thine it was press'd The ice of thy soul its chill did impart So 'twas frozen again in my breast. SWEET IF YOU DEEM Sweet if you deem I but pretend to sigh That all my oft breath'd vows are fleet as air, Turn thee and gaze in my impassion'd eye, And see thine image back reflected there. Yet even that evanishes you say Should we alas! for one brief moment part, True Love but then it only goes away To be daguerotyp'd [sic] upon my heart. THE BREEZES THROUGH THE WOODLANDS MOAN The breezes through the woodlands moan Another echoes back the sigh, The Sun upon his course is gone But planets tend him through the sky The leaflet bends before the wind 'Tis upheld by the parent tree, The lark breathes out his morning Hymn, His mate joins in the song of glee, All things in sympathy rejoice But my poor desolate heart hath not an echoing voice. Oh like that breeze were it alone To sigh where bloom no flowers to kiss, And like the sun compell'd to move His mighty path companionless, The tender leaf lopp'd from the bough That withers on the ground and dies, The hapless bird whose mate is dead That solitary sings and flies, Like these my course in life must be Once and still worship'd One, with out a smile from thee APOLOGY TO TOM FOR MALTREATING HIS âFRIENDâ If it be true as I have often heard, (And this has prov'd its author has not err'd) That âfellow feeling makes us wondrous kind,â We could not wonder that thy heart inclin'd To aid thy hapless pet and kindred brute. But Tom forgive us that we scorn'd thy suit, Hogs may be very pleasant company But we had one already Tom in thee. SONNET IN THE DEEP SHADOW In the deep shadow of the woods to lie When to the music of the zephyrs dance The rustling leaves, and through its canopy Of branches wov'n to gaze with earnest glance And raptur'd soul on the cerulean sky That far off spreads serenely its expanse, And there, forgetting earth's realities, To dream of peace and love, this this is happiness Alas! 'tis only there that these are found, Felt in the hush that falls upon the heart Heard in the answering melodies around Where thousand voices unattun'd by art, Pour forth the love that thrills in every vein Of Nature's breast, Affection's sacred fane. SONNET HOW MANY YEARN TO TEAR ASIDE THE VEIL How many yearn to tear aside the veil That kindly overshades Futurity, The hidden sea on which our barks must sail With breezes fair or foul as it may be, To gain or lose the port, who can foresee?â A fool's desire, there may be much to dread Beyond that veil, and wouldst thou have it known That all thy hopes may soon be overthrown? Blue skies above me, but a mist ahead, I care not wish not that it should be rent, The moveless calm at present 'round me spread A courage to my timid heart has lent, And I will onward steer with fearless soul Though storms divide me from the long'd for goal. OH! MAY THY DESTINY BE HAPPY EVER Oh! may thy destiny be happy ever Thy life like an unruffled stream glide on, By storms disturb'd, by clouds o'ershadow'd never, Bright with the blaze of one undarken'd sun. MY HEART WAS GAZING INTO THINE My heart was gazing into thine As thou wouldst in a mirror fair And oh! what thrilling joy to find Its very self reflected there SWEET LET NOT OUR SLANDERERS Sweet let not our slanderers witness that tear 'Twould be but a gem their tales to adorn, As 'twas envy alone that dictated the sneer, Why, as we are the envied let's treat it with scorn. Let them talk of the prudence of selfish forethought We'll cling (shall we not) closer still as they prate, And tell them âTime's stay can never be bought Go enjoy the heart's love whilst 'tis not too late! LET V?Y PRATTLE Let V?y prattle meddling S? [?] growl, And all their listeners disapproval scowl Well can we laugh at their sage becks and nods Whilst we're in favour with the God of Gods. ACROSTIC [TO ANNE WADDEL] Around thee, Love, shall blessings always hover; No sorrow such as racks this heart of mine, No slight no doubts thy nature's kindness smother; Eternal unmix'd happiness be thine. Where ever thou mayst be thy loveliness And grace of soul and form, the [sic] friends shall win, Design'd to bless, thee man in turn shall bless, Dealt kindly with by time, unknown to sin Even Death, the tyrant Judge of mortal's doom Low at thy feet shall crouch, and waft thee gently home. LATE THE HOUR Late the hour as I lay gazing With an earnest glance, Where the star of love was blazing Through the dark expanse. âLovely planet give a token, If the power be thine, That her vows are yet unbroken, And her heart still mine.â Brighter seem'd the planet to me Than before to shine, As in answer it would show me That her heart was mine. I turn'd me to the light clouds fleeting O'er the starlit sky In thousand transient figure's meeting To the gazer's eye. Form'd like two hearts link'd together, One appear'd above Sailing as calmly through the ether As glides an hour of love. Now I know, cried I, delighted By yon welcome sign, That she keeps the faith she plighted And her heart's still mine. I DREAM'D THAT IN A SECRET NOOK I dream'd that in a secret nook Where all was silent save a brook That coursing through the chequer'd glade By turns in light, by turns in shade, Laugh'd out as if in conscious glee That it was bounding nigh to thee, We two from every eye conceal'd Our long long hidden love reveal'd. Thou wert reclining carelessly Beneath an oak tree's canopy Which shelter'd from the noonday's heat, Whilst I was kneeling at thy feet And pouring in thy willing ear Words which thou wast well pleas'd to hear. I vow'd eternal love for thee Thy sighs and blushes answer'd me And softly breath'd into my heart What language never can impart. Thy hand was somehow sunk on mine Immediately 'twas clasping thine, And every glance I turn'd on thee Was met by one as kind to me. T'was but a dream, it rests with you To prove it false orâmake it true. OH! IF SHE THINKS THE CORD TOO SLENDER Oh! If she thinks the cord too slender Which has around my heart been twin'd, Say little Cupid, won't you lend her A chain that willing heart to bind, Whose strength not even she can doubt Nor ever fear it's wearing out. Without a murmur then I'll let her Imprison it within her breast, Nor mourn the closeness of the fetter That holds it in a jail so blest. But mind! as pledge to keep it whole Give me hers prisoner on parole. TIRED OF THE CRUEL SPORT Tired of the cruel sport of shooting darts With never failing skill at human hearts, Cupid resolv'd on some one to bestow His power of causing happiness or woe. So he broke his leaden shaft and threw it down, Thy power he cried belong to Anne's frown. The golden arrows from the quiver's tie Releas'd, he plac'd in Anne's laughing eye. WRITTEN IN A PSALM-BOOK What! must I not confide in men? I'll ope my heart to woman then, Make her the guide-star of life, On her my every hope I'll fling, To her in trust forever cling For solace in this world of strife. THERE IS I KNOW NOT WHAT ABOUT THEE There is I know not what about thee That makes me almost wish to flout thee, But then there's something, I regret me, And I know what, which will not let me. WHILST I ENJOY'D THY SMILES Whilst I enjoy'd thy smiles, Oh Love! I never dream'd of sorrows nigh, But fondly rank'd thy joys above The purer pleasures of the sky. When others told me, there was grief That lay in wait to check my bliss, I laugh'd and cried in unbelief, âWhy! love itself means happiness.â But now my incredulity With deep and heartfelt sighs I rue, For absence doubt and jealousy Combine to prove the warning true. I TELL THEE, LOVE I tell thee, Love, when once ignited With virtues fed by worth incited Nor time nor doubt nor slight will smother, And this I thought thy heart would prove thee And banish all the fears that move thee That I can ever love another. Thou wert the first who in my breast That Passion rous'd which steals the rest, But in its 'stead brings sweeter pain, Thou wert the first, shalt be the last, For when Hope's one bright dream has past, Who oh! who could love again? This will not pass I would believe, Thou art no false one to deceive A heart that trusts so well in thee; And if thy trust but equals mine All doubts and fears thou wilt resign And âlove and live for only me.â [LINES] OH! MARIE THINK, SO MANY YEARS Oh! Marie think, so many years As I have numbered more than thou, So many years as past ere I Loved as I love thee now, So many weary years I lived I[n] utter thoughtlessness of thee, So many weary years thou wert An unknown star to me. And yet how lightly beat my heart, At least I know 'twas seldom sad, And when we are not wholly blest, 'Tis something to be glad. How Marie this could ever be I really cannot understand, No more than how a flower should bloom In some dry desert land. Unless indeed the joys I felt Were mystic glimpses from above, Dimly prophetical of thee And promising thy love Dear heart! I now remember well How oft I seemed to breathe an air, A more etherial medium than The common atmosphere. And dreams would comeâI dream'd not whenceâ My heart would throbâI guessed not why, And sometimes when I felt no pain A tear bedim my eye. Philosophers explain these signs By some cold metaphysic reasonâ They do not know the tokens which Precede a pleasant season. Marie! it is my calm belief And so must thou opine with with [sic] me, That never joy sustained my soul But took its power from thee. And all my pleasures in the past Still pointed to my present bliss And pleasure never had been mine Had fate denied me this. AT NIGHT WHEN ALL IN SLEEP ARE STILL At night when all in sleep are still Save the heart that knows not glee, And the wild sad notes of whippoorwill Are echoed from tree to tree When in her silvery loveliness The queen of yon azure sea Looks down on this world of grief and bliss, I think of thee Dearest I think of thee. At noon when the busy tide of life Is flowing uncheck'd and free And sounds of woe and joy and strife Mingle discordantly, And sights that gladden aye the heart Are present to the e'e, Or to the soul a gloom impart, I think of thee, At all hours my thoughts are of thee. I'VE HEARD, STILL DEAR ONE I've heard, still Dear One, thou hast said Thy soul's affection should be measur'd, By his the flame who lit and fed, In whose deep heart thy love was treasur'd. That when his eye glanc'd cold on thee, Or turn'd on others its warm light, Thine too should gaze indifferently, And be to him as [blank] as night. Ah! that thy breast no warmer feelings thrill, Yet hads't adhered to it, thou wouldst have lov'd me still. FOR YET THY CHARMS RETAIN THEIR SWAY For yet thy charms retain their sway Resistless on my bosom's throne, Whil'st my poor influence dies away And leaves all dark and void thine own. Still as the Ghebers lowly bow The image of their their [sic] God before, When night with dark and sullen brow Has frown'd him down the western shore Of Heaven's vast and vaulted height, So my true love is thine in thy affection's night. LADY I DEEM'D NO SPOT ON EARTH Lady I deem'd no spot on earth So dear as that which gave me birth, No smiles so solacing as came From her who bears a mother's name, No love so strong our griefs to cure As that which warms a sister pure, Till I saw thee in beauty crown'd, When in those eyes' dark depths were drown'd Each other feeling, passion, pleasure, Which was not thine, my brightest Treasure. Yes, Dearest, yes! where e'er thou art There is my home there dwells my heart. FRAGMENT OF A DREAM Methought we walk'd alone Within a deep but yet not gloomy grove Where naught save falling leaves and breezes' moan Broke on our words of love. Thy hand was clasp'd in mine, Thy deep dark eyes in kindness turn'd on me Beaming with love ineffable, as shine The stars on sleeping misery. DIVISION OF LOVE'S EMPIRE Fair Cupid's arrows once gave out, He scarce knew what to be about But wander'd sad and listless ever Lamenting o'er his empty quiver. The hearts of men impervious grown Mock'd at his erst-revered throne Till the boy maddened by their slights Resolv'd somehow to win his rights, And having a fine ready wit Right soon upon a scheme he hit He flew to seek on earth the maid Who first in beauty was array'd, Nor long sought he but found inâ The one well suited to his plan. In sooth so lovely did she seem She look'd the creature of a dream Save that the rising of her vest Proved that the spirit heav'd the breast. Now he proceeds to work the charm With which h'intends himself to arm. He took from out those shining wells Of soft'ning sympathy the cells The tear that flows at âsorrow's taleâ Down the blanch'd cheek of beauty pale The dew from off her honied lip Which angels would delight to sip The smiles that light her countenance When starry hopes before her dance And placed them in his little palm And mix'd with them the sighs of balm That heave her rising bosom meek The blush that stains her damask cheek He then threw in to color it The composition made he lit It in the sparkles of her eye Brighter than than [sic] the noonday sky Warmer than the solar gleam Softer than a vesper beam Then snatch'd one more delicious sigh From the dear maid to waft it by. Now sallies Cupid forth in glee The virtues of his charm to see And sooth it did work wondrous well None could resist the magic spell But every heart to him did yield And every youth before him kneel'd Young love once more resumes his reign And lords it over men again But grateful gave one half his sway (Andâretains it to this day) To her whose potent charms restor'd An empire to its rightful Lord. A LITTLE SPOT OF DINGY EARTH A little spot of dingy earth The red coals glowing on the hearth A fossil or a flower, The beauty of the âcommon dayâ Would send his fancy out to stray In field and grove and bower. No house in that wide town I ween Presented such a wondrous scene Of lovely shapes and hues, Tho' deck'd with every costly gear, Than did the humble dwelling where He dined on books and stews. Whatever might be brought from far, From lands beneath the Northern star Or by the tropic seas, Bird, beast, or flower or butterfly, He had a skill'd collector's eye And lover's heart for these Shells colour'd like the evening sky, And gorgeous plumes of various dye, And beauteus [sic] stones were there, Nor these alone, but many things, Some with, and some that had not wings, More curious than fair. Here by his side a kitten slept, There hairy caterpillars crept O'er treasur'd tufts of grass, Stuff'd owls look'd thoughtful on the shelves And playful squirrels saw themselves Within the looking glass. Except the charms of day and night, He ne'er had seen one lovely sight, And he had never heard The music of the woods and streams, Nor heard, except in nightly dreams, Free song of breeze or bird. Yet was he not to Beauty dead, And volumes diligently read Brought visions of delight,â They taught him how to dream of these, Of mountains, rivers, plains and seas And Ocean in its might. Man has not power to darken all That decorates this earthly ball, And in the stars above, The mists and changing clouds he read Lessons, on which his spirit fed, Of the deep power of love. And of the most familiar things, Without the aid of magic rings, Could build a mightier scene Than, in the days when elf and fay Like common travellers stroll'd the way, Sprang from the famous bean. A knot of grass would seem a field, Now some recess for birds to build A solitary nest, A tree would represent a wood, The smallest pond become a flood With ships upon its breast. Oh might some God in happy hour But grant me that Protean power Which prov'd Ulysses' skill, Sometimes to clothe one's self with wings, And be a thousand lovely things With ever sportive will; I'd beâwhat would I be?âthe bird Fame tells so oft at Evening heard In groves how far away, And thou shouldst lie in thoughtful ease Beneath a canopy of trees, And listen to my lay. I grant the wish is somewhat trite, But if you read my verse aright, You'll pardon it again; It suits, dear love, a present case, And lovers scorn no commonplace Which makes their meanings plain. My song should be of glades and bowers, Of rustling leaves and waving flowers And of the sparkling streams, Of love enjoy'd without its pains, Afar from all the world contains To falsify its dreams. The clouds that deck the setting sun, Or float around his course begun, Should add their influence, And Heaven with all its starry throng Be mingled in the varied song And lend a deeper sense. Whatever else may harmonize With smiling lips and glancing eyes And love of gentle heart, The music of the woodland springsâ All bright or calm or happy things Their gladness should impart. Nor measur'd note nor chosen word Should in the flowing strain be heard It's purport to reveal, As stars commune with stars above, The silent sympathy of love Should teach thee all I feel. Alas! at this prosaic day, One might consume a life away Ere such a wish were granted, Not even in thoughts dare we be free, Our thoughts have lost activity, And lifeâmore life is wanted We're bound to Matter Space and Time Our progress is in sin and crime And bodily enjoyment, Communion with the spirit land Died with the last inventionsâand Sweet love's an old employment I know that in the present state Of man, regret is out of date For such mistaken joys, And, in the next love-lines I trace, Practical sense shall find a place With all its splendid toys. I will return to Earth again, Clasp falsehood in my armsâabstain From old-world sentiments, Give up the dear old rhyme to âhearts,â Talk of improvement in the Arts And touch on the percents. NO WIND, NOT EVEN A FLUTTERING BREATH SONNET I No wind, not even a fluttering breath had given Apparent motion to that land girt bay, Still as the stagnant soul, the water lay Sombre beneath the starless cope of Heaven, Save where it met the shore, or rippled 'round A few worn trunks that near it stood upright, And thereâbroke into sparkling lines of light Making a faint and yet not mournful sound. An image, mused I, of our changeful life! Dark must their course be ever, who repose On joys [?] of sense, dead to all active good; If happiness were rightly understood, It would be won with struggles and with blows: Our brightest moments are struck out in strife. [Sonnet] II Such were my thoughts or rather such my fears For one brief moment of mistrusting grief, Fears that have not become a fixed belief In the still progress of some happy years. True that an active life gives wider scope To all those virtues which renown command, But do not hearts at peace best understand Their earthly duty and their heavenly hope? If skies are brightest when few clouds are there, And the vex'd wave bear stars upon its crest, Go view that wave beneath the day at rest; Only the wood or hill-embosom'd mere Sleeps in eternal calm, by storms unriven Fill'd with the image of glad earth and Heaven. LET NOT THESE HARMLESS JOYS Let not these harmless joys invite Thy censure, Reader; nor excite A self-complacent mirth, For thus he nurst no worthless love, Which serv'd to lift his thoughts above, Yet bind him to the earth. IMAGINE IF YOU CAN A BARNYARD SCENE Imagine if you can a barnyard scene With all its feather'd inmates cackling loud A nursery let loose upon a green A drunken or electioneering crowd A wife and husband quarrelling over tea A troupe of monkey's [sic] chattering on a tree And you will have some idea of their singing [?] THE HUNGRY OWLET HOOTS MELODIOUSLY The hungry owlet hoots melodiously At fall of eve in some deep hidden dell, The creaking wagon lumb'ring slowly by Makes cautious concert with the donkey's [bell;?] Refused their sugar children sweetly squall But oh that Buss! it far excells them all. TWO LILIES ON A BROKEN STALK Two lilies on a broken stalk Two willows down a lonely walk Two stars when languishing away As night is trembling into day Such are ye dear ones in your sorrow And the gloom which clouds your morrow May find its type in all that we Behold of brief mortality. FORGIVE ME THAT I DARE TO TRACE Forgive me that I dare to trace For thee once more the votive line, As yet thou keep'st thy wonted place Within this throbbing heart of mine; Forgive me Lady, to the mind Rack'd with disappointment's throe Lost the bliss for which it pin'd Silence is the deepest woe. And before I break the chain Clasp'd so fondly to my breast, Ere to love thee was a pain Which robs the soul within of rest, I would ask thee, why that brow Frowns where it was wont to smile? Was the soon forgotten vow Only spoken to beguile? Say, did Time's relentless wing This deadly blight to love impart, Before it had outliv'd the Spring Which bade it blossom in thy heart? Was it coward Slander's tongue, Trafficking in vulgar lie, From thy breast esteem that wrung, And chill'd the glances of thine eye? Perchance thou didst but seem to love, Perchance anotherâ'tis in vain Why [?] speak when I have ceas'd to move! I cannot wake the flame again. I will not seek one pitying tear To ease the wound which time may heal, Smile on in triumph, I would ne'er That thou should'st prove what I must feel I might recall that hour again When drank my words thy thirsty ear, But Pride commands me to refrain, No weak reproaches shalt thou hear. Take the pledge to me thou gavest When absence sorrow was to both, And he whom thou in coldness leavest Never doubted of thy truth. Take it,âit was wont to gladden Every fibre of my heart, Now alas! 'twould only madden With the thought that we must part. Fare thee well forever now How well I lov'd thou canst not know When we meet again it will not be With the quivering lip and brow With which I used to look on thee. Not with the soul enrapturing sigh That heav'd my breast when thou wert near, No! my fix'd and changeless eye Shall prove thou art no longer dear. THE ROSE THAT BLOOMS The Rose that blooms and blushes in the bower Turns kindly to the nightingale alone, And Rose the maid typified by the flower In undivided love is all mine own. SONNET THE SPRING, THE SUMMER The Spring, the Summer; Autumn, Winter wild I love them all, and though they never stay Their onward flight, yet like a fickle child I find in each some charm to take away The vain regret that steals upon the heart That these with all their joys so soon depart. And thus I would it were with Friendship, Love, When these brief blessings perish, why should we Weep o'er the change? Why should we never prove That like the seasons Love alternately May sicken die brighten and burn once more Till the false Present smilesâas days of yore When language was Truth's echo, and the breast A home where joyous thoughts alone found rest. IN BOWERS OF EASE In bowers of ease, Unseen, Resistless Power Thompson [sic] creates a fancied realm for thee Where pleasure cheaply bought beguil'd the hour And lazy wight withouten boisterous glee Might easy live, ne die of ennui But in our Carolinian atmosphere We feel thy force in sad reality, And all thy ills without thy pleasures rare Weigh us poor mortals down, cooped in the school room here. TO LOVE All other themes will I disown, My strains, sweet Love, are thine alone And who shall chide? thou hast been long The Poet's dream, the Poet's song, And he who has not prov'd thy fears Enjoy'd thy hopes and wept thy tears, Can never claim the name of bard, Or win one sighâhis best reward. All other themes will I disown My strains, sweet Love, are thine alone. The Muse whose whisperings inspire The breathings of the Poet's lyre, Speaks in the beating of the heart, And 'tis its feelings which impart That touching pathos to his strain Which Art may seek t'excel in vain And Love has been for ages whole The first emotion of the soul, Whose dulcet breath wakes tenderly The heart's Aeolian melody. All other themes will I disown, My strains, sweet Love, are thine alone. I can admire fair Nature's sheen, And where a violet has been, Or rosebud throws its spells around I deem the spot is holy ground. But when I meet an eye of blue, It seems to me of richer hue Than ever deck'd the little flower Of modesty in summer hour, And the proud rosebud's deep'ning flush Is nothing to a maiden's blush. All other themes will I disown My strains, sweet Love, are thine alone. The stars that deck heaven's canopy Like snow-white pearls in ebony, The silvery moon whose tempering light Softens the gloomy brow of night, Are wondrous fair, but fairer far Than silver moon or jewell'd star The glance which tells without a word The lover's suit is not unheard. All other themes will I disown, My strains, sweet Love, are thine alone. The wanton wind that sighs among The âgarden's bellesââa countless throngâ The dew that glitters like a gem On the flower-Queen's diadem, Let others praise, the tear that wells From the spirit's glistening cells, The kiss that takes that tear away Shall be the subjects of my lay. All other themes will I resign My strains, sweet Love, are only thine. GOD BLESS THEE THEN! God bless thee then! and thou wilt share with me, The Desert's solitude, a hermit's lot, Oh! I will deem the desert blooms like thee When thou and Love may deign to bless the spot. And we will stifle, in heart-swelling sighs, The ruder sounds of terror and affright, And with the rapturous tears that dim the eyes Hide ought that might appal or pain the sight. BEHOLD THE YOUTH Behold the youth whose mighty mind Leaves all competitors behind! He translates Latin, thinks in Greek, Well-nigh as fast as one can speak. SONNET FOR AN ALBUM Lady! I've turned these pages o'er and o'er, Rejoiced to see the many tributes given, To one who would be innocent in heavenâ Ah! might I dare to add one tribute more! Cold hearts may notice here imperfect lines, But I would sooner criticise a dreamâ For while affection constitutes the theme, Flowers have no leaves inscribed with fairer signs. Therefore I sayâwell pleased I read how love Hath glorified the pages of thy book, With meanings sweeter than thy last sweet look, And passionate as pureâso may thy worth Always receive its recompense on earthâ God will ensure its recompense above. ODE THE BREEZE THAT NOW BLOWS The breeze that now blows from our beautiful Isle, Wafts the white sail of peace o'er the bay that sleeps yonder; And the ocean creeps up with a kiss and a smile On the beach, where our maids and our youth love to wander. Yet, brothers! 'twas there, amid battle's red glare, That our forefathers won the proud emblem we bearâ The same breath that now wooes the dear lips that we love, Bore the smoke of that fight to the calm skies above. If the homes that we cherish are happy and free, If the fame that was left us is stainless in story, If the winds that come to us across the blue sea, Blow over a land that is dreaming of glory, 'Tis to them that we owe the pure blessings we know, And the night that now sleeps in default of a foeâ It sleeps, but shall wake at the first signal-gun, And the sons will preserve what their fathers have won. SONNET LADY! I WILL NOT WRONG THY WOMANHOOD Lady! I will not wrong thy womanhood, By crowning thee with praise which is not thineâ I see thee lovely, and I think thee good, But yet no angel, and not all divine. For on thy brow, and o'er thy beauteous faceâ As manifest in sorrow as in mirthâ There is a most bewitching look of earth, And all the dearer for the mortal grace. Aye! thou are earthly, and so tender-meek, That I might deem much love doth make thee weakâ Did not at times, in some excited hour, A flash that lights the darkness of thine eyes, Reveal a secret and a deeper powerâ A spirit he has hardihood who tries. LINES THERE WAS A FIRE WITHIN MY BRAIN! There was a fire within my brain! I did not mean to give thee pain. I looked, I spokeâI know not whatâ I loved, and feltâthat thou did'st not; And I was madâperhaps was weak, The consciousness is on my cheek In blushes hot as molten lead, And tears I blush as hot to shed. God! that I could not hide my shame! But needs must bare my heart of flame To hearts so cold and minds so tame. Aye think me weak, and smile with those Who saw and jested with my woes. Such still has been, such still must be The doom, the meed of Misery, When Misery permits the crowd To guess the woe it strives to shroud. That night indeedâit was not longâ I had no sense of right or wrong; That night indeedâthank God 'tis past! How could the reckless madness last And I be breathing here! Henceforth I shut within my breast A ghastly and eternal guestâ Its deep and dark despair. And thou and God alone shall know The inextinguishable woe, Intense, unmitigated pain Which weighs on sense, and soul, and brain. Oh, I will carry on my brow, A smile like that thou wearest now, As careless and as gay As if this heart were brimmed with mirthâ And had no cares upon the earth Which earth could not allay. Yet if the smile I'll strive to wear, Should sometimes wither to a sneer, If what I look and what I say, Have aught that's bitter in its play, Forgive it and forgetâ And think I speak not as I feelâ I would not pain, but must conceal And cannot kill regret. Aye think me weak, and yetâand yetâ What eyes have seen these eyelids wet, Though I have wept as guilt might weep When Hell reveals itself in sleep. ODE Composed for the Anniversary of the Battle of New Orleans The land hath many a battle-ground As rich, and red with crimson stains; But Orleans is the very sound To stir the blood in warrior veins: There the young Giant of the world Struck a last blow at England's side; And the Free Flag of Stars was furled Above the grave of England's pride. Than his who led, no sterner will E'er couched within a human breast; And his was human, and could thrill To all that's softest, purest, best. The hand from which the Briton fled, And the bold savage learned to fear, Could stroke a tender infant's head, And tremble at a woman's tear. The Roman of his country's fame, The mighty Consul of the West, No stronger arm, or haughtier name, E'er gained a crown, or graced a crest; Yet the white honor of his life Nor blood could stain, nor power eclipse; And having faced all shapes of strife; He died with blessings on his lips. So long as these bright arms, we bear, May rest all spotless and unproved: So long, we trust our hearts shall share The homelier virtues which he loved. But when the war-blast shall be heard, And other battles must be wonâ Be JACKSON'S name our battle-word; And his great Shade shall lead us on. LINES WE MET BUT ONCE We met but onceâand yetâand yet (O! Truth! thou dar'st not doubt me,) I know that I shall not forget, And she'llâask God about me. My heart!âshe had it years agoâ It seemed so one rapt minuteâ And hersâwhen I arose to go, I leftâa bud within it. Perhaps this happy April day Shall wake that bud to growing, Perhaps the blue-eyed maiden May Shall see it sweetly blowing. THREE PICTURES After the manner of Ferogio Three girls, half-draped, stood by the sedgy bank, Where, mocking with low laugh the noonday sun, A cool stream flowed. Their robes of whitest linen, Swept round their limbs, in large, uncertain folds, Scarce knowing which, of all the varied charms, From the bold day to vail; but 'wildered clung, Betraying all the more what they would hide. One dark-eyed maid, in whose voluptuous form A passionate strength was glossed with gentle curves, Leaned on a rock, and drooped her languid hand Into the waves that rippled in blue rings, As round a floating lily. Her deep eyes, Moist with the dews of maiden longings, gazed Down the still stream, peopling, mayhap, its depths With gorgeous dreams, and visionary shapes Of sensual beauty. Her half-parted lips, Scarlet and wet as some red Orient fruit To its core cleft, seemed oping to the sunâ Rich fruit of Love that burst in ripest hour! Tossed in the wind, her black and chainless curls Waved, like a pirate's flag, from her proud head Defiance to the world! Stooping she stood, With limbs half-quivering in convulsive grace, Head drooping forward, with an unborn kiss Fluttering upon her lips, and long, white arms That, from sheer wantonness, twined round each other! The hot wind, gusty with its mad desire, Snatched at her robe; the while she did not strive To gain it back, but stood, with heaving breast, Proud in the knowledge of her beauty. She Seemed a born Queen of Love. Her glowing form Was but her soul in flesh; a reckless maid, Whose very life was love, but whom much love Could kill, or unrequited love might make A murderess! A blonde the second was. Her simple robe drooped heavily around The form that shone beneath. She leaned against A rough-hewn wall, until her flexile shape Seemed with its own weight bending. Sweet blue eyes, O'erhung with carved white eaves of heavy lids, As hangs the snow-ledge o'er calm Alpine lakes. From head to foot the eye was led along In curves of beauty rich and rythmical. Unfilleted her head, and down her neck Streamed the rich river of her golden hair That on her shoulders broke, and, foaming, fell Into her bosom's valley. One pink hand, Like to some brooch from pale cornelian carved, Clasped her thin robe o'er her rebellious bust, That would be free. The other listless hung, Curled like a sleeping blossom, while her feet, White as the daisies that they crushed, were seen Budding beneath her robe, as if too timid To show themselves full-blown by day. A flush Faint as the earliest dawn was on her cheek. Along the rugged wall she leaned against, The rambling eglantine came clambering, and pressed Its starry blooms close to her face, and brushed The vermeil down with countless honeyed kisses. Above her head, between her and the sun A maple spread its golden canopy; And at her feet a throng of purple flowers, That, night and day, gave all their looks to Heaven, Now turned on her their young adoring eyes. What charm was in the maid! An atmosphere Of pleasure seemed around her, and a glow Soft as the summer's breathed about her limbs, Warming the air, as if young Love were near Waving his ardent pinions! Soft and frail, And with a beautiful humility, She, drooping, seemed to ask from out those eyes, Deep with unfathomable tenderness, Something to love and cling to. She was one Who craved, and not demanded to be loved. With such a woman clinging to one's heart Sorrow were sweet; 'twould be such great delight To watch her calm assumption of one's griefs, As if they were her birth-right. None like her To suck the poisoned wound of circumstance, Or soothe life's fever. Such this nameless maid Seemed in her beauty; slender-shaped and frail, But grand in her capacity for love! Brown-skinned and glossy as a Spanish nut, Lazy and warm, and with rich Southern blood Mantling her full cheeks with a crimson dusk, Like the last glow of sunset when the eve Hath half o'ercast it, such the third fair maid. Each round limb, heavy with an indolent grace, Seemed made for repose. Of chestnut brown, her hair Swept in rich, sleepy tresses round her head, Which, as the wind did stir them, seemed to be Silk curtains darkening round her dreaming eyes. Through the arched portals of her parted mouth Low, broken murmurs came, and went and came, Like talk of sleepers. Gently-waving boughs Made a green twilight o'er her as she sate Swung in a cradle of lithe willow wands Together woven, while a few bronzed leaves Fluttered anear, and fanned the sluggish airs Into faint breezes. Thus serenely passed This maiden's being noiselessly along. The basking earth, the hot, unwinking sun Shone through a haze, and so all brightest things Were softened in her eyes. Her very love Was lazy and subdued as tropic noons In matted palm-groves, where the heavy breath Of orchids, like invisible incense, steals, Drowsing the gloom. Indolence beautiful! Slumber incarnate! Through the parting boughs A poet, listing to the singing reeds, Saw these fair women, and insensibly His fingers stole along his trembling harp, And thus he hymned: âOh! virgins, pure and fair! Beautiful Trinity! Like a music chord, In which three harmonies are blent in one, Ye strike upon my soul. Oh! thou dark maid! Ideal of a Southern rhyme of love, In which fierce pulses of a glowing breast Beat the quick time, and broken trills of passion Intoxicate the brain, and whirl the soul Into mad revelsâgazing on thy form, I seem to hear the clink of castanets; And lo! emerging from the far-off gloom, Floating with sylph-like grace, but human step, Until the air thou cleavest turns to fire, Com'st thou! White, long, and undulating limbs; Round bosom, heaving to the eloquent strain, And arms that weave a white arch o'er thy head, Beneath which thou dost float triumphally! While in thy deep-brown eyes a half-vailed light Burns with a rising lustre! Memories Like these, in which the glories of the South, Its songs, its dances, and its peerless maids Are ever intermingled, thou dost call From my soul's secret shades. And thou, fair girl! Whose golden hair and azure eyes are bright As Freya's when she wandered through the halls Of lofty Asgardâlike some Northern song, In which love calmly floats, thou dost steal in With no wild impulse, but with gentle tones, Twining thy slender chains around the heart, Unnoted till thou hast clasped them there forever! Thou, lotus-bosomed! Houri from the East! Fashioned in mould of Oriental grace; Sunned into ripeness by the virgin light That on thy land first breaks, and taught that Life Is one long stream on which, from night till morn, Thou may'st float calmly, gazing at the stars, Inhaling spicy breaths, and trailing oft Thy small hand through the wavesâthy beauty mingles With the two other harmonies, and makes One glorious chord of beauty, on my soul Striking divinest unison! For thus Hath God ordained it; to the poet's eye All beauty is alike, and ye, I swear, Are beautiful as eve and noon and dawn Shining together on the wondering earth!â TO ANNA (Written in an album) Who hath not sometimes found a leaf or flower, On which were traced, as by some spirit hand, Dim lines that had a meaning and a power, He almost could, yet could not understand. Still those dark signs pleased better than if wrought In letters legible by human art; They kindled fancy, if they roused no thought, And stirred some nameless feelings in the heart. So, Anna, I would have thee always hold, Whatever rhymes these pages shall contain, Dear for the tender love they would unfold, Dear for the wish they may not well explain. The words may tell as little as the flower, And will not always please a critic eye; For few can write with all a passion's power, And none can speak so warmly as they sigh. Yet should'st thou prize them, Anna, far above The well-coined flatteries of a polished art, Each is a trophy thou hast won from love, Each is a tribute to thy kindly heart. A BRACELET Gems have I none to shower at your feet, But I may borrow the bright toys in verse To weave a bracelet for you. These were culled In Cloud-land, and they form the sweetest name That ever graced a loving Poet's song. Mark! as I call them over! There you see Green chrysoprase, and purple amethyst, Rubies and lustrous opals, ligurites Of golden lustre, scarlet idocrase, Blue napolite, and dim and gray that stone, Like the pale skies from which it drinks its hue, The elaolite of Norway! Note the clasp And its device!âa splendid heliotrope Cut like a heart, and spotted as with blood! While in a golden circlet of like shape Three stones are grouped,âan onyx triple hued, And (like a red rose 'mid its wealth of green) A crimson pyrope set in emerald. My bracelet is a quaint one I confess, And to a lady's taste might scarce look well By sunshine, or a ball-room's garish light; Yetâfor the love's dear sake that wrought itâtake And wear it sometimes in your dreams of me. LINES I GAZE INTO THOSE QUIET EYES I gaze into those quiet eyes, But see no passion thereâ They wear the hue of winter skies, As still and coldly clear. It may be they are beauteous books, With noble meanings fraughtâ But I prefer a few sweet looks To worlds on worlds of thought. I know no sounds that fitly mate The music of thy lipsâ But then it carries so much weight The music always trips. I grant that every phrase you speak Is rich with wondrous lore, But like your sister's blushing cheek And tender silence more. And wrapt in dreams of high desire, And dead to common things, You seem just fitted to inspire A poet's visionings; But while your spirit seems unriven By one sweet earthly care, You seem so very ripe for heaven, I wish that you were there. SONNET IF ONE WHOSE NAME If one whose name I may not give to air, With naught to aid her but her woman's art, And the true key of her own pitying heart, Should trace the records I have entered here, The gathered fragrance of one bounteous year; Oh! would she guess, oh! could that heart divine How love beneath each unexplainÃ¨d sign, Hides a wild hope it only speaks in prayer! Alas! the thought is idle! What should teach, In this blank page, that every simple date Calls her to pity or to bless my fate, With tenderer and more passionate demands, Than if with my whole spirit wreaked in speech, I prayed on bended knees, with claspÃ¨d hands! STANZAS IT WAS MY HEART, DEAR FRIEND It was my heart, dear friend, that sung And that imperfect strain Revealed the gloom, but not the grief, The darkness, not the painâ If Heaven depended on my song, I could not sing again. I have nor will nor skill to woo The Poet's golden dower, The breath that swept my spirit was A feeling, not a power. And the breeze that bore its fragrance off Hath withered up the flower. Then ask me not for verse again, Or seek some other tokenâ I sung my last and only song When my one grief was spoken. The heart is aye the Poet's lyre, And mine is almost broken. Once, lady, in my life I stood upon the brink Of the river we call Love, And I bent me down to drink; But the stream ran lightly by, While I scarcely breathed a sigh. Since then I only watched The waters as they run Through the bad and busy world, In the shadow and the sun; And I swore I would not taste, Though my heart should flow to waste. Yet the waves are very fair, And I could not help at times From committing to their sport A few hopes and many rhymes; But they had no certain aim, And brought me onlyâfame. So I strolled along the bank In a sort of vagrant way; And I laughed to view the spot Where the latest victims lay, When, behold! I saw a face In an unexpected place! It looked so bright and frank From its darling little nook, As I paused to gaze awhile, That I flung aside my book, And before the face grew dim My lips were at the brim. And I drank and drank, and drank, And when I looked above The sky seemed full of bliss, And the air seemed full of love, And turn where'er I might I saw that face so bright. Need I say the face was thine? Oh, Lady, could'st thou guess What I cannot all conceal, Yet dare not all confess, Thou woulds't flutter like a bird To my breast without a word. HERE LET ME WRITE MY NAME Here let me write my name As I would write it on thy woman's heart Not with a pen of flame, Nor yet with cold and calculating art, But with a wish to be Regarded, howsoe'er thy life shall wend, Less dear perhaps than many dear to thee But still a cherished friend. But once mine eyes have gazed in thine, But once thine eyes have glanced on mine; Yet, lady! go where'er I will, I have thy face before me still. Why when the star hath passed away, The soul should still retain its ray, I know not who on earth may tell, Unless she can, who wove the spell. If the brief meeting of a night Thus stamps thy image on my sight, I need not ask of maids or men My fate if we should meet again! SONG (A Fragment) Is it gone forever, my gay spring time? Shall I never be as I was then; And this dead heart that once beat so wildly Who shall wake it, can it wake again? From that sea where joy lies buried, shall not Something like its shadow flutter up! The bright wine of life I quaffed so madly, Hath it left no sweetness in the cup! Yet it is not that my youth hath perishedâ If I count by years, I am not old; Of that youth I stripped the buds too early, And its leafless stem is all I hold. Oh! doth no new autumn yet await me? Thus I question Fate, but Fate is mute. Is it autumn? Where is autumn's foliage, And its golden store of luscious fruit?</field>
