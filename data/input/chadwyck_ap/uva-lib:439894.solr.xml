PERMIT me, my earliest and best friend, to offer you this small acknowledgment of my indebtedness; not merely with feelings of affection, gratitude, and friendship, but of veneration. Yours, indeed, JOHN NEAL. Rev. JOHN PIERPONT, Pastor of Hollis-street Church, Boston. PRELIMINARY POEM. 'TWAS night, and the breath of the tempest was near; And her plumes were unfolded abroad o'er the sky; The lightnings were held in their struggling career; And the song of the waters went patiently by. A heaviness was in the air, As if some hovering shape were there, With languid wing, and floating hair, Some cloudy one, whose sluggish flight, Was stooping to a dreary home; And hung beneath the vault of night, As if to intercept the light, That, bursting wide, and flashing bright, Rolled o'er the clouds in pulpy foam: All were as still, in heaven and earth, As they that watch'd Creation's birthâ When O!âa sudden trumpet-blast, Burst loudly on the ear!âand pastâ Then came the roll of drums!âand high The cannon's voice went thundering by!â And thenâthe thrilling bugle cry! And thenâamid the cloudsâwere heard Strangeâfearful echoes to the song; And o'er the skies there shrieked some bird, That went on viewless wing along! And thenâa far tumultuous sound, Beyond the hills, went rolling out; As if a sleeping host had found A sudden resurrection thereâ And burst the groundâ And starting up the midnight air Pealed all at once their battle-shout! As if a multitude had risen, The giants of our warring race, Amid the solitudes of space, And heaved their everlasting prisonâ Some mountain!âfrom its base! And countless wings aroseâand by They swept with warrior-minstrelsyâ Like that ye hear amid the sky, While, in the pauses of the storm, Some air-blown trumpâis laughing clear In distant worlds!âand harps are near, And pipes are breathing in your ear; When the strong wind comes out againâ Bearing away the wondrous strain: Sweeping from earth the minstrel-form. And thenâoh then!âthere went a cry Just like the song of victory, When dying men rise up, and peal Their last triumphant shout, With all the strength, that warriors feel, When life is ebbing out: Whenâon the air, and up the sky, A crowdedâthickâfar whispering goes; And vapoury hosts appear on high, Sweeping and jostling giddily; As if some sudden trump had blown; And answering quick, had upward flown The thronging dead!âand each had found His mortal enemy againâ Just as upon the battle ground, They parted lastâamong the slain! As if an angry world aroseâ On shadowy steeds, amid the sky And heaven itself were filled with foesâ That fought them battles o'er on highâ In warring immortality. As if the earthâas if the mainâ The crimson waveâthe crimson plain Had yielded up their dead againâ In blood and foamâjust as they diedâ Upon the earthâupon the tide! Then a minstrel was seen, and a vision came forth, Like a cold troubled light, o'er the clouds of the north, And the look of the minstrel was lifted and high: And the lights of the storm and the lights of the sky, While his robe was abroad on the breeze that went by, Were flashing and wild in the dark of his eye: A moment he pausedâand his look was upraised: Then he startedâand shookâlike a creature amazedâ For lo!âall the strength of his soul was revealedâ The thunder rolled out!âand the near lightning blazed, And he turned him away from the vault where he gazed, As if he had seenâwhat its darkness concealed! The thunder rolled out!âyet he stood all aloneâ Exultingâlike one that's recovered a throne.â A harp was before himâhis hand in the air, Yet it paused e'er it fell on his echoing lyre, And trembled and dwelt, as uplifted in prayerâ Niagara roll'd!âand the battle was there! The pealing of thunderâand rushing of fire! The future in pomp was assembled before himâ He felt as the pinions of prophecy bore him; And yet, for the dreams of his morning had flown, His heart was oppressed with a terror unknown. The chill of the night on his spirit was shed, Like the damps that abide on the brow of the dead: But more than the murmurs of night were around, When he stooped o'er his harp and awakened a sound; For voices were heard in the air! Like the stirring that comes from the tenanted ground When revelry wanders there! Yet thrice he smote the palsied strings, And thrice he heard the rush of wings, And feeble murmurings rose! As if some startled spirit fledâ Some soldier's guardâwhere he had bledâ Disturbed in her repose! As if some warrior raised his head, And listened from his bloody bed, To requiems o'er his foes! The minstrel left the field of blood; And stood above the mighty flood; And listened to his stormy voice; And heard it on the winds rejoice; And thereâhe would have sungâbut there, The awe he felt was in the airâ Was all aboutâwas every where: Then he stood on a cliff, when the Morning unrolled Her banners of crimson, and purple, and gold; Her plumage, and robe with its changeable fold; And felt, as he saw all these splendours outspread, As if he had gone where some mighty-one slumbers, With the ruins of song, and the relicks of numbers; Who 'woke as he heard the unhallowed tread! Yetâyet 'twas an impulse may never be quenched: The fountains that burst where the light hath its sourceâ Or cherubim wings, may be stayed in their course, When they lighten along where the storm is entrenched; Her spear, from the Angel of night, may be wrenched; Or the plumage of Peace in the battle be drenched,â When it bends o'er the strife, like the bow of the sky, Or the light that is seen in a martyr'd-one's eye;â Before you may still the tumultuous voice Of a heart that is heaving with song; Before ye may silence the lyres that rejoice, Where the wind from the water comes sweeping along; And the chorus of mountain and cavern is strong. The minstrel smote his harp once more; And loudly then, there went this strain, Unsteadily, from shore to shore, And died along the distant main. My country! my home! sunny land of my fathers! Where empires unknown in bright solitudes lie; Where Nature, august in serenity, gathers The wonders of mountain, and ocean, and sky: Where the blue dome of heaven scarce bounds her dominion: Where man is as free as the creatures of air; As thine Eagleâof fleet, uncontrollable pinion; The gallant gray Bird of the winds! that is there. That eagle, whose spirit each morning renews, As her god thro' unquenchable light she pursues, And tosses her plumes to the trumpet acclaim:â To the rushing of wings, and the screaming of praise, That her starry-eyed nurslings in ecstacy raise, As they mount, with their bosoms all bare, in the blaze Of their idol, whose temple is curtained with flame! My country! my home! in whose hallowed retreats, An horizon of blue, with a blue water meets, 'Till the whole like one ocean appears! 'Till the eye that dwells long on the faint, distant verge, Bewildered to see the fresh islets emerge, Like evergreen grottoes redeemed from the surge, Overflowsâin the worship of tears! Where the sun travels low in his chariot of light; And the stars and the hills are together at night: Where the lustre that Day at his parting hath shed, In one blush, o'er the land and the water is spread: And swims like a wreath on each mountain's proud head; And dwells on the night, Of each cliff's stormy heightâ Whose foliage hangs loosely and wildly in air, Like a meteor-diadem,âdropped in the flight Of those, who are forth in the storm and the fight, O'er the plumage of ravens that warrior-helms wear. There the Thunderers stand! in their fortress of shade; Like a guard that some god in his might hath arrayed: Where the foam-mantled tides, as they rush from each pole, Whose warrings have shaken the thrones of the deep, Embrace in one lasting and measureless roll, And sinkâwith the lulling of tempests, to sleep: Where Dominion is stayed by a cliff-guarded shore; Where Empire looks out from her heights o'er the sea: Where Peace is at homeâand the thunders that roar, And not the dread voices that nations deplore, Butâthe bounding of water that's free! Where all that moves in storm along: The earthquake's voiceâthe torrent's song, The uproar of the skies, when Night Leads forth her champions to the fight: The elemental chantâand roll Of thundersâcrowding to the poleâ Orâwhen the heaven is cloudlessâbright; And hearts are swelling with delight, And eyes are lifted cheerfully; Thatâo'er the blue and boundless skyâ Like some archangel's trump on high! Break suddenly, and fearfully! The oceanâwhen it rolls aloudâ The tempestâbursting from her cloud, In one uninterrupted peal! When darkness sits amid the sky; And shadowy forms go trooping by; And everlasting mountains reelâ Allâall of this is Freedom's songâ 'Tis pealedâ'tis pealed eternally! And all, that winds and waves prolong, Are anthems rolled to Liberty! Land of the mountainâand the woodâ The wonders of their giant race; Creation's barrier! Thou hast stood Upon thy lofty dwelling placeâ Unshaken by contending mains, That thundered in thy rocky chains: Immoveablyâthy hills arise, Above the clouds that gather thereâ Like islands in the empty skiesâ Green spots, revealed to gifted eyesâ Amid the pale blue air: Just like the blessed islets seenâ By Indiansâin the trance of death; Peopled with naked girls, and green With fresh and waving grassâand bright With never-ending sunny lightâ Where all the wind is like the breath Of Indian girls in chase: Where all the leaves are glossy; And all the seats are mossyâ And all about the brooks, are thrown Ten thousand wild flowers, newly blown: Unyielding still, though oceans wage One loudâperpetual war with thee: And all the elements engage For everâround thy royalty: Enthroned, thou sittest still, Upon thy loftiest hill, Columbia!âchild of heaven! While all the world is thundering roundâ To thee 'tis given, To sit secureâand hear the sound Of earthquakesâoceansâin their rageâ Within their secret hiding place, Toiling at thine eternal base. Home of the waters! where their strength Rolls in immeasurable length: Or, tumbling from their cloudy thrones, As thundering from a, battlement, With martial hymning, like the tones Of battle-shout, by warriors sentâ Go rioting in foam and spray, With rainbow-streamers o'er their way, Beneath the precipice they've rent; Exultingâas they burst their cloudâ As highâas dazzlingâand as loudâ As sheets of light! in their descent Thro' midnight's parting firmament! Where such the measure of the sky, That storms may pass unheeded by; And such the pillar'd strength of earth, So strong its adamantine chain, That when convulsion finds a birth, That birth is ever found in vain: The tumult in its weakness dies, Unheeded by the earth or skies. Land of the hero, the patriot, and sage! Of warriors, whose deeds have unfettered the wave, Whose standard looks forth where the whirlwinds engage, And battles aloftâin the realms of the brave! Whose Genius came forth from the home of the flood, And strove with the pirate's red banner on high, 'Till the foam of the ocean was tinged with his bloodâ Filled the air with her rainbows!âand fearlessly stood, And loosened her eaglets abroad o'er the sky! Of men, who have fought with the high Briton too, As he sat on his throne in his empire of blue; 'Till the scarlet-crossed banner that majesty bent, Had faded and fled from its home in the sky: 'Till its terrors went off, as its splendours were rent, Like meteors that over the firmament fly, And threw, as they passed o'er the free-rolling tide, A deep ruddy tintâ'twas the last blush of pride. Land of white bosoms, and blue laughing-eyes! Like miniature pictures of transparent skies, Where young thoughts, like the blessed, are seen; May those eyes brighten quick at the tale that I tell! And O, if it wake but one white bosom's swell; One heart where dear feeling hath been; One pulse that has throbbed in the still of the night, In the dream of its soldier afar in the fight, I'm repaid for it over and over: And Columbia may wake when she hears the loud strain, And stoop o'er the graves of her children again, And weep o'er the garlands they wove her: And many a bard of my country, who slumbers, Neglectedâforgottenâoppressed or unknownâ May arise in his strength, in the grandeur of numbers, Sublime on the height of a star-lighted throneâ And pour out his musick aloft and aloneâ On the wind of the sky!âand assert his high claim With those who are up for the chaplet of Fame.

The time employed is three days. CANTO I. THERE'S a fierce gray Birdâwith a sharpened beak; With an angry eye, and a startling shriek: That nurses her brood where the cliff-flowers blow, On the precipice-topâin perpetual snowâ Where the fountains are mute, or in secrecy flowâ That sitsâwhere the air is shrill and bleak, On the splintered point of a shivered peakâ Where the weeds lie closeâand the grass sings sharp, To a comfortless tuneâlike a wintry harpâ Bald-headed and stripped!âlike a vulture torn In wind and strife!âwith her feathers worn, And ruffled and stainedâwhile scatteringâbright, Round her serpent-neckâthat is writhing, bareâ Is a crimson collar of gleaming hair!â Like the crest of a warrior thinned in the fight, And shornâand bristlingâsee her! where She sits in the glow of the sun-bright air! With wing half-poisedâand talons bleedingâ And kindling eyeâas if her prey Hadâsuddenlyâbeen snatched awayâ While she was tearing it, and feeding! A Bird that is first to worship the sun, When he gallops in flameâ'till the cloud tides run In billows of fireâas his course is done: Above where the fountain is gushing in light; Above where the torrent is forth in its mightâ Like an imprisoned blaze that is bursting from night! Or a lion that springsâwith a roarâfrom his lair! Bounding offâall in foamâfrom the echoing heightâ Like a rank of young war-horsesâterribly bright, Their manes all erect!âand their hoofs in the air! The earth shaking under themâtrumpets on highâ And banners unfurling away in the skyâ With the neighing of steeds! and the streaming of hair! Above where the silvery flashing is seenâ The striping of waters, that skip o'er the green, And soft, spongy moss, where the fairies have been, Bending lovely and bright in the young Morning's eye Like ribands of flameâor the bow of the sky: Above that dark torrentâabove the bright streamâ The gay ruddy fount, with the changeable gleam, Where the lustre of heaven eternally playsâ The voice may be heardâof the Thunderer's bird, Calling out to her god in a clear, wild scream, As she mounts to his throne and unfolds in his beam; While her young are laid out in his rich red blaze; And their winglets are fledged in his hottest rays: Proud Bird of the cliff! where the barren-yew springsâ Where the sun shine staysâand the wind harp sings, Where the heralds of battle sitâpluming their wingsâ A scream!âshe's awake!âover hill-top and flood; A crimson light runs!âlike the gushing of bloodâ Over valley and rock!âover mountain and wood! That Bird is abroadâin the van of her brood! O ye, that afar in the blue-air, have heardâ As out of the skyâthe approach of that Birdâ Have ye seen herâhalf-famishedâand upâand awayâ Her wings in a blaze, with the shedding of dayâ Like a vulture on fire!âin the track of her preyâ When aloftâwhat is that?âlight footsteps near us! And whispersâand breathing!âthey may o'erhear us. Ahânow let us gaze:âwhat a wonderful sky!â How the robe of the god, in its flame-coloured dyeâ Goes ruddilyâflushinglyâsweepingly by. The spots that you see?âthey are tentsâand the airâ All alive with the rustling of flags that are thereâ Nay speakâdid you ever behold such a nightâ While the winds blew aboutâand the waters were brightâ The sun rolling home in an ocean of lightâ But hush!âthere is musick away in the skyâ Some creatures of magick are charioting byâ Now it comes!âwhat a soundâ'tis as cheerful and wild, As the echo of caves to the laugh of a child: Ah yes!âthey are hereâsee away to your left, Where the sun has gone downâwhere the mountains are cleftâ A troop of tall horsemen!âhow fearless they ride! 'Tis a perilous path o'er that steep mountain's side. Careering they come, like a band of young knights, That the trumpet of morn to the tilting invites; With high-nodding plumes, and with sun-shiny vests; With wide-tossing manes, and with mail-covered breasts; With arching of necks, and the plunge and the pride Of their high mettled steeds, as they galloping ride In glitter and pomp:âwith their housings of goldâ With their scarlet and blue, as their squadrons unfold, Flashing changeable lightâlike a banner unrolled. Now they burst on the eye in their martial array! And now they have gone!âlike a vision of day: In a streaming of splendour they cameâbut they wheeled; And instantly all the bright show was concealed! As if 'twere a tournament held in the sky, Betrayed by some light passing suddenly by: Some band by the flashing of torches revealed, As it fell o'er the boss of an uplifted shield, Or banners and blades in the darkness concealed. They came like a cloud that is passing the light, That brightens and blazesâand fades from the sight: They came like a dreamâand as swiftly they fled, As the shadows that pass o'er the sun's dying redâ And one has returned! 'twas the first of the band; On the top of the cliff he has taken his stand, And the tread of his barb, as he leans in his strength, And loosens his mane in the flow of its length, Declares he is reined by a masterly hand! While he rears o'er the rich-rolling clouds of that height Like a pageant upraised by the wonders of light: A warrior of flame!âon a courser of night! See his helm feathers glance in the clear setting sun, While his sabre is forth, o'er the cliff he has won, With a waving of strength, and an air of command! He is goneâand the brown, where the sunset reposes, Grows warm as the bloom on the bosom of roses; The herbage is crimson'd, and sprinkled with light; And purple and yellow are busy and bright: On the precipice-crown, and the sceptre of green, That the forest-tree heaves, a red lustre is seen, In a wreathing of fire: 'tis a garland that they, Whose blossoms are plucked at the closing of day, Have dropp'd from their laps in their rioting play: The summer leaf reddens and deepens its dyes: Its scarlet and green all unite, as it lies In the breath of the vapour, and hue of the skies: The young gushing fount ripples tenderly red; And a blush, like the sighing of blossoms is shed, O'er the green shiny moss, that around it is spread: A glow like enchantment is seen o'er the lake, Like the flush of the sky, when the day heralds wake, And o'er its dull-bosom their soft plumage shake: Now the warmth of the heaven is fading away. Young Evening comes up in pursuit of the Day: The richness and mist of the tints that were there Are melting away like the bow of the air: The blue-bosom'd water heaves darker and bluer: The cliffs and the trees are seen bolder and truer, The landscape has less of enchantment and light; But it lies the more steady and firm in the sight: The lustre-crown'd peaks, while they dazzled the eye, Seemed loosened and passing away in the sky, And the far-distant hills, in their tremulous blue, Like the violet that's melting away in its dew, But baffled the eye, as it dwelt on their hue. The light of the hill, and the wave, and the sky Grow fainter, and fainter:âthe wonders all die. The visions have gone! they have vanished away, Unobserved in their change, like the bliss of a day. The rainbows of heaven were bent in our sight: And fountains were gushing like wine in its light: And seraphs were wheeling around in their flightâ A momentâand all was enveloped in night! 'Tis thus with the dreams of the high-heaving heart, They come but to blazeâand they blaze to depart: Their gossamer wings are too thin to abide The chilling of sorrow, or burning of pride: They come, but to brush o'er its young gallant swell, Like bright birds over oceanâbut never to dwell. Observed ye the cloud on that mountain's dim green? So heavily hanging?âas if it had been The tent of the Thundererâthe chariot of one, Who dare not appear in the blaze of the sun? 'Tis descending to earth! and some horsemen are now, In a line of dark mist, coming down from its brow: 'Tis a helmeted band! from the hills they descend, Like the monarchs of storm, when the forest trees bend, No scimitars swing as they gallop along: No clattering hoof falls sudden and strong: No trumpet is filled, and no bugle is blown: No banners abroad on the wind are thrown: No shoutings are heardâand no cheerings are given: No waving of red-flowing plumage to heaven: No flashing of blades, and no loosening of reigns: No neighing of steeds, and no tossing of manes: No furniture trailing, or warrior helms bowingâ Or crimson and gold-spotted drapery flowing: But they speed like coursers, whose hoofs are shod With a silent shoe from the loosened sod: Like the steeds that career o'er the billowy surf, Or stretch like the winds o'er the untrodden turf, Where the willow and yew in their darkness are weeping, And young, gallant hearts in their sepulchres sleeping: Like the squadrons, that on the pale light of the moon, While the Nights muffled horn plays a low windy tune, Are seen to come down from the height of the skies, By the warrior, that on the red battle-field lies, And wave their cloud-helmets, and charge o'er the field, And career o'er the tracks where the living had wheel'd; When the dying half raise themselves up in a trance, And gaze on the show, as their thin banners glance, And wonder to see the dread battle renewed, On the turf, where themselves and their comrades had stood. Like these shadows, in swiftness and darkness they ride O'er the thunder-reft mountâon its ruggedest side: From the precipice top, they circle and leap, Like the warriors of air, that are seen in our sleep: Like the creatures that pass where a bleeding man lies, Their heads muffled up to their white filmy eyes,â With gestures more threatening and fierce 'till he dies: And away they have gone, with a motionless speed, Like Demons abroad on some dreadful deed. The last one hath gone: they have all disappear'd; Their dull-echoed trampings no longer are heard: For still, tho' they passed like no steeds of the earth, The fall of their tread gave some hollow-sounds birth; Your heart would lie still 'till it numbered the last; And your breath would be held till the rear horsemen past: So swiftlyâso mutelyâso darkly they went, Like the spectres of air to the sorcerer sent, That ye felt their approach, and might guess their intent: Your hero's stern-bosom will oftentimes quake, Your gallant young warrior-plume oftentimes shake, Before the cool marching that comes in the nightâ Passing by, like a cloud in the dim troubled light; Subduing the heart with a nameless affrightâ When that would swell strongly, and this would appear, If the sound of one trumpet saluted the ear, Like some scarlet-wing'd bird, that is nurs'd in the day, When she shakes her red plumage in wrath o'er her prey. For be they the horsemen of earth, or of heaven, No blast that the trumpet of Slaughter hath given; No roll of the drumâand no cry of the fife; No neighing of steeds in the bloodiest strifeâ Is half so terrifick to full swelling hearts, As the still, pulseless tramp of a band that departs, With echoless armourâwith motionless plume: With ensigns all furledâin the trappings of gloomâ Parading, like those who came up from the tomb, In silence and darknessâdetermined and slow; And dreadfully calmâas the murderer's brow, When his dagger is forth!âand ye see not the blow, 'Till the gleam of the blade shows your heart in its flow! O, say what ye will!âthe dull sound that awakes, When the night breeze is down, and the chill spirit aches With its measureless thought, is more dreadful by far, Than the burst of the trump, when it peals for the war. It is the cold summons that comes from the ground, When a sepulchre answers pour light, youthful bound, And loud joyous laugh, with its chill fearful sound, Compared to the challenge that leaps on the ear, When the banners of death in their splendours appear, And the free golden bugle sings freshly and clear! The low, sullen moans, that so feebly awake, At midnightâwhen one is aloneâon some lake, Compar'd to the Thunderer's voice, when it rolls, From the bosom of space, to the uttermost poles! Like something that stirs in the weight of a shroudâ The talking of those who go by in a cloud; To the cannon's full voice, when it wanders aloud! 'Tis the light that is seen to burst under the waveâ The pale, fitful omen, that plays o'er a grave, To the rushing of flame, where the turf is all red, And farewells are discharg'd o'er a young soldier's bed! To the lightnings that blaze o'er the mariner's way, When the storm is in pomp, and the ocean in spray! Dark and chill is the sky; and the clouds gather round; There's nought to be seen, yet there comes a low sound; As if something were near, that would pass unobserved, O, if 'tis that bandâmay their right-arms be nerved! Hark!âa challenge is given!âa rash charger neighs! And a trumpet is blown!âand lo, there's a blaze! And a clashing of sabres is heardâand a shout, Like a hurried orderâgoes passing about! And unfurling banners are tossed to the sky, As struggling to float on the wind passing byâ And unharness'd war-steeds are crowding together; The horseman's thick plumeâand the foot soldier's featherâ The battle is up! and the thunder is pealing! And squadrons of cavalry coursing and wheeling! And line after line, in their light are revealing! One troop of high helms thro' the fight urge their way, Unbroken and sternâlike a ship thro' the spray: Their pistols speak quickâand their blades are all bare, And the sparkles of steely encounter are there. Away they still speed!âwith one impulse they bound; With one impulse alike, as their foes gather round. Undismayedâundisturbedâand above all the rest, One rides o'er the strife, like a mane o'er its crest; And holds on his way thro' the scimitars there, All plunging in light!âwhile the slumbering air Shakes wide with the rolling artillery-pealâ The tall one is first, and his followers deal Around, and around, their desperate blows, Like the army of shadows above, when it goes With the smiting of shields, and the clapping of wings; When the red-crests shakeâand the storm-pipe sings: When the cloud-flag unfurlsâand the death-bugles soundâ When the monarchs of space on their dark-chargers boundâ And the shock of their cavalry comes in the night, With furniture flashing!âand weapons of light!â So travelled this band in its pomp and its might. Away they have gone!âand their path is all red, Hedged in by two lines of the dying and dead; By bosoms, that burst unrevenged in the strifeâ By swords, that yet shake in the passing of lifeâ For so swift had that pageant of darkness spedâ So like a trooping of cloud-mounted deadâ That the flashing reply of the foe that was cleft, But fell on the shadows those troopers had left Far and away, they are coursing again, O'er the clouded hill, and the darkened plain, Now choosing the turf for their noiseless route; Now, where the wet sand is strown thickest about, Streams their long line!âlike a mist troop they ride, In a winding cloud, o'er the near mountain's side; While a struggling moon throws a lustre as dim As a sepulchre's lamp, and the vapours that swim, O'er the hills and the heavens, divide as they fly:â The videttes of winds that are stationed on high! Speakâwould you know why woke that desperate fray? Why battle moved in night, and shunned the day? And who the leader of that sullen band, Whose march was destiny?âwhose stern command Went thrilling to the heart:âwhile not a word He uttered in his marchâand nought was heard, But the deep, dreadful sound, of hearts that burstâ Of arms that smote in death, and lips that cursed? Who gave no cheering to his troopsâas they Wheeledâchargedâand smoteâand gallopped in array! But shook his naked falchion in his might, And scattered o'er his path its meteor light? Then, like the bolt of heaven, it flash'd, and fell On blades and helms, that shattered in their knell! How firm and high he sat!âall boneâall strengthâ His charger stretching at his utmost length! 'Tis lighter now: the troops are seen again, Passing at length before a tented plain: The moon is up, and brightening o'er their road; Their steeds come bravely round beneath their load, And slacken to a trotâand snorting loudly, Strain their dark necks, with far manes floating proudly; Thickening their tramps approachâthey near the blaze Of Freedom's camp, where her loose drapery playsâ Breaking in lustreâthick with starry light; And crimson stripes opposed to gleamy white: Symbols of battle and of peaceâthe dye Of bloodâand flash of lilied purity: The leader haltsâthe broad red light shows well His stately outline, and his charger's swell. How like a shade the horse and rider seem! Like the dark trooper of a troubled dream. His sabre is abroadâthey gather roundâ Back!âback it waves!âand hark!âthe bugles sound: Swiftly he wheels!âhis arm is stretched againâ Some gather round, and some behind remain: Forth, and all free! a chosen escort spring; Unsheath their hangers, while their scabbards ring: Leap to their places, and at speed depart, While the rough trumpets on the night-wind start: Away they stretch at length! as when they've met In chase upon the mountain-tops, while yet The morning gems are thick, and all the turf is wet. Again they stay their marchâand one's ahead; His fire-eyed charger halts with angry tread; His black limbs bathed in foamâhis reaching mane, Rising and sinking, as he feels the rein: Now rings the harness!âfrom the saddle, bounds The red-plumed chiefâerect, and lightly sounds A free-toned bugle to the distant hills; Singing and pealing clearâlike horn that Echo fills: And oh!âan answer!âhow it faintly dies In sweet, calm melody along the skies, As if it were a challenge lightly given, From golden trumpets on a summer even! Now springing merrily upon the ear, As if some infant trumpeter were nearâ Like songs ye hear at evening o'er the mainâ Like bells upon the windâthat come and go again. âHalt here!â the chieftain saidââhalt here awhile:â His cheek burned deeperâand a soldier smile Played sternly o'er his features, as he laid, His martial hand upon his rattling blade, And gathered up his cloak, and strode amid the shade.

COME, sit thou with me!âwhat a heavenly night! The winds blowing freshâand the beautiful light Shedding out such a luminous dampness above!â So respectful and still:âand the scenery thereâ How it moves up and down in the dim, holy air! 'Tis a midnight of aweâand a sabbath of love. O lift up thine eyesâsee the firmament spreading A moveable vault of the deepest of blueâ Rolling onârolling onâthrough infinityâshedding For everâits oceans of lustre and dew. Come, sit thou with me!âwe shall both learn to feel, Like the men of old timesâwhen Jehovah was nearâ Come, sit thou with me!âand together we'll kneel, And pour out our hearts to the God that is here. And the breezes that comeâand the branches that bowâ To the clouds trailing byâthey shall all teach us how, In past years, when these woods started green from the earth; And that shoreâand this hillâand that water had birth, Their inhabitants held their communion with heavenâ In worship and tremblingâlike children forgivenâ How they knelt down alone, while the whole world slept, Their hearts overburthened with pleasureâand wept. Here sleeps Ontario. Old Ontario, hail! Unawed by conquering prow, or pirate sail: Still heaving in thy freedomâstill unchainedâ Still swelling to the skiesâstill unprofanedâ As when thy earliest, freest children flew Like hawks to battleâwhen the swift canoeâ From every shore, went dipping o'er the tideâ Like birds, that stooping from the far cliff rideâ A moment on the billowâshriek and rise, With loaded talons wheeling to the skies. The heaven's blue counterpart!âthe murmuring home Of spirits shipwrecked in the ocean-foamâ Reflector of the arch that's o'er thee bent; Thou watery sky!âthou liquid firmament! Mirror of garland-weaving Solitudeâ The wild festoonâthe cliffâthe hanging woodâ The soaring eagleâand the wing of lightâ The sunny plumageâand the starry flight Of dazzling myriads in a cloudless night. Peace to thy bosom, dark Ontario! For ever thus, may thy free waters flow, In their rude loveliness!âthy lonely shore For ever echo to the sullen roar Of thine own deep! thy cliffs for ever ring With calling wild men, in their journeyingâ The savage chantâthe panther's smothered cryâ That, from her airy height, goes thrilling by! Be ever thusâas nowâmagnificentâ In savage Nature's pompâunbowedâunbent, And thou wilt ever be omnipotent! Be ever unapproachableâand free: The home of Indians and of Liberty.â But let thy woods be bowedâtheir sceptres shorn: Thy blooming streamers from thy ramparts torn; Thy fountains hushedâand the luxuriant green Of oozy turf, that o'er thy haunt is seen, Be trampled on and opened to the sunâ And all thy rich exuberance is done: Let but the white man's summons once be heard, And gone, for ever, is thy guardian Bird: Be once thy torrents stilledâthe shiny moss, Thy grotto-hangings, that the dews emboss; Thy glittering halls laid open to the lightâ Thy mysteries revealed to the unholy sight: Thy secret places to the sun betrayed; And, in thy temples, men of blood arrayed; The curtain of thy sanctuary rentâ Thy dwellings opened to the firmament: Thy solitudes disturbedâthine altars stained: Thy heights polluted, and thy depths profaned With Indian blood, and thy dark offspring chained: Thy battlements of rocks, and cliffs, and cloudsâ Stripped of their garland flags, and hung with shrouds, And bright with glittering spires: thine altars downâ Then what art thou? and where thy thrones? and crown? Thy sceptres? and thy hosts?âfor ever gone! And thouâa savage in the world!âalone: A naked monarchâsullen, stern, and rude, Amid a robed and plumed multitude: Sublime and motionlessâbut impotentâ Stripped of his arrows, and with bow unbent. Who feels that terror of the Indian then, Such as he felt in night and darkness, when That Indian walked alone, the conqueror of men? True, he may walk with his own fearless tread; With out-stretched arm, and high uplifted head, Of one familiar with the pathless wood, The caverned chase, the haunts of solitudeâ The midnight stormâthe thunder-clapâand sleep On jutting cliffâabove a tumbling deep: But where will be that reverential dread, That hung upon the wild man, in his tread Within his own dominions?âit is gone!â And he stands there undreaded and alone. Such were thy childrenâIndian princesânow Each stands subduedâwith yet a monarch's brow. But rend him from his home, and place him where The heaven's bright blue is hiddenâand the air Breathes thick with pestilenceâand there he dies, With few to fear and none to sympathize. Rest like the midnight, Mighty One!âand throwâ Thy shadow o'er thy children of the bow: Who, in the wilderness, can calmly go To do their worship in a lonely place, By altars reeking with the she-wolf's trace: And gaze intrepidly upon the skies, While the red lightning in its anger fliesâ When white men, in their terror, close their eyes: For man is there sublimeâhe is a god! Great Nature's master-piece! like him who trod The banks of paradise, and stood alone, The wonder of the skiesâerect upon his throne. Not like the airy god of moulded light, Just stepping from his chariot on the sight; Poising his beauties on a rolling cloud, With arm outstretched and bow-string twanging loud: And arrows singing as they pierce the air, With tinkling sandals, and with flaming hair; As if he paused upon his bounding way, And loosened his fierce arrowsâall in play; But like that angry god, in blazing light Bursting from space! and standing in his might: Revealed in his omnipotent arrayâ Apollo of the skies! and Deity of Day! In god-like wrath! piercing his myriad-foe With quenchless shafts, that lighten as they go: Not like that god, when up in air he springs, With brightening mantle, and with sunny wings, When heavenly musick murmurs from his stringsâ A buoyant visionâan embodied dream Of dainty Poesyâand boyishly supreme: Not the thin spirit waked by young Desire, Gazing o'er heaven till her thoughts take fire: Panting and breathless in her heart's wild tranceâ Bright, shapeless formsâthe godlings of Romance: Not that Apolloânot resembling him, Of silver bow, and woman's nerveless limb: But man!âall man!âthe monarch of the wild! Not the faint spirit that corrupting smil'd On soft, lascivious Greeceâbut Nature's child, Arrested in the chase! with piercing eye Fix'd in its airy lightning on the sky, Where some red Bird goes languid, eddying, drooping, Pierced by his arrows in her swiftest stooping! Thus springing to the skies!âa boy will stand With arms uplifted and unconscious hand Tracing his arrow in its loftiest flightâ And watch it kindling, as it cleaves the light Of worlds unseen, but by the Indian sight; His robe and hair upon the wind at length, A creature of the hills!âall grace and strength; All muscle and all flameâhis eager eye Fixed on one spot, as if he could descry His bleeding victim nestling in the sky. Not that Apollo!ânot the heavenly one, Voluptuous spirit of a setting sun,â But thisâthe offspring of young Solitude, Child of the holy spot, where none intrude But genii of the torrentâcliff, and woodâ Nurslings of cloud and stormâthe desert's fiery brood. Great Nature's man!âand not a thingâall light: Etherial vision of distempered sight; But mingled cloud and sunshineâflame and night. With arrowsânot like his of sportâthat go In light and musick from a silver bow: But barbed with flintâwith featherâreeking red, The heart-blood that some famished wolf hath shed! Thou home of gallant menâOntarioâ I would, but cannot leave theeâI would go, But thy great spirit holds meâmay no sial Ever unfold against thy mountain gale! Thy waters were thus spread in cloudy blue, But for thy white fowl and the light canoe. Should once the smooth dark lustre of thy breast With mightier burthens, ever be oppressedâ Farewell to thee! and all thy loveliness! Commerce will rear her arksâand Nature's dress Be scattered to the winds: thy shores will bloom, Like dying flow'rets sprinkled o'er a tomb: The feverish, fleeting lustre of the flowers, Burnt into life in Art's unnatural bowers; Not the greenâgracefulâwild luxuriance Of Nature's garlands, in their negligence: The clambering jasmine, and the flushing rose That in the wilderness their hearts disclose; The dewy violet, and the bud of gold, Where drooping lilies on the wave unfold; Where nameless flowers hang fainting on the air, As if they breathed their lovely spirits there; Where heaven itself is bluer, and the light Is but a coloured fragranceâfloatingâbright; Where the sharp noteâand whistling song is heard, Of many a golden beak, and sunny sparkling bird: There the tame honeysuckle will arise; The gaudy hot-house plant will spread its dyes, In flaunting boldness to the sunny skies: And sickly buds, as soon as blown, will shed Their fainting leaves o'er their untimely bed; Unnatural violets in the blaze appearâ With hearts unwet by youthful Flora's tear; And the loose poppy with its sleepy death, And flashy leaf: the warm and torpid breath Of lazy garlands, over crawling vines; The tawdry wreath that Fashion intertwines, To deck her languid brow: the streamy gold, And purple flushing of the tulip's fold; And velvet buds, of crimson, and of blue, Unchangeable and lifeless, as the hue Of Fashion's gaudy wreaths, that ne'er were wet with dew. Such flowers as travellers would not stop to bless, Tho' seen by fountains in the wilderness: Such heartless flowers, as Love would disavow; And blooming Flora, if upon her brow Their leaves had once been dropped, would feel as tho' Pollution's lips were pressed upon its snow: Not the white blossom, that beneath its green And glossy shelter, like a star is seen; Shrinking and closing from the beam of dayâ A virgin flow'ret for the twilight ray: Not the blue hare-bell, swelling o'er the ground, And thinly echoing to the fairy bound Of tripping feet, within its silky round: Not the wild snow-leaf trembling to the moon, But the tame sun-flower basking in the noon. Where now red Summer, in her sporting, weaves Her brightest blossoms with her greenest leaves; Where the wild grape hangs dropping in the shade, O'er unfledged minstrels, that beneath are laid: Where all is fragrant, breathing negligence; And Nature's budding child, sweet Innocence; Where now her treasures, and her mysteriesâ Like shrouded diamondsâor like sleeping eyes, Are only seen by those, who kneel and take Their first bright beaming, when they first awake: Where now, fresh streamlets answer to the hues Of passing seraph-wingsâand fiery dews, Hang thick on every bush, when morning wakes, Like sprinkled flame; and all the green-wood shakes With liquid jewelry, that Night hath flung Open her favourite tresses, while they swung, And wantoned in the windâhenceforth will be No lighted dimness, such as that you see, In yonder faint, mysterious scenery, Where all the woods keep festivalâand seem Beneath the midnight skyâand mellow beam Of yonder breathing lightâas if they were Branches and leaves of unembodied air: Where fountains sing and sparkle to the skies, In all their sweetest desert melodiesâ The prisoned water will be made to play In one eternal glitter to the day: Unnatural freshnessâarbours will be seenâ And tortured festoons of fantastick green: The heavy grottoâand the loaded bower: The green and tepid pond: the pale wall-flower: The tasteless mingling of the savage pine, With the bright tendrils of the garden vine: The stooping willow, with its braided light, And feathery tresses, changeable and bright:â The airy mountain ashâthe elmâand oak Rising triumphant from the Thunderer's stroke;â In all their rich exuberance, shooting out Their restless sceptres, to the winds about, The lordly monarchs of the vigorous wood! Placed by the toweringâupstart-poplar broodâ And all the foppery of silly Taste, That grieves to see wild Nature so unchaste, Thatâin her modestyâwould barely hint âThat such and such a shade, and such a tint âMight mingle better, if a little careâ âA little grouping hereâand contrast there, âWere just toâbut no matter,ââthey all know Better than Nature, how her flowers should blow; How her sweet birds should sing and fountains flowâ And where her trees should standâher cliffs should rise, In scattered pointings to the glorious skies. Leave such cold bosoms, Nature! to their fate; And be thou grandâluxuriantâdesolateâ As it best pleaseth thee. These wretched fools Would have Creation work by lines and rules. Theirs is the destinyâbe theirs the curse, In their improvements stillâto mount from bad to worse. Be ever thus thou Wilderness! be wild In thine own nakednessâyoung Nature's child! Still hang her festoons o'er thy glittering caves: Still far from thee the pageantry of slaves! The dull cold blooming of the lifeless wreaths, Plucked from the garden where Oppression breathes: The misty poison of the sultry flowers, That shed their sleep in artificial bowers: May Architecture never rear her spires, Or swell her domes to thy warm sunset fires; Where now, o'er verdant pyramids and pines, And dark green crowns, the crimson lustre shines! Enough has now been doneâthou art but free: Art but a refuge now for Libertyâ E'en now the wakening thunder sometimes roars Above thy prostrate oaksâthe guardians of thy shores. Roll not thy waves in light, Ontario!! For ever darkly may thy waters flow!â Through thy tall shores and blooming solitudes, Sacred to lonelinessâand cavesâand woods:â Roll not thy waves in lightâor thou wilt see Their bosoms heave no longer darkly free: But whitening into foam beneath their load, While Commerce ploughs upon her flashing road; And thou mayest stand, and hearken to the cry Of thy young genii mounting to the sky: And feel the fanning of the last free wing, That's shaken o'er thy brow, as it goes wandering: And listen to the loud, tumultuous roar Of martial thunders echoing from thy shore; And thouâthy ramparts, cliffs, and citadels, Where now Sublimity, with Freedom, dwells, Will see thy conquerors on thy mountains rise, With glittering banners rustling in the skies; And see their streamers flash, and hear the song Of victory o'er thee, go pealingly along. Hail, sleepless monarch! Old Ontario! Thou, of the woods, and of the Indian bow, I see thy glories in their dark blue flow! A lake of wonders!âwhere the stars appear In the fair deep, more luminous and clear, For their confusion! All thy dim shores lie In moonlight's sleepy, soft tranquillity. The air is cool, but motionless; about Is something of enchantment, awe and doubtâ As in the fleeting scenery of a dream, When landscapes comeâand vanish!âlike the beam That blue voluptuous eyes emit in tears, That tremblesâbrightensâfades, and disappears! Something mysteriousâholyâlike the air Of caverns, when some spirit has been there; While yet the breathing incense that was shed, Is faint and floating round, like sighings o'er the dead. No sound is on the ear: no boatman's oar Drops its dull signal to the watchful shore: But all is listening, as it were, to hear Some seraph harper stooping from her sphere, And calling on the desert to express, Its sense of Silence in her loveliness. What holy dreaming comes in nights like these! When, like yon waveâunruffled by a breeze, The mirrors of the memory all are spread, And fanning pinions sail around your head: When all that man may loveâalive or dead, Come murmuring sweet, unutterable things, And nestle on his heart with their young wings: And all perchance may come, that he may fear, And mutter doubtful curses in his ear: Hang on his loaded soul, and fill his brain With indistinct forbodings, dimâand vainâ Who has not felt the unexpected tear? Who has not shaken with an awful fear, When, in the wildernessâaloneâhe trodâ Where, since there walked the Everlasting Godâ No living foot hath been? where boundless woodsâ Where sanctuariesâwatersâsolitudesâ In dreadful stillnessâvaulted roundâare spread, Like some appointed placeâfor judgment on the dead. The moon goes lightly up her thronging way, And shadowy things are brightening into day; And cliff, and shrub, and bank, and tree, and stone, Now move upon the eyeâand now are gone! A dazzling tapestry is hung around: A gorgeous carpeting bestrews the ground; The willows glitter in the passing beam, And shake their tangling lustres o'er the stream: And all the full, rich foliage of the shore, Seems with a quick enchantment frosted o'er; And dances at the faintest breath of night, And trembles like a plume of spangles in the light. Far o'er the slumbering wave, amid the shade, Millions of dancing lights are thick arrayed; And interposing forms are seen to go, With ceaseless step, unwearied, firm and slowâ In measured walking, like a cavalcadeâ As if a band were marshalled for paradeâ Before a line of fire, that redly throws A glimmering richness, where that billow flows, And some yet feebler lights are o'er the turf, Like sea foam brightening faintly o'er the surf. There, Pestilence hath breathed! within each tent The midnight bow, with quenchless shaftâis bent; And many a youthful hero wastes away, In thatâthe worst of deathsâthe death of slow decay. This dark, cool wave is bluer than the deep, Where sailorsâchildren of the tempest!âsleep; And dropped with lights as pureâas still as thoseâ The wide-drawn hangings of the skies disclose, Far lovelier than the dim and broken ray, That Ocean's flashing surges send astray; And when the foam comes loosely o'er its breast, The sea-maid's bosom with its studded vest, That mightier billows bear, is darkâis dull, To this light silvery spray, so beautiful! This is the mirror of dim Solitude, On which unholy things may ne'er intrude; That frowns and ruffles when the clouds appear, Refusing to reflect their shapes of fear; Ontario's deeps are spread to multiply But sunshineâstarsâthe moonâand clear-blue sky, The oceanâwhen at peaceâis but the place Where those who rule the tempestâdwell in spaceâ Direct the thunderârock the established hillâ And steadfast shore;âwhose countless myriads fill All heaven and earthâand airâare wont to dwell, And calm themselves to sleep upon its boundless swell. No pirate barque was ever seen to ride, With blood-red streamer, chasing o'er that tide; 'Till late, no bugle o'er those waters sang With aught but huntsman's orisons, that rang Their clearâexultingâboldâtriumphant strain, 'Till all the mountain echoes laughed again! 'Till caverns, depths, and hills, would all reply, And heav'n's blue dome ring out the sprightly melody. Within those depths no shipwrecked sailor lies, Upon his foaming couch; whose dying eyes Were closed amid the stormâwith no one near, To grasp his hand, or drop the manly tear: With not one friendâone shipmate left to tell, As 'tis in strifeâhow gallantly he fell. Not one to tell the melancholy tale, To her whose heart is on the rising gale. Within that peaceful sanctuary sleep No victim wanderers of the mighty deep; No ocean-wreaths are thereâno diadems, Of bloody sea-weed, sprinkled o'er with gems, That vanish when ye touch them, like the pearl That glitters on the sea-maid's shining curl; No wrecks of slaughter:âflags in battle rent; By Victory scattered in the firmament: Not one of all those trophies of the flood, When ship encounters ship, and foams along in blood. August amid this scene, unclouded, stand The everlasting hills that guard our land: And rear their rocky helmets, where the sky Hath pitched their tent upon immensity. These are our forts! our battlements! our holds! Our bulwarks! our entrenchments! Here unfolds The rainbow-banner, and its lights are forth In sudden splendours, like the streaming north: An outspread eaglet o'er each standard stoops, With unclosed beak, and wing that never droops: And stars are busy thereâand through the night, A constellation blazes on the sight- Eagles! and stars! and rainbows! all abroad, Beneath a boundless sky, upon a mountain road! And LIBERTY, from whose imperial eye, Unfettered limb, and step of majesty, Perpetual sunshine brightens all the air, When undisturbed by manâin wrath is there! And prostrate armies now, are kneeling round: They see the rolling clouds! they hear the sound Of pealing thunders! While her martial form Lightens tremendous in the gathering storm! They breathe that buoyant mountain atmosphere, And kindling in their eyes those lights appear,â Those quenchless lights!âthat despots, tyrants dread, When man comes forth in might, and lifts his head Sublime in desperation; when they hear The song of trumpets bursting on their ear! The shock of armies! and, afar, behold Rebellion's crimson standard all unrolled! When slaves are menâare monarchsâand their tread Comes like the resurrection of the dead! Man bursts his fetters! shakes his sheathless swordâ Stands on his grave, and battles with his lord For sepulture or freedomâeye to eyeâ And swears to live his equal, or to die, In glorious martyrdomâto glorious Liberty. Then let the trumpet of the battle sound! Then let the shuddering challenge peal around! 'Till all our ruffled eaglets start and wakeâ And scream aloudâand whet their beaksâand shake Their guardian wings, o'er mountain, wood, and lake! The blast will but disturb the spirit there; But rouse the she-wolf from her bloody lair; But wake the fiery-harnessed multitudes; The dark battalions of untrodden woods; Whose viewless chiefs shall gird their armour on. And lighten o'er the fields their valour won: 'Twill 'waken echoes in that solitude, Less welcome than the panther's cry for food: Less earthlyâthan the voices heard, when Night Collects her angels on some stormy height, And airy trumps are blown! and o'er the heaven Ten thousand fearful challenges are given! Those star-crowned hills! the gathering will be there, Of heaven's dim hordes, the squadrons of air! Erect and high, upon their stormy carsâ In meteor armourârushing 'mid the stars, The dusky champions of the earth and sky Will seem encountering in their chivalry. Yon moon-light tents, so gallantly outspread By living hands, will then be filled with dead: Whose home is space: the habitation, too, Of yon perpetual host, that walk in blue: That endless multitude! eternal source! Of wonder and of worship in their course; O, whither is your march? ye stars! and whence? Ye blazing myriads of Omnipotence! Ye suns! who burst from darkness with our earth, Still coming forth in one continual birth! Almighty miracles! who fill the air With melody and light, as if ye were A host of living harmonies,âye roll, Systems and worldsâall intellect and soul! Interpreters of God! who've called to man, From yon eternal vault, since time began: Ye midnight travellers, who, nightly move In everlasting pilgrimage above! Ye blazonry of power! ye heraldry of love! There's one who stands to see that deep blue fold Of gloriesâsunsâand systems, all unrolled, This was stolenâI confess it,âfrom the âunrolling gloryâ in the Airs of Palestine. I do not strike it outâbecause I conceive it to be the noblest compliment that I can pay any man, to let it remain. In speechless adoration,âwith an eye Of dampened light uplifted to the sky; Who half forgets the signal that he gave, And echoing answer o'er the distant wave: For he is all alone upon the shoreâ Aloneâat nightâwhat could he think of more? He speaks notâmoves not his uncovered brow, If one might seeâperchance is gathered now; His attitude, so fixed, is that of thoughtâ Something of stern composure; as if wrought With dangerous purpose to be done with speed, Some quick-maturedâbut full-determined deed; Nowâo'er the dim blue waters you may see His eye go flashing and impatiently: And now his helm is shakenâand his hand Is partly raised as if 'twere in command: The dipping of an oar is heardâa boat so light, It scarcely touched the wave, is now in sight: Around the cliff it came, like some keen birdâ That passes by you 'ere her wing is heard; Like the enchanted skiff that dreamers see, Self-moved in moonlight breezeâlight, swift, and cheerfully: An Indian springs on shore: his light canoe Hath vanished like a spectre from the view: Something he murmurs in the sullen tone Of one who is abandoned: all aloneâ Left to contend with many; and his eye, So rootedâdeadly, bodes some danger nigh: Hush! hushâa rustlingâand a fearful pauseâ A sword is half unsheathedâthe Indians draws His arrow to the head; but why?âno soundâ Of thundering tread, is echoing on the ground: No footstep comesâno cautiousâstealing foeâ The garland-float is heard, and watery-flowâ And nothing else, o'er blue Ontario. One rapid glance! his soul is all revealed; Battle is nearâhis swarthy brow is sealed With Indian-meaning, and his serpent eye Is black and glittering with a changeless dye; The stranger tooâas if he scarcely breathed, Stands stoopingâlisteningâwith his blade unsheathed; Silent as death they are; one glanceâa single glance Was but exchangedâin their deep, pulseless tranceâ One glance! it was enoughâand each was sure Of all his fellow would performâendure. Yetânone of that of companionship is here, The union of the vulgar, when in fear: No talkâno whisperâbut the steady eye Of dangerous-bodingâstern tranquillity: The strong, cool browâthe upright, martial tread Of planted strengthâthe boldly lifted head. One glance! a white man's glanceâthe Indian feels What none but Nature's savage man concealsâ The swell of sympathyâof brotherhood, In danger and in deathâin solitude. Nowâo'er the waters ye may faintly see A shadowy vision coming silently: A rushing now is heardâand spreading large With sail upon the windâthere comes a barge: And yet, methinks, its lightly lifted prow, Upon its glossy path, goes wondrous slow; It comesâas drifting from the guarded strand, And looks as tho' in peaceâunarmedâunmanned: This has a quite aspectâbut that sail Is sharply trimmed, as if it might prevail, In ruder nights than this, against a fiercer gale. A bird of prey, perhapsâthat folds its wingâ And sits upon the wave in slumbering; That stoops at nightâbut stay! she goes aboutâ Is that a signal?âthere!âthat light thrown out? By heaven 'tis answered!âanswered from the land! From yonder beetling steep is stretched a brand! The waters foamâup comes the boat in pride! Leaving a path of light along the tide; And 'ere the soldier can put forth his blade, He is a prisoner!âRound him are arrayed A hidden band, that started from their shade: A band with bayonets levelled at his breastâ The circle narrowsânods each threatening crest: Contracting slowly, they approachâas they Still feared a single warrior, when at bay: âYield,â cries the foremost, loudly,âfiercelyââyield!â The stranger would replyâbut sees concealed Beneath a stooping oak, his dark ally, With bended bowâand cool, and patient eye,â He waves his handâthe arrow's point is dropp'dâ The death shaft of a foe, upon its flight, is stopp'd; The summons is repeated: âYield!â he cries, With anger flashing from his youthful eyes: A pauseâa change of attitude betrays A naked blade to his imperious gaze. A backward stepââa daggerâthus revealedââ What could he think?ââStranger!âthat point concealed!â âConcealed!â the stranger echoedâand it came, With startling emphasis, and kindling flame; Thenâturning silently, he shook his head In calm disdain, and with his lordly tread, And gathered cloak, he stoodâas one who feels That every spirit round him, prostrate kneels: He grasps his trusty hilt:âhe moves away: The circle widens:âall who meet, obey The calm commandâfirm stepâintrepid eye Of one familiar with such victory: Amid the working of that mighty spell He had escapedâbut some low murmurs fell, And each arose in heart: their wandering eyes Now lowered in silent threatânow sought their prize: The charm was broken, and their strength returned; And each reproached his comrade, while he burned To wipe away, for ever, this disgrace, And meet his foe, once more!âbut face to face. 'Tis doneâtheir prayer is grantedâtheir pursuit Is short indeed. Again they all are mute; He stands too proudlyâand is found too near, To leave them their last hopeâthat he had fled in fear. Their angry leader is the first to break The sullen loneliness; the first to wake Some soundâhe cares not whatâso it be life; Something less awfulâbe it even strife. âStranger!â he cries again, âyour arms! your sword!â âOrââpausing faintlyââorââthe evening word. The stranger smiledâadvanced his foot,âand said; While all stood awe-struck at his martial tread, And something rustled in the neighbouring shadeâ âWhere is your leader?âlet him take my blade!â âI am the leader!ââ âYou! and by what right âArrest ye thus a traveller at night?â They marked his portâhis keen, unshifting eye; His half-raised lip, and stand of majestyâ His calmâsereneâand almost taunting toneâ And yetâthey knew their prize!âhe was alone. âA traveller!âyesâand 'ere to-morrow's light He will be hanged for travelling thus at night.â The stranger's hand fell sudden on his hip, âHanged!â he replied, and higher curled his lip, And lightnings left his eye!âand forth he stood Like something raised within that solitude By some unholy riteâupraised in wrath, By some unhallowed step upon his path; He struggledâheaved as if he gasped for breathâ And all was silent then, as in the hour of death. At last the swelling of his chest subsidesâ The lightnings pass awayâa cold smile rides Upon the writhing of his mighty brow, And glittering breastâfrom which his mantle's flow Is opening in the tumult of his heart,â Like the last splendours of the storm, that part, And o'er the rolling clouds in softness sleepâ Or tender moon-light on the troubled deep; âHanged!â he repeatedââhang a soldierâno!â âSoldiers are never hanged.ââForth stepped his foe:â âNo moreâyour arms!âa dastard midnight spy âShould neverâneverâlike a soldier die!â âA spy!âenoughââand forth his faulchion flew; A shrill, quick summons to his band he blewâ Threw off his cloakâagainst the high rock stood, And bade him take his sword, who âdared and would!â Charge!â cried the leader, âcharge!â and drew his brand; âAlready they encounter, hand to handâ But pauseâfor lo!âthey meet with men and steedsâ An arrow from the distant shade proceedsâ The foremost fallsâan Indian rushes out, And mingles with the horsemen's furious shout, And sabres streaming clashâhis thrilling cries: Short is the conflictâhalf the foot band dies. âSecure them,â cried the chiefâI must awayâ âSpeed to the campâreturn by break of day. The barge hath fledâthe Indian, where is he? The savage manâthe nakedâhe is free! Again appears the skimming light canoeâ Forth from its covert, o'er the watery blue, With wondrous impulse now, it swiftly flies, Like some young spirit o'er the wintry skies: Now underneath the cliffânow up a stream Of ruffled shade, it passes like a dream: Now shooting 'thwart a tranquil, lovely sheet Of shining light, as it goes as still and fleet, As that ethereal bark that sails on high, Amid the lustre of a dark blue sky: Now on the flowery bank a light appearsâ A cottage nestles:âand an oak uprears, With all its giant branches, wide outspread, Above the lonely cotâits thunder-blasted head. And there the stranger stays: beneath that oak, Whose shattered majesty hath felt the stroke Of heaven's own thunderâyet it proudly heaves A giant sceptre wreathed with blasted leavesâ As though it dared the elements, and stood The guardian of that cotâthe monarch of that wood. Beneath its venerable vault he stands: And one might think, who saw his out-stretched hands, That something more than soldiers e'er may feel, Had touched him with its holy, calm appeal: That yonder waveâthe heavenâthe earthâthe air Had called upon his spirit for her prayer. His eye goes dimly o'er the midnight scene: The oakâthe cotâthe woodâthe faded greenâ The moonâthe skyâthe distant moving lightâ All!âall are gathering on his dampened sight. His warrior-helm and plume, his fresh-dyed blade Beneath a window, on the turfare laid: The panes are ruddy thro' the clambering vines And blushing leaves, that Summer intertwines In warmer tints than e'er luxuriant Spring, O'er flower-embosomed roof led wandering. His pulses quickenâfor a rude old door Is opened by the wind: he sees the floor Strewed with white sand, on which he used to trace His boyhood's battlesâand assign a place To charging hostsâand give the Indian yellâ And shout to hear his hoary grandsire tell, How he had fought with savages, whose breath He felt upon his cheek like mildew till his death. Hark!âthat sweet song!âhow full of tenderness! O, who would breathe in this voluptuous press Of lulling thoughts!âso soothing and so low; Like singing fountains in their faintest flowâ It is as if some holyâlovely thing, Within our very hearts were murmuring, The soldier listens, and his arms are prest In thankfulness, and trembling on his breast: Nowâon the very window where he stands, Are seen a clambering infant's rosy hands: And nowâah heaven!âblessings on that smile!â Stay, soldier stayâO, linger yet awhile! An airy vision now appears, with eyesâ As tender as the blue of weeping skies Yet sunny in their radiance, as that blue, When sunset glitters on its falling dew; With formâall joy and danceâas bright and free As youthful nymph of mountain Liberty: Or naked angels dreamt by poesy: A blooming infant to her heart is prest; And ahâa mother's song is lulling it to rest! A youthful mother! God of heaven! is there A thing beneath the skies, so holy or so fair! A single bound!âour chief is standing by, Trembling from head to foot with ecstacyâ âBless thee!ââat length he murmuredââbless thee, love! âMy wife!âmy boy:ââTheir eyes are raised above. His soldier's tread of sounding strength is gone: A choking transport drowns his manly tone: He sees the closing of a mild, blue eye, His bosom echoes to a faint low cry: His glorious boy springs freshly from its sleep; Shakes his thin sun-curls, while his eye-beams leap, As half in fearâalong the stranger's dressâ Thenâhalf advancingâyields to his caress:â Thenâpeers beneath his locks, and seeks his eye, With the clear look of radiant infancy, The cherub smile of love, the azure of the sky. The stranger now, is kneeling by the side Of that young mother;âwatching for the tide Of her returning life:âit comesâa glow Goesâfaintlyâslowlyâo'er her cheek and brow: A rising of the gauze that lightly shrouds A snowy breastâlike twilight's melting cloudsâ In nature's pure, still eloquence, betrays The feelings of the heart that reels beneath his gaze. She lives! she livesâsee how her feelings speak, Thro' what transparency of eye and cheek! Her colour comes and goes, like that faint ray, That flits o'er lilies at the close of day. O nature, how omnipotent!âthat sighâ That youthful mother, in her ecstacy, Feels but the wandering of a husband's eye. Her lip now ripens, and her heaving breast Throbs wildly in its light, and now subsides to rest. And now a father grasps his martial hand; A mother and a sister leaning standâ A motherâin her adorationâthere!â With clasped hands and wildly streaming hair: A sisterâwith a lip of pulpy red, Swelling and trembling at his martial tread; A fatherâand a soldier! one who feels All that a father mayâand yet his heart conceals. There they all stand! and thro' their gathering tears, The smile of gratitude and pride appears; While o'er his manly form their glances fall; To see his lordly heightâso fullâso tall; The gallant bearing of hi swelling chest; The lofty browâcommandingâand at rest! His springing portâhis strong, determined tread, That sounded like a threatâthe colour spread, In health's effulgent brownness, o'er his cheek; The glance of fire, in which there seemed to speak The tamelessness of one, who'd spend his life In battle and in stormâin tempest and in strife. There stands the man of blood! now search his eye; See ye aught there of that cool mastery, That dwells on danger with untroubled look? Aught of that deadly calmness, that will brook No flame of challenge in another's gaze? Aught of that desperate meaning, which betrays The eye that is familiar with the deed Of midnight battle, where the mighty bleed? When valourâmanhoodâperish by the blow From unseen hands, that lay the coward low? Noâye may not. That youthful glance, less tame Than the quick flashing of a meteor flameâ Is yet of generous omenânot the light That burns vindictive on the blasted sight: That streams from bloody falchionsâlights the field Of midnight slaughter, where the mighty yield Their spirits to their God, in silent fightâ The war of murderersâwakened but in night! His is the flashing eye that courts the dayâ The pawing steedâthe hornâthe full display Of columnsâbannersâmartial minstrelsyâ The drums of earthâthe echoes of the skyâ The trumpet-song of Death and cannon pealing high! âMy son,â the old man said, âto-morrow nightâ âI learn ye mingle in a glorious fight. âRemember then my words. This form, so old, âOnce moved in blood, where mighty Battle tolled âThe warrior-knell in storm. In that dread hour âMy heart was always sad. The sinewy power âThat strung my arm, was not the gallant tide âThat leaps at the far trump in rushing pride. âThe blaze that wrapped my eye, was not the fire âThat kindles redly at the battle quire. âReligion, and my country nerved my arm, âFed my young heart, and kept my eye-beam warm. âMy gallant boyâI know thou art full brave, âThat evening battle groundâmay be thy bloody grave!â âOh no!â the mother cries:âand now they weep And prayâas we will pray when we're asleep, With ashy lipâa suffocating prayerâthat dies In broken murmurs, and in struggling sighs: As we will pray, when thro' the brooding shade Unholy sights, by Terror's torch betrayed, Come thronging, darkly, in deliriumâ With heavy wingâwith cloudy breathâand hum Of one unceasing knell: in lonely woeâ In sullen bodingâlike the heavy flow Of far, far waves, where one we love is sleepingâ When we are setâwe know not howâa weeping. The young wife stoops,âas she would hide her tears; And smile with hope, while bowing down with fears: With heart that pants and flutters to be free, Like some young nestling, stolen from its tree, That heaves its bosomâshakes its dazzling plume, A pulse of light and life, entrapped within a tomb! Hark!âfrom the distant shore far trumpets sweep! One last embrace: once more they meet and weep: Around that dear, loved group, once more is shed A farewell smileâa parting tear: then sped The husband to the war! With unhung brand, And helmeted for strife, he joins his band! CANTO III.

THERE are harps that complain to the presence of night, To the presence of night aloneâ In a near and unchangeable toneâ Like winds, full of sound, that go whispering byâ As if some immortal had stooped from the skyâ And breathed out a blessingâand flown! Yes!âharps that complain to the breezes of night; To the breezes of night aloneâ Growing fainter and fainter, as ruddy and bright, The sun rolls aloft, in his drapery of lightâ Like a conqueror, shaking his brilliant hair, And flourishing robe, on the edge of the air: Burning crimson and gold, On the clouds that unfoldâ Breaking onward in flame!âwhile an ocean divides On his right and his leftâSo the Thunderer rides! When he cuts a bright path through the heaving tides; Rolling onâand erectâin a charioting throne! Yes!âstrings that lie still in the gushing of day; That awake, all alive!âto the breezes of nightâ There are hautboys and flutes too, for ever at play, When the evening is near, and the sun is awayâ Breathing out the still hymn of delight. These strings by invisible fingers are played:â By spiritsâunseenâand unknownâ But thick as the stars!âall this musick is madeâ And these flutes, alone, In one sweet dreamy toneâ Are ever blown For ever and for ever; The live-long night ye hear the sound, Like distant waters flowing round, In ringing cavesâwhile heaven is sweet With crowding tunes, like halls Where fountain-musick falls, And rival minstrels meet! 'Tis dark abroad. The majesty of Night Bows down superbly from her utmost height: Stretches her starless plumes across the world; And all the banners of the wind are furled. How heavily we breathe amid such gloom! As if we slumbered in creation's tomb. It is the noon of that tremendous hour, When life is helpless, and the dead have power: When solitudes are peopled: when the sky Is swept by shady wings that, sailing by, Proclaim their watch is set; when hidden rills Are chirping on their course; and all the hills Are bright with armour:âwhen the starry vests And glittering plumes, and fiery twinkling crests Of moon-light sentinels, are sparkling round, And all the air is one rich floating sound: When countless voices, in the day unheard, Are piping from their haunts: and every bird That loves the leafy wood, and blooming bower, And echoing cave, is singing to her flower: When every lovelyâevery lonely place, Is ringing to the light and sandaled pace Of twinkling feet; and all about, the flow Of new-born fountains murmuring as they go: When watery tunes are richestâand the call Of wandering streamlets, as they part and fall In foaming melody, is all around; Like fairy harps beneath enchanted ground. Sweet drowsy distant musick! like the breath Of airy flutes that blow before an infant's death. It is that hour when listening ones will weep And know not why: when we would gladly sleep Our lastâlast sleep; and feel no touch of fear,â Unconscious where we areâor what is near, 'Till we are startled by a falling tear, That unexpected gathered in our eye, While we were panting for yon blessed sky: That hour of gratitudeâof whispering prayer, When we can hear a worship in the air: When we are lifted from the earth, and feel Light fanning wings around us faintly wheel, And o'er our lids and brow a blessing steal: And thenâas if our sins were all forgivenâ And all our tears were wipedâand we in heaven! It is that hour of quiet ecstacy, When every ruffling wind, that passes by The sleeping leaf, makes busiest minstrelsy; When all at once! amid the quivering shade, Millions of diamond sparklers are betrayed! When dry leaves rustle, and the whistling song Of keen-tuned grass, comes piercingly along: When windy pipes are heardâand many a lute Is touched amid the skies, and then is mute: When even the foliage on the glittering steep, Of feathery bloomâis whispering in its sleep: When all the garlands of the precipice, Shedding their blossoms, in their moonlight bliss, Are floating loosely on the eddying air, And breathing out their fragrant spirits there: And all their braided tresses flutteringâbright, Are sighing faintly to the shadowy light: When every cave and grotâand bower and lake, And drooping floweret-bell, are all awake: When starry eyes are burning on the cliff Of many a crouching tyrant too, as if Such melodies were grateful even to him: When life is loveliestâand the blue skies swim In lustre, warm as sunshineâbut more dim: When all the holy sentinels of night Step forth to watch in turn, and worship by their light. Such is the hour!âthe holy, breathless hour, When such sweet minstrelsy hath mightiest power: When sights are seen, that all the blaze of day Can never rival, in its fierce display: Such is the hourâyet not a sound is heard; No sights are seenâno melancholy bird Sings tenderly and sweet; but all the air Is thick and motionlessâas if it were A prelude to some dreadful tragedy; Some midnight drama of an opening sky! The Genius of the mountain, and the wood; The stormy Eagle, and her rushing brood; The fire-eyed tenant of the desert cave; The gallant spirit of the roaring wave; The star-crowned messengers that ride the air; The meteor watch-light, with its streamy hair, Threatening and sweeping redly from the hill; The shaking cascadeâand the merry rill Are hushed to slumber nowâand heaven and earth are still. And now the daylight comes!âslowly it rides, In ridgy lustre o'er the cloudy tides, Like the soft foam upon the billow's breast; Or feathery light upon a shadowy crest; The morning Breezes from their slumbers wake, And o'er the distant hill-tops cheerly shake Their dewy locks, and plume themselves, and poise Their rosy wings, and listen to the noise Of echoes wandering from the world below: The distant lake, rejoicing in its flow: The bugles ready cry: the labouring drum: The neigh of steedsâand the incessant hum That the bright tenants of the forest send: The sunrise gun: the heaveâthe waveâand bend Of everlasting trees, whose busy leaves Rustle their song of praise, while Ruin weaves A robe of verdure for their yielding bark; While mossy garlandsârich, and full, and dark, Creep slowly round them. Monarchs of the wood! Whose mighty sceptres sway the mountain brood! Whose aged bosoms, in their last decay, Shelter the winged idolaters of day: Who, 'mid the desert wild, sublimely stand, And grapple with the storm-god hand to hand! Then drop like weary pyramids away; Stupendous monuments of calm decay! As yet the warring thunders have not rent The swimming clouds, the brightening firmament, The lovely mists that float around the skyâ Ruddy and rich with fresh and glorious dye, Like hovering seraph wingsâor robe of Poesy! Now comes the sun forth! not in blaze of fire: With rain-bow-harnessed coursers, that respire An atmosphere of flame. No chariot whirls O'er reddening clouds. No sunny flag unfurls O'er rushing smoke. No chargers in array Scatter thro' heaven and earth their fiery spray. No shouting charioteer, in transport flings Ten thousand anthems, from tumultuous strings: And round and round, no fresh-plumed echoes dance: No airy minstrels in the flush light glance: No rushing melody comes strong and deep: And far away no fading winglets sweep: No boundless hymning o'er the blue-sky rings, In hallelujahs to the King of Kings: No youthful hours are seen. No riband lash, Flings its gay stripings like a rainbow flash, While starry crowns, and constellations fade Before the glories of that cavalcade, Whose trappings are the jewelry of heaven, Embroidered thickly on the clouds of even. No!âno!âhe comes not thus in pomp, and light! A new creation bursting out of night! But he comes darkly forth! in storm arrayedâ Like the red Tempest marshalled in her shade, When mountains rock; and thunders travelling round, Hold counsel in the skyâand midnight trumps resound. Hark! the deep drums again;âthe echoing drums! Their rousing loudly through the clear air comes. And trumpets dread hourra!âits plunging blast Left every heartâa-heavingâas it past. In that wild threatening cry, how much of life! Of martial song:âthe minstrelsy of strife. A flash!âa vapour! from yon fading cloud The cannon's voice comes suddenly aloud: Now bursts the smothered war! and proudly rise Fresh plumes and banners, blazing to the skies! And further still, the loud artillery rolls Uninterrupted thunder to the poles! That morning sun uprose o'er swelling hearts, That e'er the evening sun once more departs, Shall cease to swell on earth. That trumpet's voice For the last time hath called them to rejoice: Yesâmany a pulse now fiercely throbbing there, Hath heard its requiem in the morning air. A horseman!âsurely we have seen that steedâ His reaching stepâhis flowing maneâhis speed: The rein is loosenedâupward to the heaven, He leaps, as if the battle blast were given! That youthful riderâwhat an awful brow!â How calm and grand!âand now he nodsâand nowâ Faith,â'tis a glorious vision! how his hair Is blown about his cheek, as if it were A living richness clustering in the air! His chest is heaving, and his sunny eye Goes bright and fearless o'er the clear blue sky: That lipâthat brow, that ardent, piercing look In battle's wildest uproar never shook: No frowningâand no effortâalways bright, And always carelessâalwaysâeven in fight: And yet that smile of his, that waving hand, And nodding plume, among his chosen band, Have a determined and despotick sway, O'er hearts and souls,âthat never would obey The lordliest frown that ever sat in cloud; The stormiest voice that ever raged aloud: The darkest helm that ever nodded proud: His is a spirit of that mighty power, That moves the calmest in the troubled hour: An eye that, even in danger, threatens not; Calmâfrank and generousâne'er to be forgot, That, even in strife, looks forth with beams of peace, And brightens as the thunders of the battle cease. His march was victoryâand his charger's tread Hath been familiar with the warrior's bedâ The battle field! His brow was always bare, His head thrown backâhis right arm in the air! His charger leapingâplungingâas he came, And went amid the battle wrapped in flame; While o'er him waved the star-flag, thick with smoke; Unharmed he satâand like the thunder spoke: Nodding his tall plumes to the trumpet-blast The fiercest in the strife, but when 'twas past, The first to sheathe his bladeâto leave the battle, last. The drum is rolled again. The bugle sings; And far upon the wind the cross flag flings A radiant challenge to its starry foe, That floatsâa sheet of light!âawayâbelow, Where troops are formingâslowly in the night Of mighty waters; where an angry light Bounds from the cataract, and fills the skies With visionsârainbowsâand the foamy dyes, That one may see at morn in youthful poet's eyes. Niagara! Niagara! I hear Thy tumbling waters. And I see thee rear Thy thundering sceptre to the clouded skies: I see it waveâI hear the ocean rise, And roll obedient to thy call. I hear The tempest-hymning of thy floods in fear: The quaking mountains and the nodding treesâ The reeling birdsâand the careering breezeâ The tottering hills, unsteadied in thy roar: Niagara! as thy dark waters pour, One everlasting earthquake rocks thy lofty shore! There spreads the red cross-banner, far and wide, Flapping its dark blue, as 'tis wont to ride O'er the red tempest, on the mountain-tide. The troops of Wellington are there; a bandâ Nursed by stern Glory in her favourite land: The guardians of the Spaniard, when subdued, And trampled in the dust: a band that stood Forth with that banner, floating like a shroud, And battled on the mountainâin a cloudâ With highâstupendous Gaul, until her genius bowed. Stern eyes are lifted to it, as it leans Away upon the breeze: and long past scenes Of home and country, o'er the heaving mainâ Of fire-side peace, are conjured up again: Parentsâand wifeâand childrenâand young eyes Of weeping love, are looking from the skies: And murmuring prayers are near again: and dreams Of parting lips: and many a dark eye beams Upon its soldier's heart, as it had done, When they had partedâparted!âall alone; And every friend he had, was going one by one. From the horizon now, a gathering cloud Comes darkly o'er the hills; and now a crowd Of mothers, fathers, sisters, lovers, friends, Come forth to pray for those whom Glory sends, In pomp and fever to the field of death; A throng, who came to pour their erring breath, To himâthe GOD OF PEACE!âwho sits on high; To pray that he will bless the fiery eye; And bloody hand, that smites in iron wrath A brother to the dust!âand light the path Of him who rides in battle and in blood, Carving that brother for the shrieking brood, That snuff the coming war, and drink the vital flood. Yonder on snow-white charger, treading proud, A red-cross chieftain goes to meet that crowd: An aged warrior, and a valiant one: A hero of the battles that are done. The fife sounds cheerly! and their steady tread, And long, firm steppings, as their columns spread; Their glancing splendours o'er the distant hill: Their flapping bannersâand their horns that fill All heaven, and earth, and air with martial song, As their proud foot-line winds its length along, Would seem the pageantry of Peace, instead Of battle cavalcade by Slaughter led. Who is that drooping one with snowy breast; Shrinking like virgins when they're first carest; With full, dark eye, and melancholy smile, And glistening lash, that's standing there the while That aged man comes up? How pale that cheek! And yet how eloquent! O, she can speak, With that dark lash and that slow dropping tear, Unutterable thoughtsâwhen one is near, In solitude and silenceâthat is dear. But see!âshe movesâand now her wild, dark ey Is flashingâlifted: something passes by: A youth in armour! what a glorious face! And now he reins his barb: with what a graceâ He waves his snowy helmetâand his handâ How full of noble spirit and command! A gallant glorious formâbut yet a boy: An eye of terror and a lip of joy; Sure he has lost the rein!âhis fiery steed Goes plunging so, with such a fearful speed: He has! he has!âa shriek! he has indeed! That waving of his helmâthat loosened reinâ O Godâthe precipice!âit is in vainâ Yet stayâwhat death-like silenceânow he wheels! And every heart breathes out: and every bosom feels The cool air coming freshlyâcan it be! Is that the fiery steed? can this be he? The riderâthat was bending o'er the mane? This the fierce steed that caught the loosened rein? Foaming he comes, with glossy neck arched high, And stately step, and wildly rolling eyeâ Rattling his bits, and reaching with his headâ This that fierce steed? why, how composed his tread. The horseman too, how steady, light and high Sits the young spirit with his lightning eye, And smiling lip. See how his panting breast Is heaving yet beneath his studded vest: The gathered reinâthe firm, elastick seat Of airy grace: how youngâyet how complete! Forth flies his bladeâthe aged warrior comesâ Bow the high banners! roll the answering drums! And now amid a throng of sparkling eyes In terror lifted to the bright blue skies, Slow tears of thankfulness and joy are flowing; And round about a languid cheek are flowing, Rich silkiness and shade: and faintlyâslow, A lovely hand goes o'er a brow of snowâ In woman's meekestâloveliest helplessnessâ The lifeless grace of beauty in distress: But see! she wakesâand forth with glittering eye, And burning cheekâand form erect and high, She steps in light! That melancholy maid Stands like Minerva for the war arrayed! How altered! yet how lovely in her change! How sudden and completeâindeed 'tis strange That such a transformation should be wrought So instantaneouslyâ'twas brief as thought. Now banners float, and 'mid the tented plain She and the warrior meet: and o'er the mane Of his white steed, he bows and smilesâand now, Presses his old lip to her snowy brow; âFarewell, my childâfarewell!â the warrior says, His high plume shaking in the sunny blaze: And glancing to her heart its cheerful dye, As hurryingâfaulteringâwith averted eyeâ That tells for whom the silent prayer is madeâ While on her heart one trembling hand is laid, She waves the other as they speed away, Where the keen streamers of the Briton play. A tear came slowly in her wandering eye; The parting seemed so sadâshe knew not whyâ As far upon the wind the white steed flew, Like grey hound brushing off the heather's morning dew. Yon sick man, bending to the earth, hath been In the red strife himselfâhath often seen In other days, a flashing helm laid low, While yet it shook in triumph o'er its foe: In that gay band whose tramp is passing far, That go in revelry and song to war, That sick man has a brotherâyoung and brave; That brother!âhe is riding to his grave. A farewell swinging of his martial band Tells to his heartâwhat soldiers understandâ That he will conquer!âor will bravely lie With cloven crest and bosom to the sky, And never tinge his cheek, altho' he dim his eye. âMy lastâlast hope!â a mother cries, and kneels, While o'er the hills a sound of tumult reels; Is it the war-song rushing in the breeze? Parents and friends, it is the bending trees. Go speed ye home, and spend your day in prayer; To-morrow's sun may wake ye to despair. Go kneel ye on some desert rock, and pray, Unceasingly and deep, the live-long day, To Him whose angels calm the stormy fray: The time is coming when your troubled sleep Shall throng with bloody ghosts; when ye shall weep Whene'er the thunders rollâor lightnings stream; Whene'er the storm is loudâor panthers scream; And fancy 'tis the strife, and feel the battle dream. The cavalcade went by. The day hath gone! And yet the soldier lives: his cheerful tone Rises in boisterous song: while slowly calls The monarch spirit of the mighty falls. Soldiers be firm!âand mind your watch fires well: Sleep not to-nightâthere comes a distant swell, Like the approaching step of toiling steeds, Encountering on the hills: and far behind us speeds. Low stooping from his arch, the glorious sun Hath left the storm with which his course begun; And now, in rolling cloud, goes calmly home, In heavenly pompâa-down the far blue dome. In sweet-toned minstrelsy is heard the cry, All clear and smooth, along the echoing sky, Of many a fresh blown bugle, full and strong, The soldier's instrument! the soldier's song! Niagara too, is heard: his thunder comes Like far-off battleâhosts of rolling drums. All o'er the western heaven, the flaming clouds Detach themselves, and float like hovering shrouds: Loosely unwoven, and far unfurled, A sunset canopy enwraps the world. The vesper hymn grows soft. In parting day Wings flit about. The warblings die away, The shores are dizzy, and the hills look dim, The cataract falls deeper and the landscapes swim. CANTO IV. Evening continued ..... preparations for battle ..... British occupy an eminence ..... Americans approach ..... battle on the wings ..... Americans carry the British artillery at the point of the bayonet ..... three successive attempts made by the British to dislodge the Americans, and regain the height .....Americans remain in possession ..... Niagara. AWAY, away,âto the winds away! With your banners of flame, and give them play! The battle, in wrath, is coming! A flock of young vultures are poising their wings And the untrodden solitude rings, With voicesâand trumpetsâand drumming! From away in the cloudless air, Where all is so soft and sereneâ That never a speck can be seen, There comes a cry, As if it were Some unseen eaglet in the sky, Stooping down on her shrieking, invisible prey; And the dim arch of heaven is bright With the luminous flight, Of birdsâflocking upwardâall red With the bloodiest tint that the sun ever shed: Swarming out from the mistâwhere the water rolls whiteâ And scaling away in the changeable light, As if warmed into life by the sun-setting ray: Coming out from the cloudsâthey emergeâ Like the birds of the sea from the surge, When they trim their bright wings on the billow verge; And dashing their plumes in the brilliant foamâ Arch their necks in the sun, as he stoops to his homeâ All lovely in lightâand sublime in display! Now the rising air brings The faint touching of strings, From cavernsâwhere harpers have never been heard; As ifâin each green silent place, Where ancient bards had been interred, Their spirits rose again to trace, In lowâprophetic murmurings, Just like the soft approach of wings, The fate of yonder host, that comeâ Unhallowedâto intrudeâ With bannerâbladeâand horn and drumâ Upon their charmed solitude: As ifâeach seated on his tomb, And stooping o'er his shadowy lyreâ With trembling fingers tore away The tendrils that ran wild in bloom, Encumbering each golden wireâ And faulteringâtouched the awful layâ All energy, and fireâ That visions of the war inspire:â When all the heaven is opening round, And battles dimly seenâ Like cloudsâin passing o'er the groundâ Are shadowed on its green. When all the future tremblesâwhenâ Unseen but by the gifted eyeâ Tumultuous air sweeps o'er the skyâ Wheeling like coursers giddilyâ When every holy spot on earth, Is heaving with some awful birth, And every grot and hermitage, And every lonely place, againâ Is filled with shapes of armed menâ And echoes to their stormy rageâ Reproachful soundsâwhile they engage. When all their ancient spirits hear The neigh of steeds encountering near; The uproar of the battleâand The sweep of the unsparing brand, Dealt whistling with immortal forceâ Unchannelling the blood of those That nature never meant for foesâ E'en at the fountain of its course:â Of menâwho if they met at allâ Should meet in places, such as theseâ Embracing heart and soulâand fall In worship on their bended kneesâ And speakânot with the battle shoutâ As if their souls were bursting outâ But faintâand whisperingâas they were Assembled by their God in prayer: Oh yesâand they should ever come, When in such holy spots they meetâ Not with the hornânot with the drumâ And not with mailedâbut naked feet! But if they come in armourâthey Should lose the very wish to slayâ And dash their helmets down, and kneel Unharnessed to the influence thereâ Not stain and crush its spongy green With crimson tracks, like what are seen, Where panthers and where wolves have been, Tainting the cool and holy airâ Not with the warrior stepâbut tread Of menâintruding on the dead; Not helmeted and mailed aroundâ But with their gallant hair unbound, And fiery eye upon the groundâ Like pilgrims when they bowâalone Upon some consecrated stoneâ With tufted mossing all overgrownâ And washed with tears of men unknownâ By altarsârockyâhung in green, With shelly, bright entablatures, Enduring on, while time endures, And brightening every hour; Still thickeningâclusteringâmore and moreâ All pillared, and enamelled o'er; With arched roof and glimmering floor, Bestrewed with every brilliant flower, That ever bloomed in secret, where The sunset shows the golden path That leads you to the sea-maid's bath, Where theyâall nakedâglitteringâbright, With radiant tressesâlimbs as white, As they were shaped of moulded light, Stand combing out their glorious hair; Or, on the oily billows playâ And one by one then disappear, Like creatures vanishing awayâ And melting in the hues of dayâ Whenâsome dim earthly thing is near. But away!âaway!âto the winds away! With your banners of flame, and give them play! The battle in wrath is coming! See how their moving tents ariseâ With a snowy gleam, in the purple skies, Like pavilions of glittering lightâ Those tents are struck!âthe signal given! And nowâalong the verge of heaven With trumpeting and drumming, They're harnessing for fight! And now their opening flags arise, Unfurling bravely to the skies: And now!âagainst the red orb spreading Their broad, dark bannersâthey appear, All tinged with bloodâtheir distant rear, Against the light, the sun is shedding, Along the blue-edged heaven, stand, In flaming armourâlike a band Of giants, downward treading While all the moving forest trees, Upon yon hilly summits seem Approaching in the misty breeze,â And o'er the burning clouds that gleam Away behindâas if they were A swinging fret-workârichâand rare Embroidered on the flaming air; A light, fantastick edging given By magick to the clouds of heaven. But away!âaway!âto the winds away! With your banners of flameâin their red displayâ The battle in pomp is coming! The trumpet plays, And the drums are rolled; The war-horse neighs, And the flags unfold; And the distant hills are bright With warriorsâup in their mightâ The crimson mane of their helmets stream, Like fiery steeds, when their long hairs gleam, In the fearful light Of a reddening fight, In flakes and folds!âlike the awful beam Of broadswordsâground in blood; They are up!âthey are up!â'tis a thrilling sight; With their chargers reinedâ Each muscle strainedâ Tossing their foam on the winds away, As the waves of the ocean fling their sprayâ With their heads in air, Like steeds that bear Young warriors thro' a flood; While their voices breakâ (And their nostrils shake, And the loud horns blow, And the banners flowâ) Like a trumpet heard at night! With a thrilling neighâas if to cheer, The warriors that are thundering near: Then away!âaway!âto the winds away! Through the cloud of battle rouse your prey! Fresher and fresher comes the air. The blue Of yonder high pavilion swims in dew. The boundless hum that sunset waked in glee; The dark wood's vesper-hymn to Libertyâ Hath died away. A deep outspreading hush Is on the airâthe heavy watery rush Of far off lake-tides, and the weighty roll Of tumbling deeps, that fall upon the soul Like the strong lulling of the ocean wave, In dying thunder o'er the sailor's grave; And now and then a blueish flare is spread Faint o'er the western heaven, as if 'twere shed In dreadful omen to the coming dead. As ifâamid the skies, some warrior form Revealed his armour thro' a robe of storm! The shadows deepen. Now the leaden tramp Of stationed sentryâfarâand flatâand dampâ Sounds like the measured death-step, when it comes With the deep minstrelsy of unstrung drums: In heavy pompâwith pausesâo'er the grave Where soldiers bury soldiers: where the wave Of sable plumesâand darkened flags are seenâ And trailing-steedsâwith funeral lights between:â And folded armsâand boding hornsâand tread Of martial feet, descending to the bed, Where GloryâFameâAmbition lie in state, To give the nuptial clasp, and wreath that Fate Wove in the battle-storm, their brows to decorate. Listen!âO, listen!âthere's a wandering shout, A sound, as if a challenge passed about: A gun is heard! O, can it be indeed That on a night, like this, brave men may bleed! Now comes,âall rushingâwith a fiery startâ The struggling neigh of steeds, as if they part, Upon the mountain tops, where cloud-tides break, And rear upon the winds! and plunge, and shake Their voices proudly o'er a sleeping lake. A heavy walk is heard. They come, indeed; They come, the Star-troops! while the Eagle-breed Flap loudly o'er each helm, and o'er each foaming steed. Here, by our side, the red-cross troop is placed: A lordly banner, never yet disgraced By that young gallant troop. Beneath its fold Of blue magnificence, so wide unrolled, They've bowed, and sworn upon a naked blade, That banner, there! shall never be betrayed. They've sworn to bathe it in their heart's best blood: To loosen 'neath its fold their reddest flood. No threats escape their lipsâthat blue flag flies O'er the dark lowering of young British eyes. They know the post they hold they know the hour Is sternly coming that shall try their power: They know the Eagle troops: they hear their tread: And each more proudly heaves his youthful head: They see the starry banner floating wide: And fiercer shines their meteor in its pride: Each plants his foot: and each with steady eye And hard drawn breathâand forehead to the skyâ Looks on the coming host for life or deathâ The glittering laurel crown, or weeping cypress wreath. They come! they come!âthe starry flag is bright; Shaking its splendours in the parting light: Right martial is their step. Their heads are high. Their chests heave full. Their look is on the sky. Before his column with a brow serene, Upon his stately barb, a chief is seen: His head uncovered;âwhile his flashing eye, And echoed word, along the far ranks fly, With flash and sound as brief as counted musketry. Now roar the joyous drums! the trumpet-song Comes swellingârendingâburstingâall along! Like the dread summons by the Whirlwind cast, When she sings fiercely in the coming blast. The leader waves his sword! the standards bow, And now unrol upon the windâand now, Borne silently aloft, they flash away, Upon the distant wings, like heralds of the day. Their columns now unfold. Their martial tread Is firm and steady as they wheel and spread. Now one deep phalanx in their strength advance; Silent as death. Dimmed is the banner glance: The ringing harness and the sabre's swingâ No shouting stirs the bloodâno waving plume Gives Glory's signal in the thickening gloom: But forwardâforward!âwith unshaken tread, With Battle's earthquake march, when shuddering dead Feel every step that falls above their head. The soldiers of the red-cross, on the hill Wave high their matches!âAnd they stand as still As if they knew they stood upon their tomb: And some deep lips and cheeks now lose their bloom But not from fearâor if they didâwhat then? Their courage is the soul's!âthey are the men That ye may trust to in the hour of need: Their lips may fade 'tis true, but they will bleed, Where'er they set their foot, until their souls are freed. Now peals the thronged artillery!âFar and wide, Beyond the starry flag its thunders ride! No answer from the foeâ His steady tread Paused not a moment as that volley sped. Again the tempest pours! In rushing fire, Again the thunders roll! But all the higher Floats the striped flagâin triumph and in pride; Like the red rainbow o'er the glimmering tide. Still onward come its guards: determinedâslow: Mounting as if to grapple with their foe Within his cloud: While their battalions spread, And close, and open with the same strong tread, Revealed in light. That tempest light!âit strays In one wide sheet: uninterrupted blaze! Still onward come this band. Still no reply: Withholding all their might till, eye to eye, They tread the summit of that quaking mount, To quench that stormy lightâthat Ãtnean fount: Then will the clouds depart, and ye will see The Eagle-standard floating far and free; And gallant warriors, on the naked ground, In prostrate adorationâto the sound Of bursting trumpets, and of neighing steeds: And waving helms, whose reeking plumage bleeds With life of gallant hearts, that heave around In agony to hear the brazen trumpet's sound. Now comes the bursting strife. The answer peals! Forth, in a blaze of fire, their squadron wheels! Now rolls the battle! Fades the lightning sheet! The charge is given! Bayonets with bayonets meet: And struggling hearts with hearts: and fiercely rise Contending shouts and spirits to the skies. Neighings grow faint. The cannon's thunder dies: Red Slaughter shakes her storm-plumes o'er the slain, And flaps her reeking flagâbut all in vainâ For standards bow!âand steeds fly o'er the plain! 'Tis done: the strife is o'er. The clouds are goneâ The starry flag is floating there alone. And is the battle won? the struggle o'er? O, no!âthe trumpet song and cannon-roar Have but begun;âthe night shall wear away E'er banners blazing in their red display, And flashing plumes, and helmets glancing bright, Reveal the conquerors to the dazzled sight. Then ye shall see the shattered warrior-bladeâ The banner rent;âquenched plumeâand steed, that neighed, Like the fierce trumpet, when the battle pealed, With all his furniture upon the field, Bedimmed in gallant blood! Then ye may know Who were the conquered;âthey will all lie low. Far now the wet folds of the red-cross wave; Still leaning towards the strifeâfull, high, and brave; Still rolls the wide artillery;âstill the light Rushes in boding thickness from that heightâ But other hands direct its thunder now; The rainbow flag is there, with sheeted flow, And they with silent tread, and cool, determined brow. Amid the fading light on that red ground, An aged warrior lies, and pours a sound That tells of battle yet; and feebly tries To staunch his ebbing wound; to clear his eyes; And think once more, distinctly, of his home: But all in vain! a dark, and darker foam Comes from his heart; and now his dying hand Is once more stretchedâbut not as in commandâ No!ânot as if it dealt a warrior's brandâ And lightened thro' the war!âbut more in prayerâ As if some child, that he would bless, were there: Convulsiveâsuddenâgrasping!âtowards the heaven 'Tis reachedâlike oneâwhose last, last stay is riven: Not wavingâno!âbut closing as it goes, As if it sought another'sânot a foe's! And now it feebler dropsâand now, again,â 'Tis lifted as in prayer; but all in vain; He cannot bless his child!âhis strength is goneâ The damps of death are on his brow;âhis tone Of murmuring supplicationâdies awayâ And both his bloody hands are in his locks of grey. And near himâplantedâwith the glittering eye, Of sudden madnessârolling awfully,â A youthful form is seenâwith hands that press Upon his bosomâfixed and motionless! Now staring on the armour strown around, As in a trance: now listening to the sound Of ruffling banners, as they loosely wave, Like one that risesâarmedâfrom his grave In fierce rebuke. And nowâhave mercy heaven! He staggersâwaves his armâhis white brow riven, And streaming with his blood! And oh, that nod!â He moves again in light, as if he trod Upon the battle's vergeâand heaves his brow Of bleeding nakedness, as if e'en now, It wore the meteor signal for the fight: The tall plume nodding in its snowy white! And now he stands as if he would express Some princely thought, and felt his helplessness: And hark!âa shout!âa sudden, thrilling cryâ Of fearful energyââthey fly! they fly!â Again he waves his armâand shouts!âagain He stands as if he grasped some charger's mane, Some struggling barbâand strove to mount in vain:â Again he shouts!âagain he feebly tries To look once more upon the passing skiesâ Clasps his young hands, and reels, and falls, and dies. There flutters round him many a gallant soulâ For the last time too, many dim eyes roll;â And gaspingâswellingâin the sulphurous air Sobs many a broken cry, and many a prayer. Soldiers, and great onesâare around him laid, Who dealt their broad swords, like the gleaming blade That the Destroyer wields, when heaven is wrapped in shade. The battle comes again. The charging host Are Britonsâchosen onesâtheir army's boast. Reddening they come, in martyrdom to Fame; Shaking their snowy plumes in cloud and flame. rav ely their banner is abroad outspreadâ Alive their meteor, and their shroud when dead. The tumult deepens. Swell conflicting criesâ Neigh the loud steeds, and hurried sobs arise. Shakes the dark hill with cataracts of fire: Up go that army to their blazing pyre! The cannon's voice is mute. The lightning sheet Grows dim again. Warriors with warriors meet; And wrestle fiercely in their rolling cloud. Again the mountain shakes! again the light Comes thundering loudly downâthe starry flight Of spotted drapery is abroad again, And neighingâplungingâo'er the clouded plain, Goes many a fiery barb with crimson reeking mane: Again the meteors of the war are bowed: Again the mountain heaves beneath its shroud: Gushes with quenchless light, and shakes and storms aloud. So darkly clouded was that hill with smoke, Save when the vast artillery-day-light broke, It seemed a midnight altar. From its gloom There came the noise of strifeâas from a tomb. And then, distinct, amid the spreading light, Were seen the struggling champions of the fight, In silentâdesperateâdreadful bayonet strife; The midnight slaughter! when the hero's lifeâ The highâstern summons that he gives his bandâ His waving falchionâand extended handâ His towering plumeâhis charger's bloody maneâ The battle-anthem and the bugle strainâ Are beamlessâlifeless! heard and seen no more: Thus 'tis when bayonets hush the cannon's roar. The blazing would be gone! and with it, lo! These darkly wrestling groups would come and go, Like wizard shapes at nightâupon the snowâ That glitters to the moon, upon some mountain's brow. So stood the battle. Bravely it was fought. Lions and Eagles met. That hill was bought, And sold, in desperate combat. Wrapped in flame, Died these idolaters of bannered Fame. Three times that meteor hill was bravely lostâ Three times 'twas bravely won; while madly tost, Encountering red plumes in the dusky airâ While Slaughter shouted in her bloody lairâ And spectres blew their horns, and shook their whistling hair. A long and dreadful pause. No sound is heard But the fresh rustling of a mighty Bird, That sat upon the banner of that host: That Eagle of the strife!âwhen tempest tost, The boy, that rides sublime the mountain waves, Looks on that Bird in prayer. The Bird that laves Her sounding pinions in the sun's first gushâ Drinks his meridian blaze and sunset flush: Worships her idol in his fiercest hour: Bathes her full bosom in his hottest shower: Sits amid stirring stars, and bends her beak, Like the slipped falconâwhen her piercing shriek Tells that she stoops upon her cleaving wing, To drink anew some victim's clear-red spring. That monarch Bird! that slumbers in the night Upon the lofty air-peak's utmost height: Or sleeps upon the wingâamid the ray Of steadyâcloudlessâeverlasting day! Rides with the Thunderer in his blazing march: And bears his lightnings o'er yon boundless arch: Soars wheeling thro' the storm, and screams away Where the young pinions of the morning play: Broods with her arrows in the hurricane: Bears her green laurel o'er the starry plainâ And sails around the skies, and o'er the rolling deeps, With still unwearied wing, and eye that never sleeps. The rustling of the silk alone is heard, Where burns that soldier idolâmountain Bird! And the deep groans of dying men, who heave Their last sad prayer; of those who bleed and grieve, In shattered manhood, on the bloody path, That led where Glory sat in stormy wrath; The faint, low watchwordâand the thronging trampâ The ringing harness of the distant camp: And the flood anthem on the night winds blown, Sullen and heavy as the Thunderer's tone, When far amid the Alps his chariot rolls, And the high mountain quakes: and the far poles Rock in their outspread canopy of cloudâ When seas heave darkly in their tempest shroud, And everlasting hills are echoing aloud. CANTO V. Morning ..... appearance of the field ..... funeral honours ...... parade ..... interment ..... camp ..... death of the Hero ..... his father and wife. THE battle is o'er!âand the night is pastâ The battle is o'er! The clouds that were rolling away on the blast, With the warrior-helm, and the steed's red mane; Have vanished away, With the coming of day, Or lie all along on the verge of the plain, And are seen no more. The battle is o'er! The battle is o'er! And the menâand the steedsâand the banners thereâ Crowding and thronging in the blazing air, Have all disappeared in its crimson glareâ The battle is o'er! And the morning comes, With the cannon roar, And the roll of drums; With the furling of flagsâand the stooping of helmsâ With weltering manesâlike steeds that have past A torrent at nightâexhaustedâcast On the shoreâwith thoseâthat the night overwhelms, With floating reins, And clotted manes, And harness stainedâand dark with blood; With a ridge of foamâon each courser's chestâ As ifâin the fightâthey had plunged to the breast, In some crimson foaming flood. But the war is o'er! On that silent shore, And the vulture that shrieked in the night is goneâ And gluttedâhath fled From the banquet of deadâ The trumpets are hushedâand the battle is done. No more ye'll hear the furious drum Rolling aloud deliriumâ But the steeds that have neighed through the nightâ That stand with their sinews quivering yet, Their trappings entangledâand wetâ Shall go forth undisturbedâ Unharnessedâuncurbedâ For ever and aye to the fight! Young Morning comes again! with garments blown Abroad upon the wind; and flow'rets thrown In garland tresses o'er her opening breast; With diamonds dropping from her airy crest. Young Morning comes again! with laughing eye, With bustling cherubs thronging up the sky; And pulling thro' the air by braided flowers Sweet Nature's wicker work! her wild-wood bowers! Young Morning comes again! in floating car Of tangled roses: o'er the hill of war She throws her mantle, kindling on the sight, With all the hues of heaven's own rainbow-light: Of woven jasperâthreaded sapphireâgold: And sunshineâpearlsâembossed upon its foldâ And thickening gems: a diamond flag unrolled! The sheathless weapon glimmers on the sight: Pale cheeks and sunken eyes once more are brightâ But not with life, O, no!âtheir souls have flown: Their last dread trump amid the fight was blown. Their feathers glance again; an idle red Burns o'er their prostrate forms and bloody bed. Here was the deadliest strife! this youthful group Are the last remnants of a martyred troop. Here their young banner waved! and hereâthey fell! There lies that banner!âlet its fragments tell, Yet grasped in deathâif 'twas defended well. The rich, green sward is scarred with leaping hoofs; And all along the field are seen the proofs Of soldier rivalry. And where ye tread Along the hill, the very turf turns red, As 'twere surcharged with blood:âwhile all aboutâ As from an o'er-pressed sponge, there issues out A thickening purpleâsettlingâeddying where The print of charging hoofs have laid the green all bare, Filling the footsteps of unwounded men With bloodâdark bloodâthat's ne'er absorbed again, And round aboutâopposing plumes and crests Of snow and crimson lieâthe reeking tests, That prove where soldiers metâand stroveâand died! In pairs they lieâembracingâside by side. A strong, strong death is in their hard-clenched hands; Their mingled trappings, and their hiltless brands:â The desperate graspâthe half raised form!âand eye Yet glaring with the threat of agony: The bleeding banner and the dripping crest: The dying war-horse, with his heaving chest, Yet struggling to arise, and o'er the plain Blaze forth in dimmed caparisons againâ And loosen to the wind his crimson streaming mane! O, there's no mockery like the morning light, Smiling o'er relicks of a bloody night; Like a red lustre on a barren mount: Like the rich moon-beam o'er a silent fount, Swimming in feverish splendour, while it tells, But the more certain, where the turf-home swellsâ Where Hope is stretched in death, and Desolation dwells. As on a mountain altar, thick are laid, These midnight victims to the Battle-shade: Slain in the darkness, by an unseen handâ With eye half closedâdead hairâand shivered brand: In solitude they lie!âwith no friend near: Not stretched in soldier pomp upon the bier, With the high casqueâand crimson plumeâand sword, With blow of trumpetsâroll of drumsâand word Of slow commandâand dragging tramp of steedsâ And all the pageantry the dead man needsâ The banner stretching dark, and float of dusky weeds. Hear ye that sound? 'twould make the stoutest quail: It is the morningâlamentationâwail Of outbreathed hearts, that load the morning air; Of those who kneel among the dead in prayer,â Collecting relicksâlocks of bloody hair. Who thinks of battle now? The stirring sounds Spring lightly from the trumpet, yet who bounds On this sadâstillâand melancholy morn, As he was wont to bound, when the fresh horn Came dancing on the winds; and pealed to heaven! In gone-by hours, before the battle-even? The very horses move with halting pace: No more they heave their manes with fiery graceâ With plungeâand reachâand step that leaves no trace: No more they spurn the bit, and sudden fling Their light hoofs on the air! The bugles sing; And yet the meteor mane, and rolling eye Lighten no longer at their minstrelsy. No more their housings blaze: no more the gold, Or purple, flashes from the opening fold: No rich-wrought stars are glittering in their pride Of changing hues allâall!âis crimson-dyed. They move with slowâfar step: they hear the tread That measures out the tombing of the dead: The cannon speaks: but now, no longer rolls In heavy thunders to the answering poles. But bursting suddenly, it calls, and fliesâ At breathless intervals along the skies,â As if some viewless sentinel were there, Whose challenge peals at midnight thro' the air; Each sullen steed goes onânor heeds its roar: Nor pauses when its voice is heard no more: But snuffs the tainted breeze, and lifts his headâ And slowly wheelingâwith a cautious treadâ Shunsâas in reverenceâthe mighty dead: Orârearing suddenly!âwith flashing eye, Where some young war-horse liesâhe passes by. Then, with unequal step, he smites the ground, Utters a startling neighâand gazes roundâ And wonders that he hears no answering sound. This!âwhile his rider can go by the bier Of slaughtered men, and never drop a tear. And onlyâwhen he meets a comrade thereâ Stretched calmly outâwith brow and bosom bareâ And stiffened hand uplifted in the air,â With lip still curledâand open, glassy eye, Fixed on the pageant that is passing by;â And only thenâin decency will ride Less stately in his strengthâless lordly in his pride. Now shouts the trump again! The muskets ring! Drums travel loud!âand merry bugles sing! And once more, in the breeze, the rainbow banners swing! Such sounds are wanted, when the morning red Comes warm and richly o'er unburied dead: The brawling drum must roll: the keen-toned fife, Must sting the sluggish pulses into life; Or all that had survived would kneel in prayer; And pour their hearts out in the morning air: And consecrate their bloody swords to peace; And call for mercy, loud; and never cease Their supplications, till the God of Heaven Had offered them some sign that murder was forgiven. Come, Glory, come! Let's chant the soldier's dirge: Step from thy thrones, and from thy clouds emerge! Bring thy black cypress clotted in the shade: Of weeping-willow let a wreath be made, To crown the warrior-brow, that lately sought Thy battle-laurel: him who lately fought Reddest and fiercest, where the war-god sung: Where the loud death-sobs came, and falchions rung; Twine him a heavy garland! steep it well; And mutter o'er its gloom thy darkest spell; With broken heart-strings, be it twisted round; Tread it in wrath upon the soaking ground; And where the stagnant blood lies deepest, there Complete thy curseâthe chaplet of despair! Call back his spirit from the eternal bar: Show him that clotted foliageâtalk of war; Wake thy swift bugle, let it sing away Freshly and clear, like clarion of the day! Loosen thy banners on the mountain winds! Call up thy thunders!âwhile thy hot hand binds, That wreath around his mad, consuming brainâ Tell him 'tis his reward!âwill he complain Of wasted lifeâof bloody hand arrayed In sacrifice for thee?âwhen blade met blade; And man met man, and like the desert beast, That bleeds and battles 'till his breath has ceased; Toiled dark upon the mount to spread the vultures, feast. A solemn march is heard: a measured tread:â Banners are furled againâand o'er the dead, By martial hands, the crimson pall is spread. A band on foot approach, they bear a form, Like the rent mountain oak, that braves the stormâ Heaves its young branches to the raging skiesâ Receives the Thunderer's boltâand prostrate lies! Whence is that bandâand whose the form they bear With highâpale brow, and darkly clustered hair? That hair is wetâbut not with dews of night; Its lifeless length was loaded in the fight. Disfiguredâmotionlessâwith bosom bareâ And armâstill stretched abroad!âhe slumbers there. He was careering in the hottest fight; His black barb leaping in his stormy might; His bannerâfloating loudly on the ear, As if some mighty Bird were hovering near: His starry troops were conquering at his side; Their plumes were blazing in their fiercest prideâ When suddenlyâhis heart!âits lordly swell Was gone for ever!âas he dimly fell, His hand once stretched his sabre to his foes! His form dilated!âmore erect he rose!â His dark eye flashed once more!âbut flashed in vain: His wounded charger felt the loosened rein:â Felt the strong hand that grasped his bloody maneâ And sprang to bear him off!âOne desperate boundâ One gallant neigh he gave!âand on the ground Stretched his dark limbsâtriumphantlyâand died! On the wide battle fieldâin warrior pride; Far from the noise of strife, and by his master's side. Know ye that formâthose featuresâand that air? Have ye e'er seen that thickly clustered hair? That!âwas the brown-cheeked youth, with eye of fire, Who rode a courser like the winds. His sire Bows proudly o'er his course. His bloody bier With precious dew is bathedâthe cold sad tearâ The heart's last offering! o'er those ruins fall, That lie concealed beneath a bleeding pall: And one is there, whose trembling hands are prest In desperate calmness on her swelling breast: Whose muteâpale lipâwhose sadly wandering eye Speaks more than sorrowâsufferingâagony!â While gazing tearless on the form before her; Father of Mercies! Father! Oh, restore her! GOLDAU: OR THE MANIAC HARPER. TO THE READER. THIS story is not a fiction;âthe principal circumstances stand on record. On the 3d of September, 1806, about sunset, the Spitzberg, a part of mount Rosburg, in the canton of Schweitz, Switzerland, slid from its base; and from a height of more than two thousand feet, overwhelmed three whole villages, and upward of fifteen hundred peasants; leaving the rocks all naked in its path, and transforming an extensive valley into a hill. Among the villages destroyed was Goldau, the most romantick and beautiful of the three. UPON a tranquilâglorious night, When all the western heaven was bright; When, thronging down the far blue dome, The sun in rolling clouds went home;â There wandered to a goatherd's cot, A youthâwho sought to be forgot: Who many a long and weary year Had breathed his prayer and shed his tear. Beneath his look of cloud was seen, Somewhat, that told where fire had been; For yet, a sorrowing beam was there: A beamâin mockery of despair: A beam that gave enough of light To show his soul had set in night. His step was slowâhis form was bowed: But yet his minstrel-air was proud: Upon the mountain height he stood, And looked abroad o'er wave and wood Yet glowing with the blush of even, And answering to the hues of heaven, With such a melancholy grace, He seemed as thus he stood alone, Like some young prince upon his throneâ The genius of the lofty place! He wore high plumesâa glittering vestâ And to his half uncovered breast, An antique harp was strongly prest: And, ever and anon, its strings Gave musick to his wanderings: While he would pause to see unrolled, O'er heaven's blue arch, the crimson foldâ And purple plumes, and wings of fireâ And visionsâ'till his trembling lyre Would shake a distant, thrilling note, Like some sweet pipe in heaven afloat; And then as calmly die away As sunset hues in fading dayâ As rose-tints on the quiet stream Awakened by a passing beam: As flashing wings that flit in play Around the couch of infant day: As songs that Evening hears, when all Are listening to the quiet fall Of airy melodies, that come, From heaven, in one sweet murmuring hum. And he would pause, and o'er it bend, As if it were his only friend: And he would send it trembling roundâ With touchâso magical and freeâ So full of sweet simplicityâ And tendernessâand ecstacyâ It seemed, indeed, no earthly sound. And those who heard him as he leant Upon its lonely wires, and sent His agitated voice away, In feeling's broken roundelayâ Would wonderâweepâand hold their breath, As if they heard the hymn of death: And when the spell was brokenâgoneâ Its sad enchantment all withdrawnâ Would smile to see the trembling tear On other downcast lids appearâ Nor e'er suspect themselves had given A tribute to these sounds of heaven! And all who heard him then, believed That he had lovedâand been deceived: Or seen the stooping willow wave Its tresses o'er a loved one's grave: For such his melancholy song, That every listener's heart was weeping Like youthful lovers, when they're sleeping In sorrows that they would prolong. But those who heard the voice he sent When battle was his theme: Who saw his gorgeous vestment rentâ His quenchless eyeâthe lights that went Beneath his brow of gathered might, Like meteors that go forth at night, In one continual stream! And those who heard his ardent cry, And all his harp-strings pealing high: Who saw his stern, uplifted browâ His sweeping armâhis vestment flowâ The heaving of his youthful chest, Beneath his mailed and glittering vestâ Who marked the martial belt that bound His youthful form so closely roundâ His attitudeâso proud and highâ With look uplifted to the skyâ And outstretched arm, and waving hand, As if it shook a conquering brandâ And high plumed bonnetânodding low, Whene'er he trod, as if it gave To some young, supplicating foe, A rescue o'er an opening grave!â Yes! those who saw all this, would feel Enthusiasm o'er them steal So unexpectedly,âthey stood, Like men, who, 'mid a solitude, Have heard a sudden trumpet-peal! Their hearts would swell and they would riseâ And stand erect with flashing eyesâ And toss their arms unconsciouslyâ And join the shout of victory! And when the summons died away, Like battle at the close of day, Would feelâas they had been in fight, And wearied with their deeds of might: Would stand entrancedâor start, and seem As bursting from a stormy dream: Or gaze with troubled air around, And wonder whence that trumpet sound! And whither it had flown!âor hear The tumult yetâdistinct and clearâ Now pealing farânow ringing near, And rattling on the startled ear! As if a host had stooped from heaven Upon the winds that blow at night; And all their harps and trumps had given A farewell to departing light! And then, the glitter of each eye, That kindled at his minstrelsyâ That lightened, when the echoing blast Far o'er the hills in triumph past; That varied with the varying note Upon the eddying air afloatâ Would with that varying note decay And melt so peacefully away, That each who saw his neighbour's cheek The tumult of his soul bespeakâ And saw the maddening lustre die, There reddening like an angry skyâ And saw each upright youthful form Awake like genii of the storm, With lifted brow and threatening air, While pealed the battle anthem thereâ And saw it, as that anthem died, Lose all its stateliness and pride; With yielding port and fading eyeâ And heard his furious shouting die:â Would wonder that himself had been So undisturbed!âand so serene! And this would beâwhile yet he stood In that delicious solitude When youthful hearts feel all aloneâ Alone amid the world! When Phrensy leaves her radiant throne, And all her singing troops have flown: And all their wings are furled! And this would be while yet the fire Enkindled by that wondrous lyre, Was quivering on his downcast lash, Just like the dying tempest-flash! And those who felt their bosoms swell Beneath the working of his spell: Who felt that young enchanter's might, Whose incantations woke the fight, And taught to peasant-hearts the feeling That mounts to hear the trumpet pealing, Thenâdeemed the youthful minstrel there, Familiar with the strife had been: And that his sad, appealing airâ His darkened browâhis bosom bareâ His haughty port of calm despairâ Enthusiasmâgenius wereâ And never but in warriors seen! But those who knew him, knew full well That something terrible once fell Upon his heart, and froze the source, Whence comes enthusiasm's forceâ Something of icy touch that chills The heart drops of our youthful years: Something of withering strength that kills The flowers that Genius wets with tearsâ Fetters the fountain in its flow: Mildews the blossom in its blow: And breathes o'er fancy's budding wreath The clotting damps of early death: That spreads before the opening lightâ (The sunshine of the heart!) A cloud that tells of coming night, And chills the warblers in their flight, That twinkling gaily to the skies, With piping throats and diamond eyes, In unfledged strength depart. Somethingâbut what was never known: Something had pressed his pulses down: Blasted the verdure of his spring: Shorn the gay plumage of his wing: Silenced his harp, and stilled his lyre: Heaped snow upon his bosom's fireâ And caught away the wreath of flame, That hovered o'er his youthful name; Obscured his sunâand wrapped the throne Where glory in her jewels shone, For ever from his searching gaze: And, on his brain, in lightning traced The suffering of his youthful days: Where Madness had with clouds erased The characters, that Rapture placed Upon his heart and soul in blaze! 'Tis true that there were those who sawâ And whispered what they said in aweâ That nought beneath the skies but guilt Nought but the cry of blood that's spilt;â Could so unman a form so youngâ A heart so high and firmly strung: But suchâwhene'er they saw his eye Uplifted to the dark-blue sky In such a generous confidenceâ When night was forthâwould feel a tearâ And in their virtue would appearâ More fearful of Omnipotence! His faded plumes, and vestment torn, Were less like those by minstrels worn, Than like the garb of youthful knight: Caparisoned for glorious fight; Equipped beneath his lady's eye To couch his lance for chivalry:â To charge in tournament or strifeâ For wreath or scarfâfor death, or lifeâ And once, 'twas said, his full, black eye, When a young war-horse bounded byâ Awoke at once!âand lightnings keen, As on the falchion's point are seenâ When sudden dawn amid the fight, Flashed forth!âthen vanished from the sight, And darkened into tears! And dimly o'er his brow, there past A shade of memoryâ'twas the lastâ And first for many years. Yesâsomething once had touched his brainâ With fireâbut he would ne'er complainâ Had misery left him with the power To tell the suffering of that hour:â Butâas it was, the fearful cause Of all the scenes that madness drawsâ That curse of Genius!âall that awes!â That reft his heartâand bowed his pride, To him was knownâto none beside: And all he knew, was but a dream Of sleepless agony:âthe beam, That shone upon his maniac way, Was but the melancholy ray, That plays o'er churchyards, when the Night Reveals her phantoms to the sight: 'Twas but the lurid, wandering beam:â The troubled lightning of a stream; Or stricken armour's hasty gleam; 'Twas but the light that meteors shed; That faintly watches o'er the bed, Where Desolation guards the dead: The splendours of the storm, that show Temples and monuments laid low; And altars shattered by that God Whose thunders roll but onceâwhose nod But once in wrath, is ever givenâ When temples fallâand spires are strone; And Empire totters from her throne; And prostrate Idols bow to heaven! Such is the awful light that plays Around his steps! the meteor blaze That goes before Destruction's path! That follows the Destroyer's wrath, When o'er the blessed earth are seen, Their footsteps in the blasted green: And pyramids and statues thrown In ruin o'er the earthâo'ergrown With savage garlandsâliving wreaths Of creeping thingsâwhile poison breathes From every chapletâevery crownâ And every wonder that is downâ As if in mockery of their powerâ The dread immortals of an hour: As in derision of their strength, Thus prostrateârentâand strown at length. Such is that minstrel's memory yet; The very page he should forget, Of all the volume of his days, Is ever opened in its blaze! And all the rest is from his sight Enveloped in eternal night! The ruins of his hopes are seen, And ruins only!âall the restâ That in their days of light have been, Are darkly shrouded in his breast. His sufferings, and his home unknown; A madmanâand a minstrelâthrown Upon the barren mountain, goes Unharmed, amid his nature's foes: Protected by the peasant's prayer, He wanders through the dark woods, where Abides the she-wolf in her lair: Such prayers are hisâare his for ever! And ne'er will be refusedâO, never! For never yet, there shone the eye, Could let him pass unheeded by: And every heartâand every shed, Gave welcome to that maniac's tread: And peasant-babes would run to cheer His footsteps, as he wandered near: And every sunny infant eye, Grew sunnier as his step came nigh: And when he went at night alone, Where mighty oaks in fragments strown, Proclaimed the revels of the stormâ He went in safety:âo'er his form There hung a mute, but strong appeal, That those, who rend the clouds, might feel: Unharmed, upon the cliff he'd stand, And see the Thunderer stretch his wand, And hear his chariots roll: And clap his handsâand shout for joy!â Thus would that glorious minstrel-boy: When lightnings wrapped the pole! And he would toss his arms on high, In greeting as the arrows flew: And bare his bosom to the sky; And stand with an intrepid eye, And gaze upon the clouds that past, Uprolling o'er the mountain blast, And wonder at their depth of blue:â Thenâwildly toss his arms again, As if he saw the rolling main; And heard some ocean-chant anew: As ifâupon each passing cloud, He saw the Tempest harping loud Amid her fiery-bannered crew. The tempting precipice was hidden; The angels of the storm forbidden To strive upon his wasting frameâ The powers of air! enrobed in flameâ Whose thrones are everlasting hills, Whose army all creation fills: Who ride upon the roaring main; And listen to the battle strain; The thunders of the deep, and song Of trumpets bursting all along, When streamers flash, and banners blaze, And tall plumes bow, and lightning strays O'er Ocean's dull-blue billows; And far amid the clouds are seen, Young angels' hands, that twine the green Of laurels dripping gallant blood, With sea-weed from the stormy flood, And thunder-blasted willows. The sunset was his favourite hour: His eye would lightâhis form would tower: And kindle at departing day, As if its last, and loveliest ray Would win his very soul away; And there were those, who, when he stood, Sublime in airy solitude, Upon his mountain's topmost height, With arms outstretched, to meet the lightâ With form bowed down, as if it were In worship to the fiery air: Whoâhad he been from eastern climes, From sunnier hillsâin earlier timesâ When thus he bowed him to the skyâ Had charged him with idolatry: For when he bowed he bowed in truth: His adoration was the thought, And worship, that from heaven is caught When genius blossoms in its youth. 'Twas feeling all, and generous loveâ The reaching of the soul above:â The intellectual homage pure, That is sincere, and will endure: It was the offering of the heart, The soulâand pulseâand every part, That's noble in our frames, or given To throb for suns, or stars, or heaven: The spirit that is made of flame, For ever mounting whence it came: The pulse that counts the march of time, Impatient for the call sublime, When it may spring abroadâawayâ And beat the march of endless dayâ The heart, that by itself is nurst, And heaves, and swells, 'till it hath burst: That never yieldsâand ne'er complainsâ And diesâbut to conceal its pains, And the bright, flashing, glorious eye For ever open on the sky, As if in that stupendous swell It sought a spot, where he might dwell, And pant for immortality. That minstrel watched when others slept, But when the day-light cameâhe wept For tho' a maniac, he could see That sunshine sports with misery: He dwelt in caverns;âand aloneâ Held no communion, but with one: And that was but a peasant's child, A young enthusiast;âa wild And melancholy girl, whose heart Was subject to his wondrous artâ She was a sad and lonely one, And she too loved the evening sun: The twilight mantle when its blue Is dropped with light, and wet with dew: When watery melodies find birth, And heaven itself seems nearer earth: She never led the mountain race; She never joined the insect chase; Or left her solitary place, To join the dance, or trill the song: Or o'er the cliffs, to bound along; But all aloneâin silence, where The rocky cliff stood cloudlessâbareâ With folded arms, and loosened hairâ And robe abroad upon the airâ And turbaned wreath and streaming feather, Would stand for hours and hours together! And listen to the song that came Tumultuous from a neighbouring height, And watch that minstrel-boy in flame, While harping to the god of light. That wild one had a feeling heart! And when the minstrel would depart, To wander o'er the hills, and stray Upon the beetling cliffâhis way, By morn and noon, in sun and shade, Was lighted by that dark eyed maid: And when he trod a dangerous height, Her shout would lead the wanderer right: And he would then submissive turn, And smile as if he felt her care: And when they met, his cheek would burn, As if he knew what led her there. No other voice could stay his course: Her's was the only earthly force To which he yielded, when he went In worship towards the firmament. She saw beneath that cloudy air The heart of flame imprisoned there: For every glance that left his eye, When pealed his bursting minstrelsy; And every shout he sent away, When woke his stormy battle-lay; And every sweeping of his hand, Showed one accustomed to command: And thenâthe sounds he always chose, In tempest or in tears, were those That only generous hearts can feel And only generous hearts conceive: For they were still the challenge-pealâ The charge that makes the young heart reel, Or lordly spirits stoop, and grieve. These were his everlasting themes: And these the echo of his dreams: The neigh of steeds, the bugle cry Of battle or of victory, The roar of windâand rush of water: The blaze of heavenâcry of slaughterâ The thunders of the rolling deep Whose monarchs rousing from their sleep, Outstretch their sceptres o'er the wave And call their spirits from the grave:â When every billow starts to life, Contending in the foamy strifeâ For diadem of dripping green, Entwined by Ocean's stormy queen. These were for aye, his chosen themes; But he would sing full oft, it seems, With tendered touch, and tenderer note Such airs as o'er the waters floatâ When symphonies of evening rise In whisper to the listening skiesâ And swell and die so soft awayâ We think some minstrel of the day Is piping on its airy way: Or some sweet songstress of the night Waves musick from her wings in flight: A lullingâfaintâuncertain songâ That but to spirits can belong: To happy spirits tooâand none, But those, who in the setting sun, Expand their thin bright wings, and darting, Spin musick to their god in parting: Who has not heard these quiet airs Come like the sigh of heaven, that bears A soothing to his toiling cares? As if some murmuring angel guest, Within his void and echoing breast, Were fanning all his thoughts to rest? Who has not felt when sounds like these, Like prayers of lovers on the breezeâ Came warm and fragrant by her cheek, Oh, more than mortal e'er may speak! As if unto her heart she'd caught Some instrument, that to her thought Gave answering melody and song, In murmurings like an airy tongue: And echoing in its insect din, To every pulse and hope within, Had set her thoughts to fairy numbers! Or if she ne'er has fancied this, This doubtful and bewildering blissâ Has she not dropped the lingering tear, And fancied that some one was nearâ Invisible indeed, but dearâ The guardian of her evening slumbers! Such were the sounds that ye would hear When that strange boy would call the tear: A deep and low complaining toneâ Like lover's vows, when all alone, Upon some budding green he kneels, And listens to the sound that steals From some fresh woodbine-lattice near, When all that to his soul is dear, Is at her grateful vesper hymnâ When bright eyes in their prayers grow dim: Sounds faintly utteredâhalf suppressedâ Like fountains whispering to the blest:â Or the subduing smothered tones That sob upon the air like groans, Of those who broken-hearted bend Before some youthfulâgallant friend: Of those who kneel, and hold their breath, By loved ones touched with sudden death: Or sounds like chanting from a tomb, When spirits sit amid the gloom And melancholy garlands weave; And twine the drooping lily wreathâ And withered wild-flowers from the heath, To crown the maiden brow, that lies Unkissed by Nature's mysteries: To sprinkle o'er a virgin's bed The blossoms that untimely shedâ Have buddedâflourished to deceive. That girl with rich dark hair, was wild As Nature's youngest, freest child: As artlessâgenerousâand sincereâ As blushes when they first appearâ Or Rapture's unexpected tear: Hers was the sudden crimson flush, And hers the rich spontaneous gush Of hearts, when first in youth they're prest, And can't conceal that they are blest: Her downcast eye, and pale smooth brow: The heaving of her breast of snow: The murmuring of her voiceâand tread That faultered in its youthful dread:â Would ever to the eye reveal, What all but mountain nymphs conceal: And she, before that boy, would stand With lifted brow and outstretched handâ As if she felt a holy awe;â And all her heart was in her eyes, And all her soul would seem to riseâ While thus she stood for hours, and gazed Upon that minstrel boyâamazed At all she heardâand all she saw. She knew the dreadful reason why He dwelt upon the sunset sky; For once as they together stood Above the torrent and the wood; In breathlessâsunny solitudeâ To see the ruddy clouds of even Go blushing o'er the vault of heaven: The richestâwarmestâloveliest scene That had for many an autumn been:â There came a sullen labouring sound, As if an earthquake rose around: The minstrel uttered one low cry Of suddenâthrilling agonyâ And clasped his hands with look of fireâ And threw away his antique lyreâ And caught the maiden to his heart, And bore her down the hill! Oh, who may now the strength impart To check that madman's will! Where is the arrow or the bow:â The Thunderer's boltâto lay him low, Sent forth by heaven in wrath! The lightning shaft, that fiercely thrown, Hath brought the mountain spoiler down, In ruins o'er his path! Have mercy heaven!âhis desperate course, Is like the stormy torrent's force, When forth from some high, cloudy steep, In foaming light 'tis seen to leap:â Now bursting on the eye! Now flashing darkly on its way And flinging now, its fiery sprayâ In rainbows to the sky! Thusâthus the ravisher went forth; Like meteors o'er the cloudy north: Thusâthus the desperate boy went down, In splendour o'er the mountain's brown: His vestment streaming far behind, And glittering in the rushing wind: His dancing plumage tipped with light, Like eaglets in their loftiest flightâ As now he darted on the sight, And met the sun's last rays:â Now hidden in the forest shadeâ Emerging nowâand now betrayed By plumes that in the sunset played; And robe that seemed to blaze! But once she caught his eye of flame; But then!âO, how distracting came Her self-reproach, for all that led Her heart to watch a madman's tread! Stillâstill he bounds from cliff to cliffâ Like some light vaulting, airy skiffâ Upon the stormy billows tost, When all but hope and faith are lost: Stillâstill he plunges on his course; Still straining on with maniac forceâ From rock to rock, as if he were Some spirit sporting on the air: Unconscious of the dying maid, That on his naked breast is laidâ Her hair flows looseâher dark eyes close, Fled is the faintly breathing rose, That lately tinged her cheek: Sudden her dread descent is staidâ One bound!âhis lifeless charge is laid Upon a bank, and he is near, Half kneeling in his maniac fear: And now she moves!âher head she raisesâ She starts, and round in terror gazesâ With wild half-uttered shriekâ For lo! before her bows a form, Like some young genius of the stormâ And while she gazes on his eye, Uplifted in idolatry, She hears a stranger speak! Gone is the madman's savage airâ His pale denouncing look is goneâ His port of sullen, calm despairâ And gone, indeed, the madman's tone! His cheek burns freshâhis eye is bright, And all his soul breaks forth in light! His steps is buoyant, and his hair Is lightly lifted by the air; And o'er his reddening cheek, and eye, Upraised in feverish ecstacy, Is blown so carelessly, he seems Some youthful spirit sent from high, Clad in the glories of the skyâ With locks of living shade, that flow About a brow of driven snow; Or like the forms that pass at night, Arrayed in blushing robes of light, In Fancy's sunniest dreams. And but that still his well-known tears, And faded vestment quelled her fears, She had believed the form that knelt, Whose maniac pressure yet she felt, Was not the minstrel boy that went In worship to the firmament: She wonderedâweptâand breathed one prayerâ, Then felt in more than safety there: âEllen!â he faintly said, and smiled, As prostrate at her feet he kneltâ âEllen!ââagain his eye looked wildâ Again he roseâas if he felt, And would assuage, some sudden pain, That darted through his rocking brain: He pausedâand o'er his throbbing browâ His hand went doubtfully, and slowâ Indignant brushed a falling tear, And saw that dark-eyed girl appear In awful loveliness, and youth, Enthusiasmâtearsâand truthâ And then was bent that maniac's pride, His arms dropped lifeless at his sideâ In Nature's own supremacyâ And Youth's tumultuous feelingâ Already in his ecstacy, The maniac boy was kneeling: When once againâa lightning painâ Went flashing through his clouded brain, Where Reason was revealing: It went, and then a deeper night Succeeded to its blazing flight, The maniac sprung erect from earth, And tossed his arms abroad in air: Like some young spirit, at its birthâ Some nursling of the fiend Despair: Uttered one thrilling, dreadful cry, And darted towards the darkening sky One fierce reproachful look; Gathered his mantle round his form, And then, like those who rend the storm, His upward course he took. The strife was o'er!âhe was again The minstrel-boy, with maniac brain: The strife was o'er!âthe madman's air Returned for everâand Despair Hath hung her cloud for ever there! Again he climbs the mountain's height: Again he hails departing light: Again his soul is forth in strength: Again his vestment flows at length; Again the mountain-echoes ring: Again his harp is wandering: Again his chords are wildly strungâ And these the measures that he sung! THE MINSTREL'S SONG. Ye who would hear a mournful song, Such as the desert bird may sing, When sailing on her languid wing, By sunny cliffs and lifeless woodsâ And silent blooming solitudesâ And watery worldsâand cloudless hillsâ Unmurmuring founts and sleeping rillsâ She hears on high the distant note, Of some sweet airy tune afloatâ That to the birds of heaven belong! Ye who have heard in the still of the night, When the soul was abroad in her uppermost flight, The whispering of trumpets and harps in the air; Who have heard, when the rest of the world were asleep, As ye sat all alone o'er the measureless deep, The spirits of earth and of heaven at prayer! When the stars of the air, and the stars of the water, Were peaceful and bright as the innocent beam That plays o'er the lid in its happiest dream: When the song of the wind as it feebly arose, With the gush of the fountain whose melody flows, For hearts that awake when the world are at rest, Came over your soul like the airs of the blest: When ye thought ye could hear from the height of the sky The musick of peace going tenderly byâ The girl ye had loved!âand the song ye had taught her! Ye who would love such airy songs, As listening solitude prolongs, When from the height of yon blue dome, The moon-light trembles to the earth! And angel melodies find birth; And musick sighs in her echoless home! Come ye and listen! I will sing What led my senses wandering. Or, would he hear the rending song Bursting tumultuously along? The challengeâchargeâand pealing cryâ And shock of armiesâwhen on high Broad crimson banners flaunt the skyâ And sabres flashâand helmets ringâ And warâsteeds neighâand bugles singâ When comes the shout, they fly!âthey fly! And echoing o'er the dark blue sky The cannon's thunder rolls! When all the heaven is rolling shadeâ And lightnings stream from every blade Revealing airy shapes, arrayed In strife, with warrior-souls! Thusâthus he 'woke his harp again; A strange enthusiastick strain; And kneeling on the naked ground, Filled all the mountain echoes round: Then swept the chords, as if to raise The spirit of departed days! That harper had an audience thereâ In heaven, and earth, and in the air! Then, bending o'er the chords, he smote A throngingâboldâexulting noteâ And stood erect!âthen flashed the wires! Then came the stormy clash of lyres! And had ye heard the rolling song, So fullâtriumphantâand so strongâ Ye never had believed that one Thro' such a boundless theme could run. It was the noise of countless wings! Of countless harps!âwith countless strings; Of distant fifesâand echoing drumsâ Of soldier-hymning when it comes Upon the shifting breeze of night, In farewells to the dying light, When steeds are forth, and banners blaze, Unfolding in the sun's last raysâ And squadrons o'er the plain are dashingâ And martial helms are nodding free In youth's bold-hearted revelryâ And woman goes before the sight, In airy pageantry and light, With shawl and high-plumed bonnet flashir And then he filled the sunset sky With lightly springing melody, Then shook the wires! and all along There went the huntsman's bugle-song: And up, aloft its silvery cry Ran clear and far, and cheerily! And then the pipe! while o'er the skyâ Where laughing babes were heard to fly, Sweet bells ran gingling merrily! His song is heardâa full dark eye, And cheek of health's own mountain dye, Are brightening to his minstrelsy; A heart is swelling, and the sigh That lingers as it passes by, Proclaims entrancing ecstacy! And these are now the words he singsâ That leap so proudly from his strings: THE MINSTREL. Oh waken, my Harp! to the marching of song! Oh scatter the clouds that are brooding around thee; Look forth in thy might, while the tempest is strong, Nor reel in thy strength, as thou movest along, Sublime on the winds, where my young spirit found thee! O, loosen thy numbers in pride, Let them triumph along on the tide, That bears the last links of the fetters that bound thee! Away with the pall that envelops thy form! Abroad o'er the hills let thy genius storm: O burst the bright garlands that shrine thee: O scatter thy jessamine blossoms in air! And the Tempest herself shall twine thee, Of the long wild grass, and the mountain's rank hairâ A wreath that is worthy the brow of Despair! Such chaplets at night, in the wind, I have seen, On the rock-rooted fir, and the blasted green, That tell where the anger of heaven hath been: When a thick blue light on their barrenness hung; When the thunders pealed, and the cliff-tops rung, And the bending oak in the cold rain swung. The Harper pausedâthe clouds went past In pomp upon the rising blast: The Harper's eye to heaven is raised, And all the lustres that had blazed, In triumph o'er his pallid brow, Have with the sunset faded now: And now his eye returns to earth, And solemn melodies have birth; And ah, a distant mournful sound, Goes wandering thro' the caverns round: Such symphonies are sometimes heard From some sweet melancholy bird, That sings her twilight song alone, As if her heart sent forth a tone:â In summer dreaming, ye may hear Such singing gently pass the ear, And hold your breath 'till it hath goneâ Then wonder, as the song is done, That ye can be so soon alone:â Or start to find the glittering tear Upon the mossy turf appear:â Or in your visions, when ye see Some angel-harp, in ecstacy, Awakened by an angel wing, When every plume of glittering light, Unfolding to the dazzled sight, Goes faintly o'er some quiet string! Wild sounds but sweet! the silky tune Of fairies playing to the moon; The sprightly flourish of the horn, That underneath the blooming thorn, Pipes sharply to the freshening morn; The threaded melodies that sing From blossomed harps of cobweb string: The busy chirping minstrelsy, Of Evening's myriads in their glee; When every bright musician sings With voice, and instrument and wings: When all at once the concert breaksâ A multitude of tingling shakes!â When glittering, miniature guitars, And harps, embossed with diamond stars, Equipped with fiery wings, take flight In musick past the ear of Night: When all around, Ye hear the sound Of windy bugles, plucked while blowing, Strown loose upon the stream, and going, In sweet farewells, Like living shells, Or fountains singing while they're flowing. Of golden strawsâand slippery shells; Of sounding pebblesâcoral shellsâ And flow'ret trumps with dewy rims, Where one perpetual murmur swims; As if some swiftly passing sound, Were caught within its airy round;â And droppings like the tinkling rain Upon the crisped leafâand strain Of dainty wheat-stalks, split and singing; And insect-armour sharply ringing; And chirp of fairy birds in flight,â One endless tune, like some young spright, That's twittering on from morn 'till night. With living drums, and many a fife,â Of martial littleness and life, And fine thin whistling tunes from grass, Turning its edge to winds that pass; And all the sweet fantastick sounds, That linger on enchanted grounds: When elfins, prisoned in a flower, Are listening to the twilight shower, And mock its sounds, and shout, and play Full many a fairy-minstrel layâ To pass their dreary time away. Now heaves the lyre as if oppressedâ And panting now, subsides to rest, Like rapture on a maiden's breast; Or like the struggling sounds that rove, When boyhood tells its earliest love: Or like those strange unearthly lyres, Whose hearts are strung with unseen wires, That wake but to the winds of heavenâ The breezes of the morn and even; That mounting to the rosy skies, Like sky-larks on their freshest wing, For ever mount, for ever sing, Louder, and louder as they rise. Now rudely comes the song again, A thronging and impatient strain. THE MINSTREL. Heave darkly now my harpâfriends of my lonely hour! Cold swell thy numbers! Away with the trumpet songâthe wintry requiem pour, The hymning for the deadâthe rush of churchyard showerâ For she who loved thee! She who moved thee! She who proved thee! In darkness slumbers! O, who has not felt, in the dead of the night, The breathing of some one near to him? The waving of some soft angel plumeâ A vision of peace in an hour of gloomâ While a nameless wish on his heart sat light, And the net-work over its pulse grew tight, As he thought of her who was dear to him! And who has not wished that the day might never Intrude on such innocent sleep? And prayed that the vision might stay for ever, And who has not wakened to weep! And who has not murmuredâin agony tooâ When the tenant of heaven away from him flewâ And he felt 'twas a vision indeed! Suchâsuch are the phantoms, my days pursue, And will 'till my spirit is freed. I awake from a trance on the cliff's stormy height, While such visions are fading away from my sightâ And feelâwhile my senses are going astrayâ Like one that can watch his own heart in decayâ Like a dreamer that's wandered uncovered in day! And find, as I start from the spell that enthralled me, That the voices and wings of the spirits that called me, Are pageants that flit thro' the fire of the brain:â Commissioned to waken my heart from its sleepâ To stir my young bloodâ'till the maniac weepâ But commissionedâby Mercyâin vain!â Nayâsilence my harp!âthe enchantment is nearâ Her pinions are waving!âmy Ellen, appear! He pausedâand then imploringly, There went in lustre from his eye A mute petition to the sky: He turned and saw the dark-eyed maid; And saw her drop a trembling tearâ Then on her breast his hand he laid, As listening if its pulse betrayed One added throb of doubt or fear. Thenâgazing on her downcast eye, He shook his head reproachfullyâ Put back her flowing raven hair, And wiped the tear-drop glittering there, And shook his own imperial brow, And thanked her with his eyeâ Then dropt her yielding handâand now His harp is pealing high! And now a murmuring comes again, A mournfulâfaintâand languid strain. MINSTREL. Nayânay sweet girlâthou shalt not weep! I'll wake my Ellen's summer sleep: This is the strain she bid me sing, When I would hear her angel wing. A lowâsweet symphony then fell From each calm wire, as if a spell In musick might be spoken! 'Twas like the breath of evening's shell When faintly comes its faintest swellâ Or fairy note from flow'ret bell, When some young insect's golden cell By careless touch is broken! And then was heard like singing air This adjuration trembling there. ADJURATION. O come, on the beam of the night, love! O come, on the beam of the night! While the stars are all busy and bright, love: O come, with thy tresses of light! Away thro' the air we will go, love, Where the waters of melody flow, love: Where all the fresh lilies are blowing; Where the turf is all mossy and green love, love; Where the fountains of heaven are flowing, And the skies are all blue and serene love. O come, with thy plumage of light, love, And we will embrace in our flight, love. O come, to my desolate heart, love, And smile on the clouds that are there, And let us together depart, love, And sing on our way thro' the air. O come, let us hasten away, loveâ Where spirits may worship and pray, love. O come, on the beam of the night, love! O come, on the beam of the night! While the stars are all busy and bright, love, O come, with thy tresses of light! Then with a glance of fire he rose, And thisâa fiercer hymning rose: This harp hath lain long and forgotten in gloom; And the roses that wreathed it have lost all their bloom, Since it brightened and trembled at home: The swell of whose heaven, and smile of whose day, First tempted its song on the breezes to stray: The air of whose mountain first taught it to play, And the wind from the surge, as it tumbled in foam First challenged its numbers in storm to roam. For the night of the heart, and of sorrow is o'er it, And the passionate hymn that in other days tore it, With her, who so oft to the green bower bore it, Have gone like the moonlighted song of a dream! Like the soul of an eye that hath shed its last beam! And the tendrils of lustre that over it curled, With the dark eye that gave all its wanderings birth, All goneâlike a cherubim-wing that is furledâ And left me aloneâall alone in the worldâ With nothing to worship or sing to on earth! Yetâyet o'er the mountains my country appears: And to her I will waken my lyre: Perhaps it may brighten again, tho' in tears, And the being it sang to in long vanished years, May come in my visions of fire! Ah, though she has goneâthat young hope of my heart! Still she thinks of the nights when I played to her, When my sighs like the souls of the blest would depart, As I knelt by my harp and prayed to her. O, yesâtho' thou art gone, my love, Thou'lt know the layâfor none could move Thy pulse like him, who sings this songâ Its throbs delayâsubdueâprolongâ For they were so obedient still, They fluttered, fainted at his will; Thy heart and soul, and thought kept time, Like angels to some heavenly chime; Now lightning wantoned in thine eyes, As bright as ever cleft the skies; And now in rich dissolving dewâ They darkly swam like heaven's own blue; Now bent to earthânow flashing bright:â Now faintingâfading on the sightâ Like cherub eyes that weep in light; O, yes thou'lt know the lay again, And weep to hear my harp complain; Spirit! I know thou wilt, for ye Can never lose such memory:â Oh, I could sing my heart away, To such a spirit would it stay! In the pause of the storm, I could hear Her sweet-toned voice, so wild and clear! ThatâsuddenlyâI'd turn aroundâ Believing she was near!â And then!âI'd shed the bitter tearâ As if I'd come too late!âand foundâ Thatâdisappointedâshe had gone; As if she hadâthat moment flown And left meâleft me!âall aloneâ And then again I'd hear the tone Of her own luteâas 'twere to cheerâ The pilgrim on his journey here: Like the dew of heavenâa pearly lightâ That falls where the touch of the storm hath been, In the silent nightâ Refreshing the airâand stirring the breeze With the flourishing green Of branching trees: And oftenâwhen the sun went downâ In battleâbloodâand flameâ As, o'er against the sky I stood, Away, by yonder blueish wood, Whence, often, on the winds she came, I've heard herâgentlyâsing my nameâ And seen two shadowsâfaintly thrown, Upon the waterâfar below, And Iâgreat God!âwas all alone! And one of them had wingsâand stooping Amid her lovely hair, Whose vapoury flow, Was all aroundâseemed weeping, where The otherâseemed in madness, droopingâ That other!âwho was he?âhe strove In vainâin vain!âto touch her handâ As one thatâoverwhelmed with loveâ Within the awful presence of The creature of his heart doth stand! And oftenâoften have I heardâ Two voices mingling in the woodâ Chiding and weepingâand they seemedâ Like some of which I've often dreamedâ I know not whereâI know not whyâ I love but oneâand she is goneâ Yet still I often hear the toneâ Of childrenâin the airâand sky, As they were drowningâand a thirdâ Such as I've heard in solitudeâ Like some sweet-toned pronouncing bird, Would say my name aloud, As if some lovely infant there, Encradled in a golden cloudâ Where all was yellowish vapourâdimâ Were faintly calling me to him! Hark!âthere is musick in the hollow sky! Something mysterious parading byâ 'Tis the loud marchâthe echoing band of heaven Marshalled aloftâin revelation given To all, who when, sublimely, up the air Great midnight moves in dim magnificence; Are out upon the hills; and, kneeling there, In the dread feeling of Omnipotenceâ Breathe to the awful symphonies that go Around the vaulted sky, and penetrate Each gloomy spotâwhere secret waters flowâ And nature sits alone and desolate, Upon her Rocky throneâand see, away The dread machinery of air in playâ The tracking meteors, as they pour along All luminous with fiery hair, and sweep Athwart the grand, illuminated deepâ Like a descending firmamentâbut stay!â O, listen! listen!âthat awakening song! That awful burst! so windyâfar and strong With loud, ungovernable melodyâ And nowâ'tis goneâ'tis melted in the skyâ And all the world is silentâhow like deathâ All goneâfor ever!âlike some passing breath!â The Harper paused: his numbers died:â The mountain-nymph was by his side: Unconscious that the mighty spell, Which drew her to his lonely cell, Was strengthening as she heard this song, Go so complainingly along; For let him sing of what he might, Of heaven or sunshineâstorms or nightâ The battleâearthquakeâor the bed Of honourâraptureâor the deadâ Her swelling heartâher glistening lashâ The sudden breathâthe sudden flashâ Proclaimed how well the charm was wrought, How surely was her young heart caught. Again he smote his sounding lyre, Again his arm to heaven was raised; His robe was forth! and prouderâhigher He rang his trumpet notes of fire; Until his very spirit blazed! And from his eye of lustrous night, There wentâuninterrupted light! And thus he chanted to the rude Omnipotence of Solitude. Switzerland of Hills! Thou muse of Storms, Where the cloud-spirit reins the bursting forms Of airy steedsâwhose meteor-manes float far In lightning tresses o'er the midnight car That bears thine angels to their mountain war! Home of the earthquake! land where Tell Bared his great bosom to his God, and fell, Like his own Alpine-torrent, on his country's foe; Land of the unerring shaft and warrior-bow; The upward Eagleâand the bounding Doe:â The shaggy wolfâand the eternal flow Of cloud-nursed streams, and everlasting snow. Switzerland! my country! 'tis to thee, I rock my harp in agony:â My country! nurse of Liberty, Home of the gallant, great and free, My sullen harp I rock to thee. O, I have lost ye all! Parentsâand homeâand friends: Ye sleep beneath a mountain pall; A mountain-plumage o'er ye bends. The cliff-yew in funereal gloom, Is now the only mourning plume, That nods above a peoples' tomb. Of the echoes that swim o'er thy bright blue lake, And deep in its caverns, their merry bells shake; And repeat thy young huntsman's cry: That clatter and laugh, when the goatherds take Their browsing flocks at the morning's break, Far over the hillsânot one is awake In the swell of thy peaceable sky. They sit on that wave with a motionless wing; And their cymbals are mute and the desert birds sing Their unanswered notes to the wave and the skyâ One startling, and suddenâunchangeable cry, As they stoop their broad wing and go sluggishly by: For deep in that blue-bosomed water is laid, As innocent, true, and as lovely a maid As ever in cheerfulness carolled her song, In the blithe mountain air, as she bounded along: The heavens are all blue, and the billows bright verge Is frothily laved by a whispering surge, That heaves incessant, a tranquil dirge, To lull the pale forms that sleep below: Formsâthat rock as the waters flow. That bright lake is still as a liquid sky, And when o'er its bosom the swift clouds fly, They pass like thoughts o'er a clear blue eye! The fringe of thin foam that their sepulchre binds, Is as light as the cloud that is borne by the winds; While over its bosom the dim vapours hover, And flutterless skims the snowy-winged plover: Swiftly passing awayâlike a hunted wing; With a drooping plumeâthat may not fling One sound of lifeâor a rustling noteâ O'er that sleepless tombâwhere my loved ones float. Oh cool and fresh is that bright blue lake, While over its stillness no sounds awake: No sightsâbut those of the hill-top fountain That swims on the height of a cloud-wrapped mountainâ The basin of the rainbow-stream, The sunset gushâthe morning gleamâ The picture of the poet's dream. Land of proud hearts! where Freedom broods Amid her home of echoing woods, The mother of the mountain floodsâ Dark Goldau is thy vale; The spirits of Rigi shall wail On their cloud-bosomed deep, as they sail In mist where thy children are lyingâ As their thunders once paused in their headlong descent, And delayed their dischargeâwhile thy desert was rent With the cries of thy sons who were dying. No chariots of fire on the clouds careered: No warrior-arm, with its falchion reared:â No death-angle's trump o'er the ocean was blown; No mantle of wrath o'er the heaven was thrown; No armies of lightâwith their banners of flameâ On neighing steedsâthro' the sunset came, Or leaping from space appeared! No earthquakes reeledâno Thunderer stormed; No fetterless dead o'er the bright sky swarmed; No voices in heaven were heard! But the hour when the sun in his pride went down While his parting hung rich o'er the world: While abroad o'er the sky his flush mantle was blown, And his red-rushing streamers unfurled:â An everlasting hill was torn From its eternal baseâand borneâ In gold and crimson vapours drest To whereâa people are at rest! Slowly it came in its mountain wrath, And the forests vanished before its path: And the rude cliffs bowedâand the waters fledâ And the living were buried, while over their head They heard the full march of their foe as he spedâ And the valley of lifeâwas the tomb of the dead! The clouds were all bright: no lightnings flew: And over that valley no death-blast blew: No storm passed by on his cloudy wing: No twang was heard from the sky-archer's stringâ But the dark, dim hill in its strength came down, While the shedding of day on its summit was thrown A glory all light, like a wind-wreathed crownâ While the tame bird flew to the vulture's nest, And the vulture forbore in that hour to molestâ The mountain sepulchre of all I loved! The village sankâand the monarch trees Leaned back from the encountering breezeâ While this tremendous pageant moved! The mountain forsook his perpetual throneâ Came down from his rockâand his path is shownâ In barrenness and ruinâwhere The secret of his power lies bareâ His rocks in nakedness arise: His desolation mock the skies. Sweet valeâGoldau! farewellâ An Alpine monument may dwell Upon thy bosom, oh! my home! But when the last dread trump shall sound I'll tread again thy hallowed groundâ Sleep thee, my loved one, sleep thee! While yet I live, I'll weep theeâ Of thy blue dwelling dream, wherever I roam, And wish myself wrapped in its peaceful foam. Sweet valeâGoldauâfarewell! My cold harp, cease thy swellâ 'Till tuned where my loved ones dwell My home!âGoldau!âfarewell! ODE, DELIVERED BEFORE THE DELPHIANS. A LITERARY SOCIETY OF BALTIMORE. O THOU of Heaven! Apollo, thou, With fiery eye, and lofty brow; The radiant twin of Chastity! The blazing god of Poesy! To thee we bow! We thank thee that another year Hath rolled around, and left us here: We thank thee that the glorious birth Of him, thy minister on earth, Is still to us so dear. Young prince of air! whose glittering bow, By us, thy worshippers below! Is seen athwart our darkest heaven! In quenchless and eternal light! A blazing constellation given Amid the season of the night! Arise!âArise! Young archer of the skies, Our chosen deity! O bend thy bow of might, And 'mid the vaulted night, While we uprear Our hands to thee; Appear! appear! In thy dim majesty! O thou of heaven, Apollo thou, Shine out upon thy votaries now! Show out thy mysteries where Thou tread'st the lifeless air: On the motionless cloud, Be thy harpers arrayed; Where shadowy faces crowd, With forms of shade. Thy musick too! O, be it heard So faintly, that its sounds may seem The warblings of some hidden bird, That we have sought for in a dream. Unfurl thy thin transparent sail, That we have seen so often spread, And bosom to the silent gale, That wafts the spirits of the dead. That seems to all but Delphian eyes A vapour passing o'er the skies. While 'tis, to us, the floating veil, That, with its shadowy light, enshrouds Thy sister's cold, sweet face in clouds. To usâthe showy, bannered air, That streaming, flutters down the heaven, When o'er the clouds assembled there, With sounding wheels and flaming hair, Thy conquering steeds in light are driven! It is the pure transparency By angel-fingers spun, That wraps young love and infancy; That veils the glowing face Of nakedness and grace: 'Tis woven in the twilight beam, And coloured in the blushing stream, Beneath the setting sun. Such is a cloud to Delphian-eyes! The strangest wonder of the skies, At mornâat noonâat night; For ever changing as it flies, Unfolding still its rainbow dyes, For ever on the sight. O, then unfurl that sail again, And let us see o'er heaven's blue main, Thy boat go swift and silently, And hear the faint, uncertain chime, Of bards that were in older time, Who sit, and as they sail along Awake a wild, and mingling songâ That tells of immortality! Pronounce thine adjurations there! And summon from each cemetry, Thy earliest Delphians, 'till the air Is bright with harps! and loud with minstrelsy! O let them not profane this hour, And slumber in thy time of power! But let thy ministers proclaim, Through all the air, In musick and in flame, That thou art there! Let all that in the darkness dwell, In silence or in solitude, In cavern or in wood, Now hear thy harp's triumphant swell! And, lifted by thy fearful spell, From the fathomless deep, Come forth in their sleep! From the field of blood Where the soldier lies;â And the restless flood, Where the sailor dies. From the pathless wild, Where, o'er the pilgrim's bones, Or Nature's childâ And heaps of warrior Indians lieâ The old decaying trees, Like spirits on the breeze, In strangeâlowâinterrupted tones, Are swinging mournfully! From ocean's shore, Where the sea-maids pour A watery lamentation o'er The dripping locks of some sweet form, Just shipwrecked in the passing storm, And weep and blow their melancholy shells; And ring their sweet-toned coral bells, Like murmurings from a cloud! O let them all appear! The spectres of the mind, Of phrensy or of fear, Careering on the wind! O strike the note! and from his bier, Each tenant of the deep will rise, With motionless eyes; And each his coral sceptre rearâ And each before our face appear, Within his sea-grass shroud! Let all that in the darkness dwellâ Now see thy form, and hear the swell Of ancient harpers, loudly singing! And from thy vaulted dwelling place, Amid the solitudes of space, Far thunders roll their awful base, And harps and trumpets ringing! Now be our invocation done!â For lo!âApollo of the sun, Hangs out his starry lyre, With frame of gold and strings of fire, Upon our midnight firmament! And now his bow of quenchless light Is brightening on our sightâ And now 'tis slowly bent! All hail to this auspicious hour! These are the symbols of his power: In mercy they are sent. Apollo! god of poesy! Of eloquence and light, Of life, and pride, and ecstacy, Is manifest to night! O, let the air we breath be flame, And let our echoing hearts proclaim, In musick to the skyâ That he, the Delphian god! is near, That he, our chosen one! is here, 'Till he, the god of song! is heard In every Delphian-word; 'Till he, the god of light! is seen, Like sunshine where the clouds have been, Warmâlovelyâand serene, In every Delphian-eye! Arise!âarise! Proclaim ye to the skies! That he hath left his dwelling place, His chariot of revolving light; And turn'd his coursers in the raceâ When stretching o'er the bounds of space, To fill our halls and hearts to night! Then let us raise our hymning higher, Sound every trumpet, harp, and lyre, That he to man hath given; 'Till all that revel in the sky, Uplifting high, Their sullen midnight canopy, Hang lingering as they're hurried by, And poised upon their viewless wing, Repeat the anthem that we sing To him, the tenant of high heaven! And now, Apollo! now, Again we bow, To thee, In fervour and sincerity! Another year has travelled round, And still within this ring we're found, Like one that treads enchanted ground, For ever lingering in it! We feel as we approach its verge, Like one, that on a precipice, Recoiling from a dim abyss, Stand listening to the surge! He dare not stepâthere's danger when He puts his foot beyond the bound; 'Tis so with usâbeyond are men Too little like what here are found Within this circle there's a power That charms a year into a hour, An hour into a minute! Thisâlike the boundaries drawn on air, By angelâwings that eddy there, Is felt, but never seen; A strange, unearthly atmosphere, Is ever warm and breathing here, As if there's something heavenly near, Invisibly serene! The summer of the heart is found, For ever, in this viewless bound, While all beyond is cold; And here, for ever may be seen, The constant-branching evergreen; The verdure of the heart, that spreads, A living arbour o'er our heads; The laurels of the brain, that grow, In intellectual light, and throw Their streaming garlands round our hair, Self-woven in immortal air; And all the flowers of heaven, that blow, Beneath the fierce and feverish glow, Of him, our god! whose burning face, Within this consecrated place, The Delphians in their dreams behold! This viewless prison-house of ours, That holds our spirits captive here, Is not a temple wrought with flowers, That, stripped from Dissipation's bowers, Are hung in empty mockery, Where idleness and revelry, In festival appearâ 'Tis not a ring by pleasure traced: No foaming goblets round are placedâ No woven flowers, nor mingling vines, Of aught, that young Volupte twines, Nor white arms interlaced;â Nor snowy breastsânor sparkling eyes, Around our haunts obedient rise, To grace our midnight mysteries. Our viewless boundary is a chain That passes through each heart, Thatâlengthenedâsoon contracts again, Thatârentâis always rent in vain, The linksâare load-stones of the brain! And can't be kept apart! These unseen bands of strength that bind Our hearts and souls, are intertwined, By wit, and sympathy, and mindâ Unseen, 'tis true, as they were traced Upon the ocean-waste, But steady as the eternal chain, That fetters the rebellious main Whence is this knitting of our souls? Whence is the magick that controls Our wandering thought, and keeps us here? It is the band of brotherhoodâ By genius only understoodâ To genius only dear: The flash of wit and light of song, The stream of heart that pours along, Betraying in its course, Ten thousand precious things that grow Upon its bankâlike founts that flow, Abruptly from a hidden source, Whose shining wave and joyful sound, For ever turn us wondering round, Like traveller o'er some desert ground, Some wilderness or mountain, That smiles to hear the gushing bound Of some fresh springing fountain; And stands, with folded arms, to see, However thirsty he may be, Its young tide rippling cheerfully, And round about in murmurs stealing, Now running there, and hiding here, As 'twereâsome living thing in fear; And still ten thousand tints revealing, Like serpent in the grass concealing; While all the drowsy buds awake, Unfolding in their starry pride, And dip their bright green leaves and shake Their silvery blossoms o'er the tide. And with his eyes uplifted seesâ A new creation in the breezeâ The glittering willow wave its leaves, The emerald turf itself grow brighter; And garlands that dear Nature weaves, Upon the lifting windâdance lighter. So 'tis with usâa sudden stream Comes from the desert, with a gleam Of loveliness and mystery; And lo! unnumbered things concealed In every heartâare then revealed And shine in every eye: 'Tis this that facinates us here; That makes this social group so dear; That binds us to each other: 'Tis this that makes the lengthening year That's past in lightâto us appear A cloudless momentary dream; A lovelyâwandering beam, That chancedâin passing o'er a crowd Of strangersâgathered in a cloud, To show to eachâhis brother! A lovely beam! that fell astray, As if it were to show us this; That we had chosen a clouded way Upon a crumbling precipice; That men were made for men, and must Commingle in their light; That souls within their sheaths will rust, But brighten in the fight: That all the weapons of the mind In solitude consume away; The bow strings, and the shafts designed Alike for song, and strife and play, The lightning that immortals wield, The flashing blade and flaming shieldâ Allâallâwhen they have left the fieldâ Grow dim and waste away! O then be this our prayer! Still may that beam be playing there; Whene'er we go astray! Assembled as we are to-night, Be still our shields and weapons bright, 'Till gathered for the judgment dayâ Beneath a far more fearful cloud, We hear far trumpets bursting loud, And gaze on every passing shroud, To catch one melancholy ray. Be this our prayer. O may we meet, O many an hour as rich as this! 'Till every heart forgets to beat; And may such precious moments cheat Our spirits to forgetfulness; 'Till all the icy hearts abroad, On life's unhospitable road, Are all forgotten or forgiven; And may the path we tread to night, Be trodden 'till each Delphian light Be quenched or set in heaven. Our week of cheerless toil once past, This holy sabbath comes at last, This sabbath of the heart! This lovely hour!âO be it blest, In mental fellowship and rest, And be it ever set apart! For ever, while we stay on earth, For art and science, song and mirth, 'Till other Delphians burst from night, And all the world is filled with light! From our cluster of stars, it is true, One, holy and bright, is withdrawn, 'Twas the herald of evening and dew, And the star of a lustreless morn. For whole seasons that star was alone, Aloneâin its fathomless sphere, For whole seasons its splendours had shone, Unobscuredâfor no other was near: For the dark of its sky was too deep, Its ray was too mild and serene, It was hastening away to its sleep, And none would have known it had been! But others were wandering around, Like that, unobserved in the sky, Alone in the vaulted profound, Too dimâand too far for the eyeâ But lo! it once chanced, in the route Of two, that were bosomed in space, That they touched, as they wandered about, And each then abandoned its placeâ And one was the star that is gone, The other is here in its light; 'Tis our centre and prideâ'tis the one About whom we gather to-night. The conjunction was watched in the sky, And others soon came afar; A new Pleiades blazed on the eye, And chose for their centre this star! Yesâone of our group is withdrawn; One star of our worship is gone, But its place was supplied By another that came, In lustre and pride, O'er an orbit of flameâ And yet anotherâin the place Whence that has been translatedâ Goes brightening o'er the tract of spaceâ Sublimely elevatedâ Another from our heaven of pride Is blotted out for ever, O, never be his place supplied! Noânever! A dreary blank were better far, Than such a smoking foggy starâ To himâour chiefâone parting strain; O, may he long our chief remain! May he, to whom we kneel, Apollo! of the silver bow, His starry harp on him bestow! And all the mysteries of space, The wonders of his beaming face, To him, our chief, reveal! O, let us ne'er forget the night, When heâour chiefâburst into light; When, having reared a pillared dome, We rose to consecrate a home, Where ScienceâWitâand Song might dwell; And Wonder work his spell; And Genius stay his blazing march, And Musick hang her dripping shell. Where all the Muses might suspend Their ringing harpsâand Fancy bend With Intellect in prayer; Oh then, Amid the sons of men, Our chief appeared! His hand uprearedâ And lo! upon the air, We saw a temple building! where Strange musick we had heard! Then let our chief be loudly named; With trumpets be his might proclaimed; He reared this architectural swell! He fixed the key-stone of our arch! Then hail to our chief in the tumult of song, Let the hymn of his praises go pealing along! May the swell of his heart be for ever the same; May the light of his brain Undiminished remain, To brighten our path to the temple of Fame: O may he be crowned by the wreath of the mind! The wreath that Apollo in glory hath twined; The leaves all of light and the blossoms of flame! And may his harp, this night bequeathed, By him, our godâwith fire be wreathed, And may that bow of strength be bent, Through time with still encreasing force! May every sun's revolving course, Still find him here, To Delphians dear, Our chiefâour gloryâand our pride! And when the messenger is sentâ And he to heaven is called at last, Upon Apollo's tide, Or on the roaring blastâ O, may he as he hurries past, Pour bravely out One farewell shout, To us, his Delphians here below! And with his harp, and with his bow, Go thundering o'er the firmament! CONQUEST OF PERU. BOOK I. BOOK I.

O THOU, the Everlasting!âThou, O God! Whose habitation is the universeâ Whose throneâeternity:âJehovah! Thou, Whose dwelling is all space, pavilioned o'er With rolling worlds!âOmnipotent!âto theeâ The God of Battles, we uplift our prayer And supplication! We have seen thee ride Upon the storm, with trumpeting and smoke, And bloody clouds!âand all the heavens on fire With horsemen! chariots! armed multitudes! Banners! and shields and spears! And seen the vaulted sky roll all together Tumultuousâlike the ocean in a storm:â While all its glimmering vergeâaround our earthâ Stood thick with battlementsâand turretsâtowers And ensignsâcherubimâand seraphim:â The apparition of embattled godsâ Revealed in brief transparency:âarrayed Dazzling! and terrible!â âAnd heard the shout Of countless armies!âneigh of steeds!âand o'er The dark round firmamentâa giddy host, Of winged shadows, in the night, have seen Up-swarming from a cloud! While all about The mountains noddedâand the waters heaved Shouting and thunder rolled!âand all the skies Were loud with battle, and with victory! O Thou!âfrom whom the rebel angels fled, When thou didst rend thine everlasting veil, And show thy countenance in wrath! O thou! Before whose brow, unclothed in lightâput forth In awful revelationâthey that stood Erect in heavenâthey that walked sublime, E'en in thy presence, Lord!âAnd they that shone Most glorious 'mid the host of glorious ones:â With Lucifer! The Morning star!âthe Terrible!â The chief of old Immortalsâwith the sight Were suddenly consumed! Almighty! Thou, Whose face but shone upon the rebel host Of warring constellationsâand their crowns Were quenched for ever! And the mightiest fell! And lo! innumerable wings went up, And gathered round about the Eternal's throneâ And all the solitudes of air were filled With thunders and with voices! And the war Fled from thy presence! And thy wrath was o'er, And heaven again in peace! O Thou, the stay Of men and angelsâwhose uplifted arm Reached from the midnight firmament, and wrapped In cloudy, blue, tempestuous light, hath led Thine armies through the wilderness!âwhose throne Of whirlwind and of thunder, through the day Was visible in heaven! Jehovah! Thou! Captain of armies! Chief of countless wars! Who, through the march of centuries, hath led Thy chosen ones to battle!âThou, whose shield, Of vaulted darkness, hath been interposed Between the blazing sun, and battling hosts, When thy commissioned ones had done thy willâ Whose peaceful voice, along the troubled sky; Hath re-established all the loosened hillsâ Charmed the loud Ocean in his bed, and stayed The sweeping tempestâturned the warrior back, Recalled the chariotâreined the neighing steedâ And conquering wheelâand blood-drenched bannerâall! While raging in the warâ And once, for slaughter, held the rolling sun Immoveable in heavenâ'till the work Of awful retribution had been done. O Thou, the God of Battles!âhear our prayer! O bless our song!âin mercy fill our soul With visions of the war!âO, let the wind Be full of distant trumpetsârising hornsâ And sounding hoofs, advancing o'er the hills! O, let us, o'er the battlements of heaven, The cloudy Andesâand the western Alpsâ The habitation of the Indian-Godâ O, let us see young trooping warriors pass! The souls of gallant men that died in war;â Each, with his bow and quiver!âeach erect, And firmly planted on his cloud! with spear Couched for the coming white manâo'er his brow The vulture's plumageâor the ragged mane Of some young lion, that on earth he toreâ Orâarrow fixedâand bow-string fiercely drawn, With eye immoveableâand burning dark In deadliness and hateâhis shoulder bare, And sinewy limbâhis sandals freshly bound With bleeding tendons, from the panther torn, Whose spotted skin is floating heavily Upon the windâand dripping darkly yet! Let every cloud that moves along the heaven Bear tumult in its bosom!âwhen it stoops, Or rests upon the mountain topâor spreads Its angry wings aloftâor, opening wideâ Reveals the bursting Tempest on her throne, Amid her armoury of burnished shieldsâ And flaming spearsâher lightnings all about Shaking their fearful wingsâher thunderbolts Streaming with crimson flameâand armed shapes All harnessing their chariots and their steedsâ To the loud trumpeting of airâO let us see Armies with armies wrestlingâbanners spread! The flaming cross to blazing suns opposedâ The warriors of the church in scarlet robesâ And glittering mailâand helmets studded o'er With steel and goldâin warâwith naked men! Unarmedâdefencelessâand oppressed with aweâ Children of Spainâwith children of the Sun! Castilian warriors trained in fields of blood; Armed with thunderâlightningâand engaged With suppliant red menâborn and nursed in peace; O let us hear the old Castilian cry! God! and St. Jago!âthe tremendous cry, That, like an earthquake, shook the hills of Spain, And tumbled to the earth the Moorish prideâ Darkened their crescentârent the bloody veil Of all their templesâscattered to the winds Their streaming trophiesâtheir impietiesâ Their palaces and thrones!âO let us hear That war cry peal again! And let us hear The red-man's thrilling voice!âthe Mexican! And ringing battle axesâand the twang Of brazen bowsâand see the glittering flight Of winged arrows flaming through the sky. God of the Indian! Monarch of the skies! O bear thy red right arm!âO bend thy bow, Omnipotent!âand let thunders roll! O Thouâour InspirationâThou, O God! To whom the Prophets and the crowned Kingsâ The bards of many years! who caught from thee Their blazing of the spiritâThou, to whom The Jewish monarchs, on their ivory thrones Flaming with jewelryâhave fallen down, And rung their golden harps, age after ageâ O Thouâto whom the gifted men of old, That stood among the mysteries of heaven, Read the thick starsâand listened to the wind, Interpreted the thunderâtold the voice Of Ocean, tumbling in his cavesâexplained The everlasting characters of flame, That burn upon the firmamentâand saw The face of him that sitteth in the sunâ And read the writing there, that comes and goes, Revealing to their eyes the fate of menâ Of monarchs and of empiresâmen, that stood Amid the solitudes of heavenâand earthâand heard From the high mountain top, the silent night Give out her uninterpreted decreesâ The venerable men!âthe oldâand mighty! Prophets! and Bards! and Kings! whose souls were filled With immortality, and visionsâ'till Their hearts have ached with weary supplicationâ 'Till all the future rushing o'er their strings!â In tempest and in light!âhath drowned their prayers! And left their mighty harps all ringing loud With prophecy and woe! âO Thou! to whom Innumerable sunsâand moonsâand worlds, The glorious elevations of the sky, The choirs of cherubim and seraphimâ Immortal multitudes!âthat worship round Thine echoing throne!âupon their golden harps, And silver trumpsâand organs of the air, Pour everlasting melody!âO Thou, to whom All this hath been familiar from the hour, When thou didst bow the heavensâand, at the sound Of many thunders pealing thy decree, Creation sprang to lightâwhen time beganâ And all the boundless sky was full of sunsâ Rolling in symphonyâand man was madeâ Sublime and confidentâand woman, up From the sunshine of the Eternal, rose All intellect and love!âAnd all the hills, And all the vales were greenâand all the trees in flower. O bless our trembling harp! We sing of battle!âWe have tuned our heart In awe and veneration of the men Of other daysâthy youngest bornâto whom This western world was an inheritanceâ Who gazed on theeâtheir Father!âundisturbedâ Unshakenâunextinguishedâin the light Of mightiest revelationâMenâwho saw, The Everlastingâface to faceâand lived. The battle was not done. The sun had rolled All day along the lines of death. All day The skies had thundered to the sounding hills; And all the live-long day the blood of men Had flowed in sacrifice. The night had comeâ A night that brought no safety and no restâ Our god was angryâHe went home in bloodâ In horrible effulgenceâ âThe morning cameâ We were all out upon the neighbouring hills, In sacrifice and prayer. The weary nightâ The very heavens tooâhad rolled away In earthquake and in thunder, not a spotâ Within the empty, hollow firmamentâ Not even a cloudâwas leftâbut all was black With measureless infinity. We clung to earthâ To shrubs and rocksâlike men that stand Upon a dizzy precipiceâand blind And giddyâdownâin terrible dismayâ Thus were we clingingâallâa multitudeâ When, suddenly! the dreadful void above, Was all illuminated!âdownward rolled, From its extremest elevationâwith the sound Of chariots descendingâand the noise Of volleying whirlwindsâwhite and shining clouds! All luminous with gloryâtumbling roundâ In smoky crimsonâyellowish lightâand blueâ Eddying tumultuous!âthenâevolving slow All drenched in bloodâand shaking out thick lightâ In awful draperyâlike a battle-sheet, Spread like a curtain o'er the skyâthey wentâ Lifting and breaking in the windâ âAnd then away, awayâ O'er the great waterâfrom the land of soulsâ A mighty bird went up, as if pursuedâ Toiling and labouring o'er the solid skyâ Touching along the vault, as if she sought Some outlet for escape!â âAnd while we looked aboveâ The heavens all motionlessâa brazen domeâ Suddenâat once!âwe saw the distant hills Bend with the weight of a descending God! Convulsiveâyieldingâheaving to and fro:â And then we saw a forest of great trees Uprooted from the earthâand stripped, And hurled aloftâin silence!âand we saw A mighty river rolling backwardâwhiteâ And fieryâto its sourceâand not a sound Of terror shook the air!âand not a cloud Of thunder was abroad. But all was still and brightâ âAnd weâin horrorâsaw The Invisible at work! Then blew a trumpet! and our Inca came, Amid the priesthoodâwith his hair unboundâ And naked feetâand stood above the waveâ The consecrated waveâthe holy lakeâ Whose glossyâand mysterious surface showsâ Like a bright mirrorâin the blessed sunâ The visions of the future. All were stillâ And breathless in their aweâand all stood roundâ Upon the rocky margin, and looked down Awayâbelowâupon the silent waveâ 'Twas motionless and dimâ And we grew dizzy with the sightâat lastâ Faint shadows passed athwart itâthen aroseâ From the extremest edgeâwith bannersâsmokeâ And arrowy lightningârolling cloudsâand fireâ A band of martial spiritsâstrangersâfew, In numberâfewâbut terrible!âtheir step Was slowâbut strongâand like a band of brothers They approached! Thenâon the other side There came a throngâa hostâa multitudeâ Clad in white robesâwith feathers in their hairâ And bow and quivers!âAnd we trembled, thenâ We knew they were Peruvians!âthey went With musick and with dance to meet their foeâ Sun of the skies! how breathlessly we stood! We saw them join in battleâand we pealed Our own Peruvian cry to urge them on!â Already were their arrows in the airâ Already had they touched!âand rangâfor lo! They bounded shivering from the strangers' hearts, As they were indistructable! We groanedâ Together, all at onceâBut soonâagainâ We numbered the increasing of the host Arrayed in whiteâand saw the ocean-bandâ Almost enclosedâand thenâaloftâwe pealed Another battle cry!â Swift at the sound, we saw The war revived!âbut thenâoh, wonderful!â We saw a creatureâfashioned like a manâ His head on fireâthe lightning in his handâ Upon a glorious somethingâbound among The snowy hostâand then, as from the skyâ There rolled a sudden cloudâupon them allâ Streaming with fire!âthe lake was covered o'erâ With eddying smokeâThe wondrous vision fledâ And thenâwhile we were growing breathlessâthere In agonyâto see the white smoke clear awayâ We heard the roll of distant thunderâthenâ We turned us to the oceanâto the hillsâ But not a cloud was thereâthe blessed sky Was all serene; and now the passing mist Had left the bosom of the lake belowâ O what a sight!âthe snowy band was goneâ All gone!âand with the conquering step of prideâ That creature in the van!âthe strangers wentâ Their colours outâand all their warrior dress, Gleaming discoloured fire:âthey passed awayâ We saw itâwe!âthey passed awayâaway! O'er the black waterâto the very side, That leads to Peruâand her palacesâ Her Incas!âand the Temple of the Sun!â And thenâO then, our own great God appeared! And, at the glorious sight, the priesthood blew Ten thousand silver trumpetsâand we fell Upon our faces to the earthâand worshipped. He came!âin triumph came! A host of flaming billows from the sea, Rose up and shook their helmets in his beam: Then rolling up he wentâand far and near, In oily gold and greenâand trembling fire, Wavy and richâand streaming o'er with white And glittering foamâand sunshineâredâ And changeable with glossâthe silky Ocean heaved! O! 'twas a glorious sight!âthe heavens on fireâ The sky one rainbowâand the lovely wave Reflecting all its hues, in softened lightâ Old Ocean dancing in the troubled goldâ And up the firmament of kindling blue The rolling Sun ascending like a god:â Then came the wonder!âo'er the lighted sky Mysterious musick wentâand on the top Of our chief temple, something seemed to moveâ And a quick glimmering was all around itâ As if ten thousand steely blades, and spears Were brandishedâshaken in a midnight beam, Or flourished o'er the wave! Again the thunder pealed! Up, like a creature newly strung with life, Our Inca sprang from earth. The wonder came! Away upon the dim horizonâwhere the air Shone with a faint effulgenceâwhere the blue Was purest, brightestâthere appearedâO God! The Spirit of the Ocean!âall his wings were out! His long bright hair streamed thick upon the wind! In thunder he arose! Clouds burnt around him, And o'er the wave, and through the rolling smoke, Rushing in light, he came!âand as we fled, Thundered again through all our echoing hills!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PERRY's VICTORY. COLUMBIA appear! To thy mountains ascend, And pour thy bold hymn to the winds and the woods, Columbia appear!âO'er thy tempest-harp bend, And far, to the nations, its trumpet song send: Let thy cliff echoes wake, with their sun-nourished broods, And chant to the desert, the skies, and the floods; And bid them remember The tenth of September, When our eagle came down from her home in the sky, And the souls of our ancients were marshalled on high. Columbia appear!âlet thy warriors behold, Their flagâlike a firmament bend o'er thy headâ The wideârainbow-flagâwith its star-clustered fold! Let the knell of dark Battle, beneath it, be tolled; While the anthem of peace shall be pealed for the dead, And the rude waters heave, on whose bosom they bled: O they will remember The tenth of September, When their souls were let loose in a tempest of flame, And wide Erie shook at the trumpet of Fame! Columbia appear!âLet thy cloud-minstrels wake, As they march on the stormâall the grandeur of song, 'Till the far mountains nod, and the motionless lake Shall be mantled in frothâand its monarch shall quake On his green, oozy throne, as their harping comes strong, With the chime of the winds that are bursting along; For he will remember The tenth of September, When he saw his dominions all covered with foam; And heard the loud war in his echoless home. Columbia appear!âBe thine olive displayed! O cheer, with thy smile, all the land and the tide! Be the anthem we hear, not the song that was made, When the victims of slaughter stood forth, all arrayed In blood-dripping garmentsâand shoutedâand died: But, let us remember The tenth of September, When the dark waves of Erie were brightened to day; And the flames of the battle were quenched in their spray. HYMN, (Sung at the late ordination of Mr. Pierpont, in Boston. I can offer no other apology for having ventured upon this species of compositionâthan the true one. It is thisâindignation at the miserable, trashyânot to say blasphemous, versifications of scripture abroad, purporting to be Sacred Songsâand Divine Hymnsâalike destitute of magnificence and sublimityâof the royal magnificence of Solomonâand the great simplicity of Isaiahâhaving nothing of the monarch, less of the prophet âand still less of the bard to recommend them, in their English dress. The attempt was a bold oneâand I feel that I have failedâfor I am not satisfied with what I have done:â yet as I could notâif I wouldâproduce any thing worse than I have seen, and as I might produce something better, I have made the attempt. May it lead othersâ with a better knack at versifyingâto a proper veneration for the noble simplicityâand richnessâthe unadulterated and vast sublimity of scripture.) O, THOUâthe Everlasting!âThou, The only God!âJehovah!âwe, With all thy throned archangels, bow In hymning and in prayer to thee! Around thy cloud-encompassed throne, Where unseen harps for ever ring; Where everlasting trumps are blown; And Kingsâand Bardsâand Prophets singâ We kneelâO, God!âwith them that were Thy chosen ones on earth:âwe bow, With crowned multitudes, in prayer, And ask thy blessingâFather, now. On this, thy flock, assembled here, And him that thou hast called to thee, Commissioned, Father!âto appear, In thy consuming ministry: O, Thou!âto whom thy people came, In ancient timeâwith songs and prayers: Whose servant saw thee, wrapped in flameâ O be our God, as thou art theirs! TO ?. 'TIS trueâI have not known thee long; Yet I have worshippedâblamedâand loved thee; For thou'rt so like a thing of song, That I have dreamt ofâardentâyoungâ Changing with every thing that moved thee: That I have dwelt upon thine eye, So happyâclearâand mildâand blue, 'Till I have seen the loveliest sky! Come down in a dissolving dye, And drop with heavenâand lightâand dew! At night I've prayed 'till I have wept, To think what sorrows might beset thee; While visions to my bosom crept, 'Till I forgot to breatheâand sleptâ Butâeven in sleepâcould not forget thee: Again would come thy soft blue eye, Melting again in light and love; Again thy lip would change its dye, My soul would leave my lipâand I, Would wander in my dreams above: Then heartâto heartâI'd meet thee, where, A pure, transparent heaven was swellingâ I'd feel the floating of thy hair Upon my breastâand kneel in prayer With theeâwith thee!âin thy blue dwelling. But thenâoh! we should never wake, When dreams like these sing to our heartâ Nor ever, by one murmur, break The charm that binds their wingâthey take Such longâlong farewells when they part; Bright one, adieu!âno hour is near, When I may pour my thoughts to theeâ Thou'lt be my soul enchantment dear, Yet will thou never know it hereâ But some fresh dayâsome summer year, In yon blue heaven, we'll both appearâ Just like my dreamsâas pureâas free. The following lines were hastilyâvery hastily written, on seeing the celebrated Mr. Wood touch off a likenessâas usualâin the twinkling of an eye. To the Genius of Painting. YOUNG wanton of our sunniest dreaming! Dear child of heaven! With lighted eyeâand loose-hair streaming, Like meteors o'er the brow of even! Who comestâstrangely fair, And sittest on the air, With pencil dripping light!âand eye Intent on nature's imagery, To catch her fleetest, loveliest beaming. O stay thy fairy mimickryâ Suspend thy life-enkindling powerâ One momentâwanton!âwhile I try To show thee to the world, as I Have seen thee in my lonely hour: O, grant my prayer! Withhold thy hand awhileâ Thy wondrous handâand smileâ Bind up thy streaming hair, That I may catch thee, child of heaven! And show theeâas to me thou'rt given. See yeâ'tis there!âhow blithsomely it goesâ With every feather tremblingâround it flows, An air-spun mantle, coloured with the rose. That is the genius!âsee! How gloriously, wild and freeâ All light, and fire, and energy! How carelessly he treads the air, Collecting hues and sun-beams thereâ And flashingâsprinklingâall aboutâ The canvass that's before himâ Ten thousand tints of nameless hueâ Of mingling sunshineâtender blueâ The gushing of the happy heart, The lustre of the kindling eyeâ When lifted to the evening skyâ Now pausingâdwellingâtouching out The secret meaning of each partâ The faint and tearful tendernessâ The thought that nothing can expressâ O, who would not adore him! 'Tis doneâthe mingling tints grow warmâ Within the wash appears a form, Peering like Iris thro' the storm;â The lightningâthat he caught but now From yonder cloudâbeneath a brow, Of loveliness and roguery, Is flashing fast and wickedly. You've âseen it!ââhey?âyou âknow that face?ââ âThe young coquette!ââall light and grace: 'Tis she indeedâand now, the tint That on his fire-tipped pencil dweltâ A rose-bud's heart that seemed to meltâ Is changed into a lipâand now the dew, That he just pilfered from a flowerâ Yet freshly weeping from a shower, Is sprinkled o'er its pulpy redâ And now â My conscience! what a chase I'm led This paintingâsureâthe devil's in't. SONG. I'VE loved to hear the war-horn's cry, And panted at the drum's deep roll; And held my breath, whenâflaming highâ I've seen our starry banners fly, As challenging the haughty sky, They stirred the battle in my soul: For I was so adventurous then, I burnt to be the slaveâof men. I've looked upon the morning light, Flushing its standard far and free; And seen it struggle with the night, And loved it, for it told of fight; And every flash that triumph'd bright, Seemed glance of glorious Liberty! For I was fanciful and wild, As youthful Freedom's freest child. I've sailed upon the dark-blue deep: I've shouted to the eaglet soaring; And hung me from a rocking steep, When all but spirits were asleep; And oh, my very soul would leap! To hear its gallant waters roaring; For every sound that told of life, To me, was but the voice of strife. But, I am strangely altered nowâ I love no more the bugle's voiceâ The rushing waveâthe plunging prowâ The mountain's tempest-clouded browâ The daringâthe exulting flow Of all that made me once rejoiceâ I've learnt to talk of tearsâand sighsâ And locks of goldâand dying eyes! The Lyre of the Winds. HARK! 'tis the harp's wild minstrel tone, Convulsiveâquiveringâstrange and lone: Now bursting on the earânow goneâ Now piping 'mid the breeze, as tho' it told That some bright spirit had to heaven flown, And angel-trumpets had its welcome blown! And now, so full of pompâso deepâso bold, So strongâso steady were its numbers roll'd, As if Prediction smote its trembling chords, And with the weight of prophecy oppressed them; Then such rich tones concealed her fearful words, As if dear Pity had herself expressed them: So indistinct these murmurs were, They seemed, sometimes, still less than air; Sometimesâas if the shrinking strings Were swept by Phrensy's burning wingsâ Now with an unknown spirit speaking, Now ringing fierce and sharp! now low, With startling nearness, pealing now, Nowâdistantâfaintâand sadâand slowâ Like Feeling's murmurs, when her heart is breaking: Or sounds we dream of, when our souls are waking. Now like the flute, whose trancing note, In visions, o'er our memories float, As all along the trembling air It seems to send its spirit there; And nowâthe pipe's deep, drowsy, breath, Complaining like the march of deathâ And now, the fiery hautboy's cry, Echoing along the clear blue sky! And nowâa lightly shouting strain, As if, across the slumbering main, Green Erin's Bardsâa shadowy trainâ Were tuning all their harps again: And nowâthe ardentâquivering lyre Flashing and chiming higherâhigherâ And now the sea-nymph's winding shell, Stealing like sighs through ocean cellâ From where the minstrel mermaids dwell: Now a silvery sob, as of elf-babe straying; Now distant, yet clear, like fairy-steed neighing, When it springs on the air with a spirited shake, And is answered again from the hare-bell and brake; And bright little warriors jump upâall awake! When the cry of their bugles are heard for the strife, And it gallops abroad full of laughter, and life; When a diamond-edged scymetar swings from each side, And their streamers sing clearly and sharp as they ride; When Echo leans forward and mimicks the sound, And Melody leaps to their helmet's fine ringing; And the minstrels of fairy-land, prancing around, On cymbal-hoofed chargersâare shouting and singing, And the sweet, bustling sounds are all dancing and light, As if spirits of harmony mingled in fight, And clank'd their ton'd armour, and pour'd their sweet breath, In a struggle for Melody's wind-woven wreath. The following text appears in the errata in the source text. The reader is desired to spell warriour, terrour, and such words with an u, throughout the whole book. I am not particularly partial to Dr. Johnson, but I have sufficient respect to the best standard in our language, to follow it, even in triflesâand I did follow it, but the improvements of the printer have rendered this note necessary.</field>
