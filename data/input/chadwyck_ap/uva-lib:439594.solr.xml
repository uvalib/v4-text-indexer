      <field name="fulltext">TO MY DEAREST SISTER EMELINE, WHO TAUGHT MY CHILDHOOD TO SEE THAT POETRY AND RELIGION ARE ONE, I DEDICATE THIS COLLECTION OF MY SONGS AND HYMNS, WHICH HAS JUST MISSED HER EARTHLY APPROVAL. E. A. S. Passed hence, Sunday, July 17, 1892. My Sister-Spirit, given to me To love me with an angel's love, Whom I no more on earth shall see, I claim thee, in thy house above! Our love had roots beyond the earth, Though planted by one roof-tree here; Where now thou art it had its birth,â Beside Life's River, cool and clear. And by its fragrance in my heartâ The breath of an immortal flowerâ I know we are not far apart; So life grows sweeter, hour by hour. God gives to us the Love He is: No spray of this true Vine can die: Loving as He loves, we are His; This is our immortality.â Dear Saviour-Friend, Immanuel, In whom all other friends we find, With us as with our angels dwell, Nor let them leave us far behind! So well she knew Thy Face Divine, We felt her life Thy Presence prove: O hide our lives with hers, in Thine! For Thou art Heaven, since Thou art Love! GOD IN CHRIST. O thou far-off, eternal God, Within all life, beyond all thought, We seek Thee through Thy worlds abroad; Thy footsteps trace, but find Thee not; All forms of being Thou dost fill, A strange, retreating Mystery still. Far-off Thou art, and yet most near! Thou comest in Christ our souls to meet, A Presence close and warm and dear; A Sympathy, a Friendship sweet; One with ourselves in Him Thou art;â Our Father, with a Brother's heart. The Source of all the tenderness Whereof our lonely souls have dreamed,â A boundless Power and Will to bless,â Thy Life into our lives hath streamed. We grope not through the void alone; Thou callest us, claimest us for Thine own. Into Thy hand Thou takest ours; We lean our weary hearts on Thine; Our inmost thoughts, our utmost powers Unfold within Thy Light Divine: And in the Spirit of Thy Son Our little lives with Thine are one. Thy mysteries deepen and increase; Beyond our path we cannot see; Christ is our Refuge and our Peace; Through Him we are at home with Thee; In Him we know Thee as Thou art:â Thou lovest us with a human Heart! THE IMMORTAL NOW. Sit not blindfold, Soul, and sigh For the immortal By-and-by! Dreamer, seek not heaven afar On the shores of some strange star! This a star isâthis, thine Earth! Here the germ awakes to birth Of God's sacred life in theeâ Heir of immortality! Inmost heaven its radiance pours Round thy windows, at thy doors, Asking but to be let in; Waiting to flood out thy sin; Offering thee unfailing health, Love's refreshment, boundless wealth: Voices at thy life's gate say, âBe immortal, Soul, to-day!â Thou canst shut the splendor out; Darken every room with doubt; From the entering angels hide Under tinseled wefts of pride; While the pure in heart behold God in every flower unfold; While the poor His kingdom share, Reigning with Him everywhere. Oh, let Christ and sunshine in! Let His love its sweet way win! Nothing human is too mean To receive the King unseen: Not a pleasure or a care But celestial robes may wear; Impulse, thought, and action may Live immortally to-day. Balance not in scales of time Deathless destinies sublime! What vague future can weigh down This great Now that is thine own? Love were miserly that gave Only gifts beyond the grave. Heaven makes every earth-plant thrive; All things are in God alive. Oh, the stifled bliss and mirth At the weary heart of Earth, We, her children, might awake! Songs would from her bosom break; Toil, unfettered from its curse, God's glad purpose would rehearse, If with Him we understood Of creationââIt is good.â Soul, perceive thy perfect hour! Let thy life burst into flower! Heaven is opening to bestow More than thou canst think or know. Now to thy true height arise! Enter now thy Paradise! In to-day, to-morrow see, Now is immortality! GOD'S BEST GIFT. What is the best a friend can be To any soul, to you or me? Not only shelter, comfort, rest, Inmost refreshment unexpressed; Not only a belovÃ¨d guide To thread life's labyrinth at our side, Or with love's torch lead on before;â Though these be much, there yet is more. The best friend is an atmosphere Warm with all inspirations dear, Wherein we breathe the large, free breath Of life that has no taint of death. Our friend is an unconscious part Of every true beat of our heart; A strength, a growth, whence we derive God's health, that keeps the world alive. The best friend is horizon, too, Lifting unseen things into view, And widening every petty claim Till lost in some sublimer aim; Blending all barriers in the great Infinities that round us wait. Friendship is an eternity Where soul with soul walks, heavenly free. Can friend lose friend? Believe it not! The tissue whereof life is wrought, Weaving the separate into one, Nor end hath, nor beginning; spun From subtle threads of destiny, Finer than thought of man can see. God takes not back his gifts divine; While thy soul lives, thy friend is thine. If but one friend has crossed thy way, Once only, in thy mortal day; If only once life's best surprise Has opened on thy human eyes,â Ingrate thou wert, indeed, if thou Didst not in that rare presence bow, And on earth's holy ground, unshod, Speak softlier the dear name of God. SONG-WEFTS. The grace of the bending grasses, The flush of the dawn-lit sky, The scent that lingers and passes When the loitering wind goes by, Are gushes and hints of sweetness, From the unseen deeps afar,â The foam-edge of heaven's completeness Swept outward through flower and star. For the cloud, and the leaf, and the blossom, The shadow, the flickering beam, Are waifs on the sea-like bosom Of beauty beyond our dream: Its glow to our earth is given; It freshens this lower air: Oh, the fathomless wells of heaven,â The springs of the earth rise there! The curtain of the dark Is pierced by many a rent: Out of the star-wells, spark on spark Trickles through night's torn tent. Grief is a tattered tent Wherethrough God's light doth shine: Who glances up, at every rent Shall catch a ray divine. Despair not thou of any fallen soul's fate, Till thou hast knelt beside it in the mire, And mingled with its moanings desolate The heavenward whisper of thy heart's desire; Till thou hast felt it thrill with thine own faith In Him who looks not on us as we are, But wakes the immortal in us by His breath, And puts remembrance of our sins afar. The noblest creature of a mortal birth Rose to its beauteous dignity of place Not without many a lingering stain of earth, Wherein all souls are set, a little space; And thou into the haunts of shame and crime Like an awakening breeze of Heaven mayest go, Knowing that out of blackest depths of slime May spring up lilies whiter than the snow. From the reek of the pond the lily Has risen, in raiment white, A spirit of air and water, A form of incarnate light. Yet, except for the rooted stem That steadies her diadem, Except for the earth she is nourished by, Could the soul of the lily have climbed to the sky? Where does the snow go, So white on the ground? Under May's azure No flake can be found. Look into the lily Some sweet summer hour; There blooms the snow In the heart of the flower. Where does the love go, Frozen to grief? Along the heart's fibres Its cold thrill is brief. The snow-fall of sorrow Turns not to dry dust; It lives in white blossoms Of patience and trust. IN SORROW. This my comfort is in sorrow: Every grief I have is Thine: Heaviest clouds around me borrow Radiance from Thy smile divine. Lamb of God, for us, the sinning, From the world's foundation slain, To Thy heart Thy wanderers winning,â In Thy love I drown my pain. This is my soul's consolation; Grief hath made me all Thine own. Nevermore shall separation Of my will from Thine be known. Thou, who readest my inmost story, With Thy courage make me strong! Thou, whose thorn-crown is Thy glory, Let my sorrow be my song! Thou, in mortal anguish lonely, Gavest Thy life our hurts to heal: Count not this my suffering only! Woes of all who weep I feel. Take our human consecration! Help some sad soul through our pain! Thou, whose wounds are our salvation, Let no heart have bled in vain! IN THE DARK O thou who art my only Light, Thee do I follow through the night; Though home and hope are out of sight, Firm trust in Thee my spirit hath; Thou knowest my path! Although I cannot see Thy face, I feel the warmth of Thy embrace. Enfold me in the dangerous place Where sin lies waiting to betray; Thou knowest my way. O Thou who seest me through and through,â The thoughts I think, the deeds I do,â Thou knowest I would to Thee be true! O draw me closer to Thy side, My Lord, my Guide! Thou knewest me, lovedst me in the past, Even when the tempter held me fast: Thy wanderer has come home at last, Never again from Thee to strayâ From Thee, my Way! I know not what may yet unfold Beyond the morning's gates of gold. This is my heaven, Thy hand to hold, Thy steps to follow through the night,â My Life, my Light! AT THY FEET. Lord, I would offer Thee A heart's untarnished gold, And yet how can it be When all there is in me Is touched with blight and mould? I find within no thought So holy that it may Unshamed to Thee be brought, Except as it hath caught From Thee a hallowing ray. Yet all I am is Thine. Through sins and flaws and stains I feel Thy Presence shine. Take me, and make divine All that uncleansed remains! Lord, of Thyself not much In me canst Thou behold, And yet Thou savest such; The magic of Thy touch Transmutes my dross to gold. Contrition Thou dost prize All sacrifice above. Dear Lord, I dare arise And look into Thine eyes, Because I know Thy love. SAVED. What is the soul He would save?â The being, with all its powers; The root, with its leaves and flowers: All possible good we can crave In this God-given life of ours. From what would He save the soul?â From contented selfishness, And from bleak unlovingness; From the lower aim's control, From the downward passion's stress. From the hell of an evil choice, When our eyes on His Presence close; From an earth-clogged ear that knows No tone of His tender voice; From a void heart's waste of woes. He saveth thee, soul, for what?â To be born anew, as a child, In the clear and open thought; In the love that envieth not; The desires all undefiled. To enrich thee with every gift That His fatherly thought can plan: From belittling sins to lift Thee up to the angel swift, And the stature of a man! He saveth thee, soul, to be As the cleansing salt and the leaven: His mind and His will to see; To be faithful and strong and free In the truth, which alone is heaven. Not to wait for the Far-away, Wrapped in Eden-dreams,âbut now To become a warmth, a ray, O Christ, of Thy deathless day! For the Life of our life art Thou! âEVEN AS HE IS PURE.â Thou who seest my soul within, Thou who knowest my unknown sin, Through Thy holy eyes let me Learn what sin is unto Thee! Oh, my Saviour undefiled, Leave me not by self beguiled, Blinded by my heart's deceit, For Thy friendship all unmeet! If there be in me a thought That Thy dear name honoreth not, Pierce it with Thy pitying gaze Till its silence turns to praise! Make me, Pure One, as Thou art, Pure in soul and mind and heart; Never satisfied with less Than Thy perfect holiness! Bathing in Thy love's clear stream, Let my soul fulfill her dream, Beautified with every grace Shining on me from Thy face! None Thy holy heaven may win Stained with earthliness and sin: They must in white robes appear, Who Thy whiteness venture near. Cleanse us, fill us, Soul Divine, With a purity like Thine, That within, without us, we In clear vision, God may see! âBE YE THEREFORE PERFECT.â Oh, the beauty and the joy of living As the children of our Father, God! All we have and hope for gladly giving His abounding love to pour abroad,â Healing waters of His pure salvation, Through the world for which His Son has died: Sharing in our Master's consecration; Walking at our Elder Brother's side. Wonderful the whiteness of Thy glory! Can we truly that perfection share? Yes; our lives are pages of Thy story; We Thy shape and superscription bear: Tarnished formsâtorn leavesâbut Thou canst mend them; Thou Thine own completeness canst unfold From our imperfections, and wilt end them; Dross consuming, turning dust to gold. Like a snowy mountain-peak above us, âBe ye perfect!â dazzles our dim eyes. Canst Thou look from Thy pure height and love us? May our earth-clogged feet to Thee arise? We before the vision veil our faces, Yet would have it not a ray less bright. Shine into our sin's dark hiding-places! Fill us, flood us with Thy cleansing light! Perfect even as Thou art perfect, Father! As the little hilltops catch the sun; As the small shoots springing up together Round the Tree of Life, with it are one. In these earthen vessels heavenly treasure For the enrichment of Thy poor may shine: Thou canst fill us, in our human measure, With Thy being's overflow divine. Perfect only with God's own perfection! Drop the crumbling model shaped of clay! Break the weak ideal of man's erection! Let the Real burn the false away! This is lifeâto pour out love unstinted! Good and evil sunlike blesseth He: Through your finite is His infinite hinted:â Children of your Father must ye be. THE KING AT THE DOOR. Lift up the everlasting gates! The King before your threshold waits. Shall He who life's great building planned Unwelcomed at its portal stand? Is there a corner of your heart Where you retreat, alone, apart, A sanctuary all your own? Behold! He made it for His throne. Is there a darkness, where, shut in, You dare not face your secret sin? Lo! there He built His mercy seat, There He your humbled soul will meet. Have you a stately banquet hall Where guests from many a clime you call? You see not any face aright Until He enters with His light. Ye rich ones, why will ye abide In poverty of lonely pride? Your silver and your gold are dim, Your house is empty, without Him. Ye lowly ones, if ye are His, Ye have no need of palaces, Since that rich soul can lack for naught Who lets God in at every thought. Lift up the everlasting gates! The King at His own threshold waits.â Enter, O Lord, and with Thy face Make glorious this Thy dwelling place! THE SEEKER. âIf selfishly Thy heaven I seek, I seek Thy heaven in vain,ââ I heard my heart within me speak: I hear it yet again. For heaven is all unselfishness: The souls whose home is there Have never dreamed of happiness They do not long to share. If selfishly Thy love I seek, I seek Thy love in vain. Place at Thy side need none bespeak Who shrink back from Thy pain. For loveâThy loveâis sacrifice: Who seeketh still his own, Nor for his brethren lives and dies, Thyself hath never known. Dear Lord, each selfish thought we think Puts us afar from Thee: Into our own dark depths we sink, Where heaven can never be. Teach us to know Thee as Thou art;â To give as Thou hast given! Oh, show us how the loving heart May make this world a heaven! BESIDE THE CROSS. Jesus, in Thy death I see What Thy life is unto me! Now no longer is the Cross Sign to me of shame and loss: Joy it is, to share Thy pain; All I lose is glorious gain. Lord, to me this blessing giveâ In Thy death to dieâand live! Jesus, from Thy wounded side Flows through me a living tide; Health and hope and righteousness; Power to do, and will to bless. Now am I no more mine own: Now I live Thy life alone. Self is slain without a sigh: Life it is, with Thee to die! Jesus, let Thy blood within Cleanse my inmost thoughts from sin; Purify my lingering stains; Be the life-throb in my veins! Be it mine Thy cross to bear, And Thy sacrifice to share! Be my food, my strength, my breath! Be my Life, and conquer death! EASTER. (SUNSET AND SUNRISE.) 'T is Easter eve; the day is fading; O Thou, with whom there is no death, While twilight every path is shading, Breathe through us thy sweet Spirit's breath! And when our last night comes, may we Fall peacefully asleep in Thee! The sun sets not; it is earth going Awhile to hide her from the sun, Where gentler, cooler winds are blowing; To feel the coming day begun Beneath soft night's refreshing dews;â To wait for light she cannot lose. To die with Christâit is not dying; It is but sinking deep with Him Into the Father's bosom, lying In that warm, sheltering silence dim, Until the radiance of His eyes Shines into ours, and slumber flies. Sunrise!âit is the world arising:â Her Lord, the Sun, she turns to meet, Strange beauty everywhere surprising Her stepsâglad births of light and heat; It is earth's face with joy aglow To see life round her bud and grow. To rise with Christâit is awaking Into the brightness of God's face; It is to see His splendor breaking Through every form, in every place, As all along the heavenly way Unfolds the dawn of His great day. O Christ! this holy Easter morning Pierce every shadow of our sin With love's dear beckoning, truth's forewarning! Thy life anew in us begin! Let us the Father's glory see, And rise into His light with Thee! CHRIST IS ARISEN. Vainly we make for Thee a grave apart, Each in the lonely garden of his heart:â Thou, who the Life and Love Eternal art:â Alleluia! Christ is arisen! Where have they laid our Lord? we ask in fear; Nor know the Voice that speaks in accents clear: âWhy weepest thou? Behold Me! I am here!â Alleluia! Christ is arisen! While we with tears bedew thine empty tomb, Thy Face is shining through the garden's gloom:â Lo! the birds singing, and the flowers in bloom! Alleluia! Christ is arisen! Is it our love that makes our hearts so blind? With spice and balm thy form we may not bind; Thou art alive for us and all mankind! Alleluia! Christ is arisen! And gently Thou reprovestââTouch me not! Nor hold the feet back with thy clinging thought, That rest not till a heavenlier work be wrought!â Alleluia! Christ is arisen! Dear Master, in Thy footsteps let us go, Till with Thy Presence all our lives shall glow, And souls through us Thy resurrection know! Alleluia! Christ is arisen! Earth feels the dawn of Thy new day arrive: The dead around us in their graves revive: In Thee, O Christ! shall all be made alive! Alleluia! Christ is arisen! AS A FLOWER. Open your heart as a flower to the light! Darkness is passing; the Sun is in sight; Morning with splendor is piercing life through, Arrows of radiance, and spear-tips of dew. Glad is the world in the Holy One's birth. Lo, the new heavens! and lo, the new earth! Scattered and fled are the phantoms of night: Christ is the victor, and Christ is the Light! Open your heart, and His love will shine in, Cleansing and healing the hurt of your sin. Who can resist Him, the Saviour, the Son? Hell flies before Him, and Heaven is won. Open your heart as a flower to the light! Bloom and bear fruit in the glory of right! Be of His Presence a perfume, a ray, Child of the morning, and heir of the day! AT THE FEAST. This is not only bread and wineâ Thy body and Thy bloodâ It is Thyself, Thy Life Divine, That is our spirit's food. It is the feast of Life, not death, That now we celebrate; Breathe into us Thy Spirit's breath, As here for Thee we wait! Thou art alive! O let us be To life in Thee restored! The new wine of Thy Kingdom we Would drink with Thee, dear Lord! CHILDREN'S JUNE SONG. Little ones, let us be happy together In this beautiful world of ours! Let us be glad in this sweet June weather, With the birds and the breezes and flowers, With the grass and the earth, with the sky and the sunâ Let us be glad in the summer begun! There are praises rising, and prayers are springing, From the heart of creation to-day; Hark! Faith with a chant and a carol is winging Her flight up the heavenly way! Let thought unto thought with the sweetness ring! Little ones, open your hearts and sing! For a loving life breathes a fragrance dearer To God than the breath of a rose, And the song of the soul has a melody clearer Than the lark or the linnet knows; And ever He leans from the silence dim And waits for the music you make to Him. Little ones, let us be part of the story Of joy that the world has to tell! Let us bloom in the beauty and sing of the glory Of God, who has loved us so well! Let us give Him ourselves, for to Him we belongâ Each life be His blossom, each soul be His song! WANDERERS' HYMN. O God, from Thee we would not stray: Reveal to us Thyself, the Way! Recall us, claim us when we roam! Thou art our country and our home. With Thee, in Thee alone is rest: Thou art our East, and Thou our West. Our little lives of Thine are part: No boundaries bar us from Thy heart. Through starless night, through mist and gale, Thou art the shore toward which we sail; We bid farewell to friends most kind, But never leave Thy love behind. It perfumes every foreign flower; It brightens every homesick hour; It greets us in the stranger's eye, With the heart's question and reply. For none are alien, none are strange, Met in the Love that cannot change; We all are brethren in Thy Sonâ The Father and the children one. O Christ, Thou art the atmosphere Of heaven, breathed into mortals here! Sharing Thy holy sacrifice We live, and sin within us dies. Be in us! Let Thy Spirit strong Inspire towards good, and win from wrong; Save us from base and sinful strife, And draw us closer, life to life! We are but orphans, Lord, till we Thine in each other's face can see; O shelter us, below, above, In Thy great heights and depths of Love! LIFE IS GROWTH. (SUNG AT A REDEDICATION, WHEATON SEMINARY, MASSACHUSETTS.) Life is growth, and growth is change: Shall the new be counted strange, While the rich Past lends perfume To the Present in its bloom? Giving onâas they have given, Passed beyond us into heavenâ Hearts in this Thy service, Lord, Find their gift its own reward. New things blossom out of old; Fading lives with youth unfold, Standing in Thy sunrise bright, Bearing flower and fruit of light. Looking up into Thy face, Let us broaden, in our place; Glad in opening wide our doors,â Glad in pouring out our stores! Let our wish, our plan, our end, With Thy widening purpose blend! Shape Thou what we will and doâ Thou, who makest all things new! HIS STAR IN THE WEST. (READ AT A REUNION, MONTICELLO SEMINARY, ILLINOIS.) Our way still is onward; the world is yet young With a beauty that never was dreamed of, or sung: Her wonders for eyes that can see them unfold; And the heart that looks forward will never grow old. For the splendor that beckons is lifeâit is youth; The sweetness of hope, and the freshness of truth, That make a perpetual morning, a spring Where the flowers always blossom, the birds always sing. Look forward! move onward! the new work to do, Will strengthen our sinews, create earth anew! There are suns beyond suns; there 's an East in the West; In all unexplored seas there are Isles of the Blest. The years gather over usâonly a veil For the things that are seen: earthly vision must fail, That the heavenly may clear; the awakening soul Looks up, drops the fragments, inherits the whole. Lost empires in Orient oceans are drowned; Not the Past, but the Future, comes up to be crowned. Wise men in the East with a great light were blest; It was Bethlehem's Star, and it led to the West. It led to the West, and it greatened and glowed For apostles and martyrs, revealing the roadâ Still westwardâthose pioneer-spirits must take, Who would bear on Christ's gospel, and die for His sake. To His latter-day triumph the rich nations bring Their glory and honor; the earth knows her King. Our planet rolls into His light from afar; The true star of empire is Bethlehem's Star. The kingdom is His; bring Him beauty and youth! The trophies of learning, the treasures of truth! Never yet was a conquest of science complete Until it was laid at the Holy Child's feet. His cradle is still in the West, as of old. Through the sunset press on, until sunrise unfold The light that was never on land or on seaâ The light of His coming, the Life that shall be! By the glow of that vision we read what we lack; Inspired, not disheartened; the beautiful track Entices the traveler forth, day by day, Entranced with the infinite joy of the way. We may mourn that the guerdon we seek is not gained; That the heights we look up to, remain unattained; But we lower no standard; the Best draws us on, Though the perfect ideal eludes us, unwon. We shall win it, O dear fellow-pilgrims! We know The voices that call through the clear Western glow. By the old saints forever a new song is sung: Life beckons us on, and life always is young. LOVE'S LATE REMORSE. How will it be When you at last in heaven we see,â Dear souls, whose footsteps in lost days, Made musical earth's toil-worn ways, While we not half the loneliness That bound you to our side could guess? Where angels know your footfall, we Are fain to be. We never knewâ So heedlessly we walked with youâ The drops we jostled from your cup, That, spilt, could not be gathered up: We might have given you foam and glow From our own beaker's overflow;â Ah! what we might have been to you, We never knew! We might have lent Such strength, such comfort and content To you, out of our ample store: We might have hastened on before To lift the shadows from your way, Darkened, ere noon, to twilight's gray; With earth's cold air love's warm heart-scent We might have blent. Dear, wistful eyes, Ye haunt us with your kind surprise, Your tender wonder that a heart Should thus be left alone, apart, So loving, so misunderstood By us, in our self-centred mood: Alas! in vain to you arise Our longing cries! Oh, will you wait For us, beyond the shining gate? Though lovely gifts behind you left, We want yourselves: we are bereft. From your new mansion glorious Will you lean out to look for us? Shut is the far-off, shining gate:â Are we too late? FOR LARGER LIVES. In heaven, they say, is undisturbed and perfect peace; and yet Along our heart-strings, even there, a tremor of regret Must sometimes wander into pain, if memory survives,â A grief, that in this good, great world we lived not larger lives. God moves our planet gloriously among His starry spheres; And nobler movements for our souls through these our mortal years, In widening orbits toward Himself eternally He planned:â We creep and rust in treadmill grooves; we will not be made grand. He sent us forth, His children, of His inmost life a part; His breath, His being; each a throb of His deep Father-heart; He shaped us in His image, suns, to flood His worlds with day:â Alas! we stifle down His light, and deaden into clay. Meant to be living fountains,ânot little stagnant pools, Stirred aimlessly from shallow depths, walled round with petty rules, Drying away to dust at last,âto Him we might ascend, And with the River of His Life in crystal freshness blend. To share His freedomâsons of God! There is no other aim Can kindle any human hope to an immortal flame! It is the keenest shame of these mean, fettered lives we lead,â We choose the weights that drag us down, refusing to be freed. Yet souls that win immortal heights unclogged with self must move: The only thing that we can take from earth to heaven is love. To make us great like Thee, O God! Thy Spirit with us strives:â Enlarge our hearts to take Thee in! O give us nobler lives! A DOOR OPENED. Might a door but be opened in heaven! Might we look for a moment within! Might only one comforting glimpse be given, Of the life that we hope to win! A door has been opened in heaven:â Its glory shone full on the earth, When the clouds of her midnight were smitten and riven By the joy of the Christ-Child's birth. And a door is yet opened in heaven; Its light floods our world to its brim, When a soul, for His truth having suffered and striven, Ascends, a crowned conqueror, to Him. WITHDRAWAL. J. G. W. September 7, 1892. Was it thy step on the mountain-side? Was it thy voice in the air?â Strange beauty illumined the landscape wide; The world lay in heaven-light there. And a whisper, a breath, through my trouble went;â Did a soul speak, passing by?â âAh, see how the heights and the levels are blent, How the peaks are dissolved in the sky! âOne tender suffusion of splendor is this,â Blue summits and meadows green! So peaceful, so soft the withdrawal is Of a life into Light unseen.â âThy spirit was passingâI knew it notâ Beyond the light of the sun! And the world thou hast left has a radiance caught From the glory that thou hast won. And my soul arises and follows thine Up the luminous heavenward slope; For thy beautiful footprints make earth divine With the glow of a deathless hope. On Moosilauke Mountain, N. H.</field>
