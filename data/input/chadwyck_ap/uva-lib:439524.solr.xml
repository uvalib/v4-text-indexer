      <field name="fulltext">THE POET AND NATURE [When things go wrong, as they often will] When things go wrong, as they often will, And it's hard to understand, Just whistle a song, as you face the mill, And take your work in hand, And do your best, however men sneer, And 't will all come right, somehow, my dear, 'T will all come right somehow. Stick to the work that you have to do, And whatever it is, don't mind; Just whistle a song of dreams-come-true, And in the end you'll find, A word will help and a smile will cheer However the work may go, my dear, However the work may go. [The Summer hears you where she swings] The Summer hears you where she swings Among her poppy-pods and dreams, While overhead the redbird sings, The blue-jay screams. She hears you by the garden fence, A twilight sound, that takes the sense With drowsy indolence. Deep in the meditating wood Where August sits with sultry eyes, Thinking of leaves and solitude, And lazy skies, One listens, searching grass and ground For your cool crystal of green sound, That glints around and round. And on the hills, when sunset glows, Red as the rose that tints a shell Of azure pearl, your music grows A fairy spell; And at its sound Day lays her down To rest, in gold and russet gown, Crowned with her starry crown. And lying there, as in a dream, Hearing your bell-note, at a glance She seems to see, where moonbeams gleam, The elfins dance; And, looking nearer, lo, she sees Your airy wings pulse in the breeze, Among the weeds and trees. And on a fingertip of dew She lifts you, singing, to the moon; And ghosts of wonders, Boyhood knew, To your frail tune, Rise from their graves, like mists, and stand Around you, hand in tiny hand, Beckoning to Elfinland. The Oversoul Lord of the Oversoul, high Power! a part Of life's great purposes! bright Essence, bound To lofty deeds; one with Earth's common round, Having dominion o'er the human heart, Through whom you build your worlds without a sound— Keep those in mind, in whom the rare seeds start Of beauty; dreams, that mortals christen Art, And Love, of which great Nature is the ground. Exert for them that power, held on high! And wield your sceptre for their strength of mind! Sustain their weakness! shield the instrument Through which you labor, from the needs that lie Around all life! and in a way as kind Fulfill your purpose of divine intent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE MORNING ROAD. THE MORNING ROAD. The Morning drew a shawl Of misty lace around her, And by the wood's high wall Stood smiling, bright and tall, When I, who heard her call, Went forth and found her. Upon the sun-kissed hill, And in the vale below, She'd dropped a daffodil, Golden and chaste and chill, And on the water-mill A rose of snow. She said, “At last you've come, And left the world's carouse, The palace and the slum; No more shall soul be dumb; Come; look at your new home— A pleasant house.” Then took me by the heart, And led a magic way, By paths that are a part Of Faeryland, and start From the forgotten mart Of Yesterday. And when we'd gone a mile, She pointed me a place O'er which there hung a smile; And on its sill and stile A promise, without guile, As of a face. And in the doorway there, A baby at her breast, One stood, quite young and fair, Peace, with the golden hair, Peace, that knows naught of care, But only rest. I knew at once 't was she, For whom all mortals long, Who, with simplicity, And faith, that's sweet to see, Dwells, guarding constantly, Her child, named Song. She bade me enter in; Sit by her quiet fire; Forget the world of din, And safe from hate and sin, With her and Song to win My heart's desire. MICHING MALLECHO. “Marry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief.”— Hamlet. The crickets tease the dusk with tune, And from the lily-padded pool The green-frogs hail the rising moon, Earth-summoned like a great toadstool. The Elf of Mischief is abroad, Torched by a jack-o'-lantern ray, Hosting the woodland, rock and road, With the wild minions of her play. The spider casts a web across Their revels that no eye perceives; While slowly from concealing moss The mushroom broad its table heaves. The moth takes flight from bloom to bloom, To courier news through all the dells; And from the straitness of their room The gnats put out their sentinels. The beetle in the dead wood ticks— An armored guard; the firefly, With gleaming points, the darkness flicks— The goblin watch of Witchery. This is the path the Queen will pass Upon her palfried snail, as planned, Where Mystery has gemmed the grass With dew, dim-dropping from her hand. The fairy-life is out and waits Its Queen, who holds her audience Here in the heart of her estates— The angle of this old rail-fence. Round which the flowers have built a bower Of lace, above which soon the moon Will hang her lamp, and at which hour You, too, shall see their twinkling shoon. THE FAERY RING. The moon, white as a cotton-flower, Hung broad above the hill, When from the old oak's toppling tower The owl cried and was still. There came a stealthy sound; and then The cricket hushed its tune, And here and there and back again The bat dodged by the moon. The woodland held its breath to see What was it would befall; And underneath each bush and tree The flow'rs stood listening all. Again there came that stealthy sound, As secret as the dew; And then I saw upon the ground The toadstools thrusting through. And at each toadstool's root there stood An elfin-thing that pushed, And leaned, and harkened in the wood To hear if all was hushed. Then round the toadstools, white as milk, They danced, with flying locks, Their trousers made of moonflower-silk, Their gowns of four-o'-clocks. A cricket piped, a frog drummed near— In pixy minstrelsy. And round and round in moonlight clear, They led their revelry. Until far off I heard a cock Crow—and the elves were gone, Leaving these toadstools by the rock For us to see at dawn. THE WOOD SPIRIT. The old trees stood around, Making no sound, Breathless, and watching something on the ground. As, tiptoe, I drew near, A sense of fear Grew in me of a wonder to appear. The brook cried, “Have a care!” A thrush, “Beware!” And then I heard a wild foot dancing there. Who could the dancer be? What mystery Held now the wood in such anxiety? I stopped a while and spied On every side— Who danced there?—one the old trees sought to hide? Was it a Faun?—or, what? There was a plot To keep me back, to hold me from the spot. Again I made advance— And, there! a glance Of one, a girl, dancing a wildflower dance. But hardly had I seen When, quick, between My eyes and her a great bough thrust its screen. And the deep wood gave out A mighty shout, And in my face, ere I could turn about, A bramble struck me fair.— I did not care, But through the thorny thicket burst to stare— On no one.—Just a tree Confronted me, And looked as innocent as it could be. Only, in trunk and bough, I felt, somehow, At my confusion it was laughing now. AUTUMN. In the misty valley, Autumn, moving drowsily, Slipping rings of marigolds on her chilly fingers, Binds her gipsy locks with gems as she wanders frowsily 'Mid the ageratum stalks where in dreams she lingers. In the fields her footprints shine in aster-glimmerings. And by streams, o'er which she leans as above a mirror, Gazing on her face awhile in its lacy shimmerings Of the mist that swathes her form when the dusk draws nearer. In her hand she folds the bee, crooning soft and honeyly, Then within a gentian-crib bids its heart be quiet; And the butterfly she takes, winging over sunnily, Drops it weary on a rose saying, “There! rest by it!” And all night one hears her gown rustling sere and frostily As her creaking shoes go by with their cricket-buckles; Through the moonlight, past the door, stealing gray and ghostily, Now upon the pane she taps with her twig-like knuckles. Somewhere yonder, in the dark, where the owl hoots—meagrely Death is waiting, grim and gaunt, in the fading forest; Bleak of face and hollow-eyed, who shall seize her eagerly, Drag her to the underworld when the storm is sorest. RAGWEED. To me There is a mystery In what the crickets sing, The beetles drone, or, with its vibrant wing, The grig may say, Chanting both night and day. I know there's sense And beauty in the way The mud-wasp molds the clay, Fashioning its hollow cell. There's no pretence In Nature, son, for I have seen Many a riddle solved, and been Laughed at for being a fool by many a one. Well, well! But now to tell you, just for fun, What happened to me yonder, in the sun, The broad daylight, there by that old rail-fence: Upon a ragweed stalk, like Puck, a-swing, Green as a katydid's wing, Snared in a spider's web, stretched taut and tense Above a woodland spring, I found a fairy thing, Dressed in a tattered green; A jaunty cap, The emerald husk of some slim pod or bean, Perched on his head; crook-kneed He sat, As watchful as a cat, Alert and hard to find; a ragged scrap Of weed himself; or like a roguish seed That cuddles snugly in a pea-pod's flap. I knew it for a goblin, without doubt, The spiderweb had snared itself about— He squatted, grinning, in the broad, bright noon, Humming a small-gnat's tune. And ho! Right so He eyed me, hide and hair, At first severely, A moment merely, Then yawned, a tiny yawn, that hinted clearly, That I could go! That said, With a side gesture of the head, “I can dispense, sir, with your company!” Then stretched himself as if to show He did not care to know Who the huge creature was that stopped to see What he himself might be; And stood to watch him swinging airily. 'T was all put on; designed indifference! I had some sense, Albeit he would not see, Or not acknowledge it could be! For he assumed a most offended air, And fixed a stare, Unmoving, on the old rail-fence; And then, Ere I had counted ten— Tap, tap! He stooped and gave a rap, A tiny rap, upon the ragweed stalk; Then bent and listened, leaning close an ear, As if was aught to hear; Mayhap the insect-talk I' the heart o' the weed— Some pixy thing, mayhap, Not bigger than a seed— Indeed— Whose message seemed most urgent, that was clear; Delivered in the whining of a gnat, Or woodfly, busy with the sugar-sap, And careful of his answer to the tap. Then, suddenly, the ragweed stalk went fat, Right in the smooth place where he leaned to rap; And, like a solid bubble o' green, a knob, Bulged outward; and from forth it blew a blob Of yeasty white, a silvery slime and—scat! As quick as that, He vanished into it—shoes, coat, and hat— And, where he'd sat, A cowspit fleck, from which my clue was drawn, Showed me the way he'd gone. But quick!— Knowing his trick— I cut the very stick Of ragweed through the middle, The stalk I have here, which I know for sure Holds him a prisoner.— There where you see it frothed and swelled, Tight as a fiddle He hides inside.—Now! Watch me!—scut! You see now where I held, I hold and cut The very spot! And—there! Now mark him in his lair!— Tut! tut! I brought him home for you to see! But, He has escaped! and left, most cleverly A small green worm to fool us, eh? But that's his way! And, let me tell you, sir, however that may be, That small green worm is—he! PAN OF THE BEECH WOODS. Down there in the old beech woods, Where the screech-owl sits and broods, And the rocks fume with the creek, Each a foam-fleck on its cheek, Pan keeps company with my moods, Running when a foot intrudes— Goat-foot Pan who oft eludes. Once I heard him, where he sat On a ferned and mossy mat, Whistling like a thrush or chat. I, you see, had quit my plow— Couldn't work that day somehow— And I followed—seemed to me Dronings of a pipe, or bee— Couldn't tell you which, I vow; But it led from bough to bough To the place we're standing now. There I watched him all that day, While he piped and danced away, With the forest-things at play. In the creek I saw a fin Wink; and then a terrapin Lift its head. A toad hopped out, Croaked, and crept Pan's feet about; He quit piping; took it in His brown hand and set its chin To his pipe and said, “Begin!” And the toad began to blow Music such as quavers low In the marsh when dusk comes slow. Nearing sunset as I drew Home, I glimpsed him, peering through Bush and brake; he seemed to stand With his Pan-pipes in one hand, Beckoning with the other to Something in the trees, that flew Down and muttered, “Who are you?” And Pan chuckled; set his oat To the owlet's feathered throat, Bade it blow a wildwood note. As it blew I saw him smile; Then he said, “You've had your trial! You can hunt now. Twilight comes. I must tune the beetle drums And each cricket-harp and viol.” Then he went. Each woodland aisle Droned his passage. After while, Far away upon a hill, Heard him piping, “Whippoorwill!” Listen! you may hear him still. NIGHT'S REVELRIES. Above the world, Pale, dew-impearled, Like lilies in blue pools of night, The stars float white; Enchantment is abroad with many a glowworm light Of green and silver ... Look you! where, With firefly-tangled hair, She leans above the water there, While, downy-winged, the great moon-moths take flight. To me it would seem right To see him now—Puck, brown and bare, Upon that web a-sway, Or sliding down a ray Of starlight with some fair, attendant fay; Or, on that toadstool's top astride, Squatting with arms akimbo, mouth ear-wide, And upright slits of flame instead of eyes, Watching and waiting till the full moon rise. But what are those So busy 'round that rose? Those moth-like things, And shapes, with beetle wings; And there! snail-gray in frog-like-fitting clothes— Where green that firefly glows— Leaving a trail of silver, what are those, Stilt-eyed and slow, That come and go below The rainbowed rows Of morning-glory bells And wine-stained shells Of balsam blooms? Do you suppose That they are grooms, Disguised, of Oberon? grim warders of his rooms? Or fairy maskers that the Night Sends through the goblin dusk To tag with wet each mushroom's rim, Or tap and trim Each bud until it open wide its petaled tusk? Or brim Its cup with dew and musk? Let us steal near, My dear. Night's at her revelries Among these flowers and trees. Perhaps if we could seize The moment, like those bees So snugly huddled in that flow'r, we, too, Might touch on things she dreams; and so behold The invisible host, the crew With which her heart makes bold When all the world's asleep and no one looks, Except the moon, who peeps in ferny nooks. FAERY FOREST. The freckled jewel-flower swings Its blossom where the orchid blushed, And, where the woodland deeps hung hushed, The raptured veery sings. . . . The Forest crooked an arm at me And murmured with its leaves, “Come, see The wonder and the mystery That haunt the heart of things.” And then I saw a spirit wild That danced within the waterfall, Or, like the beauty of a child, Hung laughing over all; I saw the fairy of the fern Toss emerald locks at every turn; And in the dew the elfin burn That holds the rose in thrall. I saw moon-presences of light Glow into form and glimmer 'round; And, with them, crystalling in sight, The winds with wild flowers crowned. I saw the Dryads sit at ease Within the hiding hearts of trees; And in the brambles, watching these, The Faun that none hath found. I saw the music all around, The lisp of leaf, the water's song, Evolve a form, a shape of sound, That glimmered green along; I saw the happiness that thrills The heart of things, that ebbs and fills, Dance with the rapture of the rills, And leap the woods among. A moment more and I had seen The Fairy-Queen as on she fared; And all that Nature's self may mean To me had been declared. But, lo! there came a sudden lull In action, and a step fell dull— A mortal's ... and the Beautiful Fled, like a wild thing scared. ELFIN. I found a vale, a haunted dell, Where, over all, there hung a spell; And underneath a streaming stone A glimmering spirit made its moan, Now murmuring through a crystal shell, Now on a harp of spar, while, blown About the place, the wild foam fell. I raised the rock that held it bound, And, straight, it changed into a sound That danced around me, dimly yet, Smelling of fern and violet; In mossy green and crystal gowned— A silvery girl of shimmering wet, Who round my form her cool arms wound. Upon my eyes she kissed me thrice With chilly lips of rosy ice; And with her kisses, like the foam, My heart grew light and fain to roam Away from all Earth's human ties. ... And so it was I left my home To dwell with Love that never dies. THE DANCER. Those gold marauders of the air, The brown bees, bustling everywhere, Led me away To where, in sulphur-colored showers, The Autumn heaped her gold of flowers, And bound her hair With all the beauty of their disarray. Above her head the birds took flight, And by her side a shape of light Danced like a Fay, Who wove strange magic with the grace Of glancing limbs and twinkling face, And raiment bright, That blew like gossamers about the day. Who was this creature, dancing past? Who came and went, now slow, now fast, At airy play; The goldenrod unto her feet Kept time; and with her heart's wild beat, To the very last, The Blackeyed-Susans set their heads asway. I asked of flower and of tree: “Who is this Elfin? what is she, So bright and gay?” They murmured what I could not hear; For she kept laughing in my ear, Bewildering me, And whispering words too wild for me to say. Then, in a moment, she was gone, Flying a veil of cloudy lawn, Pinned with a ray; And then I heard: “The Wind am I! The Wind, who now must say good-bye, And go till dawn And dance with stars and waves upon the bay.” And all night long, snug in my bed, I heard her feet as far they led The dancing spray; And to the moon and stars a shout She raised and tried to blow them out; Then laughed and fled To greet the dawn who walked on hilltops gray. THE LOST GARDEN. At close of day, As once in childhood, through the meadows gray, I took my way. Faint scents of myrrh, And twilight gleams of glimmering lavender, Led me to her, That fairy child, Who, to her garden, with its beauty wild, My soul beguiled. I seemed to see Her eyes again, like fireflies, 'neath a tree, Regarding me. She seemed to stand Fluttering the moon-moths with a dewy hand Across the land. And, following slow, I came into a place I used to know Long years ago. A place of peace, Guarded about by many stately trees, The home of bees. A garden place Of flowers and fruits, through which I oft would pace In childhood's days. And, following soft, An elfin voice, that murmured oft and oft, Far in the croft, All suddenly I saw her there, beneath a cedar tree, Pale, beckoning me. And with a smile She took my hand and led my soul a while Down many an aisle Of flowers; and told Of many dreams of beauty, known of old, That now are mold. And, as we walked Along the paths the moonbeams whitely chalked, The flowers talked. A rose-bloom said: “He is returned, who thought this garden dead— It lives, instead.” Another sighed: “He is come back to her, who was his guide, He dreamed had died.” One said, “'Tis plain She holds him still with all her elfin train Through heart and brain.” And all around There grew a whisper, like a twinkling sound, From air and ground. It sang, “We've grown Into the garden, making it our own With dreams here known. “With dreams, behold, That, dancing, changed the darkness of its mold To fairy gold. “Making it sweet With mental messages of spirit feet, That here still meet. “For still they weave Their spells within here. He, too, may perceive— We give him leave.” And I, at that, Beheld a secret place, a violet mat, On which one sat. A little lad, Who seemed to have the face that once I had, In days long glad. And then a star Fell, trailing heaven with a fiery scar. And, from afar, Glints of the moon Showed where the elfins tripped it to a rune— A cricket tune. And, as they passed, Around the boy their spirit spells were cast, And held him fast. Then they were gone, Somewhere into the region of the dawn; And night grew wan. And in my ear I heard a voice cry, “Wake! the dawn is near! Be gone from here!” And cold, afraid, In that lost garden where, a child, I played, I woke dismayed. THE HOUSE OF DREAMS. I know a house, that stands remote, With garden, barn, and pigeon-cote, Below a hill, beyond a wood. Like some old face beneath a hood, Its barn, with its one window-eye, Gray-roofed, and musk with hay and rye, Keeps watch upon the old post-road, That wanders by, Down which goes many a creaking load. 'Tis always Autumn there; the ways Are strewn with leaves; all day a haze Spreads o'er the land a glimmering veil; At eve the lone wind lifts a wail, And, nearing midnight, comes the rain And taps each dripping window pane; And in the barn, at dawn, a flail Beats, and a wain Pulls, apple-laden, to its rail. Sleep carpets all its rooms, whose doors And windows look on misty moors, And on a marsh where wade and pipe The wild duck and the long-billed snipe; And over which the House beholds The Morn come, wrapped in ghostly golds; And Day retire, in wild estate Of Storm—that folds His couch with purple, glaring hate. At dusk the moors disgorge the moon Like some enormous egg; the loon Screams somewhere, like a soul that's lost; And everywhere a smell of frost And sodden flowers and fruits and leaves Makes mute the heart; a cricket grieves; And one small window, seen afar, Beneath vined eaves, Gleams o'er the marsh like some bright star. And there it sits and dreams its dreams, The soul, that is a part, it seems, Of this old house, unto whose door Couriers come riding evermore, Splashed with the leagues of clay and wet— They bring strange news, that none may let, Of days long past and days to be— Days men forget, And days no man shall ever see. THE SPECKLED TROUT. With rod and line I took a way That led me through the gossip trees, Where all the forest was asway With hurry of the running breeze. I took my hat off to a flower That nodded welcome as I passed, And, pelted by a morning shower, Unto its heart a bee held fast. A head of gold one great weed tossed, And leaned to look when I went by; And where the brook the roadway crossed The daisy kept on me its eye. And when I stooped to bathe my face, And seat me at a great tree's foot, I heard the stream say, “Mark the place, And undermine it rock and root.” And o'er the whirling water there A dragonfly its shuttle plied, Where wild a fern let down its hair, And leaned to see the water's pride: A speckled trout—the spotted elf, Whom I had come so far to see, Stretched out above a rocky shelf, A shadow sleeping mockingly. And I have sat here half the day Regarding it. It has not stirred. I hear the running water say: “He does not know the magic word, “The word that changes everything, And brings all Nature to his hand; That makes of this great trout a king, And opes the way to Faeryland.” THE TWILIGHT WITCH. The Twilight Witch comes with her stars And strews them through the blue, And breathes below the sunset bars A breath of meadow-rue; She trails her veil across the skies, And mutters to the trees; Then in the weeds with firefly eyes She wakes the Mysteries. The Twilight Witch, with elf and fay, Is creeping down the Slumber-Way. Sleep, my dearest, sleep. The Twilight Witch, with crescent moon, Stoops on the wooded hill; She answers to the owlet's croon, And to the whippoorwill; She bends above the reedy pool And wakes the drowsy frog, And with the toadstool, dim and cool, Rims gray the old dead log. The Twilight Witch comes stealing down To take you off to Slumber-Town— Sleep, my dearest, sleep. The Twilight Witch with windy tread Has entered in the room; She creeps around your trundle-bed, And whispers in the gloom; She says, “I brought my steed along, My fairy steed of gleams, To bear you like a breath of song Into the Land of Dreams. I am the Witch, who takes your hand And leads you off to Faeryland, The far-off Land of Sleep.” THE GRAY WOOD. The gray wood stood, Windy and whistling, with its winter dream; Its leafy hood, Tossed at its feet, shuffled into the stream. Across its breast Was drawn a band of crimson and of gold, While in the west The sunset's sullen fires, in rage, grew cold. It gave a cry, Then tossed its arms and let its huge head sink, As 'thwart the sky The wild-geese drew their harrow, black as ink. Then up and down It moved its shaggy shoulders, and was still; Slipped on a gown Of mist and sat there, dimly, on the hill. Till, silver bright, Out of the east there came a lamp of fire; And in its light It breathed again, and doffed its gray attire. But all night long, Wringing its hands, I heard it wail its love, Weird, wild with wrong, Unto the Moon that moved cold-eyed above. Then, nearing dawn, I heard a dripping and looked forth to see— The moon was gone, And wood and sky were weeping wearily. DOPPLEGÄNGER. Oh, I went down the old creek, the cold creek, the creek of other days, And on the way I met a ghost, pale in the moonlight's rays, The ghost of one, a little boy, with whom my heart still plays. He looked at me, he nodded me, he beckoned with his pole, To follow him where oft he'd gone to that old fishing-hole, In checker of the shade and shine beneath the old beech bole. The old hole, the dark hole, wherein we marked the gleam Of minnows streaking, silvery rose, and in its deeps a dream Of something gone forever down the glimmer of the stream. The old hole, the deep hole, o'er which we watched the flash Of bronze and brass of dragonflies, and listened for the splash Of frogs that leapt from lilied banks when round them we would dash. He stood beside me there again, with fishing-pole and line, And looked into my eyes and said, “The fishing will be fine!” And bade me follow down the stream and placed his hand in mine. But it was strange; I could not speak, however I might try, While all my heart choked up with tears, and I could only sigh And whisper to myself, “Ah, God! if I could only die!” He laughed at me, he beckoned me, but I—I stood wide-eyed; A spell was on my soul, I knew, that kept me from his side, A spell that held me back from him—my boyhood that had died. 'Twas there beside the old creek, the cold creek, the creek of long gone-by; I stood upon its banks awhile when stars were in the sky, And, oh, I met and walked with him, the child that once was I! THE AMERICAN CUCKOO. I. Hark to the beat Of strident-humming insects in the heat! The pale-pink soapwort leans its anxious ears Against the Summer, listening for the rain; And where the vervain, like a face, appears, With eyes a-strain, To see the Wind, there is a voice that nears, Whispering of storm again. II. It says, “The way Was long and hot o'er fields of corn and hay, And orchards, strewn with ruined fruit, that smelled Of drouth; and vineyards where the filmy blue Of grapes hung bubbles, hornet-stung, unswelled; And gardens too, Where worms were busy and huge spiders held Sway in the webs they drew. III. “So when I reached A hollow of these hills, where woods had pleached A cave to rest in, there I lay me down And slept, until upon a bough there cried A voice, that said, 'Awake! the fields are brown With drouth, and all the creeks and springs are dried. Put on thy gown Of clouds, fringed blue with rain, and seek outside Welcome from farm and town. IV. “'Go! take the road Into the world on which the sun has glowed Fiercely for days, withering up the land; And, trailing wet along the dusty lane, Cover the sun's face with thy cooling hand; And sweep thy train Of moisture over all, and take thy stand By Fever's window pane. V. “‘'Till he shall see His reign is over, and glad flower and tree Laugh; and the cattle in the fields rejoice.— Wake from thy sleep, thou sluggard! rise and go Into the land and slay Heat's locust voice! Let rivers flow, And then above the sunset's beauty poise The glory of thy bow!’” VI. It was a bird, God's messenger, the cuckoo, that I heard. The wind arose, put on its cloak and came— And every flower, that leaned an ear and heard, Danced; and the skies put off their garb of flame, Shouting a word Of blessing, 'mid which, calling its own name, Rejoiced a jubilant bird. BEAUTY. Through pools of feldspar heav'n, above which lies One cloud's flamingo wing, the Inca, Day, Wades downward to his death; along his way Run little ripples of the sunset skies; And every stepping-stone of mist he tries With Midas foot, transforms its stony gray To burning gold; until, with one red ray, He sinks, and o'er him, stars, like bubbles, rise. So should all beauty pass; in rich accord With its surroundings; touching earth till all Conform to it as an accessory; Transferring to its features the regard Of its own dreams, through which the spiritual At last attains its immortality. SPIRITS OF THE AIR. All immaterial beauty, night and storm, And wind and light, assume a different splendor To such as see with the mind's eye and render Worship to Nature of invisible form; The sunset is a cauldron, where a charm Is brewed; and dusk, a mighty Witch of Endor, Busy with mystery; evoking slender Dream-spirits of the stars that round her swarm. Who has not walked with such, not felt the air Of their swift passage, on the wind from far, And followed footsteps heard within the heart, Shall never feel strange fingers in his hair, Lifting his soul into some farthest star, Nor of his dreams become immortal part. THE PURPLE FLOWER. There is a flower that blooms for ill or good Within the grove of Life. Its stalk is frail Yet strong, and bends to every passing gale, That breathes or blusters through the solitude. Some call it “Doubt-and-Dream,” and “red as blood” Its bloom; and others, when their efforts fail, Name it “Despair-and-Die,” and call it pale: For unto each 'tis differently imbued. And yet the flower, fashioned like a star, Is neither white nor crimson, but deep blue; Its name is “Hope and Wait.” The color-blind But see it otherwise, and, seeing, mar Its attributes, from which it takes its hue According to man's attitude of mind. THE WIND OF SPRING. A wind, that smelled of honey and dew, Out of the gates of the Morning drew, And over the clover meadows blew. It called to the bird on its bough, “Awake! Breathe of my breath, and fill the brake With joy of your song for its sweetness' sake.” And the bird sat up on its bough and sang 'Till the leaves peeped out and for rapture sprang, And all the aisles of the orchard rang. And its mate came singing, and straightway they Started to build on the topmost spray Of the apple tree; and sang all day. And the wind, to the boughs of the apple-tree, Spoke a word: “Now, listen to me! Open your eyes, so you may see!” And at its word, without ado, The little buds crowded the brown bark through, And took great joy of their own bright hue. And the glad wind kissed them and farther fled, And found on the earth a violet bed, And stooped and whispered: “Lift your head! “Wake! for Love, you know, is near— The Love that the Earth holds very dear. Here is a jewel for each one's ear.” And straight there sparkled a drop of dew In every violet's ear of blue, To greet young Love as his feet passed through. And Love, who was early up and out, Heard the bustle and laugh and shout, And wondered what 'twas all about. And the Wind cried, “Come and follow me; The Earth is waiting with blossom and bee For you to walk 'neath the orchard tree.” And Love came wondering, starry-eyed, Like a little child, down the green hillside, And before him went the Wind who cried: “Come, birds, and bees, and butterflies; And, blossoms, look with all your eyes! This is the Love that never dies!” THE MAY MOON. Dusk lifts high an opal-tinted Chalice brimmed with pearly wine; And upon a salver, minted Of the sunset, lets it shine Deep within a golden shrine, Showing there a moony line. In its light, on owlet pinions, Witchcraft takes her drowsy flight; And Enchantment with her minions Of the dew and glowworm-light, Leads her pageant through the night Over every vale and height. In her train, as by it dances, Lo, again a Dream I knew In my youth, before me glances Dimly in the moon and dew, Dancing back, O Heart, to you, Elfin-like, through rose and rue. MIRACLES. Ripple on ripple, from the east, The golden stream of morning runs; The dark world doffs its grays and duns; And high o'erhead Night's robes are creased With azure—deep as Solomon's When he sat throned at feast. And glittering as David when He rode to battle, brazen-helmed, And prayed his God and overwhelmed His foes and flamed among his men, The sun comes forth—a king, proud-realmed, Who takes his throne again. One last long spear of golden-gray The Twilight lifts, then lays aside; And one white star, that tries to hide Its flower there, reveals a ray; Where, like to Ruth, dark, dewy-eyed, Dusk goes her glimmering way. Then like the state—which went before Queen Sheba, when, with footsteps slow, She paced the wise King's portico— Eastward a light grows, more and more; And then, a goddess, face aglow, The moon, at Heaven's door. THE WHARVES OF SLUMBER. Upon the wharves of Slumber I watched the Ships of Dreams Come sailing in through mist and moon, With glowworm lights and gleams. Their holds were stuffed with plunder Of every land and time; With Ophir gold and gods of Greece, And scraps of ancient rhyme. Pastiles of Cretan henbane, And bales of Yemen silk, With cassia buds and sandalwood And Oman pearls like milk. And slaves, both men and women, Most fair to look upon, Whose chanting made the breeze to blow That swept the Dream Ships on. I had the pick and taking Of every cargo there— The spice and gold, the gems and slaves, And myrrh and pearls and vair. But while I stood debating What thing to take and choose, A voice cried, “Lo! the good ship Dawn Draws in across the dews.” And all the Dream Ships vanished, And left me wide awake To think of many, many things It had been mine to take. NIGHT MAGIC. In cobalt raiment, glinting With stars, beneath the pines Night walks, the forest printing With moonbeam-jeweled lines. Within her footsteps follow The dews and glowworm-gleams, And out of hill and hollow The murmur of hushed streams. The wildflowers there that dapple The road and kiss her feet, Lean over—rose, May-apple— And whisper something sweet. The wild bird, drowsy-dreaming, For her indulgence begs, And chants a song, in seeming, That echoes in its eggs. The bud, that nods unfolded, That holds its flower in mind, The mushroom, still unmolded, Crowd her dim steps behind. Agog to see who follow, In fernseed-twinkling shoes— The Fays, of hill and hollow, Who bring the flowers news Of Elfland and its towers, Where nothing ever dies, That knows these are not flowers, But Fairies in disguise. THE TEMPLE OF NIGHT. Columns of crystal lazulite The stormy vapors pile, Building a temple, vast, where Night, Clothed like a queen in cloudy white, On her dark face a smile, Moves down a Titan aisle. A robe of twice-dyed byssus drifts Around her manifold, As in her hands the moon she lifts, Her beauty glimmering starry gifts Of clustered pearl and gold, King Chaos gave of old. Around her troops a spirit-train, Transparent as the air; Peris and Afrites of the rain, And Deev and Jinn, who bind again The winds within their lair, With wildly flowing hair. The azure darkness of her face Assumes its old time charm; And, lo! again, in pearly lace, She walks; the moon—a crystal vase, Under one cloudy arm— Above the world's alarm. DAWN IN THE HILLS. Morn, like a hallelujah, storms the sky; The colors vie With one another—now in crimson dye, And now in golden—as if saints went by In clouds of glory with a mighty cry, The mists, like censer smoke, far-circling, fly. The Earth, in adoration, seems to kneel, And, worshiping, feel The awe and wonder that the heavens reveal; Above her, whom the rapture seems to heal, Splendor on splendor, wheel on burning wheel, The hues, like vast cathedral music, reel. Let us stand up, O Heart, and with one voice, Like Heaven, rejoice! Give praise to God! And, with the soul at poise, Forget awhile the little, mean annoys Of life! Its tools and all its foolish toys! And like the hills and heavens make Beauty our high choice! ABOVE THE HILLS. Twilight, and whippoorwill, and firefly, And then, Within the evening sky, One star, As if, afar, The Day would say, “Amen.” Now 'tis as if one lifted up a face And saw, Just for a moment's space, A presence, Or godlike essence, Passing, august, in awe. Dusk and the cricket and the moon; A bird Quavering a good-night tune— Or, no! The afterglow Speaking, low-breathed, a word. And now from somewhere in the hills there comes A sigh, As when the world succumbs To rest, Her weary breast Bidding all toil good-bye. And, from the soil, soft mists arise, and airs, It seems, That are Earth's dreams and prayers.— Ah, would That we, too, could Behold what 'tis she dreams! HOME-RETURN. Retired as Happiness, that holds The memory of a grief that's gone, The old house, like a man who folds His arms and faces toward the dawn, Stands there. Above it shines the star Of twilight; and around its gate Crowd many dreams, that naught may bar, And memories no time can mar, That our home-coming seem to wait. All is at peace. The land around Seems dreaming of divinities That once in childhood here we found; Or listening for the mysteries That whispered to our innocence, Of that which held a flower in thought, Or of a tree's experience, Or of the wind—in evidence Of dreams with which our minds were fraught. SUNSET CLOUDS. Taloned with lightning, in the west— Beneath whose breath the woods are bowed— Like some vast monster o'er its nest, There sweeps a cloud. And near and far a blackness falls, And Fear has no safe place to hide; Then echoing through the sky's huge halls There goes a stride. And then a bow of flame is bent; An arrow speeds, a burning wire; The cloud's great heart is torn and rent, And vomits fire. Its huge wings droop; its bosom bleeds; And, drowned in blood, it turns a fawn, Whom night, o'er blue and starry meads, Hunts on and on. CLOUDS. The sunset crowns itself with storm, From which a form Of demon darkness lifts an arm, And into sight a mountain heaves. A sun-ray touches it; it turns An isle that burns, Upon whose shores blaze giant ferns, 'Mid which the mortal eye perceives Plumed savages that launch long boats; Towards which there floats The wreck of Sindbad; and far motes, Like Rocs, that trail vermilion wings. The island sinks; and in its place An Afrite face Glares, rising from a genii vase Of stars and moon that Evening brings. A Dream treads dimly down the Hall Of Evenfall; And from the Night's gigantic wall Lets fall a scarf—a meteor. And then, behold! a mighty hand, That points a land Of mysteries, no eye has scanned, Where all Life's dreams and longings are. MATINS. What has the Dawn decided on?— Silver and fawn? Crimson and gold? Or a gown of lawn? Fold on fold, A mantle of mist around her drawn, As oft of old? Yesterday she went her way In a cloak of gray, Laced with rain; The like array She may don again, And, as a nun, with a face like clay, Pace hill and plain. Or, now suppose, as her way she goes, She wears a rose Of fire and dew, And a cloak, that blows, Of windy blue, And a cap of red, where a feather glows, A cloud or two. In no other wise you will see her rise— Her calm, clear eyes With joy elate; Before she tries High Heaven's gate, And down the Garden of the Skies Leads bright her state. And with her brings, oh, many things— A lark that sings, And gladness of heart; A flower that springs, And hope that's part Of the soul, that lends to life new wings. To soar and dart. THE WOOD GIRL. Sweet as an apple, rosy to the core, Her bosom shone, bared to the wind and sun; Musing she sat within the woodland hoar, Watching the wild creek run. She came upon me in the blossoming bush As might a Naiad by enchantment bound, Within a secret place of bloom and hush And dewy-dripping sound. But for the water, struggling with a stone, And breeze that searched, playing at hide and seek, That led me on, I never would have known— It was so lone a creek. But coming on her, so crepuscular, A glimmering girl, watching the water flow, She seemed a spirit from some other star, Or Nymph of long ago; Warden of minnows, shepherding their way; An unreality, a woodland dream She seemed; 'round whom the dragonflies, at play, Flashed many an elfin gleam. And now she leaned, listening a bubble-word That warned the thrush of some awaiting snake, That, hiding where the lonely water stirred, Lay with dull eyes awake. I watched her sitting, marveling at her face, A thought had touched, a dream that held her fast— A Naiad must have looked so in some place There in the old Greek past. And then I heard a note—a crystal sound— A thrush; the syrinx, seeming, of a Faun; A bramble snapped, and, quick, she turned around— And, lo, the spell was gone. And I was looking into wondering eyes— A little girl's, who rose and fled from me, Startled—as oft a Naiad, in surprise, Fled there in Arcady. AUTUMN EQUINOX. The clouds build black a giant hall, 'Round which the winds like madmen stride, Wild voices call from wall to wall, And earth is tossed from side to side. Fury and Madness meet at board, And sit at feast. Anon they rise, And thunderous sword smites thunderous sword, And each one by the other dies. Then suddenly a crimson hand Hurls wide a window, deep as doom, At which a Demon takes his stand, Burning within a burning room. The casement slowly closes down, And leaves a crack at which appear Two windy lights that glare and frown, And seem the bloodshot eyes of Fear. The sun is gone; and from the East There comes a dripping step and lamp— The wind's wild maunderings have ceased; The moon looks down on dew and damp. THE GIPSY. Deep in a wood I met a maid, Who had so wild an air Her beauty made my heart afraid, And filled me with despair. She wore a gown of gipsy dyes, That had a ragged look; The brown felicity of her eyes Was like a mountain brook. Around her hair, of raven hue, Was bound a gentian band, And from each tree the wild birds flew And fluttered to her hand. The crow sat cawing in the thorn As if it, too, would greet Her coming; and the winds of morn Made music for her feet. Barefooted down the wood she came Bearing a magic rod That left the leaves it touched aflame And aster-starred the sod. I spoke to her! “Tell who you are! So fair, so wild, so free! A being from some other star? Or wildwood witchery?” She smiled, and, passing, turned and said: “You do not know me then? Why, I am she, you long deemed dead, Autumn, returned again!” AUTUMN WINDS. What voices are these, Crying upon the hills? The Winds of Autumn Tossing and bowing the giant trees! Winds of Death, Jubilant, acclaiming, Filled with imperious portent, Declaring, demanding; Bidding the world put off its raiment of gold and of scarlet, Its mantle of pride and arrogance, And don the garments, ashen and sober, Of melancholy and repentance. I hear their voices, sonorous and mighty; In their music Shawms and cymbals and sackbuts vie with one another, Reeling and reverberating to the marching of sombre hosts, Giant-footed, funereal, To whose sorrow the forests yield themselves, Rocking to and fro Like mad fanatics that toss and whirl, Filled with the frenzy of death, The god they celebrate— Their stormy raiment whirling about them, They dance, lugubrious In their tattered mantles of leaves, Intoning their hearts' desolation. WHERE THE GRAY MISTS WHIRL. At night, in the lonely marsh, 'tis dread, When the autumn winds crowd 'round, And the gray mists whirl, like the shrouded dead, And the reeds make a ghostly sound. At every step the moisture springs, And down in the hollows a something sings, And something mutters and mocks o'erhead, And a footstep shuffles the ground. A boy, who crosses it, hugs his book, And runs like a hunted thing; The winds blow hollow from every nook— What noise is that they bring? A sound of digging; a phantom spade, That breaks the turf where a grave is made— “Ho! ho!” What child would dare to look, Hearing such laughter ring? Like evil faces the black stumps stare, And the pine-wood nods and leers; What's that? Dead grass? or human hair?— In the stream that now appears; And there where it drizzles and drones and dins, He knows it the demon-woman who spins, The fiend that turns her wild wheel there, In the rustling reeds he nears. On, on he hurries; some hurt, some harm Behind him doffs disguise; Before his feet black bubbles swarm, And scraps of music rise; It is the skeleton fiddler, ho! Who scrapes a devil's dance below— That twisted thing, with horrible arm, Who fiddles the coins from dead men's eyes. The marshland laughs; and a cry of dole Grows out of the laugh, like an evil threat; “Woe! woe!” it wails, “My poor, lost soul! Why does it wander yet?” At that he runs like a wounded deer. Is there no guardian angel near? He seems to see in the bog a hole Where his bones lie, moldering wet. At last the earth, firm earth, he feels! Thank God for the meadowlands! A lamp-lit window a house reveals— His home near the marsh that stands. He gasps and shudders and, standing still, Looks back at the swamp where it stretches chill, And shrinking, thinks of the Fear that steals There with its strangling hands. THE TREES AND THE WIND. Squirrels are chattering; Nuts are pattering; Let's go play In the woods to-day, Where the wind with the trees Is having his way. You can hear him say, “Take care of these As you do of the bees. Winter is coming; The partridge is drumming; And you must provide Snug rooms inside, Where the little gray jackets may house and hide. I will blow you down and break you in two If you don't do the thing I tell you to do!” And the trees look wise With their knot-hole eyes; And nod their heads in a knowing way As if to say, “We know our business; don't you worry. Leave us alone; don't be in a hurry. The squirrels are fed, And ready each bed Of leaves and moss.— Don't be so cross. You're always ready To fume and fuss And quarrel with us. Wish you were steady And willing as we To help the squirrel, the bird, and bee. But like some people we know, you see, In whom some worry is always brewing, You're better at talking, Sir, than doing.” LET US BE GLAD. O, Heart, be like the swallow! The bird whose blithe wings follow Spring over hill and hollow, Where leap the laughing flowers On violet leas and levels, Where Love his locks dishevels, In faun-like romps and revels, Wild-dancing with the Hours. Have done with care that borrows Old dread of far to-morrows; Have done with ancient sorrows, And fears that wail and weep; Despairs, that know no sleeping, And mem'ries, pale with weeping, And dreams, like shadows creeping, That shake the deeps of sleep. Learn promise of the flowers, The wind and sun and showers, That rainbow-span the hours, And vista wood and plain! Have done with what is dreary! With all that makes life weary! And hearken to the veery, Joy, singing in the rain. It sings, “Come! let in laughter, Dear Heart! and ever after, Though low your roof and rafter, And near your door a grave, Cast off regret and sorrow, And fear of what's to-morrow, And of good Earth go borrow Song, like my own, that's brave.” EFFORT. Effort is a fairy flower, That can ope the gate Of Life's grim and gloomy tower, Where the giant, Fate, Sits and holds, within his power, Fame, until shall strike the hour Work will liberate. THE FAËRY CHILD. A wild rose in the east, The rose of dawn; A splendor, like the feast Of Babylon. A Faëry Child I met Upon the way; Her hair with dew was wet And like a ray. She met me with a laugh, And then a word; While leaning on my staff I stood and heard: “Come, let me walk with you The morning way! Look in my eyes of blue— I am a Fay. “I leave no songs unsung; My heart is brave; Mankind I walk among To help and save. “The world may have beguiled— Give it no thought! Think on the Faëry Child It never caught. “Who weaves you roses; rare, An anadem; And far away from care Leads you 'mid them.” A butterfly, a bee, Now there, now here, She flew, then kisses three Gave eye and ear. And all the road that leads Into the glooms, Dark, overgrown with weeds, And marked with tombs, Glittered in golden wise, As if for trysts Of spirits of the skies, Clothed white in mists. And lo! I looked again— The child was gone; And down the dewy lane Came bright the dawn. THE HOUSE OF LIFE. To what old friend or foe Do I this hostel owe? This prison-house no presence knows but mine, Part bestial, part divine; This house wherein oft shine The lamps of dreams, the taper-glow Of thoughts; where ghosts glide to and fro— Old ghosts of hate and love, that sunder The silence with their breathings low; And, pale with wonder, Hope and Despair, with footsteps swift or slow, Pace in the darkness, its chief chamber under, And come and go Around the living clock that beats below. I fancy He who willed it, And out of silence drew This house of joy and rue, And with the darkness filled it, Thought, in His Heart's high essence, The wisest thing to do, For me as well as you, Was, in the walls He builded, To hide, somewhere, the clue That leads us to His presence Above the starry blue. FLOWERS. There are the flowers God gives to earth For each at birth: Heartsease, Rosemary, and Rue, That there in the Garden of Eden grew. The first for thoughts, whatever the way, Of life each day; From which shall spring the kindly seeds Of noble dreams and deathless deeds. The other two for memory Of life to be, That in the Garden of the Heart Grow into Love's own counterpart. THE CHILD IN THE HOUSE. I. When from the tower, like some big flower, The bell drops petals of the hour, That says, “It's getting late,” For nothing else on earth I care 'Cept wash my face and comb my hair, And hurry out to meet him there,— My father at the gate. It's—oh, how slow the hours go! How hard it is to wait! Till, drawing near, his step I hear, And up he grabs me, lifts me clear Above the garden gate. II. When, curved and white, a bugle bright, The moon makes magic of the night, A fairy trumpet calling, To me this seems what's very best— To kiss good-night and be undressed, And held against my mother's breast, Like Christmas snow a-falling. It's—oh, how fast the time goes past! The moments—how they leap! Till mother lays me down and sings A song, and, dreaming many things, She leaves me fast asleep. A POET. All things must die, grow old— We know this truth; But Love, that is better than gold, Shall outlast Youth. The Love we give to Art, That gives and gives Itself in what is part Of the soul that lives. In song, that shall outlast Marble and brass, And with a word hold fast All things that pass. Praise for the poet, then! Praise, that his rhyme Keeps young the world for men In spite of time. THE COMING OF WINTER. The hungry glitter of War's wolfish eyes Gleamed where the sunset dies; And then the Wind stopped at the door and laughed, Like one who tries To mask his purpose with designing craft. I knew 'twas Winter, stripping all of worth In the fair House of Earth— Of all its hoarded gold—and in its place Leaving lean Dearth To ape the skeleton, Famine, with her face. Balsam and pimpernel and all the pearls Of flowers that decked the curls Of Summer, lo! he seizes for his band Of vandal churls, Famine and Frost and Death, with icy hand. The panther-tawny hills crouch round and gaze, Gaunt-faced, at Heaven; or raise Huge claws of forest, stretching them to seize The fields of maize, Who, in their terror, seem to shrink and freeze. Some jewels Autumn dropped, when taking flight, Mark with a starry white The place she stood; and patches, red as fruit, Among the blight, Show, where she fled, the imprint of her foot. Here lies the testament Earth keeps apart, For Nature, in her heart; Come, bend and read of all her joy and pride, The beautiful art She builds with, and that Love has sanctified. In root and seed read of immortal things— Of what again she brings To life—dead Beauty, that no hand may bar; Of Song's wild wings And Color's palette, refuged now afar. Take hope! though now she speaks her thoughts in weeds Instead of flowers, and pleads In winds instead of birds, her book, though sealed, To him who reads, Bears messages of Spring—to be revealed. OLD CHRISTMAS. A Carol. I. The north wind blows the snow-clouds up, And through the snow the church bells ring, While Love outside stands caroling; So heap the fire and fill a cup, And let us welcome Christmas in, Who comes with goodly gifts for all, Good gifts of Heaven and Earth for all, To rich and poor with mirth for all, To rich and poor with mirth! Come, let us make sweet din, my dear, To welcome Christmas in, my dear, To welcome Christmas in; And underneath the mistletoe, Merrily, ho! merrily, ho! Merrily, ho! begin. II. The frost is keen on field and knoll, And lights are bright in church and hall; Come, gather, gather, one and all, And heap the fire and brew a bowl, And welcome in old Christmastime; Good will to all and peace to all, Good will and peace on Earth to all, Good will and joy and mirth to all, Good will and joy and mirth! Come, join in ringing rhyme, my dear, To welcome Christmastime, my dear, To welcome Christmastime! And where the holly wreathes the wall, Merrily all! merrily all! Join in some Christmas mime! III. The snow falls fast; the ways are white; The trees seem ghosts in winding sheets; Loud on the pane the tempest beats; Come, fill the house with candle-light, And welcome in good Christmas-cheer; Good cheer to all and love to all, Good cheer and love on Earth to all, Good cheer and love and mirth to all, Good cheer and love and mirth! Around the fir-tree here, my dear, Come, welcome in good cheer, my dear, Come, welcome in good cheer! Then round the board till break of day— Merrily, hey! merrily, hey! Give a rouse for the coming year! ON THE FARM. With his boyhood who would be? Back with friends so long apart! Friends!—an oldtime company— There to gossip, heart to heart, Of the days that used to be! With his boyhood who would be? Home again, without a care? Talking low and pleasantly Of the things Life has to dare In the days that are to be? There the boy that used to be Listens still with eyes like wine To the tales of Faëry, By the hearth-stone's crackling pine, As in days of used to be. With that boy who would not be Back upon the road that leads To the house beneath the tree, Where Youth dreamed of mighty deeds In the days of used to be? Oh, my Heart! again to be Back upon the oldtime farm, Where Ambition gallantly Wooed Achievement; took her arm, Left the farm and poverty, And Content!—Ah me! to be Listening to the stories told 'Round the hearth's felicity, In the winter's snow and cold, While the wind roared in the tree! There was comfort!—Let it be! Gone the house with open door! Gone the peace and—poverty! And the friends we knew of yore In the days of used to be! My old Heart, come, let it be! Let us seek some place to hide Far away from memory, And the dreams that still abide— Dreams of days that used to be. THE MAGICIAN That old Magician, Fall, steps in and cries Before the curtain of the sunset skies: At which a gate unlatches, And, red-cloaked to the chin, The Day, in shreds, he matches, Of leopard-colored skin, Goes out, and Night comes in, A moon-ray 'mid his patches. Now East, now West he summons up a form, That buttons close with stars a coat of storm: Dim caps of purple asters, And vests of iron-weeds, The fields puts on; and, masters, Blowing faint cricket-reeds, Pass where the old lane leads Into the mushroom-pastures. The grass greens, satined white with frost, A diamond carpet where his footsteps crossed: Dawn enters; ruby glitter Makes beautiful each trunk; And in the fungous litter Of woods, behold him sunk, With his own magic drunk, His bird-like mouth a-twitter. At noonday he assumes a new disguise, And on the hills a tawny panther lies: How changed the world he touches! The woodlands there reveal Red gold within their clutches, That hands, like leaves, conceal; Or jewels, that appeal Through forest rents, like smutches. Deep crimson was his garb as he went by, And on the mystic hills I heard him sigh: “Now all my arts are ended. Good-bye, sweet World, good-bye!” And toward the West he wended, Letting a feather fly, That to his cap of sky, One brilliant star pinned splendid. PANDORA'S BOX. Of fair Pandora and her Box, of old You've heard, perhaps. It is a story told Of how a woman brought into our world The Evils, that have grown so manifold. Sprung from that tribe of stones Deukalion hurled Down Mount Parnassus, wise Prometheus came, A Demigod, light-bringer, great of name, And greater far of heart; and in his soul There burned a fire, an all-consuming flame To benefit mankind. And so he stole Lightning from heaven; and, in hollow rods, Brought it to man. In punishment, the gods Dispatched to Earth, bearing a Box, like gold, A marvellous woman of celestial mold, Endowed with every grace and charm the Hours Bestow. Her name Pandora, whom the Powers, Olympian, meant for Epimetheus, The King, as wife, And it was Mercury, The cunning messenger of the gods, who brought Pandora and her Box to Earth, and wrought The world's undoing so. Now it was thus: Pandora, with the curiosity Native to women, wondering what could be Hidden within, and opening her Box to see, Without intending, set the Evils free. And thus it came that, crowned with blood and tears, War entered on our planet; Hate and Greed; Distrust and Envy, with their numerous breed; Famine and Pestilence; and all man fears For those he loves. Aware of what she'd done, Pandora, ere the last remaining one Escaped, clapped down the lid; not knowing who Remained a captive, whether bad or good, But one she thought of that infernal brood The gods had sent. How glad she was to find That it was Hope who had remained behind. But here's the reason, and I'll vow it's true: Hope is a woman, and the Evils' crew Being all men, to joy and beauty blind, In their wild eagerness to get away, Saw not Pandora. But of different kind, Being a woman, was Hope. She changed her mind, And so was caught, by making some delay, Admiring Pandora and the way Her gown was cut, or just her eyebrows, say. FINIS. Broad, silver discs the morning-glory drops Where, by the wayside, Autumn's pageant stops: An opening mussel-shell, that shows A streak of rose, The dawn is; ready to disclose The sun's red pearl above the hills' blue tops. The cold fires of the marigolds, that raise Their dripping torches by the garden ways; And salvia's chilly lamps, that burn Twixt flames of fern, That flicker from the terrace-urn, Seem fairy lanterns in the morning haze. Those clouds of crystal—look!—dissolving, seem Shallops that sail along a magic stream: And—was't the wind far-off you heard? Or elfin bird? Bidding you follow at its word Into another world of waking dream. It is a road on which new Beauty walks With every Commonplace of life: With stalks And stacks of grain; the rustling corn; Old shed and barn; And well-sweep standing so forlorn, Pointing you back to times of which it talks. So with the morning in your hearts and eyes, Suffer the world to take you with surprise, As when, in childhood, there, at first, It held and nursed Your wonder, ere with joy it burst Suddenly on you in a new disguise.
