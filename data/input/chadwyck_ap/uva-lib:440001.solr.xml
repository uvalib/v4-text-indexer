      <field name="fulltext">POEMS. THE PODESTA'S DAUGHTER; A DRAMATIC SKETCH. SCENE. Before and within the Gate of an Italian Church-Yard. Enter, as if from the wars, Duke Odo, Vincenzo, and a train of Men-at-arms. DUKE ODO. (Dismounting.) Hark you, Vincenzo; here will I dismount. Lead on Falcone to the castle. See He lack no provender nor barley-straw To ease his battered sides. Poor war-worn horse! When last we galloped past this church-yard gate, He was a colt, gamesome and hot of blood, Bearing against the bit until my arm Ached with his humors. Mark the old jade nowâ He knows we talk about himâa mere boy Might ride him bare-backed. Give my people note Of my approach, and tell them, for yourself, I will not look too strictly at my house: An absent lord trains careless servitors. I wish no bonfires lighted on the hills, No peaceful cannon roused to mimic wrath. Say, I have seen cities burn, and shouting ranks Of solid steel-clad footmen melt away Before a hundred pieces. Say, I come For rest, not jollity; and all I seek Is a calm welcome in their lighted eyes, And quiet murmurs that appear to come More from the heart than lips. Remember this. Yon old gray man who wanders through the tombs, Like Time among his spoils, is the first face, Of all the many strange ones we have passed, That I can call by name: I'll question him. See Marco's bed be soft. Let him be laid In the south turret, close beside my room: His wound aches cruelly. I must not forget The cry of love with which he dashed between My broken corslet and the Frenchman's spear. There, lead Falcone gently. Loose his girth; Unhook his curb. He ever fretted thus To part from me. VINCENZO. Lord! signor, here 's a task! First, lead this furious devil to his crib, Throttle the cannon, blow the bonfires out, Tell o'er another Iliad of your fightsâ A hundred battles to Achilles' one; Keep down such yells of joy as might outbrave The lungs of thunder; make a bed for Marcoâ A soft bed, bless me!âthe outrageous bear Would growl, like Cerberus, if he were laid Upon the cloudy couch of amorous Venus. ThenâWell, you say it, andâ DUKE ODO. You will obey; Bettering my plans with your inventive brain: Only there must be hinderances enough To heighten your good service. Fare you well! (Vincenzo and the train ride on towards the castle. Duke Odo enters the church-yard, and approaches the Podesta.) Good-even, signor! PODESTA. Welcome! An old man May fitly bid you welcome here; for I, Standing upon this grave-yard, sometimes feel Like an unseized inheritor who treads Hereditary acres, long kept back. I am next heir to this domain of death: Ere many days, I'll come with funeral pomp To claim my full possession. Welcome, then! No breach of hospitality shall prove My right unworthy. I was thinking thusâ Framing such salutation for a guestâ While you stood in the gateway. DUKE ODO. Merry sadness! PODESTA. Ay, signor, 't is as well as weeping mirth. Laughter and tears! their issue is the same; One treads upon the other's flying heels, Heaven takes up each into its steady breast, Life rolls along beyond the power of both, And either is soon over. DUKE ODO. True as sad. I pray you, Podestaâ PODESTA. How! You know my office? DUKE ODO. One at the gate informed me. PODESTA. Who were theyâ Those horsemen that went clattering up the street? Yon wall concealed them. DUKE ODO. Servants of the castle. PODESTA. What a rude stir the lazy varlets made! 'T is now all play with them. The duke 's abroad, Battering down castles, while malicious time Is busy with his own. He'll find neglect Makes as sad breaches as his cannon-balls. The whole world rots together, men and things; That 's comforting to mortals. DUKE ODO. How the graves Have thickened here! PODESTA. Ay, truly; and should man Consent to leave these landmarks of the dead Stand a few centuries, he would make his home Within the peopled cities of decay; And the bewildered swain, furrowing the fields, Would drive his plough zig-zag between the stones In sowing-time. DUKE ODO. This consecrated ground, Within my memory, was an open field. Here I have seen the golden heads of grain Shaken together in an autumn gust; Where yon ambitious marble lifts its pile Of sculptured trophies, I have seen the peasant, With hearty, laughing labor, strike his spade To found the May-pole. Glancing eyes and feet, Timed to the lute and rattling castanet, Figures of rustic grace and rustic strength, Gaudy with flaring ribbons, I have seen Whirled in a transient frenzy round and round That festal tree. Where is the ripened grain? Yonder the spade was struck, with heavier heart, For other purposes; and other sounds Than May-day dance and music have been heard Around the crusted sculptures of that tomb. Alas! the very flowers which twined the pole Have turned to marble; colorless and sad They stiffen round yon column, and appear Such flowers as winter, in a jealous mood, Might breed upon the bosom of his snows, In mockery of spring. Where are the forms Of maiden beauty and of manly power That crushed the tender grass beneath their feet? Sleep they in their own footsteps? Does the grass Grow over them secure? The votive wreath, Hanging upon the headstone of this grave, Perchance conceals a name which one time passed From lip to lip like cheering news; the eyes Of young and old grew bright with heart-born ease, To hear her foot-fall on the cottage-floor; And some, no doubt, burned with a warmer fire That smouldered shyly, and went out unseenâ An inner torture. Let me raise the garland. âGiulia,â and nothing more. Whose grave is this? PODESTA. My daughter's.âHeaven protect your life! how pale, How very pale you turn! DUKE ODO. What, I?âIndeed?â Well, well, I am a soldier, and my wounds Will twinge sometimes. Besides, I felt a shock Recoil upon me, at my sudden burst Into your sacred grief. Pray pardon me.â Whose tomb is that?âyonder great, haughty work, That seems to rise, like purse-puffed insolence, Among the humbler grave-stones, crying, âSee, Even in death I keep my wonted state!â PODESTA. Signor, you wrong the dead. The clay beneath Asked only to be tombed in open ground, Where the deep sky might stretch above his head, The bright flowers grow, and the south breezes bring A noise of running waters, and a gush Of drowsy murmurs, rustling through the trees, Forever round him. 'T was his fancy. He Shuddered with horror when the thought would come Of his ancestral crypts, where daylight turned Into an oozy dampness, worse than night. âHow shall I lie with patience all the years Earth has in store for her, beneath a place At which my dullest instincts cower with fear? Lay me beneath the sun,â he ever said. Age has its toys, like childhood; this was his. So, when he died, through superstitious dreadâ But more through loveâwith smothered discontent, They laid him there, and piled that pompous massâ Which wrongs the spirit of his last requestâ High over him. That tomb is old Duke Odo's. DUKE ODO. Heaven rest his soul! PODESTA. Amen! My Giulia loved himâ Though she had little reasonâto the last. DUKE ODO. How long has she been dead? PODESTA. Whyâlet me see Since young Count Odo buckled on his armsâ He is the duke now, but I still forgetâ Is nigh a score of years: my daughter died A twelvemonth from the day he journeyed hence. O, weary time! And Ugo, too, is dead; Daughter and son are lying side by side: The fruit has fallen, but the old trunk stands, Forlorn and barren, rooted yet in life. 'T is a long story; would you hear it all? Past griefs are garrulous, and slighted age Is pleased to listen to its own thin voice. Sit there on Giulia's graveâthe sod is freshâ I'll find a seat on Ugo's. DUKE ODO. Nay, nay, signor; A maiden's grave is of choice sanctity: I'll stand and listen. PODESTA. Please yourself; I'll sit. This tale could not be told to every ear;â Though, after all, 't is a mere history Of how a maiden lived, how loved, how died: A simple matter, such as gossips vex Our sleepy ears with round a winter's fire. Yet, for all this, a sympathetic heart, Like that you seem to own, is only fit To hold the pure distilment of such tears As early sorrow sheds. Shall I go on? Or do I blunder in my thought of you? DUKE ODO. Of me! O, heaven! (Aside.) No, no. PODESTA. Well, let me think. On her twelfth birthday my child, Giuliaâ I now may say it, she is dead so longâ Was fairer than the rose she loved so much, White as the lily were her virgin thoughts, Her pride as humble as the violet; Her fancies trained as easily as the vine That loves a strong support to grow around, And grows not upward, if not upward held: So all her pliant nature leaned upon Me and her brother, Ugo. Sweeter far Than rose or lily, violet or vine, Though they could gather all their charms in one, Was the united being of my child, Just as she stepped beyond her childish ways, And lightly trod the paths of womanhood. Only there was this one defect in herâ If a half beauty may be called defectâ She was too rare, too airy, too refined, Too much of essence, and too little flesh, For the rude struggles of rough-handed earth. Even her very life seemed bound to her By frailer tenures than belong to us. There was no compact between heaven and earth Regarding her. She had no term to live, No time to die. Within her life and death Seemed ever striving for the mastery; And she on either smiled with equal cheer. She was a product of her native air, Born from the breath of flowers, the dews of night, The balm of morning, the melodious strains That haunt our twilight, waning with the moon. Each unsubstantial thing took form in her; Even her country's sun had shot its fire Through all her nature, and burnt deeply down Into her soul:âHere was the curse of all! Count Odoâmark the contrastâso we called, Through ancient courtesy, the old duke's sonâ Came from the Roman breed of Italy. A hundred CÃ¦sars poured their royal blood Through his full veins. He was both flint and fire; Haughty and headlong, shy, imperious, Tender, disdainful, tearful, full of frowns; Cold as the ice on Ãtna's wintry brow, And hotter than its flame. All these by turns. A mystery to his tutors and to meâ Yet some have said his father fathomed himâ A mystery to my daughter, but a charm Deeper than magic. Him my daughter loved. DUKE ODO. Loved! Are you sane? PODESTA. The thing seems strange enough, That love should draw my tender flutterer Around this jetting flame; but so it was. She loved so truly, and she flew so nearâ But I forestall the end. DUKE ODO. O, misery! [Aside.] PODESTA. My functions drew me to the castle oft, Thither sometimes my daughter went with me; And I have noticed how young Odo's eyes Would light her up the stairway, lead her on From room to room, through hall and corridor, Showing her wonders, which were stale to him, With a new strangeness. For familiar things, Beneath her eyes, grew glorified to him; And woke a strain of boyish eloquence, Dressed with high thoughts and fluent images, That sometimes made him wonder at himself, Who had been blind so long to every charm Which her admiring fancy gave his home. Often I caught them standing rapt before Some barbarous portrait, grim with early artâ A Gorgon, to a nicely-balanced eye, That scarcely hinted at humanity; Yet they would crown it with the port of Jove, Make every wrinkle an heroic scar, And light that garbage of forgotten times With such a legendary halo, as would add Another lustre to the Golden Book. At first the children pleased me; many a laugh, That reddened them, I owed their young romance. But the time sped, and Giulia ripened too, Yet would not deem herself the less a child; And when I clad me for the castle, she Would deck herself in her most childish gear, And lay her hand in mine, and tranquilly Look for the kindness in my eyes. She called Odo her playfellowââThe little boy Who showed the pictures, and the blazoned books, The glittering armor and the oaken screen, Grotesque with wry-faced purgatorial shapes Twisted through all its leaves and knotted vines; And the grand, solemn window, rich with forms Of showy saints in holiday array Of green, gold, red, orange, and violet, With the pale Christ, who towered above them all, Dropping a ruby splendor from his side.â She told how âOdoâsilly child!âwould try To catch the window's glare upon her neck, Or her round arms;â and how âthe flatterer vowed The gleam upon her temple seemed to pale Beside the native color of her cheek.â Prattle like this enticed me to her wish, Though cooler reason shook his threatening hand, And counselled flat denial. Till at length Ugo, my son, stung by the village taunts Which the duke's menials had set going round, Grew sad and moody with an inward shame, That soon ran over in a wrathful stream Of most unfilial censure. âLook you, sir,ââ Beating his sword-hilt with his furious hand, Till blade and scabbard rang like clashing brandsâ âThis never shall be said! By Mary's tears, I'll cleave the next bold slanderer to the beard! And you, sirâyou who are the cause of itâ Look that your house be stainless. Breed no trulls For your liege lord; or, if you needs must pimp, Look further from your home!â Here was a strait! The partial justice of his hot rebuke Pardoned its disrespect, and sealed my lips Against reproaches: so I stammered out, âUgo, you rave.â âRave! only look to it, Or I may rave in action!â Down the hall, Black as a thunder-cloud, he swept along, Darkening the way before him. I awoke. The shameful fear stood imminent; even now Might be an age too late. But, though delayed, Duty must be no reckoner of time; An act good once is good forever. So, When Giulia sought me for the usual walk, I put her tears and her aside together; Not sternly, kindly, but inflexibly. Then all at once that rapid sorcerer, The human heart, lit a new light within her. Still as life may be, flushed from brow to breast With modest scarlet, by my side she paused, Tracing the mazes of bewildered thoughts. I turned and left her; yet whene'er I stopped, And cast a backward glance, fixed as before, Her eyes inverted on her inner self, And all her senses idle, Giulia stood, Seeming her own excelling counterfeit. Some strange thing stirred within her, that was plain; So I, with just the sapience of our race, Set my poor wits to reasoning down my fears. Half up the hill, Count Odo, like a stag Lured by the mimicked bleating of his doe, Burst from the bushes, and before me stood With such a wonder as the antlered king Must feel before the hunter. Not a word Nor sign of greeting did he make to me: One flash of his dark eyes along the pathâ A look which crossed my person as if I Were rock, or tree, or mere transparent airâ And then his haughty nature towered aloft, Magnificent as sunrise, calm as fate. Back through the thicket, deigning not to part The netted branches with his hand, he strode, Wrapped in the grandeur of his boundless pride. But other shapes his refluent passion took Ere his heart settled; for the servants said The house became a bedlam. In his wrath He slashed the pictures which poor Giulia loved, Tore up the missals, hacked the carvÃ©d screen; And with his impious hand, sheer through the glass Of the great windowâthrough the very Christâ Hurled a great oaken settle, overweight For two stout yeomen. Said the old duke naught? Yes, merely this:ââLet all the pictures hang, Spread out the books, cover the screen no more, Let heaven have entrance through the broken panes; These wrecks shall be Count Odo's monumentsâ The guide-posts pointing him to better things.â And he was wise. Ugo seemed pleased a while; For Giulia was dumb about the castle. I went and came, but never saw my child Standing upon our threshold for my hand, As in days past; and when Count Odo's name Came up at table, not a word from her, Who once would leap, like lightning, at that sound, And bear it off triumphant from our lips, Ringing his praises till her listeners tired. Only, at times, I caught a shy, quick glance Of bashful cunning glittering in her eyes, As covertly, under her downcast brows, She shot them round her. Her familiar cares, The usual duties of our small abode, Were duly ordered. Her accustomed walks, At morn and evening, through the forest path, Whereon she sowed her little charities Among the woodmen, and reaped golden stores Of grateful smiles, were taken as of old. Sometimes, indeed, I marked a peevish haste When aught delayed her, and a curt rebuff When I or Ugo proffered company; And sometimes from these walks she would return With something heavy at her heart, a grief That often rose to her convulsÃ©d lips, And then dropped backward to her heart again. I counted this a shadow, cast on her By the distressful sights of poverty Within the forest; and I talked at large, In the smooth, flowing phrases of the richâ When their world-wide philanthropy unlocks The liberal mouth, and seals the pocket up: In good round sentences I held discourse On the huge evils of our social state, And theorized, and drew fine instances, Until the starving beggar at my door Was clean forgotten. I cajoled the poor, I flattered them, I called them God's own care; Asked how the ravens fed. The smitten rock, The quails and manna, were rare figures: thus I shifted all the burden on the Lord, And felt the lighter. I have changed since then. My daughter listened; but, at times, I feared Her mind was far away, and all my words Buzzed in her ears, like a crone's spinning-wheel, That only chimes in with her vagrant thoughts, Unheard until the slighted threads divide, And startle her with silence. Giulia, thus, Would rise with something like a guilty pang, And busy her about the household work, Leaving my words unquestioned. So things went, Till generous autumn shook his jolly torch Around the land, and seared the rusty grass, And scorched the trees, and shook their fruitage down, And piled the dripping wains with purple grapes, And turned the year into a jubilee. Then Ugo in all sadness came to me, Flushed with the chase, yet redder dyed with shame, And in the pauses of his sighs told this: A wounded boar, flying before his spear, Forsook the closer covert of the wood, And, mad with terror, harrowed through the glades, Trailing his life behind him. Towards the town, Followed by Ugo and his baying hounds, The forest ruffian sped; but when the dogs Laid their hot muzzles to his straining flank, Into the open road he plunged amain, And scoured the peaceful pathway. Naught availed; His shadow kept not closer than the pack. His strength gave way, and Ugo's crusted spear Again was busy in his bristling side; When, swerving from a blow, with sudden dart He cleared the road, drove through a copse of oaks, And Ugo heard a woman scream. O joy! O sorrow! turning what we take as joy Into thy own sad likeness, how is man Balanced between ye! And what heart may say âThis thing is pleasure,â till its fleeting sense Be past and gone forever? Ugo stood, As if Medusa stared him in the face, Breast-high amid the coppice; and beheld Beneath a patriarchal oak Count Odo stand, With one strong hand upholding Giulia, While in the other flashed his wary brand, Cutting and thrusting at the desperate boar. DUKE ODO. I passed that spot, threading the forest path, An isle of greensward in a sea of leaves; âHere,â cried I, gazing on a stricken oak Whose mouldering remnants told of greatness gone,â âHere the avenging hand of God has struck, In lightning and in thunder reaching down! Yon ghastly culprit, lopped of every limb, His bark curled upward in a hundred scrolls, His fruitless acorns filled with barren dust, Points to a crime as clearly advertised As if a herald blew it to the wind.â My thought was just; two hearts were here betrayed While heaven was near them. But did Ugo leave These hapless children to the raging beast? PODESTA. Help was not needed. Ugo's hunter eye Saw in that hand a weapon overmatch For a bayed boar, without the hounds that hung Still tugging at the monster's brindled haunch: So, undiscovered, from the wood he turned, And bore the heavy secret home to me. Why rage did not o'ercome him in that hour, Why he, in wonted fury, did not slay The two together, is heaven's mystery. Shameâloathful, cruel, degrading, abject shameâ That quite unmanned him, this alone was his; No thought of vengeance. âShe may yet be pure,â Said Ugo; and the misery of a thought That dared suppose her other bowed his head, Crimson with meaning, to his outstretched palm. âIf she is not, Count Odo lives one hour;â And he glanced sideways at the horologe. Soon Giulia came; our fears might breathe a while. She heard with patience, and replied with tears, Heightening her fault, and taking Odo's blame. âThe guilt is mine,â she said; âI met him still: I staid not to be wooed, I went for it. I knew it to be wicked, but I bore The crime for its strange sweetness. Woe is me! That sin has bounties, while poor virtue starves.â I reasoned with her, setting love aside, That young Count Odo never could be hers; I showed the gulf between our wide estates; I said a dukedom could not wed a plot Of narrow acres; and I raised a fear Of dismal vengeance, from the old duke's hand, Upon my head. Count Odo, even he, Treated with justice merely, must endure Some direful grief. At this she blanched and shook. I balanced chances with the nicest art: âWhat if the duke consent, would Odo tooâ That hot, proud boy, who from his regal height Looks, like an eagle, down upon the worldâ Would heâha! ha!âlead such a bride as youâ A new Giraldaâto the altar-stone? Why, child, the pathway between home and church Would show more perils than the Cretan maze.â Then I advised her. âDaughter, be content With heaven's appointment; humbly walk the ground, Nor fly your fancies where you cannot follow; He is as far above you as the stars.â This she believed; naught was too high for him, Nothing too low for her, compared with him. But when I named the danger of such loves, How reason can be melted in the glow Of tempted passion; when I almost spoke In broad, blunt terms, as Ugo spoke to meâ So hard it was to make my meaning clearâ All the proud innocence of woman's soul Bounded aloft in dreadful majesty; And such indignant eloquence outburst, At the gross taunt, that I, by helpless signs, Was glad to beg her mercy. Well, the end Of this long tossing to and fro of words Was that my daughter, bowing to my will With that obedience she had ever shown, Promised to shun Count Odo from that hour. She kept her faith; though Odo came by day With missions from the castle that outsummed His several hairs, and were of less respect; Though, in the evening, I have seen his form Skirting the roadside where my daughter took Her silent walk with Ugo; though the night, From nocturns unto cock-crow, could not rest For the unceasing tinkle of his lute, And such faint scraps of doleful melody As he might venture with his trembling voice. Now a new fear began. His father's eyes Could not have missed Count Odo's altered ways; And soon dread proof was given of what a man, Good in all else, would forfeit to uphold The perilled lustre of his heritage. Ugo and Giulia, in a lonesome place, By a masked ruffian were assailed; and though Both mask and sweeping cloak gave Ugo odds Against the villain, there was stirring work, And wounds on both sides. Had not Giulia's voice, Shrieking in terror at the bloody sight, Prevailed more surely than brave Ugo's sword, Heaven knows what purpose might have been achieved. The vintage came, with it the festival; And, strange to say, Duke Odo left his books, To throw a chilling stiffness on the dance With his unusual presence. How my heart Shrank into nothing, when the aged duke, Tottering along the greensward, slowly came Before my daughter, and, with gallant words, Lightly among the dancers led my child. âUgo,â I whispered, âin the name of heaven, Stand near your sisterâhear the duke's discourseâ Perhaps he'll traffic in his son's behalf. That girl is doomed past saving!â Ugo said, âLet him but trade with me; I'll name a price To stagger his whole dukedom!â By and by, With smiles and nods and gentle courtesies, The duke returned to me. I almost snatched My startled daughter from his outstretched hand; And as the rustics cheered him to his horse, Through the confusion, on the wings of fear, I fled with Giulia; nor till bolt and bar Rang in their sockets, and I saw the spear And rusted sword I bore a while in Spain, Felt I the safer. Ugo came behind: He had heard nothing but the common talk 'Twixt high and humble;âquestions from the duke, And meek replies from Giulia. Once, indeed, He wheeled his ponderous learning slowly round To bear upon her knowledge; and seemed pleased To find she knew this planet is a sphere, Gold not a salt, and spirit not a substance; That nature's movements are through various laws, Diverse, and yet harmonious. But when she, Radiant with faith, proclaimed the central light, Without which reason were a helpless drudge, From which, and to which, all creation flows, And called it God,âah! there her soul had flown A league beyond his books; and from that thought The fool and the philosopher might start On equal ground. The duke was still a while. Then they talked o'er the poets:âPetrarch's love, And Laura's coyness, Tasso's holy war, And the stupendous Florentine. Just here The duke's smiles grew most fatherly, and here The dance was ended. âSaw you not,â said Ugo, âCount Odo join his father near the wood?â âIn good faith, no!â That question had upset My growing confidence. âSome plot is hereâ Some plot to be outplotted.â âHave her wedâ Ay, wed her to a clod, a slave, a beastâ To anything that can be made a groom; But keep her honest!â Ugo shouted forth. âA wise thought! Call your sister.â Giulia came. A little hope was fluttering in her heart, And warming one small spot on either cheek; That died away and never woke again, At my first sentence. âMarry!ââshe was firmâ âNot all that cowards fearânot all the pangs This groaning earth has borne since man left Edenâ Not all the cheating baits of fruitful senseâ Ambition's crown, toil's gain, fame's tainted breathâ Not all the spirit dreams of future blissâ No, nor the dictate of the holy churchâ The Pope's commandment, barbed with every ill That may be thundered from Saint Peter's chairâ Should fright, bribe, master, or so far corrupt The heart which God assigned her to keep pure!â She spoke this with her virgin eyes aflame, Blazing like Mars when he has clomb the sky, And looks down hotly from his sovereign height. I talked to her until the daylight wore, And evening lent its pathos to my words, Of what a daughter owes a parent's loveâ And I had been both parents joined in one; Of the great blessing which her mother laid Upon her infant's forehead, as she stood Upon the verge of Paradise, and saw, Forward and backward, heaven and earth at once. Would she be false to that? Move saintly eyes; And wet the golden floor of heaven with tears? I showed the duke's omnipotent command; The long and sweeping arm of potentates; The feeble shield of justice, when the voice Of poor, oppressed humanity is drowned In the loud roar of an impending doom. I made my gray hairs plead to her. I talked Of Ugo's blighted prospect, and the fate Which hung above us, sure to fall at last; Talked till my passion worked me into tears, And she gave wayânot slowly, all at once, With desperate haste. âDo with me what you will; But, O! in pity, get me to my grave As soon as may be. Life is wearying me; I would have rest from that which is within,â Said Giulia; and her shaking hand she laid, With a low, plaintive sob, upon her heart. I offered comfort. âYou shall not be wedââ âNo, by the saints!â roared Ugo, bursting through A flood of running tears. âOnly, my child, We'll meet their arts with arts. We'll gossip round That thou hast been betrothed. Some village beauâ Florio, thy cousin, will be proud of itâ Shall be a frequent suitor at my house; And he shall be thy company to massâ He'll spread thy cushion with a tender care, I warrant me!â and then I tried to laugh. âWhy, here 's a plot to found a play upon!â Thou didst like Florio.â âI shall hate him now,â Giulia replied; and her eyes glared at me With steely lustre, a blank outer light. âGive me but time. Just lead the duke astray Until I put my goods in proper trim, And we will fly the country, and his wrath, If nothing better offer.â Giulia raised The hollow spectre of a long-lost smile, And went her way. DUKE ODO. There was a murder done! PODESTA. It may be, signor; but my acts were squared, Both to my daughter's interest and the duke's, As well as my poor judgment would allow. DUKE ODO. Forgive my comment, and resume the tale. PODESTA. The rumored marriage reached Count Odo's ears. 'T was said, at first, he doubted; but his pride, Now he was older, and held firmer rein Above his passions, did not vent itself In chilling looks and following agonies: The pictures, books, screen, window, well had taught Their storied lesson. Marble calmness now, A mien that never altered with the times, Was his high state. But when the rumor grew A settled matter, and the people talked Of Florio and Giulia in one breath, Coupling their names as if they could not part, Count Odo kindled. In a forest-path He came on Florio. Face to face they stood. Florio in terror, and the scornful eyes Of Odo ranging him from head to foot. He spoke at last: âFlorio,ââhis voice was soft As the south windââFlorio, the world has said You are betrothed to Giulia; is it true?â Then the habitual lie was stammered forth. A while Count Odo's hand upon his sword Hung, like a mountain pard upon the spring, And the long veins went twisting through his neck, Swollen with torture; but some power within Wrested the clenched hand sharply from the sword, And his face calmed, and a most lordly smile Lit up his features, as he cried aloud, In strong, firm accents, as a martyr mightâ âGod bless you, Florio!â and burst in tears. 'T was the old fight twixt heaven and hell renewed, And, as of old, the battle-field was pitched Within the heart of man. Count Odo left Ere Florio could catch his scattered thoughts. On the next day a blare of trumpets woke The drowsy village, in scarce time to see The rearward horsemen of a warlike band Vanish within the forest. Some one said, âThat is Count Odo riding to the wars.â The wars have gone against us: since that day Thousands of hostile spears have ever lain Between Count Odo and his distant home. Sometimes for years in cities he was pent, Sometimes in adverse battles he engaged, Sometimes he skirmished through a long retreat, Hanging between the enemy's flushed van And the down-hearted soldiers of our rear; But never has a rumor of his nameâ For the foe barred direct intelligenceâ Reached us uncoupled from the words of praise. His father diedâ DUKE ODO. And knew not the deceit? PODESTA. How could he know? He died before my child, Pining, 't was whispered, for his absent son. Within a month poor Giulia followed him. I can recall the time as yesterday. A low fog lay upon the sodden land, And on my spirits; from the sluggish clouds, That trailed their ragged skirts along the hills, Thick, moody showers were falling now and then; And when they ceased, the poplars, drop by drop, Kept their sad chime awake upon the roof. Since Odo left us, Giulia had walked Her birth-place like a stranger. All the world, Its sights of beauty clustering round her feet, And all the mystery that hung above In the deep blue of heaven, seemed alien now; Their power and their significance were gone. The sun burnt out before her like a torch Before a blind girl, and within her sight The brightest moon was blurred by dim eclipse. She seemed forever lost in solemn thoughts: Yet when we questioned what she mused upon, âNothing,â she said, and I believed it true; For strongest grief is thoughtless, and retains Only a stupid sense of pain, no form, Or else we should go mad. Ugo, the while, Softened his nature to a woman's ways, And through the house he went, with silent speed, Forestalling Giulia in her wonted cares; Or in the garden-walk some flower she loved, In happier times, he planted full of bloom, And smiled to see her bending o'er the bush, Even with her vacant eyes: but I have marked, When thus her memory stirred, the flower was wet With other drops than morning's. As the year Rounded to winter, Giulia's cheek assumed A kindred color with the falling leaf, And her eyes brightened, and her thin white hands Grew thinner yet, her footstep lost its spring, And life seemed beating a slow-paced retreat From all its outposts. Just before the dayâ The irksome, dismal dayâof which I spoke, She looked as if her frame had suddenly Crumbled away beneath her, though its life Still haunted round her heart. She knew her state, And called us to her. âFather, first to you, I have no blame, nothing but thanks to give, And dying blessings. Ugo, so to you, Who bore the wayward tricks of my disease With so much kindness, such unfaltering love!ââ God bless her, she was patient as a saint!â âI do not ask the motives of your acts; For, since you chose them, they must be the best, I have one word to leave behind meâhark! I loved Count Odo, and I die for it. This ring, which slides about my finger so, He gave me onceâpray bury it with me. But I beseech youâay, you promise me Before I ask it; that is very kindâ If Odo should return, to make him know That I by deed, or word, or sign, or thought, Was never false to him. And tell him, too, Into the grave, with this one pledge of love, I go rejoicing; and he'll see it shine Upon my finger thus in Paradise. Odo, dear OdoâfatherâbrotherâGod, Have mercy on me!â And she closed her eyes, Shutting the world forever from her sight.â Soldier, you weep! DUKE ODO. Weep! am I stone, old man? O shallow reason! O deep heart of youth! What fearful issue has your conflict wrought! O father, blinder than the burrowing mole, To trust the mere deductions of your brain Before the holy instincts of that love Which, like a second revelation, God Has founded on our nature! O, false pride! Dark, sensual demon, that would rather writhe An age of agony than ope thy lipsâ Curse to thyself, and curse to thy possessorâ O, hadst thou slept one moment, what a flood Of golden sunshine happy love had poured Upon the desert darkness of two hearts! Old man, old man, it is a fearful thing To know what narrow mists, what threads of will, Divide a life of full, contented bliss From years of starved and utter misery; How near our guideless feet may be to one, Yet choose the other! Had a bare distrust Of your presuming wisdom crossed your mindâ Had Odo come to you with candid heart, And interchanged frank questions and repliesâ She who is mouldering here might still have bloomed To fragrant ripeness, and we fools, who stand Watering the relics of our own misdeeds, Might not be mourners. Woe to us, blind men, We knit the meshes that ensnare ourselves! Now hear your story closed by other lips. Who was the masked assassin of your child?â Count Odo, mad with the romantic wish To rescue Giulia: he it was who fought With stubborn Ugo, burning with a flame As high as that which lighted chivalry. Why came Duke Odo to the festival?â To prove your daughter worthy of his son; And found her so, beyond his topmost hope, And would have crowned her with a diadem, Holding the trinket honored! PODESTA. Gracious heaven! And who are you? DUKE ODO. Count Odo. Do not stir: From this grave hence, our paths lie far apart. [Exit.] THE IVORY CARVER. PROLOGUE. Three spirits, more than angels, met By an Arabian well-side, set Far in the wilderness, a place Hallowed by legendary grace. Here the hair-girded Baptist, John, Had thrown his wearied being down, And dreamed the grand prophetic lore Of what the future held in store; And here our patient Christ had knelt, After the baffled devil felt The terrors of his stern reproof, And, gazing through the rifted roof Of palm, had childlike sobbed and prayed His soul to calmness; here allayed The mortal thirst which raged within, Then turned, and all our world of sin Uplifted on his shoulders vast, And forth to toil, shame, death, he passed. A holy place the spirits chose For blest communion; but the woes Which follow sin had left a trace Of gloom on each angelic face:â Man's sin, the only grief which mars The joy of heaven, and sadly jars With its eternal harmony. One, chief among the spirits three, Grander than either, more sedate, Wore yet a look of hope elate With higher knowledge, larger trust In the long future; and the rust Of week-day toil with earthly things Stained and yet glorified his wings. âO, woe!â exclaimed the spirits twain, âTime comes, time goes, and still the train Of human sin keeps pace with it. The seasons change, the shadows flit Across the world, tides ebb and flow, But human guilt and human woe Are ever stirring in the blood, Are ever fixed at their full flood. Alas! alas! alas! even we, Poised in our calm eternity, Can only see new changes bring New forms of sin. The offering To death and hell is overstored, Heaven's poor; and yet the patient Lord Bears with mankind for mankind's sake. Shall never vengeful thunders wake Among earth's crashing hills, and bare The horrid lightning in his lair? Shall never the tornado sweep, The earthquake yawn, the rebel deep Scour the rich valleys, till the worldâ Back into early chaos hurled, With all her pomps and grandeurs rentâ Though barren, may be innocent?â âNever! The sign is set on high, 'Twixt sunny earth and weeping sky: One tittle of the spoken Word All hell can change not,â said the third. âPatience, dear brothers: ye who ask Quick, sweeping changes, set a task Beyond earth's power. She slowly draws, By due procession of her laws, Good out of evil. In the ground, Dark and ill-featured, seeds abound, Trees grow and blossom, and the flower Buds into fruit; yet, hour by hour, No change we mark, until the fruit Drops down full-ripened. Let us suit Our hopes to man. The child of clay Through his own nature wins his way; Moving by slow and homely means Towards the blind future, he but gleans Behind your wide intelligence, Leaping the stumbling bars of sense. Full armed with bounden wealth of thought Ye stand, and wonder at man's naught; Scorn his poor ways and sluggish rate, Rather than gratulate the state, Uncramped by narrow time and space, In which ye move. Ye face to face See all things as they are, he sees By dim reflection; for the lees Of earth have settled in his soul, And made a turbid current roll Between his mind and essence. Yet Even earthly natures may beget Grand ends, and common things be wrought To holiest uses. I in thought Have seen the capability Which lies within yon ivory:â This rough, black husk, charred by long age, Unmarked by man since, in his rage, A warring mammoth shed it. Lo! Whiter than heaven-sifted snow, Enclosed within its ugly mask Lies a world's wonder; and the task Of slow development shall be Man's labor and man's glory. See!â His foot-tip touched it; the rude bone Glowed through translucent, widely shone A morning lustre on the palm Which arched above it. All the calm Of the blue air was stirred again With ecstasy, as the low strain Of heavenly language rose once more. âGenius of man, immortal power, Of birth celestial, 't is thy hour! The doors of heaven wide open swing One moment. Hasten, ere thy wing Be locked within the lucid wall, And darkness for dull ages fall On earth and man, our common care!â While yet his accents filled the air Which rippled on the heavenly shore, A fourth intelligence, who bore The semblance of a flickering flame, Steep downward from the zenith came, Dazzling the path behind him. Still, Waiting the greater angel's will, He rested quivering. âSpirit, bear This ivory to the soul that dare Work out, through joy, and care, and pain, The thought which lies within the grain, Hid like a dim and clouded sun.â Speed thee!â He spoke, and it was done. THE IVORY CARVER. Silently sat the artist alone, Carving a Christ from the ivory bone. Little by little, with toil and pain, He won his way through the sightless grain, That held and yet hid the thing he sought, Till the work stood up, a growing thought. And all around him, unseen yet felt, A mystic presence forever dwelt, A formless spirit of subtle flame, The light of whose being went and came As the artist paused from work, or bent His whole heart to it with firm intent. Serenely the spirit towered on high, Fixing the blaze of his majesty Now north, now south, now east, now west: Wherever the moody shadows pressed Their cloudy blackness, and slyly sought To creep o'er the work the artist wrought, A steady wrath in the spirit's gaze Withered the skirts of the treacherous haze, And gloomily backward, fold on fold, The surging billows of darkness rolled. âHusband, why sit you ever alone, Carving your Christ from the ivory bone? O carve, I pray you, some fairy ships, Or rings for the weaning infant's lips, Or toys for yon princely boy who stands Knee-deep in the bloom of his father's lands, And waits for his idle thoughts to come; Or carve the sword-hilt, or merry drum, Or the flaring edge of a curious can, Fit for the lips of a bearded man; With vines and grapes in a cunning wreath, Where the peering satyrs wink beneath, And catch around quaintly-knotted stems At flying nymphs by their garment hems. And carve you another inner rim; Let girls hang over the goblet's brim, And dangle in wine their white foot-tips; While crouched on their palms, with pouting lips, Long-bearded Pan and his panting troop In the golden waves their faces stoop. O carve you something of solid worthâ Leave heaven to heaven, come, earth, to earth. Carve that thy hearth-stone may glimmer bright, And thy children laugh in dancing light.â Steadily answered the carver's lips, As he brushed from his brow the ivory chips;â While the presence grew with the rising sound, Spurning in grandeur the hollow ground, As if the breath on the carver's tongue Were fumes from some precious censer swung, That lifted the spirit's wingÃ©d soul To the heights where crystal planets roll Their choral anthems, and heaven's wide arch Is thrilled with the music of their march; And the faithless shades fled backward, dim From the wondrous light that lived in him.â Thus spake the carver,âhis words were few, Simple and meek, but he felt them true,â âI labor by day, I labor by night; The Master ordered, the work is right: Pray that He strengthen my feeble good; For much must be conquered, much withstood.â The artist labored, the labor sped, But a corpse lay in his bridal bed. Wearily worked the artist alone, As his tears ran down the ivory bone; And the presence lost its wonted glow, For its trembling heart was beating low, And the stealthy shadows came crawling in, With the silent tread of a flattered sin; Till the spirit fled to the Christ's own face, Like a hunted man to a place of grace; On the crown, the death-wrung eye, the tear, On the placid triumph, faint yet clear, That trembled around the mouth; and last On the fatal wound, its brightness passed, Shrinking low down in the horrid scar, And flickering there like a waning star. Slowly he labored with drooping head, For the artist's heart from his work had fled. He moaned, he muttered his lost one's name, He looked on the Christ with a look of shame; He called, he listened, no voice replied; He prayed her to come again, and chide The hateful work which his hand began; He promised ships, rings, toys, drinking-can. With level stare, through the thickening shade, Hither and thither his eye-balls strayed; But ne'er turned upward where, just above, A single star with a look of loveâ Divine, supernal, transcending senseâ Shone on him a splendor so intense That it half replaced the spirit's light, And thwarted the leaguering bands of night. Albeit he did not see the star, Sense is not a perfect pass nor bar To the mystic steps of love; his heart Felt a dumb stir through its chillest part, Felt a warm glow through its currents run, And knew, as the blind man knows the sun, That the night was past, and day was come. Bravely he bent o'er the ivory bone; But dull and dusk as a time-stained stone, From some mouldering sculptured aisle redeemed, The face of the slighted figure seemed; Till with heart and soul the artist cast His mind on the visionary past, When the face put on a purer hue, While again the wondrous presence grew; And the star's and the spirit's leaguÃ©d light Baffled the cunning of plotting night. âFather, why sit you ever alone, Carving this Christ from the ivory bone? Unlovely the figure, and passing grim With cramping tortures in every limb. A ghastly sight is the open wound, The wicked nails, and the sharp thorns bound O'er his heavy brow's crowned agony:â Fearful is Christ on the cursed tree!â âAnd see you nothing,â the artist said, âBut pain and death in this sacred head?â No triumph in the firm lip see you? No gracious promise which struggles through The half-closed lids; or no patient vow Sealed on the breadth of this mighty brow? Is my purpose idle, my labor vain?â They answered, âWe see but death and pain.â A little word had frozen his blood; All silent the woful artist stood, Turning the figure, now here, now there, With the stolid wonder of despair. Blankly his eye-balls he swept around, As one who wakes from a dream profound, And doubts the actual world he sees, Yet knows his visions but fantasies. âNothing?â the artist murmured again. âNothing,â they answered, âbut death and pain. O, father, come to the sunny heath, Where the violets nod in their own sweet breath, Where the roses, prodigal as fair, Squander their wealth on the thankless air, And all the glory of heaven and earth Meets in the hour of the lily's birth; Where the wheeling sky-larks upward throng, Chasing to heaven their morning song, Till its music fades from the listening ear, And only God's placid angels hear, As they hush their matin hymn, and all Serenely bend o'er the crystal wall. Hasten, dear father; there 's nothing there So dread as yon figure's dying stare; For sun and dew have a cunning way Of making the dullest thing look gay: There 's a wonder there in the coarsest stone, Which you cannot solve, yet still must own. Or, if it suit not your present mood, Come with us then to the darksome wood; Where cataracts talk to hoary trees Of the world in by-gone centuries, Ere the dew on Eden's hills had dried, Or its valleys lost their flowery pride; When earth beneath them, and heaven above, Were lulled in the nursing arms of love, And all God's creatures together grewâ A peace in the very air they drewâ Until sin burst nature's golden zone, And nature dwindled, and sin has grown. Come, father, there 's more of joy and good In our merry heath and solemn wood, Than the cold, dead hands of art can reach, Or its man-made canons darkly teach.â âChildren, dear children, it may not be: This work the Master hath set for me. All are not framed of the self-same clay; And some must labor, or none could play.â The bright flowers blossomed, the sky-larks sang, Deep in the forest the cataracts' clang Went up, unheard, in the silent sun; The childish ears, which their charms had won, And the tongues they woke, were there no moreâ They lay with the clay that breathed of yore. Up sprang the artist, and glared around, Dashing the Christ to the shuddering ground, With a cry whose piercing agony Made hell reÃ«cho with welcome glee, And all the trembling angels pale At the terrors of that human wail. âWas it for this I was singled out From the cringing, slavish, coward rout That blacken foul earth? Was it for this I bore the low sneer, the open hiss, The cross, the passion, the cheerless toilâ Which nothing fosters, and all things foilâ Only that Thou shouldst be glorified In the Saviour who sitteth by Thy side? And is this Thy servant's rich reward? Are these the blessings which Thou hast stored For the faithful few?âFrom sons of men Choose me for Thy chiefest rebel, then! Thrice cursed be the murderous, cheating thought That led me blindly! The hand that wrought This ivory fraud, thrice cursÃ©d be; For it slew the hearts that lived for me! Thrice cursed be the sight of heaven and earth! Thrice cursed be the womb that gave me birth! Thrice cursed be the blood on Calvary poured! Cursed, cursed be Thy hollow nameââThe word, That might have uttered unpardoned sin, Died on his shuddering lips; and within, Like a dead weight, on his palsied tongue The impious thought of his fury hung. Around, above, with one rapid stoop, The waiting shadows of evil swoop; And in and out, through the vast turmoil Of cloudy currents, that twist and coil In endless motion, unnumbered formsâ Countless as sands in the desert stormsâ Were drifted in masses indistinct; No limb to a neighboring shape seemed linked. Now a woful head came staring through, Then withered hands, where the head withdrew; Now a brow with wrathful furrows knit, Then the trailing hair of a girl would flit, Like a meteor, from the dusky throng That whirled with the cloudy tide along. One, more audacious than all the rest, Who wore his crimes, as a haughty crest Nodding its plumes o'er a conqueror proud, Stepped boldly forth from the writhing cloud, Stepped boldly forth on the solid land, And clutched the Christ with his sinful hand. Instant the shadows were rent in twain, Dashed here and there o'er the frighted plain, And the star burst blazing from above; Stern vengeance mixed with its holy love, As full on the brow of the child of hell, With the crash of a flaming battle-shell, The beams of the angry planet fell. Right boldly the startled demon gazed, And backward, with dauntless front upraisedâ Upon whose terrific waste still gloomed Hate unsubdued and wrath unconsumedâ He faced the star-beams, and slowly strode Into the depths of his drear abode. Motionless sat the artist alone, Fixing his eyes on the ivory bone, Yet seeing nothing. The vengeful star, As the routed shadows fled afar, Softened its lustre, and gently glanced On his torpid breast. As one entranced Stirs with dumb life, in the solid gloom Of some unhealthy, damp-dripping tomb; Feels his coffin-lid with groping hands, Or clutches the grave-clothes' tightened bands, And then with a murmur turns him o'er, Drowsily dozing to death once more: So seemed the artist. The star-beams brought A dim sensation, a vague half-thought, That glimmered a while around his brain, Then faded, and all was dark again. But still the warm, loving splendor shone; And close to the side of the greater one, Two stars, in their new-born freshness, came Down from the throne of mercy, a flame With all its brightness. A silvery trail Died out behind them in sparkles pale, As they wheeled within the lustrous sphere Of the elder star, and shot their clear Commingled rays o'er the abject clay, That prone, unmoving, and silent, lay, With a dull, cold load of stupid pain Pressed on his heart and his senseless brain. As the springtide sun, that sets aglow The tufted meadows with melting snow, And turns by degrees the icy hills To balmy vapors and fruitful rills, So shone the stars on the torpid man; Until, as the first hard tear-drop ran, A thought through his gloomy bosom stole. At once, with a shock of pain, the whole Broad human nature arose amazed, With all its guilt on its brow upraised. Ah, me! 't was a mournful sight, to see The three stars shining, so peacefully, On the raging breast of him who poured His puny wrath at our gracious Lord. A while, with stubborn and wilful might, The artist strove to drive from his sight The kindly look of the starry trine; Yet, turn as he might, some power divine Would soften his will, he knew not why, And draw to the light his troubled eye. Long, long he looked; till his heavy grief Of heart gushed forth, and a full relief Of balmy tear-drops fell, round on round, Like the blood which marks yet heals a wound. He staggered, he bowed his stubborn knee, He fixed his eyes on the shining three; And the tears so magnified his gaze, That the face of heaven seemed all ablaze With light and mercy. He knew the stars That looked through his earthly dungeon-bars.â âI see,â he shouted, âye live, ye live! Death is a phantom! O God, forgive!â Steadily worked the artist alone, Carving the Christ from the ivory bone. Again the bright presence shone around With a light more dazzling, more profound. Through day, through night, through fair, through foul, The artist wrought with a single soul; And when hand would tire, or eye grow dim, He looked at the stars that looked at him, Until power and vision both were given, And he carved the Christ by light from heaven. Under each cruel thorn-point he hid A world of grief, and each drooping lid Was closed round its mortal tears of pain; But the nostrils curved in proud disdain Of death and his feeble tyranny, And the mouth was calm with victory. High over all, the majestic brow Looked down on the storm which raged below, Big with the power and the god-like will That said to the sinking heartââBe still!â And it was still. For who once had looked On that mighty brow, saw not the crooked And veinÃ©d fingers that clutched the nails, Nor the fitful spasm that comes and fails In the dropping legs, nor the wide wound; O, no! the thorn-wreath seemed twisted round A victor's head, like a diadem, And each thorn-point bore a royal gem. Silently sat the artist alone; For the Christ was carved from the ivory bone. The presence bowed with a holy awe, And paled in the light of the thing it saw: But the three stars sang a single word, Faint and subdued, like a widowed bird That sings to her own sad heart alone, And feels that no creature hears her moan. The artist echoed their timid psalm, Bowing to earth, with palm clasped in palm; And, âPardon, pardon, pardon,â he prayed, As the Christ upon his heart he laid. âPardon, O, pardon!â the three stars sang: âPardon, O, pardon!â All heaven rang With dulcet sounds, as the angel throng Joined in the depths of the choral song, With harp, and viol, and timbrel sweet. âPardon, O, pardon!â the saints repeat, With shrouded faces and solemn close, As hearts remembering their human woes. And martyrs, who bore their fiery scars Like trophies gathered in long-past wars, Cried âPardon, pardon!â And heaven's wide hills, And fruitful valleys, and golden rills, And long, long levels of sunny sky, Were vibrant with living sympathy; And folded and gathered into one The waves of the multitudinous tone, Until, like a wingÃ©d thing that glows With the first joy of its wings, arose In pride of triumph the mighty sound, And circled the mercy-seat around; Till the glory grew, the sign was given, And another joy was born in heaven. EPILOGUE. Three priests from Saint Peter's church have come, To carry an ivory Saviour home. Long years of unceasing strategiesâ New bribes, new threats, and new treacheriesâ It cost our holy father; until The prior who held it at his willâ âCursed be his name!â say the brotherhood Of the house wherein the treasure stoodâ Lost all their wealth on a single cast, And the Pope secured the prize at last. How it was managed, heaven only knows; But by one thing's fall another grows: And though the prior was cursed, mayhap, In a year or two a cardinal's cap Covered more sins than that little slip, And bore more curses, from every lip, With as proud a grace to its lord's behoof As if the cloth were of Milan proof. Howbeit, I give the slander o'er. The three priests stand by the convent door, And the monks, with groans of wrath, essay To bring the Christ to the light of day. Three times they had nearly dropped their load:â All chance, perhaps; but the shoulders broad Of stout Father John came just in need, Though his oaths were a little late indeed. âIs this a matter,â said burly Johnâ His breath and his temper almost goneâ âTo bruise one's shoulder about? 'Ods blood! Bring the true image; or, by the rood! You shall feel the vengeance of the Pope!â âWhy, brothers, you did not think, I hope,â Said Father Francisâhis open eyes Bewildered with sorrowful surpriseâ âTo cheat an old connoisseur like me, With such a bold dash of villany. Full fifty better Christs I have seen Rotting away in the Madeleine. Here 's cause for penance! here 's much to tell!â Is this your ivory miracle?â âHush!â whispered young Anselm's saintly lips. âBut see the modelling about the hips,â Broke in sour Francis. âAnd only see,â Blustered John, boldly, âthe holy tree!â Of English oak! while the chips we own Are made from cedar of Lebanon. Either the Church or the artist lies:â Who doubts it?â Within his reddening eyes There burnt a general Auto-de-fe, For whomever might his words gainsay. Anselm waved slowly his small, white hand, And speech was hushed, as the little band Of priests and friars drew softly round, Like men who tread upon holy ground; For Anselm was half a saint at Rome. The general country for leagues would come To hear his preaching. His sermon o'er, The alms-box groaned with its golden store; And alone each thoughtful soul would go, With his happy features all aglow; As if bounteous heaven's transfiguring grace Were sown broadcast o'er each shining face, And each were revolving in his head The words which a parting angel said: So that young Anselm came nigh to be A saint ere he put off mortality. Why he was not a bishop, at least, Or something more than a common priest, Is a shrewd question we'll not press homeâ They don't make bishops of saints at Rome. Sometimes a bishop becomes a saint; But that is after the fleshy taint Has well worn off in the grave's decay: And anything can be made from clay; Saints, poets, heroes,âthe thing 's all oneâ A scratching of pens, and the work is done. Slowly round Anselm the listeners drew, Fixing their eyes on his eyes of blue. He mused, but spoke not. His spirit now Was lost in the wonder of the brow; Or chained to the grand victorious scorn About the nostril; or downward borne In the weight of agony and grief That loaded the tear-drops; or relief, Perchance, he sought in the steady smile Round the parted lips: But all the while No word he spoke, though his constant eye Blazed with the splendor of prophecy; As full on the ivory Christ he bent A look that o'ergathered all it sentâ A fruitful commerce of thoughts sublime, That burst earth's limits, and mocked at time. So long he looked, and such meaning grew Twixt the ivory and the eyes of blue, That the priests who saw do stoutly tell How the figure moved. âA miracle!â Shouted Father John, with hanging jaw;â â'Ods blood! and the first I ever saw.â âA miracle!â One clamorous cry Went up through the low, damp evening sky, From a score of gaping cowls, that hid More fear than grace beneath every lid; And the caverned hills, around the plain, Swelled with it, then cast it back againâ A hollow echo, a jeering shout, Which silenced the lips that gave it out. Then gently turned Anselm towards the priest, His great soul filled with a solemn feast Of thoughtful love; in the blest repose Which follows the spirit's higher throes, Aloud to the silent throng he spoke, Kindling as thought upon thought awoke. âO ye, who in midnight caverns dwell, While the ever-during miracle Of changing seasons goes through its round A stone-cast beyond your narrow bound;â Even though you will not or cannot see The marvel born in the growing tree, The opening flower, or the gracious sun That gives equal alms to every one: Shall ye be the first to raise a cry Of âmiracle!â if some passer by Venture within your hideous cell, Where the gleam of twilight never fell, With a flaring torch of smoky pine?â Shall ye call the light a thing divine, Because a mere sudden, curious chance Has worked on your own dull ignorance, And given you vision, and taught you lore That lay from the first at your very door? Must signs and wonders forever be Guides on the road to eternity? Unhood yourselves, and look round you, then, On earth, air, ocean, your fellow-men. Know that the miracle does not lie In the roar of jarring prodigy; But lapped in the everlasting law, Whose faithful issue last spring ye saw, When chill earth warmed in the vernal ray, The snow was melted, the ice gave way, When the grass rose trembling from the clod, And pointed its narrow leaf to God. Who, when this ivory was first revealed, Saw any marvel, plain or concealed, In the glorious sculpture? Nay, ye turned Your senseless shoulders, and boldly spurned The heavenly thing; till your failing sightâ Caught by a trick of the shifting lightâ Fancied some movement, or here, or thereâ A crooking finger, a waving hairâ When sudden awe on your weakness fell, And all cried as oneââA miracle!â O shallow sceptics! O seekers blind! The marvel is not the one ye find; It lies not in moving limb or head, Though the frame had writhed, the thorn-wounds bled, The sweet mouth spoken, tears dimmed the eyesâ No, not in these the true mystery lies; But in the grand irradiate whole, Warm with its fresh and immortal soul, Sealed with the seal of eternal youthâ God's presence revealed in simple truth! I tell you, here standing, this shall preach When Pope, priests, church, and the creed ye teach, Have passed, like the heathen dreams, away, And flowers take root in your haughty clay. When a stranger, on the Appian road, May ask where Saint Peter's ruins stood; And a simple hind, who tills the soil O'er Rome's foundations, may pause from toil, And say he knows not. Even then shall stand In the musing stranger's distant land, Sculptured from bases to pediments With all that studious art invents, A temple of marble veined with gold, Built only this precious Christ to hold. Air-spanning arches and columns broad, All stooping beneath their splendid loadâ Wide-vaulted chambers whose frescoes rare People the solemn religious air With heavenly synodsâand heavenly notes, Blown out from the organ's golden throats, Shall rise like a general voice, to tell Man's joy in yon ivory miracle. And daily within that holy fane Shall come a sin-stricken pilgrim train, From every country beneath the sun, To gaze on this image; and each one Shall loosen his burden of despair, And stride again to the blessed air With new power to do, new strength to bear. For here, in this sacred face, is met All that mortal ever suffered yet: All human weakness, all shame, all fear, Hang in the woe of yon trembling tear; And all the will, the valor, the power, That grapple and hold the adverse hour, Are throned like kings on yon fearless brow; And the vassal flesh shall cower and bow, As nature bows unto nature's laws!ââ Here Anselm's speech made a sudden pause. Lost in the grand passion at his heart, With flashing eyes, and lips wide apartâ As one whose full subject overbore, In torrents, the power to utter moreâ He stood all trembling. Like heavy clouds Moved by one wind, the friars in crowds Gloomily under their portal swam, In half-voice chanting a vesper psalm; And the priests were standing there alone With night, the Christ, and four stars that shoneâ Brighter and brighter as daylight fledâ Strangely together, just overhead. THE SONG OF THE EARTH. PRELUDE. CHORUS OF PLANETS. Hark to our voices, O mother of nations! Why art thou dim when thy sisters are radiant? Why veil'st thy face in a mantle of vapor, Gliding obscure through the depths of the night? Wake from thy lethargy! Hear'st thou our music, Harmonious, that reaches the confines of space? Join in our chorus, join in our jubilee, Make the day pine with thy far-piercing melodyâ Pine that his kingdom of blue sky and sunshine Never reÃ«choes such marvellous tones. No, thou art silent, O mystical sister, Silent and proud that thou bear'st on thy bosom The wonderful freight of the God-lighted soul.â We hear thee, we hear thee, beneath thy thick mantle, The war of the winds through thy leaf-laden forests, And round aisles of thy pillared and hill-piercing Caverns sonorous; hear the dread avalanche Torn from its quivering mountainous summit, RibbÃ©d with massy rocks, crested with pine-trees, Thundering enormous upon thy fair valleys; Hear the dull roar of thy mist-spouting cataracts; Hear the faint plash of thy salt seething billows, Lifting their heads multitudinous, or shoreward Climbing the cliffs that o'erhang them with trembling, And tossing their spray in exultant defiance Over the weed-bearded guardians of ocean. Sister, we listen; thy strains are enlinking, Melodiously blending to ravishing harmony; Clouds are departing, we see thee, we yearn to thee, Noblest of planets, creation's full glory! Bending we hearken, thou mother of nations, Hark to the sky-rending voice of humanity! SONG OF THE EARTH. O vex me not, ye ever-burning planets; Nor sister call me, ye who me afflict. I am unlike ye; ye may revelling sing, Careless and joyful, roaming sunlit ether, Urged with but one emotion, chaunting still Through lapsing time the purpose of your birth, Each with a several passion; but to me Are mixed emotions, vast extremes of feelingâ Now verdant in the fruitful smile of heaven, Now waste and blackened in the scowl of hell. Ye know me not, nor can ye sympathize With one like me, for wisdom is not yours. Ye sing for joy; but wisdom slowly comes From the close whispers of o'erburdened pain. I am alone in all the universe! To me is pain; I can distinguish sin; But ye with constant though unweeting glance Rain good or ill, and smile alike at both, Nor understand the mystery of your natures. To me is wisdomâwisdom bought with woe, Ages on ages passed, when first I strayed, With haughty scorn and self-reliant pride, From purity and God. For once like you God spoke me face to face, me soulless led From joy to joy; yet He was mysticalâ Too obvious for thoughtâI knew Him not. But now, through sin, I understand like Him The heart of things, the steep descents of guilt, And the high pinnacles of heaven-lit virtue. Bend down, ye stars, bend from your silver thrones, Ye joyful wanderers of ether bright; For I, soul-bearer of the universe, Would teach your ignorance with the lips of song! O Mercury, hot planet, burying deep Thy forehead in the sunlight, list to me! I groan beneath thy influence. Thou dost urge The myriad hands of labor, and with toil Dost mar my features; day by day dost work Thy steady changes on my ancient face, Till all the host of heaven blank wonder look, Nor know the fresh, primeval moulded form That rose from chaos, like the Aphrodite, Smiling through dews upon the first morn's sun. The leaf-crowned mountain's brows thou hurlest down Into the dusty valley, and dost still The free wild singing of the cleaving streams To murmurs dying lazily within The knotted roots of pool-engendered lilies, That sluggish nod above the slimy dams. All day the axe I hear rending through trunks, Moss-grown and reverend, of clustered oaks; All day the circling scythe sweeps off The ruddy bloom of vain-aspiring fields, Clipping to stubbles grim the vernal flowers. Thou portionest my meadows, and dost make Each fruitful slope a spot for sweaty toil. Thou tearest up my bosom; far within My golden veins the grimÃ©d miner's pick Startles the babbling echoes. Ancient rocks, My hardy bones, are rent with nitrous fire, To rear the marts, to bridge the leaping streams, Or to usurp the ocean's olden right, That selfish trade may dry-shod walk to power. The very ocean, grim, implacable, Thou loadest with the white-winged fleets of commerce, Crossing, like wheeling birds, each other's tracks; Until the burdened giant, restless grown, Bounds from his sleep, and in the stooping clouds Nods his white head, while splintered navies melt To scattered fragments in his sullen froth. Malignant star, I feel thy wicked power; My children's busy thoughts are full of thee: Thou 'st chilled the loving spirit in their hearts, And on their lips hast placed the selfish fingerâ They dare not know each other. All that is, All that God blessed my teeming bosom with, Is priced, and bartered; ay, the very worth Of man himself is weighed with senseless goldâ Therefore I hate thee, bright-browed wanderer! Daughter of the sober twilight, Lustrous planet, ever hanging In the mottled mists that welcome Coming morning, or at evening Peeping through the ruddy banners Of the clouds that wave a parting, From their high aÃ«rial summits, To the blazing god of dayâ 'T is for thee I raise my pÃ¦an, Steady-beaming Venus, kindler, In the stubborn hearts of mortals, Of the sole surviving passion That enlinks a lost existence With the dull and ruthless present. Far adown the brightening future, Prophetess, I see thee glancingâ See thee still amid the twilight Of the ages rolling onward, Promising to heart-sick mortals Triumph of thy gracious kingdom; When the hand of power shall weaken, And the wronger right the wrongÃ©d, And the pure, primeval Eden Shall again o'erspread with blossoms Sunny hill and shady valley. 'T is to thee my piny mountains Wave aloft their rustling branches; 'T is to thee my opening flowrets Send on high their luscious odors; 'T is to thee my leaping fountains Prattle through their misty breathings, And the bass of solemn ocean Chimes accordant in the chorus. Every fireside is thy altar Streaming up its holy incense; Every mated pair of mortals, Happily linked, are priest and priestess, Pouring to thee full libations From their over-brimming spirits. Clash the loud-resounding cymbals, Light the rosy torch of Hymen, Bands of white-robed youths and maidens Whirl aloft the votive myrtle! Raise the choral hymn to Venusâ Young-eyed Venus, ever youthful, Ever on true hearts bestowing Pleasures new that never pall! Brightest link 'tween man and heaven, Soul of virtue, life of goodness, Cheering light in pain and sorrow, Pole-star to the struggling voyager Wrecked on life's relentless billows, Fair reward of trampled sainthood, Beaming from the throne Eternal Lonely hope to sinful mankindâ Still among the mists of morning, Still among the clouds of evening, While the years drive ever onward, Hang thy crescent lamp of promise, Venus, blazing star of Love! O Mars, wide heaven is shuddering at the stride Of thy mailed foot, most terrible of planets! I see thee struggling with thy brazen front To look a glory from amid the crust Of guilty blood that dims thy haughty face; The curse of crime is on thee. Look, behold! See where thy frenzied votaries march! Hark to the brazen blare of the bugle, Hark to the rattling clatter of the drums, The measured tread of the steel-clad footmen! Hark to the laboring horses' breath, Painfully tugging the harnessed cannon; The shrill, sharp clink of the warrior's swords, As their chargers bound when the trumpets sound Their alarums through the echoing mountains! See the flashing of pennons and scarfs, Shaming the gorgeous blazon of evening, Rising and falling 'mid snowy plumes That dance like foam on the crested billows! Bright is the glitter of burnished steel, Stirring the clamor of martial music, The clank of arms has a witchery That wakes the blood in a youthful bosom. And who could tell from this pleasant show, That flaunts in the sun like a May-day festal, For what horrid rites are the silken flags, For what horrid use are the gleaming sabres, What change shall mar, when the battles join This marshalled pageant of shallow glory? For then the gilded flags shall be rent, The sabres rust with the blood of foemen, And the courteous knight shall howl like a wolf, When he scents the gory steam of battle. The orphan's curse is on thee, and the tears Of widowed matrons plead a fearful cause; Each thing my bosom bears, which thou hast touched, Is loud against thee. Flowers and trampled grass, And the long line of waste and barren fields, Erewhile o'erflowing with a sea of sweets, Look up all helpless to the pitying heavens, Showing thy bloody footprints in their wounds, And shrieking through their gaunt and leafless trees, That stand with imprecating arms outspread, They fiercely curse thee with their desolation. Each cheerless hearth-stone in the home of man, Where ruin grins, and rubs his bony palms, Demands its lost possessor. Thou hast hurled Man's placid reason from its rightful throne, And in its place reared savage force, to clip Debate and doubt with murder. Therefore, Mars, I sicken in thy angry glance, and loathe The dull red glitter of thy bloody spear. I know thy look, majestic Jupiter; I see thee moving through the stars of heaven Girt with thy train of ministering satellites. Proud planet, I confess thy influence: My heart grows big with gazing in thy face; Unwonted power pervades my eager frame; My bulk aspiring towers above itself, And restless pants to rush on acts sublime, At which the wondering stars might stand agaze, And the whole universe from end to end, Conscious of me, should tremble to its core. Spirit heroical, imperious passion, That sharply sets the pliant face of youth, That blinds the shrinking eyes of pallid fear, And plants the lion's heart in modest breastsâ I know that thou hast led, with regal port, The potent spirits of humanity Before the van of niggard time, and borne, With strides gigantic, man's advancing race From power to power; till, like a host of gods, They mock my elements, and drag the secrets Of my mysterious forces up to light, Giving them bounds determinate and strait, And of their natures, multiform and huge, Talking to children in familiar way. The hero's sword, the poet's golden string, The tome-illumining taper of the sage, Flash by thy influence; from thee alone, Ambitious planet, comes the marvellous power That in a cherub's glowing form can veil A heart as cold as Iceland, and exalt To deity the demon selfishness. O planet, mingle with thy chilling rays, That stream inspiring to the hero's soul, One beam of love for vast humanity, And thou art godlike. Must it ever be, That brightest flowers of action and idea Spring from the same dark soil of selfish lust? Must man receive the calculated gifts Of shrewd ambition's self-exalting hand, And blindly glorify an act at which The host of heaven grow red with thoughtful shame? Shall knowledge hasten with her sunny face, And weeping virtue lag upon the path? Shall man exultant boast advance of power, Nor see arise, at every onward stride, New forms of sin to shadow every truth? Roll on, roll on, in self-supported pride, Prodigious influence of the hero's soul; I feel thy strength, and tremble in thy glare! O, many-ringÃ©d Saturn, turn away The chilling terrors of thy baleful glance! Thy gloomy look is piercing to my heartâ I wither in thy power! My springs dry up, And shrink in horror to their rocky beds; The brooks, that whispered to the lily-bells All day the glory of their mountain homes, And kissed the dimples of the wanton rose, At the deed blushing to their pebbly strands, Cease their sweet merriment, and glide afraid Beneath the shelter of the twisted sedge. The opening bud shrinks back upon its shell, As if the north had puffed his frozen breath Full in its face. The billowing grain, and grass Rippling with windy furrows, stand becalmed; Nor through their roots, nor in their tiny veins, Bestirs the fruitful sap. The very trees, Broad, hardy sons of crags and sterile plains, That roared defiance to the winter's shout, And battled sternly through his cutting sleet, Droop in their myriad leaves; while nightly birds, That piped their shrilling treble to the moon, Hang silent from the boughs, and peer around, Awed by mysterious sympathy. From thee, From thee, dull planet, comes this lethargy That numbs in 'mid career meek nature's power, And stills the prattle of her plumÃ©d train. O icy Saturn, proud in ignorance, Father of sloth, dark deadening influence, That dims the eye to all that's beautiful, And twists the haughty lip with killing scorn For love and holinessâfrom thee alone Springs the cold, crushing power that presses down The infinite in man.âFrom thee, dull star, The cautious fear that checks the glowing heart, With sympathetic love, world-wide, o'erfreighted, And sends it panting back upon itself, To murmur in its narrow hermitage. The boldest hero staggers in thy frown, And drops his half-formed projects all aghast; The poet shrinks before thy phantom glare, Ere the first echo greets his timid song; The startled sage amid the embers hurls The gathered wisdom of a fruitful life. O, who may know from what bright pinnacles The mounting soul might look on coming time, Had all the marvellous thoughts of geniusâ Blasted to nothingness by thy cold sneerâ Burst through the bud and blossomed into fruit? Benumbing planet, on our system's skirt, Whirl from thy sphere, and round some lonely sun, Within whose light no souls their ordeal pass, Circle and frown amid thy frozen belts; For I am sick of thee, and stately man Shrinks to a pigmy in thy fearful stare! FINALE. CHORUS OF STARS. Heir of eternity, mother of souls, Let not thy knowledge betray thee to folly! Knowledge is proud, self-sufficient, and lone, Trusting, unguided, its steps in the darkness. Thine is the learning that mankind may win, Gleaned in the pathway between joy and sorrow; Ours is the wisdom that hallows the child, Fresh from the touch of his awful Creator, Dropped, like a star, on thy shadowy realm, Falling in splendor, but falling to darken. Ours is the simple religion of faith, The wisdom of trust in God who o'errules us; Thine is the complex misgivings of thought, Wrested to form by imperious reason. We are forever pursuing the light; Thou art forever astray in the darkness. Knowledge is restless, imperfect, and sad; Faith is serene, and completed, and joyful. Chide not the planets that rule o'er thy ways; They are God's creatures; nor, proud in thy reason, Vaunt that thou knowest His counsels and Him.â Boaster, though sitting in midst of the glory, Thou couldst not fathom the least of His thoughts Bow in humility, bow thy proud forehead, Circle thy form in a mantle of clouds, Hide from the glittering cohorts of evening, Wheeling in purity, singing in chorus; Howl in the depths of thy lone, barren mountains, Restlessly moan on the deserts of ocean, Wail o'er thy fall in the desolate forests, Lost star of paradise, straying alone! July, 1848. THE VISION OF THE GOBLET. Evoe Bacche! wine hath seized my soul; The fury of the jolly god is on! Reach me the mighty ancient bowl: Fill till the goblet weep, Fill till the rushing current sweep The dull, cold present to oblivion! Now swing amain the mystic beaker tall, And still to Bacchus breathe the potent spell; Rouse the red-visaged god from slumbers deep In green Arcadian dell! Swing till the ruby breakers rise and fall, Swing till the coursing bubbles leap Above their crystal wall! What gleams beneath the purple flood, Far down upon the nether rim, Glowing amid the vine's rich blood As through a sunset's misty film? 'T is Attica, mild Attica, that sleeps Embayed by heaven among her vine-grown hills; Mantled with flowers and glossy grass she lies, Smiling in all her rills; Palace and temple-crowned she keeps Her stately slumber 'neath the evening skies; While Venus, brooding in a feathery cloud, As in her nest the silver-breasted dove, Peeps now and then above her dusky shroud Upon the land of love. Hark! the wine-waves, dashing, splashing, Seem bacchantian cymbals clashing To the rumbling drum, And the shivering flutes' shrill singing, And the jingling tabors' ringing; While, anon, the hurly dying, Syrinx softly breathes her sighing From the warbling reed. Caught in the Satyr's wily snare, What throngs across the valley come; As whirling in the eddying stream Of music to the hills they speed, While upturned Attic foreheads gleam Amid their billowing hair! Reeling, staggering, on they fly, Wine in the blood and dizzy eye, Wine in every sinew burning, Onward still its minions spurning Over hill, through lushy meadow, Through the forest's glooming shadow, Hither, thither, without caring Where their guideless feet are bearing. Tossing aloft, with nods of drunken cheer, Mark old Silenus on his ass appear; Plashed is his hoary beard with purple wine, Daggled his silver locks, his reeking brows Crowned with the ivy and the twisted vine. Mark how the dotard leers, As through the maids he steers, And tries to summon love within his filmy eyne! Thick with the luscious grape His mumbled words escape, The barren echoes of his youthful vows. Lo! full-eyed Bacchus from triumphant war, Rich with the trophied Orient's boast, Goads through the crowd his flaming Indian car Before the Satyr host, That roaring straggle in their master's rear, Twirling the ivied thyrsus as they bound, And dance grotesque, and mingled laugh and jeer, And cloven foot-falls shake the springing ground. Around the hairy rout, with streaming hands, Athena's maidens whirl the dripping urn; Their floating vestures, loosed from jealous bands, Half hide, half show, what charms beneath them burn. There mellow Pan upon the Attic ear, Framed with a dainty sense for melody, Pours music from his pipe of knotted reeds, Lifting the ravished soul to that high sphere Where joy and pain contend for mastery. Now tittering glee the grinning Satyr breeds, Now flings the heart in tearful depths of woe, Now big-eyed fear the shrinking crowd appalls, Now to the blithesome dance the music calls; Then with full power, and long, triumphant flow Of swelling notes that shake the rooted soul, And rise and fall with ocean's measured roll, He lifts to Bacchus his resounding lay; Tabor and drum confess the potent sway, And join their muffled notes. With nodding heads and brandished arms, And flashing eyes, and swelling throats, That heave with song's advancing tides, The crowd obeys the cunning master's charms. A murmured hum athwart the listeners glides, While still the pipes their pealing notes prolong, Piercing the heavens with wild exultant shout, Till, maddened by fierce harmony, the throng From end to end in ecstasy bursts out, And thus to Bacchus pours its choral song. Joy, joy, with Bacchus and his Satyr train In triumph throbs our merry Grecian earth! Joy, joy, the golden time has come again, A god shall bless the vine's illustrious birth! Io, io, Bacche! O breezes, speed across the mellow lands, And bear his coming to the joyous vine; Make all the vineyards wave their leafy hands Upon the hills, to greet this pomp divine! Io, io, Bacche! O peaceful triumph, victory without tear, Or human cry, or drop of conquered blood, Save dew-beads bright, that on the vine appear, The choral shouts, the trampled grape's red flood! Io, io, Bacche! Shout, Hellas, shout! the lord of joy is come, Bearing the mortal Lethe in his hands, To make the wailing lips of sorrow dumb, To bind sad memory's eyes with rosy bands. Io, io, Bacche! Shout, Hellas, shout! he bears the soul of love, Within each glowing drop Promethean fire; The coldest maids beneath its power shall move, And bashful youths be bold with hot desire. Io, io, Bacche! Long may the ivy deck thy sculptured brows, Long may the goat upon thy altars bleed, Long may thy temples hear our tuneful vows, Chiming accordant to the vocal reed. Io, io, Bacche! Long may the hills and nodding forests move, Responsive echoing thy festal drum, Grief-scattering Bacchus, twice-born son of Joveâ Our hearts are singing, let our lips be dumb. Io, io, Bacche! ODE TO ENGLAND. O! days of shame! O! days of woe! Of helpless shame, of helpless woe! The times reveal thy nakedness, Thy utter weakness, deep distress. There is no help in all the land; Thy eyes may wander to and fro, Yet find no succor. Every hand Has weighed the guinea, poised the gold, Chaffered and bargained, bought and sold, Until the sinews, framed for war, Can grasp the sword and shield no more. Their trembling palms are stretched to thee; Purses are offered, heaping hoardsâ The plunder of the land and seaâ Are proffered, all too eagerly, But thou must look abroad for swords. These are the gods ye trusted in; For these ye crept from sin to sin; Made honor cheap, made station dear, Made wealth a lord, made truth a drudge, Made venal interest the sole judge Of principles as high and clear As heaven itself. With glittering pelf Ye gilt the coward, knave, and fool, Meted the earth out with a rule Of gold, weighed nations in your golden scales! And, surely, this law never failsâ What else may change, this law stands fastâ âThe golden standard is the thing To which the beggar, lord, and king, And all that 's earthly, come at last.â O, mighty gods! O, noble trust! They are your all; ye cannot look Back to the faith ye once forsook; The past is dry and worthless dust; Gold, gold is all! Ye cannot fill Your brains with legends vague and thin; Hang up your arms amidst their rust: These are the gods ye trusted in; They can deliver you, and will! O! bitter waking! mocking dream! The gilt has worn away, The idols are but clay, Their pride is overthrown, their glories only seem! The land is full of fear, Men pale at what they hear, The widowed matrons sob, the orphaned children cry; There 's desolation everywhere, there 's not one comfort nigh! The nations stand agaze, In dubious amaze, To see Britannia's threatening form, That loomed gigantic mid the splendid haze Through which they saw her towerâ As, at the morning hour, The spectral figure strides across her misty hillsâ Shrink to a pigmy when the storm Rends the delusive cloud, And shows her weak and bowed, A feeble crone that hides for shelter from her ills. O, mother of our race, can nothing break This leaden apathy of thine? Think of the long and glorious line Of heroes who beside the Stygian lake Hearken for news from thee! Apart their forms I see, With muffled heads and tristful faces bowedâ Heads once so high, faces so calm and proud! The Norman fire burns low In William's haughty heart; The mirth has passed away From CÅur de Lion's ample brow; In sorrowful dismay The warlike Edwards and the Henrys stand, Stung with a shameful smart; While the eighth Harry, with his close-clutched hand, Smothers the passion in his ireful soul; Or his fierce eye-balls roll Where his bold daughter beats her sharp foot-tip, And gnaws her quivering lip. While the stern, crownless king, who strode between Father and son, and put them both aside, With straight terrific glare, As a lion from his lair, Asks with his eyes such questions keen As his crowned brothers neither dare To answer nor abide. How shall he make reply, The shadow that draws nigh, The latest comer, the great Duke, Whose patient valor, blow by blow, Wrought at a Titan's overthrow, And gave his pride its first and last rebuke? What shall he say when this heroic band Catch at his welcome hand, And trembling, half in fear, Half in their eagerness to hear, âWhat of our England?â ask? Ah! shameful, shameful task! To tell to souls like these Of her languid golden ease, Of her tame, dull history! How she frowns upon the free, How she ogles tyranny; How with despots she coquets; How she swears, and then forgets; How she plays at fast and loose With right and gross abuse; How she fawns upon her foes, And lowers upon her friends; Growing weaker, day by day, In her mean and crooked way, Piling woes upon her woes, As tottering she goes Down the path where falsehood ends. Methinks I see the awful brow Of Cromwell wrinkle at the tale forlorn, See the hot flushes on his forehead glow, Hear his low growl of scorn! Is this the realm these souls bequeathed to you, That, with all its many faults, Its hasty strides and tardy halts, To the truth was ever true? O! shame not the noble dead, Who through storm and slaughter led, With toil, and care, and pain, Winning glory, grain by grain, Till no land that history knows With such unutterable splendor glows! Awake! the spirit yet survives To baffle fate and conquer foes! If not among your lords it lives, Your chartered governors, if they Have not the power to lead, away, Away with lords! and give the men Whom nature gives the right to sway, Who love their country with a fire That, for her darkness, burns the higherâ Give these the rule! Abase your ken, Look downward to your heart for those In whom your ancient life-blood flows, And let their souls aspire! Somewhere, I trust in God, remain, Untainted by the golden stain, Men worthy of an English sire; Bold men, who dare, in wrong's despite, Speak truth, and strike a blow for right; Men who have ever put their trust Neither in rank nor gold, Nor aught that 's bought and sold, But in high aims, and God the just! Seek through the land, On every hand, Rear up the strong, the feeble lop; Laugh at the star and civic fur, The blazoned shield and gartered kneeâ The gewgaws of man's infancy; And if the search be vain, Give it not o'er too suddenlyâ I swear the soul still lives in thee!â Down to thy lowest atoms drop, Down to the very dregs, and stir The People to the top! March, 1855. THE QUEEN'S TOUCH. AN INCIDENT IN THE EARLY LIFE OF H. C. M. ISABEL II. On a Good Friday, as it once befell, The gentle lady, royal Isabel, Stepped from her palace with a fair array Of Spanish nobles. Plumes, and banners gay, And lines of burnished halberds made a lane, Through which the sovereign and her glittering train Swept like a gorgeous cloud across the face Of some bright sunset. Even was her pace, And a deep calm dwelt in her steady eyes, August with queenly power, and counsel wise To sway a realm; yet round her playful lip The child still lingered, and a smile would slip, Like a stray sunbeam o'er a dimpled rose, When the crowd shouted, or an eager close Of loyal people broke the martial line, And stayed her progress. One could scarce incline Whether to call her queen or child; so bright And innocent a spirit lit the might Of awful sovereignty, as on she went Bearing the diadem of Charles unbentâ Ay, smiling under it, as if the weight Of empery heaven lightened to the date Of her few years. For surely heaven may bend In mercy to the merciful, and lend Its strength to her who for the weak can feel, As gracious Isabel. The traitor's steel; The storms that broke around her princely head, When they who should have shielded her, instead Of muttering plots and tempting her with guile, Turned from her side; the anarchy the while That rent her kingdom, and made Spain's great throne Rock as if startled by the earthquake's groanâ All these, and more, she dared, and could withstand, Because God led her by the trusting hand, And showed the mercy she has ever shown. You who look doubtfully, with sighs or sneers, Citing the history of her after years, Remember thisâand let the thought atone For many a weakness, many an error done Out of the lessons of her early days, When all conspired to lead her evil waysâ Her faults were taught, her virtues are her own. Across the flower-strewn way she slowly walked, Wondering at many things; anon, she talked To the grave minister who moved beside His youthful mistress with a haughty stride Of strained decorum. Curiously she asked Of this and that; and much the lord was tasked To answer all her questions, which did flow Like ripples on the shore,âere one could go Another leaped above it. For her state Was new to her, and not a rustic's mate Among the throng more marvelled at the sight, Nor drew from it a more sincere delight, Than royal Isabel. More pleased she seemed At the hoarse shouts, and at the love that beamed From the tanned faces of the common crowd, Than at the courtly whispers, or the proud Looks of fixed dignity. The beggar's rags Were dearer to her than the silken flags That coiled above her; and his vivas drowned The swell of music, and the ringing sound Of the saluting steel. And once she turned Full on a lord, while every feature burned With a new thought; and, pointing unto one Ill clad, indeed, yet with a face o'errun With honest love, said, laughing at the close, âWhy wear you purple, and he ragged clothes?â Much the Don talked about society, And laws, and customs, and how all agree To make one world. Although he talked the thing Clear to himself, and shaped a pretty ring Of binding words, no answering look he caught From the Queen's eyes; and when he gravely sought To draw a word of sympathetic cheer, Upon her cheek he marked a long, bright tear: So he passed on in silence, she in thought. At length the minster's arch above them bent, And through its gloom the shining courtiers went, Making strange light within that dusky pile. And all along the borders of the aisle Old chiefs and heroes in white grandeur slept Upon the tombs. Their marble faces kept A settled quiet, as they upward gazed Upon their arms and spoils, above them raised, Along the rafters, each in solemn ward. Some with their hands upon a sculptured sword, Some clasped in prayer, and others, full of grace, Crossed on their breasts. The courtiers' noisy pace Broke the long silence with a painful jar, Unmeet and alien. Trophies of old warâ Pennons blood-stained, torn flags, and banners, fell And rose again, o'er royal Isabel: As if the soul that fired her ancient strain Were roused, and all the chivalry of Spain Breathed in their hollow sepulchres beneath, And waved the banners with a mighty breath. Saint George's cross was shaken as with dread; The lilied silk of France shrank, as when spread O'er Pavia's bloody field; a second shame Thrilled the Dutch standards, as if Alva's name Were heard among them; the horse-tails of the Moor Streamed to the wind, as when they fled before The furious Cid; spears glittered, swords were stirred Within their scabbards; one in fancy heard The trumpets murmur, and a warlike peal Through the closed casquesââSaint Jago for Castile!â If she stepped on more proudly, it was not That Isabel herself was proud. The spot Of crimson on her forehead was a gleam Of the old glory, a reflected beam Cast from the trophies, that brought back the day When her sires' sceptre swept the world. A ray Of keenest sunshine through the aisles shot down, And blazed amid the jewels of her crown, Like a saint's aureole, as the Queen drew nigh The holy altar. With a gentle sigh The organ whispered through the incense-smoke, Trilling above her, like a lark awoke Some misty morning, till she touched the stair Of the high altar; when, with sudden blare, In one grand storm of music burst the whole Torrent of sound o'erhead, and roll on roll Crashed through the building, from its hundred throats Of shivering metal thundering forth the notes. Radiant with sunlight, wrapt in holy sound And fragrant vapors, that in spirals wound Up through the pillars of the choir, the Queen Paused, as in doubt, before a sable screen Upon the altar, and a courtier led, By a sweet look, beside herââSir,â she said, âWhy are those papers on the altar pall?â âThey hold the names, your majesty, of all Condemned to death by law. The one you touch Shall surely live.âThe ancient rite is such.â Without a pause to weigh it, the great thought Burst from her nature, as she sprang and caught, Hither and thither, at each fatal scrawlâ Gathered the wholeâand, ere she let them fall, A gracious look to the rapt court she gave, And softly said, âSee, seÃ±ors, see, I have A little hand, but I can touch them all!â [I have a cottage where the sunbeams lurk] I have a cottage where the sunbeams lurk, Peeping around its gables all day long, Brimming the butter-cups until they drip With molten gold, like o'ercharged crucibles. Here, wondering why the morning-glories close Their crumpled edges ere the dew is dry, Great lilies stand, and stretch their languid buds In the full blaze of noon, until its heat Has pierced them to their centres. Here the rose Is larger, redder, sweeter, longer-lived, Less thorny, than the rose of other lands. I have a cottage where the south wind comes, Cool from the spicy pines, or with a breath Of the mid ocean salt upon its lips, And a low, lulling, dreamy sound of waves, To breathe upon me, as I lie along On my white violets, marvelling at the bees That toil but to be plundered, or the mart Of striving men, whose bells I sometimes hear When they will toss their brazen throats at heaven, And howl to vex me. But the town is far; And all its noises, ere they trouble me, Must take a convoy of the scented breeze, And climb the hills, and cross the bloomy dales, And catch a whisper in the swaying grain, And bear unfaithful echoes from the wood, And mix with birds, and streams, and fluttering leaves, And an old ballad which the shepherd hums, Straying in thought behind his browsing flock. I have a cottage where the wild bee comes To hug the thyme, and woo its dainties forth; Where humming-birds, plashed with the rainbow's dies, Poise on their whirring wings before the door, And drain my honeysuckles at a draught. Ah, giddy sensualist, how thy blazing throat Flashes and throbs, while thou dost pillage me Of all my virgin flowers! And then, awayâ What eye may follow! But yon constant robin: Spring, summer, winter, still the same clear song At morn and eve, still the contented hop, And low sly whistle, when the crumbs are thrown: Yet he is jealous of my tawny thrush, And drives him off, ere a faint symphony Ushers the carol warming in his breast. I have a cottage where the winter winds Wreck their rude passions on the neighboring hills, And crawl down, shattered by the edgÃ©d rocks, To hide themselves among the stalactites, That roof my frosty cave, against midsummer; Or in the bosom of the stream they creep, Numbing the gurgling current till it lies Stark, frozen, lifeless, silent as the moon; Or wrestle with the cataracts; or glide, Rustling close down, among the crisp dead grass, To chase the awkward rabbits from their haunts; Or beat my roof with its own sheltering boughs;â Yet never daunt me! For my flaming logs Pour up the chimney a defiant roar, While Shakspeare and a flask of southern wine, Brown with the tan of Spain, or red Bordeaux, Charm me until the crocus says to me, In its own way, âCome forth; I 've brought the spring!â I have a cottage where the brook runs by, Making faint music from the rugged stones O'er which it slides; and at the height of Prime, When snows are melting on the misty hills That front the south, this brook comes stealing up To wash my door-stone. Oft it bears along, Sad sight, a funeral of primrosesâ Washed from the treacherous bank to which they grew With too fond faithâall trooping one by one, With nodding heads in seemly order ranged, Down its dull current towards the endless sea. O, brook, bear me, with such a holy calm, To the vast ocean that awaits for me, And I know one whose mournful melody Shall make your name immortal as my love. I have a cottage in the cloven hills; Through yonder peaks the flow of sunlight comes, Dragging its sluggish tide across the path Of the reluctant stars which silently Are buried in it. Through yon western gap Day ebbs away, leaving a margin round, Of sky and cloud, drowned in its sinking flood, Till Venus shimmers through the rising blue, And lights her sisters up. Here lie the moonbeams, Hour after hour, becalmed in the still trees; Or on the weltering leaves of the young grass Rest half asleep, rocked by some errant wind. Here are more little stars, on winter nights, Than sages reckon in their heavenly charts; For the brain wanders, and the dizzy eye Aches at their sum, and dulls, and winks with them. The Northern Lights come down to greet me here, Playing fantastic tricks, above my head, With their long tongues of fire, that dart and catch, From point to point, across the firmament, As if the face of heaven were passing off In low combustion; or the kindling night Were slowly flaming to a fatal dawn, Wide-spread and sunless as the day of doom. I have a cottage cowering in the trees, And seeming to shrink lower day by day. Sometimes I fancy that the growing boughs Have dwarfed my dwelling; but the solemn oaks, That hang above my roof so lovingly, They too have shrunk. I know not how it is: For when my mother led me by the hand Around our pale, it seemed a weary walk; And then, as now, the sharp roof nestled there, Among the trees, and they propped heaven. Alas! Who leads me now around the bushy pale? Who shows the birds' nests in the twilight leaves? Who catches me within her fair round arms, When autumn shakes the acorns on our roof To startle me? I know not how it is: The house has shrunk, perhaps, as our poor hearts, When they both broke at parting, and mine closed Upon a memory, shutting out the world Like a sad anchorite.âAh! that gusty morn! But here she lived, here died, and so will I. I have a cottageâmurmur if ye will, Ye men whose lips are prison-doors to thoughts Born, with mysterious struggles, in the heart; And, maidens, let your store of hoarded smiles Break from their dimples, like the spreading rings That skim a lake, when some stray blossom falls Warm in its bosom. Ah, you cannot tell Why violets choose not a neighboring bank, Why cowslips blow upon the self-same bed, Why year by year the swallow seeks one nest, Why the brown wren rebuilds her hairy home. O, sightless cavillers, you do not know How deep roots strike, nor with what tender care The soft down lining warms the nest within. Think as you will, murmur and smile apaceâ I have a cottage where my days shall close, Calm as the setting of a feeble star. ODE TO A MOUNTAIN OAK. Proud mountain giant, whose majestic face, From thy high watch-tower on the steadfast rock, Looks calmly o'er the trees that throng thy base, How long hast thou withstood the tempest's shock? How long hast thou looked down on yonder vale Sleeping in sun before thee; Or bent thy ruffled brow, to let the gale Steer its white, drifting sails just o'er thee? Strong link 'twixt vanished ages! Thou hast a sage and reverend look; As if life's struggle, through its varied stages, Were stamped on thee, as in a book. Thou hast no voice to tell what thou hast seen, Save a low moaning in thy troubled leaves; And canst but point thy scars, and shake thy head, With solemn warning, in the sunbeam's sheen; And show how Time the mightiest thing bereaves, By the sere leaves that rot upon thy bed. Type of long-suffering power! Even in my gayest hour, Thou 'dst still my tongue, and send my spirit far, To wander in a labyrinth of thought; For thou hast waged with Time unceasing war, And out of pain hast strength and beauty brought. Thou amidst storms and tempests hadst thy birth, Upon these bleak and scantly-sheltering rocks, Nor much save storm and wrath hast known on earth; Yet nobly hast thou bode the fiercest shocks That Circumstance can pour on patient Worth. I see thee springing, in the vernal time, A sapling weak, from out the barren stone, To dance with May upon the mountain peak; Pale leaves put forth to greet the genial clime, And roots shot down life's sustenance to seek, While mere existence was a joy aloneâ O thou wert happy then! On Summer's heat thy tinkling leaflets fed, Each fibre toughened, and a little crown Of green upon thy modest brow was spread, To catch the rain, and shake it gently down. But then came Autumn, when Thy dry and tattered leaves fell dead; And sadly on the gale Thou drop'dst them one by oneâ Drop'dst them, with a low, sad wail, On the cold, unfeeling stone. Next Winter seized thee in his iron grasp, And shook thy bruised and straining form; Or locked thee in his icicle's cold clasp, And piled upon thy head the shorn cloud's snowy fleece. Wert thou not joyful, in this bitter storm, That the green honors, which erst decked thy head, Sage Autumn's slow decay, had mildly shed? Else, with their weight, they 'd given thy ills increase, And dragged thee helpless from thy uptorn bed. Year after year, in kind or adverse fate, Thy branches stretched, and thy young twigs put forth, Nor changed thy nature with the season's date: Whether thou wrestled'st with the gusty north, Or beat the driving rain to glittering froth, Or shook the snow-storm from thy arms of might, Or drank the balmy dews on summer's night;â Laughing in sunshine, writhing in the storm, Yet wert thou still the same! Summer spread forth thy towering form, And Winter strengthened thy great frame. Achieving thy destiny On went'st thou sturdily, Shaking thy green flags in triumph and jubilee! From thy secure and sheltering branch The wild bird pours her glad and fearless lay, That, with the sunbeams, falls upon the vale, Adding fresh brightness to the smile of day. 'Neath those broad boughs the youth has told love's tale; And thou hast seen his hardy features blanch, Heard his snared heart beat like a prisoned bird, Fluttering with fear, before the fowler laid; While his bold figure shook at every wordâ The strong man trembling at a timid maid! And thou hast smiled upon their children's play; Seen them grow old, and gray, and pass away. Heard the low prattle of the thoughtless child, Age's cold wisdom, and the lessons mild Which patient mothers to their offspring say;â Yet art thou still the same! Man may decay; Race after race may pass away; The great may perish, and their very fame Rot day by dayâ Rot noteless with their once inspired clay: Still, as at their birth, Thou stretchest thy long arms above the earthâ Type of unbending Will! Type of majestic, self-sustaining Power! Elate in sunshine, firm when tempests lower, May thy calm strength my wavering spirit fill! O let me learn from thee, Thou proud and steadfast tree, To bear unmurmuring what stern Time may send; Nor 'neath life's ruthless tempests bend: But calmly stand like thee, Though wrath and storm shake me, Though vernal hopes in yellow Autumn end, And, strong in Truth, work out my destiny. Type of long-suffering Power! Type of unbending Will! Strong in the tempest's hour, Bright when the storm is still; Rising from every contest with an unbroken heart, Strengthened by every struggle, emblem of might thou art! Sign of what man can compass, spite of an adverse state, Still, from thy rocky summit, teach us to war with Fate! THE RIVER AND THE MAIDEN. From the sunset flows the river, Melting all its waves in one; Not a ripple, not a quiver, On the flaming water, ever Poured from the descending sun. Seeming like a pathway lately Radiant with an angel's tread; And yon vessel, moving stately, Is the heavenly one sedately Walking with his wings outspread. What a quiet! Through the branches, Silently the orioles skip; Not again the fish-hawk launches, Silently his plumes he stanches, Silently the sedges drip. Other sights, and loud commotion, Fill this tranquil stream by day; With a solemn swaying motion, Wave-worn ships forsake the ocean, Bound from countries leagues away; Odorous with their eastern spices, Rich with gems of the Brazils, Persian silks of quaint devices, Nameless things of wondrous prices, Luscious wines from Spanish hills; Furs from the shy ermine riven, Ingots of Peruvian mould, Where the deadly tropic levin Crashes from the blazing heaven, Piercing earth with veins of gold. But amid the sacred quiet Of this gentle evening-time, Toil and sin have ceased their riot; One might judge the awful fiat Were removed from Adam's crime. Holiest eve, thy light discloses Holiest things; for through the shades Mark I where my love reposes, Sitting there, amid the roses, Like a queen amid her maids. Through the foliage, green and golden, Round her head the sunbeams dart, Haloing her like some saint olden; And a chapel calm is holden In the stillness of her heart. Distant, yet I guess her singing; Haply, some poor lay of mine, Loud with drum and trumpet ringing, Or of shameless goblets swinging In the tumult of the wine. Wicked ballad! all unsuited To the genial season's calm, Harsh, discordant, sin-polluted;â Yet by her sweet voice transmuted Almost to a vesper psalm. See, her steps are hither bending; This, our trysting-place, she seeks: All her wealth is with her wending, In the lights and shadows blending Round the dimples of her cheeks; In the eyes that melt at sorrow, In the wisdom without wiles, In the faith that will not borrow From to-day fear of to-morrow, In a countless store of smiles; In the heart that cannot flutter For a breath of flattery, In the mouth that cannot utter Halting lie or envious mutterâ In her simple love for me. Crowd yon river with your bargesâ All the navies of the mainâ Till the loaded tide enlarges, Till it bursts its wonted marges, Deluging the pleasant plain; Freight them with the precious plunder Of the lands beyond the seaâ Pearls that make the diver wonder, All the virgin silver under The great hills of Potosi; All the real and fabled riches Of the haughty Persian Khan, All the gold that so bewitches, All the gorgeous broidered stitches Of the girls of Hindostan; All the furs, the wines, the treasures, Were they at my bidding laid, Ten times doubled in their measures, Ten times doubled in their pleasures, I would rather have the maid! VESTIGIA RETRORSUM. There is a spot I call accursed, Because my thoughts forever wing Back to its gloom, from which they burst, And settle on the loathsome thing. The thick black pool, the waterfall, Swart crags that nurture noxious vines; The long, unbending outer wall Made by the solid depth of pines; The reptile weeds that crawl about The rotting shore; the glaring flowers, Nauseous with odors, that give out No grace of heaven's baptizing showers; The hollow roar that fills the sceneâ A sound caught up, and smothered in, By the close pines which rise between The world and that unholy din. Long ringÃ©d serpents idly loll, With haughty eyes, that never wink, Upon the oily pool, or roll In horrid sports around its brink. All creatures that abhor the day Find harbor in the rocky lair; And all the foulest birds of prey Light slowly down, and settle there. The moving powers of air bewail This blotch upon earth's face allowedâ Moaned by the high o'erpassing gale, Wept over by the flying cloud; Cut by the edgÃ©d hail that pours With added wrath here, choked with snow; Scathed by the thunder-cloud that roars Its bolts down, blow reÃ«choing blow. Still it arisesârocks and trees, Pool, waterfall, and rank-grown sodâ Above my better memories, And frowns between me and my God. This spot had once another look; Its sounds were as a choral psalm, Ere sin's and sorrow's hands I took, And walked between them, palm in palm. Ah! yes, her beauty gave the place A wondrous light; and my young rhyme, Fervid with love's creative grace, Brought on the Spring before its time. Yea, Summer came while May was young, And smiled to see the lovers meet, And all her flowery censers swung Their perfumes round our trysting-seat. Too soon the vernal bloom! too soon The year's maturer charms! their dust Whirled 'twixt us and the harvest moon Ere Autumn blew his frosty gust. She fellâO God! I know not howâ Fell from her over-trust in me; The flowers had turned to dust, and now Our love had turned to misery. O fool! the promised fruit I sought Was ripening into sweetest use; I snatched it ere its time, and caught Upon my lip but acrid juice. Nature shrank from me all aghast, Men whispered as they passed my door, The precious lights of life waned fast, And heaven seemed further than before. I would have done her right. We met: I owned my crime, I urged her claim; There was no ebb of love, and yet We turned aside with common shame. We could not get our eyes to meet, We could not link our hands again; I talked, but words had ceased to cheat; We partedâ't was relief from pain. Priest, vow, and ring, all things arrangeâ Shrewd brokers in our worldly martâ I tell ye, these are poor exchange To offer for a broken heart. When Winter heaped her grave with snow, What right had I to make my moans? What right to hope a tear would flow, Or anger heaven with selfish groans? The vanished joy, the void of love, The heart that nothing fills within, The fear that dares not look above, Are relics of my early sin. Better beside her shameful tomb This aching head for years had lain, And o'er my mound the Winter's gloom Had snowed a mountain from the plain, Than thus to liveâa life in death, That courts no peace, and shuns no strife, A slow, dull drawing of the breathâ A being you cannot call life. I wonder not the dell is cursed, Upon this world a hideous blot; I only wonder earth ne'er burst, To swallow up that hateful spot. The pool, the wood, the waterfall, The flowers, the cliffs, the gloomâmy brain Whirls with a picture of ye allâ I rise, and curse ye all again! A BALLAD OF SIR JOHN FRANKLIN. The ice was here, the ice was there, The ice was all around.â Coleridge. O, whither sail you, Sir John Franklin? Cried a whaler in Baffin's Bay. To know if between the land and the pole I may find a broad sea-way. I charge you back, Sir John Franklin, As you would live and thrive; For between the land and the frozen pole No man may sail alive. But lightly laughed the stout Sir John, And spoke unto his men: Half England is wrong, if he be right; Bear off to westward then. O, whither sail you, brave Englishman? Cried the little Esquimaux. Between your land and the polar star My goodly vessels go. Come down, if you would journey there, The little Indian said; And change your cloth for fur clothing, Your vessel for a sled. But lightly laughed the stout Sir John, And the crew laughed with him too:â A sailor to change from ship to sled, I ween, were something new! All through the long, long polar day, The vessels westward sped; And wherever the sail of Sir John was blown, The ice gave way and fled. Gave way with many a hollow groan, And with many a surly roar, But it murmured and threatened on every side, And closed where he sailed before. Ho! see ye not, my merry men, The broad and open sea? Bethink ye what the whaler said, Think of the little Indian's sled! The crew laughed out in glee. Sir John, Sir John, 't is bitter cold, The scud drives on the breeze, The ice comes looming from the north, The very sunbeams freeze. Bright summer goes, dark winter comesâ We cannot rule the year; But long ere summer's sun goes down, On yonder sea we'll steer. The dripping icebergs dipped and rose, And floundered down the gale; The ships were staid, the yards were manned, And furled the useless sail. The summer's gone, the winter's comeâ We sail not on yonder sea: Why sail we not, Sir John Franklin?â A silent man was he. The summer goes, the winter comesâ We cannot rule the year: I ween, we cannot rule the ways, Sir John, wherein we 'd steer. The cruel ice came floating on, And closed beneath the lee, Till the thickening waters dashed no more; 'T was ice around, behind, beforeâ My God! there is no sea! What think you of the whaler now? What of the Esquimaux? A sled were better than a ship, To cruise through ice and snow. Down sank the baleful crimson sun, The northern light came out, And glared upon the ice-bound ships, And shook its spears about. The snow came down, storm breeding storm, And on the decks was laid, Till the weary sailor, sick at heart, Sank down beside his spade. Sir John, the night is black and long, The hissing wind is bleak, The hard, green ice as strong as death:â I prithee, Captain, speak! The night is neither bright nor short, The singing breeze is cold, The ice is not so strong as hopeâ The heart of man is bold! What hope can scale this icy wall, High over the main flag-staff? Above the ridges the wolf and bear Look down, with a patient, settled stare, Look down on us and laugh. The summer went, the winter cameâ We could not rule the year; But summer will melt the ice again, And open a path to the sunny main, Whereon our ships shall steer. The winter went, the summer went, The winter came around; But the hard, green ice was strong as death, And the voice of hope sank to a breath, Yet caught at every sound. Hark! heard you not the noise of guns?â And there, and there, again? 'T is some uneasy iceberg's roar, As he turns in the frozen main. Hurra! hurra! the Esquimaux Across the ice-fields steal: God give them grace for their charity!â Ye pray for the silly seal. Sir John, where are the English fields, And where are the English trees, And where are the little English flowers That open in the breeze? Be still, be still, my brave sailors! You shall see the fields again, And smell the scent of the opening flowers, The grass, and the waving grain. O! when shall I see my orphan child? My Mary waits for me. O! when shall I see my old mother, And pray at her trembling knee? Be still, be still, my brave sailors! Think not such thoughts again. But a tear froze slowly on his cheek; He thought of Lady Jane. Ah! bitter, bitter grows the cold, The ice grows more and more; More settled stare the wolf and bear, More patient than before. O! think you, good Sir John Franklin, We'll ever see the land? 'T was cruel to send us here to starve, Without a helping hand. 'T was cruel, Sir John, to send us here, So far from help or home, To starve and freeze on this lonely sea: I ween, the Lords of the Admiralty Would rather send than come. O! whether we starve to death alone, Or sail to our own country, We have done what man has never doneâ The truth is founded, the secret wonâ We passed the Northern Sea! THE SIEGE OF CABEZON. âLa justicia del rey Don Pedro.â Don Pedro before Cabezon A weary time had lain, Through summer's heat, through winter's frost, Through sunshine and through rain. Still Trastamara's rebel flag Flapped in the mountain gale, And still the baffled monarch paced In ire the tented vale. âNow, by my crown,â Don Pedro swore, And clashed his armÃ©d hand, âI 'd give my dearest year of life, Upon that rock to stand! âI 'd sprinkle all the path between This valley and yon crag, With my best blood, to lay a hand Upon that vaunting flag!â âAs well Don Pedro might besiege The eagle's dizzy nest,â A knight replied; and idly trimmed The favors on his crest. âA train of damsels were as well, To stare at yonder tower, As this array of martial men, Drawn out with useless power.â âAy,â laughed Don Pedro, moodily, Beneath his lowering brow, âArms might be kept for holidays, If always used as now. âYet here I'll lie, hap what will hap, Till famine drive them out.ââ Just then, from the left wing arose A long, triumphant shout. âWhat means that cry?âââTwo men-at-arms, Flying from Cabezon, Were by an outpost of your line Surprised, and seized upon.â âBring in the prisoners.ââDown they knelt Beneath Don Pedro's eye. âHa! traitors, have ye fled your liege, And come to me to die?â âTo die, Don Pedro, if you will, Rather than bear the stain Of those worse traitors unto heaven Who at their posts remain.â âSpeak out: I'll listen. Do not fear To make your story long: Gramercy! we have time enough To tire a woman's tongue!â Don Pedro yawned, and stretched himself; But, as the story ran, I ween, he bounded to his feet. Thus spake the foremost man: âWe guarded rocky Cabezonâ Unfaltering, nothing loathâ Till faith turned into mutiny, And guilt sprang up from sloth; âTill all our lazy garrison Stood muttering apart, And framing wicked stratagems, To vex the Governor's heart. âAnd now 't was this, and now 't was thatâ Fierce murmurs, huge demandsâ Forever closing with the threat To yield them to your hands. âThe Governor rendered all to them, Rather than aught to you: But, day by day, his care-worn face Paler and paler grew. âDaily his wife and daughter found The once so ready smile Came slower to his lips, and staid Thereon a shorter while. âYet daily, by the old man's side, They paced around the wall, Until they saw how with one look The men pursued them all: âUntil they saw audacious leers Upon their persons cast, Or snatched their skirts from mailÃ©d hands That clutched them as they passed. âOr heard such jests as well might start A very wanton's blood,â Jests that forced modest cheeks to flame Beneath the close-drawn hood. âThen to their bower they fled amain, And hid their dangerous charms; And strove to talk away their tears, And lull their wild alarms. âBolder and bolder grew the men, The Governor grew more wan: At length, from out a whispering knot, Strode one, and thus began: âBring us your wife and daughter, fool, Or down this flag shall come.â With a back-handed blow, our chief Struck the gross ruffian dumb. âAt once swords flashed, and visors closed, And spears gleamed all around; And, with his dagger in his hand, The wretch sprang from the ground. âWe spoke in vainâââBut heâyour chief?â Broke in Don Pedro's voice: Then held his breath, and bent his ear, To hear the Governor's choice. âThis said heâHold that flag secure, And ere to-morrow's sun All mine be yours.âââHeavens!â cried the king, âThe like was never done! âShall he outdo us? Herald, ho! And let a parley sound. Summon the Governor to the wall, And call my guard around. âHo! Governor, send your traitors down, And, in return again, I'll send you, man for man, my best, All belted knights of Spain; âWho shall be sworn, by book and cross To keep you safe from siege Against all comers, whosoe'er, Even against their liege.â Low bowed the Governor: âKing fair words Are barren pay and cold; Yet God takes up a poor man's debt, And turns his thanks to gold. âA thousand times may Heaven o'erpay The deed you do for me; And, served I not a better liege, I 'd draw my sword for thee.â The king smiled. âKnights, my future foes, File through yon rocky arch.â You, with the love-knots in your crest, Be you the first to march!â Up through the gates of Cabezon Don Pedro's bravest went, And straggling down the narrow path The sullen traitors sent. Around the miscreants silently The royal soldiers drew. âNow, ballesteros,â cried the king, âYe know what work to do! âStand back, thou ghostly man of God! Thou shalt not pray nor shrive: If 't were within my power, to hell I 'd hurry them alive!â A hundred maces swang aloft, A hundred blows were given, And crushed into one mangled mass The traitors lay unshriven. The drawbridge rose, the castle gates Rolled slowly back; and when The king looked up, he saw the walls Glitter with mail-clad men. Slowly Don Pedro walked, as one Who turns a purpose o'er, Plucking the lilies in his path, Unconscious what he bore: Slowly Don Pedro towards his camp Walked through the setting sun; And patiently next morn he lay Besieging Cabezon. COUNT CANDESPINA'S STANDARD. âThe king of Aragon now entered Castile, by the way of Soria and Osma, with a powerful army; and, having been met by the queen's forces, both parties encamped near Sepulveda, and prepared to give battle. This engagement, called, from the field where it took place, de la Espina, is one of the most famous of that age. The dastardly Count of Lara fled at the first shock, and joined the queen at Burgos, where she was anxiously awaiting the issue; but the brave Count of Candespina (Gomez Gonzalez) stood his ground to the last, and died on the field of battle. His standard-bearer, a gentleman of the house of Olea, after having his horse killed under him, and both hands cut off by sabre-strokes, fell beside his master, still clasping the standard with his arms, and repeating his war-cry of âOlea!â Mrs. George's âAnnals of the Queens of Spain.â Scarce were the splintered lances dropped, Scarce were the swords drawn out, Ere recreant Lara, sick with fear, Had wheeled his steed about. His courser reared, and plunged, and neighed, Loathing the fight to yield, But the coward spurred him to the bone, And drove him from the field. Gonzales in his stirrups roseâ âTurn, turn, thou traitor knight! Thou bold tongue in a lady's bower, Thou dastard in a fight!â But vainly valiant Gomez cried Across the waning fray; Pale Lara and his craven band To Burgos scoured away. âNow, by the God above me, sirs, Better we all were dead, Than a single knight among ye all Should ride where Lara led! âYet ye who fear to follow me, As yon traitor, turn and fly; For I lead ye not to win a field, I lead ye forth to die. âOlea, plant my standard here, Here, on this little mound, Here raise the war-cry of thy house, Make this our rallying-ground. âForget not, as thou hop'st for grace, The last care I shall have Will be to hear thy battle-cry, And see that standard wave.â Down on the ranks of Aragon The bold Gonzales drove; And Olea raised his battle-cry, And waved the flag above. Slowly Gonzalez's little band Gave ground before the foe; But not an inch of the field was won Without a deadly blow: And not an inch of the field was won That did not draw a tear From the widowed wives of Aragon, That fatal news to hear. Backward and backward Gomez fought, And high o'er the clashing steel, Plainer and plainer, rose the cry, âOlea for Castile!â Backward fought Gomez, step by step, Till the cry was close at hand, Till his dauntless standard shadowed him, And there he made his stand. Mace, sword, and axe, rang on his mail, Yet he moved not where he stood, Though each gaping joint of armor ran A stream of purple blood. As pierced with countless wounds he fell, The standard caught his eye, And he smiled, like an infant hushed asleep, To hear the battle-cry. Now, one by one, the wearied knights Had fallen, or basely flown; And on the mound, where his post was fixed, Olea stood alone. âYield up thy banner, gallant knight! Thy lord lies on the plain, Thy duty has been nobly done; I would not see thee slain.â âSpare pity, King of Aragon; I would not hear thee lie; My lord is looking down from heaven, To see his standard fly.â âYield, madman, yield! thy horse is down, Thou hast nor lance nor shield; Fly! I will grant thee time.âââThis flag Can neither fly nor yield!â They girt the standard round about, A wall of flashing steel; But still they heard the battle-cry, âOlea for Castile!â And there, against all Aragon, Full-armed with lance and brand, Olea fought until the sword Snapped in his sturdy hand. Among the foe, with that high scorn Which laughs at earthly fears, He hurled the broken hilt, and drew His dagger on the spears. They hewed the hauberk from his breast, The helmet from his head, They hewed the hands from off his limbs,â From every vein he bled. Clasping the standard to his heart, He raised one dying peal, That rang as if a trumpet blewâ âOlea for Castile!â THE DEATH OF DOÃA URRACA. Don Pedro rode from Najera With fury in his brain; He hanged, hacked, burned, and boiled,âblood filled The footprints of his train. Prince Edward's sword had given the land Into the tyrant's power, And DoÃ±a Urraca with the rest Must bide the dismal hour. Because her son, Alfonso, fled Before the royal court, That lady fair, of high degree, Must make the rabble sport. Thus, in the strong Alcazar shut, She made her piteous moan, While her maidens gathered round, to hear, With many a hopeless groan. âMake me a robe, my gentle maids, And make it light and thin, That the fire may lap around my heart, And quickly creep within. âSo that the bitter death I bear, If cruel, may yet be brief; For Don Pedro dooms me to the stake, And heaven sends no relief. âThe king has sworn to see me burn, For young Alfonso's sake: If my son could hear the heavy news, I ween, his heart would ache. âAh! if he knew these tender arms, That nursed his helpless head, Must burn to ashes on the breast Whereat his childhood fed; âAnd the breath that fanned his baby brow, And sang his lullaby, Must feed the fire of Pedro's wrath, And shriek with agony;â âI fear Alfonso's lips would curse His birth-hour: but, I vow, I, who would then have died for him, Am proud to do it now. âSo make me a robe of Moorish stuff, And let the fire have sway; For my soul is sick whene'er I think Of lingering on the way.â âMistress,â said Leonor Davalos, Whilst the others only wept, âI'll make thy robe from cloth of wool Which I so long have kept; âI'll make thy robe from Flemish cloth, Lest, when the fire arise, Thy garments burn from off thy limbs, And shame thee in all eyes.â âBe still!â the lady sternly cried, âAnd do thy ordered part; Thou art too coolly provident To have me much at heart.â Then Leonor in silence bent, And wrought with little cheer; For down her cheeks the big drops ran, With every stitch a tear. Nathless, the robe was neatly made, Each seam in proper place; She bound her lady's girdle on, And looked into her face. The lady bade her maids farewell, She kissed them o'er and o'er, But not a look of love she cast On hapless Leonor. The lady knelt beside the priest, The holy bread was given, She made her peace with all the world, And turned her thoughts on heaven. The hour is come. The royal guard, With trampling harsh and loud, Have led the lady swiftly forth To face the hooting crowd. They bound her to the fatal stake With iron chains; and now The headsman blows his torch aflame Beneath his scowling brow. High into heaven, as if to bear Witness against her doom, The pitchy fagots flashed, then all Was silent as the tomb. Pale with affright, the lady hung Upon her chains and wept, Until a gust of brawling wind Across the ramparts swept; And drove the flames aslant, and caught The lady's fluttering gown, Stripping her person to the view Of every leering clown. Loud roared the crowd, and laughed, and jeered, To see the lady's plight, Pointing their fingers, nudging those Who could not bear the sight. âO Mary, mother of our Lord, I call upon thy name! Thou who dost know what I endure, O hide me from my shame! âO holy Virgin, take my soul! The inward fire I feel Is crueller than the fire around:â I'm bound, or I would kneel!â Sad Leonor, from where she stood, Heard how her lady cried; She sprang towards the blazing pile, And dashed the guard aside. Right through the smoke and sparkling coals She leaped into the flame, And spread her flowing garments out, And hid her lady's shame. She clasped her body with her arms, And straight into the sky,â High up, as towards some distant spot,â The two gazed steadfastly; Gazed with their wondering lips apart, Cheek pressed to pallid cheek, Heart stilled on heartâno sign they make, No stir, no word they speak; Gazed till their souls were following The vision far away, And the savage fagots blazed around A mass of senseless clay. THE LEGEND OF MARIA CORONEL. âO, Sisters of Santa Clara, If you 'd keep my soul from sin, Dig me a grave in the convent ground, And bury me within. âPile the turf loosely o'er my head, And closely let me lie, Till the king hath searched the cloisters through, And, haply, passed me by. âRather would I lie side by side With the foul and grisly dead, Than loll in wicked luxury Upon Don Pedro's bed. âO, sisters, hasten! Hark! the king Is thundering at the grate; Fierce oaths are thick upon his lipsâ How creaks the bending gate! âGod gave us not this precious time To waste in frightened prayer; We serve him better with our deeds, If they be bold and fair. âHe sits in heaven, and smiles serene Above each falling bead; Prayers he but hears, he lends his arm To help a noble deed.â âLady, the king will search the ground, And mark the new-turned sod.ââ âYe talk as women talk: I trust My chastity to God!â Scarce could the sexton dig the grave, And shoulder up his spade, With clods of grass, and damp black earth, Still clinging to the blade; Scarce could the lady fall along, And hide herself within, Ere the cloister walls, from end to end, Were full of martial din. Even while the breathless nuns heaped turf Above the seeming grave, Don Pedro's jewelled plumes were seen Across the court to wave. Straight towards the prioress and nuns The furious monarch came; Wrath smouldering in his deadly eyes, His cheeks with wrath aflame. O, wonder! miracle of grace! With every step he took A flower rose lightly from the grave, And in the breezes shook. Lily, and violet, and rose, Shot up, budded, and bore, Shedding such odors in the sun As flowers ne'er shed before. The alder sank its hollow tubes Far down into the tomb, Till all the damp air underneath Was banished with perfume. Betwixt the white roots of the flowers The tender grass peeped out, While through its spears long creepers trailed, And coiled their stems about. So, when the angry monarch's step Had staid its headlong speed, A multitude of roses blushed Between him and his deed. Naught saw he nigh him to betray The lady's hiding-place,â Naught but a little mound that seemed Flowered o'er by years of grace. No whisper from the frightened nuns, No breath, Don Pedro greets, Save the soft breath of tranquil flowersâ An eloquence of sweets. I know not if fair sights and scents May soothe a fiery soul, And with some subtle, mystic power Its raging heats control; But, certes, from that spot the king Turned with a calmer air, Muttering low phrases to himself, That sounded like a prayer. All still, as in a holy trance, The blessed lady lay, Nor knew how heaven had wrought until The king was far away. Nor ye who read, nor I who write, Know not how o'er our heads, When peril frowns, God's tender hand Such fragrant bounties spreads.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SONGS AND SONNETS. THE ROSE OF GRANADA. O, the Rose of Granada was blooming full-blown, And she laughed at the suitors who thought her their own, Till there came from Morocco the Moor, Ala Jaeer, And he tossed from his spear-head the horse-tails in air, Saying, âList to me, lady; For hither I 've flown, O Rose of Granada, To make thee my own.â He sang from his saddle of war and of love, With a voice that was soft as the houries' above; And he sang to his gittern of love and of war, With one foot in his stirrup and one in her door: Singing, âLook from thy lattice; I never will rove, O Rose of Granada, For war yields to love.â She smiled in his face as she ne'er smiled before, And the suitors went trooping away from her door; But they saw from a spear driven deep in the plain, Where a barb had been tied by his gold-bitted rein, That the horse-tails were waving, Now hither, now there; For the Rose of Granada Had fallen in the snare. The suitors went muttering, by day and by night, âOur Rose will be stolen away in our sight,â Till the Moor, Ala Jaeer, from her portal one morn Stepped, shaking the horse-tails in triumph and scorn: âO, in, to your lady, And tend her, I pray, For the Rose of Granada Is fading away. âShe is one of a hundredâto tell you 's but fair; Who'll tilt for the lady I 've left in despair?â With a scowl on his brow, and a sneer on his mouth, The horse-tails went dancing away towards the south. But the suitors were whispering, Ere daylight was gray, âO, the rose of Granada Has faded away!â [There was a gay maiden lived down by the mill] There was a gay maiden lived down by the millâ Ferry me over the ferryâ Her hair was as bright as the waves of a rill, When the sun on the brink of his setting stands still, Her lips were as full as a cherry. A stranger came galloping over the hillâ Ferry me over the ferryâ He gave her broad silver and gold for his will: She glanced at the stranger, she glanced o'er the sill; The maiden was gentle and merry. âO! what would you give for your virtue again?ââ Ferry me over the ferryâ âO! silver and gold on your lordship I 'd rain, I 'd double your pleasure, I 'd double my pain, This moment forever to bury.â LIDA. Lida, lady of the land, Called by men âthe blue-eyed wonder,â Hath a lily forehead, fanned By locks the sunlight glitters under. She hath all that 's scattered round Through a race of winning creatures; All, except the beauty found, By Johnny Gordon, in my features. Lida, lady of the land, Hath full many goodly houses, Fields, and parks, on every hand, Where your foot the roebuck rouses. She hath orchards, garden-plots, Valleys deep, and mountains swelling; All, except yon nest of cots, Johnny Gordon's humble dwelling. Lida, lady of the land, Hath treasures more than she remembers, Heaps of dusty gems, that stand Like living coals amid the embers. She hath gold whose touch would bring A lordship to a lowly peasant; All, except this little ring, Johnny Gordon's humble present. Lida, lady of the land, Hath a crowd of gallant suitors; Squires, who fly at her command, Knights, her slightest motion tutors. She hath barons kneeling mute, To hear the fortune of their proffers; All, except the honest suit Johnny Gordon humbly offers. Lida, lady of the land, Keep your wondrous charms untroubled; May your wide domain expand, May your gems and gold be doubled! Keep your lords on bended knee; Take all earth, and leave us lonely!â All, except you take from me Humble Johnny Gordon only. [Yes, I loved her! Bear me witness] Yes, I loved her! Bear me witness, Heaven, and sea, and mother earth, How I felt my own unfitness, Matched with her transcendent worth! How I bent my forehead meekly, Saying, âI am heart-sick, weakly, Jaded, worn with many trials,â Cursed, unto the last extreme, With the seven deadly vials!ââ In a dream. But, behold, the gentle maiden Touched me lightly with her hand; Saying, âRise, thou sorrow-laden Man of many griefs, and stand! For I love thee with my youthful Spirit warm, and pure, and truthful: Upward, to me, I beseech thee! Or, forgetting self-esteem, I will downward plunge to reach thee!ââ In a dream. It has faded from my vision; And again I stand alone, Thrust beyond the gates elysian, Listening to my exiled moan. Hearing her sweet accents neverâ Love, joy, hope, all gone together; But the pang will ne'er be banished Of that bright delusive gleam, Which has left its sting, and vanished In a dream. [When we meet again, shall I behold no shrinking] When we meet again, shall I behold no shrinking Of thy quick eyes, no sidelong glance of pain; No start, betraying what thy heart is thinking, When we meet again? When we meet again, shall I perceive no trial To wake a love already on the wane, To screen inconstancy by faint denial, When we meet again? When we meet again, shall I hear no bewailing, No hollow fiction of a treacherous brain, Raised to forestall my own true grief's assailing, When we meet again? When we meet again, shall I not know thee playing A part whose falsehood is too clearly plain, That cogs and kisses while it is betraying, When we meet again? When we meet again, O God! shall I not find thee As true to me as when thy lips were ta'en, In the deep calm of love, from lips that then resigned thee But to meet again? [The fever in my blood has died] The fever in my blood has died; The eager foot, the glancing eye, By beauty lured so easily, No more are moved, or turned aside: My smiles are gone, my tears are dried. And if I say I love thee now, 'T is not because my passions burnâ Fair as thou artâto ask return Of love for love, and vow for vow; Too dear exchanged for such as thou. I love thee only as he can Who knows his heart. I yield, in truth, Not the blind, headlong heat of youth, That pants ere it has run a span, But the determined love of man. And if from me you ask more fire Than lights my slowly-fading days,â The sudden frenzy and the blaze, The selfish clutch of young desire,â You point where I cannot aspire. Yet do not bend thy head to weep, Because my love so coldly shows; For where the fuel fiercely glows The flame is brief: in ashes deep The everlasting embers sleep. [I sit beneath the sunbeams' glow] I sit beneath the sunbeams' glow, Their golden currents round me flow, Their mellow kisses warm my brow, But all the world is dreary. The vernal meadow round me blooms, And flings to me its faint perfumes; Its breath is like an opening tomb'sâ I'm sick of life, I'm weary! The mountain brook skips down to me, Tossing its silver tresses free, Humming like one in revery; But, ah! the sound is dreary. The trilling blue-birds o'er me sail, There 's music in the faint-voiced gale; All sound to me a mourner's wailâ I'm sick of life, I'm weary. The night leads forth her starry train, The glittering moonbeams fall like rain, There 's not a shadow on the plain; Yet all the scene is dreary. The sunshine is a mockery, The solemn moon stares moodily; Alike is day or night to meâ I'm sick of life, I'm weary. I know to some the world is fair, For them there 's music in the air, And shapes of beauty everywhere; But all to me is dreary. I know in me the sorrows lie That blunt my ear and dim my eye; I cannot weep, I fain would dieâ I'm sick of life, I'm weary. [Wheel on thy axle, softly run] Wheel on thy axle, softly run, Dark earth, into the golden day! Rise from the burnished east, bright sun, And chase the scowling night away! Touch my love's eyelids; gently break The tender dream she dreams of me, With flowery odors; round her shake The swallow's morning minstrelsy. Tell her how, through the lonely dark, Her lover sighed with sleepless pain; And heard the watch-dog's hollow bark, And heard the sobbing of the rain. Tell her he waits, with listening ear, Beside the way that skirts her door; And till her radiant face appear, He shall not think the night is o'er. STREET LYRICS. I. THE GROCER'S DAUGHTER. Stop, stop! and look through the dusty pane.â She 's gone!âNay, hist! again I have caught her: There is the source of my sighs of pain, There is my idol, the Grocer's Daughter! âA child! no woman!â A bud, no flower: But think, when a year or more has brought her Its ripening roundness, how proud a dower Of charms will bloom in the Grocer's Daughter! I have a love for the flower that blows, One for the bud that needs sun and water; The first because it is now a rose, The other will be,âlike the Grocer's Daughter. She stood in the door, as I passed to-day, And mine and a thousand glances sought her; Like a star from heaven with equal ray, On all alike, shone the Grocer's Daughter. Mark how the sweetest on earth can smile, As yon patient drudge, yon coarse-browed porter, Eases his burdened back, the while Keeping his eyes on the Grocer's Daughter. Now, look ye! I who have much to loseâ Rank, wealth, and friendsâlike the load he brought her, Would toss them under her little shoes, To win that smile from the Grocer's Daughter. II. A MYSTERY. Just as the twilight shades turn darker, There is a maiden passes me; Many and many a time I mark her, Wondering who that maid can be. Sometimes she bears her music, fastened Scroll-like around with silken twine; And onceâalthough she blushed and hastened, I knew itâshe bore a book of mine. In cold or heat, I never passed her, Beneath serene or threatening skies, That she upon me did not cast her Strong, full, and steady hazel eyes. Eyes of such wondrous inner meaning, So filled with light, so deep, so true, As if her thoughts disclaimed all screening, And clustered in them, looking through. Thus, day by day, we meet; no greeting, No sign she makes, no word she says; Unless our eyes salute at meeting, And she says somewhat by her gaze. Says what? At first her looks were often As cheering as the sun above; Next they began to dim and soften, Like glances from a brooding dove. Then wonder, then reproach, concealing A coming anger, I could see: I passed, but felt her eyes were stealing Around, and following after me. Before me once, with firm possession, She almost paused, and hung upon The very verge of some confession; But maiden coyness led her on. Sometimes I think the maid indulges An idle fancy by the way; Sometimes I think her look divulges A deeper signâa mind astray. This eve she met me, wild with laughter, More sad than weeping would have beenâ A pang before, a sorrow after; Tell me, what can the maiden mean? III. THE TWO BIRDS. Two birds hang from two facing windows: One on a lady's marble wall; The other, a seamstress' sole companion, Rests on her lattice dark and small. The one, embowered by rare exotics, Swings in a curious golden cage; The other, beside a lone geranium, Peeps between wires of rusty age. The one consumes a dainty seedling, That, leagues on leagues, in vessels comes; The other pecks at the scanty leavings Strained from his mistress' painful crumbs. The lady's bird has careful lackeys, To place him in the cheerful sun; Upon her bird the seamstress glances, Between each stitch, till work is done. Doubtless the marble wall shines gayly, And sometimes to the window roam Guests in their stately silken garments; But yon small blind looks more like home. Doubtless the tropic flowers are dazzling, The golden cage is rare to see; But sweeter smells the low geranium, The mean cage has more liberty. 'T is well to feed upon the fruitage Brought from a distant southern grove; But better is a homely offering, Divided by the hand of love. The purchased service of a menial May, to the letter, fill its part; But there 's an overflowing kindness Springs from the service of a heart. Hark! yonder bird begins to warble: Well done, my lady's pretty pet! Thy song is somewhat faint and straitened, Yet sweeter tones I 've seldom met. And now the seamstress' bird.âO, listen! Hear with what power his daring song Sweeps through its musical divisions, With skill assured, with rapture strong! Hear how he trills; with what abundance He flings his varied stores away; Bursting through wood and woven iron With the wild freedom of his lay! Cease, little prisoner to the lady, Cease, till the rising of the moon; Thy feeble song is all unsuited To the full midday glare of June. Cease, for thy rival's throat is throbbing With the fierce splendor of the hour; His is the art that grasps a passion, To cast it back with ten-fold power. Cease, until yonder feathered poet Through all his wondrous song has run, And made the heart of wide creation Leap in the glory of the sun. IV. FLOWERS AT THE WINDOW. Flowers at the window! tropic blossoms blazing in our wintry air, On the dark, cold evening looking with a fervid summer glare: Just a bit of southern landscape prisoned in a northern pane, Just a hint of how the cactus bristles o'er its native plain; How the fuchsia hangs its scarlet buds amid the orange bowers, And the dust of all the valleys rises up at once in flowers. Yonder room is sick with odors, painful odors, too intense For the scentless air that nurtured the fresh longings of my sense. I should swoon among those flowers, their gaudy colors vex my eye, And their hot oppressive breath upon my whirling brain would lie Like the poisoned fumes, engendered by the eastern sorcerer's fire, That rouse the sense to madness, and the heart to horrible desire. Stay a moment,âthrough the flaunting stranger flowers, I mark a roseâ One pale native of our forests, standing there in mild repose; Hanging down its timid head, amid its haughty sisters meek, From them shrinking back, half-opened, with a blush upon its cheek. Wait I for the rose to blow, or wait I for the maid who stood In among the flowers, this morning, blooming into womanhood? THE AWAKING OF THE POETICAL FACULTY. All day I heard a humming in my ears, A buzz of many voices, and a throng Of swarming numbers, passing with a song Measured and stately as the rolling spheres'. I saw the sudden light of lifted spears, Slanted at once against some monster wrong; And then a fluttering scarf which might belong To some sweet maiden in her morn of years. I felt the chilling damp of sunless glades, Horrid with gloom; anon, the breath of May Was blown around me, and the lulling play Of dripping fountains. Yet the lights and shades, The waving scarfs, the battle's grand parades, Seemed but vague shadows of that wondrous lay. TO ANDREW JACKSON. Old lion of the Hermitage, again The times invoke thee, but thou art not here; Cannot our peril call thee from thy bier? France vapors, and the puny arm of Spain Is up to strike us; England gives them cheer, False to the child that in her hour of fear Must be her bulwark and her succor, fain To prop the strength which even now doth wane. Nor these alone; intestine broils delight The gaping monarchs, and our liberal shore Is rife with traitors. Now, while both uniteâ Europe and treasonâI would see once more Thy dreadful courage lash itself to might, Behold thee shake thy mane, and hear thy roar. 1852. TO LOUIS NAPOLEON. O, shameless thief! a nation trusted thee With all the wealth her bleeding hands had won, Proclaimed thee guardian of her liberty: So proud a title never lay upon Thy uncle's forehead: thou wast linked with one, First President of France, whose name shall be Fixed in the heavens, like God's eternal sunâ Second to him aloneâto Washington! Was it for thee to stoop unto a crown? Pick up the Bourbon's leavings? yield thy height Of simple majesty, and totter down Full of discovered frailtiesâsorry sight!â One of a mob of kings? or, baser grown, Was it for thee to steal it in the night? TO ENGLAND. [I. Lear and Cordelia! 'twas an ancient tale] Lear and Cordelia! 'twas an ancient tale Before thy Shakspeare gave it deathless fame: The times have changed, the moral is the same. So like an outcast, dowerless, and pale, Thy daughter went; and in a foreign gale Spread her young banner, till its sway became A wonder to the nations. Days of shame Are close upon thee: prophets raise their wail. When the rude Cossack with an outstretched hand Points his long spear across the narrow sea,â âLo! there is England!â when thy destiny Storms on thy straw-crowned head, and thou dost stand Weak, helpless, mad, a by-word in the land,â God grant thy daughter a Cordelia be! 1852. [II. Stand, thou great bulwark of man's liberty] Stand, thou great bulwark of man's liberty! Thou rock of shelter, rising from the wave, Sole refuge to the overwearied brave Who planned, arose, and battled to be free, Fell undeterred, then sadly turned to thee;â Saved the free spirit from their country's grave, To rise again, and animate the slave, When God shall ripen all things. Britons, ye Who guard the sacred outpost, not in vain Hold your proud peril! Freemen undefiled, Keep watch and ward! Let battlements be piled Around your cliffs; fleets marshalled, till the main Sink under them; and if your courage wane, Through force or fraud, look westward to your child! 1853. [III. At length the tempest from the North has burst] At length the tempest from the North has burst, The threatened storm, by sages seen of old; And into jarring anarchy is rolled Harmonious peace, so long and fondly nursed By watchful nations. Tyranny accursed Has broken boundsâthe wolf makes towards the fold. Up! ere your priceless liberties be sold Into degrading slavery! The worst That can befall you is the brunt of war, Dealt on a shield that oft has felt the weight Of foeman's blows.âUp! ere it be too late! For God has squandered all his precious store Of right and mercy, if the time 's so sore That slaves can bring you to their own base state. 1854. [IV. Far from the Baltic to the Euxine's strand] Far from the Baltic to the Euxine's strand, Peals the vast clamor of commencing war; And we, O England, on another shore, Like brothers bound, with wistful faces standâ With shouts of cheer, with wavings of the handâ With eager throbbings of the heart, to pour Our warlike files amid the battle's war, And nerve the terrors of thy lifted brand. Old wrongs have vanished in thy evil hours; The blood that fell between us, in the fight, Has dried away before a heavenly light. We'll strew thy paths of victory with flowers, Weep o'er thy woes, and cry, with all our powers, Thy cause is God's, because thy cause is right! 1854. [V. O, men of England, with an anxious heart] O, men of England, with an anxious heart We see you arming for the coming fight. Pale lips that quiver, in our pride's despite, Bid you God speed! Be this our tenderer part. Yours is the frown of war, the martial start That wakes to glory and resistless might, When your great standard rises on the sight, Blazoned with memories; an awful chart Of grand adventures done in olden days,â At once a pride and terror. Ill bestead The soul that shrinks from duty through its dread; Or seeks another outlet than the ways Marked down for you, amid the whole world's praiseâ The noble ways on which your fathers led. 1854. [VI. Once more old England's banner on the gale] Once more old England's banner on the gale Flames like the comet in our western sky; Beneath its fiery glare are lifted high Long lines of steel, and clouds of snowy sail. O, ye who bear it through the eastern vale, Think how it shone in CÅur de Lion's eye! Ye who behold it on the waters fly, Think how it answered Nelson's dauntless hail! From the Crusader to the Sailor turn, And mark the lines of glory that appear Stretched through your chronicles, starred far and near With names heroicalâdread names that burn, Like deathless lamps, above each funeral urn, To light you onward in their grand career. 1854. [VII. Faint not nor tremble, birthplace of my sires] Faint not nor tremble, birthplace of my sires, Because the dreadful arm of war is bare, And thy sons bleed with many wounds that glare In pleading misery on thee. Household fires Must quench; there 's trouble in the land. Desires For peace, old longings, that with loathful stare Take up the sword with such a backward air, Must vanish now. I know thy soul aspires Towards all that 's manly, liberal, and great: Therefore, when you behold your children come, Gored by the cursÃ©d Cossack, wounded home, Shed not a useless tear; but edge thy hate With double fury! Sound the mustering drum, And fill your ranks up to their wonted state! 1854. TO AMERICA. [I. What, cringe to Europe! Band it all in one] What, cringe to Europe! Band it all in one, Stilt its decrepit strength, renew its age, Wipe out its debts, contract a loan to wage Its venal battlesâand, by yon bright sun, Our God is false, and liberty undone, If slaves have power to win your heritage! Look on your country, God's appointed stage, Where man's vast mind its boundless course shall run: For that it was your stormy coast He spreadâ A fear in winter; girded you about With granite hills, and made you strong and dread. Let him who fears before the foemen shout, Or gives an inch before a vein has bled, Turn on himself, and let the traitor out! [II. What though the cities blaze, the ports be sealed] What though the cities blaze, the ports be sealed, The fields untilled, the hands of labor still, Ay, every arm of commerce and of skill Palsied and broken; shall we therefore yieldâ Break up the sword, put by the dintless shield? Have we no home upon the wooded hill, That mocks a siege? No patriot ranks to drill? No nobler labor in the battle-field? Or grant us beaten. While we gather might, Is there no comfort in the solemn wood? No cataracts whose angry roar shall smite Our hearts with courage? No eternal brood Of thoughts begotten by the eagle's flight? No God to strengthen us in solitude? TO THE MEMORY OF JOHN SERGEANT. The world may wait a century to see Thy equal mourned. When great men die, we sayâ âJust here they missed, or there they went astray: Alas! alas! that sweet morality Locks not her hand with greatness!â But in thee Heaven lit a lamp, to show how, day by day, The highest flame may shed the purest ray, Burning undimmed into eternity. There 's much of goodness, much of grandeur, gone To neighboring slumbers in our ancient earth;â Here some bewail a hero, some bemoan A saintly pilgrim; yet I doubt if worth, Religion, greatness, and their active birth, Were e'er before so mingled into one. November 27th, 1852. TO THE MEMORY OF M. A. R. With the mild light some unambitious star Illumes her pathway through the heavenly blueâ So unobtrusive that the careless view Scarce notes her where her haughtier sisters areâ So ran thy life. Perhaps, from those afar, Thy gentle radiance little wonder drew, And all their praise was for the brighter few. Yet mortal vision is a grievous bar To weigh true worth. For were the distance riven, Our eyes might find that star so faintly shone Because it journeyed through a higher zone, Had more majestic sway and duties given, Far loftier station on the heights of heaven, Was next to God, and circled round His throne. TO THE MEMORY OF S. S. The world may think I lay this thing to heart: I do, indeed, and of my grief am proud; Yet would not draw the wonder of the crowd, Either to me, or to my rhyming art. So I will lay thy sacred name apart From other griefs that haunt me in the shroud; And will not in affliction be too loud, Lest men suspect my cunning gives the start To these true tears. And if nor sigh, nor moan, Nor cry of anguish, load my heavy line, It is because this holy grief of mine Is a dear treasure. I am jealous grown, To share with men a thing I hold divine, Making that common which is all my own. TO BAYARD TAYLOR. [I. What changes of our natures have not been] What changes of our natures have not been, In the long process of the many days That passed while we pursued our different ways, Lost to each other! Fields, that once were green Beneath our tillage, have been reaped. The scene Of our young labors has grown old, and lays Its dust upon us. Things that won our praise, Are tasteless quite, and only move our spleen. Experience has nipped the bloom of youth; The flattering dawn of life has gone; in vain We look for visions of the morn. Stern truth Glares over us, and makes our view too plain. I'm sick of life's discoveries; in sooth, I 'd have the falsehoods of our youth again. [II. The world seems strangely altered to me, friend] The world seems strangely altered to me, friend, Since last I pressed my ready hand in thine. I feel like one awakening after wineâ For many yesterdays have had an end Since we two metâand drowsy tremors send A thrill of shame across this heart of mine, That I my better feelings could confine In easy opiates, make my spirit bend To slothful rest,âa drunkard, and no more! Yet I will rouse me from this lethargy. The past is past; the dreaming night is o'er; Heaven's lamp comes beaming from the East on me, Touching my eyelids to reality, And all is sunshine that was dark before. [How the fixed gaze of unadmiring time] How the fixed gaze of unadmiring time Can reconcile us with earth's wondrous sights; Win down our fancies from their breathless heights, Teaching 't is easier far to crawl than climb! Age spreads its marvels; but a creeping rime Dulls the worn eye; and all the precious lights Of early feeling deaden in the blights Of care, and avarice, and infectious crime. O, God! when use has palled my youthful senseâ When no new wonder daily comes to me From hill, or vale, or streamâno joy intense Breaks with the day, or flows in with the sea, Or opens with the flowerâO, take me hence, Hence, I implore, dear Lord, if not to Thee! [Dear is the fruit of sorrow, priceless store] Dear is the fruit of sorrow, priceless store Comes from the hand of grief, as sages tell; Seeking for comfort in the woes that swell Our hearts to bursting; with fore-gathered lore Lulling the fears that make a gloom before Our onward tread. Ah, hollow fraud! As well Speak truth, and sayââWe healed mishaps that fell By their own issue, as with running gore A wound is healed.ââBut, lo! the lasting scar! We make the best of man's dark destiny By self-deceit, while hopes and pleasures flee Before our vision; till the latest star Fades in the dawn of knowledge, and we see Earth, like a joyless desert, stretch afar. [Not when the buxom form which nature wears] Not when the buxom form which nature wears Is pregnant with the lusty warmth of Spring; Nor when hot Summer, sunk with what she bears, Lies panting in her flowery offering; Nor yet when dusty Autumn sadly fares In tattered garb, through which the shrewd winds sing, To bear her treasures to the griping snares Hard Winter set for the poor bankrupt thing; Not even when Winter, heir of all the year, Deals, like a miser, round his niggard board The brimming plenty of his luscious hoard; No, not in nature, change she howsoe'er, Can I find perfect type or worthy peer Of the fair maid in whom my heart is stored. [Spring, in the gentle look with which she turns] Spring, in the gentle look with which she turns Her sunny glance on all, indeed I find; And ardent Summer in the roses burns Of her twin cheeks, and from her gracious mindâ Like rare exotics nursed in precious urns, With cultured taste and native grace combinedâ Her teeming thoughts arise: too well she learns This summer sweetness! Generous Autumn, bind A deathless chaplet round her queenly brow; For, like thy own, in boundless charity, Her heart is filled with motives frank and free, Her hand with alms. Alas! I see it now; From thee, cold Winter, all her fancies flow, Who, rich in all, will nothing give to me. [Either the sum of this sweet mutiny] Either the sum of this sweet mutiny Amongst thy features argues me some harm; Or else they practise wicked treachery Against themselves, thy heart, and hapless me. For as I start aside with blank alarm, Dreading the glitter which begins to arm Thy clouded brows, lo! from thy lips I see A smile come stealing, like a loaded bee, Heavy with sweets and perfumes, all ablaze With soft reflections from the flowery wall Whereon it pauses. Yet I will not raise One question more, let smile or frown befall, Taxing thy love where I should only praise, And asking changes, that might change thee all. [I'll call thy frown a headsman, passing grim] I'll call thy frown a headsman, passing grim, Walking before some wretch foredoomed to death, Who counts the pantings of his own hard breath; Wondering how heart can beat, or steadfast limb Bear its sad burden to life's awful brim. I'll call thy smile a priest, who slowly saith Soft words of comfort, as the sinner strayeth Away in thought; or sings a holy hymn, Full of rich promise, as he walks behind The fatal axe with face of goodly cheer, And kind inclinings of his saintly ear. So, love, thou seest in smiles, or looks unkind, Some taste of sweet philosophy I find, That seasons all things in our little sphere. [Nay, not to thee, to nature I will tie] Nay, not to thee, to nature I will tie The gathered blame of every pettish mood; And when thou frown'st, I'll frown upon the wood, Saying, âHow wide its gloomy shadows lie!â Or, gazing straight into the day's bright eye, Predict ere night a fatal second flood; Or vow the poet's sullen solitude Has changed my vision to a darksome dye. But when thou smil'st, I will not look above, To wood or sky; my hand I will not lay Upon the temple of my sacred love, To blame its living fires with base decay; But whisper to thee, as I nearer move, âLove, thou dost add another light to day.â [How canst thou call my modest love impure] How canst thou call my modest love impure, Being thyself the holy source of all? Can ugly darkness from the fair sun fall? Or nature's compact be so insecure, That saucy weeds may sprout up and endure Where gentle flowers were sown? The brooks that crawl, With lazy whispers, through the lilies tall, Or rattle o'er the pebbles, will allure With no feigned sweetness, if their fount be sweet. So thou, the sun whence all my light doth flowâ Thou, sovereign law by which my fancies growâ Thou, fount of every feeling, slow or fleetâ Against thyself wouldst aim a treacherous blow, Slaying thy honor with thy own conceit. [Why shall I chide the hand of wilful Time] Why shall I chide the hand of wilful Time When he assaults thy wondrous store of charms? Why charge the gray-beard with a wanton crime? Or strive to daunt him with my shrill alarms? Or seek to lull him with a silly rhyme: So he, forgetful, pause upon his arms, And leave thy beauties in their noble prime, The sole survivors of his grievous harms? Alas! my love, though I'll indeed bemoan The fatal ruin of thy majesty; Yet I'll remember that to Time alone I owed thy birth, thy charms' maturity, Thy crowning love, with which he vested me, Nor can reclaim, though all the rest be flown. [Love is that orbit of the restless soul] Love is that orbit of the restless soul Whose circle grazes the confines of space, Bounding within the limits of its race Utmost extremes; whose high and topmost pole Within the very blaze of heaven doth roll; Whose nether course is through the darkest place Eclipsed by hell. What daring hand shall trace The blended joys and sorrows that control A heart whose journeys the fixed hand of fate Points through this pathway? Who may soar so highâ Behold such glories with unwinking eye? Who drop so low beneath his mortal state, And thence return with careful chart and date, To mark which way another's course must lie? [Thou who dost smile upon me, yet unknown] Thou who dost smile upon me, yet unknown, Mayst have more cause if thou wilt draw more near. Now Summer's heat unbinds the golden zone Of virgin buds; then why should chilling fear Seal up thy heart, and leave thy love unblown, While Nature whispers in thy timid ear, âNow is the timeâ? For Summer's quickly flown, And Winter's frost rounds up the flying year. Lady, I pray thee, take unto thy heart The lesson mother Nature reads to thee; Nor act towards me a more ungentle part Than Summer acts towards every budding tree, That feels her influence through its being dart, As I would feel thy influence dart through me. [Fear not, dear maid, the love I give to thee] Fear not, dear maid, the love I give to thee Shall feel the palsied touch of Time's decay. Thou dost confess my love will ever be, And only fear its strength may waste away, Dropping its blossoms as the seasons flee; Or like the evening of a boreal day, In lingering twilight stretch its sullen ray, And on the edge of night hang doubtfully. Grant love eternal, and thou grantest all; Eternity counts not the passing hour, Eternity knows naught of wane or fall, Nor measures days by bloom or fade of flower, Nor o'er its splendor casts sad evening's pall; To Time belongs this ever-changing power. [Where lags my mistress while the drowsy year] Where lags my mistress while the drowsy year Wakes into Spring? Lo! Winter sweeps away His snowy skirts, and leaves the landscape gay With early verdure; and there 's merry cheer Among the violets, where the sun lies clear On the south hill-sides; and at break of day I heard the blue-bird busy at my ear; And swallows shape their nests of matted clay Along the caves, or dip their narrow wings Into the mists of evening. All the earth Stirs with the wonder of a coming birth, And all the air with feathery music rings. Spring, it would crown thee with transcendent worth, To bring my love among thy beauteous things. [O! would that Fortune might bestow on me] O! would that Fortune might bestow on me One hour secluded from the prying world! So that the crowd through which my heart is hurled, Like a poor wreck upon a stormy sea, Might rage afar; and under some kind lea, Bowered with the creeping woodbine, and impearled With the fresh gems of morning, I might be For once alone with Nature and with thee. For unto Nature's ear I would resign The struggling secrets which my bosom fillâ The o'erfraught mystery of my own sweet ill, In loving thee beyond the prudent line Marked out by selfish philosophic skillâ To Nature's ear, dear lady, and to thine. [Your love to me appears in doubtful signs] Your love to me appears in doubtful signs, Vague words, shy looks, that never touch the heart; But to the brain a scanty hint impart As to whose side your dear regard inclines: Thence, forced by reason through the narrow lines That mark and limit the logician's artâ Catching from thought to thoughtâmy mind combines In one idea the mystic things you start, And coldly utters to my heartâthat swells With tardy raptureââIt is thee she loves!â Alas! alas! that reason only proves A fact your cautious action never tells, That I must reach my joy by slow removes, And guess at love, as at the oracles. [No gentle touches of your timid hand] No gentle touches of your timid handâ No shuddering kisses pressed upon my lip, 'Twixt fear and passionâno bold words that strip The feigning garb off in which we two stand, Acting our parts, at the harsh world's commandâ No deed that offers to our dust a sip Of heavenly nectarâno incautious slip, To wring a tear, yet calmly bear the brand, For the great love through which we were betrayed! Love flies with us on sorely crippled wings: Prudence, and interest, and the bitter stings Of shrewd distrust, are doled me. I am made A beggar on your bounty. Lend me aid: My heart starves, lady, on these wretched things. [Doubt is the offspring of a self-distrust] Doubt is the offspring of a self-distrust, The coward mood of a desponding mind, The treacherous pathway o'er which fancy, blind To love's clear pointings, treads, as o'er the crust Of a most faithless quicksand; 't is the rust Upon truth's shield, the blemish that we find Upon a mirror, carelessly designed, Distorting nature into shapes unjust, And making all things that within it move, Move in confusion, falsely and awry. Doubt is the lees of thought, the dregs that lie Beyond the bounds which reason reigns above, Baffling the keenness of his sun-bright eye;â Yea, doubt is anythingâbut honest love. [As at an altar, love, behold me kneel] As at an altar, love, behold me kneel Thus at thy feet. Too solemn for a lie My awful action, and thy bended eye, Whose searching power I cannot choose but feel. And here, thus lowly, all that might conceal My heart from thee I sunder and cast by; Courting thy notice, begging thee to pry Through all my nature, till the whole reveal Itself to thee. Then say if thou dost find One hint of falsehood, one poor thought to breed Doubt, or doubt's shadow, in thy candid mind? Ah, no! I love thee; and my sorest need Is trust from thee, a patient trust, resigned To face all ills, and triumph though it bleed. [I do assure thee, love, each kiss of thine] I do assure thee, love, each kiss of thine Adds to my stature, makes me more a man, Lightens my care, and draws the bitter wine That I was drugged with, while my nature ran Its slavish course. For didst not thou untwine My cunning fetters? break the odious ban, That quite debased me? free this heart of mine, And deck my chains with roses? While I can I'll chant thy praises, till the world shall ring With thy great glory; and the heaping store Of future honors, for the songs I sing, Shall miss thy poet, at thy feet to pour A juster tribute, as the gracious spring Of my abundance.âKiss me, then, once more. [To win and lose thee! In one hour to sa,] To win and lose thee! In one hour to say, âLo! love is mine!â and ere the dazzled mind Can know the fulness of its bliss, or find Its conscious vision lifted o'er the sway Of raging passionâwhile the heart, a prey To aching sense, is shrunken and grown blind With too much lightâto hear from every wind Hissed in my ear, âLo! love has flown away!â As if some careless angel left apart Heaven's golden doors, and I had seen within The radiant saints, and heard the holy din Of choral triumph, ere with jealous start The gates shot backward, closing my sad heart, With that bright memory, in a world of sin. [Here part we, love, beneath the world's broad eye] Here part we, love, beneath the world's broad eye, Yet heart to heart still answers as of old; And though fore'er within my breast I hold Thy image shut, and ne'er, by look nor sigh, Betray thy presence to the foes who lie Ambushed around us, do not deem me cold. For cowering Love's wide pinions only fold Closer, to shield him from the storm that's nigh,â Closer, to warm the fresh and godlike form That glows with life beneath the shrinking wings. So my deep love around thee darkly flings This cloud of coldness, that, beneath it, warm As the snow-covered currents of the springs, Our hearts may beat, safe-sheltered from the storm. [And shall we part without a parting kis?] And shall we part without a parting kiss? Must all the love I bore thee, all that thou Didst swear to me, untrammelled, vow on vow, Ebb to this lowness, come at last to this? A thousand fears have crossed my dream of bliss; And in the very blush and early glow Of budding passion, I was stricken low By boding fancies, lest our love should miss A happy goal by its too eager start. Yet, come what might, I should have boldly sworn That if we parted, howsoe'er forlorn Our future lot, or cruel the present smart, Or what wild acts of passion might be born From our despair, that thus we would not part. [No hope is mine, no comfort mine; for I] No hope is mine, no comfort mine; for I Am as an exile, and no pilgrim's grace Nerves my despair; I never can retrace The paths I trod, though myriads pass me by, Journeying, light-hearted, to the happy place Whence I am driven. Thou, Nature, on whose face I look for aid, dost close thy weary eye Against my grief. The moon wanes in the sky, The flowers dry up and perish, the great sea Through all its land-locked arteries ebbs, the dew Lies sickening on the blighted branch; no new Creation opens with the Spring: to me There is no crescent moon, no bud, no view Of refluent tides, no fruit,ânor will there be. [Imagine, love, that I bent over thee] Imagine, love, that I bent over thee; Imagine, love, I brushed thy eyelids dry, Hushed in my hands thy oft-recurring sigh, Warmed thee within my arms, and patiently Talked down thy sorrows, till thy heart in glee Leaped up and rapturously laughed; while I Stared in blank wonder at the mystery. Then, with moist lashes, put thy tresses byâ Marvelling in silence at the happy spell That brought thee comfortâand thy features dyed With added crimson, as my kisses fell Warm on thy lips and forehead. In my pride I fancy thus, and thou canst do as well; 'T would be no fancy, were I at thy side. [My lady sighs, and I am far away] My lady sighs, and I am far away; My lady weeps, and I cannot be near To still the sigh, or catch the falling tear On lips whose office 't is to own her sway, And curl in scorn when other maidens play Their love-pranks round me. I am lost in fear, Haunted with doubts and shadows that appear To lengthen ever with declining day. All things seem dubious; the rise and fall Of my own heart, the wild ideas that move Like phantoms through my brain, the faith above My intellectual grasp, do but appall By their dim aspects, and I doubt them all;â All seem unreal, except alone thy love. [If, by an absence of unnumbered years] If, by an absence of unnumbered years, I could return, and find thy feelings changed; If, by the shedding of uncounted tears, I could wash out what early sorrow stained; If by a coldness I could wake thy fears, And make thee chary of what love remained; Nay, if by hollow pride, and empty sneersâ Galling to thee, though but by cunning feignedâ I could once more upon thy gentle breast Lay my poor head, with all its aching thought, And rock my troubled fancies into rest, Or soothe the sorrows which my cruelty wrought; I would endure the grief, or act the jest,â Yea, double both, yet hold the price as naught. [Hence, cold despair! I do believe that they] Hence, cold despair! I do believe that they Who fold a promise, and within the breast Cherish a faith, shall some time know the rest Of bliss consummate. This immortal clay Is tempered in the tears we brush away; Made fruitful by our smiles; and every test That love o'ercomes adds plumage to his crest, And seals the triumph of a future day. Else would this stormy heart outpour in vain Its frequent tears; and its wild bursts of joy, And love unutterable, would but annoy, Not lighten the full spirit of its pain. Let us believe these raptures find employ, And smooth a pathway that may yet be plain. ON MY LADY'S LETTER. This slip of paper touched thy gentle hand, Doubtless was sunned beneath thy radiant eye; Perhaps had clearer honor, and did lie Upon thy bosom, or was proudly fanned Within thy fragrant breath. At my command A thousand fancies growing, as they fly, To maddening sweetness, flit my vision by, And mingle golden vapors with the sand That times my idle being. Senseless things Start into dignity beneath thy touch, Mount from the earth on love's ecstatic wings, And to my eyes seem sacred. If from such I draw such rapture, who may say how much, Wert thou the theme of my imaginings! [The ghostly midnight settles on my heart] The ghostly midnight settles on my heart. The winter rain against my window beats, The flaring lights along the level streets Look through a misty halo; torn apart By every gust, the fog-wreaths twist and start In wild disorder. Not a passer meets My straining eye; no song nor whistle greets My listening ear. This thronged and feverish mart Sleeps through the night, and Nature rules supreme. What thoughts are mine? what visions come to me, Drifting alone amid this tideless sea, When e'en thy eyes are closed above a dream In which, perhaps, no trace of me may seem,â What can I do but dream and dream of thee? [In this deep hush and quiet of my soul] In this deep hush and quiet of my soul, When life runs low, and all my senses stay Their daily riot; when my wearied clay Resigns its functions, and, without control Of selfish passion, my essential whole Rises in purity, to make survey Of those poor deeds that wear my days away; When in my ear I hear the distant toll Of bells that murmur of my coming knell, And all things seem a show and mockeryâ Life, and life's actions, noise and vanity; I ask my mournful heart if it can tell If all be truth which I protest to thee: And my heart answers, solemnly, â'T is well!â [I have been mounted on life's topmost wave] I have been mounted on life's topmost wave, Until my forehead kissed the dazzling cloud; I have been dashed beneath the murky shroud That yawns between the watery crests. I rave, Sometimes, liked cursed Orestes; sometimes lave My limbs in dews of asphodel; or, bowed With torrid heat, I moan to heaven aloud, Or shrink with Winter in his icy cave. Now peace broods over me; now savage rage Spurns me across the world. Nor am I free From nightly visions, when the pictured page Of sleep unfolds its varied leaves to me, Changing as often as the mimic stage;â And all this, lady, through my love for thee! [Ah! would to heaven that this dear misery] Ah! would to heaven that this dear misery, Which day by day within my heart I nurse, Shaping the issue of the direful curse, Against myself, with sad fatalityâ This snare of love, which so entangles me, Might be unknit. For in my dark reverse Of hopeless passion, I must suffer worse Than the dull wretch who, ignorant, yet free, Plods through his daily round of easy cares, Nor knows the shuddering depths and trembling heights Of my deep sorrows and supreme delights; The dizzy summits which my spirit dares, Winging towards thee, in its audacious flights, Its gloomy falls to fathomless despairs. [Sometimes, in bitter fancy, I bewail] Sometimes, in bitter fancy, I bewail This spell of love, and wish the cause removed; Wish I had never seen, or, seeing, not loved So utterly that passion should prevail O'er self-regard, and thoughts of thee assail Those inmost barriers which so long have proved Unconquerable, when such defence behoved. But, ah! my treacherous heart doth ever fail To ratify the sentence of my mind; For when conviction strikes me to the core, I swear I love thee fondlier than before; And were I now all free and unconfined, Loose as the action of the shoreless wind, My slavish heart would sigh for bonds once more. [To-night the tempest rages. All without] To-night the tempest rages. All without Is darkness, terror, and tremendous wails From the mad winds. Fierce rains and savage hails Dash on my window; and the branches shout, To see their luckless blossoms strewn about, Like frantic mourners. God, this night she sails O'er the chaotic ocean! Fear prevails Above my cowering spirit; and a rout Of dark forebodings makes this pitchy night One solid gloom. Hark, how the rushing air Clashes my casement! Ah! what heart shall dare Stand between her and danger, as I might, Cheering her courage with love's steady light? God, I am absent, wilt not Thou be there? [Another shriek like that, O furious wind] Another shriek like that, O furious wind, Will madden me! Is there no hand to check Thy wild career? no power whose awful beck May lull thy frenzied wrath? For thou art blind With loosened passion; and, thus unconfined, Thou dost abuse thy license, to the wreck Of all creation. Now, how reels the deck Above my helpless love! How every mind, Pent in that groaning vessel, paints its thought Of shameless fear upon each pallid face! How the infectious passion spreads! till, base With selfish terror, man is worse than naught, And manhood but a name. If prayers are aught, God, stand me near her, in some coward's place! [Again the tireless winds are rushing past] Again the tireless winds are rushing past, Heavy with blinding vapors; and again The streaming willows lash my window-pane, Dotting the glass with yellow leaves that fast Cling to their dripping hold, like wretches cast Upon my charity. Across the main My love still sails; and forth, through storm and rain, My heart goes out to seek her. Ruthless blast, Chill northern mist, and cutting hail, are ye Fit comrades for a being who has known No harsher sounds than the close whispered tone Of my affection?âcold to no degree More than my arms clasped round her tenderly?â No crueller wounds than from my eyes were thrown? [Thank Heaven, a lullâa lull in the long roar] Thank Heaven, a lullâa lull in the long roar Of the spent hurricane; and, lo! afar, Through the fast-scudding rack, one splendid starâ Brighter to me than star e'er shone beforeâ Looks downward, like the mystic light that bore Peace and good will to mortals. Ye that are The seaman's joy, soft western gales, debar Your breath no longer; waft her gently o'er The calming sea: then, if ye will, return In stormy fleetness, hissing from the East, With your old rage a thousand-fold increased; For though the universal ether burn With your hot flight, too soon I cannot learn That all the perils of my love have ceased. [What fancy, or what flight of wingÃ©d thought] What fancy, or what flight of wingÃ©d thought, O lady of my heart, hast thou to chime Accordant with the flow of my poor rhyme? Have my strange songs a dearer solace brought Than those remembered lays thy childhood caught, And treasured safely through disloyal timeâ Lays of a sweeter tongue and fairer clime; Pure as thy dreams, before our passion sought And won the shadowy realm, and steeped thy sleep In fiery visions and terrific throes Of self-consuming love? My songs are foes To peace and thee; yet thou dost bid me sweep The torturing strings, although thy eyelids weep: Find'st thou a pleasure in thy very woes? [I know art hardens what my love would speak] I know art hardens what my love would speak, And bounds my feelings with a rigid line Of measured rhymes, whose narrow laws confine My forward passions, making cold and weak The warm rich currents that forever seek An outlet from my heart. The loss is thineâ To taste but water where you hoped for wine; But mine the shameful burning of the cheekâ Mine the cruel sorrow o'er a fruitless deed, Who boasted nobly how sublime a thing Should bloom from love, and decorate the Spring With beauties suited aptly to the seed From whence it grew;âbut grew a sightless weed, Shaming the hand that makes the offering. [Yet, love, forgive thy Poet if his lays] Yet, love, forgive thy Poet if his lays Faint with a burden which they cannot bear; And vain regret, and miserable despair, Are the sole offsprings of my weak essays. To paint a passion that so strongly sways My lowly heart, I should be master where I feel myself but slave, and scarcely dare Lift up my eyes to what my hand portrays. Forgive my feeble efforts: and believe Feeling o'ermasters art; and conquered art, Like a true slave, works on with heavy heart, Slighting its ordered task. Then, do not grieve At my cold words; but say my words deceive, Reaching at that which words cannot impart. [O! for some spirit, some magnetic spark] O! for some spirit, some magnetic spark, That used nor word, nor rhyme, nor balanced pause Of doubtful phrase, which so supinely draws My barren verse, and blurs love's shining mark With misty fancies!âO! to burst the dark Of smothered feeling with some new-found laws, Hidden in nature, that might bridge the flaws Between two beings, end this endless cark, And make hearts know what lips have never said! O! for some spell, by which one soul might move With echoes from another, and dispread Contagious music through its chords, above The touch of mimic art: that thou might tread Beneath thy feet this wordy show of love! [There is a sorrow underlies mere grief] There is a sorrow underlies mere grief, A gnawing woe beyond the source of tears, A weary pain with neither hopes nor fears, A dull, dead load that cannot find relief In running eyes, whose passions are as brief As their o'erflowings. For each tear-drop clears The heart from which it issues, and oft cheers With sunny dew the gloomiest cypress-leaf. But, ah! my care sticks ever at the heart, Haunts every thought, and deadens every sense; Sighs are in vain, tears come not, and the tense Cords of existence strain, yet will not part Their stubborn hold on earth. O! bitter smart, To call thee mine, who must be ever hence. [To love thee absent were sufficient pain] To love thee absent were sufficient pain, Even though that pain might not outlast a day; And with to-morrow's sunset I could say, âLo! moonrise comes, and love shines out again!â Or stretch the term a week; I might restrain This heart until the Sabbath morn should lay Its peace upon it. Months might glide away; And I could count the sunshine and the rain, And sum them up in flowers, to prophesy Thy fragrant coming. Though a year would be A weary time, I could wait patiently To hear Christ's birthday clamored through the sky By the rejoicing bells: but who shall try To fix time's measures on eternity? [Why should I cheat my heart with open lies] Why should I cheat my heart with open lies, Summoned by Fancy from her teeming store?â Why call thee mine alone forevermore, Yet know what distance parts, what fate defies Our mutual love? True, we are joined by ties That girdle earth, and bind fate's functions o'er To sovereign love: but shall I not deplore That I no longer look into thy eyesâ Bask in thy presenceâfill my aching soul With love's sweet calm?âOr all my senses thrill With kisses gathered here and there at will, As flowers in spring-time, till we touch the goal Of more than mortal ecstasy, and roll In joys that make the wondering gods stand still? [Ah! let me live on memories of old] Ah! let me live on memories of old,â The precious relics I have set aside From life's poor venture; things that yet abide My ill-paid labor, shining, like pure gold, Amid the dross of cheated hopes whose hold Dropped at the touch of action. Let me glide Down the smooth past, review that day of pride When each to each our mutual passion toldâ When love grew frenzy in thy blazing eye, Fear shone heroic, caution quailed before My hot, resistless kissesâwhen we bore Time, conscience, destiny, down, down for aye, Beneath victorious love, and thou didst cry, âStrike, God! life's cup is running o'er and o'er!â [In vain to thee I stretch imploring arms] In vain to thee I stretch imploring arms Across the hollow waste of barren night; In vain I task my jaded eyes for sight Of some fair vision, whose imagined charms May mimic thine. My bitter knowledge warms Against my fancy. Love draws no delight From self-delusion; and a hateful flight Of stinging truths around my senses swarms, Forcing thy absence on me. Idle dreams Trouble my slumbers; but when any ray Of thy bright presence through the darkness beams, I start and wake, as though the height of day Flamed on my eyelids: for it only seems That I must love, and thou be far away. [Time shall not dry thy ever-falling tears] Time shall not dry thy ever-falling tears For me, thou lone one! sorrowing o'er the ill That tortures thee, and can do aught but kill. I will pursue thee through the bitter years, A loathful shadow, following thee still, Dragged after thee against my better will; Struck by the burning hand which God uprears Against our sin; and doomed o'er vale and hill To dog thy feet, to trail my blackness o'er Thy brightest path, to make the flowers assume A dull, sick look, to wrap in horrid gloom All things around thee, till the awful store Of vengeance on our crime be poured no more, And we together sink into the tomb. [I do not sorrow that thy love was cast] I do not sorrow that thy love was cast On one unworthy of thy purer thought; Nor that the promise of thy youth was brought To barren issue by the deadly blast That plagued the heart to which thy heart held fast, And in the rarest gift of nature wrought A noxious canker, mocking thee who sought To find a sweetness in it. If the past Were passed indeed; and thou, away from me, Couldst gather bloom, and for the future nurse Thy withered youth to beauty; or rehearse, Some day, the moral of thy grief, and be From the infection of my influence free,â 'T were well, but I pursue thee like a curse. [I heard a voice that through the midnight cried] I heard a voice that through the midnight cried, âThy peace is gone, thy sweet content is fled! Never again,â the phantom prophet said, âShalt thou taste joy; for love to thee has died, And naught of love remaineth, now, beside His ashes and thy sorrow. Where is sped The shaft you shot? Has not your bosom bled, By your own hand transpierced?â O! thou hast liedâ O! viewless phantom, thou hast lied to me! Love is immortal as this crown of bay, Which from my brow upon his tomb I layâ Love is immortal in my memory! And I will watch his relics, weep and pray, And from my heart sing his sad elegy. [Like old King Hamlet sleeping in the flowers] Like old King Hamlet sleeping in the flowers, O'er-arched with woodbine and the clustering rose, I lay supine in odorous repose, Safe, as I thought, amid my garden bowers: While with light footsteps tripped the smiling hours, And my heart fluttered with the rapturous throes Of such a dream of joy as, haply, flows Past the closed eyelids of the musing powers Who rest in Edenâwith a dream of thee. Anon upon me, with accursÃ©d bane, Fate stole on tiptoe, and through ear and brain Poured his foul poison. Wild with agony, I shriek, I wake, I would but cannot flee; Then helpless fall, no more to dream again. [No forward step in all my history] No forward step in all my history, Through the wide region of my coming life, But shall resound, above the din and strife Of every action, with the fame of thee. No lyric song, no stately tragedy, No cry of joy nor pain, but shall be rife With thy sweet self. More close than man to wife Shall we be joined through all futurity. Doubt not the issue. While my melody Shall move the world, in each applauded lay Men shall behold my love's undimmed display; And when the troubles of our life shall be Laid in the dust, the sorrows of to-day Shall be the glory of thy memory. [I will not blazon forth thy sacred name] I will not blazon forth thy sacred name, Holding thee up for wonder to the mood Of those poor fools whose darts of malice strewed Thy path of life, and might thy grave defame; I will but hint it dimly. Love's pure flame Will shine as brightly, though the spicy wood Whereon it feeds be little understood; For, to all light man's reverence is the same. And if, in coming time, some lover weep Over the sorrows of my mournful lineâ Some wretch whose fortune has been sad as mineâ Wondering, meanwhile, what gentle name may sleep Under my phrase, the homage shall be thine, Though my sealed lips thy mystic title keep. [As a sad hermit in his cloistered cell] As a sad hermit in his cloistered cell, With the lone image of his martyred Lord, The last, best treasure of a wasted hoard, Do I alone with thy dear image dwell. To thee alone my sinking heart shall swell, To thee alone my scalding tears be poured; And to such vows as thou didst once accord I'll shape my faith to thee invisible. And when Death's hand within my own be pressedâ Welcome as friendship's cordial pressureâI Will grasp his icy fingers, doubly blest; And down to happy dreams of thee will lie, With thy sweet promise cradled in my breast, With thy sweet image beaming in my eye. [Only through this, this precious gift of song] Only through this, this precious gift of song, Can I hold converse with my lady now. For many a threat, and many a lowering brow, Are raised between us; and the ruthless thong Of slander hisses through the air, to wrong Her tender nature. To the storm I bow; But, like a reed, the fiercer tempests grow, The clearer is my singing. Ah! the throng Of heedless men, who in my music hear Only the echoes of their hearts, and see Their petty loves reflected back from me, Know not that every tone is meant to cheer The dismal fortune of thy history,â Know not, dear heart, I'm whispering in thy ear. [Fate, of all seasons, chose the happy time] Fate, of all seasons, chose the happy time When the bud swells, the golden grasses spring, The loosened brooks for their new freedom sing, The blue-bird carols, and the poet's rhyme Renews its wasted nature; when, sublime With his own power, day's rich and generous king Wheels on in state, and all the land doth fling The flowery tributes of its loyal clime Before the light of his triumphant smile:â Ah! then the hand of fell intruding Fate Struck me the blow that made me desolate; Nor yet content, with unrelenting guile, He chose this time, to wreak his fury vile, And with fair Spring bemocked my fallen state. [I shall be faithful, though the weary years] I shall be faithful, though the weary years Spread out before me like a mountain chain, Rugged and steep, ascending from the plain, Without a path; though where the cliff uprears Its sternest front, and echoes in my ears My own deep sobs of solitary pain, It is my fate to scale; though all in vain I spend my labor, and my idle tears Torture but me: I know, despite my ill, That with each step a little wastes awayâ A little of this life wastes day by day; And far beyond the desert which I fill With my vast sorrow, I have faith to say That we shall meet; so I press onward still. [I have not turned for sympathy to friends] I have not turned for sympathy to friends; I have not told the story of my wrong, Nor all the falsehoods that to thee belong,â That shallow-hearted fickleness which sends A pang through all my nature, and oft ends In dreary tears the proudest dream of song. I have not burst the knitted fetters, strong With my own truth, because thy flight offends. What man can say he heard me sigh or groan, Quail at the sound of thy oft-mentioned name, Sneer at thy faith, or stain thy taintless fame With the least breath of slander? No, alone I 've borne the dreadful secret of thy shame, Hiding thy guilt as if it were my own. [Across the waters, through the void of night] Across the waters, through the void of night, My spirit sends its last despairing cry. One moment poised, as in the act to fly, With arms outstretched, and heart that yearns for flight, I bend towards thee. O! hear me, ere the bright And happy impulse fades beneath the eye Of outraged pride, and self-love sullenly Resumes his sceptre! Hear me, ere the blight, With which thy falsehood cankered me, shall fall, Like God's dread judgment, and the clinging stain Add to my sorrow,âpain begot on pain! O, faithless Love! O, perjured heart! O, all Unworthy, yet all loved! if vain my call, Rest, dream, forget!âI shall not call again. [Here let the motions of the world be still] Here let the motions of the world be still!â Here let Time's fleet and tireless pinions stay Their endless flight!âor to the present day Bind my Love's life and mine. I have my fill Of earthly bliss: to move, is to meet ill. Though lavish Fortune in my path might lay Fame, power, and wealth,âthe toys that make the play Of earth's grown children,âI would rather till The stubborn furrows of an arid land, Toil with the brute, bear famine and disease, Drink bitter bondage to the very lees, Than break our union by love's tender band, Or drop its glittering shackles from my hand, To grasp at empty glories such as these. [All the world's malice, all the spite of fate] All the world's malice, all the spite of fate, Cannot undo the rapture of the past. I, like a victor, hold these glories fast; And here defy the envious powers, that wait Upon the crumbling fortunes of our state, To snatch this myrtle chaplet, or to blast Its smallest leaf. Thus to the wind I cast The poet's laurel, and before their date Summon the direst terrors of my doom. For, with this myrtle symbol of my love, I reign exultant, and am fixed above The petty fates that other joys consume. As on a flowery path, through life I'll move,â As through an arch of triumph, pass the tomb.</field>
