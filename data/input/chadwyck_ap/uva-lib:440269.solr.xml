      <field name="fulltext">BATTLE-PIECES THE PORTENT (1859) Hanging from the beam, Slowly swaying (such the law), Gaunt the shadow on your green, Shenandoah! The cut is on the crown (Lo, John Brown), And the stabs shall heal no more. Hidden in the cap Is the anguish none can draw; So your future veils its face, Shenandoah! But the streaming beard is shown (Weird John Brown), The meteor of the war. MISGIVINGS (1860) When ocean-clouds over inland hills Sweep storming in late autumn brown, And horror the sodden valley fills, And the spire falls crashing in the town, I muse upon my country's illsâ The tempest bursting from the waste of Time On the world's fairest hope linked with man's foulest crime. Nature's dark side is heeded nowâ (Ah! optimist-cheer disheartened flown)â A child may read the moody brow Of yon black mountain lone. With shouts the torrents down the gorges go, And storms are formed behind the storm we feel: The hemlock shakes in the rafter, the oak in the driving keel. THE CONFLICT OF CONVICTIONS (1860â1) On starry heights A bugle wails the long recall; Derision stirs the deep abyss, Heaven's ominous silence over all. Return, return, O eager Hope, And face man's latter fall. Events, they make the dreamers quail; Satan's old age is strong and hale, A disciplined captain, gray in skill, And Raphael a white enthusiast still; Dashed aims, whereat Christ's martyrs pale, Shall Mammon's slaves fulfill? (Dismantle the fort, Cut down the fleetâ Battle no more shall be! While the fields for fight in Ã¦ons to come Congeal beneath the sea.) The terrors of truth and dart of death To faith alike are vain; Though comets, gone a thousand years, Return again, Patient she standsâshe can no moreâ And waits, nor heeds she waxes hoar. (At a stony gate, A statue of stone, Weed overgrownâ Long 'twill wait!) But God His former mind retains, Confirms his old decree; The generations are inured to pains, And strong Necessity Surges, and heaps Time's strand with wrecks. The People spread like a weedy grass, The thing they will they bring to pass, And prosper to the apoplex. The rout it herds around the heart, The ghost is yielded in the gloom; Kings wag their headsâNow save thyself Who wouldst rebuild the world in bloom. (Tide-mark And top of the ages' strife, Verge where they called the world to come, The last advance of lifeâ Ha ha, the rust on the Iron Dome!) Nay, but revere the hid event; In the cloud a sword is girded on, I mark a twinkling in the tent Of Michael the warrior one. Senior wisdom suits not now, The light is on the youthful brow. (Ay, in caves the miner see: His forehead bears a taper dim; Darkness so he feebly braves Which foldeth him!) But He who rules is oldâis old; Ah! faith is warm, but heaven with age is cold. (Ho ho, ho, ho, The cloistered doubt Of olden times Is blurted out!) The Ancient of Days forever is young, Forever the scheme of Nature thrives; I know a wind in purpose strongâ It spins against the way it drives. What if the gulfs their slimed foundations bare? So deep must the stones be hurled Whereon the throes of ages rear The final empire and the happier world. (The poor old Past, The Future's slave, She dredged through pain and crime To bring about the blissful Prime, Thenâperished. There's a grave!) Power unanointed may comeâ Dominion (unsought by the free) And the Iron Dome, Stronger for stress and strain, Fling her huge shadow athwart the main; But the Founders' dream shall flee. Age after age shall be As age after age has been, (From man's changeless heart their way they win); And death be busy with all who striveâ Death, with silent negative. YEA AND NAYâ EACH HATH HIS SAY; BUT GOD HE KEEPS THE MIDDLE WAY. NONE WAS BY WHEN HE SPREAD THE SKY; WISDOM IS VAIN, AND PROPHESY. APATHY AND ENTHUSIASM (1860â1) I O the clammy cold November, And the winter white and dead, And the terror dumb with stupor, And the sky a sheet of lead; And events that came resounding With the cry that All was lost, Like the thunder-cracks of massy ice In intensity of frostâ Bursting one upon another Through the horror of the calm. The paralysis of arm In the anguish of the heart; And the hollowness and dearth. The appealings of the mother To brother and to brother Not in hatred so to partâ And the fissure in the hearth Growing momently more wide. Then the glances 'tween the Fates, And the doubt on every side, And the patience under gloom In the stoniness that waits The finality of doom. II So the winter died despairing, And the weary weeks of Lent; And the ice-bound rivers melted, And the tomb of Faith was rent. O, the rising of the People Came with springing of the grass, They rebounded from dejection After Easter came to pass. And the young were all elation Hearing Sumter's cannon roar. And they thought how tame the Nation In the age that went before. And Michael seemed gigantical, The Arch-fiend but a dwarf; And at the towers of Erebus Our striplings flung the scoff. But the elders with foreboding Mourned the days forever o'er, And recalled the forest proverb, The Iroquois' old saw: Grief to every graybeard When young Indians lead the war. THE MARCH INTO VIRGINIA ENDING IN THE FIRST MANASSAS (July, 1861) Did all the lets and bars appear To every just or larger end, Whence should come the trust and cheer? Youth must its ignorant impulse lendâ Age finds place in the rear. All wars are boyish, and are fought by boys, The champions and enthusiasts of the state: Turbid ardors and vain joys Not barrenly abateâ Stimulants to the power mature, Preparatives of fate. Who here forecasteth the event? What heart but spurns at precedent And warnings of the wise, Contemned foreclosures of surprise? The banners play, the bugles call, The air is blue and prodigal. No berrying party, pleasure-wooed, No picnic party in the May, Ever went less loth than they Into that leafy neighborhood. In Bacchic glee they file toward Fate, Moloch's uninitiate; Expectancy, and glad surmise Of battle's unknown mysteries. All they feel is this: 'tis glory, A rapture sharp, though transitory, Yet lasting in belaureled story. So they gayly go to fight, Chatting left and laughing right. But some who this blithe mood present, As on in lightsome files they fare, Shall die experienced ere three days be spentâ Perish, enlightened by the vollied glare; Or shame survive, and, like to adamant, Thy after shock, Manassas, share. LYON BATTLE OF SPRINGFIELD, MISSOURI (August, 1861) Some hearts there are of deeper sort, Prophetic, sad, Which yet for cause are trebly clad; Known death they fly on: This wizard-heart and heart-of-oak had Lyon. âThey are more than twenty thousand strong, We less than five, Too few with such a host to strive.â âSuch counsel, fie on! 'Tis battle, or 'tis shame;â and firm stood Lyon. âFor help at need in vain we waitâ Retreat or fight: Retreat the foe would take for flight, And each proud scion Feel more elate; the end must come,â said Lyon. By candlelight he wrote the will, And left his all To Her for whom 'twas not enough to fall; Loud neighed Orion Without the tent; drums beat; we marched with Lyon. The night-tramp done, we spied the Vale With guard-fires lit; Day broke, but trooping clouds made gloom of it: âA field to die on,â Presaged, in his unfaltering heart, brave Lyon. We fought on the grass, we bled in the cornâ Fate seemed malign; His horse the Leader led along the lineâ Star-browed Orion; Bitterly fearless, he rallied us there, brave Lyon. There came a sound like the slitting of air By a swift sharp swordâ A rush of the sound; and the sleek chest broad Of black Orion Heaved, and was fixed; the dead mane waved toward Lyon. âGeneral, you're hurtâthis sleet of balls!â He seemed half spent; With moody and bloody brow, he lowly bent: âThe field to die on; But notânot yet; the day is long,â breathed Lyon. For a time becharmed there fell a lull In the heart of the fight; The tree-tops nod, the slain sleep light; Warm noon-winds sigh on, And thoughts which he never spake had Lyon. Texans and Indians trim for a charge: âStand ready, men! Let them come close, right up, and then After the lead, the iron; Fire, and charge back!â So strength returned to Lyon. The Iowa men who held the van, Half drilled, were new To battle: âSome one lead us, then we'll do,â Said Corporal Tryon: âMen! I will lead,â and a light glared in Lyon. On they came: they yelped, and fired; His spirit sped; We levelled right in, and the half-breeds fled, Nor stayed the iron, Nor captured the crimson corse of Lyon. This seer foresaw his soldier-doom, Yet willed the fight. He never turned; his only flight Was up to Zion, Where prophets now and armies greet pale Lyon. BALL'S BLUFF A REVERIE (October, 1861) One noonday, at my window in the town, I saw a sightâsaddest that eyes can seeâ Young soldiers marching lustily Unto the wars, With fifes, and flags in mottoed pageantry; While all the porches, walks, and doors Were rich with ladies cheering royally. They moved like Juny morning on the wave, Their hearts were fresh as clover in its prime (It was the breezy summer time), Life throbbed so strong, How should they dream that Death in a rosy clime Would come to thin their shining throng? Youth feels immortal, like the gods sublime. Weeks passed; and at my window, leaving bed, By night I mused, of easeful sleep bereft, On those brave boys (Ah War! thy theft); Some marching feet Found pause at last by cliffs Potomac cleft; Wakeful I mused, while in the street Far footfalls died away till none were left. DUPONT'S ROUND FIGHT (November, 1861) In time and measure perfect moves All Art whose aim is sure; Evolving rhyme and stars divine Have rules, and they endure. Nor less the Fleet that warred for Right, And, warring so, prevailed, In geometric beauty curved, And in an orbit sailed. The rebel at Port Royal felt The Unity overawe, And rued the spell. A type was here, And victory of Law. THE STONE FLEET AN OLD SAILOR'S LAMENT (December, 1861) I have a feeling for those ships, Each worn and ancient one, With great bluff bows, and broad in the beam: Ay, it was unkindly done. But so they serve the Obsoleteâ Even so, Stone Fleet! You'll say I'm doting; do but think I scudded round the Horn in oneâ The Tenedos, a glorious Good old craft as ever runâ Sunk (how all unmeet!) With the Old Stone Fleet. An India ship of fame was she, Spices and shawls and fans she bore; A whaler when her wrinkles cameâ Turned off! till, spent and poor, Her bones were sold (escheat)! Ah! Stone Fleet. Four were erst patrician keels (Names attest what families be), The Kensington, and Richmond too, Leonidas, and Lee: But now they have their seat With the Old Stone Fleet. To scuttle themâa pirate deedâ Sack them, and dismast; They sunk so slow, they died so hard, But gurgling dropped at last. Their ghosts in gales repeat Woe's us, Stone Fleet! And all for naught. The waters passâ Currents will have their way; Nature is nobody's ally; 'tis well; The harbor is betteredâwill stay. A failure, and complete, Was your Old Stone Fleet. DONELSON (February, 1862) The bitter cup Of that hard countermand Which gave the Envoys up, Still was wormwood in the mouth, And clouds involved the land, When, pelted by sleet in the icy street, About the bulletin-board a band Of eager, anxious people met, And every wakeful heart was set On latest news from West or South. âNo seeing here,â cries oneââdon't crowdââ âYou tall man, pray you, read aloud.â IMPORTANT. We learn that General Grant, Marching from Henry overland, And joined by a force up the Cumberland sent (Some thirty thousand the command), On Wednesday a good position wonâ Began the siege of Donelson. This stronghold crowns a river-bluff, A good broad mile of leveled top; Inland the ground rolls off Deep-gorged, and rocky, and broken upâ A wilderness of trees and brush. The spaded summit shows the roods Of fixed entrenchments in their hush; Breast-works and rifle-pits in woods Perplex the base.â The welcome weather Is clear and mild; 'tis much like May. The ancient boughs that lace together Along the stream, and hang far forth, Strange with green mistletoe, betray A dreamy contrast to the North. Our troops are full of spiritsâsay The siege won't prove a creeping one. They purpose not the lingering stay Of old beleaguerers; not that way; But, full of vim from Western prairies won, They'll make, ere long, a dash at Donelson. Washed by the storm till the paper grew Every shade of a streaky blue, That bulletin stood. The next day brought A second. LATER FROM THE FORT. Grant's investment is completeâ A semicircular one. Both wings the Cumberland's margin meet, Then, backward curving, clasp the rebel seat. On Wednesday this good work was done; But of the doers some lie prone. Each wood, each hill, each glen was fought for; The bold inclosing line we wrought for Flamed with sharpshooters. Each cliff cost A limb or life. But back we forced Reserves and all; made good our hold; And so we rest. Events unfold. On Thursday added ground was won, A long bold steep: we near the Den. Later the foe came shouting down In sortie, which was quelled; and then We stormed them on their left. A chilly change in the afternoon; The sky, late clear, is now bereft Of sun. Last night the ground froze hardâ Rings to the enemy as they run Within their works. A ramrod bites The lip it meets. The cold incites To swinging of arms with brisk rebound. Smart blows 'gainst lusty chests resound. Along the outer line we ward A crackle of skirmishing goes on. Our lads creep round on hand and knee, They fight from behind each trunk and stone; And sometimes, flying for refuge, one Finds 'tis an enemy shares the tree. Some scores are maimed by boughs shot off In the glades by the Fort's big gun. We mourn the loss of Colonel Morrison, Killed while cheering his regiment on. Their far sharpshooters try our stuff; And ours return them puff for puff: 'Tis diamond-cutting-diamond work. Woe on the rebel cannoneer Who shows his head. Our fellows lurk Like Indians that waylay the deer By the wild salt-spring.âThe sky is dun, Foredooming the fall of Donelson. Stern weather is all unwonted here. The people of the country own We brought it. Yea, the earnest North Has elementally issued forth To storm this Donelson. FURTHER. A yelling rout Of ragamuffins broke profuse To-day from out the Fort. Sole uniform they wore, a sort Of patch, or white badge (as you choose) Upon the arm. But leading these, Or mingling, were men of face And bearing of patrician race, Splendid in courage and gold laceâ The officers. Before the breeze Made by their charge, down went our line; But, rallying, charged back in force, And broke the sally; yet with loss. This on the left; upon the right Meanwhile there was an answering fight; Assailants and assailed reversed. The charge too upward, and not downâ Up a steep ridge-side, toward its crown, A strong redoubt. But they who first Gained the fort's base, and marked the trees Felled, heaped in horned perplexities, And shagged with brush; and swarming there Fierce wasps whose sting was present deathâ They faltered, drawing bated breath, And felt it was in vain to dare; Yet still, perforce, returned the ball, Firing into the tangled wall Till ordered to come down. They came; But left some comrades in their fame, Red on the ridge in icy wreath And hanging gardens of cold Death. But not quite unavenged these fell; Our ranks once out of range, a blast Of shrapnel and quick shell Burst on the rebel horde, still massed, Scattering them pell-mell. (This fightingâjudging what we readâ Both charge and countercharge, Would seem but Thursday's told at large, Before in brief reported.âEd.) Night closed in about the Den Murky and lowering. Ere long, chill rains. A night not soon to be forgot, Reviving old rheumatic pains And longings for a cot. No blankets, overcoats, or tents. Coats thrown aside on the warm march hereâ We looked not then for changeful cheer; Tents, coats, and blankets too much care. No fires; a fire a mark presents; Near by, the trees show bullet-dents. Rations were eaten cold and raw. The men well soaked, came snow; and moreâ A midnight sally. Small sleeping doneâ But such is war; No matter, we'll have Fort Donelson. âUgh! ugh! 'Twill drag alongâdrag along,â Growled a cross patriot in the throng, His battered umbrella like an ambulance-cover Riddled with bullet-holes, spattered all over. âHurrah for Grant!â cried a stripling shrill; Three urchins joined him with a will, And some of taller stature cheered. Meantime a Copperhead passed; he sneered. âWin or lose,â he pausing said, âCaps fly the same; all boys, mere boys; Any thing to make a noise. Like to see the list of the dead; These âcraven Southernersâ hold out; Ay, ay, they'll give you many a bout.â âWe'll beat in the end, sir,â Firmly said one in staid rebuke, A solid merchant, square and stout. âAnd do you think it? that way tend, sir?â Asked the lean Copperhead, with a look Of splenetic pity. âYes, I do.â His yellow death's head the croaker shook: âThe country's ruined, that I know.â A shower of broken ice and snow, In lieu of words, confuted him; They saw him hustled round the corner go, And each by-stander saidâWell suited him. Next day another crowd was seen In the dark weather's sleety spleen. Bald-headed to the storm came out A man, who, 'mid a joyous shout, Silently posted this brief sheet: GLORIOUS VICTORY OF THE FLEET! FRIDAY'S GREAT EVENT! THE ENEMY'S WATER-BATTERIES BEAT! WE SILENCED EVERY GUN! THE OLD COMMODORE'S COMPLIMENTS SENT PLUMP INTO DONELSON! âWell, well, go on!â exclaimed the crowd To him who thus much read aloud. âThat's all,â he said. âWhat! nothing more?â âEnough for a cheer, thoughâhip, hurrah! âBut here's old Baldy come againâ âMore news!ââAnd now a different strain. (Our own reporter a dispatch compiles, As best he may, from varied sources.) Large re-enforcements have arrivedâ Munitions, men, and horsesâ For Grant, and all debarked, with stores. The enemy's field-works extend six milesâ The gate still hid; so well contrived. Yesterday stung us; frozen shores Snow-clad, and through the drear defiles And over the desolate ridges blew A Lapland wind. The main affair Was a good two hours' steady fight Between our gun-boats and the Fort. The Louisville's wheel was smashed outright. A hundred-and-twenty-eight-pound ball Came planet-like through a starboard port, Killing three men, and wounding all The rest of that gun's crew, (The captain of the gun was cut in two); Then splintering and ripping wentâ Nothing could be its continent. In the narrow stream the Louisville, Unhelmed, grew lawless; swung around, And would have thumped and drifted, till All the fleet was driven aground, But for the timely order to retire. Some damage from our fire, 'tis thought, Was done the water-batteries of the Fort. Little else took place that day, Except the field artillery in line Would now and thenâfor love, they sayâ Exchange a valentine. The old sharpshooting going on. Some plan afoot as yet unknown; So Friday closed round Donelson. LATER. Great suffering through the nightâ A stinging one. Our heedless boys Were nipped like blossoms. Some dozen Hapless wounded men were frozen. During day being struck down out of sight, And help-cries drowned in roaring noise, They were left just where the skirmish shiftedâ Left in dense underbrush snow-drifted. Some, seeking to crawl in crippled plight, So stiffenedâperished. Yet in spite Of pangs for these, no heart is lost. Hungry, and clothing stiff with frost, Our men declare a nearing sun Shall see the fall of Donelson. And this they say, yet not disown The dark redoubts round Donelson, And ice-glazed corpses, each a stoneâ A sacrifice to Donelson; They swear it, and swerve not, gazing on A flag, deemed black, flying from Donelson. Some of the wounded in the wood Were cared for by the foe last night, Though he could do them little needed good, Himself being all in shivering plight. The rebel is wrong, but human yet; He's got a heart, and thrusts a bayonet. He gives us battle with wondrous willâ This bluff's a perverted Bunker Hill. The stillness stealing through the throng The silent thought and dismal fear revealed; They turned and went, Musing on right and wrong And mysteries dimly sealedâ Breasting the storm in daring discontent; The storm, whose black flag showed in heaven, As if to say no quarter there was given To wounded men in wood, Or true hearts yearning for the goodâ All fatherless seemed the human soul. But next day brought a bitterer bowlâ On the bulletin-board this stood: Saturday morning at 3 A. M. A stir within the Fort betrayed That the rebels were getting under arms; Some plot these early birds had laid. But a lancing sleet cut him who stared Into the storm. After some vague alarms, Which left our lads unscared, Out sallied the enemy at dim of dawn, With cavalry and artillery, and went In fury at our environment. Under cover of shot and shell Three columns of infantry rolled on, Vomited out of Donelsonâ Rolled down the slopes like rivers of hell, Surged at our line, and swelled and poured Like breaking surf. But unsubmerged Our men stood up, except where roared The enemy through one gap. We urged Our all of manhood to the stress, But still showed shattered in our desperateness. Back set the tide, But soon afresh rolled in; And so it swayed from side to sideâ Far batteries joining in the din, Though sharing in another frayâ Till all became an Indian fight, Intricate, dusky, stretching far away, Yet not without spontaneous plan However tangled showed the plight: Duels all over 'tween man and man, Duels on cliff-side, and down in ravine, Duels at long range, and bone to bone; Duels every where flitting and half unseen. Only by courage good as their own, And strength outlasting theirs, Did our boys at last drive the rebels off. Yet they went not back to their distant lairs In strong-hold, but loud in scoff Maintained themselves on conquered groundâ Uplands; built works, or stalked around. Our right wing bore this onset. Noon Brought calm to Donelson. The reader ceased; the storm beat hard; 'Twas day, but the office-gas was lit; Nature retained her sulking-fit, In her hand the shard. Flitting faces took the hue Of that washed bulletin-board in view, And seemed to bear the public grief As private, and uncertain of relief; Yea, many an earnest heart was won, As broodingly he plodded on, To find in himself some bitter thing, Some hardness in his lot as harrowing As Donelson. That night the board stood barren there, Oft eyed by wistful people passing, Who nothing saw but the rain-beads chasing Each other down the wafered square, As down some storm-beat graveyard stone. But next day showedâ MORE NEWS LAST NIGHT. STORY OF SATURDAY AFTERNOON. VICISSITUDES OF THE WAR. The damaged gun-boats can't wage fight For days; so says the Commodore. Thus no diversion can be had. Under a sunless sky of lead Our grim-faced boys in blackened plight Gaze toward the ground they held before, And then on Grant. He marks their mood, And hails it, and will turn the same to good. Spite all that they have undergone, Their desperate hearts are set upon This winter fort, this stubborn fort, This castle of the last resort, This Donelson. 1 P.M. An order given Requires withdrawal from the front Of regiments that bore the brunt Of morning's fray. Their ranks all riven Are being replaced by fresh, strong men. Great vigilance in the foeman's Den; He snuffs the stormers. Need it is That for that fell assault of his, That rout inflicted, and self-scornâ Immoderate in noble natures, torn By sense of being through slackness overborneâ The rebel be given a quick return: The kindest face looks now half stern. Balked of their prey in airs that freeze, Some fierce ones glare like savages. And yet, and yet, strange moments areâ Wellâblood, and tears, and anguished War! The morning's battle-ground is seen In lifted glades, like meadows rare; The blood-drops on the snow-crust there Like clover in the white-weed showâ Flushed fields of death, that call againâ Call to our men, and not in vain, For that way must the stormers go. 3 P.M. The work begins. Light drifts of men thrown forward, fade In skirmish-line along the slope, Where some dislodgments must be made Ere the stormer with the strong-hold cope. Lew Wallace, moving to retake The heights late lostâ (Herewith a break. Storms at the West derange the wires. Doubtless, ere morning, we shall hear The end; we look for news to cheerâ Let Hope fan all her fires.) Next day in large bold hand was seen The closing bulletin: VICTORY! Our troops have retrieved the day By one grand surge along the line; The spirit that urged them was divine. The first works flooded, naught could stay The stormers: on! still on! Bayonets for Donelson! Over the ground that morning lost Rolled the blue billows, tempest-tossed, Following a hat on the point of a sword. Spite shell and round-shot, grape and canister, Up they climbed without rail or banisterâ Up the steep hill-sides long and broad, Driving the rebel deep within his works. 'Tis nightfall; not an enemy lurks In sight. The chafing men Fret for more fight: âTo-night, to-night let us take the Den!â But night is treacherous, Grant is wary; Of brave blood be a little chary. Patience! The Fort is good as won; To-morrow, and into Donelson. LATER AND LAST. THE FORT IS OURS. A flag came out at early morn Bringing surrender. From their towers Floats out the banner late their scorn. In Dover, hut and house are full Of rebels dead or dying. The National flag is flying From the crammed court-house pinnacle. Great boat-loads of our wounded go To-day to Nashville. The sleet-winds blow; But all is right: the fight is won, The winter-fight for Donelson. Hurrah! The spell of old defeat is broke, The habit of victory begun; Grant strikes the war's first sounding stroke At Donelson. For lists of killed and wounded, see The morrow's dispatch: to-day 'tis victory. The man who read this to the crowd Shouted as the end he gained; And though the unflagging tempest rained, They answered him aloud. And hand grasped hand, and glances met In happy triumph; eyes grew wet. O, to the punches brewed that night Went little water. Windows bright Beamed rosy on the sleet without, And from the cross street came the frequent shout; While some in prayer, as these in glee, Blessed heaven for the winter-victory. But others were who wakeful laid In midnight beds, and early rose, And, feverish in the foggy snows, Snatched the damp paperâwife and maid. The death-list like a river flows Down the pale sheet, And there the whelming waters meet. Ah God! may Time with happy haste Bring wail and triumph to a waste, And war be done; The battle flag-staff fall athwart The curs'd ravine, and wither; naught Be left of trench or gun; The bastion, let it ebb away, Washed with the river bed; and Day In vain seek Donelson. THE CUMBERLAND (March, 1862) Some names there are of telling sound, Whose voweled syllables free Are pledge that they shall ever live renowned; Such seems to be A Frigate's name (by present glory spanned)â The Cumberland. Sounding name as ere was sung, Flowing, rolling on the tongueâ Cumberland! Cumberland! She warred and sunk. There's no denying That she was endedâquelled; And yet her flag above her fate is flying, As when it swelled Unswallowed by the swallowing sea: so grandâ The Cumberland. Goodly name as ere was sung, Roundly rolling on the tongueâ Cumberland! Cumberland! What need to tell how she was foughtâ The sinking flaming gunâ The gunner leaping out the portâ Washed back, undone! Her dead unconquerably manned The Cumberland. Noble name as ere was sung, Slowly roll it on the tongueâ Cumberland! Cumberland! Long as hearts shall share the flame Which burned in that brave crew, Her fame shall liveâoutlive the victor's name; For this is due. Your flag and flag-staff shall in story standâ Cumberland! Sounding name as ere was sung, Long they'll roll it on the tongueâ Cumberland! Cumberland! IN THE TURRET (March, 1862) Your honest heart of duty, Worden, So helped you that in fame you dwell; You bore the first iron battle's burden Sealed as in a diving-bell. Alcides, groping into haunted hell To bring forth King Admetus' bride, Braved naught more vaguely direful and untried. What poet shall uplift his charm, Bold Sailor, to your height of daring, And interblend therewith the calm, And build a goodly style upon your bearing. Escaped the gale of outer oceanâ Cribbed in a craft which like a log Was washed by every billow's motionâ By night you heard of Og The huge; nor felt your courage clog At tokens of his onset grim: You marked the sunk ship's flag-staff slim, Lit by her burning sister's heart; You marked, and mused: âDay brings the trial: Then be it proved if I have part With men whose manhood never took denial.â A prayer went upâa champion's. Morning Beheld you in the Turret walled By adamant, where a spirit forewarning And all-deriding called: âMan, darest thouâdesperate, unappalledâ Be first to lock thee in the armored tower? I have thee now; and what the battle-hour To me shall bringâheed wellâthou'lt share; This plot-work, planned to be the foeman's terror, To thee may prove a goblin-snare; Its very strength and cunningâmonstrous error!â âStand up, my heart; be strong; what matter If here thou seest thy welded tomb? And let huge Og with thunders batterâ Duty be still my doom, Though drowning come in liquid gloom; First duty, duty next, and duty last; Ay, Turret, rivet me here to duty fast!ââ So nerved, you fought, wisely and well; And live, twice live in life and story; But over your Monitor dirges swell, In wind and wave that keep the rites of glory. THE TEMERAIRE (SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED TO AN ENGLISHMAN OF THE OLD ORDER BY THE FIGHT OF THE MONITOR AND MERRIMAC) The gloomy hulls, in armor grim, Like clouds o'er moors have met, And prove that oak, and iron, and man Are tough in fibre yet. But Splendors wane. The sea-fight yields No front of old display; The garniture, emblazonment, And heraldry all decay. Towering afar in parting light, The fleets like Albion's forelands shineâ The full-sailed fleets, the shrouded show Of Ships-of-the-Line. The fighting Temeraire, Built of a thousand trees, Lunging out her lightnings, And beetling o'er the seasâ O Ship, how brave and rare, That fought so oft and well, On open decks you manned the gun Armorial. What cheerings did you share, Impulsive in the van, When down upon leagued France and Spain We English ranâ The freshet at your bowsprit Like the foam upon the can. Bickering, your colors Licked up the Spanish air, You flapped with flames of battle-flagsâ Your challenge, Temeraire! The rear ones of our fleet They yearned to share your place, Still vying with the Victory Throughout that earnest raceâ The Victory, whose Admiral, With orders nobly won, Shone in the globe of the battle glowâ The angel in that sun. Parallel in story, Lo, the stately pair, As late in grapple ranging, The foe between them thereâ When four great hulls lay tiered, And the fiery tempest cleared, And your prizes twain appeared, Temeraire! But Trafalgar' is over now, The quarter-deck undone; The carved and castled navies fire Their evening-gun. O, Titan Temeraire, Your stern-lights fade away; Your bulwarks to the years must yield, And heart-of-oak decay. A pigmy steam-tug tows you, Gigantic, to the shoreâ Dismantled of your guns and spars, And sweeping wings of war. The rivets clinch the iron-clads, Men learn a deadlier lore; But Fame has nailed your battle-flagsâ Your ghost it sails before: O, the navies old and oaken, O, the Temeraire no more! A UTILITARIAN VIEW OF THE MONITOR'S FIGHT Plain be the phrase, yet apt the verse, More ponderous than nimble; For since grimed War here laid aside His painted pomp, 'twould ill befit Overmuch to ply The rhyme's barbaric cymbal. Hail to victory without the gaud Of glory; zeal that needs no fans Of banners; plain mechanic power Plied cogently in War now placedâ Where War belongsâ Among the trades and artisans. Yet this was battle, and intenseâ Beyond the strife of fleets heroic; Deadlier, closer, calm 'mid storm; No passion; all went on by crank, Pivot, and screw, And calculations of caloric. Needless to dwell; the story's known. The ringing of those plates on plates Still ringeth round the worldâ The clangor of that blacksmiths' fray. The anvil-din Resounds this message from the Fates: War yet shall be, and to the end; But war-paint shows the streaks of weather; War yet shall be, but warriors Are now but operatives; War's made Less grand than Peace, And a singe runs through lace and feather. SHILOH A REQUIEM (April, 1862) Skimming lightly, wheeling still, The swallows fly low Over the field in clouded days, The forest-field of Shilohâ Over the field where April rain Solaced the parched ones stretched in pain Through the pause of night That followed the Sunday fight Around the church of Shilohâ The church so lone, the log-built one, That echoed to many a parting groan And natural prayer Of dying foemen mingled thereâ Foemen at morn, but friends at eveâ Fame or country least their care: (What like a bullet can undeceive!) But now they lie low, While over them the swallows skim, And all is hushed at Shiloh. THE BATTLE FOR THE MISSISSIPPI (April, 1862) When Israel camped by Migdol hoar, Down at her feet her shawm she threw, But Moses sung and timbrels rung For Pharaoh's stranded crew. So God appears in apt eventsâ The Lord is a man of war! So the strong wing to the muse is given In victory's roar. Deep be the ode that hymns the fleetâ The fight by nightâthe fray Which bore our Flag against the powerful stream, And led it up to day. Dully through din of larger strife Shall bay that warring gun; But none the less to us who live It pealsâan echoing one. The shock of ships, the jar of walls, The rush through thick and thinâ The flaring fire-rafts, glare and gloomâ Eddies, and shells that spinâ The boom-chain burst, the hulks dislodged, The jam of gun-boats driven, Or fired, or sunkâmade up a war Like Michael's waged with leven. The manned Varuna stemmed and quelled The odds which hard beset; The oaken flag-ship, half ablaze, Passed on and thundered yet; While foundering, gloomed in grimy flame, The Ram Manassasâhark the yell!â Plunged, and was gone; in joy or fright, The River gave a startled swell. They fought through lurid dark till dawn; The war-smoke rolled away With clouds of night, and showed the fleet In scarred yet firm array, Above the forts, above the drift Of wrecks which strife had made; And Farragut sailed up to the town And anchoredâsheathed the blade. The moody broadsides, brooding deep, Hold the lewd mob at bay, While o'er the armed decks' solemn aisles The meek church-pennons play; By shotted guns the sailors stand, With foreheads bound or bare; The captains and the conquering crews Humble their pride in prayer. They pray; and after victory, prayer Is meet for men who mourn their slain; The living shall unmoor and sail, But Death's dark anchor secret deeps detain. Yet Glory slants her shaft of rays Far through the undisturbed abyss; There must be other, nobler worlds for them Who nobly yield their lives in this. MALVERN HILL (July, 1862) Ye elms that wave on Malvern Hill In prime of morn and May, Recall ye how McClellan's men Here stood at bay? While deep within yon forest dim Our rigid comrades layâ Some with the cartridge in their mouth, Others with fixed arms lifted Southâ Invoking so The cypress glades? Ah wilds of woe! The spires of Richmond, late beheld Through rifts in musket-haze, Were closed from view in clouds of dust On leaf-walled ways, Where streamed our wagons in caravan; And the Seven Nights and Days Of march and fast, retreat and fight, Pinched our grimed faces to ghastly plightâ Does the elm wood Recall the haggard beards of blood? The battle-smoked flag, with stars eclipsed, We followed (it never fell!)â In silence husbanded our strengthâ Received their yell; Till on this slope we patient turned With cannon ordered well; Reverse we proved was not defeat; But ah, the sod what thousands meet!â Does Malvern Wood Bethink itself, and muse and brood? We elms of Malvern Hill Remember every thing; But sap the twig will fill: Wag the world how it will, Leaves must be green in Spring. THE VICTOR OF ANTIETAM (1862) When tempest winnowed grain from bran, And men were looking for a man, Authority called you to the van, McClellan: Along the line the plaudit ran, As later when Antietam's cheers began. Through storm-cloud and eclipse must move Each Cause and Man, dear to the stars and Jove; Nor always can the wisest tell Deferred fulfillment from the hopeless knellâ The struggler from the floundering ner'er-do-well. A pall-cloth on the Seven Days fell, McClellan:â Unprosperously heroical! Who could Antietam's wreath foretell? Authority called you; then, in mist And loom of jeopardyâdismissed. But staring peril soon appalled; You, the Discarded, she recalledâ Recalled you, nor endured delay; And forth you rode upon a blasted way, Arrayed Pope's rout, and routed Lee's array, McClellan: Your tent was choked with captured flags that day, McClellan. Antietam was a telling fray. Recalled you; and she heard your drum Advancing through the ghastly gloom. You manned the wall, you propped the Dome, You stormed the powerful stormer home, McClellan: Antietam's cannon long shall boom. At Alexandria, left alone, McClellanâ Your veterans sent from you, and thrown To fields and fortunes all unknownâ What thoughts were yours, revealed to none, While faithful still you labored onâ Hearing the far Manassas gun! McClellan, Only Antietam could atone. You fought in the front (an evil day, McClellan)â The fore-front of the first assay; The Cause went sounding, groped its way; The leadsmen quarrelled in the bay; Quills thwarted swords; divided sway; The rebel flushed in his lusty May: You did your best, as in you lay, McClellan. Antietam's sun-burst sheds a ray. Your medalled soldiers love you well, McClellan: Name your name, their true hearts swell; With you they shook dread Stonewall's spell, With you they braved the blended yell Of rebel and maligner fell; With you in shame or fame they dwell, McClellan: Antietam-braves a brave can tell. And when your comrades (now so few, McClellanâ Such ravage in deep files they rue) Meet round the board, and sadly view The empty places; tribute due They render to the deadâand you! Absent and silent o'er the blue; The one-armed lift the wine to you, McClellan, And great Antietam's cheers renew. BATTLE OF STONE RIVER, TENNESSEE A VIEW FROM OXFORD CLOISTERS (January, 1863) With Tewksbury and Barnet heath In days to come the field shall blend, The story dim and date obscure; In legend all shall end. Even now, involved in forest shade A Druid-dream the strife appears, The fray of yesterday assumes The haziness of years. In North and South still beats the vein Of Yorkist and Lancastrian. Our rival Roses warred for Swayâ For Sway, but named the name of Right; And Passion, scorning pain and death, Lent sacred fervor to the fight. Each lifted up a broidered cross, While crossing blades profaned the sign; Monks blessed the fratricidal lance, And sisters scarfs could twine. Do North and South the sin retain Of Yorkist and Lancastrian? But Rosecrans in the cedarn glade, And, deep in denser cypress gloom, Dark Breckinridge, shall fade away Or thinly loom. The pale throngs who in forest cowed Before the spell of battle's pause, Forefelt the stillness that shall dwell On them and on their wars. North and South shall join the train Of Yorkist and Lancastrian. But where the sword has plunged so deep, And then been turned within the wound By deadly Hate; where Climes contend On vasty groundâ No warning Alps or seas between, And small the curb of creed or law, And blood is quick, and quick the brain; Shall North and South their rage deplore, And reunited thrive amain Like Yorkist and Lancastrian? RUNNING THE BATTERIES AS OBSERVED FROM THE ANCHORAGE ABOVE VICKSBURGH (April, 1863) A moonless nightâa friendly one; A haze dimmed the shadowy shore As the first lampless boat slid silent on; Hist! and we spake no more; We but pointed, and stilly, to what we saw. We felt the dew, and seemed to feel The secret like a burden laid. The first boat melts; and a second keel Is blent with the foliaged shadeâ Their midnight rounds have the rebel officers made? Unspied as yet. A thirdâa fourthâ Gunboat and transport in Indian file Upon the war-path, smooth from the North; But the watch may they hope to beguile? The manned river-batteries stretch for mile on mile. A flame leaps out; they are seen; Another and another gun roars; We tell the course of the boats through the screen By each further fort that pours, And we guess how they jump from their beds on those shrouded shores. Converging fires. We speak, though low: âThat blastful furnace can they thread?â âWhy, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego Came out all right, we read; The Lord, be sure, he helps his people, Ned.â How we strain our gaze. On bluffs they shun A golden growing flames appearsâ Confirms to a silvery steadfast one: âThe town is afire!â crows Hugh: âthree cheers!â Lot stops his mouth: âNay, lad, better three tears.â A purposed light; it shows our fleet; Yet a little late in its searching ray, So far and strong, that in phantom cheat Lank on the deck our shadows lay; The shining flag-ship stings their guns to furious play. How dread to mark her near the glare And glade of death the beacon throws Athwart the racing waters there; One by one each plainer grows, Then speeds a blazoned target to our gladdened foes. The impartial cresset lights as well The fixed forts to the boats that run; And, plunged from their ports, their answers swell Back to each fortress dun: Ponderous words speaks every monster gun. Fearless they flash through gates of flame, The salamanders hard to hit, Though vivid shows each bulky frame; And never the batteries intermit, Nor the boats huge guns; they fire and flit. Anon a lull. The beacon dies: âAre they out of that strait accurst?â But other flames now dawning rise, Not mellowly brilliant like the first, But rolled in smoke, whose whitish volumes burst. A baleful brand, a hurrying torch Whereby anew the boats are seenâ A burning transport all alurch! Breathless we gaze; yet still we glean Glimpses of beauty as we eager lean. The effulgence takes an amber glow Which bathes the hill-side villas far; Affrighted ladies mark the show Painting the pale magnoliaâ The fair, false, Circe light of cruel War. The barge drifts doomed, a plague-struck one. Shoreward in yawls the sailors fly. But the gauntlet now is nearly run, The spleenful forts by fits reply, And the burning boat dies down in morning's sky. All out of range. Adieu, Messieurs! Jeers, as it speeds, our parting gun. So burst we through their barriers And menaces every one: So Porter proves himself a brave man's son. STONEWALL JACKSON MORTALLY WOUNDED AT CHANCELLORSVILLE (May, 1863) The Man who fiercest charged in fight, Whose sword and prayer were longâ Stonewall! Even him who stoutly stood for Wrong, How can we praise? Yet coming days Shall not forget him with this song. Dead is the Man whose Cause is dead, Vainly he died and set his sealâ Stonewall! Earnest in error, as we feel; True to the thing he deemed was due, True as John Brown or steel. Relentlessly he routed us; But we relent, for he is lowâ Stonewall! Justly his fame we outlaw; so We drop a tear on the bold Virginian's bier, Because no wreath we owe. STONEWALL JACKSON (ASCRIBED TO A VIRGINIAN) One man we claim of wrought renown Which not the North shall care to slur; A Modern lived who sleeps in death, Calm as the marble Ancients are: 'Tis he whose life, though a vapor's wreath, Was charged with the lightning's burning breathâ Stonewall, stormer of the war. But who shall hymn the Roman heart? A stoic he, but even more: The iron will and lion thew Were strong to inflict as to endure: Who like him could stand, or pursue? His fate the fatalist followed through; In all his great soul found to do Stonewall followed his star. He followed his star on the Romney march Through the sleet to the wintry war; And he followed it on when he bowed the grainâ The Wind of the Shenandoah; At Gaines's Mill in the giants' strainâ On the fierce forced stride to Manassas-plain, Where his sword with thunder was clothed again, Stonewall followed his star. His star he followed athwart the flood To Potomac's Northern shore, When midway wading, his host of braves âMy Maryland!â loud did roarâ To red Antietam's field of graves, Through mountain-passes, woods and waves, They followed their pagod with hymns and glaives, For Stonewall followed a star. Back it led him to Marye's slope, Where the shock and the fame he bore; And to green Moss-Neck it guided himâ Brief respite from throes of war: To the laurel glade by the Wilderness grim, Through climaxed victory naught shall dim, Even unto death it piloted himâ Stonewall followed his star. Its lead he followed in gentle ways Which never the valiant mar; A cap we sent him, bestarred, to replace The sun-scorched helm of war: A fillet he made of the shining lace Childhood's laughing brow to graceâ Not his was a goldsmith's star. O, much of doubt in after days Shall cling, as now, to the war; Of the right and the wrong they'll still debate, Puzzled by Stonewall's star: âFortune went with the North elate,â âAy, but the South had Stonewall's weight, And he fell in the South's great war.â GETTYSBURG THE CHECK (July, 1863) O pride of the days in prime of the months Now trebled in great renown, When before the ark of our holy cause Fell Dagon downâ Dagon foredoomed, who, armed and targed, Never his impious heart enlarged Beyond that hour; God walled his power, And there the last invader charged. He charged, and in that charge condensed His all of hate and all of fire; He sought to blast us in his scorn, And wither us in his ire. Before him went the shriek of shellsâ Aerial screamings, taunts and yells; Then the three waves in flashed advance Surged, but were met, and back they set: Pride was repelled by sterner pride, And Right is a strong-hold yet. Before our lines it seemed a beach Which wild September gales have strown With havoc on wreck, and dashed therewith Pale crews unknownâ Men, arms, and steeds. The evening sun Died on the face of each lifeless one, And died along the winding marge of fight And searching-parties lone. Sloped on the hill the mounds were green, Our centre held that place of graves, And some still hold it in their swoon, And over these a glory waves. The warrior-monument, crashed in fight, Shall soar transfigured in loftier light, A meaning ampler bear; Soldier and priest with hymn and prayer Have laid the stone, and every bone Shall rest in honor there. THE HOUSE-TOP A NIGHT PIECE (July, 1863) No sleep. The sultriness pervades the air And binds the brainâa dense oppression, such As tawny tigers feel in matted shades, Vexing their blood and making apt for ravage. Beneath the stars the roofy desert spreads Vacant as Libya. All is hushed near by. Yet fitfully from far breaks a mixed surf Of muffled sound, the Atheist roar of riot. Yonder, where parching Sirius set in drought, Balefully glares red Arsonâthereâand there. The Town is taken by its ratsâship-rats And rats of the wharves. All civil charms And priestly spells which late held hearts in aweâ Fear-bound, subjected to a better sway Than sway of self; these like a dream dissolve, And man rebounds whole Ã¦ons back in nature. Hail to the low dull rumble, dull and dead, And ponderous drag that jars the wall. Wise Draco comes, deep in the midnight roll Of black artillery; he comes, though late; In code corroborating Calvin's creed And cynic tyrannies of honest kings; He comes, nor parlies; and the Town, redeemed, Gives thanks devout; nor, being thankful, heeds The grimy slur on the Republic's faith implied, Which holds that Man is naturally good, Andâmoreâis Nature's Roman, never to be scourged. LOOK-OUT MOUNTAIN THE NIGHT FIGHT (November, 1863) Who inhabiteth the Mountain That it shines in lurid light, And is rolled about with thunders, And terrors, and a blight, Like Kaf the peak of Eblisâ Kaf, the evil height? Who has gone up with a shouting And a trumpet in the night? There is battle in the Mountainâ Might assaulteth Might; 'Tis the fastness of the Anarch, Torrent-torn, an ancient height; The crags resound the clangor Of the war of Wrong and Right; And the armies in the valley Watch and pray for dawning light. Joy, joy, the day is breaking, And the cloud is rolled from sight; There is triumph in the Morning For the Anarch's plunging flight; God has glorified the Mountain Where a Banner burneth bright, And the armies in the valley They are fortified in right. CHATTANOOGA (November, 1863) A kindling impulse seized the host Inspired by heaven's elastic air; Their hearts outran their General's plan, Though Grant commanded thereâ Grant, who without reserve can dare; And, âWell, go on and do your will,â He said, and measured the mountain then: So master-riders fling the reinâ But you must know your men. On yester-morn in grayish mist, Armies like ghosts on hills had fought, And rolled from the cloud their thunders loud The Cumberlands far had caught: To-day the sunlit steeps are sought. Grant stood on cliffs whence all was plain, And smoked as one who feels no cares; But mastered nervousness intense Alone such calmness wears. The summit-cannon plunge their flame Sheer down the primal wall, But up and up each linking troop In stretching festoons crawlâ Nor fire a shot. Such men appall The foe, though brave. He, from the brink, Looks far along the breadth of slope, And sees two miles of dark dots creep, And knows they mean the cope. He sees them creep. Yet here and there Half hid 'mid leafless groves they go; As men who ply through traceries high Of turreted marbles showâ So dwindle these to eyes below. But fronting shot and flanking shell Sliver and rive the inwoven ways; High tops of oaks and high hearts fall, But never the climbing stays. From right to left, from left to right They roll the rallying cheerâ Vie with each other, brother with brother, Who shall the first appearâ What color-bearer with colors clear In sharp relief, like sky-drawn Grant, Whose cigar must now be near the stumpâ While in solicitude his back Heaps slowly to a hump. Near and more near; till now the flags Run like a catching flame; And one flares highest, to peril nighestâ He means to make a name: Salvos! they give him his fame. The staff is caught, and next the rush, And then the leap where death has led; Flag answered flag along the crest, And swarms of foemen fled. But some who gained the envied Alp, Andâeager, ardent, earnest thereâ Dropped into Death's wide-open arms, Quelled on the wing like eagles struck in airâ Forever they slumber young and fair, The smile upon them as they died; Their end attained, that end a height: Life was to these a dream fulfilled, And death a starry night. THE ARMIES OF THE WILDERNESS (1863â4) I Like snows the camps on Southern hills Lay all the winter long, Our levies there in patience stoodâ They stood in patience strong. On fronting slopes gleamed other camps Where faith as firmly clung: Ah, froward kin! so brave amissâ The bravos of the Wrong. In this strife of brothers (God, hear their country call), However it be, whatever betide, Let not the just one fall. Through the pointed glass our soldiers saw The foot-ball bounding sent; They could have joined them in their sport But for the vale's deep rent. And others turned the reddish soil, Like diggers of graves they bent; The reddish soil and trenching toil Begat presentiment. Did the Fathers feel mistrust? Can no final good be wrought? Over and over, again and again Must the fight for the Right be fought? They lead a Gray-back to the crag: âYour earth-works yonderâtell us, man!â âA prisonerâno deserter, I, Nor one of the tell-tale clan.â His rags they mark: âTrue-blue like you Should wear the colorâyour Country's, man!â He grinds his teeth: âHowever that be, Yon earth-works have their plan.â Such brave ones, foully snared By Belial's wily plea, Were faithful unto the evil endâ Feudal fidelity. âWell, then, your campsâcome, tell the names!â Freely he leveled his finger then: âYonderâseeâare our Georgians; on the crest, The Carolinians; lower, past the glen, VirginiansâAlabamiansâMississippiansâKentuckians (Follow my finger)âTennesseans; and the ten Camps thereâask your grave-pits; they'll tell. Halloa! I see the picket-hut, the den Where I last night lay.â âWhere's Lee?â âIn the hearts and bayonets of all yon men!â The tribes swarm up to war As in ages long ago, Ere the palm of promise leaved And the lily of Christ did blow. Their mounted pickets for miles are spied Dotting the lowland plain, The nearer ones in their veteran-ragsâ Loutish they loll in lazy disdain. But ours in perilous places bide With rifles ready and eyes that strain Deep through the dim suspected wood Where the Rapidan rolls amain. The Indian has passed away, But creeping comes anotherâ Deadlier far. Picket, Take heedâtake heed of thy brother! From a wood-hung height, an outpost lone, Crowned with a woodman's fort, The sentinel looks on a land of dole, Like Paran, all amort. Black chimneys, gigantic in moor-like wastes, The scowl of the clouded sky retort; The hearth is a houseless stone againâ Ah! where shall the people be sought? Since the venom such blastment deals, The South should have paused, and thrice, Ere with heat of her hate she hatched The egg with the cockatrice. A path down the mountain winds to the glade Where the dead of the Moonlight Fight lie low; A hand reaches out of the thin-laid mould As begging help which none can bestow. But the field-mouse small and busy ant Heap their hillocks, to hide if they may the woe: By the bubbling spring lies the rusted canteen, And the drum which the drummer-boy dying let go. Dust to dust, and blood for bloodâ Passion and pangs! Has Time Gone back? or is this the Age Of the world's great Prime? The wagon mired and cannon dragged Have trenched their scar; the plain Tramped like the cindery beach of the damnedâ A site for the city of Cain. And stumps of forests for dreary leagues Like a massacre show. The armies have lain By fires where gums and balms did burn, And the seeds of Summer's reign. Where are the birds and boys? Who shall go chestnutting when October returns? The nutsâ O, long ere they grow again. They snug their huts with the chapel-pews, In court-houses stable their steedsâ Kindle their fires with indentures and bonds, And old Lord Halifax's parchment deeds; And Virginian gentlemen's libraries oldâ Books which only the scholar heedsâ Are flung to his kennel. It is ravage and range, And gardens are left to weeds. Turned adrift into war Man runs wild on the plain, Like the jennets let loose On the Pampasâzebras again. Like the Pleiads dim, see the tents through the stormâ Aloft by the hill-side hamlet's graves, On a head-stone used for a hearth-stone there The water is bubbling for punch for our braves. What if the night be drear, and the blast Ghostly shrieks? their rollicking staves Make frolic the heart; beating time with their swords, What care they if Winter raves? Is life but a dream? and so, In the dream do men laugh aloud? So strange seems mirth in a camp, So like a white tent to a shroud. The May-weed springs; and comes a Man And mounts our Signal Hill; A quiet Man, and plain in garbâ Briefly he looks his fill, Then drops his gray eye on the ground, Like a loaded mortar he is still: Meekness and grimness meet in himâ The silent General. Were men but strong and wise, Honest as Grant, and calm, War would be left to the red and black ants, And the happy world disarm. That eve a stir was in the camps, Forerunning quiet soon to come Among the streets of beechen huts No more to know the drum. The weed shall choke the lowly door, And foxes peer within the gloom, Till scared perchance by Mosby's prowling men, Who ride in the rear of doom. Far West, and farther South, Wherever the sword has been, Deserted camps are met, And desert graves are seen. The livelong night they ford the flood; With guns held high they silent press, Till shimmers the grass in their bayonets' sheenâ On Morning's banks their ranks they dress; Then by the forests lightly wind, Whose waving boughs the pennons seem to bless, Borne by the cavalry scouting onâ Sounding the Wilderness. Like shoals of fish in spring That visit Crusoe's isle, The host in the lonesome placeâ The hundred thousand file. The foe that held his guarded hills Must speed to woods afar; For the scheme that was nursed by the Culpepper hearth With the slowly-smoked cigarâ The scheme that smouldered through winter long Now bursts into actâinto warâ The resolute scheme of a heart as calm As the Cyclone's core. The fight for the city is fought In Nature's old domain; Man goes out to the wilds, And Orpheus' charm is vain. In glades they meet skull after skull Where pine-cones layâthe rusted gun, Green shoes full of bones, the mouldering coat And cuddled-up skeleton; And scores of such. Some start as in dreams, And comrades lost bemoan: By the edge of those wilds Stonewall had chargedâ But the Year and the Man were gone. At the height of their madness The night winds pause, Recollecting themselves; But no lull in these wars. A gleam!âa volley! And who shall go Storming the swarmers in jungles dread? No cannon-ball answers, no proxies are sentâ They rush in the shrapnel's stead. Plume and sash are vanities nowâ Let them deck the pall of the dead; They go where the shade is, perhaps into Hades, Where the brave of all times have led. There's a dust of hurrying feet, Bitten lips and bated breath, And drums that challenge to the grave, And faces fixed, forefeeling death. What husky huzzahs in the hazy grovesâ What flying encounters fell; Pursuer and pursued like ghosts disappear In gloomed shadeâtheir end who shall tell? The crippled, a ragged-barked stick for a crutch, Limp to some elfin dellâ Hobble from the sight of dead facesâwhite As pebbles in a well. Few burial rites shall be; No priest with book and band Shall come to the secret place Of the corpse in the foeman's land. Watch and fast, march and fightâclutch your gun! Day-fights and night-fights; sore is the stress; Look, through the pines what line comes on? Longstreet slants through the hauntedness! 'Tis charge for charge, and shout for yell: Such battles on battles oppressâ But Heaven lent strength, the Right strove well, And emerged from the Wilderness. Emerged, for the way was won; But the Pillar of Smoke that led Was brand-like with ghosts that went up Ashy and red. None can narrate that strife in the pines, A seal is on itâSabÃ¦an lore! Obscure as the wood, the entangled rhyme But hints at the maze of warâ Vivid glimpses or livid through peopled gloom, And fires which creep and charâ A riddle of death, of which the slain Sole solvers are. Long they withhold the roll Of the shroudless dead. It is right; Not yet can we bear the flare Of the funeral light. ON THE PHOTOGRAPH OF A CORPS COMMANDER Ay, man is manly. Here you see The warrior-carriage of the head, And brave dilation of the frame; And lighting all, the soul that led In Spottsylvania's charge to victory, Which justifies his fame. A cheering picture. It is good To look upon a Chief like this, In whom the spirit moulds the form. Here favoring Nature, oft remiss, With eagle mien expressive has endued A man to kindle strains that warm. Trace back his lineage, and his sires, Yeoman or noble, you shall find Enrolled with men of Agincourt, Heroes who shared great Harry's mind. Down to us come the knightly Norman fires, And front the Templars bore. Nothing can lift the heart of man Like manhood in a fellow-man. The thought of heaven's great King afar But humbles usâtoo weak to scan; But manly greatness men can span, And feel the bonds that draw. THE SWAMP ANGEL There is a coal-black Angel With a thick Afric lip, And he dwells (like the hunted and harried) In a swamp where the green frogs dip. But his face is against a City Which is over a bay of the sea, And he breathes with a breath that is blastment, And dooms by a far decree. By night there is fear in the City, Through the darkness a star soareth on; There's a scream that screams up to the zenith, Then the poise of a meteor loneâ Lighting far the pale fright of the faces, And downward the coming is seen; Then the rush, and the burst, and the havoc, And wails and shrieks between. It comes like the thief in the gloaming; It comes, and none may foretell The place of the comingâthe glaring; They live in a sleepless spell That wizens, and withers, and whitens; It ages the young, and the bloom Of the maiden is ashes of rosesâ The Swamp Angel broods in his gloom. Swift is his messengers' going, But slowly he saps their halls, As if by delay deluding. They move from their crumbling walls Farther and farther away; But the Angel sends after and after, By night with the flame of his rayâ By night with the voice of his screamingâ Sends after them, stone by stone, And farther walls fall, farther portals, And weed follows weed through the Town. Is this the proud City? the scorner Which never would yield the ground? Which mocked at the coal-black Angel? The cup of despair goes round. Vainly she calls upon Michael (The white man's seraph was he), For Michael has fled from his tower To the Angel over the sea. Who weeps for the woeful City Let him weep for our guilty kind; Who joys at her wild despairingâ Christ, the Forgiver, convert his mind. THE BATTLE FOR THE BAY (August, 1864) O mystery of noble hearts, To whom mysterious seas have been In midnight watches, lonely calm and storm, A stern, sad discipline, And rooted out the false and vain, And chastened them to aptness for Devotion and the deeds of war, And death which smiles and cheers in spite of pain. Beyond the bar the land-wind dies, The prow becharmed at anchor swim: A summer night; the stars withdrawn look downâ Fair eve of battle grim. The sentries pace, bonetas glide; Below, the sleeping sailors swing, And in their dreams to quarters spring, Or cheer their flag, or breast a stormy tide. But drums are beat: Up anchor all! The triple lines steam slowly on; Day breaks; along the sweep of decks each man Stands coldly by his gunâ As cold as it. But he shall warmâ Warm with the solemn metal there, And all its ordered fury share, In attitude a gladiatorial form. The Admiralâyielding to the love Which held his life and ship so dearâ Sailed second in the long fleet's midmost line; Yet thwarted all their care: He lashed himself aloft, and shone Star of the fight, with influence sent Throughout the dusk embattlement; And so they neared the strait and walls of stone. No sprightly fife as in the field, The decks were hushed like fanes in prayer; Behind each man a holy angel stoodâ He stood, though none was 'ware. Out spake the forts on either hand, Back speak the ships when spoken to, And set their flags in concert true, And On and in! is Farragut's command. But what delays? 'mid wounds above Dim buoys give hint of death belowâ Sea-ambuscades, where evil art had aped Hecla that hides in snow. The centre-van, entangled, trips; The starboard leader holds straight on: A cheer for the Tecumseh!ânay, Before their eyes the turreted ship goes down! The fire redoubles. While the fleet Hangs dubiousâere the horror ranâ The Admiral rushes to his rightful placeâ Well met! apt hour and man!â Closes with peril, takes the lead, His action is a stirring call; He strikes his great heart through them all, And is the genius of their daring deed. The forts are daunted, slack their fire, Confounded by the deadlier aim And rapid broadsides of the speeding fleet, And fierce denouncing flame. Yet shots from four dark hulls embayed Come raking through the loyal crews, Whom now each dying mate endues With his last look, anguished yet undismayed. A flowering time to guilt is given, And traitors have their glorying hour; A late, but sure, the righteous Paramount comesâ Palsy is on their power! So proved it with the rebel keels, The strong-holds past: assailed, they run; The Selma strikes, and the work is done: The dropping anchor the achievement seals. But no, she turnsâthe Tennessee! The solid Ram of iron and oak, Strong as Evil, and bold as Wrong, though loneâ A pestilence in her smoke. The flagship is her singled mark, The wooden Hartford. Let her come; She challenges the planet of Doom, And naught shall save herânot her iron bark. Slip anchor, all! and at her, all! Bear down with rushing beaksâand now! First the Monongahela struckâand reeled; The Lackawana's prow Next crashedâcrashed, but not crashing; then The Admiral rammed, and rasping nigh Sloped in a broadside, which glanced by: The Monitors battered at her adamant den. The Chickasaw plunged beneath the stern And pounded there; a huge wrought orb From the Manhattan pierced one wall, but dropped; Others the seas absorb. Yet stormed on all sides, narrowed in, Hampered and cramped, the bad one foughtâ Spat ribald curses from the port Whose shutters, jammed, locked up this Man-of-Sin. No pause or stay. They made a din Like hammers round a boiler forged; Now straining strength tangled itself with strength, Till Hate her will disgorged. The white flag showed, the fight was wonâ Mad shouts went up that shook the Bay; But pale on the scarred fleet's decks there lay A silent man for ever silenced gun. And quiet far below the wave, Where never cheers shall move their sleep, Some who did boldly, nobly earn them, lieâ Charmed children of the deep. But decks that now are in the seed, And cannon yet within the mine, Shall thrill the deeper, gun and pine, Because of the Tecumseh's glorious deed. SHERIDAN AT CEDAR CREEK (October, 1864) Shoe the steed with silver That bore him to the fray, When he heard the guns at dawningâ Miles away; When he heard them calling, callingâ Mount! nor stay: Quick, or all is lost; They've surprised and stormed the post, They push your routed hostâ Gallop! retrieve the day. House the horse in ermineâ For the foam-flake blew White through the red October; He thundered into view; They cheered him in the looming, Horseman and horse they knew. The turn of the tide began, The rally of bugles ran, He swung his hat in the van; The electric hoof-spark flew. Wreathe the steed and lead himâ For the charge he led Touched and turned the cypress Into amaranths for the head Of Philip, king of riders, Who raised them from the dead. The camp (at dawning lost), By eve, recoveredâforced, Rang with laughter of the host At belated Early fled. Shroud the horse in sableâ For the mounds they heap! There is firing in the Valley, And yet no strife they keep; It is the parting volley, It is the pathos deep. There is glory for the brave Who lead, and nobly save, But no knowledge in the grave Where the nameless followers sleep. IN THE PRISON PEN (1864) Listless he eyes the palisades And sentries in the glare; 'Tis barren as a pelican-beachâ But his world is ended there. Nothing to do; and vacant hands Bring on the idiot-pain; He tries to thinkâto recollect, But the blur is on his brain. Around him swarm the plaining ghosts Like those on Virgil's shoreâ A wilderness of faces dim, And pale ones gashed and hoar. A smiting sun. No shed, no tree; He totters to his lairâ A den that sick hands dug in earth Ere famine wasted there, Or, dropping in his place, he swoons, Walled in by throngs that press, Till forth from the throngs they bear him deadâ Dead in his meagreness. THE COLLEGE COLONEL He rides at their head; A crutch by his saddle just slants in view, One slung arm is in splints, you see, Yet he guides his strong steedâhow coldly too. He brings his regiment homeâ Not as they filed two years before, But a remnant half-tattered, and battered, and worn, Like castaway sailors, whoâstunned By the surf's loud roar, Their mates dragged back and seen no moreâ Again and again breast the surge, And at last crawl, spent, to shore. A still rigidity and paleâ An Indian aloofness lones his brow; He has lived a thousand years Compressed in battle's pains and prayers, Marches and watches slow. There are welcoming shouts, and flags; Old men off hat to the Boy, Wreaths from gay balconies fall at his feet, But to himâthere comes alloy. It is not that a leg is lost, It is not that an arm is maimed, It is not that the fever has rackedâ Self he has long disclaimed. But all through the Seven Days' Fight, And deep in the Wilderness grim, And in the field-hospital tent, And Petersburg crater, and dim Lean brooding in Libby, there cameâ Ah heaven!âwhat truth to him. THE EAGLE OF THE BLUE Aloft he guards the starry folds Who is the brother of the star; The bird whose joy is in the wind Exulteth in the war. No painted plumeâa sober hue, His beauty is his power; That eager calm of gaze intent Foresees the Sibyl's hour. Austere, he crowns the swaying perch, Flapped by the angry flag; The hurricane from the battery sings, But his claw has known the crag. Amid the scream of shells, his scream Runs shrilling; and the glare Of eyes that brave the blinding sun The volleyed flame can bear. The pride of quenchless strength is hisâ Strength which, though chained, avails; The very rebel looks and thrillsâ The anchored Emblem hails. Though scarred in many a furious fray, No deadly hurt he knew; Well may we think his years are charmedâ The Eagle of the Blue. A DIRGE FOR McPHERSON KILLED IN FRONT OF ATLANTA (July, 1864) Arms reversed and banners crapedâ Muffled drums; Snowy horses sable-drapedâ McPherson comes. But, tell us, shall we know him more, Lost-Mountain and lone Kenesaw? Brave the sword upon the pallâ A gleam in gloom; So a bright name lighteth all McPherson's doom. Bear him through the chapel-doorâ Let priest in stole Pace before the warrior Who led. Bellâtoll! Lay him down within the nave, The Lesson readâ Man is noble, man is brave, But man'sâa weed. Take him up again and wend Graveward, nor weep: There's a trumpet that shall rend This Soldier's sleep. Pass the ropes the coffin round, And let descend; Prayer and volleyâlet it sound McPherson's end. True fame is his, for life is o'erâ Sarpedon of the mighty war. AT THE CANNON'S MOUTH DESTRUCTION OF THE RAM ALBEMARLE BY THE TORPEDO-LAUNCH (October, 1864) Palely intent, he urged his keel Full on the guns, and touched the spring; Himself involved in the bolt he drove Timed with the armed hull's shot that stove His shallopâdie or do! Into the flood his life he threw, Yet livesâunscathedâa breathing thing To marvel at. He has his fame; But that mad dash at death, how name? Had Earth no charm to stay in the Boy The martyr-passion? Could he dare Disdain the Paradise of opening joy Which beckons the fresh heart every where? Life has more lures than any girl For youth and strength; puts forth a share Of beauty, hinting of yet rarer store; And ever with unfathomable eyes, Which baffingly entice, Still strangely does Adonis draw. And life once over, who shall tell the rest? Life is, of all we know, God's best. What imps these eagles then, that they Fling disrespect on life by that proud way In which they soar above our lower clay. Pretence of wonderment and doubt unblest: In Cushing's eager deed was shown A spirit which brave poets ownâ That scorn of life which earns life's crown; Earns, but not always wins; but heâ The star ascended in his nativity. THE MARCH TO THE SEA (December, 1864) Not Kenesaw high-arching, Nor Allatoona's glenâ Though there the graves lie parchingâ Stayed Sherman's miles of men; From charred Atlanta marching They launched the sword again. The columns streamed like rivers Which in their course agree, And they streamed until their flashing Met the flashing of the sea: It was glorious glad marching, That marching to the sea. They brushed the foe before them (Shall gnats impede the bull?); Their own good bridges bore them Over swamps or torrents full, And the grand pines waving o'er them Bowed to axes keen and cool. The columns grooved their channels, Enforced their own decree, And their power met nothing larger Until it met the sea: It was glorious glad marching, A marching glad and free. Kilpatrick's snare of riders In zigzags mazed the land, Perplexed the pale Southsiders With feints on every hand; Vague menace awed the hiders In fort beyond command. To Sherman's shifting problem No foeman knew the key; But onward went the marching Unpausing to the sea: It was glorious glad marching, The swinging step was free. The flankers ranged like pigeons In clouds through field or wood; The flocks of all those regions, The herds and horses good, Poured in and swelled the legions, For they caught the marching mood. A volley ahead! They hear it; And they hear the repartee: Fighting was but frolic In that marching to the sea: It was glorious glad marching, A marching bold and free. All nature felt their coming, The birds like couriers flew, And the banners brightly blooming The slaves by thousands drew, And they marched beside the drumming, And they joined the armies blue. The cocks crowed from the cannon (Pets named from Grant and Lee), Plumed fighters and campaigners In that marching to the sea: It was glorious glad marching, For every man was free. The foragers through calm lands Swept in tempest gay, And they breathed the air of balm-lands Where rolled savannas lay, And they helped themselves from farm-landsâ As who should say them nay? The regiments uproarious Laughed in Plenty's glee; And they marched till their broad laughter Met the laughter of the sea: It was glorious glad marching, That marching to the sea. The grain of endless acres Was threshed (as in the East) By the trampling of the Takers, Strong march of man and beast; The flails of those earth-shakers Left a famine where they ceased. The arsenals were yielded; The sword (that was to be), Arrested in the forging, Rued that marching to the sea: It was glorious glad marching, But ah, the stern decree! For behind they left a wailing, A terror and a ban, And blazing cinders sailing, And houseless households wan, Wide zones of counties paling, And towns where maniacs ran, Was the havoc, retribution? But howsoe'er it be, They will long remember Sherman And his streaming columns freeâ They will long remember Sherman Marching to the sea. THE FRENZY IN THE WAKE SHERMAN'S ADVANCE THROUGH THE CAROLINAS (February, 1865) So strong to suffer, shall we be Weak to contend, and break The sinews of the Oppressor's knee That grinds upon the neck? O, the garments rolled in blood Scorch in cities wrapped in flame, And the Africanâthe imp! He gibbers, imputing shame. Shall Time, avenging every woe, To us that joy allot Which Israel thrilled when Sisera's brow Showed gaunt and showed the clot? Curse on their foreheads, cheeks, and eyesâ The Northern facesâtrue To the flag we hate, the flag whose stars Like planets strike us through. From frozen Maine they come, Far Minnesota too; They come to a sun whose rays disownâ May it whither them as the dew! The ghosts of our slain appeal: âVain shall our victories be?â But back from its ebb the flood recoilsâ Back in a whelming sea. With burning woods our skies are brass, The pillars of dust are seen; The live-long day their cavalry passâ No crossing the road between. We were sore deceivedâan awful host! They move like a roaring wind, Have we gamed and lost? but even despair Shall never our hate rescind. THE FALL OF RICHMOND THE TIDINGS RECEIVED IN THE NORTHERN METROPOLIS (April, 1865) What mean these peals from every tower, And crowds like seas that sway? The cannon reply; they speak the heart Of the People impassioned, and sayâ A city in flags for a city in flames, Richmond goes Babylon's wayâ Sing and pray. O weary years and woeful wars, And armies in the grave; But hearts unquelled at last deter The helmed dilated Luciferâ Honor to Grant the brave, Whose three stars now like Orion's rise When wreck is on the waveâ Bless his glaive. Well that the faith we firmly kept, And never our aim forswore For the Terrors that trooped from each recess When fainting we fought in the Wilderness, And Hell made loud hurrah; But God is in Heaven, and Grant in the Town, And Right through might is Lawâ God's way adore. THE SURRENDER AT APPOMATTOX (April, 1865) As billows upon billows roll, On victory victory breaks; Ere yet seven days from Richmond's fall And crowning triumph wakes The loud joy-gun, whose thunders run By sea-shore, streams, and lakes. The hope and great event agree In the sword that Grant received from Lee. The warring eagles fold the wing, But not in Caesar's sway; Not Rome o'ercome by Roman arms we sing As on Pharsalia's day, But Treason thrown, though a giant grown, And Freedom's larger play. All human tribes glad token see In the close of the wars of Grant and Lee. A CANTICLE: SIGNIFICANT OF THE NATIONAL EXALTATION OF ENTHUSIASM AT THE CLOSE OF THE WAR O the precipice Titanic Of the congregated Fall, And the angle oceanic Where the deepening thunders callâ And the Gorge so grim, And the firmamental rim! Multitudinously thronging The waters all converge, Then they sweep adown in sloping Solidity of surge. The Nation, in her impulse Mysterious as the Tide, In emotion like an ocean Moves in power, not in pride; And is deep in her devotion As Humanity is wide. Thou Lord of hosts victorious, The confluence Thou hast twined; By a wondrous way and glorious A passage Thou dost findâ A passage Thou dost find: Hosanna to the Lord of hosts, The hosts of human kind. Stable in its baselessness When calm is in the air, The Iris half in tracelessness Hovers faintly fair. Fitfully assailing it A wind from heaven blows, Shivering and paling it To blankness of the snows; While, incessant in renewal, The Arch rekindled grows, Till again the gem and jewel Whirl in blinding overthrowsâ Till, prevailing and transcending, Lo, the Glory perfect there, And the contest finds an ending, For repose is in the air. But the foamy Deep unsounded, And the dim and dizzy ledge, And the booming roar rebounded, And the gull that skims the edge! The Giant of the Pool Heaves his forehead white as woolâ Toward the Iris ever climbing From the Cataracts that callâ Irremovable vast arras Draping all the Wall. The Generations pouring From times of endless date, In their going, in their flowing Ever form the steadfast State; And Humanity is growing Toward the fullness of her fate. Thou Lord of hosts victorious, Fulfill the end designed; By a wondrous way and glorious A passage Thou dost findâ A passage Thou dost find: Hosanna to the Lord of Hosts, The hosts of human kind. THE MARTYR INDICATIVE OF THE PASSION OF THE PEOPLE ON THE 15TH DAY OF APRIL, 1865 Good Friday was the day Of the prodigy and crime, When they killed him in his pity, When they killed him in his prime Of clemency and calmâ When with yearning he was filled To redeem the evil-willed, And, though conqueror, be kind; But they killed him in his kindness, In their madness and their blindness, And they killed him from behind. There is sobbing of the strong, And a pall upon the land; But the people in their weeping Bare the iron hand; Beware the People weeping When they bare the iron hand. He lieth in his bloodâ The father in his face; They have killed him, the Forgiverâ The Avenger takes his place, The Avenger wisely stern, Who in righteousness shall do What the heavens call him to, And the parricides remand; For they killed him in his kindness, In their madness and their blindness, And his blood is on their hand. There is sobbing of the strong, And a pall upon the land; But the People in their weeping Bare the iron hand: Beware the People weeping When they bare the iron hand. âTHE COMING STORMâ A PICTURE BY S. R. GIFFORD, AND OWNED BY E. B. INCLUDED IN THE N.A. EXHIBITION, APRIL, 1865 All feeling hearts must feel for him Who felt this picture. Presage dimâ Dim inklings from the shadowy sphere Fixed him and fascinated here. A demon-cloud like the mountain one Burst on a spirit as mild As this urned lake, the home of shades, But Shakespeare's pensive child. Never the lines had lightly scanned, Steeped in fable, steeped in fate; The Hamlet in his heart was 'ware, Such hearts can antedate. No utter surprise can come to him Who reaches Shakespeare's core; That which we seek and shun is thereâ Man's final lore. REBEL COLOR-BEARERS AT SHILOH A PLEA AGAINST THE VINDICTIVE CRY RAISED BY CIVILIANS SHORTLY AFTER THE SURRENDER AT APPOMATTOX The color-bearers facing death White in the whirling sulphurous wreath, Stand boldly out before the line; Right and left their glances go, Proud of each other, glorying in their show; Their battle-flags about them blow, And fold them as in flame divine: Such living robes are only seen Round martyrs burning on the greenâ And martyrs for the Wrong have been. Perish their Cause! but mark the menâ Mark the planted statues, then Draw trigger on them if you can. The leader of a patriot-band Even so could view rebels who so could stand; And this when peril pressed him sore, Left aidless in the shivered front of warâ Skulkers behind, defiant foes before, And fighting with a broken brand. The challenge in that courage rareâ Courage defenseless, proudly bareâ Never could tempt him; he could dare Strike up the leveled rifle there. Sunday at Shiloh, and the day When Stonewall chargedâMcClellan's crimson May, And Chickamauga's wave of death, And of the Wilderness the cypress wreathâ All these have passed away. The life in the veins of Treason lags, Her daring color-bearers drop their flags, And yield. Now shall we fire? Can poor spite be? Shall nobleness in victory less aspire Than in reverse? Spare Spleen her ire, And think how Grant met Lee. THE MUSTER SUGGESTED BY TWO DAYS' REVIEW AT WASHINGTON (May, 1865) The Abrahamic riverâ Patriarch of floods, Calls the roll of all his streams And watery multitudes: Torrent cries to torrent, The rapids hail the fall; With shouts the inland freshets Gather to the call. The quotas of the Nation, Like the water-shed of waves, Muster into unionâ Eastern warriors, Western braves. Martial strains are mingling, Though distant far the bands, And the wheeling of the squadrons Is like surf upon the sands. The bladed guns are gleamingâ Drift in lengthened trim, Files on files for hazy milesâ Nebulously dim. O Milky Way of armiesâ Star rising after star, New banners of the Commonwealths, And eagles of the War. The Abrahamic river To sea-wide fullness fed, Pouring from the thaw-lands By the God of floods is led: His deep enforcing current The streams of ocean own, And Europe's marge is evened By rills from Kansas lone. AURORA-BOREALIS COMMEMORATIVE OF THE DISSOLUTION OF ARMIES AT THE PEACE (May, 1865) What power disbands the Northern Lights After their steely play? The watcher feels a creeping awe Of Nature's sway, As when appearing, He marked their flashed uprearing In the cold gloomâ Retreatings and advancings, (Like dallyings of doom), Transitions and enhancings, And bloody ray. The phantom-host has failed quite, Splendor and Terror goneâ Portent or promiseâand gives way To pale, meek Dawn; The coming, going, Alike in wonder showingâ Alike the God, Decreeing and commanding The million blades that glowed, The muster and disbandingâ Midnight and Morn. THE RELEASED REBEL PRISONER (June, 1865) Armies he's seenâthe herds of war, But never such swarms of men As now in the Nineveh of the Northâ How mad the Rebellion then! And yet but dimly he divines The depth of that deceit, And superstition of vast pride Humbled to such defeat. Seductive shone the Chiefs in armsâ His steel the nearest magnet drew; Wreathed with its kind, the Gulf-weed drivesâ 'Tis Nature's wrong they rue. His face is hidden in his beard, But his heart peers out at eyeâ And such a heart! like a mountain-pool Where no man passes by. He thinks of Hillâa brave soul gone; And Ashby dead in pale disdain; And Stuart with the Rupert-plume, Whose blue eye never shall laugh again. He hears the drum; he sees our boys From his wasted fields return; Ladies feast them on strawberries, And even to kiss them yearn. He marks them bronzed, in soldier-trim, The rifle proudly borne; They bear it for an heir-loom home, And heâdisarmedâjail-worn. Home, homeâhis heart is full of it; But home he never shall see, Even should he stand upon the spot: 'Tis gone!âwhere his brothers be. The cypress-moss from tree to tree Hangs in his Southern land; As drear, from thought to thought of his Run memories hand in hand. And so he lingersâlingers on In the City of the Foeâ His cousins and his countrymen Who see him listless go. A GRAVE NEAR PETERSBURG, VIRGINIA Head-board and foot-board duly placedâ Grassed is the mound between; Daniel Drouth is the slumberer's nameâ Long may his grave be green! Quick was his wayâa flash and a blow, Full of his fire was heâ A fire of hellâ'tis burnt out nowâ Green may his grave long be! May his grave be green, though he Was a rebel of iron mould; Many a true heartâtrue to the Cause, Through the blaze of his wrath lies cold. May his grave be greenâstill green While happy years shall run; May none come nigh to disinter TheâBuried Gun. âFORMERLY A SLAVEâ AN IDEALIZED PORTRAIT, BY E. VEDDER, IN THE SPRING EXHIBITION OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY, 1865 The sufferance of her race is shown, And retrospect of life, Which now too late deliverance dawns upon; Yet is she not at strife. Her children's children they shall know The good withheld from her; And so her reverie takes prophetic cheerâ In spirit she sees the stir Far down the depth of thousand years, And marks the revel shine; Her dusky face is lit with sober light, Sibylline, yet benign. THE APPARITION A RETROSPECT Convulsions came; and, where the field Long slept in pastoral green, A goblin-mountain was upheaved (Sure the scared sense was all deceived), Marl-glen and slag-ravine. The unreserve of Ill was there, The clinkers in her last retreat; But, ere the eye could take it in, Or mind could comprehension win, It sunk!âand at our feet. So, then, Solidity's a crustâ The core of fire below; All may go well for many a year, But who can think without a fear Of horrors that happen so? MAGNANIMITY BAFFLED âSharp words we had before the fight; Butânow the fight is doneâ Look, here's my hand,â said the Victor bold, âTake itâan honest one! What, holding back? I mean you well; Though worsted, you strove stoutly, man; The odds were great; I honor you; Man honors man. âStill silent, friend? can grudges be? Yet am I held a foe?â Turned to the wall, on his cot he liesâ Never I'll leave him so! Brave one! I here implore your hand; Dumb still? all fellowship fled? Nay, then, I'll have this stubborn hand!â He snatched itâit was dead. ON THE SLAIN COLLEGIANS Youth is the time when hearts are large, And stirring wars Appeal to the spirit which appeals in turn To the blade it draws. If woman incite, and duty show (Though made the mask of Cain), Or whether it be Truth's sacred cause, Who can aloof remain That shares youth's ardor, uncooled by the snow Of wisdom or sordid gain? The liberal arts and nurture sweet Which give his gentleness to manâ Train him to honor, lend him grace Through bright examples meetâ That culture which makes never wan With underminings deep, but holds The surface still, its fitting place, And so gives sunniness to the face And bravery to the heart; what troops Of generous boys in happiness thus bredâ Saturnians through life's Tempe led, Went from the North and came from the South, With golden mottoes in the mouth, To lie down midway on a bloody bed. Woe for the homes of the North, And woe for the seats of the South: All who felt life's spring in prime, And were swept by the wind of their place and timeâ All lavish hearts, on whichever side, Of birth urbane or courage high, Armed them for the stirring warsâ Armed themâsome to die. Apollo-like in pride, Each would slay his Pythonâcaught The maxims in his temple taughtâ Aflame with sympathies whose blaze Perforce enwrapped himâsocial laws, Friendship and kin, and by-gone daysâ Vows, kissesâevery heart unmoors, And launches into the seas of wars. What could they elseâNorth or South? Each went forth with blessings given By priests and mothers in the name of Heaven; And honor in all was chief. Warred one for Right, and one for Wrong? So put it; but they both were youngâ Each grape to his cluster clung, All their elegies are sung. The anguish of maternal hearts Must search for balm divine; But well the striplings bore their fated parts (The heavens all parts assign)â Never felt life's care or cloy. Each bloomed and died an unabated Boy; Nor dreamed what death wasâthought it mere Sliding into some vernal sphere. They knew the joy, but leaped the grief, Like plants that flower ere comes the leafâ Which storms lay low in kindly doom, And kill them in their flush of bloom. AMERICA I Where the wings of a sunny Dome expand I saw a Banner in gladsome airâ Starry, like Berenice's Hairâ Afloat in broadened bravery there; With undulating long-drawn flow, As rolled Brazilian billows go Voluminously o'er the Line. The Land reposed in peace below; The children in their glee Were folded to the exulting heart Of young Maternity. II Later, and it streamed in fight When tempest mingled with the fray, And over the spear-point of the shaft I saw the ambiguous lightning play. Valor with Valor strove, and died: Fierce was Despair, and cruel was Pride; And the lorn Mother speechless stood, Pale at the fury of her brood. III Yet later, and the silk did wind Her fair cold form; Little availed the shining shroud, Though ruddy in hue, to cheer or warm, A watcher looked upon her low, and saidâ She sleeps, but sleeps, she is not dead. But in that sleep contortion showed The terror of the vision thereâ A silent vision unavowed, Revealing earth's foundation bare, And Gorgon in her hidden place. It was a thing of fear to see So foul a dream upon so fair a face, And the dreamer lying in that starry shroud. IV But from the trance she sudden brokeâ The trance, or death into promoted life; At her feet a shivered yoke, And in her aspect turned to heaven No trace of passion or of strifeâ A clear calm look. It spake of pain, But such as purifies from stainâ Sharp pangs that never come againâ And triumph repressed by knowledge meet, Power dedicate, and hope grown wise, And youth matured for age's seatâ Law on her brow and empire in her eyes. So she, with graver air and lifted flag; While the shadow, chased by light, Fled along the far-drawn height, And left her on the crag. VERSES INSCRIPTIVE AND MEMORIAL ON THE HOME GUARDS WHO PERISHED IN THE DEFENSE OF LEXINGTON, MISSOURI The men who here in harness died Fell not in vain, though in defeat. They by their end well fortified The Cause, and built retreat (With memory of their valor tried) For emulous hearts in many an after frayâ Hearts sore beset, which died at bay. INSCRIPTION FOR THE GRAVES AT PEA RIDGE, ARKANSAS Let none misgive we died amiss When here we strove in furious fight: Furious it was; nathless was this Better than tranquil plight, And tame surrender of the Cause Hallowed by hearts and by the laws. We here who warred for Man and Right, The choice of warring never laid with us. There we were ruled by the traitor's choice, Nor long we stood to trim and poise, But marched, and fellâvictorious! THE FORTITUDE OF THE NORTH UNDER THE DISASTER OF THE SECOND MANASSAS No shame they take for dark defeat While prizing yet each victory won, Who fight for the Right through all retreat, Nor pause until their work is done. The Cape-of-Storms is proof to every throe; Vainly against that foreland beat Wild winds aloft and wilder waves below: The black cliffs gleam through rents in sleet When the livid Antarctic storm-clouds glow. ON THE MEN OF MAINE KILLED IN THE VICTORY OF BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA Afar they fell. It was the zone Of fig and orange, cane and lime (A land how all unlike their own, With the cold pine-grove overgrown), But still their Country's clime. And there in youth they died for herâ The Volunteers, For her went up their dying prayers: So vast the Nation, yet so strong the tie. What doubt shall come, then, to deter The Republic's earnest faith and courage high. AN EPITAPH When Sunday tidings from the front Made pale the priest and people, And heavily the blessing went, And bells were dumb in the steeple; The Soldier's widow (summering sweetly here, In shade by waving beeches lent) Felt deep at heart her faith content, And priest and people borrowed of her cheer. INSCRIPTION FOR MARYE'S HEIGHTS, FREDERICKSBURG To them who crossed the flood And climbed the hill, with eyes Upon the heavenly flag intent, And through the deathful tumult went Even unto death: to them this Stoneâ Erect, where they were overthrownâ Of more than victory the monument. THE MOUND BY THE LAKE The grass shall never forget this grave. When homeward footing it in the sun After the weary ride by rail, The stripling soldiers passed her door, Wounded perchance, or wan and pale, She left her household work undoneâ Duly the wayside table spread, With evergreens shaded, to regale Each travel-spent and grateful one. So warm her heartâchildlessâunwed, Who like a mother comforted. ON THE SLAIN AT CHICKAMAUGA Happy are they and charmed in life Who through long wars arrive unscarred At peace. To such the wreath be given, If they unfalteringly have strivenâ In honor, as in limb, unmarred. Let cheerful praise be rife, And let them live their years at ease, Musing on brothers who victorious diedâ Loved mates whose memory shall ever please. And yet mischance is honorable tooâ Seeming defeat in conflict justified Whose end to closing eyes is hid from view. The will, that never can relentâ The aim, survivor of the bafflement, Make this memorial due. AN UNINSCRIBED MONUMENT ON ONE OF THE BATTLE-FIELDS OF THE WILDERNESS Silence and Solitude may hint (Whose home is in yon piny wood) What I, though tableted, could never tellâ The din which here befell, And striving of the multitude. The iron cones and spheres of death Set round me in their rust, These, too, if just, Shall speak with more than animated breath. Thou who beholdest, if thy thought, Not narrowed down to personal cheer, Take in the import of the quiet hereâ The after-quietâthe calm full fraught; Thou too wilt silent standâ Silent as I, and lonesome as the land. ON SHERMAN'S MEN WHO FELL IN THE ASSAULT OF KENESAW MOUNTAIN, GEORGIA They said that Fame her clarion dropped Because great deeds were done no moreâ That even Duty knew no shining ends, And Gloryâ'twas a fallen star! But battle can heroes and bards restore. Nay, look at Kenesaw: Perils the mailed ones never knew Are lightly braved by the ragged coats of blue, And gentler hearts are bared to deadlier war. ON THE GRAVE OF A YOUNG CAVALRY OFFICER KILLED IN THE VALLEY OF VIRGINIA Beauty and youth, with manners sweet, and friendsâ Gold, yet a mind not unenriched had he Whom here low violets veil from eyes. But all these gifts transcended be: His happier fortune in this mound you see. A REQUIEM FOR SOLDIERS LOST IN OCEAN TRANSPORTS When, after storms that woodlands rue, To valleys comes atoning dawn, The robins blithe their orchard-sports renew; And meadow-larks, no more withdrawn, Caroling fly in the languid blue; The while, from many a hid recess, Alert to partake the blessedness, The pouring mites their airy dance pursue. So, after ocean's ghastly gales, When laughing light of hoyden morning breaks, Every finny hider wakesâ From vaults profound swims up with glittering scales; Through the delightsome sea he sails, With shoals of shining tiny things Frolic on every wave that flings Against the prow its showery spray; All creatures joying in the morn, Save them forever from joyance torn, Whose bark was lost where now the dolphins play; Save them that by the fabled shore, Down the pale stream are washed away, Far to the reef of bones are borne; And never revisits them the light, Nor sight of long-sought land and pilot more; Nor heed they now the lone bird's flight Round the lone spar where mid-sea surges pour. ON A NATURAL MONUMENT IN A FIELD OF GEORGIA No trophy thisâa Stone unhewn, And stands where here the field immures The nameless brave whose palms are won. Outcast they sleep; yet fame is nighâ Pure fame of deeds, not doers; Nor deeds of men who bleeding die In cheer of hymns that round them float: In happy dreams such close the eye. But withering famine slowly wore, And slowly fell disease did gloat. Even Nature's self did aid deny; In horror they choked the pensive sigh. Yea, off from home sad Memory bore (Though anguished Yearning heaved that way), Lest wreck of reason might befall. As men in gales shun the lee shore, Though there the homestead be, and call, And thitherward winds and waters swayâ As such lorn mariners, so fared they. But naught shall now their peace molest. Their fame is this: they did endureâ Endure, when fortitude was vain To kindle any approving strain Which they might hear. To these who rest, This healing sleep alone was sure. COMMEMORATIVE OF A NAVAL VICTORY Sailors there are of gentlest breed, Yet strong, like every goodly thing; The discipline of arms refines, And the wave gives tempering. The damasked blade its beam can fling; It lends the last grave grace: The hawk, the hound, and sworded nobleman In Titian's picture for a king, Are of hunter or warrior race. In social halls a favored guest In years that follow victory won, How sweet to feel your festal fame In woman's glance instinctive thrown: Repose is yoursâyour deed is known, It musks the amber wine; It lives, and sheds a light from storied days Rich as October sunsets brown, Which make the barren place to shine. But seldom the laurel wreath is seen Unmixed with pensive pansies dark; There's a light and a shadow on every man Who at last attains his lifted markâ Nursing through night the ethereal spark. Elate he never can be; He feels that spirit which glad had hailed his worth, Sleep in oblivion.âThe shark Glides white through the phosphorus sea. PRESENTATION TO THE AUTHORITIES BY PRIVATES, OF COLORS CAPTURED IN BATTLES ENDING IN THE SURRENDER OF LEE These flags of armies overthrownâ Flags fallen beneath the sovereign one In end foredoomed which closes war; We here, the captors, lay before The altar which of right claims allâ Our Country. And as freely we, Revering ever her sacred call, Could lay our lives downâthough life be Thrice loved and precious to the sense Of such as reap the recompense Of life imperiled for just causeâ Imperiled, and yet preserved; While comrades, whom Duty as strongly nerved, Whose wives were all as dear, lie low. But these flags given, glad we go To waiting homes with vindicated laws. THE RETURNED VOLUNTEER TO HIS RIFLE Over this hearthâmy father's seatâ Repose, to patriot-memory dear, Thou tried companion, whom at last I greet By steepy banks of Hudson here. How oft I told thee of this sceneâ The Highlands blueâthe river's narrowing sheen. Little at Gettysburg we thought To find such haven; but God kept it green. Long rest! with belt, and bayonet, and canteen. THE SCOUT TOWARD ALDIE The cavalry-camp lies on the slope Of what was late a vernal hill, But now like a pavement bareâ An outpost in the perilous wilds Which ever are lone and still; But Mosby's men are thereâ Of Mosby best beware. Great trees the troopers felled, and leaned In antlered walls about their tents; Strict watch they kept; 'twas Hark! and Mark! Unarmed none cared to stir abroad For berries beyond their forest-fence: As glides in seas the shark, Rides Mosby through green dark. All spake of him, but few had seen Except the maimed ones or the low; Yet rumor made him every thingâ A farmerâwoodmanârefugeeâ The man who crossed the field but now; A spell about his life did clingâ Who to the ground shall Mosby bring? The morning-bugles lonely play, Lonely the evening-bugle callsâ Unanswered voices in the wild; The settled hush of birds in nest Becharms, and all the wood enthralls: Memory's self is so beguiled That Mosby seems a satyr's child. They lived as in the Eerie Landâ The fire-flies showed with fairy gleam; And yet from pine-tops one might ken The Capitol Domeâhazyâsublimeâ A vision breaking on a dream: So strange it was that Mosby's men Should dare to prowl where the Dome was seen. A ride toward Aldie broke the spell.â The Leader lies before his tent Gazing at heaven's all-cheering lamp Through blandness of a morning rare; His thoughts on bitter-sweets are bent: His sunny bride is in the campâ But Mosbyâgraves are beds of damp! The trumpet calls; he goes within; But none the prayer and sob may know: Her hero he, but bridegroom too. Ah, love in a tent is a queenly thing, And fame, be sure, refines the vow; But fame fond wives have lived to rue, And Mosby's men fell deeds can do. Tan-tara! tan-tara! tan-tara! Mounted and armed he sits a king; For pride she smiles if now she peepâ Elate he rides at the head of his men; He is young, and command is a boyish thing: They file out into the forest deepâ Do Mosby and his rangers sleep? The sun is gold, and the world is green, Opal the vapors of morning roll; The champing horses lightly pranceâ Full of caprice, and the riders too Curving in many a caricole. But marshaled soon, by fours advanceâ Mosby had checked that airy dance. By the hospital-tent the cripples standâ Bandage, and crutch, and cane, and sling, And palely eye the brave array; The froth of the cup is gone for them (Caw! caw! the crows through the blueness wing): Yet these were late as bold, as gay; But Mosbyâa clip, and grass is hay. How strong they feel on their horses free, Tingles the tendoned thigh with life; Their calvary jackets make boys of allâ With golden breasts like the oriole; The chat, the jest, and laugh are rife. But word is passed from the frontâa call For order; the wood is Mosby's hall. To which behest one rider sly (Spurred, but unarmed) gave little heedâ Of dexterous fun not slow or spare, He teased his neighbors of touchy mood, Into plungings he pricked his steed: A black-eyed man on a coal-black mare, Alive as Mosby in mountain air. His limbs were long, and large, and round; He whispered, winkedâdid all but shout: A healthy man for the sick to view; The taste in his mouth was sweet at morn; Little of care he cared about. And yet of pains and pangs he knewâ In others, maimed by Mosby's crew. The Hospital Stewardâeven he (Sacred in person as a priest), And on his coat-sleeve broidered nice Wore the caduceus, black and green. No wonder he sat so light on his beast; This cheery man in suit of price Not even Mosby dared to slice. They pass the picket by the pine And hollow logâa dreary place; His horse adroop, and pistol clean; 'Tis cockedâkept leveled toward the wood; Strained vigilance ages his childish face. Since midnight has that stripling been Peering for Mosby through the green. Splashing they cross the freshet-flood, And up the muddy bank they strain; A horse at a spectral white-ash shiesâ One of the span of the ambulance, Black as a hearse. They give the rein: Silent speed on a scout were wise, Could cunning baffle Mosby's spies. Rumor had come that a band was lodged In green retreats of hills that peer By Aldie (famed for the swordless charge). Much store they'd heaped of captured arms And, peradventure, pilfered cheer; For Mosby's lads oft hearts enlarge In revelry by some gorge's marge. âDon't let your sabres rattle and ring; To his oat-bag let each man give heedâ There now, that fellow's bag's untied, Sowing the road with the precious grain. Your carbines swing at handâyou need! Look to yourselves, and your nags beside, Men who after Mosby ride.â Picked lads and keen went sharp beforeâ A guard, though scarce against surprise; And rearmost rode an answering troop, But flankers none to right or left. No bugle peals, no pennon flies: Silent they sweep, and fain would swoop On Mosby with an Indian whoop. On, right on through the forest land, Nor man, nor maid, nor child was seenâ Not even a dog. The air was still; The blackened hut they turned to see, And spied charred benches on the green; A squirrel sprang from the rotting mill Whence Mosby sallied late, brave blood to spill. By worn-out fields they cantered onâ Drear fields amid the woodlands wide; By cross-roads of some olden time, In which grew groves; by gate-stones downâ Grassed ruins of secluded pride: A spell-bound land, long past the prime, Fit land for Mosby or for crime. The brook in the dell they pass. One peers Between the leaves: âAy, there's the placeâ There, on the oozy ledgeâ'twas there We found the body (Blake's, you know); Such whirlings, gurglings round the faceâ Shot drinking! Well, in war all's fairâ So Mosby says. The boughâtake care!â Hard by, a chapel. Flower-pot mould Danked and decayed the shaded roof; The porch was punk; the clapboards spanned With ruffled lichens gray or green; Red coral-moss was not aloof; And mid dry leaves green dead-man's-hand Groped toward that chapel in Mosby-land. The road they leave and take the wood, And mark the trace of ridges thereâ A wood where once had slept the farmâ A wood where once tobacco grew Drowsily in the hazy air, And wrought in all kind things a calmâ Such influence, Mosby! bids disarm. To ease even yet the place did wooâ To ease which pines unstirring share, For ease the weary horses sighed: Halting, and slackening girths, they feed, Their pipes they light, they loiter there; Then up, and urging still the Guide, On, and after Mosby ride. This Guide in frowzy coat of brown, And beard of ancient growth and mould, Bestrode a bony steed and strong, As suited well with bulk he boreâ A wheezy man with depth of hold Who jouncing went. A staff he swungâ A wight whom Mosby's wasp had stung. Burnt out and homelessâhunted long! That wheeze he caught in autumn-wood Crouching (a fat man) for his life, And spied his lean son 'mong the crew That probed the covert. Ah! black blood Was his 'gainst even child and wifeâ Fast friends to Mosby. Such the strife. A lad, unhorsed by sliding girths, Strains hard to readjust his seat Ere the main body show the gap 'Twixt them and the rear-guard; scrub-oaks near He sidelong eyes, while hands move fleet; Then mounts and spurs. One drops his capâ âLet Mosby find!â nor heeds mishap. A gable time-stained peeps through trees: âYou mind the fight in the haunted house? That's it; we clenched them in the roomâ An ambuscade of ghosts, we deemed, But proved sly rebels on a bouse! Luke lies in the yard.â The chimneys loom: Some muse on Mosbyâsome on doom. Less nimbly now through brakes they wind, And ford wild creeks where men have drowned; The pool they skirt, avoid the fen, And so till night, when down they lie, Their steeds still saddled, in wooded ground: Rein in hand they slumber then, Dreaming of Mosby's cedarn den. But Colonel and Major friendly sat Where boughs deformed low made a seat. The Young Man talked (all sworded and spurred) Of the partisan's blade he longed to win, And frays in which he meant to beat. The grizzled Major smoked, and heard: âBut what's whatâMosby?â âNo, a bird.â A contrast here like sire and son, Hope and Experience sage did meet; The Youth was brave, the Senior too; But through the Seven Days one had served, And gasped with the rear-guard in retreat: So he smoked and smoked, and the wreath he blewâ âAny sure news of Mosby's crew?â He smoked and smoked, eyeing the while A huge tree hydra-like in growthâ Moon-tingedâwith crook'd boughs rent or loppedâ Itself a haggard forest. âCome!â The Colonel cried, âto talk you're loath; D'ye hear? I say he must be stopped, This Mosbyâcaged, and hair close cropped.â âOf course; but what's that dangling there?â âWhere?â âFrom the treeâthat gallows-bough;â âA bit of frayed bark, is it not?â âAyâor a rope; did we hang last?â Don't like my neckerchief any how;â He loosened it: âO ay, we'll stop This Mosbyâbut that vile jerk and drop!â By peep of light they feed and ride, Gaining a grove's green edge at morn, And mark the Aldie hills uprear And five gigantic horsemen carved Clear-cut against the sky withdrawn; Are more behind? an open snare? Or Mosby's men but watchmen there? The ravaged land was miles behind, And Loudon spread her landscape rare; Orchards in pleasant lowlands stood, Cows were feeding, a cock loud crew, But not a friend at need was there; The valley-folk were only good To Mosby and his wandering brood. What best to do? what mean yon men? Colonel and Guide their minds compare; Be sure some looked their Leader through; Dismounted, on his sword he leaned As one who feigns an easy air; And yet perplexed he was they knewâ Perplexed by Mosby's mountain-crew. The Major hemmed as he would speak, But checked himself, and left the ring Of cavalrymen about their Chiefâ Young courtiers mute who paid their court By looking with confidence on their king; They knew him brave, foresaw no griefâ But Mosbyâthe time for thought is brief. The Surgeon (sashed in sacred green) Was glad 'twas not for him to say What next should be; if a trooper bleeds, Why he will do his best, as wont, And his partner in black will aid and pray; But judgment bides with him who leads, And Mosby many a problem breeds. This Surgeon was the kindliest man That ever a callous trade professed; He felt for him, that Leader young, And offered medicine from his flask: The Colonel took it with marvelous zest. For such fine medicine good and strong, Oft Mosby and his foresters long. A charm of proof. âHo, Major, comeâ Pounce on yon men! Take half your troop, Through the thickets windâpray speedy beâ And gain their rear. And, Captain Morn, Picket these roadsâall travelers stop; The rest to the edge of this crest with me, That Mosby and his scouts may see.â Commanded and done. Ere the sun stood steep, Back came the Blues, with a troop of Grays, Ten riding doubleâluckless ten!â Five horses gone, and looped hats lost, And love-locks dancing in a mazeâ Certes, but sophomores from the glen Of Mosbyânot his veteran men. âColonel,â said the Major, touching his cap, âWe've had our ride, and here they are.â âWell done! how many found you there?â âAs many as I bring you here.â âAnd no one hurt?â âThere'll be no scarâ One fool was battered.â âFind their lair?â âWhy, Mosby's brood camp every where.â He sighed, and slid down from his horse, And limping went to a spring-head nigh. âWhy, bless me, Major, not hurt, I hope?â âBattered my knee against a bar When the rush was made; all right by-and-by.â Halloa! they gave you too much ropeâ Go back to Mosby, eh? elope?â Just by the low-hanging skirt of wood The guard, remiss, had given a chance For a sudden sally into the coverâ But foiled the intent, nor fired a shot, Though the issue was a deadly trance; For, hurled 'gainst an oak that humped low over, Mosby's man fell, pale as a lover. They pulled some grass his head to ease (Lined with blue shreds a ground-nest stirred). The Surgeon cameââHere's a to-do!â âAh!â cried the Major, darting a glance, âThis fellow's the one that fired and spurred Down hill, but met reserves belowâ My boys, not Mosby'sâso we go!â The Surgeonâbluff, red, goodly manâ Kneeled by the hurt one; like a bee He toiled. The pale young Chaplain tooâ (Who went to the wars for cure of souls, And his own student-ailments)âhe Bent over likewise; spite the two Mosby's poor man more pallid grew. Meanwhile the mounted captives near Jested; and yet they anxious showed; Virginians; some of family-pride, And young, and full of fire, and fine In open feature and cheek that glowed; And here thralled vagabonds now they rideâ But list! one speaks for Mosby's side. âWhy, three to oneâyour horses strongâ Revolvers, rifles, and a surpriseâ Surrender we account no shame! We live, are gay, and life is hope; We'll fight again when fight is wise. There are plenty more from where we came; But go find Mosbyâstart the game!â Yet one there was who looked but glum; In middle-age, a father he, And this his first experience too: âThey shot at my heart when my hands were upâ This fighting's crazy work, I see!â But noon is high; what next to do? The woods are mute, and Mosby is the foe. âSave what we've got,â the Major said; âBad plan to make a scout too long; The tide may turn, and drag them back, And more beside. These rides I've been, And every time a mine was sprung. To rescue, mind, they won't be slackâ Look out for Mosby's rifle-crack.â âWe welcome it! give crack for crack! Peril, old lad, is what I seek.â âO then, there's plenty to be hadâ By all means on, and have our fill!â With that, grotesque, he writhed his neck, Showing a scar by buck-shot madeâ Kind Mosby's Christmas gift, he said. âBut, Colonel, my prisonersâlet a guard Make sure of them, and lead to camp. That done, we're free for a dark-room fight If so you say.â The other laughed; âTrust me, Major, nor throw a damp. But first to try a little sleightâ Sure news of Mosby would suit me quite.â Herewith he turnedââReb, have a dram?â Holding the Surgeon's flask with a smile To a young scapegrace from the glen. âOh yes!â he eagerly replied, âAnd thank you, Colonel, butâany guile? For if you think we'll blabâwhy, then You don't know Mosby or his men.â The Leader's genial air relaxed. âBest give it up,â a whisperer said. âBy heaven, I'll range their rebel den!â âThey'll treat you well,â the captive cried; âThey're all like usâhandsomeâwell-bred; In wood or town, with sword or pen, Polite is Mosby, bland his men.â âWhere were you, lads, last night?âcome, tell!â âWe?âat a wedding in the Valeâ The bridegroom our comrade; by his side Belisent, my cousinâO, so proud Of her young love with old wounds paleâ A Virginian girl! God bless her prideâ Of a crippled Mosby-man the bride!â âFour walls shall mend that saucy mood, And moping prisons tame him down,â Said Captain Cloud. âGod help that day,â Cried Captain Morn, âand he so young. But hark, he singsâa madcap one!â âO, we multiply merrily in the May, The birds and Mosby's men, they say!â While echoes ran, a wagon old, Under stout guard of Corporal Chew Came up; a lame horse, dingy white, With clouted harness; ropes in hand, Cringed the humped driver, black in hue; By him (for Mosby's band a sight) A sister-rebel sat, her veil held tight. âI picked them up,â the Corporal said, âCrunching their way over stick and root, Through yonder wood. The man hereâCuffâ Says they are going to Leesburg town.â The Colonel's eye took in the group; The veiled one's hand he spiedâenough! Not Mosby's. Spite the gown's poor stuff, Off went his hat: âLady, fear not; We soldiers do what we deploreâ I must detain you till we march.â The stranger nodded. Nettled now, He grew politer than before:â â'Tis Mosby's fault, this halt and search:â The lady stiffened in her starch. âMy duty, madam, bids me now Ask what may seem a little rude. Pardonâthat veilâwithdraw it, please (Corporal! make every man fall back); Pray, now, I do but what I should; Bethink you, 'tis in masks like these That Mosby haunts the villages.â Slowly the stranger drew her veil, And looked the Soldier in the eyeâ A glance of mingled foul and fair; Sad patience in a proud disdain, And more than quietude. A sigh She heaved, as if all unaware, And far seemed Mosby from her care. She came from Yewton Place, her home, So ravaged by the war's wild playâ Campings, and foragings, and firesâ That now she sought an aunt's abode. Her kinsmen? In Lee's army, they. The black? A servant, late her sire's. And Mosby? Vainly he inquires. He gazed, and sad she met his eye; âIn the wood yonder were you lost?â No; at the forks they left the road Because of hoof-prints (thick they wereâ Thick as the words in notes thrice crossed), And fearful, made that episode. In fear of Mosby? None she showed. Her poor attire again he scanned: âLady, once more; I grieve to jar On all sweet usage, but must plead To have what peeps there from your dress; That letterâ'tis justly prize of war.â She startedâgave itâshe must need. â'Tis not from Mosby? May I read?â And straight such matter he perused That with the Guide he went apart. The Hospital Steward's turn began: âMust squeeze this darkey; every tap Of knowledge we are bound to start.â âGarry,â she said, âtell all you can Of Colonel Mosbyâthat brave man.â âDun know much, sare; and missis here Know less dan me. But dis I knowââ âWell, what?â âI dun know what I know.â âA knowing answer!â The hump-back coughed, Rubbing his yellowish wool like tow. âComeâMosbyâtell!â âO dun look so! My gal nursed missisâlet we go.â âGo where?â demanded Captain Cloud; âBack into bondage? Man, you're free!â âWell, let we free!â The Captain's brow Lowered; the Colonel cameâhad heard: âPooh! pooh! his simple heart I seeâ A faithful servant.âLadyâ (a bow), âMosby's abroadâwith us you'll go. âGuard! look to your prisoners; back to camp! The man in the grassâcan he mount and away? Why, how he groans!â âBad inward bruiseâ Might lug him along in the ambulance.â âCoals to Newcastle! let him stay. Boots and saddles!âour pains we lose, Nor care I if Mosby hear the news!â But word was sent to a house at hand, And a flask was left by the hurt one's side. They seized in that same house a man, Neutral by day, by night a foeâ So charged his neighbor late, the Guide. A grudge? Hate will do what it can; Along he went for a Mosby-man. No secrets now; the bugle calls; The open road they take, nor shun The hill; retrace the weary way. But one there was who whispered low, âThis is a feintâwe'll back anon; Young Hair-Brains don't retreat, they say; A brush with Mosby is the play!â They rode till eve. Then on a farm That lay along a hill-side green, Bivouacked. Fires were made, and then Coffee was boiled; a cow was coaxed And killed, and savory roasts were seen; And under the lee of a cattle-pen The guard supped freely with Mosby's men. The ball was bandied to and fro; Hits were given and hits were met: âChickamauga, Fedsâtake off your hat!â âBut the Fight in the Clouds repaid you, Rebs!â âForgotten about Manassas yet?â Chatting and chaffing, and tit for tat, Mosby's clan with the troopers sat. âHere comes the moon!â a captive cried; âA song.â what say? Archy, my lad!â Hailing the still one of the clan (A boyish face with girlish hair), âGive us that thing poor Pansy made Last year.â He brightened, and began; And this was the song of Mosby's man: Spring is come; she shows her passâ Wild violets cool! South of woods a small close grassâ A vernal wool! Leaves are a'bud on the sassafrasâ They'll soon be full: Blessings on the friendly screenâ I'm for the South! says the leafage green. Robins! fly, and take your fill Of out-of-doorsâ Garden, orchard, meadow, hill, Barns and bowers; Take your fill, and have your willâ Virginia's yours! But, bluebirds! keep away, and fear The ambuscade in bushes here. âA green song that,â a sergeant said; âBut where's poor Pansy? gone, I fear.â âAy, mustered out at Ashby's Gap.â âI see; now for a live man's song; Ditty for dittyâprepare to cheer. Comrades, you can fling a cap! You barehead Mosby-boysâwhyâclap!â Nine Blue-coats went a-nutting Slyly in Tennesseeâ Not for chestnutsâbetter than thatâ Hush, you bumble-bee! Nutting, nuttingâ All through the year there's nutting! A tree they spied so yellow, Rustling in motion queer; In they fired, and down they droppedâ Butternuts, my dear! Nutting, nuttingâ Who'll 'list to go a-nutting? Ah! why should good fellows foemen be? And who would dream that foes they wereâ Larking and singing so friendly thenâ A family likeness in every face. But Captain Cloud made sour demur: âGuard! keep your prisoners in the pen, And let none talk with Mosby's men.â That captain was a valorous one (No irony, but honest truth), Yet down from his brain cold drops distilled, Making stalactites in his heartâ A conscientious soul, forsooth; And with a formal hate was filled Of Mosby's band; and some he'd killed. Meantime the lady rueful sat, Watching the flicker of a fire Where the Colonel played the outdoor host In brave old hall of ancient Night. But ever the dame grew shyer and shyer, Seeming with private grief engrossedâ Grief far from Mosby, housed or lost. The ruddy embers showed her pale. The Soldier did his best devoir: âSome coffee?âno?âa cracker?âone?â Cared for her servantâsought to cheer: âI know, I knowâa cruel war! But waitâeven Mosby'll eat his bun; The Old Hearthâback to it anon!â But cordial words no balm could bring; She sighed, and kept her inward chafe, And seemed to hate the voice of gleeâ Joyless and tearless. Soon he called An escort: âSee this lady safe In yonder house.âMadam, you're free. And now for Mosby.âGuide! with me.â (âA night-ride, ehâ) âTighten your girths! But, buglers! not a note from you. Fling more rails on the firesâa blaze!â (âSergeant, a feintâI told you soâ Toward Aldie again. Bivouac, adieu!) After the cheery flames they gaze, Then back for Mosby through the maze. The moon looked through the trees, and tipped The scabbards with her elfin beam; The Leader backward cast his glance, Proud of the cavalcade that cameâ A hundred horses, bay and cream: âMajor! look how the lads advanceâ Mosby we'll have in the ambulance!â âNo doubt, no doubt:âwas that a hare?â First catch, then cook; and cook him brown.â âTrust me to catch,â the other criedâ âThe lady's letter!âa dance, man, dance This night is given in Leesburg town!â âHe'll be there, too!â wheezed out the Guide; âThat Mosby loves a dance and ride!â âThe lady, ah!âthe lady's letterâ A lady, then, is in the case,â Muttered the Major. âAy, her aunt Writes her to come by Friday eve (To-night), for people of the place, At Mosby's last fight jubilant, A party give, though table-cheer be scant.â The Major hemmed. âThen this night-ride We owe to her?âOne lighted house In a town else dark.âThe moths, begar! Are not quite yet all dead!â âHow? how?â âA mute, meek, mournful little mouse!â Mosby has wiles which subtle areâ But woman's wiles in wiles of war!â âTut, Major! by what craft or guileââ âCan't tell! but he'll be found in wait. Softly we enter, say, the townâ Good! pickets post, and all so sureâ Whenâcrack! the rifles from every gate, The Grey-backs fireâdash up and downâ Each alley unto Mosby's known!â âNow, Major, nowâyou take dark views Of a moonlight night.â âWell, well, we'll see,â And smoked as if each whiff were gain. The other mused; then sudden asked, âWhat would you do in grand decree?â âI'd beat, if I could, Lee's armiesâthen Send constables after Mosby's men.â âAy, ay!âyou're odd.â The moon sailed up; On through the shadowy land they went. âNames must be made and printed be!â Hummed the blithe Colonel. âDoc, your flask! Major, I drink to your good content. My pipe is outâenough for me! This gold-lace gleamsâdoes Mosby see? âBut what comes here?â A man from the front Reported a tree athwart the road. âGo round it, then; no time to bide; All rightâgo on! Were one to stay For each distrust of a nervous mood, Long miles we'd make in this our ride Through Mosby-land.âOn! with the Guide!â Then sportful to the Surgeon turned: âGreen sashes hardly serve by night!â âNor bullets nor bottles,â the Major sighed, âAgainst these moccasin-snakesâsuch foes As seldom come to solid fight: They kill and vanish; through grass they glide; Devil take Mosby!ââhis horse here shied. âHold! lookâthe tree, like a dragged balloon; A globe of leavesâsome trickery here; My nag is rightâbest now be shy.â A movement was made, a hubbub and snarl; Little was plainâthey blindly steer. The Pleiads, as from ambush sly, Peep outâMosby's men in the sky! As restive they turn, how sore they feel, And cross, and sleepy, and full of spleen, And curse the war. âFools, North and South!â Said one right out. âO for a bed! O now to drop in this woodland green!â He drops as the syllables leave his mouth Mosby speaks from the undergrowthâ Speaks in a volley! out jets the flame! Men fall from their saddles like plums from trees; Horses take fright, reins tangle and bind; âSteadyâdismountâformâand into the wood!â They go, but find what scarce can please: Their steeds have been tied in the field behind, And Mosby's men are off like the wind. Sound the recall! vain to pursueâ The enemy scatters in wilds he knows, To reunite in his own good time; And, to follow, they need divideâ To come astray on crouching foes: Maple and hemlock, beech and lime, Are Mosby's confederates, share the crime. âMajor,â burst in a bugler small, âThe fellow we left in Loudon grassâ Sir Slyboots with the inward bruise, His voice I heardâthe very sameâ Some watchword in the ambush pass; Ay, sir, we had him in his shoesâ We caught himâMosbyâbut to lose!â âGo, go!âthese saddle-dreamers! Well, And here's another.âCool, sir, cool!â âMajor, I saw them mount and sweep, And one was bumped, or I mistake, And in the skurry dropped his wool.â âA wig! go fetch it:âthe lads need sleep; They'll next see Mosby in a sheep! âCome, come, fall back! reform your ranksâ All's jackstraws here! Where's Captain Morn?â We've parted like boats in a raging tide! But stayâthe Colonelâdid he charge? And comes he there? 'Tis streak of dawn; Mosby is off, the woods are wideâ Hist! there's a groanâthis crazy ride!â As they searched for the fallen, the dawn grew chill; They lay in the dew: âAh, hurt much, Mink? Andâyesâthe Colonel!â Dead! but so calm That death seemed nothingâeven death, The thing we deem every thing heart can think; Amid wilding roses that shed their balm, Careless of Mosby he layâin a charm! The Major took him by the handâ Into the friendly clasp it bled (A ball through heart and hand he rued): âGood-bye!â and gazed with humid glance; Then in a hollow revery said, âThe weakest thing is lustihood; But Mosbyââand he checked his mood. âWhere the advance?âcut off, by heaven! Come, Surgeon, how with your wounded there?â âThe ambulance will carry all.â âWell, get them in; we go to camp. Seven prisoners gone? for the rest have care.â Then to himself, âThis grief is gall; That Mosby!âI'll cast a silver ball!â âHo!â turningââCaptain Cloud, you mind The place where the escort wentâso shady? Go, search every closet low and high, And barn, and bin, and hidden bowerâ Every covertâfind that lady! And yet I may misjudge herâay, Women (like Mosby) mystify. âWe'll see. Ay, Captain, goâwith speed! Surround and search; each living thing Secure; that done, await us where We last turned off. Stay! fire the cage If the birds be flown.â By the cross-road spring The bands rejoined; no word; the glare Told all. Had Mosby plotted there? The weary troop that wended nowâ Hardly it seemed the same that pricked Forth to the forest from the camp: Foot-sore horses, jaded men; Every backbone felt as nicked, Each eye dim as a sick-room lamp, All faces stamped with Mosby's stamp. In order due the Major rodeâ Chaplain and Surgeon on either hand; A riderless horse a negro led; In a wagon the blanketed sleeper went; Then the ambulance with the bleeding band; And, an emptied oat-bag on each head, Went Mosby's men, and marked the dead. What gloomed them? what so cast them down, And changed the cheer that late they took, As double-guarded now they rode Between the files of moody men? Some sudden consciousness they brook, Or dread the sequel. That night's blood Disturbed even Mosby's brotherhood. The flagging horses stumbled at roots, Floundered in mires, or clinked the stones; No ride spake except aside; But the wounded cramped in the ambulance, It was horror to hear their groansâ Jerked along in the woodland ride, While Mosby's clan their revery hide. The Hospital Stewardâeven heâ Who on the sleeper kept his glance, Was changed; late bright-black beard and eye Looked now hearse-black; his heavy heart, Like his fagged mare, no more could dance; His grape was now a raisin dry: 'Tis Mosby's homilyâMan must die. The amber sunset flushed the camp As on the hill their eyes they fed; The pickets dumb looks at the wagon dart; A handkerchief waves from the bannered tentâ As white, alas! the face of the dead: Who shall the withering news impart? The bullet of Mosby goes through heart to heart! They buried him where the lone ones lie (Lone sentries shot on midnight post)â A green-wood grave-yard hid from ken, Where sweet-fern flings an odor nighâ Yet held in fear for the gleaming ghost! Though the bride should see threescore and ten, She will dream of Mosby and his men. Now halt the verse, and turn asideâ The cypress falls athwart the way; No joy remains for bard to sing; And heaviest dole of all is this, That other hearts shall be as gay As hers that now no more shall spring: To Mosby-land the dirges cling. LEE IN THE CAPITOL (April, 1866) Hard pressed by numbers in his strait Rebellion's soldier-chief no more contendsâ Feels that the hour is come of Fate, Lays down one sword, and widened warfare ends. The captain who fierce armies led Becomes a quiet seminary's headâ Poor as his privates, earns his bread. In studious cares and aims engrossed, Strives to forget Stuart and Stonewall deadâ Comrades and cause, station and riches lost, And all the ills that flock when fortune's fled. No word he breathes of vain lament, Mute to reproach, nor hears applauseâ His doom accepts, perforce content, And acquiesces in asserted laws; Secluded now would pass his life, And leave to time the sequel of the strife. But missives from the Senators ran; Not that they now would gaze upon a swordless foe, And power made powerless and brought low: Reasons of state, 'tis claimed, require the man. Demurring not, promptly he comes By ways which show the blackened homes, Andâlastâthe seat no more his own, But Honor's; patriot grave-yards fill The forfeit slopes of that patrician hill, And fling a shroud on Arlington. The oaks ancestral all are low; No more from the porch his glance shall go Ranging the varied landscape o'er, Far as the looming Domeâno more. One look he gives, then turns aside, Solace he summons from his pride: âSo be it! They await me now Who wrought this stinging overthrow; They wait me; not as on the day Of Pope's impelled retreat in disarrayâ By me impelledâwhen toward yon Dome The clouds of war came rolling home.â The burst, the bitterness was spent, The heart-burst bitterly turbulent, And on he fared. In nearness now He marks the Capitolâa show Lifted in amplitude, and set With standards flushed with the glow of Richmond yet; Trees and green terraces sleep below. Through the clear air, in sunny light, The marble dazesâa temple white. Intrepid soldier! had his blade been drawn For yon starred flag, never as now Bid to the Senate-house had he gone, But freely, and in pageant borne, As when brave numbers without number, massed, Plumed the broad way, and pouring passedâ Bannered, befloweredâbetween the shores Of faces, and the dinn'd huzzas, And balconies kindling at the sabre-flash, 'Mid roar of drums and guns, and cymbal-crash, While Grant and Sherman shone in blueâ Close of the war and victory's long review. Yet pride at hand still aidful swelled, And up the hard ascent he held. The meeting follows. In his mien The victor and the vanquished both are seenâ All that he is, and what he late had been. Awhile, with curious eyes they scan The Chief who led invasion's vanâ Allied by family to one, Founder of the Arch the Invader warred upon: Who looks at Lee must think of Washington; In pain must think, and hide the thought, So deep with grievous meaning it is fraught. Secession in her soldier shows Silent and patient; and they feel (Developed even in just success) Dim inklings of a hazy future steal; Their thoughts their questions well express: âDoes the sad South still cherish hate? Freely will Southern men with Northern mate? The blacksâshould we our arm withdraw, Would that betray them? some distrust your law. And how if foreign fleets should comeâ Would the South then drive her wedges home?â And more hereof. The Virginian seesâ Replies to such anxieties. Discreet his answers runâappear Briefly straightforward, coldly clear. âIf now,â the Senators, closing, say, âAught else remain, speak out, we pray.â Hereat he paused; his better heart Strove strongly then; prompted a worthier part Than coldly to endure his doom. Speak out? Ay, speak, and for the brave, Who else no voice or proxy have; Frankly their spokesman here become, And the flushed North from her own victory save. That inspiration overrodeâ Hardly it quelled the galling load Of personal ill. The inner feud He, self-contained, a while withstood; They waiting. In his troubled eye Shadows from clouds unseen they spy; They could not mark within his breast The pang which pleading thought oppressed: He spoke, nor felt the bitterness die. âMy word is givenâit ties my sword; Even were banners still abroad, Never could I strive in arms again While you, as fit, that pledge retain. Our cause I followed, stood in field and gateâ All's over now, and now I follow Fate. But this is naught. A People callâ A desolated land, and all The brood of ills that press so sore, The natural offspring of this civil war, Which ending not in fame, such as might rear Fitly its sculptured trophy here, Yields harvest large of doubt and dread To all who have the heart and head To feel and know. How shall I speak? Thoughts knot with thoughts, and utterance check. Before my eyes there swims a haze, Through mists departed comrades gazeâ First to encourage, last that shall upbraid! How shall I speak? The South would fain Feel peace, have quiet law againâ Replant the trees for homestead-shade. You ask if she recants: she yields. Nay, and would more; would blend anew, As the bones of the slain in her forests do, Bewailed alike by us and you. A voice comes out from those charnel-fields, A plaintive yet unheeded one: âDied all in vain? both sides undone?â Push not your triumph; do not urge Submissiveness beyond the verge. Intestine rancor would you bide, Nursing eleven sliding daggers in your side? Far from my thought to school or threat; I speak the things which hard beset. Where various hazards meet the eyes, To elect in magnanimity is wise. Reap victory's fruit while sound the core; What sounder fruit than re-established law? I know your partial thoughts do press Solely on us for war's unhappy stress; But weighâconsiderâlook at all, And broad anathema you'll recall. The censor's charge I'll not repeat, That meddlers kindled the war's white heatâ Vain intermeddlers or malign, Both of the palm and of the pine; I waive the thoughtâwhich never can be rifeâ Common's the crime in every civil strife: But this I feel, that North and South were driven By Fate to arms. For our unshriven, What thousands, truest souls, were triedâ As never may any be againâ All those who stemmed Secession's pride, But at last were swept by the urgent tide Into the chasm. I know their pain. A story here may be applied: âIn Moorish lands there lived a maid Brought to confess by vow the creed Of Christians. Fain would priests persuade That now she must approve by deed The faith she kept. âWhat deed?â she asked. âYour old sire leave, nor deem it sin, And come with us.â Still more they tasked The sad one: âIf heaven you'd winâ Far from the burning pit withdraw, Then must you learn to hate your kin, Yea, side against themâsuch the law, For Moor and Christian are at war.â âThen will I never quit my sire, But here with him through every trial go, Nor leave him though in flames belowâ God help me in his fire!â So in the South; vain every plea 'Gainst Nature's strong fidelity; True to the home and to the heart, Throngs cast their lot with kith and kin, Foreboding, cleaved to the natural partâ Was this the unforgivable sin? These noble spirits are yet yours to win. Shall the great North go Sylla's way? Proscribe? prolong the evil day? Confirm the curse? infix the hate? In Union's name forever alienate? From reason who can urge the pleaâ Freemen conquerors of the free? When blood returns to the shrunken vein, Shall the wound of the Nation bleed again? Well may the wars wan thought supply, And kill the kindling of the hopeful eye, Unless you do what even kings have done In leniencyâunless you shun To copy Europe in her worst estateâ Forbear to wreak the ill you reprobate.â He ceased. His earnestness unforeseen Moved, but not swayed their former mien; And they dismissed him. Forth he went Through vaulted walks in lengthened line Like porches erst upon the Palatine: Historic reveries their lesson lent, The Past her shadow through the Future sent. But no. Brave though the Soldier, grave his pleaâ Catching the light in the future's skies, Instinct disowns each darkening prophecy: Faith in America never dies; Heaven shall the end ordained fulfill. We march with Providence cheery still. A MEDITATION ATTRIBUTED TO A NORTHERNER AFTER ATTENDING THE LAST OF TWO FUNERALS FROM THE SAME HOMESTEADâTHOSE OF A NATIONAL AND A CONFEDERATE OFFICER (BROTHERS), HIS KINSMEN, WHO HAD DIED FROM THE EFFECTS OF WOUNDS RECEIVED IN THE CLOSING BATTLES How often in the years that close, When truce had stilled the sieging gun, The soldiers, mounting on their works, With mutual curious glance have run From face to face along the fronting show, And kinsman spied, or friendâeven in a foe. What thoughts conflicting then were shared, While sacred tenderness perforce Welled from the heart and wet the eye; And something of a strange remorse Rebelled against the sanctioned sin of blood, And Christian wars of natural brotherhood. Then stirred the god within the breastâ The witness that is man's at birth; A deep misgiving undermined Each plea and subterfuge of earth; They felt in that rapt pause, with warning rife, Horror and anguish for the civil strife. Of North or South they recked not then, Warm passion cursed the cause of war: Can Africa pay back this blood Spilt on Potomac's shore? Yet doubts, as pangs, were vain the strife to stay, And hands that fain had clasped again could slay. How frequent in the camp was seen The herald from the hostile one, A guest and frank companion there When the proud formal talk was done; The pipe of peace was smoked even 'mid the war, And fields in Mexico again fought o'er. In Western battle long they lay So near opposed in trench or pit, That foeman unto foeman called As men who screened in tavern sit: âYou bravely fightâ each to the other saidâ âToss us a biscuit!â o'er the wall it sped. And pale on those same slopes, a boyâ A stormer, bled in noon-day glare; No aid the Blue-coats then could bring, He cried to them who nearest were, And out there came 'mid howling shot and shell A daring foe who him befriended well. Mark the great Captains on both sides, The soldiers with the broad renownâ They all were messmates on the Hudson's marge, Beneath one roof they laid them down; And, free from hate in many an after pass, Strove as in school-boy rivalry of the class. A darker side there is; but doubt In Nature's charity hovers there: If men for new agreement yearn, Then old upbraiding best forbear: âThe South's the sinner!â Well, so let it be; But shall the North sin worse, and stand the Pharisee? O, now that brave men yield the sword, Mine be the manful soldier-view; By how much more they boldly warred, By so much more is mercy due: When Vicksburg fell, and the moody files marched out, Silent the victors stood, scorning to raise a shout.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JOHN MARR AND OTHER SAILORS JOHN MARR John Marr, toward the close of the last century born in America of a mother unknown, and from boyhood up to maturity a sailor under divers flags, disabled at last from further maritime life by a crippling wound received at close quarters with pirates of the Keys, eventually betakes himself for a livelihood to less active employment ashore. There, too, he transfers his rambling disposition acquired as a seafarer. After a variety of removals, at first as a sail-maker from sea-port to sea-port, then adventurously inland as a rough bench-carpenter, he, finally, in the last-named capacity, settles down about the year 1838 upon what was then a frontier-prairie, sparsely sprinkled with small oak-groves and yet fewer log-houses of a little colony but recently from one of our elder inland States. Here, putting a period to his rovings, he marries. Ere long a fever, the bane of new settlements on teeming loam, and whose sallow livery was certain to show itself, after an interval, in the complexions of too many of these people, carries off his young wife and infant child. In one coffin, put together by his own hands, they are committed with meager rites to the earthâanother mound, though a small one, in the wide prairie, not far from where the mound-builders of a race only conjecturable had left their pottery and bones, one common clay, under a strange terrace serpentine in form. With an honest stillness in his general mienâswarthy and black-browed, with eyes that could soften or flash, but never harden, yet disclosing at times a melancholy depthâthis kinless man had affections which, once placed, not readily could be dislodged or resigned to a substituted object. Being now arrived at middle-life, he resolves never to quit the soil that holds the only beings ever connected with him by love in the family tie. His log-house he lets to a new-comer, one glad enough to get it, and dwells with the household. While the acuter sense of his bereavement becomes mollified by time, the void at heart abides. Fain, if possible, would he fill that void by cultivating social relations yet nearer than before with a people whose lot he purposes sharing to the endârelations superadded to that mere work-a-day bond arising from participation in the same outward hardships, making reciprocal helpfulness a matter of course. But here, and nobody to blame, he is obstructed. More familiarly to consort, men of a practical turn must sympathetically converse, and upon topics of real life. But, whether as to persons or events, one cannot always be talking about the present, much less speculating about the future; one must needs recur to the past, which, with the mass of men, where the past is in any personal way a common inheritance, supplies to most practical natures the basis of sympathetic communion. But the past of John Marr was not the past of these pioneers. Their hands had rested on the plow-tail, his upon the ship's helm. They knew but their own kind and their own usages; to him had been revealed something of the checkered globe. So limited unavoidably was the mental reach, and by consequence the range of sympathy, in this particular band of domestic emigrants, hereditary tillers of the soil, that the ocean, but a hearsay to their fathers, had now through yet deeper inland removal become to themselves little more than a rumor traditional and vague. They were a staid people; staid through habituation to monotonous hardship; ascetics by necessity not less than through moral bias; nearly all of them sincerely, however narrowly, religious. They were kindly at need, after their fashion; but to a man wontedâas John Marr in his previous homeless sojournings could not but have beenâto the free-and-easy tavern-clubs affording cheap recreation of an evening in certain old and comfortable sea-port towns of that time, and yet more familiar with the companionship afloat of the sailors of the same period, something was lacking. That something was geniality, the flower of life springing from some sense of joy in it, more or less. This their lot could not give to these hard-working endurers of the dispiriting malaria, âmen to whom a holiday never came,âand they had too much of uprightness and no art at all or desire to affect what they did not really feel. At a corn-husking, their least grave of gatherings, did the lone-hearted mariner seek to divert his own thoughts from sadness, and in some degree interest theirs, by adverting to aught removed from the crosses and trials of their personal surroundings, naturally enough he would slide into some marine story or picture, but would soon recoil upon himself and be silent, finding no encouragement to proceed. Upon one such occasion an elderly manâa blacksmith, and at Sunday gatherings an earnest exhorterâhonestly said to him, âFriend, we know nothing of that here.â Such unresponsiveness in one's fellow-creatures set apart from factitious life, and by their vocationâin those days little helped by machineryâstanding, as it were, next of kin to Nature; this, to John Marr, seemed of a piece with the apathy of Nature herself as envisaged to him here on a prairie where none but the perished mound-builders had as yet left a durable mark. The remnant of Indians thereaboutâall but exterminated in their recent and final war with regular white troops, a war waged by the Red Men for their native soil and natural rightsâhad been coerced into the occupancy of wilds not very far beyond the Mississippiâwilds then, but now the seats of municipalities and States. Prior to that, the bisons, once streaming countless in processional herds, or browsing as in an endless battle-line over these vast aboriginal pastures, had retreated, dwindled in number, before the hunters, in main a race distinct from the agricultural pioneers, though generally their advance-guard. Such a double exodus of man and beast left the plain a desert, green or blossoming indeed, but almost as forsaken as the Siberian Obi. Save the prairie-hen, sometimes startled from its lurking-place in the rank grass; and, in their migratory season, pigeons, high overhead on the wing, in dense multitudes eclipsing the day like a passing storm-cloud; save theseâthere being no wide woods with their underwoodâbirds were strangely few. Blank stillness would for hours reign unbroken on this prairie. âIt is the bed of a dried-up sea,â said the companionless sailorâno geologistâto himself, musing at twilight upon the fixed undulations of that immense alluvial expanse bounded only by the horizon, and missing there the stir that, to alert eyes and ears, animates at all times the apparent solitudes of the deep. But a scene quite at variance with one's antecedents may yet prove suggestive of them. Hooped round by a level rim, the prairie was to John Marr a reminder of ocean. With some of his former shipmates, chums on certain cruises, he had contrived, prior to this last and more remote removal, to keep up a little correspondence at odd intervals. But from tidings of anybody or any sort he, in common with the other settlers, was now cut off; quite cut off, except from such news as might be conveyed over the grassy billows by the last-arrived prairie-schoonerâthe vernacular term, in those parts and times, for the emigrant-wagon arched high over with sail-cloth, and voyaging across the vast champaign. There was no reachable post-office as yet; not even the rude little receptive box with lid and leather hinges, set up at convenient intervals on a stout stake along some solitary green way, affording a perch for birds, and which, later in the unintermitting advance of the frontier, would perhaps decay into a mossy monument, attesting yet another successive overleaped limit of civilized life; a life which in America can to-day hardly be said to have any western bound but the ocean that washes Asia. Throughout these plains, now in places overpopulous with towns overopulent; sweeping plains, elsewhere fenced off in every direction into flourishing farmsâpale townsmen and hale farmers alike, in part, the descendants of the first sallow settlers; a region that half a century ago produced little for the sustenance of man, but to-day launching its superabundant wheat-harvest on the world;âof this prairie, now everywhere intersected with wire and rail, hardly can it be said that at the period here written of there was so much as a traceable road. To the long-distance traveller the oak-groves, wide apart, and varying in compass and form; these, with recent settlements, yet more widely separate, offered some landmarks; but otherwise he steered by the sun. In early midsummer, even going but from one log-encampment to the next, a journey it might be of hours or good part of a day, travel was much like navigation. In some more enriched depressions between the long, green, graduated swells, smooth as those of ocean becalmed receiving and subduing to its own tranquillity the voluminous surge raised by some far-off hurricane of days previous, here one would catch the first indication of advancing strangers either in the distance, as a far sail at sea, by the glistening white canvas of the wagon, the wagon itself wading through the rank vegetation and hidden by it, or, failing that, when near to, in the ears of the team, peeking, if not above the tall tigerlilies, yet above the yet taller grass. Luxuriant, this wilderness; but, to its denizen, a friend left behind anywhere in the world seemed not alone absent to sight, but an absentee from existence. Though John Marr's shipmates could not all have departed life, yet as subjects of meditation they were like phantoms of the dead. As the growing sense of his environment threw him more and more upon retrospective musings, these phantoms, next to those of his wife and child, became spiritual companions, losing something of their first indistictness and putting on at last a dim semblance of mute life; and they were lit by that aureola circling over any object of the affections in the past for reunion with which an imaginative heart passionately yearns. He invokes there visionary ones,âstriving, as it were, to get into verbal communion with them, or, under yet stronger illusion, reproaching them for their silence:â Since as in night's deck-watch ye show, Why, lads, so silent here to me, Your watchmate of times long ago? Once, for all the darkling sea, You your voices raised how clearly, Striking in when tempest sung; Hoisting up the storm-sail cheerly, Life is stormâlet storm! you rung. Taking things as fated merely, Child-like though the world ye spanned; Nor holding unto life too dearly, Ye who hold your lives in handâ Skimmers, who on oceans four Petrels were, and larks ashore. O, not from memory lightly flung, Forgot, like strains no more availing, The heart to music haughtier strung; Nay, frequent near me, never staleing, Whose good feeling kept ye young. Like tides that enter creek or stream, Ye come, ye visit me, or seem Swimming out from seas of faces, Alien myriads memory traces, To enfold me in a dream! I yearn as ye. But rafts that strain, Parted, shall they lock again? Twined we were, entwined, then riven, Ever to new embracements driven, Shifting gulf-weed of the main! And how if one here shift no more, Lodged by the flinging surge ashore? Nor less, as now, in eve's decline, Your shadowy fellowship is mine. Ye float around me, form and feature:â Tattooings, ear-rings, love-locks curled; Barbarians of man's simpler nature, Unworldly servers of the world. Yea, present all, and dear to me, Though shades, or scouring China's sea. Whither, whither, merchant-sailors, Whitherward now in roaring gales? Competing still, ye huntsman-whalers, In leviathan's wake what boat prevails? And man-of-war's men, whereaway? If now no dinned drum beat to quarters On the wilds of midnight watersâ Foemen looming through the spray; Do yet your gangway lanterns, streaming, Vainly strive to pierce below, When, tilted from the slant plank gleaming, A brother you see to darkness go? But, gunmates lashed in shotted canvas, If where long watch-below ye keep, Never the shrill âAll hands up hammocks!â Breaks the spell that charms your sleep, And summoning trumps might vainly call, And booming guns imploreâ A beat, a heart-beat musters all, One heart-beat at heart-core. It musters. But to clasp, retain; To see you at the halyards mainâ To hear your chorus once again! BRIDEGROOM DICK (1876) Sunning ourselves in October on a day Balmy as spring, though the year was in decay, I lading my pipe, she stirring her tea, My old woman she says to me, âFeel ye, old man, how the season mellows?â And why should I not, blessed heart alive, Here mellowing myself, past sixty-five, To think o' the May-time o' pennoned young fellows This stripped old hulk here for years may survive. Ere yet, long ago, we were spliced, Bonny Blue, (Silvery it gleams down the moon-glade o' time, Ah, sugar in the bowl and berries in the prime!) Coxswain I o' the Commodore's crew,â Under me the fellows that manned his fine gig, Spinning him ashore, a king in full fig. Chirrupy even when crosses rubbed me, Bridegroom Dick lieutenants dubbed me. Pleasant at a yarn, Bob O'Linkum in a song, Diligent in duty and nattily arrayed, Favored I was, wife, and fleeted right along; And though but a tot for such a tall grade, A high quartermaster at last I was made. All this, old lassie, you have heard before, But you listen again for the sake e'en o' me; No babble stales o' the good times o' yore To Joan, if Darby the babbler be. Babbler?âO' what? Addled brains, they forget! Oâquartermaster I; yes, the signals set, Hoisted the ensign, mended it when frayed, Polished up the binnacle, minded the helm, And prompt every order blithely obeyed. To me would the officers say a word cheeryâ Break through the starch o' the quarter-deck realm; His coxswain late, so the Commodore's pet. Ay, and in night-watches long and weary, Bored nigh to death with the navy etiquette, Yearning, too, for fun, some younker, a cadet, Dropping for time each vain bumptious trick, Boy-like would unbend to Bridegroom Dick. But a limit there wasâa check, d'ye see: Those fine young aristocrats knew their degree. Well, stationed aft where their lordships keep,â Seldom going forward excepting to sleep,â I, boozing now on by-gone years, My betters recall along with my peers. Recall them? Wife, but I see them plain: Alive, alert, every man stirs again. Ay, and again on the lee-side pacing, My spy-glass carrying, a truncheon in show, Turning at the taffrail, my footsteps retracing, Proud in my duty, again methinks I go. And Dave, Dainty Dave, I mark where he stands, Our trim sailing-master, to time the high-noon, That thingumbob sextant perplexing eyes and hands, Squinting at the sun, or twigging o' the moon; Then, touching his cap to Old Chock-a-Block Commanding the quarter-deck,ââSir, twelve o'clock.â Where sails he now, that trim sailing-master, Slender, yes, as the ship's sky-s'l pole? Dimly I mind me of some sad disasterâ Dainty Dave was dropped from the navy-roll! And ah, for old Lieutenant Chock-a-Blockâ Fast, wife, chock-fast to death's black dock! Buffeted about the obstreperous ocean, Fleeted his life, if lagged his promotion. Little girl, they are all, all gone, I think, Leaving Bridegroom Dick here with lids that wink. Where is Ap Catesby? The fights fought of yore Famed him, and laced him with epaulets, and more. But fame is a wake that after-wakes cross, And the waters wallow all, and laugh Where's the loss? But John Bull's bullet in his shoulder bearing Ballasted Ap in his long sea-faring. The middies they ducked to the man who had messed With Decatur in the gun-room, or forward pressed Fighting beside Perry, Hull, Porter, and the rest. Humped veteran o' the Heart-o'-Oak war, Moored long in haven where the old heroes are, Never on you did the iron-clads jar! Your open deck when the boarder assailed, The frank old heroic hand-to-hand then availed. But where's Guert Gan? Still heads he the van? As before Vera-Cruz, when he dashed splashing through The blue rollers sunned, in his brave gold-and-blue, And, ere his cutter in keel took the strand, Aloft waved his sword on the hostile land! Went up the cheering, the quick chanticleering; All hands vyingâall colors flying: âCock-a-doodle-doo!â and âRow, boys, row!â âHey, Starry Banner!â âHi, Santa Anna!ââ Old Scott's young dash at Mexico. Fine forces o' the land, fine forces o' the sea, Fleet, army, and flotillaâtell, heart o' me, Tell, if you can, whereaway now they be! But ah, how to speak of the hurricane unchainedâ The Union's strands parted in the hawser over-strained; Our flag blown to shreds, anchors gone altogetherâ The dashed fleet o' States in Secession's foul weather. Lost in the smother o' that wide public stress, In hearts, private hearts, what ties there were snapped! Tell, Halâvouch, Will, o' the ward-room mess, On you how the riving thunder-bolt clapped. With a bead in your eye and beads in your glass, And a grip o' the flipper, it was part and pass: âHal, must it be; Well, if come indeed the shock, To North or to South, let the victory cleave, Vaunt it he may on his dung-hill the cock, But Uncle Sam's eagle never crow will, believe.â Sentiment: ay, while suspended hung all, Ere the guns against Sumter opened there the ball, And partners were taken, and the red dance began, War's red dance o' death!âWell, we, to a man, We sailors o' the North, wife, how could we lag?â Strike with your kin, and you stick to the flag! But to sailors o' the South that easy way was barred. To some, dame, believe (and I speak o' what I know), Wormwood the trial and the Uzzite's black shard; And the faithfuller the heart, the crueller the throe. Duty? It pulled with more than one string, This way and that, and anyhow a sting. The flag and your kin, how be true unto both? If one plight ye keep, then ye break the other troth. But elect here they must, though the casuists were out; Decideâhurry upâand throttle every doubt. Of all these thrills thrilled at keelson, and throes, Little felt the shoddyites a-toasting o' their toes; In mart and bazar Lucre chuckled the huzza, Coining the dollars in the bloody mint of war. But in men, gray knights o' the Order o' Scars, And brave boys bound by vows unto Mars, Nature grappled honor, intertwisting in the strife:â But some cut the knot with a thoroughgoing knife. For how when the drums beat? How in the fray In Hampton Roads on the fine balmy day? There a lull, wife, befellâdrop o' silence in the din. Let us enter that silence ere the belchings re-begin.â Through a ragged rift aslant in the cannonade's smoke An iron-clad reveals her repellent broadside Bodily intact. But a frigate, all oak, Shows honeycombed by shot, and her deck crimson-dyed. And a trumpet from port of the iron-clad hails, Summoning the other, whose flag never trails: âSurrender that frigate, Will! Surrender, Or I will sink herâram, and end her!â 'T was Hal. And Will, from the naked heart-o'-oak, Will, the old messmate, minus trumpet, spoke, Informally intrepid,ââSink her, and be damned!â Historic [Melville's note] Enough. Gathering way, the iron-clad rammed. The frigate, heeling over, on the wave threw a dusk. Not sharing in the slant, the clapper of her bell The fixed metal struckâuninvoked struck the knell Of the Cumberland stilettoed by the Merrimac's tusk; While, broken in the wound underneath the gun-deck, Like a sword-fish's blade in leviathan waylaid, The tusk was left infixed in the fast-foundering wreck. There, dungeoned in the cockpit, the wounded go down, And the chaplain with them. But the surges uplift The prone dead from deck, and for moment they drift Washed with the swimmers, and the spent swimmers drown. Nine fathom did she sink,âerect, though hid from light Save her colors unsurrendered and spars that kept the height. Nay, pardon, old aunty!âWife, never let it fall, That big started tear that hovers on the brim; I forgot about your nephew and the Merrimac's ball; No more then of her, since it summons up him. But talk o' fellows' hearts in the wine's genial cup:â Trap them in the fate, jamb them in the strait, Guns speak their hearts then, and speak right up. The troublous colic o' intestine war It sets the bowels o' affection ajar. But, lord, old dame, so spins the whizzing world, A humming-top, ay, for the little boy-gods Flogging it well with their smart little rods, Tittering at time and the coil uncurled. Now, now, sweetheart, you sidle away, No, never you like that kind o' gay; But sour if I get, giving truth her due, Honey-sweet forever, wife, will Dick be to you! But avast with the War! Why recall racking days Since set up anew are the ship's started stays? Nor less, though the gale we have left behind, Well may the heave o' the sea remind. It irks me now, as it troubled me then, To think o' the fate in the madness o' men. If Dick was with Farragut on the night-river, When the boom-chain we burst in the fire-raft's glare, That blood-dyed the visage as red as the liver; In the Battle for the Bay too if Dick had a share, And saw one aloft a-piloting the warâ Trumpet in the whirlwind, a Providence in placeâ Our Admiral old whom the captains huzza, Dick joys in the man nor brags about the race. But better, wife, I like to booze on the days Ere the Old Order foundered in these very frays, And tradition was lost and we learned strange ways. Often I think on the brave cruises then; Re-sailing them in memory, I hail the press o' men On the gunned promenade where rolling they go, Ere the dog-watch expire and break up the show. The Laced Caps I see between forward guns; Away from the powder-room they puff the cigar; âThree days more, hey, the donnas and the dons!â âYour Xeres widow, will you hunt her up, Starr?â The Laced Caps laugh, and the bright waves too; Very jolly, very wicked, both sea and crew, Nor heaven looks sour on either, I guess, Nor Pecksniff he bosses the gods' high mess. Wistful ye peer, wife, concerned for my head, And how best go get me betimes to my bed. But king o' the club, the gayest golden spark, Sailor o' sailors, what sailor do I mark? Tom Tight, Tom Tight, no fine fellow finer, A cutwater-nose, ay, a spirited soul; But, boozing away at the well-brewed bowl, He never bowled back from the voyage to China. Tom was lieutenant in the brig-o'-war famed When an officer was hung for an arch-mutineer, But a mystery cleaved, and the captain was blamed, And a rumpus too raised, though his honor it was clear. And Tom he would say, when the mousers would try him, And with cup after cup o' Burgundy ply him: âGentlemen, in vain with your wassail you beset, For the more I tipple, the tighter do I get.â No blabber, no, not even with the canâ True to himself and loyal to his clan. Tom blessed us starboard and d?d us larboard, Right down from rail to the streak o' the garboard. Nor less, wife, we liked him.âTom was a man In contrast queer with Chaplain Le Fan, Who blessed us at morn, and at night yet again, D?ning us only in decorous strain; Preaching 'tween the gunsâeach cutlass in its placeâ From text that averred old Adam a hard case. I see himâTomâon horse-block standing, Trumpet at mouth, thrown up all amain, An elephant's bugle, vociferous demanding Of topmen aloft in the hurricane of rain, âLetting that sail there your faces flog? Manhandle it, men, and you'll get the good grog!â O Tom, but he knew a blue-jacket's ways, And how a lieutenant may genially haze; Only a sailor sailors heartily praise. Wife, where be all these chaps, I wonder? Trumpets in the tempest, terrors in the fray, Boomed their commands along the deck like thunder; But silent is the sod, and thunder dies away. But Captain Turret, âOld Hemlockâ tall, (A leaning tower when his tank brimmed all,) Manoeuvre out alive from the war did he? Or, too old for that, drift under the lee? Kentuckian colossal, who, touching at Madeira, The huge puncheon shipped o' prime Santa-Clara; Then rocked along the deck so solemnly! No whit the less though judicious was enough In dealing with the Finn who made the great huff; Our three-decker's giant, a grand boatswain's mate, Manliest of men in his own natural senses; But driven stark mad by the devil's drugged stuff, Storming all aboard from his run-ashore late, Challenging to battle, vouchsafing no pretenses, A reeling King Ogg, delirious in power, The quarter-deck carronades he seemed to make cower. âPut him in brig there!â said Lieutenant Marrot. âPut him in brig!â back he mocked like a parrot; âTry it, then!â swaying a fist like Thor's sledge, And making the pigmy constables hedgeâ Ship's corporals and the master-at-arms. âIn brig there, I say!ââThey dally no more; Like hounds let slip on a desperate boar, Together they pounce on the formidable Finn, Pinion and cripple and hustle him in. Anon, under sentry, between twin guns, He slides off in drowse, and the long night runs. Morning brings a summons. Whistling it calls, Shrilled through the pipes of the boatswain's four aids; Trilled down the hatchways along the dusk halls: Muster to the Scourge!âDawn of doom and its blast! As from cemeteries raised, sailors swarm before the mast, Tumbling up the ladders from the ship's nether shades. Keeping in the background and taking small part, Lounging at their ease, indifferent in face, Behold the trim marines uncompromised in heart; Their Major, buttoned up, near the staff finds roomâ The staff o' lieutenants standing grouped in their place. All the Laced Caps o' the ward-room come, The Chaplain among them, disciplined and dumb. The blue-nosed boatswain, complexioned like slag, Like a blue Monday showsâhis implements in bag. Executioners, his aids, a couple by him stand, At a nod there the thongs to receive from his hand. Never venturing a caveat whatever may betide, Though functionally here on humanity's side, The grave Surgeon shows, like the formal physician Attending the rack o'the Spanish Inquisition. The angel o' the âbrigâ brings his prisoner up; Then, steadied by his old Santa-Clara, a sup, Heading all erect, the ranged assizes there, Lo, Captain Turret, and under starred bunting, (A florid full face and fine silvered hair,) Gigantic the yet greater giant confronting. Now the culprit he liked, as a tall captain can A Titan subordinate and true sailor-man; And frequent he'd shown itâno worded advance, But flattering the Finn with a well-timed glance. But what of that now? In the martinet-mien Read the Articles of War, heed the naval routine; While, cut to the heart a dishonor there to win, Restored to his senses, stood the Anak Finn; In racked self-control the squeezed tears peeping, Scalding the eye with repressed inkeeping. Discipline must be; the scourge is deemed due. But ah for the sickening and strange heart-benumbing, Compassionate abasement in shipmates that view; Such a grand champion shamed there succumbing! âBrown, tie him up.ââThe cord he brooked: How else?âhis arms spread apartânever threaping; No, never he flinched, never sideways he looked, Peeled to the waistband, the marble flesh creeping, Lashed by the sleet the officious winds urge. In function his fellows their fellowship mergeâ The twain standing highâthe two boatswain's mates, Sailors of his grade, ay, and brothers of his mess. With sharp thongs adroop the junior one awaits The word to uplift. âUntie himâso! Submission is enough.âMan, you may go.â Then, promenading aft, brushing fat Purser Smart, âFlog? Never meant itâhadn't any heart. Degrade that tall fellow?ââSuch, wife, was he, Old Captain Turret, who the brave wine could stow. Magnanimous, you think?âbut what does Dick see? Apron to your eye! Why, never fell a blow, Cheer up, old wifie, 't was a long time ago. But where's that sore one, crabbed and severe, Lieutenant Long Lumbago, an arch scrutineer? Call the roll to-day, would he answerâHere! When the Blixum's fellows to quarters mustered How he'd lurch along the lane of gun-crews clustered, Testy as touchwood, to pry and to peer. Jerking his sword underneath larboard arm, He ground his worn grinders to keep himself calm. Composed in his nerves, from the fidgets set free, Tell, Sweet Wrinkles, alive now is he, In Paradise a parlor where the even tempers be? Where's Commander All-a-Tanto? Where's Orlop Bob singing up from below? Where's Rhyming Ned? has he spun his last canto? Where's Jewsharp Jim? Where's Rigadoon Joe? Ah, for the music over and done, The band all dismissed save the droned trombone! Where's Glen o' the gun-room, who loved Hot-Scotchâ Glen, prompt and cool in a perilous watch? Where's flaxen-haired Phil? a gray lieutenant? Or rubicund, flying a dignified pennant? But where sleeps his brother?âthe cruise it was o'er, But ah, for death's grip that welcomed him ashore! Where's Sid, the cadet, so frank in his brag, Whose toast was audaciousââHere's Sid, and Sid's flag!â Like holiday-craft that have sunk unknown, May a lark of a lad go lonely down? Who takes the census under the sea? Can others like old ensigns be, Bunting I hoisted to flutter at the gaffâ Rags in end that once were flags Gallant streaming from the staff? Such scurvy doom could the chances deal To Top-Gallant Harry and Jack Genteel? Lo, Genteel Jack in hurricane weather, Shagged like a bear, like a red lion roaring; But O, so fine in his chapeau and feather, In port to the ladies never once jawing; All bland politesse, how urbane was heâ âOui, mademoiselleâââMa chÃ¨re amie!â 'T was Jack got up the ball at Naples, Gay in the old Ohio glorious; His hair was curled by the berth-deck barber, Never you'd deemed him a cub of rude Boreas; In tight little pumps, with the grand dames in rout, A-flinging his shapely foot all about; His watch-chain with love's jeweled tokens abounding, Curls ambrosial shaking out odors, Waltzing along the batteries, astounding The gunner glum and the grim-visaged loaders. Wife, where be all these blades, I wonder, Pennoned fine fellows, so strong, so gay? Never their colors with a dip dived under; Have they hauled them down in a lack-lustre day, Or beached their boats in the Far, Far Away? Hither and thither, blown wide asunder, Where's this fleet, I wonder and wonder. Slipt their cables, rattled their adieu, (Whereaway pointing? to what rendezvous?) Out of sight, out of mind, like the crack Constitution, And many a keel time never shall renewâ Bon Homme Dick o'the buff Revolution, The Black Cockade and the staunch True-Blue. Doff hats to Decatur! But where is his blazon? Must merited fame endure time's wrongâ Glory's ripe grape wizen up to a raisin? Yes! for Nature teems, and the years are strong, And who can keep the tally o' the names that fleet along! But his frigate, wife, his bride? Would blacksmiths brown Into smithereens smite the solid old renown? Rivetting the bolts in the iron-clad's shell, Hark to the hammers with a rat-tat-tat; âHandier a derby than a laced cocked hat! The Monitor was ugly, but she served us right well, Better than the Cumberland, a beauty and the belle.â Better than the Cumberland!âHeart alive in me! That battlemented hull, Tantallon o' the sea, Kicked in, as at Boston the taxed chests o' tea! Ay, spurned by the ram, once a tall, shapely craft, But lopped by the Rebs to an iron-beaked raftâ A blacksmith's unicorn in armor cap-a-pie. Under the water-line a ram's blow is dealt: And foul fall the knuckles that strike below the belt. Nor brave the inventions that serve to replace The openness of valor while dismantling the grace. Aloof from all this and the never-ending game, Tantamount to teetering, plot and counterplot; Impenetrable armorâall-perforating shot; Aloof, bless God, ride the war-ships of old, A grand fleet moored in the roadstead of fame; Not submarine sneaks with them are enrolled; Their long shadows dwarf us, their flags are as flame. Don't fidget so, wife; an old man's passion Amounts to no more than this smoke that I puff; There, there, now, buss me in good old fashion; A died-down candle will flicker in the snuff. But one last thing let your old babbler say, What Decatur's coxswain said who was long ago hearsed, âTake in your flying-kites, for there comes a lubber's day When gallant things will go, and the three-deckers first.â My pipe is smoked out, and the grog runs slack; But bowse away, wife, at your blessed Bohea; This empty can here must needs solace meâ Nay, sweetheart, nay; I take that back; Dick drinks from your eyes and he finds no lack! TOM DEADLIGHT (1810) During a tempest encountered homeward-bound from the Mediterranean, a grizzled petty-officer, one of the two captains of the forecastle, dying at night in his hammock, swung in the sick-bay under the tiered gun-decks of the British Dreadnought, 98, wandering in his mind, though with glimpses of sanity, and starting up at whiles, sings by snatches his good-bye and last injunctions to two messmates, his watchers, one of whom fans the fevered tar with the flap of his old sou'-wester. Some names and phrases, with here and there a line, or part of one; these, in his aberration, wrested into incoherency from their original connection and import, he involuntarily derives, as he does the measure, from a famous old sea-ditty, whose cadences, long rife, and now humming in the collapsing brain, attune the last flutterings of distempered thought. Farewell and adieu to you noble hearties,â Farewell and adieu to you ladies of Spain, For I've received orders for to sail for the Deadman, But hope with the grand fleet to see you again. I have hove my ship to, with main-top-sail aback, boys; I have hove my ship to, for to strike soundings clearâ The black scud a'flying; but, by God's blessing, dam' me, Right up the Channel for the Deadman I'll steer. I have worried through the waters that are callÃ¨d the Doldrums, And growled at Sargasso that clogs while ye gropeâ Blast my eyes, but the light-ship is hid by the mist, lads:â Flying Dutchmanâodds bobbsâoff the Cape of Good Hope! But what's this I feel that is fanning my cheek, Matt? The white goney's wing?âhow she rolls!â't is the Cape! Give my kit to the mess, Jock, for kin none is mine, none; And tell Holy Joe to avast with the crape. Dead reckoning, says Joe, it won't do to go by; But they doused all the glims, Matt, in sky t' other night. Dead reckoning is good for to sail for the Deadman; And Tom Deadlight he thinks it may reckon near right. The signal!âit streams for the grand fleet to anchor. The captainsâthe trumpetsâthe hullabaloo! Stand by for blue-blazes, and mind your shank-painters, For the Lord High Admiral, he's squinting at you! But give me my tot, Matt, before I roll over; Jock, let's have your flipper, it's good for to feel; And don't sew me up without baccy in mouth, boys, And don't blubber like lubbers when I turn up my keel. JACK ROY Kept up by relays of generations young Never dies at halyards the blithe chorus sung; While in sands, sounds, and seas where the storm-petrels cry, Dropped mute around the globe, these halyard singers lie. Short-lived the clippers for racing-cups that run, And speeds in life's career many a lavish mother's-son. But thou, manly king o' the old Splendid's crew, The ribbons o' thy hat still a-fluttering, should flyâ A challenge, and forever, nor the bravery should rue. Only in a tussle for the starry flag high, When 't is piety to do, and privilege to die. Then, only then, would heaven think to lop Such a cedar as the captain o' the Splendid's main-top: A belted sea-gentleman; a gallant, off-hand Mercutio indifferent in life's gay command. Magnanimous in humor; when the splintering shot fell, âTooth-picks a-plenty, lads; thank 'em with a shell!â Sang Larry o' the Cannakin, smuggler o' the wine, At mess between guns, lad in jovial recline: âIn Limbo our Jack he would chirrup up a cheer, The martinet there find a chaffing mutineer; From a thousand fathoms down under hatches o' your Hades, He'd ascend in love-ditty, kissing fingers to your ladies!â Never relishing the knave, though allowing for the menial, Nor overmuch the king, Jack, nor prodigally genial. Ashore on liberty he flashed in escapade, Vaulting over life in its levelness of grade, Like the dolphin off Africa in rainbow a-sweepingâ Arch iridescent shot from seas languid sleeping. Larking with thy life, if a joy but a toy, Heroic in thy levity wert thou, Jack Roy. THE HAGLETS By chapel bare, with walls sea-beat The lichened urns in wilds are lost About a carved memorial stone That shows, decayed and coral-mossed, A form recumbent, swords at feet, Trophies at head, and kelp for a winding-sheet. I invoke thy ghost, neglected fane, Washed by the waters' long lament; I adjure the recumbent effigy To tell the cenotaph's intentâ Reveal why fagotted swords are at feet, Why trophies appear and weeds are the winding-sheet. By open ports the Admiral sits, And shares repose with guns that tell Of power that smote the arm'd Plate Fleet Whose sinking flag-ship's colors fell; But over the Admiral floats in light His squadron's flag, the red-cross Flag of the White. The eddying waters whirl astern, The prow, a seedsman, sows the spray; With bellying sails and buckling spars The black hull leaves a Milky Way; Her timbers thrill, her batteries roll, She revelling speeds exulting with pennon at pole, But ah, for standards captive trailed For all their scutcheoned castles' prideâ Castilian towers that dominate Spain, Naples, and either Ind beside; Those haughty towers, armorial ones, Rue the salute from the Admiral's dens of guns. Ensigns and arms in trophy brave, Braver for many a rent and scar, The captor's naval hall bedeck, Spoil that insures an earldom's starâ Toledoes great, grand draperies too, Spain's steel and silk, and splendors from Peru. But crippled part in splintering fight, The vanquished flying the victor's flags, With prize-crews, under convoy-guns, Heavy the fleet from Opher dragsâ The Admiral crowding sail ahead, Foremost with news who foremost in conflict sped. But out from cloistral gallery dim, In early night his glance is thrown; He marks the vague reserve of heaven, He feels the touch of ocean lone; Then turns, in frame part undermined, Nor notes the shadowing wings that fan behind. There, peaked and gray, three haglets fly, And follow, follow fast in wake Where slides the cabin-lustre shy, And sharks from man a glamour take, Seething along the line of light In lane that endless rules the war-ship's flight. The sea-fowl here, whose hearts none know, They followed late the flag-ship quelled, (As now the victor one) and long Above her gurgling grave, shrill held With screams their wheeling ritesâthen sped Direct in silence where the victor led. Now winds less fleet, but fairer, blow, A ripple laps the coppered side, While phosphor sparks make ocean gleam, Like camps lit up in triumph wide; With lights and tinkling cymbals meet Acclaiming seas the advancing conqueror greet. But who a flattering tide may trust, Or favoring breeze, or aught in end?â Careening under startling blasts The sheeted towers of sails impend; While, gathering bale, behind is bred A livid storm-bow, like a rainbow dead. At trumpet-call the topmen spring; And, urged by after-call in stress, Yet other tribes of tars ascend The rigging's howling wilderness; But ere yard-ends alert they win, Hell rules in heaven with hurricane-fire and din. The spars, athwart at spiry height, Like quaking Lima's crosses rock; Like bees the clustering sailors cling Against the shrouds, or take the shock Flat on the swept yard-arms aslant, Dipped like the wheeling condor's pinions gaunt. A lull! and tongues of languid flame Lick every boom, and lambent show Electric 'gainst each face aloft; The herds of clouds with bellowings go: The black ship rearsâbesetâharassed, Then plunges far with luminous antlers vast. In trim betimes they turn from land, Some shivered sails and spars they stow; One watch, dismissed, they troll the can, While loud the billow thumps the bowâ Vies with the fist that smites the board, Obstreperous at each reveller's jovial words. Of royal oak by storms confirmed, The tested hull her lineage shows: Vainly the plungings whelm her prowâ She rallies, rears, she sturdier grows; Each shot-hole plugged, each storm-sail home, With batteries housed she rams the watery dome. Dim seem adrift through driving scud, The wan moon shows in plight forlorn; Then, pinched in visage, fades and fades Like to the faces drowned at morn, When deeps engulfed the flag-ship's crew, And, shrilling round, the inscrutable haglets flew. And still they fly, nor now they cry, But constant fan a second wake, Unflagging pionions ply and ply, Abreast their course intent they take; Their silence marks a stable mood, They patient keep their eager neighborhood. Plumed with a smoke, a confluent sea, Heaved in a combing pyramid full, Spent at its climax, in collapse Down headlong thundering stuns the hull: The trophy drops; but, reared again, Shows Mars' high-altar and contemns the main. Rebuilt it stands, the brag of arms, Transferred in siteâno thought of where The sensitive needle keeps its place, And starts, disturbed, a quiverer there; The helmsman rubs the clouded glassâ Peers in, but lets the trembling portent pass. Let pass as well his shipmates do (Whose dream of power no tremors jar) Fears for the fleet convoyed astern: âOur flag they fly, they share our star; Spain's galleons great in hull are stout: Manned by our menâlike us they'll ride it out.â Tonight's the night that ends the weekâ Ends day and week and month and year: A fourfold imminent flickering time, For now the midnight draws anear: Eight bells! and passing-bells they beâ The Old year fades, the Old year dies at sea. He launched them well. But shall the New Redeem the pledge the Old Year made, Or prove a self-asserting heir? But healthy hearts few qualms invade: By shot-chests grouped in bays 'tween guns The gossips chat, the grizzled, sea-beat ones. And boyish dreams some graybeards blab: âTo sea, my lads, we go no more Who share the Acapulco prize; We'll all night in, and bang the door; Our ingots red shall yield us bliss: Lads, golden years begin to-night with this!â Released from deck, yet waiting call, Glazed caps and coats baptized in storm, A watch of Laced Sleeves round the board Draw near in heart to keep them warm: âSweethearts and wives!â clink, clink, they meet, And, quaffing, dip in wine their beards of sleet. âAy, let the star-light stay withdrawn, So here her hearth-light memory fling, So in this wine-light cheer be born, And honor's fellowship weld our ringâ Honor! our Admiral's aim foretold: A tomb or a trophy, and lo, 't is a trophy and gold!â But he, a unit, sole in rank, Apart needs keep his lonely state, The sentry at his guarded door Mute as by vault the sculptured Fate; Belted he sits in drowsy light, And, hatted, nodsâthe Admiral of the White. He dozes, aged with watches passedâ Years, years of pacing to and fro; He dozes, nor attends the stir In bullioned standards rustling low, Nor minds the blades whose secret thrill Perverts overhead the magnet's Polar will;â Less heeds the shadowing three that ply And follow, follow fast in wake, Untiring wing and lidless eyeâ Abreast their course intent they take; Or sigh or sing, they hold for good The unvarying flight and fixed inveterate mood. In dream at last his dozings merge, In dream he reaps his victory's fruit: The Flags-o'-the-Blue, the Flags-o'-the-Red, Dipped flags of his country's fleets salute His Flag-o'-the-White in harbor proudâ But why should it blench? Why turn to a painted shroud? The hungry seas they hound the hull, The sharks they dog the haglets' flight; With one consent the winds, the waves In hunt with sins and wings unite, While drear the harps in cordage sound Remindful wails for old Armadas drowned. Haâyonder! are they Northern Lights? Or signals flashed to warn or ward? Yea, signals lanced in breakers high; But doom on warning follows hard: While yet they veer in hope to shun, They strike! and thumps of hull and heart are one. But beating hearts a drum-beat calls And prompt the men to quarters go; Discipline, curbing nature, rulesâ Heroic makes who duty know: They execute the trump's command, Or in peremptory places wait and stand. Yet cast about in blind amazeâ As through their watery shroud they peer: âWe tacked from land: then how betrayed? Have currents swerved usâsnared us here?â None heed the blades that clash in place Under lamps dashed down that lit the magnet's case. Ah, what may live, who mighty swim, Or boat-crew reach that shore forbid, Or cable span? Must victors drownâ Perish, even as the vanquished did? Man keeps from man the stifled moan; They shouldering stand, yet each in heart how lone. Some heaven invoke; but rings of reefs Prayer and despair alike deride In dance of breakers forked or peaked, Pale maniacs of the maddened tide; While, strenuous yet some end to earn, The haglets spin, though now no more astern. Like shuttles hurrying in the looms Aloft through rigging frayed they plyâ Cross and recrossâweave and inweave, Then lock the web with clinching cry Over the seas on seas that clasp The weltering wreck where gurgling ends the gasp. Ah for the Plate-Fleet trophy now, The victor's voucher, flags and arms; Never they'll hang in Abbey old And take Time's dust with holier palms; Nor less content, in liquid night, Their captor sleepsâthe Admiral of the White. Imbedded deep with shells And drifted treasure deep, Forever he sinks deeper in Unfathomable sleepâ His cannon round him thrown, His sailors at his feet, The wizard sea enchanting them Where never haglets beat. On nights when meteors play And light the breakers dance, The Oreads from the caves With silvery elves advance; And up from ocean stream, And down from heaven far, The rays that blend in dream The abysm and the star. THE AEOLIAN HARP AT THE SURF INN List the harp in window wailing Stirred by fitful gales from sea: Shrieking up in mad crescendoâ Dying down in plaintive key! Listen: less a strain ideal Than Ariel's rendering of the Real. What that Real is, let hint A picture stamped in memory's mint. Braced well up, with beams aslant, Betwixt the continents sails the Phocion, To Baltimore bound from Alicant. Blue breezy skies white fleeces fleck Over the chill blue white-capped ocean: From yard-arm comesââWreck ho, a wreck!â Dismasted and adrift, Long time a thing forsaken; Overwashed by every wave Like the slumbering kraken; Heedless if the billow roar, Oblivious of the lull, Leagues and leagues from shoal or shore, It swimsâa levelled hull: Bulwarks goneâa shaven wreck, Nameless, and a grass-green deck. A lumberman: perchance, in hold Prostrate pines with hemlocks rolled. It has drifted, waterlogged, Till by trailing weeds beclogged: Drifted, drifted, day by day, Pilotless on pathless way. It has drifted till each plank Is oozy as the oyster-bank: Drifted, drifted, night by night, Craft that never shows a light; Nor ever, to prevent worse knell, Tolls in fog the warning bell. From collision never shrinking, Drive what may through darksome smother; Saturate, but never sinking, Fatal only to the other! Deadlier than the sunken reef Since still the snare it shifteth, Torpid in dumb ambuscade Waylayingly it drifteth. O, the sailorsâO, the sails! O, the lost crews never heard of! Well the harp of Ariel wails Thoughts that tongue can tell no word of! MINOR SEA PIECES TO THE MASTER OF THE âMETEORâ Lonesome on earth's loneliest deep, Sailor! who dost thy vigil keepâ Off the Cape of Storms dost musing sweep Over monstrous waves that curl and comb; Of thee we think when here from brink We blow the mead in bubbling foam. Of thee we think, in a ring we link; To the shearer of ocean's fleece we drink, And the Meteor rolling home. FAR OFF-SHORE Look, the raft, a signal flying, Thinâa shred; None upon the lashed spars lying, Quick or dead. Cries the sea-fowl, hovering over, âCrew, the crew?â And the billow, reckless, rover, Sweeps anew! THE MAN-OF-WAR HAWK Yon black man-of-war-hawk that wheels in the light O'er the black ship's white sky-s'l, sunned cloud to the sight, Have we low-flyers wings to ascend to his height? No arrow can reach him; nor thought can attain To the placid supreme in the sweep of his reign. THE FIGURE-HEAD The Charles-and-Emma seaward sped, (Named from the carven pair at prow,) He so smart, and a curly head, She tricked forth as a bride knows how: Pretty stem for the port, I trow! But iron-rust and alum-spray And chafing gear, and sun and dew Vexed this lad and lassie gay, Tears in their eyes, salt tears nor few; And the hug relaxed with the failing glue. But came in end a dismal night, With creaking beams and ribs that groan, A black lee-shore and waters white: Dropped on the reef, the pair lie prone: O, the breakers dance, but the winds they moan! THE GOOD CRAFT âSNOW-BIRDâ Strenuous need that head-wind be From purposed voyage that drives at last The ship, sharp-braced and dogged still, Beating up against the blast. Brigs that figs for market gather, Homeward-bound upon the stretch, Encounter oft this uglier weather, Yet in end their port they fetch. Mark yon craft from sunny Smyrna Glazed with ice in Boston Bay; Out they toss the fig-drums cheerly, Livelier for the frosty ray. What if sleet off-shore assailed her, What though ice yet plate her yards; In wintry port not less she renders Summer's gift with warm regards! And, look, the underwriters' man, Timely, when the stevedore's done, Puts on his specs to pry and scan, And sets her downâA, No. 1. Bravo, master! Brava, brig! For slanting snows out of the West Never the Snow-Bird cares one fig; And foul winds steady her, though a pest. OLD COUNSEL OF THE YOUNG MASTER OF A WRECKED CALIFORNIA CLIPPER Come out of the Golden Gate, Go round the Horn with streamers, Carry royals early and late; But, brother, be not over-elateâ All hands save ship! has startled dreamers. THE TUFT OF KELP All dripping in tangles green, Cast up by a lonely sea If purer for that, O Weed, Bitterer, too, are ye? THE MALDIVE SHARK About the Shark, phlegmatical one, Pale sot of the Maldive sea, The sleek little pilot-fish, azure and slim, How alert in attendance be. From his saw-pit of mouth, from his charnel of maw They have nothing of harm to dread, But liquidly glide on his ghastly flank Or before his Gorgonian head; Or lurk in the port of serrated teeth In white triple tiers of glittering gates, And there find a haven when peril's abroad, An asylum in jaws of the Fates! They are friends; and friendly they guide him to prey, Yet never partake of the treatâ Eyes and brains to the dotard lethargic and dull, Pale ravener of horrible meat. TO NED Where is the world we roved, Ned Bunn? Hollows thereof lay rich in shade By voyagers old inviolate thrown Ere Paul Pry cruised with Pelf and Trade. To us old lads some thoughts come home Who roamed a world young lads no more shall roam. Nor less the satiate year impends When, wearying of routine-resorts, The pleasure-hunter shall break loose, Ned, for our Pantheistic ports:â Marquesas and glenned isles that be Authentic Edens in a Pagan sea. The charm of scenes untried shall lure, And, Ned, a legend urge the flightâ The Typee-truants under stars Unknown to Shakespere's Midsummer-Night; And man, if lost to Saturn's Age, Yet feeling life no Syrian pilgrimage. But, tell, shall he, the tourist, find Our isles the same in violet-glow Enamoring us what years and yearsâ Ah, Ned, what years and years ago! Well, Adam advances, smart in pace, But scarce by violets that advance you trace. But we, in anchor-watches calm, The Indian Psyche's languor won, And, musing, breathed primeval balm From Edens ere yet overrun; Marvelling mild if mortal twice, Here and hereafter, touch a Paradise. CROSSING THE TROPICS (FROM âThe Saya-y-Manto.â) While now the Pole Star sinks from sight The Southern Cross it climbs the sky; But losing thee, my love, my light, O bride but for one bridal night, The loss no rising joys supply. Love, love, the Trade Winds urge abaft, And thee, from thee, they steadfast waft. By day the blue and silver sea And chime of waters blandly fannedâ Nor these, nor Gama's stars to me May yield delight since still for thee I long as Gama longed for land. I yearn, I yearn, reverting turn, My heart it streams in wake astern. When, cut by slanting sleet, we swoop Where raves the world's inverted year, If roses all your porch shall loop, Not less your heart for me will droop Doubling the world's last outpost drear. O love, O love, these oceans vast: Love, love, it is as death were past! THE BERG (A DREAM) I saw a ship of martial build (Her standards set, her brave apparel on) Directed as by madness mere Against a stolid iceberg steer, Nor budge it, though the infatuate ship went down. The impact made huge ice-cubes fall Sullen, in tons that crashed the deck; But that one avalanche was allâ No other movement save the foundering wreck. Along the spurs of ridges pale, Not any slenderest shaft and frail, A prism over glass-green gorges lone, Toppled; or lace of traceries fine, Nor pendant drops in grot or mine Were jarred, when the stunned ship went down. Nor sole the gulls in cloud that wheeled Circling one snow-flanked peak afar, But nearer fowl the floes that skimmed And crystal beaches, felt no jar. No thrill transmitted stirred the lock Of jack-straw needle-ice at base; Towers undermined by wavesâthe block Atilt impendingâkept their place. Seals, dozing sleek on sliddery ledges Slipt never, when by loftier edges Through very inertia overthrown, The impetuous ship in bafflement went down. Hard Berg (methought), so cold, so vast, With mortal damps self-overcast; Exhaling still thy dankish breathâ Adrift dissolving, bound for death; Though lumpish thou, a lumbering oneâ A lumbering lubbard loitering slow, Impingers rue thee and go down, Sounding thy precipice below, Nor stir the slimy slug that sprawls Along thy dead indifference of walls. THE ENVIABLE ISLES (FROM âRammon.â) Through storms you reach them and from storms are free. Afar descried, the foremost drear in hue, But, nearer, green; and, on the marge, the sea Makes thunder low and mist of rainbowed dew. But, inland, where the sleep that folds the hills A dreamier sleep, the trance of God, instillsâ On uplands hazed, in wandering airs aswoon, Slow-swaying palms salute love's cypress tree Adown in vale where pebbly runlets croon A song to lull all sorrow and all glee. Sweet-fern and moss in many a glade are here, Where, strown in flocks, what cheek-flushed myriads lie Dimpling in dreamâunconscious slumberers mere, While billows endless round the beaches die. PEBBLES [I Though the Clerk of the Weather insist] Though the Clerk of the Weather insist, And lay down the weather-law, Pintado and gannet they wist That the winds blow whither they list In tempest or flaw. [II Old are the creeds, but stale the schools] Old are the creeds, but stale the schools, Revamped as the mode may veer, But Orm from the schools to the beaches strays, And, finding a Conch hoar with time, he delays And reverent lifts it to ear. That Voice, pitched in far monotone, Shall it swerve? shall it deviate ever? The Seas have inspired it, and Truthâ Truth, varying from sameness never. [III In hollows of the liquid hills] In hollows of the liquid hills Where the long Blue Ridges run, The flattery of no echo thrills, For echo the seas have none; Nor aught that gives man back man's strainâ The hope of his heart, the dream in his brain. [IV On ocean where the embattled fleets repair] On ocean where the embattled fleets repair, Man, suffering inflictor, sails on sufferance there. [V Implacable I, the old implacable Sea] Implacable I, the old implacable Sea: Implacable most when most I smile sereneâ Pleased, not appeased, by myriad wrecks in me. [VI Curled in the comb of yon billow Andean] Curled in the comb of yon billow Andean, Is it the Dragon's heaven-challenging crest? Elemental mad ramping of ravening watersâ Yet Christ on the Mount, and the dove in her nest! [VII Healed of my hurt, I laud the inhuman Sea] Healed of my hurt, I laud the inhuman Seaâ Yea, bless the Angels Four that there convene; For healed I am even by their pitiless breath Distilled in wholesome dew named rosmarine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TIMOLEON TIMOLEON (394 B.C.) I If more than once, as annals tell, Through blood without compunction spilt, An egotist arch rule has snatched And stamped the seizure with his sabre's hilt, And, legalized by lawyers, stood; Shall the good heart whose patriot fire Leaps to a deed of startling note, Do it, then flinch? Shall good in weak expire? Needs goodness lack the evil grit That stares down censorship and ban, And dumbfounds saintlier ones with thisâ God's will avouched in each successful man? Or, put it, where dread stress inspires A virtue beyond man's standard rate, Seems virtue there a strain forbidâ Transcendence such as shares transgression's fate? If so, and wan eclipse ensue, Yet glory await emergence won, Is that high Providence, or Chance? And proved it which with thee, Timoleon? O, crowned with laurel twined with thorn, Not rash thy life's cross-tide I stem, But reck the problem rolled in pang And reach and dare to touch thy garment's hem. II When Argos and Cleone strove Against free Corinth's claim or right, Two brothers battled for her well: A footman one, and one a mounted knight. Apart in place, each braved the brunt Till the rash cavalryman, alone, Was wrecked against the enemy's files, His bayard crippled and he maimed and thrown. Timoleon, at Timophanes' need, Makes for the rescue through the fray, Covers him with his shield, and takes The darts and furious odds and fights at bay; Till, wrought to palor of passion dumb, Stark terrors of death around he throws, Warding his brother from the field Spite failing friends dispersed and rallying foes. Here might he rest, in claim rest here, Rest, and a Phidian form remain; But life halts never, life must on, And take with term prolonged some scar or stain. Yes, life must on. And latent germs Time's seasons wake in mead and man; And brothers, playfellows in youth, Develop into variance wide in span. III Timophanes was his mother's prideâ Her pride, her pet, even all to her Who slackly on Timoleon looked: Scarce he (she mused) may proud affection stir. He saved my darling, gossips tell: If so, 'twas service, yea, and fair; But instinct ruled and duty bade, In service such, a henchman e'en might share. When boys they were I helped the bent; I made the junior feel his place, Subserve the senior, love him, too; And sooth he does, and that's his saving grace. But me the meek one never can serve, Not he, he lacks the quality keen To make the mother through the son An envied dame of power, a social queen. But thou, my first-born, thou art I In sex translated; joyed, I scan My features, mine, expressed in thee; Thou art what I would be were I a man. My brave Timophanes, 'tis thou Who yet the world's fore-front shalt win, For thine the urgent resolute way, Self pushing panoplied self through thick and thin. Nor here maternal insight erred: Foresworn, with heart that did not wince At slaying men who kept their vows, Her darling strides to power, and reignsâa Prince. IV Because of just heart and humane, Profound the hate Timoleon knew For crimes of pride and men-of-prey And impious deeds that perjurous upstarts do; And Corinth loved he, and in way Old Scotia's clansman loved his clan, Devotion one with ties how dear And passion that late to make the rescue ran. But crime and kinâthe terrorized town, The silent, acquiescent motherâ Revulsion racks the filial heart, The loyal son, the patriot true, the brother. In evil visions of the night He sees the lictors of the gods, Giant ministers of righteousness, Their fasces threatened by the Furies' rods. But undeterred he wills to act, Resolved thereon though Ate rise; He heeds the voice whose mandate calls, Or seems to call, peremptory from the skies. V Nor less but by approaches mild, And trying each prudential art, The just one first advances him In parley with a flushed intemperate heart. The brother first he seeksâalone, And pleads; but is with laughter met; Then comes he, in accord with two, And these adjure the tyrant and beset; Whose merriment gives place to rage: âGo,â stamping, âwhat to me is Right? I am the Wrong, and lo, I reign, And testily intolerant too in might:â And glooms on his mute brother pale, Who goes aside; with muffled face He sobs the predetermined word, And Right in Corinth reassumes its place. VI But on his robe, ah, whose the blood? And craven ones their eyes avert, And heavy is a mother's ban, And dismal faces of the fools can hurt. The whispering-gallery of the world, Where each breathed slur runs wheeling wide Eddies a false perverted truth, Inveterate turning still on fratricide. The time was Plato's. Wandering lights Confirmed the atheist's standing star; As now, no sanction Virtue knew For deeds that on prescriptive morals jar. Reaction took misgiving's tone, Infecting conscience, till betrayed To doubt the irrevocable doom Herself had authorized when undismayed. Within perturbed Timoleon here Such deeps were bared as when the sea Convulsed, vacates its shoreward bed, And Nature's last reserves show nakedly. He falters, and from Hades' glens By night insidious tones imploreâ Why suffer? hither come and be What Phocion is who feeleth man no more. But, won from that, his mood elects To liveâto live in wilding place; For years self-outcast, he but meets In shades his playfellow's reproachful face. Estranged through one transcendent deed From common membership in mart, In severance he is like a head Pale after battle trunkless found apart. VII But flood-tide comes though long the ebb, Nor patience bides with passion long; Like sightless orbs his thoughts are rolled Arraigning heaven as compromised in wrong: To second causes why appeal? Vain parleying here with fellow clods. To you, Arch Principals, I rear My quarrel, for this quarrel is with gods. Shall just men long to quit your world? It is aspersion of your reign; Your marbles in the temple standâ Yourselves as stony and invoked in vain? Ah, bear with one quite overborne, Olympians, if he chide ye now; Magnanimous be even though he rail And hard against ye set the bleaching brow. If conscience doubt, she'll next recant. What basis then? O, tell at last, Are earnest natures staggering here But fatherless shadows from no substance cast? Yea, are ye, gods? Then ye, 'tis ye Should show what touch of tie ye may, Since ye, too, if not wrung are wronged By grievous misconceptions of your sway. But deign, some little sign be givenâ Low thunder in your tranquil skies; Me reassure, nor let me be Like a lone dog that for a master cries. VIII Men's moods, as frames, must yield to years, And turns the world in fickle ways; Corinth recalls Timoleonâay, And plumes him forth, but yet with schooling phrase. On Sicily's fields, through arduous wars, A peace he won whose rainbow spanned The isle redeemed; and he was hailed Deliverer of that fair colonial land. And Corinth clapt: Absolved, and more! Justice in long arrears is thine: Not slayer of thy brother, no, But savior of the state, Jove's soldier, man divine. Eager for thee thy City waits: Return! with bays we dress your door. But he, the Isle's loved guest, reposed, And never for Corinth left the adopted shore. AFTER THE PLEASURE PARTY LINES TRACED UNDER AN IMAGE OF AMOR THREATENING Fear me, virgin whosoever Taking pride from love exempt, Fear me, slighted. Never, never Brave me, nor my fury tempt: Downy wings, but wroth they beat Tempest even in reason's seat. Behind the house the upland falls With many an odorous treeâ White marbles gleaming through green halls, Terrace by terrace, down and down, And meets the starlit Mediterranean Sea. 'Tis Paradise. In such an hour Some pangs that rend might take release. Nor less perturbed who keeps this bower Of balm, nor finds balsamic peace? From whom the passionate words in vent After long revery's discontent? Tired of the homeless deep, Look how their flight yon hurrying billows urge, Hitherward but to reap Passive repulse from the iron-bound verge! Insensate, can they never know 'Tis mad to wreck the impulsion so? An art of memory is, they tell: But to forget! forget the glade Wherein Fate sprung Love's ambuscade, To flout pale years of cloistral life And flush me in this sensuous strife. 'Tis Vesta struck with Sappho's smart. No fable her delirious leap: With more of cause in desperate heart, Myself could take itâbut to sleep! Now first I feel, what all may ween, That soon or late, if faded e'en, One's sex asserts itself. Desire, The dear desire through love to sway, Is like the Geysers that aspireâ Through cold obstruction win their fervid way. But baffled hereâto take disdain, To feel rule's instinct, yet not reign; To dote, to come to this drear shameâ Hence the winged blaze that sweeps my soul Like prairie fires that spurn control, Where withering weeds incense the flame. And kept I long heaven's watch for this, Contemning love, for this, even this? O terrace chill in Northern air, O reaching ranging tube I placed Against yon skies, and fable chased Till, fool, I hailed for sister there Starred Cassiopea in Golden Chair. In dream I throned me, nor I saw In cell the idiot crowned with straw. And yet, ah yet scarce ill I reigned, Through self-illusion self-sustained, When nowâenlightened, undeceivedâ What gain I barrenly bereaved! Than this can be yet lower declineâ Envy and spleen, can these be mine? The peasant girl demure that trod Beside our wheels that climbed the way, And bore along a blossoming rod That looked the sceptre of May-dayâ On herâto fire this petty hell, His softened glance how moistly fell! The cheat! on briars her buds were strung; And wiles peeped forth from mien how meek. The innocent bare-foot! young, so young! To girls, strong man's a novice weak. To tell such beads! And more remain, Sad rosary of belittling pain. When after lunch and sallies gay, Like the Decameron folk we lay In sylvan groups; and Iâlet be! O, dreams he, can he dream that one Because not roseate feels no sun? The plain lone bramble thrills with Spring As much as vines that grapes shall bring. Me now fair studies charm no more. Shall great thoughts writ, or high themes sung Damask wan cheeksâunlock his arm About some radiant ninny flung? How glad with all my starry lore, I'd buy the veriest wanton's rose Would but my bee therein repose. Could I remake me! or set free This sexless bound in sex, then plunge Deeper than Sappho, in a lunge Piercing Pan's paramount mystery! For, Nature, in no shallow surge Against thee either sex may urge, Why hast thou made us but in halvesâ Co-relatives? This makes us slaves. If these co-relatives never meet Self-hood itself seems incomplete. And such the dicing of blind fate Few matching halves here meet and mate. What Cosmic jest or Anarch blunder The human integral clove asunder And shied the fractions through life's gate? Ye stars that long your votary knew Rapt in her vigil, see me here! Whither is gone the spell ye threw When rose before me Cassiopea? Usurped on by love's stronger reignâ But lo, your very selves do wane: Light breaksâtruth breaks! Silvered no more, But chilled by dawn that brings the gale Shivers yon bramble above the vale, And disillusion opens all the shore. One knows not if Urania yet The pleasure-party may forget; Or whether she lived down the strain Of turbulent heart and rebel brain; For Amor so resents a slight, And her's had been such haught disdain, He long may wreak his boyish spite, And boy-like, little reck the pain. One knows not, no. But late in Rome (For queens discrowned a congruous home) Entering Albani's porch she stood Fixed by an antique pagan stone Colossal carved. No anchorite seer, Not Thomas a Kempis, monk austere, Religious more are in their tone; Yet far, how far from Christian heart That form august of heathen Art. Swayed by its influence, long she stood, Till surged emotion seething down, She rallied and this mood she won: Languid in frame for me, To-day by Mary's convent shrine, Touched by her picture's moving plea In that poor nerveless hour of mine, I musedâA wanderer still must grieve. Half I resolved to kneel and believe, Believe and submit, the veil take on. But thee, armed Virgin! less benign, Thee now I invoke, thou mightier one. Helmeted womanâif such term Befit thee, far from strife Of that which makes the sexual feud And clogs the aspirant lifeâ O self-reliant, strong and free, Thou in whom power and peace unite, Transcender! raise me up to thee, Raise me and arm me! Fond appeal. For never passion peace shall bring, Nor Art inanimate for long Inspire. Nothing may help or heal While Amor incensed remembers wrong. Vindictive, not himself he'll spare; For scope to give his vengeance play Himself he'll blaspheme and betray. Then for Urania, virgins everywhere, O pray! Example take too, and have care. THE NIGHT-MARCH With banners furled, and clarions mute, An army passes in the night; And beaming spears and helms salute The dark with bright. In silence deep the legions stream, With open ranks, in order true; Over boundless plains they stream and gleamâ No chief in view! Afar, in twinkling distance lost, (So legends tell) he lonely wends And back through all that shining host His mandate sends. THE RAVAGED VILLA In shards the sylvan vases lie, Their links of dance undone, And brambles wither by thy brim, Choked fountain of the sun! The spider in the laurel spins, The weed exiles the flower: And, flung to kiln, Apollo's bust Makes lime for Mammon's tower. THE MARGRAVE'S BIRTHNIGHT Up from many a sheeted valley, From white woods as well, Down too from each fleecy upland Jingles many a bell Jovial on the work-sad horses Hitched to runners old Of the toil-worn peasants sledging Under sheepskins in the cold; Till from every quarter gathered Meet they on one ledge, There from hoods they brush the snow off Lighting from each sledge Full before the Margrave's castle, Summoned there to cheer On his birth-night, in mid-winter, Kept year after year. O the hall, and O the holly! Tables line each wall; Guests as holly-berries plenty, Butâno host withal! May his people feast contented While at head of board Empty throne and vacant cover Speak the absent lord? Minstrels enter. And the stewards Serve the guests; and when, Passing there the vacant cover, Functionally then Old observance grave they offer; But no Margrave fair, In his living aspect gracious, Sits responsive there; No, and never guest once marvels, None the good lord name, Scarce they mark void throne and coverâ Dust upon the same. Mindless as to what importeth Absence such in hall; Tacit as the plough-horse feeding In the palfrey's stall. Ah, enough for toil and travail, If but for a night Into wine is turned the water, Black bread into white. MAGIAN WINE Amulets gemmed, to Miriam dear, Adown in liquid mirage gleam; Solomon's Syrian charms appear, Opal and ring supreme. The rays that light this Magian Wine Thrill up from semblances divine. And, seething through the rapturous wave, What low Elysian anthems rise: Sibylline inklings blending rave, Then lap the verge with sighs. Delirious here the oracles swim Ambiguous in the beading hymn. THE GARDEN OF METRODORUS The Athenians mark the moss-grown gate And hedge untrimmed that hides the haven green: And who keeps here his quiet state? And shares he sad or happy fate Where never foot-path to the gate is seen? Here none come forth, here none go in, Here silence strange, and dumb seclusion dwell: Content from loneness who may win? And is this stillness peace or sin Which noteless thus apart can keep its dell? THE NEW ZEALOT TO THE SUN Persian, you rise Aflame from climes of sacrifice Where adulators sue, And prostrate man, with brow abased, Adheres to rites whose tenor traced All worship hitherto. Arch type of sway, Meetly your over-ruling ray You fling from Asia's plain, Whence flashed the javelins abroad Of many a wild incursive horde Led by some shepherd Cain. Mid terrors dinned Gods too came conquerors from your Ind, The brood of Bramha throve; They came like to the scythed car, Westward they rolled their empire far, Of night their purple wove. Chemist, you breed In orient climes each sorcerous weed That energizes dreamâ Transmitted, spread in myths and creeds, Houris and hells, delirious screeds And Calvin's last extreme. What though your light In time's first dawn compelled the flight Of Chaos' startled clan, Shall never all your darted spears Disperse worse Anarchs, frauds and fears, Sprung from these weeds to man? But Science yet An effluence ampler shall beget, And power beyond your playâ Shall quell the shades you fail to rout, Yea, searching every secret out Elucidate your ray. THE WEAVER For years within a mud-built room For Arva's shrine he weaves the shawl, Lone wight, and at a lonely loom, His busy shadow on the wall. The face is pinched, the form is bent, No pastime knows he nor the wine, Recluse he lives and abstinent Who weaves for Arva's shrine. LAMIA'S SONG Descend, descend! Pleasant the downward wayâ From your lonely Alp With the wintry scalp To our myrtles in valleys of May. Wend then, wend: Mountaineer, descend! And more than a wreath shall repay. Come, ah come! With the cataracts come, That hymn as they roam How pleasant the downward way! IN A GARRET Gems and jewels let them heapâ Wax sumptuous as the Sophi: For me, to grapple from Art's deep One dripping trophy! MONODY To have known him, to have loved him After loneness long; And then to be estranged in life, And neither in the wrong; And now for death to set his sealâ Ease me, a little ease, my song! By wintry hills his hermit-mound The sheeted snow-drifts drape, And houseless there the snow-bird flits Beneath the fir-trees' crape: Glazed now with ice the cloistral vine That hid the shyest grape. LONE FOUNTS Though fast youth's glorious fable flies, View not the world with worldling's eyes; Nor turn with weather of the time. Foreclose the coming of surprise: Stand where Posterity shall stand; Stand where the Ancients stood before, And, dipping in lone founts thy hand, Drink of the never-varying lore: Wise once, and wise thence evermore. THE BENCH OF BOORS In bed I muse on Tenier's boors, Embrowned and beery losels all: A wakeful brain Elaborates pain: Within low doors the slugs of boors Laze and yawn and doze again. In dreams they doze, the drowsy boors, Their hazy hovel warm and small: Thought's ampler bound But chill is found: Within low doors the basking boors Snugly hug the ember-mound. Sleepless, I see the slumberous boors Their blurred eyes blink, their eyelids fall: Thought's eager sight Achesâoverbright! Within low doors the boozy boors Cat-naps take in pipe-bowl light. THE ENTHUSIAST âTHOUGH HE SLAY ME YET WILL I TRUST IN HIM.â Shall hearts that beat no base retreat In youth's magnanimous yearsâ Ignoble hold it, if discreet When interest tames to fears; Shall spirits that worship light Perfidious deem its sacred glow, Recant, and trudge where worldlings go, Conform and own them right? Shall Time with creeping influence cold Unnerve and cow? the heart Pine for the heartless ones enrolled With palterers of the mart? Shall faith abjure her skies, Or pale probation blench her down To shrink from Truth so still, so lone Mid loud gregarious lies? Each burning boat in Caesar's rear, FlamesâNo return through me! So put the torch to ties though dear, If ties but tempters be. Nor cringe if come the night: Walk through the cloud to meet the pall, Though light forsake thee, never fall From fealty to light. ART In placid hours well-pleased we dream Of many a brave unbodied scheme. But form to lend, pulsed life create, What unlike things must meet and mate: A flame to meltâa wind to freeze; Sad patienceâjoyous energies; Humilityâyet pride and scorn; Instinct and study; love and hate; Audacityâreverence. These must mate, And fuse with Jacob's mystic heart, To wrestle with the angelâArt. BUDDHA âFOR WHAT IS YOUR LIFE? IT IS EVEN A VAPOR THAT APPEARETH FOR A LITTLE TIME AND THEN VANISHETH AWAY.â Swooning swim to less and less, Aspirant to nothingness! Sobs of the worlds, and dole of kinds That dumb endurers beâ Nirvana! absorb us in your skies, Annul us into thee. C?'S LAMENT How lovely was the light of heaven, What angels leaned from out the sky In years when youth was more than wine And man and nature seemed divine Ere yet I felt that youth must die. Ere yet I felt that youth must die How insubstantial looked the earth, Alladin-land! in each advance, Or here or there, a new romance; I never dreamed would come a dearth. And nothing then but had its worth, Even pain. Yes, pleasure still and pain In quick reaction made of life A lovers' quarrel, happy strife In youth that never comes again. But will youth never come again? Even to his grave-bed has he gone, And left me lone to wake by night With heavy heart that erst was light? O, lay it at his headâa stone! SHELLEY'S VISION Wandering late by morning seas When my heart with pain was lowâ Hate the censor pelted meâ Deject I saw my shadow go. In elf-caprice of bitter tone I too would pelt the pelted one: At my shadow I cast a stone. When lo, upon that sun-lit ground I saw the quivering phantom take The likeness of St. Stephen crowned: Then did self-reverence awake. FRAGMENTS OF A LOST GNOSTIC POEM OF THE 12th CENTURY Found a family, build a state, The pledged event is still the same: Matter in end will never abate His ancient brutal claim. Indolence is heaven's ally here, And energy the child of hell: The Good Man pouring from his pitcher clear, But brims the poisoned well. THE MARCHIONESS OF BRINVILLIERS He toned the sprightly beam of morning With twilight meek of tender eve, Brightness interfused with softness, Light and shade did weave: And gave to candor equal place With mystery starred in open skies; And, floating all in sweetness, made Her fathomless mild eyes. THE AGE OF THE ANTONINES While faith forecasts millennial years Spite Europe's embattled lines, Back to the Past one glance be castâ The Age of the Antonines! O summit of fate, O zenith of time When a pagan gentleman reigned, And the olive was nailed to the inn of the world Nor the peace of the just was feigned. A halcyon Age, afar it shines, Solstice of Man and the Antonines. Hymns to the nations' friendly gods Went up from the fellowly shrines, No demagogue beat the pulpit-drum In the Age of the Antonines! The sting was not dreamed to be taken from death, No Paradise pledged or sought, But they reasoned of fate at the flowing feast, Nor stifled the fluent thought. We sham, we shuffle while faith declinesâ They were frank in the Age of the Antonines. Orders and ranks they kept degree, Few felt how the parvenu pines, No law-maker took the lawless one's fee In the Age of the Antonines! Under law made will the world reposed And the ruler's right confessed, For the heavens elected the Emperor then, The foremost of men the best. Ah, might we read in America's signs The Age restored of the Antonines. HERBA SANTA I After long wars when comes release Not olive wands proclaiming peace An import dearer share Than stems of Herba Santa hazed In autumn's Indian air. Of moods they breathe that care disarm, They pledge us lenitive and calm. II Shall code or creed a lure afford To win all selves to Love's accord? When Love ordained a supper divine For the wide world of man, What bickerings o'er his gracious wine! Then strange new feuds began. Effectual more in lowlier way, Pacific Herb, thy sensuous plea The bristling clans of Adam sway At least to fellowship in thee! Before thine altar tribal flags are furled, Fain woulds't thou make one hearthstone of the world. III To scythe, to sceptre, pen and hodâ Yea, sodden laborers dumb; To brains overplied, to feet that plod, In solace of the Truce of God The Calumet has come! IV Ah for the world ere Raleigh's find Never that knew this suasive balm That helps when Gilead's fails to heal, Helps by an interserted charm. Insinuous thou that through the nerve Windest the soul, and so canst win Some from repinings, some from sin, The Church's aim thou dost subserve. The ruffled fag fordone with care And brooding, Gold would ease this pain: Him soothest thou and smoothest down Till some content return again. Even ruffians feel thy influence breed Saint Martin's summer in the mind, They feel this last evangel plead, As did the first, apart from creed, Be peaceful, manâbe kind! V Rejected once on higher plain, O Love supreme, to come again Can this be thine? Again to come, and win us too In likeness of a weed That as a god didst vainly woo, As man more vainly bleed? VI Forbear, my soul! and in thine Eastern chamber Rehearse the dream that brings the long release: Through jasmine sweet and talismanic amber Inhaling Herba Santa in the passive Pipe of Peace. FRUIT OF TRAVEL LONG AGO VENICE With Pantheist energy of will The little craftsman of the Coral Sea Strenuous in the blue abyss, Up-builds his marvelous gallery And long arcade, Erections freaked with many a fringe Of marble garlandry, Evincing what a worm can do. Laborious in a shallower wave, Advanced in kindred art, A prouder agent proved Pan's might When Venice rose in reefs of palaces. IN A BYE-CANAL A swoon of noon, a trance of tide, The hushed siesta brooding wide Like calms far off Peru; No floating wayfarer in sight, Dumb noon, and haunted like the night When Jael the wiled one slew. A languid impulse from the oar Plied by my indolent gondolier Tinkles against a palace hoar, And, hark, response I hear! A lattice clicks; and lo, I see Between the slats, mute summoning me, What loveliest eyes of scintillation, What basilisk glance of conjuration! Fronted I have, part taken the span Of portents in nature and peril in man. I have swumâI have been Twixt the whale's black flukes and the white shark's fin; The enemy's desert have wandered in, And there have turned, have turned and scanned, Following me how noiselessly, Envy and Slander, lepers hand in hand. All this. But at the latticed eyeâ âHey! Gondolier, you sleep, my man; Wake up!â And, shooting by, we ran; The while I mused, This, surely now, Confutes the Naturalists, allow! Sirens, true sirens verily be, Sirens, waylayers in the sea. Well, wooed by these same deadly misses, Is it shame to run? No! flee them did divine Ulysses, Brave, wise, and Venus' son. PISA'S LEANING TOWER The Tower in tiers of architraves, Fair circle over cirque, A trunk of rounded colonades, The maker's master-work, Impends with all its pillared tribes, And, poising them, debates: It thinks to plungeâbut hesitates; Shrinks backâyet fain would slide; Withholds itselfâitself would urge; Hovering, shivering on the verge, A would-be suicide! IN A CHURCH OF PADUA In vaulted place where shadows flit, An upright sombre box you see: A door, but fast, and lattice none, But punctured holes minutely small In lateral silver panel square Above a kneeling-board without, Suggest an aim if not declare. Who bendeth here the tremulous knee No glimpse may get of him within, And he immured may hardly see The soul confessing there the sin; Nor yields the low-sieved voice a tone Whereby the murmurer may be known. Dread diving-bell! In thee inurned What hollows the priest must sound, Descending into consciences Where more is hid than found. MILAN CATHEDRAL Through light green haze, a rolling sea Over gardens where redundance flows, The fat old plain of Lombardy, The White Cathedral shows. Of Art the miracles Its tribes of pinnacles Gleam like to ice-peaks snowed; and higher, Erect upon each airy spire In concourse without end, Statues of saints over saints ascend Like multitudinous forks of fire. What motive was the master-builder's here? Why these synodic hierarchies given, Sublimely ranked in marble sessions clear, Except to signify the host of heaven. PAUSILIPPO (IN THE TIME OF BOMBA) A hill there is that laves its feet In Naples' bay and lifts its head In jovial season, curled with vines. Its name, in pristine years conferred By settling Greeks, imports that none Who take the prospect thence can pine, For such the charm of beauty shown Even sorrow's self they cheerful weened Surcease might find and thank good Pan. Toward that hill my landeau drew; And there, hard by the verge, was seen Two faces with such meaning fraught One scarce could mark and straight pass on. A man it was less hoar with time Than bleached through strange immurement long, Retaining still, by doom depressed, Dim trace of some aspiring prime. Seated he tuned a homely harp Watched by a girl, whose filial mien Toward one almost a child again, Took on a staid maternal tone. Nor might one question that the locks Which in smoothed natural silvery curls Fell on the bowed one's thread-bare coat Betrayed her ministering hand. Anon, among some ramblers drawn, A murmur rose âTis Silvio, Silvio!â With inklings more in tone suppressed Touching his story, part recalled: Clandestine arrest abrupt by night; The sole conjecturable cause The yearning in a patriot ode Construed as treason; trial none; Prolonged captivity profound; Vain liberation late. All this, With pity for impoverishment And blight forestalling age's wane. Hillward the quelled enthusiast turned, Unmanned, made meek through strenuous wrong, Preluding, faltering; then began, But only thrilled the wireâno more, The constant maid supplying voice, Hinting by no ineloquent sign That she was but his mouth-piece mere, Himself too spiritless and spent. Pausilippo, Pausilippo, Pledging easement unto pain, Shall your beauty even solace If one's sense of beauty wane? Could light airs that round ye play Waft heart-heaviness away Or memory lull to sleep, Then, then indeed your balm Might Silvio becharm, And life in fount would leap, Pausilippo! Did not your spell invite, In moods that slip between, A dream of years serene, And wake, to dash, delightâ Evoking here in vision Fulfilment and fruitionâ Nor mine, nor meant for man! Did hope not frequent share The mirage when despair Overtakes the caravan, Me then your scene might move To break from sorrow's snare, And apt your name would prove, Pausilippo! But I've looked upon your revelâ It unravels not the pain: Pausilippo, Pausilippo, Named benignly if in vain! It ceased. In low and languid tone The tideless ripple lapped the passive shore; As listlessly the bland untroubled heaven Looked down as silver doled was silent given In pityâfutile as the ore! THE ATTIC LANDSCAPE Tourist, spare the avid glance That greedy roves the sight to see: Little here of âOld Romance,â Or Picturesque of Tivoli. No flushful tint the sense to warmâ Pure outline pale, a linear charm. The clear-cut hills carved temples face, Respond, and share their sculptural grace. 'Tis Art and Nature lodged together, Sister by sister, cheek to cheek; Such Art, such Nature, and such weather The All-in-All seems here a Greek. THE SAME A circumambient spell it is, Pellucid on these scenes that waits, Repose that does of Plato tellâ Charm that his style authenticates. THE PARTHENON I SEEN ALOFT FROM AFAR Estranged in site, Aerial gleaming, warmly white, You look a suncloud motionless In noon of day divine; Your beauty charmed enhancement takes In Art's long after-shine. II NEARER VIEWED Like Lais, fairest of her kind, In subtlety your form's definedâ The cornice curved, each shaft inclined, While yet, to eyes that do but revel And take the sweeping view, Erect this seems, and that a level, To line and plummet true. Spinoza gazes; and in mind Dreams that one architect designed Laisâand you! III THE FRIEZE What happy musings genial went With airiest touch the chisel lent To frisk and curvet light Of horses gayâtheir riders graveâ Contrasting so in action brave With virgins meekly bright, Clear filing on in even tone With pitcher each, one after one Like water-fowl in flight. IV THE LAST TILE When the last marble tile was laid The winds died down on all the seas; Hushed were the birds, and swooned the glade; Ictinus sat; Aspasia said âHist!âArt's meridian, Pericles!â GREEK MASONRY Joints were none that mortar sealed: Together, scarce with line revealed, The blocks in symmetry congealed. GREEK ARCHITECTURE Not magnitude, not lavishness, But Formâthe Site; Not innovating wilfulness, But reverence for the Archetype. OFF CAPE COLONNA Aloof they crown the foreland lone, From aloft they loftier riseâ Fair columns, in the aureola rolled From sunned Greek seas and skies. They wax, sublimed to fancy's view, A god-like group against the blue. Over much like gods! Serene they saw The wolf-waves board the deck, And headlong hull of Falconer, And many a deadlier wreck. THE ARCHIPELAGO Sail before the morning breeze The Sporads through and Cyclades They look like isles of absenteesâ Gone whither? You bless Apollo's cheering ray, But Delos, his own isle, today Not e'en a Selkirk there to pray God friend me! Scarce lone these groups, scarce lone and bare When Theseus roved a Raleigh there, Each isle a small Virginia fairâ Unravished. Nor less through havoc fell they rue, They still retain in outline true Their grace of form when earth was new And primal. But beauty clear, the frame's as yet, Never shall make one quite forget Thy picture, Pan, therein once setâ Life's revel! 'Tis Polynesia reft of palms, Seaward no valley breathes her balmsâ Not such as musk thy rings of calms, Marquesas! SYRA (A TRANSMITTED REMINISCENCE.) Fleeing from Scio's smouldering vines (Where when the sword its work had done The Turk applied the torch) the Greek Came here, a fugitive stript of goods, Here to an all but tenantless isle, Nor here in footing gained at first, Felt safe. Still from the turbaned foe Dreading the doom of shipwrecked men Whom feline seas permit to land Then pounce upon and drag them back, For height they made, and prudent won A cone-shaped fastness on whose flanks With pains they pitched their eyrie camp, Stone huts, whereto they wary clung; But, reassured in end, come downâ Multiplied through compatriots now, Refugees like themselves forlornâ And building along the water's verge Begin to thrive; and thriving more When Greece at last flung off the Turk, Make of the haven mere a mart. I saw it in its earlier dayâ Primitive, such an isled resort As hearthless Homer might have known Wandering about the Ãgean here. Sheds ribbed with wreck-stuff faced the sea Where goods in transit shelter found; And here and there a shanty-shop Where Fez-caps, swords, tobacco, shawls Pistols, and orient finery, Eve'sâ (The spangles dimmed by hands profane) Like plunder on a pirate's deck Lay orderless in such loose way As to suggest things ravished or gone astray. Above a tented inn with fluttering flag A sunburnt board announced Greek wine In self-same text Anacreon knew, Dispensed by one named âPericles.â Got up as for the opera's scene, Armed strangers, various, lounged or lazed, Lithe fellows tall, with gold-shot eyes. Sunning themselves as leopards may. Off-shore lay xebecs trim and light, And some but dubious in repute. But on the strand, for docks were none, What busy bees! no testy fry; Frolickers, picturesquely odd, With bales and oil-jars lading boats, Lighters that served an anchored craft, Each in his tasseled Phrygian cap, Blue Eastern drawers and braided vest; And some with features cleanly cut As Proserpine's upon the coin. Such chatterers all! like children gay Who make believe to work, but play. I saw, and how help musing too. Here traffic's immature as yet: Forever this juvenile fun hold out And these light hearts? Their garb, their glee, Alike profuse in flowing measure, Alike inapt for serious work, Blab of grandfather Saturn's prime When trade was not, nor toil, nor stress, But life was leisure, merriment, peace, And lucre none and love was righteousness. DISINTERMENT OF THE HERMES What forms divine in adamant fairâ Carven demigod and god, And hero-marbles rivalling these, Bide under Latium's sod, Or lost in sediment and drift Alluvial which the Grecian rivers sift. To dig for these, O better far Than raking arid sands For gold more barren meetly theirs Sterile, with brimming hands. THE APPARITION (THE PARTHENON UPLIFTED ON ITS ROCK FIRST CHALLENGING THE VIEW ON THE APPROACH TO ATHENS) Abrupt the supernatural Cross, Vivid in startled air, Smote the Emperor Constantine And turned his soul's allegiance there. With other power appealing down, Trophy of Adam's best! If cynic minds you scarce convert, You try them, shake them, or molest. Diogenes, that honest heart, Lived ere your date began; Thee had he seen, he might have swerved In mood nor barked so much at Man. IN THE DESERT Never Pharoah's Night, Whereof the Hebrew wizards croon, Did so the Theban flamens try As me this veritable Noon. Like blank ocean in blue calm Undulates the ethereal frame; In one flowing oriflamme God flings his fiery standard out. Battling with the Emirs fierce Napoleon a great victory won, Through and through his sword did pierce; But, bayonetted by this sun His gunners drop beneath the gun. Holy, holy, holy Light! Immaterial incandescence, Of God the effluence of the essence, Shekinah intolerably bright! THE GREAT PYRAMID Your masonryâand is it man's? More like some Cosmic artisan's. Your courses as in strata rise, Beget you do a blind surmise Like Grampians. Far slanting up your sweeping flank Arabs with Alpine goats may rank, And there they find a choice of passes Even like to dwarfs that climb the masses Of glaciers blank. Shall lichen in your crevice fit? Nay, sterile all and granite-knit: Weather nor weather-strain ye rue, But aridly you cleave the blue As lording it. Morn's vapor floats beneath your peak, Kites skim your side with pinion weak; To sand-storms battering, blow on blow, Raging to work your overthrow, Youâturn the cheek. All elements unmoved you stem, Foursquare you stand and suffer them: Time's future infinite you dare, While, for the past, 'tis you that wear Eld's diadem. Slant from your inmost lead the caves And labyrinths rumored. These who braves And penetrates (old palmers said) Comes out afar on deserts dead And, dying, raves. Craftsmen, in dateless quarries dim, Stones formless into form did trim, Usurped on Nature's self with Art, And bade this dumb I AM to start, Imposing him. L'ENVOI THE RETURN OF THE SIRE DE NESLE. A.D. 16? My towers at last! These rovings end, Their thirst is slaked in larger dearth: The yearning infinite recoils, For terrible is earth. Kaf thrusts his snouted crags through fog: Araxes swells beyond his span, And knowledge poured by pilgrimage Overflows the banks of man. But thou, my stay, thy lasting love One lonely good, let this but be! Weary to view the wide world's swarm, But blest to fold but thee.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">WEEDS AND WILDINGS WITH A ROSE OR TWO PART I THE YEAR THE LOITERER 1 She will come tho' she loiter, believe, Her pledge it assigns not the day; Why brood by the embers night after night, Sighing over their dying awayâ Well, let her delay; She is everywhere longed for as here; A favorite, freakish and young: Her can we gladden, then us she can cheer? Let us think no wrong. 2 But watch and wait: Wait by the pasture-bars Or watch by the garden-gate; For, after coming, tho' wide she stray, First ever she shows on the slender wayâ Slim sheep-track threads the hill-side brown, Or foot-path leads to the garden down. 3 While snow lingered under the fir, Loth to melt from embrace of the earth, And ashy red embers of logs In moonlight dozed on the hearth; And in cage by the window sun-warmed Our bird was enheartened to song; It was then that, as yearly before, By the self-same foot-path along, She drew to the weather-beat door That was sunned thro' the skeleton-tree: Nothing she said, but seemed to sayâ âOld folks, aren't ye glad to see me!â And tears brimmed our eyesâbless the day! Then she turned; revisited in sortâ She was hereâshe was there, Peeping eager everywhere, Like one who revisits scenes never forgot. WHEN FORTH THE SHEPHERD LEADS THE FLOCK When forth the shepherd leads the flock, White lamb and dingy ewe, And there's dibbling in the garden, Then the world begins anew. When Buttercups make bright The meadows up and down, The Golden Age returns to fields If never to the town. When stir the freshening airs Forerunning showers to meads, And Dandelions prance, Then Heart-Free shares the danceâ A Wilding with the Weeds! But alack and alas For things of wilding feature! Since hearsed was Pan Ill befalls each profitless creatureâ Profitless to man! Buttercup and Dandelion, Wildings, and the rest, Commoners and holiday-makers, Note them in one test: The farmers scout them, Yea, and would rout them, Hay is better without themâ Tares in the grass! The florists pooh-pooh them; Few but children do woo them, Love them, reprieve them, Retrieve and inweave them, Never sighingâAlas! THE LITTLE GOOD FELLOWS Make way, make way, give leave to rove Under your orchard as above; A yearly welcome if ye love! And all who loved us alway throve. Love for love. For ever we When some unfriended man we see Lifeless under forest-eaves, Cover him with buds and leaves; And charge the chipmunk, mouse, and moleâ Molest not this poor human soul! Then let us never on green floor Where your paths wind round about, Keep to the middle in misdoubt, Shy and aloof, unsure of ye; But come like grass to stones on moor, Wherever mortals be. But toss your caps, O maids and men, Snow-bound long in farm-house pen: We chase Old Winter back to den. See our red waistcoats! Alive be thenâ Alive to the bridal-favors when They blossom your orchards every Spring, And cock-robin curves on a bridegroom's wing! CLOVER The June day dawns, the joy-winds rush, Your jovial fields are dresst; Rosier for thee the Dawn's red flush, Ruddier the Ruddock's breast. MADCAPS Through the orchard I follow Two children in glee. From an apple-tree's hollow They startle the bee. The White Clover throws Perfume in their way To the hedge of Red Rose; Between Roses and Clover The Strawberry grows. It is Lily and Cherry Companioned by Butterflies Madcaps as merry! THE OLD FASHION Now youthful is Ver And the same, and forever, Year after year; And her bobolinks sing, And they vary never In juvenile cheer. Old-fashioned is Ver Tho' eternally new, And her bobolink's young Keep the old fashion true: Chee, Chee! they will sing While the welkin is blue. BUTTERFLY DITTY Summer comes in like a sea, Wave upon wave how bright; Thro' the heaven of summer we'll flee And tipple the light! From garden to garden, Such charter have we, We'll rove and we'll revel, And idlers we'll be! We'll rove and we'll revel, Concerned but for this,â That Man, Eden's bad boy, Partakes not the bliss. THE BLUE-BIRD Beneath yon Larkspur's azure bells That sun their bees in balmy air In mould no more the Blue-Bird dwells Tho' late he found interment there. All stiff he lay beneath the Fir When shrill the March piped overhead, And Pity gave him sepulchre Within the Garden's sheltered bed. And soft she sighedâToo soon he came; On wings of hope he met the knell; His heavenly tint the dust shall tame; Ah, some misgiving had been well! But, look, the clear etherial hue In June it makes the Larkspur's dower; It is the self-same welkin-blueâ The Bird's transfigured in the Flower. THE LOVER AND THE SYRINGA BUSH Like a lit-up Christmas Tree, Like a grotto pranked with spars, Like white corals in green sea, Like night's sky of crowded starsâ To me like these you show, Syringa Such heightening power has love, believe, While here by Eden's gate I linger Love's tryst to keep, with truant Eve. THE DAIRYMAN'S CHILD Soft as the morning When South winds blow, Sweet as peach-orchards When blossoms are seen, Pure as a fresco Of roses and snow, Or an opal serene. TROPHIES OF PEACE ILLINOIS IN 1840 Files on files of Prairie Maize: On hosts of spears the morning plays! Aloft the rustling streamers show: The floss embrowned is rich below. When Asia scarfed in silks came on Against the Greek and Marathon, Did each plume and pennon dance Sun-lit thus on helm and lance Mindless of War's sickle so? For them, a tasseled dance of death: For theseâthe reapers reap them low. Reap them low, and stack the plain With Ceres' trophies, golden grain. Such monuments, and only such, O Prairie! termless yield, Though trooper Mars disdainful flout Nor Annals fame the field. IN THE PAUPER'S TURNIP-FIELD Crow, in pulpit lone and tall Of yon charred hemlock, grimly dead, Why on me in preachment callâ Me, by nearer preachment led Here in homily of my hoe. The hoe, the hoe, My heavy hoe That earthward bows me to foreshow A mattock heavier than the hoe. A WAY-SIDE WEED By orchards red he whisks along, A charioteer from villa fine; With passing lash o' the whip he cuts A way-side Weed divine. But knows he what it is he does? He flouts October's god Whose sceptre is this Way-side Weed, This swaying Golden Rod? THE CHIPMUNK Heart of autumn! Weather meet, Like to sherbert Cool and sweet. Stock-still I stand, And him I see Prying, peeping From Beech-tree; Crickling, crackling Gleefully! But, affrighted By wee sound, Presto! vanishâ Whither bound? So did Baby, Crowing mirth, E'en as startled By some inkling Touching Earth, Flit (and whither?) From our hearth! FIELD ASTERS Like the stars in commons blue Peep their namesakes, Asters here, Wild ones every autumn seenâ Seen of all, arresting few. Seen indeed. But who their cheer Interpret may, or what they mean When so inscrutably their eyes Us star-gazers scrutinize. ALWAYS WITH US! Betimes a wise guest His visit will sever. Yes, absence endears. Revisit he would, So remains not forever. Well, Robin the wise one He went yestreen, Bound for the South Where his chums convene. Back, he'll come back In his new Spring vest And the more for long absence Be welcomed with zest. But thou, black Crow, Inconsiderate fowl, Wilt never awayâ Take elsewhere thy cowl? From the blasted hemlock's Whitened spur; Whatever the season, Or Winter or Ver Or Summer or Fall, Croaker, foreboder, We hear thy callâ Caw! Caw! Caw! STOCKINGS IN THE FARM-HOUSE CHIMNEY Happy, believe, this Christmas Eve Are Willie and Rob and Nellie and Mayâ Happy in hope! in hope to receive These stockings well stuffed from Santa Claus' sleigh. O the delight to believe in a wight More than mortal, with something of man, Whisking about, an invisible spright, Almoner blest of Oberon's clan. Stay, Truth, O stay in a long delay! Why should these little ones find you out? Let them forever with fable play, Evermore hang the Stocking out! A DUTCH CHRISTMAS UP THE HUDSON IN THE TIME OF PATROONS Over the ruddy hearth, lo, the green bough! In house of the sickle and home of the plough, Arbored I sit and toast apples now! Hi, there in barn! have done with the flail. Worry not the wheat, nor winnow in the gale: 'Tis Christmas and holiday, turkey too and ale! Creeping round the wainscot of old oak red, The ground-pine, seeâsmell the sweet balsam shed! Leave off, Katrina, to tarry there and scan: The cream will take its time, girl, to rise in the pan. Meanwhile here's a knocking, and the caller it is Vanâ Tuenis Van der Blumacher, your merry Christmas man. Leafless the grove now where birds billed the kiss: To-night when the fidler wipes his forehead, I wis, And panting from the dance come our Hans and Cousin Chris, Yon bush in the window will never be amiss! But oats have ye heaped, men, for horses in stall? And for each heifer young and the old mother-cow Have ye raked down the hay from the aftermath-mow? The Christmas let come to the creatures one and all! Tho' the pedlar, peering in, doubtless deemed it but folly, The yoke-cattle's horns did I twine with green holly. Good to breathe their sweet breath this blest Christmas morn, Mindful of the ox, ass, and Babe new-born. The snow drifts and drifts, and the frost it benumbs: Elsie, pet, scatter to the snow-birds your crumbs. Sleigh-bells a' jingle! 'Tis Santa Claus: hail! Villageward he goes thro' the spooming of the snows; Yea, hurrying to round his many errands to a close, A mince-pie he's taking to the one man in jail.â What! drove right out between the gate-posts here? Well, well, little Sharp-Eyes, blurred panes we must clear! Our Santa Claus a clever way has and a free: Gifts from him some will take who would never take from me. For poor hereabouts there are none:ânone so poor But that pudding for an alms they would spurn from the door. All the same to all in the world's wide waysâ Happy harvest of the conscience on many Christmas Days. PART II THIS, THAT AND THE OTHER TIME'S BETRAYAL The tapping of a mature maple for the syrup, however recklessly done, does not necessarily kill it. No; since being an aboriginal child of Nature, it is doubtless blest with a constitution enabling it to withstand a good deal of hard usage. But systematically to bleed the immature trunk, though some sugar-makers, detected in the act on ground not their own, aver that it does the sylvan younker a deal of good, can hardly contribute to the tree's amplest development or insure patriarchal long life to it. Certain it is, that in some young maples the annual tapping would seem to make precocious the autumnal ripening or change of the leaf. And such premature change would seem strikingly to enhance the splendor of the tints. Someone, whose morals need mending, Sallies forth like the pillaging bee; He waylays the syrup ascending In anyone's saccharine tree; So lacking in conscience indeed, So reckless what life he makes bleed, That to get at the juices, his staple, The desirable sweets of the Spring, He poignards a shapely young maple, In my second-growth coppiceâits King. Assassin! secure in a crime never seen, The underwood dense, e'en his victim a screen, So be, But the murder will out, Never doubt, never doubt: In season the leafage will tell, Turning red ere the rime Yet, in turning, all beauty excell For a time, for a time! Small thanks to the scamp. But, in vision, to me A goddess mild pointing the glorified tree, âSo they change who die early, some bards who life render: Keats, stabbed by the Muses, his garland's a splendor!â PROFUNDITY AND LEVITY An owl in his wonted day-long retirement ruffled by the meadow-lark curvetting and caroling in the morning-sun high over the pastures and woods, comments upon that rollicker, and in so doing lets out the meditation engrossing him when thus molested. But the weightiness of the wisdom ill agrees with its somewhat trilling expression; an incongruity attributable doubtless to the contagious influence of the reprehended malapert's overruling song. So frolic, so flighty, Leaving wisdom behind, Lark, little you ween Of the progress of mind. While fantastic you're winging, Up-curving and singing, A skylarking dot in the sun; Under eaves here in wood My wits am I giving To this latest theme: Life blinks at strong light, Life wanders in night like a dreamâ Is then life worth living? INSCRIPTION For a Boulder near the spot where the last Hardback was laid low By the new proprietor of the Hill of Arrowhead. A weed grew here.âExempt from use, Weeds turn no wheel, nor run; Radiance pure or redolence Some have, but this had none. And yet heaven gave it leave to live And idle it in the sun. THE CUBAN PIRATE Some of the more scintillant West Indian humming-birds are in frame hardly bigger than a bettle or bee. Buccaneer in gemmed attireâ Ruby, amber, emerald, jetâ Darkling, sparkling dot of fire, Still on plunder are you set? Summer is your sea, and there The flowers afloat you board and ravage, Yourself a thing more dazzling fairâ Tiny, plumed, bejewelled Savage! Midget! yet in passion a fell Furioso, Creoles tell. Wing'd are you Cupid in disguise You flying spark of Paradise? IRIS (1865) When Sherman's March was over And June was green and bright, She came among our mountains, A freak of new delight; Provokingly our banner Salutes with Dixie's strain,â Little rebel from Savannah, Three Colonels in her train. Three bearded Puritan colonels: But O her eyes, her mouthâ Magnolias in their languor And sorcery of the South. High-handed rule of beauty, Are wars for man but vain? Behold, three disenslavers Themselves embrace a chain! But, loveliest invader, Out of Dixie did ye rove By sallies of your raillery To rally us, or move? For under all your merriment There lurked a minor tone; And of havoc we had tidings And a roof-tree overthrown. Ah, nurtured in the trialâ And ripened by the storm, Was your gaiety your courage, And levity its form? O'er your future's darkling waters, O'er your past, a frozen tide, Like the petrel would you skim it, Like the glancing skater glide? But the ravisher has won her Who the wooers three did slight; To his fastness he has borne her By the trail that leads thro' night. With Peace she came, the rainbow, And like a Bow did pass, The balsam-trees exhaling, And tear-drops in the grass. Now laughed the leafage over Her pranks in woodland scene: Hath left us for the revel Deep in Paradise the green? In truth we will believe it Under pines that sigh a balm, Though o'er thy stone be trailing Cypress-moss that drapes the palm. THE AVATAR Bloom or repute for graft or seed In flowers the flower-gods never heed. The rose-god once came down and tookâ Form in a rose? Nay, but indeed The meeker form and humbler look Of Sweet-Briar, a wilding or weed. THE AMERICAN ALOE ON EXHIBITION It is but a floral superstition, as everybody knows, that this plant flowers only once in a century. When in any instance the flowering is for decades delayed beyond the normal period, (eight or ten years at furthest) it is owing to something retarding in the environment or soil. But few they were who came to see The Century-Plant in flower: Ten cents admissionâprice you pay For bon-bons of the hour. In strange inert blank unconcern Of wild things at the Zoo, The patriarch let the sight-seers stareâ Nor recked who came to view. But lone at night the garland sighed While moaned the aged stem: âAt last, at last! but joy and pride What part have I with them?â Let be the dearth that kept me back Now long from wreath decreed; But, Ah, ye Roses that have passed Accounting me a weed! A GROUND VINE INTERCEDES WITH THE QUEEN OF FLOWERS FOR THE MERITED RECOGNITION OF CLOVER Hymned down the years from ages far, The theme of lover, seer, and king, Reign endless, Rose! for fair you are, Nor heaven reserves a fairer thing. To elfin ears the bell-flowers chime Your beauty, Queen, your fame; Your titles, blown thro' Ariel's clime, Thronged trumpet-flowers proclaim. Not less with me, a groundling, bear, Here bold for once, by nature shy:â If votaries yours be everywhere, And flattering you the laureats vie,â Meekness the more your heart should share. O Rose, we plants are all akin, Our roots enlock; Each strives to win The ampler space, the balmier air. But beauty, plainness, shade, and sunâ Here share-and-share-alike is none! And, ranked with grass, a flower may dwell, Cheerful, if never high in feather, With pastoral sisters thriving well In bloom that shares the broader weather; Charmful, mayhap, in simple grace, A lowlier Eden mantling in her face. My Queen, so all along I lie, But creep I can, scarce win your eye. But, O, your garden-wall peer over, And, if you blush, 'twill barely be At owning kin with Cousin Clover Who winsome makes the low degree. PART III RIP VAN WINKLE'S LILAC RIP VAN WINKLE'S LILAC âAy,âno!âMy brain is addled yet; With last night's flagonsâfull I forget. But look.âWell, well, it so must be, For there it is, and, sure, I see. Yon Lilac is all right, no doubt, Tho' never before, Ripâspied him out! But where's the willow?âDear, dear me! This is the hill-side,âsure; the stream Flows yon; and that, wife's house would seem But for the silence. Well, may be, For this one timeâHa! do I see Those burdocks going in at door? They only loitered round before! No,âay!âBless me, it is the same! But yonder Lilac! how now cameâ Rip, where does Rip van Winkle live? Lilac?âa lilac? Why, just there, If my cracked memory don't deceive, 'Twas I set out a Lilac fair, Yesterday morning, seems to me. Yea, sure, that it might thrive and come To plead for me with wife, tho' dumb. I found itâdear meâwell, well, well, Squirrels and angels they can tell! My head!âwhose head?âAh, Rip, (I'm Rip) That lilac was a little slip, And yonder lilac is a tree!â But why rehearse in every section The withered good-fellow's resurrection, Happily told by happiest Irving Never from genial verity swerving; And, more to make the story rife, By Jefferson acted true to life. Me here it but behooves to tell Of things that postumously fell. It came to pass as years went on (An Indian file in stealthy flight With purpose never man has known) A villa brave transformed the sight Of Rip's abode to nothing gone, Himself remanded into night. Each June the owner joyance found In one prized tree that held its ground, One tenant old where all was new,â Rip's Lilac to its youth still true. Despite its slant ungainly trunk Atwist and black like strands in junk, Annual yet it flowered aloft In juvenile pink, complexion soft. That owner hale, long past his May, His children's childrenâevery one Like those Rip romped with in the sunâ Merrily plucked the clusters gay. The place a stranger scented out By Boniface told in vinous wayâ âFollow the fragrance!â Truth to own Such reaching wafture ne'er was blown From common Lilac. Came about That neighbors, unconcerned before When bloomed the tree by lowly door, Craved now one little slip to train; Neighbor from neighbor begged again. On every hand stem shot from slip, Till, lo, that region now is dowered Like the first Paradise embowered, Thanks to the poor good-for-nothing Rip! Some think those parts should bear his name; But noâthe blossoms take the fame. Slant finger-posts by horsemen scanned Point the green milesâTo Lilac Land. Go ride there down one charmful lane, O reader mine, when June's at best, A dream of Rip shall slack the rein, For there his heart flowers out confessed. And there you'll say,âO, hard ones, truce! See, where man finds in man no use, Boon Nature finds oneâHeaven be blest!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A ROSE OR TWO PART I AS THEY FELL AMOROSO Rosamond, my Rosamond Of roses is the rose; Her bloom belongs to summer, Nor less in winter glows, When, mossed in furs all cosey, We speed it o'er the snows By ice-bound streams enchanted, While red Arcturus, he A huntsman ever ruddy, Sees a ruddier star by me. O Rosamond, Rose Rosamond, Is yonder Dian's reign? Look, the icicles despond Chill drooping from the fane! But Rosamond, Rose Rosamond, In us, a plighted pair, First makes with flame a bond,â One purity they share. To feel your cheek like ice, While snug the furs incloseâ This is spousal love's device This is Arctic Paradise, And wooing in the snows! Rosamond, my Rosamond, Rose Rosamond, Moss-Rose! HEARTH-ROSES The Sugar-Maple embers in bed Here fended in Garden of Fire, Like the Roses yield musk, Like the Roses are Red, Like the Roses expire Lamented when low; But, excelling the flower, Are odorous in ashes As e'en in their glow. Ah, Love, when life closes, Dying the death of the just, May we vie with Hearth-Roses, Smelling sweet in our dust. UNDER THE GROUND Between a garden and old tomb Disused, a foot-path threads the clover; And there I met the gardener's boy Bearing some dewy chaplets over. I marvelled, for I just had passed The charnel vault and shunned its gloom: âStay, whither wend you, laden thus; Roses! you would not these inhume?â âYea, for against the bridal hour My Master fain would keep their bloom; A charm in the dank o'the vault there is, Yea, we the rose entomb.â THE AMBUSCADE Meek crossing of the bosom's lawn Averted revery veil-like drawn, Well beseem thee, nor obtrude The cloister of thy virginhood. And yet, white nun, that seemly dress Of purity pale passionless, A May-snow is; for fleeting term, Custodian of love's slumbering germâ Nay, nurtures it, till time disclose How frost fed Amor's burning rose. THE NEW ROSICRUCIANS To us, disciples of the Order Whose rose-vine twines the Cross, Who have drained the rose's chalice Never heeding gain or loss; For all the preacher's din There is no mortal sinâ No, none to us but Malice! Exempt from that, in blest recline We let life's billows toss; If sorrow come, anew we twine The Rose-Vine round the Cross. THE VIAL OF ATTAR Lesbia's lover when bereaved In pagan times of yore Ere the gladsome tidings ran Of reunion evermore, He wended from the pyre Now hopeless in returnâ Ah, the vial hot with tears For the ashes cold in urn! But I, the Rose's lover, When my belovÃ¨d goes Followed by the Asters Toward the sepulchre of snows, Then, solaced by the Vial, Less grieve I for the Tomb, Not widowed of the fragrance If parted from the bloomâ Parted from the bloom That was but for a day; Rose! I dally with thy doom: The solace will not stay! There is nothing like the bloom; And the Attar poignant minds me Of the bloom that's passed away. ROSE WINDOW The preacher took from Solomon's Song Four words for text with mystery rifeâ The Rose of Sharon,âfiguring Him The Resurrection and the Life; And, pointing many an urn in view, How honied a homily he drew. There, in the slumberous afternoon, Through minster gray, in lullaby rolled The brimmed metheglin charged with swoon. Drowsy, my decorous hands I fold Till sleep overtakes with dream for boon. I saw an Angel with a Rose Come out of Morning's garden-gate, And lamp-like hold the Rose aloft, He entered a sepulchral Strait. I followed. And I saw the Rose Shed dappled down upon the dead; The shrouds and mort-cloths all were lit To plaids and chequered tartans red. I woke, the great Rose-Window high, A mullioned wheel in gable set, Suffused with rich and soft in dye Where Iris and Aurora met; Aslant in sheaf of rays it threw From all its foliate round of panes Transfiguring light on dingy stains, While danced the motes in dusty pew. ROSARY BEADS 1 THE ACCEPTED TIME Adore the Roses; nor delay Until the rose-fane fall, Or ever their censers cease to sway: âTo-day!â the rose-priests call. 2 WITHOUT PRICE Have the Roses. Needs no pelf The blooms to buy, Nor any rose-bed to thyself Thy skill to try: But live up to the Rose's light, Thy meat shall turn to roses red, Thy bread to roses white. 3 GRAIN BY GRAIN Grain by grain the Desert drifts Against the Garden-Land: Hedge well thy Roses, head the stealth Of ever-creeping Land. THE DEVOTION OF THE FLOWERS TO THEIR LADY Attributed to Clement Drouon, monk, a ProvenÃ§al of noble birth in the 11th century. In earlier life a troubadour, a devotee of Love and the Rose, but eventually, like some others of his stamp in that age, for an unrevealed cause retiring from the gay circles where he had long been a caressed favorite and ultimately disappearing from the world in a monastery. TO OUR QUEEN O Queen, we are loyal: shall sad ones forget? We are natives of Edenâ Sharing its memory with you, and your handmaidens yet. You bravely dissemble with looks that beguile Musing mortals to murmur Reproachful âSo festal, O Flower, we but weary the while? What nothing has happened? no event to make wan, Begetting things hatefulâ Old age, decay, and the sorrows, devourers of man?â They marvel and marvel how came you so bright, Whence the splendor, the joyanceâ Florid revel of joyance, the Cypress in sight! Scarce you would poor Adam upbraid that his fall Like a land-slide by waters Rolled an out-spreading impulse disordering all; That the Angel indignant, with eyes that foreran The betrayed generations, Cast out the flowers wherewith Eve decked her nuptials with man. Ah, exile is exile, tho' spiced be the sod, In Shushan we languishâ Languish with the secret desire for the garden of God. But all of us yetâ We the Lilies whose palor is passion, We the Pansies that muse nor forgetâ In harbinger airs how we freshen, When, clad in the amice of gray silver-hemmed, Meek coming in twilight and dew, The Day-Spring, with pale priestly hand and begemmed, Touches, and coronates you:â Breathing, O daughter of far descent, Banished, yet blessed in banishment, Whereto is appointed a term; Flower, voucher of Paradise, visible pledge, Rose, attesting it spite of the Worm. PART II THE ROSE FARMER Coming through the rye: Thereof the rural poet whistles; But who the flute will try At scrambling through the thistles! Nor less upon some roseate way Emerge the prickly passage may. But we who after ragged scrambles Through fate's blessed thorns and brambles Come unto our roses lateâ Aright to manage the estate, This indeed it well may task us Quite inexperienced as we be In aught but thickets that unmasque us Of man's ennobling drapery. Indigence is a plain estate: Riches imply the complicate. What peevish pestering wants surprise, What bothering ambitions rise! Then, too, Fate loans a lot luxurious At such hard cent-per-cent usurious! Mammon, never meek as Moses, Gouty, mattressed on moss-roses, A crumpled rose-leaf makes him furious. Allow, as one's purveyor here Of sweet content of Christian cheer, âVile Pelfâ we overestimate. Howbeit, a rose-farm nigh Damascus Would Dives change at even rate For Lazarus' snow-farm in Alaskus? But that recalls me: I return.â A friend, whose shadow has decreased, For whom they reared a turbaned urn, A corpulent grandee of the East, Whose kind good will to me began When I against his Rhamadan Prepared a chowder for his feast, Well dying, he remembered me: A brave bequest, a farm in fee Forever consecrate to roses, And laved by streams that sacred are, Pharpar and twin-born Abana, Which last the pleasure-ground incloses, At least winds half-way roundaboutâ That garden to caress, no doubt. But, ah, the stewardship it poses! Every hour the bloom, the bliss Upbraid me that I am remiss. For still I dally,âI delay,â Long do hesitate, and say, âOf fifty thousand Damask Roses,â (For my rose-farm no great matter), Shall I make me heaps of posies, Or some crystal drops of Attar? To smell or sell or for a boon. Quick you cull a rose and easy; But Attar is not got so soon, Demanding more than gesture breezy. Yet this same Attar, I suppose, Long time will last, outlive indeed The rightful sceptre of the rose And coronations of the weed. Sauntering, plunged in this debate, And somewhat leaning to elect The thing most easy to effect, I chanced upon a Persian late, A sort of gentleman-rose-farmer On knees beside his garden-gate Telling his beads, just like a palmer. Beads? coins, I meant. Each golden one Upon a wire of silver run; And every time a coin he told His brow he raised and eyes he rolled Devout in grateful orison. Surely, methought, this pious man, A florist, too, will solve my doubt. Saluting him, I straight began: âDecide, I pray, a dubious matterââ And put the Roses and the Attar. Whereat the roses near and farâ For all his garden was a lawn Of roses thick as daisies are In meads from smoky towns withdrawnâ They turned their heads like ladies, when They hear themselves discussed by men. But he, he swerved a wrinkled face, Elderly, yet with ruddy traceâ Tinged doubly by warm flushings thrown From sunset's roses and his own; And, after scanning me and sounding, âAnd you?âan older man than I? Late come you with your sage propounding: Allah! your time has long gone by.ââ âAlack, Sir, but so ruled the fate I came unto my roses late. What then? these gray hairs but disguise, Since down in heart youth never diesâ O, sharpened by the long delay, I'm eager for my roses quite; But first would settle this prime matterâ Touching the Roses and the Attar: I fear to err there; set me right.â Meseemed his purs'd eyes grateful twinkled Hearing of veteran youth unwrinkled, Himself being old. But now the answer Direct came, like a charging lancer: âAttar? Go ask the Parsee yonder. Lean as a rake with his distilling, Cancel his debts, scarce worth a shilling! How he exists I frequent wonder. No neighbor loves him: sweet endeavor Will get a nosegay from him never; No, nor even your ducats will; A very save-all for his still! Of me, however, all speak well: You see, my little coins I tell; I give away, but more I sell, In mossy pots, or bound in posies, Always a market for my roses. But attar, why, it comes so dear Tis far from popular, that's clear. I flourish, I; yon heavens they bless me, My darlings cluster to caress me.â At that fond sentence overheard, Methought his rose-seraglio stirred. But further he: âYon Parsee lours Headsman and Blue Beard of the flowers. In virgin flush of efflorescence When buds their bosoms just disclose, To get a mummified quintessence He scimeters the living rose! I grant, against my different way, Something, and specious, one might say. Ay, pluck a rose in dew Auroral, For buttonette to please the sight,â The dawn's bloom and the bloom but floral, Why, what a race with them in flight! Quick, too, the redolence it stales. And yet you have the brief delight, And yet the next morn's bud avails; And on in sequence.â Came that close, And, lo, in each flushed garden-bed, What agitation! every rose Bridling aloft the passionate head! But what it was that angered here,â Just why the high resentment shown, Pray ask of her who'll hint it clearâ A Mormon's first-wife making moan. But he, rose-farmer, long time versed In roses husbanded by him, Letting a glance upon them skim, Followed his thread and more rehearsed; And, waxing now a trifle warm: âThis evansecence is the charm! And most it wins the spirits that be Celestial, Sir. It comes to me It was this fleeting charm in show That lured the sons of God below, Tired out with perpetuity Of heaven's own seventh heaven aglow; Not Eve's fair daughters, Sir; nay, nay, Less fugitive in charm are they: It was the rose.â As this he said So flattering in imputation,â Angelic sweethearts overhead, Even seraphs paying them adoration,â Each rose, as favoring the whim Grave nodded,âas attesting him. âBut now, Sir, for your urgent matter. Every wayâfor wise employment, Repute and profit, health, enjoyment, I am for rosesâsink the Attar!â And hereupon the downright man To tell his rosary re-began. And never a rose in all the garden Blushed deeper there to hear their warden So forcefully express his mind. Methought they even seemed to laughâ True ladies who, in temper kind, Will pardon aught, though unrefined, Sincerely vouched in their behalf. Discreet, in second thought's immersion I wended from this prosperous Persian Who, verily, seemed in life rewarded For sapient prudence not amiss, Nor transcendental essence hoarded In hope of quintessential bliss: No, never with painstaking throes Essays to crystallize the rose. But here arrest the loomâthe line. Though damask be your precious stuff, Spin it not out too superfine: The flower of a subject is enough. L'ENVOI Rosy dawns the morning Syrian, Youthful as in years of Noah: Why then aging at three-score? Do moths infest your mantle Tyrian? Shake it out where the sun-beams pour! Time, Amigo, does but masque usâ Boys in gray wigs, young at core. Look, what damsels of Damascus, Roses, lure the Pharpar's shore! Sigh notâAge, dull tranquilizer, And arid years that filed before, For flowers unfit us. Nay, be wiser: Wiser in relish, if sedate Come gray-beards to their roses late.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MARQUIS DE GRANDVIN AT THE HOSTELRY Not wanting in the traditional suavity of his countrymen, the Marquis makes his salutation. Thereafter, with an ulterior design, entering upon a running retrospect touching Italian affairs. [I] Candid eyes in open faces Clear, not keen, no narrowing line: Hither turn your favoring graces Now the cloth is drawn for wine. In best of worlds if all's not bright, Allow, the shadow's chased by light, Though rest for neither yet may be. And beauty's charm, where Nature reigns, Nor crimes nor codes may quite subdue, As witness Naples long in chains Exposed dishevelled by the seaâ Ah, so much more her beauty drew, Till Savoy's red-shirt Perseus flew And cut that fair Andromeda free. Then Fancy flies. Nor less the trite Matter-of-fact transcends the flight: A rail-way train took Naples' town; But Garibaldi sped thereon: This movement's rush sufficing there To rout King Fanny, Bomba's heir, Already stuffing trunks and hampers, At news that from Sicilia passedâ The banished Bullock from the Pampas Trampling the royal levies massed. And, later: He has swum the Strait, And in Calabria making head, Cheered by the peasants garlanded, Pushes for Naples' nearest gate. From that red Taurus plunging on With lowered horns and forehead dun, Shall matadores save Bomba's son? He fled. And her Redeemer's banners Glad Naples greeted with strown flowers Hurrahs and secular hosannas That fidgety made all tyrant powers. Ye halls of history, arched by time, Founded in fate, enlarged by crime, Now shines like phosphorus scratched in dark 'Gainst your grimed walls the luminous mark Of one who in no paladin age Was knightlyâhim who lends a page Now signal in time's recent story Where scarce in vogue are âPlutarch's Men,â And jobbers deal in popular glory.â But he the hero was a sword Whereto at whiles Cavour was guard. The point described a fiery arc, A swerve of wrist ordained the mark. Wise statemanship, a ruling star Made peace itself subserve the war. In forging into fact a dreamâ For dream it was, a dream for longâ Italia disenthralled and one, Above her but the Alpsâno thong High flourished, held by Don or Hun; Italia, how cut up, divided Nigh paralysed, by cowls misguided; Locked as in Chancery's numbing hand, Fattening the predatory band Of shyster-princes, whose ill sway Still kept her a calamitous land; In ending this, spite cruel delay, And making, in the People's name, Of Italy's disunited frame, A unit and a telling State Participant in the world's debate; Few deeds of arms, in fruitful end, The statecraft of Cavour transcend. What towns with alien guards that teemed Attest Art's Holy Land redeemed. Slipt from the Grand Duke's gouty tread, Florence, fair flower up-lifts the head. Ancona, plucked from Peter's Chair, With all the Papal fiefs in band, Her Arch Imperial now may wear For popular triumph and command. And Venice: there the Croatian horde Swagger no more with clattering sword Ruffling the doves that dot the Square. In Rome no furtive cloaked one now Scribbles his gibe on Pasquin's brow, Since wag his tongue at Popes who may The Popedom needs endure his say. But (happier) feuds with princelings cease, The People federate a peace. Cremona fiddles, blithe to see Contentious cities comrades free. Sicilia,âUmbria,âmuster in Their towns in squads, and hail Turin. One state, one flag, one sword, one crown, Till time build higher or Cade pull down. Counts this for much? Well, more is won. Brave public works are schemed or done. Swart Tiber, dredged, may rich repayâ The Pontine Marsh, too, drained away. And, far along the Tuscan shore The weird Maremma reassume Her ancient tilth and wheaten plume. Ay, to reclaim Ansonia's land The Spirit o' the Age he'll take a hand. He means to dust each bric-a-brac city, Pluck the feathers from all banditti; The Pope he'll hat, and, yea or nay ye, Rejuvenate e'en poor old Pompeii! Concede, accomplished aims unite With many a promise hopeful and as bright. II Effecting a counterturn, the Marquis evokesâand from the Shades, as would seemâan inconclusive debate as to the exact import of a current term significant of that one of the manifold aspects of life and nature which under various forms all artists strive to transmit to canvas. A term, be it added, whereof the lexicons give definitions more lexicographical than satisfactory. Ay. But the Picturesque, I wonderâ The Picturesque and Old Romance! May these conform and share advance With Italy and the world's career? At little suppers, where I'm one, My artist-friends this question ponder When ale goes round; but, in brave cheer The vineyards yield, they'll beading run Like Arethusa burst from ground. Ay, and in lateral freaks of gamesome wit Moribund Old Romance irreverent twit. âAdieu, rosettes!â sighs Steen in way Of fun convivial, frankly gay, âAdieu, rosettes and point-de-vise!â All garnish strenuous time refuse; In peacocks' tails put out the eyes! Utility reignsâAh, well-a-way!â And bustles along in Bentham's shoes. For the Picturesqueâsuffice, suffice The picture that fetches a picturesque price! Less jovial ones propound at start Your Picturesque in what inheres? âIn nature point, in life, in art Where the essential thing appears. First settle that, we'll then take up The prior question.â âWell, so be,â Said Frater Lippi, who but heâ Exchanging late in changeable weather The cowl for the cap, a cap and feather; With wicked eye then twinkling fun, Suppressed in friendly decorous tone, âHere's Spagnoletto. He, I trow Can best avail here, and bestead.â Come then, hidalgo, what sayst thou? The Picturesqueâan example yield.â The man invoked, a man of brawn Tho' stumpt in stature, raised his head From sombre musings, and revealed A brow by no blest angel sealed, And mouth at corners droopt and drawn; And, catching but the last words, said âThe Picturesque?âHave ye not seen My Flaying of St. Batholomewâ My Laurence on the gridiron lean? There's Picturesque; and done as well As old Giotto's Dammed in Hell At Pisa in the Campo Santa.â They turn hereat. In merriment Ironic jeers the juniors vent, âThat's modest now, one hates a vaunter.â But Lippi: âWhy not Guido cite In Herod's Massacre?ââweening well The Little Spaniard's envious spite Guido against, as gossips tell. The sombrous one igniting here And piercing Lippi's mannered mien Flared up volcanic.âAh, too clear, At odds are furious and serene. Misliking Lippi's mischievous eye As much as Spagnoletto's mood, And thinking to put unpleasantness by, Swanevelt spake, that Dutchman good: âFriends, but the Don errs not so wide. Like beauty strange with horror allied,â As shown in great Leonardo's head Of snaky Medusa,âso as well Grace and the Picturesque may dwell With Terror. Vain here to divideâ The Picturesque has many a side. For me, I take to Nature's scene Some scene select, set off serene With any tranquil thing you pleaseâ A crumbling tower, a shepherd piping. My master, sure, with this agrees,â His turned appeal on Claude here lighting. But he, the mildest tempered swain And eke discreetest, too, may be, That ever came out from Lorraine To lose himself in Arcady (Sweet there to be lost, as some have been, And find oneself in losing e'en) To Claude no pastime, none, nor gain Wavering in theory's wildering maze; Better he likes, though sunny he, To haunt the Arcadian woods in haze, Intent shy charms to win or ensnare, Beauty his Daphne, he the pursuer there. So naught he said whate'er he felt, Yet friendly nodded to Swanevelt. III With all the ease of a Prince of the Blood gallantly testifying in behalf of an indiscreet lady the Marquis incontinently fibs, laying the cornerstone of a Munchausen fableâ But you, ye pleasant faces wise Saluted late, your candid eyes Methinks ye rub them in surprise: âWhat's this? Jan Steen and Lippi? Claude? Long since they embarked for Far Abroad! Have met them, you?â âIndeed, have I! Ma foi! The immortals never die; They are not so weak, they are not so craven; They keep time's sea and skip the haven.â Well, letting minor memories go: With other illustrious ones in row I met them once at that brave tavern Founded by the first Delmonico, Forefather of a flourishing line! 'Twas all in off-hand easy wayâ Pour passer le temps, as loungers say. In upper chamber did we sit The dolts below never dreaming it. The cloth was drawnâwe left alone, No solemn lackeys looking on. In wine's meridian, halcyon noon, Beatitude excludes elation. Thus for a while. Anon ensues All round their horizon, ruddying it, Such Lights Auroral, mirth and witâ Thy flashes, O Falernian Muse! IV After a little bye-scene between Van Dyke, and Franz Hals of Mechlin, an old topic is by the company, here and there, discussed anew. In which rambling talk Adrian Brouwer, tickled undesignedly by two chance-words from a certain grandee of artists, and more waggish than polite in addressing Carlo Dolce and Rembrant whimsically delivers his mind. 'Twas Hals began. He to Vandyck, In whose well-polished gentle mien The practiced courtier of Kings was seen: âVan, how, pray, do these revels strike? Once you'd have me to Englandâthere Riches to get at St. James's. Nayâ Patronage! 'Gainst that flattering snare, The more if it lure from hearth away, Old friendsâold vintages carry the day!â Whereto Vandyck, in silken dress Not smoother than his courteousness Smiled back, âWell, Franz, go then thy ways; Thy pencil anywhere earns thee praise, If not heapt gold.âBut hark the chat!â â'Tis gay,â said Hals, not deaf to that, âAnd witty should be. O the cup, Wit rises in exhalation up!â And sympathetic viewed the scene. Then, turning, with yet livelier mien, âMore candid than kings, less coy than the Graces, The pleasantness, Van, of these festival faces!â But what's the theme?â âThe theme was bentâ Be sure, in no dry argumentâ On the Picturesque, what 'tis,âits essence, Fibre and root, bud, efflorescence, Congenial soil, and where at best; Till, drawing attention from the rest, Some syllables dropt from Tintoretto, Negligent dropt; with limp lax air One long arm lolling over chair, Nor less evincing latent nerve Potential lazing in reserve. For strong he wasâthe dyer's son, A leonine strength, no strained falsettoâ The Little Tinto, Tintoretto, Yes, Titan work by him was done. And now as one in Art's degree Superior to his topicâhe: âThis Picturesque is scarce my care. But note it now in Nature's workâ A thatched hut settling, rotting trees Mossed over. Some decay must lurk: In florid things but small its share. You'll find it in Rome's squalid Ghetto, In Algiers at the lazaretto, In many a grimy slimy lair.â âWell put!â cried Brouwer with ruddled face, His wine-stained vesture,âhardly new,â Buttoned with silver florins true; âGrime mark and slime!âSquirm not, Sweet Charles.â Slyly, in tone mellifluous Addressing Carlo Dolce thus, Fidgety in shy fellowship, Fastidious even to finger-tip, And dainty prim; âIn Art the stye Is quite inodorous. Here am I: I don't paint smells, no no, no no, No more than Huysum here, whose touch In pinks and tulips takes us so; But haunts that reek may harbor much; Hey, Teniers? Give us boors at inns, Mud floorâdark settlesâjugsâold bins, Under rafters foul with fume that blinks From logs too soggy much to blaze Which yet diffuse an umberish haze That beautifies the grime, methinks.â To Rembrandt then: âYour sooty stroke! 'Tis you, old sweep, believe in smoke.â But he, reserved in self-control, Jostled by that convivial droll, Seemed not to hear, nor silence broke. V One of the greater Dutchman dirges the departed three-deckers of De Ruyter and Van Trump. To divert from which monody, a Lesser Master verbally hits off a kitchen-dresser, and in such sort as to evoke commendation from one [of] the Grand Masters, who nevertheless proposes a certain transmuting enhancement in the spirit of the latter's own florid and allegoric style. Here Van der Velde, who dreamy heard Familiar Brouwer's unanswered word, Started from thoughts leagues off at sea: âBelieve in smoke? Why, ay, such smoke As the swart old Dunderberg erst did foldâ When, like the cloud-voice from the mountain rolled, Van Tromp through the bolts of her broadside spokeâ Bolts heard by me!â And lapsed in thought Of yet other frays himself had seen When, fired by adventurous love of Art, With De Ruyter he'd cruised, yea, a tar had been. Reminiscent he sat. Some lion-heart old, Austerely aside, on latter days cast, So muses on glories engulfed in the Past, And laurelled ones stranded or overrolled By eventful Time.âHe awoke anon, Or, rather, his dream took audible tone.â Then filling his cup: âOn Zealand's strand I saw morn's rays slant 'twixt the bones Of the oaken Dunderberg broken up; Saw her ribbed shadow on the sand. Ayâpicturesque! But naught atones For heroic navies, Pan's own ribs and knees, But a story now that storied made the seas!â There the gray master-hand marine Fell back with desolated mien Leaving the rest in fluttered mood Disturbed by such an interlude Scarce genial in over earnest tone, Nor quite harmonious with their own. To meet and turn the tide-wave there, âFor me, friends,â Gerard Douw here said, Twirling a glass with sprightly air, âI too revere forefather Eld, Just feeling's mine too for old oak, One here am I with Van der Velde; But take thereto in grade that's lesser: I like old oak in kitchen-dresser, The same set out with Delf ware olden And well scoured copper sauce-pansâgolden In aureate rays that on the hearth Flit like fairies or frisk in mirth. Oak buffet too; and, flung thereon, As just from evening-market won, Pigeons and prawns, bunched carrots bright, Gilled fish, clean radish red and white, And greens and cauliflowers, and things The good wife's good provider brings; All these too touched with fire-side light. On settle there, a Phillis pleasant Plucking a delicate fat pheasant. Agree, the picture's picturesque.â âAy, hollow beats all Arabesque! But Phillis? Make her Venus, man, Peachy and plump; and for the pheasant, No fowl but will prove acquiescent Promoted into Venus' swan; Then in suffused warm rosy weather Sublime them in sun-cloud together. The Knight, Sir Peter Paul, 'twas he, Hatted in rich felt, spick and span, Right comely in equipment free With court-air of Lord Chamberlain: âSo! 'twere a canvas meet for donor. What say you, Paola of Verona?ââ Appealing here. âNamesake, 'tis good!â Laughed the frank master, gorgeous fellow, Whose raiment matched his artist-mood: Gold chain over russet velvet mellowâ A chain of honor; silver-gilt, Gleamed at his side a jewelled hilt. In feather high, in fortune free, Like to a Golden Pheasant, he. âBy Paul, 'tis good, Sir Peter! Yet Our Hollander here his picture set In flushful light much like your own, Tho' but from kitchen-ingle thrown.â But come to Venice, Gerard,âdo,â Round turning genial on him there, âHer sunsets,âthere's hearth-light for you; And matter for you on the Square. To Venice, Gerard!â âO, we Dutch, Signor, know Venice, like her much. Our unction thence we got, some say, Tho' scarce our subjects, nor your touch.ââ âTo Saint Mark's again, Mynheer, and stay! We're Cyprus wine.âBut, Monsieur,â turning To Watteau nigh; âYou vow in France, This Pittoresque our friends advance, How seems it to your ripe discerning? If by a sketch it best were shown, A hand I'll try, yes, venture one:â A chamber on the Grand Canal In season, say, of Carnival. A revel reigns; and, look, the host Handsome as CÃ¦sar Borgia sitsââ âThen Borgia be it, bless your wits!â Snapped Spagnoletto, late engrossed In splenetic mood, now riling up; I'll lend you hits. And let His Grace Be launching, ay, the loving-cup Among the princes in the hall At Sinigaglia: You recall? I mean those gudgeons whom his smile Flattered to sup, ere yet awhile, In Hades with Domitian's lords. Let sunny frankness charm his air, His raiment lace with silver cords, Trick forth the âChristian statesmanâ there. And, mind ye, don't forget the pall; Suggest itâhow politeness ended: Let lurk in shade of rearward wall Three bravoes by the arras splendid.â VI The superb gentleman from Verona, pleasantly parrying the not-so-pleasant little man from Spain, resumes his off-hand sketch.âToward Jan Steen, sapient spendthrift in shabby raiment, smoking his tavern-pipe and whiffing out his unconventional philosophy, Watteau, habited like one of his own holiday-courtiers in the Park of Fontainebleau, proves himself, tho' but in a minor incident, not lacking in considerate courtesy humane. âO, O, too picturesque by half!â Was Veronese's turning laugh; âNay, nay: but see, on ample round Of marble table silver-bound Prince Comus, in mosaic, crowned; Vin d'oro there in crystal flutesâ Shapely as those, good host of mine, You summoned ere our Sillery fine We popped to Bacchus in salutes;â Well, cavaliers in manhood's flower Fanning the flight o' the fleeing hour; Dames, too, like sportful dolphins free:â Silks irridescent, wit and glee. Midmost, a Maltese knight of honor Toasting and clasping his Bella Donna; One arm round waist with pressure soft, Returned in throbbed transporting rhyme; A hand with minaret-glass aloft, Pinnacle of the jovial prime! What think? I daub, but daub it, true; And yet some dashes there may do.â The Frank assented. But Jan Steen, With fellowly yet thoughtful mien, Puffing at skull-bowl pipe serene, âCome, a brave sketch, no mincing one! And yet, adzooks, to this I hold, Be it cloth of frieze or cloth of gold, All's picturesque beneath the sun; I mean, all's picture; death and life Pictures and pendants, nor at strifeâ No, never to hearts that muse thereon. For me, 'tis life, plain life, I limnâ Not satin-glossed and flossy-fine (Our Turburg's forte here, good for him). No, but the life that's wine and brine, The mingled brew; the thing as spanned By Jan who kept the Leyden tavern And every rollicker fellowly scannedâ And, under his vineyard, lo, a cavern! But jolly is Jan, and never in picture Sins against sinners by Pharisee stricture. Jan o' the Inn, 'tis he, for ruth, Dashes with fun art's canvas of truth.â Here Veronese swerved him round With glance well-bred of ruled surprise To mark a prodigal so profound, Nor too good-natured to be wise. Watteau, first complimenting Steen, Ignoring there his thriftless guise, Took up the fallen thread between. Tho' unto Veronese bowingâ Much pleasure at his sketch avowing; Yet fain he would in brief convey Some added wordsâperchance, in way To vindicate his own renown, Modest and true in pictures done: âAy, Signor; butâyour leaveâadmit, Besides such scenes as well you've hit, Your Pittoresco too abounds In life of old patrician grounds For centuries kept for luxury mere: Ladies and lords in mimic dress Playing at shepherd and shepherdess By founts that sing The sweet o'the year! But, Signorâhow! what's this? you seem Drugged off in miserable dream. How? What impends?â âBarbaric doom! Worse than the Constable's sack of Rome!â âCeil, ceil! The matter? tell us, do.â âThis cabbage Utility, parbleu! What shall insure the Carnivalâ The gondolaâthe Grand Canal? That palaced duct they'll yet deplete, Improve it to a huckster's street. And why? Forsooth, malarial!â There ending with an odd grimace, Reflected from the Frenchman's face. VII Brouwer inurbanely applauds Veronese, and is convivially disrespectful in covert remark on M. Angelo across the table.âRaphael's concern for the melancholy estate of Albert Durer. And so forth. At such a sally, half grotesque, That indirectly seemed to favor His own view of the Picturesque, Suggesting Dutch canals in savor; Pleased Brouwer gave a porpoise-snort, A trunk-hose Triton trumping glee. Claude was but moved to smile in thought; The while Velasques, seldom free, Kept council with himself sedate, Isled in his ruffed Castilian state, Viewing as from aloft the mien Of Hals hilarious, Lippi, Steen, In chorus frolicking back the mirth Of Brouwer, careless child of earth; Salvator Rosa posing nigh With sombre-proud satiric eye. But Poussin, he, with antique air, Complexioned like a marble old, Unconscious kept in merit there Art's pure Acropolis in hold. For Durer, piteous good fellowâ (His Agnes seldom let him mellow) His Sampson locks, dense curling brown, Sideways unbrageously fell down, Enshrining so the Calvary face. Hals says, Angelico sighed to Durer, Taking to heart his desperate case, âWould, friend, that Paradise might allure her!â If Fra Angelico so could wish (That fleece that fed on lilies fine) Ah, saints! the head in Durer's dish, And how may hen-pecked seraph pine! For Leonardo, lost in dream, His eye absorbed the effect of light Rayed thro' red wine in glassâa gleam Pink on the polished table bright; The subtle brain, convolved in snare, Inferring and over-refining there. But Michael Angelo, brief his stay, And, even while present, sat withdrawn. Irreverent Brouwer in sly way To Lippi whispered, âBrother good, How to be free and hob-nob with Yon broken-nosed old monolith Kin to the battered colossi-brood? Challenged by rays of sunny wine Not Memnon's stone in olden years Ere magic fled, had grudged a sign! Water he drinks, he munches bread. And on pale lymph of fame may dine. Cheaply is this Archangel fed!â VIII Herein, after noteing certain topics glanced at by the company, the Marquis concludes the entertainment by rallying the Old Guard of Greybeards upon the somnolent tendency of their years. This, with polite considerateness he does under the fellowly form of the plural pronoun. Finally he recommends them to give audience, by way of pastime, to the âAfternoon in Naplesâ of his friend and disciple Jack Gentian. And so the genial Frenchman takes French leave, a judicious way of parting as best sparing the feelings on both sides. So Brouwer, the droll. But others sit Flinting at whiles scintillant wit On themes whose tinder takes the spark, Igniting some less light perchanceâ The romanesque in men of mark; And this, Shall coming time enhance Through favoring influence, or abate Character picturesquely greatâ That rumored age whose scouts advance? And costume too they touch upon: The Cid, his net-work shirt of mail, And Garibaldi's woolen one: In higher art would each avail So just expression nobly graceâ Declare the hero in the face? On themes that under orchards old The chapleted Greek would frank unfold, And Socrates, a spirit divine, Not alien held to cheerful wine, That reassurer of the soulâ On these they chat. But more whom they, Even at the Inn of Inns do meetâ The Inn with greens above the door: There the mahogany's waxed how bright, And, under chins such napkins white. Never comes the mart's intrusive roar, Nor heard the shriek that starts the train, Nor teasing telegraph clicks again, No news is cried, and hurry is no moreâ For us, whose lagging cobs delay To win that tavern free from cumber, Old lads, in saddle shall we slumber? Here's Jack, whose genial sigh-and-laugh Where youth and years yblend in sway, Is like the alewife's half-and-half; Jack Gentian, in whose beard of gray Persistent threads of auburn tarry Like streaks of amber after day Down in the west; you'll not miscarry Attending here his bright-and-sombre Companion good to while the way With Naples in the Times of Bomba. END A SEQUEL Touching the Grand Canal's depletion If Veronese did but feign, Grave frolic of a gay Venetian Masking in Jeremy his vein; Believe, that others too may gambol In syllables as lightâyea, ramble All over each esthetic park, Playing, as on the violin, One random theme our dames to winâ The picturesque in Men of Mark. Nor here some lateral points they shun, And pirouette on this, for one: That rumored Age, whose scouts advance, Musters it one chivalric lance? Or shall it foster or abate Qualities picturesquely great? There's Garibaldi, off-hand hero, A very Cid CampeadÃ³r, Lion-Nemesis of Naples' Neroâ But, tut, why tell that story o'er! A natural knight-errant, truly, Nor priding him in parrying fence, But charging at the helm-pieceâhence By statesmen deemed a lord unruly. Well now, in days the gods decree, Toward which the levellers scything move (The Sibyl's page consult, and see) Could this our Cid a hero prove? What meet emprise? What plumed career? No challenges from crimes flagitious When all is uniform in cheer; For Tarquinsânone would be extant, Or, if they were, would hardly daunt, Ferruling brats, like Dionysius; And Mulciber's sultans, overawed, In dumps and mumps, how far from menace, Tippling some claret about deal board Like Voltaire's kings at inn in Venice. In fine, the dragons penned or slain, What for St. George would then remain! A don of rich erratic tone, By jaunty junior club-men known As one, who buckram in demur, Applies then the Johnsonian Sir; 'Twas he that rollicked thus of late Filliped by turn of chance debate. Repeat he did, or vary more The same conceit, in devious way Of grandees with dyed whiskers hoar Tho' virile yet: âAssume, and say The Red Shirt Champion's natal day Is yet to fall in promised time, Millennium of the busy bee; How would he fare in such a Prime? By Jove, sir, not so bravely, see! Never he'd quit his trading trips, Perchance, would fag in trade at desk, Or, slopped in slimy slippery sludge, Lifelong on Staten Island drudge, Melting his tallow, Sir, dipping his dips, Scarce savoring much of the Picturesque!â âPardon,â here purled a cultured wight Lucid with transcendental light; âPardon, but tallow none nor trade When, thro' this Iron Age's reign The Golden one comes in again; That's on the card.â âShe plays the spade! Delving days, Sir, heave in sightâ Digging days, Sir; and, sweet youth, They'll set on edge the sugary tooth: A treadmillâParadise they plight.â Let be, and curb this rhyming race!â Angel o' the Age! advance, God speed. Harvest us all good grain in seed; But sprinkle, do, some drops of grace Nor polish us into commonplace. NAPLES IN THE TIME OF BOMBA as told by Major Jack Gentian Chartering a nondescript holiday hack at his Neapolitan inn, Jack Gentian drives out, and is unexpectedly made the object of a spontaneous demonstration more to be prized by an appreciative recipient than the freedom of the city of New Jerusalem presented in a diamond box by a deputation from the Crown Council of Seraphim. [I] Behind a span whose cheery pace Accorded well with gala trimâ Each harness, in arch triumphal reared, With festive ribbons fluttering gay; In Bomba's Naples sallying forth In season when the vineyards mellow, Suddenly turning a corner roundâ Ha, happy to meet you, Punchinello! And, merrily there, in license free, The crowd they caper, droll as he; While, arch as any, rolled in fun, Such tatterdemalions, many a one! We jounced along till, just ahead, Nor far from shrine in niche of wall, A stoppage fell. His rug or bed In midmost way a tumbler spread, A posturing mountebank withall; Who, though his stage was out of doors, Brought down the house in jolly applause. âSignor,â exclaims my charioteer, Turning, and reining up, the while Trying to touch his jaunty hat; But here, essaying to condense Such opposite movements into one Failing, and letting fall his whip, âHis Excellency stops the way!â His Excellency there, meanwhileâ Reversed in stature, legs aloft, And hobbling jigs on hands for heelsâ Gazed up with blood-shot brow that told The tension of that nimble playâ Gazed up as martyred Peter might; And, noting me in landeau-seat (Milor, there he opined, no doubt) Brisk somersetted back, and stood Urbanely bowing, then gave place; While, tickled at my puzzled plight, Yet mindful that a move was due, And knowing me a stranger there, With one consent the people part Yielding a passage, and with eyes Of friendly fun,âhow courteous too! Catching an impulse from their air, To feet I spring, my beaver doff And broadcast wave a blithe salute. In genial way how humorsome What pleased responses of surprise; From o'er the Alps, and so polite! They clap their hands in frank acclaim Matrons in door-ways nod and smile From balcony roguish girls laugh out Or kiss their fingers, rain their nosegays down. At such a showerâlaugh, clap, and flowerâ My horses shy, the landeau tilts, Distractedly the driver pulls. But I, Jack Gentian, what reck I, The popular hero, object sole Of this ovation!âI aver No viceroy, king, nor emperor, Panjandrum Grand, conquistadorâ Not Caesar's self in car aloft Triumphal on the Sacred Way, No, nor young Bacchus through glad Asia borne, Pelted with grapes, exulted so As I in hackney-landeau here Jolting and jouncing thro' the waves Of confluent commoners who in glee Good natured past before my prow. II Arrested by a second surprise not in harmony with the first, he is thereupon precipitated into meditations more or less profound, though a little mixed, as they say. Flattered along by following cheers We sped; I musing here in mind, Beshrew me, needs be overdrawn Those shocking stories bruited wide, In England which I left but late, Touching dire tyranny in Naples. True freedom is to be care-free! And care-free seem the people here A truce indeed they seem to keep Gay truce to care and all her brood. But, look: what mean yon surly walls? A fortress? and in heart of town? Even so. And rapt I stare thereon. The battlements black-beetling hang Over the embrasures' tiers of throats Whose enfilading tongues seem trained Less to beat alien foemen off Than awe the town. âRabble!â they said, Or in dumb threatening seemed to say, âRevolt, and we will rake your lanes!â But what strange quietude of wall! While musing if response would be Did tourist on the clampt gate tap Politely there with slender caneâ Abrupt, to din condensed of drums And blast of thronged trumps trooping first, Right and left with clangor and clash The double portals outward burst Before streamed thronged bayonets that flash Like lightning's sortie from the cloud. Storming from the gloomy tower Tempestuous thro' the caverned arch, Like one long lance they lunge along, A thousand strong of infantry! The captains like to torches flaring, Red plumes and scarlet sashes blown, Bare sword in hand audacious gleaming; While, like ejected lava rolled, The files on files are vomited forth Eruptive from their crater belched! Sidelong, in vulpine craven sort, On either flank at louring brows Of tag-rag who before their sortie Divide in way how all unlike Their parting late before my wheels! Who makes this sortie? who? and why? Anon I learned. Sicilians, theseâ Sicilians from Palermo shipped In meet exchange for hirelings lent From Naples here to hold the Isle; And daily thus in seething town From fort to fort are trooping streamed To threaten, intimidate, and cow. Flaunting the overlording flag, Thumping the domineering drum, With insolent march of blustering arms They clean put out the festive stir, Ay, quench the popular fun. The fun they quench, but scarce the hate In bridled imprecations pale Of brooding hearts vindictive there, The deadlier bent for rasping curb, Through mutterings like deep thunder low, Couched thunder ere the leaping bolt, The swaggering troops and bullying trumpets go. They fleetâthey fade. And, altered much, In serious sort my way I hold, Till revery, taking candor's tone With optimistic influence plead: Sad, bad, confess; but solace bides! For much has Nature done, methinks, In offset here with kindlier aim. If bayonets flash, what vineyards glow! Of all these hells of wrath and wrong How little feels the losel light Who, thrown upon the odorous sod In this indulgent clime of charm Scarce knows a thought or feels a care Except to take his careless pleasure: A fig for Bomba! life is fair Squandered in superabundant leisure! Ay, but ye ragamuffs cutting pranks About the capering mountebanks Was that indeed mirth's true elation? Or even in some a patched despair, Bravery in tatters debonair, True devil-may-care dilapidation? Well, be these rubs even how they may, Smart cock-plumes in yon headstalls dance, Each harness with ribbons flutters gay, I see at pole our wreath advance: Inodorous muslin garlandâtrue: Impostor, but of jocund hue! Ah, could one but realities rout A holiday-world it were, no doubt. But Naples, sure she lacks not cheer, Religion, it is jubilee hereâ Feast follows festa thro' the year; And then such Nature all about! No surly moor of forge and mill, She charms us glum barbarians still, Fleeing from frost, bad bread, or duns, Despotic Biz, and devils blue, And there's our pallid invalid ones, Their hollow eyes the scene survey; They win this clime of more than spice, These myrtled shores, to wait the boat That ferries (so the pilots say), Yes, ferries to the isles afloat, The floating Isles of Paradise In God's Ãgean far away! O, scarce in trivial tenor all, Much less to mock man's mortal sigh, Those syllables proverbial fall, Naples, see Naples, andâthen die! But hark: yon low note rising clear; A singer!ârein up, charioteer! III Opening with a fervent little lyric which, if obscure in purport or anyway questionable to a Hyperborean professor of Agnostic Moral Philosophy, will nevertheless to readers as intelligently sympathetic as our honest narrator, be transparent enough and innocent as the Thirty Thousand Virgins of Cologne. âName me, do, that dulcet Donna Whose perennial gifts engaging Win the world to dote upon her In meridian never ageing! Look, in climes beyond the palms Younger sisters bare young charmsâ She the mellower graces! Ripened heart maturely kind, St. Martin's summer of the mind, And pathos of the years behindâ More than empty faces!â Who sings? Behold him under bush Of vintner's ivy nigh a porch, His rag-fair raiment botched and darned But face much like a Delphic coin's New disinterred with clinging soil. Tarnished Apollo!âBut let pass. Best here be heedful, yes, and chary, Sentiment nowadays waxeth wary, And idle the ever-cooked Alas. IV Quick as lightning he is presented with a festive flower by the titillating fingers of a flying Peri, who thereupon spinning in pirouette, evaporates or vanishes. Advancing now, we passed hard by A regal court where under drill Drawn up in line the palace-guard Behind tall iron pickets spiked With gilded barbs, in martial din Clanged down their muskets on the pave. Some urchins small looked on, and men With eye-lids squeezed, yet letting out A flame as of quick lightning thin; The Captain of the guard meanwhile, A nervous corpulence, on these Stealing a restive sidelong glance. A curve. And rounding by the bay Nigh Edens parked along the verge, Brief halt was made amid the press; And, instantaneous thereupon, A buoyant nymph on odorous wing A lighting on the landeau-step, Half hovering like a humming-bird, A flower pinned to my lapelle, Letting a thrill from finger brush (Sure, unaware) the sensitive chin; Yes, badged me in a twinkling bright With O a red and royal rose; A rose just flowering from the bud Received my tribute, random coins, Beaming received it, chirped adieu, Twirled on her pivot andâwas gone! An opening came; and in a trice The horses went, my landeau rocked, The ribbons streamed; while, ruddy now, Flushed with the rose's reflex bloom, I dwelt no more on things amiss: Come, take thine ease; lean back, my soul; The world let spin; what signifies? Look, she, the flower-girlâwhat recks she Of Bomba's sortie? what indeed! Fine sortie of her own, the witch, But now she made upon my purse, And even a craftier sally too! V Giving way to thoughts less cheerful than archaic, he is checked by a sportive sally from the Rose. But is anew troubled, catching sight of an object attesting a Power even more nitrous and menacing than the Bomb-King himself. In short, another and greater crowned artilleryman, a capricious dominator, impossible to dethrone, and reigning by right incontestably divine. Pondering which discouraging fact, once more our genial friend is twitted by the festive Mentor. âSignor, turn here?â And turn we did, Repassing scenes that charmed erewhile, Nor less could charm reviewed even now. What blandishment in clime, or else What subtler influence, my rose, From thee exhaled, thou Lydian one, Seductive here could flatter me Even in emotion not unfelt While fleeting from that warmish pair! If, taking tone indeed from them, No lightsome thought awhile prevailed Devious it drifted like a dream. I mused on Virgil, here inurned On Pausilippo, legend tellsâ Here on the slope that pledges ease to pain, For him a pledge assuredly true If here indeed his ashes beâ Rome's laureat in Rome's palmy time; Nor less whose epic's undertone In volumed numbers rolling bland, Chafing against the metric bound, Plains like the South Sea ground-swell heaved Against the palm-isle's halcyon strand. What Mohawk of a mountain 'lours! A scalp-lock of Tartarian smoke Thin streaming forth from tawny brow, One heel on painted Pompeii set, And one on Hercules 'whelmed town! The Siren's seat for pleasurists lies Betwixt two threatening bombardiers Their mortars loaded, linstocks litâ Vesuvius yonderâBomba here. Events may Bomba's batteries spike: But how with thee, sulphurious Hill Whose vent far hellward reaches down! Ah, funeral urns of time antique Inwrought with flowers in gala play, Whose form and bacchanal dance in freak, Even as of pagan time ye speak Type ye what Naples is alway? Yes, round these curved volcanic shores, Vined urn of ashes, bed on bed, Abandonment as thoughtless pours As when the revelling pagan led. And here again I droopt the brow, And, lo, again I saw the Rose, The red red ruddy and royal Rose! Expanded more from bud but late Sensuous it lured, and took the tone Of some light taunting Cyprian gay In shadow deep of college-wall Startling some museful youth afootâ âMooning in mind? Ah, lack-a-day!â VI Uninfluenced by the pranks and rhymes of certain Merry Andrews of the beach, he unaccountably falls into an untimely fit of historic reminiscences. For which dereliction, the Rose, now in a pleading mood, touchingly upbraids him. But again he relapses, notwithstanding an animated call, subsequently heard, to regale himself with ruddy apples and sweet oranges. I turned me short; and, timely now, Beheld this scene: damsels sun-burnt, In holiday garb with tinsel trimmed; And men and lads behind them ranged About a carpet on the beach, Whereon a juggler in brocade Made rainbows of his glittering balls, Cascading them with dexterous sleight; And as from hand to hand they flew With minglings of interior din, He trilled a ditty deftly timed To every lilted motion light:â âThe balls, hey! the balls, Cascatella of ballsâ Baseless arches I toss up in air! Spinning we go,â Now over, now under; High Jack is Jack low, And never a blunder! Come hitherâgo thither: But wherefor nowhither? I lose themâI win them, From hand to hand spin them, Reject them, and seize them, And toss them, and tease them, And keep them forever in air, All to serve but a freak of my glee! Sport ye thus with your spoonies, ye fair, For your mirth? nor even forbear To juggle with Nestors your thralls? Do ye keep them in play with your smiling and frowning, Your flirting, your fooling, abasing and crowning, And dance them as I do these balls?â With that, and hurrying his two hands, Arching he made his meteors play; When, lo, like Mercury dropped from heaven, Precipitate there a tumbler flew, Alighting on winged feet; then sang, Dancing at whiles, and beating time, Clicking his nimble heels together In hornpipe of the gamesome kid: âOver mines, by vines That take hot flavor From Vesuviusâ Hark, in vintage Sounds the tabor! âIn brimstone-colored Tights or breeches There the Wag-fiend Dancing teaches; âHigh in wine-press Hoop elastic Pigeon-wings cut In rite fantastic; âWhile the black grape, Spirting, gushing, Into red wine Foameth rushing! âWhich wine drinking, Drowning thinking, Every night-fall, Heard in Strada, Kiss the doves And coos the adder!â While yet I listened, vivid came A flash of thought that carried me Back to five hundred years ago. I saw the panoramic bay In afternoon beneath me spreadâ All Naples from siesta risen Peopling the benches, barges, moles. Cooled over blue waves tinkling bland Came waftures from Sorrento's vines, And Queen Joanna, queen and bride, Sat in her casement by the sea, Twining three strands of silk and gold Into a cord how softly strung. âFor what this dainty rope, sweet wife?â It was the bridegroom who had stolen Behind her chair, and now first spoke. âTo hang you with, Andrea,â she said Smiling. He shrugged his shoulders; âNay, What need? I'll hang but on your neck.â And straight caressed her; and when she Sat mutely passive, smiling still. For jest he took it? But that night A rope of twisted silk and gold Droopt from a balcony where vines In flower showed violently torn; And, starlit, thence what tassel swung! For offset to Eve's serpent twined In that same sleek and shimmering cord, Quite other scene recurred. In hall Of Naples here, withall I stood Before the pale mute-speaking stone Of seated Agrippinaâshe The truest woman that ever wed In tragic widowhood transfixed; In cruel craft exiled from Rome To gaze on Naples' sunny bay, More sharp to feel her sunless doom. O ageing face, O youthful form, O listless hand in idle lap, And, ah, what thoughts of God and man! But intervening here, my Flower, Opening yet more in bloom the less, Maturing toward the wane,âlow-breathed, Again? and quite forgotten me? You wear an Order, me, the Rose, To whom the favoring fates allot A term that shall not bloom outlast; No future's mine, nor mine a past. Yet I'm the Rose, the flower of flowers. Ah, let time's present time suffice, No Past pertains to Paradise. Time present. Well, in present time It chanced a lilting note I heard, A fruit-girl's, and she fluted this: âLove-apples, love-apples! All dew, honey-dew, From orchards of Cyprusâ Blood-oranges too! âWill you buy? prithee, try! They grew facing south; See, mutely they languish To melt in your mouth! â'Tis now, take them now In the hey-day of flush, While the crisis is on, And the juices can gush! âLove-apples, love-apples, All dew, honey-dew, From orchards of Cyprusâ Blood-oranges, too!â Warbling and proffering them she went, And passed, and left me as erewhile, For the dun annals would not down. Murky along the sunny strand New spectres streamed from shades below, Spectres of Naples under Spain, Phantoms of that incensed Revolt With whose return Wrath threatens still Bomba engirt with guards.âLo, there, A throng confused, in arms they pass, Arms snatched from smithy, forge and shop: Craftsman and sailors, peasants, boys, And swarthier faces dusked betweenâ Brigands and outlaws; linked with these Salvator Rosa, and the fierce Falcone with his fiery school; Pell-mell with riff-raff, banded all In league as violent as the sway Of feudal claims and foreign lords Whose iron heel evoked the spark That fired the populace into flame. And, see, dark eyes and sunny locks Of Masaniello, bridegroom young, Tanned marigold-cheek and tasselled cap; The darling of the mob; nine days Their great Apollo; then, in pomp Of Pandemonium's red parade, His curled head Gorgoned on the pike, And jerked aloft for God to see. A portent. Yes, and typed the years Red after-years, and whirl of error When Freedom linkt with Furies raved In Carmagnole and cannibal hymn, Mad song and dance before the ark From France imported with The Terror! To match the poison, mock the clime, Hell's cornucopia crammed with crime! Scarce cheerful here the revery ran. Nor did my Rose now intervene, Full opening out in dust and sun Which hurried along that given term, She said would never bloom outlast. VII He encounters a prepossessing little tatterdemalion Triton, shell in hand, dewy in luminous spray of a rainbowed fountain. With the precocity of his precocious tribe, the juvenile Levantine, knowing that there is nothing the populace everywhere more like to hear than something touching upon themselves, their town and their period, entertains his street-audience accordingly with certain improvisations partaking alike of the sentiment and devil-may-care incident to the Neapolitan. By marbles where a fountain rose In jubilant waters scurrying high To break in sleet against the blue, I saw a thing as freshly brightâ A boy, who holding up a shell, Enamelled part, with pinkish valve New dipped in rainbows of the spray, By mute appeal, with deference touched, As if invoking Naples' monarch, Not her mob, attention craved. A weed of life, a sea-weed he From the Levant adventuring out; A cruiser light, like all his clan Who, in repletion's lust for more, And penury's strife for daily bread, As licensed by compassionate heaven To privateer it on their wits, The Mid Sea rove from quay to quay, At home with Turban, Fez, or Hat; Ready in French, Italian, Greekâ Linguists at large; alert to serve As chance interpreters or guides; Suave in address, with winning waysâ Arch imps of Pandarus, a few; Others with improvising gift Of voweled rhyme in antic sort, Or passionate, spirited by their sun That ripens them in early teens; And some with small brown fingers slim Busier than the jackdaw's bill. But he, what gravity is his! Precociously sedate indeed In beauty sensuously serene. White-draped, and ranked aloft in choir A treble clear in rolling laud Meet would he look on Easter morn. The muster round him closing more, How circumspect he plays his part; His glance intelligent taking in The motley miscellaneous groups: Large-chested porters, swarthy dames In dress provincial that beseems; Fishermen bronzed, and barbers curled; Fat monk with paunched umbrella blue; The quack, magnific in brocade Chapeau and aigulets; the wight That cobbles shoes in public way; Mariners in red Phrygian caps. But, twinkling brief, his liquid glance Skims one poor figure limp that leans Listlessly deaf amid the hum. A purblind man, too, sly he views With staff before him, pattering thin; Informers these, perchance, and spies? So queries one, a craftsman there, Nudging his fellow, winking back. And, verily, rumor long has run That Bomba's blind men well can see, His deaf men hear, his dumb men talk. But never amid the varied throng The boy a stragging soldier notes In livery lace declaring him. Howbeit, some sombre garbs he views: A Jesuit grave, genteely sleek In dapper small-clothes and fine hose Of sable silk, and shovel-hat, Hard by a doctor of the law, In sables, too, with parchment cheek; A useful man to lawless power, Expert to legalise the wrong. The twain, brief tarrying there behind, Went sauntering off ere came the close. But now the lad, in posture grave, With sidelong leaning head intent, The shell's lips to his listening ear, In modulating tone began: âMetheglin befuddles this freak o' the sea, Humming, low hummingâin brain a bee! âHymns it of Naples her myriads warming? Involute hive in fever of swarming. âWhat Hades of sighs in irruption suppressed, Suffused with huzzahs that buzz in arrest! âNeapolitans, ay, 'tis the soul of the shell Intoning your Naples, Parthenope's bell. âO, couch of the Siren renowned thro' the sea That enervates Salerno, seduces BaiÃ¦; âI attend you, I hear; but how to resolve The complex of conflux your murmurs involve!â He paused, as after prelude won; Abrupt then in recitative, he: âHark, the stir The ear invading: âCrowds on crowds All promenading; âClatter and clink Of cavalcading; âYo-heave-ho! From ships unlading; âFuneral dole, Thro' arches fading; âAll hands round! In masquerading; âLitany lowâ High rodomontading; âGrapes, ripe grapes! In cheer evading; âLazarus' plaint All vines upbraiding; âCrack-crick-crack Of fusillading! âHurly-burly, late and early, Gossips prating, quacks orating, Daft debating: Furious wild reiteration And incensed expostulation! âDin condensed, All hubbub summing: Larking, laughing, Chattering, chaffing, Thrumming, strumming Singing, jingling All comminglingâ Till the Drum, Rub-a-dub sounded, doubly pounded, Redundant in deep din rebounded, Deafning all this hive of noises Babel-tongued with myriad voices, Drubs them dumb! No more larking, No more laughing, No more chattering, Nay, nor chaffingâ All is glum! To blab the reasonâ Were out of season, For, look, they come! Rub-a-dub, rub-a-dub, Rub-a-double-dub-dub, Rub-a-double-dub-dub-o' the drum!â Alert in his young senses five The lad had caught the wafted roll Of Bomba's barbarous tom-toms thumped, And improvised the beat. Anon The files wheeled into open view. A second troop a thousand strong With band and banners, flourished blades, Launched from second cannoned den And now in countermarch thereon; The great drum-major towering up In aigulets and tinsel tagsâ Pagoda glittering in Cathay! Arch whiskerando and gigantic A grandiose magnifico antic Tossing his truncheon in the van. A hifalutin exaggeration, Barbaric in his bearskin shako, Of bullying Bomba's puffed elation And blood-and-thunder proclamation, A braggadocio Bourbon-Draco! VIII While yet the bayonets flashed along And all was silent save the drum, Then first it was I chanced to note Some rose-leaves fluttering off in air, While on my lap lay wilted ones. Ah, Rose, that should not bloom outlast Now leaf by leaf art leaving me? But here anew the lad broke in:â âLo, the King's men They go marching! O, the instep Haughty arching!â Live the King! âWhat's the grin forâ Queer grimacing? Who, yon grenadiers Outfacing, Here dare sing Ironicallyâ Live the King?â But there, a comely wine-wife plump, A bustling motherly good body Who all along in fidgety sort Concern had shown, and tried her way To push up to this imp satiric, Got next him now, and clapping hand Across his mouth, she whispered him. He heard; then, turning toward the throng, âShe says, Young chick come down a peg, Nor risk being pent anew in egg.â Castel dell Ovo here was meant, The oval fortress on the bay, Hiving its captives in sea-cells; Nor patriots only, plotters deemed, But talkers, rhymesters, every kind Of indiscreetly innocent mind. Nor less the volatile audienceâlate Grinding their teeth at Bomba's guards, Were tickled by the allusive pun, Howbeit, the boy here made an end; And dulcet now, with decent air, Of mild petitionary grace: âCarlo am I, some carlins then!â He twitched his sash up, scarlet rag, Blithely in bonnet caught the coins, Then disappeared beyond the marge To dice with other imps as young, Ere yet a little and his star Evanish like the Pleiad lost. IX Herein, if Jack Gentian, ever reputed a man of veracity, is to be credited, so thin a thing as a wafer made of a little flour and water, and so forth, the same being viewless, or carefully covered from view, proves of far more efficacy in bringing a semi-insurgent populace to their knees than all the bombs, bayonets, and fusilades of the despot of Naples. The younker faded, voice and allâ He faded, and his carol died, Forgot anon in shifted scene; For, hark, what slender chimes are these On zephyr borne? And, look, the folk In one consent of strange accord, Part, and in expectation stand; Yet scarce as men who mirth awaitâ More like to crowds that wait eclipse, So gravely sobering seems to fall Those light lilt chimes now floating near, In harbinger ofâwhat behind? It comes; a corpulent form erect, And holds what looks a Titan stem Of lily-of-the-vale, the buds A congregation of small bellsâ Small, silver, and of dulcet tone, Drooping from willowy light wires; Behind, in square, four boys in albs Whose staves uphold a canopy, And, under this, a shining priest Who to some death-bed bears the host In mystic state before him veiled. A hush falls; and the people drop Stilly and instantaneous all As plumps the apple ripe from twig And cushions motionless in sod. My charioteer reins shortâtransfixed; The very mountebanks, they kneel; And idlers, all along and far, Bow over as the host moves onâ Bow over, and for time remain Like to Pompeiian masquers caught With fluttering garb in act of flight, For ages glued in deadly drift. But, look, the Rose, brave Rose, is where? Last petals falling, and its soul Of musk dissolved in empty air! And here this draught at hazard drawn, Like squares of fresco newly dashed, Cools, hardens, nor will more receive, Scarce even the touch that mends a slip: The plaster sets; quietusâbide. Let bide; nor all the piece esteem A medley mad of each extreme; Since, in those days, gyved Naples, stung By tickling tantalising pain, Like tried St. Anthony giddy hung Betwixt the tittering hussies twain: She sobbed, she laughed, she rattled her chain; Till the Red Shirt proved signal apt Of danger ahead to Bomba's son, And presently freedom's thunder clapt, And lo, he fell from toppling throneâ Fell down, like Dagon on his face, And ah, the unfeeling populace! But GaribaldiâNaples' host Uncovers to her deliverer's ghost, While down time's aisle, mid clarions clear Pale glory walks by valor's bier. AFTER-PIECE Skimming over the Poem a book, he tables it, and after sipping a cup of peevish tea, dwells upon the first verse. Pale âGlory-walks-by-Valor's-bier.â Now why a catafalque in close? No relish I that stupid cheer Ringing down the curtain on the Rose.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MISCELLANEOUS POEMS IMMOLATED Children of my happier prime, When One yet lived with me, and threw Her rainbow over life and time, Even Hope, my bride, and mother to you! O, nurtured in sweet pastoral air, And fed on flowers and light, and dew Of morning meadowsâspare, Ah, spare Reproach; spare, and upbraid me not That, yielding scarce to reckless mood But jealous of your future lot, I sealed you in a fate subdued. Have I not saved you from the drear Theft and ignoring which need be The triumph of the insincere Unanimous Mediocrity? Rest therefore, free from all despite, Snugged in the arms of comfortable night. MADAM MIRROR With wrecks in a garret I'm stranded, Where, no longer returning a face, I take to reflections the deeper On memories far to retrace. In me have all people confided, The maiden her charms has displayed, And truths unrevealed and unuttered To me have been freely betrayed. Some truths I might tell of the toilet Did not tenderness make me forget; But the glance of proud beauty slow fading It dies not away from me yet; Nor the eyes too long ceasing to shine,â Soliciting, shunning, well knowing that mine Were too candid to flatter when met. But pledged unto trueness forever, My confessional close as the friar's, How sacred to me are the trusting, Here nothing for scandal transpires. But ah, what of all that is perished, Nor less shall again be, again! What pangs after parties of pleasure, What smiles but disclosures of pain! O, the tears of the hopeless unloved, O, the start at old age drawing nearâ And what shadows of thoughts more tragical far Like clouds on a lake have been here! Tho' lone in a loft I must languish Far from closet and parlor at strife, Content I escape from the anguish Of the Real and the Seeming in life. THE WISE VIRGINS TO MADAM MIRROR Madam Mirror, believe we are sorry for you; But Ah, how console you or cheer! We are young, we go skipping, but you Are an old and forlorn garreteer! 'Tis we view the world thro' an arbor, The bride with the bridegroom appears; But you, retrospecting thro' tunnels See but widowers and widows on biers! To us that is foreign, in no sense will pair With cake, wine and diamonds, and blossoms in hair! But age!âAh, the crow will scarce venture To tread near the eyes flashing bold; He's a craven; and youth is immortal; 'Tis the elderly only grow old! But, Dame, for all misty recurrings To beacons befogged in the pastâ Less dismal they are, dame, than dubious; Nor joy leaves us time to forecast. Tho' the battered we hardly would banter, And never will ridicule use, Let us say that a twilight of inklings Is worth scarse the Pope's old shoes. For the rest, the skeletons meeting glass eyes Let a parable serve, if by chance it applies. A brace of green goggles they gabbled, old elves, Touching my queer spectacles they had descried; But the queerest of all were the goggles themselves, Rusty, fusty shagreen of the puckered fish-hide! But you, Madam Mirror, not here we type you, Nor twit you for being a glass With a druggish green blur and a horrible way Of distorting all objects, alas! Ourselves, so symmetric, our cavaliers tell, What, squint us to witches with broomsticks to sell! Oh yes, we are giddy, we whirl in youth's waltz, But a fig for Reflections when crookedly false! THE NEW ANCIENT OF DAYS THE MAN OF THE CAVE OF ENGIHOUL The man of bone confirms his throne In cave where fossils be; Outdating every mummy known, Not older Cuvier's mastodon, Nor older much the sea: Old as the Glacial Period, he; And claims he calls to mind the day When Thule's king, by reindeer drawn, His sleigh-bells jingling in icy morn, Slid clean from the Pole to the Wetterhorn Over frozen waters in May! Oh, the man of the cave of Engihoul, With Eld doth he dote and drule? A wizard one, his lore is none Ye spell with A. B. C.; But do-do tracks, all up and down That slate he poreth much upon, His algebra may be:â Yea, there he cyphers and sums it free; To ages ere Indus met ocean's swell Addeth Ã¦ons ere Satan or Saturn fell. His totals of time make an awful schism, And old Chronos he pitches adown the abysm Like a pebble down Carisbrook well. Yea, the man of the cave of Engihoul From Moses knocks under the stool. In bas-relief he late has shown A horrible show, agreeâ Megalosaurus, iguanodon, PalÃ¦otherium GlypthÃ¦con, A Barnum-show raree; The vomit of slimy and sludgey sea: Purposeless creatures, odd inchoate things Which splashed thro' morasses on fleshly wings; The cubs of Chaos, with eyes askance, Preposterous griffins that squint at Chance And Anarch's cracked decree! Oh the showman who dens in Engihoul, Would he fright us, or quit us, or fool? But, needs to own, he takes a tone, Satiric on nobs, pardee! âThough in ages whose term is yet to run, Old Adam a seraph may have for son, His gran'ther's a crab, d'y'see! And why cut your kinsman the ape?â adds he: âYour trick of scratching is borrowed from him, Grimace and cunning, with many a whim, Your fidgets and hypoes, and each megrimâ All's traced in the family tree!â Ha, the wag of the cave of Engihoul: Buss me, gorilla and ghoul! Obstreperous grown he'd fain dethrone Joe Smith, and e'en Jones Three; Against even Jos and great Mahone He flings his fossiliffer's stone And rattles his shanks for glee. I'll settle these parvenu fellows, he-he! Diluvian Jove of Ducalion's dayâ A parting take to the Phocene clay! He swears no Ens that takes a name Commensurate is with the vasty claim Of the protoplastic Fegee. O, the spook of the cave of Engihoul He flogs us and sends us to school. Hyena of bone! Ah, beat him down, Great Pope, with Peter's key, Ere the Grand Pan-Jam be overthrown With Joe and Jos and great Mahone, And the firmament mix with the sea; And then, my masters, where should we be? But the ogre of bone he snickers alone, He grins for his godless glee: âI have flung my stone, my fossil stone, And your gods, how they scamper,â saith he. Imp! imp of the cave of Engihoul, Shall he grin like the Gorgon and rule? THE RUSTY MAN (BY A SOURED ONE) In La Mancha he mopeth, With beard thin and dusty; He doteth and mopeth In library fustyâ 'Mong his old folios gropeth: Cites obsolete saws Of chivalry's lawsâ Be the wronged one's knight: Die, but do right. So he rusts and musts, While each grocer green Thriveth apace with the fulsome face Of a fool serene. THY AIM, THY AIM? Thy aim, thy aim? 'Mid the dust dearth and din, An exception wouldst win By some deed shall ignite the acclaim? Then beware, and prepare thee Lest Envy ensnare thee, And yearning be sequelled by shame. But strive bravely on, yet on and yet on, Let the goal be won; Then if, living, you kindle a flame, Your guerdon will be but a flower, Only a flower, The flower of repute, A flower cut down in an hour. But repute, if this be too tame, And, dying, you truly ennoble a nameâ Again but a flower! Only a flower, A funeral flower, A blossom of Dis from Proserpine's bowerâ The belated funeral flower of fame. THE OLD SHIPMASTER AND HIS CRAZY BARN Bewrinkled in shingle and lichened in board, With sills settling down to the sward, My old barn it leaneth awry; It sags, and the wags wag their heads going by. In March winds it creaks, Each gaunt timber shrieks Like ribs of a craft off Cape Horn; And in midst of the din The foul weather beats in; And the grain-chestâ'twould mould any corn! Pull it down, says a neighbor. Never mine be that labor! For a Spirit inhabits, a fellowly one, The like of which never responded to me From the long hills and hollows that make up the sea, Hills and hollows where Echo is none. The site should I clear, and rebuild, Would that Voice reinhabit?âSelf-willed, Says each pleasing thing Never Dives can buy, Let me keep where I cling! I am touchy as tinder Yea, quick to take wing, Nor return if I fly. CAMOENS 1 (BEFORE) Restless, restless, craving rest, Forever must I fan this fire, Forever in flame on flame aspire? Yea, for the God demands thy best. The world with endless beauty teems, And thought evokes new worlds of dreams: Then hunt the flying herds of themes. And fan, yet fan thy fervid fire Until the crucibled ore shall show That fire can purge, as well as glow. In ordered ardor nobly strong, Flame to the height of ancient song. Camoens In The Hospital 2 (AFTER) What now avails the pageant verse, Trophies and arms with music borne? Base is the world; and some rehearse How noblest meet ignoble scorn Vain now the ardor, vain the fire, Delirium mere, unsound desire: Fate's knife hath ripped the chorded lyre. Exhausted by the exacting lay, Thou dost but fall a surer prey To wile and guile ill understood; While they who work them, fair in face, Still keep their strength in prudent place, And claim they worthier run life's race, Serving high God with useful good. MONTAIGNE AND HIS KITTEN Hither, Blanche! 'Tis you and I. Now that not a fool is by To say we fool itâlet us fool! We, you know, in mind are one, Alumni of no fagging school; Superfluous business still we shun; And ambition we let go, The while poor dizzards strain and strive, Rave and slave, drudge and drive, Chasing ever, to and fro, After ends that seldom gain Scant exemption from life's pain. But preachment proses, and so I. Blanche, round your furred neck let me tie This Order, with brave ribbon, see,â The King he pinned it upon me. But, hark ye, sweetingâwell-a-day! Forever shall ye purr this wayâ Forever comfortable be? Don't you wish now 'twas for ye, Our grandiose eternity? Pish! what fops we humans here, Won't admit within our sphere The whitest doe, nor even theeâ We, the spotless humans, we! Preaching, prosingâscud and run, Earnestness is far from fun. Bless me, Blanche; we'll frisk to-night, Hearts be ours lilt and lightâ Gambol, skip, and frolic, play: Wise ones fool it while they may! FALSTAFF'S LAMENT OVER PRINCE HAL BECOME HENRY V One that I cherished, Yea, loved as a sonâ Up early, up late with, My promising one: No use in good nurture, None, lads, none! Here on this settle He wore the true crown, King of good fellows, And Fat Jack was oneâ Now, Beadle of England In formal arrayâ Best fellow alive On a throne flung away! Companions and cronies Keep fast and lament;â Come drawer, more sack here To drown discontent; For now intuitions Shall wither to codes, Pragmatical morals Shall libel the gods.â One I instructed, Yea, talked toâalone: Preceptâexample Clean away thrown! (Sorrow makes thirsty: Sack, drawer, more sack!â) One that I prayed for, I, Honest Jack!â To bring down these gray hairsâ To cut his old pal! But, I'll be magnanimousâ Here's to thee, Hal! SHADOW AT THE FEAST MRS. B? (1847) Now churches are leafy, Now evergreens reign; 'Tis green Burnam wood Come to gray Dunsinane! Now the night it is starry And lavishly go In a largess of music The bells thro' the snow. Now burn the decanters Like turrets that rise All garnet in sunset Of orient skies. O, snugged in the Valley, A homestead of hearts! Love flies like a shuttle, And knits while it darts. Brown brothers, fair sisters, Bright cousins and all, Keeping Christmas at table, The large and the small. But a kinswoman glideth, Infantile in grace, Sits down and is silentâ Medallion in place! O, the hearth is like ruby, The curtains they glow; But she who sits sadly Her story we know: The blossom of orange Turned cypress so soon! Child-bride of the May-time Child-widow in June! Snow-white is her raiment; And sorrow so mild, An elf-sorrow seemeth, As she an elf-child. In patience she sitteth; Tho' cometh no balm, She floats, holy lily, On waters of calm. Come pass the decanter! Our hearts let us cheer, Yea, I wish Merry Christmasâ But let her not hear! MERRY DITTY OF THE SAD MAN Let us all take to singing Who feel the life-thong; Let us all take to singing, And this be the songâ Nothing like singing When blue-devils throng! Along, come along: Nothing like singing (The rhyme keep a' ringing) Just nothing like singing, No, nothing for sorrow but song! HONOR With jeweled tusks and damask housings August the elephants appear: Grandees, trumpets, banners, soldiersâ One flame from van to rear! Bid by India's King they travel In solemn embassage to-day, To meet the Diamond from Golconda, The Great Find of Cathay. O the honor, O the homage! But, methinks, 'twere nice, Would they say but How-de-do? To the Little Pearl of Price. FRUIT AND FLOWER PAINTER She dens in a garret As void as a drum; In lieu of plum-puddingâ She paints the plum! No use in my grieving, The shops I must suit: Broken hearts are but potsherdsâ Paint flowers and fruit! How whistles her garret, A seine for the snows: She hums Si fortuna, Andâpaints the rose! December is howling, But feign it a flute: Help on the deceivingâ Paint flowers and fruit! THE MEDALLION IN VILLA ALBINA &amp;C Since seriousness in many a face, Open or latent, you may traceâ The ground-expression, wherein close All smiles at last; and ever still The revelation of repose; Which sums the life, and tells the mood Of inmost self in solitudeâ Then wherefore, World, of bards complain Whose verse the years and fate imbue With reveries where no glosings reignâ An even unelated strain In candor grave, to nature due? TIME'S LONG AGO! Time's Long Ago! Nor coral isles In the blue South Sea more serene When the lagoons unruffled show. There, Fates and Furies change their mien. Though strewn with wreckage be the shore The halcyon haunts it; all is green And wins the heart that hope can lure no more. IN THE HALL OF MARBLES (LINES RECALLED FROM A DESTROYED POEM) If genius, turned to sordid ends Ye count to glory lost, How with mankind that flouts the aims Time's Attic years engrossed? Waxes the world so rich and old? Richer and narrower, age's way? But, primal fervors all displaced Our arts but serve the clay. This plaint the sibyls unconsoled renew: Man fell from Eden, fall from Athens too. GOLD IN THE MOUNTAIN Gold in the mountain And gold in the glen, And greed in the heart, Heaven having no part, And unsatisfied men. IN THE JOVIAL AGE OF OLD In the jovial age of old Named from gold, Gold was none for DanÃ¦'s shower; While forever silvery fell Down in dell Bridal blossoms from love's bower. A SPIRIT APPEARED TO ME A Spirit appeared to me, and said âWhere now would you choose to dwell? In the Paradise of the Fool, Or in wise Solomon's hell?â Never he asked me twice: âGive me the fool's Paradise.â GIVE ME THE NERVE Give me the nerve That never will swerve Running out on life's ledges of danger; Mine, mine be the nerve That in peril will serve, Since life is to safety a stranger. When roaring below The cataracts go, And tempests are over me scudding; Give, give me the calm That is better than balm, And the courage that keepeth new-budding. MY JACKET OLD My jacket old, with narrow seamâ When the dull day's work is done I dust it, and of Asia dream, Old Asia of the sun! There other garbs prevail; Yea, lingering there, free robe and vest Edenic Leisure's age attest Ere Work, alack, came in with Wail. IN THE OLD FARM-HOUSE THE GHOST Dead of night, dead of night, Living souls are a'bed; Dead of night, dead of night, And I sit with the dead. He laughs in white sheet, And I, I laugh too, 'Tis Shakespeareâgood fellowâ And Falstaff in view. TO ? Ah, wherefore, lonely, to and fro Flittest like the shades that go Pale wandering by the weedy stream? We, like they, are but a dream: Then dreams, and less, our miseries be; Yea, fear and sorrow, pain, despair Are but phantoms. But what plea Avails here? phantoms having power To make the heart quake and the spirit cower. A BATTLE PICTURE Three mounted buglers laced in gold, Sidelong veering, light in seat, High on the crest of battle rolled Ere yet the surge is downward beat, The pennoned trumpets lightly holdâ Mark how they snatch the swift occasion To thrill their rearward invocationâ While the sabres, never coy, Ring responses as they ride; And, like breakers of the tide, All the mad plumes dance for joy! OLD AGE IN HIS AILING Old Age in his ailing At youth will be railing It scorns youth's regaling Pooh-pooh it does, silly dream; But me, the fool, save From waxing so grave As, reduced to skimmed milk, to slander the cream. HEARTS-OF-GOLD Pity, if true, What the pewterer saidâ Hearts-of-gold be few. Howbeit, when snug in my bed, And the fire-light flickers and yellows, I dream of the hearts-of-gold spedâ The Falernian fellowsâ Hafiz and Horace, And Berangerâall Dexterous tumblers eluding the Fall, Fled? can be sped? But the marygold's morris Is danced o'er their head; And their memory mellows, Embalmed and becharmed, Hearts-of-gold and good fellows! PONTOOSUCE Crowning a bluff where gleams the lake below, Some pillared pines in well-spaced order stand And like an open temple show. And here in best of seasons bland, Autumnal noon-tide, I look out From dusk arcades on sunshine all about. Beyond the Lake, in upland cheer Fields, pastoral fields and barns appear, They skirt the hills where lonely roads Revealed in links thro' tiers of woods Wind up to indistinct abodes And faery-peopled neighborhoods; While further fainter mountains keep Hazed in romance impenetrably deep. Look, corn in stacks, on many a farm, And orchards ripe in languorous charm, As dreamy Nature, feeling sure Of all her genial labor done, And the last mellow fruitage won, Would idle out her term mature; Reposing like a thing reclined In kinship with man's meditative mind. For me, within the brown arcadeâ Rich life, methought; sweet here in shade And pleasant abroad in air!âBut, nay, A counter thought intrusive played, A thought as old as thought itself, And who shall lay it on the shelf!â I felt the beauty bless the day In opulence of autumn's dower; But evanescence will not stay! A year ago was such an hour, As this, which but foreruns the blast Shall sweep these live leaves to the dead leaves past. All dies!â I stood in revery long. Then, to forget death's ancient wrong, I turned me in the deep arcade, And there by chance in lateral glade I saw low tawny mounds in lines Relics of trunks of stately pines Ranked erst in colonnades where, lo! Erect succeeding pillars show! All dies! and not alone The aspiring trees and men and grass; The poet's forms of beauty pass, And noblest deeds they are undone Even truth itself decays, and lo, From truth's sad ashes fraud and falsehood grow. All dies! The workman dies, and after him, the work; Like to these pines whose graves I trace, Statue and statuary fall upon their face: In very amaranths the worm doth lurk, Even stars, ChaldÃ¦ans say, have left their place. Andes and Apalachee tell Of havoc ere our Adam fell, And present Nature as a moss doth show On the ruins of the Nature of the Ã¦ons of long ago. But lookâand hark! Adown the glade, Where light and shadow sport at will, Who cometh vocal, and arrayed As in the first pale tints of mornâ So pure, rose-clear, and fresh and chill! Some ground-pine sprigs her brow adorn, The earthy rootlets tangled clinging. Over tufts of moss which dead things made, Under vital twigs which danced or swayed, Along she floats, and lightly singing: âDies, all dies! The grass it dies, but in vernal rain Up it springs and it lives again; Over and over, again and again It lives, it dies and it lives again. Who sighs that all dies? Summer and winter, and pleasure and pain And everything everywhere in God's reign, They end, and anon they begin again: Wane and wax, wax and wane: Over and over and over amain End, ever end, and begin againâ End, ever end, and forever and ever begin again!â She ceased, and nearer slid, and hung In dewy guise; then softlier sung: âSince light and shade are equal set And all revolves, nor more ye know; Ah, why should tears the pale cheek fret For aught that waneth here below. Let go, let go!â With that, her warm lips thrilled me through, She kissed me, while her chaplet cold Its rootlets brushed against my brow, With all their humid clinging mould. She vanished, leaving fragrant breath And warmth and chill of wedded life and death.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">UNPUBLISHED OR UNCOLLECTED POEMS EPISTLE TO DANIEL SHEPHERD To Daniel Shepherd: Come, Shepherd, come and visit me: Come, we'll make it Arcady; Come, if but for charity. Sure, with such a pastoral name, Thee the city should not claim. Come, then, Shepherd, come away, Thy sheep in bordering pastures stray. Come, Daniel, come and visit me: I'm lost in many a quandary: I've dreamed, like Bab'lon's Majesty: Prophet, come expound for me. âI dreamed I saw a laurel grove, Claimed for his by the bird of Jove, Who, elate with such dominion, Oft cuffed the boughs with haughty pinion. Indignantly the trees complain, Accursing his afflictive reign. Their plaints the chivalry excite Of churlishness, a plucky host: They battle with the bird of light. Beaten, he wings his Northward flight, No more his laurel realm to boast, Where now, to crow, the cocks alight, Andâbreak down all the branches quite! Such a weight of friendship pure The grateful trees could not endure. This dream, it still disturbeth me: Seer, foreshows it Italy? But other visions stir my head; No poet-problems, fancy-fedâ Domestic prose of board and bed. I marvel oft how guest unwined Will to this farm-house be resigned. Not a hint of ruby claret Cooleth in our cellar-bin; And, ripening in our sultry garret, Otard glows no flask within. (Claret and otard here I name Because each is your fav'rite flame: Placed 'tween the two decanters, you, Like Alexander, your dear charmers view, And both so fair you find, you neither can eschew: âThat's what they call an Alexandrine; Don't you think it very damn'd fine?) âBrackets serve to fence this prattle, Pound for episodic cattle.â I said that me the Fates do cripple In matter of a wholesome âtipple.â Now, is it for oft cursing gold, For lucre vile, The Hags do thus from me withold Sweet Bacchus' smile? Smile, that like other smiles as mellow, Not often greets Truth's simple fellow:â For why? Not his the magic Dollar? You should know, you Wall-Street scholar! âOf Bourbon that is rather new I brag a fat black bottle or two,â Shepherd, is this such Mountain-Dew As one might fitly offer you? But if cold water will content ye My word, of that ye shall have plenty. Thanks to late floods, our spring, it brims,â Will't mind o'crunch of goblet-rims? âI've told some doubts that sadly pose me: Come thou now, and straight resolve me. Come, these matters sagely read, Daniel, of the prophet breed. Daniel Shepherd, come and roveâ Freely rove two fally dells; The one the Housatonic clove, And that where genial Friendship dwells. INSCRIPTION FOR THE SLAIN AT FREDERICKSBURGH A glory lights an earnest end; In jubilee the patriot ghosts ascend. Transfigured at the rapturous height Of their passionate feat of arms, Death to the brave's a starry night,â Strown their vale of death with palms. THE ADMIRAL OF THE WHITE Proud, O proud in his oaken hall The Admiral walks to-day, From the top of his turreted citadel French colors 'neath English play.â Why skips the needle so frolic about, Why danceth the ship so to-day? Is it to think of those French Captains' swords Surrendered when ended the fray? O well may you skip, and well may you dance, You dance on your homeward way; O well may you skip and well may you dance With homeward-bound victors to-day. Like a baron bold from his mountain-hold, At night looks the Admiral forth: Heavy the clouds, and thick and dun, They slant from the sullen North. Catching at each little opening for life, The moon in her wane swims forlorn; Fades, fades mid the clouds her pinched paled face Like the foeman's in seas sinking down. Tack off from the land! And the watch below Old England the oak-crownd to drink:â Knock, knock, knock, the loud billows go, Rapping âBravo my boys!â ere they sinkâ Knock, knock, knock, on the windward bow; The Anvil-Head Whale you would think. Tis Saturday night,âthe last of the week, The last of the week, month, and yearâ On deck! shout it out, you forecastle-man, Shout âSail ho, Sail hoâthe New Year!â Drink, messmates, drink; tis sweet to think Tis the last of the week, month, and year, Then perils are past, and Old England at last, Though now shunned, in the morn we will near; We've beaten the foe, their ship blown below, Their flags in St. Paul's Church we'll rear. Knock, knock, knock, the loud billows goâ God! what's that shouting and roar? Breakers!âclose, close ahead and abeam: She strikesâknock, knockâwe're ashore! Why went the needle so trembling about, Why shook you, and trembled to-day? Was it, perchance, that those French Captains' swords In the arm-chest too near you lay? Was it to think that those French Captains' swords, Surendered, might yet win the day? O woe for the brave no courage can save, Woe, woe for the ship led astray. High-beetling the rocks below which she shocks, Her boats they are stove by her side, Fated seas lick her round, as in flames she were bound, Roar, roar like a furnace the tide. O jagged the rocks, repeated she knocks, Splits the hull like a cracked filbert there, Her timbers are torn, and ground-up are thrown, Float the small chips like filbert-bits there. Pale, pale, but proud, 'neath the billows loud, The Admiral sleeps to night; Pale, pale, but proud, in his sea-weed shroud,â The Admiral of the White: And by their gun the dutiful ones, Who had fought, bravely fought the good fight. TO TOM Thou that dost thy Christmas keep Lonesome on the torrid deep, But in thy âMeteorâ proudly sweep O'er the waves that vainly combâ Of thee we think, To thee we drink, And drain the glass, my gallant Tom!

To whom one Christmas may not come,â Of thee I think Till on its brink The glass shows tears, beloved Tom! SUGGESTED BY THE RUINS OF A MOUNTAIN-TEMPLE IN ARCADIA, ONE BUILT BY THE ARCHITECT OF THE PARTHENON Like stranded ice when freshets die These shattered marbles tumbled lie: They trouble me. What solace?âOld in inexhaustion, Interred alive from storms of fortune, The quarries be! PUZZLEMENT AS TO A FIGURE LEFT SOLITARY ON A UNIQUE FRAGMENT OF GREEK BASSO-RILIEVO A crescent browâa quiver thrown Behind the shoulder. A huntress, own. It needs be Artemis. But, nay, It breathes too much of Eve's sweet way, And Artemis is high, austere, Chill as her morn, a goddess mere. She bends, and with one backward hand Adjusts her buskin light, The sidelong face upturnedâhow arch! Sure, somebody meets her sight. But never virgin on another Virgin, or approaching brother Turned a look like that, I wis. Profane, if meant for Artemis! Why, could one but piece out the stoneâ Complete restore its primal state, Some handsome fellow would be shown, Some Laon she would fascinate By that arch look.â Nayâcan it be? Again methinks 't is Artemis. Rogue of a Greek! and is it she? Show'st thou the goddess, human yetâ The austere Artemis a coquette? If so in sooth, some latter age In faith's decay begot thine artâ Such impudence of sweet persiflage! THE CONTINENTS From bright Stamboul Death crosses o'er; Beneath the cypress evermore His camp he pitches by the shore Of Asia old.

Over the gulf the yearning starts To meetâinfold! THE DUST-LAYERS Abreast through town by Nile they go With water-skins the dust to lay, A soggy set in sorry row Squeezing their skins in bag-pipe way. With droning rhyme that times the twitch They squirt the water, squirt and switch In execrable play! Osiris! what indignity, In open eye of day, Offered the arch majesty Of Thotmes passed away; The atoms of his pomp no prouder Than to be blown about in powder, Or made a muddy clay! A RAIL ROAD CUTTING NEAR ALEXANDRIA IN 1855 Plump thro' tomb and catacomb Rolls the Engine ripping; Egypt's ancient dust This before the gust, The Pyramid is slipping! Too long inurned, Sesostres's spurned, What glory left to Isis Mid loud acclaim to Watts his name Alack for Miriam's spices! A REASONABLE CONSTITUTION What though Reason forged your scheme? 'Twas Reason dreamed the Utopia's dream: 'Tis dream to think that Reason can Govern the reasoning creature, man. RAMMON In touching upon historical matters the romancer and poet have generously been accorded a certain license, elastic in proportion to the remoteness of the period embraced and consequent incompleteness and incertitude of our knowledge as to events, personages, and dates. It is upon this privilege, assumed for granted, that I here venture to proceed. Rammon, not mentioned in canonic Scripture, the unrobust child of Solomon's old age and inheriting its despondent philosophy, was immoderat[e]ly influenced thereby. Vanity of vanitiesâsuch is this life. As to a translated life in some world hereafterâfar be that thought! A primary law binds the universe. The worlds are like apples on the tree; in flavor and tint one apple perchance may somewhat differ from another, but all partake of the same sap. One of the worlds we know. And what find we here? Much good, a preponderance of good; that is, good it would be could it be winnowed from the associate evil that taints it. But evil is no accident. Like good it is an irremovable element. Bale out your individual boat, if you can, but the sea abides. To Rammon then cessation of being was the desirable event. But desired or not, an end or what would seem to [be] an end, does come. Here he would have restedârested but for Buddha[.] Solomon a very lax Hebrew did not altogether repell foreign ideas. It was in his time that reports of Buddha and the Buddhistic belief had, along with the recorded spices and pearls, been conveyed into Palestine by that travelled and learned Indian dame, not less communicative than inquisitive, the Princess of Sheba[.] Through her it was that the doctrine of the successive transmigration of souls came to circulate, along with legends of Ashtaroth and Chemosh, among a people whose theocratic lawgiver was silent as to any life to come. A significant abstention; and serving the more to invest with speculative novelty Budd[h]a's affirmative scheme. But profound doctrines not directly imparted by miracle, but through many removes and in end through the sprightly chat of a clever queen, though naturally enough they might supply a passing topic for the amateur of thought, yet in any vital way they would scarcely affect but the exceptionally few. This applies to Rammon. But the wonderful conceptions of Princeâ[Siddhata?] were backed by something equally marvelous, his personality and life. These singularly appealed to Rammon also born a Prince, and conscious, too, that rank had not hardened his heart as to the mass of mankind, toilers and sufferers, nor in any wise intercepted a just view of the immense spectacle of things. But, in large, his thought of Buddha partook of that tender awe with which long after Rammon's time, the earlier unconventional Christians were impressed by the story and character of Christ. It was not possible for him therefore to deem unworthy regard any doctrine however repugnant to his understanding and desire, authentically ascribed to so transcendent a nature. Besides: If Budd[h]a['s] estimate of this present life confirms, and more than confirms, Solomon my wise father's view, so much the more then should a son of his attend to what Buddha reveals or alleges touching an unescapable life indefinitely continuous after death. Rammon was young; his precocious mind eagerly receptive; in practical matters the honesty of his intel[l]ect in part compensated for his lack of experience and acquired knowledge. Nevertheless he had no grounding in axiomatic matters of the first consequence in passing judgement upon those vast claims, sometimes made as from heaven itself, upon the credence of man. Moreover, in connection with Buddha it had never occurred to him as a conjecture, much less as a verity that the more spiritual, wide-seeing, conscientious and sympathetic the nature, so much the more is it spiritually isolationed, and isolation is the mother of illusion. Lost between reverential love for Buddha's person and alarm at his confused teaching, (like all teaching alike unprovable and irrefutable) and with none to befriend &amp; enlighten him, there was no end to the sensitive Prince's reveries &amp; misgivings. He was left the more a prey to these disquietudes inasmuch as he took no part in public affairs. And for this reason. Upon the accession of Rehoboam his half-brother, troubles began, ending in the permanent disruption of the kingdom, a calamity directly traceable to the young king['s] disdain of the counsel of [i.e. and] advice of his father's councillors, and leaning to flatterers of his own age and arrogance of ignorance. The depressing event confirmed Rammon in his natural bias for a life with men. What avails it now that Solomon my father was wise? Rehoboam succeeds. Such oscillations are not of a day. Why strive? Rehoboam is my brother. When the oil of coronation was not yet dry upon him, and repentant Jeroboam proffered his allegiance, only imploring that the king would not make his yoke grievous, and while the king had not yet determined the matter, I said to him, It is not wisdom to repulse a penitent. Jeroboam is [a] valorous, a mighty man. If you make him hopeless of lenity, he will stir up mischief, perchance a rebellion. When I said this much to the king my brother, without a word he turned on his heel. Then I foresaw what would come, and now I see it. But now as then, he held me for an imbecile. He surrounds himself with those natives he calls practical men. Why strive? And he withdrew to his meditations and abstractions. But an interruption not unwelcome occurred. Tho' the Hebrews were not disposed as a people to superfluous intercourse with the Gentile's races, yet in one instance they would seem to have made an exception. The commercial alliance, between Solomon and Hiram partook something of personal good feeling which radiating out, resulted in an international amity that for a period survived both monarchs. And so it came to pass that Tardi an importer of the coast[,] a versatile man, in reports for gifts other than the one popularly charting him, made a visit to the court in Jerusalem, a court still retaining something of the magnificence &amp; luxury introduced by the Son of Jethro the shepherd. News of the Tyrian's arrival reaches Rammon's retreat. It interests him. With a view of eliciting something bearing on those questions that were cease[lessly] agitating his heart, he effects a privy interview with the new-comer; thinking beforehand, My countrymen are stay-at-homes; whatsoever is extant in their thought is as contracted as their territory; but here comes an urbane stranger travelled intellectual,â Well, we shall see! For Tardi, he was struck with the pure-minded ingenuousness of Rammon born to a station not favorable to candor. He was interested, perhaps entertained, by his youth and ardor entangled in problems which he for his own part had never seriously considered, holding them not more abstruse than profitless. But humoring a Prince so amiable, affably he lends himself to Rammon's purpose. But it is not long before Rammon divines, that Tardi, exempt from popular errors tho he [was] endowed with knowingness far beyond his own, suave and fluent, so bright too and prepossessing, was in essential character little more than a highly agreeable man-of-the-world, and as such, unconsciously prepared to avert himself, in a light-hearted way, from entire segments of life and thought. A fair urn, beautifully sculptured, but opaque and clay. True, among other things he is a poet; a poet, of a sensuous relish for the harmonious as to numbers and the thoughts they embody and a magic facility in infusing that double harmony, makes a poet then Tardi is such, and it is not necessary for a poet to be a seer. With a passionate exclamation he breaks off the conference, and for diversion from his disappoint[ment] solicits a trial of the accomplished stranger's improvising gift. Let us attend the Prince &amp; Tardi at that point in their interview when after some general discussion as to the strange doctrine troubling the former, he takes up the one mainly disturbing him, and makes a heart-felt appeal. Who, friend that has lived, taking ampler view, Running life's chances, would life renew? Ay, Prince, but why fear? no use to dismay When turning to enter death's chamber of spell One waves back to life a good-natured farewell, Bye-bye, I must sleep. That's in Tyrian way. Not hereabouts very new. But, piercing our Siddata's comfortable [word,] Buddha, benign yet terrible, is heard: It is Buddha I love.â From his Ever-and-a-Day, friend, ravish me away! Fable me something that may solace or repayâ Something of your art. Well,âfor a theme? A Phoenician are you. And your voyages of Tyre From Ophir's far strand they return full of dream That leaps to the heart of the nearby desire. Fable me, then, those Enviable Isles Whereof King Hiram's tars used to tell; Now looms the dim shore when the land is ahead; And what the strange charm the tarrier beguiles Time without end content there to dwell. Ay, fable me, those enviable isles. DITTY OF ARISTIPPUS Noble gods at the board Where lord unto lord Light pushes the care-killing wine: Urbane in their pleasure, Superb in their leisureâ Lax easeâ Lax ease after labor divine! Golden ages eternal Autumnal, supernal, Deep mellow their temper serene: The rose by their gate Shall it yield unto fate? They are godsâ They are gods and their garlands keep green. Ever blandly adore them; But spare to implore them: They rest, they discharge them from time; Yet believe, light believe They would succor, reprieveâ Nay, retrieveâ Might but revellers pause in the prime. IN A NUTSHELL Take a reef, take a reef In your wisdom: be brief. Well thenâwell-a-day! Wag the world how it may, The knaves will be tricking And fools still be kicking And Grief, the sad thief Will forever Joy's pocket be picking! ADIEU Ring down! The curtain falls and ye Will go your ways. Yet think of me. And genie take what's genie given And long be happy under heaven.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POEMS FROM THE NOVELS From Mardi WE FISH We fish, we fish, we merrily swim, We care not for friend nor for foe: Our fins are stout, Our tails are out, As through the seas we go. Fish, Fish, we are fish with red gills; Naught disturbs us, our blood is at zero: We are buoyant because of our bags, Being many, each fish is a hero. We care not what is it, this life That we follow, this phantom unknown: To swim, it's exceedingly pleasant,â So swim away, making a foam. This strange looking thing by our side, Not for safety, around it we flee:â Its shadow's so shady, that's all,â We only swim under its lee. And as for the eels there above, And as for the fowls in the air, We care not for them nor their ways, As we cheerily glide afar! We fish, we fish, we merrily swim, We care not for friend nor for foe: Our fins are stout, Our tails are out, As through the seas we go. SONG OF THE PADDLERS (All.) Thrice waved on high, Our paddles fly: Thrice round the head, thrice dropt to feet: And then well timed, Of one stout mind, All fall, and back the waters heap! (Bow-Paddler.) Who lifts this chant? Who sounds this vaunt? (All.) The wild sea song, to the billows' throng, Rising, falling, Hoarsely calling, Now high, now low, as fast we go, Fast on our flying foe! (Bow-Paddler.) Who lifts this chant? Who sounds this vaunt? (All.) Dip, dip, in the brine our paddles dip, Dip, dip, the fins of our swimming ship! How the waters part, As on we dart; Our sharp prows fly, And curl on high, As the upright fin of the rushing shark, Rushing fast and far on his flying mark! Like him we prey; Like him we slay; Swim on the foe, Our prow a blow! (Bow-Paddler.) Who lifts this chant? Who sounds this vaunt? (All.) Heap back; heap back; the waters back! Pile them high astern, in billows black; Till we leave our wake, In the slope we make; And rush and ride, On the torrent's tide! DRINKING SONG Ha, ha, gods and kings; fill high, one and all; Drink, drink! shout and drink! mad respond to the call! Fill fast, and fill full; 'gainst the goblet ne'er sin; Quaff there, at high tide, to the uttermost rim:â Flood-tide, and soul-tide to the brim! Who with wine in him fears? who thinks of his cares? Who sighs to be wise, when wine in him flares? Water sinks down below, in currents full slow; But wine mounts on high with its genial glow:â Welling up, till the brain overflow! As the spheres, with a roll, some fiery of soul, Others golden, with music, revolve round the pole; So let our cups, radiant with many hued wines, Round and round in groups circle, our Zodiac's Signs:â Round reeling, and ringing their chimes! Then drink, gods and kings; wine merriment bring; It bounds through the veins; there, jubilant sings. Let it ebb, then, and flow; wine never grows dim; Drain down that bright tide at the foam beaded rim:â Fill up, every cup, to the brim! LIKE THE FISH Like the fish of the bright and twittering fin, Bright fish! diving deep as high soars the lark, So, far, far, far, doth the maiden swim, Wild song, wild light, in still ocean's dark. ROYAL IS THE ROSE Oh! royal is the rose, But barbed with many a dart; Beware, beware the rose, 'Tis cankered at the heart. Sweet, sweet the sunny down, Oh! lily, lily, lily down! Sweet, sweet, Verbena's bloom! Oh! pleasant, gentle, musky bloom! Dread, dread the sunny down; Lo! lily-hooded asp; Blooms, blooms no more Verbena; White-withered in your clasp. BE MERRY Be merry, oh men of Mondoldo, A maiden this night is to wed: Be merry, oh damsels of Mardi,â Flowers, flowers for the bridal bed. SEA BURIAL We drop our dead in the sea, The bottomless, bottomless sea; Each bubble a hollow sigh, As it sinks forever and aye. We drop our dead in the sea,â The dead reck not of aught; We drop our dead in the sea,â The sea ne'er gives it a thought. Sink, sink, oh corpse, still sink, Far down in the bottomless sea, Where the unknown forms do prowl, Down, down in the bottomless sea. 'Tis night above, and night all round, And night will it be with thee; As thou sinkest, and sinkest for aye, Deeper down in the bottomless sea. THE SONG Far off in the sea is Marlena, A land of shades and streams, A land of many delights. Dark and bold, thy shores, Marlena; But green, and timorous, thy soft knolls, Crouching behind the woodlands. All shady thy hills; all gleaming thy springs, Like eyes in the earth looking at you. How charming thy haunts, Marlena!â Oh, the waters that flow through Onimoo: Oh, the leaves that rustle through Ponoo: Oh, the roses that blossom in Tarma. Come, and see the valley of Vina: How sweet, how sweet, the Isles from Hina: 'Tis aye afternoon of the full, full moon, And ever the season of fruit, And ever the hour of flowers, And never the time of rains and gales, All in and about Marlena. Soft sigh the boughs in the stilly air, Soft lap the beach the billows there; And in the woods or by the streams, You needs must nod in the Land of Dreams. INVOCATION âAwake Rarni! awake Foloona! Awake unnumbered deities!â SMOKING SONG Care is all stuff:â Puff! Puff! To puff is enough:â Puff! Puff! More musky than snuff, And warm is a puff:â Puff! Puff! Here we sit mid our puffs, Like old lords in their ruffs, Snug as bears in their muffs:â Puff! Puff! Then puff, puff, puff, For care is all stuff, Puffed off in a puff.â Puff! Puff! FULL ROUND, FULL SOFT, HER DEWY ARMS My lord nodded, and Yoomy sang:â âFull round, full soft, her dewy arms,â Sweet shelter from all Mardi's harms!â âWhose arms?â cried Mohi. Sang Yoomy:â Diving deep in the sea, She takes sunshine along: Down flames in the sea, As of dolphins a throng. âWhat mermaid is this? cried Mohi. Sang Yoomy:â Her foot, a falling sound, That all day long might bound. Over the beach, The soft sand beach, And none would find A trace behind. A RAY OF THE MOON A ray of the moon on the dancing waves Is the step, light step of that beautiful maid: Mardi, with music, her footfall paves, And her voice, no voice, but a song in the glade. SONG OF ARMS Our clubs! our clubs! The thousand clubs of Narvi! Of the living trunk of the Palm-tree made; Skull breakers! Brain spatterers! Wielded right, and wielded left; Life quenchers! Death dealers! Causing live bodies to run headless! Our bows! our bows! The thousand bows of Narvi! Ribs of Tara, god of War! Fashioned from the light Tola their arrows; Swift messengers! Heart piercers! Barbed with sharp pearl shells; Winged with white tail-plumes; To wild death-chants, strung with the hair of wild maidens! Our spears! our spears! The thousand spears of Narvi! Of the thunder-riven Moo-tree made: Tall tree, couched on the long mountain Lana! No staves for gray-beards! no rods for fishermen! Tempered by fierce sea-winds, Splintered into lances by lightnings, Long arrows! Heart seekers! Toughened by fire their sharp black points! Our slings! our slings! The thousand slings of Narvi! All tasseled, and braided, and gaily bedecked. In peace, our girdles; in war, our war-nets; Wherewith catch we heads as fish from the deep! The pebbles they hurl, have been hurled before,â Hurled up on the beach by the stormy sea! Pebbles, buried erewhile in the head of the shark: To be buried erelong in the heads of our foes! Home of hard blows, our pouches! Nest of death-eggs! How quickly they hatch! Uplift, and couch we our spears, men! Ring hollow on the rocks our war clubs! Bend we our bows, feel the points of our arrows: Aloft, whirl in eddies our sling-nets; To the fight, men of Narvi! Sons of battle! Hunters of men! Raise high your war-wood! Shout Narvi! her groves in the storm! QUACK! QUACK! QUACK! Quack! Quack! Quack! With a toorooloo whack; Hack away, merry men, hack away. Who would not die brave, His ear smote by a stave? Thwack away, merry men, thwack away! 'Tis glory that calls, To each hero that falls, Hack away, merry men, hack away! Quack! Quack! Quack! Quack! Quack! Quack! DEPARTED THE PRIDE, AND THE GLORY OF MARDI Departed the pride, and the glory of Mardi: The vaunt of her isles sleeps deep in the sea, That rolls o'er his corse with a hush. His warriors bend over their spears, His sisters gaze upward and mourn. Weep, weep, for Adondo is dead! The sun has gone down in a shower; Buried in clouds the face of the moon; Tears stand in the eyes of the starry skies, And stand in the eyes of the flowers; And streams of tears are the trickling brooks, Coursing adown the mountains.â Departed the pride, and the glory of Mardi: The vaunt of her isles sleeps deep in the sea. Fast falls the small rain on its bosom that sobs,â Not showers of rain, but the tears of Oro. HER BOWER IS NOT OF THE VINE Her bower is not of the vine, But the wild, wild eglantine! Not climbing a moldering arch, But upheld by the fir-green larch. Old ruins she flies: To new valleys she hies;â Not the hoar, moss-wood, Ivied trees each a roodâ Not in Maramma she dwells, Hollow with hermit cells. 'Tis a new, new isle! An infant's its smile, Soft-rocked by the sea. Its bloom all in bud; No tide at its flood, In that fresh-born sea! Spring! Spring where she dwells, In her sycamore dells, Where Mardi is young and new: Its verdure all eyes with dew. There, there! in the bright, balmy morns, The young deer sprout their horns, Deep-tangled in new-branching groves, Where the Red-Rover Robin roves,â Stooping his crest, To his molting breastâ Rekindling the flambeau there! Spring spring! where she dwells, In her sycamore dells:â Where, fulfilling their fates, All creatures seek matesâ The thrush, the doe, and the hare! HER SWEET, SWEET MOUTH! Her sweet, sweet mouth! The peach-pearl shell:â Red edged its lips, That softly swell, Just oped to speak, With blushing cheek, That fisherman With lonely spear On the reef ken, And lift to ear Its voice to hear,â Soft, sighing South! Like this, like this,â The rosy kiss!â That maiden's mouth. A shell! a shell! A vocal shell! Song-dreaming, In its inmost dell! Her bosom! Two buds half blown, they tell; A little valley between perfuming; That roves away, Deserting the day,â The day of her eyes illuming;â That roves away, o'er slope and fell, Till a soft, soft meadow becomes the dell. GOLD-HUNTERS We rovers bold, To the land of Gold, Over the bowling billows are gliding: Eager to toil, For the golden spoil, And every hardship biding. See! See! Before our prows' resistless dashes The gold-fish fly in golden flashes! 'Neath a sun of gold, We rovers bold, On the golden land are gaining; And every night, We steer aright, By golden stars unwaning! All fires burn a golden glare: No locks so bright as golden hair! All orange groves have golden gushings: All mornings dawn with golden flushings! In a shower of gold, say fables old, A maiden was won by the god of gold! In golden goblets wine is beaming: On golden couches kings are dreaming! The Golden Rule dries many tears! The Golden Number rules the spheres! Gold, gold it is, that sways the nations: Gold! gold! the center of all rotations! On golden axles worlds are turning: With phosphorescence seas are burning! All fire-flies flame with golden gleamings: Gold-hunters' hearts with golden dreamings! With golden arrows kings are slain: With gold we'll buy a freeman's name! In toilsome trades, for scanty earnings, At home we've slaved, with stifled yearnings: No light! no hope! Oh, heavy woe! When nights fled fast, and days dragged slow. But joyful now, with eager eye, Fast to the Promised Land we fly: Where in deep mines, The treasure shines; Or down in beds of golden streams, The gold-flakes glance in golden gleams! How we long to sift, That yellow drift! Rivers! Rivers! cease your going! Sand-bars! rise, and stay the tide! 'Till we've gained the golden flowing; And in the golden haven ride! HALF-VEILED ABOVE THE HILLS, YET ROSY BRIGHT Half-veiled above the hills, yet rosy bright, Stands fresh, and fair, the meek and blushing morn! So Yillah looks! her pensive eyes the stars, That mildly beam from out her cheek's young dawn! But the still meek Dawn, Is not aye the form Of Yillah nor Morn! Soon rises the sun, Day's race to run: His rays abroad, Flash each a sword,â And merrily forth they flare! Sun-music in the air! So Yillah now rises and flashes! Rays shooting from out her long lashes,â Sun-music in the air! Her laugh! How it bounds! Bright cascade of sounds! Peal after peal, and ringing afar,â Ringing of waters, that silvery jar, From basin to basin fast falling! Fast falling, and shining, and streaming:â Yillah's bosom, the soft, heaving lake, Where her laughs at last dimple, and flake! Oh, beautiful Yillah! Thy step so free!â Fast fly the sea-ripples, Revealing their dimples, When forth, thou hi'st to the frolicsome sea! All the stars laugh, When upward she looks: All the trees chat In their woody nooks: All the brooks sing; All the caves ring; All the buds blossom; All the boughs bound; All the birds carol; And leaves turn round, Where Yillah looks! Light wells from her soul's deep sun Causing many toward her to run! Vines to climb, and flowers to spring; And youths their love by hundred's bring! MAD SONG Stars laugh in the sky: Oh fugle-fi! The waves dimple below: Oh fugle-fo! THE ISLES HOLD THEE NOT, THOU DEPARTED! The isles hold thee not, thou departed! From thy bower, now issues no lay:â In vain we recall perished warblings: Spring birds, to far climes, wing their way! PADDLER'S SONG Ho! merrily ho! we paddlers sail! Ho! over sea-dingle, and dale!â All fire-flies flame with golden gleamings! Our pulses fly, Our hearts beat high, Ho! merrily, merrily ho! HAIL! VOYAGERS, HAIL! Hail! voyagers, hail! Whence e'er ye come, where'er ye rove, No calmer strand, No sweeter land, Will e'er ye view, than the Land of Love! Hail! voyagers, hail! To these, our shores, soft gales invite: The palm plumes wave, The billows lave, And hither point fix'd stars of light! Hail! voyagers, hail! Think not our groves wide brood with gloom; In this, our isle, Bright flowers smile: Full urns, rose-heaped, these valleys bloom. Hail! voyagers, hail! Be not deceived; renounce vain things; Ye may not find A tranquil mind, Though hence ye sail with swiftest wings. Hail! voyagers, hail! Time flies full fast; life soon is o'er; And ye may mourn, That hither borne, Ye left behind our pleasant shore. From Moby-Dick JONAH'S SONG The ribs and terrors in the whale, Arched over me a dismal gloom, While all God's sun-lit waves rolled by, And lift me deepening down to doom. I saw the opening maw of hell, With endless pains and sorrows there; Which none but they that feel can tellâ Oh, I was plunging to despair. In black distress, I called my God, When I could scarce believe him mine, He bowed his ear to my complaintsâ No more the whale did me confine. With speed he flew to my relief, As on a radiant dolphin borne; Awful, yet bright, as lightning shone The face of my Deliverer God. My song for ever shall record That terrible, that joyful hour; I give the glory to my God, His all the mercy and the power. WE'LL DRINK TO-NIGHT We'll drink to-night with hearts as light, To love, as gay and fleeting As bubbles that swim, on the beaker's brim, And break on the lips while meeting. From âUnder the Roseâ âSPECKS, TINY SPECKSâ âSpecks, tiny specks, in this translucent amber: Your leave, bride-roses, may one pry and see? How odd! a dainty little skeleton-chamber; Andâodder yetâsealed walls but windows be! Death's open secret.âWell, we are; And here comes the jolly angel with the jar!â From Piazza Tales OH, BROTHER JACK Oh Brother Jack, as you pass by As you are now, so once was I. Just so game and just so gay, But now, alack, they've stopped my pay. No more I peep out of my blinkers, Here I beeâtucked in with clinkers. From Billy Budd BILLY IN THE DARBIES Good of the Chaplain to enter Lone Bay And down on his marrow-bones here and pray For the likes just o' me, Billy Budd.âBut, look: Through the port comes the moon-shine astray! It tips the guard's cutlas and silvers this nook; But 'twill die in the dawning of Billy's last day. A jewel-block they'll make of me tomorrow, Pendant pearl from the yard-arm-end Like the ear-drop I gave to Bristol Mollyâ O, 'tis me, not the sentence they'll suspend. Ay, ay, all is up; and I must up too Early in the morning, aloft from alow. On an empty stomach now never it would do. They'll give me a nibble-but o'buiscit ere I go. Sure, a messmate will reach me the last parting cup; But, turning heads away from the hoist and the belay, Heaven knows who will have the running of me up! No pipe to those halyards.âBut aren't it all sham? A blur's in my eyes; it is dreaming that I am. A hatchet to my hawzer? all adrift to go? The drum roll to grog, and Billy never know? But Danter he has promised to stand by the plank; So I'll shake a friendly hand ere I sink. Butâno! It is dead then I'll be, come to think.â I remember Taff the Welshman when he sank, And his cheek it was like the budding pink. But me they'll lash me in hammock, drop me deep Fathoms down, fathoms down, how I'll dream fast asleep. I feel it stealing now, Sentry, are you there? Just ease this darbies at the wrist, and roll me over fair, I am sleepy, and the oozy weeds about me twist.</field>
