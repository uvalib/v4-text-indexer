      <field name="fulltext">“MOVE ON!” By the ragged hedge and straggling fence, Beneath the broken willow-tree, I sat, while Gipsies pitched their tents Around, and chaffed in Rommany. The children, who could hardly walk, Were sent to pick a bit of wood; Old Liz, so fierce in all her talk, Spoke as a little infant should. Ah! when old age grows young again— And such old age—it's strange to see; And stranger still to think there should Be baby-talk in Rommany. But, as the horses went to graze, And as the fire began to burn, Out of the lane, among the strays, Came our Inspector, grim and stern. “You know that this won't do,” he cried. “Be off, or I shall lock you up!” “If you do that,” old Liz replied, “Please lock me in a cookin' shop.” “Pack and be out of this forthwith! You know you have no business here!” “No; we hain't got,” said Samuel Smith, “No business to be Anywhere.” So wearily they went away, Yet soon were camped in t'other lane, And soon they laughed as wild and gay, And soon the kettle boiled again. And as they settled down below, I could but think upon the bliss 'Twould be to many men I know To move as lightly “out of this:”— Out of this life of morning calls, And weary work, and wasted breath; These prison cells of pictured walls, Where they are always “bored to death.” Bored by all kinds of cleverness, Bored by the beautiful and fair; By love, and joy, and tenderness; Or, if not bored, pretend they are. Oh, what a blessing it would be To hear some angel cry, “Be gone!” Some heavenly Inspector C., Who'd say, “Now none of this—Move on!” Charles G. Leland. It is perhaps almost needless to say that this is a sketch from life. I recall, however, that it was not a Smith, but one of the Matthews, who remarked to the Inspector that “We have no right to be anywhere.” Old Liz is the same Rommany who told me that she was sure the Shah was one of “the people.” THE REAL GIPSY. Oh! I'm a jolly Gipsy, and I roam the country round; I'm a real Petulengro as can anywhere be found: My uncle is a Chilcott, my mother is a Lee, But I'm the best of all of 'em, and real Rommany. A real Rommany From head to foot I be. Who-op! look into my peepers if a Gipsy you would see! I go to fairs and races, there I'm always to be found; One day across the country, then back upon the ground: One day I'm dressed up swelly, like the gentleman of course, Then the next I come the beggar, a holdin' of yer horse. “Just a threepence, sir. All right! For I held him jolly tight.” Who-op! I'm the boy as knows the way to run a horse—by night! When a cuttin' of my skewers, so peaceable I am, You'd say, “That Petulengro is the pattern of a lamb!” But I'm handy with my maulies, as I many a time have showed, An' can do for any traveller as goes upon the road. Oh! at fightin' I'm at home, Quick to dodge an' quick to come; For at hittin' or at shyin' I'm an out-an'-outer Rom! How are you, my sweet lady? how are you, my lord? I say: My wife'll take your money when she comes along this way. You'll want to give her something—just to keep away the cold— So I'll step round the corner while your fortune's bein' told. Then there'll be a patterin', An' an awful chatterin'! So I bid you all good evenin' till I come this way again. Charles G. Leland. THE PHOTOGRAPHER. “My master,” said the Gipsy man, “Is your prettygraph in your book? You ought to have seen it when mine was drawn, So that not a thing was mistook. “The fellow who took my landscape perfessed He'd make it the best in town; ‘Wery well,’ says I, ‘if you don't, I'm blessed If I gives you a single brown!’ “Now, I says to myself, ‘On my leather tights A dozen of buttons is sewn: A dozen he ought to give by rights, Hexceptin' the one as is gone.’ “But when that landskip was done so fair, I tell you, it took me down; For every one o' them buttons was there, Hexceptin' the one as was gone. “So I 'olds that chap is a honorable chap, As hever on earth I see; An when any one wants a prettygraph done, I sends 'em along to he.” Charles G. Leland. The incident embodied in this song was narrated to me in all seriousness by a Gipsy; and were it not for the rhyme and metre, I might say that it is here given almost in his words, “prettygraph” and “landskip” being used, under the impression that they were quite correct. THE WILFUL GIRL. So early on Christmas morning, No other sound was there, But bells far off a-ringing Through the silent frosty air. So early on Christmas morning, Between the dark and dawn, When the stars were going like pigeons, As the day like a hawk came on; I heard a noise in the forest, The voice of a wailing man; And then a rustling, crackling, As though a fire began. I hurried to the burning, And there upon a rock, Beside his blazing waggon, Sat the Gipsy Vester Lock. “Oh, have you buried your father? And, like a Rommany true, Are you burning up his waggon, As the real old Rommanis do? “Or is it your good old mother, Who looked in so many a hand? She will read no more the future Since she's gone to the future land.” “My father is still in London, And my mother is here,” said he. “This is burnt for a girl who is living, But dead for ever to me. “And whether she walk the South or West, Or live by East or North, That wicked girl is in her grave To me from this day forth. “Last week we were to marry, With a dinner and a ball; And our Rommany rye—you know him— Got it ready, and paid for all! “The rye was on the sofa, The priest was in his chair; We waited for Otchamé, But Otchamé was not there. “So it all broke up in sorrow, And we all went off in shame, (Though we stayed till dinner was over), Otchamé never came. “And I heard that she said she did it Because I loved her so, That for twice the trick and trouble I never would let her go. “We met, and she said she was sorry,— That I still should be her rom, And the next time to the wedding She would really be sure to come! “But I said: While there's dust on the highway, And water is in the sea, There will never be a wedding In the world between you and me. “If every hair of your ringlets Was a spangle of shining gold, I never would ask to marry A maiden so bad and bold. “If you had as many fingers As a hedgehog has pins to show, And all with rings close crowded, Whenever you came I'd go. “And because you have been so cruel, And served me such a turn, I've a waggon I meant to give you, And now that waggon I'll burn.” He wept, and among the people Who had stayed to hear him through, I saw a Gentile standing, And the Gentile was weeping too. And I asked him, “Is it the story Which causes the tears to rise? Or the smoke of the burning waggon That so affects your eyes?” He answered, “I'm not affected By the smoke nor by what he said; But I sold him that waggon on credit, And I know I shall never be paid.” No more he wasn't, and never, While water is in the sea, Will he ever get a copper From the heart-broken Rommany. Charles G. Leland. English Gipsies not only frequently burn or destroy all that belonged to their dead relations, but sometimes, when urged by strong emotions, make sacrifices like the one described in the foregoing ballad. It is all literally true, even to the remark as to the hairs of the head being spangles. The only liberty taken with the truth has been in making the unfortunate man from whom the waggon was purchased a weeping eye-witness. It is, however, a fact that this highly interesting sacrifice was entirely “upon tick.” I have omitted to state that the mortified lover also broke his watch to fragments; but, with some of the inconsistency characteristic of Gipsies, Indians, and other grown-up children, he carefully collected and sold the fragments, as well as the iron portions of the waggon. EGGS AND BACON. Oh! the eggs and bacon; And oh! the eggs and bacon; And the gentleman and lady A walking up the way! And if you will be my sweetheart, And if you will be my sweetheart, And if you will be my darling, I will be your own, to-day. Oh! I found a jolly hedgehog; Oh! I found a good fat hedgehog; Oh! I found a good big hedgehog, In the wood beyond the town: And there came the lord and lady, The handsome lord and lady, And underneath the branches I saw the two sit down. “Under the hedge at my ease I'll stay, Singing so jolly the livelong day. My horse is a Rommany, just like me, He's stealing the farmer's oats, you see. Cheer up, brother, never sorrow! Luck will come again to-morrow. “If you care for nothing, you needn't doubt But luck will come by and will find you out; For jolly good luck, as you well may see, Is a friend to the regular Rommany. Cheer up, brother, never sorrow, Luck will come again to-morrow.” Janet Tuckey. The incident here described is substantially the same as one narrated by an old Gipsy in Surrey as having occured to himself. In justice to the old man, it should be admitted that the theft of the donkey and horse is a poetic fiction. THE SONG OF STARVATION. “My children are hungry—bungry—wungry, They're dying of the bitter cold—diddle diddle dum. They haven't any victuals—skittles—tittles, They're perishing in poverty—tum teedle tum! My little tent's in tatters—hatters—scatters, All in rags a-flyin'—highin'—skyin'. The cold wind a-blowin'—lowin'—owin', All night I hear it whistle—sissel—diddle. All night we're a-cryin'—for a bit o' bread a-dyin'. My babes ha' got no mother—nor father—nother. Certainly I should die, but for my master standing by. I am poor—boor—oor! Diddle dum dum, dum dum, Diddle, dim—dam—dum, High diddle diddle.” Charles G. Leland. DOG-GIPSY. A Gipsy and a Gentile, A grandmother dark and wild, Five children, and an uncle— A half-blood poor and mild. But the chief was bold and haughty, And often declared to me, That no man in all the country Was so deep in their tongue as he. The crone, a dark old Gipsy, Seemed angry to hear me speak; The half-blood sported a stove-pipe, Stove-pipe or chimney-pot; a high hat. And I saw that the man was weak. But the chief looked proudly about him, And every motion said To the world, that all things worth knowing Were hidden in his great head. The half-blood was weaving a basket Of paper, quietly, Mere trifling, and as he wove it He glanced at the Rommany: At Mr Ayres the captain, Who lifted his head to say: “I'll tell you the deepest word now You ever heard in your day. “You may go from here to London, Wherever our tongue is heard; You may talk all England over, And never hear sitch a word: It's the very deeperest turn, Sir, There is in all Rommany: There's none but the Lord above us As knows o' that word—and me.” The grandmother looked angry, And gave him a hurried wink, As much as to say: “Don't tell it Before these Gentiles,—think!” But the half-breed gave me another, To do the best I could, But to certainly make an effort, For the credit of English blood. Said Mr Ayres the captain, And his voice came far from below; “Gurniaver's the word, my master, And if you can explain it—do!” The old woman's laugh was scornful, The half-breed glanced around Up into my eyes, inquiring, Then down upon the ground. “Gurniaver,” said Ayres the captain; “Gurniaver's the word. It's true You gents with your books knows something, But this here is ahead of you.” So we sat with our heads all bowing, And never a sound was heard; And we never uttered a whisper; We were crushed by that awful word! But Ayres, though great, was human, So he said politely, “Sir, This here is wot is the meanin'— G?rniáver's a cow-cumbér: For a g?rni's a cow in Gipsy, And áv, you know, is ‘come;’ And the two of 'em make cow-come-r, As certain as I'm a Rom!” Then we lifted our heads together To the linguist—all in a row; And the grandmother and the children, And the half-blood and I, cried, “Oh!” I never heard an utterance So deep and so earnest. No. I ween that the wood and water In that dell are still murmuring, “Oh!” Charles G. Leland. This incident, for which I am indebted to a friend, occurred precisely as it is told. It is not unusual for a simple-minded Gipsy to form, after long study, some extraordinary compound of words, or some translation of them from English, on the strength of which invention he patents himself as deep Rommany. Sometimes a Gipsy is the possessor of one “deep” word, which he imparts only as a great favour. J?kalo Romman?s, or Dog-Gipsy, is a term like “Dog-Latin.” It is applied to mis-applied words. Thus lel, signifying to take or get, would become decidedly j?kalo if one were to say lel avr? for “get out,” or lel up p?l?, apré the wárdo—“get up behind on the waggon.” “Mandy d?i” (i.e., I two), for I too, may be occasionally heard. The Old Professor, so frequently mentioned in “The English Gipsies,” on being asked the word for a daisy, suggested that “Spreadamengr?-adré-the-s?la-an'-pandamengro-adré-the-r?tti” would be a very good word—its literal meaning being “A spreading thing (or umbrella) in the morning, and a shutting-up thing at night.” My friend, to whom this was said, had suggested that, for want of a better word, daisy might be literally translated dívvusko y?k, but the Professor would not hear of this—it lacked the dignity and poetry of his own formidable epithet. THE STARS. “Tell me this, old friend, if you can tell it, What's the Rommany for stars in heaven?” “Yes, my master. Stars with us are sh?rkis, And from ch?riclis or birds, I take it. For the birds and stars are like in nature: Stars are only birds of light in heaven, Flying far above our heads for ever; Birds of fire which only fly in darkness: And the moon's the lady of the heavens, Coming nightly, certain in her coming, O'er the meadow, just to feed her chickens.” Charles G. Leland. Chirki, or shirki, a star in Rommany, may possibly have something in common with the Persian chirkh, meaning the sky, or chiragh, a lamp. The idea here expressed is given very nearly in the words of an old Gipsy. THE GIRL WHO LOVES ME WELL. I can tell you the name right down Of the prettiest things in all the town; But there isn't a thing the people sell So fine as the girl who loves me well. I sit in my Gipsy tent all day, And, “How are you all?” to the folk I say; But I'd sit for a year, and it's truth I tell, For a glimpse of the girl who loves me well. Oh, I'd like to be a lord, of course, And I'd like to have a hunting-horse; But the one and the other I'd gladly sell, For a kiss from the girl who loves me well. Charles G. Leland. This ballad is founded on no especial incident, but may be set down as Rommany, having met with a cordial reception among tent-Gipsies. THE POLICE. As I was going along the way, I saw the tracks where a Gipsy lay— Of a Gipsy fellow whom I did know, And the name of the man was Petulengro. And so I went on the road a bit, Till I came to the fire where I saw him sit; And he said to me, “Sarishan?”—“How do you do?” For a real Rom was Petulengro. “What luck for the day?” I asked, and he Said, “Wery bad luck,” again to me; “It's wery bad luck, that never will cease, And all along o' these here police. “If I pulls a bit of a stick from a hedge, There's a bobby a bobbin' along its edge; An' it's luck if I ain't in prison a piece, An' all along o' that 'ere police. “When I'm sound asleep in our little camp, The Pigs come down an' they make us tramp; They roots me out, and I gets no peace; For it's allers ‘Move on!’ with them 'ere police. “If my missus gets in a house, you know, To tell a bit of a fortin' or so, They scares her almost to her de-cease, For they're nat'ral devils, is them police. “I heard a fellow preachin' to me, As this is the land o' liberty: But I tells him my liberty is peace; An' there's none o' that there, where you has police. “Oh, I've had enough o' this land, I say, With its lords and parsons an' sitch as they; An' it's over the water I goes like geese, To a land where there isn't no police. “There you can tell a fortin' or so; There you can clear out the things, you know; There you are free as the blowin' breeze:— Hespesherly from them vile police. “The 'Merican land, I thinks, mayhap, Is just the spot for a Rommany chap; For from all I hears, there they lives at peace, An' the people don't care for no police. Charles G. Leland. This ballad was partly written one day while associating with Gipsies, and was drawn from their own remarks. THE LADY AND THE LORD. ENGLISH. The lady with her flowing hair Has covered her lover o'er. “There are men who wish to see me here Are hiding behind the door. What can we do together?— What canst thou do for me?” “I will not let thee go, my love, Though I lose my life for thee. Thou hast seven brothers. Though my heart Should leap upon their sword, Whilst thou art mine and I am thine I ever will keep my word.” Charles G. Leland. THE WITCH. We went one day to a farmer's house: His wife was so weak she could scarce arouse; But when she saw we were Rommany, She spoke to us very civilly, And said, with many a gasp and twitch: “I'm dying—and all of a wicked witch. “Look there! look there! It is coming now; The evil thing is dancing, I vow! My God! Oh, help me!”—and peeping in At the open door, with a wicked grin, Came a great grey toad, with a hop and a hitch; “See there!” cried the woman, “see—there's my witch! “Every day and hour it is coming here— The devilish creature is always near; If I throw it away, the first thing I see, It is jumping again and staring at me, All night I hear it hiss by the ditch, And all night long I dream of the witch.” Then we spoke together in Rommany, And told her at last how the thing must be: “If you have shears, just bring them here, And with them a cup of salt, my dear, And as sure as we're poor, and you are rich, The Gipsies will soon take care of the witch!” So we tied the shears like a cross, you see, And held the toad—and it couldn't get free— The charm was so strong—but it gave a cry— For it knew that its hour had come to die; In the fire with the shears we gave it a pitch, And she threw the salt on the burning witch. Then the lady gave us all a treat, Ale and bacon—plenty to eat, And a ten-shilling piece as we went away— Since people who work must get their pay; And it's good for all, be they poor or rich, If Gipsies come when they're plagued with a witch. C. G. L. One fine day in Epping Forest I met a very jolly young Gipsy woman, and held with her a conversation which was, however, hardly to be called cheerful, since it turned principally on toads and snakes, with their relations to witchcraft. In illustration of their evil-nature, she told me the story which I have repeated very accurately in the foregoing ballad. I have no doubt of its truth, but would state, in explanation, that toads take unaccountable fancies to certain places, and even to certain people, and that the Gipsies, who were well aware of this, ingeniously worked on the morbid fears and superstition of the sick woman. In fact, the Rommany chi, after telling the tale, mentioned incidentally that “people who live in the woods as we do, out of doors all the time, see and know a great deal about such creatures and their ways.” Not wishing to be outdone, I signified my cordial assent, and promptly narrated a story which I had found originally in a strange and striking little ballad by a well-known American poet, R. H. Stoddard. There was once an old Gipsy woman, a witch. One day a gentleman going along the road accidentally trod on a great toad and killed it. Hearing a scream at that instant some way off in the woods, and after that a terrible outcry, he followed up the sounds, and found that they came from a Gipsy camp, and were lamentations over the old witch's child, who had just died very suddenly. On looking at the little corpse, he was horrified to find that it presented every appearance of having been trampled to death. The simple credulity and awe expressed in the brown Gipsy face on hearing this little tale were as amusing as the puzzled look which succeeded them. She did not doubt the incident,—not in the least,—but inquired “how could it be?” —not being able to fathom the principle by which a soul could be in two places at once. I regret that I cannot report the discussion which probably ensued that night, around some fire, over this story, and the explanations given of it by the wiser and older fortune-tellers. It is not impossible that the next Rommany Rye or Gipsy-speaking gentleman who goes to Epping may, if he touch on the subject with due care, be told the name of the infant thus killed, and learn many interesting details of the subsequent effect of the bereavement on its mother. The word chóvih?n in this poem should be correctly translated wizard, and not witch; chovih?n? being the feminine. [The moon, soft-moving o'er the heaven] The moon, soft-moving o'er the heaven, My darling, seems like thee; And other folk are but the clouds That hide thy face from me. THE SHAH. “Yes, my master, I've seen the Shah,” Said old Dame Petulengro to me. “And I says to my son, ‘You needn't talk, For I know he's a bit of a Rommany.’ “I've seen all sorts of Gipsy folk, Our own and them from beyond the sea; I knows the eye, and I knows the walk: I tell you he's somehow a Rommany. “Other folks' eyes may be werry good eyes, I won't say never how that may be; But this I say, that that Persian rye's Have got the shine of the Rommany.” And as she talked in her Gipsy tongue, With just one Persian word in three, It seemed as if she couldn't be wrong, And the Shah were a bit of a Rommany. The incident here described is true, every expression having been accurately retained. No effort has been made to introduce Persian words in these lines, and it chances that the proportion of them is rather less here than usually occurs. The following, however, belong to that language: Avali, Persian bali; rye, Pers. ray; r?kker, Pers. rakídan; kush-ti, Pers. khush; shuned, Pers. shun-ídan; puri, Pers. pír; M? (prohibitative), Pers. ma; Gorgiko (from Gorgio), Pers. kh'ája, pronounced khorja. THE SEVEN NIGHT-WALKERS. Yes, my master, it's a queer old story, And it's many a year since last I heard it— Since I heard the good old father telling All about the Seven Night-Walking Spirits. Thus he told the story—thus I heard it: If you took an oath upon those spirits, And the oath upon them should be broken, Seven nights will come to you the walkers; Seven nights they'll come, each night to wake you; Seven nights you'll always see the seven; But upon the seventh night, my master, By the seventh spirit you'll be strangled. Round your neck the ghost will twine his fingers, Then upon your throat you'll feel them pressing: Then they pass away into the midnight.— But, my master, where could you have heard it? Charles G. Leland. And old Gipsy assured me that he had heard of the Seven Walkers, as described by Sir W. Scott in the oath sworn by the Rommany Hayraddin Maugrabin. Whether my informant was mistaken or not—and I do not think he would deceive me in Rommany matters—nothing is more likely than that such a superstition should have been preserved among Gipsies. THE GIFT. As I was going along the town, Came a clergyman, A very great man,— You know him by name, I'll bet a crown;— And preached like honey, Askin' for money: He wanted some For a Hospital Home; And I said: “If death ever should come to me, I'd like to die there—respectably.” So into my pocket my hand I poke, And out a silver shillin' I took, And dropped it in. The gent looked at me, And—“Thank you, sir, for your gift,” says he, To this here black-faced Rommany! It's a fact. He bowed himself, d'ye know, As gentlemen always to gentlemen do. Charles G. Leland. This was the account which a Gipsy gave me of an honour which he had received. In narrating the event, he acted it to life, with great spirit and intense satisfaction, ending with a profound bow, in imitation of the one bestowed on him by the clergyman. It may be worth recalling on Hospital Sunday that Old Windsor Cooper, the Gipsy, once gave his only shilling to the good cause. A HANGING MATTER. One morning in Epping Forest, Beside the alehouse door, I talked with the Gipsy Rosa, As I often had done before. When she whispered quick and softly: “Don't speak in Rommany, For there is a policeman, Who can hear as well as see.” “But if he hears us talking, He will not understand:”— “Why, don't you know, my master, It's against the law of the land? “I have heard it from my father, It may not be spoken or writ; And many have swung on the gallows For nothing but talking it. “And it's still down in the law-book, And was never struck out, d'ye see? They may swing you off the cross-beam For a talkin', much more for a writin' A book in the Rómmany. “And though you're a gentleman truly, Don't go in the way to be hung; For I say it's a hangin' matter, This talkin' the Rommany tongue.” Charles G. Leland. I do not know whether the laws passed in many European countries making it death to speak Rommany were also extended to England, or if so, whether they have been repealed. That the Gipsies themselves entertain the opinion that their language is forbidden, invariably manifests itself, even if talking it with gentlemen or ladies, when a policeman approaches. Many a time have I heard the rapidly spoken whispered warning: “M? r?kka Rómmanis, rýa—'dói vélla múscro! Don't talk Rommany, sir!—there comes a policeman!” More than once during my researches I have received such a kindly-meant warning.</field>
