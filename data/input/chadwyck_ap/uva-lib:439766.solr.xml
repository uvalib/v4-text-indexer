      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME I. APPREHENSION. “Oh! sister, he is so swift and tall, Though I want the ride, he will spoil it all, For, when he sets out, he will let me fall, And give me a bump, I know! Mamma, what was it I heard you say, About the world's hobbies, the other day, How some would get on and gallop away, To end with an overthrow?” “I said, little prattler, the world was a race, That many would mount with a smile on the face, And ride to their ruin, or fall in disgrace: That him, who was deaf to fear, And did not look out for a rein or a guide, His courser might cast on the highway side, In the mud, rocks and brambles, to end his ride, Perchance with a sigh and a tear!” “Oh! sister, sister! I fear to try; For Brutus's back is so live and high! It creeps at my touch—and he winks his eye— I'm sure he is going to jump! Come! dear mother, tell us some more About the world's ride, as you did before, Who helped it up—and all how it bore The fall, and got over the bump!” THE SUN-DIAL'S MATINS. Thou god of my worship, my early devotion I offer unmingled to thee! I live at thy coming; I go by thy motion; Thy presence is being to me! At eve, in the west when thy glories are sinking, And the spires and the hill tops have caught Thy parting embrace, then I feel myself sinking, To pass for awhile into nought. For man looks estranged, as he never had known me, Though late he believed me so true; And, darkness descending, the night will not own me, But loads me with umbrage and dew! The moon, a false queen! with reserve seems to chill me, Her beams are so distant and pale; The stars, changing glances, with twinkling would kill me, Should faith in my deity fail. But I feel on its axle the globe is revolving; And know with the morn I shall see Those mimics, so vain, in thy brightness dissolving, And nature rejoicing in thee. So, patient I wait, uncomplaining and fearless, Nor faint when thy face is withdrawn; For, never has night been so lengthened or cheerless, It has not been followed by dawn. I turn not to earth; for she ever has given Obscurity, vapor and dust; I ask not of self, but I look up to heaven For guidance, with hope and with trust. Though clouds oft have gathered to tempt or persuade me My god and my faith to deny, Thy beams, darting through them, have ever repaid me For placing my treasure on high. Then, hail to thy rising! bright god, in thy splendor! While glory is marking thy way, Darkness and damps their dominion surrender, And fly from the monarch of day! O light! thou art truth! though to me but diurnal, On thee my affections shall feed; And he, who will look in the Sun-Dial's journal, My life and its moral may read! THE LOOSE FEATHER. 'T is wandering down through pathless air, A lonely thing in a boundless space, That has lost its way, and knows not where To find a home, or a resting place. The fearless breast, where late 't was worn, Has met the arrow the foeman hurled; The venturous wing, by which 't was borne Through clouds, must soon in death be furled. Poor timorous thing! when it felt the dart, Where it peaceful lay, how it fluttered and fled; Nor staid till the blood of the eagle's heart, To sully and moisten its down, was shed! And now, as in careless sport, 't is tossed Above the stream by the whiffling wind! In the next swift wave 't will be curled and lost, Nor leave one trace of itself behind. So fly the joys that warm the breast, Where they in their downy lightness grew, When their only home and their native rest The shaft of sorrow is passing through. And what shall, again, the wounded heart And its vanished peace e'er bring together? Ah! sundered once, they must sink apart, Like the stricken bird and her falling feather! THE WHITE CLOUD. What next—what next, thou changeful thing, With the feathery breast and the silver wing, That seem'st, like a lonely bird, to fly To some distant home, o'er the clear blue sky? I saw thee suspended, a moment ago, By a hand unseen, like a wreath of snow, Withheld from a fall that might give it a stain So deep it could never be blanched again. And once thou hast shone in a cluster of flowers, Pure as if bent from the heavenly bowers, Defying this valley of shadow and blight To sully or wither their leaves of light! I 've seen thee, too, pass over my head, Like a beautiful ship with her sails all spread, That, laden with treasures too pure and bright For an earthly touch, or a mortal's sight, Was proud to some far-off port to bear Her viewless riches through seas of air! Again—thou hast seemed as the spirit of love His mantle had dropped from the realms above, And 't was floating along, as a sign, to show To those who should look from the world below, That their garments must be of a spotless white Before they can enter a world of light! Beautiful changeling! now—even now, I see thee dissolving, I know not how— Thine atoms are scattered, and, one by one, Melted and lost in the rays of the sun! Vapor deceitful! cloud of the morn! Like thee are the hopes that of earth are born! Their forms are varying, high and fair; But melted by light—rent in pieces by air! Bright vision of falsehood, thou shalt teach The soul, in her search for joys, to reach To a world of truth, where deceit is o'er— Where changes and clouds shall be known no more! THE GROUND LAUREL. Epigæa Repens. I love thee, pretty nursling Of vernal sun and rain; For thou art Flora's firstling, And leadest in her train. When far away I found thee, It was an April morn; The chilling blast blew round thee; No bud had decked the thorn. And thou alone wert hiding The mossy rocks between, Where, just below them gliding, The Merrimack was seen. And while my hand was brushing The seary leaves from thee, It seemed that thou wert blushing To be disclosed to me. So modest, fair and fragrant, Where all was wild and rude, To cheer the lonely vagrant Who crossed thy solitude,— Thou didst reward my ramble By shining at my feet, When, over brake and bramble, I sought thy lone retreat,— As some sweet flower of pleasure Upon our path may bloom, 'Mid rocks and thorns that measure Our journey to the tomb! TO THE MOURNER. We would not check the starting tear, Nor bid thee cease to mourn The friend thy bosom held most dear So early from thee torn; For, when in death a loved one slept, Among the sorrowing, “Jesus wept!” But has not Jesus passed the tomb, To break its bars away? And, darting through its fearful gloom The beams of endless day, Does he not, from the other side, Bid none to fear, since he has died? And, mourner, will not sighing cease, When thou canst look above, And feel that, from a world of peace, Thou hast an angel's love? That she is safe, where none may fear Death, pain, or change that wound us here? When he, who wept at human wo, Shall in the clouds appear, Awaking millions then shall know, To those who owned him here, He is the resurrection!—he, Life, light and immortality! THE FORTUNE-TELLER. How well I remember the hovel, that stood Beyond the green mead, in the skirt of the wood, For which, in my childhood, I turned from the road To visit the hag that within it abode; When, with ninepence, long treasured, so nobly I feed The wrinkled-browed Sybil, my fortune to read!— And how, though I 'd run, till my breath was nigh spent, When I came near the hut, I began to relent! For nightshade and hemlock grew under the eaves, And seemed to have “sorcery” writ on their leaves. When the feathery group gave their ominous shout, I thought of the chicks Mother Carey sent out! Then, there lay old Growler at length on the floor, And looked like the wicked one keeping the door; With eyes semi-closed, as inclining to sleep, But ope'd now and then, for an impious peep; And even the puss, as she dozed on the hearth, I thought had a spice of the witch from her birth. And when the brown seer her wonderful cup, With thick-settled tea-leaves, had whirled and turned up, I deemed, as she looked so sagacious within it, The end of my being was fixed from that minute; That if the least specks on its sides were deranged, 'T was over—my fortune forever was changed! With motion suspended, and speech wholly gone, In wonder and awe, as I stood and looked on, The few grizzled hairs, from her temples that strayed, Seemed turning to serpents, that hissed as they played, Defying the fillet to keep them in check, Across the deep seams of my oracle's neck. The thread of my life at that moment seemed hung, In its many-hued twist, from the tip of her tongue. And she opened her lips with such bright and fair things, That, my head all on fire, and my fancy on wings, I flew to my home, and retired to my bed, To gild my gay dreamings with all she had said. But years have since taught me how foolish and vain Was the “refuge of lies,” for a pitiful gain. Of the hut, or its inmate, no vestige is seen But the mound, where the prophetess sleeps on the green. My fortune—the path of my life has been made O'er flowers and o'er brambles—through sunshine and shade— So changeful and chequered, I would not be told, One hour, what the leaf of the next may unfold. While fearless I trust to a finger divine To point out my footsteps and mark every line, May I look above earth for a light to my mind, Till I leave superstition and error behind, And drop this short lesson to childhood and youth— “Shun falsehood!—love science, and seek only truth!” SONG OF THE BEES. We watch for the light of the morn to break, And color the eastern sky With its blended hues of saffron and lake, Then say to each other, “Awake! awake! For our winter's honey is all to make, And our bread for a long supply!” Then, off we hie to the hill and the dell, To the field, the meadow and bower. In the columbine's horn we love to dwell, To dip in the lily with snow-white bell, To search the balm in its odorous cell, The mint and the rosemary flower. We seek the bloom of the eglantine, Of the pointed thistle and brier; And follow the steps of the wandering vine, Whether it trail on the earth, supine, Or round the aspiring tree-top twine, And reach for a state still higher. As each, on the good of her sisters bent, Is busy, and cares for all, We hope for an evening with hearts content, For the winter of life without lament That summer is gone, with its hours misspent, And the harvest is past recall! THE CONQUEROR. There's blood on the laurel that wreathes his brow, And the death-cry delights his ear! The widow is wailing his victory now; And his meed is the orphan's tear. But the might of his arm shall lose its dread, For a mightier foe comes near! The plume will be stripped from the conqueror's head To wave o'er the conqueror's bier! Alone he must march to the terrible fight, For there is no army to save! His glory will set in an endless night, And his honors be hid in the grave. He must tread the darksome valley alone, Assailed by remorse and fear; Nor rod, nor staff help the traveller on; Nor is there a comforter near. He sinks! and none shall his requiem sound, Or sprinkle his turf with tears; His head with the clods of the vale is crowned, And a shroud is the buckler he wears. But who shall follow the fugitive home When his last great battle is o'er; Or sever the curtain that veils the doom Of a soul on an untried shore? THE SNOW-FLAKE. “Now, if I fall, will it be my lot To be cast in some lone, and lowly spot, To melt, and to sink unseen, or forgot? And there will my course be ended?” 'T was this a feathery Snow-Flake said, As down through measureless space it strayed, Or, as half by dalliance, half afraid, It seemed in mid air suspended. “Oh! no,” said the Earth, “thou shalt not lie Neglected and lone on my lap to die, Thou pure and delicate child of the sky! For thou wilt be safe in my keeping. But then, I must give thee a lovelier form— Thou wilt not be part of the wintry storm, But revive, when the sunbeams are yellow and warm, And the flowers from my bosom are peeping! “And then thou shalt have thy choice, to be Restored in the lily, that decks the lea, In the jessamine-bloom, the anemone, Or aught of thy spotless whiteness:— To melt, and be cast in a glittering bead, With the pearls, that the night scatters over the mead, In the cup where the bee and the fire-fly feed, Regaining thy dazzling brightness. “I'll let thee awake from thy transient sleep, When Viola's mild blue eye shall weep, In a tremulous tear; or, a diamond, leap In a drop from the unlocked fountain: Or, leaving the valley, the meadow and heath, The streamlet, the flowers and all beneath, Go up and be wove in the silvery wreath Encircling the brow of the mountain. “Or, wouldst thou return to a home in the skies! To shine in the Iris I'll let thee arise, And appear in the many and glorious dyes A pencil of sunbeams is blending! But true, fair thing, as my name is Earth, I'll give thee a new and vernal birth, When thou shalt recover thy primal worth, And never regret descending!” “Then I will drop,” said the trusting Flake; “But, bear it in mind, that the choice I make Is not in the flowers, nor the dew to wake; Nor the mist, that shall pass with the morning. For, things of thyself, they will die with thee; But those that are lent from on high, like me, Must rise, and will live, from thy dust set free, To the regions above returning. “And if true to thy word and just thou art, Like the spirit that dwells in the holiest heart, Unsullied by thee, thou wilt let me depart And return to my native heaven. For I would be placed in the beautiful Bow, From time to time, in thy sight to glow; So thou may'st remember the Flake of Snow, By the promise that God hath given!” THE BLACK AT CHURCH. God, is thy throne accessible to me— Me of the Ethiop skin? May I draw near Thy sacred shrine, and humbly bend the knee, While thy white worshippers are kneeling here? May I approach celestial purity, And not offend thee with my sable face? This company of saints, so fair to see, Behold! already shrink from the disgrace! Yet, in thine earthly courts, I'll gladly bow Behind my fellow-worms, and be denied Communion with them, will my Lord allow That I may come and touch his bleeding side? In that blest fount have I an equal claim To bathe, with all who wear the stain of sin? Or, is salvation by another name Than thine?—or, must the Ethiop change his skin? Thou art our Maker, and I fain would know If thou hast different seats prepared above, To which the master and the servant go To sing the praise of thine eternal love! There will my buyer urge the price of gold, Which here, for this uncomely clay he gave, That he my portion may appoint, and hold In bondage still, the helpless, trembling slave? Or, will the dearer ransom, paid for all, A Saviour's blood, impress me with the seal Of everlasting freedom from my thrall, And wash me white, and this crushed spirit heal? Then will I meekly bear these lingering pains, And suffer scorn, and be by man opprest, If at the grave, I may put off my chains, And thou wilt take me where the weary rest! THE LITTLE FOOT. My boy, as gently on my breast, From infant sport, thou sink'st to rest; And on my hand I feel thee put, In playful dreams, thy little foot, The thrilling touch sets every string Of my full heart to quivering; For, ah! I think, what chart can show The ways through which this foot may go? Its print will be, in childhood's hours, Traced in the garden, round the flowers; But youth will bid it leap the rills, Bathe in the dew on distant hills, Roam o'er the vales, and venture out When riper years would pause and doubt; Nor brave the pass, nor try the brink Where youth's unguarded foot may sink. But what, when manhood tints thy cheek, Will be the ways this foot will seek? Is it to lightly pace the deck, Helpless, to slip from off the wreck? Or wander o'er a foreign shore, Returning to thy home no more, Until the bosom now thy pillow, Is low and cold beneath the willow? Or, is it for the battle-plain, Beside the slayer and the slain? Will there its final step be taken? There, sleep thine eye no more to waken? Is it to glory or to shame— To sully, or to gild thy name? Is it to happiness or wo This little foot is made to go? But wheresoe'er its lines may fall, Whether in cottage or in hall, O, may it ever shun the ground Where'er his foot was never found, Who, on his path of life, hath shed A living light, that all may tread Upon his earthly steps; and none E'er dash the foot against a stone! Yet, if thy way is marked by fate, As, guilty, dark and desolate! If thou must float, by vice and crime, A wreck, upon the stream of time! Oh! rather than behold that day, I'd know this foot, in lightsome play, Would bound, with guiltless, infant glee, Upon the sod that sheltered me! THE WINDS. We come! we come! and ye feel our might, As we 're hastening on in our boundless flight, And over the mountains, and over the deep, Our broad, invisible pinions sweep, Like the spirit of liberty, wild and free! And ye look on our works, and own 'tis we; Ye call us the Winds; but can ye tell Whither we go, or where we dwell? Ye mark, as we vary our forms of power, And fell the forests, or fan the flower, When the hare-bell moves, and the rush is bent, When the tower's o'erthrown, and the oak is rent, As we waft the bark o'er the slumbering wave, Or hurry its crew to a watery grave; And ye say it is we! but can ye trace The wandering winds to their secret place? And, whether our breath be loud and high, Or come in a soft and balmy sigh, Our threatenings fill the soul with fear, Or our gentle whisperings woo the ear With music aërial, still, 't is we. And ye list, and ye look; but what do ye see? Can ye hush one sound of our voice to peace, Or waken one note, when our numbers cease? Our dwelling is in the Almighty's hand; We come and we go at his command. Though joy or sorrow may mark our track, His will is our guide, and we look not back: And if, in our wrath, ye would turn us away, Or win us in gentle airs to play, Then, lift up your hearts to him, who binds, Or frees, as he will, the obedient Winds. THE TRUNK FROM SEA. Strength of my strength! around me, lest I sink, Place thine Almighty arm, and bear me up; Lest I should faint, and thus refuse to drink, When thou, my Father, dost present the cup! This double trial of the heart and flesh How shall I stand, till thou the power supply? This fearful opening of the wound afresh How can I bear, with no physician by? I knew my son—I knew too well that he His dying pillow found upon the wave— I knew the solemn wailing of the sea Was still the dirge o'er his unfathomed grave! Yet, strange delusion!—worse than vain deceit! How oft to this weak fancy did it seem That still my child and I on earth should meet— That I'd been struggling through a troubled dream! For, when he last was folded to my heart, The tide of life in his young breast was high; I from his cheek have seen no rose depart; Have marked no lustre fading from his eye. But now, this awful speaker!—as the lid Slowly is raised, its bosom to unveil, Truth, like a bolt that in the cloud was hid, Bursts on my sight, and strikes my spirit pale. Here is the vesture!—here 's the faithful friend, Wrapped in deep silence, in its case of gold, Whose little hand was by him to the end; Nor rested till its master's hand was cold. Here is the seal, that all his letters bear; The chain—the gift that near his heart was worn. This—sad memorial! 't is a lock of hair, That from his head some careful hand hath shorn! And here 's the lamp that shone upon his way; God's everlasting Word, his trust and guide. It is the food that fed him day by day; The fountain that his draught of life supplied. It is the sacred casket whence he took The goodly pearl that in his crown is set; The radiant centre where he loved to look On justice, peace, and truth, and mercy met. To its pure Author every glowing line, That forms this hallowed book, he fondly traced. Thus o'er my soul pour in, O, light divine, And I will open where his mark is placed! 'T is at the Savior's tomb!—but here, instead Of the pale clay, are angels shining now! The grave is broken! for, behold! the dead Is risen, and sweetly asks, “Why weepest thou?” WHO IS MY NEIGHBOR? Who is thy neighbor?—see him stand, With sunken cheek and eye! Where hunger shows the empty hand Thy bounty can supply! Look where the widowed mother pines For what thou well canst spare; Where palsied age, in want, reclines, And see thy neighbor there! Behold him in the stranger, thrown Upon a foreign shore, Who, homeless, friendless, and alone, Is shivering at thy door! Go meet him in thine enemy, And good for evil pay; And bear in mind, for such as he, Thy Saviour bids thee pray. Go seek him in the dungeon's night, And comfort there impart; Implore the smile of Heaven to light That desolated heart. Look where the son of Afric sighs For rights enjoyed by thee; He is thy neighbor!—loose his ties, And set the captive free! Columbia, favored of the skies! How can thy banner wave, While at thy feet thy neighbor lies A crushed and fettered slave? There is a blot among its stars; A stain upon thy hand; A mark upon thy face, that mars The beauty of our land. Thou, noble tree of liberty, Should not thy verdure fade O'er him, who would his neighbor see Excluded from thy shade? Did they, who reared thee by their toil, Not will thy fruit to be, Alike for all, who tread thy soil, A harvest sweet and free? WHAT IS THIS? Am I dreaming? What is this? Is it anguish?—is it bliss? 'T is a mingling of the twain; Doubtful joy and certain pain; Feeble gleams of morning light Playing through the shades of night, Ah! the same unconscious wing Wafts the honey and the sting! Quickly passing from the view Of the mind, that 's fleeting too, What a vast and varied crowd! Bridal vesture; funeral shroud; Robes of honor; weeds of wo; Oh! the wearers—how they go! Scarce a glimpse of each is caught, Ere the vision turns to nought. Well; and is there nothing more, When the busy dream is o'er? Ay; 't is truth the waking brings; 'T is a world of real things;— Nothing transient, nothing mixed; All is clear, and all is fixed. Be it anguish, be it bliss, 'T is no changing scene like this. Then, thou slumbering soul, awake! Let these earthly baubles break! Let the mildew blight the tree! Here 's no fruit to nourish thee. Up! and from the ruins haste; Look not back upon the waste! Up! and fasten on the prize, That is offered from the skies. THE FROST. The Frost looked forth one still, clear night, And whispered, “Now I shall be out of sight; So through the valley and over the height In silence I'll take my way. I will not go on like that blustering train— The wind and the snow, the hail and the rain, Who make so much bustle and noise in vain; But I'll be as busy as they.” Then he flew to the mountain, and powdered its crest; He lit on the trees, and their boughs he drest In diamond beads; and over the breast Of the quivering lake he spread A coat of mail, that it need not fear The downward point of many a spear, That he hung on its margin, far and near, Where a rock could rear its head. He went to the windows of those, who slept, And over each pane, like a fairy, crept; Wherever he breathed, wherever he stepped, By the light of the morn, were seen Most beautiful things; there were flowers and trees; There were bevies of birds, and swarms of bees; There were cities with temples and towers; and these All pictured in silver sheen! But he did one thing that was hardly fair— He peeped in the cupboard, and finding there, That all had forgotten for him to prepare, “Now, just to set them a-thinking, I'll bite this basket of fruit,” said he, “This costly pitcher I'll burst in three; And the glass of water they've left for me Shall ‘tchick!’ to tell them I'm drinking!” THE SCAR OF LEXINGTON. With cherub smile the prattling boy, Who on the veteran's breast reclines, Has thrown aside his favorite toy, And round his tender finger twines Those scattered locks, that with the flight Of fourscore years are snowy white; And, as a scar arrests his view, He cries, “Grand-Pa', what wounded you?” “My child, 't is five and fifty years This very day, this very hour, Since from a scene of blood and tears, Where valor fell by hostile power, I saw retire the setting sun Behind the hills of Lexington; While pale and lifeless on the plain My brothers lay, for freedom slain! “And ere that fight, the first that spoke In thunder to our land, was o'er, Amid the clouds of fire and smoke I felt my garments wet with gore! 'T is since that dread and wild affray, That trying, dark, eventful day From this calm April eve so far, I wear upon my cheek the scar. “When thou to manhood shalt be grown, And I am gone in dust to sleep, May freedom's rights be still thine own, And thou and thine in quiet reap The unblighted product of the toil In which my blood bedewed the soil! And, while those fruits thou shalt enjoy, Bethink thee of this scar, my boy. “But, should thy country's voice be heard To bid her children fly to arms, Gird on thy Grandsire's trusty sword; And, undismayed by war's alarms, Remember, on the battle-field, I made the hand of God my shield: And, be thou spared, like me, to tell What bore thee up, while others fell.” THE STORM. Wild are the winds! the heavens are dark! And he is out on a pathless deep: Who will manage the weltering bark? Who o'er him will the night-watch keep? God of the ocean, earth and air, Over the high and perilous wave Carry him safe, for thou art there— Thine eye is watching; thine arm can save! Author of light, the skies unveil, That the shining hosts, from their lofty arch, May again beam down on his wandering sail, As in glory they move on their nightly march. When he has closed his weary eyes, Lulled by the billows that harmless roll, Visions of bliss and beauty, rise In flowery dreams to the waking soul! But who shall dream, till the storm is past? Who 'mid the elements' war shall sleep? Spirit of mercy, hold him fast; For he is out on an angry deep! THE BROKEN-HEARTED. She braided a wreath for her silken hair, And kindled a smile on her sad, pale face; For a secret hand had been writing there, In lines that sorrow alone could trace! She gave a check to the rising sigh, And sent it again at its source to swell; While she turned to dash from her tearful eye A glittering drop, that her tale might tell. Her foot in the dazzling hall was found, As lightly the maze of the dance to thread, While, sportive, she moved to the viol's sound, As if not a hope of her heart had fled! Yet she wished, ere a rose in her wreath should die, Or the smile on her lip should cease to play, Her head on the pillow of death might lie, And the suffering chords of her heart give way! But she poured no plaint in an earthly ear; Her soul with its secret griefs went up, Beseeching her God that he would hear— Withdraw the bitter, or break the cup! Her prayer was heard, and the sigh was stilled, As if in her breast it ne'er had been! The tear, ere it sprang to her eye, was chilled; And the lids forever had locked it in! I bent o'er her pale and breathless clay, As it shone in the light, like a frozen flower, That stands in the air of a winter's day, Ere a leaf has drooped at the sunbeam's power! 'T was wrapped in a sweet and holy calm, That bade each shadow of grief depart! The spirit had risen to breathe the balm, Which Gilead sheds for the pure in heart! A VOICE FROM MOUNT AUBURN. A voice from Mount Auburn! a voice!—and it said, “Ye have chosen me out as a home for your dead; From the bustle of life ye have rendered me free; My earth ye have hallowed—henceforth I shall be A garden of graves, where your loved ones shall rest! O, who will be first to repose on my breast? “I now must be peopled from life's busy sphere; Ye may roam, but the end of your journey is here. I shall call! I shall call! and many will come From the heart of your crowds to so peaceful a home; The great and the good, and the young and the old, In death's dreamless slumbers, my mansions will hold. “To me shall the child his loved parent resign; And, mother, the babe at thy breast must be mine! The brother and sister for me are to part, And the lover to break from each tie of the heart. I shall rival the bridegroom and take from his side, To sleep in my bosom, his beautiful bride. “And sweetly secure from all pain they shall lie, Where the dews gently fall and the streams ripple by; While the birds sing their hymns, amid air-harps, that sound Through the boughs of the forest-trees whispering around. And flowers, bright as Eden's, at morning shall spread, And at eve drop their leaves o'er the slumberer's bed! “But this is all earthly! While thus ye enclose A spot where your ashes in peace may repose— Where the living may come and commune with the dead, With God and his soul, and with reverence tread On the sod, which he soon may be sleeping below,— Have ye chosen the home where the spirit shall go? “Shall it dwell where the gardens of Paradise bloom, And flowers are not opening to die on the tomb? With the song of an angel, a vesture of light, Shall it live in a world free from shadow and blight; Where the waters are pure, from a fount never-sealed, And the secrets of heaven are in glory revealed? “A day hastens on,—and an arm shall then break The bars of the tomb—the dread trump shall awake The dead from their sleep in the earth and the sea, And, ‘Render up thine!’ shall be sounded to me! Prepare for that hour, that my people may stand, Unawed by the scene, at the Judge's right hand!” THE SOLDIER TO HIS PLUME. Before we go, I've a word to say To thee, my own white feather; And then, my plume, we're up and away To the battle-field together! I charge thee never to show thy head Where the feet of a coward bore thee: Thou must sooner droop, as the blood is shed From the breast of him who wore thee. Go up, and nod in the open van, With dangers gathering round thee; That the foe may see 't is the foremost man, Who in his helm has bound thee. 'Mid the din of arms, where the dust and smoke In clouds are curling o'er thee, Be firm, till the enemy's ranks are broke, And they fall, or flee before thee. Yet, I would not have thee towering stand O'er him, who 's for mercy crying; But, bow to the earth, as thy master's hand Shall raise the faint and the dying. 'T is thus we both may escape from shame, And come from the field with glory; And thou shalt be fixed to thy wearer's name, If ever 't is seen in story. MY OWN WILD BOWER. I stood in the halls where wealth and state Their glittering robes displayed; Vice, Vanity, Folly, Ambition and Hate Assembled in masquerade. From the trappings of fashion, the pomp of pride, The wiles and deceit of art, A child of nature, I turned aside, With a chilled and a sickening heart. I sighed to return to the hill and the glen, The scenes of my earliest hours— To breathe in my native air again, As it swept through the sweet wild flowers. I longed to recline on the violet bed, Close down by the murmuring stream, Where oft I have pillowed my infant head, And sunk in a blissful dream. Then, my moments of life were rapid and bright As the rivulet sparkling there; And the hearts that surrounded me true as light, And pure as the woodland air. The velvet couch and the gilded hall, Gay visions of pomp and power, Art, fashion and show, I would give you all For a seat in my own wild bower! THE CORONATION. A grand coronation is near! But who is to hallow the rite? On whom is the crown to appear? And who is to witness the sight? That splendor no mortal must see, Nor join in a throng so august; For all who are there will be free From sorrow, from stain, and from dust! The streets will have pavements of gold, Which the glorious company tread; The King will the diadem hold, To place on his follower's head. For he, who so feeble and pale On the pillow of death lowly lies, Shall find that his path through the vale Leads out to a life in the skies. And when his pure forehead is crowned With light that is never to fade, The harps of the angels shall sound— The treasures above be displayed. The righteous has now but to die; The soldier has finished his fight; His grand coronation is nigh— But earth must not witness the sight. THE DEPARTURE. See the sun at close of day, Calmly gliding down the west; Mark the soft and fading ray, Lingering, to denote the way Where he sinks to rest! So, in peace, her spirit fled, Bright amid the shades of death; And around her dying bed, Mild and heavenly radiance shed At the parting breath. When from earthly pain and grief, From the world's deceit and sin, Full of hope, she sought relief, Full of days, a golden sheaf, She was gathered in. She had fought the goodly fight; She her Father's will had done; Till her raven locks were white, Long, to wear a crown of light, She the race had run. Then, are sighs and tears for me? Shall this aching heart repine, Mourning still, dear friend, for thee? Or its better purpose be Life and death like thine? THE WEEPER. Saw ye the mourner reclining Where the damp earth was her bed, And the young ivy-vines twining, Mantled the house of the dead? Heard ye the voice of the weeper Rise with the herald of day, Calling aloud to the sleeper, Bidding him hasten away? Felt ye her wild notes of sorrow Thrilling your bosom with pain? Dark is the wanderer's morrow— So she must slumber again! Dim is her glimmering taper; Fast she is sinking to rest; Soon shall the evening vapor Gather unfelt, o'er her breast. Sorrow too long has been wearing String after string from her heart; Now, her own finger is bearing On the last thread that can part! Cold was the draught she has tasted; Pale are the lips it has passed; Now, every sand-grain is wasted; Death has released her at last! She, who so lately was weeping, Wounded, despairing and lost, At rest is now quietly sleeping! Life's troubled waters are crossed! THE DYING EXILE. Who will stand, when I shall pillow In the earth this aching head, Pensive, by the drooping willow, O'er my cold and narrow bed? There will be no tender mother, Aged sire, nor constant friend; There will be no sister, brother, O'er my lonely grave to bend. Strangers then will heedless bear me Where the stranger's dust must lie; Yet, the offering none will spare me Of a tear, while thus I die. They behold my life-strings sever At the conqueror's final blow; But the heart that's breaking—never They its inward pangs shall know. Come, ye whispering airs of heaven, Take my sighs, my last adieu To the country whence I'm driven, To the friends to whom I'm true! Let them know I've ceased to languish; Tell them I am freed from pain; That my bosom swelled with anguish, Till its chords all snapped in twain. Say, my last regrets were centred, All my fondness lingered there, Till upon a home I entered Free from banishment and care: That my glad, unburdened spirit Soared triumphantly at last; That a country I inherit Worth all sighs and anguish past. Faith and hope, your strength is doubling! Soon that home will be possessed, “Where the wicked cease from troubling, And the weary are at rest.” THE STAR. Ever beaming, still I hang, Bright as when my birth I sang From chaotic night, In the boundless azure dome, Where I've made my constant home, Till thousand, thousand years have come To sweep earth's things from sight! Mortals, I unchanging view Every change that sports with you On your shadowy ball. All below my native skies, Here I mark how soon it dies; How your proudest empires rise, Flourish, shake, and fall! Wealth and splendor, pomp and pride, I've beheld you laid aside; Love and hate forgot! Fame, ambition, glory, power, You I've seen enjoy your hour; Beauty, withering as a flower, While I altered not! Him, whose sceptre swayed the world, I have seen aghast, and hurled From his lofty throne. Monarch's form and vassal's clay Turned to dust and swept away: E'en to tell where once they lay, I am left alone! When I've been, from age to age, Questioned by the lettered sage What a star might be, I've answered not; for soon, I knew, He'd have a clearer, nobler view, And look the world of mysteries through In vast eternity! Mortals, since ye pass as dew, Seize the promise made for you Ere your day is o'er. The righteous, says a page divine, Are as the firmament to shine; And like the stars, when I and mine Are quenched to beam no more! THE WOUNDED BIRD. Here's the last food your poor mother can bring! Take it, my suffering brood! Oh! they have stricken me under the wing; See, it is dripping with blood! Fair was the morn, and I wished them to rise And taste of its beauties with me; The air was all fragrance, all splendor the skies; And bright shone the earth and the sea. Little I thought, when so freely I went, Spending my earliest breath To wake them with song, it could be their intent To pay me with arrows and death! Fear that my nestlings would feel them forgot Helped me, a moment, to fly; Else, I had given up life on the spot, Under my murderer's eye. Feeble and faint, I have reached you, at length, Over the hill and the plain Strewing my feathers, and losing my strength, Wounded and throbbing with pain! Yet, I can never brood o'er you again, Closing you under my breast! Its coldness would chill you; my blood would but stain And spoil the warm down in your nest. Ere the night-coming, your mother will lie Motionless, under the tree— Helpless and silent, I still shall be nigh, While ye are moaning for me! TO THE SIAMESE TWINS. Mysterious tie by the Hand above, Which nothing below must part! Thou visible image of faithful love, Firm union of heart and heart; The mind to her utmost bound may run, And summon her light in vain To scan the twain that must still be one; The one that will still be twain! The beat of this bosom forbears to reach Where the other distinctly goes; Yet, the stream that empurples the veins of each Through the breast of his brother flows! One grief must be felt by this two-fold mark, As the points of a double dart; And the joy lit up by a single spark Is sunshine in either heart. O wonder, to baffle poor human skill In clay of the human mould! But a greater mystery all must still, In the union of souls, behold. Ye are living harps, by your silken strings In a heavenly concord bound; And who o'er one but a finger flings Awakens you both to sound. But, what do you do when your slumbers come, When ye've sweetly sunken to rest? Do your spirits, side by side, fly home, Still linked, to your mother's breast? Did ye ever dream that your bond was broke; That ye were asunder thrown? And how did ye feel at the severing stroke, When each was forever alone? No—ye would not think of yourselves apart, Even in fancy's wildest mood, For each would seem but a broken heart, And the world but a solitude! Dear youths, may your lives be a flowery way, And, watched by your Maker's eye, May both, at the close, one call obey To shine as twin stars on high! WARNING FROM THE GOLD MINE. Ye, who rend my bed of earth, Mark me! from my lowly birth, Ye to light in me will bring What will rise to be your king! I shall rule with tyrant sway, Till ye rue my natal day! High and low my power shall own, For I'll make the world my throne! And my worshippers shall be Martyrs, dupes, or slaves to me. Love and friendship, on the way To their idol, they will slay. Conscience—I will still her cry; Truth for me shall bleed and die! I will prove a chain to bind Down to earth the immortal mind! Though ye try me by the fire, This will only heat my ire. Though my form ye oft may change, 'T will but give me wider range! For my sake the poor shall feel On his face, his neighbor's heel. Then I'll turn, and, taking wing, Leave with avarice but a sting! I will be a spur to crime, Ye shall sell your peace through time; And a long eternity Of remorse shall come by me! Now I'm here without defence; But, if once I'm taken hence, Man shall eat the bitter fruit Springing from a golden root! THE FROZEN DOVE. Away, from the path, silly dove, Where the foot, that may carelessly tread, Will crush thee!—what! wilt thou not move? Alas! thou art stiffened and dead! Allured by the brightness of day, To sink 'mid the shadows of night, Too far from the cote didst thou stray, And sadly has ended thy flight! For here with the snow at thy breast, With thy wings folded close to thy side, And crouched in the semblance of rest, Alone, of the cold thou hast died! Poor bird! thou hast pictured the fate Of many in life's changeful day, Who, trusting, have found but too late What smiles may be lit to betray. How oft for illusions that shine In a cold and pitiless world, Benighted and palsied like thine, Has the wing of the spirit been furled! And hearts the most tender and light, In their warmth, to the earth have been thrown, 'Mid the chills of adversity's night, To suffer and perish alone! THE DYING STORM. I am feeble, pale and weary, And my wings are nearly furled! I have caused a scene so dreary, I am glad to quit the world! With bitterness I'm thinking On the evil I have done, And to my caverns sinking From the coming of the sun. The heart of man will sicken In that pure and holy light, When he feels the hopes I've stricken With an everlasting blight! For widely, in my madness, Have I poured abroad my wrath; And, changing joy to sadness, Scattered ruin on my path. Earth shuddered at my motion, And my power in silence owns; But the deep and troubled ocean O'er my deeds of horror moans! I have sunk the brightest treasure; I've destroyed the fairest form: I have sadly filled my measure, And am now a dying storm! THE FLY'S REVENGE. “So,” said a fly, as he paused and thought How he had just been brushed about, “They think, no doubt, I am next to nought— Put into life but to be put out! “Just as if when our Maker planned His mighty scheme, He had quite forgot To grant the work of his skilful hand, The peaceful fly, an abiding spot! “They grudge me even a breath of air, A speck of earth, and a ray of sun This is more than a fly can bear: Now I'll pay them for what they 've done!” First he lit on the idle thumb Of a poet; and “now for your thoughts!” said he, “Wherever they soar, I'll make them come Down, from their towering flight, to me!” He went and tickled the nasal tip Of a scholar, and over his eye-brow stung, Till he raised his hand, and his brain let slip A chain of gems, that had just been strung. Off to a crowded church he flew, And over the faces boldly stepped; Pointing out to the pastor's view, How many sheep in the pasture slept. He buzzed about at a lady's ear, Just as a youth, with piteous sigh, Popped the question she would not hear, And only answered, “A saucy fly!” He washed his feet in the worthless tear A belle at the theatre chanced to weep; “Rouge in the bath!” he cried, “my dear, Your cheek has a blush that is not skin deep!” On the astronomer's pointed glass He leisurely stood and stretched his wing; For here, he knew, he was sure to pass For quite a great and important thing. “Now is the time,” said he, “my man, To measure the fly from head to heel! Number the miles, and, if you can, Name the planets that I conceal. “What do you call the twinkling star Over the spot where you see me tread; And the beautiful cluster of lights afar, Ranged in the heavens above my head? “Ah! it is station that swells us all, At once, to a size that were else unknown! And now, if ever I hear you call My race an order beneath your own, “I'll tell the world of this comic scene; And how will they laugh to hear that I, Small as you think me, can stand between You and your views of the spacious sky!” THE VOICE OF THE EAGLE. Lady, the fairest flowers the morn disclosed Are glowing on thy bosom; while within, Thousands of clustering joys are still in bud; And thy fond heart has sweetly promised thee, Ere the bland violet shall hang its head, That they shall be full blown. Thy mild blue eye, With warm affection beaming, wistful looks Far o'er the treacherous deep, as calm it lies Beneath the splendor of a summer sky, And thou dost woo each billow sparkling there To bring thy lover's bark safe back to shore. Yon shining thing, on the horizon hung, That trails its silver fringe along the waves, And in the distance seems as sea or air Might either claim it, thou dost think the sail That is to waft him to thine arms again. But 't is deceitful vapor—false as bright! For this bold wing has swept the snowy cloud, And found it melting, soon to pass away, As pass the hopes that mock the human heart. O lady! there's a secret known to me; To me alone—and when the fatal dart Shall part the down upon the eagle's breast, To stain its whiteness with the crimson drops, 'T will never, never make my heart to ache As thine, when thou the mournful tale shall hear. For thou must sicken—thou must droop and pine, Yea, fade and perish like the tender flower, That thou hast severed from its parent stem, Ere he, whose life was root and stem to thine, Shall meet thee more. It was a stilly hour— You might have heard the tiny sparrow's flight; For, not the coward poplar shook a leaf; And I had soared to breathe in upper air, Leaving my nest beneath the tall lone pine, Whose strong root fastened in the craggy bound That limited the ocean. Suddenly It seemed some mighty, sable pinions spread O'er yonder azure vault, which grew so dark, I thought 't was night, without or moon, or star, And hastened home to seek my callow brood. Then there were rushing, deep and awful sounds; The pine was twisted, and its roots uptorn. Frighted, I cowered, and pressed me 'gainst the shore, To make the fluttering of my bosom cease— There saw my tender nestlings headlong hurled Down, down the beetling cliff, amid the foam Which the mad waters dashed against the shore, Maddening the more that earth repelled their force. The wild and warring winds then onward whirled, The gloomy forest roared, and reeled and fell. The quick, red lightning, with its fiery point, Engraved its path upon the yielding flint; And, overhead, the chariot wheels of Power In blackness rolled across the frowning heavens, With noise, which seemed as that stupendous arch Were rattling down, to crush the world beneath. Just then, a ship came struggling in the bay, With cables parted, bow and anchors lost— Her life-boat weltering in the distant surge; Now she was tossed high up the mountain waves, Then into gaping watery caverns thrown— And when she struck the consummating rock, While she was parting, I beheld the crew, Trembling, with faces paler than the sheets Hung, rent and fluttering round them; but there beamed From every eye a fire so strangely bright, It seemed its radiance might have lasted lives. One fell despairing from the loosening shroud, Another wildly clasped the shivered mast; And some, with hands upraised, as if they sought To meet an arm extended from on high, By which to hold them from their yawning graves, Were going to kneel. He who was last— The feeble lone one on the mighty deep, Clinging a moment to a floating beam, While his bright locks, that late so closely curled, All darkened, wet and heavy, fell apart, Leaving his smooth, white forehead, marble cold, Thrice, with his latest breath, called out thy name, As the black meeting billows closed him in. THE YOUNG ARTIST. Ay! young dreamer, this is the hour For the tablet to glow by the pencil's power! When the soul is pure, and warm, and new, And believes that the world, like itself, is true— When the sky is cloudless, the eye is bright, And gives to its objects its own clear light; Now is the time, while the heart is single, For the painter's touch—for the hues to mingle! Now the portions of light and shade Will on the delicate sketch be laid To stand indelibly, all between Life's gay morn and its closing scene! Honors may bloom on thy future way; And the rays of glory around thee play. But Fame's best laurels never will be So dear as thy sister's wreath to thee! For, they will not set on a cloudless brow And a silken curl, as we see them now! Fame will her envied crown prepare For the whitening locks and the brow of care. Its clustering leaves will not be lit By the smile of a child, who has braided it! As thy native castle, sublimely grand, A beautiful structure, thou mays't stand High and unmoved by the tempest's strife, The bolt and the blast of the storms of life. But should it be thus, there must come a day When thy house will shake, and its strength decay; When the light that will gild its crumbling towers Must be left by the sun of thy childish hours! Then, may their memory, like the vine, Mantling over the ruin, twine, And, spreading a living vesture, climb To cover the rust and the tooth of time, And curtain with verdure the mouldering walls, Which shall not fade till the fabric falls! Sister, gather the buds of Spring, All dewy and bright, as they're opening! Treasure them up from the frost and blight, For a lowering day and a starless night; And they will be fresh in thy bosom still, When all without may be dark and chill. Another will seek to be crowned by thee Lord of thy heart and thy destiny! Thou may'st bestow, in thy riper years, Laurels to water with daily tears. Then will memory love to come Through mist and shade, to thine early home, Within the halo that brightly beams Around the scene of thine infant dreams. Again thou wilt playfully sit, and look On the artless sketch of thy brother's book, And own no moment of earthly bliss So pure, so holy, and sweet as this! Children, Time is a fleeting day, The brighter its scenes, the sooner away! Look to the mansion, and seek the crown That shall not decay when the sun goes down! THE METEOR. Ye, who look with wondering eye, Tell me what in me ye find, As I shoot across the sky, But an emblem of your kind! Darting from my hidden source, I behold no resting place; But must ever urge my course Onward, till I end my race! While I keep my native height, I appear to all below Radiant with celestial light, That is brightening as I go. When I lose my hold on heaven, Down to shadowy earth I tend, From my pure companions driven; And in darkness I must end! THE EMPALED BUTTERFLY. “Ho!” said a butterfly, “here am I, Up in the air, who used to lie Flat on the ground, for the passers by To treat with utter neglect! None will suspect that I am the same With a bright, new coat, and a different name; The piece of nothingness whence I came, In me they'll never detect. “That horrible night of the chrysalis, That brought me at length to a day like this, In the form of beauty—a state of bliss, Was little enough to give From freedom to range from bower to bower, To flirt with the buds and flatter the flower, And shine in the sunbeams hour by hour, The envy of all that live. “This is a world of curious things, Where those who crawl and those that have wings Are ranked in the classes of beggars and kings; No matter how much the worth May be on the side of those who creep, Where the vain, the light, and the bold will sweep Others from notice, and proudly keep Uppermost on the earth! “Many a one that has loathed the sight Of the piteous worm, will take delight In welcoming me, as I look so bright In my new and beautiful dress. But some I shall pass with a scornful glance, Some with elegant nonchalance, And others will woo me, till I advance To give them a slight caress.” “Ha!” said the pin, “you are just the one Through which I'm commissioned, at once, to run From back to breast, till, your fluttering done, Your form may be fairly shown. And when my point shall have reached your heart, 'T will be like a balm to the wounded part, To think how you will be copied by art, And your beauty will all be known!” THE BREAST-PIN. Come, thou dear, thou hallowed treasure, Make thy home upon my breast, Till my days have filled their measure, Till I, too, am gone to rest! Not because I love your glitter, Dazzling gold and sparkling stone, For your charms have dashed with bitter Life's whole fount for many a one. Not for these, bright gift, I'm taking Thee to be my bosom friend! 'T is for thoughts that thou art waking, Memory, but a death to end! That sweet face, so pale and altered, Painted here, can fancy see, Every fainting word that faltered On her lip, I read in thee. May thy sacred name be spoken Never to the mortal ear! For, a dying sister's token, I baptize thee with a tear! THE WINTER BURIAL. The deep-toned bell peals long and low On the keen, mid-winter air; A sorrowing train moves sad and slow From the solemn place of prayer. The earth is in a winding-sheet, And nature wrapped in gloom, Cold, cold the path which the mourners' feet Pursue to the waiting tomb! They follow one, who calmly goes From her own loved mansion-door, Nor shrinks from the way through gathered snows, To return to her home no more. A sable line, to the drift-crowned hill The narrow pass they wind; And here, where all is drear and chill, Their friend they leave behind. The silent grave they're bending o'er, A long farewell to take; One last, last look, and then, no more Till the dead shall all awake! THE ROBE. 'T was not the robe of state, Which the high and the haughty wear, That my busy hand, as the lamp burnt late, Was hastening to prepare. It had no clasp of gold, No diamond's dazzling blaze For the festive board; nor the graceful fold To float in the dance's maze. 'T was not to wrap the breast, With gladness, light and warm, For the bride's attire—for the joyous guest; Nor to clothe the sufferer's form. 'T was not the garb of wo We wear o'er an aching heart, When our eyes with bitter tears o'erflow, And our dearest ones depart. 'T was what we all must bear To the cold, the lonely bed! 'T was the spotless uniform they wear In the chambers of the dead! I saw a fair, young maid In the snowy vesture drest; So pure, she looked as one arrayed For the mansions of the blest. A smile had left its trace On her lip at the parting breath, And the beauty in that lovely face Was fixed with the seal of death! THE CHOICE OF A PRIZE. Thou, who may'st not have fixed upon the prize For which on life's arena thou will strive, Come to the tomb, and, as its doors unfold To give admittance to the weary guests, Who fast are gathering at the destined goal, Cast in thy glance, and ask the inmates here What 's worth the winning! Is it Beauty's palm That shall enkindle thy supreme desire? 'T is here a withered thing, thrown by, forgot! On Beauty's features, see, her sister feeds Not with the better zest, that they were once Bright with the rose and lily, and the light Of an immortal spark! Is Power thine aim? The phantom! how it vanishes from sight! Here lies the head, that nodded kingdoms down; The hand that moved, and nations felt the shock! Bid them but lift themselves, and they will prove The date, the worth of power! Does Pleasure hold Her sweet allurements out for thy pursuit? Beware! beware! see on this new-cut stone The name of him who lived not half his days! He swam in Pleasure's sea, and was ingulfed By giddy whirlpool, ere his sun had gained Its mid-day height! Hast thou a steady eye To Honor, Splendor, Glory, Fame, or Gold, As an attainment worth the toil of life, The mortal race? The mighty leveller Admits of no distinction where he reigns, Save 'twixt himself and those beneath his throne. Honor!—Oh, how it dwindles into nought! None shrinks aside to yield the highest place To him, who cometh where the sleepers are! Splendor!—the covering of the vassal's couch Is bright as his, whose fitful, guilty dream Was under silken drapery! Lord and slave, In death's calm fellowship, sleep side by side. Glory!—The damps and shadows of the grave Put out the brightest halo earth can light! Fame!—Can her trump delight this slumberer; Or pour in sweetness to his heavy ear? Her loudest blast is passing, empty air To him, who here retires to lay him down, Crushing the laurels he has proudly worn! Gold!—Is the miser clenching here the key To wealth, for which he sold the key of heaven? His gold is strewn, as dust upon the wind, Though he, who bought it with eternal life, Hugged it until he felt his soul required, And earth, withdrawing, leave him to the waves That take the dross, which never shall consume! Shall aught of these invite thee? “Oh! no! no! Beauty—may that of holiness be mine! May power be given me to o'ercome the world! For pleasure, may I have a hand to pour The oil and wine upon another's wound! For honor, may I bear my Saviour's cross; For splendor, light that from his follower beams; And be my glory, his approving smile. My fame, the world's reproaches for his sake; My wealth, a conscience where no rust corrodes— One that may look into a coming world, As nature shall dissolve, and feel secure! With these to aid me in the mortal strife, May I the palm of victory o'er the grave Make my immortal prize!” THE LILY. Imperial beauty! fair, unrivalled one! What flower of earth has honor high as thine,— To find its name on His unsullied lips, Whose eye was light from heaven? In vain the power Of human voice to swell the strain of praise Thou hast received; and which will ever sound Long as the page of inspiration shines— While mortal songs shall die as summer winds That, wafting off thine odors, sink to sleep! I will not praise thee, then; but thou shalt be My hallowed flower! The sweetest, purest thoughts Shall cluster round thee, as thy snowy bells On the green, polished stalk, that puts them forth! I will consider thee, and melt my cares In the bland accents of His soothing voice, Who, from the hill of Palestine, looked round For a fair specimen of skill divine; And, pointing out the Lily of the field, Declared, the wisest of all Israel's kings, In his full glory, not arrayed like thee! MOUNT OLIVET. Thou sacred mount, on whose pale forehead now A desert quiet reigneth, ere the soul Goes up to sit in meditation there, She shall put off this world, with all its cares And fading glory, to commune alone With God, and with herself, on themes divine! Thought, on swift wing, darts o'er the dubious waves Where things promiscuous, by three thousand years, Are swept together in one shadowy deep, And rests on Olivet! She here beholds, Fleeing for refuge from a wicked son, And with a wounded spirit bowed to earth, The minstrel king, in bitter anguish come, Showering the mountain with a father's tears For his rebellious child! But richer drops, From purer eyes, and by a mightier One, For thousands sunk in sin, have since been shed, Where David mourned the guilt of Absalom! The King of kings stood here; and looking down, Wept o'er Jerusalem! Here, too, he led, From the last supper, when the hymn was sung, His few grieved followers out, in that drear night, When, in the garden, on the mountain's slope, His agony wrung forth the crimson drops! While these sad pictures, hung upon thy sides, Thou consecrated height, dissolve the heart In pious sorrow; yet thy brow is crowned With a bright, glorious scene! Now, O my soul, On the blest summit light a holy flame! From the last foot-print of the Prince of peace, The Conqueror of death, let incense rise, And enter heaven with thine ascending Lord! Shake off the chains and all the dust of earth! Go up and breathe in the sweet atmosphere His presence purified, as he arose! Come! from the Mount of Olives pluck thy branch, And bear it, like a dove, to yon bright ark Of rest and safety! THE MERMAID'S SONG. Come, mariner, down in the deep with me, And hide thee under the wave; For I have a bed of coral for thee, And quiet and sound shall thy slumber be In a cell in the Mermaid's cave! On a pillow of pearls thine eye shall sleep, And nothing disturb thee there; The fishes their silent vigils shall keep; There shall be no grass thy grave to sweep, But the silk of the Mermaid's hair. And she, who is waiting with cheeks so pale, As the tempest and ocean roar, And weeps when she hears the menacing gale, Or sighs to behold her mariner's sail Come whitening up to the shore— She has not long to linger for thee! Her sorrows will soon be o'er; For the cord shall be broken, the prisoner free; Her eye shall close, and her dreams will be So sweet, she will wake no more! THE CONSIGNMENT: Fire, my hand is on the key, And the cabinet must ope! I shall now consign to thee, Things of grief, of joy, of hope. Treasured secrets of the heart To thy care I hence entrust: Not a word must thou impart, But reduce them all to dust. This—in childhood's rosy morn, This was gaily filled and sent. Childhood is forever gone; Here—devouring element. This was friendship's cherished pledge; Friendship took a colder form: Creeping on its gilded edge, May the blaze be bright and warm! These—the letter and the token, Never more shall meet my view! When the faith has once been broken, Let the memory perish too! This—'t was penned while purest joy Warmed the heart and lit the eye: Fate that peace did soon destroy; And its transcript now will I! This must go! for, on the seal When I broke the solemn yew, Keener was the pang than steel; 'T was a heart-string breaking too! Here comes up the blotted leaf, Blistered o'er by many a tear. Hence! thou waking shade of grief! Go, forever disappear! This is his, who seemed to be High as heaven, and fair as light; But the visor rose, and he— Spare, O memory! spare the sight Of the face that frowned beneath, While I take it, hand and name, And entwine it with a wreath Of the purifying flame! These—the hand is in the grave, And the soul is in the skies, Whence they came! 'T is pain to save Cold remains of sundered ties! Go together, all, and burn, Once the treasures of my heart! Still, my breast shall be an urn To preserve your better part! THE MUSICAL BOX. My little friend, 'tis a stormy day, But we are left together; I to listen, and thou to play; So we'll not heed the weather. The clouds may rise, and the tempest come, The winds and the rain may beat: With thee to gently play “Sweet Home,” I feel that home is sweet! The yellow leaf, from the shivering tree, On Autumn's blast is flying; But a spirit of life enshrined in thee, While all abroad is dying, Calls up the shadows of many a year, With their joys that were bright as brief; And, if perchance it start the tear, 'T is not the tear of grief. 'T is a hallowed offering of the soul, From her purest fountain gushing; A warm, bright gift, that has spurned control, To the eye for freedom rushing; As music's angel, hovering near To touch the tender key, The numbers of a higher sphere Is pouring forth from thee. And while his powerful, magic hand O'er memory's chords is sweeping, To wake and bring from the spirit-land The things that else were sleeping— It lifts my thoughts to a world to come, Where those parted here shall meet, From the storms of life secure at home, And sing, that home is sweet! ADDRESS TO THE AUTOMATON CHESS-PLAYER. Thou wondrous cause of speculation, Of deep research and cogitation, Of many a head, and many a nation, While all in vain Have tried their wits to answer whether, In silver, gold, steel, silk or leather, Or human parts, or all together, Consists thy brain! When first I viewed thine awful face, Rising above that ample case, Which gives thy cloven foot a place, Thy double shoe, I marvelled whether I had seen Old Nick himself, or a machine, Or something fixed midway between The distant two! A sudden shuddering seized my frame; With feeling that defies a name, Or wonder, horror, doubt, and shame, The tout ensemble, I deemed thee formed with power and will; My hair rose up—my blood stood still, And curdled with a fearful chill, Which made me tremble. I thought if, e'en within thy glove, Thy cold and fleshless hand should move To rest on me, the touch would prove Far worse than death; That I should be transformed, and see Thousands and thousands gaze on me, A living, moving thing, like thee, Devoid of breath. When busy, curious, learned and wise Regard thee with inquiring eyes, To find wherein thy mystery lies, On thy stiff neck, Turning thy head with grave precision, Their optic light and mental vision Alike defying, with decision, Thou giv'st them “check!” Some say a little man resides Between thy narrow, bony sides; And round the world within thee rides: Absurd the notion! For what 's the human thing 't would lurk In thine unfeeling breast, Sir Turk, Performing thus, thine inward work, And outward motion? Some whisper that thou 'rt he, who fell From Heaven's high courts, down, down, to dwell In that deep place of sulphury smell And lurid flame. Thy keeper then deserves a pension, For seeking out this wise invention To hold thee harmless, in detention, Close at thy game. Now, though all Europe has confessed, That in thy master Maelzel's breast Hidden, thy secret still must rest, Yet, 't were great pity, With all our intellectual light, That none should view thy nature right,— But thou must leave in fog and night Our keen-eyed city. Then, just confide in me, and show, Or tell, how things within thee go! Speak in my ear so quick and low None else shall know it. But, mark me! if I should discover Without thine aid, thy secret mover, With thee forever all is over, I'll quickly blow it! THE EMPTY BIRD'S NEST. And thou, my sad, little, lonely nest, Hast oft been sought as the peaceful rest Of a weary wing and a guiltless breast! But where is thy builder now? And what has become of the helpless brood, For which the mother, with daily food, Came flitting so light, through the spicy wood, To her home on the waving bough? The fowler, perhaps, has hurled the dart, Which the parent bird has received in her heart; And her tender orphans are scattered apart, So wide, they never again In thy warm, soft cell of love can meet, And thou hast been filled with the snow and the sleet, By the hail and the winds have thy sides been beat, And drenched by the pitiless rain. Though great was the toil which thy building cost, With thy fibres so neatly coiled and crossed, And thy lining of down, thou art lorn and lost, A ruin beyond repair! So I'll take thee down, as I would not see Such a sorrowful sight on the gay green tree; And when I have torn thee, thy parts shall be, Like thy tenants, dispersed in air. Thou hast made me to think of each heart-woven tie; Of the child's first home, and of her, whose eye Watched fondly o'er those, who were reared to die, Where the grave of a distant shore Received to its bosom the stranger's clay; For when, as thy birds, they had passed away, 'T was not to return, and the mother and they In time were to meet no more! THE SOUL'S FAREWELL. It must be so, poor, fading, mortal thing! And now we part, thou pallid form of clay; Thy hold is broke—I can unfurl my wing; And from the dust the spirit must away! As thou, at night, hast thrown thy vesture by, Tired with the day, to seek thy wonted rest, Fatigued with time's vain round, 't is thus that I Of thee, frail covering, myself divest. Thou know'st, while journeying in this thorny road, How oft we've sighed and struggled to be twain; How I have longed to drop my earthly load, And thou, to rest thee from thy toil and pain. Then he, who severs our mysterious tie, Is a kind angel, granting each release; He'll seal thy quivering lip and sunken eye, And stamp thy brow with everlasting peace. When thou hast lost the beauty that I gave, And life's gay scenes no more will give thee place, Thou may'st retire within the secret grave, Where none shall look upon thine altered face. But I am summoned to the eternal throne, To meet the presence of the King most high; I go to stand, unshrouded and alone, Full in the light of God's all-searching eye. There must the deeds, which we together wrought, Be all remembered—each a witness made; The outward action and the secret thought Before the silent soul must there be weighed. Lo! I behold the seraph throng descend To waft me up where love and mercy dwell! Away, vain fears! the Judge will be my friend; It is my Father calls—pale clay, farewell! THE PLAYTHINGS. “Oh! mother, here's the very top, That brother used to spin; The vase with seeds I 've seen him drop To call our robin in; The line that held his pretty kite, His bow, his cup and ball, The slate on which he learned to write, His feather, cap and all!” “My dear, I 'd put the things away Just where they were before: Go, Anna, take him out to play, And shut the closet door. Sweet innocent! he little thinks The slightest thought expressed, Of him that 's lost, too deeply sinks Within a mother's breast!” THE MANIAC. The careless eye, and the piteous one Poor lost Maria alike will shun. She loves to roam with her fearless child, O'er the flowery field and the lonely wild; To list, in a bower of tangled vines, As the wind comes rustling through the pines; To mark the light skip of the timid hare, And to watch the bee on her path of air; The crumbled nut to the ant to fling, And to take the fly from his deadly swing. She sits at eve, by the echoing hill, To mock the voice of the whip-poor-will. At times she will climb to some craggy steep, Will look at her babe, and then to the deep; As she swings her foot on the fearful height, Like a bird of the ocean poised for flight. Then, she calls for a shroud to wrap the dead; And her voice comes low, as a prayer were said. Then, mournful and sweet, as for one who slumbers, To wake no more, flow her dirge-like numbers. She sings of the flowers that are fair and new, Which the morning light or the evening dew Has touched but once, that are meet to spread O'er the grave where beauty has made its bed. But most she loves, in the pensive night, When the air is still, and the moon is bright, To gaze on her sleeping infant's face, And the one loved image there to trace. Yet, when the cherished illusion breaks, When fancy's vision its farewell takes, And flies, as the thing of a blissful dream, Her eye will wander across the stream, And the big tear stand on her cold, pale cheek; But the name, she never is heard to speak. Her sorrow was that which none must hear— Too sacred and deep for an earthly ear; 'T was such, when its waves in the bosom swell, As we to no friend, but our God, can tell. Like the stricken bird, that will feebly fly To the nearest covert, alone to die, She hid the arrow that pierced her breast, And the wound that had robbed her soul of rest. For they came from him to whom alone Her love was pledged at her Maker's throne. She had tried to smile till her lip was white, And her eye with weeping had quenched its light; Till the clouds of care her brow had shaded, Her cheek was sunk, and its rose had faded. From the joys of life in its morning torn, The hapless maniac, dark and lorn, With the future a void—a waste the past, And the present a dream, on the world was cast. The faithless she never again may meet Till they both shall stand at the judgment seat! NATIVE ATTACHMENT. Though year after year has rolled on to the deep, Where their sorrows and joys in oblivion sleep, Since my eye fondly lingered to look an adieu, As the home of my childhood was fading from view, Not a flower nor a vine round my loved native cot, Through time's ceaseless changes, has e'er been forgot. The song of the robin, that sang on the bough Of the neighboring pine is as dear to me now; The brook looks as clear to my memory's eye, And the verdure as fresh on the banks it played by; The lamb bounds as joyous and light o'er the glade, As when 'mid those scenes I in infancy strayed. And oft my dark hours of their cares are beguiled, As fancy's bright wand turns me back to the child That followed the flight of the butterfly's wing, And plucked the red berries that grew by the spring; Or reachéd for the fair purple cluster, that hung Where round the bowed alder the wild tendril clung. The splendor of cities, the polish of art May seek my devotion, and sue for my heart; But no fount of delight on life's landscape will gush Like that, which leapt down by the violet and rush; No notes come so sweet as the song of the bird, Which the ear of the child from the coppice first heard. I find not a gem in my pathway so bright As the fire-fly, pursued by my young feet at night. Earth offers no flowers like the wild ones I wreathed; No breeze comes from heaven like the air I first breathed. No spot seems so pure in the wide vault on high, As that which sent down the first light to my eye! THE SLAVE MOTHER'S PRAYER. O Thou, who hear'st the feeblest prayer, The humblest heart dost see, Upon the chilly midnight air I pour my soul to thee! I bend a form with ceaseless toil Consuming all the day; And raise an eye that wets the soil, As wears my life away. I lift a hand that 's only freed Until to-morrow's task; But how, O God, does nature bleed Upon the boon I ask! How wretched must that mother be, (And I'm the hapless one,) Who begs an early grave of thee, To shield her only son! I would not that my boy were spared To curse his natal hour; To drag the chains his birth prepared, Beneath unfeeling power. Then, ere the nursling at my breast Shall feel the tyrant's rod, O lay his little form at rest Beneath the quiet sod! And when before thine awful throne My master shall appear, A naked spirit, to atone For all his dealings here,— If pardoning grace can be bestowed, And Heaven has pity then, For him, who here no pity showed Towards his fellow-men, Thou 'lt spare him, in thy mercy, Lord, The sinner's fearful doom— The wages, for his just reward, Of death beyond the tomb. THE LITTLE BOY TO THE CRICKET. I have thee now! my brisk new-comer, Sounding thy lay to departing Summer; And I'll take thee up from thy bed of grass, And carry thee home to a house of glass; Where thy slender limbs and the faded green Of thy close-made coat can all be seen. For I long to know if the cricket sings, Or plays the tune with his gauzy wings; To bring that shrill-toned pipe to light, Which kept me awake so long, last night, That I told the hours by the lazy clock, Till I heard the crow of the noisy cock; When, tossing and turning, at length I fell To a sleep so strange, that the dream I'll tell. Methought, on a flowery bank I lay, By a beautiful stream; and watched the play Of the sparkling waters, that fled so fast, I could not count the waves that passed. But I marked the things they were carrying by; And a neat little skiff first caught my eye. 'T was woven of reeds, and its sides were bound By a tender vine, that had clasped it round; And spreading within, had made it seem A basket of leaves, borne down by the stream: And the skiff had neither sail nor oar; But a bright little boy stood up, and bore, On his out-stretched hands, a wreath so gay, It looked like a crown for the queen of May. And while he was going, I heard him sing, “Seize the garland of passing Spring!” But I dared not reach—for the bank was steep; And he bore it away to the far-off deep! Then came a lady—her eye was bright— She was young and fair; and her bark was light. Its mast was a living tree, that spread Its boughs for a sail, o'er the lady's head; And some of the fruits had just begun To flush, on the side that was next the sun; And some with the crimson streak were stained, While others their size had not yet gained. She said, as she passed—“Oh! who can insure The fruits of Summer to get mature? For, fast as the waters beneath me, flowing, Beyond recall, I'm going! I'm going!” I turned my eye, and beheld another, That seemed as she might be Summer's mother. She looked more grave; and her cheek was tinged With a deeper brown; her bark was fringed With the tasseled heads of the wheaten sheaves Along its sides—and the yellow leaves, That covered the deck, concealed a throng Of crickets,—I knew by their choral song. At Autumn's feet lay the golden corn, And her hands were raised to invert a horn, That was filled with a sweet and mellow store, And the purple clusters were hanging o'er. She bade me seize on the fruit, that should last, When the harvest was gone, and Autumn had past! But, when I had paused to make the choice, I saw no bark! and I heard no voice! Then, I looked on a sight that chilled my blood; 'T was a mass of ice, where an old man stood On his frozen raft; while his shriveled hand Had clinched, as a staff by which to stand, A whitened branch that the blast had broke From the lifeless trunk of an aged oak. The icicles hung from the naked limb, And the old man's eye was sunk and dim. But his scattering locks were silver bright, And his beard with the gathering frost was white. The tears congealed on his furrowed cheek, His garb was thin, and the winds were bleak. He faintly uttered, while drawing near, “Winter, the death of the short-lived year, Can yield thee nought, as I downward tend To the boundless sea, where the seasons end. But I trust from others, who've gone before, Thou 'st clothed thy form, and supplied thy store; And now, what tidings am I to bear Of thee,—for I shall be questioned there?” I asked my mother, who o'er me bent, What all this show of the seasons meant? She said 't was a picture of life, I saw; And the useful moral myself must draw! I awoke—and found that thy song was stilled, And the sun with his beams my room had filled! But I think, my cricket, I long shall keep In mind the dream of my morning sleep! THE MIDNIGHT MAIL. 'T is midnight—all is peace profound! But lo! upon the murmuring ground, The lonely, swelling, hurrying sound Of distant wheels is heard! They come—they pause a moment—when Their charge resigned, they start, and then Are gone, and all is hushed again, As not a leaf had stirred. Hast thou a parent far away, A beauteous child to be thy stay In life's decline—or sisters, they Who shared thine infant glee? A brother on a foreign shore? Is he whose breast thy token bore, Or are thy treasures wandering o'er A wide tumultuous sea? If aught like these, then thou must feel The rattling of that reckless wheel, That brings the bright, or boding seal, On every trembling thread, That strings thy heart, till morn appears To crown thy hopes, or end thy fears, To light thy smile, or draw thy tears, As line on line is read. Perhaps thy treasure 's in the deep, Thy lover in a dreamless sleep, Thy brother where thou canst not weep Upon his distant grave! Thy parent's hoary head no more May shed a silver lustre o'er His children grouped—nor deat restore Thy son from out the wave! Thy prattler's tongue, perhaps, is stilled, Thy sister's lip is pale and chilled, Thy blooming bride, perchance, has filled Her corner of the tomb. May be, the home where all thy sweet And tender recollections meet, Has shown its flaming winding-sheet, In midnight's awful gloom! And while, alternate, o'er my soul Those cold or burning wheels will roll Their chill or heat, beyond control, Till morn shall bring relief, Father in heaven, whate'er may be The cup, which thou hast sent for me, I know 't is good, prepared by Thee, Though filled with joy or grief! A VOICE FROM THE WINE PRESS. 'T was for this they reared the vine, Fostered every leaf and shoot, Loved to see its tendrils twine, And cherished it from branch to root! 'T was for this, that from the blast It was screened and taught to run, That its fruit might ripen fast, O'er the trellis, to the sun. And for this they rudely tore Every cluster from the stem; 'T was to crush us till we pour Out our very blood for them! Well, though we are tortured thus, Still our essence shall endure, Vengeance they shall find, with us, May be slow, but will be sure. And the longer we are pent From the air and cheering light, Greater, when they give us vent, For our rest shall be our might. And our spirits, they shall see, Can assume a thousand shapes; These are words of verity, Uttered by the dying grapes. Many a stately form shall reel, When our power is felt within; Many a foolish tongue reveal What the recent draught has been; Many a thoughtless, yielding youth, With his promise all in bloom, Go from paths of peace and truth To an early, shameful tomb. We the purse will oft unclasp, All its golden treasure take, And, the husband in our grasp, Leave the wife with heart to break. While his babes are pinched with cold, We will bind him to the bowl, Till his features we behold Glowing like a living coal. We will bid the gown-man put To his lips a glass or two, Then, we'll stab him in the foot, Till it oversteps the shoe. And we'll swell the doctor's bill, While he parries us in vain; He may cure, but we will kill Till our thousands we have slain. When we've drowned their peace and health, Strength and hopes within the bowl, More we'll ask than life or wealth, We'll require the very soul! Ye, who from our blood are free, Take the charge we give you now; Taste not, till ye wait and see If the grapes forget their vow. TO MY WATCH. Say, what busy tenant inhabits thy breast, Affording thy hands not a moment of rest, While prompting thy voice to the ceaseless “tick, tick,” As if thou wert ever repeating “quick, quick,” And gives thee no time, while thy work thus pursuing, To tell what so quick must be done, or is doing? “The same little genius so busy with me Is he, who is constantly watching by thee; Whose task was assigned at thine earliest breath, Thy minutes to count, till he leaves thee in death. Art thou busy or idle, awake or in slumber, He still keeps his vigils, still adds to the number. “I pause not to name thee thy work, it is true, For I know not the things thou may'st yet have to do; But the watch-word I give is to make thee take heed How time ever flies, and how matchless its speed: Thou may'st read in my face how thy minutes are wasting, And thou to that bourne, where they end, art still hasting. “For my diligent hands to repose will I ask: They, ever employed, just accomplish their task; Yet, I know they will rest, when to motionless clay That hand shall be changed that hath wound me to-day; For my pulse will be stopped, and my voice cease repeating My one, only word, when thy heart stills its beating. “When low in the earth my loved mistress shall sleep, Thy watch will be given to another to keep, I shall rouse from my slumbers my work to resume, While, silent and cold, lies thy dust in the tomb, Far from time and from me, when thy spirit is proving What here it performed, while my finger was moving.” THOUGHTS. Eyes, say, why were ye given your sight, Your full blue orbs, with their roll and their light, Which your lids of the lily with violet tinge, So often of late, with their long, dark fringe From their folds in your arches descended to shade? Ye have told many things—but not why ye were made. “We were made to delight in the beauties of earth; Then to see how they perished, how little their worth: They are changing, illusive, uncertain and brief, From the flower's opening bud to its soon withered leaf. The birth of their being is joined to decay; They flourish, allure, and expire in a day. On things like ourselves with delight we have shone; We have studied their language and found it our own; But the offspring of grief would extinguish their light, And the spoiler's pale hand lock them up from our sight. Or, keener, far keener, they'd let us behold Their looks turning from us, unfeeling and cold, Bequeathing this line, as we saw them depart, ‘We go not alone, but are drawn by the heart!’ For things such as these, and still more were we made; For watching, for aching, to sink and to fade; To pour forth in silence the waters of sorrow, Then, to close in a night that will bring us no morrow?” And wherefore were you, ye thicks locks, that were laid In the clustering curls, or the bright sunny braid? “To shine in our pride o'er the temples awhile, Arresting the eye, and affecting the smile; Then, loose, unadorned, and neglected, to go, While the dark clouds of care shed among us their snow, To be screened from life's storms by the marble and willow, And to rest, thinned and damp, on a cold earthy pillow.” Ye withering roses, that bloomed on the cheek, Say, what was your purpose? and what do ye speak? “Our errand was short—we 've accomplished our duty, And shown you how vain, and how fleeting is beauty!” And thou, wasting form, once so buoyant and free, So fair, and so flexile, come, say, what of thee? “Like the insect that sports out its warm summer's day, Or the atom that floats on the bright solar ray, I have shone 'mid the glitter of fashion and pleasure; I have flitted my hour, and have filled up my measure; I have borne the bright chaplet, the silk's graceful fold; Have decked myself out in rich fossils and gold; Gay colors have clothed me, I've worn the light plume To enliven my path to the verge of the tomb. Yet I knew all the while, I was transient and frail; I felt myself sinking, my energy fail. I knew that the canker was trying his power, That his tooth had begun at the heart of the flower, That, true to his purpose, he'd finish my fall To the final abode, the asylum of all.” If such be the end of each perishing part, Immortal, invisible, tell what thou art; Thy business, and what thou dost hope to inherit, Thou restless, aspiring, unsatisfied Spirit! “What my nature may be, there is none that can know, But the Being above to whose presence I go. But I 've dwelt on this earth, and its joys have embraced, 'Till I 've found myself wounded, deceived and disgraced. Its flowers, when I touched them, would wither and fall; I tasted its cup, but 't was mingled with gall. Allured to its landscape, the serpent or snare I found was concealed, and awaited me there; That the rainbow hung o'er it, so bright to my eyes, At best, was but vapor, or tears in disguise. I have leant on this world, 'till with anguish I feel It is harder, and colder, and keener than steel; Only constant to change, and to falsehood but true, It stabs while it kisses, and smiles to undo. But for me the deceit of its visions are o'er; They shall wound and enslave and ensnare me no more: For, faint, torn and bleeding, I turn from the earth, And look up in faith to the realm of my birth: I know there 's a sun with a glorious light, With beams full of healing, to burst on my sight, Dispelling the shadows of sorrow and care; I know that a balm, a Physician is there. That country, that home, the unsatisfied Spirit Here sighs to recover, and hopes to inherit.” THE ZEPHYR'S SOLILOQUY. Though whence I have come, or whither I go, My end or my nature I ne'er may know, I will number o'er to myself a few Of the countless things I am born to do. I flit in the days of the joyous Spring, Through field and forest, and freight my wing With the spice of the buds, which I haste to bear Where I know that man will inhale the air. And while I hover o'er beauty's lip, I part her locks with my pinion's tip; Or brighten her cheek with my fond caress, And breathe in the folds of her lightsome dress. I love to sport with the silken curl On the lily neck of the laughing girl; To dry the tear of the weeping boy, Who 's breaking his heart for a broken toy; To fan the heat of his brow away, And over his mother's harp-strings play, Till, his griefs forgotten, he looks around For the secret hand that has waked the sound. I love, when the warrior mails his breast, To toss the head of his snow-white crest; To take the adieu that he turns to leave, And the sigh that his lady retired to heave! When the sultry sun of a summer's day Each sparkling dew-drop has dried away, And the flowers are left to thirst to death, I love to come and afford them breath; And under each languid, drooping thing To place my balmy and cooling wing. When the bright, fresh showers have just gone by, And the rainbow stands in the evening sky, Oh! then is the merriest time for me; And I and my race have a jubilee! We fly to the gardens and shake the drops From the bending boughs and the floweret tops; And revel unseen in the calm star-light, Or dance on the moon-beams the live-long night. These, ah! these are my hours of gladness! But, I have my days and my nights of sadness! When I go to the cheek where I kissed the rose, And 't is turning as white as the mountain snows; While the eye of beauty must soon be hid Forever, beneath its sinking lid— Oh! I 'd give my whole self but to spare that gasp, And save her a moment from death's cold grasp! And when she is borne to repose alone Neath the fresh-cut so d and the church-yard stone, I keep close by her, and do my best To lift the dark pall from the sleeper's breast; And linger behind with the beautiful clay, When friends and kindred have gone their way! When the babe, whose dimples I used to fan, I see completing its earthly span, I long, with a spirit so pure to go From the scene of sorrow and tears below, Till I rise so high I can catch the song Of welcome, that bursts from the angel throng, As it enters its rest—but alas! alas! I am only from death to death to pass. I hasten away over mountain and flood, And find I'm alone on a field of blood. The soldier is there—but he breathes no more; And there is the plume, but 't is stained with gore. I flutter and strive, in vain, to place The end of his scarf o'er his marble face; And find not even a sigh, to take To her, whose heart is so soon to break! I fly to the flowers that I loved so much— They are pale, and drop at my slightest touch. The earth is in ruins!—I turn to the sky— It frowns!—and what can I do, but die? FOREST MUSIC. There's a sad loneliness about my heart,— A deep, deep solitude the spirit feels Amid this multitude. The things of art Pall on the senses—from its pageantry My weary eye turns off; and my ear shrinks From the harsh dissonance that fills the air. My soul is growing sick—I will away And gather balm from a sweet forest walk! There, as the breezes through the branches sweep, Is heard aërial minstrelsy, like harps Untouched, unseen, that on the spirit's ear Pour out their numbers till they lull to peace The tumult of the bosom. There's a voice Of music in the rustling of the leaves; And the green boughs are hung with living lutes, Whose strings will only vibrate to his hand Who made them, while they sound his untaught praise! The whole wild wood is one vast instrument Of thousand, thousand keys; and all its notes Come in sweet harmony, while Nature plays To celebrate the presence of her God! THE PROSTRATE PINK. Alas! alas! a silly Pink, To climb so fast, and never think How feeble was my trust! I sought a high and airy throne; Aspired too far to stand alone; And now, in lowliness, must own My kindred with the dust! O, would my stem had snapped in twain, And saved me from the lingering pain Of being thus abased! 'T is worse than death to lie so low, While all the laughing flowers must know, Ambition caused my overthrow, And brought me here disgraced! My native spot is far behind! Nor can I turn and hope to find Again my parent root, Where, fain my blushing head I 'd screen Among the leaves so thick and green, Whence I, a timid bud, was seen In infancy to shoot. My beauteous form and hue, so bright, I thought could tempest, hail and blight And insect's touch defy. I grew in boldness—meekness fled; I burst my cup, my odors shed With lavish haste; my petals spread, And courted every eye. I little knew how great the fault Myself to flatter and exalt, Until I found, too late, My head grew giddy with the height; The sun-beam seemed a whirling light; I lost my balance—lost my sight; And here I met my fate. My sister Flowers, take heed! take heed! Your loveliness will ever need Protection from the blast. Be cautious what your beauties court, Whereon you venture, how you sport; And if a straw is your support, See where you may be cast. Your charms are highest half concealed; Your sweets are dearest, when revealed With modesty and fear; And she, who quits the leafy shade That nature for her shelter made, May pine and languish, moan and fade, Like her who sorrows here. THE BENEFACTOR. Unsullied by time, and undimmed by a tear, But fresh, on the wing of the new-born year, I come, a pure and a holy thing; And to all, who receive me, some gift I bring. For childhood, amused with its stories and toys, I 've a lasting supply of those innocent joys; And a breastplate of truth, that I'll place o'er its heart, To keep it unspotted from falsehood and art. I give to the youth, as his hopes are full-blown, Those hopes undeceived till their fruits are full-grown: In the landscape of life, that before him is spread, I will leave not a thorn, where I know he must tread. I grant to the young and the beautiful maid A form ne'er to wither—a cheek ne'er to fade— A heart not to grieve that the lip oft may smile, And treachery lurk in the bosom the while! I give to the aged, to whom life must seem, As 't is past in review, like a short, busy dream, The peace undisturbed which may spring from the trust, That, beyond time and earth, they shall live with the just. For you, who are treading the gay, giddy round Of fashion and folly, for you I have found A far nobler work for your life's fleeting day; And I give to you wisdom to shine on your way. To the prisoner, immured in the dark, starless night Of a dungeon, I give heaven's pure air and light; And the power, though his hands may be crimson with guilt, To wash themselves white from the blood they have spilt. I give to the exile, who 's destined to roam From parent, from brother, and sister and home, A welcome from him, who, those treasures possessing, Shall find himself blest in bestowing the blessing. For the poor I 've a shelter from cold and from storm; I 've bread for his mouth, and a garb for his form; But chiefly, a spirit to soar from the dust To a treasure on high, safe from moth and from rust. To the rich, for their deeds, as a final reward, I will leave but the look and the word of their Lord: May they hear, with a smile, from their Master divine, “Ye have done unto me what ye did unto mine!” Thus, for high and for low, for the young and the old, For the wise and the foolish I 've treasures untold; And Wish is my name—but ye never must hear What bosom I sprang from to hail the New Year! THE NEW TOMB. These lines were occasioned by an event which took place in Boston a few months since. They've finished the darksome abode, Of silence, of death, and of dust! And who, of the train that are thronging the road To this mansion, shall enter it first? It is not the silvery head, That here shall be first to repose; Nor the babe, that shall come to the house of the dead, Ere the bud of its life can unclose. But, mark him, whose cheek is so bright With the freshness of beauty and youth— Whose step is so firm, and whose bosom so light With the glow of affection and truth! Ere care has o'ershadowed his brow, With the roses of health all in bloom, From the many, who love him, he comes even now; For he is the first for the tomb! And shall he, who could carry the charm Of joy wheresoe'er he was known— Shall he with affections, so kindly and warm, Come down and repose here alone? Oh! no—from the sorrowing train There hastens a beautiful maid— Ere the moon shall be full in her lustre again, Her form by his side will be laid! The kindred in blood, far from sight, Together shall slumber in peace; The kindred in spirit their voices unite In praises, that never shall cease. They would not their friends should bewail Their absence from scenes they have trod! They beckon the mourner to look through the veil, Where they shine with the brightness of God! THE BLIND MAN. 'T is darkness, darkness; dreary, starless night; Nature a blank, and day that shows no sun; Man, earth and seas and heavens shut out from sight— Such is thy portion, blind and hapless one! Hapless! a smile upon thy lip will dwell, While in thy sunken eye no light appears! That cold and rayless orb will never tell If first its film would burst with joy or tears. Yet light is in thy soul—that fire divine, That shone on Horeb's mount, illumines thee; Thou walk'st in safety, for the Guide is thine, Whom Israel followed through the parting sea. Though thou must grope for pillars hands have raised, Like him who erst Philistia's thousands slew, The temple where, by angels, God is praised, Thy father's house, is ever kept in view. Thou know'st how soon these earthly walls must fail; How frail and vain the things of time and sense; Thy steady faith looks onward through the veil, Where life eternal and its joys commence. Thy head is white—thy foot is at the grave; And nature's hasty work is nearly done; But He will bear thee safe o'er Jordan's wave, Whose peace is with thee, blind, but happy one! THE SHIP IS READY. Fare thee well! the ship is ready, And the breeze is fresh and steady. Hands are fast the anchor weighing; High in the air the streamer's playing. Spread the sails—the waves are swelling Proudly round thy buoyant dwelling. Fare thee well! and when at sea, Think of those, who sigh for thee. When from land and home receding, And from hearts, that ache to bleeding, Think of those behind, who love thee, While the sun is bright above thee! Then, as down to ocean glancing, In the waves his rays are dancing, Think how long the night will be To the eyes, that weep for thee. When the lonely night-watch keeping, All below thee still and sleeping— As the needle points the quarter O'er the wide and trackless water, Let thy vigils ever find thee Mindful of the friends behind thee! Let thy bosom's magnet be Turned to those, who wake for thee! When, with slow and gentle motion, Heaves the bosom of the ocean— While in peace thy bark is riding, And the silver moon is gliding O'er the sky with tranquil splendor, Where the shining hosts attend her; Let the brightest visions be Country, home and friends, to thee! When the tempest hovers o'er thee, Danger, wreck and death before thee, While the sword of fire is gleaming, Wild the winds, the torrent streaming, Then, a pious suppliant bending, Let thy thoughts, to heaven ascending, Reach the mercy-seat, to be Met by prayers that rise for thee! THE ANEMONE. Thy charm, pale, modest, timid one, Is this, that thou dost ever shun The public walk, and to the sun Dost show an open heart, Which does not fear the brightest ray, That 's darted from the eye of day, Will aught of secret stain betray, Or find a double part. And thou hast never been beguiled To quit the simple, quiet wild, Where nature placed her modest child To worship her alone. Thou dost not ask the brow of toil To shed its costly dew, to spoil The bed of free, untortured soil, Which thou hast made thine own. And now, if I were hence to take Thee, root and stem, it would but make Thee homesick—and the spell would break, That 's round the desert gem. So, I will set me down and look On thy fair leaves, my little book, To read the name of Him, who took Such care in forming them! WRITTEN IN AN ALBUM. These lines were inscribed on a leaf but two inches square. Thou tiny leaf, Thou art so small, so very small, I must be brief, If I would sully thee at all, With aught that from my pen may fall! Then haste from me; Go quick to Caroline, and show My wish, that she O'er no rude spot of earth, may go, Small as thyself, where thorns shall grow:— That there may be No cloud so broad in all her sky 'T would shadow thee; Nor pain nor sorrow e'er come nigh To blanch her cheek, or dim her eye:— That I may claim What she on memory may bestow In friendship's name— A smile, or tear, as joy or wo Shall mark the path where I may go! RECOLLECTIONS. I wonder what they have done with the pine, Where the red-breast came to sing— With the maple, too, where the wandering vine So wildly used to fling Its loaded arms from bough to bough, And if they gather the grapes there now. I should like to know if they 've killed the bee, And carried away the hive; If they 've broken the heart of my chestnut-tree, Or left it still to survive, And its laughing burs are showering down Their loosened treasures of shining brown. And there was a beautiful pond, that stood Like an ample azure vase, Or a mirror, embosomed in wild green wood, For the sun to see his face. Have they torn up its lilies to open a sluice And let that peaceful prisoner loose? Perhaps they have ruined the ancient oak, That gave me its grateful shade; And its own dead root in its bed is broke By the plough, from its branches made; Nor am I sure I could find the spot Where I had my bower and my mossy grot. And shall I go back to my first loved home, To find how all is changed, Alone o'er those altered scenes to roam, From my early self estranged? Shall I bend me over the glassy brook, No more on the face of a child to look? No! no! for that loveliest spot upon earth Let memory's charm suffice! But the spirit will long to the place of her birth, From time and its change to rise; To soar and recover her primal bloom, When death with his trophy has stopped at the tomb! TO THE MOON BEAMS. Away, away, from her favorite bower, Where ye loved to come in the evening hour, To silver the leaf, to smile on the flower, And checker the scene so playfully! Away, away! for the maid ye seek Hath a darkened eye, and a pale, pale cheek! As the lonely walk and the flowers all speak, While they hang their heads so mournfully! Away! for the voice ye used to win, With its soft, rich melody formed within, Is hushed—'t is gone, as it never had been Poured out so sweet and feelingly! And the fearful harp, that ye could make Its deepest and tenderest notes awake, Now hath not a string but it fain would break, They lie so lorn and listlessly! Away, to the slope of the dew-bright hill; Where the sod is fresh, and the air is chill; Where the marble is white, and all is still, O'er beauty sleeping peacefully! But never reveal who there is led By your light to weep o'er her lowly bed, That a spirit so pure from the earth hath fled, And to sigh for her loss unceasingly! THE CHEROKEE AT WASHINGTON. I come from an ancient race— From the wilds where my father trod; And, though I present the red man's face, I believe in the Christian's God. I come where your Chief is laid, At rest in his own dear land; And I now would ask, if his mighty shade Presides o'er your council band. If so, he will know the type Of peace and of purity; The chain of gold, and the silver pipe, Bestowed on the Cherokee. And here must he turn aside To weep, and to blush for shame, Thus to hear our nation's rights denied, And his debase her name. Oh! no—by the faith of man, Our claims ye must yet allow! By the Book ye read, ye never can Thus your pledges disavow! Ye say that He went about, Whom ye follow, doing good. Does he bid you hunt the red man out, Like a wolf from his native wood? Ye teach us, too, that He Is to judge the quick and the dead: Before His throne, will the difference be That the face was white or red? And ye tell us what He said, When He pointed to the coin Impressed with the sovereign's name and head, And what his words enjoin. Our image on our land, As Cæsar's on the gold, Has been impressed by our Maker's hand, And it never must be sold! For, dear as the spot of earth Where first your breath ye drew, Your father's sepulchres, your hearth And altar are to you; The ties are far more strong, Which we feel to our native soil, Than yours—ye have not been so long, As the nation ye would spoil! By power ye may o'ercome; But should ye thus succeed, And drive the poor Indian from his home— Great Spirit, forgive the deed! THE THRICE-CLOSED EYE. The eye was closed, and calm the breast; 'T was Sleep—the weary was at rest! While fancy on her rainbow wings Ranged through a world of new-made things, Mid regions pure, and visions bright, Formed but to mock the waking sight. For, ah! how light does slumber sit, On sorrow's brow—how quickly flit From her pale throne, when envious care Comes wrapped in clouds and frowning there! Again I saw the falling lid, And from his sight the world was hid. The lip was moved; the knee was bent; The heavy laden spirit went, Bearing her burden from the dust Up to her only Rock of trust; And, childlike, on her Father's breast Cast off the load, and found her rest. For, this was Prayer—'t was faith and love Communing with a God above. At length that eye was locked' the key Had opened heaven—'t was Death! yes, he Had sweetly quelled the mortal strife, And to the saint the gates of life Unbolted. On the sleeper's brow Lay the smooth seal of quiet now, Which none could break. The soul, that here Dwelt with eternal things so near, Had burst her bonds to soar on high, And left to earth the thrice-closed eye! TO A ?????? Thy parents, boy, are on the deep, The wide and pathless sea; But He, who wafts their sail, will keep A father's eye on thee. For he hath seen what they have done; And he hath heard their prayer,— He knows they 've left their darling son Beneath his guardian care. The tenderness thy mother felt, When to her breast she drew Her child, and at his altar knelt, His love will still outdo. And he will guard thy parents too, Upon a foreign shore; For his the eye, at single view, To look creation o'er. He'll let thy little image cling To all their thoughts by day; And nightly, like a cherub thing, About their slumbers play. In many a bright and blissful dream They'll kiss thy rosy cheek; Thy laughing, sparkling eye will beam— Thy prattling tongue will speak. Thy tender arms, so warm and fair, Around their necks will twine; They'll feel thy silken, sunny hair,— That ruby lip of thine. While oft they dwell on scenes behind Of dear domestic joy, The loveliest objects brought to mind Will be their smiling boy. A HYMN AT SEA. O Thou, who hast spread out the skies And measured the depths of the sea, 'Twixt the heavens and the ocean shall rise, Our incense of praises to thee! We know that thy presence is near, While our bark tosses far from the land; And we ride o'er the deep without fear; For, the waters are held in thy hand. Though not since the morn when the flood Poured in, this vast cavern to fill, Has the sea ever motionless stood, Or the pulse of its bosom been still;— Inscribed on its face, from that hour Thy name has indelibly shone, Where man, while he worships thy power, Can leave not a trace of his own! Eternity comes in the sound Of the billows, that never can sleep! There's Deity circling us round— Omnipotence walks o'er the deep! O Father, our eye is to thee, As on for the haven we roll; And faith in our Pilot shall be An anchor to steady the soul! AMERICAN HYMN. Who, when darkness gathered o'er us, Foes and death on every side, Robed in glory, walked before us, Leading on, like Israel's guide? 'T was Jehovah! he appearing Showed his banner far and wide! When the trump of war was sounding, 'T was the Lord who took the field; He, his people then surrounding, Made the strong in battle yield; To our fathers, few in number, He was armor, strength and shield! In the God of armies trusting, Mid their weakness, void of fear, Soon they felt their bonds were bursting— Saw the dawning light appear. Clouds, dissolving in the sunbeams, Showed the land of freedom near. Hark! we hear to heaven ascending, From the voices of the free, Hallelujahs, sweetly blending With the song of Liberty! Power Almighty, we the victory Ever will ascribe to thee! Lo! the dove, the olive bearing, Plants it on Columbia's shore! Every breast its branch is wearing Where the buckler shone before! Praise the Eternal! He is reigning! Praise Him! praise Him evermore! FUNERAL DIRGE. Lift not, lift not the shadowy pall From the beauteous form it veileth; Nor ask, as the offerings of sorrow fall, Who it is that the mourner waileth! We could not look on a face so dear, With the burial gloom surrounding; A name so cherished, we must not hear, While her funeral knell is sounding! But seek with the throng of the young and fair Their loveliest still to number;— You will find her not! for 't is her we bear In the mansion of death to slumber! She shone to our sight like a gladdening ray Of light, that awhile was given To brighten the earth, and has passed away, Undimmed, to its source in heaven! THE INDIAN BOY WITH HIS FATHER'S BOW. “I look on the bow that my father bent, And I know the ways where the warrior went. I remember the flash of the chieftain's eye; When he heard the whoop of the foeman nigh! I can see the fall of that stately head On the dauntless breast, when its blood was shed; And I bear in my heart the charge that hung, To avenge his death, on the faltering tongue! “My hand is as firm to bend the bow; My foot through the forest as fleet to go; I can aim my dart with as sure an eye; And I am as ready as he to die! My spirit is burning with thirst to meet Our ancient foe—for revenge is sweet. Lo! onward I go, and my father's shade Shall be at my side, till the debt is paid!” He leaps, and is gone, like the bounding deer; But not like her, from the hound and spear. He flies to his death—he has met the dart; And 't is drinking the blood of that fearless heart! But it came too late, for his dying ear The curse of his falling foe can hear— The arrow was sped, which brings him low, By the hand of the son, from the father's bow! WHITEFIELD'S REMAINS. The remains of the Rev. George Whitefield are deposited beneath the pulpit of the Church of the First Presbyterian Society in Newburyport, Mass., in which there is a marble cenotaph to his memory. Ye sacred relics, not with foot profane Would I disturb the quiet of the dead; Where, wrapped in shades and stillness ye have lain, Till more than half a century hath fled! I have no vainly curious eye to see, How strange the works of time and death appear; To find the sentence of mortality, “Ashes to ashes!” executed here. Yet, I from infancy have longed to look, For once, on you, then bid a long farewell; Since 't was from you, great Whitefield's spirit took Her flight to mansions where the blessed dwell! Ye were her earthen vessel!—and ye bore That goodly treasure on, from clime to clime! Ye were the fine-wrought vesture that she wore, And gently dropped, as closed the scene of time. Here, hallowed dust, thou still hast slumbered on, While, o'er thy rest, the beauteous feet of those, Who brought salvation's news, have stood; then gone, Tired with life's journey, to the grave's repose. And wilt thou linger yet, till he, who stands Above thee now, the Gospel to proclaim, Has ceased to lift in prayer his holy hands, And monumental marble speaks his name? Oh! wait not this The removal of these remains to the public burial-ground, was contemplated at the time this was written.—but go and sleep unseen, Deep in the bosom of thy mother earth! Let nature deck thy couch with living green, Till, changed, the archangel's trump shall call thee forth! And now, farewell! I have been told by thee, The things a thousand tongues would fail to say: Thou bid'st the mortal part its value see— The soul mount up where Whitefield's led the way! THE RELEASE. “And when Herod would have brought him forth, and the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains; and the keepers before the door kept the prison.” Behold, amid the prison's gloom profound, While Herod's guards the massive doors are keeping, By soldiers watched, in iron fetters bound, The man of God, serene and sweetly sleeping. And thus the loved disciple of the Lord Can sink to rest, defying pain and sorrow, While persecution points the glittering sword To mark him as her victim ere the morrow. For, what is there in death for him to fear, Though he no more may see earth's morning breaking? He feels 't is but salvation drawing near; That Heaven's bright dawn shall follow his awaking! But who is this, that suddenly appears, With light effulgent round the prison beaming? The captive feels his touch—awakes, and hears A voice, whose sound hath more than earthly seeming! “Rise! gird thyself, and bind thy sandals on, And follow me without the yielding portals! Thy chains are broken, and the power is gone, That armed awhile these blind and erring mortals!” It was thine angel, O! thou Holy One, That hovered o'er thy servant in his slumber! His labors in thy cause were not yet done— His days of service had not gained their number. Like him, the man whose trust is fixed on thee May ever rest, mid threatening foes and danger: But where, O Lord, can hope or safety be, For him, who treads life's path, to thee a stranger? THE MOON UPON THE SPIRE. The full-orbed moon has reached no higher, Than yon old church's mossy spire, And seems, as gliding up the air, She saw the fane; and, pausing there, Would worship, in the tranquil night, The Prince of peace—the Source of light, Where man for God prepared the place, And God to man unveils his face. Her tribute all around is seen; She bends, and worships like a queen! Her robe of light and beaming crown, In silence, she is casting down; And, as a creature of the earth, She feels her lowliness of birth— Her weakness and inconstancy Before unchanging purity! Pale traveller, on thy lonely way, 'T is well thine homage thus to pay; To reverence that ancient pile, And spread thy silver o'er the aisle, Which many a pious foot has trod, That now is dust beneath the sod; Where many a sacred tear was wept, From eyes that long in death have slept! The temple's builders—where are they? The worshippers?—all passed away, Who came the first, to offer there The song of praise, the heart of prayer! Man's generation passes soon; It wanes and changes like the moon. He rears the perishable wall; But, ere it crumbles, he must fall! And does he sink to rise no more? Has he no part to triumph o'er The pallid king? no spark, to save From darkness, ashes and the grave? Thou holy place, the answer, wrought In thy firm structure, bars the thought! The spirit that established thee, Nor death, nor darkness e'er shall see! THE WIDOW'S LULLABY. Ah! slumber on, my darling boy, Nor send the blissful dream away, Which makes the smile of conscious joy Across thy beauteous features play. Thou think'st, perhaps, thy sire is here, And clasps thee in a fond embrace! Thou know'st not 't is thy mother's tear, So warm upon thy dimpled face! Thou hast not learned how still and cold, The arms where thou believ'st thou art; Nor dost thou know that mine infold An orphan near a widow's heart! And, shouldst thou at this moment wake, I know what name thou 'dst lisp the first; To hear it called in vain, would make This aching, swelling heart to burst! THE METHODIST CHURCH. Lord, whatso'er the temple, where Thy children meet to worship thee, Hast thou not given thy word, that there, To bless them, thou wilt surely be? Then thou art here with those, who kneel In reverence of thy name divine! Their souls thy cheering presence feel— To faith's pure eye thy glories shine. For here a favored flock is fed With that blessed food thy love hath given; And prayers, like mingling odors shed From golden phials, rise to heaven. We see about this hallowed fane No pageant marks on either side:— No splendid offering of the vain, Nor costly sacrifice to pride. Around no drapery idly falls— No sculptured marble proudly stands: Devotion reared these modest walls, And here she lifts her holy hands. Thy servants here are curtained round, Lord, by the shadow of thy wings; And dearest ornaments are found— The jewels of the King of kings! The fervent heart is kindling here, And sends to heaven a holy flame; This altar takes contrition's tear, The brightest gift that Christ would claim! THE BUTTERFLY'S DREAM. A tulip, just opened, had offered to hold A butterfly, gaudy and gay; And, rocked in a cradle of crimson and gold, The careless young slumberer lay. For the butterfly slept, as such thoughtless ones will, At ease, and reclining on flowers, If ever they study, 't is how they may kill The best of their mid-summer hours. And the butterfly dreamed, as is often the case With indolent lovers of change, Who, keeping the body at ease in its place, Give fancy permission to range. He dreamed that he saw, what he could but despise, The swarm from a neighboring hive; Which, having come out for their winter supplies, Had made the whole garden alive. He looked with disgust, as the proud often do, On the diligent movements of those, Who, keeping both present and future in view, Improve every hour as it goes. As the brisk little alchymists passed to and fro, With anger the butterfly swelled; And called them mechanics—a rabble too low To come near the station he held. “Away from my presence!” said he, in his sleep, “Ye humble plebeians! nor dare Come here with your colorless winglets to sweep The king of this brilliant parterre!” He thought, at these words, that together they flew, And, facing about, made a stand; And then, to a terrible army they grew, And fenced him on every hand. Like hosts of huge giants, his numberless foes Seemed spreading to measureless size: Their wings with a mighty expansion arose, And stretched like a veil o'er the skies. Their eyes seemed like little volcanoes, for fire,— Their hum, to a cannon-peal grown,— Farina to bullets was rolled in their ire, And, he thought, hurled at him and his throne. He tried to cry quarter! his voice would not sound, His head ached—his throne reeled and fell; His enemy cheered, as he came to the ground, And cried, “King Papilio, farewell!” His fall chased the vision—the sleeper awoke, The wonderful dream to expound; The lightning's bright flash from the thunder-cloud broke, And hail-stones were rattling around. He 'd slumbered so long, that now, over his head, The tempest's artillery rolled; The tulip was shattered—the whirl-blast had fled, And borne off its crimson and gold. 'T is said, for the fall and the pelting, combined With suppressed ebullitions of pride, This vain son of summer no balsam could find, But he crept under covert and died. MARY DOW. “Come in, little stranger,” I said, As she tapped at my half-open door, While the blanket pinned over her head, Just reached to the basket she bore. A look full of innocence fell From her modest and pretty blue eye, As she said, “I have matches to sell, And hope you are willing to buy. “A penny a bunch is the price; I think you'll not find it too much; They 're tied up so even and nice, And ready to light with a touch.” I asked, “What 's your name, little girl?” “'T is Mary,” said she, “Mary Dow.” And carelessly tossed off a curl, That played o'er her delicate brow. “My father was lost in the deep, The ship never got to the shore; And mother is sad, and will weep, When she hears the wind blow and sea roar. “She sits there at home without food, Beside our poor sick Willie's bed; She paid all her money for wood, And so I sell matches for bread. “For every time that she tries, Some things she 'd be paid for, to make, And lays down the baby, it cries, And that makes my sick brother wake. “I 'd go to the yard and get chips, But then it would make me too sad; To see men there building the ships, And think they had made one so bad. “I 've one other gown, and with care, We think it may decently pass, With my bonnet that 's put by to wear To meeting and Sunday-school class. “I love to go there, where I'm taught Of One, who 's so wise and so good, He knows every action and thought, And gives e'en the raven his food. “For He, I am sure, who can take Such fatherly care of a bird, Will never forget or forsake The children who trust to his word. “And now, if I only can sell The matches I brought out to-day, I think I shall do very well, And mother'll rejoice at the pay.” “Fly home, little bird,” then I thought, “Fly home full of joy to your nest!” For I took all the matches she brought, And Mary may tell you the rest. THE CROCUS'S SOLILOQUY. Down in my solitude under the snow, Where nothing cheering can reach me; Here, without light to see how to grow, I trust to nature to teach me. I'll not despair, nor be idle, nor frown, Locked in so gloomy a dwelling; My leaves shall run up, and my roots shall run down, While the bud in my bosom is swelling. Soon as the frost will get out of my bed, From this cold dungeon to free me, I will peer up with my little bright head; All will be joyful to see me. Then from my heart will young petals diverge, As rays of the sun from their focus; I from the darkness of earth will emerge A happy and beautiful Crocus! Gaily arrayed in my yellow and green, When to their view I have risen, Will they not wonder how one so serene Came from so dismal a prison? Many, perhaps, from so simple a flower This little lesson may borrow— Patient to-day, through its gloomiest hour, We come out the brighter to-morrow! THE DISSATISFIED ANGLER BOY. I'm sorry they let me go down to the brook, I'm sorry they gave me the line and the hook, And I wish I had stayed at home with my book. I'm sure 't was no pleasure to see That poor, little, harmless, suffering thing Silently writhe at the end of the string; Or to hold the pole, while I felt him swing In torture, and all for me! 'T was a beautiful, speckled and glossy trout, And when from the water I drew him out On the grassy bank, as he floundered about, It made me shivering cold, To think I had caused so much needless pain; And I tried to relieve him, but all in vain; Oh! never, as long as I live, again May I such a sight behold! O, what would I give once more to see The brisk little swimmer alive and free, And darting about, as he used to be, Unhurt, in his native brook! 'T is strange how people can love to play By taking innocent lives away; I wish I had stayed at home to-day With sister, and read my book. CUPID'S WARNING. “Take heed! take heed! They will go with speed; For I've just new-strung my bow! My quiver is full; and if oft I pull, Some arrow may hit, you know, You know, you know, Some arrow may hit, you know.” “Oh! pull away,” Did the maiden say, “For who is the coward to mind A shaft that's flung by a boy so young, When both of his eyes are blind, Are blind, are blind, When both of his eyes are blind? His bow he drew; And the shafts they flew, Till the maiden was heard to cry, “Oh! take the dart from my aching heart, Dear Cupid, or else I die! I die, I die, Dear Cupid, or else I die!” He said, and smiled, “I am but a child, And should have no skill to find, E'en with both my eyes, where the dart now lies; Then you know, fair maid, I'm blind, I'm blind, I'm blind, You know fair maid, I'm blind!” THE REVOLUTIONARY SOLDIER'S BEQUEST. “Behold,” the hoary veteran said, “The silver scattered o'er my head; A remnant of the auburn hair, That curled in sunny clusters there, When, in the land that now is thine, With bounding flock and fruitful vine, While Freedom's banner waves unfurled, The envy of a gazing world, Life was but slavery to me; And when I fought, my son, for thee. “Thy father's forehead time has bared; The few white locks, that yet are spared And lonely round my temples stray, Soon from thy sight must pass away. So thinned, so scattered o'er the land Is now that valiant, patriot band, Who, when their country gave the word, ‘To arms! to arms! gird on thy sword!’ Sprang forth, resolved her chains to break, Or earth their gory bed to make. And, gathering where their chieftain led, Thick as the hairs that clothed his head, Marched onward, where the foeman stood, Waiting to dip his foot in blood. “Though many a groan was heard around From quivering lips that strewed the ground; Yet none could pause to bid farewell, When at his side his brother fell, To close alone the dying eye— To heave unheard the final sigh, With none to stay the fleeting breath, Or wipe away the damps of death. For struggling Liberty impelled, When nature's ties had fain withheld; Until the God of armies spake The word, that made her bonds to break. And Independence, shouting loud, Burst glorious from the fiery cloud That rolled upon the battle-field, And scenes of blood and death concealed! 'T was thus thy liberty was won, 'T was thus I fought for thee, my son! “Yes, on the earth I've sought my rest, The hoar-frost gathering o'er my breast; And oft the freezing, midnight air That chilled my blood, has warmed my prayer, That He, who governs all, would ride With victory on our injured side. Through winter's cold, and summer's heat, With aching head and weary feet, And hunger's cravings, I have gone; And when I saw the morning dawn, Have thought my day of life must close, Ere the first star of evening rose. “But now those toils have long been o'er, And Plenty spreads from shore to shore; While Peace and Freedom join to sing The praises of our heavenly King. And long his eye has sweetly slept, Who then in lonely sorrow wept, And bowed with years beneath the stroke, When his last earthly prop was broke, And his fair son, upon the plain, Lay pale, and numbered with the slain. The widow too, has made her bed Low as her soldier's when he bled, And waning life could only spare A breath to waft the soldier's prayer, ‘Receive, O God, my soul—and bless The widow and the fatherless!’ “And now, the dimpled babe that smiled, When the armed warrior clasped his child; And felt a father's parting kiss Distend his little heart with bliss; Nor knew that parting kiss must sever His father's face from his forever; That infant's face is altered now, Life's Autumn rays are on his brow. While bending o'er the grave I stand Waiting a few last grains of sand, To drop my clay beneath the sod And give my spirit back to God. “No glittering wealth that stored the mine, Will at thy father's death be thine. The scanty portion earth bestows Just lasts me to my journey's close! But then, I feel I leave thee more Than sparkling gems, or dazzling ore; Thy heritage is worth them all— Thy lines in pleasant places fall, Thou hast the land of liberty, Which I have fought to win for thee. O, keep the dear bequest I make Unsullied, for my memory's sake! Let no usurping tyrant tread Upon my low and peaceful bed— No cringing slave retire to weep For freedom, where my ashes sleep. But when the hand of Time shall trace His name in furrows on thy face; When four-score years have plucked thy hair, And bowed thy form their weight to bear; When thou the minute-hand shalt see, Pointing thy feet to follow me, To God, and to thy country true, Then, for a heavenly home in view, Thou to thy son this land resign, As blessed and free, as I to mine.” TO MRS. L??, With a little book of Poems in manuscript. Although my foot could never tread On proud Parnassus' lofty head, And though I 've long essayed in vain E'en on its side a seat to gain; I 've often knelt in supplication Before the Muse for inspiration, Who turned aside her partial ear, And all my prayers refused to hear. And, though my steps did never falter, While seeking flowers to deck her altar, Before the offerings could be made, My voice grew faint, my wreaths would fade; My sacrifices were rejected, Or passed unnoticed and neglected. Though many an hour and many a day, I 've sighed for power to sing and play; I never sought to strike the lyre With half the feeling, half the fire With which to-day I fain would sing, And sweep for thee, the tuneful string— For notes so deep, so sweet and clear, As I would pour into thine ear! And yet my voice was ne'er so low, My trembling hand ne'er half so slow, My fearful lyre so loth to pour Its timid numbers forth, before! Where genius, science, taste refined Are centred in one favorite's mind, And she may listen to a throng Of all the darling sons of song, It ill befits me to appear; And if I come, 't is but with fear,— The feeble taper's shrinking blaze Amid the sun's resplendent rays! I never wished for flowers so sweet As I would scatter at thy feet. But all I bring are wild and pale, And humble natives of the vale, Which I have plucked, where oft I stray, On fancy's wild and devious way, In playful, or in pensive mood, As chanced to pass my solitude. I know they soon would droop and die Beneath the world's stern, withering eye. But since thy wish is to receive them, With joy, in trust, with thee I leave them; Assured that thou desir'st to take The gift, but for the giver's sake. Of them I 've formed a small bouquet, A keepsake, near thy heart to lay, Because 't is there, I know full well, That charity and kindness dwell. And, in some lonely, silent hour, When thou shalt yield to memory's power, And let her fondly lead thee o'er The scenes that thou hast past before, To absent friends and days gone by, Then, should they meet thy pensive eye, A true memento may they be Of one, whose bosom owes to thee So many hours enjoyed in gladness, That else perhaps had passed in sadness, And many a golden dream of joy, Untarnished and without alloy— Of one whose eye looks back to view The scenes that she has journeyed through, And sees no spots more brightly shine, Than those her feet have trod with thine; Whose fervent prayer will ever be “Heaven's choicest blessings rest on thee!” THE PEBBLE AND THE ACORN. “I am a Pebble! and yield to none!” Were the swelling words of a tiny stone, “Nor time nor seasons can alter me; I am abiding, while ages flee. The pelting hail and the drizzling rain Have tried to soften me, long, in vain; And the tender dew has sought to melt, Or touch my heart; but it was not felt. There 's none that can tell about my birth, For I'm as old as the big, round earth. The children of men arise, and pass Out of the world, like the blades of grass; And many a foot on me has trod, That 's gone from sight, and under the sod! I am a Pebble! but who art thou, Rattling along from the restless bough?” The Acorn was shocked at this rude salute, And lay for a moment abashed and mute; She never before had been so near This gravelly ball, the mundane sphere; And she felt for a time at a loss to know How to answer a thing so coarse and low. But to give reproof of a nobler sort Than the angry look, or the keen retort, At length she said, in a gentle tone, “Since it has happened that I am thrown From the lighter element, where I grew, Down to another, so hard and new, And beside a personage so august, Abased, I will cover my head with dust, And quickly retire from the sight of one Whom time, nor season, nor storm, nor sun, Nor the gentle dew, nor the grinding heel Has ever subdued, or made to feel!” And soon, in the earth, she sunk away From the comfortless spot where the Pebble lay. But it was not long ere the soil was broke By the peering head of an infant oak! And, as it arose and its branches spread, The Pebble looked up, and wondering said, “A modest Acorn! never to tell What was enclosed in its simple shell; That the pride of the forest was folded up In the narrow space of its little cup! And meekly to sink in the darksome earth, Which proves that nothing could hide her worth! And oh! how many will tread on me, To come and admire the beautiful tree, Whose head is towering towards the sky, Above such a worthless thing as I! Useless and vain, a cumberer here, I have been idling from year to year. But never, from this, shall a vaunting word From the humbled Pebble again be heard, Till something without me or within, Shall show the purpose for which I 've been!” The Pebble its vow could not forget, And it lies there wrapped in silence yet. IT SNOWS. It snows! it snows! from out the sky The feathered flakes, how fast they fly, Like little birds, that don't know why They 're on the chase, from place to place, While neither can the other trace. It snows! it snows! a merry play Is o'er us, on this heavy day! As dancers in an airy hall, That has n't room to hold them all, While some keep up, and others fall, The atoms shift, then, thick and swift, They drive along to form the drift, That weaving up, so dazzling white, Is rising like a wall of light. But, now the wind comes whistling loud, To snatch and waft it, as a cloud; Or giant phantom in a shroud; It spreads! it curls! it mounts and whirls, At length, a mighty wing unfurls; And then, away! but, where, none knows, Or ever will.—It snows! it snows! To-morrow will the storm be done; Then, out will come the golden sun: And we shall see, upon the run Before his beams, in sparkling streams, What now a curtain o'er him seems. And thus, with life, it ever goes; 'T is shade and shine!—It snows! it snows! A SABBATH AT NAHANT. The sun has thrown his morning beams Against the cliffs, that fence the waves, And down his mellow glory streams, Through narrow clefts and widening caves. The mossy rock, the foamy surge, The pebbly beach and grassy height, And site and cot, on ocean's verge, Are in a flood of sabbath light. And yet, no sabbath bell I hear Say “Come! come! come! the shepherd waits, Until his gathering flock draw near, To meet them at his temple gates!” These rocks, sublime in silence, stand And point us to the house of prayer! The deep gives out her loud command For man to praise her Ruler, there! The light, that is its author's smile, This balmy air, God's hallowed day, His finger in the heart the while, All to his altar show the way. Now, by the willows, o'er the green, With ready feet, I pass to seek His face, who laid this mighty scene, While all its parts his praises speak. Here, on the margin of the sea, The fane in simple beauty stands; That minds us of eternity— This, of the “house not made with hands”— Where different tribes, from lands afar, Shall to one happy home be led, By light that beamed from Bethlehem's star, To gather round one blessed Head. Stranger by stranger takes a seat; Our songs and aspirations blend; Through various ways, we come to meet Our common Parent, Lord and Friend. And, that our inmost wants may cease, And all the bosom's care and strife, The servant of the Prince of peace Presents to each the bread of life. It is an hour of sacred calm, Too bright and sweet on earth to waste, While Heaven is pouring down its balm, And manna falls, that all may taste. Father, when life's short vale is crossed, Within thy peaceful mansions grant, That all may find we have not lost This holy sabbath at Nahant! THE SPOUTING HORN. On the dark rock's steep I stood, where the deep By its view, like a mighty spell, bound me; While the white foam-wreath Was weaving beneath, And the breeze from the waters played round me; Then wave after wave, To a low, narrow cave, Came, as rest from a long journey seeking; But, “out! out! out!” Was the word, which the Spout To its guests seemed eternally speaking. And each billow seen Rolling up, soft and green, To the Horn, full of grace in its motion, Now wild, as with fright, Would return snowy white, And rush, roaring, back to the ocean. In vain did my eye, By its search, seek to spy The monarch of this gloomy dwelling, Who thus, by the force Of his voice, stern and hoarse, The deep in her might was repelling. What power could be there, Shut from light, heat and air, I asked, with the dumbness of wonder; But, “Out!” was the word, That alone could be heard, And in sounds like the roaring of thunder! O Time! Time! 't is thus, Thou art sporting with us; Our touch at thy shore proudly spurning. To eternity we, As the waves to the sea, Are broken and restless returning! THE LOST KITE. “My kite! my kite! I've lost my kite! Oh! when I saw the steady flight, With which she gained her lofty height, How could I know, that letting go That naughty string, would bring so low My pretty, buoyant, darling kite, To pass forever out of sight? “A purple cloud was sailing by, With silver fringes, o'er the sky; And then, I thought, it seemed so nigh, I 'd make my kite go up and light Upon its edge, so soft and bright; To see how noble, high and proud She 'd look, while riding on a cloud! “As near her shining mark she drew, I clapped my hands; the line slipped through My silly fingers; and she flew, Away! away! in airy play, Right over where the water lay! She veered and fluttered, swung and gave A plunge, then vanished with the wave! “I never more shall want to look On that false cloud, or babbling brook; Nor e'er to feel the breeze that took My dearest joy, to thus destroy The pastime of your happy boy. My kite! my kite! how sad to think She flew so high, so soon to sink!” “Be this,” the mother said, and smiled, “A lesson to thee, simple child! And when by fancies vain and wild, As that which cost the kite that 's lost, The busy brain again is crossed, Of shining vapor then beware, Nor trust thy joys to fickle air! “I have a darling treasure, too, That sometimes would, by slipping through My guardian hands, the way pursue, From which, more tight than thou thy kite, I hold my jewel, new and bright, Lest he should stray without a guide, To drown my hopes in sorrow's tide!” THE VETERAN AND THE CHILD. “Come, grandfather, show how you carried your gun To the field, where America's freedom was won, Or bore your old sword, which you say was new then, When you rose to command, and led forward your men; And tell how you felt with the balls whizzing by, Where the wounded fell round you, to bleed and to die!” The prattler had stirred, in the veteran's breast, The embers of fire that had long been at rest. The blood of his youth rushed anew through his veins; The soldier returned to his weary campaigns; His perilous battles at once fighting o'er, While the soul of nineteen lit the eye of four-score. “I carried my musket, as one that must be But loosed from the hold of the dead, or the free! And fearless I lifted my good, trusty sword, In the hand of a mortal, the strength of the Lord! In battle, my vital flame freely, I felt Should go, but the chains of my country to melt! “I sprinkled my blood upon Lexington's sod, And Charlestown's green height to the war-drum I trod. From the fort, on the Hudson, our guns I depressed, The proud coming sail of the foe to arrest. I stood at Stillwater, the Lakes and White Plains, And offered for freedom to empty my veins! “Dost now ask me, child, since thou hear'st where I 've been, Why my brow is so furrowed, my locks white and thin— Why this faded eye cannot go by the line, Trace out little beauties, and sparkle like thine; Or why so unstable this tremulous knee, Who bore ‘sixty years since,’ such perils for thee? “What! sobbing so quick? are the tears going to start? Come! lean thy young head on thy grandfather's heart! It has not much longer to glow with the joy I feel thus to clasp thee, so noble a boy! But when in earth's bosom it long has been cold, A man, thou 'lt recall, what, a babe, thou art told.” THE RUIN. O! where are the faces that once so bright, Came in at these hingeless doors, And the feet of the many, which then, so light Tripped over these mouldering floors? Where then at the window used to appear, In beauty, the human form, The paneless casement is void and drear, And open to wind and storm. The tangled ivy a covering leaves, As it creeps o'er the sinking walls, While the owlet hoots, and the spider weaves, Sole monarchs of these dim halls. The eye where trembled the sparkling tear— The lip that was curled in mirth— Where, where are they all, who once were here To people this crumbling hearth? The dusky chambers, gloomy and lone, The breeze swept over and sighed; While the voice of Time, from his dismal throne, The ruinous pile, replied,— “The faces have changed, and been sent away! The feet have been long laid by! The form has returned to its kindred clay, And darkness has wrapped the eye! “All, all, who were here, like the hurrying waves That ride on the restless stream, Have hastened away; have dropped in their graves; Have finished life's changeful dream. “'T is bootless now, to the lowly dead, Who sleep in their beds of earth, That their feet were light, that their tears were shed, Or their lips were curled in mirth. “Their splendor and mourning have both been cast Far into the dust and shade; And master and mansion my hand, at last, In ruins alike hath laid. “Yet man hath a spark forever to burn, A part that I ne'er can kill; When I bid his form to the earth return, The spirit defies me, still. “But I never must know, as the soul withdrew, For me to dissolve the clay, If joy or sorrow were hers in view, Nor whither she winged her way. “My sceptre is over these earthly things; I raise, and I shake them down; And nations, and empires, and chiefs and kings, I conquer, and keep my crown. “But I, in my turn, am to pass away; My reign must at length be o'er, When One, whose mandate e'en I must obey, Commands me to be no more!” I said, “O Time! if thy work be such With man and his earthly home, I'll place my treasures where, not thy touch, Nor death's, is ever to come!” THE VOICE. The voice—its melody touched the ear, As a sound we should look toward heaven, to hear; As the soft, rich light of the western sky, Where the sun went down, will meet the eye. And it made me think of a world afar, Above the sun, and the evening star— Of the odors of flowers that freight the air With the notes of the bright ones warbling there. Methinks, when the world looks void and dark— When the waves of trouble ingulf my bark— When the sky above me is black with wrath, And the lightning is all that illumes my path; While I set my feet but with doubt and dread; When the friend that I loved is false or dead; In fear, in sorrow, in pain or care, I would hear that voice poured out in prayer. When the storm is past, and the heavens look bright, While the clouds that I feared are dissolved in light— When I smoothly glide o'er a peaceful sea, With a breeze all fragrance and purity; When the friend that I chose is the true one still, Who adds to good, and who takes from ill; In every joy that may gild my days, I would hear that voice sent up in praise. It was tuned for a rare and holy gift; To pour in prayer, and in praise to lift; And through the ear as it took control, And wrought its charm o'er the spell-bound soul, It came in a sound so sweet and deep, It could soothe the heart, though the eye must weep. But it was not made for the thoughtless mirth Whose light is a blaze from the chaff of earth! THE ALABASTER BOX. And, who is she that, bearing The Alabaster Box, Is thus, neglected, wearing Her long and silken locks? Her form is fair, but o'er her A shade of grief is cast, That speaks of wo before her, Or bitterness that 's past. Oh! whither is she going? And what is it to seek, With sorrow's fountains flowing On either pallid cheek? Behold! her steps are tending To him who sits at meat. 'T is Mary! see her bending To weep at Jesus' feet! And while her tears bestrew them, As pearls that scatter there, Her lips she presses to them, And wipes them with her hair. And, of a heart that 's broken For sin that she forsakes, She gives the precious token— The alabaster breaks. From ointment now, that 's gushing To pour on Jesus' head, Sweet odors forth are rushing, And round the dwelling spread. But they, who see her spilling The spikenard fresh and pure, Rebuke her, as unwilling To sell it for the poor. While he, whose eye possesses The hidden, inmost thought, Pronounces good, and blesses The work by Mary wrought. He sees her heart is riven, And bids her sorrow cease. To them, he says, “Forgiven, She shall depart in peace. “The poor are with you ever! For them your treasures save. But she before we sever, Anoints me for the grave!” Fair penitent! when breaking For thee, the stony tomb, With sweeter odors waking, Thy spirit he'll perfume! THE EMPTY BIER. Thou empty bier, that standest here Alone, by the church-yard gate, Say, whose the door thou 'lt pause before Thy burden next to wait? The bier replied—“My range is wide, And my hours of rest but few; Yet, to One alone can the ways be known That I must hence pursue. “I first may seek her form, whose cheek Is fresh in its maiden bloom, On me to lie, with a rayless eye, At the threshold of the tomb. “The youth, who last sped by so fast, With the nerve and the glow of health— He next may find, that close behind Death followed him by stealth. “Or she, who smiled, when the lovely child She was lately leading near. With wonder stopped, and his lilies dropped, To gaze at the sable bier— “That mother may be called to lay That beauteous boy on me, In his morning hour, like the dewy flower He lost, and as suddenly. “Her own pale clay to bear away, It next may be my lot; She may close her eyes on her infant ties, And her prattler be forgot. “As I must call, in time, for all, From the babe to the silver-haired, Thy glance at me, perchance may be, A hint to be prepared!” THE LOST HYACINTH. My hyacinth, my hyacinth At length has come to light! And round the stalk and purple buds The leaves are green and bright! Renewed in beauty it has broke From out the crumbling earth; And, when I thought it dead and gone, It has another birth! My hyacinth! my hyacinth! At last I 've found thee out. Oh! where hast thou been hid so long? What hast thou been about? “I 've been,” the little hermit said, “Within my lowly cell; And joy I 've had in quiet there, That tongue can never tell. “In sweet communion with the power To which alone I trust, I 've worshipped long at nature's shrine, Abased below the dust. “This upper world I find a scene Of peril, change and strife; And from seclusion I must draw My sweetest draught of life. “I would not live, if ever thus, Uncovered to the glare Of yonder sun, I must be brushed By ev'ry vagrant air. “'T is best for me, and best for thee That I should pass from sight, To be a while in loneliness, And hidden from the light. “For I should lose my greatest worth By being always here; Thou would'st not feel the joy thou hast To see me re-appear. “From calm and humble solitude My first attractions flow, And, but for these, I were but poor, Without a charm to show. “But I 've come back to stand a while In beauty to thine eye; And when my flowers have gladdened thee, They'll be content to die. “And, while thy hyacinth her sweets Shall pour from every bell, Remember she her fragrance gained Within the lowly cell!” ECHO. “Father! father! come with me Down among the rocks! Softly! for I long to see Who it is that mocks. When I laugh, or sing, or call, Some one there repeats it all.” “Ah! my child, thou dost not know All that 's dear and true, In this world of noise and show, Has its semblance too. E'en a sound with joy in it Will draw forth its counterfeit. “Mid the dissonance of earth We so oft must hear, Sweet the voice of infant mirth Falls upon the ear. Mingled innocence and joy! Blessed harmony, my boy. “And, in heartless mockery, Echo now has caught Tones of gladness sent from thee; While herself is nought But the shadow of a sound, Thrown from rocks and hills around. “Be thou cautioned from to-day; For thou yet must meet, Here and there on life's rude way, Many a fair deceit. No illusion seek to trace To her seeming dwelling-place. “Here, while snares and pit-falls lie Round on every part, One is calling from on high, “Son, give me thy heart!” He will ne'er deceive nor mock, Fly to Him, the Living Rock!” HYMN OF THE REAPERS. Our Father, to fields that are white, Rejoicing, the sickle we bear, In praises our voices unite To thee, who hast made them thy care. The seed, that was dropped in the soil, We left, with a holy belief In One, who, beholding the toil, Would crown it at length with the sheaf. And ever our faith shall be firm In thee, who hast nourished the root; Whose finger has led up the germ, And finished the blade and the fruit! The heads, that are heavy with grain, Are bowing and asking to fall; Thy hand is on mountain and plain, Thou Maker and Giver of all! Thy blessings shine bright from the hills, The valleys thy goodness repeat; And, Lord, 't is thy bounty that fills The arms of the reaper with wheat! Oh! when with the sickle in hand, The angel thy mandate receives, To come to the field with his band To bind up, and bear off thy sheaves,— May we be as free from the blight, As ripe to be taken away, As full in the ear, to thy sight, As that which we gather to-day! Our Father, the heart and the voice Flow out their fresh off'rings to yield. The Reapers! the Reapers rejoice, And send up their song from the field! THE QUAKER. The Quaker stood under his smooth broad-brim, In the plain drab suit, that, simple and trim, Was better than royal robes to him, Who looked to the inward part, And emptied his breast of the pride of birth, Resigning the wealth and the honors of earth, For the durable riches of matchless worth, Reserved for the pure in heart. And he heaved a sigh at the lofty look Of the mitred head, o'er the gilded book, And a view of the costly drapery took With a meek and pitying eye, “Alas!” said he, as he turned away From the splendid temple, the grand display, “What honor to worldly pomp they pay, In the name of the King Most High!” Then he looked around on his own proud land, Where those of his faith were a suffering band Enslaved in conscience, and under the hand Of merciless power oppressed. “I'll seek,” said the Quaker, “a happier shore, Where I and my people may kneel before The shrine we erect to the God we adore, And none shall our rites molest!” And, sick of the sounding of empty things, The beggarly strife in the land of kings, His dove-like spirit unfurled its wings For a broad and venturous sweep: They wafted him off, o'er billow and spray, 'Twixt the sea and the sky, on a pathless way, To a beautiful sylvan scene, that lay Far over the boiling deep. And when he came down, unruffled and staid, Where, along the skirts of the peaceful shade, The Schuylkill and Delaware rolled, and made Their sparkling waters unite, The Indian sprang from his light canoe, The bird to the topmost bough withdrew, And the deer skipped up on the cliff, to view The new and unseemly sight. But the tomahawk dropped from the red man's hand, When he saw the Quaker advance, and stand, Presenting his purse, but to share the land He had come to possess with him; And scanning his mild and noble face, Where goodness was most that his eye could trace, He haughtily smiled at its hiding-place, Far under the hat's broad brim. “Thou 'lt find,” said the Quaker, “in me and in mine, But friends and brothers to thee and to thine, Who abuse no power, and would draw no line 'Twixt the red man and the white, Save the cord of love, as a sacred tie; For our one great Father, who dwells on high, Regards that child with an angry eye, Who robs from his brother's right.” The Indian passed, and the Quaker stood, The righteous lord of his shadowy wood, Like the genius of thought, in his solitude; Till his spirit, the inner man, Become too mighty to be repressed Beneath the drab on his ample breast, Had moved; and simply, but neatly dressed, Came forth, as his lips began,— “I may not swear, but will prophesy! This lofty forest, that towers so high, Must bow; and its stately head will lie On the lap of its mother earth. When the woodman's axe shall its pride subdue, And its branching honors the ground shall strew, Then some of its parts may be reared anew, To shelter the peaceful hearth. “And some will go down upon distant seas, Be firm in the tempest, and swift in the breeze, While man and his treasures they waft with ease And safety, the world around! Some to a temple, the pious will raise, That in a new house, the ancient of days May hear, as his name, in prayer and in praise, From the lips of his saints shall sound! “Where now the poor Indian marks the sod With offerings burnt to an unknown God, By the Gospel light shall the paths be trod To the courts of the Prince of peace. And commerce is here to appoint her mart; The marble will yield to the hand of art; From the sun of science the rays will dart, And the darkness of nature cease!” And thus did the visions of prophecy Arise and swell, to the prophet's eye, Till it shone so bright, and had blazed so high, That the gentle words, which hung Like a string of pearls, from his cautious lip, On their silver thread, he was fain to clip, Lest something more than the truth might slip, For once, from a Quaker's tongue. But the trees quaked too, at the things he spoke; For they felt that the “knee of the knotted oak” Would bend, ere the word of a Quaker broke; And they bowed and kissed the ground. The hammer and axe had abjured repose, And the mountains rang with their distant blows, As the forest fell and the city rose, And her beauty shone around. For her laws—they were righteous, pure and plain, As the warm in heart, and the cool in brain, To bind the strong in a silken chain, Could in wisdom and love devise. The tongue needed not the bond of a vow, And man to his fellow-worm did not bow, Or doff the screen o'er his upright brow, To any beneath the skies. The Quaker went on, from land to land, With the lowly heart and the open hand Of one, who felt where he soon must stand, And his final account give in. For long had he made up his sober mind, That he could not depart to leave mankind, With the ample field of the earth behind, No better that he had been. And bright was the spot where the Quaker came, To leave it his hat, his drab and his name, That will sweetly sound from the trump of Fame Till her final blast shall die. The city he reared from the sylvan shade, His beautiful monument now is made; And long have the rivers their pride displayed In the scenes they are rolling by. WASHINGTON. When the warm sun comes o'er the eastern hills, And his bright face the world with splendor fills, Where are the stars that crowned the brow of night? Drowned in his glory, dwindled out of sight! So earth's great names will lessen one by one, Fade and go out, in that of Washington; Who took through life, his high, untrodden way, Unmatched, as through the heaven's the orb of day. Return, ye mighty, ye illustrious dead, Whose shining deeds on history have shed Its purest radiance—who from age to age, Have left your names, as stars, upon the page Of the world's annals! now return and play Your parts again, and who shall wear the bay? The wreath, that blooms without a blighted leaf, Is on the forehead of our nation's chief! Bring out your swords, ye warriors, from the hush Of their long slumbers! while a thousand blush, For madly clashing in the needless strife, With blood that tells of wanton sport with life, One wisely-tempered, shines without a stain! Columbia's hero ne'er unsheathed in vain! By noble means, he noble ends pursued, Whose first great conquest was himself subdued. Ye Patriots, come! and all your breasts unveil; Show whose the flame that was the last to fail. 'T is his, who on our country's altar cast His dearest private interests to the last; Till self consuming for a people's right, Rose like a cloud of incense, in the sight Of earth and heaven, and, from a weary hand, The baffled foeman dropped his harmless brand! Statesmen and Sages! come and cluster round! Who aimed so high, reflected so profound, As our great Counsellor! His mental light Shone for a people, gave a nation sight. He, a fair pillar, by a Master hand, Sublime towers o'er you, rock-based, firm and grand. Wisdom, and strength, and beauty! these combined To form the perfect structure of his mind. Philanthropists, from every clime, draw near; While in your midst we set your high compeer, Rehearse your lives, and prove, if any can, Who honored God, by purer love to man, Than glowed within the bosom that is laid In holy rest, beneath the cypress-shade, Where Vernon gives our deathless Friend a tomb, To slumber with his laurels all in bloom. Souls of the just made perfect! which of you, More just and perfect, bade the world adieu, Than our immortal Chieftain? Here he bore The high commission from his King to pour The oil of joy upon a struggling land— To give a nation being by his hand; Yet, o'er the earth, with garments undefiled, Walked before heaven, as a little child. Spirit of Washington! though often told, The story of thy deeds can ne'er grow old, Till no young breast remains to be inspired, And virtue, valor, greatness have expired. But should the land, whose bondage thou hast broke, Barter her freedom for another yoke, Oh! look not down upon her! she will be Debased, nor worth a father's smile from thee. THE GREAT REFINER. “And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver.” 'T is sweet to feel that he, who tries The silver, takes his seat Beside the fire that purifies; Lest too intense a heat, Raised to consume the base alloy, The precious metal too destroy. 'T is good to think how well he knows The silver's power to bear The ordeal to which it goes; And that, with skill and care, He'll take it from the fire, when fit For his own hand to polish it. 'T is blessedness to know that he The piece he has begun Will not forsake, till he can see, To prove the work well done, An image, by its brightness shown, The perfect likeness of his own. Silver, undergoing the process of refining, suddenly assumes an appearance of great brilliancy, when purified, and reflects objects like a mirror. But ah! how much of earthly mould, Dark relics of the mine, Lost from the ore must he behold; How long must he refine, Ere in the silver he can trace The first faint semblance to his face. Thou great Refiner! sit thou by Thy promise to fulfil: Moved by thy hand, beneath thine eye, And melted at thy will, O, may thy work forever shine, Reflecting beauty pure as thine! THE WATERFALL. Ye mighty waters, that have joined your forces, Roaring and dashing with this awful sound, Here are ye mingled; but the distant sources Whence ye have issued, where shall they be found? Who may retrace the ways that ye have taken, Ye streams and drops? who separate you all, And find the many places ye 've forsaken, To come and rush together down the fall? Through thousand, thousand paths have ye been roaming, In earth and air, who now each other urge To the last point! and then, so madly foaming, Leap down at once, from this stupendous verge. Some in the lowering cloud a while were centred, That in the stream beheld its sable face, And melted into tears, that, falling, entered With sister waters on the sudden race. Others, to light that beamed upon the fountain, Have from the vitals of the rock been freed, In silver threads, that, shining down the mountain, Twined off among the verdure of the mead. And many a flower that bowed beside the river, In opening beauty, ere the dew was dried, Stirred by the breeze, has been an early giver Of her pure offering to the rolling tide. Thus from the veins, through earth's dark bosom pouring, Many have flowed in tributary streams; Some, in the bow that bent, the sun adoring, Have shone in colors borrowed from his beams. But He, who holds the ocean in the hollow Of his strong hand, can separate you all! His searching eye the secret way will follow, Of every drop that hurries to the fall! We are, like you, in mighty torrents mingled, And speeding downward to one common home; Yet there 's an eye that every drop hath singled, And marked the winding ways through which we come. Those who have here adored the Sun of heaven, And shown the world their brightness drawn from him, Again before him, though their hues be seven, Shall blend their beauty, never to grow dim. We bless the promise, as we thus are tending Down to the tomb, that gives us hope to rise Before the Power to whom we now are bending, To stand his bow of glory in the skies! WINTER AND SPRING. “Adieu!” Father Winter sadly said To the world, when about withdrawing, With his old white wig half off his head, And his icicle fingers thawing. “Adieu! I am going to the rocks and caves, And must leave all here behind me; Or, perhaps I shall sink in the Northern waves, So deep that none can find me.” “Good luck! good luck, to your hoary locks!” Said the gay young Spring, advancing; You may take your rest mid the caves and rocks, While I o'er the earth am dancing. “But there is not a spot where your foot has trod, You hard, and clumsy old fellow, Not a hill, nor a field, nor a single sod, But I must make haste to mellow. “And then I shall carpet them o'er with grass, Which will look so bright and cheering, That none will regret that they let you pass Far out of sight and of hearing. “The fountains that you locked up so tight, When I shall give them a sunning, Will sparkle and play with my warmth and light, And the streams will set to running. “I'll speak in the earth to the palsied root, That under your reign was sleeping; I'll teach it the way in the dark to shoot, And draw out the vine to creeping. “The boughs, that you cased so close in ice It was chilling e'en to behold them, I'll deck all over with buds so nice My breath can alone unfold them. “And when all the trees are with blossoms dressed, The bird with her song so merry Will come to the branches to build her nest, With a view to the future cherry. “The earth will show by her loveliness, The wonders I am doing, While the skies look down, with a smile, to bless The way that I'm pursuing!” Said Winter, “Then I would have you learn By me, my gay new-comer, To push off too, when it comes your turn And yield your place to Summer!” FOLLY MADE LEFT-HANDED. Wit was fairly tired of play; And the little archer lay On a grassy bank, one day, By a gurgling river. Here, he thought he 'd take a nap, And to guard them from mishap, In his mantle he would wrap His golden bow and quiver. Scarce a moment had he slept, Ere upon his finger stepped Some one, who was no adept In the art of creeping. Wit was ever quick to feel, Soon he knew the heavy heel— Folly came his bow to steal, While he thought him sleeping. He arose, and, “now” said he, “Let my bow and arrows be, Till their use you learn of me, Folly, I beseech you! But, if you would know my art, And be skilful with the dart, Let 's a moment stand apart, So that I may teach you.” Folly moved a pace or two; Wit took aim, and quickly drew— “Whiz!” the arrow went, and flew, Fastening in his shoulder. “Oh!” cried Folly, “Oh! I'm dead! Wounded both in heart and head!” “You will live,” Wit smiling said, “To be ages older. “Banish every vain alarm, You receive no other harm Than a useless, palsied arm, For an hour of fooling. Hence, of that right hand bereft, Folly, you must use your left, A memento of your theft, And my timely schooling!” Wisdom saw the war begin 'Twixt the two so near akin, And she would, by stepping in, Fain have made them wiser. But, she was repelled by both, Who, alike incensed and loath To be tutored, took an oath Ever to despise her. SUNRISE TO THE SLAVE. Sun, from thy bed in the sea, Each morning I see thee arise; But what is thy glory to me, Whose days are but measured by sighs? The fringe of thy robe I behold Spread warm o'er the quivering wave, But feel all is cheerless and cold, And night, in the breast of the slave. When nature from slumber springs up, And the freshness of morning regains, I see all the gall in my cup; I feel all the weight of my chains. For, not till thy splendor, bright sun, Has faded and gone, in the west, From toil ere thy rising begun Is the spirit-worn bondman to rest. Shall He, whose pure image thou art, Be named by the impious tongue Of one, who can banquet his heart On groans from humanity wrung? Can He, who is brightness divine, Whose wings waft but healing and balm, Behold a hand raised at his shrine, With slavery marked on its palm? Make haste, thou great day of account, When the Light of the world shall appear, Recalling his word on the mount, And avenging the sufferer here! Speed! speed, star of day, through the route By nature allotted to thee! When thou from the skies art struck out, Will come that blest Sunrise to me! DEATH OF SIR WALTER SCOTT. Dead! Is he then silent, and pale and cold, Like common, unenveid clay? That golden bowl broken, and loosed the hold Of the silver cord?—as a tale that 's told, Has that brilliant star passed away? Has the great magician so soon resigned The wand that he used at will, To move the springs of the strongest mind, The deepest fount of the soul to find, And the world by its touch to thrill? It parted the sable waves that sweep Across oblivion's sea, And brought up to light, from that fearful deep, The things that for ages it had to keep, In their primal identity. It broke the seal of the secret tomb!— It opened the graves of men, It made their ashes their fire resume, And touched them with beauty and life and bloom, Till they breathed and they moved again! Time! what hast thou to do with one, Who knew not a wasted hour— Whose pen with the sands of thy glass could run And show at each turning a miracle done, A work that defies thy power? And bright is the lustre his hand has shed O'er the world that must claim him still; For, though from our vision his form has fled, His mind is here, and we own not dead, What death has not power to kill. No—while the earth for the tale of wo Has a bosom to heave a sigh; An eye to beam, or a heart to glow At the debt of joy that to thee we owe, Sir Walter, thou canst not die! Thou 'lt still give wings to the lonely hour, A spell to the calm retreat,— Thou 'lt be the charm in the lady's bower, And life's rude path with many a flower Bestrew for the pilgrim's feet! Yes, mighty spirit! most warm and free Are our thanks for so blest a lot, As gave us our day upon earth with thee; And thousands and thousands, yet to be, Will honor the Shade of Scott! IMITATIONS OF THE SCOTTISH. ADDRESS TO AN INFANT. Wee, bonnie bud, how didst thou dare To shoot amid this scene o' care; Upon the shore o' time to stand A' feeble frae thy Maker's hand; Where thou maun tak' the dews that fa', The frosts that chill, the blasts that blaw; While mony a tint o' sun an' shade Will on thy tender leaves be laid, As they are openin' saft an' new, A' spotless, to receive their hue? Thou art a lovely, shinin' gem, Alane upon thy parent stem; Where Heaven permit thee lang to bide, Its joy, its ornament an' pride! An' may this warld o' vice and pain, Withhaud frae thee its blight an' stain, An' let thee catch unsullied dyes, An' draw thine odors frae the skies! Avert thee frae the noisome weed, An' let thy heart nae canker feed; But keep thy health an' strength secure— Thy head erect—thy bosom pure; That he, wha gied the blossom birth, May hae the fruit mature frae earth! THE SILLER PEN. I tell you what! twixt frien' an' frien', I dinna like the siller pen. An', sin' my reason ye wad ken, Tho' odd enough, I'll gie it. It is too perfect—ilka part It does, is wi' sic care an' art, There 's nae a particle o' heart Or feelin' gangin wi' it! 'T is nae the siller I despise; For poortith loud an' daily cries; An', if I had but mair supplies, I 'd then feel a' the better. But, tho' 't wad truly glad my een To see its bright an' cheerfu' sheen, My purse's hollow sides between, Ise shun it in the letter! I wad na see the new-born thought, Laid on the sheet, sae stiff an straught, As if 't were dead, an' cauld; an' brought Before me for interment. I like the gracefu', yieldin nib, To gang sae careless an' sae glib, An' shoot my fancies, like a squib, Just while they 're in the ferment! An', whiles (ye 've, aiblins, felt the pain,) I wait upon the tardy brain For something I can ne'er obtain, An' founder'd a' thegither; I like, if I can do nae mair, To hae the quill to scrape an' pare, An' find the faut o' dullness there, In honest Goosie's feather. For nature's laws maun be obey'd, An' this is ane she strictly laid On ilka saul she ever made, Down frae our earliest mither: “Be sel your first an' greatest care— Frae a' reproach the darlin spare, An' ony blame, that she should bear, Pit off upon anither!” Had nature ta'en a second thought, A better precept she had taught; An' guid instead o' evil wrought By those the power possessin! For, sel had been pit out o' sight, The love o' ithers brought to light: In short, the wrang had a' been right, An' man to man a blessin! EPISTLE TO A FRIEND. The sun, my frien,' has reached the west, And now the pensive gloamin, Wi' thoughts o' a' I lo'e the best, Is fast upon me comin; Sae, now I tak my fitfu' pen, Ere yet the stars are blinkin, And set me down to let ye ken On whom I maist am thinkin. Sin dearest friends maun often part, He well deserved a blessin, Wha taught the warld the scribblin art, Sae richly worth possessin; For when awa our lo'ed anes gang, By this we proof can gie 'em, That to our hearts, nae gate's sae lang But they can gang it wi' 'em. My Musie 's coy, as ye maun see, And mickle seeks to shun me; But, Ise just keep her i' my e'e, Tho, she may quite outrun me. And should my verse be unco lame, I hope ye'll na reject it, But tak' it a' in friendship's name; And, charity protect it! I hope ye 're well, an' braw, an' gay, An' thinkin o' returnin— That ye'll come hame as blithe as May, And rosy as its mornin; And when we get ye safely back, A' fu' o' glee to find ye; To see ye smile, an' hear ye crack, 'Bout things ye 've left behind ye. I fain wad think o' something new Wi' us, that 's worth disclosin, But havin sma' or nought to do, Our warld has fa'en a dozin. And life is like a standin pool, Sae void o' sound an' motion, Ye 'd think the betherel, wi' his shool, Had paid us a' devotion. Wi' mickle loss o' this warld's gear The hand o' Gude has tried us, And wealth an' commerce languish here, And seem a' maist denied us. Our dwellins, as ye've seen o' late, Leuk waur for time an' weather; They and their ainers ha'e ane gate An' meet decay thegither. But nature's warks are bright an' fair, Tho' art's are gaun to ruin, As if she 'd mak' some kind repair Where poortith's haun's undoin. For, greener grass was never prest Aneath the foot o' Adam, Nor sweeter flowers could e'er ha'e drest The bosom o' his madam, Than those that spring an' bud an' blaw, A beauteous garment throwin O'er ilka chink an' broken wa', To keep the gaps fra showin. And clear our sparklin burnie glides, While down to ocean gangin, As if, along its shinin sides, A' Eden's fruits were hangin. Our trees wi' shade our walks supply, While scorchin heat oppresses; And when the simmer sun 's gaen by, They doff their coolin' dresses. Our bonnie birds their boughs amang Their artless sangs are singin, And daily to their callow young Some kind refreshment bringin. And, when as now, the night is seen O'er a' creation closin, Within their nest they close their een, Their weary wings reposin. And could I tell our birdies' dreams, Perchance they might amuse ye, But tho' sae sma' the favor seems, 'T is what I maun refuse ye. For 't is sae late, the siller moon Has spread her shinin banner; By her an' a' that 's bright aboon, I'm still your constant Hannah. P.S. My name was ne'er, I need nae tell, A ward to sair the poet, And, but for this, ye bear 't yoursel, In verse I wad nae show it! GREETIN MARY. “Where are ye gaun sae lane an' late, While fast the dew fa's o'er the lea? Say, lassie, hae ye tint your gate, That hangs sic pearls at either e'e?” “Ah! no—my path I ken fu' weel, For oft it feels my lanely feet; At ilka gloamin hour I steal To ane dear spot to sigh an' greet. “'T is there I haste these tears to drap Among the tall, saft grass that sweeps Alang the clods o' earth's hard lap, Where, pale an' cauld, my Jemmie sleeps. “The lee-lang day I wear a smile, To hide the marks o' dool an' care; But wish this achin heart, the while, Wad bleed to death an' throb nae mair. “But, when the e'enin shades draw near, An' nane my dreary gate may tent, When, why I roam, there 's nane to spier, To yon green grave my steps are bent. “An' there my Jemmie's ghaist I meet, To talk o' joys forever fled; I pour my sorrows forth like weet, An' lang to mingle wi' the dead! “Ah! why does fate delight to break The warmest hearts—the strongest ties? Why will not earth my ashes tak' An' let my saul to Jemmie rise?” THE BELLWORT. Look up, look up, thou timid thing, Nor let thy head sae pensive hing! I am nae tyrant come to wring Thee frae the earth. Thou art the daughter o' a King— O' royal birth! An' he wha fashioned me to think, Maks suns to shine, an' starnies blink— Gies ilka root in earth its drink An' daily fare! So, dinna fear he'll let thee sink Below his care. For, tho' he formed thy slender bell To drap within the laighlie dell, He kens an' lo'es thee just as well As the tall tree, That, proud as if it made itsel Towers over thee. An', wha that sees his finger move, To turn the spheres that roll above, Will need a word o' mine to prove That, in his sight, Thou an' the cedar o' the grove Are like in height? But then, he 'd hae thee be content To live an' die where thou wert sent; An' ne'er get a' unwisely bent To quit the place Whilk thy Creator ever meant That thou should'st grace. Like thee, should ilka virtuous mind, Where fa's its lot, there be resign'd, Tho' humble here, it soon will find That in the sequel, The haughtiest laird o' human kind Is but its equal! TO AUTUMN. By the sorrowfu' look o' the hill an' the glen, A' stripp'd o' the pride o' the simmer again, I ken ye hae come wi' your hoarse, rude breath, And pit the green grass an' sweet flowers a' to death. Ye wad nae gie a drop o' bright glistenin dew To soften the spot where the violet grew— An' drooping an' pale, she has pillow'd her head Mid your cauld, cauld frost, on her hard death-bed. The bird wi' her sang, ye hae bidden to flee Frae the comfortless branch o' the shiverin tree; While, restless an' harmless, the yellow leaves fly 'Twixt the dool o' the earth and the scowl o' the sky! Ye hae torn the fond tendrils, that closely wad twine To haud up their parent, the languishin vine, An', there 's nae a sweet thing the mild simmer could cherish, But your sharp fingers nip, till ye ken it maun perish. An', when ye hae finished your pitiless doins, An' the fields are a' scattered wi' death an' wi' ruins, Cauld winter will come, wi' his snaw an' his sleet, To hide them frae sight wi' a white windin-sheet. How mickle to man are misfortune an' grief, Like yoursel to the earth, when ye part branch an' leaf! For when the cauld blasts o' adversity blaw, Every sweet flower o' joy frae his bosom maun fa'. Wi' care he is wasted, an' weary, an' worn— The ties o' affection are loosened an' torn, Till the spark o' his life, 'mid the ruins, will fail, An' his ashes are gien to the clods o' the vale. Yet, he may go down in full hope o' the dawn, Ayont the dark tomb, o' eternity's morn; Where your stern chillin features nae mair will be seen, An' the flowers are a' deathless—the fields ever green. THE SEALING WAX. Bright guardian o' the thoughts o' men! Sin I maun fasten up, an' sen' To ither een, the things my pen Has been about, I wish ye, just for surety's sake, To blaze an' rin, then stap an' take My seal, to bind ye na to break, An' let them out. For, be my whimsies great or sma', I wad na let them loose, to fa' Where a' the idle wins that blaw, To whirl the stoure, May toss them round from mou to mou, Wi' different nature, form an' hue, To come frae ilk they 're hurried through, An' a' ground o'er. This warld 's a curious ane enough; An', weel supplied wi' kindling-stuff, It winna quench, while it can puff The reekin flax. An' what could pass through smoke an' flame, An' like yoursel, come out the same, In beauty, virtue, hue an' name, My cannie wax? I wadna ca' the warld unfair, Or wrang it in a single hair; But, wha kens maist o't, kens the mair How oft it slips, For want o' rectitude or thought, Sae far upon the side o' faut, That truth is seldom pure or straught Between its lips. I winna judge the warld's intent; But then, its een are sae asklent, The fairest things leuk foul an' bent, The foulest, fair. I canna, therefore, now foresee What sort o' things my thoughts wad be, If robbed o' their identity By gettin' air. Gin folk wad kindly let alane A neighbor's wark, to tent their ain, Ye wad na hae to thus sustain A martyr's fate, By bein' burnt to prove how fast Ye'll haud your virtue to the last, Like precious gowd, until ye 're past Your distant gate. But, sin I hope the world will men', We winna let it ever ken What I hae whispered as a frien', Tho' strictly true. Gang now, an' guard these secrets weel! May ane, who breaks ye, ca' ye “leal,” For what, when broken, ye reveal! Adieu! Adieu! THE END.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME II. THE LAKE OF KILLARNEY. In Erin's verdant, ocean isle A shining lake is seen, Where many an islet peers the while, To stud the lake with green. And these are crowned with tree and flower, And vine, or ruins gray, That show where human art and power Have been, and passed away. They're edged with grass, or fringing brake, Or moss, or beetling cliff; And, round between them, on the lake There dances many a skiff. The boatman's hardy hand propels His boat with varying oar, While stories wild and strange he tells, About the things of yore. And, if you touch that hand with gold Or silver, you shall find, A smoother tale was never told, Than he will soon unwind. But then no sign of secret doubt, About what may be said, From lip or eye must venture out, As this would snap the thread. For, though he may in truth believe The things he tells to you, Or not, 't is fit that you receive Each syllable as true. In sooth, the honest boatman seems A man sincere, and acts Like one, who, often telling dreams, Refines them into facts. He'll take you in his boat, and row Till fairly from the shore; Then fast his nimble tongue will go, And slow the lazy oar. And there, in haste to let you know How much is known to him, He'll tell you what is hid below The water that you skim. For, how Killarney's lake arose, His sober lips protest, That, if a son of Erin knows, Himself must know the best. And having paid his holy priest For past and future sins, And lived a saint through lent and feast, The tale he thus begins: “You see that in this spacious cave There's now a mighty flood; But once, as you've a soul to save, 'T was full of flesh and blood! “And now I row my trusty boat O'er heaps of human bones, That, by the waters where we float, Are hardened into stones! “For, here an ancient city shone In splendor, wealth, and pride; And that in power it stood alone, Can be by none denied. “'T was peopled by a noble clan Of brave and warlike men: If ever Erin had a man Of courage, it was then. “'T was governed by a mighty chief, The great O'Donaghue; And, just to give him in the brief, A mighty tyrant, too! “He was a man of giant size, Of odd, but rich attire, With haughty bearing, and his eyes,— They flashed like living fire. “He often led his men to fight, And led them safely back; But left the foes, that lived in flight, With blood upon their track. “For, when they saw his hordes advance, And knew him in the van, His very look was like a lance, To enter every man. “His eye was worth a thousand shafts, A thousand arms, his one! His will was like the wing that wafts The eagle to the sun! “And such the great O'Donaghue; And such the race of men, Whose like, if e'er creation knew, 'T will never know again! “And all that mortals ever need This noble clan possessed; For they had all to clothe and feed, And give the body rest. “But, still they lacked one thing, and this, The burden of their song, Was what no living thing can miss, And live to miss it long. “And ‘water! water!’ they would sing, And some for water call. They 'd neither well, nor brook, nor spring, Within their city wall. “At length, without, the streams were dry That brightened vale and hill, And then, from thirsty mouths, the cry Was ‘water! water!’ still. “Then came a great magician there, A man of power and skill, Who had the gift to answer prayer, And do the suppliant's will. “To him in crowds the people came, As pilgrims to a shrine; Approaching in St. Patrick's name, The man of gifts divine. “And water, water, was the thing For which they humbly bowed, Entreating him the boon to bring From either earth or cloud. “But still he answered not their call; For, in his searching sight, There was not one among them all Who asked that boon aright. “At length a little soft-eyed maid, With looks and voice to melt A rock to water, came and prayed, And, asking water, knelt. “A ring the great magician wore, Of gems so clear and bright, They looked like drops of dew before The rays of morning light. “Then, in the earth, from off his hand, He hid the sparkling ring, When, straightway from the burning sand Came forth a cooling spring! “And every one with parching lip, Who ran to fill his cup, Perceived that, fast as all could dip, The water bubbled up. “The great magician said, the spring Must every night, with care, Be covered close, or it would bring An evil none could bear. “And thus to let the spring be hid, He gave a shining gift— A large and massive silver lid, That none alone could lift. “Upon its surface, smooth and bright, Were strange devices traced; And o'er the water every night, With care 't was closely placed. “At morning it was set aside, To let the spring appear; And all the city was supplied With water fresh and clear. “At length, the proud O'Donaghue Began to jeer and scoff, Because the cover must go through This putting on and off. “‘I'll to my dwelling bid them take The shining lid,’ said he, ‘And turn it upside down, to make A silver bath for me.’ “He ordered then his men to bring The cover home to him; And quick with water from the spring To fill it to the brim. “But all implored him not to touch The lid with this intent, Because the giver's charge was such They dreaded what it meant. “‘Away!” replied the chief, in wrath, ‘Ye cowards, from my sight! For I will have my silver bath Before I sleep to-night. “‘So off, to get the cover, go! The water will but be The cooler, if the night winds blow Upon it fresh and free.’ “Then, when they went, as they were bid, To do the stern commands, It set the figures on the lid To stirring in their hands. “And reptile, bird, and beast began To move, and writhe, and twist, As if to caution every man Who bore them, to desist! “The scaly serpent showed a sting, And, hissing, seemed to say, They 'd rue the hour, when from the spring They bore the lid away. “When, by their chief, with water filled, They left it, to retire, Their breasts were some with horror chilled, And others burnt with ire. “But every clansman sought his home, And saw the fall of night, With gloomy thoughts of what might come Before the morning light. “They feared that earthquake, fire, or wind, Or famine, or the sword, Would punish all who did not mind The great magician's word. “Then one sad, solitary man Escaped from out the gate, And, to a hill, in secret, ran, To mark the city's fate. “At midnight hour, when all was still, And not a leaf was stirred, That lonely watchman, on the hill, The shrieks of anguish heard. “And ‘water! water!’ was the cry, That from the city broke, In voices that were wild and high, And mortal terror spoke. “It was a solemn, awful sound, For one alone to hear, As through the hills it echoed round, Then died upon the ear. “'T was but a little while, and all Was over with the clan! For, not within the city wall Was there a living man! “The spring had bubbled up and swelled, And to a deluge spread, Till now the silent dwellings held But water and the dead! “And still the waters spread and grew, Till, in a single night, This mighty lake arose to view, A city sunk from sight! “And, when the deep is calm and clear, These little isles between The walls and dwellings buried here, May yet, in part, be seen. “But often, when the raging storm Is now about to wake, A cloudy boat and spirit form Will sail above the lake. “They say, 't is old O'Donaghue, Who haunts the waters still, And having nothing good to do, Is busied yet with ill. “The costly bath, wherein he died, Is turned to silver mist; But still upon its bright outside The serpents crawl and twist. “The boatmen shun his troubled path Across the frowning flood, For he is still a son of wrath, Though not of flesh and blood! “On yonder rock there sits a man, Who saw him yesterday, An hour before the storm began, That drove his boat away! “Now, when your honor likes to take Another pleasant sail, To view the islands of the lake, I'll tell another tale.” THE STARS AND THE FALLING DEW. The sun, like a hero, whose chariot rolled In glory, has reached the west; And wrapped in his mantle of crimson and gold, Has sunken away to rest. The stars from the skies Look forth like the eyes Of Angels, the earth to view; While timid and soft, Their light form aloft, Comes down with the falling dew. The flowers, that, oppressed by the monarch of day, Have bowing confessed his power, Are lifting their foreheads, relieved of his ray, To the cool of the evening hour. And each holding up Her emerald cup, Her delicate draught to renew, Their trust is repaid, While their thirst is allayed By the drops of the falling dew. The birds are at rest in their own little homes, Their songs are forgotten in sleep; And low and uncertain the murmuring comes From over the slumbering deep. The breezes that sighed Have fainted and died In the boughs they were quivering through, And motion and sound Have ceased from around To yield to the falling dew. And gently it comes, as the shadowy wing Of night o'er the earth is unfurled; A silent, refreshing and spirit-like thing, To brighten and solace the world! As the face of a friend, When in sorrow we bend— Like a heart ever tender and true, When darkness is ours, To the earth and the flowers, Are the stars and the falling dew. THE GRASSHOPPER AND THE ANT. “Ant, look at me!” a young Grasshopper said, As nimbly he sprang from his green, summer bed, “See how I'm going to skip over your head, And could o'er a thousand like you! Ant, by your motion alone, I should judge That Nature ordained you a slave and a drudge, For ever and ever to keep on the trudge, And always find something to do. “Oh! there is nothing like having our day, Taking our pleasure and ease while we may, Bathing ourselves in the bright, mellow ray That comes from the warm, golden sun! While I am up in the light and the air, You, a sad picture of labor and care! Still have some hard, heavy burden to bear, And work that you never get done. “I have an exercise healthful, and good, For tuning the nerves and digesting the food— Graceful gymnastics for stirring the blood Without the gross purpose of use. Ant, let me tell you 't is not à la mode, To plod like a pilgrim and carry a load, Perverting the limbs that for grace were bestowed, By such a plebeian abuse. “While the whole world with provisions is filled, Who would keep toiling and toiling to build And lay in a store for himself, till he 's killed With work that another might do? Come! drop your budget, and just give a spring; Jump on a grass-blade, and balance and swing; Soon you'll be light as a gnat on the wing, Gay as a grasshopper, too!” Ant trudged along, while the grasshopper sung, Minding her business and holding her tongue, Until she got home her own people among; But these were her thoughts on the road. “What will become of that poor, idle one When the light sports of the summer are done? And, where is the covert to which he may run To find a safe winter abode? “Oh! if I only could tell him how sweet Toil makes my rest and the morsel I eat, While hope gives a spur to my little black feet, He 'd never pity my lot! He 'd never ask me my burden to drop, To join in his folly—to spring, and to hop; And thus make the ant and her labor to stop, When time, I am certain, would not. “When the cold frost all the herbage has nipped, When the bare branches with ice-drops are tipped, Where will the grasshopper then be, that skipped So careless and lightly to-day? Frozen to death! ‘a sad picture,’ indeed, Of reckless indulgence and what must succeed, That all his gymnastics ca 'nt shelter or feed, Or quicken his pulse into play. “I must prepare for a winter to come. I shall be glad of a home and a crumb, When my frail form out of doors would be numb, And I in the snow-storm should die. Summer is lovely, but soon will be past. Summer has plenty not always to last. Summer's the time for the ant to make fast Her stores for a future supply!” THE CATERPILLAR. “Don't kill me!” Caterpillar said, As Charles had raised his heel Upon the humble worm to tread, As though it could not feel. “Don't kill me! and I'll crawl away To hide awhile, and try To come and look, another day, More pleasing to your eye. “I know I'm now among the things Uncomely to your sight; But by and by on splendid wings You'll see me high and light! “And then, perhaps, you may be glad To watch me on the flower; And that you spared the worm you had To-day within your power!” Then Caterpillar went and hid In some secreted place, Where none could look on what he did To change his form and face. And by and by, when Charles had quite Forgotten what I 've told, A Butterfly appeared in sight, Most beauteous to behold. His shining wings were trimmed with gold, And many a brilliant dye Was laid upon their velvet fold, To charm the gazing eye! Then, near as prudence would allow, To Charles's ear he drew And said, “You may not know me, now My form and name are new! “But I'm the worm that once you raised Your ready foot to kill! For sparing me, I long have praised, And love and praise you still. “The lowest reptile at your feet, When power is not abused, May prove the fruit of mercy sweet, By being kindly used!” THE CAPTIVE BUTTERFLY. Good morning, pretty Butterfly! How have you passed the night? I hope you 're gay and glad as I To see the morning light. But, little silent one, methinks You 're in a sober mood. I wonder if you 'd like to drink, And what you take for food. I shut you in my crystal cup, To let your winglets rest. And now I want to hold you up, To see your velvet vest. I want to count your tiny toes, To find your breathing-place, And touch the downy horn that grows Each side your pretty face. I 'd like to see just how you 're made, With streaks and spots and rings; And wish you 'd show me how you played Your shining, rainbow wings. “'T was not,” the little prisoner said, “For want of food or drink, That, while you slumbered on your bed, I could not sleep a wink. “My wings are pained for want of flight, My lungs, for want of air. In bitterness I 've passed the night, And meet the morning's glare. “When looking through my prison wall, So close, and yet so clear, I see there 's freedom there for all, While I'm a captive here. “I 've stood upon my feeble feet Until they're full of pain. I know that liberty is sweet, Which I cannot regain. “Do I deserve a fate like this, Who 've ever acted well, Since first I left the chrysalis, And fluttered from my shell? “I 've never injured fruit, or flower, Or man, or bird, or beast; And such a one should have the power Of going free, at least. “And now, if you will let me quit My prison-house, the cup, I'll show you how I sport and flit, And make my wings go up!” The lid was raised; the prisoner said, “Behold my airy play!” Then quickly on the wing he fled Away, away, away! From flower to flower he gaily flew, To cool his aching feet, And slake his thirst with morning dew, Where liberty was sweet. THE BEE, CLOVER, AND THISTLE. A Bee from her hive one morning flew, A tune to the day-light humming; And away she went, o'er the clear, bright dew, Where the grass was green, the violet blue, And the gold of the sun was coming. And what first tempted the roving Bee Was a head of the crimson clover. “I 've found a treasure betimes!” said she, “And perhaps a greater I might not see, If I travelled the field all over. “My beautiful clover, so round and red, There is not a thing in twenty That lifts this morning so sweet a head Above its leaves and its earthy bed, With so many horns of plenty!” The flow'rets were thick, which the clover crowned, As the plumes in the helm of Hector, And each had a cell that was deep and round; Yet it would not impart, as the bee soon found, One drop of its precious nectar. She cast in her eye where the honey lay, And her pipe she began to measure; But she saw at once, it was clear as day, That it would not go down one half the way To the place of the envied treasure. Said she in a pet, “One thing I know,” As she rose in haste and departed, “It is not those of the greatest show, To whom for a favor 't is best to go, Or that prove most generous-hearted!” A fleecy flock came into the field, And one of its members followed The scent of the clover, till between Her nibbling teeth its head was seen, And then in a moment swallowed. “Ha, ha!” said the Bee, as the clover died, “Her fortune's smile was fickle! And now I can get my wants supplied By a humble flower with a rough outside, And even a scale and prickle.” Then she flew to one that by man and beast Was shunned for its pointed bristle; But it injured not the bee in the least; And she filled her pocket, and had a feast From the bloom of the purple Thistle. The generous Thistle's life was spared In the home where the Bee first found her; Till she grew so old she was hoary-haired, And her snow-white locks with the silk compared, As they shone where the sun beamed round her. THE WILD VIOLET. Violet, violet, sparkling with dew, Down in the meadow-land wild where you grew, How did you come by the beautiful blue With which your soft petals unfold? And how do you hold up your tender, young head, When rude, sweeping winds rush along o'er your bed, And dark, gloomy clouds, ranging over you, shed Their waters so heavy and cold? No one has nursed you, or watched you an hour, Or found you a place in the garden or bower; And they cannot yield me so lovely a flower, As here I have found at my feet! Speak, my sweet violet! answer and tell How you have grown up and flourished so well, And look so contented where lowly you dwell, And we thus by accident meet! “The same careful hand,” the Violet said, “That holds up the firmament, holds up my head! And He, who with azure the skies overspread Has painted the violet blue. He sprinkles the stars out above me by night, And sends down the sunbeams at morning with light To make my new coronet sparkling and bright, When formed of a drop of his dew! “I 've nought to fear from the black, heavy cloud, Or the breath of the tempest, that comes strong and loud! Where, born in the lowland, and far from the crowd, I know, and I live but for One. He soon forms a mantle about me to cast, Of long, silken grass, till the rain and the blast And all that seemed threatening have harmlessly passed, As the clouds scud before the warm sun!” THE DYING LAMP. Poor Dying Lamp! thou now art low and pale; Thine oil of life is out, thy purpose o'er; And thou art fainting, utterly to fail; In a few moments thou must be no more! The morning star has risen, and the dawn Hastens to chase the scattering shades away. They and thy feeble flame will soon be gone, And both forgotten in the glorious day. Well—thou hast done a kindly work to-night, And freely worn thyself away to shed Through the dark, silent chamber thy soft light, And show the watcher to the sick one's bed. A mild, bright minister of good to man, Wasting thyself for others, thou hast been, Since with the evening thy short life began, Till o'er the world the light of heaven pours in. But now thou art not needed thus to cast Thy beams around to cheer the wakeful eye; Since darkness with its solemn reign is past, Before the morning calmly dost thou die. Like thee, may she, who marked thy steady ray Through the hushed night, and then thy quick decline, Yield, while she treads life's short and shadowy way, Some cheering light, with purpose pure as thine! Then, when her work is finished—when her worth To others in their dark, sad hours shall cease, Not to survive it, may she pass from earth, And, like her dying lamp, go out in peace! THE BRIDEMAID. 'T is over! I have past the cruel test! Methinks I carried well the mask of joy, That frequent use had fitted to my face Too closely to be shaken by the throb Of a torn bosom. Yes, I chose the dove To fasten at my breast this chain of gems, A sign of peace within. Sad mockery! The dove was all without, and formed of stone! A heart that 's breaking at another's bliss Should burst without a groan; and mine I thank, That every string has snapped so silently, Quivered and bled unseen. Ye beauteous flowers, Behold your sisters in the cast-off wreath, That, pale and worthless, withers at my feet! They speak of her who wore them—ye, of one Who grew beside her: yet, the dew of grief Ne'er touched her bloom. My silent lute, farewell! Thy broken strings will never be restored. When next thy mistress sweeps the tuneful chord, May seraph voices mingle with the notes Where sorrow claims no strain! Poor, sickly pearls! How dim and pale ye look, trailed useless out! The hue of death is cast o'er every thing; And vanity is marked on all I see. On all! Oh, no! one blessed sign appears, A precious emblem to the eye of Faith! The holy cross, formed of these ocean gems. Lo! what a sudden lustre they assume! It came not from the deep! It is the smile Of Heaven upon the figure they show forth! With this before me, shall not purer love And higher hopes than feed on aught below Lead home my wildered soul? If Heaven will take A heart that earth has crushed, form it anew, And light it from on high, I offer mine, Not without shame, that all things else were tried Before the only balm. Look down, O Thou, Who wast at Cana! Bless the rite that's past! Help me to put a wedding garment on For the great marriage supper; and to wear Thy choice of ornaments, while I await The coming of the Bridegroom! THE MEETING. We met upon Mount Auburn, ere its sod Was strew'd with drops from sorrow's languid eye; Before its shadowy walks the mourner trod, Or to its balmy air released the sigh. The spot had just been rendered hallowed ground, By solemn rite and consecrating prayer: It bore no marble, heaved no sacred mound, But Nature reigned in placid beauty there. And as we stood, and viewed the peaceful scene, Our thought and converse on its purpose ran; And on the swiftness of the race, between The point of starting, and the goal of man. He plucked for me a branch, where, wide and high, The thick, green boughs around us hung a shade; But thought not, that his lips and beaming eye Must close forever, ere its leaves should fade. We never met again! The branch retained Its verdure, when his eye had lost its light. The vital flame within his bosom waned, And left it cold, while yet my branch was bright. A few short days—and he was on the deep, Whose swelling surges he should cross no more. In foreign earth the stranger's ashes sleep— His spirit walks the everlasting shore! But, we shall meet again! While, “dust to dust,” Of this frail house of clay may soon be said, Its tenant His unfailing word will trust, Whose second coming shall revive the dead. On that great morning may our meeting be Among the flowery hills without a grave, And in the shade of that unfading Tree, Whose boughs with healing for the nations wave! THE YOUNG SETTING MOON. The fair, young moon in a silver bow, Looks back from the bending west, Like a weary soul, that is glad to go To the long-sought place of rest. Her crescent lies in a beaming crown On the distant hill's dark head, Serene as the righteous looking down On the world, from his dying bed. Her rays, to our view, grow few and faint; Her light is at last withdrawn; And she, like a calmly departing saint, To her far-off home is gone. O! what could have made the moon so bright Till her work for the earth was done? 'T was the glory drawn from a purer light— From the face of the radiant sun! For she on her absent king could look, Whom the world saw not the while; Her face from his all its beauty took— She conveyed to the world his smile. By him, through night has the moon been led 'Mid the clouds that crossed the sky, While she drew her beams, o'er the earth to shed, From the god where she fixed her eye. And thus does Faith, 'mid her trials, view In the God to whom she clings A Sun, whose glories forever new, Unfold in his healing wings. 'T is He, who will guide our course aright, Though grief overcloud the heart; And it is but faith being lost in sight When the good from the earth depart. THE HIDDEN NAME. She loved; but her bosom had buried the dart; And there, while she strove to conceal it, Its point had engraven his NAME on her heart, Too deep for her lips to reveal it. She wept; but the world knew it not, for her eye Of joy's playful sunlight would borrow A few dazzling beams, when another was by, To drink up the dew-drops of sorrow. She grieved; and in secret the sigh would release, That long in her breast had been stifled. She pined; and in solitude mourned for the peace, Whereof her young heart had been rifled. She languished, and faded, and silently fell; And now in the tomb she is lying. While none that looked on could the malady tell, The flower in its beauty was dying! But, told was her secret on many a leaf, While cold was the hand that conveyed it, In lines that were broken and blotted with grief, Where Death, a pale spoiler! betrayed it. And yet, not a trace of the NAME can be found; With darkness and silence hung o'er it, The sacred engraving is hid in the ground, Locked up in the bosom that bore it! THE OLD ELM OF NEWBURY. Did ever it come in your way to pass The silvery pond, with its fringe of grass; And, threading the lane hard by, to see The veteran Elm of Newbury? You saw how its roots had grasped the ground, As if it had felt that the earth went round, And fastened them down with determined will To keep it steady, and hold it still. Its aged trunk, so stately and strong, Has braved the blasts, as they've rushed along; Its head has towered, and its arms have spread, While more than a hundred years have fled! Well, that old elm, that is now so grand, Was once a twig in the rustic hand Of a youthful peasant, who went one night To visit his love, by the tender light Of the modest moon and her twinkling host, While the star that lighted his bosom most, And gave to his lonely feet their speed, Abode in a cottage beyond the mead! 'T was the peaceful close of a summer's day; Its glorious orb had passed away; The toil of the field till the morn had ceased, For a season of rest to man and beast. The mother had silenced her humming wheel; The father returned, for the evening meal, The thanks of one, who had chosen the part Of the poor in spirit, the rich in heart, Who, having the soul's grand panacea, Feel all is added that's needful here; And know this truth of the human breast, That, wanting little is being blest. The good old man in his chair reclined, At a humble door, with a peaceful mind, While the drops from his sun-burnt brow were dried By the cool, sweet air of the eventide. The son from the yoke had unlocked the bow, Dismissing the faithful ox to go And graze in the close. He had called the kine For their oblation at day's decline. He 'd gathered and numbered the lambs and sheep, And fastened them up in their nightly keep. He 'd stood by the coop till the hen could bring Her huddling brood safe under her wing, And made them secure from the hooting owl, Whose midnight prey was the shrieking fowl. When all was finished, he sped to the well, Where the old gray bucket hastily fell; And the clear cold water came up to chase The dust of the field from his neck and face, And hands and feet, till the youth began To look renewed in the outer man; And, soon arrayed in his Sunday's best, The stiff new suit had done the rest; And the hale young lover was on his way, Where, through the fen and the field it lay, And over the bramble, the brake and the grass, As the shortest cut to the house of his lass. It is not recorded how long he staid In the cheerful home of the smiling maid; But when he came out, it was late and dark, And silent—not even a dog would bark, To take from his feeling of loneliness, And make the length of his way seem less. He thought it was strange, that the treacherous moon Should have given the world the slip so soon; And, whether the eyes of the girl had made The stars of the sky in his own to fade, Or not, it certainly seemed to him That each grew distant, and small, and dim; And he shuddered to think he now was about To take a long and a lonely route; For he did not know what fearful sight Might come to him through the shadows of night! An Elm grew close by the cottage's eaves; So, he plucked him a twig well clothed with leaves, And sallying forth with the supple arm, To serve as a talisman parrying harm, He felt that, though his heart was so big, 'T was even the stouter for having the twig. For this, he thought, would answer to switch The horrors away, as he crossed the ditch, The meadow and copse, wherein, perchance, Will-o'-the-wisp might wickedly dance; And, wielding it, keep him from having a chill At the menacing sound of “Whip-poor-will!” And his flesh from creeping beside the bog At the harsh, bass voice of the viewless frog: In short, he felt that the switch would be Guard, plaything, business, and company. When he got safe home, and joyfully found He still was himself! and living! and sound! He planted the twig by his family cot, To stand as a monument, marking the spot It helped him to reach; and, what was still more, Because it had grown by his fair one's door. The twig took root; and as time flew by, Its boughs spread wide, and its head grew high; While the priest's good service had long been done, Which made the youth and the maiden one; And their young scions arose and played Around the tree, in its leafy shade. But many and many a year has fled Since they were gathered among the dead; And now their names, with the moss o'ergrown, Are veiled from sight on the church-yard stone That leans away, in a lingering fall, And owns the power that shall level all The works that the hand of man hath wrought; Bring him to dust, and his name to nought. While, near in view, and just beyond The grassy skirts of the silver pond, In its “green old age,” stands the noble tree. The veteran Elm of Newbury. CHANGES ON THE DEEP. A gallant ship! and trim and tight, Across the deep she speeds away, While mantled with the golden light The sun throws back, at close of day. And who, that sees that stately ship Her haughty stem in ocean dip, Has ever seen a prouder one Illumined by a setting sun? The breath of summer, sweet and soft, Her canvass swells, while, wide and fair, And floating from her mast aloft, Her flag plays off on gentle air. And, as her steady prow divides The waters to her even sides, She passes, like a bird, between The peaceful deep and sky serene. And now grave twilight's tender veil The moon, with shafts of silver, rends; And down on billow, deck and sail Her placid lustre gently sends. The stars, as if the arch of blue Were pierced to let the glory through, From their bright world look out and win The thoughts of man to enter in. And many a heart that 's warm and true That noble ship bears on with pride; While 'mid the many forms, are two Of passing beauty, side by side. A fair young mother standing by Her bosom's lord, has fixed her eye With his, upon the blessed star That points them to their home afar. Their thoughts fly forth to those, who there Are waiting now, with joy to hail The moment that shall grant their prayer, And heave in sight their coming sail. For, many a time the changeful queen Of night has vanished, and been seen Since, o'er a foreign shore to roam, They passed from that dear, native home. The babe, that on its father's breast Has let its little eyelids close, The mother bears below to rest, And sinks with it in sweet repose. The while a sailor climbs the shroud, And in the distance spies a cloud: Low, like a swelling seed, it lies, From which the towering storm shall rise. The powers of air are now about To muster from their hidden caves; The winds unchained come rushing out, And into mountains heap the waves. Upon the sky the darkness spreads! The tempest on the ocean treads; And yawning caverns are its track Amid the waters wild and black. Its voice—but, who shall give the sounds Of that dread voice?—The ship is dashed In roaring depths—and now, she bounds On high, by foaming surges lashed. And how is she the storm to bide? Its sweeping wings are strong and wide! The hand of man has lost control O'er her!—his work is for the soul! She 's in a scene of nature's war. The winds and waters are at strife; And both with her contending for The brittle thread of human life That she contains; while sail and shroud Have yielded; and her head is bowed. Then, who that slender thread shall keep, But He, whose finger moves the deep? A moment—and the angry blast Has done its work and hurried on. With parted cables, shivered mast; With riven sides, and anchor gone, Behold the ship in ruin lie; While from the waves a piercing cry Surmounts the tumult high and wild, And sounds to heaven, “My child! my child!” The mother in the whelming surge Lifts up her infant o'er the sea, While lying on the awful verge Where time unveils eternity— And calls to Mercy from the skies, To come and rescue, while she dies, The gift that, with her fleeting breath, She offers from the gates of death. It is a call for Heaven to hear. Maternal fondness sends above A voice, that in her Father's ear Shall enter quick, for God is love. In such a moment, hands like these Their Maker with their offering sees; And for the faith of such a breast He will the blow of death arrest! The moon looks pale from out the cloud, While Mercy's angel takes the form Of him, who, mounted on the shroud, Was first to see the coming storm. The SAILOR has a ready arm To bring relief, and cope with harm. Though rough his hand, and nerved with steel, His heart is warm and quick to feel. And see him, as he braves the frown, That sky and sea each other give! Behold him where he plunges down, That child and mother yet may live, And plucks them from a closing grave! They 're saved! they're saved! the maddened wave Leaps foaming up to find its prey, Snatched from its mouth and borne away. They're saved! they 're saved! but where is he, Who lulled his fearless babe to sleep? A floating plank on that wild sea Has now his vital spark to keep! But, by the wan, affrighted moon, Help comes to him; and he is soon Upon the deck with living men To clasp that smiling boy again. And now can He, who only knows Each human breast, behold alone What pure and grateful incense goes From that sad wreck to his high throne. The twain, whose hearts are truly one, Will early teach their prattling son Upon his little heart to bear The SAILOR to his God, in prayer:— “O, Thou, who in thy hand dost hold The winds and waves, that wake or sleep, Thy tender arms of mercy fold Around the seamen on the deep! And, when their voyage of life is o'er, May they be welcomed to the shore, Whose peaceful streets with gold are paved, And angels sing, ‘They're saved! they're saved!’” THE ROBIN'S HYMN. My Maker, I know not the place of thy home; If 't is earth or the sky, or the sea. I only can tell, that, wherever I roam, I 've still a kind Father in thee. I feel that, at night, when I go to my rest, Thy wings all around me are flung; And peaceful I sleep, while the down of thy breast Is o'er me, as mine o'er my young. And when in the morning I open my eye, I find thou hast long been awake: Thy beautiful plumage seems spread o'er the sky, And painted again on the lake. Thy breath has gone into the buds; and the flowers Have opened to thee on their stems; And thou the bright dew-drops hast sent down in showers To glitter like thousands of gems. Thy voice, with the notes that can only be thine— A music 't is gladness to hear, Comes through the green boughs of the oak and the pine, And falls sweet and soft on my ear. And many a time hast thou stood between me And the arrow, that aimed at my heart; For, though in a form that my eye could not see, I know thou hast parried the dart. I drink from the drops on the grass and the vine, And gratefully gather my food: I feel thou hast plenty for me and for mine;— That all things declare thou art good. My Father, thy pinions are ever unfurled, With brightness no changes can dim! My Maker, thy home is all over the world: Thou 'lt hear then, thy Robin's low hymn! THE FLY IN THE GLASS LAMP. Ah! thou lost, unwary thing, Flutt'ring with a tortured wing— Crying, with thy little feet Scorch'd amid surrounding heat! Poor, unhappy, suffering fly, What a painful death to die! Since, so rashly thou hast strayed 'Twixt the funnel and the shade, In the fiery prison lost, Now thy life must pay the cost Of venturing too near the glare, Dazzling to allure thee there! Oh! it fills my heart with pain, Thus to see thee strive in vain For escape; for I, alas! Am too small to lift the glass. Mother says I must not take Things my little hands might break. Here she comes! but 't is too late! Thou, poor thing, hast met thy fate. Motion ceases—life has fled— Dropping on the table, dead: Now I see thee, thoughtless fly! 'T was a foolish death to die. “Yes, my child, in careless play, Thus his life is thrown away. For a thing that pleased the eye He rushed onward but to die! Yet, remember, there was none Warning him the blaze to shun. “If thou think'st the untaught flies, For their errors, so unwise, Let this insect's fall be hence From temptation thy defence! On thy heart a picture stamp Of the fly about the lamp!” THE BEE AND THE CHILD. Come here, little Bee, There are fresh flowers by me; Come, and just let me see How your honey is made! “I can 't, for I fear That, for coming too near, I should pay very dear, So I can 't—I'm afraid!” O, feel no alarm; Not a leg, nor an arm, Nor a wing will I harm. You may here sip your fill. “Pretty maid, then I'll come Close beside you, and hum, And you shall have some Of the sweets I distil.” Then my trust shall be free As yours is in me; And be sure, little Bee, That you do 'nt use your sting! “Oh! no! no!—since I flew From the cell, where I grew, None has known me to do So ungrateful a thing!” Then why thus supplied With a sting, but to hide And to keep it untried, Out of sight, little Bee? “He, who gave me my sting And my swift gauzy wing, Bids me not harm a thing That would not injure me!” THE BED ON THE BEACH. By what rude waves hast thou been tossed, To gain this quiet beach? What wide-spread waters hast thou crossed, This peaceful shore to reach? An awful secret dost thou tell About the yawning deep, That, while her billows war and swell, They most profoundly keep. Thou speak'st of one whose weary frame Has sought repose on thee; But not of kindred, home or name, Sad outcast of the sea! Thou giv'st no record of his birth, No token of the clime, Where he was last a child of earth, Or when he passed from time. And who must now, on some far shore, Await the coming sail Of him, they will behold no more Till mortal sight shall fail? For fearful things dost thou present Before the spirit's view; The shattered bark! the canvass rent! The helpless, dying crew! Of one dread scene the fatal whole, In thought, I hear and see. It chills my blood—it makes my soul Grow sick to look at thee. “The seas must render up their dead!” Is all thou dost reply; While o'er thee, cold and restless bed, The tide rolls proud and high! The guilty deep is taking back The witness of her wrath, To bury it with every track That marks its troubled path! THE HALF-MAST FLAG. How slow yon bark moves o'er the trembling wave, While her low flag the sighing breezes sweep! She comes, a mourner, from the new-made grave Of him, whom she has buried in the deep. With sorrow heavy laden, she appears; Beneath its weight must many a spirit bend! For hope's last ray she comes to quench in tears At once, for parent, brother, sister, friend. Their loved one she has left upon her way!— Low she has laid him in an ocean tomb, With wat'ry mountains o'er his youthful clay, Where human sight shall never pierce the gloom. To eyes that oft have sought her coming sail, That they again might rest with joy on him, Her silent signal tells the fearful tale, While inward anguish turns their vision dim. Edwin! can virtue, promise, early worth, And warm affection, such as thine depart? Can one like thee be summoned from the earth, And yet, the living lay it not to heart? Oh! there is sadness where thy face was seen, And lamentation where thy voice was known, From those who feel the gate of death between Thy bright, immortal spirit, and their own. And, like the wailing surges of the sea, That o'er thy sleeping clay, unceasing roll, Sorrow's dark waves, to those who mourn for thee, Rise in their might, to overwhelm the soul. Yet, woe is but for them. For thee, above Is joy unmingled, which the blessed know! Thy voice is tuned to praise eternal love, While sighs and sadness fill thy place below. Long have the bending angels beckoned thee To quit this thorny vale and come on high; Thy years on earth were few—and thou art free From pain, from care, and every mortal tie! Yes—thou hast crossed the cold and swelling tide Of Jordan, borne upon thy Saviour's breast. Thou now art safe, where every tear is dried, Where pain is ended, and the weary rest. For He, who bids the stormy billows sleep, Placed his soft hand beneath thy sinking head; He, thy best Friend, received, upon the deep, His own redeemed, from off thy dying bed. And shall we wish thy young and blessed feet Back from the holy hills they now have trod? Or hold our own prepared, that we may meet Thy sainted spirit in its home with God? He is Eternal Wisdom—we are dust; And meekly at his footstool may we dwell! His hand lies heavy on us—yet we trust In him alone, who “doeth all things well!” Edwin! beloved, departed one, adieu! Since He, who lent thee, has recalled his own, We bow in silence, while, to mortal view, Clouds and thick darkness hang around his throne. THE CROSS. Much of the timber taken from the United States Frigate Constitution, while undergoing her late repairs, has been made into various small articles, to be preserved as memorials of her services and achievements. 'T was night. In silence the tranquil scene Of earth lay under a sky serene. The moon in her peerless beauty shone: She traversed the ether fields alone, With mildness sending her silver beams To glitter and play in the lakes and streams; While over the slumbering world she cast Her mantle of light, as on she passed Across the numberless stars, that strewed Her path in the calm, deep solitude. But there was one, at this peaceful hour, Awake to worship the holy power, Whose wisdom the firm foundations laid Whereon the heavens and earth were made; Who willed; and what to a world was wrought, Arose from the depth of eternal thought; Who spake, while Chaos the mandate heard— And order appeared at his mighty word; Who marked the space for the spheres to roll; Who breathed—and man was a living soul! The lady her evening prayer had said, Had sung her hymn and a tear had shed, As the sign of her faith she marked and blessed, Where lightly it lay on her heaving breast; While, bowed in spirit she mourned within That God's fair image, enslaved by sin, Had caused the stream from the crimsoned tree, Where death was conquered, and man made free— That now he must pass to his native skies Through the blood of a guiltless sacrifice. The cross she wore was of oaken wood, That once in a far-off wild had stood: 'T was carved from the heart of the forest king, And hung o'er hers by a silken string. But what it had seen in the royal oak, And since it bowed to the woodman's stroke, Until to the sacred emblem formed, And thus by a Christian bosom warmed, She asked; and this did it seem to say, As on it, sleeping, a moonbeam lay: “When called from my mother earth, at first A fair, young shoot from the acorn burst; And I was there in the infant tree; Its vital fluid was feeding me. And when it arose from the tender germ, To stand in an oak mature and firm, Its root struck deep, and its head towered high; While I, still hidden from mortal eye, Was viewed alone by the radiant One That kindled the stars and lit the sun. “Unseen I 've listened, and fearless heard The cry of the savage, of beast and bird. The heavy tramp of the gloomy bear Has passed by me to his sunken lair. The wolf prowled 'round me, the eagle screamed, And near me the blood of their victims streamed. I 've heard the whiz of the Indian's dart, The deer's last bound, as it touched his heart, And the crackling faggots, that then have blazed, But reached me not with the flame they raised. “The wounded chieftain has pressed the sod Beneath me, trusting an unknown God, That he to a hunting-ground should go, In the spirit-world, with his shafts and bow; While death was hastening to dismiss His blindly wandering soul from this. And when that warrior-soul had fled, And under the clods they laid their dead, Then nature dissolved his mortal part, To strengthen the oak in its root and heart. “The scorching heat and the pinching cold Have only rendered me strong and bold. The storms of ages have 'round me beat, But shook me not from my moveless seat. The hail has rattled, the torrent poured— The lightning glared, and the thunder roared— The wind with fury has tried its power In vain, to ruin my strong high tower— The sick earth opened, and heaved to free Her fires, but never neglected me. “And Nature her sweetest sounds has made About me to play, in my calm, green shade. The tender mother, who found her young Where o'er them the living veil was hung, Would tell the joy of her downy breast In song, while hovering 'round her nest. The Spirit that made the oak his care Has touched his harp with a hand of air, To whispering leaves, that danced to hear The notes of their guardian angel near. “But Time, who, born with his wings unfurled, Where new-made matter became a world, Has never suffered them since to pause,— Decrees, as first of his tyrant laws, That all they sweep in his powerful range, Shall take his signet, and yield to change. And what no element could destroy, The tree, which the savage beheld with joy, And left it flourishing high and fair, The hand of the white man would not spare. “He came. The might of his arm he tried. He smote the oak till it bowed and died. The stately trunk of its head bereft, When its limbs were lopped and its sides were cleft, Was forced away from the sylvan scene, To strengthen the frame of an ocean queen. When pierced and probed by the cold, blue steel, They fastened it over her noble keel, On every side enclosing it tight From heaven's free air and its cheering light. “When far from my own dear forest-ground, I lay in irons, and firmly bound To many an aged oak that died To form that ship in her power and pride, They gave her the arms of a mighty host, And called her after Columbia's boast, The ‘Constitution’ and I, in part, Was nerve and strength to her dauntless heart. But, sad indeed were the scenes that then Were prepared for me by wayward men! “An exile, torn from my place of birth, They now denied me a home on earth, And hurried me off on the deep, to be The restless sport of a rolling sea. But, not the furious waves I crossed, By winds and waters driven and tossed, Nor yet the tempest, in all in its wrath, That came to trouble my perilous path, Was half so terrible, as the strife Of man with man, and his waste of life. “When war strode over the yawning flood, Displaying his garments drenched in blood, The withering flash of his fiery eye He gave, as a signal for man to die. His thundering voice for his victims roared— And forth from their bosoms the life-streams poured! A shroud for his banner on high he bore, With death's dread countenance traced in gore. “He claimed the ship. With his sword unsheathed, He reap'd on the deep, and round her wreathed The fairest laurels, that spring and grow Where drop the arms of a conquered foe! And, dipped in the red and reeking sluice Of life's warm current at once let loose, Her palm he raised in victory high; And bright was her glory to this world's eye, Though weeds and weeping its light revealed, As it shone afar from the victor's shield. “But, Time flew on; and the murdered oak In many a battle was stricken and broke. By the mouths of its wounds it craved release From war and the waves, to the earth and peace. And what it had sought in its strength, and failed, It asked in its weakness, and thus prevailed. From bonds and darkness 't was then set free; And I was cut from its heart to be, Through joy and sadness, a holy sign Of the vow, the faith, and the hopes of thine. “When war and death shall at length be slain, For the Prince of peace and life to reign— When sin, nor sorrow, nor pain, nor night, Can pass the end of the Christian fight— Where earth's vain glory is all forgot Before his brightness, who changeth not, May the Spirit that hovers about thee here, To note the cause of thy falling tear, Attest to thy counting all as loss, To follow the Lamb, and bear the Cross.” THE WANDERING POLE. A wanderer over a stranger land, With a houseless head, and an empty hand, A brow of care, and a heart of grief, He came to my door, and asked relief; While, few and foreign his accents fell From a faltering tongue his wants to tell. The vesture that mantled his wasted form, Was little to shield it from cold or storm, As slowly 't was borne by the halting limb The arm of the Russian had given to him, When deep in his forehead the scar was sunk, That showed where the lance at his veins had drunk. And, traced in his visage, I clearly viewed The marks of a mind by woe subdued— A wounded spirit compelled to bear A weary burden of pain and care; Though man in his might had striven, and failed To conquer the soul that his power assailed. I'd learnt the story of Poland's wrongs, From writer, and speaker, and minstrel songs; When every breeze that had swelled a sail Had seemed to waft me the piteous tale, The mortal groan, or the parting breath Of those it had left on her fields of death. I 'd heard of her matrons, who nobly sold Their fine-wrought vessels of silver and gold; Of her beautiful maidens, who robbed their hair Of the costly gems that were glittering there For brother, or lover, or son, to buy The arms they had borne to the fight, to die. Her fearless struggle, her hopeless fall, Her exiled sons—I had heard of all; But never had seen her fate before, As pictured in him, who had reached my door; His looks, like an orphan's, so sadly said Of his own dear country, “My mother is dead!” And could America's child behold A sight like this, with a heart so cold It would not melt, and a balsam flow, In word and deed, till the stranger's woe Was softened, if pity and human skill May reach the spirit's deep-seated ill? But still did I feel how poor and vain Was human effort to lull the pain Of him, whom the sleep of the grave alone Could make to forget the joys he 'd known And lost forever; on time's bleak shore To find home, kindred, and friends no more. I knew, if backward his eye was cast, What fearful visions before it passed; If onward, how lonely, rude, and drear The path to the end of his journey here; While Hope had nought to his breast to bring, And Memory only applied her sting. I almost prayed, as he turned away, The Friend of the friendless to speed the day, When he should be laid in his final rest,— To give, in his mansions, among the blest, A home to the great and suffering soul, That spoke from the eye of the Wandering Pole. POCAHONTAS. Behold the proud chieftain, whose Indian brow Is knit with a fearful intent. His spirit, untaught in compassion to bow, Or a higher on earth than himself to allow, On the blood of the white man is bent. That chief is Powhattan! His barbarous throng With savage decorum have met, And in the dark council been solemn and long; They 've danced the rude war-dance; they 've sung the wild song, And, Smith, thy last moment is set! The monarch has given the awful command, The prisoner before him is led To the stone, his death-pillow, amid the strong band; The weapon is up in a fearful, red hand, And ready to fall on his head! When, lo! there darts forth from that terrible crowd A female's young, beauteous form, Like the flash that breaks out, throwing off its black shroud, And leaps to the earth from the fold of a cloud, Ere the thunder-peal sounds in the storm. But not, like the lightning, to kill or to scath, Comes the bright Pocahontas! She flies, Like pity's kind angel, with tears on her path, To fall, as a shield from her father's dread wrath, On the victim who under it lies! Her arms o'er the form of the prisoner are thrown; Round his neck falls her long, jetty hair; On his head, lowly laid, she has pillowed her own, While her voice rends the air with its piteous tone, As she shrieks—“Father, father, forbear! “Spare! spare but his life! 't is thy daughter who cries, Her head must receive thy first blow! If now by the hand of Powhattan he dies, The same shade forever shall darken our eyes; My blood o'er the white man shall flow!” The sachem's proud spirit, which lately so wild Came forth in the flashes of fire That lit his stern eye, of its purpose beguiled, Is melted and tamed by the tears of his child, Who, weeping, looks up to her sire. “Rise, child of Powhattan!” he cries, “it is meet That mercy should conquer in thee; My own bird of beauty; thy wing was too fleet! Thy glance is an arrow—thy voice is too sweet! Rise up, for the white man is free!” Now harmless the death-weapon drops to the ground, From the grasp of the chieftain's strong hand. He lifts up his child, and the victim's unbound, While sounds of strange gladness are passing around Where the plumed, painted savages stand. The soul of a princess indeed was enshrined In her, who the forest-ground trod. And since, by the faith at the Christian refined, She has given her brow at the font to be signed “Rebecca, a daughter of God.” WHY DON 'T HE COME? The ship has anchored in the bay; They 've dropped her weary wings; and some Have manned the boat and come away; But where is he? Why don 't he come? Among the crowd with busy feet, My eye seeks one it cannot find. While others haste their friends to greet, Why, why is he so long behind? Because he bade me dry my cheek, I dried it, when he went from us; I smiled with lips that could not speak; And now, how can he linger thus? I 've felt a brother's parting kiss Each moment since he turned from me, To lose it only in the bliss Of meeting him—Where can he be? I 've reared the rose, he bade me rear; I 've learnt the song, he bade me learn; And nursed the bird, that he might hear Us sing to him, at his return. I 've braided many a lovely flower, His dear, dear picture to inwreathe; While doating fancy, hour by hour, Has made it smile and seen it breathe. I wonder if the flight of time Has made the likeness now untrue; And if the sea and foreign clime Have touched him with a darker hue. For I have watched, until the sun Has made my longing vision dim; But cannot catch a glimpse of one Among the crowd, that looks like him. How slow the heavy moments waste, While thus he stays! Where can he be? My heart leaps forth; haste, brother, haste! It leaps to meet and welcome thee. “Thou lovely one! the mournful tale, That tells why he comes not, will make Thy heart to bleed; thy cheek turn pale! Death finds no tie too strong to break! “The bird will wait its master long, And ask his morning gift in vain. Ye both must now forget the song Of joy, for sorrow's plaintive strain. “The face, whose shade thy tender hand Has wreathed with flowers, is changed! But sea, Nor sun, nor air of foreign land Has wrought the change; for where is he? “Where! ah! the solemn deep that took His form, as, with their sad farewell, His brethren gave the last, last look, And lowered him down,—that deep must tell. “But ocean cannot tell the whole— The part that death can never chill, Nor floods dissolve,—the living soul Is happy, bright and blooming still. “And nobler songs than ever sound From mortal voices greet his ear, Where sweeter, fairer flowers are found Than all he left to wither here. “This, this is why he does not come, Whom thy fond eye has sought so long! Wait till thy days have filled their sum; Then find him in an angel throng!” THE WINTER KING. Parus Atricapillus, Linn.; Black-capt Titmouse, Wilson. O! what will become of thee, poor little bird? The muttering storm in the distance is heard; The rough winds are waking, the clouds growing black! They'll soon scatter snow-flakes all over thy back! From what sunny clime hast thou wandered away? And what art thou doing this cold winter day? “I'm pecking the gum from the old peach tree. The storm does n't trouble me—Pee, dee, dee.” But, what makes thee seem so unconscious of care? The brown earth is frozen, the branches are bare! And how canst thou be so light-hearted and free, Like Liberty's form with the spirit of glee, When no place is near for thine evening rest, No leaf for thy screen, for thy bosom no nest? “Because the same hand is a shelter for me, That took off the summer leaves!—Pee, dee, dee.” But man feels a burden of want and of grief, While plucking the cluster and binding the sheaf! We take from the ocean, the earth and the air; And all their rich gifts do not silence our care. In summer we faint; in the winter we 're chilled, With ever a void that is yet to be filled. “A very small portion sufficient will be, If sweetened with gratitude!—Pee, dee, dee.” I thank thee, bright monitor! what thou hast taught Will oft be the theme of the happiest thought. We look at the clouds, while the bird has an eye To Him who reigns over them, changeless and high! And now, little hero, just tell me thy name, That I may be sure whence my oracle came. “Because, in all weather, I'm happy and free, They call me the ‘Winter King’—Pee, dee, dee.” But soon there'll be ice weighing down the light bough Whereon thou art flitting so merrily now! And though there 's a vesture, well fitted and warm, Protecting the rest of thy delicate form, What then wilt thou do with thy little bare feet, To save them from pain 'mid the frost and the sleet? “I can draw them right up in my feathers, you see! To warm them, and fly away!—Pee, dee, dee.” THE RISING EAGLE. My bird, the struggle's over! Thy wings at length unfurled Will bear thee, noble rover, Through yon blue, airy world. Thy fearless breast has shaken Earth's dust and dew away; Thine eye its aim has taken; Its mark the orb of day. Up, up, the faster leaving Thy rocky rest below, A fresher strength receiving, The lighter shalt thou go. The clouds that hang before thee, Thou soon shalt over-sweep; Where all is brightness o'er thee, To swim the upper deep. Through seas of ether sailing, Thou lofty, valiant one! The breath of morn inhaling, Thy course is to the sun. The strife was all in lifting Thy breast from earth at first. The poising, and the shifting To balance, was the worst. And so with us; 't is spreading Our pinions for the skies, That keeps us low and dreading The first attempt to rise. 'T is rousing up and getting Our balance, that we shun; With thousand ties besetting, We shrink from breaking one. But when we 've fairly started, And cleared from all below, How free and buoyant-hearted, On eagle-wings we go! And as our bosoms kindle With pure and holy love, How all below will dwindle, And all grow bright above! The world that we are leaving Looks little in our sight, While, clouds and shadows cleaving, We seek the Source of Light. Rise! timid soul, and casting Aside thy doubt and fear, Mount up, where all is lasting; For all is dying here! Then, as an eagle training Her tender young to fly, The hand, that's all sustaining, Will lift thee to the sky. While higher, higher soaring, Thou 'lt feel thy cares are drowned Where heaven's bright Sun is pouring A flood of glory round. THE DEATH OF THE SAGAMORE. A SCENE OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY. The servant of God is on his way From Boston's beautiful shore; His boat skims light o'er the silvery bay, While the sleeping waters awake and play, At the touch of the playful oar. The purpose that fills his soul is great As the soul of a man can know; Vast as eternity, strong as the gate The spirit must pass, to a changeless state, And enter, to bliss or woe! His boat is fast; and over the sod Of a neighboring wood he hies; Through moor and thicket his path is trod, As he hastens to speak of the living God In the ear of a man, who dies! Where Rumney's For the character and the death-scene of Wonohaquaham, better known as Sagamore John, son of the Squaw-Sachem; and for an account of the Rev. Mr. Wilson's visit to him, in his last moments, at his wigwam on the ground anciently called Winnisimit, and Rumney Marsh, but now divided between Chelsea and Saugus. See Thatcher's Indian Biography. forest is high and dark, The eagle lowers her wing O'er him, who once had made her his mark, For the Sagamore, in his hut of bark, Is a perishing, powerless king. At the door of his wigwam hang the bow, The antler, and beaver-skin; While he, who bore them, is faint and low, Where death has given the fatal blow, And the monarch expires within. The eye that glanced, and the eagle fled Away, through her fields of air; The hand that drew, and the deer was dead; The hunter's foot, and the chieftain's head, And the conqueror's arm, are there! But each its powerful work has done; Its triumph at length is past; The final conflict is now begun, And, weeping, the mother hangs over her son, While the Sagamore breathes his last! The queen of the Massachusetts grieves, That the life of her child must end! And that is a noble breast that heaves, While the mortal pang on the bed of leaves Of the white man's Indian Friend! The stately form, which is prostrate there, On the feet that are cold as snow, Has often sped in the midnight air A word to the Christian's ear to bear, Of the plot of his heathen foe! And oft, when roaming the wild alone, That generous heart would melt At the touch of a ray of light that shone From the white man's God, till before his throne Almost has the Indian knelt. Yet the fatal fear, the fear of man, That bringeth to man a snare, Has braced his knee, as it just began To bend; and the dread of a heathen clan Has stifled a Christian prayer. But now, like a flood, to his trembling heart Has the fear of a God rushed in; And keener far than the icy dart, That rends the flesh and spirit apart, Is the thought of his heathen sin. To the lonely spot where the chief reclines, While the herald of love draws nigh, The Indian shrinks, as he marks the signs Of a soul at peace, and the light that shines Alone from a Christian's eye. “Alas!” he cries, in the strange, deep tone Of one in the grasp of death, “No God have I! I have lost my own! I go to the presence of thine alone, To scorch in his fiery breath! “The Spirit, who makes the skies so bright With the prints of his shining feet, Who rolls the waters, kindles the light, Imprisons the winds, or gives them their flight— I tremble his eye to meet! “When, oh! if I openly had confessed, And followed and loved him here, I now might fly to his arms for rest, As the weary bird to her downy nest, When the evening shades draw near. “But grant me the one great boon I crave In a great, and an awful hour! When I shall have sunk in my forest grave, O take my Boy to thy home, and save That beautiful forest flower! “The God of thy people, the Holy One— And the path that shall reach the skies— Say! say that to these thou wilt lead my son, That he may not second the race I 've run, Nor die, as his father dies!” “As his father dies!” with the breath that bor That sorrowful sound has fled The soul of a king—for the strife is o'er With spirit and flesh; and the Sagamore Is numbered among the dead! But has he not, by his high bequest, Like the penitent on the tree, The Saviour of dying man confessed; And found the promise to him addressed— “To-day thou shalt be with me?” SISERA. FROM DEBORAH'S SONG. JUDGES V. Why tarries Sisera? His mother stands At the high window, where her eye commands The hill and vale afar, while waning day Shows not her son, in all the winding way. Forth from the lattice goes her earnest cry, “Where art thou, Sisera? My son, O why, While o'er the world this solemn twilight steals, Why tarry thus thy burning chariot wheels? “When wilt thou come triumphant from the plain, With Israel's spoils and captives in thy train; Thy parent's pride, a shouting kingdom's boast, Thou valiant leader of a dauntless host? “How went the battle? None will come and tell Where the dart entered, or the javelin fell; What shield was shivered, which the trusty sword That met its aim, or whose the blood that poured. “If that I gave thee from my own rich veins Empurple earth's cold sod, what hope remains? Thy nation's glory must with thee depart; And one dread swell will burst thy mother's heart! “But why thy joyful coming thus delay? Is it to share the spoil, and take the prey? Dim grows the distance to my weary eye; Nor hoof, nor wheel, nor foot of man, comes nigh!” Why, haplessmo ther, does he not return! Go to the Kenite's distant place, and learn! Fly to the tent on Zaanaim's plain; Ask Heber's wife for him thou call'st in vain! Enter her tent, and slowly raise the veil; Lift that spread mantle; see the fatal nail; Behold thy son, as now he lieth low; Inglorious chief! and by a woman's blow! Is this the brow that thou hast hoped to see Twined with the laurel high in victory? The blood thou gav'st him in a form so fair Is thick around it, on the matted hair! Pierced through the temples! pillowed on the ground! Is this the head that glory should have crowned? Was the fair captive's needle-work to deck, With many colors, this poor severed neck? Oh! 't is a fearful thing to be a rod Used on a people, by the hand of God, To bring his children back, when they offend; To chasten them; then have the scourge's end! To Tabor's mount the bands of Barak drew, In arms but feeble; in their numbers, few; While Jabin's hosts, with Sisera their head, By Kishon's stream the valley overspread. With strong war-chariots they took the field; With prancing horses, gleaming spear and shield. Thick as the grass they overran the plain, Like that, when mown, to strow it with the slain. When to the onset, like a stream that gushed Forth from the mount, the men of Israel rushed; The Lord of hosts was with them in the fight, And death or dread seized every Canaanite. The ancient river felt its heavy tide Swell with the blood that flowed upon its side. Horses and horsemen weltered in the waves, That bore down thousands into restless graves. Then Sisera, unchiefed, with none to head, Leaped from his iron chariot and fled. His steps the fugitive in terror bent, To ask of Jael refuge in her tent. She gave him milk; “and in a lordly dish,” She brought him food; she granted him his wish Here to be screened from Barak; but his sleep She fastened on him! it is long and deep! Oh, Sisera! it was a fearful thing To be the minion of an evil king; Against an injured people to contend, Who had the God of armies for their friend. THE UNCONSCIOUS ORPHAN. Mother, I have found a tear In your eye! How came it here? More are coming; now they chase One another down your face. How I feel your bosom heave! What does make you sob and grieve? Let me wipe your tears away, Or I cannot go to play. Why is father sleeping so? Put me down, and let me go— Let me go, where I can stand Near enough to reach his hand. Why! it feels as stiff and cold, As a piece of ice, to hold! Lift me up to kiss his cheek; Then, perhaps, he'll wake and speak. Mother, oh! it is n't he, For he will not look at me! Father had n't cheeks so white! See, the lips are fastened tight! Father always spoke and smiled, Calling me his “darling child;” He would give and ask a kiss, When I came; but who is this? If 't is father, has he done Speaking to his little one? Will he never, never more Know and love me as before? Could he hear what we have said? Tell me; what is being dead? O! he does n't breathe a breath! Mother, what 's the cause of death? THE DREAM. I dreamed, and 'twas a lovely, blessed dream, That I again my native hills had found, The mossy rocks, the valley, and the stream That used to hold me captive to its sound. I was a child again—I roamed anew About my early haunts, and saw the whole That fades, with waking memory, from the view Of this mysterious thing we call the soul. A very child, again beside the brook, I made my puny hand a cup to dip Among the sparkling waters, where I took Its hollow full and brought it to my lip. And, oh! that cooling draught I still can taste, And feel it in the spirit and the flesh. 'T is like a fount, that in the desert waste Leaps out, the weary pilgrim to refresh. The spice of other days was borne along, From shrub and forest, on the balmy breeze; I heard my warbling wild bird's tender song Come sweet and thrilling through the rustling trees. All was restored, as in the sunny day When I believed my little, rural ground The centre of the world, whose limits lay Just where the bright horizon hemmed it round. And she—who was my sister then, but now, What she may be, the pure immortals know, Who round the throne of the Eternal bow, And bathe in glory, veiled from all below— Yes, she was there; who, with her riper years, Once walked, the guardian of my infant feet; Drew from my hand the thorn, wiped off my tears, And brought fresh flowers to deck our grassy seat. I saw her cheek with life's warm current flushed; Clung to the fingers that I used to hold; Heard the loved voice that is forever hushed; And felt the form that long ago was cold. All I have been and known, in all the years Since I was sporting in that cherished spot, My hopes, my joys, my wishes, and my tears, As only dreamings, were alike forgot. 'T was this that made my dream so blest and bright, And me the careless thing that I was then. Yet, Time, I would not now reverse thy flight, And risk the running of my race again. The fairest joys that struck their roots in earth I would not rear again, to bloom and fade! I 've had them once, in their ideal worth; Their height I 've measured, and their substance weighed. Nor those, who sleep in peace, would I awake To have their hearts with time's delusions filled; The seal, that God has set, I would not break; Nor call the voice to lips that he has stilled. And yet I love my dream—'t was very sweet To be among my native hills again; Where my light heart was borne by infant feet, The careless, blissful creature I was then! Whene'er I think of it, the warm tears roll, Uncalled, and unforbidden, down my cheek; But not for joy, or sorrow. O my soul, Thy nature, power, or purpose, who can speak? THE FLOWERS IN THE CEMETERY. Peace keeps the place where we spring up and bloom. Kind, gentle angels hover round, to spread Our tender leaves, and bow us by the tomb To pour our freshest odors o'er the dead. Soft, silent air supplies our vital breath: It wafts no sound of tumult, mirth, or strife, Where, for the mourners, in the land of Death, Beneath his throne we open into life. Praise to our Maker is the holy part Assigned to us; and, while his power we show, With soothing skill to reach the stricken heart, Awhile to lull the throbbing pulse of woe. We to the eye, that on our native sod Retires unseen to shed the dew of grief, Attest the presence of a perfect God, Whose glory shines on every opening leaf. Who then our beauty can behold, nor feel Something, not sadness, but to joy allied, Upon the wounded bosom sweetly steal, Like balm by spirit-ministers applied? Tell us, ye sad ones, if it be not thus? Do ye not own this soothing art is ours, When ye come out to breathe your sighs to us, And count your sorrows to your cherished flowers? Here do ye find us steady to our trust, As sentinels, who stand to guard the dead. Each has her charge to watch the sacred dust, Of some one sleeping in the dreamless bed. Well is our high and solemn office done. Since we were planted, not a foot has crossed A spot that we have pointed out as one Where rests a friend, whom ye have loved and lost. Night falls around us, like a mourner's veil; But, though our beauties in the dimness fade, Still does the pure, free essence we exhale Ascend and penetrate the deepest shade. If thus the better part of those you weep, From death and darkness, rose to life and light; Then lift your hearts from all that earth could keep To that blest world where you may reunite. Such is the part that we, the humble Flowers, Perform; and such the solace we would give To man, who, while we bloom our few short hours, Has yet a whole eternity to live! McLELLAN'S TOMB. Say, may a stranger's trembling hand presume To twine its humble wreath upon the tomb Where young McLellan's sleeping clay was borne, And not the deemed profane by those who mourn? May thus, the eye, that ne'er beheld his face, Seek out and fall upon his resting-place, Where nature hangs her fragrant evergreen To deck Mount Auburn's calm and holy scene? Then by his tomb a stranger, yet a friend, To read his name and age I pensive bend, And o'er the part that is resigned to earth Pay my soul's tribute to departed worth! Shall Science mourn the deed that death has done, And here lament her lost, beloved son, When he had gained the knowledge pure and high To fit him long to live, or soon to die? Shall Truth bewail her champion, when the Lord Gave his young soldier buckler, helm and sword; But took him, ere he reached the field of strife, To bear the palm, and wear the crown of life? Will Earth lament that he, whose feet have prest Her many lands, is here so soon at rest; When through her distant windings called to roam, He still looked up, and sought the spirit's home? Parental fondness and fraternal love, Weep they, that he is gone to taste above The full fruition of his hopes of bliss, Which from that world he drew to brighten this? Yes! they may weep, and friendship drop her tears For one so ripe in worth, so young in years! For “Jesus wept!” and those, who would pursue The path he trod on earth, must sorrow too. But, though their eyes with nature's mists are dim, They soon shall brighten; for they follow Him, Who to a glorious life the dead shall raise, And, on the lips now silent, perfect praise! Then fare thee well, thou quiet, sacred spot! Farther “the stranger intermeddleth not” With peace like thine! Hence hope and faith shall rise Where kindred spirits meet beyond the skies. THE WINTER ROSE. O, why do I hold thee, my fair, only rose, My bright little treasure, so dear; And love thee a thousand times better than those, In thousands, that lately were here? Because, like a friend, when the many depart, As fortune's cold storms gather round, Till all from without chills the desolate heart, My sweet winter-flower, thou art found! Because that for me thou hast budded and blown, I look with such fondness on thee; That, while I 've no other, I call thee my own, And feel thou art living for me. I know thee. I 've studied thy delicate form, Till reared from the root to the flower; That opens to-day, in a season of storm, To brighten so dreary an hour. How could I so lavishly scatter my sight On those, that the gay summer-sun Had nursed with his beams, when I find such delight In having and loving but one? And while thou dost modestly blush at the praise, That thus I in secret bestow, It heightens thy beauty, and only can raise The strain, high and higher to flow. Although thou must droop, as our dearest ones will, I'll tenderly watch thy decline; And, in thy sad moments, I'll cherish thee still, Because thou hast cheered me in mine. Then, hallowed like dust of a friend in the tomb, I'll lay thy pale leaves safe away, Where memory often shall give them the bloom That brightened my dark winter day. THE CHILD ON THE BEACH. Mary, a beautiful, artless child, Came down on the beach to me, Where I sat, and a pensive hour beguiled By watching the restless sea. I never had seen her face before, And mine was to her unknown; But we each rejoiced on that peaceful shore The other to meet alone. Her cheek was the rose's opening bud, Her brow of an ivory white; Her eyes were bright, as the stars that stud The sky of a cloudless night. To reach my side as she gaily sped, With the step of a bounding fawn, The pebbles scarce moved beneath her tread, Ere the little, light foot was gone. With the love of a holier world than this, Her innocent heart seemed warm; While the glad, young spirit looked out with bliss From its shrine, in her sylph-like form. Her soul seemed spreading the scene to span, That opened before her view, And longing for power to look the plan Of the universe fairly through. She climbed and stood on the rocky steep, Like a bird that would mount and fly Far over the waves, where the broad, blue deep Rolled up to the bending sky. She placed her lips to the spiral shell, And breathed through every fold; She looked for the depth of its pearly cell, As a miser would look for gold. Her small white fingers were spread to toss The foam, as it reached the strand: She ran them along in the purple moss, And over the sparkling sand. The green sea-egg, by its tenant left, And formed to an ocean cup, She held by its sides, of their spears bereft, To fill, as the waves rolled up. But the hour went round, and she knew the space Her mother's soft word assigned; While she seemed to look with a saddening face On all she must leave behind. She searched 'mid the pebbles, and finding one Smooth, clear, and of amber die, She held it up to the morning sun, And over her own mild eye. Then, “Here,” said she, “I will give you this, That you may remember me!” And she sealed her gift with a parting kiss, And fled from beside the sea. Mary, thy token is by me yet. To me 't is a dearer gem Than ever was brought from the mine, or set In the loftiest diadem. It carries me back to the far-off deep, And places me on the shore, Where the beauteous child, who bade me keep Her pebble, I meet once more. And all that is lovely, pure and bright In a soul that is young, and free From the stain of guile, and the deadly blight Of sorrow, I find in thee. I wonder if ever thy tender heart In memory meets me there, Where thy soft, quick sigh, as we had to part, Was caught by the ocean air. Blest one! over time's rude shore, on thee May an angel guard attend, And “a white stone bearing a new name,;” be Thy passport when time shall end! THE PILOT LOST. Mariners! mariners, what will ye do? The distant, fathomless deep ye 've crossed. Your rock-bound coast has risen to view; And what will ye do? for your Pilot 's lost. He, who had hastened through surge and foam, And reef and shallow so freely passed, To bring your ship with a welcome home,— Your faithful Pilot is gone at last! His trusty boat has her trust betrayed! Her master has done with the sail and oar; And he, low under the waves is laid, Who guided his thousands safe to shore. He took his life in his friendly hand, When venturing forth your lives to save; To bring you again to your native land, He hurried himself to a watery grave. On earth's broad bosom no verdant turf Was marked for him in his final rest. The deep green sea and her curling surf Have pillowed his head and wrapped his breast! The waves o'er which he would lightly skim, When many a peril for you was run, Are sounding a requiem over him, And wailing the sorrowful deed they 've done. With the heart of a brother, an eagle's eye, And a pilot's hand, when the heavens are dark, And blast and billow are strong and high, Who will now come to your wildered bark? O, there is One, who the deep can smooth, And hush the winds, who will still be nigh! Listen! your trembling hearts he 'll soothe, With “Mariners, be of good cheer—'t is I.” Trust him while crossing life's stormy sea: In every peril he'll lend you aid; Your pilot through Jordan's waves he'll be. Follow him closely, and be not afraid! THE LEAF. A leaf! a leaf! it has been torn From out a volume full and fair. 'T is to a joyful reader borne By a mild courier through the air. The author of the book has writ His shining name upon the leaf; And blessed import comes in it, Although the lines are few and brief. It says, the flood retires! The heads Of the lost hills again are seen— That, on their sides the olive spreads Her fruitful branches fresh and green!— That He, who has so late revealed The awful power that arms his hand, The fountains of the deep has sealed, And swept the waters from the land! Thou man of God! while death has reigned Without the ark, till every soul Is hurried hence, thy faith retained, Thy steady trust has kept thee whole. When God stretched forth his mighty arm In terrors clothed to impious men, It shielded thee and thine from harm. Go forth! Jehovah smiles again. Look up! the heavens are clear and bright With splendor never seen before. Behold your Lord his promise write, That he will drown the world no more! For this, the richest, purest dies That shine in heaven, he softly blends; And, like himself, from out the skies, His bow for man in glory bends. The humbled earth, baptized, appears Washed by the flood from strife and sin. Beauty and joy shall follow tears, And life and praise where death has been. The Leaf is one from Nature's book, Which, with a tender father's love, Its holy Author wisely took To send thee by the peaceful dove! A MOTHER'S GRIEF AND JOY. I could not lift my voice to sing, Nor touch my harp, to sweep a string; And this world's joy and music seemed As things whereof I had but dreamed. For Death's pale angel stood so near My only child, I could but fear And watch; or, bow my soul in prayer, That He who governs Death, would spare My tender infant's life—would save My heart from bursting o'er its grave. Ere yet twelve moons had silvered earth, Since this bright being had its birth— Before the soft, endearing word Of “Mother,” from its lips was heard, The smiles that lit its beaming face To marks of pain had given place. Its cheek was wan, its languid eye Rose feebly, as, to ask me why I dropped from mine the tear of grief, And did not give my babe relief. The skies seemed overspread with gloom Deep as the shades that fill the tomb, And earth's bright blossoms past away, While my sweet flow'ret fading lay. And, when I prayed—“Thy will be done!” Strong nature cried, “O, be it one, That shall my sinking babe restore! And, Father, I will ask no more Than that this froward will of mine May here be swallowed up in thine!” I know not how this double prayer, Of little faith and great despair, Could e'er have reached the mercy-seat, A gracious answer there to meet! But this sure word rebuked my fears, “To reap in joy, ye sow in tears.” Then He, who gave it, heard my cries, And caused the star of hope to rise Upon my soul with cheering ray, A blessed herald of the day. And, since my heavenly Father smiled, And kindly gave me back my child, The roses that its cheek resume Have clothed the earth, to me, with bloom! Its laughing eye to mine, is bright Enough to fill the world with light! There 's music on the balmy air; There 's joy and glory every where! I'll wake my harp—my voice I'll raise, And give to God my hymn of praise. THE WRECK AT SEA. The struggle is over! The storm-cloud at last Has emptied itself, and the fury is past! The ship is a ruin! The mariners wait Their summons to enter eternity's gate. The remnant of canvass that flaps in the wind, Their signal of woe, they may soon leave behind To give its last flutter above the wild surge, As all it betokens the deep shall immerge. They see rising round them a chill, restless grave, While Death loudly calls them from out the hoarse wave. “Come to me! come! ye have nowhere to flee, But down in the waters for quiet with me! My thin, winding arms, ever naked and cold, Have nothing to warm them but what they infold. My being unlawful I have to sustain By feeding on life, that from others I drain! The sweet buds of childhood, youth's beautiful bloom, And age's ripe clusters I pluck and consume. I traverse the world by the light that I steal Alone from the eyes that in darkness I seal! “In ocean's black chambers I welcome the forms That rush to my kingdom, through shipwreck and storms. The babe never prattles or climbs on the knee Of him, who is low in the cold, deep sea. The eye of his widow grows sunken and dim, With looking and waking and weeping for him. The parent's fond heart slowly bleeds for the son, Till I, for my throne, a new trophy have won! Come! and the mourners away on the shore Shall never behold you, or hear of you more!” Hush! hush! thou pale monarch! a voice from above! It chides thee—its tones are of mercy and love. Away! king of terrors! In silence retire. Though high is thy throne, there is one that is higher! The sinking have looked from the billows that swell Around them, to Him, who the surges can quell. And He, who before has the tempest allayed, And said to the mariner, “Be not afraid!” Is now walking over the waters, to tread Upon the white spray that is pluming thy head! A sail! ho! a sail in the moment of need! On yonder mad breakers she 's riding with speed. A rescue! it comes in the light, little boat, That 's lowered and manned o'er the perils to float. While life for the perishing, hope for despair, And joy and reward for affection are there, With rocking and tossing, as onward she steers, And shooting and plunging, the wreck as she nears, One moment, and then the last wave will be crossed! Yet all is too late if that unit be lost! The helper and helpless, while panting to meet, Have sent forth their voices each other to greet. And when did those voices go out on the air, An import so great, such an errand to bear? Emotions too mighty for sound to convey, Or, long for the spirit to feel in the clay— A pulse never known in their bosoms before, Is each proving now, at the dash of the oar. And sweet to their hearts will the memory be Of these clasping hands on the wild, deep sea! SARAH. She had not breathed this world's inclement air Till it had chilled, or touched her with a blight. She had not lived till sorrow, pain, or care Had marked her brow, or dimmed her spirit's light. Beauty and health hung round her infant form. Ten hasty summers had not o'er her flown. Her guileless heart was happy, pure and warm; And she believed all others like her own. She was a shining creature God had lent This world awhile, too holy to be given! And Sarah knew that she was only sent To visit earth, and that her home was heaven. And, finding much to lure and bind her here, She smiled on all around her, while within, Her little angel bosom felt a fear, Lest thoughts might enter with the stain of sin. The things of time, the flowery fields of earth, Had much to charm,—to win her childish love: But still she doubted if they all were worth The brighter scenes that she should find above. She therefore made her young and tender heart A morning off'ring for her God to keep; So that, if summoned early to depart, Upon his bosom she might fall asleep. Some spirit-messenger of his had come, But none knew how, or when, to Sarah's ear, And told her she had nearly filled the sum Of days allotted for her being here! She startled not at this. The warning word, That told the little listener she must die, Without surprise, without dismay was heard; It filled with purer light her joyful eye. She only sought to soothe her weeping friends, Assuring them, that she was now to go Where, but to enter, were to make amends For more than all that man can leave below. She fell asleep! The gently fleeting breath Left her young spirit on a seraph's wing, Triumphant o'er the grave! The angel Death, To her, had neither terrors, nor a sting! She was a blessed creature God had sent To show what love and beauty dwell on high; Upon a kind, a holy errand bent, To win our love, and lure us to the sky! THE RAIN-DROP AND THE LILY. A cloud, that had hung like a veil o'er the sun, Was melted, and came to the earth on the run; When one of its parts, in a round, sparkling drop, That coursed down the air, on its way made a stop To crown a fair Lily, that, lowly and pale, Was bending to pour out her sweets o'er the vale; Because, not another of all the bright shower Could bathe, in descending, so lovely a flower. The Lily was shocked by the signal of state. She shook when it came, and was bent with its weight. “'T is brilliant and heavy,” she modestly said, “And must not be worn by so humble a head. For me, in my simple and plain robe of white, To wear a gay coronet courting the sight, It ill would befit!” so, she bowed herself down, And on a green leaf meekly cast off her crown. “And now,” said the Drop, “as it clearly is seen, The crown was not needed to make thee a queen, Permit me awhile at thy feet to repose, A few secret things of my life to disclose; And then may I sink in the earth, where thy root Will take me, and let me return in a shoot, To hang on thy stem in a beautiful bell, As pure as the one that I laved when I fell.” The Lily consented. The Drop then began:— “My birth was before the creation of man! When darkness was yet on the face of the deep, I lay in its bosom, an infant, asleep. The Spirit moved over us through the black night; And when my Creator said, ‘Let there be light,’ Its first rays awoke me! I sparkled and played, In praise of the power by whose word we were made. “And since—but 't would take many lives such as thine, To learn half the change that has since followed mine!— I 've run in the stream, I have leapt in the fount; I 've slept in the lake, and have rolled up the mount In a light curl of mist. I have strengthened the oak, When o'er its lone head the red thunderbolt broke! I 've sailed in the cloud, and distilled in the dew. As old as the world, I 've a form ever new. “When earth was submerged, I was under the ark, Combined with my kindred to bear up the bark. I 've been at the poles. All the zones I have crossed. I 've fled from the fire, and been caught by the frost. I 've plunged in the avalanche, heaved in the sea; And ocean's deep things have been open to me. The ruins unknown, and the treasures untold That lie in her caverns, 't was mine to behold! “Through groves of rich coral, while winding my way Where pearls strewed the bed, and the mariner lay, I bathed his pale lips and his eye's heavy lid, When all those bright things from its vision were hid, And cold, rayless orbs seem to tell me their sight By Him was recalled, who said, ‘Let there be light.’ From scenes deep and sad, to the skies high and clear, I rose in a vapor to fall in a tear. “Approaching the earth, where I paused on thy stem, Transfixed by a sunbeam, I turned to a gem! That delicate union of water and light, Where so many beauties and wonders unite, Was formed on thy head, and disporting its powers To mark thee the fairest and sweetest of flowers. And now, the next form that to sight I assume, I hope will appear on thy stalk, in its bloom!” The Drop sunk away where the root drew it in. And ye, who will go, when the lilies begin Their buds to unfold to the warm, vernal sun, And look in the vale, ye may there find the one That cast off her crown; and the Drop will be seen To rise gently up o'er the leaves fresh and green, Transformed to a bell of a pure snowy white; And still praising Him, who said, “Let there be light.” THE SUMMONED. Ferdinand, while on his march against the Moors, died of an illness which could not be accounted for, on the 17th of September, 1312. His death took place on the thirtieth day from that on which he had caused two brothers to be put to the cruel death, and for the reasons described in this poem; and he was summoned by them a moment before they were hurled from the rock, to meet them before the King of kings, in thirty days from that, to atone for the deed. He has since borne, in Spanish history, the name of el Emplazado, (the Summoned.) A SCENE IN SPAIN. Valencia's streets are thronged. With fearful state The crowd move on, and pass without the gate. That ancient city leaving far behind, Up the rude height the rugged way they wind. Where yon bold rock its awful forehead rears, Lashed by the tempests of six thousand years, And to the yawning depth below looks down Steadfast and stern, with one eternal frown. The space between the cliff and that abyss Is all, between another world and this, To him who measures it. If human breath Reach to its end, 't is but a gift of death. And then the vultures, ravening wolves of air! Hover around in quest of plunder there, Where the coy sun has left the cavern, laid By the dark crag in everlasting shade. Now to that frowning height the people go With groanings loud, and imprecations low. As in that multitude, who took their way Up the dread mount, where One was heard to say, “Father forgive them!” in this jarring crowd, Some wag their heads, while some with grief are bowed; And mingled sounds of horror, woe, despair, Triumph and pain oppress the morning air. The king is there, the jealous Ferdinand, Fourth of Castile; and there with ready hand His executioner, for work so fell 'T will wake a laugh where rebel angels dwell. The hardened earth will blush to give it place. In blackest lines a hand on high will trace A record of the deed, which Mercy's tear May not efface, she cries so vainly here. “But, who are they—the young, majestic twain, With forms so fair, and loaded with the chain? All eyes are fastened on them, while their own Seem, as they move unheeded and alone, And time's short, narrow vista looking through At things beyond it, kindled with the view Till life immortal lent a steady ray To their white, marble faces!—who are they?” Two noble brothers, high in rank and power! Of youth and chivalry the pride and flower. The Carvajales, loved by all Castile So much that Ferdinand begins to feel Upon his haughty head a loosened crown, And that his throne may shake and cast him down. Of these two gallant knights he fain would rid His kingdom, while his jealous fears are hid. There has been murder near the palace walls! He, who at evening walked the stately halls In manly beauty to the festal board, Where sparkling draughts in golden cups were poured; Young Benavides, favorite friend and guest, Whom Ferdinand loved most and served the best, Retiring from the banquet lone and late, Has met a fatal dagger at the gate. There did the menials find him in his gore, With only time to gasp, and be no more! But whose bold hand had urged the fatal blade That on his heart the mortal touch had made, He gave no sign; no broken accent fell From off his quivering, ashy lips, to tell. The name is wrapped in silence, like the clay That was to death's dark mansion borne away. At this the stony bosom of the king Of feeling showed no brightly welling spring, Whence sorrow's gentle waters forth might pour, Because his friend, his favorite, was no more. His heart had settled in a sea of pride, Till every part was cold and petrified. He felt the blow; but felt it in his brain, Where flame and frenzy testified the pain. In wrath he swore, whoe'er had done the deed, Should take no trial—have no time to plead! And using this, the murder of his friend, As means to serve his own ambitious end— To sate his envy and allay his fears, He stamped the names of these young chevaliers, So high and spotless, with the blighting crime Of launching Benavides out of time. He knew Alonzo, eldest of the two, For Benavides's sister bore a true And ardent love;—that, on the maiden's part, Fair Violante gave him back her heart. He knew her brother had opposed the tie, And marked the lovers with a watchful eye;— That cutting words, and slander's arrows came From him, upon Alonzo's ear and fame. He called the death, “revenge for baffled love, And just contempt;” and using this to prove The brothers guilty, brought them to his throne, Where, by his single word and will alone, He charged them with a blood-stained, murderous hand; Convicted both; and sentenced them to stand On that dread cliff, and thence, together hurled, To take their passage to another world! The people murmur at their cruel fate; But still the king is stern and obdurate. He fears a rescue; and an armed band Surrounds the prisoners; while with Ferdinand There moves of guards a long, imposing train To show death certain, and resistance vain. In this array the fearful point is gained, And foremost there, the brothers stand unchained. Behold them now, upon the dizzy height, Looking their long adieu to this world's light— Breathing their farewell breath of nature's air, With their last earthly footsteps taken there! From life's sad limit, with a solemn tone And words commanding, while for scenes unknown, Their guiltless spirits raise a ready wing, They thus break silence and address the king:— “In thrice ten days from this, king Ferdinand, A naked soul, we summon thee to stand Before the King of kings, the Judge Most High, To answer for the death that thus we die Without a trial; to the Eternal throne, For twofold murder, come and take thine own, Where guilt and innocence the balance weighs! Remember! meet us there in THIRTY DAYS!” A moment now in silent prayer they bend, And to Almighty love and truth commend Their injured souls, that, stainless in the sight Of Heaven, are calmly poising for their flight. Then Don Alonzo, taking from his breast The silken scarf, has on it closely pressed His pallid lips, which, to a friend that's near, Give his last charge designed for mortal ear. “To Donna Violante carry this, Tell her it brings Alonzo's dying kiss. Tell her the heart, that beat beneath its fold, Devoutly loved her, till 't was still and cold— That this warm bosom never could retain Love for an angel, with a fiend-like stain— That by our final prayer, our latest breath, We both are guiltless of her brother's death!” All now is ready—now, the awful throw! Locked in a close embrace the brothers go, Whirling down! down!—O Nature! from the view Turn off, for thou art sick and bleeding, too! Sun, from the earth let now thy glory fail! In sable clouds thy mid-day splendor veil! Untimely darkness, come, and, like a pall, O'er the last frightful picture kindly fall! The dreadful act is closed, the curtain dropped. But, can the voice of conscience thus be stopped? Ah, no! Her iron tongue without control Sounds deep and ceaseless through the haunted soul Of Ferdinand, the dismal, harrowing chime Of “twofold murder!” “thirty days of time!” The monarch has no power that voice to still! The foe within his breast, no arm to kill! The hasty moon has nearly run her round; And still he hears the solemn, threatening sound! He now lies stretched upon a bed of pain, Wrung at the vitals, tortured in the brain, By Death's fierce ministers, while struggling life Forced to succumb, is sinking from the strife,— When, lo! a herald flying to the court, Some mighty tidings hastens to report! Now to the king and those around are read The dying words of one already dead, Far from Valencia, in a distant clime;— A man whose soul allied to hidden crime, Had deep and deadly stains; and when about To quit her dwelling, could not wash them out; And, going to her place, would leave a sting Behind her for the bosom of the king. “This to King Ferdinand. Read thou, and know, Of Benavides I, the secret foe, Long envied his honor near the throne. And, for the favor thou to him hast shown, I hated thee; while vengeance on you both I vowed, and, with a desperado's oath! His life-stream spouted on this hand that writes! His death is on the spirit that indites! “I chose an hour well suited to the deed,— Darkness to veil it—torments to succeed, Could I but send thy minion's giddy soul Bathed for my purpose, in the maddening bowl, And reeling forth in that accursed disguise, To find the worm that never, never dies! My steady steel was faithful to its trust; And what was Benavides here, but dust? “I fled the kingdom, while thy wrath, I knew, Would soon make thee a haunted murderer too; That when thy short-lived earthly reign should end, Hot chains might reunite thee to thy friend, Where a long train of monarchs writhe and groan For power perverted and a bloody throne; And I, the wretched Pedro, may appear In royal company, who spurned me here! “I knew the brothers, virtuous, holy, high! Fit for bright angels of the upper sky! And all the demon in me could not bear To cut them off from certain entrance there, By leaving them a longer space below, To meet temptation—earth's dark ways to know. Nor would that demon thus unfinished leave The snare I had begun for thee to weave! “Two guiltless victims thou hast slain, and now I see fulfilled the purpose of my vow. Hope is no more! To be thy fellow-heir To all the mighty meaning of Despair, I go before thee, only to await And hail thine entrance through perdition's gate! Truth stands—earth fails! and, from her crumbling brink, Thus Pedro greets thee—lo! I sink! I sink—” “Hold!” cries the king with wildly glaring eyes; “Say not, ‘the worm that never, never dies!’ What day is this?” “The thirtieth from—” “away! Out of my sight, thou who would'st name that day! Fly from my presence! palsied be the tongue And lips whereon that evil sentence hung! O, for one breath of air to fan my own! He said, ‘For power perverted—bloody throne!’”— “The thirtieth” still rings through his dying ear. The forms of sight grow dim and disappear. His hand in darkness wanders for a hold It cannot feel; and growing white and cold, Falls numb and heavy on his heaving breast. The spring is snapped! the wheels are all at rest! O power! the eye whose glance was late command, Can't close itself! Is this proud Ferdinand? O'erhung with silken drapery, lies the thing That yesterday was feared, and called a king. A mightier one than governed wide Castile Upon that humbled clay has set his seal! In bitter memory keeping well the day, The cited spirit took her lonely way! Earth knows but this—the Summons was obeyed! Eternal Wisdom veils the rest in shade. THE SENTENCED. They say the blessed Spring is here, With all her buds and flowers; With singing birds and fountains clear, Soft winds, and sunny hours. They say the earth looks new and bright, That o'er the azure sky The very clouds are fringed with light, And gaily floating by. They tell me nature's full of life, And man, of hope and joy: But ah! not so, my widowed wife, My more than orphan boy! For, smiling nature cannot give Such innocence as theirs To me; nor can she bid me live In answer to their prayers. Beyond my dismal prison-bars The coy night air steals by; And but a few pale, trembling stars Will greet my guilty eye. Ere thrice the rising morn shall spread Her mantle o'er the wave, I shall be numbered with the dead, And fill a felon's grave! To thee, alas! my noble son, I leave a withered name— A life, for what thy sire hath done, Of bitter, blighting shame! And thou, to whom I gave a love More pure, and warm, and free, Than e'er I placed on aught above, What do I leave to thee? A bleeding heart, that cannot make Its throbbing pulses cease; That ever swells, but will not break— A bosom robbed of peace! A world all filled with prison gloom, By Memory's cruel power: Thou 'lt smell the dungeon in the bloom Of every vernal flower. A pall will hang beside the way, Where'er thy feet may go, Upon the brightest path to lay A shade of death and woe. I leave thee as a tender vine That felt the tempest rush, And fell, with nought whereon to twine, For every foot to crush! These cutting thoughts, while yet I live, Will ceaseless anguish bring; And, in the last, sad moment, give To death a double sting. From them, O Heaven! I turn to thee, The sinner's friend to seek: If thou hast pard'ning grace for me, O God! my pardon speak. Thy spirit in the still, small voice, O, send with peace to mine; And let this trembling soul rejoice In being sealed as thine! Then, through the world's dark wilderness Be thou my widow's God— The Father of my fatherless, When I'm beneath the sod! CAPTAIN KIDD. There's many a one who oft has heard The name of Robert Kidd, Who cannot tell, perhaps, a word Of him, or what he did. So, though I never saw the man, And lived not in his day, I'll tell you how his guilt began— To what it paved the way. 'T was in New York Kidd had his home, And there he left his wife And children, when he went to roam, And lead a seaman's life. Now Robert had as firm a hand, A heart as stern and brave, As ever met in one on land, Or on the briny wave. 'T was in the third king William's time, When many a pirate bold Committed on the seas the crime Of shedding blood for gold. So Captain Kidd was singled out As one devoid of fears, To take a ship and cruise about Against the Buccaniers. The ship was armed with many a gun, And manned with many a man, Across the southern seas to run To foil the pirate's plan. But when she long, from isle to isle, Without success had sailed, And made no capture all the while, Her master's patience failed. The prizes he so oft had sought, He found he sought in vain; And soon a wicked, bloody thought, Came into Robert's brain! His mind he opened to his men; And found his guilty crew Agreed with him, that they, from then, Would all turn pirates too! He threw his Bible in the deep, Defied its Author's will; And, with his conscience put to sleep, Began to rob and kill. And now the desperado reigned, A tyrant on the waves, While they whose blood his hands had stained, Went down to watery graves. No merchant ship could near him go, Which he would not annoy; For Kidd was passing to and fro, And seeking to destroy. He seized the vessel, plunged the knife Within the seamen's breast; And, by a cruel waste of life, His evil gains possessed. He then would make the nearest isle, And go at night by stealth, To hide within the earth awhile His last ill-gotten wealth. Thus many a shining wedge of gold This modern Achan hid; And many a frightful tale was told About the pirate Kidd. But Justice does not slumber long; If slow, she's ever sure. There 's none to artful, quick, or strong For her to make secure. To Boston, with a brazen face, The pirate boldly went, Where he was seized; and in disgrace And chains to England sent. The captain and his crew were there, A solemn, fearful sight, Resigning life high up in air, E'en at the gibbet's height. For many a year their bodies hung Along the river side, As beacons, showing old and young How they had lived and died. The wealth they hid was never found, Though often sought of men. 'T is where they placed it in the ground, Till they should come again! The earth has seemed by Heaven constrained The treasures to withhold. That price of blood has none obtained, Or used the pirate's gold! DAVID AND GOLIATH. Young David was a ruddy lad With silken, sunny locks, The youngest son that Jesse had: He kept his father's flocks. Goliath was a Philistine, A giant, huge and high; He lifted, like a towering pine, His head towards the sky. He was the foe of Israel's race, A mighty warrior, too; And on he strode from place to place, And many a man he slew. So Saul, the king of Israel then, Proclaimed it to and fro, That most he 'd favor of his men The one, who 'd kill the foe. Yet all, who saw this foe draw near, Would feel their courage fail; For not an arrow, sword, or spear, Could pierce the giant's mail. But Jesse's son conceived a way, That would deliverance bring; Whereby he might Goliath slay, And thus relieve the king. Then quick he laid his shepherd's crook Upon a grassy bank; And off he waded in the brook From which the lambkins drank. He culled and fitted to his sling Five pebbles, smooth and round; And one of these he meant should bring The giant to the ground. “I 've killed a lion and a bear,” Said he, “and now I'll slay The Philistine, and by the hair I'll bring his head away!” Then onward to the battle-field The youthful hero sped; He knew Goliath by his shield, And by his towering head. But when, with only sling and staff, The giant saw him come, In triumph he began to laugh; Yet David struck him dumb. He fell! 't was David's puny hand That caused his overthrow! Though long the terror of the land, A pebble laid him low. The blood from out his forehead gushed, He rolled, and writhed, and roared. The little hero on him rushed, And drew his ponderous sword. Before its owner's dying eye He held the gleaming point Upon his throbbing neck to try; Then severed cord and joint. He took the head, and carried it And laid it down by Saul, And showed him where the pebble hit That caused the giant's fall. The boy, who had Goliath slain With pebbles and a sling, Was raised, in after years, to reign As Israel's second king! 'T was not the courage, skill, or might, Which David had, alone, That helped him Israel's foe to fight And conquer, with a stone. But, when the shepherd stripling went Goliath thus to kill, God used him as an instrument, His purpose to fulfil! THE LIGHT BALLOON. Spirits that dwell in the world of air! Your voices and viewless harps attune, To bid me hail! as I enter there— I'm coming! I'm coming! the light balloon! Ye that have flown to seek me here, Spread your gentle and buoyant wings, To waft me off, till I mount and clear From the sight and the sound of earthly things! Now, the mark of a thousand eyes, But soon to fade from the mortal view; Away! away! to the shining skies, I, like a spirit, am speeding, too. Ye who stand on your rolling ball, The shadowy earth, the clouds will soon Lie between us, and hide you all, Like an ocean of waves, from the light balloon! Yonder sable, vapory mass, So big with the bolt that would strike me through, I shall approach, elude, and pass; And glide up, up to the pure, bright blue. My master's trusty and airy boat, Gallantly trimmed, my course I keep; Without a billow beneath, I float, A lonely sail, on the boundless deep. The sun! the sun is my polar star; I traverse a sea that has ne'er been crossed! The earth is gone! I have left it far Behind, as a speck, in the distance lost. Above the walks, and the tribes of men! Beyond the traces of human power! Out of the reach of the mortal ken! 'T is a perilous, strange, momentous hour! Now, my maker, I have thee here! Pray to thine own, for the needed boon Of His breath to waft, and His hand to steer, To a peaceful haven, thy light balloon! THE PHILOSOPHER WITH HIS KITE. Flying a kite! at a childish play! Is Franklin mad? Have his noble powers Of mind been crushed? Is this the way A wise Philosopher spends his hours? “I am not mad,” he calmly said, And gave the line to his silken kite, As into the regions of air she sped, And pulled for more, in upward flight. “I'm going to do what none has done, Since man has breathed, or the spheres have whirled; To show the lightning where to run, And to turn its point for the rising world! “The secret sparks, that the vapors wrap In their dusky folds, I'm going to bring Across my kite with her iron cap, And down to me on a hempen string. “Ere yonder threatening cloud shall wink, I'll make her carry her head so nigh To its sable face, she shall reach and drink At the fiery stream from its awful eye. “In truth and soberness now I aim, Though none before may have aimed so far, To lead the electric wildfire tame Out of the clouds, to fill my jar! “I'll bring on the world a debt, and such As the richest and greatest ne'er can pay, Till they for posterity do as much As, flying my kite, I do to-day!” THE STEAM-BOAT. If ever I venture again on the deep, And hope, with the night, for the blessings of sleep— To die to the real, and live in a dream, I'll not clear the land in a boat pushed by steam, To suffer the torture the helpless one feels, Entrapped in a ship made to run upon wheels! Can this be the wave with its light, foamy wreath, So much like a hard, rocky mountain, beneath The thundering keel and my quivering berth, That seem undergoing a quake of the earth, The while this sea-monster, with bowels of fire, Is jarring one's head like a toy upon wire? The creaking and dashing from timber and flood, And thoughts of the boiler are chilling my blood, As slowly I measure each wearisome hour, Deprived of all action, and freedom, and power; And hope but remains in one glimmering ray, That breath may be spared till the dawning of day. While through the long cabin, with pale, dying light, The dim, lonely lamp, adds but gloom to the night, At rest on their shelves, its dumb tenants recline, Like those of a tomb, as I view them from mine, And dare not to slumber, lest nightmare should put A stop to my heart, with her broad, leaden foot. O come, blessed morning, that I may arise To breathe the free air, and behold the bright skies! Return, holy light, and to order restore The nerves, that were never such rebels before; And let me go forth with the use of my heels, To flee from the ship made to run upon wheels. THE VIOLETS. Mary, thy violets are bright As when, a year ago, I traced Thy name upon the leaf of white, And in its fold thy gift was placed. Whene'er these cherished flowers I view, In form so fair, with living green And purple, still so rich and true; It seems as Mary's self were seen. I mark again the smile that played Upon thy lip, when they were thine; And hear thy gentle words, that made The little fragrant beauties mine. How sweet it is to have a flower Impressed with thoughts of one that's dear; To make the past a present hour, And hold the absent ever near! A simple leaf may brush a tear, Or chase a cloud of care away— May touch, with pleasant sounds, the ear, Illumine night, and brighten day. 'T will work a charm about the heart, And fill with balm its deep regrets: And such has been the tender part Performed by thy sweet Violets! THE WHITE FLOWER. She did not know, when she gave thee me, How sweet a comforter thou wouldst be To her pensive friend in the secret need, Which the traveller feels from the tramp of steed, The wavering coach, and a lonely hour In a stranger group, my fair White Flower! When the rumbling sound of the wheels was heard, And made me hasten the parting word, She plucked thee up from thy native place, While the soul looked full from her speaking face; And all she felt at the long farewell, She left for her tender flower to tell. Thou beautiful thing! 't was a holy thought, To give me a work which my Maker wrought; So pure and perfect, to soothe the mind, In the rattling cage as I sit confined, While it rolls along in the beaten track, And my form goes on, but my heart goes back. I'll cast my mantle 'twixt thee and harm, From a neighborly skirt, a hostile arm, Or a cape astray, whose fall or brush Thy delicate head might wound or crush; And then, my small, but eloquent friend, We'll sweetly commune, to my journey's end. For He will carry me safely there, Who made thy slenderest root his care!— He formed the eye that delights to see, And the soul that loves to contemplate thee, We both are the works of his wondrous power! In silence we'll praise him, my sweet White Flower. THE YELLOW BIRD. They've caught my little brother, And he was to me a twin! They stole him from our mother, And the cage has shut him in! I flitted by and found him, Where he looked so sad and sick, With the gloomy wires around him, As he crouched upon a stick. And, when I tried to cheer him With the cherry in my bill, To see me there so near him, Oh! it made him sadder still. His tender eye was shining With the brightness of despair, With sorrow and repining, As he bade me have a care! He said they 'd come and take me, As they 'd taken him; and then A hopeless prisoner make me, In the fearful hands of men:— That once in their dominion, I should have to pine away, And never stretch a pinion, To my very dying day:— That the wings that God had made him For freedom in the air, Since man had thus betrayed him, Were stiff and useless there. And, the little darling fellow, As he showed his golden vest, He said, beneath the yellow, He 'd a sad and aching breast:— That since he 'd been among them, They had ruffled it so much, The only song he 'd sung them, Was a shriek beneath their touch. How can they love to see him So sickly and so sad, When, if they would but free him, He 'd be so well and glad? My little hapless brother! I would fain his bondage share: I never had another, And he 's a captive there! TO A ROBIN. Robin, robin, sing to me, And I'll gladly suffer thee Thus to breakfast in the tree, On the ruddy cherry. Soon as thou hast swallowed it, How I love to see thee flit To another twig, and sit Singing there so merry! It was kind in thee to fly Near my window; and to try There to raise thy notes so high, As to break my slumbers. Robin, half the cheering power Of this bright and lovely hour, While I pluck the dewy flower, Comes from thy sweet numbers. And thou wast an honest bird, Thus to let thy voice be heard, Asking, in the plainest word Thou could'st utter, whether Those, who owned it, would allow Thee to take upon the bough Thy repast, and sit, as now, Smoothing down thy feather. Who, that hears the mellow note From my robin's little throat On the air of morning float, Could desire to still her? Who her beauty can behold, And consent to have it told, That he had a heart so cold, As to try to kill her? THE SILK-WORM'S WILL. On a plain rush hurdle a silk-worm lay, When a proud young princess came that way: The haughty child of a human king Threw a sidelong glance at the humble thing, That received with silent gratitude From the mulberry leaf her simple food, And shrunk, half scorn and half disgust, Away from her sister child of the dust; Declaring she never yet could see Why a reptile form like this should be; And that she was not made with nerves so firm, As calmly to stand by a “crawling worm!” With mute forbearance the silk-worm took The taunting words and the spurning look. Alike a stranger to self and pride, She 'd no disquiet from aught beside; And lived of a meekness and peace possessed, Which these debar from the human breast. She only wished, for the harsh abuse, To find some way to become of use To the haughty daughter of lordly man; And thus did she lay a noble plan To teach her wisdom, and make it plain That the humble worm was not made in vain; A plan so generous, deep and high, That, to carry it out, she must even die! “No more,” said she, “will I drink or eat! I'll spin and weave me a winding-sheet, To wrap me up from the sun's clear light, And hide my form from her wounded sight. In secret then, till my end draws nigh, I'll toil for her; and, when I die, I'll leave behind, as a farewell boon To the proud young princess, my whole cocoon, To be reeled and wove to a shining lace, And hung in a veil o'er her scornful face! And when she can calmly draw her breath Through the very threads that have caused my death; When she finds, at length, she has nerves so firm, As to wear the shroud of a crawling worm, May she bear in mind, that she walks with pride In the winding-sheet where the silk-worm died!” THE WHIRLWIND. “Whirlwind, Whirlwind! whither art thou hieing, Snapping off the flowers young and fair; Setting all the chaff and the withered leaves to flying; Tossing up the dust in the air?” “I,” said the whirlwind, “cannot stop for talking; Give me up your cap, my little man, And the polished stick, that you will not need for walking, While you run to catch them, if you can! “Yonder pretty maiden—none has time to tell her That I'm coming, ere I shall be there. I will twirl her zephyr, snatch her light umbrella, Seize her hat, and brush her glossy hair!” On went the whirlwind, showing many capers, One would hardly deem it meet to tell; Dusting priest and lawyer, flirting gown and papers, Discomposing matron, beau, and belle. Whisk! from behind came the long and sweeping feather, Round the head of old Chanticleer. Plumed and plumeless bipeds felt the blast together, In a way they would not like to hear. Snug in an arbor sat a scholar, musing Calmly o'er the philosophic page. “Flap!” went the leaves of the volume he was using, Cutting short the lecture of the sage. “Hey!” said the book-worm, “this, I think, is taking Rather too much liberty with me. Yet, I'll not resent it; for I'm bent on making Use of every thing I hear and see. “Many, I know, will not their anger stifle, When as little cause as this they find To let it kindle up; but minding every trifle Is profitless, as quarrels with the wind! “Forth to his business, when the whirlwind sallies, He is all alive to get it done. He on his pathway never lags nor dallies, But is always up and on the run. “Though ever whirling, never growing dizzy; Motion gives him buoyancy and power. All who have known him, own that he is busy, Doing much in half a fleeting hour. “O, there is nothing, when our work 's before us, Like despatch; for while our time is brief, Some sweeping blast may suddenly come o'er us, Lose our place, and turn another leaf! “Whirlwind, Whirlwind! though you're but a flurry, And so odd the business you pursue, Though you come on, and are off in such a hurry, I have caught a hint,—and now, adieu.” THE YANKEE TEA-PARTY. King George sat high on his family throne, The “lord of the isles,” that were fairly his own, And might have sufficed, had his majesty known The folly of coveting more. But, seeking a tribute his pomp to maintain, He reached from his island to grasp at the main, Intending his coffers should swell with the gain Brought off from a distant shore. And when he had summoned, in solemn array, His ministers round him to canvass the way In which they might make the Americans pay The costs of the royal court, “Our liege,” said they, “there 's many a ship That might be sent out on an Eastern trip, And freighted with tea for the New World to sip, And do it for our support.” “'T is done!” said the king, “and 't is a bright thought! For this kind of sponging is easily wrought; The ships shall with Indian leaves be fraught, And sent to our subject land. We'll make Columbia swallow our tea, And pay the duty, far over the sea, On every pound, for our ‘powers that be,’ To put in our royal hand!” And so, in due season, and true royal state, With their sails puffed out, and their heads held straight, When the ships rode up, with their well-packed freight, To the shores of the Western World, This order imperious echoed around, “The teas must be bought, and the buyer is bound To pay us a duty on every pound,” As the canvass in port was furled. But, “No!” said the Friends in the city of Penn, “George is a mortal, and Quakers are men! Your leaves may float off o'er the ocean again; For soberly we protest, That we never will open a traitorous door To let such a cargo come into a store! Unentered, unopened, withdraw from our shore The treasures of every chest!” And “No!” was the word in the place of the Dutch; “'T is grinding our faces a little too much, Broad as they be! and your teas shall not touch Our land, while by us it is trod! The duty we owe to ourselves and the throne, Is not to be crushed by a foot like our own! And that of the Briton is quite overgrown. We'll have it more tightly shod!” But the spirited Yankees knew just the thing That would suit themselves, if it did n't the king, And when the proud sails came flying to bring Their freight o'er the glassy bay, They met and agreed that 't would not be right His majesty's offer of tea to slight; For they viewed the affair in a national light, As they showed in a national way. They joined in a council; and, forming a band, Arrayed like the genuine sons of the land, In blanket and feather, with hatchet in hand, And their faces and limbs o'erlaid With a copper-hued coating of paint, they took Their way to the ships, while the tomahawks shook; And their wild “pow-wow” made the royalist look Aghast for the turn of his trade. “Come,” said the visiters, “now for our tea! We'll take it on deck, if you please, and see, Of gunpowder, souchong, skin, hyson, bohea, Which flavor we like the best!” Then, box after box came up close packed; And lid after lid was smitten and cracked! As the red hand worked, and the tomahawk hacked, And entered the odorous chest. “This,” said the company, “this is the way That we, the Yankees, are going to pay Our duty on teas, and help to defray The cost of the kingly cup. We 're going to leave every pound to steep, With its impost on, in the boiling deep— In a good, strong brine, where we guess it will keep Till the Parliament draws it up!” Then, over the sides of the ship they poured The treasures of every box on board, Till the cargo was out, and the dock was floored With the leaves of the Indian tree! “We'll let,” cried they, “old England know, That, bending too much, she may break the bow! Columbia's spirit can 't stoop so low As three pence a pound on tea!” THE PIONEERS. Thy waves, proud Ohio, in majesty roll Through banks with rich verdure and flowers fitly dressed, Like the strong tide of mind—like the bright flow of soul, That heaves nobly on to the fair, blooming West. Thy music is set to the motion of years, Like thee, bearing down to a fathomless flood; But ours, to the march of the bold Pioneers, Who purchased thy borders with peril and blood. They fearless went forth, where the red heathen foe With tomahawk raised, as in ambush he lay, And poison-tipped arrows to speed from his bow, Concealed like a serpent, infested the way. They saw the tall flame, when the council-fire glared Along the deep gloom through the wilderness spread. They heard the loud whoop, when the knife was prepared Its trophy to cleave from the white victim's head! The apple tree then, 'mid the trees of the wood, They reared among savages human and brute, And felled the dark forest around it that stood, To let in the sun-beams, and ripen the fruit. Their footsteps are traced by the lily and vine; Where they lopped the boughs, stands the full-headed sheaf, And here, from the pillow, the oil and the wine, The weary find rest, and the wounded relief. Where all was in nature's first wildness and night, Till they ventured forth, an invincible band, The Sun of eternity pours down his light— The beauty of holiness spreads o'er the land! Roll on, proud Ohio! So long as the voice That sounds from thy waters posterity hears, 'T will come in bold numbers to hearts that rejoice, In chorus responding, “The brave Pioneers!” REQUIEM FOR LAFAYETTE. He's gone to his home! Like a well-ripened sheaf, The ear in its fulness and sear in its leaf; The angels have borne him with joy to the skies; The portals of heaven have closed on their prize. He 's gone, like the sun at the dying of day, When shades veil the earth, as his light fades away! In greatness he rose, and in glory he shone, Till claimed by the world, while the world was his own. He 's gone, like the waters in brightness that flow; While verdure and flowers clothe their banks as they go, Till, forth to the deep, in their grandeur they roll; He 's gone to the ocean, the home of his soul! He 's gone! and the nations in sackcloth are dressed; They mingle their tears round the place of his rest: But none, like Columbia, lingers to weep, The friend of her youth, with his fathers asleep. He watched o'er her childhood—he saw her young form Arise in its beauty, 'mid darkness and storm. Her sighs, like an orphan's, are heavily drawn, While speaks the cold marble, “He 's gone! he is gone!” LEXINGTON'S DEAD. This Ode was sung over the disinterred remains of those who fell in the battle of Lexington, before they were entombed under the monument, on the sixtieth anniversary of the day on which they fell. They come from the grave to attest to the story That we, of their struggle for Liberty, tell!— From silence and shade, that her mantle of glory May fold o'er the first of her Martyrs who fell! They come, that the balm of her breath may perfume them, And peacefully then to return to their rest; That we, from her arms, may receive and entomb them, Assured that they once have reposed on her breast. All hail, sacred Relics! from sixty years' sleeping Beneath the green turf, where so freely ye bled; Who, shrouded in gore, still the battle-ground keeping, Forsook not the field, though your vital fire fled! In valor's proud bed, with its rich purple o'er you, The first blood for Freedom that gushed on the sod, Ye lay, when the souls, to the onset that bore you, Had passed with her cause, through your wounds, to their God. Behold, blessed Spirits, who, nobly defending Your country, rushed forth from your dwellings of clay, The tribute of sorrow and joy we are blending To you, o'er their dear hallowed ruins, to pay! The hearts of a nation, your monument rearing, Have built it of gratitude, fair and sublime. It rises to heaven, your honored names bearing, With earth not to sink, nor to crumble with time. The ground that, as brothers, in pain ye were sowing, Imbosomed the seed for a root firm and deep, When life's crimson fountains were opened and flowing To moisten the soil for the harvest we reap! Forgive, then, the view that we take, ere we sever From these broken walls, that for us ye forsook! On them or their like again never, O never, Are we, or the eye that is mortal, to look! We give them to earth, till the Saviour, descending With beauty for ashes, and glory for gloom, Shall speak, while the dead to his voice are attending, And life, light, and freedom are poured through the tomb! LIBERTY. AN ODE FOR THE CELEBRATION OF THE BATTLE OF LEXINGTON. Dear is our Liberty, For great the price that bought her; And dear the memory Of those, who nobly sought her! When war awoke with din and smoke, By numerous foes surrounded, With bartered life, they braved the strife, In death their arms were grounded! How blest the memory Of those, who stood defying The foes of Liberty, And breathed her name in dying! Take, holy Liberty, Their story on thy pinion, And wing it high and free, Throughout thy proud dominion! Their blood was free and warm for thee, From fearless bosoms streaming; Like stars, on thine, their deeds must shine, To all the nations beaming. Then, keep thy balmy wing Still growing broad and broader, And let their story ring To Earth's remotest border! Fair daughter of the skies, As million after million, In other days, shall rise Beneath thy wide pavilion, There may they find their names enshrined, Their memory, green and spreading, That all may know to whom they owe The gifts thy hand is shedding! O live, sweet Liberty, The course of time pervading, Here may thy glory be Still pure, and never fading! COLUMBIA'S BIRTH-DAY. AN ODE FOR THE FOURTH OF JULY. We hail Columbia's Natal Day, And see its glories shine, To light the votive gifts we lay At Freedom's holy shrine! This hallowed day our fathers gave The shout of “Liberty!” And, by their spirits and the glave, Avowed their country free! They fearless then the battle braved, And stood the haughty foe. Where light and high their banner waved, They laid oppression low. But warm the noble hearts that bled Where freedom's vot'ries knelt! Her altar's flame with life was fed, Their foreign chains to melt. In blood and death our laurels grew, With verdure ne'er to cease: They shone impearled with sorrow's dew, Beside the branch of peace! On piercing thorns our fathers trod, In this bright land of ours, To soften for their sons the sod Now strewed with fruits and flowers. Then sacred be our Liberty! And may its glory beam On every wave that man shall see, Of time's resistless stream! We bid the children keep in sight The spirit of the sire— To hold the watch-tower, and to light, Betimes, the beacon-fire! We bid the millions, who shall rise When we have passed away, With joy to hail, and ever prize, Columbia's Natal Day! WORSHIP BY THE ROSE TREE. Author of beauty, Spirit of Power, Thou, who didst will that the Rose should be,— Here is the place, and this is the hour To feel thy presence and bow to thee! Bright is the world with the sun's first rays; Clear is the dew on the soft, green sod; The Rose Tree blooms, while the birds sing praise, And earth gives glory to nature's God. Under this beautiful work of thine, The flowery boughs, that are bending o'er The glistening turf, to thy will divine I kneel, and its Maker and mine adore. Thou art around us. Thy robe of light Touches the gracefully waving tree, Turning to jewels the tears of night, And making the buds unfold to thee. Traced is thy name in delicate lines On flower and leaf, as they dress the stem. Thy care is seen, and thy wisdom shines In even the thorn, that is guarding them. Now, while the Rose, that has burst her cup, Opens her heart, and freely throws To me her odors, I offer up Thanks to the Being, who made the Rose! THE MOURNER'S ADDRESS TO A MINIATURE. Bright image of her lovely face, Who was my spirit's life and light, 'T is agony thy looks to trace,— 'T is more, to have thee out of sight. To see thee, and remember where Thy fair original is laid, But brings the tortures of despair From the sad ruins death has made. To think how this kind, angel eye, Once beamed on me—and then, to feel How deep the shades that on it lie— 'T is to my heart like barbed steel. I have a lock of sunny hair, That lay upon this snowy brow; Its lustre is not dimmed; but where— Oh! where 's the forehead's beauty now? I have the precious golden band, That round her taper finger shone. The ring is bright; but how 's the hand— The hand for which I gave my own? I have her pledge of early love, When Joy's fresh fount was clear and high. Her gift is near; her soul—above! Her form is—where?—earth must reply! I had a home; and there I found Delights like those of Paradise. Its very name is now a sound That chills, when heard, my veins to ice. My wounded spirit grows estranged To all the scenes of life below; The world and I at once are changed; I long a higher home to know. My love must linger near the dead, With fondness that can never die, Till that which loves and mourns hath fled, And dust and dust together lie. On thee, thou dear but silent thing! I look and doat: Oh! speak to me— Speak! for my heart, at every string, Is wrung, and bleeding over thee! THE SOLITARY MAN. He had not sought the joy sublime, Nor made the goodly pearl secure, That will defy the power of time, And through eternity endure. And yet, he needed them; for all His fondly-cherished hopes had fled; And peace to him was past recall— He lived, while those he loved were dead! His spirit bowed not in his grief, For balm, before his Father's throne. From sympathy he shunned relief, And moved in crowds, but felt alone. He bent his footsteps to the tomb, A sad and solitary man; And there, 'mid silence, death and gloom, To kindred dust his plaint began: “I stand, while all around me lie Composed in slumber long and deep. Where darkness sits on every eye, 'T is mine alone to wake and weep! Amid the hearts that once would leap In welcome of my coming feet, I feel my lonely life-stream creep; For not another breast will beat. “The arms that spread so quick to twine Around me, now no more I fill. The hand, once fondly locked in mine, Is here beside me, cold and still. I sigh, I feel, I think alone; For not a dream is passing here. 'T is all oblivion! and my groan Unheeded falls on every ear. “And have the ties affection wove So close, so tender, ended thus? Does nature form our souls for love To sport with, and to torture us? I long this weary load of life To lay aside, and be at rest— To end at once the pain and strife That slowly now consume my breast. “But earth! earth! earth! it is not so, That I may yet thy part dismiss; And forth to other scenes I go, With all my soul confined to this! For, when the busy world shall claim That I amid its throngs appear, I shall be there in form and name, While all beside will linger here. “I now must join the noisy crowd, To hold their pleasures light as air; Yet, not like one whom grief has bowed, Or sorrow marked, will I be there. The world's rude hand I would not trust Too near my bosom's bleeding strings; For these, beloved and hallowed dust! 'Twixt God and us are sacred things. “Its careless eye shall never see The wounds it has no balm to heal. Its look of pity, turned on me, I would not—could not bear to feel. Before it I will wear a smile, To veil the void it cannot fill; Though deep within my breast the while I feel the arrow rankling still. “The light of mirth may then be found Upon my lip, but there alone. My voice may even mock its sound, To drown my weeping spirit's moan. But what's the heartless world to me, Since ye, my loved ones, slumber here? I stand on earth, a blighted tree, With winter round me all the year!” “Thou barren tree!” a voice then said, And to his soul; “with leaves and flowers I 've clothed thee well; and o'er thee shed The richest gifts of sun and showers! And now, if I should cut thee down, For giving back no fruit to me, To lie beneath my withering frown, It were not rest and peace for thee! “An earthly, dark, and sterile heart Yields not the fruits of faith and love, That should, for thine immortal part, Be ripened here, and stored above. Frail man! thy Maker's hand is kind, In each severe and chastening blow. The gold that is for heaven refined, It tries and polishes below!” THE CHILD'S ADDRESS TO THE KENTUCKY MUMMY. And now, Mistress Mummy, since thus you've been found By the world, that has long done without you, In your snug little hiding-place far under ground— Be pleased to speak out, as we gather around, And let us hear something about you! By the style of your dress, you are not Madam Eve— You of course had a father and mother; No more of your line have we power to conceive, As you furnish us nothing by which to believe You had husband, child, sister, or brother. We know you have lived, though we cannot tell when, And that, too, by eating and drinking, To judge by your teeth, and the lips you had then; And we see you are one of the children of men, Though long from their looks you 've been shrinking. Who was it that made you a cavern so deep, Refused your poor head a last pillow, And bade you sit still when you 'd sunken to sleep, And they 'd bound you and muffled you up in a heap Of clothes made of hempen and willow? Say, whose was the ear that could hear with delight The musical trinket found nigh you? And who had the eye that was pleased with the sight Of this form (whose queer face might be brown, red, or white,) Trick'd out in the jewels kept by you? THE ESCAPE OF THE DOVES. Come back, pretty doves! O, come back from the tree, You bright, little fugitive things! We would not have thought you so ready and free In using your beautiful wings. We did not suppose, when we lifted the lid To see if you knew how to fly, You 'd all flutter off in a moment, and bid The basket forever good by! Come down, and we'll feast you on insects and seeds; You sha 'nt have occasion to roam— We'll give you all things that a bird ever needs To make it contented at home. Then come, pretty doves! O, return for our sakes, And do n't keep away from us thus; Or, when your old slumbering master awakes, 'T will be a sad moment for us! “We can't!” said the birds, “and the basket may stand A long time in waiting; for now You find out too late, that a bird in the hand Is worth, at least, two on the bough. “And we, from our height, looking down on you there, By experience taught to be sage, Find one pair of wings, that are free in the air, Are worth two or three in the cage. “But, when our old master awakes, and shall find The work you have just been about, We hope, by the freedom we love, he 'll be kind, And spare you for letting us out. “We thank you for all the fine stories you tell, And all the good things you would give; But think, since we 're out, we shall do very well Where nature designed us to live. “Whenever you think of the swift little wings, On which from your reach we have flown, No doubt, you'll beware, and not meddle with things, In future, that are not your own.” THE TWO THIEVES. A lady, they called her Miss Mouse, In a slate-colored dress, like a Quaker, Once lived in a snug little house, Of which she herself was the maker. There lived in another, close by, A dame, whom they called Lady Kitty; But that she was stationed so nigh, Miss Mouse often thought a great pity. For she, though so soberly clad, And never inclined to ill-speaking, Had often a fancy to gad, Or more than her own might be seeking. She did not then like to be scanned, Or questioned, respecting her duty, When some little theft she had planned, Or seen coming home with her booty. So modest she was, and so shy, Although an inveterate sinner, She 'd nip out her part of the pie Before it was brought up to dinner. She held that 't was folly to ask For what her own wits would allow her; And, making her way through the cask, She helped herself well to the flour. The candles she scraped to their wicks, And, mischievous in her invention, Would do many more naughty tricks, Which I, as her friend, cannot mention. Kit, too, had her living to make, And yet, she was so above toiling, She 'd sooner attack the beaf-steak, When the cook had prepared it for broiling. And so, near a dish of warm toast, She often most patiently lingered, To seize her first chance; yet, could boast That none ever called her light-fingered. But mending, or minding herself, She thought would be quite too much labor, And so peeped about on the shelf, To spy out the faults of her neighbor. For Mouse loved to peditate there! While Kit would watch close to waylay her; And once, in the midst of her fare, Up bounded Miss Kitty to slay her! But this was as luckless a jump As ever Kit made, with the clatter Of knife, skimmer, spoon, and a thump, Which she got, as she threw down the platter. While Mouse glided under a dish, Escaping the mortal disaster, Miss Kitty turned off to a fish, The breakfast elect for her master. Said she to herself, “'t is clear gain,— This rarity, fresh from the water, Will save my white mittens the stain, And me from the trouble of slaughter!” But her racket, she found to her cost, The plot had most fatally thickened; And all hope of mercy was lost, As Jack's coming footstep was quickened. He seized her, and binding her fast, Declared he could never forgive her; So Kitty was sentenced, and cast, With a stone at her neck, in the river! But Mouse still continued to thieve; And often, alone in her dwelling, Would silently laugh in her sleeve, At the scene in the tale I've been telling. Till once, by a fatal mishap, The little unfortunate rover Perceived herself close in a trap, And felt that her race was now over. She knew she must leave all behind; And thus, in the midst of her terrors, As every thing rushed to her mind, Began her confession of errors: “You'll find, on the word of a Mouse, Whom hope has forever forsaken, The following things in my house, Which I have unlawfully taken:— “A cork, that was soaked in the beer, Which I nibbled until I was merry; Some kernels of corn from the ear, The skin and the stone of a cherry: “Some hemp-seed I took from the bird, And found most deliciously tasted, While safe in my covert, I heard Its owner complain that 't was wasted: “You'll find a few cucumber seeds, Which I thought, if they could but be hollowed, Would answer to string out for beads; So the inside of all I have swallowed: “A few crumbs of biscuit and cheese, Which I thought might a long time supply me With luncheon—some rice and split peas, Which seemed well prepared to keep by me: “A cluster of curls, which I stole At night from a young lady's toilet, And made me a bed of it whole, As tearing it open would spoil it; “And as, in a long, summer day I 'd time both for reading and spelling, I gnawed up the whole of a play, And carried it home to my dwelling. “I wish you 'd set fire to my place, And pray you at once to despatch me, That none of my enemy's race, In the form of Miss Kitty, may catch me!” Disgrace thus will follow on vice, Although for a while it be hidden; When children, or kittens, or mice, Will do what they know is forbidden. JEMMY STRING. I knew a little heedless boy, A child that seldom cared, If he could get his cake and toy, How other matters fared. He always bore upon his foot A signal of the thing, For which, on him his playmates put The name of Jemmy String. No malice in his heart was there; He had no fault beside, So great as that of wanting care To keep his shoe-strings tied. You 'd often see him on the run, To chase the geese about, While both his shoe-ties were undone, With one end slipping out. He 'd tread on one, then down he'd go, And all around would ring With bitter cries, and sounds of woe, That came from Jemmy String. And oft, by such a sad mishap, Would Jemmy catch a hurt; The muddy pool would catch his cap, His clothes would catch the dirt! Then home he 'd hasten through the street, To tell about his fall; While, on his little sloven feet, The cause was plain to all. For while he shook his aching hand, Complaining of the bruise, The strings were trailing through the sand From both his loosened shoes. One day, his father thought a ride Would do his children good; But Jemmy's shoe-strings were untied, And on the stairs he stood. In hastening down to take his place Upon the carriage seat, Poor Jemmy lost his joyous face; Nor could he keep his feet. The dragging string had made him trip, And bump! bump! went his head;— The teeth had struck and cut his lip, And tears and blood were shed. His aching wounds he meekly bore; But, with a swelling heart, He heard the carriage from the door, With all but him, depart. This grievous lesson taught him care, And gave his mind a spring; For he resolved no more to bear The name of Jemmy String! THE EMIGRANTS FROM THE GRANITE HILLS. RECITED AT THE BUCKEYE CELEBRATION IN OHIO. O, why do they go, as a lost, roving planet, A bright group of souls to a region afar, Like sparks stricken out from their own hills of granite, Combined but to make up a wandering star? “To find them a home where the wild deer is leaping O'er turf that the white man has yet never trod; Where free and unstartled the foxes are sweeping The flower from the grass, and the dew from the sod!” But what will they do, when the heavy rains pouring Shall stream from the boughs o'er their shelterless heads; While through the dark forest the night winds are roaring, And near them the bear, or the Indian treads? “While echo to echo is merrily telling The blows, the tall trees in their pride cannot stand, They'll smite their firm trunks till they turn to a dwelling To lodge the bold bosom that's nerving the hand.” And what, for a seed-time and harvest to tame it, At first, will they do with the wild, fallow ground, While still, as the land of his fathers, to claim it The savage is gloomily stalking around? “A price they will offer, and prompt to bestow it, To share with the red man the soil for its worth. But they too are men, and will soon let him know it, If still he denies them a portion of earth.” And what will they do for their sons and their daughters, Who hear how their boat glided o'er the blue stream, And touched the wild shore of the soft, curling waters, While all seems to them as the things of a dream? “They'll leave them a beautiful Eden! and Clio, Delighting to roam o'er a region so fair, Will waken her lute to the land of Ohio, And show the green Buckeye LEAF decking her hair!” THE SPANISH GIRL. A fair, young Andalusian maid Was out on the bank of a winding river, As down through a flow'ry vale it strayed, To lose itself in the Guadalquiver: And the girl was chasing a butterfly Alone, when the son of her king came by. She ran, while the pure, fresh morning air With her light Mantilla's head was playing; It flushed her cheek; and her raven hair In its loosened locks to the wind was straying. But it never entered the maiden's mind, That the son of her king was close behind. But he, while he gazed on her beaming face And sylph-like form, felt his heart grow tender: So he thought, sub rosa, he 'd watch the chase, To see where the hope of her prize would send her. A clump of flower-shrubs wove a screen, And he stepped behind it to view the scene. Though bright were the colors the insect wore, The soft black eyes of the maid were brighter; And light little feet the pursuer bore, But the wing of the fugitive still was lighter: For, every time that it tired and lit, She crept near enough just to startle it. At length it tacked with a lazy whirl, Like a sportive child with its fellow playing; While after it ran the delighted girl, The whim of a butterfly still obeying. Intent on the jewel, that charmed her eye, She still saw not that the prince was nigh. But soon it lit on an osier bough, And seemed, for a moment, calmly sleeping. Said the joyous girl, “I will have thee now!” But she heeded not that the waves were sweeping Along the bank, where the osier threw Its frail arms out, and the tall grass grew. She gave one bound, and the pleasing snare, That the wily insect laid, had caught her; A quick, faint cry to the passing air, And her light young form met the cold, dark water! But the noble heir of the Spanish throne, To save her life, quite forgot his own. For, swift as a dart from the tight-drawn string, He flew to the stream for the sinking maiden; And the youthful arms of the future king Came up with their precious trophy laden; While the wildered girl thought a minister Of heaven had come down to rescue her. But soon he proved he belonged to earth, And to link her fate to his own besought her. He gave her the rank of a royal birth, As a prince's bride and a monarch's daughter;— The first fair maid ever raised so high By the playful wings of a butterfly! THE LOCK OF HAIR. These lines were written on receiving an envelope containing a lock of hair shorn from a beloved friend recently departed. Not the white cov'ring that bespoke The shroud that wraps her youthful form; Not the black seal, as slow it broke; Nor the round tear-drop, quick and warm;— Not these, could that bright lock disguise; Well I knew it, through them all: While her glad spirit, from the skies, Seemed asking, why that tear should fall. For she, upon whose placid brow The precious gift so lately shone, Is crowned with life, an angel now, In glory near her Maker's throne. Rejoined to friends, who went before To lure her to a world of bliss, She fondly bends, and watches o'er The loved ones she has left in this. She points them to the blessed beam Of that great Sun, whose cheering light Shone o'er the tide of death's cold stream, And then dissolved her faith in sight! The well-known lock of auburn hair, That once was her's—that now is mine, Will oft to pensive memory bear The lovely, sainted Caroline. THE OLD YEAR'S PRAYER. With a hoary head, And with pinions spread Forever to take its flight, In pensive mood, As the Old Year stood Beside your beds one night— He said, “They sleep; So I will keep Watch till my hour is o'er; For, when the hand Of the clock shall stand At twelve, I must be no more! “But I will not break Their repose, to take My leave of the race of man: I will breathe a prayer On the midnight air;” And 't was thus his prayer began: “Author of time and eternity, Reader of every secret thought— Thou, who meetest the bound to me, Giver of all, which the year has brought,— “May the children that slumber here, Sweetly wrapped in their midnight dreams, Waken to hail a blest New Year, With hearts as pure as the morning beams! “Should they remember an hour, or day Of me, which they 've vainly spent, may all Be forgiven by thee, I pray, For the loss of time, which is past recall! “And by that loss may they learn to prize The precious time that may hence be given; Regarding every hour that flies As a winged minister sent from heaven; “Some useful lesson, or guiltless joy, Or work of virtue, while each may bring, For the smiling girl and the happy boy, To snatch for their own from his fleeting wing. “Now do I hear thy commanding word Summon me hence—for my work is done!” The clock struck twelve! and no more was heard Till the voice of the New Year sounded “one!” THE FATHER. I'm breaking down! I'm breaking down, An aged, sapless tree! My head but wears a snowy crown— 'T is winter time with me. O, may the scions from my root, That flourish green and high, Be good, and yield a precious fruit Before, like me, they die! The pruning-knife whene'er they feel Beneath their owner's care, Though keen, 't will only wound to heal, To make them bloom and bear. They now are young, and fair, and sound; While I am in decay: In peace I leave to them the ground; I drop, and pass away. Yet, though my dust in earth be laid; My life from earth withdrawn; 'T will be but as a fleeing shade Of night, before the dawn! For I shall spring beyond the tomb To new, immortal prime, Where all is light, and life, and bloom; And no more winter time! A VOICE TO THE MOURNER. “And the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.” Rev. xxii. 2. Would'st thou recall me, sorrowing child of earth, Would'st thou recall me to my sleeping clay? Time's richest treasures, all its joys are worth, One breath of heaven would sweep, as dust, away! I 've done with all the shadow forms, That mortals yet pursue; The changing hues—the vapor lights, That shine to mock their view! I'm safe above the thorny paths They still must travel through! Would'st thou recall me, there again to stray? Here shines the glory, cloud shall never shade; Here flows the fountain of eternal joy: This tree of life hath leaves that cannot fade— Balm pure and healing—fruits that never cloy! Now, of love, and faith, and hope, Comes the sure reward. We are crowned, an angel band; In a sweet accord, Singing to our golden harps, “Holy is the Lord!” Would'st thou recall me from the blest employ? THE SILVER SHOWER. Look above! little flower, For, a bright silver shower, I descend cool and clear o'er thy head. While in dust thou art bowed, I am sent from the cloud, And shall fall fresh and soft on thy bed. Of my pearls, coming down, I will form thee a crown, To encircle thy brow young and fair. Every leaf on thy stem Will I tip with a gem; Every bud sparkling diamonds shall wear. In the earth will I sink To thy root, for its drink; Then unseen, with my life-giving power, To thy heart when I go, Let its sweet odors flow; And in praise look above, little flower! THE LAWGIVER'S GRAVE. “But no man knoweth his sepulchre, unto this day.”— Deut. xxxiv. 6. Come out from the desert, come over the sea, Ye winds, in your swiftness, and answer to me! O, tell me the spot undiscovered, that gave To Israel's leader his lone, hidden grave! The winds breathe no answer, as onward they sweep, To tell where the Lord laid his Prophet asleep. Come over the deep, feathered warblers, and sing The notes of your high Eastern anthems; and bring A leaf from the branches that throw their wild bloom, And pour out their balm o'er the Lawgiver's tomb! The birds give no sign, as they gayly go by; I hear their sweet voices, but not the reply. Ye angels, who buried him, come and reveal The clods of the vale, that ye left to conceal The dust of his form, who the mountain-side trod, With face bathed in light from the presence of God! An angel then whispered,—“We serve the Most High, And show not the things done alone for his eye!” THE AGED SAILOR. Farewell! farewell, my good old sail! Thou sport of zephyr, breeze, and gale; Where sun and cloud, snow, rain and hail Have tried their power on thee. Thy strength is gone, thy day is o'er; And thou shalt swell and speed no more, To waft my bark from shore to shore, Across a changeful sea. And I, like thee, am old and torn; My cord is loosed—my threads are worn; With many a storm of life I 've borne, When cold the skies, and dark. I have but one more flood to brave: Thou could'st not help me o'er its wave, Nor from those shadowy waters save My frail and lonely bark. Yet I must soon put off, and feel The threatening billows rock my keel; But heaven will there its light reveal; Nor let my compass fail To point me o'er that deep untried, Till I can safely stem the tide, And all the storms of time outride: Farewell, my good old sail! SUNRISE AT SEA. The sun! the sun! he mounts yon airy steep Below the line that bounds the rolling deep! The beauteous orient kindles at his face; Fast flee the shades to give his glory place. Day's herald star, that lingered like a tear On morn's dark eye-lash, as the sun draws near, Sinks in her blushing cheek before his power, Gone as a dew-drop buried in a flower. Now his warm beams are twinkling on the waves. Hail him, great ocean, from thy deepest caves! Give thy grand organ's bold, majestic swell: Send the glad mermaid from her pearly cell, Up the green islet in the soft, light air, To hymn the sun, and spread her amber hair! Bid all the dwellers in thy crystal coves Come forth to greet him, through thy coral groves, Lifting their various powers to catch the streams Of morning glory pouring from his beams! Behold, he shines upon thy watery hills! Thy deep green dells his flowing raiment fills. Thy little billows from their cradles leap For crowns of light; then play themselves to sleep. Drear wast thou, ocean, to the lonely bark, When brooding night sat on thee thick and dark, While sound, nor shape, nor shadow from the shore, Nor cheering ray, the pathless waste stole o'er! Then with thy rolling did'st thou seem to be A dismal, restless, round eternity, Whose awful mysteries yet unopened lay; Foretokened only by a fiery spray, And deep, unearthly voices, as they came All dissonant, in strangeness, all the same! More solemn this, than that primeval night Before thy Maker said, “Let there be light.” For then no human fear—no human thought, With fancy's colors, on the blackness wrought The past or future: they were yet confined To one clear present—the Eternal Mind. But now, transfigured by the radiant sun, Thy face is brightness from that glorious one. Thy mighty heart within thee seems to burn, With rapture glowing, at his blest return. Touched by the rays that played on Memnon's lyre, Thy voices melt to music with their fire, For higher, holier notes than his, to be Poured in the noble anthems of the sea. Hail! thou great luminary! Sun, all hail! Between two vast unfathomed seas I sail— Above, the proud, illimitable blue— Below, the flood no line has travelled through. Two empires woo my sight—the deep—the sky. Yet, who so abject, but for thee, as I? I 've nought beneath me, where my foot may stand; Above, no hold whereon to lock my hand; Around, but wild, thin air to mock my grasp, Should this frail bark her weary sides unclasp! And thou, this fluid solitude to light, Hast risen, a friend so cheering, warm and bright, In undivided love, as much my own As if just formed to shine for me alone! Yet art thou blessing all the distant land, Down from the mountain to the grain of sand. Pure type of his unbounded light and love, Who fills the earth, and all the world above, How great, how good, how glorious must he be Who gives his brightness shadowed forth in thee! Sun in thy beauty, ocean in thy might— Winds in your freedom—heavens in your height;— Dark must the spirit be, the vision dim, That could not here look through you all to Him! THE MOUNT OF SACRIFICE. “And he said, Behold the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for the burnt-offering?”— Gen. xxii. 1. “Is this our weary journey's end, That rose from far to sight?” “Yea; and together we'll ascend To worship on the height. “Abide, my servants, at the foot Of this rude mountain wild: Unload the beast; for I must put His burden on my child.” “Ay, father, I the wood will bear; And thou the knife, and fire To light the altar-pile; but where— Oh! where 's the lamb, my sire?” “Our God himself a lamb will find For sacrifice, my son. And, Lord, this bursting bosom bind, Till thy command be done!” “My father, thou art old; and long And steep, and hard to thee, The way; but I am young and strong— Support thyself by me.” “O righteous God! thy servant spare; Nor yet another dart Of filial tenderness prepare To quiver in my heart. “My lips in holy silence keep— Mine eyes from sorrow free; But let my soul bow down and weep Her tears of blood to thee!” Together now, are sire and son On that dread mountain's peak; And brought so near the Holy One, Frail nature must not speak. A solemn stillness wraps the scene; The fearful altar 's made; The tender boy lies bound, between The wood and glittering blade. The trusting child is calm and dumb; Prepared to yield his life, Because where'er the blow shall come, His father holds the knife! But, hark! a voice! 't is sweet and clear: An angel from above Is pouring in the patriarch's ear The sounds of peace and love. By him Jehovah from his throne Speaks through the opening skies: “Hold, Abraham! thine obedience shown Shall let thy son arise. “Unbind the cord—the lad release; And, in the thicket, see The offering, with his snowy fleece, That shall be slain for me. “Because thou didst not here withhold Thy child, thine only one, Thy faith shall to the world be told, And what thy God hath done. “The nations I will bless in thee— Thy children multiply— To count as sands around the sea— To shine, as stars, on high!” Then rise, ye future saints, and live With Abraham's holy trust; Believe, whate'er he bids you give, Your God still kind and just. The soul that heaven in mercy tries, As gold, from earth's alloy, Shall find the Mount of Sacrifice Become the Mount of Joy. THE CAVE OF MACHPELAH. “But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.” Gen. xxiii. 13. The sun over Hebron's green plain rising bright, His first rays of glory has sent, To blend with the tears, where the dark eye of night Has wept round the Patriarch's tent. For, sorrow and death with the night have been there: The spirit of Sarah has fled. Her form lies at rest, while the soft morning air, With Abraham, sighs o'er the dead. The tall, aged oak that is guarding the door, With arms spreading widely away, A fresh, living curtain hangs trembling before The peaceful and spiritless clay. And there, in his grief, does the patriarch stand: He looks to the left and the right, And forward, and back, for a place in the land To bury his dead out of sight. But here, far away from the land of his birth— From all of his kindred and name, No spot where his lost one can sleep in the earth, The lonely Chaldean may claim. A field lies before him, with trees green and high, A grove that imbosoms a cave; And this does he seek with his silver to buy, To hallow it thence, as a grave. The people of Canaan, who pass to and fro, From the gates of their city, draw near The tent of the pilgrim, their pity to show— His woes and his wishes to hear. Majestic in sorrow he stands, while the crowd From o'er the wide plain gather round: With reverence now, to their chief has he bowed Till his white, flowing beard met the ground. His accents are firm—in his eye is there shown The wisdom that beams through a tear; And thus is the grief of his bosom made known, While Ephron, the ruler, gives ear. “A stranger, I come from my home far away; The ground of the stranger I tread: While death finds a place in my dwelling to-day, I 've nowhere to bury my dead!” “Behold,” replies Ephron, in sympathy's voice, “We have many sepulchres made, Where slumber our dead; and we give thee thy choice Of all, wherein thine may be laid.” The patriarch answers:—“Can silver procure A spot, that to me and to mine, Shall be a possession made sacred and sure; I ask it of thee and of thine. “The cave that is there, in the end of the field— The cave of Machpelah—the earth, And trees round about it, I ask thee to yield To me; and to name me their worth.” “'T is four hundred shekels of silver. But what Is silver between thee and me?” The generous owner replies,—“Of the spot I give full possession to thee.” Once more speaks the sage of Chaldea: “The land I take; but the gift I decline. The price duly weighed putting now in thy hand, I make the place righteously mine.” And now on the fair land of promise is laid The first claim of permanent hold! A grave is the purchase! the first ever made Of earth, with its silver or gold! Blest cave of Machpelah, how holy the trust That long has been given to thee! Enshrined in thy bosom, how rich is the dust! How great its disclosure will be! For when the archangel, descending the skies, Shall give the loud summons to all, Then Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob will rise From thee, and come forth at the call! THE MOTHER'S JEWEL. Jewel most precious thy mother to deck, Clinging so fast by the chain on my neck; Locking thy little white fingers, to hold Closer, and closer, the circlets of gold— Stronger than these are the links that confine Near my fond bosom, this treasure of mine! Gift from thy Maker, so pure, and so dear, I cannot but hold thee with trembling and fear! Whence is this gladness, so holy and new, Felt as I clasp thee, or have thee in view? What is the noose that slips over my mind, Drawing it back, if I leave thee behind? Soft is the bondage—but strong is the knot: Oh! when the mother her babe has forgot, Ceasing from joy in so holy a trust, Dark should her eye be, and closed for the dust! Spirit immortal, with light from above, Over this new-opened fountain of love, Forth from my heart as it gushes so free, Sparkling, and playing, and leaping to thee,— Painting the rainbow of hopes, till they seem Brighter than reason—too true for a dream— What shall I call thee? my glory? my sun? These cannot name thee, thou beautiful one! Brilliant celestial, so priceless in worth, How shall I keep thee unspotted from earth? How shall I save thee from ruin by crime, Dimmed not by sorrow—untarnished by time? Where, from the thieves and the robbers that stray Over life's path, shall I hide thee away? Fair is the setting—but richer the gem. Oh! thou 'lt be coveted—sought for by them! I must devote thee to One who is pure, Touched by whose brightness, thine own will be sure, Borne in his bosom, no vapor can dim, Nothing can win thee, or pluck thee from him. Seamless and holy the garment he folds Over his jewels, that closely he holds. Hence unto Him be my little one given; Yea, “for of such is the kingdom of heaven!” COME HITHER, BRIGHT BIRD. Come hither, bright bird, from thy wild native bower, While high o'er the hill-tops the sun rises clear. Come, sing a sweet song to this new-opened flower, And drink off the dew-drop;—it looks like a tear! It cannot be true, that, so stainless and young, The heart of my flower has been clouded by grief; I would not, then, see on it outwardly hung The semblance of sorrow, to burden a leaf. Be quick! for it has but a morning to live So fresh in its odors, in beauty so fair. To pay for thy music, to thee it will give The first spicy breathing it throws upon air. Make haste, little vagrant! 't is waiting for thee, Its perfume to take on thy delicate plume. Come, say if a brighter or sweeter can be Concealed in thy desert home, lonely to bloom. It has not yet looked in the stream from the fount, To see how itself to another may shine: It has not begun its attractions to count,— A study too sure to begin their decline! For, well do I know in this light world of ours, Where loveliness withers, and beauty is vain, It chances too oft with the fairest of flowers, That, after the mirror, few charms will remain. Of praising her, then, pretty minstrel, beware, Whatever thy wonder her glory to hail. If told but for once, she is winning and rare, 'T will follow too soon that she's simple and frail. Yet, come, and thy rapture in melody pour, While flitting delighted around my young flower; But let her believe thou hast left many more, Her rivals, that bloom in thy far-away bower! SEA-SIDE MUSINGS. O, let me go down, all alone, And sit by the side of the sea! The sounds of its voice give my spirit a tone, That hushes her murmur, and quiets her moan, Till woes, that have pierced me, are dreams that have flown, Or drowned in the glory to be. Each billow, that mounts to my sight, And sinks for another to rise, Adoring its God, in its moment of light, And owning his power in its fulness of might, To him gives a smile by a gleam from its height, And calls on his name, as it dies. He holds the wild water! they curl And sing in his hand to my heart: The gems they roll o'er points my thoughts to the pearl, Which clasping, my spirit her pinions would furl, To rest where no blast of the tempest can hurl The soul and her treasure apart. My wishes, that vainly would roam And fasten on bubbles or air, Are chid by the wave—by the hiss of the foam, And drop of the spray!—they are bidding me home! Home, to my country beyond the blue dome! My Father's bright mansion is there. THE FOREST FLOWER. Who art thou, little forest gem, Set shining on thy slender stem, So lone, and yet so fair; Like some sweet censer, giving out, To cloud and sun, for rain and drought, Thine odors to be thrown about Upon the desert air? Thou look'st like one the tempest's breath Might in a moment shake to death; And hence thy ruins brush! Or, this proud tree against thy head Might hurl a nut, to strike thee dead; And helpless, to thine earthy bed, Its envied rival crush! And still, thou art as void of fear, As if thou wert an empress here; Yet modest as a saint; In heart, as single, undefiled And simple as a little child; With beauty new, and bright, and wild, That art could never paint. But, wherefore didst thou thus seclude Thy loveliness in solitude, To human vision lost; Had not my bold, erratic feet, To bear me to thy deep retreat, Through vines that stray, and boughs that meet, The turf untrodden crossed? Sweet eremite! I'll tell thee why: It was to please thine Author's eye! Thou thus art lone and fair To praise the Power who made thee so; For pure to him thy petals blow, And up to him thine odors go, Though borne on desert air! Fair unbaptized! I name thee, hence, A Spirit's clear address to sense, By this bright symbol made! Thou art a clothed, embodied thought, Which thy Creator's mind hath wrought, And from that fount of glory brought, In thy light form conveyed! THE MARINER'S ORPHAN. That cold, faithless moon looking down on the wave! How dark grows my heart with her beaming! And yonder she smiles on the new-covered grave, While tears drown my sight in their streaming. For there lies my father, down, down in the deep, O'erwhelmed by the black, heavy billow! And now have they borne off my mother, to sleep Where damp clods of earth are her pillow. How oft did she kneel, when that moon from above, Hung mild o'er a clam, sparkling ocean; And lift her sweet voice in thanksgiving and love, To Him of her evening devotion! And, when into clouds all their brightness was cast, With looks full of woe and imploring, She bowed like a reed, at the rush of the blast; And prayed while the tempest was roaring. Then, pale at the noise of the storm and the sea, While tears rolled, as crystal-drops shining, She threw her fond arms round my brother and me, Her trembling to stay by their twining. But, oh! when they told her the whole fatal tale, By silence her anguish was spoken. She heard the torn bark had gone down, in the gale; Then sunk! for her heart-strings had broken. And since, when I see the bright moon beaming clear, With stars gathered thickly around her, I think of that night, when no ray would appear, To light the frail bark that must founder! The sound of the waves, as they die on the shore, It fills me with sadness and sighing: To me they bring back a dear father no more— They show me a mother, when dying. THE PASTOR'S FUNERAL. The bell oft has called his flock to hear Their shepherd's voice, now mournfully is sounding. Sadly and slow the funeral train draws near, With weeds and gloom his lifeless form surrounding. They reach the sacred aisle that late he trod With pious fervor, from the holy pages To feed his listeners with the word of God— To point his people to the Rock of Ages. Under death's sable drapery, wan and cold, Robed for the waiting tomb, as they prepare him, Here, that his flock may once again behold His face on earth, with solemn step they bear him. No more his knee before the throne of grace Is now beheld in deep devotion bending; No inspiration kindles up his face; No grateful song is in his voice ascending. Praise and persuasion have forsook his tongue; Beneath its lid his eye is fixed and beamless: He lies there silent as a lyre unstrung, All hushed his music, and his slumber dreamless. No prayer, grown fervent with the fainting breath, Nor parting blessing those sealed lips are giving! But, with the full bold eloquence of death, His cold, pale features now address the living. They say to youth, whose tears flow fast for him, “Weep not for this! but be for sin thy sorrow!” To aged eyes, with grief and years grown dim, “Watch! for the summons may be sent to-morrow! “What we so oft have said, we come to prove:— Few are the days the lamp of life is burning. In this poor ashes must ye now remove Earth to earth's bosom—dust to dust returning. “Yet know, your Pastor and his flock shall meet Ere long, amid the all-showing light of heaven, Account to render at the judgment seat, For bread which you received—which he has given. “Remember this! and for the darksome night Which he has passed, hence be ye all preparing. May ye next meet him, robed in spotless white, Each o'er the grave the palm of victory bearing!” FLOWER UPON THE GREEN HILL-SIDE. Flower, upon the green hill-side, Thou, to shun the threatening blast, In the grass thy head dost hide, By the tempest overpast. Then to greet the azure skies, And to feel the soothing sun, Brighter, sweeter, thou dost rise! Tell me, flower, how this is done! “I will tell thee, as a friend, Artless, timid, whispering low; At the blast, 't is good to bend! He, who made me, taught me so. “While his teaching I obey, I but fall, to rise and stand, Brightened by the stormy day, Leaning on his viewless hand. “When to him I 've lowly bowed, He with freshness fills my cup From the angry, scowling cloud; Then he gently lifts me up. “So I sink—and so I rise; In the dark or sunny hour Minding him, who rules the skies:— He 's my God; and I'm his Flower!” THE INFANT ASTRONOMER. What, my child! awake so soon? And a tear about thine eye! “Mother, oh! I want the moon And stars; but they 're too high! They are all so high.” Lose thine evening cradle sleep, For the moon and starry beams? “Yes—they wake me; or they keep Around me in my dreams— Twinkling through my dreams! “What 's the path so snowy white, Shining there as bright as day?” That 's all paved with orbs of light:— 'T is called the Milky Way. “Called the Milky Way? “Is it by the angels trod? Can I tread it when I die? May I have for mine the God Of all the starry sky— All the shining sky? “Mother, now I'll go to rest, When I 've sung, and said my prayer. Here 's the song I love the best— ‘Thy God is everywhere!— God is everywhere.’ “In the blue and beaming sky; Through the land—upon the sea; While his kind and sleepless eye Is watching over me— Never turned from me.” Sleep! and O, thou God above, Keep this holy trust of mine Under thy soft wing of love; His Spirit light from thine! Seal my child, as thine! MARIANETTA. She came, a little stranger, From a soft and sunny clime, Where the bud is ne'er in danger, For 't is ever summer time. There orange-groves are showing Golden fruit and snowy flowers, On their boughs together growing By the never-fading bowers. The rivulet and fountain By the frost are never chained; And the earth of vale and mountain Is with silver brightly veined. The crystal rivers gliding Over pebbles that are gold, Are a blooming land dividing, And the year is never old. The tender blade is springing From the ever-verdant sod, And the feathered warbler singing Ceaseless praise to nature's God. A smiling infant daughter By her happy mother's side, She crossed the rolling water Of an ocean, deep and wide. She left the bloom and spices In her sunny place of birth, But to come where wint'ry ices Were to wrap her bed of earth! She heard her Maker calling For the spirit that he gave; And she left the snow-wreaths falling That have gathered round her grave. As the little bird, beholding How the leaf in autumn dies, With her ready wing unfolding, Flies away to warmer skies— On a seraph's rising pinion, Over earthly chill and blight, She hath sought the bright dominion Of eternal life and light. Though short her infant story From the cradle to the clod, It hath ended in the glory Of an angel praising God. And she sings, perhaps, more sweetly,— She adores with warmer love,— That she passed o'er earth so fleetly,— Was so soon at home above! THE INDIAN GIRL. Her young form looked bright, In the morn's early light; Her feet she was bathing in the silver dew. Their slight traces lay Along the leafy way, That led where the evergreen and sweet-briar grew. A fresh branch she took, And she went to the brook To weave it in the locks of her raven hair. With her eye on the stream, And her soul in a dream, She poured out her voice to the wandering air. The clear mirror shone; But the face was her own! There still was another that she sighed to see: For that had an eye The color of the sky; And a cheek like the bloom on her wild rose-tree. Its brow, too, was fair; And the locks that were there Were chestnut, and sunny, and turned in the curl: And that was the face That in all time and place, Was painted on the heart of the woodland girl. She wished she could hear But the bound of the deer, To tell the young hunter's foot was close behind; She wished she but knew, That his soft eye of blue Could see her glossy hair with the green wreath twined. A wild plaint she sung; But the rocks only flung Her voice back in echo, as she called his name; And sadly she sighed, And wooed the glassy tide, To bring back the skiff, that never, never came! Then slow passed the hours; And the gay blooming flowers All took a mournful hue; but she knew not why; Or what called the tear, That rolled so warm and clear, To mingle with the stream, from her full black eye. Her thoughts wildly strayed From the deep sylvan shade, Where now she felt prisoned like a pinioned bird. She dreamed, past the wood, That a beauteous world stood, Whose songs o'er the forest-top she sometimes heard. She longed then, and pined That far-off world to find; And if its bright beings held her lost one there, For whom, morn and eve, In vain she came to weave The green leaves, or feathers in her raven hair. Her eye lost its light; And her bloom touched with blight, Then showed a heart breaking by a secret power, Till, freed from its clay, Her spirit passed away; Her form slept in peace beneath the woodland flower. THE SAD RETURN. Behold, they return on the dark, wailing water, Their sighs heaving warm o'er the cold, swelling tide! The parents come weeping; but where is the daughter? The bridegroom comes mournful! O, where is the bride? A few moons ago, on the same rolling ocean, The three now so sad, were the bright envied four, With her, who received, after God, their devotion, And passed, a glad group, to a far foreign shore. And have they there left, in the land of the stranger, The joy of their circle—their heart's dearest gem? Ah no! not behind them, alone, nor in danger; Her soul is in heaven; her dust is with them! The casket is all to the many, who mourn her, That now they restore in earth's bosom to rest; A jewel unsullied, the angels have borne her To shine, as a star, in the world of the blest. Then, mourner, arise! through the clouds gathered o'er thee, Let faith raise thy heart from sorrow and gloom, To her, who hath passed into glory before thee, And left death and darkness behind to the tomb! A DREAM OF MUSIC. I dreamed a bright angel so near me was singing My spirit seemed resting, at last, at the goal; The deep-going strains through my bosom were bringing The pure oil of joy to pour over my soul. So sweet, so entrancing the spell that had bound me, The rudeness of earth melted off by its power: The air of an Eden seemed wafting around me The scent of its fruit, and the spice of its flower. The voice to my breast new emotions revealing, Had lulled every dissonant heart-string to peace. Its wounds were all touched with the unction of healing, And darkness was fading, in glory to cease. So holy the rapture, so blissful the dreaming, I felt that my eye never after could weep; Yet fain had I wept, when the morn with her beaming Too soon round my pillow had broken my sleep! My angel departed! with slumber in flying The music was lost—it will bless me no more. For earth seemed defied by the last note, in dying, To breathe it again, or its power to restore. My spirit must listen and sigh for it ever, As through the dark desert a pilgrim I roam; But, once heard below to invite me, it never Repeats the sweet call—'t was a song of my home! THE DYING ROSE. Not for thy beauty, dying rose, Dost thou upon my breast recline, Thy short and silent life to close So near the latent spring of mine. But for thy perfume sweet, my flower, I chose thee as my bosom friend; And sweetest in thy saddest hour, The offerings from thy heart ascend! I see thee take the hue of death; And ne'er again thy tender form Shall tremble at the tempest's breath, Or bend and weep amid the storm. For, like a broken phial, thou Thine odors on the air dost pour: They are thy passing spirit, now That earth shall claim and hold no more! Back to thy Maker, pure and free, Unseen thy rising essence goes: For this thou art more dear to me— More lovely still, poor dying rose! VISION OF THE INFANT ST. JOHN. My soul took wing, and hovered round The distant scenes—the hallowed ground, Where once the King of Heaven was found A form of earth to wear: The woes he bore, the love he taught, The death he slew, the life he brought, In one o'erwhelming flood of thought, Rolled on, and bowed me there. I walked the groves of Galilee; I stood in spirit by the sea, And mused of him, here called to be My Saviour's bosom-friend;— Of him, who gave among the few, Who followed Christ, the flower and dew Of life to him;—of things he knew, And wrought, and saw, and penned. These glorious wonders pondering o'er, I searched the past for something more, As round that now deserted shore, My solemn fancy roved. Her eye grew curious, there to trace The lineaments of peace and grace That marked the bud—the infant face Of him, “whom Jesus loved.” When, lo! a lovely vision smiled Before me, in a beauteous child, With aspect sweet—with eye so mild, So deep, so heavenly bright, The spirit seemed, with beams divine, To kindle up and fill the shrine, As through a dew-drop clear, will shine A ray of morning light. His tender foot, that on the strand, Shone like a lily of the land, Unsullied 'mid the sparkling sand, The falling wave had met. His garb was like a fisher's vest; And closely to his little breast, A scroll by one soft hand was pressed; The other dropped a net. The smile, upon his features thrown, Seemed of a bliss to earth unknown; As if a purer world had shown Its glories to his soul. He cast around an earnest eye, As if some coming friend were nigh, With words of meaning deep and high, To treasure in that scroll. Sweet odors from the mountain air Streamed through his locks of silken hair, And bathed his brow serene and fair, As looking from the sea, To paths that wound o'er vale and height, He saw a Lamb, all snowy white; And following him with quick delight, Was gone, and lost to me. Though rude my lines, my colors faint, And faithless here, my hand to paint The beauties of that infant saint, Which there my vision blessed,— I know it was the fisher's son, By whom such mighty works were done— That gentle, true, beloved one, “Who leaned on Jesus' breast!” THE DYING PHŒNIX. I've lived long enough! In my grandeur alone I 've ranged the free air and conversed with the spheres; My bright, starry eyes full of kindness have shone, But met not their kindred, through hundreds of years. I 've looked for my likeness by morn's early blush, To find it alone in the lake or the stream— At noon 't was but there; and by night's shady hush The false water vision stole back in a dream. How vain were the graces, that played in my crest, And round my proud neck with its collar of gold; The rich purple plumage that clothed my lone breast, How worthless, with none like myself to behold! Though perfect in beauty, O! who would be one Where earth all around a wide solitude lies? Unique in creation, I 've moved, like the sun, In splendor to set ere another can rise. And thus to the end of my course do I come. Alone have I built my rich funeral pyre: On wood of the myrrh-tree, sweet spices and gum, Triumphant I sit, as they 're turning to fire! My wings fanned the pile till they kindled the flame, That wraps in its brightness my form as I burn. From ashes and odors to being I came! To odors and ashes content I return! My heart melts with pity in death, for the heir To all the fair kingdom of nature I've known, With no one its wealth and its glory to share, The joy is in dying, that 's tasted alone! The smoke rises sweet, as my bosom consumes, And softly it weaves a dark shade o'er my eyes: It winds round my head—it is wreathed in my plumes— My life mounts the cloud rolling off to the skies! THE OLD ELM OF BOSTON. I come before thee, old majestic Tree, Not for inquiry into thy long story; But for my eye to drink delight from thee— To feast upon thy venerable glory. Encompassed by thy shadow, noble Elm, I find my soul her deepest founts unsealing: Emotions in a flood my heart o'erwhelm, Till with their weight almost to thee I'm kneeling. Here dost thou stand, lone monarch of the green, Demanding reverence from all who enter Within the bounds of this unrivalled scene, Whose countless beauties claim thee as their centre. At once on thee, and on the placid Pond, Thy fair companion, rests the eye, delighted That nature, by so close and firm a bond, So fine a pair upon this spot united. Children come hither, in the sunny glee Of their bright morn, thy stately form surrounding; With guileless hearts, from care and sorrow free; Like flocks of lambs across the verdure bounding. And never, never more are they to find A spot that memory shall so fondly cherish. Thy living image will remain behind, While after things may pass away or perish. Beauty's full eye, when art, the dazzling hall, And fashion's glare, have caused its light to dwindle, Sees thy green ornaments surpass them all; And resting here, its purest beams rekindle. Youth, when hope's airy visions fill his heart With things to be, in disappointment turning From those that are, from tumult steps apart To thee, to cool a restless spirit's burning. As thy wide branches pendant o'er him spread, Like aged arms some power divine possessing, He seems to feel thee pouring on his head The holy unction of a patriarch's blessing. Man with life's noontide fervor on his mind, Where cares in crowds are jostling for their places, May here commune with wisdom, so to find This world too fickle for a soul's embraces. Age, with his temples bound in silver frost, As thy new-opened leaves hang fresh before him, Thinks, though his verdure for this life is lost, Of bloom to which another may restore him. But, oh! the changes witnessed in thy day, Since man, as now thou seest him, first came hither: Thine own peculiar people passed away! Swept like thine autumn leaves, thou know'st not whither! Where are they? Question all in thy survey. Enough are near, a righteous answer owing To this demand repeated. Where are they, Whose fathers saw thee in the sapling growing? Look round! Inquire at yonder lofty dome, How from these grounds their first possessor vanished. Ask Justice, there in her terrestrial home, If 't was by her the red man hence was banished. Ask Piety, within her temple wall, Kneeling beneath that heavenward-pointing steeple, Before her Father, who is Lord of all, Whose was the soil where first he placed thy people. Ask Charity and Love, who, from the skies, Make yon broad house their earthly habitation, If He, whose angels they appear, denies “The poor because he 's poor,” home, rest and nation. Ask of Affection watching, where in dust Beloved and lost ones peacefully are sleeping, If she regards not, as a sacred trust, What she committed to those clods for keeping. Then ask her if she dwelt not with the race, Whose earlier lost ones to this earth were given, When, for another to usurp the place, They from their kindred ashes hence were driven. Ask the calm, meditative, upright Man— And let him not the crying answer smother, How we have used, since here our rule began, Our unenlightened, helpless, tawny brother! Nay!—to the future let the past account For heathen weakness driven from protection By Christian power! Oh! not to this amount, Did I come here to swell my sad reflection. The savage, saint, and all who ever trod These shores, in forest, court, or fane, arising,— Some, at the bar may plead, “an unknown God;” But others—what the Judge deems best sufficing. I would be grateful for my present bliss,— That I, with this fair prospect in surveying, At such an hour, to such a tree as this, May say the former things that I was saying. Of right infringed—of unremembered vows— One race before another disappearing— Let the pure breeze now passing through thy boughs, Sweep all I 've hinted far from mortal hearing! I have not spoken yet, sublime old Tree, Of thine acquaintance with the Whig and Tory; And with my fathers' battles to be free, That left thee mantled in Columbia's glory. Ere then, thou wast a hero, veteran Elm! The powers of air, that long had been assailing Thy well-made arms, and that high feathery helm, Had found thy heart and footing never-failing. So, amid war, with din, and flame, and blade, And cannon's roar, that shook the hills around thee, In philosophic grandeur, cool and staid, Like our own Chief, the fiercest foeman found thee. Stand in thy strength, with Heaven alone thy shield! Far, far I go; and then, another greeting With thee my destiny may never yield; But this in memory oft shall have repeating. Sometimes a passing bird will I beseech, As hitherward her joyous flight she 's winging, To save her sweetest song, till she can reach “My dear old Elm,” for thee to have the singing. When she comes back, perhaps thou 'lt kindly send Some little bud or leaf her beak has broken Fresh from thy bosom, for thine absent friend, That she may bring me a returning token.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME III. BLOWING BUBBLES. Half our sorrows, half our troubles, Making head and heart to ache, Are the fruit of blowing bubbles, Bright to view, but quick to break. All have played the child imbecile, Breathing hard to swell the sides Of a shining, fluid vessel, Frailer than the air it rides. From the infant's cradle rising, All the bubble mania show, Oft our richest wealth comprising In the bubbles that we blow. Brilliant, buoyant, upward going, Pleased, we mark them in their flight, Every hue of iris showing, As they glance along the light. Little castles, high and airy, With their crystal walls so thin, Each presents the wicked fairy, Vanity, enthroned within! But when two have struck together, What of either do we find? Not so much as one gay feather Flying Hope has left behind! Still the world are busy, blowing, Every one, some empty ball; So the seeds of mischief sowing, Where, to burst, the bubbles fall. Nor for self alone to gather, Is our evil harvest found; Oft, with pipe and cup, we rather Step upon our neighbor's ground. Thus, amusing one another, While the glistening playthings rise, We may doom a friend or brother To a life of care and sighs. Do you doubt my simple story? I can point a thousand ways Where this bubble-making glory Has in darkness hid its rays! Yet we'll spare a slight confusion Caused the world by giving names; Since a right to some delusion Every one from nature claims! INFANT FAITH. Radiant with his spirit's light Was the little beauteous child, Sporting round a fountain bright, Playing through the flowerets wild. Where they grow he lightly stepped, Cautious not a leaf to crush; Then about the fount he leaped, Shouting at its merry gush. While the sparkling waters welled, Laughing as they bubbled up, In his lily hands he held, Closely clasped, a silver cup. Now he put it forth to fill; Then he bore it to the flowers, Through his fingers there to spill What it held, in mimic showers. “Open, pretty buds,” said he, “Open to the air and sun; So, to-morrow I may see What my rain to-day has done. “Yes, you will, you will, I know, For the drink I give you now, Burst your little cups, and blow, When I'm gone, and can't tell how! “Oh! I wish I could but see How God's finger touches you, When your sides unclasp, and free, Let your leaves and odors through. “I would watch you all the night, Nor in darkness be afraid, Only once to see aright How a beauteous flower is made. “Now remember! I shall come In the morning from my bed, Here to find among you some With your brightest colors spread!” To his buds he hastened out, At the dewy morning hour, Crying, with a joyous shout, “God has made of each a flower!” Precious must the ready faith Of the little children be, In the sight of Him, who saith, “Suffer them to come to me.” Answered, by the smile of heaven, Is the infant's offering found, Though “a cup of water given,” Even to the thirsty ground. PATTY PROUD. The figure before you is Miss Patty Proud: Her feelings are lowery, her frown like a cloud; Because proud Miss Patty can hardly endure To come near the lowly abode of the poor. She fears the plain floor of the humble will spoil Her silk shoes and hose, and her skirt-bottom soil; And so she goes winching; and holds up her dress So high, it were well if her heels would show less. But when she walks through the fine streets of the town, She puts on fine airs, and displays her rich gown; Till some, whom she passes, will think of the bird Renowned for gay feathers, whose name you have heard. In thought she is trifling—in manner as vain As that silly fowl, taking pride in his train; And none, who have marked her, will need to be told That she has a heart hard, and haughty, and cold. I saw, when she met some poor children one day, Who asked her for alms, she turned frowning away; And told them, “Poor people must work, to be fed, And not trouble ladies, to help them to bread.” And just as the sad little mendicants said, Their mother was dying, their father was dead, She entered a store, with a smooth, smiling face, To lay out her purse in gay ribbons and lace. I saw her curl up her sour lip in disdain, Because Ellen Pitiful picked up the cane, A feeble old man had let fall in the sand, And placed it again in his tremulous hand. But little does haughty Miss Patty suppose, Of all, whom she visits, that any one knows How stern she can look, when she 's out of their sight, And fret at the servants, if all is not right. At home, she 's unyielding, and sullen, and cross: Her friends, when she 's absent, esteem it no loss; And some, where she visits, in secret confess, That they love her no more, though they dread her much less. The truth is, Miss Patty, when young, never tried To govern her temper, or conquer her pride. The passions, unchecked in the heart of the child, Like weeds in a garden neglected, ran wild. They grew with her growth, with her strength became strong: Her head, not then righted, has ever been wrong; And so she would never submit to be told Of faults, by long habit made stubborn and bold. And now, among all my young friends, is there one,— A fair little girl is there under the sun, Who 'd rise to a woman, and have it allowed That she is a likeness of Miss Patty Proud? I CAUGHT A BIRD. I caught a bird: She flitted by, So near my window lifted high, She softly ventured in, to spy What I might be about: And then, a little wildered thing, Like many a one without a wing, She fluttered, struck, and seemed to sing, “Alas! I can't get out.” She saw her kindred on the tree Before her, sporting light and free; But felt a power, she could not see, Repel and hold her back. In vain her beak, and breast, and feet Against the crystal pane were beat: She could not break the clear deceit, Nor find her airy track. The pretty wanderer then I took; And felt her frame with terror shook: She gave the sad and piteous look Of helplessness and fear; Till quick I spread my hand, to show, I caught her but to let her go; And I, perhaps, may never know A dearer moment here. She piped a short and sweet adieu, As, humming on the air, she threw Her brilliant, buoyant wing, and flew Away from fear and me: But, ere the hour of setting sun, That little constant, grateful one, Returning, had her hymn begun In our old rustling tree. Now do not take the fatal aim, My tender bird to kill, or maim; Nor let the fatal shot proclaim Her anguish, or her fall! But, would you know the bird I mean, She is the first that will be seen— The last—and every one between: She represents them all! THE FLOWER OF SHELLS AND SILVER WIRE. TO ?. I sought a meet gift, it might please thee to wear Among the soft locks of thy fine silken hair; And asked the two deeps for some treasure or gem, By nature first formed and imbosomed in them. The mine gave me threads of its fine silver ore; The ocean cast up its smooth shells to the shore: Of these I combined the free offering, that now I bring, and would set o'er thy fair, peaceful brow. The shells, thou wilt see, are unsullied and white; The silver is modest, and precious, and bright,— A type! thy quick fancy will readily see, Yet thou 'lt not confess what its meaning may be. And let the gift sometimes recall to thy mind The friend, by whose hand its pure parts were combined; But, oftener, that Friend, in whose hand was the skill The earth and the seas with their treasures to fill! THE LITTLE BLIND BOY. O tell me the form of the soft summer air, That tosses so gently the curls of my hair! It breathes on my lip, and it fans my warm cheek, But gives me no answer, though often I speak: I feel it play o'er me, refreshing and light, And yet cannot touch it, because I 've no sight! And music—what is it? and where does it dwell? I sink, and I mount, with its cadence and swell, While thrilled to my heart, with its deep-going strain, Till pleasure excessive seems turning to pain. Now, what the bright colors of music may be, Will any one tell me? for I cannot see. The odors of flowers, that are hovering nigh— What are they?—on what kind of wings do they fly? Are not they sweet angels, who come to delight A poor little boy, that knows nothing of sight? The sun, moon and stars never enter my mind. O tell me what light is, because I am blind! THE SALE OF THE WATER-LILY. There stood upon the broad high-road, That o'er a moorland lay, A widow's low and lone abode, And close beside the way. Upon its face the dwelling bore The signs of times within, That seemed to say but little more Than, “Better days have been!” Behind it was the sedgy fen, With alder, brake, and brush; And less to serve the wants of men, Than of the jay and thrush. And these would sometimes come, and cheer The widow with a song, To let her feel a neighbor near, And wing an hour along. A pond, supplied by hidden springs, With lilies bordered round, Was found among the richest things, That blessed the widow's ground. She had, besides, a gentle brook, That wound the meadow through, Which from the pond its being took, And had its treasures too. Her eldest orphan was a son; For, children she had three; She called him, though a little one, Her hope for days to be. And well he might be reckoned so, If, from the tender shoot, We know the way the branch will grow; Or, by the flower, the fruit. His tongue was true, his mind was bright; His temper smooth and mild: He was—the parent's chief delight— A good and pleasant child. He 'd gather chips and sticks of wood, The winter fire to make; And help his mother dress their food, Or tend the baking cake. In summer time he 'd kindly lead His little sisters out, To pick wild berries on the mead, And fish the brook for trout. He stirred his thoughts for ways to earn Some little gain; and hence, Contrived the silver pond to turn, In part, to silver pence. He found the lilies blooming there So spicy sweet to smell, And to the eye so pure and fair, He plucked them up to sell. He could not to the market go: He had too young a head, The distant city's ways to know; The route he could not tread. But, when the coming coach-wheels rolled, To pass his humble cot, His bunch of lilies to be sold Was ready on the spot. He 'd stand beside the way, and hold His treasures up to show, That looked like yellow stars of gold Just set in leaves of snow. “O buy my lilies!” he would say; “You'll find them new and sweet: So fresh from out the pond are they, I have n't dried my feet!” And then he showed the dust that clung Upon his garment's hem, Where late the water-drops had hung, When he had gathered them. And while the carriage checked its pace, To take the lilies in, His artless orphan tongue and face Some bright return would win. For many a noble stranger's hand, With open purse, was seen, To cast a coin upon the sand, Or on the sloping green. And many a smiling lady threw The child a silver piece; And thus, as fast as lilies grew, He saw his wealth increase. While little more—and little more, Was gathered by their sale, His widowed mother's frugal store Would never wholly fail. For He, who made, and feeds the bird, Her little children fed. He knew her trust: her cry he heard; And answered it with bread. And thus, protected by the Power, Who made the lily fair, Her orphans, like the meadow flower, Grew up in beauty there. Her son, the good and prudent boy, Who wisely thus began, Was long the aged widow's joy; And lived an honored man. He had a ship, for which he chose “The Lily” as a name, To keep in memory whence he rose, And how his fortune came. He had a lily carved and set, Her emblem, on her stem; And she was called, by all she met, A beauteous ocean gem. She bore sweet spices, treasures bright; And, on the waters wide, Her sails, as lily-leaves, were white: Her name was well applied. Her feeling owner never spurned The faces of the poor; And found that all he gave returned In blessing rich and sure. The God, who, by the lily-pond, Had drawn his heart above, In after life preserved the bond Of grateful, holy love. THE SILVER BIRDSNEST. We were shown a beautiful specimen of the ingenuity of birds, a few days since, by Dr. Cook, of this borough. It was a birdsnest made entirely of silver wires, beautifully woven together. The nest was found on a sycamore tree, on the Condorus, by Dr. Francis Beard, of York county. It was the nest of a hanging-bird; and the material was probably obtained from a soldier's epaulet, which it had found. Westchester Village Record. Spring of 1838. A stranded soldier's epaulet, The waters cast ashore, A little winged rover met, And eyed it o'er and o'er. The silver bright so pleased her sight, On that lone, idle vest, She knew not why she should deny Herself a silver nest. The shining wire she pecked and twirled; Then bore it to her bough, Where, on a flowery twig 't was curled— The bird can show you how:— But, when enough of that bright stuff The cunning builder bore Her house to make, she would not take, Nor did she covet more. And when the little artisan, While neither pride nor guilt Had entered in her pretty plan, Her resting-place had built; With here and there a plume to spare, About her own light form, Of these, inlaid with skill, she made A lining soft and warm. But, do you think the tender brood She fondled there, and fed, Were prouder, when they understood The sheen about their bed? Do you suppose they ever rose Of higher powers possessed, Because they knew they peeped and grew Within a silver nest? THE QUAKER FLOWER. A TRIFOLIUM FROM THE GRAVE OF PENN. I have a little Quaker flower, That hath a kind of spirit power To hold me captive, hour by hour, In pleasant musing lost; 'T was plucked for me in distant land, And by another's friendly hand, From turf where I may never stand; Then yon wild ocean crossed. A modest foreigner it came, Bearing a sweet, but humble name; Yet worthy of a glorious fame Among the sons of men; For O the pretty stranger grew: It drank the ether and the dew, And from light received its hue Upon the grave of Penn! It sprang from out that hallowed ground, Unclosed its eye, and smiled around, Upon the verdure of the mound, Where William's ashes rest; Where low the dust in quiet lies Of him, among the good and wise On earth, so meek, and in the skies So high among the blest. And had my flower a living root, Or seed wherefrom a germ might shoot For one young plant to be the fruit Of that small vital part, Fair Penn-Sylvania, it should be, My friendly offering made to thee— Set, to thy father's memory, On thy kind Quaker heart. But, ah! my precious flower is dead: The snow-white sheet beneath its head, And on its tender bosom spread, Shows that its life is o'er: And though each floweret of the gem, And every leaf, is on the stem, I cannot spare thee one of them, Because there'll grow no more. I therefore bid my fancy weave This simple wreath, which thou 'lt receive In lieu thereof; and thence believe My fervent wish to be, That Heaven, to overflowing still, With purest bliss thy cup may fill, And guard thee safe from every ill, Whilst thou rememberest me! THE HUMMING-BIRD'S ANGER. “Small as the humming-bird is, it has great courage and violent passions. If it find a flower that has been deprived of its honey, it will pluck it off, throw it on the ground, and sometimes tear it to pieces.” Buffon. On light little wings, as the humming-birds fly, With plumes many-hued as the bow of the sky, Suspended in ether, they shine in the light, As jewels of nature, high-finished and bright. Their delicate forms are so buoyant and small, They hang o'er the flowers, as too airy to fall, Upborne on their beautiful pinions, that seem Like glittering vapor, or parts of a dream. The humming-bird feeds upon honey, and so, Of course, 't is a sweet little creature, you know: But sweet little creatures have sometimes, they say, A great deal that 's bitter or sour to betray. And often the humming-bird's delicate breast Is found of a very high temper possessed: Such essence of anger within it is pent, 'T would burst, did no safety-valve give it a vent. Displeased, it will seem a bright vial of wrath, Uncorked by its heat the offender to scath; And taking occasion to let off its ire, 'T is startling to witness how high it will fire. A humming-bird once o'er a trumpet-flower hung, And darted that sharp little member, the tongue, At once through the tube to its cell for the sweet It felt, at the bottom, most certain to meet. But, finding that some other child of the air, To rifle the store, had already been there, And no drop of honey for her to draw up, Her vengeance was poured on the destitute cup. She flew in a passion that heightened her power, And, cuffing and shaking the innocent flower, Its tender corolla in shred after shred She hastily stripped, then she snapped off its head. A delicate ruin on earth as it lay, That bright little fury went humming away, With gossamer softness, and fair to the eye, Like some living brilliant just dropped from the sky. And since, when that curious bird I behold Arrayed in rich colors, and dusted with gold, I cannot but think of the wrath and the spite, She has in reserve, though they 're kept out of sight. These two-footed, beautiful, passionate things, If plumeless or plumy, without or with wings, Should go to the glass, or the painter, and sit When anger is just at the height of its fit. THE SABBATH. Day of days, the dearest, best, Hallowed by Jehovah's rest! When his six-days' work was done, Holy rose the seventh sun. When creation's pillars stood, And the Lord pronounced them good, Morning stars together sang— Heaven with Sabbath praises rang. Earth in pristine beauty shone, Like a gem, before his throne, While he marked thee, as his claim— And he sealed thee with his name. Choice of God, thou blessed day! At thy dawn the grave gave way To the power of him within, Who had, sinless, bled for sin. Thine the radiance to illume First, for man, the dismal tomb, When its bars their weakness owned, There revealing death dethroned. Then the Sun of righteousness Rose, a darkened world to bless, Bringing up from mortal night, Immortality and light. Day of glory! day of power! Sacred be thine ev'ry hour! Emblem, earnest of the rest That remaineth for the blest! When at last it shall appear How they loved and kept thee here, To a temple in the skies, Fair, eternal, they shall rise. Not a sigh of grief or care Shall mingle with their praises there; Then their sweet reward shall be An eternity of thee. THE DEPARTING SPIRIT. Hush! let the sigh in escaping be stopped: Be the dim chamber all silently trod! Let not the tear, that is rounded, be dropt! Oh! 't is a spirit returning to God! Angels are softly untwining the strings, Loosing its ties to the beautiful clay; Lo! they have lifted their hovering wings: Joyous they waft her in triumph away! Sorrow not now, o'er the spiritless form, While on its features death's lilies unfold: Break not the heart for another so warm, Stopt in its pulse by a finger so cold. Time ne'er shall whiten a lock of that hair, Silken and full, round the forehead, that shines. Age shall not come, nor the finger of care, Marking that brow with their deep-going lines. Ne'er will those lips be unsealed by the sigh: Anguish will never that bosom invade: Tears roll no more from that calm sleeping eye: Peace o'er the clay her smooth mantle has laid. Plant a young flower, in beauty to spread, Tender and pure, where the dust shall repose. Look then from earth, whence the bright spirit fled, Up, where to gladness and glory it rose. SONNET. Spare, ruthless fowler, spare That harmless robin's breast! Its downy vesture do not tear; But leave the life-blood circling there, Again to warm her nest; For she is hastening home with food Provided for her callow brood. Her tender offspring see, Were now thy shot to fly, Left, as thy helpless babes would be, 'Reft of their mother and of thee, To moan, and pine, and die. Then let her pass unhurt along; And she will thank thee with a song. FATHER, HEAR! Thou, whose power assumes the form, Now, of this wild wintry storm, Let it still in mercy be Shown upon the raging sea! O! for him, who tosses there, Father, hear this midnight prayer! Solemn darkness shrouds the world; While, with mighty wings unfurled, Thus the winds in fury sweep O'er the land, and o'er the deep, Thou, whose thought from death can save, Guard the life that 's on the wave! Cold and dreary is the night; Snow-clouds wrap the beacon-light; Rocks and ices, like a host Armed for battle, bar the coast; For the coming bark appear! Guide her! save her! Father, hear! THE PILGRIM'S WAY SONG. I'm bound to the house of my Father; O draw not my feet from the way; Nor stop me these wild flowers to gather! They droop at my touch, and decay. I think of the flowers, that are blooming In beauty unfading above, The wings of the angels perfuming, Who fly down on errands of love. Of earth's shallow waters the drinking Is powerless my thirst to allay; Their taste is of tears, while we're sinking Beside them, where quicksands betray. I long, from that fount ever-living, That flows by my Father's own door, With waters so sweet and life-giving, To drink, and to thrist never more. The gold of his bright, happy dwelling Makes all lower gold to look dim; Its treasures, all treasures excelling, Shine forth to allure me to Him. The pearls of this world while I'm treading In dust, where as pebbles they lie, I seek the rich pearl, that is shedding Its lustre so pure from on high. For pains my torn spirit is feeling, No balsam from earth it receives: I go to the tree, that hath healing To drop on my wounds from its leaves. A child that is weary with roaming, Returning in gladness to see A home and a parent, I'm coming— My Father, I hasten to thee! THE RISING MONUMENT. Rise in thy solemn grandeur, calm and slow, As well befits thy purpose and thy place: Great Speaker! rise, not suddenly, to show The earth forever sacred at thy base. Strong as the rocky frame-work of the globe, Proportioned fair, in altitude sublime, With freedom's glory round thee as a robe, Rise gently—then defy the power of time. To future ages, from thy lofty site, Speak in thy mighty eloquence, and tell That where thou art, on Bunker's hallowed height, Our Warren and his valiant brethren fell. Say, it was here the vital current flowed, Purpling the turf, amid the mortal strife For man's great birthright, from the breasts, that glowed With love of country, more than love of life. Thou hast thy growth of blood, that, gushing warm From patriot bosoms, set their spirits free: All, who behold, shall venerate thy form, And bow before thy genius, Liberty. Here fell the hero and his brave compeers, Who fought and died to break a people's chain: The place is sacred to Columbia's tears, Poured o'er the victims for a nation slain. Yet from her starry brow a glory streams, Turning to gems those holy drops of grief, As after evening showers, the morn's clear beams Show diamonds hung on grass, and flower and leaf. Upright and firm, as were the patriot souls, That from thy native spot arose to God, Stand thou and hold, long as our planet rolls, This last high place by Freedom's martyrs trod. Let thy majestic shadow walk the ground, Calm as the sun, and constant as his light; And by the moon, amid the dews, be found The sentinel, who guards it through the night. And may the air around thee ever be To heaven-born Liberty as vital breath; But, like the breeze that sweeps the Upas tree, To Bondage and Oppression certain death! A beauteous prospect spreads for thy survey; City and dome, and spire look up to thee: The solemn forest and the mountains gray Stand distant to salute thy majesty. And ocean, in his numbers deep and strong, While the bright shore beneath thy ken he laves, Will sing to thee an everlasting song Of freedom, with his never-conquered waves. Rise then, and stand unshaken, till the skies Above thee are about to pass away; But, when the dead around thee are to rise, Melt in the burning splendors of the day! For then will He, “whose right it is to reign,” Who hath on earth a kingdom pure to save, Come with his angels, calling up the slain To freedom, and annihilate the grave. A NAME IN THE SAND. Alone I walked the ocean strand; A pearly shell was in my hand: I stooped, and wrote upon the sand My name—the year—the day. As onward from the spot I passed, One lingering look behind I cast: A wave came rolling high and fast, And washed my lines away. And so, methought, 't will shortly be With every mark on earth from me; A wave of dark oblivion's sea Will sweep across the place, Where I have trod the sandy shore Of time, and been to be no more, Of me—my day—the name I bore, To leave nor track, nor trace. And yet, with Him, who counts the sands, And holds the waters in his hands, I know a lasting record stands, Inscribed against my name, Of all, this mortal part has wrought; Of all, this thinking soul has thought; And from these fleeting moments caught For glory, or for shame. THE CHILD OF A YEAR AND A DAY To grief the night-hours keeping, A mournful mother lay Upon her pillow, weeping— Her babe had passed away. When she had clasped her treasure A year and yet a day, Of time 't was all its measure— 'T was gone, like morning's ray! The jewel, Heaven had shown her, Of worth surpassing gold, Was lent her, by its Owner— 'T was never earth's to hold. Then, fondly hovering o'er her, A bright young angel hung; And warm the love it bore her, And sweet the song it sung: “O mother, why this weeping? Let all thy sorrow cease: My infant form is sleeping, Where nought can break its peace. “And he, who once was blessing Such little children here, My spirit now possessing, Will hold me ever dear. “I never knew the dreading Of death's all-conquering blow; My mortal raiment shedding, I rose above the foe. “Where sickness cannot pain me— Where comes nor grief nor night— Where sin shall never stain me, I dwell, a child of light. “While many a pilgrim hoary Treads long earth's weary way, I have eternal glory For one short year and day.” Yet that sweet angel singing Its mother could not hear, For grief her heart was wringing— She 'd but a mortal ear. She could not see the beaming Of his celestial crown; For fast her tears were streaming; Her soul to dust bowed down. A voice from heaven then falling In soothing tones to her, As of a Father, calling, Revealed the Comforter. And, lifting up her lowly And sorrow-laden eye, She saw the King all holy Upon the throne Most High. Where shining hosts were pouring Their praises forth to Him, She saw her child adoring, Amid the Seraphim. THE BELIEVER'S MOUNTAINS. Not to the mount, where fire and smoke Jehovah's face concealed, When loud to wandering man he spoke, To make his law revealed— Not to the awful splendor there Can turn my fearful eye: To hear its thunderings, and to dare Its lightnings, were to die. Not on the mount where Moses stood, The promised land to see Across the waves of Jordan's flood, Is yet the place for me. My spirit could not bear to take That fair and glorious view, Nor dare her wondrous launch to make, To try the waters through. Not to the mount where Christ appeared At once so heavenly bright; While they, who heard the Father, feared, And fell before the light— Not there, my Saviour ever nigh, Do I his footsteps trace: His closer followers far, than I, Attain that higher place. But, to the mount without a name, Where Jesus sat and taught, I daily would assert my claim, To share the bread he brought. His words before that multitude Dropt to his chosen few, Are manna for my morning food, My soul's sweet evening dew. If to Temptation's mount I go, That mount exceeding high, My Lord, again rebuke our foe, And bid the tempter fly. No kingdom may I seek, but thine; And let my glory be A light, reflected pure from thine— My portion, life with thee! Oft to the mount of midnight shade, Of solitude and prayer, Ascend, my soul, be not afraid Thy Guide to follow there. The height and stillness of the scene, When thou that path hast trod, Forbids this world to rush between A spirit and her God. The mount whereon my Saviour stood, And o'er the city wept— Where fell his wo-wrung drops of blood, While his disciples slept— There may I go, yet not to sleep Till Jesus be betrayed; But, as he went, to pray and weep O'er sufferings sin hath made. And to the solemn, shuddering mount, Where Christ received the cup Of death, to offer us a fount Of life, must I go up. And I must look upon his wo, On that empurpled tree, To learn how vast a debt I owe, By what he paid for me. Thence to the mount of Galilee May I the way pursue, With joy my risen Lord to see, Ere he ascends from view. For lo! the heavens their gates unfold To take their coming King: His angels harp on strings of gold, And “Hallelujah!” sing. Now on Mount Zion may I seek My shield—my strong, high tower; And thence, though here so dark and weak, Be clothed with light and power. Then at that holy mountain's top, My soul, no more to roam, Unfurl thy wings—thine ashes drop; And gain thy glorious home. THE NIGHT AND THE MORNING. A solemn night is o'er Jerusalem; Nature astonished, shrouds herself in gloom; For he, who was the babe of Bethlehem, Is now a victim slain, and in the tomb! The blood, which started with the agony That in the garden forced his swelling veins, In crimson streams has poured on Calvary; A rocky cavern holds his pale remains. He walked with men, serene in holiness, The meek, the merciful, through taunts and strife; The front of pride he met with lowliness, And bowed to death to lift his foes to life. Fast as their sins grew bold and multiplied, His bitter cup was filling to the brim. Here doth he lie, the pale, the crucified, With damps and shadows gathered over him. The dismal night moves on but heavily, While they, who came the sepulchre to keep With bristling spears, the Roman soldiery, Would fain resign their glittering arms for sleep. Yet they must wake or die; the sentinel Must keep his constant vigils round the spot Where he shall find the watch of Israel: The life, the spirit moves, and heeds him not. Within the grave, that power victorious O'er death and darkness, far from mortal sight, Hath wrought the body bright and glorious For resurrection by the morning light. And lo! the shades of night are vanishing; The guard behold, as comes the dawning day, Her dubious gloom and dimness banishing, The stone that barred the tomb is rolled away. But, where 's the form that in the drapery, Which wraps the dead, lay, spiritless and cold, Within the vault so still and shadowy, That, as a prison-guard, they came to hold? That form is gone; its cast-off covering, The sad habiliments of death, are here, With burial odors round them hovering, And white-robed angels calmly sitting near. But, see the garden, fair and flowering, Where new-born lilies worship from their stalks; And boughs with blossoms bend, embowering The dewy pathway! there the Saviour walks. The guilty city still is slumbering, While he is risen from the broken tomb; As one his vines and fruit trees numbering, He breathes the incense of their opening bloom. The moon, now fading in the occident, Is not so mild, so heavenly fair as he. The sun, just rising in the orient, Hath less of glory than in him we see. Nature, that, for his death and burial, Hath put on darkness, as a mourning weed, Arrayed in light as for a festival, Proclaims afar, “The Lord is risen indeed!” I SHALL BE SATISFIED. “I shall be satisfied when I awake in thy likeness.” May I in thy likeness, my Saviour, awake, And rise, a fair image of thee; Then I shall be satisfied, when I can break This prison of clay, and be free. Can I but come forth to eternity's light, With thy perfect features to shine, In raiment unsullied from time's dreary night, What honor and joy will be mine! Yes, I shall be satisfied then to have cast The shadows of nature all by— When, darkness and dust from the dull eyelid past, My soul sees with full-opened eye. How fain would I know the great morn drawing near, When earth's dreamy visions shall fade, If I in thy semblance indeed may appear, And stand in thy beauty arrayed! To see thee in glory, O Lord, as thou art, From this mortal, perishing clay My spirit immortal, in peace would depart, And, joyous, mount up her bright way. When on thine own image in me thou hast smiled, In thy holy mansion, and when Thy fatherly arms have encircled thy child, O I shall be satisfied then! THE PENITENTIAL TEAR. Thou trembling, pure, and holy thing! What skill from ocean's depths can bring, Or toil from out the mine— What monarch in his diadem, Or glittering garb, produce a gem, Whose brightness equals thine? Thy source is deeper than the caves Of riven rock, or opening waves, Invisible as air: And, though the angel throng above Behold thee with delight and love, They ne'er can have thee there. Nor change, nor age thy sheen can dim; Thou 'rt now unstained as when with him, Who dared, in olden time, Thrice his dear, suffering Lord deny; Then, melted at the Saviour's eye, And paid thee for his crime. Called from the treasures of the soul By power divine, when thou dost roll Forth from the mourner's eye, Thy wearer thou dost then proclaim The heir of life, who has his name Writ in the Book on high. Thou art a pearl, that all may own, And when thy matchless worth is known To those, who wear thee here, They will be changed, and shall behold The shining gates of heaven unfold, Bright Penitential Tear! TEACHINGS OF GOD. He reigns on high, a glorious King, In ocean, earth, and air; He moves and governs every thing, For God is every where. The waters at his bidding flow. The mountain and its flower Their majesty and beauty show, As traces of his power. The lilies by the meadow rills Are leaning on his hand; And so the cedar of the hills, The palm and olive stand. He formed the birds, that sport along On light and brilliant wing; And tuned them with the voice of song And joy his praise to sing. This earth is ours, so rich and fair From him, who made it thus— Who sends his angels down with care To minister to us. The rainbow, with its beauteous dies, A pledge to man, is lent By him, who spreads the shining skies Around him, “as a tent.” The heavens, my child, are full of him! Yon radiant sun above Is but an image, cold and dim, Of his great power and love. He placed that glorious orb on high, In splendor there to roll, To warm the world, to light the eye; He lights and warms the soul. And lest the night with sable shade That azure vault should mar, He moved his finger there, and made, At every touch, a star. With these the moon, his beaming gift, Here lets her lustre fall, Our thoughts to win, our hearts to lift To him, who gave them all. And he is ours—that Holy One, Our Father, Guide, and Friend; In ways untravelled by the sun, In love that ne'er shall end. 'T is sweet to worship him below, With his approving eye To mark the way, our spirits go To seek his face on high. THE HERALD'S CRY IN THE DESERT. “He was not that Light; but was sent to bear witness of that Light.” St. John i. 8. Awake, O ye nations, and, shaking The slumber of death from your eyes, Behold the fair morn in its breaking, The Sun of all glory arise. He comes, mist and dimness dispelling; The shadows and clouds flee away: Ho! all, that in darkness are dwelling, Spring up, and rejoice in the day! Ye dying, life's waters revealing, He'll show you to fountain and streams: Ye wounded, for you he brings healing; Come out and repose in his beams. Come, all ye disconsolate, hailing Your King in his beauty and might; His raiment mount Ebal is veiling; Mount Gerizim shines with his light. O praise him, ye weary, in wonder To feel your hard burdens unbound! Ye captives, your bars fall asunder; With shoutings leap forth at the sound. Your names on his breastplate he's wearing; They 're set as the seal of his ring; Ye nations, your highways preparing, Receive, and be glad in your King! OUR FATHER'S WELL. Come, let's go back, my brother, And, by our father's well, Sit down beside each other, Life's little dreams to tell. For there we played together, In childhood's sunny hours; Before life's stormy weather Had killed its morning flowers. And since no draught we 've tasted, Its weary journey through, As we so far have hasted, Like that our father drew; I feel, as at a mountain, I cannot pass nor climb, Till from that distant fountain I drink, as in my prime. My spirit's longing, thirsting, No waters else can quell; My heart seems near to bursting To reach that good old well. Though all be changed around it, And though so changed are we, Just where our father found it, That pure well spring will be. In earth, when deeply going, He reached and smote the rock; He set its fount to flowing— It opened at his knock. The way, he smoothed and stoned it, A close, round, shadowy cell; Whoever since has owned it, It is our father's well! His prattling son and daughter, With each an infant's cup, We waited for the water, His steady hand drew up. When we had paused and listened, Till down the bucket dashed, O how it, rising, glistened, And to the sunlight flashed! And since that moment, never Has that cool deep been dry; Its fount is living ever, While man and seasons die. Around its mouth is growing The moss of many a year; But from its heart is flowing The water sweet and clear. Fond memory near it lingers, And, like a happy child, She plucks, with busy fingers, And wreathes the roses wild. Yet many a lip, whose burning Its limpid drops allayed, Has since, to ashes turning, Been veiled in silent shade. Still we are here, and telling About our infant play; Where that free spring is welling, So true, and far away. But O! the change, my brother! Our father's head is hoar; The tender name of mother Is ours to call no more. And now, around thee gather Such little ones as we Were then, beside our father, And look to theirs in thee. While fast our years are wasting, Their numbers none can tell; So let us hence be hasting To find our Father's well. Come, we will speed us thither, And from its mossy brink, To flowers that ne'er shall wither Look up to heaven and drink. They spring beside the waters, Our Father there will give To all his sons and daughters, Where they shall drink and live. THE MOTHER'S DREAM. “And I will give him the morning star.” Rev. ii. 28. Methought, once more to my wishful eye My beautiful boy had come: My sorrow was gone, my cheek was dry, And gladness around my home. I saw the form of my dear, lost child! All kindled with life he came; And he spake in his own sweet voice, and smiled, As soon as I called his name. The garb he wore looked heavenly white, As the feathery snow comes down, And warm, as it shone in the softened light That fell from his dazzling crown. His eye was bright with a joy serene, His cheek with a deathless bloom, That only the eye of my soul hath seen, When looking beyond the tomb. The odors of flowers, from the thornless land Where we deem that our blest ones are, Seemed borne in his skirts; and his soft right hand Was holding a radiant star. His feet, unshod, looked tender and fair, As the lily's opening bell, Half veiled in a cloud of glory, as there Around him, in folds, it fell. I asked him how he was clothed anew— Who circled his head with light— And whence he returned to meet my view So calm and heavenly bright. I asked him where he had been so long Away from his mother's care— Again to sing me his infant song, And to kneel by my side in prayer. He said, “Sweet mother, the song I sing Is not for an earthly ear: I touch the harp with a golden string, For the hosts of heaven to hear. “It was but a gently fleeting breath, That severed thy child from thee! The fearful shadow, in time, called Death, Hath ministered life to me. “My voice in an angel choir I lift; And high are the notes we raise: I hold the sign of a priceless gift, And the Giver, who hath our praise. “‘The bright and the morning star’ is he, Who bringeth eternal day! And, mother, he giveth himself to thee, To lighten thine earthly way. “The race is short to a peaceful goal, And He is never afar, Who saith of the wise, untiring soul, ‘I will give him the morning star!’ “Thy measure of care for me was filled, And pure to its crystal top; For Faith, with a steady eye, distilled And numbered every drop. “While thou wast teaching my lips to move, And my heart to rise in prayer, I learned the way to a world above; The home of thy child is there! “The secret prayers, thou didst make for me, That only thy God hath known, Arose, like sweet incense, holy and free, And gathered around his throne. “My robe was filled with the perfume sweet To shed upon this world's air, As I joyful knelt, at my Saviour's feet, For the glorious crown I wear. “In that bright, blissful world of ours, The waters of life I drink: Behold my feet, as they 've pressed the flowers, That grow by the fountain's brink! “No thorn is hidden to wound me there; There 's nothing of chill, or blight, Or sighing to blend with the balmy air— No sorrow—no pain—no night!” “No parting?” I asked, with a burst of joy; And the lovely illusion broke! My rapture had banished my beauteous boy— To a shadowy void I spoke. But, O! that STAR of the morn still beams With light to direct my feet Where, when I have done with my earthly dreams, The mother and child may meet. THE WAR-SPIRIT ON BUNKER'S HEIGHT. The sun walked the skies in the splendor of June, O'er earth full of promise, and air full of tune; The broad azure streams calmly rolled to the deep, Whose waves on its breast stirred like babes in their sleep. The turf heaved its green to the white vestured flock, That fed, or reposed in the shade of the rock; The birds sang their songs by their nests in the bowers; And the bee hummed with sweets from the fresh opened flowers. The humming-bird glittered, and whirred o'er the cell, Where her nectar was stored, from the hill to the dell; 'Mid the bloom and the perfume, that passed on the breeze, From the rose, and the vine, and the fruit-bearing trees. It seemed like a gala, when Nature, arrayed In festival robes, with her treasures displayed, Reflected the smile of her Maker above, And offered up hymns of her thanksgiving love. And yet, in the bosom of man there were fires Fierce, quenchless and fearful—consuming desires For right unpossessed, and for lawless domain, That burned to the soul, and that flamed to the brain. In the streets there was clanging and gleaming of arms; In the dwellings, resolve, preparation, alarms; In the eye of the wife, mother, sister, a tear; In the face of their soldier, no semblance of fear. The patriot chieftain had marked out his ground, To hold, or to fall, if his foe passed the bound: And now was the hero to close in the strife, For death as a bondman, or freedom with life. The war-spirit hovered, and frowned on the height, His eye flashing lightning—his wings shedding night! From his wide fiery nostrils rolled volumes of smoke, And the rocks roared afar, as in thunder he spoke. At his dread shock of nature, the lamb from its play, The bee and the bird, in affright fled away; The branch, flower, and grass, felt the crush and the scath, And the winds passing by, snuffed the heat of his wrath. With blood, that, in torrents, he poured down like rain, He drenched the green turf, that he strewed with the slain, Till the eminence groaned with the carnage it bore, And its heart heaved and shuddered at drinking the gore. While the breath of the war-spirit scented the air, The rivers looked wild in reflecting his glare; And ocean's cold bosom was torn, as he gave The flap of his pinion to trouble its wave. The village besieged, wrapped in flames from his breath, Looked up to the hill, where he revelled with death, And swelled with the essence of life he had shed, To sweeten their cup, and the banquet to spread. O War-spirit! War-spirit, when didst thou bring Such trophies of beauty before the pale king, Since walking on Gilboa's height, in thy power, Of Israel's valiant to mow down the flower? Mourn, wail, O ye people! and spread wide the pall, Whose deep sable fringe down the hill-sides shall fall! Your brethren's warm blood cries aloud from the ground, That hosts, like Philistia's, in triumph surround. The lovely, the pleasant have perished! Alas! Where they fell may there hence be no dew on the grass! Let a monument there, towards the heavens rear its head, From a base, that shall cover the spot where they bled! Ah, War-spirit! War-spirit, deep was the gloom, Though heaven was unclouded, and earth all in bloom, When thou, at the onset, that young summer's day, Didst strike so much valor to darkness away! And yet, by that thunder, the land is awake: 'Twas the crack of her yoke when beginning to break! And out of that gloom is her glory to spread; Her living be franchised, immortal her dead. For up from that summit an eagle shall rise, To breast the thick clouds, till he sails the blue skies; And drop, while he bathes at the fountain of light, A plume from his pinion their story to write. It shall fall where they fell, on the still purple sward, Full and warm with the sunbeams their deeds to record; And move o'er the scroll in the hand of the free, While the wing where it grew spans the earth and the sea. THE INNER SELF. While others lie composed in sleep, Close wrapped in shade and silence deep, And starry hosts and angels keep Their vigils o'er the night, I have a curious work to do, A secret door to venture through, A wondrous being then to view; If I can stand the sight. I now take up the sacred key, Unlock my breast, and pass to see The inmost, true, essential ME: And lo! I here have found, Enclosed within its shrine, the heart, Myself, my thinking, reasoning part: But say, my spirit, what thou art, And whence, and whither bound! 'T is but with wonder, reverence, fear And shrinking, that I thus draw near The majesty, that meets me here, My soul, unveiled, in thee! I cannot give thy form, or hue, Or measure, or proportions true; But feel myself myself subdue, Thou deepening mystery. Not all the earth, nor air, nor sea Could furnish food to nourish thee; Nor welling founts, nor rivers free, The spirit's thirst allay: Nor silver web, nor cloth of gold, Nor stuffs, that time can e'er unfold, Nor pearls, nor gems this world may hold, Compose thee an array. Yet all the fibres of my frame Own that from thee their feeling came; And, at the slightest touch, will claim Thy closest sympathy. Thou art their life, their light, their spring, Informing them in every thing, But how they are allied, and cling, My nobler self, to thee. And do I thus the power survey, Whom all my meaner powers obey? Hand, foot and tongue and eye—are they The servants of thy will? And when they pause, repose to take, Dost thou, untiring and awake, Thy pinions spread, and swiftly make Thy wide excursions still? What art thou, never slumbering soul, To stretch thy wings from pole to pole— To span the globe—to mark its roll— Its elements to see, Conspiring thus, to prophesy Its end to come before thine eye, Whilst thou canst fire and flood defy, Nor ever cease to be? And, swifter than an eagle flies, Or arrows dart, dost thou arise Through air and space, and scale the skies, 'Mid shining spheres to roam: And with thy conscious rank elate, Dost stand and watch at heaven's bright gate, For glimpses of that rich estate Where thou may'st claim thy home. Thence, near the pit dost thou go down, To spy the difference 'twixt the crown Of life, and that dread withering frown, Which blights a spirit there. Then, on eternity's dark brink, Between them dost thou pause, and think, And ask, if thou shalt soar or sink— To joy or wo the heir. Too blind to trace thy being's plan, Too small my nobler part to span, I end my quest where it began, And from myself retire. I hence must own within my breast A power of unknown powers possessed— A flame, not long to be repressed, Of clear immortal fire. TIME. Time, with thy kind and never-wearying powers, Giving whate'er we fondly count as ours; Life, love, hope, faith, the sun, the stars and flowers; All that to man is dear to thee we owe! Yet does he call thee, slayer, robber, thief, And stern, as of his foes thou wert the chief, Filling his path with ruins, pain and grief, Without one tender blessing to bestow! Nature we laud, when thou, paternal Time, Hast given maturity, as well as prime, To all her works, in every age and clime, Since the first floweret on her bosom grew. Light from the darkness doth thy hand unfold Beauty from dust we in thy deeds behold: The frail, the dimmed, the withered, worn and old Thy breath dissolves, that they may shine anew. The city flames, and melts the tottering wall; Again she rises fairer for the fall. Thou beckonest back the flood! and at thy call, From crust-capped mounts, volcanic splendors pour. The absent sun his way to morning bends; The waning star to thy command attends, Fills out and burns; and man to dust descends, In hope to live, when thou shalt be no more. The leaves are scattered, yet the waiting tree Shall have them brought, in verdure, back by thee; The flower has vanished, but the trusting bee Will find her cell again with sweetness stored. The seed may perish, yet the germ will rise; The grain is ripened while its sheathing dies. The fruits of earth, the glories of the skies Forth by thy bounteous hand to man are poured. We owe thee still for gifts far more divine— The key to joys it never can be thine To give or take; and heavenly light to shine When we must enter that dark, shadowy vale. Where nought of earth the pathway can illume, Or lend one ray to shoot across the gloom, That gathers round the threshold of the tomb, When thou must there, first and forever, fail. Then, why does man so oft forget that he Owes all he is, and all he hopes to be, When thou and he are severed, but to thee? Why does he slay thee piecemeal, day by day? Shut out in exile from thine empire, there, In that unknown, dread, boundless country, where Is no retreat, no inn, how will he bear To have thy spectre haunt the endless way? Man's wisest study is to know thy worth And his relations to thee from his birth; To bring his course o'er this uneven earth, In a clear sunset, to a quiet close. Then, as a weary traveller is undressed, While gently thou the spirit may'st divest Of her worn garment, there remains a rest, And she goes franchised to that blest repose. And now, O Time, as one more hasty year Of thine is gone, thou hast another here! Grateful we hail it, though the bitter tear May have put out the light of joy that shone On many a face; though tender, sundered ties Have changed to chords that vibrate but with sighs, In many a stricken breast where sorrow lies, Draining the life-stream, while that year has flown. Countless the blessings showered in its flight; And seeming evils, turned and viewed aright, May prove but passing clouds, and lined with light. Our trust, deceived in earthly things, may teach The restless, eager spirit to forego Her crushing grasp on hollow hopes, that grow Like fragile reeds, to mock her hold below; And after higher, holier joys to reach. Time, then our nobler aspirations raise! Since few, and short, and fleeting are our days; And since, so peaceful are her pleasant ways, Teach us to wisdom to apply the heart: So that, when thou hast safely led us through Thy kingdom, with a brighter land in view, Calm at thy bourn, and with a kind adieu, We may, as friends, shake hands with thee and part. MY HEAD. “The day is come I never thought to see! Strange revolutions of my farm and me.” Dryden's Virgil. My head! my head! the day is come I never, never thought to see; When all, with fingers and a thumb, May to thy chambers have a key! That is, if thou wouldst but submit To come beneath the learned touch, And let the judge in judgment sit Upon thy bumps, that prove so much. I used to think our heads might let Their own contents, at will, be shown; I never thought mankind could get An outward way to make them known. But now the sapient hand has cut The matter short, and all may tell Thy value, as they 'd prize a nut, And know the kernel by the shell. If half the light, that has been thrown On heads, were only poured within, Thou wouldst not thus be left to own The darkness that is now thy sin. But, while the world is in a blaze Of purely phrenologic light, Thou, wildered thing, art in a maze, And destitute of faith and sight. They use a thousand meaning words Thou couldst not utter or define, Of which, to tell the truth, three thirds Were gravel, in a mouth like thine. They hold me out an empty skull, To show the powers of living brains: 'T is just like feeling of the hull, To tell what goods the ship contains. And, whether nature or mishap Have raised the bump, 't is all the same; The sage's crown, or dunce's cap Must be awarded as its claim. This hobby, that so many sit, And manage with such ease and grace, I dare not try with rein or bit, It seems so of the donkey race. And yet, my head, no doubt, 't is all A fault of thine, a want of sight, That so much said by Combe and Gall And Spurzheim cannot turn thee right. I know not what thy case may be,— If thou art hollow, or opaque; I only know thou canst not see, And faith declines one step to take. This burst of light has turned thee numb, Depriving thee of every sense; So now, if tried, thou must be dumb, Nor say one word in self-defence! THE WHEAT FIELD. Field of wheat, so full and fair, Shining, with thy sunny hair Lightly waving either way, Graceful as the breezes play— Looking like a summer sea; How I love to gaze at thee! Pleasant art thou to the sight; And to thought a rich delight. Then, thy voice is music sweet, Softly sighing field of wheat. Pointing upward to the sky, Rising straight, and aiming high, Every stalk is seen to shoot As an arrow, from the root. Like a well-trained company, All in uniform agree, From the footing to the ear; All in order strict appear. Marshalled by a skilful hand, All together bow, or stand Still, within the proper bound: None o'ersteps the given ground, With its tribute held to pay, At his nod whom they obey, Each the gems, that stud its crown, Will ere long, for man, lay down. Thou with promise art replete Of the precious sheaves of wheat. How thy strength in weakness lies! Not a robber bird, that flies, Finds support whereby to put On a stalk her lawless foot. Not a predatory beak Plunges down, thy stores to seek, Where the guard of silver spears Keeps the fruit, and decks the ears. No vain insect, that could do Harm to thee, dares venture through Such an armory, or eat Off the sheath to take the wheat. What a study do we find Opened here for eye and mind! In it who can offer less, Than to wonder, and confess, That on this high-favored ground, Faith is blest, and hope is crowned. Charity her arms may spread Wide from it, with gifts of bread. Wisdom, power, and goodness meet In the bounteous field of wheat. THE LITTLE TRAVELLER. I am the tiniest child of earth, But still, I would like to be known to fame, Though next to nothing I had my birth, And lowest of all is my lowly name. Yet, if so humble my native place, I this can say, in family pride, That I'm of the world's most numerous race, And made by the Maker of all beside. Although I'm so poor, I have nought to lose; Still I'm so little I can't be lost: I journey about wherever I choose, And those, who carry me, bear the cost. The most forgiving of earthly things, I often cling to my deadly foe; And, spite of the cruelest flirts and flings, Arise by the force that has cast me low. When beauty has trodden me under foot, I 've quietly risen her face to seek, Embraced her forehead, or calmly put Myself to rest in her dimpled cheek. I 've ridden to war on the soldier's plume; But startled, and sprung at the wild affray, The sights of horror, of fire and fume, And fled on the wing of the winds away. I 've visited courts, and been ushered in By the proudest guest of the stately scene; I 've touched his majesty's bosom-pin, And the nuptial ring of his lofty queen. At the royal board, in the grand parade, I 've oft been one familiar and free: The fairest lady has smiled, and laid Her delicate, gloveless hand on me. Philosopher, poet, the learned, the sage, Never declines a call from me; And all, of every rank and age, Admit me into their coterie. I visit the lions of every where, If human, or brute, and can testify To what they do, to what they wear, To wonders none ever beheld but I! And now, reviewing the things I've done, Forgetting my name, my rank and birth, I begin to think I am number one Of the great and manifold things of earth. I 've still much more, that I yet might tell, Which modesty bids me here withhold; For fear with my travels I seem to swell, Or grow, for an ATOM OF DUST, too bold! THE ENTANGLED FLY. Ah, thou unfortunate! Poor, silly fly, Caught in the spider's web, Hung there to die! What could have tempted thee? What led thee there, For thy foe, thus to throw Around thee the snare? Struggling and crying so Ne'er can unweave From thee the silken threads, Laid to deceive. Sorrow for wandering Comes now in vain; And, with one thus undone, Grief adds to pain. Yet, I will rescue thee, Unwary thing! Thou may'st again be off, High on the wing, If thou wilt promise me, Hence to be found Never more, as before, On evil ground. Trust not the flatterer Skilled to ensnare: He is a wily one; Think, and beware. Down to his dusky ways No more descend! Little fly, thou and I Both want a friend. Man hath an enemy, Whose snare is laid Softly and silently, Deep in the shade. Light, by the tempter shunned, Only can show Where, secure, free, and pure, Our feet may go. THE PEACH BLOSSOMS. Come here! come here! cousin Mary, and see What fair, ripe peaches there are on the tree— On the very same bough that was given to me By father, one day last spring. When it looked so beautiful, all in the blow, And I wanted to pluck it, he told me, you know, I might, but that waiting a few months would show The fruit, that patience might bring. And as I perceived, by the sound of his voice, And the look of his eye, it was clearly his choice That it should not be touched, I have now to rejoice That I told him we 'd let it remain; For, had it been gathered when full in the flower, Its blossoms had withered, perhaps, in an hour, And nothing on earth could have given the power That would make them flourish again. But now, of a fruit so delicious and sweet I 've enough for myself and my playmates a treat; And they tell me, besides, that the kernels secrete What, if planted, will make other trees: For the shell will come open to let down the root; A sprout will spring up, whence the branches will shoot; There'll be buds, leaves, and blossoms; and then comes the fruit— Such beautiful peaches as these! And Nature, they say, like a mighty machine, Has a wheel in a wheel, which, if aught comes between, It ruins her work, as it might have been seen, Had it not given patience this trial. From this, I'll be careful to keep it in mind, When the blossoms I love, that there lingers behind A better reward, that the trusting shall find For a trifling self-denial. THE BROKEN PIPE. Come here, little Willie: Why, what is the trouble? “I 've broke my new pipe, ma'— I can't make a bubble!” Well, do n't weep for that, child, But brighten your face, And tell how the grievous Disaster took place. “Why, Puss came along; And, said I, ‘Now she'll think That white, frothy water Is milk she may drink.’ “So I set it before her, And plunged her mouth in, When up came both paws, And clung fast to my chin. “Then I gave her a blow With my pipe; and it flew At once into pieces! O what shall I do? “I can't make a bubble! I wish naughty Kit Had been a mile off: See! there 's blood on me yet!” I'm sorry, my boy; yet Your loss is but just; You first deceived Pussy, And trifled with trust. In this, when you failed, You compelled her; and thence The wound on your face, From poor Kit's self-defence. Then, when you grew cruel And beat her, you know Your pipe and yourself Fared the worst for the blow. Let this lesson teach you, Hence never to stoop To make man, or brute, That may trust you, a dupe. And when you have power, It should not be abused, Oppressing the weaker, Nor strength be misused. For, often, unkindness Returns whence it came; And ever deceit must Be followed by shame. Remember this, William, And here end your sorrow; I'll buy you a pipe, To blow bubbles, to-morrow. VIVY VAIN. Miss Vain was all given to dress— Too fond of gay clothing; and so, She 'd gad about town Just to show a new gown, As a train-band their color to show. Her head being empty and light, Whene'er she obtained a new hat, With pride in her air, She 'd go round, here and there, For all whom she knew to see that. Her folly was chiefly in this: More highly she valued fine looks, Than virtue, or truth, Or devoting her youth To usefulness, friendship, or books. Her passion for show was unchecked; And therefore, it happened one day, Arrayed in bright hues, And with new hat and shoes, Miss Vain walked abroad for display. She took the most populous streets, To cause but aversion in those, Who saw how she'd prinked, And to bystanders winked, While the boys cried, “Halloo! there she goes!” It chanced, that, in passing one way, She came near a pool, and a green With fence close and high; And, as Vivy drew nigh, A donkey stood near it unseen. He put his mouth over its top, The moment she came by his place; And gave a loud bray In her ear, when, away She sprang, shrieked, and fell on her face. She thought she was swallowed alive, Awhile upon earth lying flat; And the terrible sound Seemed to furrow the ground, She embraced in her fine gown and hat. She gathered herself up, and ran, Yet heeded not whither or whence, To flee from the roar, That continued to pour Behind her, from over the fence. In passing a slope near the pool, She slipped and rolled down to its brim; The geese gave a shout, And at length hissed her out Of the bounds, where they 'd gathered to swim. In turning a corner, she met Abruptly, the horns of a cow That mooed, while the cur, At her heels, turned from her, And aimed at Miss Vain his “bow-wow.” Then Vivy's bright ribbons and skirt, As she flew, flirted high on the wind; The children at play, Paused to see one so gay, And all in a flutter behind. A group of glad schoolboys came by: Said they, “So it seems, that to-day, Miss Vain carries marks At which the dog barks, And that make sober Long-Ears to bray.” And when, all bedraggled and pale, Poor Vivy approached her own door, She went, swift and straight As a dart, through the gate, Abhorring the gay gear she wore. She sat down, and thought of the scene With humiliation and tears: The words, and the noise Of the brutes and the boys Were echoing still in her ears. She reasoned, and came at the cause, Resolving that cause to remove; And thence, her desire Was for modest attire, And her heart and her mind to improve. And soon, all who knew her before Remarked on the change and the gain In mind, and in mien, And in dress, that were seen In the once flashy Miss Vivy Vain. THE MOCKING BIRD. A Mocking Bird was he, In a bushy, blooming tree, Imbosomed by the foliage and flower. And there he sat and sang, Till all around him rang, With sounds, from out the merry mimic's bower. The little satirist Piped, chattered, shrieked, and hissed; He then would moan, and whistle, quack, and caw; Then, carol, drawl, and croak, As if he 'd pass a joke On every other winged one he saw. Together he would catch A gay and plaintive snatch, And mingle notes of half the feathered throng. For well the mocker knew, Of every thing that flew, To imitate the manner and the song. The other birds drew near, And paused awhile to hear How well he gave their voices and their airs. And some became amused; While some, disturbed, refused To own the sounds that others said were theirs. The sensitive were shocked, To find their honors mocked By one so pert and voluble as he; They knew not if 't was done In earnest or in fun; And fluttered off in silence from the tree. The silliest grew vain, To think a song or strain Of theirs, however weak, or loud, or hoarse, Was worthy to be heard Repeated by the bird; For of his wit they could not feel the force. The charitable said, “Poor fellow! if his head Is turned, or cracked, or has no talent left; But feels the want of powers, And plumes itself from ours, Why, we shall not be losers by the theft.” The haughty said, “He thus, It seems, would mimic us, And steal our songs, to pass them for his own! But if he only quotes In honor of our notes, We then were quite as honored, let alone.” The wisest said, “If foe, Or friend, we still may know By him, wherein our greatest failing lies. So, let us not be moved, Since first to be improved By every thing, becomes the truly wise.” THE BIRD'S HOME. O where is thy home, sweet bird, With the song, and the bright, glossy plume? “I'll tell thee where I rest, If thou wilt not rob my nest;— I built among the sweet apple bloom.” But what 's in thy nest, bright bird? What 's there, in the snug, downy cell? “If thou wilt not rob the tree; Nor go too near, to see My quiet little home, I will tell.” O! I will not thy trust betray, But closely thy secret I will keep. “I 've three little tender things, That have never used their wings! I left them there, at home, fast asleep.” Then, why art thou here, my bird, Away from thy young, helpless brood? “To pay thee with a song, Just to let me pass along, Nor harm me, as I look for their food!” THE BIRD UNCAGED. She opened the cage, and away there flew A bright little bird, as a short adieu It hastily whistled, and passed the door, And felt that its sorrowful hours were o'er. An anthem of freedom it seemed to sing; To utter its joy for an outspread wing,— That now it could sport in the boundless air, And might go any and every where. And Anna rejoiced in her bird's delight; But her eye was wet, as she marked its flight; Till, this was the song that she seemed to hear; And, merrily warbled, it dried the tear: “I had a mistress, and she was kind, In all, but keeping her bird confined; She ministered food and drink to me, But, O I was pining for liberty! “My fluttering bosom she loved to smooth; While the heart within it, she could not soothe: I sickened and longed for the wildwood breeze, My feathery kindred, and fresh green trees. “A prisoner there, with a useless wing, I looked with sorrow on every thing; I lost my voice, and forgot my song, And mourned in silence, the whole day long. “But I will go back, with a mellower pipe, And sing, when the cherries are round and ripe; On the topmost bough, as I lock my feet, To help myself, in my leafy seat. “My merriest notes shall there be heard, To draw her eye to her franchised bird; The burden, then, of my song shall be, ‘Earth for the wingless! but air for me!’” DAME BIDDY. Dame Biddy abode in a coop, Because it so chanced, that dame Biddy Had round her a family group Of chicks, young, and helpless and giddy. And when she had freedom to roam, She fancied the life of a ranger; And led off her brood, far from home, To fall into mischief or danger. She 'd trail through the grass to be mown, And call all her children to follow; And scratch up the seeds that were sown, Then, lie in their places and wallow. She 'd go where the corn in the hill, Its first little blade had been shooting, And try, by the strength of her bill, To learn if the kernel was rooting. And when she went out on a walk Of pleasure, through thicket and brambles, The covetous eye of a hawk Delighted in marking her rambles. “I spy,” to himself he would say, “A prize of which I'll be the winner!” So down would he pounce on his prey, And bear off a chicken for dinner. The poor frighted matron, that heard The cry of her youngling in dying, Would scream at the merciless bird, That high with his booty was flying. But shrieks could not ease her distress, Nor grief her lost darling recover. She now had a chicken the less, For acting the part of a rover. And there lay the feathers, all torn, And flying one way and another, That still her dear child might have worn, Had she been more wise as a mother. Her owner then thought he must teach Dame Biddy a little subjection; And cooped her up, out of the reach Of hawking, with time for reflection. And, throwing a net o'er a pile Of brush-wood that near her was lying, He hoped to its meshes to wile The fowler, that o'er her was flying. For Hawk, not forgetting his fare, And having a taste to renew it, Sailed round near the coop, high in air, With cruel intention, to view it. The owner then said, “Master Hawk, If you love my chickens so dearly, Come down to my yard for a walk, That you may address them more nearly.” But, “No,” thought the sharp-taloned foe Of Biddy, “my circuit is higher! If I to his premises go, 'T will be when I see he 's not nigh her.” The Farmer strewed barley, and toled The chickens the brush to run under, And left them, while Hawk growing bold, Thus tempted, came near for his plunder. As closer and closer he drew, With appetite stronger and stronger, He found he 'd but one thing to do, And plunged, to defer it no longer. But now had he come to a pause, At once in the net-work entangled, While through it his head and his claws In hopeless vacuity dangled. The chicks saw him hang overhead, Where they for their barley had huddled; And all in a flutter they fled, And soon through the coop holes had scuddled. The farmer came out to his snare. He saw the bold captive was in it; And said, “If this play be unfair, Remember, I did not begin it!” He then put a cork on his beak, The airy assassin disarming, Unspurred him, and rendered him weak, By blunting each talent for harming. And into the coop he was thrown: The chickens hid under their mother, For he, by his feathers was known As he, who had murdered their brother. Dame Biddy, beholding his plight, Determined to show him no quarter, In action gave vent to her spite; As motherly tenderness taught her. She shouted, and blustered; and then Attacked the poor captive unfriended; And you, (who have witnessed a hen In anger,) may guess how it ended. She made him a touching address, If pecking and scratching could do it, Till, sinking in silent distress, He perished before she got through it. We would not, however, convey A thought like approving the fury, That gave, in this summary way, Punition, without judge or jury. Whenever thus given, it tends To lessen the angry bestower; The fowl that inflicts it, descends— The featherless biped, still lower. THE ENVIOUS LOBSTER. A Lobster from the water came, And saw another, just the same In form and size; but gayly clad In scarlet clothing; while she had No other raiment to her back Than her old suit of greenish black. “So ho!” she cried, “'t is very fine! Your dress was yesterday like mine; And in the mud below the sea, You lived, a crawling thing, like me. But now, because you 've come ashore, You 've grown so proud, that what you wore— Your strong old suit of bottle-green, You think improper to be seen. To tell the truth, I don 't see why You should be better dressed than I. And I should like a suit of red As bright as yours, from feet to head. I think I'm quite as good as you, And might be clothed in scarlet, too.” “Will you be boiled?” her owner said, “To be arrayed in glowing red? Come here, my discontented miss, And hear the scalding kettle hiss! Will you go in, and there be boiled, To have your dress, so old and soiled, Exchanged for one of scarlet hue?” “Yes,” cried the lobster, “that I'll do, And twice as much, if needs must be, To be as gayly clad as she.” Then, in she made a fatal dive, And never more was seen alive! Now, if you ever chance to know Of one as fond of dress and show As that vain lobster, and withal As envious, you'll perhaps recall To mind her folly, and the plight In which she reappeared to sight. She had obtained a bright array, But for it, thrown herself away! Her life and death were best untold, But for the moral they unfold! KIT WITH THE ROSE. A rose tree stood in the parlor, When kit came frolicking by; So up went her feet on the window-seat, To a rose, that had caught her eye. She gave it a cuff, and it trembled Beneath her ominous paw; And while it shook, with a threatening look She coveted what she saw. Thought she, “What a beautiful toss-ball, If I could but give it a snap, Now all are out, nor thinking about Their rose, or the least mishap!” She twisted the stem, and she twirled it; And, seizing the flower it bore With the timely aid of her teeth, she made A leap to the parlor floor. And over the carpet she tossed it, All fresh in its morning bloom, Till shattered and rent, its leaves were sent To every side of the room. At length, with her sport grown weary, She laid herself down to sun, Inclining to doze, forgetting the rose And the mischief she had done. By and by her young mistress entered, And uttered a piteous cry, When she saw the fate of what had so late Delighted her watchful eye. But where was the one, who had spoiled it, Concealing his guilty face? She had not a clue whereby to pursue The rogue to his lurking-place. Thought kit, “I'll keep still till 't is over, And none will suspect it was I.” For the puss awoke, when her mistress spoke, And she well understood the cry. But, mewing at length for her dinner, Kit's mouth confessed the whole truth: It opened so wide, that her mistress spied A rose-leaf pierced by her tooth. Then kit was expelled from the parlor All covered with shame. And those Inclined, like her, in secret to err, Should remember kit with the rose. THE STORM IN THE FOREST. The storm in the forest is rending and sweeping; While tree after tree bows its stately green head; The flowerets beneath them are bending and weeping; And leaves, torn and trembling, all round them are spread. The bird that had roamed, till she thinks her benighted, Dismayed, hastens back to her home in the wood; And flags not a wing, till her bosom, affrighted, Has laid its warm down o'er her own little brood. And they, since that fond one so quickly has found them, To shelter their heads from the rain and the blast, Shall fearless repose, while the bolts burst around them; And lie calm and safe, till the darkness is past. Hast thou, too, not felt, when the tempest was drearest, And rending thy covert, or shaking thy rest, Thine own blessed angel that moment the nearest— Thy screen in his pinion—thy shield in his breast? When clouds frowned the darkest, and perils beset thee, Till each prop of earth seemed to bend, or to break, Did e'er thy good angel turn off, and forget thee? The mother her little ones, then, may forsake! Ah, no! thou shalt feel thy protector the surer— The sun, in returning, more cheering and warm; And all things around thee, seem fresher and purer, And touched with new glory, because of the storm! THE UPROOTED ELM. Alas! alas! my good old tree, A fatal change is past on thee! And now thine aged form I see, All helpless, lying low: The rending tempest, in its flight 'Mid darkness of the wintry night, Hath struck thee, passing in its might, And felled thee at a blow. And never more the blooming spring Shall to thy boughs rich verdure bring, Or her gay birds, to flit and sing Where their first plumage grew; For thou, so long, so fondly made My eye's delight, my summer shade, Here, as a lifeless king, art laid In state, for all to view. Thy noble trunk and reverend head, Defined on that cold, snow-white bed, And those old arms, so widely spread, Thy hopelessness declare: Thy roots, in earth concealed so long— That struck so deep, with hold so strong, Upturned with many a broken prong, Are quivering high in air. But yester-eve I saw thee stand, With lofty front, with aspect grand, Where thou hadst braved the ruthless hand Of time, and spread, and towered; And stood the rain, the hail, the blast, Till more than hundred years had passed: To fall so suddenly at last, Forever overpowered! Yet, while I sadly ponder o'er What now thou art, and wast before, Were sighs to rise, and tears to pour, Like summer winds and rain; Not all the sighs and drops of grief Could bring to thee one bud or leaf; Thou liest so like a stricken chief, By one swift arrow slain. But may'st thou prove an emblem true Of what the spoiler's hand shall do With one, who pensive here would view A shadowy type in thee! Let not the conqueror piecemeal slay, With power by power in slow decay; But strike, and all in ashes lay! Farewell, my good old tree! THROUGH THE CLOUDS. Through the clouds that veil the sky, Come, O sun, and sweetly smile! Show thy glory to mine eye, So my heart may beam the while. Come, and chase this day of night, For the world is sadly dim. To thy blessed face of light Let my spirit sing her hymn. Now, in silence and alone, I, to pass the heavy hour, Sit and fancy nature's moan After thy reviving power. Blasts of wildered, wandering air, Asking where thy face can be, Chill and cheerless, every where, Sighing, wailing, seek for thee. Mourning o'er the earth is spread; Bud and flower look pale with grief. Sick, the plant has hung its head; Dulness weighs on every leaf. Not a bird is heard to sing. Reft of thine inspiring ray, As a lyre of every string, Each from sight is hid away. Sable clouds, that veil the blue Of the skies, their shadows throw Here, until their sombre hue Gives a cast to all below. Come, O sun, and through the gloom Let thy beaming vesture fall! Bringing music, joy and bloom, Spread thy mantle o'er us all. What were there on earth to love— What were beauteous, bright, or dear, Wert thou not so true above, And thy holy influence here? MY ROSE TREE. Rose tree, O! my beauteous rose tree, Often have I longed to know How thy tender leaves were moulded— How thy buds are burst, and blow. I have watered, sunned, and trained thee, And have watched thee many an hour, Yet I never could discover How a bud becomes a flower. So, last night I thought about thee On my pillow, till, at last, I was gone in quiet slumber; And a dream before me passed. In it, I beheld my rose tree Stripped of flower, and bud and leaf; While thy naked stalk and branches Filled me with surprise and grief. Then, methought, I wept to see thee Spoiled of all that made thee dear, Till a band of smiling angels Mildly shining, hovered near. Gently as they gathered round thee, All in silence, one of them Laid his soft, fair fingers on thee, Pulling leaves from out the stem. One by one thy twigs he furnished With a dress of foliage green; While another angel followed, Bringing buds the leaves between. Then came one the buds to open; He their silken rolls unsheathed, While the one who tints the roses, Through their loosened foldings breathed, Then the angel of the odors Filled each golden-bottomed cell, Till, between the parting petals, Free on air the fragrance fell. Lifting then their shining pinions, Quick the angels passed from sight; Leaving, where aloft they vanished, But a stream of fading light. There I heard sweet strains of music, And their voices far above, Dying in the azure distance, Naming thee a gift of love. And, my rose tree stood before me, Finished thus by angel hands; Perfect in its bloom and fragrance, Beautiful, as now it stands. Hence, whenever I behold thee, I shall think of angels too; And the countless works of goodness They descend on earth to do. All unseen and silent, round us They their careful watches keep; Whether we may wake, or slumber, Guardian angels never sleep! THE INFANT BAPTIST. And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts until the day of his showing unto Israel. Luke i. 80. Child, amid the honeyed flowers Passing life's bright morning hours— Playing in the silver rills, Where they bathe Judea's hills— Looking, with an earnest eye, At the wild bird flitting by— Infant of the joyous heart, Canst thou tell me who thou art? Thou, whose little hand in play Hurls the clustered grapes away; While thou lov'st to watch the bee, Or to win a lamb to thee, And to see the fleecy flock Resting by the shadowy rock,— Know'st thou, tender, beauteous boy, What 's thine errand—whence thy joy? 'T was thy name that Gabriel spoke, By the altar, while the smoke From thy father's incense rolled, When thy being was foretold! Thou art come, the promised one, As the dayspring to the sun, Soon to usher in new light Through the realms of death and night! Heavenly innocence is now Marked upon thy peaceful brow: God's own Spirit filleth thee, Sainted babe; for thou art he, Who before the Lamb shall go, Crying, that the world may know He hath life to give the dead, In the blood he comes to shed! Though, from nature wild and rude, Come thy raiment, rest, and food, Nightly o'er thy desert sleep, Angels shall their vigils keep; Through the wilderness by day, They will guard and lead the way; Till to Israel thou appear, Showing heaven's mild kingdom near. High and glorious, then, the part For thine eye, and hand, and heart! When thy feet, on Jordan's side, Feel the waters, as they glide, Thou the Son of God shalt see, Come to be baptized of thee— Hear him named, and see the Dove Resting on him from above! HYMN TO SOLITUDE. O solitude, holy and calm! From tumult and crowds breaking free, I fly, sick and sad, for the balm I find given only by thee. Too oft from thy peace I depart, Kind guardian, friend of my soul,— And then bring an earth-wounded heart For thee to bind up and make whole. My spirit, now worn and oppressed, Her wings in thy bosom hath furled, To sink, as a bird in its nest, Away from a cold, faithless world! Alarmed at the shade and the chill, That o'er me its visions have cast, I here would lie lowly and still, Till sorrow's dark night hours are past. And then, from the dust may I rise, To mount, as the lark from her sod; And sing, as the morn of my skies Appears in the smile of my God. O solitude, sacred and sweet; Whilst thus in thy bosom I lie, Earth's baubles are under my feet— My heart and its treasure, on high. THE BIBLE IN THE FIELDS. I love to take this holy book, In summer's balmy hours, To study it beside the brook, Or by the trees and flowers. For here I read about the God, Who made this world so fair, The skies—the stream—the grassy sod And bloom, that scents the air. The birds flit round, and sweetly sing Of him, who feeds them all,— Who lifts the towering eagle's wing, And marks the sparrow's fall. The violet, from its soft green bed, To speak his goodness too, Presents its tender, purple head Baptized with silvery dew. And here the busy bee I view, As she comes swiftly by, And seems to ask, if she should do More work, or good than I. Her waxen house betimes to build I see her wisely bent; And then, with bread and honey filled To have it, still intent. The bees I find their sweets supplied In wild Judea's land, To feed the Baptist, when he cried, “Heaven's kingdom is at hand.” And when our Saviour, from the grave, Had asked his friends for meat, He ate the honey-comb they gave; And showed his hands and feet. This volume of his will revealed I here can read within, “Behold the lilies of the field— They neither toil nor spin!” And yet the king “was not arrayed In glory, like to them;” Their Maker's power is so displayed In flower and leaf and stem. And he sat on the mountain's side, Who spake these blessed words, Before him flowery fields spread wide— Around were trees and birds. The fleecy flocks, that sport so free On hill and valley deep, I love to watch: and here I see 'T is written, “Feed my sheep.” For thus I seem to keep in view, And feel how near I am To that dear friend of children, who Has named himself THE Lamb. THE HOARY HEAD. “The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of righteousness.” Aged man, with locks so hoary, High estate dost thou possess! They appear thy crown of glory, In the way of righteousness. Jewels, not of man's preparing, Form the shining diadem, Thou art from thy Sovereign wearing: God's own finger silvered them. Thine are honors, proved and heightened By the gift of lengthened years; In affliction's furnace brightened, Tried by cares, and washed with tears. Like thy Master, meek and lowly, Thou a thorny earth has trod; With thy breast a high and holy Temple of the living God. Aged saint, thy form is bending, Sere and withered, to the tomb; But thy spirit, upward tending, Budded for immortal bloom. MY FATHER. “In the evening time there shall be light.” Sacred the hour when thou, my sainted father, Wast of thy worn-out, sinking clay undressed, Softly, by his pale hand, who comes to gather Time's weary pilgrims home to joy and rest. Noiseless, and clear, and holiest of the seven, That day when thy last earthly sun went down: Thy Sabbath, closing here, began in heaven; Whilst thy meek brow changed ashes for a crown. Hush was the evening; not a zephyr swelling Heaved the tree-blossom, or the woodbine leaves; Silent the bird, that sang about our dwelling, Slept where she nestled, close beneath its eaves. A robin had, this spring, been seen taking materials from an old nest on an apple-tree near the door, and carrying them to the corner of the house, where she built on the top of the water-conductor, and close under the eaves, so near my father's chamber, that, when her brood had peeped, if the window was opened, their voices could be heard in the room, while she was feeding them. Cloudless the moon and stars above were shining, When time's last ray to thy mild eye was shed; While death's cold touch, life's silver cord untwining, Brought his chill night-dew on thy reverend head. Ninety full years of pilgrimage completing, Here didst thou linger till one Sabbath more: 'T was holy time; thy pure heart stilled its beating; Pain, work, and warfare were forever o'er! Meet hour for one, obedient, meek, and lowly, Wont, by command of Heaven, the day to keep, Called, at its evening, to the High and Holy, Peaceful in Jesus thus to fall asleep! Sweetly thy form, that seemed a blissful dreamer, Told, by its features, how the spirit smiled, Through the dark, shadowy vale, by thy Redeemer Led to his mansion, like a little child. Nature's full hand, that, on thy natal morning, Clothed earth to greet thee in the flowers of May, Brought them renewed; thy burial-spot adorning, When fourscore years and ten had rolled away. Now, while the robin, past the window flying, Leads off her young, forsaking here her nest, Constant the wild bird, where thy dust is lying, Sings her sweet hymn, a requiem to its rest. There has it joined the ashes of my mother, Faithful, rewedded to its only bride; And there thy latest-born, my younger brother, Thy fond heart's care, sleeps closely by her side. Yet, angel father, over Jordan's water Is it so far, that now thou canst not see Back to the shore, where lonely stands thy daughter, Sprinkling its rocks and thorns with tears for thee? Art thou so distant, visions of thy glory May not be granted to her mortal sight; When she so long watched o'er thy head so hoary, Smoothing its pillow, till that mournful night? Since here so oft, in pain, the path of duty Thy patient feet, with steady steps, have trod, Safe now they walk the golden streets in beauty; And, O! thy blessed eyes, in peace, see God! A SAGE HATH DEPARTED. The Lord, from his cloudy pavilion, hath spoken The soul to himself, and its dust to the clod; The cord He hath loosed, and the golden bowl broken, Who formed them so precious. Be still! it is God. A sage hath departed! the cities sit weeping; From land unto land does the gloom spread away. The seas give their wail to the winds o'er them sweeping— The spirit, that spanned them, hath passed from the clay! His form, pale and cold, the dark mansion encloses; Around it, Philanthropy, Science and Art Their tears for their friend, as in death he reposes, Shower warm o'er the hand, and the head, and the heart. But there, while affection her tribute is giving, The beauty, the grandeur, the power of his mind The grave cannot hide! in his deeds he is living; He shines in the light he diffused for mankind! That mind, as a guide that trod paths on the ocean Its marks o'er the billowy desert to place, While man has a heart, and the deep is in motion, The wide world shall honor, the mariner trace. The stars in their courses to grasp and to measure, His eye loved the blue arch of ether to climb; His soul rose beyond them to lay up a treasure More bright than the stars, more enduring than time. And here, while the sorrowing Salem His birth-place. is shrouded In weeds, for the son of her pride and her love, 'T is his to behold, with a vision unclouded, The glories unveiled of the Salem above. With Bowditch inscribed, for the whole earth's revering, In letters of light to each point beaming round, A monument formed of his works, now is rearing Its head, where with clusters of planets 't is crowned. THE BURIAL OF SCHILLER. The still and solemn, shadowy hour, When Saturday in Sabbath dies, O'er Weimar hangs; with clouds that lower And veil in black the moon and skies. Lo! from yon mansion lights appear, Pale glimmering through the midnight gloom. A coffined form is on the bier, And thence borne forward to the tomb. The funeral train, how sad and slow They follow that cold sleeping clay; While sighs and sobs of bitter wo Sound deep along the silent way. And now, the open grave beside, That dismal bier the bearers rest; And heavier waves of sorrow's tide Roll mighty o'er each mourner's breast. From him who slumbers in the shroud, As tremblingly they lift the pall, The moon rends off her veil of cloud, And o'er him lets her lustre fall. She beams her silvery, soft adieu, And is again in darkness hid; As if affrighted, thus to view The name on that dread coffin lid. For 't is her lover, now no more— Her friend, whom they to dust consign! And ne'er again is she to pour Her light,—for eyes like his to shine. 'T is done,—the fearful, final rite, Too sacred for the glare of day, Has passed beneath the shadowy night— Earth, earth has closed o'er Schiller's clay! But, hark! the heavens in thunder groan; They weep in torrents o'er his bed; And searching, fiery bolts are thrown, As if to find and wake the dead. These funeral honors, so sublime, Befit him well to whom they 're paid; And, at the birth of holy time, 'T is meet his dust at rest be laid. His spirit, bright with heavenly fire, Has burned its way through mortal strife; And gained its high, intense desire To solve the mystery of life. It is the budding month of May: This passing storm will call the bloom; A tribute nature soon will pay, To dress her deathless Poet's tomb. FUNERAL HYMN FOR PRESIDENT HARRISON. A wo-stricken people, in sorrow we gather! The dawn of our glory, our hopes full in bloom Are changed, with the face of our Chieftain, our Father, To sable and cypress to hang round his tomb. While pale in the shroud lies the Patriot sleeping, A light, that for earth is no longer to burn, Removed from its place, a sad nation is weeping; And dark, where it shone, falls the shade of an urn. When loud, through the land, hill and valley and mountain Were sounding his name, and reflecting its beams, The death-angel's wand opened grief's bitter fountain, To quench their warm joys with its far-flowing streams. Alas! that the spoiler so early must sever A tie, which the hearts of a country had bound To him, who is gone—who is gone, and forever, To join the bright hosts who their Saviour surround! Our Father in heaven, yet grant us another, Like him, who has left us, as orphans, below! O did not the Sage on his dear younger Brother, When called to thy presence, his mantle bestow? To Thee, who, from darkness, thy children hast stricken, We cry with our wound, asking balm from the Tree, Whose leaves heal the nations: Hear, hear us, and quicken Our wandering feet to return unto Thee! DIRGE FOR FELICIA HEMANS. They hovered around her, an angel band: They listened her notes to hear. The voice was one of their own bright land; But stained was the harp in their sister's hand, With marks of the falling tear. They saw she had wreathed it with deathless flowers; While many a beauteous leaf, That looked like the growth of their heavenly bowers, Was pale with the shade of her darksome hours, Or wet with the dews of grief. Then gently from under her hand they took Her harp, and laid it aside: The tremulous chords, at her parting look And the farewell sweep of her fingers, shook, And snapped as her numbers died. The angels had whispered of joys above, And wooed her with them to soar, Till spreading her wings like a peaceful dove, Her spirit arose for a world of love To wander on earth no more. Britannia, drop thy heaviest tear! O weep! it will be forgiven, That, fain we had kept in her bondage here A soul so pure, and a voice so dear Had longer withheld from heaven. SHE DIED, AS DAWNED HER NATAL DAY. She died, as dawned her natal day! Amid the buds and flowers of May Her spirit left the beauteous clay, In death's deep slumber here; And mounting up her starry way, Attained that holier sphere, Where falls no night o'er birth-day light— No sorrow brings a tear. The joy and glory of the skies With radiance fill her heavenly eyes, Where thornless flowers around her rise, And founts that ne'er shall fail; While here her form so lowly lies All silent, cold and pale; Where dews distil, and night-winds chill Moan through the shadowy vale. WRITTEN IN AN ALBUM, AFTER THE LINES OF A DECEASED FRIEND. Close to the lines that her dear hand had traced, Who took so soon an angel's form on high— After her name is my memorial placed For thee, my friend, and it shall tell thee why. I find a sweetness where her spirit breathed: A sacred halo round her name is thrown; So, with the flowers that here her fingers wreathed To borrow life from them, I twine my own. Fresh in thy heart and mine her memory lives, Fragrant and fair, and thornless in its bloom: Here with the precious odor that it gives, I fain my simple offering would perfume. Then, whatsoe'er the change that comes to me— Though death or duty put me far away, These silent leaves may still unfold to thee The wish of one who was thy friend to-day. Peace be to thee—long life, and joy, and health The blest allotment of thy sojourn here; The portion of a child of God, thy wealth, When time must close, and earth shall disappear! THE SOVEREIGN OF BABYLON. The monarch has opened his banqueting hall For his thousand lords, and his ladies all! The sparkling wine to each guest is poured, And mirth swells high at the festal board, Where none hath the heart more careless and light, Than he, whose glory must end to-night. With the cup and the revel the king grows bold— He calls for the vessels of silver and gold; The spoils his idolatrous father brought, 'Mid the impious deeds which that proud one wrought, From the temple of God, at Jerusalem, That he and his nobles may drink from them. Each sacred vessel they fill and raise To a laughing lip, as it speaks the praise Of the gods of metal, of wood and stone, But mocks at the name of the Holy One, Whose finger this hour shall come so near:— That lip will quiver and blanch with fear. Monarch! what's there, on the lighted wall, That can fix thy gaze and thy spirit appall? Why is thy countenance changed, O king? Is it one of thy gods this awe can bring, Which makes thy knees together to smite, Thine eye so wild, and thy cheek so white? “A hand! a hand! it hath written a line! And who will the terrible words define? A chain of gold shall encircle his neck— A vesture of scarlet his form shall deck— And the third, as ruler, shall be that seer, With honor and power throughout Chaldea!” Not all the wise and the learned of thine, Poor impotent one, shall explain that line! But the captive of Judah, him thy queen Has bid thee summon—let him be seen! His eye prophetic receives its sight From the Being, who caused the hand to write. The slave is brought to the potentate! To spurn his gifts, but to read his fate; To whom 't is inscribed on the lofty wall, “Thou art weighed, found wanting, and now must fall! Thy kingdom is numbered—the Persian and Mede Shall hence to thy throne and thy power succeed!” They come!—the foemen—nor sword nor flight, Shall win for that monarch the morning light! The haughty head where the crown was set, In dust is pillowed—with gore is wet! Ye, who are trusting in honor and gold, Look on him now, and your strength behold! THE DEER STRICKEN BY TORCH-LIGHT. The arrow! the arrow is fast in his side! And still through the forest they follow The poor stricken deer, that has nowhere to hide, And dared not to pause where the cool waters glide, When, leaping the brook, he would almost have died, One draught from its ripple to swallow. That deep-planted arrow! O how can he bear The anguish of feeling it quiver, When shook by the branches, the wave, or the air, As forward he bounds, but without heeding where, From thicket to crag, with the force of despair, To plunge in the cold, sweeping river? They hunted him hard, till the sun in the west Had sunk, while their aim he evaded. At evening, he sought a calm refuge of rest, And dropped from pursuit, by his terrors oppressed, Beneath the close branches, in verdure full-dressed, By night and the covert o'ershaded. But ah, the poor deer! they had doomed him to die! For near the green turf where he laid him, They lighted the torch, and they brandished it high; It glared through the boughs on his tender black eye, That fatally shone for the death-shaft to fly; His beauty, his beaming betrayed him: He cannot by flying now loosen the dart, The end of his tortures to quicken, By letting the life in one blood-gush depart. He seeks a retreat, like the warm, wounded heart, When, lone, slow, and silent, the victim of art, It dies, as a deer that is stricken. THE DEATH OF SAPPHIRA. This piece originally illustrated an engraving. Sapphira, Sapphira, awake! Alas! she is gone in the sleep That but the archangel can break; For life hath no slumber so deep. 'T is death! his pale ashes are cast On those withered lips, where but now An insult to Heaven was passed; His dumbness hath followed the vow. A bolt from above, swift and sure, Hath blasted the pride of the clay; The spirit, in boldness secure, In guilt hath been stricken away. O child of delusion! to stand The chosen of Jesus among, To cover the fraud of thy hand, By falsehood to him on thy tongue! How vain, the deceit of the heart To shroud in a mantle so frail! Its perfidy, thus by its art, To think from Omniscience to veil! Lost woman! but three hours before, The form of thy partner in sin Was borne, wan and cold, from the door, Where thou didst so rashly come in. And they, who had carried him out, The clods o'er his bosom to lay, Were waiting, the threshold about, To bear thee to darkness away. Sapphira, could Mercy restore, Or Pity thy spirit recall, To light up its dwelling once more, It should not thus hopelessly fall. But Mercy besought thee in vain, From death's awful brink to recede; To shun the despair and the pain Where she is forbidden to plead. And Pity's warm tear-drops must roll The more, that she cannot relume The clay whence the self-wounded soul Hath rushed to a suicide's doom. How potent, how maddening the love, O gold, of a mortal must be, To challenge an arm from above— To stake earth and heaven for thee! For Justice to Judgment will call; And who shall their coming abide, When wrath the most fearful of all, “The wrath of the Lamb,” is defied? WILLIAM AT SEA. Whilst thou art away, where the proud waves are swelling Beneath thy light bark, ever mindful of thee, The days of thine absence, at home we are telling, And counting the hours of our William at sea. And thou, whether cradled to sleep by the billow, Or watching the sport of the spray and the foam, If pensive on deck, or in dreams on thy pillow, We know hast thy soul rapt with visions of home. We know, when the sun mounts the east in his glory, Or smiles a “good night,” as the west he descends, Thy heart, pointing back, to itself tells the story Of mansion paternal, and kindred and friends. And when at the morning and evening devotion, While bending with offerings of praise and of prayer, To God we commend thee afar on the ocean, We feel thou art kneeling for us to him there. While months on the waters, long months are before thee, The two fluid worlds thou art tossing between— The cold deep below, and the skies bending o'er thee, Alone by their changes will vary the scene. Or, if a bright isle, on the flood-waste upstarting, Rude ocean's green oasis, rest thy glad eye, 'T will fade as a cloud—as a phantom departing, 'T will sink in the circle that bounds sea and sky. Should some white-winged ship, with her light pennon streaming, Thy heart on that wide watery desert to cheer, Arise, like a star through night's solitude beaming, With meteor swiftness she'll soon disappear. And when the coy sea-bird, a wild ether-sailor, Comes near on her passage, for one language more, O! how wilt thou long, ere she flies thee, to hail her, To ask whither bound, and the tidings from shore! Yet, while so unstable, so pathless and lonely, Thy way o'er that desolate deep may be found, 'T is marked with the impress of Deity only; His merciful arms will thy frailty surround. 'T is grand, 't is ennobling, while feeling and knowing His presence is power, and his banner is love, To look from that flood, to the firmament showing Bright shadowings-forth of his glory above. And, William, though tempest and terrors assail thee— Though clouds rolled on clouds hide the stars and the sun, Thy soul's chosen Friend never, never will fail thee! Winds and waves but obey that omnipotent One. While o'er and around thee thick darkness may gather; When wide yawns the deep, and the surges swell high, Thy spirit may hear the kind voice of her Father, Still whispering, “Be of good cheer; it is I.” And safe may he bear thee through perils and changes Besetting his course, who so widely would roam, Then speed thy return from the land of the Ganges, From pagod and painim! Dear William, come home. Come home, where the eyes beam through tears to behold thee; Where arms open wide to receive thee will be; And promise, while yet to the heart they infold thee To be, never after, our William at sea! MY PORTRAIT. Well, thou art done, cold, speechless thing; Yet, in thy silence, with the power A crowd of feelings deep to bring Unknown until the present hour. But wherefore done, to life so true? Not human pride, nor vanity Could ask the artist hand to do, And show the world a deed like thee. And was it simple most, or kind To have upon the canvass cast My semblance, thus to leave behind My shadow, when myself am past? I know not if another eye Will ever weep beside thee, more Than mine does now, I know not why— It never dropped such tears before. I view thee as a piece, composed To last, when I have passed from sight— When time and earth to me are closed, To be in time and earthly light. Perhaps 't is this, that makes me weep— The thought that I shall pass away, And those, who have thee then to keep, May glance at thee, and still be gay. But why should grief be felt by me, For fear that others will not grieve? And what to others then will be A shade of life, that I may leave? Still, from their deep, mysterious spring Gush up these hot, resistless tears; Whilst thou, cold, heartless, stoic thing, Dost wear a smile that 's set for years. Years! Ah, but then, when years shall wipe From being every line of thee, The spirit, which thy prototype Enshrined, shall live eternally! THE WIDOW'S ONLY SON. She wrapped her in her sable cloak, And walked beside the sea; But seldom of her sorrow spoke,— Too full of grief was she! 'T was this that made her heart so sad, To view the ocean wide: The only son, that widow had, Went out to sea and died. And then, in that great, rolling deep, With solemn, tearful eyes, His mess-mates lowered him down, to sleep Till all the dead shall rise. But where, among those waters vast, With ceaseless fall and swell, Her child to that repose had passed, The mother none could tell. She therefore questioned wave on wave, As up they heaved to shore, If they had rolled across his grave, Whom she must see no more. And often, when she marked a ship With full, returning sail, The color would forsake her lip, And speech and vision fail. For, O! she thought about the one That spread its canvass white, To waft away her only son Forever from her sight! But still, amid the bitter grief Which wrung that widow's heart, Her spirit felt the sweet relief That faith and hope impart. She knew her son had ever kept The path to heavenly rest— That, when he sank in death, he slept Upon a Saviour's breast. “My heavenly Father,” she would say, “I know the troubled sea But holds from me the precious clay: My child 's at home with thee!” THE YOUNG MOTHER. Composed in its beauty, the fair infant slept; But still the young mother sat by it and wept: She rocked not the cradle, she sang not the song, The sleep of her dear, only child to prolong. The same fleecy cover, so soft and so warm, That oft wrapped it sleeping, lay light o'er its form; Its pillow was downy, and smooth was its bed, And yet, that sad mother! her fond bosom bled. She knew that no dream of her babe, in its rest, Was now of her voice, or its home on her breast; She caught not the sound nor the balm of its breath: She knew that her little one slumbered in death! A hand with the pencil was called to portray The features and form of her child as it lay; But false were the hues and the touches of art To paint the bright image enshrined in her heart. Its lustre was drawn from a glory on high: No pencil of earth could the likeness supply; Nor yet on the canvass was mortal to trace A smile the pure spirit had left on that face. The skies, as they opened, their guest to receive, Had shed, on the dust they allured it to leave, A sign of the peace, of the joy, and the love, Encircling for aye the young angel above. That mother rose calm, when the beautiful clay Must be from her sight laid forever away! The gloom left her soul, as a cloud leaves the sun; It whispered, “Thy will, O my Father, be done!” EVENING AT ANDOVER SEMINARY-HILL. I stood on that majestic height, The lofty Hill of Andover, Where sacred science holds the light That beams to distant lands from her. For there the school of sages stands, Where, from afar, disciples meet For lore divine, in holy bands To sit and learn at Wisdom's feet. Within its consecrated walls Is kept and taught Jehovah's will:— The LAW, whose voice in thunder falls— The GOSPEL, whispering, “Peace! be still!” The structures while I viewed around, I seemed to breathe Mount's Zion's air; I set my foot with awe profound, As if the ark of God were there. Each earthly care was calm and dumb, For holier thoughts the soul to fill; As if the Shechinah had come To rest upon that reverend hill. A mellow glory crowned its head; And from its foot, in landscape wide, Profusely nature's charms were spread, Till in the distance vision died. It was a summer day's decline: The drowsy flowers began to close; The breezes lulled, that stirred the vine; And all things tended to repose. The sun, adown the western skies, Was sinking fast to pass from view, Calm as the righteous when he dies To earth, in heaven to live anew. And thence, on edifice and site, His golden smile was backward cast, As if he loved that favored height To bless the longest and the last. In eastern splendor, then arrayed, The full-orbed moon arose serene, Through evening's hush and night's cool shade To throw her lustre o'er the scene. Her silvery vesture wrapped in sheen The stately seminary pile, And fell on tree, and flower, and green, Where pearly dews distilled the while. And through the chapel's crystal shone Her light, within the place of prayer, Till bright-winged angels, from the throne Above, seemed met and hovering there. It was a scene—it was an hour A spirit bowed in dust to raise Ennobled, till its every power, Awaked to joy, was tuned to praise. Clear as that sun, fair as that moon, Shall thy dear Zion rise and shine Above her foes—Ah! Lord, how soon?— When shall the ends of earth be thine? HYMN OF THE PARTING CLASS. SUNG BY THEOLOGICAL STUDENTS. We feel the parting angel's hand Is in our midst, to loose the band So close, so sacred, and so dear, That long hath bound us, brethren, here. No more within this hallowed place, United at the throne of grace, Our prayers shall rise—our voices pour In praise, when this, our song is o'er. To each we hear the Saviour say We to his work must hence away; For great the field—the laborers few! What wilt thou, Lord, have us to do? O send thy Spirit from above To fire our hearts with heavenly love; And light our lips with truth, that we May, witnesses, go forth for thee. And may we count all else as loss To spread the glory of thy cross— From shades and death redeemed, to bring The priceless jewels of our King. On distant islands of the sea— On heathen shores our lot may be, To dying souls to bear the bread And balm of life on Calvary shed. Yet, though our lines be marked afar, And some beneath a foreign star, We may look upward to the Sun Of righteousness, and still be one. And when our works of faith are past, In joy we'll meet on high at last; And there, in praise, our voices swell The song, where enters no farewell. THE SPECKLED ONE. Poor speckled one! none else will deign To waft thy name around; So, let me take it on my strain, To give it air and sound. Yes—air and sound, low child of earth! For these are oft the things That give a name its greatest worth, Its gorgeous plumes and wings. But do not shun me thus, and hop Affrighted from my way. Dismiss thy terrors—turn, and stop; And hear what I may say. Meek, harmless thing, afraid of man? This truly should not be. Then calmly pause, and let me scan My Maker's work in thee. For both of us to him belong; We 're fellow-creatures here; And power should not be armed with wrong, Nor weakness filled with fear. I know it is thy humble lot To burrow in a hole— To have a form I envy not, And that without a soul. In motion, attitude and limb I see thee void of grace; And that a look supremely grim, Reigns o'er thy solemn face. But thou for this art not to blame; Nor should it make us load With obloquy, and scorn, and shame The honest name of Toad. For, though so low on nature's scale— In presence so uncouth, Thou ne'er hast told an evil tale Of falsehood, or of truth. Thy thoughts are ne'er on malice bent— Nor hands to mischief prone; Nor yet thy heart to discontent; Though spurned, and poor and lone. No coveting nor envy burns In thy bright golden eye, That calm and innocently turns On all below the sky. Thy cautious tongue and sober lip No words of folly pass, Nor, are they found to taste and sip The madness of the glass. Thy frugal meal is often drawn From earth, and wood, and stone; And when thy means by these are gone, Thou seem'st to live on none. I hear that in an earthen jar Sealed close, shut up alive, From food, drink, air, sun, moon and star, Thou 'lt live and even thrive: And that no moan, or murmuring sound Will issue from the lid Of thy dark dwelling under ground, When it is deeply hid. Thou hast, as 't were, a secret shelf Whereon is a supply, Of nourishment within thyself, Concealed from mortal eye. Methinks this self-sustaining art 'T were well for us to know, To keep us up in flesh and heart, When outer means grow low. Could we contain our riches thus, On such mysterious shelves, Why, none could rob or beggar us; Unless we lost ourselves! But ah! my Toadie, there 's the rub, With every human breast— To live as in the cynic's tub, And yet be self-possessed! For, how to let no boast get round Beyond our tub, to show That we in head and heart are sound, Is one great thing to know. And yet, the prison-staves and hoop To let no murmur through, However hard we find the coop, Is greater still to do. Then go, thou sage, resigned and calm; Amid thy low estate, And to thy burrow bear the palm For victory over fate. We conquer, when we meekly bear The lot we cannot shape, And hug to death the ills and care From which there 's no escape. THE MOON OF A WINTRY NIGHT. Moon, thou art wading through the gathered snow, That o'er us, on the fields of ether spread, Threatens, ere morning to be here below, To lie where our poor mortal feet must tread. Thy face is muffled in a gelid haze, That shrouds its lustre like a frozen veil; And kills the twinkling of the starry rays, Till all on high looks cheerless, dim, and pale. It gives almost the ague, to behold The skies so rayless, yet so far from dark; As when our hearth's white ashes, tired and cold, We stir in vain to find one pleasant spark. Yet, by to-morrow's eve our parts may shift, And thou be shining there, serene and clear, While we are hedged by many a frigid drift; Or sleigh-bells shrill may pierce the tingling ear. How dreary then the scene for thy mild beams To light, and for the burning stars to view! The hard ice coating all the lakes and streams, And one dead white where late gay flowerets grew. The naked trees, that stand with buried feet, Like skeletons, will slender shadows throw On what seems spread as nature's winding-sheet, While her slain beauties lie concealed below. Then, but to look abroad on vale and hill, Where one pale uniform invests the whole, Though it should make one's vital current chill, It must not let in winter to the soul! It must not bring a frost upon the heart, To kill affection's tendrils—friendship's root, Where vernal shoots and buds should ever start, And grow with summer flowers and autumn fruit: Nor cause the streams of thought to be congealed, Or, pressed beneath incumbent ice, grow low; But, like the fount that irrigates the field, Make bloom and verdure spring, where'er they flow. It must not make our shrinking fancies flee, Like birds of summer from the cold withdrawn; But wise, the mind should, like the prudent bee, On honey banquet, though the flowers are gone. Nor must it strike the hopeful spirit dumb, Or quench the beaming of her upturned eye, Or close her ear, or make her members numb, Ere her thank-offerings on the altar lie. And yet, fair Moon, methinks I like the best To see thy silvery lustre sprinkled here, When these bare branches all appear full-dressed, In some more gentle season of the year. I love to see it, mingled with the dew, Falling to bathe the sleeping buds and flowers; And soft, and silent, coolly streaming through The whispering leaves, that clothe the summer bowers. I love to see thy beaming mantle trail Along the flower-sprent borders of the rill, With rich, deep shadows stamped, o'erspread the vale, Or bind the forehead of the silent hill. I love to see thee through the foliage peep, Where, one soft hour before, the robin sung Her vesper song; the while, in downy sleep, With peaceful breast she guards her callow young. I love to see thee, when the whip-poor-will Moans in the hedge behind the cottage-eaves; And when the plaintive crickets, hidden, trill Their harvest-hymn among the golden sheaves. But these are tender memories—ay, and more— Fresh budding hope from memory's root that grows, To see earth clothed in beauty as before, When thou and we have struggled through the snows. Then come, sweet Moon, and fondly smile on me, From thy pure azure home, with face serene, While I will look abroad, and up to thee, And bless the great Creator of the scene. Others may call thee fickle—faithless—strange, When veiled in part, or wholly from their view; Yet, though twelve times a year thou seems't to change, Again twelve times I ever find thee true. 'T is our gross planet, heaving misty shrouds, Or rolled before thee, that our darkness brings, Just as earth's bulk or vapor hides or clouds Our glorious view of higher, holier things. TOM TAR. I'll tell you now about Tom Tar, The sailor stout and bold, Who o'er the ocean roamed so far, To countries new and old. Tom was a man of thousands; he Would ne'er complain nor frown, Though high and low the wind and sea Might toss him up and down. Amid the waters dark and deep, He had the happy art, When all around was storm, to keep Fair weather in his heart. Though winds were wild, and waves were rough, He 'd always cast about, And find within he 'd calm enough To stand the storms without. “For naught,” said Tom, “is ever gained By sighs for what we lack; Nor can it mend a vessel strained, To let our temper crack. “And sure I am, the worst of storms, That any man should dread, Is that, which in the bosom forms, And musters to the head.” Serene, and ever self-possessed, His mess-mates he would cheer, And often put their fears to rest, When dangers gathered near. If on the rocks the ship was cast, And surges swept the deck, Tom Tar was ever found the last, Who would forsake the wreck. And when his only hat and shoes The waters plucked from him, Why, these, he felt, were small to lose, Could he keep up and swim! Then through the billows, foam, and spray, That rose on every hand, He 'd, somehow, always find a way Of getting safe to land. The secret was, the fear and love Of Heaven had filled his soul: His trust was firm in One above, Howe'er the seas might roll. And Tom had sailed to many a shore, And many a wonder seen: The stories he could tell would more Than fill a magazine. He 'd seen mankind in every state, Almost, that man can know; But envied not the rich and great, Nor scorned the poor and low. The monarch in his sight had stood, Superb, in glittering vest; The savage, too, that roams the wood, In skins and feathers dressed. The tribes of many an isle he knew; And beasts, and birds, and flowers, And fruits, of many a shape and hue, In lands remote from ours. He 'd seen the wide-winged albatross Her breast in ocean lave; And bold sea-lions, playing, toss Their heads above the wave. He 'd seen the dolphin, while his back Went flashing to the sun, A swarm of flying fish attack, And swallow every one! The porpoise and the spouting whale Had sported in his view; And hungry sharks pursued his sail, As if they 'd eat the crew. And ever, when Tom Tar got home, The children, at their play, Were glad to have the sailor come, And greet them by the way. Then, oft, some curious stone, or shell, The laughing girls and boys Would find, that on their aprons fell, To put among their toys. “These pearly shells,” said he, “I found Where gloomy waters roar: These polished stones, so smooth and round, Rough surges washed ashore. “Though small to us a pebble seems, 'T is made and marked by One, Who gave the warmth, and lit the beams Of yon great shining sun. “And when these pretty shells I find, Along the ocean strand, Their beauteous finish brings to mind Their Maker's perfect hand. “When on the wildest shore I'm thrown, And far from human eye, I think of him who made the stone, And shell, and sea, and sky. “For he 's my friend, and I am his, Though cold and rough the blast: My safest guide I know he is, Where'er my lot is cast.” When Tom passed on, the children said, “These treasures from afar He brought us! Blessings on his head! For he 's a good Tom Tar!” THE SEAMAN'S HYMN. Landmen, on your downy pillows, While your eyes are sealed in sleep, Seamen, tossed 'mid foam and billows, Roam, for you, a boisterous deep. When the glorious light of day Is on your homes so peaceful dawning, Along our pathless, troubled way The surge swells high, the flood is yawning. When earth's flowers to you are blooming, Or your hearths are bright and warm; We behold the wild waves booming, Mount the shrouds, and brave the storm. Singing birds your hearing greet— Your hearts the kindred tone rejoices; While winds, that on our canvass beat, And roaring ocean join their voices. Then, to meet the High and Holy, When ye to his throne repair, O before him, meek and lowly, Bow for us, as suppliants there! When his blessed day appears, The dearest, best of all the seven, Your souls the gospel herald cheers; But none tells us of rest and heaven. Zion, bid thy sons and daughters Often, on the bended knee, Cry to Him, who rules the waters, For the wanderers o'er sea! Now, to Thee, the seaman's Friend, Our guide—our light—our ark abiding, Our Saviour, we our all commend, While time's rude waves in frailty riding. THE MARINER'S SONG OF DEPARTURE. While o'er the bright bay, With her streamers at play, Our bark in her beauty is gliding, As brothers, are we, The glad sons of the sea, Our own darling element riding. Good pilot, adieu; For the skies are all blue; And yonder, blue billows are bounding. We speed from the port, To be off by the fort, While her gun to the sunrise is sounding. We leave all behind, That a warm heart can bind, In home, love, and friendship endearing; While hope flies before, For a far, foreign shore, As the hand at the rudder is steering. And well do we know The proud waters below, That hence are by us to be ridden; 'Mid the corals and caves There are mariners' graves, Dark wrecks, and lost treasures deep hidden. Yet, before our frail bark, Be the way light or dark, Our Sun, and the Star that we follow, Is He, who unbinds Or enchains the strong winds; Whose hand holds the seas in its hollow. If o'er the bright skies The wild storm-spirit rise, And spread his black wings full of thunder, Our canvass we'll reef, Or heave-to for relief, And safely his pinions pass under. And so, 'mid the strife On the flood-waves of life, To Heaven in our ark lowly bending For help would we cry, Till the dove, from on high, Appears with the peace-branch descending. Thus, we 've friend, love, and home, Wheresoe'er we may roam The wide seas, from pole to equator— We 've a light, and high-tower, In the name and the power Of him, who is ocean's Creator. THE SEA-EAGLE'S FALL. An Eagle, on his towering wing, Hung o'er the summer sea; And ne'er did airy, feathered king Look prouder there than he. He spied the finny tribes below, Amid the limpid brine; And felt it now was time to know Whereon he was to dine. He saw a noble, shining fish So near the surface swim, He felt at once a hungry wish To make a feast of him. Then straight he took his downward course; A sudden plunge he gave; And pouncing, seized, with murderous force, His tempter in the wave. He struck his talons firm and deep, Within the slippery prize, In hope his ruffian grasp to keep; And high and dry to rise. But ah! it was a fatal stoop, As ever monarch made; And, for that rash—that cruel swoop, He soon most dearly paid! The fish had too much gravity To yield to this attack. His feet the eagle could not free From off the scaly back. He 'd seized on one too strong and great; His mastery now was gone! And on, by that prepondering weight, And downward, he was drawn. Nor found he here the element Where he could move with grace; And flap, and dash, his pinions went, In ocean's wrinkled face. They could not bring his talons out, His forfeit life to save; And planted thus, he writhed about Upon his gaping grave. He raised his head, and gave a shriek, To bid adieu to light: The water bubbled in his beak— He sank from human sight! The children of the sea came round, The foreigner to view. To see an airy monarch drowned, To them was something new! Some gave a quick, astonished look, And darted swift away; While some his parting plumage shook, And nibbled him for prey. O! who that saw that bird at noon So high and proudly soar, Could think how awkwardly—how soon, He 'd fall to rise no more? Though glory, majesty, and pride Were his an hour ago, Deprived of all, that eagle died, For stooping once too low! Now, have you ever known or heard Of biped, from his sphere Descending, like that silly bird, To buy a fish so dear? THE CAGED LION. Lion, like a captive king, Sad behind thy prison grate, Monarch, how I long to bring Back to thee thy lost estate! Where thy royal kindred live— Where thy native sky is warm, Sufferer, how I long to give Freedom to that noble form! Gladly would I know thee there, Bounding over Afric's plain, Wildly, with the desert air Wafting wide thy flowing mane. Are there words that can describe What thou wast, at liberty, When “The Lion of the tribe Of Judah” names his type in thee? Here, beneath thy keeper's hand, Where the blasts of winter freeze, Think'st thou of that palmy land, Thy mild country o'er the seas? Seen but through thy prison bars, Round thee set so strong and thick, Do not sun, and moon, and stars Make thy cowering spirit sick? Grace, and majesty, and power Were thy gifts by nature made; Yet, in one unhappy hour, All to lose, wast thou betrayed. When thou first was snared and caught, Never after to be free, How thy mighty spirit wrought In thee, like a troubled sea! But thou didst not, couldst not think Of the deep indignity, To which thou then wast doomed to sink— Of the exile thou must be. Oh! that quenched and languid eye Tells me of a pining heart: Homesick prisoner, sooner die Than remain the thing thou art. Liberty to me and mine— Liberty is life and breath! So no less to thee and thine— Bonds to both but lingering death. THE TRAVELLER AT THE RED SEA. At last have I found thee, thou dark, rolling sea! I gaze on thy face, and I listen to thee, With spirit o'erawed by the sight and the sound, While mountain and desert frown gloomy around. And thee, mighty deep, from afar I behold, Which God swept apart for his people of old— That Egypt's proud army, unstained by their blood, Received on thy bed, to entomb in thy flood. I cast my eye out, where the cohorts went down: A throng of pale spectres, no waters can drown, With banner and blades, seem to rise on the waves, As Pharaoh's bold hosts rushed in arms to their graves. But quick from the light of the skies they withdraw, At silent Omnipotence shrinking with awe; And each sinks away in his billowy shroud, From him who walked here, clothed in fire and a cloud. I stand by the pass, the freed Hebrews then trod, Sustained by the hand of Jehovah, dry-shod; And think how the song of salvation, they sang, With praise to his name, through the wilderness rang. Our Father, who then didst thine Israel guide, Console, and rebuke in their wanderings wide, From these gloomy waters, through this desert drear, O still in life's maze, to thy pilgrim be near! Let sins, that would hold in their service, or slay The soul, that would break from their bondage away, Forever be drowned in the blood of thy Son, Who o'er sin and death hath the victory won. Whilst thou, day by day, wilt thy manna bestow, And give, for my thirst, the Rock-fountain to flow, Refreshed by the way, will I speed to the clime Of rest for the weary, beyond earth and time. THE HEBREW CAPTIVES. Our altars they razed, and our temples profaned! The blood of our prophets and kindred they drained! And us, from our desolate homes did they bear Afar, the cold chains of the Painim to wear. And they, who had carried us captive, drew nigh; They looked on our woes with an insolent eye; Our burdens were heavy, our fetters were strong; And then, they required of us mirth and a song! We hung up our harps on the willows to sleep; By Babylon's rivers we sat down to weep; The song of the Lord, as too holy to sound, We shut in our souls, on that dark heathen ground. We thought of our Zion, and sent her a sigh By each gentle breeze, that went silently by; But poured not the strains in the proud Painim's ear, That God and his angels will hearken to hear! FRAGMENTS FROM “ESTHER,” A POEM. The monarch of Persia has wrapped o'er his breast The vesture, whose jewels emblazoned the throne: His lovely young queen, who in sackcloth is dressed, Is far from his presence, and weeping alone. And who in behalf of her people shall sue For mercy? To whom will the sovereign give ear? 'T is death now to be, in his kingdom, a Jew— 'T is death in his presence uncalled to appear. The wife of his bosom that peril will take! The helpless young Jewess, so gentle and fair, To live with her people, or die for their sake, Will go to her lord, and her nation declare. For little he deems that his idolized bride, The joy of his heart—the delight of his eyes, Is born of that race whom the Persians deride— A people, his nation oppress and despise. There 's wine at the palace, and feasting, and mirth; In Esther's still chamber there's fasting, and prayer; While he with the crown, has the homage of earth, She calls on her God her doomed people to spare. She thinks of her fathers in Egypt's dark land— She thinks of the bush, as in Horeb it burned; She knows who the hearts of the kings hath in hand, To turn them, as rivers of water are turned. To him, for support, and for light to her mind, She sends up the cries of her soul from the dust; Then, rising to go to the king, is resigned To do this and perish, if perish she must. With fasting and tears she is languid and pale; But o'er her young face beams the sunrise of soul; And flesh, though but feeble, and ready to fail, Is urged to its point by the spirit's control. The woman within her is timid and faint; The holy believer, unawed and serene; She goes to the presence, adorned as a saint, With power that has never invested the queen. And now are her people to safety restored— To peace, and their rights, when resistance had failed: A woman in weakness, who drew on the Lord For strength, o'er the mighty of earth hath prevailed. Fair Jewess, the tears thou hast dropped in the dust, As pearls, to Jehovah are precious and bright. The hand, that in sorrow has here been thy trust, Will crown thee with joy in the kingdom of light. GONE IN HER BEAUTY. O! she is gone! the wintry blasts, that sweep Wild round her mansion, trouble not her sleep: Gone in her beauty! Fast the drifting snows Fall cold, but harmless, o'er her deep repose! Here, in her circle of its gem bereft, Love hath but tears to fill the place she left. Sigh calls to sigh, from aching bosoms drawn. Void gives to void the mournful echo, “gone!” Spring will return, and bring around her door Sweet opening flowers, their odors there to pour, Striving to win her forth, who planted them, Once more to smile that they adorn the stem. Yet, must they wait her, till they die away: She was a fairer, lovelier flower than they, Snapped off in blooming! ere a leaf could fade, Cast into darkness! wrapped in silent shade! O! she is gone; and where shall burdened grief Pour forth her fountains for the soul's relief? Not to the dust to nourish earthly weeds: They yield no balsam while the spirit bleeds! Not unto death let sorrow's waters flow, But to death's victor may the weeper go! His risen glory, chasing mortal gloom, Shows grief a rainbow, bending o'er the tomb. THE NUN. Fair penitent, with rosary, And cross and veil, in gloomy cell, What guilty deed was done by thee, To cause thee here immured to dwell? Come forward, and present thy cause; That we may clearly judge, and know If violated human laws Imprison and afflict thee so: Or if it be some secret sin, That haunts thy contrite soul with fears; And here sequesters thee within The place of fasting, gloom, and tears? Art thou the guiltiest of thy race? Why, thou art human, it is true; Which is alone enough for grace To have renewing work to do. But, can devotion, warm and deep, Thy duty 's bounds so closely set, That faith may plough, and sow, and reap By trials shunned, instead of met? What ray of truth, revealed, would thus Make of a tender opening soul A close, dark blue convolvulus, And give its bloom this inward roll? Dost thou the never-fading crown Of life and joy intend to win, By here supinely sitting down, Where others but the race begin? And dost thou think to gain the palm By hiding from thy Saviour's foes; Or hope in Gilead's sacred balm A cure for self-inflicted woes? I never saw a Nun before; And therefore claim indulgence now, If I presume to question more Than courtesy might, else, allow: As one, then, who in darkness pleads, For light, I ask to be informed How, by a string of pegs and beads, A soul is raised, or fed, or warmed. Tell me, thou sober cabalist, What is the potent, hidden charm Hung on that string, or in its twist Contorted, for repelling harm? And is thy spirit kept so faint, It cannot mount to God above; But here must substitute a saint, In image, for a heavenly love? Has He, who lived and died for us— Whose gifts are light and liberty, Left in his Word the mitimus That here confines and fetters thee? Does He assign a living tomb For souls, endowed with vital grace; Or need surrounding convent gloom, To show the radiance of his face? And, pensive Nun, now what 's the chart That he has drawn, and left below, That by it every pious heart May follow on the Lord to know? Far from temptation, in retreat, Did he consume his earthly days? With houseless head, and weary feet, What were his works? and where his ways? O! get thy spirit's wings unfurled! Hide not thy candle, if 't is lit: Be in, but be not of the world, If thou wouldst shine to lighten it. Come out, and show that face demure; And see, if, smit on either cheek, Thy righteous soul would then endure To turn the other, and be meek. For, let me tell thee, coy recluse, If we are gold, we must be tried; If stones, we must be hewn for use, Or by the builder cast aside. The axe and chisel, we must bear, To give us smoothness, shape, and size, Are in the world—the furnace there; For Heaven the gold and silver tries. If we are salt to salt the earth, Ah, then, our savor, to be known, Must be diffused; for what 's the worth Of salt en masse, boxed up alone? The touchstone, where we must inquire If we have safely hid our life, Is found in pitfall, flood, and fire, Allurements sweet, and bitter strife. Come out! behold the billowy seas, The flowery earth, and shining skies: Say wherefore God created these; And then, fair Nun, thy beauteous eyes. Was it for thee to turn and slight The glorious things he spread to view— To give earth, ocean, air, and light, And freedom, for a dismal mew? O! if beneath some lawless vow To man, in self-delusion made, An heir of heaven is brought to bow, That vow were better broke than paid. What binds thee here? or who shall set His name endorsed a pledge for thee, When Christ has died to pay thy debt, And burst the tomb to make thee free? The world 's the great arena, where The fight of faith must well be fought, And each good warrior seen to wear The armor for the victory wrought. How dost thou know but it may be Thy foe, thy tempter, who has found This cunning way to corner thee, To keep thee from the battle-ground? Come forth, thou timid, hampered one, And doff that outward, odd disguise, That cumbers thee, if thou wouldst run, Or fight the fight, to win the prize. Come! from the bushel take thy light, And give its radiance room to play; Bind on thy shoes and armor tight, And up, and to the field away! TREES FOR THE PILGRIM'S WREATH. Knowing that tribulation worketh patience, and patience experience, and experience hope; and hope maketh not ashamed. Romans v. 3–5. Tribulation, if by loss, Or by thorny gain, the cross, Thou art not a barren tree; Seeds of Patience drop from thee. Patience, bitter from thy root Upward, till we reach the fruit, Thou hast golden grains to sow, Whence Experience full shall grow. Broad Experience, rank and dark; Thick in leaves, and rough in bark; Through thy dubious shade we grope, Till we grasp the bough of Hope. Hope, we 're not ashamed, with thee Showered by drops from Calvary, When thy branches shoot and bloom Through a Saviour's broken tomb. Trees, whereof the pilgrim weaves For his crown the mingled leaves, Wreaths of you are rich and bright; Earth 's the shade, and heaven 's the light. THE MUSHROOM'S SOLILOQUY. O what, and whence am I, 'mid damps and dust, And darkness, into sudden being thrust? What was I yesterday? and what will be, Perchance, to-morrow, seen or heard of me? Poor, lone, unfriended, ignorant, forlorn, To bear the new, full glory of the morn, Beneath the garden wall I stand aside, With all before me, beauty, show, and pride. Ah! why did nature shoot me up to light, A thing unfit for use—unfit for sight; Less like her work, than like a piece of art, Whirled out and trimmed exact in every part? Unlike the graceful shrub and flexile vine, No fruit, nor branch, nor leaf, nor bud is mine. No humming-bird, nor butterfly, nor bee Will come to cheer, caress or flatter me. No beauteous flower adorns my humble head, No spicy odors on the air I shed; But here I'm stationed in my sober suit, With only top and stem—I 've scarce a root. Untaught of my beginning and my end, I know not whence I sprang, or where I tend; Yet, I will wait and trust, and ne'er presume To question Justice—I, a frail Mushroom! THE SPIRIT AND THE MOUNTAIN. Mountain, with thy firm old foot Fast beside the sea, What was in thy keeping put, Prisoned under thee? “Hark, and hear the shuddering ground! Feel it rock and quake! Struggling fires, beneath me bound, Strive their chains to break.” Mountain, with a cloudy vest Girded o'er thy heart, Does it pierce thine aged breast, When its lightnings dart? “No:—beneath me far, the crash Of the bolt is felt: Here, the fiery chain and flash But adorn my belt.” Mountain, with a snowy crown Stainless on thy brow, Wilt thou never cast it down— Never, never bow? “When the mandate I shall hear From my Maker's throne, I will bow and disappear, Hence to be unknown.” Mountain, holding proud and high Thine old hoary head, What is written on the sky, Thou so long hast read? “Brighter than the stars and sun Shining over me, I behold the name of One Thou must die to see!” Mountain, bold thine eloquence— Glowing is thy speech; Mighty import flashes thence; What is it to teach? “Thoughts of Him, before whose breath I shall melt away; While of thee, soul—spirit, death Ne'er shall quench a ray!” THE FALL OF THE STATUE. A SCENE OF THE REVOLUTION. This declaration [of Independence] was received by the people with transports of joy. Public rejoicings took place in various parts of the Union. In New York, the statue of George III. was taken down; and the lead, of which it was composed, was converted into musket-balls. Goodrich's History of the United States. There stood in New York, when, the times growing warm, All o'er our fair country had gathered the storm, Which wore in its coming, so fearful a form, But left us the rainbow of peace, An image of royalty, stately and proud— A leaden old king, where his votaries bowed; While true friends of Liberty marked it, and vowed That its honors should speedily cease. And when our brave statesmen the article signed, Declaring us free, with pure freedom of mind, Columbia's true sons, feeling strongly inclined To learn how the statue was based, Assembled forthwith; and, besieging it, found That the king in head, body and limb was quite sound, And had of good lead in him many a pound, Which might be more usefully placed. Then, “Down with the ponderous George the Third!” From a mingling of voices together, was heard, With shoutings aloud, as they gave out the word, “Down with it! let it come down! We'll soon transform his grave highness of lead, And turn him to balls from the feet to the head; And then shall the mouths of our muskets be fed With him of the throne and the crown. “So now for the fall! for our Sages have met, And their names to a broad Declaration have set, That they are resolved, from this moment, to get Of the king independent and free; And to give by their valor a nation her birth, Or to empty their veins, a free gift to the earth, In Liberty's name, to betoken her worth To us and the millions to be. “Columbia's wrongs have gone to the skies; 'T is time that her blood and her spirit should rise Above her oppressors, till tyranny flies, And leaves her unfettered, to bear The flag of a nation instead of a chain— The palm of her triumph, 'mid weakness and pain, O'er them that were mighty, but struggled in vain To force her their shackles to wear. “And, no leaden monarch will we have to stand Proclaiming our vassalage here, in the land Of lovely Manhattan! We'll each lend a hand To give him a jerk or a pull, And flat to the ground, in a trice, as we bring His dignified form, it shall merrily ding, To sound all around how we honor the king, And pay our respects to John Bull. “This, this is the season for trying men's souls, The nerves of their arms, and the worth of their polls! So, we'll have his Majesty over the coals, And make him the first that shall run: When, heated to melting, he hides in the mould, We'll hold him there still, till new-shapen and cold; Then, off he shall go, like a tale that is told, In the voice of the thundering gun! “The discomposed Sovereign with us shall unite, And fly at his friends for our cause in the fight, To scatter his subjects—to purchase our right— The land of oppression to clear. And he, to whom, whizzing, his monarch shall come, In the form of a ball, 'mid the noise of the drum, The flashes and smoke, will have finished the sum Of his deeds as a royalist here!” Then, flat to the earth was his Eminence cast! The dust rose above him, and mounted the blast, While a bevy of Rome's feathered sentinels passed, Raised their wings, and huzzaed as he fell! But, how the proud royalist felt, when the lead Of his late British Majesty came at his head, While some dropped before it, and some turned and fled, Is more than a Yankee can tell. THE BIRD'S MATERNAL CARE. The following is but versified statement of a touching, literal fact that occurred not long since a few rods from my own door. A shadowy tree, that grew beside Its city owner's door, Its branches threw so high and wide, That many a bird could sing, and hide Among the leaves it bore. A robin came, and built her nest In that green rustling tree. At evening, there she sank to rest And furled her weary wings, as blest As little bird could be. Upon her side her drowsy head, Beneath her folded wing, She pillowed, while the night-hours fled: When morning flushed the east with red, She 'd wake, and mount, and sing. Five pretty eggs of azure hue, In that soft nest she laid. So clear and vivid was their blue, Like polished balls they shone to view, Of purest sapphire made. And many a day she brooded o'er Those treasures, till they grew, In what the shells contained before, To something different—something more— Young birds came peeping through! Five little baby birds were there, In that fond robin's nest, All callow; and their mother's care Was now to find their daily fare, And shield them with her breast. Her tiny game, or berries ripe From some far distant stem She 'd bring them; then her beak she 'd wipe, And sit upon a twig, and pipe A mother's tune to them. At length, the owner of the tree One dismal, stormy day, His window from the shade to free, The better in his room to see, Some branches lopped away. He dropped the very bough that hung A curtain o'er the nest. The sun burnt through the clouds, and flung His fire the helpless brood among, Till they were sore oppressed. Their tender mother then was seen To stand on weary feet, Where now they missed the leafy green, With one wing raised her babes to screen From sultry noontide heat. And, patient there, she day by day, Upon her nest's round edge, Stood up to keep the sun away, While, shaded thus, her nestlings lay Till time their forms could fledge. Then, when the master of the tree Beheld what love and care Within a mother bird could be, He wished in vain that he could see The bough still living there. Thus, thoughtless we may often pain Or grieve a feeling heart, Wherein the anguish must remain, While we may wish, but wish in vain, To lay or lull the smart. A good destroyed 's a fearful thing, And so 's a good undone! We, serving self, on self may bring A heavier ill—a keener sting Than what we sought to shun. 'T is little acts of good or ill, That make our vast account. No one, though great, does all God's will. Small drops the caves of ocean fill; And sands compose the mount. SONG. Little bird, little bird, with thy beautiful eye, Looking as if 't were cut out of a star, How do I know but it once was on high, Beaming through evening, sublime from afar? I cannot say what thy Maker divine, When he composed thee an optic so bright, Making the skill of his finger to shine, Drew from those high upper regions of light. Little bird, little bird, with thy spirit-like wings, Fleet as the air,—as the rainbow in hues, How can I tell but the Ruler of kings Formed them by those his blest ministers use? Were not the fancy-like tints of thy plume, Was not the delicate down of thy breast, Caught from the flowers that in Paradise bloom,— Plucked from the couch where the weary ones rest? Little bird, little bird, with thy musical voice Tuned like a seraph's, deep, flowing, and clear, Was not thy melody, touching and choice, Taught by some angel, who visited here? What, what, pretty fairy! so soon must thou go, Fleet as a vision, without a reply, Just like all other bright treasures below, Charming a moment, to change or to fly? THE WHITE MOTH. Beware, pretty Moth, so unsullied and white, Beware of the lamp's dazzling rays! It is not a drop of the sun! but a light That shines to allure little rovers by night; Away! there is death in the blaze. O why didst thou come from thy covert of green, The vine, round my window so bright; And pop in to know what was here to be seen, Forsaking thy shield, and escaping thy screen, And hazarding life by the flight? The down on thy limbs and thy bosom so pure That flame would most fatally singe: And nothing thy beautiful wings can insure From harm and from pain beyond mending or cure, If caught by their delicate fringe. Return, giddy wanderer, safe to the vine; And breathe in the fresh evening air; Go, look at the stars, as they twinkle and shine; And cling to a leaf, or the tendrils that twine, My soft little eavesdropper, there! And then, by a song I will sing, thou shalt know, Why thus I have lifted my arm To scare thee away from thy luminous foe, That threw out its beams, as a snare, and a show To tempt the unwary to harm. For, I through the day, have been guarded by One, Who, greater and wiser than I, Has pitied my frailty; and forced me to shun Illusive temptations, where I might have run The peril of sporting to die. 'T was kindness from Him, to whose care I commend Myself through the darkness of night, That taught me so quick to come in, as a friend, Between thee and evil, thy life to defend; Pretty Moth, so unsullied and white. EDWARD AND CHARLES. The brothers went out with their father to ride, Where they looked for the flowers, that, along the way-side, So lately were blooming and fair; But their delicate heads by the frost had been nipped; Their stalks by the blast were all twisted and stripped; And nothing but ruin was there. “Oh! how the rude autumn has spoiled the green hills!” Exclaimed little Charles, “and has choked the bright rills With leaves that are faded and dead! The few on the trees are fast losing their hold, And leaving the branches so naked and cold, That the beautiful birds have all fled.” “I know,” replied Edward, “the country has lost A great many charms by the touch of the frost, Which used to appear to the eye; But then, it has opened the chestnut-burr too, The walnut released from the case where it grew; And now is our Thanksgiving nigh! “Oh! what do you think we shall do on that day?” “I guess,” answered Charles, “we shall all go away To Grandpa's; and there find enough Of turkeys, plum-puddings, and pies by the dozens, For Grandpa' and Grandma', aunts, uncles and cousins; And at night we'll all play blind-man's-buff. “Perhaps we'll get Grandpa' to tell us some stories About the old times, with their Wigs and their Tories; And what sort of men they could be; When some spread their tables without any cloth, With basins and spoons, and the fuming bean-broth, Which they took for their coffee and tea. “They 'd queer kind of sights, I have heard Grandma' say, About in their streets; for, if not every day, At least it was nothing uncommon, To see them pile on the poor back of one horse A saddle and pillion; and what was still worse, Up mounted a man and a woman! “The lady held on by the driver; and so, Away about town at full trot would they go; Or perhaps to a great country marriage— To Thanksgiving-supper—to husking, or ball; Or quilting; for thus did they take nearly all Their rides, on an animal carriage. “I know not what huskings and quiltings may be; But Grandma' will tell; and perhaps let us see Some things, she has, long laid away:— That stiff damask gown, with its sharp-pointed waist, The hoop, the craped-cushion, and buckles of paste, Which they wore in her grandparents' day. “She says they had buttons as large as our dollars, To wear on their coats with their square, standing collars: And then, there 's a droll sort of hat, Which Mary once fixed me one like, out of paper, And said she believed 't was called, three-cornered scraper; Perhaps, too, she'll let us see that. “Oh! a glorious time we shall have! If they knew At the South, what it is, I guess they 'd have one too; But I have heard somebody say, That, there, they call all the New England folks Bumpkins, Because we eat puddings, and pies made of pumpkins, And have our good Thanksgiving-day.” “I think, brother Charles,” returned Edward, “at least, That they might go to church, if they do n't like the feast; For to me it is much the best part, To hear the sweet anthems of praise, that we give To Him, on whose bounty we constantly live:— It is feasting the ear and the heart. “From Him, who has brought us another year round, Who gives every blessing, wherewith we are crowned, Their gratitude who can withhold? And now how I wish I could know all the poor Their Thanksgiving-stores had already secure, Their fuel, and clothes for the cold!” “I'm glad,” said their father, “to hear such a wish; But wishes alone, can fill nobody's dish, Or clothe them, or build them a fire. And now I will give you the money, my sons, Which I promised, you know, for your drum and your guns, To spend in the way you desire.” The brothers went home, thinking o'er by the way, For how many comforts this money might pay, In something for clothing or food: At length they resolved, if their mother would spend it For what she thought best, they would get her to send it Where she thought it would do the most good. MUSIC OF THE CRICKETS. I cannot to the city go, Where all in sound and sight, Declares that nature does not know, Or do a thing aright. To granite wall, and tower, and dome My heart could never cling; Its simple strings are tied to home— To where the crickets sing. I'm certain I was never made To run a city race, Along a human palisade, That 's ever shifting place. The bustle, fashion, art and show Were each a weary thing; Amid them, I should sigh to go And hear the crickets sing. If there, I might no longer be Myself, as now I seem, But lose my own identity, And walk, as in a dream; Or else, with din and crowd oppressed, I 'd wish for sparrow's wing, To fly away, and be at rest, Where free the crickets sing. The fire-fly, rising from the grass A winged and living light, I would not give for all the gas, That spoils their city sight. Not all the pomp and etiquette Of citizen or king, Shall make my rustic heart forget The song, the crickets sing. I find in hall and gallery, Their figures tame and faint, To my wild bird, and brook, and tree, Without a touch of paint. And from the sweetest instrument Of pipe, or key, or string, I 'd turn away, and feel content To hear the crickets sing. O! who could paint the placid moon, That 's beaming through the bough Of yon high elm, or play the tune, That sounds beneath it now? Not all the silver of the mine, Nor human power could bring Another moon like her to shine, Or make a cricket sing. I know that, when the crickets trill Their plaintive strains by night, They tell us that, from vale and hill, The summer takes her flight. And were there no renewing Power, 'T would be a mournful thing, To think of fading leaf and flower; And hear the crickets sing. But, why should change with sadness dim Our eye, when thought can range Through time and space, and fly to him, Who is without a change? For he, who meted out the year, Will give another spring: He rolls at once the shining sphere, And makes the cricket sing. And when another autumn strips The summer leaves away, If cold and silent be the lips That breathed and moved to-day, The time I 've passed with nature's God Will cause no spirit sting, Though I 've adored him from the sod Whereon the crickets sing. CHILDHOOD'S DREAM. Give me back, give me back but my one infant dream, As it passed on the turf by my dear native stream, Where I slept from my play, while the wind tossed my hair, Till its ringlets, unbound, clasped the violets there. O return, fleeting time, the soft moments that flew By the calm sinking sun, and the fall of the dew, When, refreshing as light, and as dew to the flower O'er my young spirit came the blest dream of that hour! I remember the song of the bird, and the breeze With the perfumes it swept from the bloom of the trees, As my eyes gently closed; but the vision that stole Through my fancy's green bowers, come no more to my soul! They were sweet but to pass, as the odors that fled From the young flowers I crushed, while they pillowed my head; And like them, when they flew on the wings of the air, They are gone, and have left not a trace to tell where! They were clear as the sun in his mild, setting rays; They were pure as the stars, soon to kindle and blaze; But they 're gone! I have lost the dear dream of that sleep, As a bright planet drowned in the vast ether deep. Yet the face of my mother, through tears as she smiled, When she found, gently raised, and led home her lost child— I shall see that loved face by time's stream evermore, Till I follow her home, where life's dreamings are o'er. THE FRUIT-TREE BLOSSOM. My flower, thou art as sweet to me, Thy form as full and fair— As rich a fruit shall follow thee, As if thou hadst denied the bee The pure and precious gift, that he Wafts joyous through the air. The spices from thy bosom flow As freely round thee now, As if withheld an hour ago. Bestowing, thou canst still bestow; Though, whence thy gifts thou may'st not know, Or giving, tell me how. And future good, we yet shall find, Was hidden in thy heart; Its witness shall be left behind, When thou like all thy tender kind, Thy minutes summed, shalt be resigned Forever to depart. Thy ruin I would not forestall; Yet soon, I know, to thee Must come, what happens once to all:— Thy life will fail, and thou must fall— Must fade and perish, past recall, To vanish from the tree. Then, on the bough where thou wast sent To pass thy fleeting days, At work for which thine hours were lent, In silent, balmy, mild content, A rich and shining monument To thee will nature raise. Now, not in pride—in purpose high, Awhile in beauty shine; And speak, through man's admiring eye, Forbidding every passer by To wish to live, or dare to die With object less than thine. THE PLYMOUTH APPLE DECLINED. Visiting at the house of a friend in Boston, I was shown an apple which he told me had been sent to him from Plymouth, and was the fruit of a tree that was planted by Peregrine White, the first child born of Pilgrim parents in New England. I praised the apple for its beauty, and the venerable associations connected with it. He wished me to keep it; but, as he had no other of the tree, I declined the gift. I wanted the apple, when offered to me By its generous owner, but thought it not right To take it, because it had grown on a tree, That sprang from a seed sown by Peregrine White. And he, who thus proffered it, had none beside it; While diffidence checked the words,—“Let us divide it.” Now Peregrine White was the first white, you know, Who drew his first breath in New England—the child, Whose parents were making to bud and to blow, With its earliest blossoms, America's wild: But he with the fruit never questioned me, whether We might partake of the apple together. Though a fabled divinity once had let fall An apple of gold, where his favorites thronged, Inscribed, “Of the fair, to the fairest of all!” It was not to me this whole apple belonged: My friend was no god—and then I, but a woman; I thought that to halve it were just about human. The whole I declined; still I did not deny A wish that, unuttered, was strong in my heart; And from it entire, while averting my eye, I own I was secretly coveting part; And had he divided the offering presented, Preserving one half, I had come off contented. Had Solomon been there to put in a word, His wisdom had brought the debate to an end, Deciding at once, by the edge of his sword, This contest of kindness between friend and friend: Yet he with the apple was quite too short-sighted To see how I might in a half have delighted. I hope that next autumn he 'll go where it grew, And, if not forbidden the fruit, that he 'll reach And pluck a fair apple, then cut it in two, And tell me at once that a half is for each. Of friendship's best gift how the worth may be lightened By having it whole, when, if shared, how 't were heightened! THE HALF APPLE. A year after the foregoing poem was written, a nice little casket was sent me, at the distance of thirty-five miles, which, on opening, I found to contain the half of an apple like the one I had seen the previous autumn. The half of an apple, well-flavored and fair, Which shows by division such soundness of heart, I gratefully hold; and acknowledge the care And kindness of him, who retains t' other part. The fruit, that would perish, I taste with delight, The seed taking out to lay cautiously by, Because it encloses, concealed from my sight, An emblem of that, which in us cannot die. Its elements, when 't is laid low in the earth, If good, will arise in fresh verdure and bloom; As man's deathless soul seeks the world of its birth, When what it once dwelt in lies dark in the tomb. The little memento I'll hide in the ground, For Nature, its mother, to tenderly rear; And bright be its blossoms—its fruit fair and sound, When I and the giver no more shall be here! For, when I depart, and some good, living deed Would fain leave behind, in remembrance of me, At least, be it said that I planted a seed, That others might gather the fruit from the tree! THE HORTICULTURIST'S TABLE-HYMN. From him, who was lord of the fruits and the flowers, That in Paradise grew, ere he lost its possession— Who breathed in the balm, and reposed in the bowers Of our garden ancestral, we claim our profession. And fruits rich and bright Bless our taste and our sight As e'er gave our father in Eden delight: Our fount clear as that, which he drank from, here flows; Where green grows the myrtle, and blushing the rose. While some sit in clouds but to murmur, or grieve That earth has her wormwood, her pitfalls, and brambles; We smile, and go forth her rich gifts to receive, Where the boughs drop their purple and gold on our rambles. Untiring and free, As we work, like the bee, We bear off a sweet from each plant, shrub, and tree: Where some gather thorns but to torture the flesh, Ripe clusters we pluck, and our spirits refresh. Yet, not to self only, we draw from the soil The treasures that Heaven in its vitals hath hidden; For thus to lock up the fair fruits of our toil Were bliss half possessed, and a sin all forbidden. Like morning's first ray, When it spreads into day, Our hearts must flow out, until self melts away! Our joys, in the bosoms around us when sown, Spring up and bloom out, throwing sweets to our own. And this makes the world all a garden to us, Where He, who has walled it, his glory is shedding: His smile is its sun; and beholding it thus, We gratefully feast, while his bounty is spreading. Our spirits grow bright As they bathe in his light, That beams on the board where in joy we unite: And the sparks, which we take to enkindle our mirth, Are blessings from heaven showering down on the earth. And now that we meet, and the chain is of flowers, Which binds us together, may sadness ne'er blight them, Till those, who must break from a compact like ours, Ascend where the ties of the blest reunite them! May each, who is here, At the banquet appear, Where Life fills the wine-cup, and Love makes it clear; And Gilead's balm in its freshness shall flow On the wounds, which the pruning-knife gave us below! THE WHIP-POOR-WILL. Thou mournful bird, when shadows fell At yester-eve on hill and dell, I heard thee of thy sorrows tell; And, as the dews distil, Again, amid this twilight gray, I hear thee pour thy solemn lay, With only one sad thing to say, Still crying, “Whip-poor-will.” O who has grieved thee, gentle bird, That now thy vesper note is heard And with thy melting, triple word Thus dropping from thy bill? How could they rudely whip at thee, To scare thee from thy native tree, And send thee moaning back to me Repeating, “Whip-poor-will?” And wherefore did they whip thee so, To give thy voice this sound of wo, Which comes so plaintively to show That they have used thee ill? Didst thou go through the woods alone, Where brambly snares had thickly grown When thou wast taught thy piteous tone And story, “Whip-poor-will?” There have they made thee all the day In silence hide thyself away, To lose the light, the flash, the play Of sun, and fount, and rill? And didst thou now steal out, afraid Of midnight in the coppice shade, That here thy tender plaint is made Again, sad Whip-poor-will? The trembling stars and lunar gleam, That fitful in the thicket beam, Perhaps would make poor Willie dream His foes were round him still. And in the copse-wood, dark and deep, A waving flower, or leaflet's sweep Might startle thee, in troubled sleep To murmur, “Whip-poor-will!” My bird, there 's mystery in thy strain— A power I might resist in vain, With mournful joy—with pleasing pain My inmost soul to thrill. 'T is memory stirs to wet my eye By waking shades of days gone by, When first, a child, I heard the cry So solemn, “Whip-poor-will.” I call thee bird, yet thou may'st be A spirit! for I cannot see— I ne'er could catch a glimpse of thee; And undiscovered still The vision form, that might appear, Wert thou to sight revealed as clear, As is thy presence to mine ear, Mysterious Whip-poor-will. THE AUTUMN ROSE-BUD. Come out, pretty Rose-Bud, my lone, timid one! Come forth from thy green leaves, and peep at the sun; For little he does, in these dull autumn hours, At height'ning of beauty, or laughing with flowers. His beams, on thy tender young cheek as he plays, Will give it a blush that no other can raise; Thy fine silken petals they'll softly unfold, And fill their pure centre with spices and gold. I would not instruct thee in coveting wealth; But beauty, we know, is the offspring of health; And health, the fair daughter of freedom, is bright With feasting on breezes, and drinking the light. Then come, pretty bud; from thy covert look out, And see what the glad, golden sun is about: His shafts, should they strike thee, will only impart A grace to thy form, and a sweet to thy heart. TO L. A. E. ON HER WEDDING-DAY. That I will “be near” on thy “bridal day”— Be with thee before we are ten hours older, This hasty messenger comes to say, And bringing its witness,—a pearly folder. And this, perhaps, as a pointed sign, By the light upon Hymen's altar burning, May signify, to a heart like thine, “What a leaf to-day in thy life is turning!” May the lines for thy future reading there, With no sad characters dark or frowning, In every letter be bright and fair, To thee and to him thou to-day art crowning. Accept the token, and let it prove, As long as thou hence shalt remain its owner, When thou must be at a far remove From her, memorial of the donor. Thou 'lt see engraved on its handle-part, The form of a pen, with its top of feather— A type of the wings that heart and heart May find, when absent, to fly together. I send thee an opening, thornless rose, Harmless and soft as the peaceful turtle; With an emerald sprig from a branch that grows On the single stalk of my true green myrtle. I bound them about with a silver thread; But, ere thy hand is the cord untwining, The rose will have drooped, or its leaves be shed, While the myrtle still is freshly shining. But I will “be near” in thy bridal hour, This, “Wednesday, evening, at half past seven,” And give at the nuptials my holier dower,— A prayer for a smile on them from Heaven. TO MRS. H. F. L. To think of thee, my Hannah— To sit and think of thee, Is to my heart like manna, Or balsam from the tree. For, first, its tendrils feeding, It gives them strength to cling; And then, if pained or bleeding, It soothes the wound or sting. To thine, a fount of feeling The warmest and the best, 'T is sweet to seem revealing The secrets of my breast. Of half its care and trouble, My bosom, thus beguiled, Feels every joy is double, When on it thou hast smiled. 'T is dark and stormy weather— Our first October day; But we are here together, Though thou art far away. For still I feel thee near me— I see thy soft black eye— I fancy thou canst hear me, And I thy sweet reply. And yet, my friend, my dearest, This moment, where art thou? What envied eye is nearest, To look upon thee now? Is thine own Hannah present, In spirit, still with thee? And dost thou find it pleasant To feel alone with me? Then we are never parted! Nor distance, place, nor scene, The whole and faithful-hearted Shall ever come between. And when earth's changeful weather, Its joys and sorrows cease, O may we dwell together In deathless love and peace! MUSIC. Music? A blessed angel! She was born Within the palace of the King of kings— A favorite near his throne. In that glad child Of Love and Joy, he made their spirits one; And her, the heir to everlasting life! When his bright hosts would give him highest praise, They send her forward with her dulcet voice, To pour their holy rapture in his ear. When the young earth to being started forth, Music lay sleeping in a bower of heaven. A crystal fountain, close beside her, gushed With living waters; and the sparkling cup For her pure draught, stood on its emerald brink. While o'er her brow a tender halo shone, Kissed by the nodding buds, her head reclined Upon a flowery pillow. At her ear, The soft leaves whispered. On her half-closed lips The gentle air strewed spices, wooing them. Dropped o'er its radiant orb, the long-fringed lid Veiled the deep inspiration of her eye; But on her cheek the rose-tint came and went, At the quick pulse that fluttered in her breast, And spoke a wakeful spirit. In her sleep, With one fair hand thrown o'er its silent strings, Close to her heart she clasped her golden lyre, To slumber with her, while she fondly dreamed Of the sweet uses she might make of it To numbers yet untried. When, suddenly, A shout of joy from all the sons of God, Rang through his courts: and then the thrilling call, “Wake! sister Music, wake, and hail with us, A new-created sphere!” She woke! She rose— She moved among the morning stars, and gave The birth-song of a world. Our infant globe, With life's first pulse, rolled in its ether bed, Robed with the sunlight, mantled by the moon, Or tenderly embraced by stellar rays: Death, with his pale, cold finger, had not touched Its beauty then. No stain of guilt was here, And so, no cloud of sorrow cast a shade, Or rained its bitter drops on fruit or flower. As earth, on every side, shone fair to heaven, Not knowing yet whereto she was ordained, Music, from her celestial walks looked down, And thought, how sweetly she could wake the hills, Sing through the silent forests—in the vales— Beside the silver waters pour her sounds; And multiply her numbers by the rocks! She longed to give it voice to speak to God; And, being told of her blest ministry, Bathed in a flood of glory, till her wings Dripped with effulgence, as they spread, and poised, And passed the pearly gates in earthward flight. Made viewless by the circumambient air, And scattering voices to its feathered tribes, As down she hastened to the shining sphere, The happy angel reached the beauteous earth. At her electric touch, young nature smiled, And kindled into rapture; then broke forth With thousand, thousand songs. The green turf woke; The sea-shells hummed along the vocal shore, The busy bee, upon his honeyed flower. Osier and reed became Eolian lyres. Trees bore sweet minstrels; while rock, hill, and dell Sang to each other in a joyous round. Man, that mysterious instrument of God, When the warm soul of new-descended power Breathed on his heart-strings, lifted up his voice, Chanting, “Jehovah!” Since that blessed hour, While still her home is heaven, Music has ne'er This darkened world forsaken. She delights, Though man may lose, or keep the paths of peace, To soothe, to cheer, to light and warm his heart; And lends her wings to waft it to the skies. She throws a lustre o'er Devotion's face— Drinks off the tear from Sorrow's languid eye— Tames wild Despair—brings Hope a brighter bloom— Lulls Hate to rest—Love's ruffled bosom smooths; Pours honey into many a bitter cup; And often gives the black and heavy hour A downy breast and pinions tipped with light. She steals all balmy through the prisoner's grates, Making that sad one half forget their use. With holy spell she binds the exile's heart, And pours her oil upon its hidden wounds. Kings are her lovers—cottagers her loves: The hero and the pilgrim walk with her. Her voice is sweet by cradled infancy, And from the pillow of the dying saint, When a glad spirit borrows her light wings To practise for the skies, ere it unfolds Its own, and breaks its tenure to the clay. True, by man's wanderings for his tempter's lure, Music is often drawn to scenes unmeet For purity like hers; and made to bear Unhallowed burdens; or, to join in rites To turpitude in fellest places held. Yet, like the sun, whose beaming vesture, trailed O'er all things staining, still defies a stain; And is at night withdrawn, and girded up, Warm and untarnished for the morning skies— She comes unsullied from her baser walks, Sighs at the darkness, guilt and wo of earth; Breathes Zion's air, and, warmed with heavenly fire, Mounts to her glorious home! 'T was she, who bore The first grand offering of the free, on high, When to the shore, through Egypt's solemn sea, The franchised Hebrews passed with feet dry-shod, And pæans gave to their Deliverer there. She cheered the wanderers on; and when they crossed Over old Jordan, to the strong-armed foe, Still she was with them; and her single breath Laid the proud Painim's city-walls in dust! In native light, she walked Judea's hills, And sipped the dew of Hermon from its flower Before the Sun of righteousness arose. The Prophet chose her to unseal his lips, Ere God spake through them; and the Prophetess, To lift the heart's pure gift from her's to Heaven. When Israel's king was troubled, her soft hand Put close, but gently, to his gloomy breast, Reached the dark spirit there, and laid it still, Bound by the chords a shepherd minstrel swept. And since, her countless thousands she has brought To heaven's mild kingdom, happy captives led, By those sweet glowing strings of David's lyre. But oh! her richest, dearest notes to man, In strains aerial over Bethlehem poured, When He, whose brightness is the light of heaven, To earth descending for a mortal's form, Laid by his glory, save one radiant mark, That moved through space, and o'er the infant hung, He summoned Music to attend him here, Announcing peace below! He called her, too, To sweeten that sad supper, and to twine Her mantle round him, and his few, grieved friends To join their mournful spirits with the hymn, Ere to the Mount of Olives he went out So sorrowful. And now, his blessed word, A sacred pledge, is left to dying man, Then at his second coming in his power, Music shall still be with him; and her voice Sound through the tombs and wake the dead to life!</field>
